Budapest 1117, Hungary., email: levai@agr.unideb.hu 2Institute of Crop Sciences, Division of Agricultural Botany and Crop Physiology, Debrecen University 3 NYÍRERDİ Nyírségi Forestry Corporation Abstract: The distribution of Fe, Cu, Mg, Mn and Zn was measured in healthy and infected by Crown-gall tumour (Ustilago maydis Dc.Cda.) corn seedlings five days after the infection. The distribution of elements listed above was also measured under different iron supplies. Due to the infection – as a biotic stress – the amount and distribution of examined elements have been changed in comparison to the non-infected (control) plants. On the bases of the differences in the distribution of iron between the symptom-less and tumorial leaf parts, we have come to the conclusion that the infection has also got an effect on the mobilization of iron inside the plants. Only the total amount of iron was higher in the infected plants, while the infection increased the translocation of iron and copper to the shoots. The iron efficiency also has an effect on iron uptake and distribution. The distribution of iron between the roots and shoots was examined under 1/10, normal (5 x 10-4 M FeEDTA) and tenfold iron efficiency. The iron uptake was much higher in infected plants and the iron status also had an effect on the uptake and distribution of other examined elements too. Keywords: biotic stress, distribution of elements, infection. Introduction In respect of plant production the investigation the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on plant physiology is essential (Birkás et al., 2006; Veres et al., 2006; Mészáros et al., 2008, Szöllısi et al., 2008). Iron deficiency (chlorosis) can be observed on leaves, which have sufficient iron contents. The decreased mobility and physiological activity of iron is due to endogenous reasons The leaves or leaf parts also become chlorotic as a result of certain infections e.g. in corn seedlings infected by crown-gall tumour (Ustilago maydis, Dc.,Cda.). The leaf areas showing symptoms of infection are chlorotic and tumour development can be seen. Other leaf areas of the same leaf are green. The iron and other element contents were measured in the roots and shoots of infected and healthy corn seedlings as well as in symptom-less and symptom-showing leaf parts of infected corn seedlings. Materials and methods The monosporidial strains were separated from the multisporidial mixture. The infection was induced with the 1:1 mixture of two compatible monosporidial strains. The inoculums were diluted with distilled water corresponding to sporidium concentrations of 2,5x10 3 x mm -3 . The two-strain hybrid of corn (Zea mays L. cv. Norma) was used in the experiments. The seeds were treated for 4 hours with 5mM CaSO4, and transferred on moistured filter paper and germinated in the dark at 25 °C for two days. The tip of coleoptiles of seedlings with 5-10 mm shoots were cut then infected by vacuum infiltration method. The non-infected seedlings got the same treatments without sporidium. The seedlings were then transferred to nutrient solution that was continuously aerated and changed in every second day. Plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions with 70% humidity, a light intensity of 220 µEm -2 s 1 , a day-night temperature of 25–23 °C and a light-dark period of 14-10 hours. The</p><p id="Pg3">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 6 samples were collected on the 5 th day after the infection. The roots of seedlings were washed in 0.1 N HCl to remove the apoplasmatic-bounded ions. The shoots and the roots were separated. The leafs of infected seedlings were then divided into symptomshowing and symptom-less parts. The samples were dried at 85 °C. The content of elements was measured by OPTIMA 3300DV ICP-OA spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). Results and discussion The infection – as a biotic stress – has a significant effect on the uptake and distribution of measured elements (Dadhich and Somani, 2007). There are differences in the distribution of elements between the symptom-less and symptom-showing leaf parts of infected corn seedlings. Except the Zn, contents of measured elements were lower in the symptom-showing leaf parts then in the symptom-less leaf parts, in comparison with the control (non-infected plants) leaves. The Fe and Mg content of infected leaves was an average 21% and 5% higher than that of the control. Other element contents were higher in the control leaves. The results can be seen in Table 1.

There were no significant differences observed in the distribution of examined elements in infected plants in comparison to the non-infected ones- except the distribution of Cu.

The higher iron content in the leaves of infected plants shows, that the infection increases also the transport of iron from the roots to the shoots. Nevertheless, the contradiction remains: the symptom-showing leaf parts are chlorotic, while the iron content of their surrounding leaf parts is 21 % higher than that of the control. The effect of different iron supplies on the uptake and distribution of elements also was examined. Iron was added in form of Fe-EDTA in the concentration stated above. Under low iron supply, the iron content of the roots and shoots of infected plants was similar to that of those observed under a normal iron supply. Under a low iron supply, the iron content of the infected plants is significantly higher than that of noninfected plants. There were no differences observed in the iron content of shoots of infected and non-infected plants under normal and high iron supplies. The results are shown in Table 4. Table 4.

Cereal Research Communications 8 Conclusions The chlorosis of the leaves of infected plants is not caused by iron deficiency since the leaves have high iron content. The content of the examined elements in symptomshowing (tumorial) leaf parts was lower in comparison to the control, while there were higher values observed in the symptom-less leaf parts of infected plants. The highest difference was measured in the case of iron. The biotic stress also has an effect on the distribution of elements between roots and shoots (Sharma et al., 2007). The highest difference was measured in copper. The translocation of copper to the shoots of infected plants was twice as high as in the non-infected plants. The iron content of roots of infected plants was also higher. Supposedly the infection increases the uptake and distribution of iron. The infection modifies the uptake and translocation of elements, but the most significant results were observed in the case of iron. Iron supply also has an effect on the uptake and distribution of several elements. The most significant differences were observed in the uptake and distribution of iron and zinc. The iron and zinc content of shoots seems to be normal under a low iron supply. The infection is supposed to induce high iron, zinc and copper requirements. These ions play a role in enzymes, e.g. SOD, that has a significant role in defence mechanism, and in the elimination of free radicals, developed by the infection. References Birkás, M., Dexter, A.

The influence of a factorial combination of four salinity concentrations (0, 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl added as solution) and three cadmium (Cd) levels (0.3, 2.5 and 5 mg kg-1) in peat soil on mineral accumulation, vegetative growth and edible hypocotyl yield of radish plants (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) was studied in a greenhouse. After 34 days of exposure to NaCl treatment, salt-stressed plants had a reduced number of fully developed leaves (up to 30%) and total fruit yield (up to 35%) in addition to the progressively increased Na and Cl concentration as well as significantly lower K concentration in leaf and hypocotyl tissues. Salinity significantly increased the uptake and accumulation of Cd in leaves (up to 20%). In contrast, raising salinity levels did not affect the Cd translocation and deposition into the edible hypocotyls (Cd contents being 4- to 6fold lower than in leaves), which may indicate that the phloem mobility of Cd in radish plants is relatively poor and unaffected by NaCl exposure. Contamination of growing media by Cd (separately and in combination with NaCl salinity) had no effect on any measured parameter, except that accumulation of Cd in radish tissues was increased by an order of magnitude compared with non-contaminated control. Keywords: salt stress, metal pollution, phytoaccumulation Introduction Salt-affected and metal-contaminated areas are increasing rapidly, becoming one of the greatest threats to modern agricultural production and human food safety (Varallyay, 2007; Ondrasek et al., 2009). Radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) is an important commercial vegetable culture consumed worldwide, whose edible part (thickened fleshy hypocotyl and the upper part of the root) grows and develops in the top soil, commonly the part of the soil profile most exposed to salinization and metal pollution (e.g. fertigation, atmospheric/fluvial deposition, etc.), (Ondrasek et al., 2008; Romic et al., 2008). Exposure to excessive rhizosphere salinity affects water and mineral nutrients transport processes within the plants, which may disturb the ion homeostasis and compromise the vegetative growth and crop yield. Phytoextraction from contaminated soils and accumulation in edible crop parts represents the most common entry for potentially harmful nonessential trace metals into the human foodstuffs. Only several metals (e.g. zinc and copper) are essential in trace amounts, whereas highly toxic Cd has no known essential physiological functions in plants, animals or humans (Clemens, 2006). Trace metals cations form complexes of different solubility and phytoavailability with inorganic (e.g. chlorides and sulphates) and organic ligands (e.g. humic and fulvic substances). Organic matter, as one of the most important soil properties affecting availability and phytoextraction of (non)essential trace elements (Rengel, 2007), can create organically-complexed metal (Cd) forms that have poor bioavailability. In contrast, excessive salinity in soil solution, especially increased concentration of chloride ions (Cl ), could significantly enhance Cd solubility and thus bioavailability</p><p id="Pg7">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 10 and phytoaccumulation (Khoshgoftarmanesh et al., 2006). Thus, growing crops on saline and Cd-contaminated soils may potentially increase bioaccumulation and toxicity of Cd, namely by increasing Cd entry into the human food chain. This study was conducted to quantify the effects of increasing root zone salinity and contamination of organic soil with Cd on mineral accumulation, and vegetative and yield parameters in radish plants. Materials and methods A two-factorial split-plot greenhouse experiment was performed with radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus, cv. Tarzan) planted into the peat substrate (Klasmann, Potground H). Treatments were: four levels of salinity applied in the nutrient solution (0, 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl) (main factor), and three peat Cd levels achieved by spiking peat substrate (initially containing 0.3 mg Cd kg -1 as 0 control) to the target levels of 2.5 and 5 mg Cd kg -1 (sub factor). To avoid early salt stress, salinity treatments started 3 weeks after sowing, with salinity gradually increasing over time (10 mM NaCl daily increments to final concentrations). Samples of fully developed leaves (L) and edible hypocotyls (H) were taken at technological maturity, 34 days after salinity treatments started. Concentrations of Cd in plant samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (MPX AX, Varian), whereas concentrations of K and Na were detected by atomic emission spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, 3110), and Cl by a colourimetric assay at 470 nm on Segmented Flow Analyser (Skalar San Plus). Results were subjected to ANOVA by using MIXED procedure in statistical software SAS (SAS Institute, 2001), and the means were compared using Tukey-Kramer's test at the 0.05 probability level. Results and discussion There was no significant interaction of salinity and Cd contamination on any measured parameter (Table 1). Raising root zone salinity significantly reduced vegetative growth (up to 30%) and total hypocotyl yield (up to 35%) in addition to the progressively increased Na (in leaves up to 11 times, in hypocotyl up to 10 times) and Cl (in leaves up to 4 times, in hypocotyl up to 7 times) as well as significantly lower K concentration (in leaves up to 37%, in hypocotyl up to 23%), (Table 1). Increasing salinity enhanced Na and Cl accumulation in all analyzed tissues, most likely in combination with water deficit, nutrient imbalance (e.g. K, Ca, Mg) and ion toxicity (Grattan and Grieve, 1999); these combined effects resulted in decreased vegetative growth and total hypocotyl yield of radish plants (Table 1). Contamination of growing media by Cd resulted in significant increases of Cd concentration (by one order of magnitude) in leaf and fruit tissues. Exposure to increasing NaCl salinity in the rhizosphere environment increased accumulation of Cd in leaves by 11-20% compared to unstressed control, whereas no significant difference in Cd accumulation in edible hypocotyls was observed with increasing salinity (Table 1).</p><p id="Pg8">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 11 The interaction between salinity and trace elements is complex and poorly understood, with salinity increasing, decreasing, or having no effect on micronutrient availability and phytoextraction (Grattan and Grieve, 1999). Furthermore, it has been shown that soil and/or nutrient solution salinity in environments low in organic matter and other metal-binding components (e.g. clay particles) significantly improve Cd uptake and its accumulation in shoots and/or edible tissues of some vegetable and leguminous crops (Smolders and McLaughlin, 1996; Helal et al., 1999). In this study, NaCl salinity also enhanced uptake and accumulation of Cd in leaves, but not its translocation and deposition into the edible fruit tissue of radish plants (Table 1). Table 1.

An addition of Na + could decrease Cd sorption on soil particles, thus increasing its readily available soil solution concentration. Furthermore, plant roots act as a barrier against excessive uptake of many potentially toxic elements (Rengel, 2007). As a nonessential element, Cd most probably enters root cells via uptake pathways for essential cations that are similar to Cd, e.g. Zn, Fe and Ca (Clemens, 2006); selectivity for these ions under NaCl stress could be strongly compromised (Muhling and Lauchli, 2003). Furthermore, some researchers suggested that Cd chlorocomplexation is one of the possible mechanisms for enhancing Cd uptake and accumulation in plants (McLaughlin and Singh, 1999, and references therein). In the present study, concentration of dissolved chloride ions in salt-affected soil treatments was more than sufficient (&gt;10 mM) to allow formation of relatively stable Cd chlorocomplexes (Naidu et al., 1994). Leaf accumulation of all observed metals exceeded their accumulation in fruit, suggesting that the apoplast and the vacuoles of leaf cells may be the sites of</p><p id="Pg9">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Higher root zone salinity did not enhance Cd accumulation in radish hypocotyls, suggesting that radish has low capacity to translocate Cd via phloem from developed leaves to fruits, and that phloem mobility of this element in radish is relatively poor and unaffected by NaCl salinity. Conclusions NaCl-induced salt stress (expressed as reduced vegetative growth/yield and K accumulation) was accompanied by increasing Na and Cl concentration in radish tissues. Cadmium uptake and leaf deposition was markedly enhanced by NaCl, whereas Cd translocation and hypocotyl accumulation was up to 6-fold lower and not influenced by NaCl salinity.

The aim of the research was to determine the heat tolerance of various wheat varieties and to measure changes in their quality in two phases of development (shooting and grain filling) under controlled phytotronic conditions. Changes in the yield quantity, the grain diameter, the protein content and the ratio of protein components were examined in plants exposed to extremely high temperatures. It could be seen from the results that in the earlier developmental phase the varieties were much more sensitive to heat stress than in the adult stage. Heat stress during grain filling led to a significant reduction in yield parameters. Decreasing values of UPP% (unextractable polymeric protein) and the Glu/Gli (glutenin to gliadin) ratio generally indicate a deterioration in quality despite the increase in the protein content. The plants suffered heat shock when treated at 41°C. Keywords: winter wheat, heat stress, grain yield, protein content, glutenin/gliadin ratio Introduction High temperature is one of the most important abiotic environmental factors during grain filling and may influence both the quantity and quality of the yield. High temperature after anthesis causes a reduction in grain filling (Wardlaw and Moncur, 1995; Veisz et al., 2008), more rapid apoptosis and the earlier attainment of harvest maturity (Altenbach et al., 2003). The severe yield losses are caused by a reduction in the starch content, which makes up more than 65% of the dry weight of cereals (Barnabás et al., 2008; Rakszegi et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2008). Reductions in grain weight in response to stress in the early phases of grain filling could be due to a lower number of endosperm cells (Nicolas et al., 1985), while a decrease in starch synthesis during the later phases of grain filling could be caused by limited supplies of grain assimilates (Blum, 1998) or by direct effects on the process of synthesis in the grain (Yang et al., 2004). High temperature stress has a greater influence on starch accumulation in the middle phase of grain filling than in the early phase (Yan et al., 2008). Starch accumulation was found to be coordinated with the sucrose content of the grain and with the activity of the enzymes sucrose synthase, AGPP (adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase), SSS (soluble starch synthase) and SBE (starch branching synthase), suggesting that low sucrose supplies and a drop in the activity of the enzymes involved in starch synthesis are responsible for the decline in starch accumulation. The accumulation of proteins also undergoes a change in response to heat stress. The accumulation of proteins active in biosynthesis and the metabolism shifts in favour of storage proteins and of those involved in defence against biotic and abiotic stress factors. Specific protein responses depend on whether high temperature is experienced during the early or middle phase of grain filling (Hurkman et al., 2009). It has been proved that the protein content of grains exposed to heat stress after anthesis rose significantly in response to the stress (Balla and Veisz, 2007; Labuschange et al., 2008, in press). A reduction in the glutenin/gliadin ratio has a negative effect on flour quality, despite the increase in protein content (Bencze et al., 2004). High temperature is capable of causing substantial changes in the accumulation level of gluten proteins</p><p id="Pg11">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 14 during grain filling. Grains exposed to stress exhibited reductions in thousand-kernel weight, diameter and starch content in response to the treatment (Labuschange et al., 2008, in press). The data indicate that reduced grain yield and grain number may be caused not only by post-anthesis stress but also by pre-anthesis stress. The most sensitive phase proved to be stem elongation, while booting and anthesis were moderately sensitive, and the phase between heading and anthesis was the least sensitive (Ugarte et al., 2007). The present paper discusses the response of the yield to heat stress in two different developmental stages in wheat varieties with different levels of heat tolerance. Materials and methods The heat stress studies were carried out under controlled conditions in a climatic chamber on two winter wheat varieties (Mv Mambó and Bánkúti 1201) in early and late stages of development (at shooting in the 8 th week, and 12 days after heading). High temperature treatment was applied for 15 days. In the control treatment the plants were kept at day/night temperatures of 17/13°C in the shooting stage and 24/20°C in the adult stage, while in the stress treatments the temperature was raised to 30/20°C in the case of young plants and to 41/20°C for the adult plants (Tischner et al., 1997) The grain number per plant, grain yield and thousand-kernel weight were recorded after harvest. The protein content was determined using a Kjeltec Auto Sampler System 1035 Analyser (with a factor of N × 5.8). The weight and diameter of the grains were measured with a Single Kernel Characterization System 4100. The total glutenin, gliadin contents of the samples were determined using the SE/HPLC technique according to the modified method of Batey et al. (1991). The unextractable polymeric protein fraction (UPP %) was determined using the method of Gupta and MacRitchie (1993). Two-factorial analysis of variance was used for the statistical evaluation of the data (Kuti et al., 1998). Results and discussion High temperature caused the greatest changes in the grain yield, grain number and thousand-kernel weight. Stress caused more drastic reductions in young plants (e.g. grain yield decreased by 49–55%, grain number by 46–63%) than in older plants (e.g. grain yield decreased by 32–49%, grain number by 6–17%). Heat stress at shooting led to significant reductions in yield and grain number in both varieties (Figs. 1–2). Fifteen days of heat stress during grain filling caused a significant decline in both grain weight and grain diameter in Mv Mambó and Bánkúti 1201 compared with the control (Figs. 3–4). In young plants the two varieties responded differently, with a slight increase in grain weight and diameter for Mv Mambó and a slight reduction for Bánkúti 1201 compared with the control. An analysis of grain quality revealed that in both phenophases there was a significant increase in grain protein content in both varieties (Figs. 3–4). The greatest change was caused by heat stress to young plants, which could be attributed to a drastic decline in the yield per plant and the grain number as a consequence of forced heading. The varieties responded differently to extremely high temperature (41°C) during grain filling, with a greater increase in protein content in Mv Mambó and a smaller rise in Bánkúti 1201. The relative increase in protein content after heat stress at a late stage of development could be attributed to a reduction in grain</p><p id="Pg12">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 15 weight and grain diameter and to a drastic decline in the starch content (Barnabás et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2008). However, the rise in the grain protein content in heat-stressed plants did not lead to an improvement in grain quality, as quality analysis indicated the unfavourable composition of the gluten proteins. There were exceptions, such as the increase in the unextractable polymeric protein content (UPP %) and the Glu/Gli ratio in Bánkúti 1201. A serious decline in the UPP % is associated with poorer breadmaking quality, despite the higher protein content caused by heat stress. In most cases a reduction in the glutenin/gliadin ratio is indicative of quality deterioration. There was a drastic (significant) reduction in the glutenin/gliadin ratio in Mv Mambó in both young and older plants, suggesting poorer quality, but the old Hungarian variety Bánkúti 1201 proved to be much more resistant. This variety only exhibited greater sensitivity to the 30°C stress at the shooting stage (lower Glu/Gli ratio, but higher UPP %).

The drastic rise in the protein content in response to the treatments was not associated with an improvement in yield quality, due to the unfavourable gluten protein composition (reduction in Glu/Gli ratio or UPP%). The rise in the relative protein content when high temperature was applied during the grain filling phase could be explained by reductions in the thousand-kernel weight (28–37%), the grain mass (22– 29%) and the grain diameter (16–23%), while in the shooting stage it could be attributed</p><p id="Pg13">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 16 mainly to the drastic decline in the grain number and yield per plant (with a significant increase in the thousand-kernel weight), probably due to a reduction in spikelet differentiation, caused by the incorporation of protein rather than starch (Barnabás et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2008).

In 1999 the capability for nutrient uptake of hybrids showed great differences, the control yield ranged between 3300-3600 kg ha-1. In the case of Arena hybrids, the yield enhancing effect of fertilization was significant. Yield maximum was achieved at 90 kg ha-1 N+PK dose by the examined hybrid. However, the fertilizer response curve of Pixel was distinct and decreased from N30+PK fertilizer dose. In the crop year of 2000 the control hybrids were significantly different. From among the hybrids, the fertilizer response curve of Alexandra and Arena PR reached the highest yield-level, however, the response on increasing fertilizer doses was much lower in 2000 than in the previous year. In 2001, the yield surplus attained with fertilization exceeded 1200 kg ha-1, the average yield increase was 910 kg ha-1. These values lead to the conclusion that the fertilization effect was significant. In 2008, hybrid NX 65001 reached the highest absolute surplus yield (1047 kg ha-1). At N30+PK dose each hybrid reached the maximum yield. The depressive effect of nutrient increase had most significant effect on hybrid NK Neoma, in the case of which the yield decrease started already at N60+PK fertilizer dose. To summarize the results of the four years, we can conclude that on chernozem soil in different years the nitrogen dose belonging to the yield maximum changes in the range of 30 to 90 kg/ha N+PK depending upon the hybrid, higher fertilizer dose was applied in drier years. Keywords: sunflower, fertilization, cropyear, yield surplus Introduction Sunflower has very good adaptation capacity (Bíró and Pepó, 2008; Mijic et al., 2008¸ Borbélyné Hunyadi et al., 2008). Since the number of sunflower hybrids requiring new and more intensive hybrid specific production technologies is growing, the importance of fertilization has increased. Out of the hybrid specific elements of production technology, the determination of the exact fertilizer need is of high importance. The extreme values of specific fertilizer needs of sunflower to produce 100 kg grain are 3.56 kg N, 0.9-3.0 kg P and 4.5-18 kg K (Lásztity, 1983). However, on low fertility soil high share of the demand has to be supplied by artificial fertilization (Harmati, 1992). The suggestion of small fertilizer doses are supported by Kandil (1984), who claims that sunflower better utilises lower fertilizer doses than higher fertilizer doses. In field trial conducted on meadow soil N induced only low increase of the grain yield and oil yield, at the same time it decreased the oil content (Harmati, 1993). Examining the influence of increasing N doses Angelova (2001) found that between 60-120 kg ha-1 doses the yield increase is only in weak correlation with the increase of N active agent content. According to Pepó and Szabó (2005), Simic et al. (2008) the increase of fertilizer doses entails the increased emergence of pest. Materials and methods The experiments were conducted on the Látókép Research Site of the University of Debrecen Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering between 1999 and 2008. The soil of the research site is calcerous chernozem with good nutrient supplying capacity,</p><p id="Pg15">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The harvested yields were calculated to 8% moisture content. Results and discussion In 1999 no significant difference was found among the natural capability for nutrient uptake of the hybrids, which was probably due to the good nutrient supplying capability and water management of the soil. The control yield representing the natural capability for nutrient uptake was ranging between 3300-3600 kg ha -1 . Without fertilization hybrid Alexandra gave the highest yield. This year the yield increasing effect of fertilization was significant, which is represented by the rise of the curve. The yield increase caused by fertilization exceeded 1000 kg ha -1 by hybrid Arena, which means that the hybrid had good fertilizer response that year. The yield maximum was obtained at 90 kg ha -1 N+PK dose, however, the fertilizer response curve of Pixel is distinct, decreasing from N30+PK dose. Good water management resulted in good fertilizer utilization. It could have been the reason for the smaller difference between the fertilizer response of the hybrids and the hybrid specific fertilizer requirements in 1999 (Figure 1). 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 Kontroll N30+PK N60+PK N90+PK N120+PK N150+PK treatments Y ie ld ( k g h a1 ) Pixel Alexandra Opera Arena Figure 1.

However, the fertilizer response curve of Pixel was distinct and decreased from N30+PK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) fertilizer dose. In the crop year of 2000 the control hybrids were significantly different. From among the hybrids, the fertilizer response curve of Alexandra and Arena PR reached the highest yield-level, however, the response on increasing fertilizer doses was much lower in 2000 than in the previous year. In 2001, the yield surplus attained with fertilization exceeded 1200 kg ha -1 , the average yield increase was 910 kg ha -1 . In 2008 at N30+PK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) dose each hybrid reached the maximum yield. To summarize the results of the four years, we can conclude that on chernozem soil in different years the nitrogen dose belonging to the yield maximum changes in the range of 30 to 90 kg ha -1 (+PK) depending upon the hybrid, higher fertilizer dose was applied in drier years.

Budapest, Villányi út 29-43., e-mail: kornel.szalay@gmail.com 2 Crop Production Institute, Szent István University, Gödöllı 3 Secretariat of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Abstract: Alföld 90 winter wheat variety was studied in agronomic replicated block treatments representing organic and conventional plant nutrition. Organic versions have not recieved any mineral fertilisers, while conventional blocks were supplied with identical 80 kg/ha N amounts in form of ammonium nitrate. Both variants have been simultaneously treated with foliar fertiliser substances. Treated and untreated plots were evaluated concerning plant height (cm), leaf area (cm2), ear size (cm), yield (kg/plot), germination (%), and quality parametres – farinographic value, wet gluten content (%), protein (%). The preliminary results suggest, that wheat crop performance was influenced by means of plant nutrition. Most of the parametres studied had minor alterations only, however plant height, and ear size had consequent alterations of various levels of significance. As a consequence it can be stated, that lack of nutrients should be considered as abiotic stressor to crop plants. The magnitude and the mechanism of the influencing effects need to be cleared in further experiments Keywords winter wheat, organic farming, foliar fertilizer, nitrogen ferilizer, yield, quality Introduction Enviromental aspects and an ascending demand towards healthy alimentation became more and more important in developed countries. People exposed to various stresses that are related to the food they consume. Food should not be only healthy for them, but the way of production of that must be healthy for the environment as well (Bingham et al. 1985; Várallyay, 2004). These needs combine in the system of organic farming, where an enviromentally sound technolgy is used to produce food without any synthetic residues. These are called „ecological” or „organic” food (Roszík, Kovács, 2006). This system has strict regulations, that do not permit the use of chemical fertilizers, as well as using synthetic subtances in plant protection. Without these treatments, with the application of those natural based nutrition and plant protection, the purpose is to produce not quantitative, but qualitative food. In the conditions of the organic farming the magnitude of the capability of resistance and the adaptibility of the species increase, because in the organic way there is less possibility to support and defend the plant than in a conventional way. Consequently the practical way is to start the plant improvement under organic conditions to breed species for ecological farming specifically. The organic way of breeding started with the most of the important horticultural and agricultural plants, but to breed new species and introduce them in the organic farming further years are needed (Roszík, Kovács, 2006). At the moment the possibility is to choose varieties from conventional species according to their adaptive abilities to the organic conditions. In the following trial we have studied the possibilities of growing in organic way a winter wheat variety Alföld 90, that is widely used in conventional systems, too.</p><p id="Pg19">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 22 Matherials and methods Alföld 90 plots were sown on chernozem soil (calciustoll) at Hatvan- Nagygombos, (Central Hungary), in the year of 2008. Split-split-plot design with four replications was used. The wheat variety was planted with a row spacing 12 cm at a rate of five million live seeds/ha. Experimental plot size was 1 m wide and 10 m long. In the trial we separated two areas for the different ways of management systems. The first represented the organic farming without fertilizers, while the other represented the conventional farming with 80 kg/ha (36-0-0) ammonium nitrate broadcasted. Futhermore we broadcasted different type of foliar fertilizers to the replicated blocks. Each of them are licensed in the ecological farming too, except one (Folicare), that is permitted in conventional farming only. The following table represents the treatments applied and their codes.

The homogenous experimental area, the extremely rainy weather’s modifiing effect and the low nutrient demand of the Alföld 90 variety can explain the diverse results. According to these values, this winter wheat variety is specifically appropriate for the conditions of organic farming. Nevertheless with a purpose of clearing the connections in nutrition and to rule out the impact of the wheather, further data and continuation of the trial is required (Szalay et al 2007; Szalay et al 2008; Varga et al 2007).

The main task, from a breeding point of view, is the development of genotypes with better adaptability to environment conditions and soil properties. Irrespective of weather the hybrids are developed via conventional or biotechnological means, it is these traits that determine whether the new genotype prove satisfactory in commercial cultivation. To define the main stress factors in our experiment twenty-two maize hybrids developed from doubled haploid inbred lines were tested at three locations (Martonvásár: in loamy chernozem soil, Szarvas: in clay-loam chernozem, Mezıkövesd: in clay-loam meadow soil) in three years (2006: wet; 2007: dry; 2008: changeable). For the majority of the maize hybrids in the present multilocation trials, the yields achieved did not satisfy breeding criteria. Nevertheless, it proved possible to identify one hybrid combination whose performance was on par with that of commercial hybrids, despite the limited number of initial materials, which represented a genetically narrow spectrum. The hybrid combinations tested in the present work were at most equal, but not exceeding the standard mean. The environmental stress factors had different influence for the yield and grain moisture content of the hybrids examined. Keywords: abiotic stress, drought, maize, field performance Introduction Plants are extremely sensitive to changes, and do not generally adapt quickly. Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Abiotic stress factors exerting the most decisive effect on maize yield are soil–plant interaction, quantity and distribution of annual rainfall and temperature during the critical late June–early July period. In years with favourable water supply, maize hybrids have a yield of 8-10 t·ha -1 , while in dry ones it amounts to only 3-4 t·ha -1 (Nagy, 2006). The yield fluctuation can be reduced by ensuring adequate tillage as well as water and nutrient supplies (Nagy, 2007). The main task, from a breeding point of view, is the development of genotypes with better adaptability to environmental conditions and soil properties. Irrespective of whether the hybrids are developed via conventional or biotechnological means, it is these traits that determine whether the new genotype will prove satisfactory in commercial cultivation. This is also true of maize hybrids involving DH parental components, whether they were developed by in vitro tissue culture or in vivo methods. DH lines produced by laboratory methods are utilised for favourable morphological and agronomical traits during several years of per se selection (Barnabás et al., 2005). A number of lines selected in this way were tested for their field performance in the present experiments. Materials and methods Twenty-two maize hybrids compared to standards were tested at three locations (Martonvásár, Szarvas, Mezıkövesd) in three years (2006-2008) in a randomised performance trial (with three replications) on different soil types with varying rainfall</p><p id="Pg23">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 26 supply. The soil types were as follows: loamy chernozem with lime deposits and good water supplies (Martonvásár), clay-loam chernozem (Szarvas) and clay-loam meadow soil subject to rapid drying (Mezıkövesd). Ten DH lines were developed via in vitro plant regeneration from microspores (Spitkó et al., 2006). At their origin lies an exotic Chinese line with good DH induction ability and Iodent-type Martonvásár inbred lines with commercial value. The DH lines were developed in such a way that the commercial lines were present in various ratios (F1 and BC1 combinations). The testers were Martonvásár sister line crosses (SLC) of Iodent (ISLC), Lancaster (LSLC) and Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (ISSLC) origin, together with a fourth SLC tester not related to any of the above (NRSLC). FAO 390 and FAO 450 standards were included in the experiment. The traits evaluated included grain yield (t·ha -1 ) and grain moisture at harvest (%). Yield data were converted to 15% grain moisture content and subjected to three-way (genotype, year and location) analysis of variance (Sváb, 1981). Results and discussion In present study three-locational data collected over three years were compared to the standard yields (Table 1). The grand mean of yield (8.89 t·ha -1 ) was significantly lower than the standard mean (9.78 t·ha -1 ), but one combination (DH56×NRSLC: 9.94 t·ha -1 ) was found which did not differ significantly (LSD5%=0.30 t·ha -1 ) from the mean of the commercial hybrids. The yield of this genotype was comparable to the standard mean in both years at all locations (2006: 11.13 t·ha -1 vs. standard mean: 11.46 t·ha -1 ; 2007: 7.77 t·ha -1 vs. standard mean: 7.98 t·ha -1 ). However, this yield was coupled with a mean grain moisture content at harvest of 20,11%, which was significantly higher than the standard mean: 18.49 % (LSD5%=0.51 %, the grand mean for the moisture was 19.61 %).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 27 Hybrids with DH parental components were more similar to the FAO 450 standard, having a longer vegetation period and higher grain moisture content at harvest, but in most cases grain yield did not come up to expectations. With respect to hectolitre mass, the standard mean and the grand mean did not differ significantly, indicating that most of the combinations satisfied the 71 kg·hl -1 requirement (data not shown). However, hectolitre mass is a relative index, which does not reflect the real value of a hybrid combination. Almost two-thirds of the genotypes tested had values higher than the limit, whereas one of the standards did not satisfy this criterion in either year (FAO 450: 69.48 kg·hl -1 ), confirming that hybrids giving outstanding general performance in previous years may also have low hectolitre masses. The differences in yield and grain moisture at harvest over years and locations are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Yield and moisture differences between years and soil types (LSD5%: 0.09 for yield; LSD5%:0.18 for moisture) The yield in 2006 and 2008, which were favourable for maize production, were more than half more than that achieved in 2007. The considerable differences in mean summer temperature and rainfall in the three years (data not shown) resulted in substantial yield variations. The rapid drying down of the plants and the rainfall deficiency in 2007 led to faster withering, so the grain moisture at harvest was lower in the second year. The heat wave, with temperatures of 40-42°C for several consecutive days, experienced during maize flowering in 2007 had a negative effect on pollen production and on their viability. The pollen production of inbred maize lines is greatly influenced by the genotype and year (Rácz et al., 2006). This suggests that yield losses in 2007 were due not only to the drying out of the soil, but to an even greater extent by the atmospheric drought at flowering. The effect of the location (soil) on the yield and moisture content is demonstrated in the last three pairs of columns of Figure 1. The better seed setting and higher yield averages achieved on the moderately heavy chernozem soils at the excellent maize-growing locations in Martonvásár and Szarvas could be attributed in part to their good water management. The rapid drying out of the otherwise high-quality meadow alluvial soil in Mezıkövesd resulted in yield losses of 25-30% for the given combinations.</p><p id="Pg25">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 28 Conclusions The environmental stress factors have different influence for the yield, grain quality and moisture content of the hybrids. For instance, more starch is incorporated at wetter locations (higher yield), while the protein and oil content is significantly lower (Hegyi et al., 2007). The results suggested that the differing water retention traits of loam and clay soils are of particular importance when weather conditions are unfavourable for maize production. From the point of view of breeding, combinations found in performance trials at multiple locations to have excellent yield stability can be recommended for general cultivation. The interactions between these two factors, together with the joint resultant of the year will determine the actual maize yield average that can be achieved in a given year. For the majority of the maize hybrids examined in the present multilocation trials, all of which had DH parental components, the yields achieved did not satisfy breeding criteria. Nevertheless, it proved possible to identify one hybrid combination whose performance was on par with that of commercial hybrids, despite the limited number of initial materials, which represented a genetically narrow spectrum. This result is significant not because the given combination outyielded the standard (from this point of view none of the hybrids would be granted registration), but because of the origin of the lines. The DH lines used in the combinations not only had satisfactory combining ability, but also retained the haploid induction ability of the Chinese partner suggesting that they could be used for the development of in vitro DH lines with real commercial value. The DH hybrid combinations tested in the present work were at most equal, but not exceeding the standard mean, but if the studies are extended to include a wider range of genetic sources, the in vitro DH technique could be utilised for the purposes of hybrid development.

ON CHERNOZEM SOIL Peter PEPÓ Institute of Crop Sciences, Agronomy Faculty, University of Debrecen, H-4032 Debrecen, Böszörményi str. 138. e-mail: pepopeter@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The effects of different water supply cropyears (2007 year=dry, with water stress; 2008 year=optimum water supply) on the yields and agronomic traits of wheat in different crop models (crop rotation, fertilization, irrigation) were studied. In non-irrigated treatment the maximum yields of winter wheat were 5590 kg ha-1 in biculture (maize-wheat) and 7279 kg ha-1 in triculture (peas-wheat-maize) in 2007 year characterized by water-deficit stress. In 2008 (optimum rain amount and distribution) the maximum yields were 7065 kg ha-1 (biculture) and 8112 kg ha-1 (triculture) in non irrigated conditions. In water –deficit stress cropyear (2007 year) the yield-surpluses of wheat were 2245 kg ha-1 (biculture) and 1213 kg ha-1 (triculture), respectively. The nutrient utilization of wheat was modified by abiotic (water) and biotic (leaf – and stem – diseases) stress. The fertilization surpluses of wheat were 2853-3698 kg ha-1 (non- irrigated) and 3164-5505 kg ha-1 (irrigated) in a dry cropyear (2007) and 884-4050 kg ha-1 (non-irrigated) and 524-3990 kg ha-1 (irrigated) in an optimum cropyear (2008). The optimum fertilizer doses varied N150-200+PK in biculture and N50-150+PK in triculture depending on cropyear and irrigation. The abiotic stress (water deficit) influenced the agronomic traits (diseases, lodging) of winter wheat. The optimalization of agrotechnical elements provides 7,8-8,5 t ha-1 yields in dry cropyear and 7,1-8,1 t ha-1 yields of wheat in good cropyear, respectively. Keywords: winter wheat, abiotic stress, agronomic traits, yields Introduction In wheat production, yield quantity and the different agronomic traits are equally determined by ecologic (weather, soil), biological (genotype) and agrotechnical (crop rotation, nutrient supply, water supply, plant protection) factors. From these factors the abiotic (weather, nutrient- and water-supply) and biotic (diseases, pests, weeds) are especially important. According to SZÁSZ (2002) the frequency of dry cropyears increased from 22,5 % to 52,6 % in Hungary in the last 150 years. The results of OLSEN and BINDI (2002), BIRKÁS et al. (2006), VÁRALLYAY (2007), BALOGH and PEPÓ (2008) showed that as a result of global climate change the yield of crops have dropped and yield fluctuation has increased. To a certain extent, the unfavourable abiotic stress effects (weather) can be reduced by appropriate variety selection and optimum use of agrotechnical factors. Among agrotechnical elements the optimum nutrient- and water supply (JOLÁNKAI 1982, PEPÓ 2002a, FOWLER 2003, PEPÓ 2007) and crop rotation (HORNOK 2008) have outstandingly high importance. Materials and methods Our long-term experiment was set up in 1983 on chernozem soil on the Látókép Research Station of the University of Debrecen in the Hajdúság region (Eastern Hungary). The following factors were examined in the long-term experiment: - crop rotation: biculture (maize, wheat), triculture (pea-wheat-maize) - fertilization: control, N = 50 kg ha-1 P2O5 = 35 kg ha -1 , K2O = 40 kg ha -1 , and 2-3-4 folds of this dose - irrigation: irrigated and non irrigated (2007 = 100 mm; 2008 = 0 mm) treatments</p><p id="Pg27">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Compared to the many-year average, the weather in 2007 was warm, dry and specifically draughty, while in 2008 it was nearly optimal for wheat production (Table 1). Table 1.

The dry cropyear of 2007 had unfavourable effect on the vegetative and generative growth and yield formation of winter wheat. The stress caused by the unfavourable dry cropyear could significantly be decreased by optimal use of agrotechnical factors. In the dry cropyear of 2007 among agrotechnical factors the irrigation, fertilization and crop rotation had significant influence on the yields of wheat. In 2007 the yields of wheat ranged between 1892-5590 kg ha -1 (non-irrigated) and between 2330-7835 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in biculture, and between 4426-7279 kg ha -1 (non-irrigated) and 5328-8492 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in triculture, respectively.

In 2007 in the control treatment (abiotic stress caused by nutrient deficiency) the yield increase generated by irrigation was moderate and ranged between 438 kg ha -1 (biculture) and 902 kg ha -1 (triculture). Contrary, in the optimal NPK treatment the yield increase by irrigation was significantly higher. The yield increase caused by irrigation was 2630 kg ha -1 in biculture (after maize forecrop which had higher water uptake) and 1579 kg ha -1 in triculture (after pea forecrop that has lower demand for water). 438 902 2630 1579 122-123 -183 -238 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 B ic u lt u re T ri cu lt u re B ic u lt u re T ri cu lt u re B ic u lt u re T ri cu lt u re B ic u lt u re T ri cu lt u re Ø Nopt+PK Ø Nopt+PK Y ie ld s u rp lu s k g h a1 2007. year 2008 year Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 32 kg ha -1 in irrigated treatment, respectively. In 2008 irrigation was not applied, so the crop rotation determined the yield increase caused by fertilization. This year the yield increase caused by fertilization was 4050 kg ha -1 (non-irrigated) and 3990 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in biculture and 884 kg ha -1 (non-irrigated) and 524 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in triculture, respectively. Conclusions The effect of cropyear as abiotic stress on winter wheat was studied on chernozem soil in long-term experiment in 2007 and 2008. In dry year (2007) in non-irrigated circumstances the maximum yields of winter wheat were 5590 kg ha -1 in biculture, 7279 kg ha -1 in triculture, while in the cropyear with favourable water supply (2008) the maximum yields were 900-1500 kg ha -1 higher (7065 kg ha -1 in biculture, 8112 kg ha -1 in triculture). In dry cropyear (2007) in biculture the N150-200+PK and in triculture the N100-150+PK treatments proved to be optimal, while in the cropyear with favourable water supply the N150+PK (biculture) and N50+PK fertilization treatments proved to be optimal, respectively. Our long-term experiments proved that by harmonizing the optimal agrotechnical factors (irrigation, crop rotation, fertilization) even in unfavourable, dry cropyears (abiotic stress effect) similar yield can be obtained (8500 kg ha -1 in triculture, with irrigation in the N100+PK treatment) as in the cropyear with favourable water supply (8100 kg ha -1 in triculture, with no irrigation in the N50+PK treatment). The negative effects of unfavourable cropyear, the aboitic stress can be reduced and even eliminated however it needs extremely intensive agrotechnical management and high inputs.

Three treatments - a 125 mg N/l and a 250 mg N/l basal application level, and a 125 mg N/l level complemented by four sidedressings to 250 mg N/l – were carried out either using a CRF, or a readily available fertilizer (RAF). Activity of guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase were measured from the roots and the youngest leaves three times during the raising period. Salt levels of the pot mixtures were higher in the RAF treatments than in their corresponding CRF treatments during the first half of the experiment. The activity of ascorbate peroxidase showed the strongest correlation with the salt level, especially at the time of the first measurement. According to the dry weight data the sometimes two-fold differences in the salt level did not have a growth reducing stress effect on cucumber transplants. Keywords: salt level of pot mixture, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase Introduction Due to their polymer coating, by the application of controlled release fertilizers (CRFs) a low but continuous nutrient level can be maintained (Trenkel, 1999). This is a very important characteristic for the production of the usually very salt sensitive transplants of vegetable plants. That is why CRFs are extensively used for raising seedlings. The salt level of the pot mixture can be a deciding factor especially when seeds are sown directly into the pot mixture, as it is the case with cucumber (Slezák et al., 2000). Stress factors, such as high salt level, can result in the formation of active oxygen forms which reduce productivity of the crops (Sairam &amp; Tyagi, 2004). In the plants the main pathway for the neutralization of these compounds is the ascorbic acid – glutathione cycle (Szepesi et al., 2008). By the monitoring of the so called stress enzymes of this cycle the extent of the stress and the ability of stress tolerance of the plant can be characterized (Eshdat et al., 1997; Bouazizi et al., 2007). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CRF application on the activity of three stress enzymes in the roots and leaves of cucumber transplants. Materials and methods Seeds of cucumber (cv. Gredos) were sown into plastic pots on July28 th . Type and amount of fertilizer mixed into the pot mixture were the changing factors. Beside a zero control three treatments were applied either with a 14:16:18 analysis readily available fertilizer (RAF) and with a CRF (12:11:17). The three treatments were as follows: a 125 mg N l -1 and a 250 mg N l -1 basal application level, and a 125 mg N l -1 level complemented by four sidedressings to 250 mg N l -1 . Treatments were replicated three times, one replication consisted of 36 pots. Progress of the salt level of the pot mixtures was monitored by measuring the ionic activity with a PET 2000 Kombi device (Stelzner GmbH, Bad Klosterlausnitz,</p><p id="Pg31">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 34 Germany) four times during the experiments. The unitless so called AM value given by this instrument was found to correlate very closely to the EC of the pot mixture solution (Ombódi et al., 2003). Activities of guaiacol peroxidase (Chance &amp; Maehly, 1955), ascorbate peroxidase (Nakano &amp; Asada, 1981) and glutathione reductase (Smith et al., 1988) were measured from cell-free tissue extracts prepared from the roots and the youngest leaves sampled three times (9, 15 and 21 days after sowing) during the raising period. The experiment was finished 20 days after sowing, and dry weight of the transplants was measured. Results and discussion As the RAF releases its total nutrient content almost immediately after mixing it into the pot mixture, during the first half of the experiment salt levels were significantly higher in the RAF treatments than in their corresponding CRF treatments (Table 1.). As application of sidedressings started at 13 days after sowing, it could not have any effect at the first two measurement times. Later during the experiment just the amount of the fertilizer had an effect on the AM value, the fertilizer type did not. Table 1.

The highest activities were observed for guaiacol peroxidase in the roots at the first measurement time, and for the ascorbate peroxidase in the shoots at the end of the experiment. Raise in guaiacol peroxidase activity is a general stress response. Athough there are some similarities between the tendency of AM values and guaiacol peroxides activities measured at 8 days after sowing, we did not find statistically significant correltion between these two parameters. The activity of ascorbate peroxidase showed the strongest correlation with the salt level of the pot mixtures, especially at 8 days after sowing (Figure 2.). Ascorbate peroxidase activity values were significantly lower in the CRF treatments than in the RAF treatments during the whole experiment. Activity of glutathione reductase did not show any response to the treatments. According to the dry weight data the RAF treatment with sidedressing resulted in the most developed transplants (Table 2.). This was due to the higher shoot dry weight in this case, as the treatments did not have statistically significant effect on root dry weight. Also there were no statistically significant differences between the shoot dry weight production of the other five treatments.</p><p id="Pg32">VIII.

It is also significant economical factor in intensive plant production systems and responsible for agriculture related pollution. Cultivars with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) would therefore be interesting for production. It was expected that Maksimir 3 Synthetic (M3S) maize population had genetic variability for NUE, because it was derived from local corn varieties used in low-input production systems. Field trial including 196 maize S1 progenies from third cycle of recurrent selection in M3S maize population was conducted at three locations during the 2007 growing season. Two rates of nitrogen, 0 kg ha-1 and 150 kg ha-1, were applied in order to detect response of the S1 progenies to nitrogen deficiency stress. In the nitrogen stress environment (0 kg N ha-1), yield was reduced significantly 9.09%, ear height 4.13%, and leaf length and width 2.36% and 4.30 %, respectively. Correlations between yield per plant and plant height were r = 0.46 and r = 0.53 in nitrogen stress and non stress environment, respectively. Between yield and other traits correlations were week and ranged from r = -0.09 to r = 0.32 in both environments. Moderate and positive correlation between yield in the stress and yield in the non stress environment (r = 0.40), indicates that successful identification of nitrogen use efficient genotypes could be done in low nitrogen environments, as suggested for improving NUE by several authors. Keywords: nitrogen stress, maize, recurrent selection, nitrogen use efficiency, NUE Introduction Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients in plant growth and development, which metabolism is complex and interdependent with photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism (Presterl at al., 2002). Excessive and inadequate N application may result in environmental and water pollution through leaching and denitrification (Barić et al., 2007; Vuković et al., 2008; Mesić et al. 2007; Rutkoviene et al. 2007). It also increases the crop plant production costs (Raun and Johnson, 1999). Cultivars with high nitrogen use efficiency, NUE, would therefore be interesting for production. In maize, NUE can be defined as grain yield per amount of nitrogen available in the soil (Moll et al., 1982), or as ability of a genotype to realize superior grain yield at low soil nitrogen conditions in comparison with other genotypes (Presterl et al., 2002). Genetic variability for NUE in maize has been reported by several authors (Moll et al., 1982; Kamprath et al., 1982; Moll et al., 1987; Presterl et al., 2002; Varga et al., 2008). Recurrent selection methods were developed to improve the mean performance of genetically broad base populations through gradual increase of the frequency of favourable alleles (Hallauer, 1985). Some of these methods were used to improve NUE in corn (Moll et al., 1982; Kamprath et al., 1982; Moll et al., 1987). S1 recurrent selection is of particular interest to breeders, because it is theoretically expected to be more effective than selection among FS and HS families during earlier cycles of selection (Hallauer, 1992). Objective of this paper was to detect response of 196 S1 maize progenies derived from the third cycle (C3) of recurrent selection in M3S maize population, to nitrogen deficiency stress.</p><p id="Pg35">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 38 Materials and methods Field experiments including 196 S1 maize progenies derived from the third cycle (C3) of recurrent selection in M3S maize population were conducted at three locations in Croatia, Maksimir (sand loam soil), Rugvica (silt loam soil) and Kutjevo (silt loam soil) during the 2007 growing season. Development of M3S maize synthetic population and three cycles of its recurrent selection were described earlier (Šarčević at al., 2004; Sabljo et al. 2008). At each location two experiments were carried out, one with fertilization rate 0 kg N ha -1 , representing nitrogen stress environment and one with 150 kg N ha -1 , representing control environment. All other cultural practices were as recommended for optimum maize production. Each experimental plot was single 12 plant row 2.50 m long. Planting distance was 0.70 m between, and 0.20 m within rows. Morphological traits, plant and ear height, ear leaf length and width were recorded on all plants of each experimental plot after anthesis at Maksimir and Kutjevo. All plots were hand-harvested with gleaning of dropped ears. Yield of shelled grain was expressed as g per plant, adjusted to 14% grain moisture, at all three locations. Combined analysis of variance across locations was performed taking genotypes, fertilizations and locations as fixed effects. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated among all the traits separately for stress and control environment, and between yield under stress and control environment. All computations were performed with SAS Release 8.2 (SAS Institute 1999 – 2001) computer program. Results and discussion Significant differences between nitrogen stress and control environment were found for yield per plant, ear height, leaf length and leaf width (Table 1). Table 1.

Grain yield per</p><p id="Pg36">VIII.

Genotype x nitrogen (G x N) interaction (data not shown) was not significant for any trait, indicating similar genotype response both environments. Genotype x nitrogen interaction is needed for selection of genotypes adapted to specific level of nitrogen. Presterl et al. (2002) selected two out of five best yielding selection hybrids at high nitrogen environment under low nitrogen environment, confirming together with Bänziger et al. (1997) that the amount of G x N interaction is dependent on the dissimilarity of the N levels. Lack of the G x N interaction for grain yield in our study might indicate that M3S population is equally adapted to nitrogen stress as well as to control environment, or that two applied nitrogen levels were not different enough. Severe drought during the 2007 growing season, with low precipitation from March to September (data not shown) presumably affected this trail, and occurrence of G x N interaction. Genotype x nitrogen interaction was not significant for grain yield in Moll et al. (1982), also. Correlations between yield per plant and plant height in our study were r = 0.46 ** and r = 0.53 ** in the nitrogen stress and in the non stress environment, respectively (Table 2). Table 2.

The studied traits varied more with genotype and location than with fertilization rate. Lack of G x N interaction for grain yield in our study might indicate that M3S population is equally adapted to the nitrogen stress, as to the control environment, or that two applied nitrogen levels were not different enough. Highest correlation were found between yield and plant height at both stress and control environment. Drought during the 2007 growing season might have affected results of this trail.

Cropping system intensity had a positive effect in both years on soybean seed yield, seed number and seed weight per plant. In 2007, cropping system intensity had a positive effect also on number of pods per plant. Plant density had no influence on soybean seed yield. The highest pod and seed number and seed weight per plant were achieved at 35 plants m-2. Soybean genotype AF-4 achieved in both years significantly higher seed yield. Abiotic stress (high temperature, smaller amount of precipitation and its less favourable distribution) during the 2007 year had adverse influence on seed weight per plant and 1000 seed weight, which was eventually reflected in lower yield especially of genotype AF-4. Keywords: soybean, genotypes, cropping systems, plant density, yield Introduction A major role in increasing soybean seed yield is that of yield components that determine it. Seed yield is determined by the number of seeds and seed weight, where seed weight is often in negative correlation with seed number (Pedersen and Lauer, 2004). According to Board et al. (2003), seed yield is most strongly influenced by the number of seeds and pods per m 2 . Introduction of new soybean genotypes and improvement of cropping practices are prerequisites for increasing soybean seed yields. Soybean genotypes also differ in the efficiency of biological nitrogen fixation (Sudarić et al., 2008), so introduction of new genotypes into production is associated with determination of the optimal cropping system for achievement of highest yields. Determination of optimal plant density is an essential factor for achievement of high soybean seed yields. Gan et al. (2002) report that plant density had no impact on some yield components, node number per plant and 1000-seed weight; however, an increase in density increased the number of pods and seeds as well as seed yield per unit area in all the genotypes studied. When determining nitrogen fertilizer rates, it should be taken into account that higher nitrogen levels have an adverse effect on its symbiotic fixation, thereby thwarting soybean’s ability to satisfy part of its nitrogen requirements from its symbiotic relationship with Bradyrhizobium japonicum (Kadar et al., 2008). New soybean genotypes accumulate nitrogen more efficiently than old genotypes (Kumudini et al., 2008). Soybean seed yield is also affected by soil tillage (Sabo et al., 2007). Although conservation tillage systems enable higher humus accumulation in soil and reduce CO2 emission into the atmosphere (Birkas, 2007; Bencsik and Ujj, 2008), even conventional deep tillage has its advantages in some cases. Deep tillage has a strong influence on increasing soybean yield in dry years when cost effectiveness of this practice is realized (Wesley et al., 2000).</p><p id="Pg39">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 42 The research objective was to assess the influence of high-input and reduced-input cropping systems and four plant densities on soybean seed yield and yield components of two new soybean genotypes. Materials and methods Investigations were conducted in field trials within the three-year maize-soybean-wheat crop rotation set up at the experimental facility of the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb in 2006 and 2007. Investigations involved two cropping systems and two new soybean genotypes: AF-4 i AF-5, vegetation group 0, sown at four plant densities (35, 45, 55 and 65 plants m -2 ). High-input cropping system had the following characteristics: ploughing at 30-32 cm, fertilization with 30 kg N ha -1 , 80 kg P2O5 ha -1 and 120 kg K2O ha -1 , and the reduced-input cropping system: ploughing at 20-22 cm, fertilization with a total of 15 kg N ha -1 , 40 kg P2O5 ha -1 and 60 kg K2O ha -1 . Trials were laid out according to the strip-plot method with four replications. The trial plot size was 8.1 m 2 . Prior to harvest, ten plants were taken from each plot for the following analyses: plant weight, pod and seed number per plant, seed weight per plant, harvest index, 1000-seed weight. After harvest, soybean seed yield per hectare was determined and expressed at 13% moisture level. Obtained data were processed by the analysis of variance using the MSTAT-C program (Michigan State University, 1990). The trial was set up on eutric cambisol, of acid reaction in the plough layer (pH in 1 M KCl = 5.30). The soil is poorly supplied with humus (2.9%) and well supplied with nitrogen (0.21%), available phosphorus (21.1 mg/100 g soil) and potassium (30.0 mg/100 g soil). Results and discussion Significantly higher soybean seed yields were achieved in both trial years with the highinput cropping system (Tables 1 and 2). High-input cropping system had in 2006 a significant influence on the seed number and weight per plant whereas for other yield components no significant difference was determined between the reduced-input and high-input cropping systems. Significant influence of cropping intensity on all yield components was recorded in 2007. Larger pod and seeds number and higher seed weight per plant were achieved in the high-input system, while higher 1000-seed weight was obtained in the reduced-input system. However, the increase of 1000-seed weight from 114.8 g in the high-input system to 125.1 g in the reduced-input system was not sufficient to compensate for the significantly smaller number and weight of other yield components. Significantly higher harvest index (0.50) was also achieved with low-input cropping in 2007. Wood et al. (1993) increased soybean yield by intensified nitrogen fertilization whereas Varga et al. (1992) point to the small chance of increasing soybean seed yield by applying higher nitrogen rates. In 2006, genotype AF-4 gave significantly higher seed yield (Table 1). Higher yield of genotype AF-4 is a result of its larger number of pods and seeds per plant as well as higher seed weight per plant. In 2007, however, genotype AF-5 produced a significantly larger number of pods and seeds per plant, but genotype AF-4 compensated lower values of other yield components by its significantly higher 1000-seed weight to eventually achieve a significantly higher seed yield compared to AF-5 (Table 2). Genotype AF-5 showed greater tolerance of adverse weather conditions in 2007 until</p><p id="Pg40">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 43 the seed filling stage. During seed filling, however, genotype AF-4 made up for poorer formation of other yield components, which was eventually reflected in the higher yield of this genotype. Pedersen and Lauer (2004) maintain that the ability of a cultivar to compensate certain yield components is more affected by the weather variability of a year than by cropping intensity. Table 1.

HUZSVAI László1– VÁNYINÉ SZÉLES Adrienn1 1University of Debrecen, Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Institute for Land Utilisation, Regional Development and Technology, e-mail: huzsvai@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The impact of irrigation on crop yield is usually described by the yield growth extent. If precipitation supply is average, maize irrigation is ineffective, but it can result in significant yield surplus in drought. Also, there are – rather rare – conditions, in which irrigation causes yield drop. This happened at the latitudinal degree 47°56’ and the longitudinal degree 21°44’ in 2005 and 2006. Many explain the negative impact of irrigation by the lack of air in the soil. We found a different reason for this in our experiment, in which we examined the impact of previous crop, cultivation and fertilisation on maize production. The lack of air in soil cannot be observed in a chernozem soil with good structure. After maize as green croup, yield was lower by 1 t ha-1, whereas was only a 0.34 t ha-1 drop after wheat. The impact of irrigation on maize yield after autumn ploughing was -900 kg ha-1, whereas it was -800 kg ha-1 after disk cultivation and -600 kg ha-1 after spring ploughing. These results cannot be explained by the lack of air, as it would have provided the opposite result. Due to our analyses, the N concentration of the soil solution is determinant. If there is a much N in the soil, water will not dilute the N concentration to a critical extent. Fertiliser treatments supported this hypothesis, as the irrigation-induced yield drop was the highest on non-fertilised plots and the lowest (zero) on plots that with the highest amount of fertiliser. Keywords: water stress, maize, irrigation Introduction As for maize, Hungary belongs to the zone of areas that can be irrigated only under certain conditions. Maize growing is relatively simple in especially dry climate, where natural precipitation does not interfere into the development of irrigation standards. Nevertheless, the case is not that simple in the climate of Hungary. There are crop years, when natural precipitation covers the water need of maize hybrids and there are cases when even natural precipitation proves to be much in itself. The joint effect of the precipitation in May and June significantly exceeding the average level and the higher dose of irrigation could even cause yield depression. A proper irrigation forecast could only be provided on the basis of the irrigation and groundwater conditions of the given plot (Antal 1968; Posgay 1968, 1983; Balogh 1978; Racskó 2005). The regularity of irrigation is also in connection with the yield by means of under- and over-irrigation. Lack of water results in lack of water satisfaction. Over-irrigation also causes yield depression, it can reduce yield under the potential level by leaching nutrients out of the soil, causing airless conditions and increasing liability to diseases (Lelkes, 2001). According to Csajbók (2007), irrigation also has effect on the physicial and chemical characteristics of soil. Deteriorated soil conditions caused by the unfavourable physical and chemical effects can frequently be observed in irrigated areas. Research results also show that yield decrease can occur as a result of irrigation in certain crop years in areas with inadequate nutrient supply, therefore the harmony of nutrient and water supply has to be provided simultaneously (Láng, 1971; Nagy, 1995, 1997, 2006a, 2006b, 2007, 2008; Szalókiné and Szalóki, 2002). Cameira et al. (2003) examined the water and nitrogen balance of soils. The current nutrient management systems do not attach enough importance to the fact that a considerable amount of mineral nitrogen can be produced by the mineralisation of soil in hydromorphic soils until sowing. It can lead to a serious nitrogen accumulation until harvest and nitrogen can easily be leached out</p><p id="Pg43">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 46 from the root zone during the wet months of the autumn and winter. As for sandy soils, nitrate leaching takes place owing to ineffective irrigation farming in the growth season. Based on research carried out in Ohio, Hardjoamidjojov et al. (1982) proved that the yield of maize hybrids is in close correlation with the stress sensitivity of cultivars. Széll (1984) also stated that the yield stability of outstanding hybrids prevails only above an adequate treshold value of degree of water supply. Materials and methods We carried out our research in the Látókép Experiment Site of the Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering of the University of Debrecen on chernozem soil with lime deposits (latitudinal degree: 47°56’, longitudinal degree: 21°44’). The experiment started in 1999 and has been going on in its unchanged form ever since. In this research, we have the opportunity to examine the effect of the most important agrotechnical factors influencing maize yield: irrigation, preceding crop, cultivation and fertilisation, as well as their interactions. The preceding crop was winter wheat and maize, the applied cultivation method was autumn ploughing, spring ploughing and disk cultivation, the fertilisation treatments were: N_0: non-fertilised, N_120: 120 kg ha -1 N; 90 kg ha -1 P2O5; 106 kg ha -1 K2O, N_240:240 kg ha -1 N; 180 kg ha -1 P2O5; 212 kg ha 1 K2O. We used a general linear model to examine the effect of treatments on yield. In this study, we present the effect of irrigation in 2005 and the interactions of other factors modifying it. Results and discussion We can come across studies about yield depression caused by excessive water supply rather infrequently in the respective technical literature. Nevertheless, many researchers mention that maize can only be irrigated under certain conditions in Hungary, therefore yields increase only in years when there is a lack of water. Excessive water supply causes yield drop through the airless conditions in soil, the leaching of nutrients, the inadequate nutrient supply, the unfavourable physical and chemical soil characteristics. During our examinations, we tried to rank and quantify the reasons (Figure 1). Airless conditions in the soil do not cause yield depression in chernozem soils with good structure and good water management. After winter wheat as a preceding crop, the residual water in soil is always more than it is in the case if maize is the preceding crop. Therefore, in the case of excessive water supply, if anaerobic soil conditions were to develop, it would be reasonable to observe a bigger yield drop here, yet the case was the opposite. After winter wheat, more easily accessible nitrogen can be found in the soil and this is the reason why yield depression is lower in the case of excessive water supply than it is after maize. The nitrogen content of soil is crucial, that is clearly proven by fertilisation treatments. Plots that have not been fertilised for 15 years show the greatest yield drop as result of irrigation. It is higher after maize (nearly 2 t ha -1 ), and it is lower after winter wheat (1 t ha -1 ). Yield depression is smaller on fertilised plots and it becomes smaller and smaller as fertiliser doses are increased. Practically, no yield drop can be observed after fertilised winter wheat. Cultivation modifies this correlation to a small extent. In the case of maize grown in monoculture, autumn ploughing is the most advantageous (-0.757 t ha -1 ), causing the smallest yield depression and providing the most favourable conditions for nitrification, the production of mineral</p><p id="Pg44">VIII.

As for maize grown after winter wheat, autumn ploughing (-0.256 t ha -1 ) and disk cultivation (0.223 t ha -1 ) are nearly the same, the results are the same within a margin of error. There is not a huge difference between cultivation forms after a good preceding crop.

The effect of irrigation on maize yield, Debrecen, 2005 In a long-term experiment, both treatments and yields of previous years influence the yield of a given year. The volumes of biomass in previous years determine the volume of removed nutrients. Table 1 shows the fertiliser-nutrient balance of the period before 2005 (1990-2004) in maize monoculture. The greatest ”deficiency” can be observed on non-fertilised, irrigated plots. This ”deficiency” amounts to 140-170 kg ha -1 nitrogen annually. This amount was provided for maize by chernozem soil.

Cereal Research Communications 48 Conclusions Even in the Hungarian climate that tends to be dry, conditions where excessive water supply causes yield drop can develop. The water content of soil greatly influences the easily accessible nutrient forms, therefore the degree of water supply of maize can only by adequately judged on the basis of the degree of nutrient supply. Professional irrigation can only be carried out if soil characteristics – primarily its water and nutrient management features – are taken into consideration. In the long term, irrigation can increase maize yield only if adequate nutrient supply is provided. In our experiment, we observed such an extent of nutrient deficiency on irrigated, non-fertilised plots after 15 years that causes a yield drop if the degree of precipitation supply is bigger than average.

Without P fertilisation the AL-P2O5 content of the ploughed layer showed virtually no decrease over the course of the 16-year experiment cycle. The annual application of 100 kg·ha-1 P2O5 fertiliser gradually increased the readily available P reserves of the soil, giving a positive P balance. Replenishment P fertilisation resulted in a large positive P balance and substancial amount of P chemical degradation. Keywords: P turnover, P balance, fertilisation, long-term experiment Introduction Between 1971 and 1989 the P balance of Hungarian soils was strongly positive, contributing to the fact that around 70 % of the agriculturally utilised soils were classified as having good or very good P-supplying ability by the end of the eighties. Over the last two decades, however, there has been a drastic decline in P fertiliser application, which has dropped to below 10 kg ha -1 active agents on cultivated areas. The farm practice with respect to P fertilisation over the last 20 years raises a number of questions, such as: how long can under fertilisation with P continue before the stress induced by P deficiency results in significant yield reductions and quality deterioration; to what extent have the P supplies in Hungarian soils declined; what level of fertilisation is required on soils with poor P-supplying capacity to bring this capacity up to at least the medium category; what proportion of the P fertiliser applied at longer intervals is subject to chemical degradation (Kádár and Csathó 1991, Kádár 1997, 2006, 2008, Füleky 1998, 2006, Németh 1998, Izsáki and Iványi 2002, Izsáki 2007, Kádár and Márton 2007). Long-term mineral fertilisation experiments, such as those set up on chernozem meadow soil in Szarvas in 1989, provide a basis for answering these questions. Materials and methods Long-term mineral fertilisation experiments were set up at the Experimental Station of the Crop Production Department in 1989 on chernozem meadow soil. The soil of the experimental area had the following parameters in 1989: pH(KCl) 5.0-5.2, calcareous in the deeper layers, humus content 3.0-3.2 %, 85-100 cm humus layer, upper limit of plasticity according to Arany (KA) 50, clay content 32 %, AL-P2O5 156 mg·kg -1 . Fertilisation was carried out in all possible combinations of four levels each of N, P and K, giving a total of 64 treatments, set up in a split-split plot design with three replications, with K fertilisation as the “A” factor, P fertilisation as the “B” factor and N fertilisation as the “C” factor. The following P fertiliser rates (P2O5) were applied: P0=0;</p><p id="Pg47">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 50 P1=100 kg·ha -1 ·year -1 ; P2=500 kg·ha -1 in 1989, 1993 and 2001; P3=1000 kg·ha -1 in 1989, 1993 and 2001. In each year of the experiment four crops were included in the crop rotation on 4x192 plots. The P uptake of the crops were determined at harvesting time. The soil P content was determined with the AL(0.1 M NH4-lactate + 0.4 M acetic acid) method. Results and discussion Changes in the parameters characteristic of the P-supplying capacity and P supply levels of the soil in response to P fertilisation are illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 1.

It is a sign of the considerable P reserves and good P-supplying capacity of the soil that even without fertilisation, the crops extracted 830 kg P2O5 ha -1 in the course of the experimental cycle, with no real decrease in the P supplies of the soil. The application of 100 kg ha -1 P2O5 a year led to a gradual increase in the readily available P supplies in the soil and by the end of the 16-year experimental cycle the supply level had increased by approximately 70 mg kg -1 AL-P2O5 compared with the control. The P balance of the ploughed layer was +645 kg ha -1 . The data showed that an increase of 100 kg ha -1 in the P balance resulted in a rise of roughly 10 mg kg -1 in the AL-soluble P content of the ploughed layer. Of the 1600 kg ha -1 P2O5 active agents applied in the course of 16 years, 16 % could be detected in AL-soluble form at the end of the experimental period. In the case of replenishment fertilisation at a rate of 3x500 kg P2O5 ha -1 , the AL-P2O5 value of the ploughed layer exceeded the control level by 36 mg kg -1 at the end of the 16 th year. The first replenishment with 500 kg ha -1 P fertiliser resulted in an increase of 86 mg kg -1 in the soil AL-P2O5 value compared with the control, indicating that 58 kg ha -1 P2O5 active agents was required to increase the soil AL-P2O5 content by 10 mg kg -1 . In the year following the first replenishment fertilisation 67 % of the fertiliser P could be detected in AL-P2O5 form, but this value declined in subsequent years. Of the 1500 kg ha -1 P2O5 applied over the 16 years the plants extracted 972 kg, and at the end of the 16 th year the P-balance was +528 kg ha -1 , while 9 % of the fertiliser P was in AL-soluble form.

Conclusions On a chernozem meadow soil with good P reserves, where the AL-P2O5 content is 130150 mg kg -1 , P exhaustion is a slow process; the readily available AL-P content hardly changed over a period of 16 years. An increase of 100 kg ha -1 in the P balance raised the AL-P2O5 content of the ploughed layer by 7-10 mg kg -1 . The periodic application of higher rates of P fertiliser led to a greater proportion of the P being chemically degraded.

In the 1970s and 1980s, we were in the frontline regarding yields and genetic advancement. However, yield fluctuation in maize has increased to 50-60% from 10-20% since the 1980s, which was partly caused by the increase in weather extremes due to climate change and by agrotechnical shortcomings. The experiments were carried out on typical meadow soil in four repetitions in the period of 2007-2008. In the sowing time experiment, sowing was performed on 10 April, 25 April, 15 May under a uniform fertilization of N120, P2O580 K2O 110 kg/ha. In the fertilization experiment, the yielding capacity of 10 hybrids with different genetic characteristics was studied in a control (non-fertilized) treatment and basic treatment of N40 P2O5 25, K2O 30 kg ha -1 active ingredient and a treatment with fivefold dosages of the basic treatment. In the plant density experiment, the relationship between plant density and yield was analysed at plant densities of 45, 60 and 75 thousand plants per ha. We found a tight correlation between sowing time and yield and grain moisture content at harvest. We found that grain moisture can be reduced by 5-10% by applying an earlier sowing time. The agroecological optimum fertilizer dosage was N 40-120, P2O5 25-75, K2O 30-90 kg ha -1 active ingredient at a plant density of 60-90 thousand plants ha-1 depending on the hybrid and the year. Keywords: maize, yield, fertilization, plant density, sowing date. Introduction According to Berzsenyi and Gyırffy (1997), the aim of crop production has been the maximalization of growth rate and plant biomass production for several decades. N supply has the greatest influence on the amount of yield, Bocz (1976). The N content of soils is an important factor in soil fertility (Nyíri, (1993). However, excess N results in yield reduction and harmful nitrogen accumulation (Németh and Kádár, 1999). According to the results of Nagy (1997), the natural nutrient exploration ability should be taken into consideration besides the fertilizer response. Fertilization has a significant effect on the ratio of grain and other plant parts (Nagy, 1978). For environmental considerations, it is important to adjust the fertilization to the requirements of the crop, to the dynamics of nutrient uptake and the growing site conditions (Várallyay and Németh, 1996; Németh, 2001). With an early sowing time, the grain moisture content at harvest can be considerably reduced (Árendás, 2000). Very early and early hybrids have a wider optimal sowing time interval than hybrids with longer vegetation periods (Sárvári, 2005). The optimum plant density of maize hybrids depends not only on the length of the variety’s vegetation period but also on the genotype (Nagy, 2000). According to Pepó et al. (2002), the efficacy of maize production can only be improved via a hybrid-specific plant density adapted to the growing site and the agronomical conditions.</p><p id="Pg51">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The organic matter content of the meadow soil was 4.2 % and the groundwater level was 2-2.5 m. The soil could be characterized by high clay content and poor phosphorus and medium potassium contents. Weather varied greatly among the experimental years. 2007 was a dry year, the amount of precipitation in the vegetation period of maize was 303.2 mm and 355.6 mm in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The 30-year average of precipitation (April-September) was 345.1 mm. The amount of precipitation was 41.9 mm lower and 14.1 mm higher in 2007 and 2008, respectively, than the average of 30 years. The monthly mean temperatures in the vegetation period of maize were 1.96 o C and 0.6 o C higher in 2007 and 2008, respectively, than the average of many years.

The fertilizer rates (active ingredient kg ha -1 ) applied in the fertilization experiments were N 40, P2O5 25, K2O 30 kg ha -1 as a basic dose while the highest dose was fivefold the basic dose. In the sowing time experiment, sowing was performed on 10 April, 25 April, 15 May. In the plant density experiment, the relationship between plant density and yield was analysed at plant densities of 45, 60, and 75 thousand plants ha -1 . The results were evaluated by analysis of variance and parabolic regression analysis. Results and discussion Weather in 2007 was unfavourable for maize. Plant density and NPK fertilization greatly determined the yield of maize hybrids. Without fertilization, the yield was 3.685.19 t/ha. The lowest fertilizer dosage of N 40, P2O5 25, K2O 30 kg ha -1 increased the yield by 2-3 t ha -1 . The optimum fertilizer dosage was N 120, P2O5 75, K2O 90 kg ha -1 .

The effect of fertilization on yield of maize maize hybrids in the average of the fertilizer treatments (fertilizer levels 1-5, without control treatment) In 2008, the correlation between fertilization and yield was very tight. The lowest fertilizer dosage of N 40, P2O5 25, K2O 30 kg ha -1 increased the yield by 3-5 t ha -1 as compared to the control (non-fertilized) plot, while there were only slight differences among the different fertilizer dosages, the cause of which was the significant mineralization of organic materials due to the favourable year. The yield of the hybrids PR38A79 and PR38R37 was above 6 t ha -1 even without fertilization. The best fertilizer responses were obtained for hybrids PR37K92 and PR36Y23 (Figure 3). Plant density greatly increased yield. The highest yields of hybrids were achieved at the plant density of 75 thousand plants ha -1 . In 2007, the highest yield was obtained for the second sowing time (25 April) for the hybrid PR38A79, while all the other hybrids reached the maximum yield at the first sowing time (10 April). The yield of hybrids ranged between 5.5 and 9.0 t ha -1 depending on the sowing time. In 2008, the yield of hybrids ranged between 11 and 14 t ha -1 depending on the sowing time due to the favourable year. The hybrids had a higher yield when the first sowing time (10 April) was applied (Figure 4). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 PR38B12 PR38A79 PR38V45 PR37N54 PR37N01 PR37Y12 PR35F38 03. Apr. 24. Apr. 15.

Cereal Research Communications 56 Sowing time also determined the grain moisture content at harvest. Depending on the hybrid and sowing time, the grain moisture content at harvest in 2007 varied between 11.07 and 13.70 % (average: 12.39 %), 11.33 and 24.60 % (average 17.97 %) and 21.73 and 32.60 % (average 27.17 %) for the first, second and third sowing time, respectively. In 2008, it was 11.93-17.87 (average 14.90 %), 13.33-20.60 % (average 16.97 %), 15.07-27.07 % (average 21.07 %) for the first, second and third sowing time, respectively. It can be concluded that the grain moisture content can be reduced by 3-5 % and 5-10 % when applying the first sowing time as compared to sowing on 25 April and 15 May, respectively. N fertilization increased the protein content of maize hybrids by 0.5-1.0 %, a higher plant density reduced the protein content and slightly increased the starch content of the grains. Conclusions It can be concluded that the optimum NPK fertilizer dosages of the studied hybrids are N 40-120, P2O5 25-75, K2O 30-90 kg/ha active ingredient depending on the hybrid and the year. Plant density is a major determining factor of yield. Maize hybrids gave the highest yield at the plant density of 75 thousand plants ha -1 . With increasing plant density, the individual yield (cob size) was reduced, but the yield per unit area (ha) increased. The yield was higher while the grain moisture content at harvest was 5-10% lower at the earlier sowing time (10 April), which results in lower drying costs. The application of fertilization, plant density and sowing time should be hybrid-specific. References Árendás T.: 2000. A kukoricatermesztés korlátairól és lehetıségeirıl. Magyar Mezıgazdasáság.

PETRÓCZI3 1 University of Szeged Faculty of Agriculture, Hódmezıvásárhely 2 University of Szeged Faculty of Engineering, Szeged 3 Cereal Research Non-profit Company, Szeged Abstract: Experiments were carried out with wheat varieties GK Garaboly, GK Kalász, GK Verecke, GK Petur harvested in years 2005-2006. Small plots were sown at the Öthalom experimental station of the Cereal Research Non-Profit Company after wheat forecrop, in a four-parallel random block design. NPK fertilizer treatments of different level were combined with Artea + Amistar Xtra fungicide treatments of various doses and spectrum. Results were evaluated for rheological characteristics using three-factor analysis of variance (cultivar x treatment x year). The fertilizer and fertilizer + fungicide treatments (factor B) had a statistically reliable effect at the 0.1% level on the technological water absorption only. To summarize the results of the evaluated rheological parameters we can conclude that the common effect of increasing fertilizer doses and modern fungicides of broad spectrum works as a quality improving factor regarding baking value, technological water absorption, dough development time and extensibility values. The effect of variety on the formation of several baking characteristics is reliable. The phenophase of fungicide treatment can also influence several baking characteristics therefore quality, too. Artea and Amistar Xtra applied at heading seem to have a negative effect on quality in many cases. These are stresses which are factors influencing the baking quality of seed. Keywords: fertilizer treatments, fungicide, variety, baking value, water absorbing ability. Introduction Fertilizer treatments of various doses and combinations, as well as fungicides applied at different phenophases act as abiotic stress factors on crops including wheat. Most cases, increasing fertilizer doses enhance yield, moreover they improve composition and baking quality (Hoffmann et al. 2006, 2007; Jolánkai et al. 2006). Nitrogen containing yield enhancers improve the nutritive value of seeds, this way increasing protein content of wheat (Ruske et al. 2004; Jolánkai et al. 2006). Tanács et al. (2003) studied the effect of 16 fungicide treatments applied at the 2-3 node as well as at the heading-flowering stage on quality. Averaged over two varieties, the time of stability tendentiously decreased in 13 cases due to the effect of fungicide treatment. The results proved that the majority of the applied fungicides decrease the resistance of the gluten network against kneading. Late foliar application of triadimenol fungicide resulted in lower softness equivalent scores (Everts et al. 2001). The aim of our experiments was to study how do NPK treatments of increasing doses and various combinations as well as fungicides applied at different phenophases influence rheological characteristics of doughs, water absorbing ability and baking value at four winter wheat varieties cultivated in 2005, 2006. Materials and methods The studied wheat cultivars GK Garaboly, GK Kalász, GK Verecke, GK Petúr were sown at the test area Öthalom of the Cereal Research Non-profit Company, Szeged, on a deep-saline chernozem soil of medium nitrogen and good potassium and phosphorus</p><p id="Pg55">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The dates of fungicide treatment were: in 2005 at 2nd node stage (3 rd May) and heading (26 th May), similarly, in 2006 at 2nd node stage (3 rd May) and heading (22 nd May). The harvest dates were: 16 th July 2005 and 11 th July 2006. NPK fertilizer treatments of increasing doses were combined with Artea + Amistar Xtra fungicide treatments of various doses and spectrum (Table 1). Artea (propiconazole + cyproconazole) and Amistar Xtra (azoxystrobin + cyproconazole) are fungicides of broad spectrum. Results and discussion Results were represented and evaluated in the case of rheological sub-characteristics, as well as technological water absorbance and baking value (=valorigraphic value) using three-factor analysis of variance (cultivar x treatment x year). Considering the parameters studied, the effect of fertilizer (control) and fertilizer + fungicide (factor B) treatments proved to be statistically reliable at the 0.1% level in the case of technological water absorption only. The effect of treatments on baking value, technological water absorbance, dough development time, stability, softening and extensibility values averaged over the four varieties and the two years was not statistically reliable. Baking value and technological water absorbance values increased tendentiously as a result of higher fertilizer doses + fungicide treatments. Baking value. Averaged over two years and four wheat varieties, compared to the control (Treatment 1) Artea applied at heading (Treatment 2), as well as Artea applied at the second fertilizer level at heading (Treatment 3), or in both phenophases, 2nd node stage and heading (Treatment 4) had a tendentiously deteriorating effect on baking quality, in spite of the increasing fertilizer doses. The third fertilizer level + fungicide treatment (Treatments 5 and 6) resulted in a tendentious improvement of baking quality. At the fourth fertilizer level baking value improved further, but Amistar Xtra applied in both phenophases (Treatment 8) tendentiously decreased baking value, compared to Treatment 7 containing Artea and Amistar Xtra treatment (Table 2).</p><p id="Pg56">VIII.

Artea applied at heading (Treatment 2) tendentiously reduced technological water absorbing ability. Increasing fertilizer doses tendentiously improved this baking characteristic.

On the third (Treatments 5-6) and fourth (Treatment 7) fertilizer levels the value of dough softening decreased tendentiously, thus the quality improved. On the first fertilizer level Artea sprayed out at heading (Treatment 2) tendentiously increased the. On the fourth fertilizer level, at Treatment 8 Amistar Xtra tendentiously increased softening values compared to Artea and Amistar Xtra fungicide combinations (Treatment 7), thus decreasing quality. Extensibility. Tendentious increase in extensibility values can be detected at Treatments 5, 7, 8 only, suggesting quality improvement. Application of fungicides in general tendentiously decreased extensibility values. On the fourth fertilizer level, Amistar Xtra applied at both phenophases (Treatment 8) tendentiously decreased extensibility values compared to Artea and Amistar Xtra fungicide treatments (Treatment 7). Conclusion To sum up, in the case of the evaluated parameters we can conclude that increasing fertilizer doses always act as quality improving factors regarding baking value, technological water absorbance, as well as, at higher fertilizer doses, for swelling time and stability. In contrast, the effect of fungicides is not always evident. As the result of the counter-effect of fertilizers and fungicides applied at different phenophases, the quality improving effect of increasing fertilizer doses could not get on significantly. The effect of variety on the changes in certain rheological characteristics was found to be reliable. Above all, fungicides and their active ingredients applied at heading had a special way of influence on the formation of certain baking properties. Wet or dry pre-harvest weather can cause counter-effects in the formation of baking value, as well as technological water absorbance (Tanács and Soós 2001).

The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of weather conditions, organic and low input system under two N fertilization treatments on yield and yield components and quality traits of winter wheat. Winter wheat was grown in six-crop rotation pattern as follows: common pea – winter wheat – early potato – spring barley with the under-sowing of red clover – first year red clover – winter wheat. The partitioning of the variance showed that weather conditions prevailing during particular evaluated year were the most important factor in determining yield of winter wheat, thousand of kernels weight, number of spike per m2 and weight of kernels per spike. Relatively small proportion of total variance (that is explained by growing system) can be the result of the suitable crop rotation pattern and evaluated management practices (green manure, catch crops, farm yard manure). Grain yields of winter wheat calculated from the mean values achieved during seven years significantly differed between organic (5.97 t ha-1) and low input (6.34 t ha-1) systems. A top dressing of wheat by Vermisol significantly influenced crude protein and wet gluten content. The present study contributes to designing of management practices to reduce environmental impacts and improve crop production. Keywords: organic and low input system, environmental stress, winter wheat, yield, yield components Introduction Abiotic stress is the most harmful factor limiting the growth and productivity of cereals crops worldwide. Very often it is the simultaneous occurrence of several abiotic stresses, rather than a particular stress condition (Mittler, 2005). The effect of a combination of drought and heat stress on crop production is remarkable (Márton, 2008). Since winter wheat is a quite stress tolerant species, but even in Middle Europe the drought may case remarkable losses in grain yield and quality (Matuz et al., 2008). However, plants grown in healthy soil and suitable cropping systems are less susceptible to such stressors (Bujnovský, 2000; Birkás et al., 2008a), but in sustainable and more resistant cropping systems have to be taken into account also plant and soil interrelations (Jolankai, et al., 2008). Nevertheless, surface protection during and out of the growing season and cover plants are recognized as fundamental requirements for mitigate climate-stress (Birkás et al., 2008b). Development of environmentally sound production systems on arable land is great challenge of agricultural research and involves many partial targets (Lacko Bartošová, 2006a; Kvaternjak et al., 2008; Porhajašová et al., 2008; Valtýniová and Křen, 2008). The principal aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of weather conditions on yield, yield components and quality traits of winter wheat grown in organic and low input system.

Well composted farmyard manure (FYM) was applied under potato (30 t ha -1 ) and winter wheat (15 t ha -1 ). For qualitative fertilization a top-dressing of 50 L ha -1 Vermisol was applied, but only on fertilized treatment. Straw and crops residues were ploughed in by tillage and catch crops phacelia and mustard were sown. The low input system uses the same production practices as organic farming but allows limited use of pesticides and mineral fertilizers inputs. The dose of 30 + 30 N kg ha -1 ; and P, K mineral fertilizers calculated according to input output balance were applied (Bujnovský and Ložek, 1996). When winter wheat on particular stands was matured, plant samples from an area of 0.5 m 2 were uprooted and used for analysis of yield components and qualitative analysis from each subplot replication. After, the rests of total subplot area from each replication were harvested for grain and straw yield. The data were statistically evaluated by analysis of variance using the Statg. plus version 5.0 and the Fisher’s protected LSD test. Results and discussion To evaluate the climatic conditions impact on winter wheat growing in two environmentally sound cropping systems we have investigated the variation in yield and yield components structure and selected quality traits. Partitioning of the variance (Table 2) showed that climatic conditions prevailing during a specific year was the crucial factor in determination of winter wheat grain yield (84.1%) and thousand of kernels weight (85.9%), followed by kernels per spike (55.2%), weight of kernels per spike (47.8%) and spike length (42.6%). Relatively small proportion of total variance (that is explained by different growing system) can be the result of the suitable crop rotation pattern and evaluated management practices (green manure, catch crops, FYM).</p><p id="Pg60">VIII.

Generally, agronomic disturbances and cropping systems affect crops qualitative and quantitative traits through alteration of soil temperature, moisture and nutrients availability (Kováčik et al., 2006; Lacko-Bartošová, 2006b; Hoffman et al., 2007).</p><p id="Pg61">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Conclusions Results obtained in this study contribute to the development of environmentally sound technologies which have the potential for mitigation of environmental stresses. Beyond, our work also promotes the management practices for mitigation of environmental stresses through increasing of soil cover (suitable crop rotation, catch crops, undersowing) and adoption of less intensive cropping systems.

Hungary, e-mail: keszthelyisz@akii.hu Abstract: In the real world systems are in many ways interrelated to other systems, applying stress on one of them will have an effect on the other. In a controlled system, adaptive response can be improved in a way that the connected systems face less stress. In this approach we take plant production as a system controlled through nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation, and nitrogen leaching as an example for stress imposed on the connected ecological system. A plant growth model is used to demonstrate adaptation ways to different direct environmental stressors as drought and deficiency of available nitrogen. The adaptive response of the plant (i.e. slower growth) imposes stress on the ecological system. The amount of stress transferred by a controlled system can be reduced through control. Such a control presumes using models to predict adaptive response, feedback control is prone to over regulation. Modeling also allows easy interfacing to other modeled systems like ecologic or even the economic system, and thus the amount of stress transferred can be balanced to avoid extreme consequences. Our conclusion is that careful analysis and a better control can improve sustainability of plant production even within changing climatic and economic conditions. Keywords: nitrogen leaching, fertilization, crop model, economy sub-model, environmental stress Introduction Recent changes of the climate often meant less precipitation and lead to reduced yields in some areas. Shortage or lack of water is an obvious stress to most plants but for the plant production business less yield over prolonged periods of time involves the risk of bankruptcy. The stress introduced by water shortage will occur as economic stress for the farmers and their adaptation may transfer amplified stress back to the environment. Ecological awareness, use of models, careful planning and self restraint can reduce the stress transferred to nature. Reducing the stress imposed to nature is an approach that is less strict than “sustainability”, but it is still a huge step forward. The model we use to demonstrate the above statement combines simulations of plant growth, soil fertility and economic results of crop yields. Though the model internals use a large number of parameters and data, we focus on two variable inputs and two outputs to be observed. Végh and Szundy (2004), and Végh et al. (2003) demonstrated that water (i.e. precipitation and irrigation) and nitrogen, the two primary “nutrients” of wheat. These are the model variable inputs. One of the outputs observed is gross margin (the difference of certain income types and costs): reduction of monetary results is a stress factor that induces the farmer’s adaptation (Takács-György, 2007). The other output, the stress transferred to the surrounding nature, is nitrogen leaching, which is the drainage of water and movable nitrogen compounds from the field to groundwater and the downstream ecosystem. Nitrogen leaching to a threshold is one possible criterion of sustainability of a plant production scheme that can be observed and tested with this model. The numerous other parameters used by the model include a detailed description of the soil (8 parameters), weather conditions as well as cultivation options such as the crop selection, fertilizer dose and irrigation.</p><p id="Pg63">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 66 By coupling the crop growth model with economic factors such as expenses and incomes allows testing profitability, thus economic sustainability similarly. This combined model is used to demonstrate adaptation ways to different direct environmental stressors as drought and deficiency of available nitrogen. The stress–adaptation cycle of the connected systems in our approach is the following: Primary stress is drought. The adaptive response of the plant (i.e. slower growth) imposes stress on the agro-ecological production system in the form of lower yield. Depending on the adaptive answer by the farmer a certain amount of stress transferred to nature. This amount can be reduced by a controlled agricultural plant production system through controlling water and available nitrogen supply of the crop. Materials and methods The study area situates in the Nyírség region of the Great Hungarian Plain. It is a part of the large basin filled with fluvial-, plus eolic sand and loess sediments. The slightly undulate surface is between 97 and 162 m above Baltic Sea level. The mean annual precipitation is close to 600 mm with rather inhomogeneous distribution. Potential evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds the precipitation consequently the soil water balance is negative. Groundwater table depth varies between 2 and 4 m. Soil types of the study area are humus sandy and chernozem like meadow soils with loamy sand texture. Soil characteristics used as model inputs are given in Table 1. Table 1. Soil properties of the study area used as model parameter values Model runs included three different annual precipitation patterns: average (550 mm), wet (610 mm) and dry (520 mm), and two field crops, winter wheat and rye. Model options include irrigation, but irrigation of this kind – especially in this area – is strictly theoretical. When irrigation is switched on, the model assumes that all the water needed by the plant is available. Economic aspects of the model boil down to optimizing gross margin of the specific production. Gross margin is the difference between the production value and variable costs. We have to stress that gross margin is neither income nor profit. Variable costs are only a part of a farm’s costs, fixed costs like rent and depreciation are not covered. A high gross margin can mean loss especially when paired with expensive machinery, and therefore high depreciation costs. The simulated economic results, production value and cultivation costs are based on FADN data (Keszthelyi, 2006). Optimization is done by Excel’s Solver. The economic optimum is the highest possible gross margin as a function of fertilizer use under the conditions given by precipitation pattern, cultivation type and the constraint of N leaching that should be under 50 mg l -1 .

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 67 Leachable N is assumed to be 30% of available N. For soil described in Table 1 the amount of N in kgha -1 approximately equals to the N-concentration of soil solution in mgl -1 since usable water storage of the 80 cm deep soil profile is 110 mm. Results and discussion On this land, assuming rye production and N fertilizer dose of 80 kgha -1 , the difference in gross margin between a wet and a dry year is roughly 50%. Such drop in gross margin will often mean loss for the farmer. The farmer trying to cope has few opportunities in the range of agricultural production. He can try to compensate yield loss by increasing the dose of N fertilizer. To reach the same gross margin the amount of fertilizer should be increased to 100 kgha -1 . By increasing the dose to 160 kgha -1 , modeled gross margin can even be doubled in a dry year. Figure 1. Modeled potentially leachable nitrogen amount from a differently cultivated rye field Such a dosage raises the risk of nitrogen leaching but not dramatically. Figure 1 shows how the amount of leachable N rolls off throughout the with rye production using different fertilizer doses (0, 80 and 160 kgha -1) , with and without irrigation. Only the highest dose of fertilizer the N concentration of the leachable soil solution is above 50 mgl -1 . We emphasize, that this amount is potentially leachable. If there is no heavy rain or high water table before the vegetation begins, N will stay in the soil and will be available for the plant to take. In practice N fertilizer is usually applied in two doses, one in autumn and one in spring. It means that the potentially leachable amount is increased to some extent, but the time span of the risky period is reduced to a few weeks. 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 P o te n ti al N le ac h k g h a -1 N 0 N 0 Ir r ig a te d N 8 0 N 8 0 Ir r ig a te d N 1 6 0 N 1 6 0 I r r ig a te d J A N F E B M A R A P R M A Y J U N J U L A U G S E P O C T N O V</p><p id="Pg65">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 68 High N dosage still means a risk of environmental stress. If the crop does not take up N due to unfavorable weather conditions, disease or pest damage the remaining N is potentially leachable throughout the whole year (e.g. Rutkoviene et al. 2007). Figure 1 shows how the leachable N changes under different production conditions. The economic optimization process of the model specifies non-irrigated and irrigated N doses for rye production. As Fig. 1 shows even high doses of N fertilizer mean no stress for the environment under normal conditions. Ideal irrigation water supply provided by the crop requirement reduces the leachable N amount due to N uptake. However the reduced precipitation does not mean less heavy rains and floods, on the contrary, extreme weather conditions may occur more frequently. Table 2.

This stress is immediately transferred to the farmer in the form of lower yields and reduced gross margin. The farmer’s adaptation, the usage of economically optimal – thus higher – fertilizer dose reduces stress under normal conditions. In case the weather changes for the worse, the adaptation will still reduce the stress on the farmer, but the stress is transferred to the environment in the form of N leaching.

To suppress weeds, it is suggested to sow high diversity seed mixtures composed by non-weedy disturbance tolerant and generalist members of the biological flora. Available seed ecological knowledge on these species is more or less satisfactory regarding seed weight, seed shape and dispersal type, however, more research needed to learn their soil seed bank types, germination and seed storage requirements. To determine exact composition of multi-species seed mixtures applicable in practice, case studies should be conducted under major climatic and soil conditions. Keywords: biodiversity, fallow land, seed ecology, vegetation succession, weed suppression Introduction Abandoned fields are subjected to spontaneous secondary succession that results in considerable plant cover within short time (Bazzaz 1975). This plant cover is efficient in preventing soil deflation and erosion (Jolánkai et al. 2008), as well as supporting soil resilience (Várallyay 2007). However, the weedy character of early successional stages makes a strong biotic stress on the soil. Weed seed bank of the soil increases considerably and it becomes a long lasting source of weed contamination (Roberts 1981). To prevent colonization of early-successional (arable weed) species Van der Putten et al. (2000) manipulated the aboveground species diversity on abandoned arable lands by sowing more or less diverse species mixtures of later-successional plant species. They found high-diversity mixtures more effective than low-diversity ones, and the exact species composition also proved to be important. The idea of this paper is (1) to identify species groups potentially suitable for acceleration of vegetation succession by sowing their seeds on abandoned fields; and (2) to survey available seed ecological information about these species. Materials and methods Concerning question 1, species pools of five abandoned fields were studied on loessy gentle slopes near Lake Balaton, after 5-10 years of abandonment. Size of fields varied between 2-8 ha. Ecological classification of vascular species into functional groups was based on Borhidi's (1995) system. Regarding question 2, four databases developed for the Hungarian flora were used, as follows: thousand-seed-weight and seed shape databases (Csontos 1998), the soil seed bank type database (Csontos 2001) and the seed dispersal type database (Csontos et al. 2002).</p><p id="Pg67">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 70 Results and discussion After 5-10 years of spontaneous vegetation succession 32.4% of the species pool was still composed by weeds (W) plus ruderal- and alien competitors (RC, AC) on the studied abandoned fields (Table 1). Among species groups of close-to-nature character disturbance tolerants and generalists had the largest proportions (DT+G= 54.2%). Earlier studies have also demonstrated the key importance of the latter groups in vegetation regeneration (Tamás 2001, Malatinszky 2008). Species from the specialist group (S) had negligible contribution since they generally require much longer time for re-establishment (Sendtko 1999, Malatinszky et al. 2008), however, the equally poor presence of natural pioneers (NP) was unexpected (Table 1).

(2000), it is obvious from the results that we should support species of DT and G groups of the natural vegetation. After directly introducing them into the abandoned fields we can rely on their ability to occupy the fields quickly and control weed invasion via competitive exclusion. The successful application of this preventive method in practice strongly depends on the available knowledge about seed ecology, germination characteristics, seed storage requirements, etc of native DT and G species. In these respects wild growing species were much less studied than cultivated crop plants and ornamental species, therefore a survey of currently available data was necessary. Results of such survey are shown in Table 2, concerning to the Angiosperms and Gymnosperms of the Hungarian flora that counts 2378 species. About thousand-seed-weight, seed shape and chorological type most of the species are already classified (68-80%), and our knowledge regarding the two target groups are even wider. The increase of known records is especially remarkable for DT species. Soil seed bank types of the species are much less known, though one of the simplest seed bank classification system was applied (transient, short-term persistent and long-term persistent; Thompson 1993, Csontos and Tamás 2003). It is because the identification of soil seed bank types of species is either labour intensive or extreme time consuming depending on the methods applied (Thompson et al. 1997, Telewski</p><p id="Pg68">VIII.

Nevertheless, increased percentages of species of known data can be reported again when DT or G species are taken account (Table 2). Table 2.

However, further research would be welcome especially on the soil seed bank behaviour of these species. Additionally, germination characteristics and seed storage requirements should also receive much attention. In this respect, there is a large gap between our understanding on cultivated plants and wild growing species (Szabó 1980), though a considerable increase in research activity on biological floras can be seen at international scale (Baskin and Baskin 1998). In this respect a break-through took place, more recently, within the frame of an EU supported project, the European Native Seed Conservation Network (ENSCONET). The project aims to build extensive databases for a large scale of information on seeds, with special attention to germination success of wild growing species and to optimal storage conditions of their seeds (in seed gene banks). Then these databases will be offered as research infrastructure to the scientific community. This should allow us to compose adequate multi-species seed mixtures for a wide scale of habitat types under various climatic conditions and soil types of Europe. Besides controlling weed invasion on abandoned fields, these seed mixtures will probably be successfully applied in further cases of ecological operations, including practices on landscape management and ecological restoration. Conclusions Massive establishment of arable weeds and invasive alien species is a great problem in fallow lands. To reduce this biological stress a well funded method based on diversity concept, niche pre-emption and competitive exclusion was proposed (Van der Putten et al. 2000), that relies on sowing high diversity mixture of seeds of non-weedy native species immediately after abandonment. For this operation, a case study on successional old-fields in Hungary identified the most applicable species groups (disturbance tolerant- and generalist species). A species intensive survey showed that information about seed weight, seed shape and dispersal type are available for 68-88% of the potentially useful species. A need to increase our knowledge regarding the mentioned seed attributes is obvious, and even more research should be done on germination behaviour and seed storage requirements of the target species groups. To determine species composition of seed mixtures applicable at different climate and soil types, further case studies should be conducted.</p><p id="Pg69">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The environmental stressors as: soil, weather, nutrients, etc. are greatly influencing the successfulness of agricultural production. With a logical farming we can alleviate both environmental and anthropogenic impact with an applying of precision techniques (e.g. tillage, site site-specific nutrient and chemical assignment, yield and moisture measuring during harvest). The grain moisture varies on filed not only during the season or the day, but especially spatially, therefore to determine the exact harvest time, as an alleviating biotic tool a continuous measurement of this parameter is required. During my investigations I compared an on-field, combine mounted capacitance moisture sensor results with the filling of the grain tank and a NIT (Near Infrared Transmittance) sensor mounted on a clean grain elevator. With our near-infrared oncombine grain analyzer we are capable to record also oil and protein content beside moisture that makes the whole measurement more valuable. Based on the new results an earlier measuring method (capacitance) should be corrected or a new one (NIT) could be used. Keywords: capacitance sensor, NIT, grain moisture, site-specific measuring techniques Introduction Improving sustainability of agricultural production systems has recently become one of the main goals for the agricultural policy (Rajkai et al., 2007, Németh et al., 2007, Jolánkai et al., 2008, Neményi et al., 2008). The harvest always should be managed in conjunction with post-harvest operations in order to achieve the highest quality and quantity of grain (Zoerb et al., 1993). We need to have adequate information (whether to harvest - now or delay - or which area of the crop should be harvested next) in order to make the proper decision, because there is a spatial variation of moisture content within and between fields. Also, cropping intensity, planting date, fertilization by nitrogen, hybrid properties and weather conditions influence the rate of water release from the kernel (field drying rate) examined the impact of different soil mineral nitrogen treatments on the level and dynamics of corn kernel moisture loss (Jukic et al., 2007). Moisture content must be measured to obtain accurate yields since both volume and mass of grain are affected by grain moisture (Arslan et al., 2002). To measure the grain moisture content in a site-specific way, capacitive, microwave, acoustic (Amoodeh et al., 2006) or near-infrared measurement devices are used. The main problem of capacitive and microwave measurements is the dependence of other parameters as mass density and temperature. Moreover, microwave measurements are expensive. Recently, good results were reported with a NIR sensor, used for both protein and moisture measurements (Reyns et al., 2002). The yield is very important for the growers, however quality parameters and water content is probably just so important since it affects grain sale price. By mathematically combining the results from protein and yield maps we can also estimate N removal from a field (Engel et al., 1997). Summarizing the above mentioned it can be declared that the on-line measurement of different parameters (protein, oil, moisture, starch) during the harvest are providing the</p><p id="Pg71">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 74 necessary base for decision making, therefore the precision of these measurements is remarkable. Materials and methods Experiments were carried out in the No 80/1. field (47°54’19.2” N, 17°15’08.29” E) belongs to the experimental farm of the University of West Hungary, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences. The employed system for capacitance moisture sensing was the Agrocom ACT and Zeltex AccuHarvest On-Combine Grain Analyzer for NIT sensing installed on a Deutz Fahr M 35.80 combine harvester. The operation of the sensor mounted in the exit of the tank feeding auger is based on the principle of conductivity. One of the major error of this sensor comes from the inconstant measured volume. By filling and emptying of the grain tank the area is changing continuously, which causes a great fluctuation during on-to-go moisture sensing (Fig. 1.). 10 15 20 25 30 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Measured data flow G ra in m oi st ur e [% ] Figure 1. The grain (corn) moisture change during harvest in 2006 Therefore a microsonar sensor (Nivelco Hungary Inc.) was mounted on a top of the grain tank, what measures the crop distance from the bottom of the tank in centimeters. Using a DellAxim X50v PDA with in house software and connected to a GPS, the grain distance from the top has been recorded spatially during the harvest. With Eq.

For calibration, factory (Zeltex Inc.) data were used. As a control measurement for grain moisture content I have used the drying chamber results. Results and discussion Using the microsonar controller I have recorded the grain distance from the bottom of the tank continuously. As Fig. 2. shows there was a clear correlation between grain tank saturation and between the bias from the standard moisture, therefor the result is, if we don’t ensure a permanent volume for capacitance sensor, there will be under and overmeasures depending on grain tank saturation. As a solution we can use an additional sensor (e.g. misrosonar), and during the post process of the data we can correct (Eq. 2.) our moisture values (Table 1.). The precision was ± 0.6% in both NIT and corrected capacitance sensors, what is a great achievment in a comparison with raw capacitnace sensor data where the precision was ± 2.7% and also the fluctuation (Fig. 1.) after the emptying of the grain tank was much greater (appr. ± 8%), which caused additional inappropriate data, too. This change in measured data flow showed up the same result in year 2004 (winter wheat), 2005 (corn) and in 2008 (corn) too. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 76 Conclusions The precision agricultural techniques can be treated as alleviating tools for environmental and anthropogenic stressors; therefore the successfulness of the production depends on the accuracy of recorded data. The precision of a capacitance moisture sensor highly depends on actual compactness of the grain (grain/air ratio) in the grain tank. If we can not ensure a place for the sensor in a harvester, where the flow rate is constant, therefore the measuring volume is not permanent an additional sensor (e.g. microsonar) should be used to detect continuously a grain tank status, during the harvest. As a second solution a NIT technology could be used. During my investigation I have stated that the accuracy was the same as measured with the corrected capacitance sensor. In addition with Zeltex On-Combine Grain Analyzer oil and protein content could be recorded (starch content calibrations are under development, what will a great advantage for future investigations in bioetanol production Jolánkai et al., 2007), so we can gain valuable site-specific information besides water content about those quality parameters too.

Abstract: The aim of our investigation was to study the interaction between crops and and Xanthium italicum in additive treatments. In additive experiments two species are grown together, the density of the crop is maintained constant, while that of the weed species is varied. Small plot experiments were set up in order to study the effect of X. italicum density (1, 2, 5, and 10 plants m-2) on maize and sunflower yields under field conditions. Generally, average yield proportionally decreased as the weed density increased, but at higher weed densities intraspecific competition among Xanthium plants was stronger than competition between crops and weed. Sunflower was a stronger competitor than maize. X. italicum caused an average of 43 and 90% yield losses of sunflower and maize, respectively. Keywords: Xanthium italicum, maize, sunflower, competition Introduction Xanthium italicum was first detected in the 1920’s along the Tisza river in Hungary and was a typical weed of river banks and waste lands. Its germinating seeds and plant parts contain poisonous alkaloids and glycosides which can cause animal diseases and play important role in plant-plant interactions (Borbély and Dávid, 2008). Today X. italicum is considered a dangerous invasive alien weed species in Hungary, causing considerable yield losses in agricultural crops. Similar to other plant invaders (Jenser et al., 2008) until now no pests and pathogens are known to cause considerable biological decline of this species. Competition is considered as a type of interference among higher plants (Harper, 1977). Under field conditions a lot of environmental factors – in close connection with each other – can influence interspecific competition between crops and weeds (Pozsgai 1984; Kovacevic et al., 2004; Kovács et al., 2006; Nádasy and Nádasy, 2006; Nádasy et al., 2008). The majority of agricultural competition studies are based on the additive experiments. In additive experiments two species are grown together, the density of the crop is maintained constant, while that of the weed species is varied. The effect of weed density on yield loss has been extensively studied and relations between weed density and yield loss are described with different type of functions (Zimdahl, 2004). The aim of our examinations was to study the interaction between crops (maize and sunflower) and X. italicum in additive experiments. Materials and methods Small plot (15m -2 ) experiments in randomized blocks, in three replicates were set up on Ramann brown forest soil with clay illuviation, at Keszthely (Hungary), in spring of 2007 year. Maize (‘Dekalb’) and sunflower (‘Sonja Benita’) were sown on the 23 rd and 18 th April, respectively. The treatments were the followings: 1. Untreated weedy control 2. Weed-free control 3. X. italicum, 1 plant m-2</p><p id="Pg75">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 78 4. X. italicum, 2 plant m-2 5. X. italicum, 5 plant m-2 6. X. italicum, 10 plant m-2 Hand hoeing was continuously applied to maintain weed-free control plots. Plots of the treatments 3 to 6 were kept free from weed species – except X. italicum – and weed density was also continuously checked. At the beginning of maize and sunflower flowering (on the 15 th July) the height of 20 representative crop individuals were measured in each plot. Maize and sunflower harvest happened on the 21 st and 14 th Sept, respectively. The yield was calculated to the 14% and 8% wet content for maize grains and sunflower achiness, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the results with an alpha-error of 5%. Results and discussion The height of sunflower was significantly reduced in all treatments as compared to weed-free control plots (2 nd treatment). The height reduction in maize was not significant, when weedy plots and the 5 th treatment (X. italicum, 5 plant m-2) was compared to the weed-free control ones (Figure 1). X. italicum at densities of 1, 2, 5 and 10 plant m-2 caused 87, 82, 96 and 94% reduction in maize yield, respectively, while the same weed densities caused 31, 43, 43 and 56% reduction in sunflower yield. 23 and 92% yield losses were observed on weedy control plots, as compared to weed-free control ones, with sunflower and maize crops, respectively (Figure 2.). No significant difference was observed between the crop yields – except the treatments, when weed density was 1 and 10 plants m -2 for sunflower – due to the different weed densities, suggesting that at higher densities intraspecific competition between Xanthium plants is stronger than interspecific competition between crops and weeds. Similar observations were made in earlier experiments with other weed species (Kovács et al. 2006; Kazinczi et al. 2007). . 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1 2 3 4 5 6 LS D5 % treatments h ei g h t (c m ) maize sunflower Figure 1.

Conclusions X. italicum caused an average of 43 and 90% yield losses of sunflower and maize, respectively, suggesting that sunflower has a stronger competitive ability as compared to that of maize. It was also proved in earlier additive crop-weed competition studies, when Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Varga et al., 2006) and Abutilon theophrasti (Kovács et al., 2006) were the competition partners. In the respect of competitive ability - on the basis of previous similar experiments - the weed species follow the order: X. ithalicum&gt;Datura stramonium&gt;A. artemisiifolia&gt;A. theophrasti (Kovács et al., 2006; Varga et al., 2006; Dávid et al., 2006; Dávid and Tarcali, 2008). It is considered, that weed species and density are not unexclusive factors influencing crop yield. Other factors, such as relative leaf area, relative emergence time may be also important, influencing crop yield (Cousens et al., 1987; Kropff and Spitters, 1991). Results of different years and locations may differ due to the different climatic and edaphic factors.

It was stated, that the application of the potassium chloride was ineffective on the strawberry yield. The most favourable conditions for the berry development were ensured by the joint treatments with potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. Nutrients applied in form of sulphate inhibited the uptake of chloride ions. It is presumable, that the decrease in the chloride ion content of plants contributed to the yield and quality increment. Keywords: strawberry, yield and quality, chloride stress, potassium chloride, potassium sulphate, Patentkali Introduction Potassium plays an important role in the plant’s development: it promotes the elongation of the cells, takes part in the water management of plant and in the synthesis of all kinds of carbohydrates: sugar, starch, and cellulose (Bergmann and Neubert, 1976). Strawberry that is well supplied with potassium synthetizes more sugar, so the yield will be sweeter (Babicz, 2002). In plant production mostly potassium chloride is used as potassium fertilizer. Strawberry – like many horticultural plants (Nagy et al., 2008) – reacts sensitive to chloride ions, because elevated chloride ion content inhibits the translocation of assimilates. Therefore a comparison of the application of potassium chloride and chloride-free fertilizers such as potassium sulphate is reasonable. Besides potassium, magnesium plays also a relevant role in plant life (Loch and Nostíczius, 1992). It is important to watch out on magnesium supply on soils that are treated with a higher potassium dosage: because of the antagonism between the two ions, high potassium content can hinder magnesium utilization (Kátai et al., 2008). To study the effect of chloride stress, of potassium and magnesium supply of soils, we set up field trials on acidic sandy soil with different fertilizers, such as potassium chloride, potassium sulphate and Patentkali (which contains both magnesium sulphate and potassium sulphate). Materials and methods The field experiment was set up on an acidic soil (pH-KCl = 4.4) with sandy texture, near to Újfehértó, Eastern Hungary. The initial ammonium-lactate – acetic acid (AL-) extractable nutrient content is the following: 129.6 mg kg -1 P2O5; 208.8 mg kg -1 K2O, 1 243 mg Ca and 67.3 mg Mg kg -1 soil. The area of each plot was: 2.8 m * 3.75 m = 10.5 m 2 , the distance between rows was 0.75 m, and the plant to plant distance was 0.25 m, so these were 60 plants in each plot. We used the sort “Polana” in our</p><p id="Pg79">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 82 experiment. To reach a higher statistical reliability we set up our experiment in 6 replications, in a randomised arrangement. Treatment factors were the following: 1. Treatment without K- and Mg-fertilization („control“) 2. 120 kg K2O ha -1 (KCl) 3. 120 kg K2O ha -1 (K2SO4) 4. 120 kg K2O ha -1 (K2SO4) + 40 kg MgO ha -1 (MgSO4) = Patentkali Chemical fertilization was executed a week before planting, so on 6 th of April. We chose to give the same potassium dosage (120 kg K2O ha -1 ) to each treatment combination with fertilization, so we had the opportunity to study and compare the effects of anions. In treatment Nr 4 we used Patentkali that besides potassium-sulphate contains magnesium-sulphate as well, to test, how the applied magnesium affects the yield. At the same time we treated the whole experimental area with a standard joint fertilizer of 100 kg N ha -1 and 100 kg P2O5 ha -1 in form of ammonium nitrate (AN) and mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP). We avoided using superphosphate because of its sulphate content. During the experimental period we adjusted the care of the crop and plant protection to the needs of plants. Unfortunately we did not have any opportunity for irrigation. In the first vegetation period we could not collect any considerable and evaluable amount of berry yield. Therefore we measured the yield per plot and its quality parameters only a year after plantation. In the second year between the 21 st of May and 11 th of June we collected and measured the yield amount continually, 16 times altogether. Plants’ dry matter was analysed for their carbon and nitrogen content by an Elementar analyser, using a dry combustion method in oxygen atmosphere (Nagy, 2000). From the fresh berry samples of the 6 th picking we determined the vitamin C-content of the berries per each plot. For that we used iodometric titration method. Beside this we determined the reducing sugar content expressed in fructose with Cu 2+ /Cu + redoxy titration method and the chloride ion content of the yield with HPLC ionchromatography method (Balláné Kovács A., 2000; Balla Kovács et al., 2007). The results were statistically evaluated with single factor ANOVA. Results and discussion An overview table from the results of the experiment and its statistical analysis was made (Table 1.). The consolidated yield amounts, the vitamin-C-, the reducing sugar- (expressed in fructose) and the chloride-ion-content are shown per plot in this table. In accordance to the better perspicuity we also represent the results on figures. Figure 1. shows the yield mass of strawberry of the second year in the average of the 6 replications. The summarized yield was the highest in this year, depending on the treatments it varied between 17.2 and 20.6 kg per plot. It can be stated, that the yield was the highest in treatments with both potassium-sulphate and magnesium-sulphate (Patentkali).</p><p id="Pg80">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 83 Compared to the treatments with potassium-chloride, potassium-sulphate itself resulted in a statistically significant yield increment, but this increment fell short of that in treatments with magnesium. As the results of the analysis of variance shows, the effects of the treatments were statistically proved at P = 0.1 % significance level (***). Table 1.

It became also evident, that there was a really close significant treatment effect on the chloride-ion-content of strawberry.

Cereal Research Communications 84 relationship proved close significant (P = 0.1 % probability level). This fact contributed definitely to the yield increment of strawberry. It can also be stated, that none of the treatments had a significant effect on the vitamin-C- and the reducing sugar-content of berries. The smaller differences weren’t confirmed by the statistical analysis. There were also no significant differences in the plant’s dry matter carbon and nitrogen content either. Conclusions Summarizing our results, we can state, that the most favourable conditions for the strawberry development and for the amount of yield were ensured by the treatments with a combination of potassium-sulphate and magnesium-sulphate (Patentkali). This positive effect was confirmed by the statistical analysis at P = 0.1 % probability level. From the quality parameters vitamin-C- and sugar-content of berries were not affected by any of the treatments, but nutrients applied in form of sulphate inhibited the uptake of chloride-ions. It is presumable, that the decrease in the chloride-ion concentration of plants contributed to the yield increment.

They were established with uniform NPK fertilization treatments at different agro-ecological regions of the country. Cumulative yield differences from two sites, Iregszemcse (IR) with calcaric chernozem soil type and Bicsérd (BI) with chernozem brown forest soil affected by nutrient stress (deficiency or surplus) will be presented. In the wheat-maize-maize-wheat rotation, the long-term effect of the applied 20 fertilization treatments (0, N, NP, NK, NPK) was studied in 8 rotation cycles. The stress effect caused by nutrient deficiency was considerable first of all in the unfertilized plots (a yield decrease of 36.8-39.5% and 14.631.7% compared to the average with wheat and maize, respectively), while unbalanced nutrient supply effected a marked nutrient stress through nutrient surplus. Wheat responded to the accumulating P-deficiency more markedly, while maize was more remarkably affected by nutrient stress caused by K-deficiency. Keywords: long-term fertilization trials, winter wheat, maize, grain yield, nutrient deficiency and surplus. Introduction Different crops respond to nutrient surplus or deficiency very differently. The more beneficial the plant supply with other nutrients is, the more efficient the yield increasing effect of N is. Nutrient stress caused by N surplus or deficiency results in poor grain development. The yield increasing effect of P is not very considerable, but its deficiency in the early vegetative phase disadvantageously influences the tillering of wheat, the number of earless shoots. Wheat is especially sensitive to P deficiency, maize is less responsive to it. K deficiency does not cause visible symptoms immediately, but it manifests itself in a remarkable yield decrease. The excess or deficiency of nutrients depends also on the nutrient status of the soil, which is considerably influenced by the different soil characteristics and water supply as well (Izsáki, 2007; Kátai et al., 2006; Németh, 2006). Materials and methods In 1967 a network of long-term fertilization field trials were set up with uniformly applied 20 fertilization treatments including increasing NPK doses and different nutrient proportions (Table 1), with two different four-year crop rotations, in four replications at different agro-ecological regions of Hungary (Debreczeni and Debreczeni, 1994). In our study the grain yields in 8 cycles of winter wheat-maize-maize-winter wheat rotation were evaluated at two sites, IR and BI in the period of 1967-1999. IR has an alkaline soil type, while BI an acidic one: calcaric chernozem and chernozem brown forest soil, respectively (Table 2). The yield data were evaluated as follows: The grain yields of the 20 treatments were averaged for each of the rotations (wheat, 2 years; maize, 2 years) and these averages were regarded as basic data. In each rotation the yield differences, compared to these basic data, were calculated (with positive or negative sign), then they were added (cumulated) according to the rotations. Because of the limited size of this paper, only data from the 2 nd , 4 th , 6 th and 8 th rotations are discussed.</p><p id="Pg83">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 86 Table 1.

The 32-year long-term effect of fertilization on the grain yields clearly shows the deficiency or surplus of nutrients. The cumulative average yields of the 8 rotations amounted to 30.8(IR)-32.9(BI) t ha –1 and 60.3(IR)-59.4(BI) t ha –1 with wheat and maize, respectively. Stress effect caused by long-term nutrient deficiency: In the unfertilized wheat and maize plots (code number: 000) significant yield decreases could be detected, which was attributable to the increasing nutrient demand during the 32 years of the trials. Wheat was more sensitive to stress effects at IR, while maize at BI. Stress effect caused by fertilization only with N: In the treatments of increasing N doses (100, 200, 300), the ratio of NPK nutrients gradually became distorted. The N overfertilization resulted in a stress effect of undesirable degree with both crops and at both soil types. At BI the deleterious effect was higher. Compared to the control, this stress effect was not so marked, but clear-cut. According to the P and K supplying capacity of the experimental soils, the plants could uptake some P and K nutrients. Stress effects in the NP treatments, regarding the role of P fertilization: The increasing N doses given together with P fertilizer (110, 210, 310; 120, 220, 320) reduced the stress effect. In the NP treatments wheat favorably responded to the P fertilizer, mainly</p><p id="Pg84">VIII.

At IR the effect of P fertilizer was lower, because this experimental soil has a medium phosphorus status. Table 3.

At IR the P reserves of the soil reduced the stress effects in the NK treatments. Relationships between NPK treatments and stress effects: In treatments 101, 201, 301, 111, 211, 311,121, 211, 321, 432 increasing N doses were given with increasing P and K doses. Wheat showed stress effects in case of P deficiency at both sites. At IR, the cumulative yield differences of maize were positive in the above treatments. At BI, in PK treatments combined with the lowest N dose, N deficiency caused the stress effect, because of the unbalanced nutrient ratios. Optimal treatments: Treatment 221 gave the optimal wheat yield at IR (5.21 t ha-1 = 16.9% increase compared to the average), while treatment 321 proved to be optimal at BI (6.99 t ha -1 = 21.3 %). Treatment 311 gave the optimal maize yield at IR (4.68 t ha -1 = 7.8 %), while treatment 321 proved to be optimal at BI (7.13 t ha -1 = 12.0%).</p><p id="Pg85">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

In the 8 rotations, the cumulative yield decrease of wheat amounted to 11-13 t ha -1 at both sites. At BI the yield decrease of maize (18.82 t ha -1 ) was twice as much as at IR (8.78 t ha -1 ). The stress effects were markedly affected by long-term deficiency or not optimal ratios of nutrients and by the different nutrient supplying capacity of the experimental soils.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of water stress (precipitation), under rain fed conditions, on the main components of maize grown for bioethanol production. Yield, starch content and starch yield per hectare of maize hybrids were investigated in a droughty (2007) and in a favourable year with optimal weather conditions (2008). This study was conducted at the Látókép Experimental Station of the Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Debrecen University. The investigations were part of a multi-factorial long-term field experiment. The starch content was determined by a Foss InfratecTM 1241 type Grain Analyzer. Based on our results, optimal treatment combinations can be determined that can be used to maximalize starch yield per hectare in both droughty and wet crop seasons. In the water-stressed crop season of 2007, the highest starch yield was obtained with the hybrids Mv Tarján and Mv Koppány in moisturesaving shallow spring tillage at 120 kg ha-1 N dose (2.96 and 2.93 t ha-1). The higher fertilizer dose significantly decreased starch yield values. In 2008, the best treatment combination proved to be the winter plowing when applying a N fertilizer dose of 120 kg ha-1 in the case of ED 5110 hybrid (8.42 t ha-1). The N fertilizer dose of 240 kg ha-1 further increased starch yield (9.25 t ha-1), but this dose cannot be applied either from environmental protection aspects, or from economical causes. Keywords: maize, starch content, starch yield, water stress, precipitation Introduction In the recent 4-5 years, the importance of maize processing for industrial purposes increased significantly, whose reason is the revaluation of renewable energy resources and the starch-based ethanol production. In order be able to more thoroughly understand the hybrids getting into common production, the factors influencing quality have to be examined to a more detailed extent. The data about each hybrid help the producer and the integrator in producing hybrids that best conform to the aim of usage and its related quality requirements. As the overwhelming majority (50-70%) of the processing costs of bioethanol production is constituted by raw material expenses, it is important to be able to extract the highest amount of ethanol possible from the purchased grain yield. Prokszáné et al. (1995) stated that the increasing nitrogen fertilizer doses resulted in the significant increase of the protein content of maize, but starch content justifiably decreased at the same time. Similarly to yield, higher starch yield was obtained in the case of higher nitrogen fertilizer levels. Both starch and extractable starch content were decreased by N fertilization in the studies of Singh et al. (2002) and Kiss and Andorkó (2008). Gyıri et al. (2008) concluded that there is also a negative relationship between protein and starch content. They call attention to the fact that the previous decades’ strategy to increase the protein mass should be supervised when appraising hybrids, as the carbohydrate content of grains is being revaluated during bioethanol production. The authors’ question is whether the breeding strategy has to be rethought due to this reason, or maize hybrids with low protein content or high total fermentable (HTF) hybrids will be the ideal raw material for the bioethanol industry under Hungarian conditions.</p><p id="Pg87">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 90 Materials and methods The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of water stress (precipitation), under rain fed conditions in eastern Hungary, on the main components of maize grown for bioethanol production over the 2007-2008 crop seasons. Yield, starch content and starch yield per hectare of maize hybrids were investigated in a droughty (2007) and in a favourable year with optimal weather conditions (2008). This study was conducted at the Látókép Experimental Station of the Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Debrecen University located in the north-eastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain (47° 30’ N, 21° 36’ E, 121 m elevation). The investigations were part of a multi-factorial (irrigation, tillage, fertilization, plant density) long-term field experiment. The soil of the experimental site was a lowland pseudomyceliar chernozem (Mollisol-Calciustoll or Vermustoll, silt loam). The climate is temperate continental, with a mean annual precipitation of 566 mm of which approximately 60% (345 mm) occurs during the growing season (from April to September). In 2007, the extraordinarily dry half year (128 mm) was followed by a very long drought period from early spring that was brought to an end by a moist period starting in mid-August. The weather conditions in 2008 were very favorable for maize, with sufficient precipitation both in the winter and in the vegetation period. Total precipitation for the 2008 growing season was 484 mm. The April to September precipitation was 23% more than the fifty-year average. Five maize hybrids chosen for bioethanol production were set up in the experiment: DKC 4005 (FAO 300); Kamaria (FAO 370); MV Tarján (FAO 380); MV Koppány (FAO 420); ED 5110 (FAO 420). Corn grain samples were collected before harvest. The laboratory examinations of corn grain samples were done at the Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development, Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Debrecen University. After sample preparation starch content of maize hybrids were evaluated by Foss InfratecTM 1241 Grain Analyzer. The measurements are based on the fact that the main components in the grain (corn), such as protein, moisture, starch, fat, absorb electromagnetic radiation in the near-infrared region of the spectrum (570-1100 nm). The Near Infrared Transmission (NIT) instrument measures the transmission absorption, the main components of whole corn grain samples are determined by calibration curves. Results and discussion The precipitation supply of the examined years basically determined the starch yields per hectare and the starch content specified for dry matter units. In the extremely droughty year of 2007, the starch content of hybrids (73.0%) exceeded the average value measured in 2008 (72.4%), which had a much more favorable precipitation supply, but the precipitation shortage during the spring and the vegetation period and water stress resulting from it ended up in a low average starch yield (1.57 t ha -1 ). As opposed to this, much higher average starch content per hectare (7.7 t ha -1 ) was obtained in 2008, in rather favorable weather conditions. The increasing fertilizer doses significantly decreased the starch content per dry matter units in both years. The highest starch content was obtained in non-fertilized control plots, whereas the lowest values were registered on plots on which N fertilizer doses</p><p id="Pg88">VIII.

Nevertheless, fertilization had an adverse effect on starch yield per hectare. The fertilizer doses increased the starch yield of hybrids parallel with the increase of grain yield, the maximum value was obtained in 2008, in the case of 240 kg ha -1 N. The extremely dry crop year of 2007 provided adverse results to those published in the specialized literature, because fertilization reliably increased starch yield only to a dose of 120 kg ha -1 N, the highest dose (240 kg ha -1 ) significantly decreased it (Figure 1). 70 71 72 73 74 75 N 0 N 120 N 240 Fertilization (kg ha-1) S ta rc h c o n te n t (% ) 2007 2008 0 2 4 6 8 10 N 0 N 120 N 240 Fertilization (kg ha-1) S ta rc h y ie ld ( t h a -1 ) 2007 2008 Figure 1. Corn starch content and starch yield response to different N rates (Debrecen-Látókép, 2007-2008) As a result of the fertilization treatments applied during the experiment, different results of starch yield per hectare was obtained for every type of hybrids. Based on our results, the optimal treatment combinations could be determined that made it possible to achieve higher starch yield per hectare. In 2007, the highest starch yield was obtained with the hybrids Mv Tarján and Mv Koppány in moisture-saving shallow spring tillage with a N dose (120 kg ha -1 ). The results were 2.96 and 2.93 t ha -1 , respectively. The higher fertilizer dose significantly decreased starch yield values. It also reinforces the observations and practical experience gained so far about adaptive, moisture-saving tillage. As a result of this tillage method, the advantage of the moisture surplus stored in soil will be revealed in extremely dry and droughty crop years, because there will be a lot more water available for maize development in the critical period when there is shortage of water. In 2008, the best treatment combination proved to be the winter plowing when applying N fertilizer dose of 120 kg ha -1 in the case of ED 5110 hybrid (8.42 t ha -1 ). The N fertilizer dose 240 kg ha -1 further increased starch yield (9.25 t ha -1 ), but this dose cannot be applied either from environmental protection aspects, or from economical causes. The protein content of the examined hybrids was between 9-12% in the droughty year of 2007, whereas it was lower (8-10%) in 2008, despite the high yields obtained as a result of the favorable crop year. 72-74% starch content was measured in 2007, whereas they were lower (71-73%) in 2008. The examination results of the two year also reinforce the fact that there is a negative correlation between these two factors. Linear regression was applied to describe the relationship between these two parameters. The linear functions characterize the relationship between protein and starch content reliably.</p><p id="Pg89">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Relationship between the corn protein and starch content (A) and between the corn yield and the starch content (B) (Debrecen-Látókép, 2007-2008) Based on the high r 2 values (0.72 and 0.82), the fitting of regression lines was good in both years (Figure 2/A). When assessing the relationship between the grain yield and starch content of maize, it was stated that a rather weak correlation can be shown between the two parameters on the basis of the r 2 values in 2008. Nevertheless, the negative correlation did not prevail at all in 2007, therefore the starch content of grains increased parallel with the increase of hybrid yields. At the same time, the alignment of the regression line to the data is rather weak (r 2 = 0.08), the correlation between the two factors is not significant (Figure 2/B). Conclusions Based on our results, optimal treatment combinations can be determined that can be used to maximalize starch yield per hectare in both droughty and wet crop seasons. In the water-stressed crop season of 2007, the highest starch yield was obtained in moisture-saving shallow spring tillage at 120 kg ha -1 N dose. The higher fertilizer dose significantly decreased starch yield values. In 2008, the best treatment combination proved to be the winter plowing when applying N fertilizer dose of 120 kg ha -1 . The N fertilizer dose of 240 kg ha -1 further increased starch yield, but this dose cannot be applied either from environmental protection aspects, or from economical causes. All these could serve as an important argument during the development of a production technology guideline.

The safety of wheat production requires the propagation of drought tolerant cultivars. Hybridization between related species makes it possible to transfer desirable traits from one species into another. Barley - known to have good drought tolerance - is a potential gene source for wheat improvement. Lines developed from wheat/barley hybrids were investigated to determine how the added barley chromosomes (segments) influence drought tolerance in wheat. Data were obtained for anthesis- and maturity date, plant height, root/shoot ratio and components of grain yield. On the basis of our data new lines with valuable agronomic traits can be selected which could be used in wheat breeding programs and consequently in wheat production. Keywords: wheat-barley translocation, addition, substitution lines, drought tolerance Introduction Agricultural production is limited primarily by environmental stresses among those the most important is water deficiency. The efficient use of water stored in soil has special significance. Annual precipitation in Hungary will not be more in the future and its unfavorable spatial and time distribution will even be less favorable (Várallyay, 2008). The primary approach for alleviation of environmental stresses focused on modification of the environment. These are, however, expensive and effective only in the short run, contemporaneously loading the environment. Economic and ecological constraints make the approach of genetic improvement of stress tolerance a viable alternative. Differences were found between genotypes regarding their tolerance to environmental stress, allowing selection to be made for better tolerance (Balla et al., 2006). Limited soil moisture influences nutrient availability for plants. Pepó and Balogh (2008) found that advantageous water supply decreased the optimum nutrient level of the cultivars. Hybridization between related species makes it possible to transfer desirable traits from one species into another. Barley - known to have good drought tolerance - is a potential gene source for wheat improvement. The introgression of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome segments into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) may result in the transfer of new, useful traits, such as earliness, tolerance of drought and soil salinity or various traits for specific nutritional quality into wheat. Since the first successful hybridization between wheat and barley (Kruse 1973) only a few wheat-barley translocation and substitution lines have been developed (Islam and Shepherd 1992; Koba et al. 1997; Molnár-Láng et al. 2000a.) and were investigated regarding cytogenetic characteristics and fertility (D. Nagy et al. 2002; Szakács and Molnár-Láng, 2007.). Even less information is available on the ability of barley chromosomes to compensate for wheat chromosomes regarding agronomically important characteristics and there is no information available on the behaviour of wheat-barley derivates grown on the field.</p><p id="Pg91">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 94 The aim of our study was to determine how the added barley chromosome (segments) influence various agronomic traits in wheat. Materials and methods Two wheat/barley addition (2H, 3H) and one translocation line (7D-5HS) produced from the 'Mv9kr1' × 'Igri' hybrid (Molnár-Láng et al. 2000b), and one substitution [4H (4D)] and two translocation lines (3HS.3BL, 6B-4H) orginating from the ‘Chinese Spring’ × ‘Betzes’ hybrid (Molnár-Láng et al. 2000a) developed in Martonvásár with the parental cultivars together were investigated. The field experiment was carried out at UP Georgikon Faculty, Keszthely, during 20072008. The soil of the experimental site is a lessivated brown forest soil (FAO: Luvic phaosem) with low organic material, medium K- and P content. Row space was 30 cm. Each genotype was sown in a 15m long row. The half length of the rows were covered with a plastic folia on 21th of April (EC: 30-31) to protect plants from rain (Picture 1) indicating 180 mm difference in water supply between control (not cowered) and stress (cowered) treatment. Sowing and harvest was made with hand. Data were obtained for dates of ontogenesis (EUCARPIA decimal code for growth stages), plant height, root/shoot ratio at EC 30-31, leaf water potential (ΨL: was determined in a pressure chamber – PMS Instrument – with N2 gas), ear length, thousand grain weight, number of kernels, and grain yield. Results and discussion At tillering (EC 30-31) 6 plants of each genotype were grubbed up and length and mass of root and shoot were measured. From point of drought tolerance root length and root/shoot ratio are important characteristics. The larger root biomass could contribute to an increased drought tolerance (Hoffmann and Burucs, 2005). All wheat-barley derivates had longer roots and shorter shoots than the wheat parent resulting in an even more increased root/shoot ratio (Figure 1). The mean of lines was 47%, while the root/shoot ratio of the parents was 22- and 41% for wheat and barley respectively.

The barley parent Igri lost 7- and the wheat parent Mv9kr1 12% of its control’s yield. But it is not enough to consider only the decrease of yield, we have to take into account the absolute values as well to become a more sophisticated conclusion. Lines 3H and 4H (4D) had the smallest yield in both treatment, while 3BL.3HS over yielded the wheat parent, though it has lost 20% of it’s controls yield (Figure 3). Conclusions Six addition, substitution and translocation lines developed from wheat-barley hybrid were investigated in a field experiment to determine how the added barley chromosomes (segments) influence drought tolerance in wheat. Plants adapted to water deficiency by intensifying root growth and at the same time by the retention of shoot growth, resulting in a relative increase of root/shoot ratio. But the retention of shoot growth causes the decrease of assimilating leaf area which resulted in yield losses. During drought stress the water potential of the plant decreased, that can be considered as osmotic adaptation. The use of these genetic material in wheat breeding programs can result in new varieties with better drought tolerance.

We have evaluated the crop yield and the pathologic reaction of sunflower hybrids in two years with different amount of precipitation (2007 and 2008), at three sowing times (end of march, middle of april, beginning of may) and at 4 crop density levels (35000 plant ha-1-65000 plant ha-1). The soil of the research site was calcaleorus chernozem and no irrigation was applied. We found that at the average of the hybrids, crop density levels and sowing times the crop yield was higher (4390 kg ha-1) in the dryer year of 2007 than in the crop year of 2008 (4051 kg ha-1), when the amount of precipitation was higher but its distribution was rather extreme. In the year of 2007 the sowing time in the middle of april resulted the highest yield at the average of the hybrids and crop density levels (4664 kg ha-1), while in the year of 2008 the sowing time in the beginning of may resulted the highest yield (4362 kg ha-1). The maximum crop yield was resulted at the lower (45000-55000 plant ha-1 ) crop density level in the humid year (2008), while in the dryer year (2007) the highest yield was resulted at the higher (55000-65000 plant ha-1 ) crop density level. The extent of stalk lodging and the infection by Diaporte, Sclerotinia and head diseases was different in the years. The Diaporhte infection of sunflower hybrids was 2-47 % in 2007, and it was 17-72 % in 2008. The Sclerotinia infection of sunflower hybrids was 1,1-13,9 % in 2007, and it was 0,1-3,9 % in 2008. Stalk bending and the infection by the examined diseases increased with the increase of crop density levels (from 35000 plant ha-1 to 65000 plant ha-1). As regards the examined factors, we found significant differences among the hybrids. Our results proved that the different genotype sunflower hybrids have good abiotic (water deficiency) stress tolerance compared to other filed crops. Keywords: sunflower, crop year, plant density, sowing time, infection, yield Introduction Besides cereals and maize, sunflower has the largest growing area among crops in Hungary (LEHOCZKY and SÁRKÁNY 2007; MIJIC et al. 2007). Sunflower has very good adaptation ability. It adapts well to relatively unfavourable weather conditions (BÍRÓ and PEPÓ 2008). The effects of year and the global climate change (VÁRALLYAY 2007) manifest both in the amount of yield and in yield safety (BIRKÁS et al. 2006). The year has a decisive influence on the amount of yield, however, this effect varies with the hybrid (BORBÉLYNÉ et al. 2008). The yield of sunflower varies significantly among the years and genotypes (GÖKSOY and TURAN 2007). The agroclimatic factors have the most significant effect on the yield of sunflower hybrids, while the effect of the hybrid assortment is less strong. The incidence of diseases and the degree of their intensity are significantly determined by the hybrid assortment and the agroclimatic conditions of the year (temperature, the amount and distribution of precipitation) (BRANIMIR et al. 2008). ZSOMBIK (2008) found that the largest yields were obtained at the early sowing time (3913 kg ha --1 ), while the yields were lower at the standard sowing time (3865 kg ha -1 ) and the lowest yields were measured at the late sowing time in May (3422 kg ha -1 ) for the hybrids involved in the experiment. According to PEPÓ and SZABÓ (2005), the response of sunflower hybrids to increasing plant density is influenced by both the year and the genotype. Increasing plant density results in a higher infection of pathogens.</p><p id="Pg95">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 98 Materials and methods The experiment was carried out in the Hajdúság loess region at Experimental Station of Látókép in 2007 and 2008. The experimental plots were set up in four replications in a randomized block design. The hybrids were grown at four plant densities (35000-65000 plants ha -1 ) with 10000 plants ha -1 differences between the groups. The sunflower hybrids were sown at early (end of March), standard (mid-April), and late (beginning of May) sowing times. When analyzing the weather of the experimental years, it can be stated that 2008 was more rainy than 2007 regarding the whole year, however, the distribution of precipitation was uneven, the amount of rain was less in May and August and twice higher in the summer (June and July) than the average of 30 years. Results and discussion The abiotic (climate) requirements of sunflower hybrids are different from those of other field crops. Due to the significant susceptibility to fungal diseases and the good draught tolerance, the highest yields can be obtained in dry years on chernozem soils. In this paper, we present the results of the experiments with the newest hybrids for 2007 and 2008. Regarding the experimental years, higher yields were obtained in 2007 due to the dry weather more favourable for sunflower than in 2008 which was more wet with an unfavourable distribution of precipitation. The amount of yield calculated as an average of the different sowing times and plant densities was 4390 kg ha -1 in 2007 and 4051 kg ha -1 in 2008. In 2007, the highest yields were obtained at the plant densities of 55000 plants ha -1 (NK Delfi, PR64D82, ES petúnia) and 65000 plants ha -1 (NK Dolbi, ES Albatre), except for the hybrid PR64A04 (4926 kg ha -1 at 45000 plants ha -1 ). In 2008, the plant density of 55000 plants ha -1 proved to be optimal in the average of the sowing times except for the hybrids NK Delfi (4720 kg ha -1 ) and NK Kondi (4539 kg ha -1 ). In both years, the maximum yield was obtained at the plant density of 55000 plants ha -1 in the average of the hybrids (4626 kg ha -1 in 2007, 4325 kg ha -1 in 2008), which was lower in 2008 due to the more rainy weather and the resulting greater phytopathological pressure. Due to the differing weather conditions, the optimum sowing time of hybrids varied with the year. In 2007, the largest yield was obtained with the mid-April sowing time for most of the hybrids (except for the hybrid PR64A04). When applying the late sowing time, the yield was lower due to the shortening of the vegetation period of sunflower. In 2008, the vegetation period was prolonged by the significant amount of rain in the middle of the season (140.1 mm in June, 144.9 mm in July), consequently, the largest yields were obtained with the late sowing time (early May) for all hybrids in contrast to the previous results and the lowest yields were measured in the case of the standard sowing time. The largest yields were obtained with the standard sowing time in 2007 (4664 kg ha -1 ) and with the late sowing time in 2008 (4362 kg ha -1 ) in the average of the hybrids and the plant densities. The largest yield was measured for the hybrids PR64A04 (4926 kg ha -1 ) and NK Delfi (4720 kg ha -1 ) at 45000 plants ha -1 plant density in the average of sowing times in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The largest yield in the average of plant densities was measured for the hybrid ES Albatre (4909 kg ha -1 ) with standard sowing time and for NK Delfi (4740 kg ha -1 ) with the late sowing time in 2007 and 2008, respectively (Table 1).</p><p id="Pg96">VIII.

With increasing plant density, the average Diaporthe infestation increased from 9% to 26% and from 31% to 49% in 2007 and 2008, respectively, in the average of hybrids and sowing times. Infection by Sclerotinia was lower in 2007. Even at a plant density of 65000 plants ha -1 , it was only 1.6 %, while it was over 8% in 2008. In the average of the tested hybrids, the infection by head diseases increased from 6.5% to 16.4% and from 18.8% to 33.1% in 2007 and 2008, respectively, when plant density was increased. As a result of increasing plant densities, the degree of lodging increased from 3.1 % to 12.8 % and from 5.3 % to 25.6 % in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Table 2.

Cereal Research Communications 100 When evaluating the tested sunflower hybrids in the average of sowing times and plant densities, we found that the largest yields were obtained for the hybrids NK Delfi and ES Albatre (4537 kg ha -1 ) in 2007. The hybrid ES Albatre had the lowest infection values among the hybrids regarding lodging (5.4 %), head diseases (8.5 %), Sclerotinia (0.8 %) and Diaporthe (7.2 %). The highest values of lodging and infection were measured for the hybrids PR64D82, NK Dolbi and NK Delfi. The highest yield was obtained for the hybrid NK Delfi (4415 kg ha -1 ) in 2008, however, its values of lodging (16.9 %) and head diseases (29.6 %) were among the highest ones. The yield of the hybrid PR64D82 was the lowest (3860 kg ha -1 ), while its values of lodging (18.3 %), head disease infection (28.6 %), Sclerotinia infection (7.1 %) and Diaporthe infection (48 %) were the highest among the hybrids (Table 2). Conclusions In the drier year of 2007, the yield was higher in the average of hybrids, plant densities and sowing times (4390 kg ha -1 ) than in the more wet year of 2008 with more extreme rain distribution (4051 kg ha -1 ). In 2007, the largest yield was obtained with the midApril sowing time in the average of the hybrids and plant densities (4664 kg ha -1 ), while in 2008, the early May sowing time resulted in the highest yield (4362 kg ha -1 ). For the tested hybrids, the maximum yield was obtained at a lower plant density of 4500055000 plants ha -1 in the more wet year (2008) and at a higher plant density of 5500065000 plants ha -1 in the drier year (2007). The degree of lodging, Diaporthe, Sclerotinia and head disease infection differed between the years. The degree of lodging and infestation by the studied diseases increased with increasing plant densities (from 35000 plants ha -1 to 65000 plants ha -1 ). There were great differences among the hybrids regarding the studied agronomical and phytopathological factors. Based on the studied parameters, the hybrids ES Albatre, NK Delfi and NK Kondi proved to be the best. References Birkás M. – Dexter A.

Budapest, Hungary; krvegh@rissac.hu 2Institute of Environment Science, Faculty of Horticulture, Kecskemet College, Erdei F. sq 1-3., 6000. Kecskemét, Hungary Abstract: Both for economic considerations and risk assessment it is essential to quantify abiotic stress conditions and evaluate their impact on yield for a given environment or for possible scenarios. We applied simulation modeling to quantify stress by its level, time, duration and dynamics on irrigated tomato culture. The dynamics of photosynthetic response function to (1) soil water stress (expressed as daily values of the ratio of actual and potential transpiration), (2) nitrogen availability (leaf C/N ratio) and (3) temperature stress, as well as to their combined effect was determined. Sudden events of high temperature, transient water deficiencies and gradually ongoing N depletion restricted tomato growth. Sensitivity of the system decreased in late development and response functions differed between the soils. Keywords: abiotic stress, response function, water and nitrogen supply, temperature, tomato, COUP model Introduction In agricultural systems the exposure of crops to abiotic stress is generally unavoidable since growth conditions in most field environments are suboptimal. Crop productivity is controlled by the interactions of the genotype of crops, their environment and the management practices, since it depends on the physiological functions in response to the environment. Water and/or nitrogen deficiency may impact on crop yield substantially due to the changing physiological processes before the appearance of deficiency symptoms (Česká et al. 2008), therefore to realize stress in due time and minimize its effects may be essential even if proceeded in the late development of the crop. The quality of the final marketable product may be affected too; for example wheat and maize quality parameters have been shown to depend upon genotype and environmental factors (Fónad et al. 2008; Hegyi et al 2008). Szalay et al. (2008) reported that milling and baking quality of wheat was highly affected by the climate and soil conditions. Kassai et al (2008) found that both the amount and the distribution of precipitation had crucial effect on wheat yield and quality parameters. Quality concerns are still more expressed in vegetable production, where the control of the quality parameters of fresh vegetables and other high value horticulture products is essential to realize them on a right price in the market. With physiologically balanced complete nutrition, careful water supply and temperature optimization the visual attributes, size (or weight), shape and color and, “freshness” as well as the taste and nutritive value of the products can be generally improved in order to meet the main commercial criteria (Fabek et al. 2008, Ledencan et al, 2008, Svoboda et al. 2008). However, N nutrition of irrigated vegetables is often hazardous concerning both the nutritive value of the product and the production environment (Neeteson, 1995, Linker et al. 2005,Vázquez et al. 2006). Both for economic considerations and risk assessment it is essential to quantify water and nitrogen stress conditions and evaluate their impact on yield and quality for a given environment or for possible scenarios (Árendás et al. 2008, Sulyok et al. 2008). Simulation modeling helps making the decisions in crop management before severe deficiency symptoms appear, by the designation and characterization of abiotic stress.</p><p id="Pg99">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 102 In the approach based on systems ecology (Bouman et al, 1996) the state of the system can be expressed at any point in time with the changes of it can be expressed through mathematical terms. Crop yield is defined as a function of biomass and harvest index, where biomass is a function of growth and development. Harvest index, growth, as well as development are a function of stress and genetics; the latter two are controlled by environmental factors controlling photosynthesis, as solar radiation or temperature. Generally, the main growth-limiting, abiotic stress factors are drought and N deficiency as well as temperature extremes (Hoogenboom, 2003, Jansson and Karlberg, 2003). The objective of our study is the application of simulation modeling to quantify stress by its level, time, duration and dynamics in irrigated tomato culture, by response functions used in crop growth models. Materials and methods In the experimental station of Kecskemét College four nitrogen levels (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha -1 of N) were created in soils with different texture filled in lysimeters with 0.6 m height and diameter in 2006. Before planting 60 kg of N was applied as Cropcare (N:P:K = 10:10:20) slow release fertilizer, the additional amounts were added as ammonium-nitrate top dressing 3 and 6 weeks after planting. Two tomato plants were grown per lysimeter and watered by a drip irrigation system from the end of May till early October. Experimental details are reported by (Végh et al., 2007) and (Végh et al., 2009). The results presented here have been obtained in the N120 nitrogen treatment on sandy soil (S1: 94.7% sand, 2.66% clay, 0.64% organic matter content (OM), pH=7.8) and clay loam soil (S3: 26.63% sand, 42.08% clay, 2,72% OM, pH=7.40). The COUP model that consists of the SOIL and SOILN models (Jansson and Karlberg, 2003) has been used for the simulation. SOIL water and heat model simulates soil moisture dynamics and provides driving variables for the soil N transport and crop growth model SOILN. Here total plant growth Catm is proportional to the radiation absorbed by canopy (Rspl), but limited by unfavorable conditions of temperature: f(Ta), nitrogen (=C/N ratio in the leaf: f(CNleaf)) and water (=f(Eta/Etp): the ratio of potential to actual evapotranspiration) represented by functions ranging between zero and unity as: spltptaleafaLaAtm REEfCNfTfC )/()()(ε=→ where εL is the radiation use efficiency. Driving variables for SOIL model (daily meteorological data) were measured in the experimental site. Soils were sampled at the beginning and at the end of growth, and analyzed for total and mineral N. Also soil hydraulic properties were evaluated. CS615 moisture sensors with data loggers were buried in the 10-40 cm soil depth to monitor the moisture content. The above ground parts of crops were sampled four times during growth and four harvests of fruits were done to determine the development of leaf area, the accumulation of biomass and N content in shoot and fruit. Experimental data was analyzed using twoways ANOVA. The measured and derived growth parameters were used in the parameter optimization of the growth model. The SOIL model outputs were fitted on the volumetric moisture content of the soil monitored by the sensors. SOILN model outputs were fitted on the yield, and crop N uptake data. The model parameter set finely tuned on the soil moisture and crop data was then used to simulate N dynamics in the soil and evaluate the dynamics of the response functions.</p><p id="Pg100">VIII.

Total N uptake of crop varied between 90-350 kg ha -1 in S1 and 184-330 kg ha -1 in S3 soil and was 271 kg ha -1 and 304 kg ha -1 in the S1N120 and S3N120 treatments respectively. Figure 1. Dynamics of response functions for the temperature: f(T), N: f(N) and water: f(W) stress as well as their combined effect: f(Tot) on tomato growth in sandy (left) and clay loam soil (right) in N120 treatment. The dynamic weather-soil-crop system is continually changing. Sensitivity is changing with stages of development and response differs between soils as shown in Figure 1. Sudden events of high temperature, transient water deficiencies and gradually ongoing N depletion restricted photosynthesis. Average daily temperature had exceeded 25 o C several times in June and July and inhibited growth. Irrigation that started on June 22 improved water supply. In the sandy soil from the mid of August N availability became the main constraint to growth (Figure 1). According to the final nitrogen balance, crop exploited 118 % of the total mineral nitrogen input (involving atmospheric deposition, fertilizer and soil initial mineral N content) in sandy soil whereas in clay loam only the 77% of its N input was taken up. N shortage was compensated by the more intensified N translocation from leaves to the fruits reflected in the much higher leaf litter fall compared to the clay loam during the last two months (not shown). Crop with the lower growth rate and smaller leaf area transpired less water in sandy soil and could satisfied water demand even in this coarse texture soil with unfavorable hydraulic properties. On the contrary the higher transpiration rate due to higher N supply caused transient occurrences of water deficiency stress and limitation of photosynthetic activity on clay loam soil, though available water was not completely depleted in the root zone. Considering N balance of the systems the role of nitrogen mineralization cannot be overestimated. In the COUP model simulated microbial processes are also affected by soil temperature, moisture content and pH. In the irrigated an N fertilized system the total release of N from organic form substantially contributed to N uptake of tomato crop even in the sandy soil as it is clearly shown by the final N balance. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 7-May 4-Jun 2-Jul 30-Jul 27-Aug 24-Sep f(T) f(Tot) f(N) f(W) 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 7-May 4-Jun 2-Jul 30-Jul 27-Aug 24-Sep f(T) f(Tot) f(N) f(W)</p><p id="Pg101">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Trial material was consisting of six sunflower hybrids that were grown on majority of sunflower’s fields in Croatia. Trial was conducted on trial-field situated in Kneževi Vinogradi (Baranja region). Honey bees were transported in Langstroth-Rooth (LR) beehives to the trial-field; three days before sunflower’s blooming. Impact of honey bee on selection and production traits of sunflower was expressed as a difference between results gained by free pollination and results under the condition of isolation. The most important pollinator of sunflower is a honey bee. Weather conditions (air temperature, relative air humidity and rainfalls) considerably influenced activities of honey bees during sunflower blooming. Honey bees were mostly active during the days without rain, at air temperature from 23 to 26 oC and relative air humidity from 65 to 75 %. The most attractive hybrid for honey bee was hybrid H4. Presence of pollinators resulted in improvement of selection and production traits of sunflower: number of flowers per head, number of full up field grains per head, percentage of pollination, 1000 kernel weight, hectolitre mass, oil content and oil yield. Considerable economic rationale was determined for the introduction of pollination with honey bee in agriculture practice. Keywords: honey bee, sunflower, yield components Introduction Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is a very important plant for agricultural industry. Global agricultural land under the sunflower is 22.6 million ha, and it increased for around 1.85 million ha during the last decade (FAOSTAT database, 2005). Sunflower production in Croatia is present at 30,000 ha, and is characterised in high fluctuations in the area and yield. Production is mainly placed in the Eastern Croatia, which belongs to the Panonian region, mainly due to favourable precipitation regime in comparison to other parts of Croatia (Liović et al., 2006). Main objectives in sunflower production are reaching high yield of the kernel and oil (Szabo and Pepo, 2007). These traits are quantitative traits and, beside genotype, large influence on their expression has environment and genotype vs. environment interaction (Hunyadi-Borbeli and Lesznyak, 2006; Mijić et al., 2007). Other traits, directly or indirectly related with kernel and oil yield, also influencing successful sunflower production (Goksoy and Turan, 2007). The presence of pollinator is among these traits. Due to allogamy, sunflower developed specific flower structure, pollinated by insects. Pollination of sunflower in presence of insects improved kernel yield (Miklič, 1996). Aim of this research work is to evaluate impact of pollinator’s presence at examined hybrids, and expression of most important selection and production traits. Materials and methods Research work was conducted at trial-field situated near Kneževi Vinogradi in Baranja region (450 46’ 13.70’’ N, 180 44’ 24.34’’ E), during 2002 year.</p><p id="Pg103">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 106 Soil type is eutric cambisol, pH 7.1 in KCl, with good supply of nutrients. Maize was grown on this field a year before. Main soil tillage cultivation in autumn was consisted of fertilization with 250 kg ha -1 NPK 7:20:30 and 100 kg ha -1 urea (46% N), and of ploughing on 30 cm depth. Fertilization before sowing was with 150 kg ha -1 NPK 15:15:15. Protection against diseases was done by Konkerom (vinklozolin+karbendazim). Sowing date was 26th April, with final plant density of 57 143 plants ha -1 . Trial material consisted of six sunflower hybrids (H1-H6) prevailing in sunflower growing in Croatia. Length of trials was 300 m, and each hybrid was sown in eight rows (0.7 m between rows and 0.25 m within rows). Honey bees were transported in Langstroth-Rooth (LR) beehives to the trial-field, three days before sunflower’s blooming (phase R3 according to Schneiter and Miller, 1981). Strength of transported honey bee colonies was adequate to strength of honey bee colonies prepared for pollination of planted crops (McGregor, 1976). Four honey bee colonies per hectare were placed at the start of trial plot, with an aim of equal exposition of hybrids to the honey bees. Isolation of sunflower’s heads was done in phase R3 (according to Schneiter and Miller, 1981). Presence of honey bees was counted at 9, 11, 13 and 17 hours, within the distance of 100, 200 and 300 m from beehives. Amount of insuficently filled and fully field kernels was measured by hand; weight of 1000 kernels was measured with instrument Contador; hectolitre mass with instrument Dickey Yohn (model GAC 2000 grain analysis computer); yield was counted on 9% of moisture, and oil content in kernels was determined with Newport 4000 NMR analyzer. Oil yield in dry matter for control and treated groups were counted on the basis of kernel yield and content of oil in kernels. Impact of honey bee on selection and production traits of sunflower was expressed as a difference between results gained in free pollination and results under the condition of isolation. Results and discussion The mostly present pollinator on sunflower (99.53%) was honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica L.), followed by bumblebee (Bombus spp.) with 0.32%, and fly (Diptera, family: Syrphidae) with 0.15%. These results are in accordance with the research work of Miklič (1992). Different results were presented by Arbol (1996) and Singh and Singh (1999). In their research, bumblebee was the mostly present (34%), and honey bee (Apis cerana) was second one (26%). Data in Table 1. shows that hybrid H4 had the highest, and H2 the lowest presence of honey bees. Significant differences were not found between other hybrids. Table 1.

Influence of air temperature and relative air humidity on honey bee’s presence during sunflower blooming During sunflower blooming, an average daily temperature was from 19.9 to 27.5 o C, relative air humidity was 65-88%, with 16.1 mm of rainfalls in total. According to Figure 1., highest activity of honey bees was at air temperature of 23 to 26 o C, and relative air humidity from 65 to 75 %. During the trials, three days with rain had occurred; on 4th and 7th July rain was falling during the day. Night rainfall was on 8th July, and during the day it does not influenced any of honey bee’s activity. The lowest presence of honey bees was during the days with local showers. Total absence of honey bees was on 7th July, due to all-day rainfall. Miklič (1996), Sihag and Khatkar (1999) concludes that the highest activity of honey bees is at air temperature of 20-28 o C and relative air humidity of 50-75%. They also determined that higher or lower values of these parameter significantly influence activities of the honey bees. Rainfalls during the day considerably influence activity of honey bees, because they do not fly during the rain (Miklič, 1996). Research work showed complexicity of the relation between honey bee and flower. Delaplane and Mayer (2000) stressed the significance of the length of tube flower’s corolla as a favourable or unfavourable for honey bee’s presence, in connection with the length of bee’s mouth part. Kevan (2001) pointing out statistically significant differences between the quality and quantity of pollen and nectar among hybrids. According to the author, this traits are very important for the presence of honey bees. Hybrid H4 was the most attractive hybrid for the honey bees, while hybrid H2 was the least attractive. Between other four hybrids there were no differences for the intensity of the presence of honey bees. Impacts of pollination with honey bee on the selection and production traits of sunflower are presented in Table 2. Amount of flower per head under the condition of free pollination is higher for 132 flowers in average, than under the conditions of isolation. Also, number of fully filed kernels per head is higher (for 525.5 kernels in average), and percentage of pollination is higher for 27.61%. Under the conditions of free pollination, hectolitre mass is higher for 3.6 kg, 1000 kernel weight for 2.6 g, oil content 1.41% higher and oil yield is 49.99 kg ha -1 higher. Results are indicating that application of pollination with honey bee in agricultural practice considerably improved all measured traits. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 temperature (oC) nu m be r o f b e es 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0 20 40 60 80 100 relative air hunidity (%) n u m b er o f b ee s</p><p id="Pg105">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The highest activity of honey bees was at air temperature 23-26 o C and relative air humidity 65-75 %, in the days without rain. The most attractive hybrid for honey bee was H4, while hybrid H2 was the least attractive. Differences in the intensity of the presence of honey bees were not found between other four hybrids. Pollination with honey bee under described weather conditions has positive impact on improvement of selection and production traits of sunflower, recognized in following: number of flowers per head, number of fully field kernels per head, percentage of pollination, hectoliter mass, 1000 kernel weight, oil content in kernels, and oil yield in dry matter. Application of pollination of sunflower with honey bee in agricultural practice have considerable economic rationale. References Abrol, D.P.: 1996.

Abstract: The yield in grasslands is determined by the ecological conditions such as soil, climate, height above sea-level, weather but mostly the amount and distribution of precipitation. The yield can be increased by using different grassland management elements (grassland usage, fertilizing, weed control). In our experiment, two different locations with different dispersion of precipitation were examined. We simulated 3 types of grassland usage (2, 3, 4 utilisation per year) with the same method in both places, without fertilisation. The 2-times utilisation mean a late first (the third decade of June) and an autumn mowing. The simulation of the 3-times utilisation meant a sampling in the third decade of May, the end of July and at the beginning of October. The 4-times utilisation meant a May, end of June, end of July and at beginning of October mowing. Our main conclusions on relations between the yield of dry matter, stress of moisture, annual effect and intensity of utilisation are the followings: The complete annual dry matter yield of the Festuca pseudovinetum vegetation, dry located natural grasslands was highly influenced by the total amount and dispersion of precipitation in the examined 2 years. The amount of increments depended on the dispersion of precipitation. Independently from the annual effect the extensive grassland usage produces the highest yield of dry matter. On the planted moist meadow the more intensive utilisation (3 mowing/year) caused a better yield. The reaction to the irregularities of dispersion of precipitation (stress of moisture) was the more difference between harvest amounts. Keywords: grassland, stress of moisture, intensity of utilisation Introduction Grassland management is Hungary’s third-largest type of soil usage. 1 million ha is covered by grasses. Grass is an essential of mass feed production and environmental protection. The grass species are shallow-rooted, have a large evapotranspiration surface and we urge it to sprout continuously by pasturage and mowing (Nagy 2006). Because of these, grass has a significant water demand and is sensitive to any water-stress (Czövek et al. 2006). Moreover, the evapotranspiration is higher when the air is warm, the vapour level is low and there is an intensive sunshine, so in the middle of summertime the heat-stress must be considered (Balla et al. 2006; Mészáros et al. 2006). The increasing level of CO2 in the air which reduces the competitiveness of grass species against the dicotyledonous weeds is also an addition (Anda et al. 2006). As an effect of the climate change, the crop of grasses could highly reduce in the Carpathian basin, the scorching period could lengthen (Dobó et al. 2006; Mikulec et al. 2006; Várallyay 2007;). In pastures, shady areas must be provided to allow animals avoid the heat-stress (Pajor et al. 2007; 2008). New grassland-management tools required to adapt to the different, changed conditions. To find the new possibilities and show the damage to grasses caused by the water- and heat-stress, we’ve made experiments at two locations examining two different types of grasses between 2006 and 2008.</p><p id="Pg107">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 110 Materials and methods The two flat grounded locations in an experiment made in the years 2006 and 2007 a Festuca arundinaceatum vegetation, formerly planted, valley-located, moist meadow (in Mende) and a saline grassland, dry located, Festuca pseudovinetum vegetation pasture (in Bösztör) were examined. There is organic farming in both locations without using artificial fertilizers. In the autumn of 2006 we simulated the manure dropped by grazing animals with the same mass of manure, because there was mowing in the experiment only. We searched for the less yield deficiency, caused by water- and heatstress in case of which intensity of utilisation, what divergences are between the different grass types. The examined three intensity of utilisation and management were the followings: Table 1. Timetable of the experiment 2 cut *year -1 3 cut *year -1 4 cut *year -1 1st increment 19th Jun. 17th May 17th May 2nd increment 10th Oct. 28th Jul. 19th Jun. 3rd increment 10th Oct. 28th Jul. 4th increment 10th Oct. The experiments were made in 3 repetitive periods, each time with coenological inclusion and samples were taken to define nutritive substance content. The laboratory analyses were made in Austria (Raumberg-Gumpenstein). Soil investigation was made in the beginning and at the end of the trial. Results and discussion According to the analysed data of rainfall in two years, there were approximately 14% less rain in both locations (Table 2). Table 2.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 111 In addition, the temperature sum in Bösztör was 11%; in Mende was 12% higher in 2007. We should have experienced a yield decrease in 2007 in both locations in effect to the water shortage and the heat-stress. As the data of Table 3 shows, the dry material yield of Bösztör pasturage had a real decrease; in case of 2 cuts per year 60%, in case of 3 cuts per year 55%, in case of 4 cuts per year was 77% of the previous year. Despite of that, we found a yield increase in Mende at all mowing versions. As we have a look at the distribution of precipitation data, we can see that the spring precipitation at Mende in 2007 was significantly less, which held back the increments cut in May (1 st increment of 3 and 4 cuts per year). On the other hand, there was more rainfall in May and September and that’s why the summer and autumn increments could grow better. As a result of less but more equal precipitation of 2007, the more intensively used grassland (3 and 4 cuts per year) produced a 16-20% more yield. Because of that, the correlation analysis made by SPSS 15 statistic programme did not show any significant year-effect. As we examine the effect of intensity of utilisation, we can clearly see that reactions of grass types are different but the extensive usage (2 cuts per year) resulted a significantly higher yearly dry material yield than the intensive one. The first cut of the 2 cuts per year is late so the grasses start to grow a stem and the percentage of first increments is high. The first increment can use the stored winter precipitation and because of the spring temperature sum and the sunshine the evaporation is lower. So in the extensive usage system the grass can adapt better and can equalize the negative effects of water and heat-stress. Table 3.

That’s what the results in Bösztör in 2007 show when the outstanding rainfall in August could be used better by the more intensively used grassland and the 4 cuts per year delivered a significantly higher yield. Conclusions The distribution of precipitation, the amount of precipitation per one increment has a higher effect on the dry material yield of the grasses than the yearly sum of precipitation. This is especially true on intensively used grasses. The distribution of precipitation could not be exactly expected, so in the regions becoming more extreme-weathered in an effect of the climate change, the extensive grassland management means a safer yield. Further questions appear from the following definition: The 2 cuts per year usage do not satisfy the needs of the grazing grassland usage, the extensive usage means a lower feed value.

Water supply is important for yield quantity and quality. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the canopy temperature and the yield on processing tomato substances with different water supply. There were two treatments, one of them was the irrigated plant material which got 333 mm water, including the precipitation and the other was the cut off substance which means the watering was stopped at the beginning of the ripening process, there was a control as well which got 189 mm precipitation. The canopy temperature was measured row by row with a Raytek MX 4 type infrared thermometer. The stomatal conductance was measured by AP4 type porometer. There were significant differences between the control and irrigated plants according to the water supply which was formulated the canopy values. The plants with a deficient water supply were decreased the transpiration rate, therefore its cooling effect didn’t show up. The permanently irrigated tomato plants’ yield exceeded the unirrigated ones with almost 50%. It is emerged from the study that the irrigation has a positive effect on the amount of the harvestable yield. It’s came from the regression analysis that over a specific amount of water (285 mm), the ripened yield is affected negatively. Keywords: tomato, water supply, canopy temperature Introduction The importance of tomato cultivation has been growing rapidly in the last decades in the world. Beside the fresh market tomatoes, the processing tomato has a great importance in the food industry. The processing tomato cultivation has changed a lot recently, the production areas were decreased, but the yield is getting higher due to the widespread use of hybrids and better growing technologies in Hungary. Processing tomato cultivation is only profitable in Hungary if the yield is over 40-50t/ha (Fruitveb 2008). Ecological conditions e.g. solar radiation, temperature and water supply take a great effect on tomato yield (Pék et al. 2008), so the irrigation is essential to keep yield higher and it is possible to increase the amount till 80-100t/ha. It is important to measure the different water supply on canopy by monitor the activity of stomas in the leaves. The prognosis could be done for the irrigation and calculation the amount of irrigation water is possible only in the view of stomatal conductance and canopy temperature (Schober et al. 2008). Materials and methods The experiment was carried out in open field in Gödöllı. The soil is sandy in that area with low water capacity and the hydraulic conductivity is good. Tomato cultivars (Brigade F1) were investigated in the present study. Area of the experiment was 300 m 2 and the area of one plot was 25m 2 . Seeds were sown on the 7 th of April 2008 in greenhouse and transplanted on the 12 th of May 2008. Tomato seedlings were planted out in twin rows, 0.4m spacing inside the raw and 1.2m between adjacent twin rows, the space between the plants in the row was 0.4m. There were two treatments, regularly irrigated plants which got 333 mm water, including the precipitation and the other was the cut off substance which means the irrigation was stopped at the beginning of the ripening process; there was a control as well which got 189 mm precipitation. Drip</p><p id="Pg111">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 114 irrigated water was given out according to the air temperature (daily irrigation water (mm) = average daily temperature×0.2). The canopy temperature was measured by Raynger II infrared thermometer and the stomatal conductance by AP4 type porometer. These processes were taken every day within the crops from 1PM. All statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft® Excel 2002 Analysis Toolpak (Microsoft Corporation Corporate Headquarters Redmond, USA). Results and discussion According to Katerji et al. (1988), we measured first leaf above terminal cluster, which is well characterise water status of the whole plant. There is significant difference between the irrigated and unirrigated control treatment during the measuring period. Accumulated stomatal conductance was 20.2 mol m -2 s -1 for the irrigated, 17.5 mol mol m -2 s -1 for the cut off, and 10.2 mol m -2 s -1 for the unirrigated control plants respectively (Figure 1). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29/6 09/7 19/7 29/7 08/8 date A cc u m u la te d s to m at o al c o n d u ct an ce (m o l m -2 s -1 ) regularly irrigated irrigation cut-off rainfed Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 115 The canopy temperature rates confirm the difference between irrigation treatments and unirrigated control. It was appointed that there was an upward tendency in the range of control, cut off and regularly irrigated plants, the more water supplies they had, the more yields they produced. The canopy temperature of control plants was 27.3 °C, the irrigated plants was 26.2 °C on the average. This means 1.1 °C average deflection through a day. A deflection of 1 C on the canopy temperature causes 10% in the transpiration rate (Tanner, 1963), therefore the regularly irrigated treatment could vaporize 10% more then the control ones. Canopy temperature of irrigated and unirrigated plants were split at the beginning of the treatment, and the species are separable as well. Canopy temperature of the plants from both treatments were under or close to the air temperature during the monitoring period, except the control treatment (Figure 2.). Since the control’s temperature was nearly always higher than the air temperature, the plants had lack of water. From the calculations it can assessed that the air temperature affects the leaves’ temperature significantly. It can assess from correlation coefficients that the air temperature affects the constantly irrigated, cut-off and control plants’ leaf’s temperature by 60-, 54- and 59% in range. Lesser water supply coupling higher canopy temperature, which comes from the equations. In the constantly irrigated treatment the cooling effect intensify over 28ºC air temperature. 0 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 30 40 air temperature (°C) le af s u rf ac e te m p er at u re ( °C ) cut-off regularly irrigated rainfed y = 1.02x - 0.07 R²=0.55 y = 0.98x + 0.48 R²=0.60 y = 1.17x - 3.05 R²=0.59 Figure 2.

Cereal Research Communications 116 Conclusions There were significant differences among three different water supplies in accumulated stomatal conductance, at the end of measuring period. The stomas of regularly irrigated tomato plants opened up more widely, because of the high turgor capacity, therefore the water could effuse as a vapour, while unirrigated control plants showed the contrast of that, to avoid the unnecessary water loss. Air temperature took strong positive effect on leaf surface temperature. The rainfed and cut-off irrigated tomato plants could not transpire sufficient water to cool leafs below air temperature and it causes stress. But regularly irrigated plants did not heat over air temperature owing to enough soil water content. Both stomatal conductance and canopy temperature is suitable to characterize the tomato plant water status. Acknowledgements The study was partly supported by Seminis Hungária Ltd.

Effects of NPK fertilisation of different dose on chemical features of a chernozem soil and on yield of winter wheat were tested in the framework of the 40-year-old National Uniformed Long-term Fertilisation Experiments (NULTFE) at Karcag in 2007. Results proved that regular application of too small and too big fertilizer doses have unfavourable effects on some chemical properties (the readily available nutrient contents, the soil acidity, the amounts and the rate of exchangeable cations) of the tested soil and the yield of winter wheat. We tested the CO2-emission of soils as a potential indicator of stress situations as well. Keywords: under- and over-fertilisation, winter wheat, long-term fertilisation experiment, CO2-emission Introduction Fertilisation has both favourable and unfavourable effects on the chemical features of soils and on amounts of yield of different crops (Tisdale and Nelson 1966). Unfavourable effects get stronger if too big or too small fertiliser doses are applied regularly (Csathó 2003; Pepó 2007; Kádár 2008). Hence, lack and surplus of nutrients can result in stress for crops. These stress situations decrease the quantity and the quality of yields (Blazenca et al. 2007) and have effects of the microbiological activities of soils (Kátai 1992). The mitigation of these unfavourable effects is one of the most important tasks of farmers and agrochemists. Long-term fertilisation experiments provide important information for the completion of this task. Effects of long-term NPK fertilisation on different chemical features of the soil and on the yield of winter wheat were tested in the NULTFE in Karcag. We tried to get information about the stressprovoking role of over- and under-fertilisation as well. Additionally, we tested the CO2emission of the soil as a potential indicator of nutrient stress situations. Materials and methods Effect of NPK fertilisation on some chemical features of the soil and on the amounts of winter wheat yield was tested on a meadow chernozem soil at Karcag in 2007. The applied fertiliser doses were published previously by ZSIGRAI (2001). We applied a conventional crop production technology during the vegetation period. The pH(H2O), pH(KCl), humus content, hydrolytic acidity (y1), AL-soluble P2O5, K2O, Ca-, Mg-, Na-, KCl+EDTA soluble Cu-, Fe-, Zn- and Mn-contents, exchangeable Ca-, Mg-, K- and Nacontents of the soil samples taken from the 0-20 cm layer were determined. The experimental data were processed with the method of MANOVA. In situ CO2-emission of soil was measured by means of an ANAGAS 98 infrared gas analyser in the control plots and plots getting 200 kg ha -1 year -1 N at 6 dates along a 15-month-long period.</p><p id="Pg115">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 118 Results and discussion While the NP fertilisation decreased the pH(H2O) values of the soil, the potential acidity was modified by the N fertilisation only (Table 1). The pH(H2O) of the control plots was almost neutral, but significant potential acidity was found in their top soil layer at the same time. This result proved that the artificial fertilisation is not the only reason of the acidification of our soils. Very serious changes of soil acidity can happen without artificial fertilisation caused by other acidifying factors. Until the acid-base buffer capacity of the soils does not get worn out, harmful stress situation caused by acidification will not be developed, but the acid-base status of soils should be monitored regularly in case of non calcareous mineral soils.

Without chemical amelioration, the pH(H2O) approached the limit value considered harmful for crops. Regular liming or Ca-fertilisation should be built in the crop production technology carried out on soils which are sensitive to the acidification. The AL-P2O5 contents of the soil increased significantly due to the regular P fertilisation. The average AL-P2O5 content of the control plots was higher than the P2O5 content of plots treated with NK fertilisers. It can be explained with the increased P uptake of the bigger yields of the NK treated plots. Hence, we established that the chance of the formation of stress (lack of phosphorus) can be more significant in case of regular unbalanced NPK fertilisation than in case of fertilisation of small dose. 65-70 kg P2O5 ha -1 dose could be considered as an amount that is suitable for maintaining the Pbalance of the given soil in equilibrium. In case of the application of bigger P doses, filling up processes can be expected in the tested soil. The AL-P2O5 content was</p><p id="Pg116">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 119 decreased significantly by the N fertilisation as well, because of the higher P-demand of the bigger amounts of yield. Corresponding to the results of another experiments (Füleky 1983), the liming increased the solubility of the P compounds of the soil. But, sometimes liming can result in lack of some kind of microelements. The regular K fertilisation increased the AL-K2O contents of the soil significantly. Symptoms of stress situations caused by K over- or under-fertilisation could never be observable in the experiments, because the K-fund of the soil could provide the K supply of the plants. The higher acidity of the soil resulted in increase of solubility of the Fe-compounds which represents a possibility of development of stress situations. Amounts of the exchangeable Ca-ions were decreased by the N and the K fertilisation and increased by the P fertilisation. In case of the N fertilisation the acidifying effect of the ammonium-nitrate, but in case of the K fertilisation the cation exchange processes were the causing factors of these changes. The regular spread of superphosphate containing a great amount of Ca-ions increased the adsorbed Ca content of the soil. Of course the liming had the same effect. The effect of the N and the K fertilisation on the exchangeable Mg content of the soil was very similar to their effects on the exchangeable Ca content, but the P fertilisation and the liming decreased the amounts of this cation significantly. The exchangeable K content of the soil was affected by the K fertilisation only. According to the yield data, application of 100-130 kg N and 70-80 kg P2O5 effective substances is reasonable in the ecological conditions of the experiment. The application of NP-doses exceeding the amounts mentioned above can reduce the amount of yield. We came to the conclusion that there is a possibility of omitting K-fertilization on the examined soil type sometimes, because we observed effects of K-fertilization neither on the amount, nor on the safety of winter wheat yield in the experiments. In our opinion these results could be adapted to the fields of the Middle-Tisza Region with ecological conditions similar to the trial site. But the decision concerning the omitting Kfertilization always must be established by exact soil tests. The yield data call our attention to the importance of the P fertilisation of winter wheat. The regular application of 60 kg P2O5 ha -1 increased the amount of winter wheat yield by 2 t ha -1 comparing to the yield of plots without P fertilisation. But, the further increase of the P dose resulted in yield decrease. This phenomenon must be a symptom of a stress situation induced by P over-fertilisation. In circumstances of insufficient nutrient supply represented by the control plots, the amount of winter wheat yield reached 50 % of the yield of fertilised plots only. On the basis of the CO2-emission data, only a small difference was observable between the control plot and the plot treated with N fertiliser (Figure 1). We could not detect significant differences in the CO2-emission of the different plots when the microbiological activity was limited by the low soil moisture content (August) or by the low soil temperature (October). In June the microbiological activity of the soil was not limited by other ecological factors, so the effect of the different nutrient supply of the soil was traceable by the measuring of the CO2-emission. When the moisture contents of the plots were similar (in July, after precipitation), no significant differences were detected. Similar experiences were reported in scientific papers dealing with the correlation between soil moisture content and CO2-emission (Zsembeli et al., 2005; Gyuricza et al. 2006). It can be concluded that the soil moisture content is the main</p><p id="Pg117">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

CO2-emission of the soil Conclusions Unfavourable fertiliser effects could induce stress situations for the winter wheat which were indicated by the amounts of yield. The lack of N and P, and the P surplus resulted in significant yield losses. We found that regular application of 100-130 kg N and 70-80 kg P2O5 effective substances is reasonable in the ecological conditions of the experiment. The application of NP-doses which are bigger or smaller than the amounts mentioned above can induce some kind of stress and can reduce the amount of yield. The chance of the formation of stress was more significant in case of regular unbalanced NPK fertilisation than in case of fertilisation of small dose. The application possibility of the CO2-emission measurement is limited in scientific works focusing on the analysis of fertiliser effects.

Variants with contrast stand structure (different seed rates and N rates) were investigated during stem elongation. Analyses involved determination of individual plants and tillers, above-ground biomass and nitrogen uptake. Two types of relationships were observed as reaction to the level of sources and its effect as stress factor - relationships among plants which are more or less of a random nature and intra-plant relationships dependent on the hierarchic structure of plants. Plant responses were reflected in variability of their tillers. A higher inter-plant competition was expressed by lower values of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the plant weight and the number of tillers per plant. On the other hand, intra-plant competition increased values of the CV of the shoot weight. During stem elongation, the differentiation of tillers into two groups, i.e. vegetative and potentially productive, take place. This was accelerated by the lack of nitrogen or by a higher plant density. The separation of shoots into two groups enabled to determine the proportion of the potentially productive biomass in the total above-ground biomass. A low variability of this proportion (CV ranged from 7.06 to 15.79 % and from 7.37 to 17.46 % for winter wheat and spring barley, respectively) gives a possibility to use it as the indicator of the effectiveness of inputs and of a crop productive potential. These may contribute to the development of more efficient methods for canopy control and assessment of stress factors by using canopy spectral characteristics. Keywords: winter wheat, spring barley, canopy structure, inter- and intra-plant competition, tillers differentiation Introduction The stand state and structure reflect variability in soil conditions as well as cropping treatments. To attain higher effectiveness of crop management practices, extensive research on cereal stand structure was conducted in the 1980s and 1990s (MasleMeynard and Sebillote, 1981; Porter, 1984; Kren, 1991). Understanding the rules of cereal canopy development can contribute to the identification of stress factors (Grieve et al., 2001) and to the improvement of both, crop management practices and breeding (Uzik and Zofajova, 2007). Therefore, this study is focused on a more detailed analysis of differentiation of cereal tillers during the period of generative growth and development. The aim was to acquire knowledge of more effective diagnostic methods for cereal canopy assessment. Materials and methods Evaluation of the canopy development of winter wheat (variety Cubus) and spring barley (variety Malz) was performed in small-plot field experiments established at two locations in Central and South Moravia (Zabcice and Kromeriz differing in soil and climatic conditions) within the period of three years (2005-2007). Experiments were conducted as contrast variants which took into account differences in the stand density and nutritional status of plants. Each experimental variant was established in five replications: three of them were harvested and two were used for sampling, which</p><p id="Pg119">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 122 enabled the analyses of the structure and nutritional status of the stand. In sampling plots, squares of the size 0.25 m 2 (0.5 x 0.5 m) were marked out to obtain plants for analyses of stand structure and nutritional status at developmental stages BBCH 31, 37, 55 and 65. Analyses of stand structure and nutritional status involved: estimation of numbers and weight of individual tillers and plants, and estimation of dry matter (DM) weight of the above-ground part of plants. The segregation of tillers to productive and non-productive ones was performed according to their decreasing weight and by taking the number of fully ripe ears per plot as the number of productive tillers. Tillers with the highest weight at the given developmental stage were rated as productive ones and the sum of their weights represented the so-called productive biomass. This value was separated from the total weight of fresh above-ground biomass per unit area of the stand. Results were evaluated using elementary statistical characteristics (including histograms of the distribution of weights of tillers) and correlation analysis. Results and discussion The process of tiller differentiation was evaluated by means of histograms illustrating the frequency distribution of their weights. To respect given size limits of the paper, it is not possible to present results of all provided analyses, therefore, the process of tiller differentiation is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The higher density of plants and a lack of nitrogen accelerated the process of differentiation and made it also more intensive. Application of nitrogen prolonged processes of differentiation till the stage of heading. From the viewpoint of yield formation, a gradual differentiation of tillers is beneficial because potentially productive tillers can be preserved for a longer time interval. On the other hand, however, too dense stands can suffer from a lack of sources (e.g. during dry periods). The separation of tillers into two groups, i.e. vegetative and generative (potentially productive) ones enabled us to determine the share of potentially productive and non-productive biomass in the total above-ground biomass of the stand. The application of nitrogen was manifested in a higher weight of potentially productive tillers and lower values of their coefficients of variation (CV). The lowered variability of productive tillers was associated with their higher density and also with the increased amount of productive biomass per unit area. Correlations between total above-ground biomass and biomass of potentially productive tillers were positive and statistically highly significant while correlations between the total above-ground biomass and the share of the biomass of potentially productive tillers were very variable (Table 1). Similar values and a similar character of correlations were also between the content of nitrogen in the total above-ground biomass and biomass of potentially productive tillers and also their share in the total above-ground biomass. Low values (i.e. less than a half) of the CV for the proportion of biomass of productive tillers in the total above-ground biomass (ranging from 7.06 to 15.79 % and from 7.37 to 17.46 % for winter wheat and spring barley, respectively) were found (Table 2) while values of CV for other traits under study ranged from 29.81 to 54.43 %. Because of a low variability, the proportion of potentially productive tillers in the total above-ground biomass can be used for the estimation of a productive potential of the crop. The results also indicate that there is a possibility of the occurrence of various, dynamically changing situations in cereal crops.</p><p id="Pg120">VIII.

Cereal Research Communications 124 Conclusions The differentiation of tillers occurred under conditions of a lack of sources (e.i. nitrogen). Application of nitrogen prolonged processes of differentiation till the end of heading. From the viewpoint of yield formation, a gradual differentiation of tillers is beneficial because potentially productive tillers can be preserved for a longer time interval. On the other hand, however, too dense stands can suffer under conditions of lacking sources (e.g. during dry periods). The share of productive biomass in the total above-ground biomass can be an important indicator of the effectiveness of farming inputs into the crop cultivation. The application of nitrogen was manifested in a higher weight of an average tiller even under conditions of an increased stand density and in lower values of CV for tiller weight. Decreased tiller variability was associated with a higher productive density of the stand and with a higher amount of productive biomass per unit area of the stand. There is a close relationship between the total above-ground biomass and that of potentially productive tillers already at the stage of stem elongation. Because of a low variability, it is possible to use the proportion of potentially productive tillers in the total above-ground biomass for the estimation of a productive potential of the crop. Various and dynamically changing situations can occur in cereal stands. The population concept applied in studies concerning modular units (tillers) enabled to create a unifying base for these relatively chaotic phenomena. They can, therefore, be used when studying and testing new methods for efficient and areal screening of the condition of cereal stands by means of spectral characteristics and technologies of remote and terrestrial sensing.

UNDER WATER STRESS Václav HEJNÁK – Kateřina KYKALOVÁ Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, 165 21 Prague 6 - Suchdol, Czech Republic, e-mail: hejnak@af.czu.cz Abstract: The young plants of maize, cv. Anjou 245, were cultivated in sand culture under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The water stress was caused by interruption of irrigation for a period of 8 days. The relative water content (RWC) decreased from 87.5 % to 79.7–83.2 %. This had the effect of a significant decrease of the dry matter production in shoots and roots of the maize plants. When the plants were treated with a 100 µM abscisic acid (ABA) solution before the interruption of irrigation, this limited the growth of their aboveground parts and supported the production of dry matter in roots. Benzylaminopurine (BAP), applied as a 10 µM solution, also supported the production of dry matter in the roots of the stressed plants to a statistically significant extent. At the same time, the application of ABA and BAP also reduced the ratio of the dry matter in aboveground parts to the dry matter in roots in the plants stressed by drought; the change in favour of the roots is a significant adaptation mechanism of plants to cope with water stress. The 8-day interruption of irrigation resulted in decreasing the a and b chl content levels in the plants. This shows that the production of dry matter was influenced not only by the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis (by the partial closing of stomata) but also by non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. The negative effect of water stress on the chlorophyll content was mitigated by BAP. The effect of ABA was inconclusive (when applied at the roots) or negative (when applied on the leaves). Keywords: Zea mays L., dry matter, chlorophyll content, water stress, abscisic acid, benzylaminopurine Introduction Drought is one of the highly significant factors limiting the yield of most agricultural crops, including maize. The works of Stuchlikova et al. (2007) and Ceska et al. (2008) proved the effect of water stress on the physiology of stomata: their conductivity, rate of gas exchange and water use efficiency. It was also found out that these characteristics can be influenced in stressed plants by application of abscisic acid (ABA) and synthetic cytokinin benzylaminopurine (BAP). The aim of this related work was to find out how water stress limits the production of dry matter and the chlorophyll content in maize plants. The aim was also to identify how these parameters influence ABA and BAP and their method of application (on leaves or at the roots). Young plants were chosen for the experiment. Similarly like Keresa et al. (2008), we assume that the identified results will indicate the responses of plants even in the later phases of ontogenesis. Materials and methods Young plants of maize (Zea mays L., cv. Anjou 245) were cultivated in a physiological greenhouse in pots under controlled conditions: with 16-hour photo-period (16 hours of light/8 hours of darkness), with temperature set at 25 °C during the day and 20 °C at night and with air humidity hovering around 50 %. The pots had the area of 0.05 m 2 and were filled with silica sand and 10 plants were grown in each pot. They were irrigated by Knop's nutrient solution. The silica sand moisture was maintained at the level of 60– 70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity (θMCC). 28-day-old plants were divided</p><p id="Pg123">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 126 into 8 variants with 4 repetitions. Two variants (the irrigated control sample and the stressed, i.e. non-irrigated control sample) were treated with 50 cm 3 of water; on the other variants, 50 cm 3 100 µM abscisic acid (ABA) or 10 µM benzylaminopurine (BAP) or 100 µM ABA + 10 µM BAP were applied either by sprinkling or by irrigation. These concentrations were selected according to preliminary experiments. Subsequently, in the stressed control variant and in the variants treated by growth regulators, irrigation was interrupted for 8 days. The responses of plants to changes of the moisture in the substrate were identified by measuring the relative water content in leaves (RWC) gravimetrically. The chlorophyll content in the leaves of the experimental plants was identified spectrophotometrically by means of the Helios Γ apparatus. After the pigments were extracted into acetone, the solution absorbance levels at wave lengths of 663 and 644 nm were measured. The a and b chlorophyll content levels in 1 gram (g) of fresh leave matter were then calculated according to Nybom (1955). The dry matter of the aboveground part and the plants' roots was identified after the samples had been dried at 80 °C and had reached constant weight. The statistical evaluation was carried out by the variance analysis with α = 0.05 in the computer software Statistica, ANOVA module. The mean values measured in three series of experiments have been published. Results and discussion Figure 1. The dry matter of the young maize plants after the growth regulators application and the 8-day interruption of irrigation (Mean ± SD). In the control group where moisture content of the silica sand was maintained at 60–70 % θMCC throughout the experiment, a mean RWC of 87.5 % was identified in measurement. An eight-day interruption of irrigation and the related decrease of θMCC resulted in decreasing RWC in the stressed plants down to 79.7–83.2 %. The differences among the individual stressed groups were not statistically significant (see Stuchlikova et al., 2007 for more information). According to the results shown in Fig. 1, this water stress had the effect of a</p><p id="Pg124">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 127 statistically significant decrease of the dry matter production in shoots and roots of the maize plants as compared with the plants under no stress. This is caused by the reduced intensity of elongation of cells and growth of organs, the increasing accumulation of ABA in leaves and the incipient closing of stomata as a result of loss of turgor (Hejnak et al., 2009). The change in the opening of stomata consequently leads to decreasing the photosynthesis rate, the transpiration rate and the rate of assimilate production (Stuchlikova et al., 2007; Ceska et al., 2008; Csajbok et al., 2008). When the plants were treated with a 100 µM abscisic acid (ABA) solution before the interruption of irrigation, this limited the growth of their aboveground parts and supported the production of dry matter in roots. The application by irrigation at the roots was more effective than spraying the solution on leaves. ABA can improve the water management of maize plants not only by closing stomata and decreasing the losses resulting from transpiration, as stated by Stuchlikova et al. (2007) and Ceska et al. (2008). Our results show that it can also increase the intake of water by enlarging the root system. Cytokinin BAP, applied at the roots or on leaves as a 10 µM solution, supported the production of dry matter in the roots of the stressed plants even more. At the same time, the application of BAP at the roots limited production of dry matter in the aboveground parts of the plants. The application of BAP on the leaves conversely supported growth of dry matter in aboveground parts. The application of ABA as well as the application of BAP reduced the ratio of the dry matter in aboveground parts to the dry matter of roots in the plants stressed by drought. Supplying these growth regulators to the roots through irrigation had a much more significant effect on reduction of this ratio than supplying the regulators by spraying leaves with them. The ratio between the produced dry matter of the aboveground parts and the roots of the young maize plants was also reduced by the combined application of ABA and BAP. In this case, no differences depending on the application method were identified. There is enough information on the effect of ABA but there is little information on the effect of cytokinins on reduction of the ratio between stems and roots in plants exposed to drought. The work of Havlova et al. (2008) suggests a significant role of cytokinins in the response of the roots of plants to water deficit. Table 1.

We believe that this could explain the narrow chlorophyll a/b ratio in the control group (Tab. 1). The 8-day interruption of irrigation resulted in decreasing the a and b chl content levels in the young maize plants. The reduction of chlorophyll content indicates non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in the</p><p id="Pg125">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 128 maize leaves under water stress. When ABA was sprayed on the leaves, this resulted in further reduction of the chlorophyll content in the leaves of the plants stressed by drought. The effect of ABA applied at the roots was statistically inconclusive. Conversely, BAP applied at the roots or directly on the leaves resulted in an increased content of chlorophylls in the plants stressed by drought. Other authors state that not only cytokinins but also ABA mitigates the negative effect of water stress on the chlorophyll content in the leaves of maize and other plants (for example, Haisel et al., 2006). Conclusions The water stress, during which RWC decreased from 87.5 % to 79.7–83.2 % was manifested in the young maize plants by limitation of growth and production of dry matter in stems and roots. ABA or BAP supplied exogenously supported the growth and production of dry matter in roots in the plants exposed to drought, consequently reducing the ratio between stems and roots. The change of ratio between the aboveground part and the roots in favour of the roots is a significant adaptation mechanism of plants to cope with water stress. The plant increases the water intake and limits the water output. This improves its water management mode. The decrease of the chlorophyll content in maize leaves under water stress shows that production of dry matter was influenced not only by stomatal (by the partial closing of stomata) but also by non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. The negative effect of water stress on the chlorophyll content was mitigated by BAP. The effect of ABA was inconclusive (when applied at the roots) or negative (when applied on the leaves).

Total seven treatments were applied as follows (kg ha-1): a) standard fertilization or control (160 N + 150 P2O5+ 100 K2O); b) a + 500 P2O5; c) a + 1000 P2O5 ; d) a + 500 K2O; e) a + 1000 K2O, f) a + 500 P2O5 + 500 K2O and g) a + 1000 P2O5 + 1000 K2O. Phosphorus was added as MAP (monoammonium-phosphate: 12% N + 52% P2O5) and potassium in KCl form (60% K2O). The field trial was conducted by randomized block design in four replicates. Size of the individual plot of fertilization was 46.2 m2 (11 x 4.2 m). Crop rotation has been as follows: maize (2003-2004) – wheat (2005) – maize (2006) - winter barley (2007) – maize (2008). In general, maize yields in the experiment were high (4-year mean 11.08 t ha-1) and response to applied fertilization was not significant. However, wheat and barley responded by considerably yield increases (wheat up to 17%: 6.14 and 7.17 t ha-1; barley up to 19%: 6.19 and 7.35 t ha-1; for the control and the higher rate of PK, respectively). Keywords: maize, wheat, barley, grain yield, phosphorus and potassium fertilization Introduction Low plant available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels are in place limiting factor of the field crop yields (Petošić et al., 2003; Izsaki, 2007; Kadar, 2007; Ragalyi and Kadar, 2008). Aim of this study was testing ameliorative P and K fertilization impacts on field crops (maize, wheat and barley) yields in the 2003-2008 period. Response of maize for the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons, including yields and plant nutritional status, were detailed shown in the previous study (Lončarić et al., 2005). Material and methods The field experiment The experiment with increased rates of fertilization was conducted in spring of April 2003 in Badljevina (west edge of Pozega-Slavonia County). Total seven treatments were applied as follows (kg ha -1 ): a) standard fertilization or control (160 N + 150 P2O5+ 100 K2O); b) a + 500 P2O5; c) a + 1000 P2O5 ; d) a + 500 K2O; e) a + 1000 K2O, f) a + 500 P2O5 + 500 K2O and g) a + 1000 P2O5 + 1000 K2O. Phosphorus was added as MAP (monoammonium-phosphate: 12% N + 52% P2O5) and potassium in KCl form (60% K2O). As with MAP were applied additional quantities of nitrogen, they were equaled for all treatments with CAN (calcium ammonium nitrate containing 27% N) as follows (kg CAN ha -1 ): 850, 425, 0 850, 850, 425 and 0, for the treatments a, b, c, d, e, f and g, respectively. The field trial was conducted by randomized block design in four replicates. Size of the individual plot of fertilization was 46.2 m 2 (11 x 4.2 m). Crop rotation has been as follows: maize (2003-2004) – wheat (2005) – maize (2006) - winter barley (2007) – maize (2008). Maize was sown at the end of April / beginning of May by pneumatic sowing machine and harvested manualy at the end of September / the first half of October. Wheat and</p><p id="Pg127">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 130 barley were sown at the end of October and harvested at the beginning of July. Area of 1 square metter was harvested from each plot for yield and ears quantities determinations. The ears were treshed by special mini treshing mashine. Soil sampling and chemical analysis of soil Soil sampling (depth 0-30 cm) from different fertilization treatments was made in term at the end of the second year of testing (October 5, 2004). Nutritional status of soil was determined by the AL-method. Soil and weather characteristics Very acid reaction and moderate levels of plant available P and K are the main soil properties. Fertilization correspondingly influenced on increases of P and K availability, while soil pH, hydrolitical acidity and humus contents were similar for all applied treatments (Table 1). Table 1.

Drought stress is main characteristic of the 2003-growing season. Precipitation for 4month period (May-Aug.) was only 155 mm or only 43% compared to long-term value (the data of Daruvar Weather Bureau). At the same time, mean air-temperatures were 22.0°C or for 3.3°C higher (Table 2). In general, under middle and eastern European conditions, the lower maize yields are in close connection with water shortage and the higher air-temperatures, especially during two summer months, July and August (Kovačević et al., 2009; Maklenović et al., 2009) and these findings are in accordance with Corn Belt (USA) experiences (Shaw, 1988). The remaining three growing seasons (2004, 2006 and 2008) were mainly favorable for maize growing regarding water and temperature regimes. For example, precipitation and mean air-temperatures in July + August were 104 mm and 23.0 o C, 128 mm and 20.02 o C, 179 mm and 20.6 o C, 151 mm and 21.8 o C, for 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008, respectively (30-year means: 177 mm and</p><p id="Pg128">VIII.

The growing season 2004/2005 was less favorable for winter crops growing compared to the 2006/2007 growing season because of water excess in autumn and lower air-temperatures during the winter period (Table 3).

Results and discussion In general, maize yields in the experiment were high (4-year mean 11.08 t ha -1 ) and response to applied fertilization was mainly low because only in 2006 significant yield increase for 10% was found as a result of ameliorative P fertilization (Table 4).

The second explanation for low response of maize to the fertilization is possible low degree of AL-method (Egner et al., 1960) suitability for estimation of P and K nutritional status for this soil type. The results of this study are mainly in agreement with our earlier experiences (Banaj et al., 2006; Kovačević et al., 2007, 2008; Rastija et al., 2006). Conclusions In general, ameliorative P and K fertilization had no significant effects on maize, while wheat and barley yields were increased up to 17% and 19%, respectively. Also, application of both elements was more effective compared to either P or K application.

Andrea BALLA KOVÁCS – Rita KREMPER – Sándor BERÉNYI Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen Böszörményi út 138. Hungary, e-mail:kovacsa@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Greenhouse pot experiment was set up to determine the effect of an abiotic stress as different N and S doses on NO3 -, SO4 2- and Cl- accumulation and distribution in leaves and in pods of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris var. Nanus). Four N rates (0.36, 0.66, 0.96, 1.27 g pot-1) in combination with three levels of S rates (0.043, 0.085, 0.170 g pot-1) were applied as treatments in a randomized complete block design in four replications. P and K doses were identical in all pots (0.29 g pot-1 P2O5 and 0.79 g pot -1 K2O). Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur were added in solution made of NH4NO3, NH4H2PO4, KCl and K2SO4, respectively. Four plants were grown in Mitscherlich pots containing 10 kg soil. With increasing rates of applied N decreased the Cl- concentration both in leaves and in pods. On the contrary, highest N dosages resulted in the accumulation of both NO3 - and SO4 2- ions in bean-plant. Higher S doses significantly reduced the Cl- and NO3 - concentration of plant. The decrease of Cl- content in the leaves was larger extent than in podes. There was a significant increase in SO4 2- concentration both in leaves and pods with the application of growing S rates. According to our results different rates of N and S fertilizers have influenced the quality of the bean and the distribution and accumulation of anions inside of bean-plant. Keywords: nitrogen, sulphur, nitrate, sulphate, chloride, bean Introduction Among the pulses the common bean is one of the most important food crop worldwide (Graham and Ranalli, 1997). Bean environment, for example nutritional supply vary widely in their productivity and their quality. Nitrogen fertilization may affect vegetative growth and quality of pods of bean plant (El-Kramany et al., 2001). Excessive use of N fertilizers may cause nitrate accumulation in vegetable plant tissues which may be a health hazard and is therefore undesirable (Boskovic and Pavlovic, 2007; Nádasy and Nádasy, 2006). Sulphur is considered as the fourth major nutrient element, plays an important role in the biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine (Giczi et al., 2006). S application not only increases growth rate of bean but also may improve the quality of production (Khurana and Bansal, 2007). In the literature, there are some reports which are dealing with N fertilization of bean (Sánchez et al., 2004), but little attention has been given to study the effects of combined application of N and S. Application of high N and S fertilization may result an excessive storage of inorganic nitrate and sulphate ions in plant tissue. Determination of anions in bean plant may be important, because they determine some relevant properties (nutritional qualities) of the food and they provide information about the nature and origin of the foods. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of different nitrogen and sulphur rates on NO3 , SO4 2- and Cl - accumulation and distribution of garden bean.</p><p id="Pg131">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 134 Materials and methods The greenhouse pot experiment was performed with a loamy soil (pHCaCl2=7.68; Hu%=2.22; K A=41.4; (KA: plasticity index according to Arany)). The bi-factorial trials were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications, applying four levels of nitrogen and three levels of sulphur. For the treatment applied see Table 1. Table 1.

N, P, K and S were added in solution made of NH4NO3, NH4H2PO4, KCl and K2SO4, respectively. Treatment N2 ensured recommended, 192 kg ha -1 N dose. 10 kg soil was weighed into Mitscherlich type pots. The indicator plant was bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris var. nanus). Sex seeds of bean were sown into the soil per pot and after emergence, four plants per pot were left to grow. Ion exchanged water was added to all pots to keep the soil at constant moisture (60% of the water-holding capacity) using daily weighing. At the end of the vegetation period plant samples (pods and leaves) were collected and were dried for further analysis. NO3 , SO4 2- and Cl - ions of plant water extracts were measured by single column ion chromatography (Balláné and Loch, 2004). Analysis of variance was carried out on the data in order to provide a statistical comparison between the treatment means. The least significant difference (LSD) test was used to detect differences between means.

The same observation was made by Ira Stancheva et al. (2004), namely, in vegetable plants the NO3 - is accumulated mainly in the leaves. NO3 - content of leaves and pods were found to significantly increase with N fertilization on averages from 1046 to 1428 mg kg -1 (DW) and from 149.5 to 772 mg kg -1 (DW), respectively. Increasing effect of N was more effective on NO3 - content of pods, rather than of leaves. The application of high S rates reduced NO3 - concentration of leaves, possibly due to an antagonism between SO4 2- and</p><p id="Pg133">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 136 NO3 . This supposition is consistent with that reported by Ruiz et al. (2005). The highest NO3 - values of leaves were measured at N4S2, while the lowest ones were at N1S3 treatments. In pods the highest NO3 - were found in N4S1 and the lowest values in N1S2 treatments. At N4S1 treatment the NO3 - content of pods has reached the leaves NO3 - but did not exceed the maximum acceptable limit for vegetables (4500 mg kg -1 NO3 - FW). The SO4 2- contents of leaves in all cases were higher than measured values in pods. The highest N doses caused growing accumulation of SO4 2- in plant. Inreasing effect of N was more effective on SO4 2- content of pods rather than of leaves. Increments of S doses also increased the SO4 2- content of pods and leaves. The highest SO4 2- accumulation of leaves and pods were measured in N4S3 treatment. The Cl - contents of leaves were also higher than measured values in pods. With increasing soil N treatments Cl - concentration both in pods and in leaves decreased significantly. Increase of S doses also decreased Cl - content of plant. Decreasing effect of S rates on Cl - values was more effective in leaves, than in pods. Therefore the pod Cl - content to leave Cl - content ratio increased with increasing S rates. Conclusions - Concentration of NO3 , SO4 2- and Cl - ions were higher in leaves than in pods. - Increment of N doses resulted in the accumulation of NO3 - and SO4 2- ions in plant. Inreasing effect of N was more effective on NO3 - and SO4 2- concentrations in pods rather than in leaves. On the contrary, increment of N doses resulted in the decrease of Cl - content both in leaves and in pods. - Higher S doses reduced the Cl - and NO3 - concentration, while increased the SO4 2- values of plant tissues. According to our results different rates of N and S fertilizers have influenced the quality of bean and the distribution and accumulation of anions inside of bean-plant. References Balláné, K.

Böszörményi street, Debrecen, Hungary, H-4032, e-mail: gyori@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: It is known from literature (Olson et al., 1965, Tisdale and Nelson, 1966) that some species and hybrids of maize are sensitive to the deficiency of certain microelements (especially Zinc and Copper) appearing in the early phenological phase (3-leaves, 5-7-leaves stage) as chlorosis, which is enhanced by the fact that in the case of these phases temperature (heat stress) is lower than average. As a result of these effects these individuals grow slower and have difficulties in catching the ones free from microelement deficiency. Concerning microelements this effect appears as lower Zinc and Copper content caused by the over supply of available Phosphorus (P-Zn stress). Under adverse conditions this Phosphorus–Zinc antagonism causes not only loss in yield but changes in amino-acid composition and lower ratio of tryptophan as compared with normal individuals. It is very difficult to prevent the maize crop in the phenological phase 3-5 leaves from the cold stress and the deficiency of Zinc supply. In addition we can not influence the weather of this period, but we can prevent the inhibition of the Zinc uptake (Phosphorus stress). Reducing and ceasing this disadvantageous effect in early phenophases of maize is difficult since leaf area is small thus spraying fertilisation is not efficient enough, even if only rows are treated, besides placing of Zinc manure into the soil also can be complicated. In model and small-plot experiments tests and investigations were carried out with Zinc compounds placing into the soil and fertilisers of different complex stability and thus of different ligand systems (mono- and poliligands). In these observations we analysed plants in different phenophases including harvesting stage. Keywords: zinc, chelates, foliar fertilization, soil fertilization, leaf analysis, P-Zn stress Introduction Various amounts of nutrients are added to the soil by regular NPK fertilization complying with advisory services. Utilization (bioavailability) of these can be different and is influenced by factors based on the interactions of elements (Schmidt and Szakál, 2007, Schmidt et al., 2008). One of the strongest manifestation of these interactions is inhibition of zinc uptake induced by phosphorus (P-Zn stress), that has an economic importance concerning plants sensitive to them (maize, pea). In this case the assurance of appropriate yield amount is prior to quality. In our experiments we focused on how plants can be got through the inhibition in growth caused by stress. Therefore small pot and field experiments were carried out with different products for microelement supplying. Soil and plant samples were analyzed by ICP-OES. We have found that the effect depends on the chemical characteristics of products, time and way of application notably. Zn supplying into the soil proved to be the most efficient method to avoid P-Zn stress of maize at 3-5-leaves stage. Materials and methods According to the literature (Kádár and Pusztai, 1982, Kádár and Shalaby, 1986) P-Zn stress is considerable in calcareous chernozem with great concentration of biologically available phosphorus (AL-soluble). Our experiments were carried out under laboratory, small pot and field conditions using this type of soil. We determined chemical properties (pH, chemical stability constant of the metal and ligand and dependence of</p><p id="Pg135">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 138 these on temperature and pH) of applied microelement fertilizers (Gyıri and Mátz, 1979, Gyıri and Varró, 1987). Soil used in small pot had the following properties: medium nitrogen and phosphorus supply, high potassium content, 2.8-3 % humus content, 0.14-0.18 % total nitrogen, AL-P2O5=130-200 mg kg -1 , AL-K2O=240-280 mg kg -1 ), pH (KCl)=6.2, plasticity number: 43, zinc content: 0.262 mg kg -1 0.01 M CaCl2soluble, 2.390 mg kg -1 AL-soluble, 350 mg kg -1 0.1 M KCl+0.5 M EDTA soluble, 3.40 mg kg -1 Lakanen-Erviö soluble 70.5 mg kg -1 after cc. HNO3+H2O2 digestion. The soil of field experiments (Békés county, calcareous chernozem) contained 250 and 400 mg/kg AL-soluble P2O5. Small pot experiments were performed in Mitscherlich type dishes. Whole plant samples were collected at 3-5-leaves stage, 10-leaves stage, the leaf opposite to the maize cob was collected at blooming in field experiments . The whole plant was analyzed at harvesting. Element content and yield were studied. The results of 3-5-leaves and 10-leaves stage samples are presented in this report. The whole young plants were collected and after cleaning with distilled water parts above and under the soil (shoots and roots) were separated . They were dried on 105 ºC to constant weight, ground by Retsch SK1 grinder applying sieve of 1mm. Sample preparation for ICP analysis was carried out according to Kovács et al. (1996, 2000). Soil analysis with different extractants were performed by ICP-OES (Gyıri, 1998). Results and discussion The efficiency of the different microelement-products depends on several factors, like chemical characteristic, amount of applied agent, time of application, main conditions of element-uptake or macro- and microelement content of soil, species/hybrid being sensitive to element-uptake stress. Most of the products recommended making up the shortfall of microelements, form metal-ligand systems with different nutrient-uptake possibilities. Based on our experiment, the following order of ions have been established for the main microelements concerning complex formation facility with generally applied ligands: Fe &gt;&gt; Cu &gt;&gt; Zn &gt; Mn. The metal ion binding capability of EDTA type ligands seems to be the highest comparing to the other type ligands or ligand-pairs that are commercially available. Efficiency of products applying on leaves depends partly on their chemical characteristic, partly on the proportion of sprayed material and the amount on the leaves of plants. It is influenced by the different diffusion speed of metals and ligands in plant tissues. In our comprehensive experiment series with various products offered for microelement supply, mainly the effect of the foliar fertilization was examined. In the experiment 10 treatments were applied in 4 replications, at 10-leaves-stage. Different zinc ligand and/or pair of ligands systems (glycine-citric acid, EDTA, citric acid-acetic acid, dimethyl-glycine derivative, carbamid derivative, citric acid-tartaric acid, amino acids), where used, the foliar zinc dose was equal. Only one treatment resulted significant increase in yield (13.02 t ha -1 – control and 14.44 02 t ha -1 10 l ha -1 Folisol maize). Since adaptation of foliar fertilization into technology at later phenological phases is difficult, if it is possible another method has to be chosen to cease element-uptake stress. Getting microelement fertilizer onto the topsoil at a steady pace can be one possibility, however, we decided to get element(s) being at minimum level due to ion-antagonism during uptake close to the grain sown on ground. There are several products for this purpose, eg. metal-ammonium</p><p id="Pg136">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 139 salts besides all of the agents that do not bind irreversibly to the soil and do not inhibit germination. Zinc-content of three hybrids are shown in Table 1 (shoots and roots separately) after addition of different levels of microelement into the soil. According to the results 300 mg of zinc or more raised the zinc-content of shoot significantly in each hybrid (Carla, P3732, Pannonia), while zinc-content of root increased remarkably in the case Carla and Pannonia. Increase of zinc –content in the root of Pannonia is so significant that it refers to sensitivity to P-Zn. After that we decided to set field experiments where visible symptoms of P-Zn stress were observed and temperature was low after emergence. Three plots were chosen, where Pannonia hybrid was sown by hand. Zinc-content of samples collected in 3-5- and 10-leaves-stages can be seen in Table 3. Data show different effect depending on the soil and its element-uptake conditions. In some cases there is not significant difference between zinc-content of control and treated plants but roots show remarkable growth. In other cases treatments resulted in detectable increase of zinc-content in both phenophases. That’s why zincuptake stress caused by P-Zn antagonism at early 3-5-leaves-stage of maize is so important. To avoid it is rather difficult even in case of applying foliar fertilizers, because it is not effective enough due to the relatively small leaf area and or the small root surface area. Table 1.

This intervention can cease P-Zn stress in maize in early phenophases when visual symptoms (chlorotic leaves) can be observed and the plant avoids it in later phenophases. This favourable effect could lead to 3-10 % increase in yield. References Gyıri, D. – Mátz, G.: 1979.

Maintaining the linear character of the regressions, the stress has been established to induce significant alterations in the parameters of the regression. With application of covariance analysis (ANCOVA), significant deviations or identities can be interpreted between the physiological states symbolized by state dependent regressions. Since covariance analysis is able to avoid the breaking effect of standard deviation on comparability of individual variables, it is possible to detect physiological state alteration in a much more sensitive manner by comparing the linear correlations of the variables. Keywords: enzyme correlation, state dependent correlation, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, quaternary ammonium compound Introduction In recent investigations of plant stress the authors more and more characterize the syndromes by correlations of some stress sensitive variables, too (Janda et al. 2008, Pourdad 2008, Lepeduš et al. 2008, Osipova et al. 2007, Polišenská et al. 2007). Therefore, the origin of stress sensitive correlations has been subject to a recent model investigation (Németh et al. 2009a). It has been supported that physical meanings can be related to the regression straight lines representing these correlations. The correlations belonging to concrete sampling times provide some information about specific physiological states, thus they are considered as state dependent correlations (Németh et al. 2009a). The parameters of state dependent regression (slope, intercept, coefficient of determination) can change in time if the variables are susceptible to the alteration of physiological state. It makes a possibility to track the plant stress syndrome with the correlations of biochemical variables. On executing the investigations dominated by correlative standpoint, the sampling states of plant stress are characterized by linear regressions of some biochemical variables. Among these state dependent regressions statistical identity or deviation are established by using covariance analysis whose detailed application is shown in another recent paper (Németh et al. 2009b).

Results and discussion Consider three plant physiological states (I. – III.) deviating from each other in significant manner that are characterized by linear correlations of variables x1 and x2 (Figures 1a and 1b). Figure 1a. State dependent regressions in various Figure 1b. State dependent regressions in various physiological states with centre point correlation. physiological states without centre point correlation. Let the values of x1 and x2 be the results of independent parallel measurements that can, for example, originate from the foliage of some plant. Moreover, let the values of variables x1 and x2 characterize the leaves sampled by chance. If the priority or importance is only given to the means and the confidence intervals of the results x1 and x2 at describing the physiological state then physiological states will only be represented in the coordinate system of x1 and x2 as the centre points determined by the means of x1 and x2. The confidence domains will be determined by confidence ellipses. These centre point with confidence ellipses have provided no information about the existence of state dependent correlations or regressions. In this case, possibility can only be made to correlative investigation among centre points of data sets. Of course, there may be a linear correlation among them (Figure 1a) whose significant deviation from those ones of state dependent correlations will be undetectable. Moreover, the absence of correlation among centre points do not preclude the existence of state dependent correlations either (Figure 1b). In the next our conception is supported by exhibiting a few examples. In Figure 2 carbohydrate contents of leaves of European pear tree, which indicate the states of drought induced by various Carbowax treatments (0, 2, 5, 7 and 10%) of pear shoots, are depicted. The points in the coordinate system are centre points of measurements since the blending of leaf samples could integrate the deviations resulting from the foliage. The total carbohydrate content (the sum of concentrations of</p><p id="Pg140">VIII.

This correlation is a kind of centre point correlation. The decrease of metabolic intensity relating to drought stress can also be detected in the decrease of carbohydrate contents along the linear relationship. Figure 2. Effect of Carbowax treatment on carbohy- Figure 3. Effect of Fusarium infection on choline drate content in European pear tree leaf. and TML levels in various water melon tissues. The data of Figure 3 derive from Sárdi (Sárdi 1994, Sárdi and Tyihák 1998). Time domain responses of water melon varieties infected by Fusarium oxysporum, the alarm phase of this biotic stress can be tracked by the measurements of concentrations of some quaternary ammonium compounds. Among the means of choline and Nε-trimethyllysine (TML) there is a linear correlation (Figure 3). Periodic alterations of their amounts within alarm phase are highlighted with the ranks of correlation points in time. At first, the average data pairs of choline and TML shift to the directions of lower values and later they return to the higher range along the regression straight lines. This linear regression can reflect synchronic regulation of these two variables in the metabolism. Figure 4 contains the results of draining investigation of Pendunculate oak seedlings. Figure 4. Characterization of drought stress of oak Figure 5. Characterization of interruption of seedling with PPO-POD correlation. nutrient intake with PPO-POD correlation.

Cereal Research Communications 144 sampling states produced state dependent regressions that can be distinguished from each other by ANCOVA method. In this case the centre points of these regression straight lines do not create linear correlation. During manifestation of drought the centre points move to lower values. The slope of state dependent regression decreases towards the apoptosis. The decrease of coefficient of determination (r 2 ) reflects the disturbance of metabolic regulation (Németh et al. 2009a). This phenomenon also appeared in another model investigation of a specific plant stress (see. Figure 5). To model the interruption of nutrient intake a Pendunculate oak branch with more than sixty leaves were cut off and put into a bottle of water and after the POD and PPO activities of five or six leaves were measured. In this experiment such state dependent regressions were experienced that had various slopes, intercepts and coefficients of determination and whose centre points provided linear relationship with a very good fitting. Conclusions With respect to the evaluation of means and confidence intervals of biochemical variables, investigation of the correlations can supply more information about plant stress effects. In the case of classical statistical characterization this extra information in the analytical results remains hidden. State dependent correlations can be considered as the indicators of metabolic regulation.

Marianna SIPOS 1 – Ida KINCSES 1 – Emese BERTA SZABÓ 1 1 Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Debrecen, H-4032 Debrecen, Böszörményi út 138., e-mail: msipos@ agr.unideb.hu Abstract: In sense of optimization of site-specific nutrient-supply we studied the effect and interactions between hybrid, nutrient-supply and irrigation on the yield, starch-content and starch-yield within the confines of a long-term field experiment at Debrecen-Látókép. We found that the yield and the starch-content was optimal on a nutrient-level 120 : 92 : 108 kg ha-1 N : P2O5 : K2O, further inputs don’t result in significant increment. The yield was affected by all three production factors, while starch-content depended on irrigation and nutrient-supply. As a consequence starch-yield was also affected by all three studied factors. We concluded that it’s reasonable to choose inputs in accordance to the production site and the purpose. Keywords: maize, yield, starch-content, starch-yield, nutrient-supply, hybrid, irrigation, field experiment Introduction Yield of plants is primarily determined by the effects and interactions between genotype of plants as well as agrotechnical and ecological elements (Kreuz, 1977; Megyes et al., 2005; Kátai et al., 2006, Pepó et al., 2007). Production factors such as nutrient- and water-supply have a great impact on the yield amount and quality of plants (Vágó, 2008; Balláné et al., 2008; Nagy et al., 2008). In sense of site-specific nutrient-supply and the purpose of production we have to adapt to the given site by choosing the appropriate plant, nutrient- and water-supply and technology. Berzsenyi – Dang (2008) stated that hybrids with longer vegetation period produced higher grain yield. The dry matter accumulation is decreasing by plants with N-deficiency (Huzsvai – Nagy, 2003), while growing fertilization dosages (Izsáki, 2007) especially N-fertilization increases the yield (Berzsenyi – Dang, 2008). Kiss – Andorkó (2008) also observed the highest starch content in the unfertilized treatments, while parallel to the growing fertilization it decreased. Under humid conditions a higher amount of starch incorporates into the grain that leads to higher yields (Hegyi et al., 2007). Materials and methods Within the confines of a long-term field experiment in Debrecen-Látókép we studied the effect and interactions between nutrient-supply, hybrid and irrigation on the yield and starch-content of maize. Our aim was to find out and optimize the site-specific nutrientsupply for the starch-based use of these hybrids of different FAO maturity groups. The soil of the experiment represents the soils of the region: it’s a calcareous chernozem based on loess, with good fertility. The experiment was set up on a slightly acidic loamy soil with a middle plasticity. For its cultivation the upper 30 cm layer is leached. We studied the hybrids with different long vegetation periods: Mv 251 (FAO 280), Mv Koppány (FAO 420) and Mv 500 (FAO 510). We tried to reveal whether the yield and starch-content depend on the maturity group of hybrids.</p><p id="Pg143">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 146 Nutrient-supply was applied in 6 dosages with a fix 1.0 : 0.75 : 0.88 N : P2O5 : K2O rate. Besides control treatments ranged from 30 : 23 : 27 to 150 : 115 : 135 kg ha -1 N : P2O5 : K2O active substance. The half of the experimental area can be irrigated by linear irrigation system. It has to be noted that from the aspect of distribution of precipitation the year 2008 was optimal, so there was no need to apply any additional water-amount. Still it is reasonable to investigate both irrigated and not irrigated combinations to reveal the long-term effect of irrigation. On the other half of the experimental area plants use only water input from precipitation. We measured the yield per each treatment and the starch content of grain in year 2008 at an average moisture content of 14%. We analysed our results statistically by a 3-way ANOVA using the software developed by Tolner (2008). Results and discussion Regarding the yield (t ha-1) results it can be stated that in the year 2008 it was determined by all 3 plant production factors: nutrient-supply, irrigation and hybrid at P = 0.1 % significance level. The interaction between the nutrient-supply and the hybrid was also significant at P = 1.0 %. Therefore all 3 factors– in lack of – are potential stress factors. The yield amounts – depending on the hybrid and the nutrient-supply levels – are shown in Figure 1. The hybrid Mv 251 produced yield at a range from 4.89 (control treatment) to 10.57 t ha -1 (highest nutrient-level: 150 kg ha -1 N, 115 kg ha -1 P2O5 and 135 kg ha -1 K2O). Parallel to the growing nutrient levels the yield showed a growing tendency, still there was no difference between the two highest dosages; therefore in sense of the sitespecific nutrient-supply it’s reasonable to apply lower dosage without any loss of yield. The yield of Mv Koppány was significantly higher than that of Mv 251 in all treatment combinations. The yield ranged from 7.6 to 12.1 t ha -1 . The higher nutrient dosage was applied, the higher yield was measured, still there could not be revealed a significant difference between nutrient dosages of closer fertilizer active substance rates (60 : 46 : 54 kg ha -1 vs. 90 : 69 : 81 kg ha -1 N : P2O5 : K2O, respectively 120 : 92 : 108 vs. 150 : 115 : 135 kg ha -1 N : P2O5 : K2O). Compared with the two hybrids of shorter vegetation periods it can be stated that the yield of hybrid Mv 500 was significantly higher than that of Mv 251, but in some treatments it did not differ from Mv Koppány. It has to be noted, that at lower nutrientsupply levels Mv Koppány (middle maturity group) produced a higher amount of yield than Mv 500 (longer maturity group). On a middle nutrient-supply rate there was no difference between the yields of the two hybrids, still by higher nutrient levels the yield of Mv 500 was significantly higher. This fact lets us conclude that for the production of higher yield amount plants need higher nutrient dosages, therefore a high dosage of fertilizers enable plants to produce the potentially highest yield. The lowest yield (5.27 t ha -1 ) was also measured in the control treatment, while the highest (14.48 t ha -1 ) at a nutrient level 120 : 92 : 108 kg ha -1 N : P2O5 : K2O. In case of all 3 hybrids – however in different rates – it’s possible that in the control and low nutrient dosages were the stress factors, because yield didn’t reach the potential rate.</p><p id="Pg144">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 147 The significant effect of irrigation could be observed in all treatments, although there was no additional water-supply in 2008 (theoretically water supply didn’t mean a direct stress factor). This effect can be explained by the cumulative effect of irrigation on the nutrient-amount in the root zone of plants: in the irrigated treatments plant roots took up more nutrients, so in this year there was a lower plant-available nutrient-amount in those treatments. Still it would not be reasonable to confirm the long-term effect of irrigation upon these one-year results. Figure 1. Yield of maize (t ha-1) depending on the nutrient-levels and hybrids Figure 2. Starch-content (%) of maize depending on the nutrient-levels and hybrids The starch-content (%) of the yield grain depending on the hybrid and the nutrientsupply is shown in Figure 2. As the statistical analysis confirmed, it was affected by the irrigation (P = 5 %) and the nutrient-supply (P = 10 %), it varied between 60.1 and 63.4 %. The maximal starch-content was measured in the control treatment, while parallel to the growing nutrient-levels it decreased – but not always significantly. The starch-content of irrigated treatments was higher than of not irrigated ones. It is also reasonable to investigate the starch-yield (t ha-1) because it gives us further information to optimize the starch-based production. The starch-yield of Mv 251 was the lowest: in the control treatment it produced 3.07, while by 120 : 92 : 108 kg ha -1 N : P2O5 : K2O fertilizer active substance the starch-yield was 6.47 t ha -1 . There was no difference between the two highest nutrient levels. The starch-yield of Mv Koppány varied between 3.7 (control) and 8.27 t ha -1 , so it was significantly higher than that of Mv 251. It is due to its longer vegetation – therefore starch synthesis – period and to the higher yield. There was no difference between the starch-yield of the 2 highest nutrient dosages, so it is more reasonable to apply a lower amount of fertilizer. The starch-yield of Mv 500 ranged from 3.30 to 8.89 t ha -1 . It was definitely higher than Mv 251. But by lower nutrient levels it stayed under the Mv Koppány, because the amount of nutrients wasn’t enough for plant development (nutrient stress). However by middle dosages there was no difference and by higher dosages it was significantly higher. It suggests that to reach the maximal starch-yield we have to supply the plant’s demand – avoid firstly nutrient stress – and use higher inputs. It also has to be noted that the longer vegetation period means a plus risk for plant production (more stress factors like weather conditions, diseases etc. can reach plants),</p><p id="Pg145">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 148 still in many production sites it is worth to take it. Anyway we have to choose production factors and inputs considering the production site. Conclusions Summarizing the yield results it can be stated that beside nutrient-supply the production of maize strongly depends on the hybrid and additional production factors, such as irrigation. To avoid stress and the fall-back of the yield it’s reasonable to choose hybrids and inputs in accordance with the site parameters and the results of previous years. Choosing a hybrid with a shorter vegetation period the yield will be safe, but lower and the opposite: a hybrid with longer vegetation period result a higher (starch)-yield but it needs higher nutrient-input levels and the yield is more exposed to the stress effects through the year.

Gödöllı, Hungary, e-mail: tarnawa.akos@mkk.szie.hu 2 HAS-SIU Agronomy Research Group, Gödöllı Abstract: Weed canopy and species composition has been studied in relation with two climatic factors – precipitation and temperature – in a long term trial. 12 years experimental series of winter wheat and maize agronomic trials run at the Szent István University’s Nagygombos experimental site have been evaluated regarding coenological performance of weed-crop interrelation. 28 weed species representing 7 phenological types (T1, T2, T2-3, T3, T4, G1 and G3) were examined in relation with seasonal precipitation and temperature prior to their life cycles. Strong correlations were found in cases of various precipitation patterns, however in some cases precipitation x temperature interactions proved to be significant as well. Keywords: weed-crop coenology, precipitation, temperature, stress Introduction Abiotic stresses are most common means regarding alterations within weed-crop coenoses. Weed development in a certain agri-environment is highly influenced by climatic conditions – precipitation and temperature, as well as agronomic applications (Jolánkai-Birkás, 2007; Jolánkai et al., 2008; Kassai et al., 2006; Láng et al., 2007). Weed development, canopy and species composition are exposed to several factors. Most of these are performed in accordance with the phenological type of weeds (Berzsenyi et al., 2006; Szentpétery et al. 2006; Szentpétery et al 2007; Varga et al. 2007). The present study is dealing with weed-crop performance in relation with precipitation and temperature induced stresses over a 12 years period in a winter wheat – maize (Triticum aestivum L. – Zea mays L) long term trial at the Nagygombos experimental site. Materials and methods In long term field trials a wide range winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. varieties and maize Zea mays L. hybrids were examined under identical agronomic conditions in the experimental years of 1996-2007. The small plot trials were run at the Nagygombos experimental field of the SZIU Crop Production Institute. Soil type of the experimental field is chernozem (calciustoll). Experiments were conducted in split-plot design with four replications. The size of each plot was 10 m 2 . Plots were planted and harvested by plot machines. Various agronomic treatments were applied to plots. Weed control (furoxipir, bromoxynil, dicamba and MCPA a.i.), the rate and application time of nitrogen top dressing (ammonium nitrate 0-40-80 kgha -1 in direct and split applications), fungicides and insecticides (triadimefon, tebukonazol+triadimefon, besultap a.i.) were applied in single and combined treatments. Coenological performance of weed-crop interrelation have been evaluated. 28 weed species representing 7 phenological types (T1, T2, T2-3, T3, T4, G1 and G3) were examined in relation with seasonal precipitation and temperature prior to their life cycles. Weed canopy records have been</p><p id="Pg147">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Results and discussion Twelve years (1996-2007) herbology and coenology data have been evaluated in favour of exploring climatic impacts – mainly that of precipitation and temperature records.

Correlations were found between weed canopy records and precipitation and temperature values of certain periods in relation with phenophases or periods prior to vegetation, and their combinations. Table 2 indicates significant correlation values and equations. The results obtained support an evidence, that weed populations have been influenced by precipitation patterns mainly. The occurence of precipitation has not always been related to the vegetation period, but more to the phenology pattern of the weed species examined. Early annual weed populations have been correlated with precipitation in most cases, however late annuals were affected by temperature values as well. From among perennial G1 species no correlations were obtained. G3 species were affected by</p><p id="Pg148">VIII.

Figure 1 shows the changes in canopies and their tendencies. It can be stated, that the originally homogenous coenosys of weed species has been altered by both monocropping and biculture. Also, there is a notable phenomenon regarding the decrement of some highly frequented weeds like Echinocloa or Ambrosia species. Conclusions Canopy and species composition of dominant weeds has been studied in relation with two climatic factors – precipitation and temperature – in a long term trial. 12 years experimental series of winter wheat and maize agronomic trials run at the Nagygombos, Hungary experimental site have been evaluated regarding coenological performance of weed-crop interrelation. 28 weed species belonging to seven phenological types (T1, T2, T2-3, T3, T4, G1 and G3) have been examined in relation with seasonal and prior to their life cycles values of precipitation and temperature. Strong correlations were found in cases of various precipitation patterns. Some precipitation x temperature interactions proved to be significant, mainly in perennial types.

Box 71, Hungary, e-mail: cseh.eszter@2002.georgikon.hu Abstract: Leaf samples bearing virus symptoms were collected from different vineyards of West Hungary in the summer. Samples were analyzed by DAS-ELISA for Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Tomato black ring virus (TBRV), Grapevine chrome mosaic virus (GCMV), Grapevine leafroll associated virus 1-3 (GLRaV 1-3) and Grapevine virus A (GVA). Among about fifty samples eighteen were positive in serological tests. Six proved to be infected by GLRaV-1, one by GLRaV-2, eight by GLRaV-3. GCMV were found in six cases. ArMV and GFLV occurred once, TBRV in two samples. Complex infections (GLRV-1 and -3; GCMV and GLRaV-1; GCMV and GLRaV-3; GCMV and ArMV) were detected in seven occasions. In autumn canes of the same stocks were also collected to isolate the pathogens for further studies. In the serological assay the different groups of GLRaV proved to be the most abundant virus. However, according to the symptoms in the vineyards the grapevines degeneration was also important. To solve this difference the overwintered canes should be checked by woody indexing on indicator grapes species and by mechanical transmission onto herbaceous plants. The majority of viruses of grapevines are detectable by ELISA tests, but not all. The occurrence of virus transmitting nematodes will be discussed. Keywords: virus, grapevine, nematode, ELISA Introduction Grapevine productions have serious pathological problems, especially the grapevine degeneration and the ESCA disease causing the early decline of grape stocks. Some of them could be solved by the changing of rootstock varieties (Cseh et al., 2006), but the problem of virus disease remained unsolved (Cseh et al., 2008a). The results of constant infections are: reduced yield and quality, shortening in productive period, weakening in rooting of propagation materials, reduction in disease resistance to abiotic and biotic stressors, and at least the early dieback of grape stocks (Cseh et al, 2008b). The main object of our study was to collect samples from different vineyards in West Hungary. Additionally we tried to find correlation between the occurrence of virus diseases and the presence of virus vector nematodes in the same area. Materials and methods Leaf samples showing disease symptoms were collected from different vineyards of the west Hungarian region in summer and autumn, 2008. Until ELISA test leaf samples were store for some days on 4 o C in special plastic bags. Virus content was checked by DAS ELlSA method using antisera from Agritest S.r.l. (Italy) and Bioreba AG (Switzerland), Loewe Biochemica (Germany). Substrate absorbances were measured at 405 nm wavelengths on Labsystem Multiscan ELISA reader (Clark and Adams 1977, Takács et al, 2006a). Samples were considered positive if the absorbance values exceeded three times those of the healthy controls (Horváth et al, 2007, Takács et al, 2006b). Soil samples infested by nematodes were taken from the upper 5 cm depth (Nádasy et al, 2000, 2002, 2008). The isolation of nematodes were based on their active</p><p id="Pg151">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 155 Conclusions Until now fifteen different virus diseases have been reported in Hungary (Cseh et al., 2008a, b). Half of them are soil-borne pathogens, transmitted by nematode vectors. Soil-borne viruses can reduce crop yield and their impact is particularly acute in the degeneration and early decline of vine stocks. The second half part of the viruses spread by aphids and mealy bugs and the remaining group of viruses whose mode of transmission is not known. In 2008 in the West-Hungarian vineyards among the viruses infecting grapevines GFLV, ArMV, GCMV, TBRV, GLRaV 1-3 viruses could be detected by visual and serological means. According to the serological study the most abundant viruses were belonging to the GLRaV group. The detection of nepoviruses was not always reliable because the high level of phenolic compounds of the leaves. In the field fan leaf symptoms were the most frequent; however the presence of nepoviruses were not demonstrated in every case. At presence their serodiagnosis became possible by using antioxidants in the extraction buffer. In autumn ripened branches were collected from the same sites, and serological diagnoses will be repeated from the rooted branches in the spring. By this method it will be possible to modify the significance of specific viruses in the degradation process of grape stocks. Practically all samples made from the grape growing areas proved the presence of nematode species. However until now among the virus vector nematodes only the occurrence of Xyphinema ssp. was identified. The control of grapevine virus diseases has been improved by the application of sanitary methods: as heat therapy and shoot apex culture for virus eradication from clones. In the control of virus diseases especially the overwintering weeds, natural host of virus diseases has especially impact (Mikulás et al. 2003, Kazinczi et al. 2007, 2008). Recently very few data are available on the susceptibility or resistance of grapevine species or colonies to distinct viruses, which can profoundly influence the degree of economic loss. Therefore in the future careful studies are needed to compare this behaviour of Hungarian grape varieties. Acknowledgements We are grateful to the National Scientific Research Found (OTKA K67658).

Éva ERDEI1 – Pál PEPÓ1 – Norbert BOROS2 – Szilárd TÓTH1– Béla SZABÓ1 1Department of Horticulture and Plant Biotechnology Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering 2Institute of Food Science, Assurance and Microbiology University of Debrecen Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, H – 4032 Debrecen Böszörményi str. 138., e-mail: evaerdei@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Plant adapt to heat stress by morphological, biochemical and metabolic changes. Sweet sorghum is a C4 type plant characterized by a high photosynthetic efficiency and drought tolerance. Reducing sugar component has an important part of drought tolerance. There was a decrease in the accumulation of total sugar/protein content due to the heat stress. Increase of proline concentration showed a positive correlation with the increase of reducing sugar concentration. Accumulation of soluble materials will increase the osmotic potential and as a consequence will create seasonal osmoregulation capability. Under field conditions we estimated the reaction of RL 4, RL 9, RL 15, RL 18, K1 restorer sweet sorghum lines to heat stress. There were differences between lines in total sugar (SD5%=0.79), reducing sugar (SD5%=0.30) and protein content (SD5%=0.034). Under stress conditions we measured the highest reducing sugar content in case of RL 18 (4.11 %) during waxy maturation. In most cases we measured the highest values in case of RL 15, which were the following: reducing sugar content 3.23 %, protein 0.25 % and total sugar 15.43 % and furthermore the degree of foliation were the highest 26.57. Plant heights were between 184.6 and 259.6 cm and the degree of foliation changed between 18.14 and 26.57. Total sugar varied between 10.07 % and 15.43 % and reducing sugar 3.17 and 4.11 % in waxy maturation. In juvenile plant parts the concentration of fructose and glucose was higher than that of the sucrose. During drought conditions the soluble sugars maintain the reasonable turgor level. In different sweet sorghum genotypes the reducing sugars and the proteins are the indicators of drought tolerance/resistance. Keywords: sweet sorghum, drought tolerance, reducing sugar. Introduction Due to climate change plants with drought tolerance, as sweet sorghum, are very important. Primary gene centers are semi arid and subtropical regions, where annual precipitation is less than 1200 mm. Sorghum is well adapted to arid zones, therefore it can be cultivated in several countries of Europe, where in growing period temperature amount is between 2500-3000 °C, and the annual precipitation is between 350-400 mm. This grain crop is the fifth most important cereal grown worldwide, due particularly to its unusual tolerance to adverse environmental conditions (Gill et al., 2003). Part of extensive breeding programs, sorghum is well adapted to low-input conditions as well as to biotic and abiotic stress factors (Uptmoor et al., 2006). The plant adapts to abiotic stress by different mechanisms including changes in the morphological pattern, biochemical processes and metabolic changes (Lásztity, 2003). Major differences in stress adaptation between species and cultivars may depend on allelic differences in a small number of genes, as suggested for genes controlling responses to drought (Galiba, 2002). Sorghum as breeding materials helps to increase yield and to maintain the stability of crop productivity by serving as a source for tolerance to environmental stress, especially drought (Mamo et al., 2007). It is necessary to produce plants with good adaptability and drought resistance altogether with the commonly used cereals (Erdei and Pepó, 2008). As a C4 type of plant, it has a high photosynthetic efficiency and drought tolerance (Channappagoudar et al., 2007). Sorghum has thick epidermis and waxy leaves, which</p><p id="Pg155">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 158 detain water submission and assist regeneration (Billa et al., 1997). In vegetation period C4 plants are also able to absorb higher volume of CO2 as a result of their more effective photosynthesis. C4 plants have higher CO2 compensation point and their daily dry mass production is more intensive than that of C3 plants (Lehoczky and Tóth, 2005). C4 plants have far the largest intensity of maximum net photosynthesis, optimal temperature and productivity of photosynthesis, at the same time the transpiration coefficient is less than that of C3 plants (Mojzes and Kalapos, 2008). Drought tolerance was indicated in early period by proline content of water deficient leaves, then by proline dehydrogenase activity. Activity of glutathione reductase and antioxidase enzymes were in connection with drought tolerance. (Pintér, 1997). Abiotic stress is a multigenic trait, that has an effect on synthesis of proteins, enzymes and metabolites. Osmotic stress effects water and ion transport in cellular membranes, maintaining homeostasis. Under heat stress proteins denaturate. In short-term stress experiments, decrease in sucrose and strach content was observed. In long term experiments, a higher amount of soluble sugars and a lower amount of starch were found under heat stress. In drought tolerant plants the trehalose, as non-reducing sugar is important, which absorb reversible water and protects against desiccation. In solutions the following compounds are accumulated: mannitol (mannitol phosphatase dehydrogenase), sucrose, maltose, glucose, phenols, proline and reducing sugar. Materials and methods The experiment was set in the garden of the Department of Horticulture and Plant Biotechnology, UD Faculty of Agricultural Science. The experiment was planted on 18 th April 2007; under field conditions we estimated the reaction of five restorer sweet sorghum lines to heat stress. The examined lines were the following: RL 4, RL 9, RL 15, RL 18, control. The aim of the experiment was to determinate the metabolic changes of plants by morphological and biochemical data. We measured the following morphological characteristics of drought tolerance: plant height, number of leaves and determined the degree of foliation. We examined dry matter content, which was determinates by refractometer, total sugar, reducing sugar, protein content and non-reducing sugar for data on nutritional value. Plots were set 30 m x 5 m (150 m 2 ) per each, and distance between rows was 75 cm. In vegetation period from May to August we determinates beneficial (useful) temperature amount, maximum- and average temperature and precipitation. Morphological parameters and nutritional value were evaluated with SPSS program. Results and discussion Sweet sorghum restorer lines, belong to C4 type plants, were investigated in growing period from May 5 to August 30. Maximum of C4 type plants photosynthesis is 35 0 C. We set our experiment in a drought period, when the highest temperature was 38.3 0 C, and the precipitation was 32 mm/month. In vegetation period the beneficial temperature amount was 2627.2 0 C. Sorghum is originated from tropical areas so we set 10 0 C as basic temperature (Table 1.).</p><p id="Pg156">VIII.

In drought period soluble sugar has important role to maintain osmotic concentration and the turgor level of leaves. The plant accumulated reducing sugar in solution. Reducing sugar content of total sugar varied between 3.17 and 4.11 % in waxy maturation. Under stress conditions we measured the highest reducing sugar content in case of RL 18. This value was 4.11 % in waxy maturation. In the case of RL 4 we measured 4.01 % reducing sugar in solution. In the control plant reducing sugar content was 1.52 %. There were differences between lines in reducing sugar (SD5%=0.30), as an indicator of heat stress. In these tolerant genotypes the reducing sugar was accumulated in leaves, under and upper internodium. Accumulation of soluble materials increased the osmotic potential and as a consequence created seasonal osmoregulation capability. Due to drought stomata closed and photosynthesis decreased therefore there was decrease in the accumulation of sucrose. The above mentioned can be explained by the high reducing sugar level. In waxy maturation more reducing sugar was accumulated than in the full maturation (Table 2).

Plants adapt to environmental stresses by molecular processes. These processes are importanat to maintain homeostasis. Adaptation is developed by morphology and physiology. Our experiments were set under field conditions in a drought period, when temperature was 38 0 C and precipitation was 32.2 mm/month. In vegetation period the beneficial temperature amount was 2627.2 0 C. Due to drought the stomata of plants closed and sucrose metabolism decreased. Due to osmotic stress reducing sugar was accumulated in solutions. There was decrease in accumulation of total sugar, non-reducing sugar and protein content. We measured the highest reducing sugar content in case of RL 18 (4.11 %), in the case of RL 4 we measured 4.01 %. In the case of RL 18 degree of foliation was 18.14 and the plant height was 254 cm, while in the case of RL 4 plant height was 184.60 cm and the degree of foliation was 21.46. These lines were stress tolerant. In different sweet sorghum genotypes the reducing sugars and the proteins are the indicators of drought tolerance/resistance. References Billa E.- Dimitris P.

HAFEZ1 – Zoltán KIRÁLY2 – Klára MANNINGER1 1 Permanent address: Department of Agricultural Botany (Plant Pathology Branch), Faculty of Agriculture, Kafrelsheikh University, Kafr-El-Sheikh, Egypt, e-mail:hafezyasser@gmail.com 2 Plant Protection Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary Abstract: In the resistant infected plants reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced after inoculation, such as superoxide (O2 .-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH ·), etc. Wheat leaves of resistant and susceptible cultivars were inoculated with wheat leaf rust, Puccinia triticina. Levels of H2O2 were determined applying xylenol orange, 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB). In susceptible host/pathogen combinations accumulation of H2O2 did not occur. However, level of H2O2 was high in resistant cultivars. We have shown that if we inoculate wheat with an inappropriate barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei) creating a non-host type resistance, accumulation of H2O2 also occurred very early. Keywords: Hydrogen peroxide, disease resistance, non-host resistance, wheat leaf rust Introduction It was shown earlier that after infection plant tissue necrotization including the HR (hypersensitive reaction) is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (cf. Király et al., 2007, 2008). Furthermore, a few publications also referred to the in vitro as well as in vivo sensitivity of plant pathogens to the action of ROS (Tzeng and DeVay, 1993, Ouf et al., 1993, Wu et al., 1997, El-Zahaby et al., 2004). The mechanism of non-host resistance of plants is only partially understood (Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga, 2003, Schweizer, 2007, Király et al., 2007). So far, almost no experimental results have been achieved which would explain the question: what is indeed arresting or killing the pathogen in the non-host resistant plants? The aim of our research was to study the role of one of the ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in symptom expression of leaf rust resistant wheat cultivars and in various non-host/pathogen combinations. Materials and methods We used wheat (Triticum sativum L.) resistant cultivars Thatcher (near isogenic lines Lr9 and Lr19) and the Egyptian Sakha 94, Giza 168 and Gimmeza 9, and the susceptible Egyptian Sakha 61 and the Hungarian Délibáb as well as the German R 23 cultivars. Wheat leaf rust Puccinia triticina (P. recondita f.sp. tritici) pathotype 43522 and barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, race A6) were used. Histochemical analysis of H2O2: DAB method: Leaf discs (2 cm) were vacuum infiltrated or injected with a 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) according to Ádám et al. (1989) and Hückelhoven et al. (1999). Level of H2O2 was measured several times after infection. Xylenol orange method: To detect H2O2 spectrophotometrically with a peroxidase independent reaction, a xylenol orange based method was used according to the method of Gay et al., (1999). DCFH-DA method: 2,7-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA)</p><p id="Pg159">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 162 reacts with H2O2 in the presence of peroxidase yielding the fluorescent 2,7dichlorofluorescein (DCF). We used the method described by Lu and Higgins (1998) with modifications. Results and discussion Leaves of resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars were inoculated with wheat leaf rust, Puccinia triticina pathotype 43522. Accumulation of H2O2 measured with the DAB method was very low in infected compatible wheat/pathogen combinations or there was no accumulation at all (Fig.1). In incompatible combinations (resistant cultivars producing HR) accumulation of H2O2 was significantly high and began to accumulate three days after inoculation. If we inoculated wheat leaves with an inappropriate fungus, the barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei), we created a non-host type resistance, with lack of HR. Accumulation of H2O2 in these non-host resistant plants was also very intensive and began earlier (1 DAI) than in the resistant but host plants (Fig. 2). Accumulation of ROS in infected or stressed plants seems to be a general phenomenon and may be related to the resistance phenomenon of infected or stressed plants (Doke, 1983, Barna et al., 1993, Lamb and Dixon, 1997, Deák et al., 1999, Király, 2000, Király and Király, 2006, Király et al., 2007). On basis of the hypothesis of Bendahmane et al. (1999) in connection with plant virus resistance, one can suppose that the early accumulation of H2O2 in non-host plants is the cause of killing the rust early after infection, therefore the HR cannot develop. In the resistant but host plants, the pathogen can develop for a short while before it is inhibited or killed, and this would be the reason for the development of HR. However, in the susceptible host accumulation of H2O2 is very low or missing, thus the pathogen can induce the typical rust symptoms in wheat leaves. Figure 1.

IN LONG TERM EXPERIMENT Ádám LENTE Institute of Crop Sciences, Agronomy Faculty, Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, University of Debrecen, H-4032., Debrecen, Böszörményi str. 138., e-mail:lente@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: We have been studied some agricultural factors (plant density, fertilization) the crop year (different water supply years: 2007.= dry, 2008.= optimal) effect on the yields of the corn in different crop-rotation (mono-, bi-, triculture) in long term experiment, on chernozem soil in the Hajdúság. We did not applied irrigation in both crop years. The water supply of the year like an abiotic stress factor was the strongest effect on the corn yields and it determined the optimal plant density and the dose of fertilizer. In dry year (2007) the maximum yield of corn were almost 5 000 kg ha-1 (mono), 8 000 kg ha-1 (bi), higher than 8 000 kg ha-1 (tri), and in an optimal water supply year (2008) over than 13 000 kg ha-1 (mono), 14 000 kg ha-1 (bi) and close to 15 000 kg ha-1 (tri) without irrigation. The yield decreasements caused by abiotic stress (water deficit) were 9.0 t ha-1 (mono), 7.0 t ha-1 (bi) and 6.0 t ha-1 (triculture), respectively. The ecological stress (waterdeficit) and the agrotechnical stress (crop-rotation) affected the optimal plant number and dose of fertilizer. In a dry crop year (2007) the optimum plant density was 40 000 ha-1 (mono-, bi-, triculture) and in an optimum water supply crop year (2008) it varied between 60 000 ha-1 (mono) and 80 000 ha-1 (bi, tri), respectively. The crop year and the crop-rotation change the optimal dose of fertilizer. Our scientific results proved that the corn is very sensitive to ecological and agricultural stress effects. Keywords: maize, crop year, crop-rotation, plant density, fertilization, yield Introduction Maize is a high productivity crop which is produced on 1.1-1.2 million ha in Hungary. The average yields range between 4-7 t ha -1 depending on the cropyears and the production level (Pepó et al., 2006). Increasingly frequent extreme weather conditions prove that climate change is a real problem and can increase the rate of dry years in Hungary (Sárvári, 2005). In extremely dry year (1990) the kernel yield of fodder maize dropped to its half as a result of increasing NP fertilization (Kádár-Márton, 2007) furthermore, the higher than optimal crop density increases water need and makes plant more sensitive to draught (Sárvári, 2009). According to experiments by Nagy (2007) conducted on chernozem soil for two decades crop year significantly influences yield fluctuation which can reach 7 t/ha. Yield decrease was highest in monoculture in 2007, when the increase of fertilizer doses caused further yield depression (Pepó et al., 2008). For successful maize production harmonized nutrient supply is needed and especially nitrogen supplementation is of high importance. The optimal nitrogen dose is influenced by soil, cliamtic factors, genotype and agrotechnical factors (Bocz and Nagy, 1981). According to Berzsenyi and Dang (2008) in favourable year the highest yield was obtained at 120 kg N ha -1 fertilizer dose while in unfavourable year the optimal fertilizer dose was 60 kg N ha -1 .</p><p id="Pg163">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 166 Materials and methods The examinations were carried out on the Látókép Research Site of the University of Debrecen Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Institute of Crop Sciences. The soil of the research site is calcerous chernozem. The examinations were conducted in long term experiment set by Ruzsányi in 1983 and controlled by Pepó from 2004. Our experiment covered the years of 2007 and 2008. The experiment involves three crop rotation systems: monoculture (maize), biculture (wheat-maize) and triculture (pea-wheat-maize). Five fertilization doses and three crop density levels were used. The five fertilization levels are as follows: control (untreated), N60P45K45, N120P90K90, N180P135K135, N240P180K180, the three plant density levels are 40 thousand ha -1 , 60 thousand ha -1 and 80 thousand ha -1 . Concerning ecologic stress effects, 2007 is considered dry while 2008 was favourable. Table 1 shows the precipitation and monthly temperature in the growing season in the two years. Table 1.

The effectiveness of fertilization is significantly influenced by the status of the soil, water supply and biologic and agrotechnical factors. We examined some agrotechnical factors (fertilization, plant density) in different crop rotation systems (mono-, bi- and triculture) in long term field trial set in the Látókép Research Experimental Station, Universiy of Debrecen 25, years ago. The cropyear of 2007 was rather dry (unfavourable) and 2008 was humid (favourable). In 2007 in the period from March to June the amount of precipitation was 80.8 mm lower than the 30year average. However, in 2008 in each month of the growing season the amount of precipitation was either average or above, therefore the precipitation in the vegetation period was 147.0 mm higher. In both growing seasons the monthly temperature values increased the many-years average (in 2007 by 2.3 °C and in 2008 by 2.2 °C) The stress caused by monoculture cultivation was significant in the dry cropyear of 2007 when yields ranged between 3874 - 5681 kg ha -1 . In the same year, yields ranged between 7156 - 7929 kg ha -1 in biculture and 7214 - 8192 t ha -1 in triculture according to</p><p id="Pg164">VIII.

In 2008 the yields were as follows: 12902-13787 kg ha (monoculture), 13974-14603 kg ha (biculture) and 13594- 14839 kg ha (triculture). On non-treated fertilized (control) plots in the dry cropyear of 2007 the highest yields were obtained at each plant density levels (40-, 60-, 80 ezer ha -1 ) in triculture crop rotation (6526- 7938 t ha -1 ). In the favourable cropyear of 2008 the excellent nutrient supplying capacity of chernozem soil was well reflected by yields. In 2008 the maximum yields were harvested from biculture control plots with yields ranging between 11328- 12128 t ha -1 . 2007 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 Mono Bi Tri Mono Bi Tri Mono Bi Tri 40 thousand ha-1 60 thousand ha-1 80 thousand ha-1 yi el d kg h a1 Ø N60+PK N120+PK N180+PK N240+PK 2008 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 Mono Bi Tri Mono Bi Tri Mono Bi Tri 40 thousand ha-1 60 thousand ha-1 80 thousand ha-1 yi el d kg h a1 Ø N60+PK N120+PK N180+PK N240+PK Figure 1.

In 2007 the N240+PK fertilizer treatment caused the following yield losses: at 40 thousand ha -1 plant density level in triculture 842 kg ha -1 , at 60 thousand ha -1 plant density level in monoculture 198 kg ha -1 , in triculture 86 kg ha -1 , at 80 thousand ha -1 crop density level 471 kg ha -1 , and in triculture 434 kg ha -1 . This effect (witch value was between 3-19 %) can be considered as abiotic stress (Bocz, 1976). Contrary, in the humid crop year of 2008 at each plant density level and in each crop rotation system the lowest yield was obtained from control plots with yields ranging between 8590- 11769 kg ha -1 . In 2008 in the N120+PK treatment the highest yield was obtained at 40 thousand ha -1 and 60 thousand ha -1 plant density level in bi- and triculture, and in the N180+PK treatment at 40 thousand ha -1 and 60 thousand ha -1 plant density level in monoculture and at 80 thousand ha -1 crop density level in mono-, bi- and triculture. In dry year lower crop density level is optimal. In all three crop rotation systems the highest yield was obtained at 40 thousand ha -1 crop density level (monoculture 5681 kg ha -1 , biculture 7926 kg ha -1 and triculture 8192 kg ha -1 ). The lowest yields were obtained at 80 thousand ha -1 crop density level in each crop rotation system. In favourable year (2008) the highest yield was obtained at 60 thousand ha -1 plant density level in monoculture (13787 kg ha -1 ), while in bi- and triculture the highest yield was obtained at 80 thousand ha -1 crop density level (14603 kg ha -1 in biculture and 14839 kg ha -1 in triculture) Conclusions The polifactorial long term experiment set in Látókép 25 years ago allowed of the joint analysis of agrotechnical (crop rotation, nutrient supply, plant density) and environmental (cropyear) factors. The optimal agrotechnical conditions were at different agrotechnical levels. In the dry crop year of 2007 the highest yield was obtained in triculture at N60+PK fertilizer dose at 40 thousand ha -1 plant density level (8192 kg ha -1 ), while in the favourable crop year of 2008 the highest yield was obtained in triculture at N180+PK fertilizer dose at 80 thousand ha -1 plant density level (14839 kg ha -1 ).

Two years quite different climatic conditions were selected for the investigations. Spring weather in 2006 was extremely rainy, ordinary warm and cloudy. In contrast with that 2007 was a bit rainy, extremely warm and very sunny. Growth and development of bromegrass were significantly different in the investigation years. More favourable conditions had positive effects not only on the size of plant parts but on the differentiation of these plant parts as well. Regression analysis showed different correlation between independent climatic variables and phenological traits of bromegrass during primary growth in both years. Strong positive correlations were found between annual rainfall, annual temperature sum, annual sum of sunny hours as independent variables and extended shoot height (ESH), number of leaves developed (NL), number of dead leaves (NDL) as dependent variables. Other morphological traits, number of active leaves per shoot and sum of active leaf lamina lengths responded differently to climatic variables. It is concluded that the vegetative growth (size of plant parts) is more influenced by existing weather conditions than development of new shoots (tiller bud differentiation). Keywords: climatic conditions, grass growth and development, bromegrass Introduction Biomass production of temperate grasses during primary growth primarily is constituted from the development and growth of vegetative shoots, consisting of leaves. The differentiation and growth of leaves under natural conditions are determined by soil and climatic conditions. While soil conditions on a given site may be considered as constant, climatic conditions under continental climate may differ from year to year to a great extend. From climatic conditions light (irradiance and photoperiod), temperature and water supply are considered (Robson et al., 1988) as key factors influencing growth and development of grasses during primary growth. In a basic research programme between 2004-2007 data were collected on the existing weather conditions and field measurements were made on the growth and development of some grasses including bromegrass during primary growth. Based on the data of meteorological conditions and morphological measurements on spring grass growth, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of some climatic variables on grass growth and development as well as to search correlation between climatic conditions and grass growth. Materials and methods Results of this investigation will refer to field conditions existing at the demonstration garden of Debrecen University, Agricultural Centre. Meteorological data for the periods of primary growth of investigation years were measured by the local observatory. Annual rainfall, annual temperature sum and annual sum of sunny hours will be considered as abiotic environmental variables for grass growth.

Measurements data on the growth and development of bromegrass during primary growth were taken from sets of data collected between 2004 and 2007 in a basic research programme (Nagy, 2008). Identification of the different traits for growth and development as well as the methods of measurements of these traits were formerly discribed in details by Nagy (2008). To catch the correlation between environmental variables and spring growth of bromegrass, two years with more or less extreme climatic conditions (2006 and 2007) were selected for the investigations. The regression analysis between independent (annual rainfall, annual temperature sum, annual sum of sunny hours) and dependent variables (morphological traits of bromegrass) was made by using General Linear Model of the SPSS 13.0 for Windows (2004) software. Results and discussion The climatic conditions Weather conditions of selected years were quite different (Figure 1). The climatic index for grass growth (Vinczeffy, 1991) was autstandingly higher and slightly lower than 40 year average through the investigation periods in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Figure 1. The climate index for grass growth To find the reasons for these differences the relative availability of key environmental variables compared to the 40 year average was calculated (Table 1). On the basis of this calculation the nature of the year for 2006 was extremely rainy, ordinary warm and cloudy. In contrast with that 2007 was a bit rainy, extremely warm and very sunny. 0,00 0,10 0,20 0,30 0,40 0,50 0,60 IV.15. IV.30. V.10. V.20. V.30.

The relative differences (2007=100%) for these traits were 79%, 29%, 19% and 36% respectively. These results suppose that more favourable conditions had positive effects not only on the size of plant parts (ESH, SALL) but on the differentiation of these plant parts as well (NL, NAL). However the size of effects are different depending on the plant morphological traits. Table 2.

In 2006, when climate conditions were favourable for grass growth strong positive correlation was found between climatic variables and SALL. However in 2007, when climatic conditions were not favourable for spring grass growth, the effects of climatic variables were negative on SALL, without any statistical correlation between them. The results of regression analysis indicate that climatic conditions as variables have different effects on growth and development of bromegrass. The vegetative growth (size of plant parts) is more influenced by existing weather conditions than development of new shoots (tiller bud differentiation).

Box 19, H-2462 Martonvásár, e-mail: csmonika@mail.mgki.hu 2 The Cereal Research Non-Profit Company, P.O. Box 391, H-6701 Szeged Abstract: Tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) is an important biotic stress factor of wheat, causing significant yield reductions in wheat growing areas throughout the world. Differences in susceptibility are known to occur between wheat varieties, but the level of resistance of the Hungarian varieties currently grown is more or less unknown. A large quantity of inoculum and an exact method of evaluation are required for correct determination. The objective of this study was to identify the tan spot (race 1) resistance of various wheat genotypes. The varieties bred in Martonvásár, and other genotypes with known genetic background, were inoculated under greenhouse conditions with an isolate of tan spot. The AUDPC values were calculated from the values of lesion types at various dates. The genotypes tested were found to be 4 % resistant, 46 % moderately resistant, 38 % moderately resistant to moderately susceptible, 11 % moderately susceptible and 1 % susceptible. The varieties ‘Atlas 66’ and ‘M-3’, reported in the literature as resistance sources, had significantly smaller AUDPC values than the average. The values recorded for the Martonvásár varieties ‘Mv Mambó’, ‘Mv Mazurka’ and ‘Mv139-08’ did not differ significantly from those obtained for these varieties. There was a moderate correlation between the greenhouse and field data. The greenhouse test currently employed thus appears to be suitable for the relatively simple, reproducible determination of resistance in wheat. Keywords: biotic stress factor, tan spot, wheat, resistance Introduction The pathogen causing tan spot, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs. (anamorph: Drechslera tritici-repentis), was first mentioned as a biotic stress factor of wheat in Hungary in 1988 (Apponyiné et al. 1988), after which several other authors drew attention to the danger (Balogh et al. 1991, Rátainé and Pecze 1997). Since this first attack it has been regularly isolated from cereal stands, to different extents each year. Control is complicated by the fact that the symptoms caused by the pathogen are extremely variable, and distinguishing them on the leaves is not as simple as in the case of biotrophic pathogens (Csısz 2007). Yield losses may be as high as 25% (Csısz 2006), which can be attributed to reductions in the grain number per spike and in the thousand-kernel weight (Shaber and Bockus 1988). The AUDPC value of the flagleaf is a good indicator of the wheat seed infection (Schilder and Bergstrom 1994, Bathal et al. 2003). It has been suggested that the pathogen may also be spread by the seed (Carmona et al. 2006). Based on the two types of symptoms (necrosis, extensive chlorosis), Pyrenophora tritici-repentis isolates are separated into several races (Lamari et al. 2003) in Europe as well (Sárová et al 2005). An increasing body of information is available on the resistance of Hungarian varieties, based on natural infection and artificial inoculation in the seedling and adult stages (Bakonyi et al. 1992, Csısz et al. 2006, Cséplı et al. 2004, Ágoston and Pepó 2005, Németh et al. 2006, Janda et al. 2008).The aim of the present experiments was to determine the resistance of various wheat genotypes in seedling stage after artificial inoculation with Drechslera triticirepentis (race 1).</p><p id="Pg171">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 174 Materials and methods The experiments were set up in the greenhouses of the Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, first on 49 varieties, breeding lines and genotypes with known genetic background, and then on a further 43 breeding lines bred in Martonvásár. The genotypes were inoculated with an isolate of tan spot developed on V8PDA medium (Lamari and Bernier 1991) (Pti2, race 1) (Ali and Francl 2001). The number of conidia required for inoculation (5000 conidia/ml) was adjusted under a light microscope by means of Bürker chamber counts. The inoculum was sprayed onto the leaf surface when the plants were in the 1-leaf stage. In order to promote infection, the plants were covered with polythene for 48 hours, after which the 80–90% relative humidity required for pathogen development was ensured using a humidifier (Cséplı et al. 2004). The genotypes were evaluated from the 5th day after inoculation, scoring the lesion types on a 1–5 scale (1 = resistance, 5 = susceptible) (Lamari and Bernier 1989). The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated from the lesion type values recorded at various dates (Shaner and Finney 1977). Data analysis was carried out with the Breeder statistical program package (Kuti et al. 2008). Results and discussion Analysis of variance on the greenhouse results revealed significant differences in susceptibility between the varieties in all four experiments (Fig. 1). The AUDPC values were significantly greater than average for the varieties Katepwa, ND495 and Glenlea, reported in the literature to be susceptible to race 1 of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, while the lowest value was found for the resistant genotype ‘M-3’ (Ali and Francl 2001). ‘Kavkaz’ and the Martonvásár varieties ‘Mv Mambó’, ‘Mv Mazurka’, ‘Mv Menüett’, ‘Mv Magdaléna’ and ‘Mv Karizma’ had significantly smaller AUDPC values than the experimental mean, and these did not differ significantly from that of ‘Atlas 66’, noted as a source of resistance (Rees and Platz 1990). 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 45,00 K A T E P W A N D 495 B E Z O S T A JA -1 M V -M A K A R O N I G K -K A LA S Z G LE N LE A W A T T IN E S A LC E D O G K -P E T U R M V -P A LO T A S M V -C S A R D A S F R O N T A N A M V -T O B O R Z O B A N K U T I-1201 M V -K O D M O N M V -S U V E G E S M V -M A G V A S M V -LA U R A F A T IM A -2 M V -V E R B U N K O S M V -B E R E S G K -G A R A B O LY M V -P A LM A M V -K O LO M V -K O LO M P O S M V -T O LD I M V -S U B A D IS P O N E N T S A LA M O U N I M V -W A LZ E R G K -C S ILLA G M V -R E G IM E N T M V -M A R S A LL G K -A T I M V -H O M B A R M V -B O D R I M V -T A M A R A M V -P E T R E N C E M V -LU C IA M V -V E K N I M V -K A R IZ M A M V -M A G D A LE N A K A V K A Z M V -M E N U E T T M V -M A Z U R K A M V -M A M B O A T LA S -66 M -3 Wheat genotypes A U D P C v al u e LSD5%=6,10 Figure 1.

The data show that in the first two experiments (Fig. 2.a.) 4% of the varieties, advanced lines and genotypes with known genetic background could be placed in the 0–10 (resistant) AUDPC group, 46% in the 11–20 (moderately resistant) group, 38% in the 21–30 (moderately resistant to moderately susceptible) group, 11% in the 31–40 (moderately susceptible) group and 1% in the 41–50 (susceptible) group.

The results indicated that four Martonvásár breeding lines (’Mv14’, ’Mv19’, ’Mv20’, ’Mv22’) had significantly lower AUDPC values than the average and did not differ in resistance from the resistant genotype ’M-3’. Conclusions Under greenhouse conditions it was found that several varieties and advanced lines bred in Martonvásár had reliable resistance to race 1 of tan spot. Correlation analysis revealed that the greenhouse data (AUDPC values calculated on the basis of lesion type and severity %) exhibited a significantly positive moderate correlation (r = 0.4 –0.6) with the field data (AUDPC values calculated from the lesion type and severity % on the flagleaf). Similar results were reported by Evans et al. (1999). The more extensive analysis of breeding lines could contribute to further improvements in the complex disease resistance of future Martonvásár wheat varieties and to an increase in selection efficiency.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: imajic@pfos.hr Abstract: European corn borer (ECB) tunnel and feed within vascular tissues of maize whereas disrupt water and nutrient transport within plants. Occurred injuries predispose plant to stalk breakage and ear droppage, and may result in serious maize yield losses. The aim of this work is to evaluate susceptibility of maize hybrids to ECB. Two years of field studies were conducted among seven maize hybrids at Croatian site. Susceptibility to ECB was assessed by measuring tunnel length and number of ECB larva in dissected maize stalks. Grain yield was measured and calculated to 14% moisture level. Intensity of ECB attack in both years was 100%. Means for tunnel length were significantly higher in 2008 then in 2007. The extent of tunneling injury ranged between hybrids from 13.70 to 29.20 cm in 2007, and from 40.84 to 64.42 cm in 2008. Significant differences for tunnel length and number of larva among hybrids were found in both years. One larva in average was found in each dissected stalk, whereas mean number ranged from 0.96 and 2.16 in 2007, and from 1.28 to 2.03 larva in 2008, respectively. A significant positive correlation between tunnel length and number of larva has been observed for all hybrids in both years with exception of one hybrid in 2008 year. Our results indicate substantial variability among hybrids, and hybrid OsSK 602 showed tolerant characteristics. However, all investigated hybrids potentially may encounter detrimental effects of ECB attack. Keywords: European corn borer, maize hybrids, susceptibility Introduction European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner) is one of the most important pests attacking maize (Zea mays L.) in Europe. The main damage to maize is caused by larvae which tunnel into the stalk, or bore into the ear shank resulting in grain yield losses. Heavily tunneled stalks suffer from ear droppage, stalk breakage and lodging reducing the possibility for proper machine harvest. Larval feeding within the plants cause vascular disruption injury and produces physiological stress in plants that predisposes the plants to secondary infections by other pathogens such as stalk rot (Peterson and Higley, 2000). According to Malvar et al., (2007), corn borer attack is the main biotic stressor for the maize crop although maize is very sensitive as well to other agroecological and agrotechnical conditions (Pepó et al., 2008). Research on early maturing European commercial hybrids against ECB reports 6.1% grain yield loss for each ECB larva per plant (Bohn et al., 1999). Similar results are reported from USA by Bode and Calvin (1990). Studies from Spain characterized several maize landraces from southern Europe as more tolerant to ECB attack (Malvar et al., 2007). In Croatia, the ECB occur univoltine or bivoltine (Raspudic et al., 1998). In 1990’s, in eastern Croatia which is considered as a main maize growing area of the country (Jambrović et al., 2008), the extent of infested maize stalks by ECB increased significantly, exceeding 50% intensity of attack while control measures have never been implemented (Ivezić and Raspudić, 2001). Maize production in Croatia is under constant threat of several other major pests (Ivezić et al., 2007; Jug et al., 2008). Raspudić et al. (1998) performed research on resistance of maize hybrids against ECB by evaluation of several agronomic traits associated with tolerance. Several Croatian hybrids (OsSK 382, OsSK 664 and OsSK 462) proved to be more tolerant but farmers</p><p id="Pg175">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 178 gradually substituted these hybrids with newly developed high yielding maize hybrids which are often cultivated in monoculture. Pest management measures such as chemical or biological control are requiring precisely timing and application, and therefore the cultivation of resistant genotypes would be the most effective tool for controlling ECB considering both ecological and economical aspects (Melchinger et al., 1998). This paper reports a screening of a seven commercial maize hybrids for susceptibility to ECB. The aim of our study was to compare commercial maize hybrids using tunnel length as a tolerance trait, number of larva per plant and their relationship and by measuring grain yield. Materials and methods Croatian maize hybrids representing FAO 400 – 700 maturity groups were evaluated in 2007 and 2008 for susceptibility to ECB. Each year seven commercial maize hybrids: OsSK 444, OsSK 499, OsSK 552, OsSK 596, OsSK 602, OsSK 617, OsSK 713 (Agricultural Institute Osijek) were in planted in plots with two replications in the fields characterized by high natural occurrence of ECB. Trials were planted in Osijek, Croatia (45º32″N, 18º44″E). Plots were planted in density of approximately 57 000 plants ha -1 . For each hybrid, the percentage of grain moisture was recorded and yield at 140 g kg -1 moisture content was calculated. Damage was evaluated in September, prior to the harvest. Maize stalks of 25 plants of each hybrid in each replication (total of 50 plants) were dissected and tunnel length (cm) was measured. Number of larva occurring in stalks was recorded and intensity of attack was determined. A combined analysis of variance across years was performed with PROC GLM procedure of SAS software (2000). Mean comparisons were made by least significant difference (LSD). Results and discussion Mean for tunnel length showed high level of variance within the investigated hybrids (Table 1.). Although number of larva detected in plants across years was similar, length of tunneling in 2008 was longer for 22 cm in average for all hybrids compared to 2007. Intensity of attack of ECB reached 100% for each hybrid in each year. Table 1. Basic statistics for tunnel length and number of larva per plant Mean Std Dev CV Min Max Variable 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 Tunnel length (cm) 23.82 45.78 15.83 29.65 66.48 67.79 0 3 94 143 Number of larva 1.59 1.72 1.44 2.60 90.86 21.20 0 0 9 7 Differences were significant for tunnel length and number of larva for all hybrids across years (Table 2.). Hybrid OsSK 444 significantly differed among hybrids in 2007 since it had the least damaged stalk with tunnel length in average of 13.7 cm, and lowest number of larva in 2008. All hybrids, except OsSK 444 and OsSK 552 produced higher</p><p id="Pg176">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 179 yields in 2008 although damage by ECB measured by tunnel length was significantly higher in the same year. The most productive hybrids were OsSK 713 and OsSK 602 in 2008. Hybrid OsSK 713 had shortest tunnel length in 2008 and second highest grain yield. However, in 2007 level of tunneling for the same hybrid was significantly higher in relation to four hybrids but again it had satisfactory grain yield. The least effect by ECB occurred for hybrid 602 since this hybrid was significantly different in 2008 compared to all other hybrids when it suffered the greatest damage and scored the highest grain yield. Same hybrid was the highest yielding hybrid across the years as well. Table 2.

Since stalk lodging resistance is an important aspect of achieving economically justified yields, agronomic traits like tunnel length and yield loss per cm tunnel length are used for evaluation of tolerance (Melchinger et al., 1998). Number of larva per plant solely can not be taken as an indicator of severity of ECB damage in terms of tunnel length since level of tunneling was significantly different between the years while number of larva was at similar size. In general, all hybrids proved to be susceptible to ECB however high yields were achieved in both years. Grain yields were not subjected to statistical analyses since reduction in grain yield is not solely due to direct impact of ECB but also influenced by secondary infestations of other pathogens (Jarvis et al.,</p><p id="Pg177">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 180 1984). Melchinger et al. (1998) suggested higher level of resistance in late maturing groups and our results proved late maturing hybrid OsSK 602 to be able to produce high yields with severely damaged stalk. Conclusions Damage caused by ECB is of major concern for Croatian farmers since maize has been often cultivated in monoculture and traditionally it has been considered as one of the most important cereal. All hybrids proved to be susceptible to ECB but also able to produce high yields under ECB attack. Most of the hybrids had higher grain yields in 2008 although stalks were more damaged compared to 2007 indicating that genotype and environment were the main factors influencing grain yield. Nevertheless, in 2008, one hybrid OsSK 602 showed tolerant characteristics by scoring highest yield with the most damaged stalk. The effect of ECB on reduction of grain yield can be associated in two hybrids (OsSK 444 and OsSK 552) since the grain yield decreased in 2008 while the tunnel length was longer. The ECB is common pest in Croatia and continuous threat to production of high yields so more screening studies against ECB including more commercial hybrids will be necessary in order to make recommendations to farmers.

A. Hlinku 2, 94901 Nitra, Slovakia, e-mail: Stefan.Tyr@uniag.sk Abstract: Weed surveys were conducted on farms being under conversion to ecological farming system between 2005-2007. The aim was to detect the most harmful weeds, as important biotic, environmental stress factor, on the farms in the canopies of winter cereals, spring barley, maize for grain and silage and pea for grain in all production region of the Slovak Republic. The actual weed infestation was evaluated by standard methods common used by EWRS a numerous method per square. In the winter cereals 19 weed species were determined, the most problematic were: annual winter weeds (Tripleurospermum perforatum, Capsella bursa pastoris, Thlaspi arvense, Lamium purpureum), annual spring weed (Persicaria spp.) and perennial weed (Elytrigia repens). In the spring barley 19 weed species were determined, the most problematic were: annual winter weeds (Tripleurospermum perforatum, Galium aparine), annual early spring weed (Avena fatua) and perennial weeds (Elytrigia repens and Cirsium arvense). Keywords: weed infestation, conversion, ecological farming system, biotic stress Introduction Development of environmentally and economically sound agricultural production systems of cereals is an important aim in agricultural research (Hoffmann et al., 2007; Hornok et al., 2007; Kovacevic et al., 2006; Lalic et al., 2007; Takács-György 2007). The development of integrated weed management strategies requires knowledge of the mechanism that influences the compositional changes in weed flora (Shresta et al., 2002). Competition by weeds is more important in ecological systems than in conventional systems, where weeds can be controlled by herbicides. Diversifying rotation patterns to include both spring and winter crops has helped producers to control weeds (Blackshaw et al., 1994; Buzsáki, Béres, 2007). Materials and methods In 2005-2007 weed survey on the farms in conversion to ecological agriculture was conducted in the west and central part of the Slovak Republic. Actual weed infestation of winter cereals and spring barley was evaluated at nine ecological farms in conversion, situated in all production area of the Slovak Republic. Time of sampling was spring, before mechanical regulation of weeds. Pre-crops of winter wheat were legumes and oil crops; pre-crop of spring barley was maize for silage. For evaluation, modified international scale EWRS (Anonymous, 1988) was used. Weed infestation of each field was determined at monitoring 1 m 2 area. Number of replicates for each field was determined according to EWRS (Anonymous, 1988). Randomly distributed quadrants were situated min. 20 m from field margin and apart of each other. Total area of evaluated winter cereals fields was 2 452 ha and of spring barley 608 ha. The weeds were arranged to the following groups: 'T' means Therophyta (annual) - T1: Sprouting in autumn, overwinters and develop its vegetative parts in early spring (e.g. Stellaria media) - T2: These weeds sprouts in autumn (mainly) or sometimes in springtime (e.g. Avena sterilis) - T3: Sprouting in spring and develop its seed in early summer (e.g. Cyperus spp) - T4: Sprouting in spring or early summer and</p><p id="Pg179">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 182 its lifecycle takes till the end of summer (e.g. Chenopodium album) 'G' means Geophyta (perennials, which overwinter in the soil) - G1: rhizome (e.g. Agropyron repens) Table 1. Modified EWRS evaluation scale of actual weed infestation. Actual weed infestation None Weak Low Medium High Infestation level 0 1 2 3 4 Group of weeds Number of weeds per m2 Very dangerous - ≤ 2 3-5 6-15 ≥ 16 Less dangerous - ≤ 4 5-8 9-20 ≥ 21 Less important - ≤ 8 9-15 16-30 ≥ 31 Results and discussion Weeds cause the major problem in conversion to ecological system. Beside nutrients, weed management is regarded as the main technical and system problems, which affect the yields and economic viability (Lacko-Bartošová, Macenková, 2006). During 2005 – 2007, weed survey was conducted on 2 452 ha of winter cereals fields and 608 ha of spring barley fields in conversion to ecological farming. In the winter cereals fields there were determined 19 weed species, three from the group G1 (perennials), the most species from the T2 group. Three weed species of these two groups belong to the very dangerous, namely: Tripleurospermum perforatum, Galium aparine and Elytrigia repens. These species, even ender low weed numbers per m2, may lower the yields of crops at about 1-2 t per ha. The highest weed infestation was determined for Capsella bursa-pastoris, Thlaspi arvense and Persicaria spp., over 28% of field area reached infestation level 4, with more than 31 weed plants per m 2 . These 3 weed species are less important and with mechanical weed measures can be suppressed in ecological farming. In the winter wheat fields, 6 species were determined from T4, T3, T1 groups. To the most important from mentioned groups belongs Avena fatua, annual species with similar growth and development pattern as cereals. In our previous research (Týr, 2008; Týr, Lacko-Bartošová, 2007) in conventional system was determined lower weed diversity, at about 50% less weed species as compared with ecological. That weed infestation level before chemical treatment in conventional system was higher than in ecological. The most problematic weed species in conventional system were Avena fatua, Cirsium arvense, Convolvulus arvensis, Elytrigia repens, Persicaria spp., Thlaspi arvense, Capsela bursa pastoris, Tripluerospermum perforatum. In the spring barley fields also 19 weed species were found. More weed species belong to very dangerous like Tripleurospermum perforatum, Galium aparine, Elytrigia repens, Avena fatua; where high level of weed infestation was achieved. Avena fatua was the most problematic, as a biotic stress factor may reduce the yield of spring barley to 50 percent. Spring barley as a crop with short vegetative period is in ecological system more vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses and more sensitive to weed infestation. Therefore complex weed management approach should be applied. Also Macák et al. (2008a,b) reported significant increase in weed diversity in ecological system, when weed species occurred in a low incidence. Enhancement of weed diversity</p><p id="Pg180">VIII.

Cereal Research Communications 184 Conclusions Weed infestation can be regarded as important stress factor in conversion from conventional to ecological agriculture. In winter wheat and spring barley fields were determined 19 weed species. Very dangerous in winter cereals were Tripleurosprermum perforatum, Elytrigia repens and Galium aparine. In spring barley except of these three species, Avena fatua was the most important. Weed species diversity increased in ecological system, but the level of weed infestation was lower as compared with conventional system. Spring barley is more sensitive crop regarding the weed management in ecological system as winter cereals.

Hugues 8, Poreč, Croatia Abstract: Production costs, gross revenue and profitability of ten durum wheat cultivars was evaluated during two vegetation seasons in Poreč, Croatia at northwestern Mediterranean area. Gross revenues and profits depended upon grain yield and protein content. Highest average biannual profit was 287 EUR ha-1 for variety Iride, followed by varieties Claudio, Solex and Preco with profits 256 – 211 EUR ha-1. Lowest average profit had Simeto, 68 EUR ha-1. Varieties Iride, Simeto and Neodur gained higher profits in dry climate circumstances 2002., while varieties Claudio, Colosseo and Torrebianca gained higher profit in 2001. as a consequence of higher precipitation during vegetation. The study highlights, that varietal stress tolerance of crop plants may have an economic importance. Keywords: gross revenue, profit, protein, Triticum turgidum L. Var durum. Introduction Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. Var durum) is a high quality wheat, used mostly for semolina in pasta products. In scientific research, grain yield and quality are key quantitative traits reported (Balogh et al., 2007; Steward et al., 2002; Royo et al., 2006). Although some papers discuss on simultaneous effects of temperature and rainfall (Garcia del Moral et al., 2003; Royo et al., 2007), still yield is mostly concerned (Simmonds, 1995; Vita and Maggio A. 2007). Manufacturing and marketing of durum products is concentrated in the Mediterranean region. Since Croatia is situated in the Mediterranean and has favorable climate conditions this paper examines different durum varieties production. Our aim was to examine economic potential of durum wheat, focused to gross revenue and profits as reported in other Mediterranean countries (Drezner et al., 2006, Ferraresi, 2002, Ozberk et al. 2006; Royo et al., 2007). Materials and methods Field trials were carried out at Poreč in nortwest Croatian Mediterranean area during two vegetations (2000/2001. and 2001/2002.) on deep red clay soil with average 600 mm precipitation. Ten cultivars were examined: Neodur, Colosseo, Duilio, Simeto, Torrebianca, Claudio, Iride, Verdi, Solex and Preco. Technological procedures, manure and pesticide costs were equal in both years and for all varieties. Grain yield and protein concentration for each cultivar were analysed by NIT technology. Achieved yields were calculated to standard moisture value 13%. Cost-benefit method was used for economic analysis. Direct costs were determined by calculations. Marketing and management fees were 2% of variable costs while interest on operating capital was 5%. In gross revenue State subventions were added (225 EUR ha -1 ). Durum market prices in 2001. and 2002. were 150 EUR t -1 for less than 12.5% protein, 165 EUR t -1 for 12.5-13.5% protein, while for 13.5% protein it was marketed at 185 EUR t -1 (USDA, 2007).</p><p id="Pg183">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 186 Results and discussion Durum wheat yield in 2001. rated from 5.51 t ha -1 for Simeto to 7.07 t ha -1 for Solex, while in 2002. lower yields were evident, from 4.95 t ha -1 at Torrebianca to 6.43 t ha -1 for Iride (data not show). All cultivars achieved lower yields (in average 10%) in 2002. when precipitation was 345 mm (from October 2001.- May 2002.) respectively 228 mm less comparing to same period of season before (data not show). Higest sensitivity to reduced precipitation were noticed by Torrebianca that yielded 27% less in 2002. and Solex that yielded 25% less. Most homogenous yields were noticed by Coloseo and Verdi which yield varieted for only 1% in 2002, respectively for 2% less in 2001. (data not show). Highest biannual average grain yield had Iride (6.68 t ha -1 ) followed by Claudio and Verdi (6.32 respectively 6.25 t ha -1 )(Figure 1). Lowest average biannual yields were recorded for Simeto (5.42 t ha -1 ), Colosseo (5.54 t ha -1 ) and Neodur (5.73 t ha -1 ).

Lowest average protein content had Duilio (10.59%) and Verdi (10.88%). Protein values ranged similar to the variation reported by Fiez et al. (1994). Also as expected, there was a medium negative correlation between grain yield and protein concentration (r =−0,43, P=0,05). This relationship has been reported in the literature (Simmonds, 1995). All cultivars except of Duilio and Verdi had higher grain protein content in 2002. when lower precipitation was recorded. Highest deviations were evident for Simeto in 2002. which had protein content 174 g kg -1 , respectively 59 g kg -1 higher than in 2001. Mulla et al. (1992) and Fiez et al. (1994) also confirmed relationships of higher protein concentration and lower availability of water in soils. Both authors identified moisture stress-nitrogen</p><p id="Pg184">VIII.

Costs of other materials, human and mechanized labour were equal for all cultivars because of equal technology used. Highest average biannual profit was achieved by Iride (287 EUR ha -1 ) followed by Claudio (256 EUR ha -1 ). In 2001. profit losses were noticed for Simeto because of low protein content (11.5%) and in 2002. for Torrebianca because of low grain yield (4.95 t ha -1 ) (Table 1). Correlation analysis determined strong correlations of profits with grain yield (r=0.83, P=0.05) and weak correlation with protein content (r=0.11, P=0.05). Significant aberration of these values for different cultivars imply economic success in different climate environments. In this sense Iride, Simeto and Neodur gained significantly higher profits (147-161 EUR ha -1 ) in dry 2002. because of protein content, while Claudio, Colosseo and Torrebianca gained higher profit (111-206 EUR ha -1 ) in 2001. as a consequence of higher grain yield. Conclusions According to our field trials we determined highest average biannual profits for cultivar Iride of 287 EUR ha -1 , as a consequence of grain yield of 6.68 t ha -1 and average protein content at 12.9%. Next highest average biannual profit had Claudio, 256 EUR ha -1 with average grain yield 6.32 t ha -1 and grain protein content at 13.7%. Lowest profit at 68 EUR ha -1 had Simeto at average grain yield 5.42 t ha -1 and grain protein content 14.4%.</p><p id="Pg185">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 188 Correlations between profit and grain yield was strong while between profit and protein content was weak. Iride, Simeto and Neodur achieved better economic results in low precipitation environment (total 345 mm during vegetation), while Claudio, Colosseo and Torrebianca were economically successful in higher precipitation environments (total 572 mm during vegetation). Therefore we recommend cultivar Iride as best in accordance with economic terms and area suitability for examined Mediterranean area of Croatia.

VIRGIFERA LECONTE) Csaba L. MARTON 1 – Emese NAGY 1 – Dénes OROSS2 1 Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-2462 Martonvásár, Brunszvik 2., e-mail: martoncs@mail.mgki.hu 2 Mv Bázismag Kft., H-2462 Martonvásár-Erdıhát, Pf.: 1., e-mail: oross.denes@bazismag.hu Abstract: The appearance of corn rootworm is one of the greatest plant protection challenges that European maize production has faced in its 500-year history. Since the first specimens were caught in 1992, the pest is to be found on all the major maize-producing areas. In several regions the damage it causes has reached the threshold of economic loss, making it the most problematic of all the biotic and abiotic stress factors faced by maize growers. The aim of the research was to determine the level of corn rootworm tolerance in various maize genotypes and to use selection methods to breed maize hybrids whose tolerance level provided satisfactory protection against this biotic stress factor. The present paper describes studies on the tolerance level of 43 Martonvásár hybrids at three locations in two years and that of the parental lines at two locations in one year. Significant differences were found in the tolerance levels of the hybrids, and a close positive correlation was revealed between root-pull resistance and yield, while there was a close negative correlation between root lodging and yield and between root-pull resistance and lodging. Root regeneration is also an important factor, good values of which were found for three hybrids. Inbred lines had smaller root diameter and lower root pull resistance than hybrids. The heterosis on root diameter was 140 %, while in case of root pull resistance the heterosis is 123 %. Keywords: western corn rootworm, resistance breeding, tolerance level Introduction Maize production is one of the most important sectors of agriculture in Hungary. On the basis of profitability it has been one of the top-ranking field crops in recent years, and is grown on an area of around 1.1–1.2 hectares. Until recently, apart from a few pathogens (Šimić et al., 2007, Szıke et al., 2007) it has suffered little damage from pests, but this situation changed after the appearance of the corn rootworm in 1995. It is estimated that around 100,000 ha were affected on a third of which lodging has been recorded. No accurate data are available on the yield losses suffered in Hungary, but they probably amount to around 5% on a national scale. The yield losses caused by the pest may range from only a few per cent to as much as 70–80% (Sivcev and Tomasev, 2002, Széll et al., 2005). American data indicate that yield losses combined with the cost of control lead to a loss of income amounting to around a billion dollars a year (Krysan and Miller, 1986). In addition to agronomic, chemical and biotechnological control measures (Keszthelyi et al., 2007, Németh et al., 2008) work has been underway for several decades to breed maize varieties resistant to the pest (Owens et al., 1974, Ivezic et al., 2006, Pepó and Bódi 2006, Šimić et al., 2007, Tollefson, 2007, Szıke et al., 2008). Among the three basic mechanisms of host-plant resistance (non-preference, antibiosis, tolerance) defined by Painter (1951), conventional plant breeding can only be based on tolerance, where differences arise mainly as the result of diverse growth habits (stronger stalks, more robust root mass, better root regeneration). The present paper aimed to determine the corn rootworm tolerance levels of 43 maize hybrids and that of the parental lines.</p><p id="Pg187">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 190 Materials and methods In order to determine the level of tolerance against corn rootworm, 43 Martonvásár maize hybrids were sown in experiments at three locations with three replications in 2007 and 2008. All parental inbred lines of the 43 hybrids were also evaluated in 2008. The extents of natural rootworm infection in the previous year and the type of soil were taken into consideration when choosing the locations, which included heavily infested chernozem soils only. The two-rowed plots were 6 m in length with row and plant spacings of 0.7 m and 0.2 m, respectively. At each location the root-pull resistance was recorded on two occasions (end of June, middle of Sept.) on 5 plants per plot for each genotype, after which the visible root damage was scored using the Iowa scale (1: no damage, 6: loss of three or more root levels) and the root diameter was measured. The latter values were used to determine the extent of root regeneration (by subtracting the June values from the September values). After counting the number of lodged plants the yield was harvested from a 2 m section of each plot. The data were evaluated using analysis of variance and regression analysis. Results and discussion Different levels of root damage were recorded for the tested hybrids at the three locations and in the two years. The infestation was most severe in Kıszárhegy in 2007, followed by Lászlópuszta, with the least damage in Martonvásár. A higher level of infestation was expected based on the corn rootworm damage in the previous year. The infestation was most severe in Martonvásár in 2008, followed by Lászlópuszta, with the least damage in Martonvásár. Differences in the degree of infestation were also observed between the two scoring dates for root damage in 2007. At the second scoring date there was a substantial reduction in damage compared with the first scoring date in Kıszárhegy, mainly due to root regeneration (Figure 1), which could be attributed partly to timely rainfall and partly to genetic differences in regeneration between the hybrids. There was no significant differences between the two sampling date in 2008. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1st sampling date 2nd sampling date 1st sampling date 2nd sampling date 2007 2008 (I o w a sc al e) Kıszárhegy Lászlópuszta Martonvásár Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 191 The 43 genotypes tested had different levels of tolerance of the pest, as shown by the considerable differences in root-pull resistance (72–126 kp) and in the values on the Iowa scale (1.2–2.4) (Figure 2). Hybrids with greater root-pull resistance values exhibited significantly less root damage than those with weaker resistance. In 2008, the resistance levels of both the hybrids and their parent lines were investigated in all three locations.

The selection method used in the experiments, based on root-pull resistance measurements combined with the counting of lodged plants and the scoring of root damage on the Iowa scale, proved to be suitable for the relatively rapid testing of the tolerance of large numbers of maize genotypes. Inbred lines had smaller root diameter and lower root pull resistance than hybrids. The heterosis on root diameter was 140 %, while in case of root pull resistance the heterosis is 123 %. However, significant variation can be observed in the root pull resistance of inbred lines. The root pull resistance was 37 kp for the inbred lines with the weakest resistance, and 129 kp for the strongest ones. The low level of heterosis and the wide range of variation enable efficient selection during inbreeding.

The two factors of the experiment are: -rate of fertilizers (0–300–600–900 N:P2O5:K2O (1:1:1) kg ha -1 year-1) and the -timing of N fertilizer application (spring, autumn, spring shared two times) The 300 kgha-1 level of nutrition increased the yield of the maize significantly, but with the further rise in fertilizer rates resulted in much smaller yield increase. At the overdosed 900 kgha-1 level there was no significant additional yield compared to the 600 kgha-1 level. Between the effects of the variants of N applications no significant differences were observed. The relative deviation of the yield data decreased with the rise in fertilizer rates, while the differences between the minimum and maximum absolute yield values (t ha-1) increased. Keywords: mineral fertilization, continuous maize cropping, crop year effect, yield stability Introduction The issue of crop rotation and continuous cropping have been studied for a long time. Several similar and contrasting opinions and results have been published about their advantages and disadvantages and time by time new aspects increase the importance of this subject. On the one hand Gyırffy (1975/a) concluded that - after introduction of mineral fertilization - crop rotation is not important any more from the point of view of plant nutrition. On the other hand Gyırffy (1975/b) and Gyırffy and Berzsenyi (1992) published that grain yield of both maize and wheat was lower in continuous cropping than in crop rotation in their experiment, because of plant diseases in case of wheat and because of water managent problems and herbicide resistant weeds in case of maize. The stability of yield is also important. Several authors published that maize yield responded sensitively to the effect of crop year and the yield of maize was more stable in crop rotation than in continuous cropping (Pepó et al. 2008, Nagy 1995) especially in dry periods (Gyırffy 1975/b, Ruzsányi 1992). Optimal fertilization can also increase yield stability, but the optimum level depens on the crop year (Pepó and Balogh 2008, Tanács et al. 2008). Kádár and Márton (2007) reported that in extreme dry crop year fertilization reduced the grain yield of maize in a monoculture experiment. Plant nutrition especially macronutrient application is a basic factor of agronomy influencing either crop quantity or quality (Izsáki 2007, Izsáki 2008, Németh and Izsáki 2007, Kismányoky and Lehoczky 2007) as well as soil fertility and resilience (Várallyay 2007). Materials and methods The study was conducted in a long-term continuous maize cropping field experiment set up by the Department of Plant Production of the Georgikon Faculty of the University of Pannonia, in Keszthely, Hungary in 1969.</p><p id="Pg191">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 194 The soil was a Ramann-type brown forest soil (Eutric Cambisol) containing 41 % sand, 32 % silt, and 27 % clay. The available phosphorus content of this sandy loam soil was low (AL- P2O5: 60-80 mg kg -1 ), the potassium content medium (AL-K2O: 140-160 mgkg -1 ) and the humus content fairly low (1.6-1.7%), with a pHKCl value of 7,3. The 100 year average annual precipitation was 683 mm, but the distribution was often unequal. The long-term annual mean temperature was 10.8 o C. In the monoculture maize experiment the effect of increasing rates of mineral fertilization on the grain yield was studied in the periode of 1969-2008 including different crop years. Four rates of mineral fertilizer application were studied: control (0 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha -1 yr -1 ), 300, 600 and 900 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha -1 yr -1 (N:P2O5:K2O = 1:1:1). This treatments are refered in the text as NPK 0, NPK 300, NPK 600 and NPK 900. Beside the fertilizer rates the effect of three different variants of timing of N application was also studied: once in autumn (Autumn 1), once in spring (Spring 1), twice in spring (Spring 2, 1/3 N was applied as a top dressing). The applied fertilizers were: nitrochalk (27 % N), superphosphate (18 % P2O5) and KCl (60 % K2O). Analysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance of the treatments. Results and discussion The differennt crop years influenced the grain yield of maize significantly (Figure 1.). The deviation of yield data was higher on the fertilized plots year by year compared to the control plots, since on the fertilized plots not the nutrition was the minimum yield factor (Figure 2.). The differences between the minimum and maximum absolute yield values (t ha -1 ) increased with fertilizer application, while the relative deviation of the yield data decreased (NPK 0: 40 %, NPK 300: 29 %, NPK 600: 32 %, NPK 900: 31 %). Comparing the long term yield and precipitation data it can be concluded that correlation between them is not always strong, so the amount of precipitation itself is not able to express the effect of crop year on the yield. Rainfall conditions presumably correlates with the weed infestation and with the effectiveness of the applied method of weed control, which can be a serious yield limiting factor in maize. The effect of rainfall conditions therefore can be different in correlation with the other agrotechnological factors. The mineral fertilizer application increased the yield of maize significantly when averaged over 38 year data (Table 1. and Figure 2.) The 300 kg NPK ha -1 mineral fertilizer rate application resulted in the highest yield increase (3,72 t/ha). The further rise in the fertilizer rates did not resulted in such a great extent, but the NPK 600 treatment had still significant yield increasing effect. From the variants of the N application (once in spring, once in autumn, twice in spring) when N was applied in split dosages in the spring, the yield of maize was slightly higher than in case of autumn 1 and spring 1 applications, but the effect of N application was no significant when averaged over the 38 year data.</p><p id="Pg192">VIII.

Svetlana ŠLIKOVÁ – Valéria ŠUDYOVÁ – Edita GREGOVÁ – Daniel MIHÁLIK Department of Applied Genetics, Slovak Agricultural Research Centre, Research Institute of Plant Production, Bratislavská cesta 122, 921 68 Piešťany, Slovak Republic, e-mail:slikova@vurv.sk Abstract: Oat has been more often used in human nourishment in recent years for any rational diet. Grains contaminated with Fusarium spp. are unsuitable for both human and animal consumption because of the adverse health effects of fusariotoxins. The aim of this work was to examine the reactions of covered oats to artificial infection with Fusarium culmorum (W. G. Smith) Sacc. and the accumulation of deoxynivalenol mycotoxin in seeds. Covered cultivars registered in Slovakia (Zvolen, Auron, Atego, Flämingsstern, Kanton, Viktor, Zlaťák, Euro and Ardo) were inoculated during flowering in 2006 and 2007 with conidial suspensions of aggressive isolate of F. culmorum Sacc. After ripening, twenty panicles were harvested manually from each plot of blocks (block 1. inoculated, block 2. uninoculated). The threshed seeds were then manually cleaned and hulled. The reduction in 1000-kernel weight (R-TKW) was calculated. The kernel samples were also analysed for deoxynivalenol (DON) content by a commercial ELISA kit for quantitative analysis of DON in cereals. The differences between the oat cultivars were observed in R-TKW and DON contents. A high RTKW was discovered in Flämingsstern and a low reduction in Euro, Ardo and Zlaťák. The average range of DON accumulation was from 3.45 mg kg-1 to 19.05 mg kg-1. From the oat cultivars a mean high DON accumulation (in 2006 and 2007 years) was found in Kanton and Ardo cultivars, a low one in seeds of Zlaťák, Euro and Auron. This is the first piece of information on reduction in 1000-kernel weight and concentrations of DON in covered oat cultivars in Slovakia after artificial infection with Fusarium culmorum. Keywords: covered oat cultivars, yield component, deoxynivalenol Introduction Several Fusarium species are widespread pathogens on small-grain cereals (soft and durum wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale) around the world, including all European cereal-growing areas. In the Slovak Republic (SR), the data about the occurrence of genus Fusarium on oat is not known as soon as in wheat there are the most common F. culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc. and F. graminearum Schwabe (Šrobárová, 2008). Fusarium head blight (FHB) of oat is caused by a complex Fusarium species, the composition and proportions of which varied considerably among years and regions (Tekauz, 2008). The head infection of cereals with fungi of the Fusarium spp. group may cause a decrease in quality and yield and contaminating cereal products with mycotoxins. The analysis of one hundred and fifty-six samples of breakfast cereals (included corn-, oat-, wheat- and rice-based cereals, as well as mixed-grain cereals) from the Canadian retail marketplace has shown that deoxynivalenol was the most frequently detected mycotoxin - it was detected in over 40% of all samples analysed (Roscoe, 2008). In the Slovak Republic, the limit specified by the EU (1.25 mg.kg -1 DON content) was exceeded in 9.3 % of the wheat samples collected in the maize growing area, 5 % in the sugar beet growing area and 14.3 % in the potato growing area between 2004 and 2006 (Šliková, 2008). Oat breeders are searching for information about the reaction of oat genotypes to Fusarium infection. There is information known about the resistant to fusariosis of oats and cumulation of Fusarium toxins in seeds (Tekauz, 2008; Bjørnstad, 2008, Perkowski, 2008), but little information is known about yield reduction. This paper presents the results obtained from the evaluation of reduction in 1000-kernel weight and DON accumulation in covered oat cultivars after artificial inoculation with</p><p id="Pg195">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 198 F. culmorum. The reaction of wheat and barley cultivars to artificial infection by Fusarium spp. and the cumulation of DON in seeds of cultivars registered in Slovakia was reported (Vančo, 2007), but there was an absence of information about covered oats to fusarioses and cumulation of toxins. Materials and methods In the spring of 2006 and 2007, plot experiments with two blocks (inoculated (I) and non-inoculated (N)) and registered cultivars of covered ones (Zvolen, Auron, Atego, Flämingsstern, Kanton, Viktor, Zlaťák, Euro and Ardo) were established under natural conditions at Piešťany. The region of Piešťany belongs to produced type maize – wheat, with an elevation above sea level of 160 m. The weather conditions for Piešťany are shown in Table 1. There were five rows per plot, with 1-m length and 150-mm row spacing. At anthesis, 20 panicles from each cultivar were sprayed (block 1) with of F. culmorum. The isolate F. culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc. (RA/02) from the location Radošina (SR) was obtained from a microorganism collection at the Research Institute of Plant Production, Piešťany and used for artificial inoculation of oat panicles. After inoculation, the panicles were covered with plastic bags for 24 h. After ripening, the panicles were harvested by hand from each cultivar and from each plot. The threshed grains were manually cleaned and separated from the hulls. The reduction in 1000-kernel weight (R-TKW) was calculated in comparison with the noninoculated block as shown in general form: R = 100 – (100 × I/N). The percentage RTKW (in arcsine) was statistically evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS software. A commercial ELISA kit for quantitative analysis of DON in cereals was used to determine the DON concentration in oat samples (Ridascreen® Fast DON, RBiopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany). The absorbencies (of the wells) were determined photometrically at 450 nm (MRX II, DYNEX Technologies). DON concentrations were calculated in mg kg –1 by Revelation Version 4.25. Results and discussion The oat is characterized by ambiguous symptomatic manifestations after panicle infection with Fusarium spp. Evaluation of oat reaction to artificial infection by F. culmorum was aimed at the analysis of kernel obtained from infected and control panicles. The seeds from infected panicles by F. culmorum were separated from the hulls and looked to be smaller than normal, they were dwarf, wrinkly, and less developed. Typical, Fusarium damaged kernels, as in wheat, were not observed in seeds from infected panicles. ANOVA of R-TKW confirmed statistically significant differences between the years and cultivars (Tab. 1). The inoculation of panicles with fungi Fusarium culmorum reduced 1000-kernel weight, on average, by 28.9 %. The average R-TKW in oat cultivars was higher by 32.1% in 2007 than in 2006. This was probably due to precipitations, because in June 2006 (IInd decade), during the artificial inoculation of panicle the weather was dry (0.0 mm, 0 days with rainfall) but in June 2007 (Ist decade), precipitations appeared during artificial inoculation (17.0 mm, 4 days with</p><p id="Pg196">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 199 rainfall). Precipitations could probably create more favourable conditions for a more intensive start of infection in 2007 and resulted in TKW reduction of seeds. Interaction year x cultivar (Tab. 1) was statistically highly significant. The cultivars Auron and Viktor had different reaction to F. culmorum in both years. Statistically significant differences in R-TKW in oat genotypes after artificial infection with Fusarium avenaceum in years x cultivars interaction was presented by Kiecana (2002) . He mentioned different reactions of some of the genotypes to infection in the years and indicated that the weather affected the reduction of yield parameters of the tested oat genotypes every year. The factors which influence the reduction of yield parameters in oat after artificial infection with Fusarium spp. are less investigated than in other cereals, e.g. wheat (Goliński, 2002). Table 1.

The low RTKW values were foud in Euro, Ardo and high Flämingsstern in both years. The total mean of DON content in the tested oats was 2.5 times higher in 2006 than in 2007. The average range of DON accumulation was from 3.45 mg kg -1 to 19.05 mg kg -1 . In 2006 the DON content was ranged from 2.10 mg kg -1 to 28.91 mg kg -1 and in 2007 from 2.30 mg kg -1 to 9.20 mg kg -1 . A mean high DON accumulation (2006 and 2007 years) from the oat cultivars was found in Kanton (19.05 mg kg -1 ) and Ardo (17.90 mg kg -1 ) cultivars, a low one in seeds of Zlaťák (3.45 mg kg -1 ), Euro (4.15 mg kg -1 ) and Auron (4.30 mg kg -1 ). The Zlaťák and Euro with low DON accumulation had low R-TKW, too. The Fig.1 shows that the DON content in seeds of individual cultivars does not correspond with R-TKW. The hulls of covered oat grains have an important role in the protection grains against Fusarium infection.

When this happens, plant production stops, it uses up the nutrients assimilated during normal CO2 content. On the other hand in high CO2 level different symptoms can occur such as leaf roll and carbohydrate transport problems. Optimizing CO2 level is necessary for effective horticultural production. Different influences such as higher yield, earliness, and higher heat tolerance were observed with CO2 enrichment. Depends on the source, SO2 and NOx are present in the atmosphere which also can impair the plants and the environment. A partly new source of CO2 is becoming more and more available which doesn’t have this contamination. Fermenting ethanol, from cereals for fuel, produces tons of waste CO2 which can make CO2 enrichment economic, in such cultivation circumstances, where this element was not profitable. Our aim was to examine the effect of CO2 enrichment in typical Hungarian conditions in tomato, grown in soil. The main representatives were the major commercial characteristics: the weight by classes, colour as the marker of maturity and the firmness which affects shelf life of the fruit Keywords: tomato, CO2 enrichment, firmness Introduction Nowadays when hard to forecast the weather vegetable growing turns more and more to the protected cultures. Indoor growing of species, consumed in the highest degree, is notable. This way the culture is protected from stress caused by the extreme weather but there are other influences, which are not present in open field, effects that blast the yield. In a greenhouse the chance of sunburn is much lower and low night-time temperature is not a threat, in the other hand, depends on the ventilation, daytime temperature can rise over optimal, and CO2 drops under assumable level. CO2 content of the air, as an ecological condition, have great effect on yield and fruit components of tomato (Végh et al., 2007). Atmospheric CO2 enrichment is one method for supplying carbon. The cost of the gas let this technique use only in the most intensive units. Fermenting ethanol from cereals produces tons of waste CO2, which can make profitable this element in other horticultural sections, where forcing is not heated and climate control is based only on ventilation and shading, where environment highly affects the yield. Atmospheric CO2 enrichment raises the yield (van Berkel, N., 1984) and has other positive impacts such as enhanced drought stress tolerance (Veisz, 2008), earlier yield and higher nutrient uptake (Juan et al., 2007), but overdose of it stresses the plants causing leaf roll (Tripp et al., 1991), associated with high starch accumulation (Madsen, 1974) and drop in photosynthetic activity.</p><p id="Pg199">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Our aim was to examine the effect of atmospheric CO2 enrichment in short term cultures on varieties Celsus F1, Platus F1 and Vulkanus F1. The tomatoes were planted in twin rows with 1,2 m between thin rows the spacing inside the rows was 0,4 m and 0,3 m between the plants. The house was a 7 meters wide 4 meters high and 33 m long tunnel type polyethylene covered tent. We enriched the CO2 level 6 hours daily. Gas supply was bottled gas, managed by a Fuji Electric’s (ZFP9) infra red CO2 controller on the level of 850 ppm. Fertigation was managed manually. During picking the main commercial values were measured, the yield, the colour, the Brix° measured by a refractometer and firmness measured by an electric penetrometer.

Most of these cultivars are more resistant for abiotic stress factors, specially they have higher drought tolerance. Our aim was to find an isoenzyme marker, what is characteristic for most of the traditional Hungarian grapevine cultivars, to help our breeding work as well. First 20 grapevine cultivars were investigated by isoenzyme analyses. We used a 3-parted vertical poliacrylamide gel system for the separation of the soluble isoenzymes of acid phosphatase (AcP), peroxidase (PER), glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase (GOT) and cathecol-oxidase (CO). Comparing the banding patterns we noticed a special banding pattern of the acid phosphatase (AcP) of the woody stems (in the case of 4 cultivars) that we don’t find in the literature. In the investigation of leaf extracts, we find that these 4 cultivars have one additional band in their zymogram as well. It perhaps means, that this additional form of acid phosphatase in these cultivars is controlled by an additional locus. As all this 4 cultivars has pontican origin, we extended the range of cultivars to 60 to clarify if this phenotype appears only in the range of the pontican cultivars, or can be encountered in other groups of Vitis vinifera. On the basis of this result it can be established, that more than 2/3 of the cultivars, which morphologically belongs to the subconvarietas pontica gives this zymogram, as from the other groups (subconvar. occidentalis and orientalis) only one cultivar gave this phenotype. Keywords: isoenzyme, grape Vitis vinfera Introduction The range of grapevine cultivars traditionally grown in Hungary differs from those grown in western Europe, as they mostly belong to the pontican cultivars. The efficiency of the breeding of plant species is closely connected with the knowledge of the genetic background of the indicated species, particularly in the case of the grape, where the change of generations takes 3-5 years. Nowadays besides the morphological features molecular markers are also available to investigate the genetic background of various genotypes and to improve the efficiency of breeding work (Bretting et al., 1995). Of these, isoenzyme analysis provides significant advantage over the traditional methods for the identification and characterisation of grape cultivars. The use of these novel methods in taxonomical studies has got an emerging importance because, despite the vegetative propagation, the grape (Vitis spp.) has a quite high degree of genetic variability (Olmo, 1976). Molecular marcers for grape cultivar identification and their genetic characterisation have widely been used during the last 20-30 years (Crespan et al., 1999; Cseh et al, 2006.). In most cases starch gel electrophoresis was used to separate the isoenzymes. Recently poliacrylamide-gel electrophoresis has been preferred for such studies (Sánchez-Escribano et al. ,1998) and for isoelectric focusing as well (Paar et al., 1999, Stefanovits-Bányai et al., 2002). The acid phosphatase enzyme was reported to be quite polymorphic in higher plant, for example in weat (Dudinkov, 2007.) and in grapes as well (Royo et al., 1997; Vidal et al.,1998). We aimed at characterising grapevine cultivars by acid phosphatase</p><p id="Pg203">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 206 isoenzyme analyses. Materials and Methods The 60 grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars and intraspecific hybrids used for isoenzyme analyses are listed in Table 1. Plant materials (canes and young leaves) were collected from Hungarian plantations located in Badacsony, Pécs and Tarcal (Tokaj wine district) in January, May and July of years 2004 and 2005. For protein extraction 150 mg polyclar AT and 1 ml of 4oC extraction buffer (described by Arulsekar and Parfitt.,1986.) were added to about 300 mg of plant material (canes or young leaves) and was homogenized in a mortar and centrifugalized at 4°C and 1400 rpm for 5 minutes. After centrifugation we applied 50 µl of clear supernatant onto the polyacrylamide gel for the analyses. For further examination remaining extracts were stored at -75°C. Vertical poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used for the separation of the isoenzymes of acid phosphatase (AcP). We used the polyacrylamide gel system for the separation as described by Sànchez-Escribano et al. (1998). The electrophoresis for the extracts was carried out at 4 oC and 2 mA per well for 3-4 hours. After the electrophoresis the gels were stained for the detection of acid phosphatase (AcP) as described by Arulsekar and Parfitt (1986). The isoenzyme pattern obtained in the gel complex at a fix pH was evaluated visually. Results The acid phoshphatase patterns of 60 grapevine genotypes have been analysed. Expression of acid phosphatases does not show seasonal changes, and the isoenzyme patterns do not depend on the time of the sampling time, that is on dormancy. It can also be concluded, that adequate activity can be measured only in leaf samples taken before blooming. Figure 1. Acid phosphatase zymogram types. (Type 4, 5 and 6 are characteristic for the pontican cultivars) A special banding pattern of the acid phosphatase could be observed of the woody stems in the case of 22 cultivars (see Figure 1, and Table 1). This characteristic pattern has not been reported in the literature yet. These cultivars have four bands in the faster migrating region of the gel, while the others have only three bands (Figure 2). Analysis of leaf extracts of these cultivars resulted in one additional band in their zymogram as well. It may mean, that this additional form of acid phosphatase is controlled by an additional locus. 20 of these 22 cultivars are described by morphological features as</p><p id="Pg204">VIII.

The newly bred grapevine cultivar ‘Zéta’ originates from the cross Bouver (occidentalis) x Furmint (pontica) produces the special acid phosphatase isoenzyme band. The only one, which has this special pattern but does not belong to the pontican cultivars, and is not an intraspecific hybrid of a cultivar of pontican origin is the Cirfandli. Discussion Genetic differences of the convarietas of the grape (Vitis vinifera L) were indicated. Experiences have shown that ancient cultivars can be divided into three groups, viz. convars. pontica, occidentalis and orientalis, each of which reproduces its distinguishing features in its progeny (Negrul, 1968,). RFLP data of Bourquin et al. (1993) showed, that various cultivars of the same presumed geographical origin are related. Grando et al. (1995) analysed wild and cultivated grapes by RAPD markers. They noted that some vines ascribed to the occidentalis Negr. group were clearly separated from the other genotypes whereas the RAPD profiles of Vitis vinifera ssp. silvestris accessions are often very more similar or even identical to those of the cultivars ascribed to the proles pontica Negr. group. Most of the pontican cultivars are more resistant for abiotic stress factors, specially they have higher drought tolerance. Enzymes of phosphate metabolism can play important role in abiotic stress tolerance in higher plants. For example Kovács et al (2007) reported, that PFP plays important role in drought and cold tolerance of carrot plants. Based on our results it can be supposed, that the pontican convarietas of the species Vitis vinifera L. has a characteristic genetic basis, as the occurrence this additional acid phosphatase isoenzyme band likely relates to the eco-geographical group of these cultivars.</p><p id="Pg205">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, radiation) were the same in both PGV-36 chambers but the carbon dioxide concentration was either ambient (380 ppm) or doubled (750 ppm). The effect of elevated CO2 level and drought stress were examined in various phenological stages (first node appearance, heading and grain filling). The drought stress was continued for 3-7 days, during which period the soil water humidity decreased from 20-25 volumetric water content (VWC%) to 3-5 VWC%. Photosynthesis and antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase) were measured at various levels of water stress. Phenological and yield parameters were determined at the end of the vegetation period. Significant differences were found between the varieties and treatments in the antioxidant enzyme activity and a number of phenological parameters. Elevated CO2 concentration improved stress tolerance increasing biomass production and the grain number in both varieties. High CO2 concentration also reduced the negative effect of drought stress on yield parameters. Keywords: abiotic stress, climate change, elevated CO2 level, drought. Introduction The global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing continuously during the last two centuries and its value is 35 % higher nowadays than before the industrial revolution. The present average level is 385 ppm, but according to predictions the carbon dioxide concentration will reach 650 to 970 ppm by the end of the 21st century (IPCC 4 th report). The increase in temperature, which is more intensive in the Carpathian Basin than global, and the decrease in precipitation in summer (Bartholy, 2008; Mika, 1991) and the declining water reserves aggregate the disposition of the Hungarian climate to drought (Huszár, 1999). One direct consequence of the increasing CO2 concentration is that the assimilation rate of plants is more intens (Wolf, 1996). Elevated CO2 level increase both the above-ground and below-ground biomass. The two impacts may interact as higher carbon dioxide levels can decrease the negative effect of drought on quantitative yield parameters (Bencze, 2007). Different varieties have different levels of adaptability which will make it possible to select genotypes which can be grown successfully even under changed conditions (Veisz et al. 2005). High temperature reduces the antioxidant enzyme activities and the intensity of the reactions decrease as the plants age (Balla et al. 2007). Materials and methods This study was carried out in two PGV-36 growth chambers at the Agricultural Research Institute of HAS in Martonvásár. Two winter wheat varieties, Mv Mambo and Mv Regiment, were raised at normal (380 ppm)(NC) and elevated (750 ppm)(EC) carbon dioxide concentration and the Spring 2 - Summer 2 climatic programme</p><p id="Pg207">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 210 (Tischner et al. 1997) was applied in both chambers. Four seedlings were planted after vernalization for 42 days in pots containing approximately 3000 cm 3 of a soil and sand mixture. The irrigation was constant and nutrient solution was used twice a week till the start of the treatments. Drought effects and yield parameters were examined at both CO2 concentrations compared to the control. The first period of water withdrawal was after the first node appearance (FNA), the second during heading (H) and the last 10 days after full heading, in the grain filling (GF) period. Drought was continued for 3-7 days during which time the volumetric water content (VWC %) of the soil decreased from 20-25 VWC% to 3-5 VWC% while the plants started to wilt. The water content of the pots was measured using an Em50 data logger and ECH2O EC-05 sensors (Decagon Inc., USA). Antioxidant samples were collected at various level of water stress and were stored at at -80 o C until the analyses. Antioxidant enzyme activity was recorded using the methodology of Janda et al. (2005). Measurements were made on five enzymes: catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase. The grain number, grain weight, biomass production per plant, and the thousand-kernel weight (TKW) were determined after harvest. Two-way ANOVA was used to establish the significant level between the treatments (Kuti et al. 2008). Results and discussion The grain number per plant did not change significantly in response to drought stress in Mv Mambo (Table 1.) while higher atmospheric CO2 level increased the grain number in the control and in the GF treatment compared to the ambient CO2 but it had no effect in the other two treatments (Table 2.). In response to higher atmospheric CO2 level there was an increase in grain number in the control and in the GF plants, compared with normal CO2, while the other two treatments did not respond to enhanced CO2. The grain number of Mv Regiment declined significantly as the result of drought in the FNA and H treatments at high CO2 level, but was still higher than that recorded at the ambient concentration under water stress conditions. In response to a dry period the grain yield of Mv Mambó did not change in the FNA or H treatments at either CO2 level. Plants treated at the grain filling period, however, exhibited a 30.1% reduction in the grain weight per plant at normal CO2 level, while this decrease was considerably smaller (17.8%) at the higher concentration. High CO2 concentration thus had a favourable effect on the grain production. At normal CO2 a significant difference was only observed in Mv Regiment in the GF treatment, with a value 22.3% lower than the control, while no difference was observed between the treatments at enhanced CO2. In response to higher CO2, an increase in grain yield per plant was observed both in the control and in the three treatments. The effect of drought stress at the grain filling period was particularly striking at higher CO2, where the grain weight was 65.7% higher than that of plants raised under normal CO2. A significant reduction in the aboveground biomass of plants exposed to water stress in various phenophases was only observed in the GF treatment at normal CO2 (15.2% for Mv Mambó and 14.5% for Mv Regiment). In the case of Mv Mambó the biomass production in the control and GF treatments was 16.9% and 32.15% higher, respectively, at high CO2 than at the normal concentration, while in Mv Regiment a</p><p id="Pg208">VIII.

Mv Mambó made better use of low soil moisture contents, with only slight changes in yields, but the effect of a higher level of available CO2 was not reflected in the yield, despite the fact that positive changes were recorded in the spike number and productivity. Mv Regiment proved to be more sensitive to water withholding, but it exploited surplus CO2 more efficiently and was thus able to compensate for the negative effects of drought, resulting in a higher yield level than that of Mv Mambó at enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.

The effectiveness of the powdery mildew resistance conferred by 18 major Pm genes and their combinations were tested both in greenhouse experiments using various mono-isolates and in the field in the period between 2006 and 2008. The differential set recommended by the COST817 Action was used in greenhouse experiments and a variety that does not carry any known Pm gene served as the control. The results showed that none of the Pm genes tested were able to confer complete resistance against powdery mildew. In all three years a high level of virulence (&gt;90%) was observed on test varieties carrying resistance genes Pm2, Pm3c, Pm4a, Pm5, Pm6 and Pm8. During the experimental period there was an increase in the ratio of isolates virulent to Pm17, which could be due to the introduction of varieties carrying the 1A/1R translocation. The field trials revealed that several Pm genes were able to confer above-average resistance in the wheat genotypes tested. Differentials carrying genes Pm3d, Pm3f, Pm4b or Pm5 or the gene combination Pm2+6 exhibited resistance that did not differ significantly from 0 % severity. Genotypes carrying genes Pm2, Pm3c, Pm4a, or one of the most widespread genes in Hungary, Pm8, were severely infected, so these genes did not confer effective control of powdery mildew infection in the field. Key words: powdery mildew, Pm genes, biotic stress Introduction Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis, is a disease that causes extensive losses every year in all the wheat-growing regions of the world. The first epidemic in Hungary was reported in 1961 (Podhradszky and Csuti 1962), and since then natural infection has occurred every year. The powdery mildew resistance of wheat genotypes is determined by known major genes and/or quantitative resistance genes with an additive effect. Up till now 58 powdery mildew resistance genes or alleles have been identified at 39 loci on 16 different chromosomes (McIntosh et al. 2008), but more and more major genes are being incorporated into wheat from alien species (Tang et al. 2008). The gene-for-gene effect first reported by Flor (1955) can be clearly proved between the pathogen and the majority of the host plants carrying these genes. In the case of the wheat–wheat powdery mildew relationship, Powers and Sando (1960) were the first to demonstrate that avirulence genes corresponding to the resistance factors in the host plant could be found in the pathogen. Most race-specific genes function throughout the wheat vegetation period, but a few (Pm5, Pm6, Pm 17) are mainly effective in adult plants (Lebstock and Briggle 1974, Csısz et al. 1997). A knowledge of the genetic background of powdery mildew resistance in cultivated varieties and in the parental genotypes used in crossing programmes is valuable information for breeders. This knowledge, combined with information on the virulence spectrum of the pathogen, allows resistance to be retained for a long period (Hsam and Zeller 2002). The powdery mildew population is constantly changing. On the basis of thirty years of data, Szunics et al. (2000) observed a general tendency for an increase in the ratio of pathotypes with complex virulence in the pathogen population over recent decades. This</p><p id="Pg211">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 214 was confirmed by results obtained in the eastern part of the United States (Niewoehner and Leath 1998). This paper discusses the results of three years (2006–2008) of research on the powdery mildew resistance of wheat varieties and lines grown in the greenhouse and nursery in Martonvásár. Materials and methods The efficiency of major gene resistance was tested for 18 Pm genes or gene combinations under greenhouse and field conditions in three consecutive years (2006– 2008). In seedling tests in the greenhouse, a total of 558 single-pustule wheat powdery mildew isolates were used to test the efficiency of major genes. The powdery mildew pustules originated from winter wheat varieties currently or previously grown on large areas in Hungary. Sixteen varieties from the test collection recommended by COST Action 817 (Clarkson 2000) and a susceptible genotype carrying resistance genes not found in these varieties (Carsten V. – susceptible control and Michigan Amber/Chancellor*8) were used in the experiments. The greenhouse experiment was evaluated as described by Vida et al. (2007). The degree of powdery mildew infection of wheat genotypes carrying known Pm genes or gene combinations was investigated in a field experiment with three replications. Irrigation was carried out in the vicinity of the experiment so that the increased humidity would favour the spread of the pathogen. In the course of the vegetation period the severity % was observed every seven days on a total of five occasions and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated from the data. Two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data (Kuti et al. 2008). Results The seedling test revealed virulence in the pathogen population to all the resistance genes tested, but substantial differences were observed in the degree of virulence for the individual genes (Table 1).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 215 Virulence was less than 50% for several alleles of the Pm3 gene (Pm3b, Pm3d, Pm3f), while virulence of over 90% was observed in the pathogen population for resistance genes Pm2, Pm3c, Pm4a, Pm5, Pm6 and Pm8. During the three years of the experiment there was an increase in the ratio of isolates virulent to Pm17, which could be associated with the appearance of varieties carrying the 1A/1R translocation in general cultivation. The powdery mildew infection of varieties carrying known resistance genes was also tested in the field in a replicated experiment (Table 2). In contrast to the results of preliminary virulence surveys, Pm3d was found to provide excellent protection against powdery mildew. Several genes and gene combinations (Pm3f, Pm4b, Pm5 and Pm2+6) conferred partial resistance. Genotypes carrying genes Pm2, Pm3c, and Pm4a, as well as one of the most widespread gene in Hungary, Pm8, were infected considerably and did not confer effective control against powdery mildew infections in the field.

Abbreviations: CC=Chancellor, M.Amber=Michigan Amber, M.Huntsman= Maris Huntsman Conclusions Due to the biology of the powdery mildew fungus and to the great variability of its populations, the exploitation of major gene resistance is only a short-term solution (McDonald and Linde 2002). This was confirmed by the present experiments, as virulence was detected in the pathogen population to all the Pm genes tested. Nevertheless the variety ‘Ralle’, which carries the Pm3d gene and was infected in greenhouse seedling tests by 36.1–43.9% of the powdery mildew isolates, exhibited excellent powdery mildew resistance under field conditions. Although this gene can be found in several varieties of European origin (McIntosh et al. 2008), to the best of our knowledge, no varieties carrying the Pm3d gene are currently cultivated in Hungary, which could explain the low ratio of virulent pathotypes in the pathogen population. Further tests will be required to determine whether this resistance is only effective in adult plants, like many other powdery mildew genes, or whether any other Pm genes are present in ‘Ralle’ apart from the Pm3d gene, thus improving its resistance by pyramiding. The present results indicate that none of the resistance genes tested is capable of providing reliable protection against the Hungarian pathogen population, so none of them can be used alone as the basis of efficient resistance breeding.</p><p id="Pg213">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

In recent years a complete information system has been elaborated in Martonvásár, which amalgamates breeding and IT knowledge and is continually revised. The use of methods based on molecular breeding and the transgenic technique have made it necessary to create new types of databases to record information on genes, markers and transformation vectors. In order to facilitate the use of the data by breeders, new software also had to be designed for the following functions: (1) to identify useful resistance genes in genomic databases, (2) to identify and store markers suitable for the marker-assisted selection of basic genetic materials, (3) to provide real-time information to breeders (at the required time for the required search parameters) to facilitate the choice of crossing partners, (4) to test the ability to monitor transformation experiments, and (5) to make these experiments compatible with conventional breeding (crossing) programmes. Keywords: agroinformatics, breeding, marker-assisted, selection, genomic database, software Introduction The aim of (wheat) breeding against biotic and abiotic stress effects is to develop highly resistant varieties with better disease resistance than currently cultivated varieties and with better tolerance of drought, frost and herbicides, on the basis of which they can be recommended to growers. In Martonvásár there is a long tradition of testing wheat varieties, breeding lines and resistance sources in artificially inoculated nurseries, followed by the selection of disease-resistant plants from the segregating progeny populations (Szunics, 1973). The development of resistant or only slightly susceptible wheat varieties continues to be a high priority (Vida, 2008). Another tradition is the testing of lines for frost resistance in the phytotron before entering them for state trials (Veisz, 2001). The future aims of wheat breeding can only be achieved if these traditional breeding methods are successfully integrated with molecular breeding methods (Bedı, 2007). Molecular marker analysis generates a new type of data (Uhrin, 2006), (Tar, 2008), which need to be linked with the wheat breeding information system already operating. The present system (Láng, 2001) was set up in order to ensure the uniform handling of data from breeding and field research programmes, to facilitate the organisation of breeding activities, and to increase the size and efficiency of research programmes. It can be used to register breeding materials, to design field and laboratory experiments, to collect experimental data online and to rapidly evaluate the experiments. Cereal gene bank records and the exchange of basic stock use the same system as the registration of breeding data, including the pedigree database. In the framework of the institute’s research projects, molecular marker-assisted selection is used to incorporate known resistance genes into varieties adapted to Hungarian conditions and to select resistant phenotypes, with the aim of improving biotic and abiotic stress resistance. Work has begun on the pyramiding of resistance genes into winter wheat genotypes. The IT tools required for molecular plant breeding include: (1) a uniform data structure, which provides the easily accessed, centralised storage of specific information from various</p><p id="Pg215">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 218 breeding programmes, (2) direct links between existing gene source records (Kuti, 2006) and newly generated molecular marker data, and (3) a software module to ensure that the expensively produced and recorded data are displayed in groupings that facilitate scientific decisions on the selection of breeding materials. Materials and methods The handling of a large volume of data can be simplified by storing them in databases, which also facilitates the intelligent processing and evaluation of the results. When designing the gene technology database, the normalisation of the structure of the tables in the database was continued until the third normal form was reached, which proved to be a good compromise between the relatively simple ordering of the data and the resulting redundancy (Hernandez, 2003). The database and the tables it contains were developed using the database engine of Microsoft® MS Access and Microsoft JET (Joint Engine Technology). The application package for data handling, processing and evaluating (Breeder) was developed using the Microsoft® Visual Basic Integrated Development Environment (VB-IDE). The application can be run using various versions of the Windows operating system: Windows® 2000/XP/VISTA. The majority of the output and input data used by the Breeder package are in formats that can also be displayed in Microsoft OfficeXP® package components such as Microsoft® Excel, Microsoft® Access and Microsoft® Word, all of which run in the Windows® operating system, so it is advisable to install the Office package in the workstations. Results and discussion Data modelling The gene technology database ensures the storage and flow of specific information related to molecular marker-assisted selection, thus providing a reliable source of information for the analysis of the genetic background of lines including in crossing programmes. It allows the grouping/selection of gene sources from which a higher percentage of lines with good resistance are likely to arise. The information is stored in the database according to various topic, so that each topic is represented by a data table. It is important that each table should only contain information referring to the relevant topic (Fig. 1). As is clear from Figure 1., the gene technology database consists of several tables, some of which (a, b, c) serve for the recording of information on genes, markers and primers, while others fulfil a linking role, managing many-to-many (M:N) relationships within the database (d, e) or between databases (f). How data are entered into the tables depends on the type of table. Gene, marker and primer data can be entered in various ways: directly into the tables with the help of the database handling system (MS ACCESS), using the user-friendly data input module of Breeder, or from tables of a given structure (Excel), using the special functions of Breeder. The Breeder system automatically keeps the linking tables up to date. Whenever any change occurs in the interconnected tables, the relevant data are also entered into the linking tables. The</p><p id="Pg216">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 219 database is open and new data are continually added to the tables. Their structure can be flexibly changed so that previously unplanned parameters or new topics of value for decision-making can be added to the data structure. Operation of the system Using new molecular marker data originating from various sources (own data, literature) the genetic background of the basic breeding stock can be defined increasingly accurately. This means that decisions on selection can be based on an upto-date, relevant gene technological information base providing a characterisation of the genetic background of the gene sources. In practice this was achieved by linking (data design + special applications) the pedigree database (approx. 150,000 genotypes) and the breeding trial and field data records (approx. 130,000 records each year) with the uniform database of the gene technology records, as seen in Figure 1. In this way, the gene technology information can be directly linked to specific wheat varieties, breeding lines and resistance sources (both Martonvásár and non-Martonvásár). Figure 1. Relationship between the FIELD TRIAL, PEDIGREE and MOLECULAR databases This means that, when planning crossing programmes, the system is able to set up parental groups consisting of all the genotypes identified on the basis of the available information as carrying the resistance gene(s) targeted by the crossing programme (Fig. 2). Conversely, information on a selected parental line (relevant genes, markers, primers, etc.) can be made instantly available to the breeder from the gene technology subsystem. In other words, the specific information on parental partners stored in the gene technology database allows more accurate predictions to be made concerning the traits likely to be inherited, without having to carry out phenotypic testing for disease resistance. Priority is given to data originating from research carried out in Martonvásár or in cooperation with foreign partners, while data from the literature are treated with more circumspection.</p><p id="Pg217">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 220 Figure 2. Technology of data processing Conclusions The enormous advances in molecular genetics and its methodological application (biotechnology) have contributed to improvements in the agronomically important traits of crops, increasing their resistance to biotic and abiotic stress factors. This new technology complements conventional breeding techniques and, in combination with information technologies, considerably improves their efficiency. The collection of molecular marker-assisted selection data from our own research and from the literature, and their integration into earlier data models and pedigree records means that the genetic background of fundamentally important resistance sources can be analysed during the design of crossing programmes. The results reach the breeder via specific applications in the form of predictive and prognostic selection information, making use of the available IT tools and the accelerated recognition of the genetic background of the traits. The new system can also be applied in other research projects where the large number of genotypes and markers for testing means that the body of data is too large to be analysed by conventional methods.

Szabadság u., Szarvas, H5540, Hungary, e-mail: hajos.maria@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract: As a result of our three-year-long experiment it was concluded that the daily maximum temperatures should be carefully considered at the sowing of table beet seeds at the beginning of July on fluvial meadow soil, as the days of extremely high temperature (&gt;30oC) or the days with temperature over 20oC decrease the germination and later the accumulation of colour materials in the beet root. According to our studies the Hungarian varieties, Favorit and Rubin approved to be the most stable, which showed good quality even at extremely high temperatures. Keywords: table beet varieties, colour content, betacyanine, betaxantine, air temperature Introduction The quality of table beet is based mainly on its colour material content, the amount of which depends not only on the genotype but on the environmental conditions as well (light, rainfall, temperature, nutrient supply). Thus the growing season also determines the produce quality. In Hungary the table beet is grown mostly as a second crop. Thus the short vegetation season (100 days) makes the autumn processing possible. However, in other European countries it is sown in spring, too. In our experiment (Takácsné Hájos, 1993) the influence of different sowing times on colour material accumulation of beet root was studied. Experiments with carrot indicated, that during unfavourable environmental changes the sucrose content in taproot is influenced by PFP (pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase), with is involved in the mobilisation of energy reserves (Kovács et al., 2007). It was found that the colour material accumulation of beet root is determined mostly by the variety, sowing time and air temperature. This hypothesis was also proven by Watson and Gabelman’s experiments (1982). Researchers determined that there are differences between the carrot varieties in their adaptability to drought and heat. It is could be detected as changes in the chlorophyll and carotene contents of the leaves even at 30/15 °C (Nemeskéri et al., 2008). In our climatic conditions the higher than 20 o C daily average temperature influenced the colour accumulation of beet roots negatively. The highest beta-cyanine content was found on 75 th day of vegetation in case of May sowing, while it was found on 135 th day in case of June sowing, and the water soluble dry matter content was also low in this case. Such a basic material is utilizable for producing natural colouring substance. Based on our experiments the climatic conditions for sowing of table beet were the best in July, which is explained by the favourable effect of cool temperature of less then 20 o C. The colour substance content of beet roots from this sowing showed the maximum level on the 100 th day of the vegetation season, while the water soluble dry matter content was also high. In this study the effects of high summer temperatures on the amount of red and yellow colour substance of table beet were evaluated, and the proportion of the two colour substances to each other was also studied. Sometimes apply salicylic acid (SA) treatment to increase stress tolerance. It was successful in the experiment with tomato, where the acclimation to high salinity was stated (Szepesi et al., 2008). The expectable</p><p id="Pg219">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 222 effects of the climatic change are the sultry summers and the lack of rainfall, which might highly modify the growing technology of some vegetables. Therefore the testing of effects of scorcher days (&gt;30 o C) on vegetables might be important. Such a plant is the table beet, which is sown at the end of June and the beginning of July in Hungary. Materials and methods The experiments were conducted in Galambos Horticultural Experimental Farm of Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management of Szent Istvan University between 2006 and 2008. Among the experimental varieties there were four Hungarian ones (Favorit, Rubin, Bordó, Detroit) and a Dutch one (Little Ball). The seeds were sown in four repetitions on fluvial meadow soil, the characterization of which is shown in Table 1. The sowing was carried out at the end of June and beginning of July, which are the most preferred time periods in the Hungarian table beet growing. The row space was 40 cm. During the vegetation season the agro-technical processes needed for the table beet were carried out. The colour substance quantities were measured by the atomic absorption method. The absorbance values of the two colour substances were determined (betacyanine – 537 nm, betaxantine – 478 nm), finally measurements were taken at 600 nm, too. The colouring substance concentration was calculated by Nilsson’s method (1970), and the results were given for the amount of mg betacyanine/100 g raw mass.

This year complete plant canopy could not develop during the experiment as the real scorcher during the days of sowing inhibited the</p><p id="Pg220">VIII.

In 2007 the monthly average temperature in June and July was much higher than 20 o C (23.61 and 23.09 o C), and the soil temperature was also hardly less than 25 o C. Besides these extraordinary temperature conditions there was very low precipitation during the time of sowing. Table 2 Number of scorcher days (&gt;30°C), Szarvas 2005-2008 Month/year 2005 2006 2007 2008 July 7 21 15 7 August 3 5 17 13 During the other examined years (2005, 2006 and 2008) a complete plant canopy developed. The red (BC) and yellow (BX) colouring substance content of beet roots compared to (Table 3-4) the September average temperature of different years it was found that the temperatures around 15 o C influenced the accumulation of colouring substance in the beet root favourably. The lowest colouring substance values were found in 2005 when the natural precipitation was more than double of the years 2006 and 2008. It was found that the better water supply in the vegetation season resulted in bigger beet roots, which at the same time resulted in the dilution of colouring substances. It is demonstrated by the correlation connection between the amount of precipitation and betacianine content: r = -0.95. The highest colouring substance content was found in the Hungarian variety Favorit, while the varieties Detroit and Little Ball were characterized by weaker quality than the other ones as a consequence of our very hot summers.

The accumulation of yellow and red colouring substances determining the quality of table beet might be influenced more favourably by the September cool weather (under 20 o C), which is in the period of intensive root development phase of table beet. It is advised to wait with the sowing for a cooler period in the period between the end of June and beginning of July, as the germination will be more favourable. The application of irrigation water on the scorcher days at nearly 25 o C soil temperature, the glomerule could not survive in the soil. It is also suggested to postpone the sowing to the middle of July or do it as early as May because otherwise the summer scorcher might cause difficulties in the early development and the accumulation of colouring substances.

Arthropod species as potato pests can cause severe damages. Chemical treatments are inevitable in protection of potato plants but insecticides have an effect of useful species too. We have been studying the arthropod fauna of potato fields of the centre in three consecutive years (2006-2008) with the aim of revealing the effect of insecticide treatments on the harmful and useful species. Standard sweep netting was used for collecting insects from the foliage of potato plants. Collections were made one day before then 24 and 96 hours after insecticide treatments. Collected material was preserved, separated and identified. There was a considerable difference in the numbers of species among the three investigated years. It was established that different types of insecticide treatments effect quite differently on the number of harmful and useful arthropods. Keywords: insecticides, useful and harmful arthropods, potato Introduction There were several researches performed in Hungary and its neighbouring countries with reference to potato production (JERMY et al. 2006, POLJAK et al. 2007, HORVAT et al. 2008, NOVAK et al. 2008). But there are not any references in the scientific literature about the useful organisms of this crop. There were some unsuccessful attempts trying to resettle and acclimatize a predator bug of Colorado potato beetle, but they did not provide any information about the useful fauna of potato (JERMY 1967, KERESZTES et al. 2004). Natural enemies of other potato pests were not studied in the extra-European region either, but former researches proved, that predators of potato aphids are permanent visitors of potato fields (BEN SAAD and BISHOP 1976). It is more and more typical nowadays to study the natural enemies of each pest than investigate the whole useful community (KESZTHELYI 2004).We had the opportunity to join in the researches of Potato Research Centre for surveying the fauna of their potato fields in consecutive years (2006-2008). Our investigations were aimed at studying the effect of different insecticide treatments on harmful and useful arthropods living in the foliage of potato plants. Materials and methods Collections were made with standard sweep net one day before then 24 and 96 hours after insecticide treatments. Ten samples were drawn per plots and ten net strokes represented a sample with the exception of the year 2008, when six samples were drawn per each plot. Collected material was sorted into major taxonomic groups and then preserved in 70% ethanol till the identification. Standard identification keys were used in case of spiders (Araneae), and other arthropods (HEIMER and NENTWIG 1991, STEINMANN 1967, 1974, MERKL, 1982). Some species of plant hoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) and true bugs (Heteroptera) were identified with the help of specialists. Insecticide treatments were not the same in the different years. The three</p><p id="Pg223">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 226 consecutive years were evaluated separately owing to the differences percept on the untreated control plots as well. Results and discussion There were a lot of aphids collected in 2006. Aphis nasturtii (Kaltenbach 1843) was the dominant among them, but there occurred two other typical potato aphids too. Plantparasitic hemipterans were represented by some psyllids. Among plant hoppers Empoasca decipiens (Paoli 1930) and E. pteridis (Dahlborn 1850) leafhoppers were the richest in number every year. Eupteryx atropunctata (Goeze 1778) and Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén 1826) delphacid planthoppers were also significant species. Philaenus spumarius (Linnaeus 1758) polyphagous froghopper was detected in each examined year. In case of harmful true bugs Lygus rugulipennis (Poppius 1911) was the dominant species and Closterotomus norwegicus (Gmelin 1790) was also quite frequent. Caterpillars of Lacanobia oleracea (Linnaeus 1758) owlet moth were collected in large numbers only in 2007 when it was the dominant chewing pest. Different developmental stages of Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say 1824) were collected only in 2007 and 2008. The family Anthocoridae (minute pirate bugs) was the most significant useful group within true bugs. For species were caught among them with the dominance of Orius minutus (Linnaeus 1758) and Orius majusculus (Reuter 1879) in each year. Damsel bugs (Nabidae) were only found in 2007 and 2008 represented by the dominant species Nabis punctatus (A. Costa 1847). Among ladybirds seven-spotted ladybird Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus 1758) was dominant. Lacewings (Neuroptera) were represented mostly by green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens 1836). Parasitic wasps (Ichneumonoidea and Chalcidoidea) were only collected in 2006 owing to the large number of aphids that time. Among earwigs (Dermaptera) Chelidura acanthopygia (Gene 1832) was found in 2006, however there was not any single specimen collected in 2007 and 2008 owing to the lack of aphids. Spiders (Araneae) were represented by numerous families (both web-building and hunting). In 2006 Theridion impressum (L. Koch 1881) cobweb spider was quite frequent, but sheetweb spiders (Linyphiidae) were dominant. In 2007 Araeoncus humilis (Blackwall 1841) sheetweb spider was dominant and its other family members gave the greater part of collected spiders. In 2008 Misumenops tricuspidatus (Fabricius 1775) crab spider (Thomisidae) was dominant, moreover its family occurred in large number all year. The different dominance ratios of polyphagous spiders clearly demonstrated the diversity of meteorological conditions in the three examined years. In 2006 insecticide treatments were applied with Prestige 290 FS (pencycuron + imidachloprid), Mospilan 20 SP (acetamiprid), Bancol 50 WP (bensultap) + Talstar 10 EC (bifentrine) and Steward (indoxacarb) on 23 th June. Our collections were carried out on a field where seed tubers were dressed with Marshal 25 EC (carbosulfane). There were only two samples drawn 24 hours before treatments without netting each plot, therefore that result are not comparable to those made after the applications so they were not symbolised on the diagrams. Material derived from collections made 24 and 96 hours after treatments were symbolised as 24’ and 96’ written after the name of insecticides. Marshal 24’ and Marshal 96’ can be reckoned as a control compared to other years.</p><p id="Pg224">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 227 Only the number of aphids showed some decrease in the control plots after 24 hours. It is not likely that this decrease occurred on account of insecticide treatments since all other plots were also dressed. Their decrease in occurrence was considered to be drastic on plots treated with Prestige 290 FS (Figure 1.). Owing to the lower number of aphids number of parasitoids was also lessened. Diminished number of spiders and parasitoids can be observed on the plots treated with Steward (Figure 2.).

There was not any basic treatment used so compared with the preceding year collections were made in an absolute untreated control plot as well. The same quantity of samples was taken 24 hours before and after the treatments from each plot and they were symbolised with 00’written after the names of insecticides, other markings were the same as in the preceding year. Treatments with Bancol + Tastar and Kohinor decreased the number of pest markedly while Chess had lesser reductive effect on sucking pests (Figure 3.).

Collections and markings were the same as in precedent years.

To overcome the drought problems efficiently, an innovative sustainable irrigation technique called Partial Root Drying (PRD) was proposed. PRD is an irrigation technique where half of the root zone is irrigated while the other half is allowed to dry out. The treatment is then reversed, allowing the previously well-watered side of the root system to dry down while fully irrigating the previously dry side. The PRD benefit is in the terms of improved water-use efficiency (IWUE). The aim of presented work was to compare the effects of PRD with full irrigation (FI) on yield of field-grown potato, and to test for effects of PRD on IWUE, tuber yield and quality. The experiments were conducted during 2007 and 2008 seasons. In PRD treatment in 2007 season 70% of the irrigation water in FI was applied to one half of the root system, although in 2008 season PRD was applied dynamically (by replacing 70% PRD with 50% PRD in last two weeks). Irrigation scheduling was based on evapotranspiration and soil water data (measured by TDR). Experimental results for both seasons confirmed that with PRD irrigation it is possible to increase IWUE, save water for irrigation and increase quality of potato tuber (starch content). Keywords: potato, PRD, yield, IWUE, starch, sugars Introduction Drought is one of the most common environmental stresses that may limit agricultural production worldwide. Many vegetables, including potato, have high water requirements and supplemental irrigation is necessary for successful production (Fabeiro et al., 2001). However, in many countries as a consequence of global climate changes and environmental pollution, water use for agriculture is reduced (FAO, 2002). To overcome the drought problems efficiently, an innovative sustainable irrigation technique called Partial Root Drying (PRD) was proposed. Partial root drying (PRD) is an irrigation technique where half of the root zone is irrigated while the other half is allowed to dry out. The treatment is then reversed, allowing the previously well-watered side of the root system to dry down while fully irrigating the previously dry side. Comparing to other irrigation methods implementation of the PRD technique is simple and requires only the adaptation of irrigation systems in a such way to allow alternate wetting and drying of part of the root zone (FAO, 2002). The PRD results for different plant species (including potato) demonstrated the benefit of these methods in terms of improved water-use efficiency (Davies et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2006; Shanhazari et al., 2007). The aim of the presented research was to apply and assess the effects PRD technology on potato yield, yield quality and irrigation water use efficiency in the field trial in Serbia. Materials and methods The experiment with potato was conducted in the opened field situated in the farm for growing vegetables (“Salate Centre”), 10 km north of Serbian capital Belgrade. The soil of field site is a silty-clay and it was developed on alluvial deposit. Potato seeds tubers (Solanum tuberosum var. Liseta) were planted in the beginning of April. During the</p><p id="Pg227">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 230 vegetation seasons plants were treated against weeds and fungal disease and regularly fertilized. Irrigation system applied was subsurface drip irrigation and the irrigation management included partial root drying (PRD) and full irrigation (FI). For the FI treatment, one drip line was placed in the top of the ridge although in PRD treatment two drip lines were operated separately and were placed in parallel in the top of the ridge. In both investigated seasons the irrigation started during the tuber filling and ended 2 weeks before final harvest. The soil water content in FI treatment was kept close to field capacity. In PRD treatment one side of the row was irrigated while the other was kept dry and plants received 70% or 50% of FI depending of investigated season. During 2007 year PRD treated plants received 70% of the irrigation water of FI, although in 2008 the PRD system was applied as 70% of FI and 50% of FI (last two weeks of irrigation period). The PRD irrigation was shifted between two sides of the plants every 5 to 7 days depending on soil water content. Measurements of soil water content were done by TDR probes (Time domain reflectometer, TRASE, Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., USA) twice per week and these data were used to adjust irrigation water requirement during growing seasons. At the end of the vegetation seasons, analyses of tuber yield, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and tubers quality were carried out. Potato yield was calculated as tuber fresh weight per plant, IWUE as the ratio of tuber fresh mass and irrigation water applied in during vegetation season. The tuber harvest quality was characterised by analysing of starch (after isolation followed by acid hydrolysis detected as reducing sugar) and soluble reducing sugars (by Luff-Schoorl's method, ISI, 2002). The measured traits have been analyzed for statistically significant differences by Student’s unpaired t-tests (Sigma Plot 6.0 for Windows - SPW 6.0, Jandel Scientific, Erckhart, Germany. Results and discussion The climate in field side is continental type with hot and dry summers and cold and rainy winters. As in the rest of Serbia, farm suffers from water deficit during the main growing season. Precipitation data (Fig.1) showed that during the experimental period (from April to the end of August) the precipitation was lower in 2008 than in 2007, although the mean temperature were similar in both seasons (Fig.1). Due to lower precipitation in 2008, comparing to 2007 (about 50mm) and higher evapotranspiration (about 20mm) during the growing season, the water deficit was bigger in 2008 comparing to 2007 and thus the number of irrigation and amounts of applied water was increased in 2008 comparing to 2007.</p><p id="Pg228">VIII.

Average precipitation and mean temperature in the area of the field trial during growing seasons of 2007 and 2008 Comparison between investigated years showed that yield in 2008 seasons was ca. 20% higher than in 2007 season (Table 1). It is well known that potatoes are very sensitive to soil moisture stress (Onder et al., 2005) and, thus, the increased number of irrigation in 2008 had positive effect on yield. Comparing to FI the PRD treatment had a reducing effect on yield in both investigated years (20 and 12% for 2007 and 2008, respectively). In the literature there is an inconsistency on the effects of the PRD on potato yield. Our results are in agreement with the results of Liu et al., (2006) which showed that yield was reduced in potato plants exposed to PRD and comparing to FI treatments. However, the results of Shanhazari et al., (2007) showed that with the PRD treatments maintenance of yield and number of tubers could be achieved. Comparison between PRD treatments in investigated 2007 and 2008 seasons showed that yield of PRD treated crops in 2008 ca. 65% higher than in 2007 years. These results confirmed that the dynamic approach of PRD, when during the late tuber filling stages the PRD 70% was replaced by PRD 50%, had a positive effect on yield. Table 1.

The concentrations of quality parameters (starch and reducing sugars) in both investigated years fitted the range of values that have usually been reported for potato tubers with no indication of promoting undesirable changes when potatoes are intended for further processing (Nourian et al., 2003). Technological quality with regard to starch content in tubers of PRD comparing to FI-treated plants showed an increased effect in both years. Comparison between treatments in both years showed that PRD treatments negligibly but not significantly reduced the content of sugars comparing to FI treatment. Conclusions Experimental results for both seasons confirmed that with PRD irrigation it is possible to increase IWUE, save water for irrigation and increase quality of potato tuber (starch content). Also, results indicated that PRD should be applied as a dynamic system which depends not only on available water for crops but also on crop growth stage. In general, two potatoes growing seasons confirmed that PRD could be useful strategy to save water for irrigation. This could be especially important for countries facing with drought and limited water resources for agricultural production as it is current situation in Serbia or other Western Balkan countries.

Recommendations on the end-use of the varieties can only be made based on knowledge of both yield levels and chemical quality. A total of 96 hybrids from four FAO maturity groups were examined at four locations in 2008 in order to analyse their yield and quality and to determine the effect of ecological factors on a number of parameters. The highest yield averages were recorded for hybrids in the FAO 300 group (12.95 t ha-1) at locations with the highest rainfall (Debrecen). In Debrecen and Iregszemcse the plants were able to develop a second ear, thus increasing the yield average (12.31 t ha-1, 11.75 t ha-1). In Szarvas irrigation helped to achieve good yields and reduce drought damage (10.97 t ha-1), while in Martonvásár, although rainfall sums were adequate, the uneven distribution and atmospheric drought led to lower yields (9.65 t ha-1). In this experiment, early hybrids (FAO, 200, FAO 300) had the best yield stability. The starch content of the grain exhibited a close correlation with the yield average. The greatest starch incorporation was recorded for FAO 300 hybrids (72.86%). The expected negative correlation between starch content and protein/oil content was observed. The FAO 200 hybrids had the highest protein and oil contents (9.70 and 3.89%), which gradually declined at later maturity dates (FAO 500: 9.14 and 3.51%). The thousand-kernel mass and the length of the main ear were closely correlated with the maturity date, being lowest for the earliest hybrids (326.39 g, 18.91 cm) and highest in the latest group (346.91 g, 19.74 cm). For protein and oil content, genetic differences between the hybrids were greater (1.50, 1.00%) than between locations (0.97, 0.82%), while in the case of starch the latter caused greater differences (2.84, 4.06%). Keywords: maize hybrid, FAO maturity group, abiotic stress factors, protein, oil, starch Introduction The quantity and quality of the grain yield of maize hybrids are greatly influenced by ecological factors, particularly abiotic stress factors such as temperature and drought (Hegyi et al., 2008). Under Hungarian conditions the quantity and distribution of rainfall during the vegetation period are unfavourable (Polerecky, 1976). Long- term water deficiency at flowering increases the frequency of aborted grains (Zinselmeier et al., 1995), and water stress also affects flowering, yield quantity and the quality parameters of the yield (Bertic et al., 2008). In the driest months (July, August) maize needs 155–180 mm rainfall. In wet locations, or as the result of irrigation (Pepó et al., 2008) more starch is incorporated into the grains, leading to higher yields, but irrigation resulted in a significant reduction in the protein and oil concentrations of the grain (Josipovic et al., 2007). The grain yield is negatively correlated with the protein content (r = -0.48) and oil content (r = -0.19) of the grain (Svecnjak et al., 2007). Bioethanol production, which could provide a major market for maize, raises different quality criteria than the fodder industry (Voca et al., 2007). It is thus important to regularly check the grain quality of cultivated and newly bred hybrids, as new varieties tend to become uniform due to the narrow range of breeding aims (Sipos and Ungai, 2008). Materials and methods A total of 96 hybrids from four FAO maturity groups (FAO 200, FAO 300, FAO 400, FAO 500) were tested at four locations in Hungary (Iregszemcse, Debrecen,</p><p id="Pg231">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 234 Martonvásár, Szarvas) in 2008. The main aim of the experiment was to determine the yield, yield components and chemical quality parameters of the maize hybrids and the effect of ecological factors on these parameters. The locations differed as regards rainfall, temperature and number of very hot days. The highest rainfall quantity during the vegetation period was recorded in Debrecen (492.8 mm), while the 482.7 mm measured in Martonvásár had very unfavourable distribution, with little rainfall during critical months when the number of very hot days was the greatest (temperatures above 30°C for 37 days). In Szarvas only 292.8 mm rain fell during the vegetation period, but this was supplemented by irrigation in June and July. Iregszemcse was the worst location as regards rainfall quantity (275.3 mm), but here the distribution was favourable, with 218 mm falling evenly between May and August. Results and discussion 1. Analysis of plant traits for each FAO maturity group (averaged over location and variety) Each trait was first examined for the individual FAO maturity group, averaged over hybrids and locations (Table 1). The highest yield averages were recorded for hybrids in the FAO 300 and FAO 400 groups (11.65; 11.36 t ha -1 ). Under the ecological conditions in Hungary it is these mid-season hybrids that give the highest yields over the average of wet and dry years. The lowest yields were found for the FAO 200 group (10.40 t ha -1 ) and those of the latest maturing hybrids (11.27 t ha -1 ) were also lower than for the midseason groups. On the basis of several years of results it can be concluded that hybrids in the FAO 500 group are not always able to achieve their greater genetic yield potential, especially in dry years. Table 1.

In the case of maize the primary cause of an increase in total yield is the increased accumulation of carbohydrates in the grains. It is probable that the rainfall quantity was satisfactory or optimum during the starch incorporation period for this maturity group. The average grain starch contents of FAO 400 and FAO 500 hybrids were lower than for FAO 300 hybrids (72.36; 72.57%).</p><p id="Pg232">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 235 The protein content of the hybrids (averaged over locations and varieties) was greatest in the FAO 200 group (9.70%), with values of 9.37% for FAO 300, 9.29% for FAO 400 and 9.14% for FAO 500. A similar tendency was observed for the grain oil content, with 3.89% for FAO 200, 3.84% for FAO 300 (which was not significantly different from the former), 3.72% for FAO 400 and 3.51% for FAO 500. The Bravais correlation coefficient between the protein and oil contents had a value of 0.62. The early FAO 200 hybrids had the smallest thousand-kernel mass (326.39 g), after which a linear increase was observed as the maturity period lengthened. The length of the main ear was also closely correlated with the length of the vegetation period, rising from 18.91 cm for FAO 200 hybrids to 19.12 cm for FAO 300, 19.56 cm for FAO 400 and 19.74 cm for the latest hybrids. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 D eb re ce n Ir eg sz em cs e M ar to nv ás ár S za rv as D eb re ce n Ir eg sz em cs e M ar to nv ás ár S za rv as D eb re ce n Ir eg sz em cs e M ar to nv ás ár S za rv as D eb re ce n Ir eg sz em cs e M ar to nv ás ár S za rv as Mv 255 Amanita Miranda Mv 500 FAO 200 FAO 300 FAO 400 FAO 500 yi el d t/h a Figure 1. Yield stability of the hybrids giving the greatest yield averages in each maturity group 2. Evaluation of traits according to locations (averaged over varieties and maturity groups) The maize hybrids had the highest average yields in Debrecen (12.31 t ha -1 ). In this location the hybrids were able to develop secondary ears. The grand average at Iregszemcse was 11.75 t ha -1 , where secondary ears again contributed to the good yield. The average yield was 10.97 t ha -1 in Szarvas and 9.65 t ha -1 in Martonvásár. For each of the maturity groups the hybrid with the highest yield average was selected and the yield stability of these hybrids was investigated (Fig. 1). The least yield fluctuation was exhibited by the earliest hybrid (Mv 255: 2.42 t ha -1 ), followed by the FAO 300 hybrid Amanita (3.09 t ha -1 ). Both the FAO 400 and FAO 500 hybrids exhibited greater yield fluctuations between locations (3.51, 5.00 t ha -1 ). The genetic determination of grain protein content is 0.67, which explains why the environment had a smaller effect on this parameter in the present experiment (difference between locations 0.97%) than differences between the varieties (1.50%). Due to the considerable genetic variability and the dependence on environmental conditions, it is possible to use breeding methods to develop varieties with higher inherited protein content, while also improving the protein ratio by agronomic means. A similar tendency</p><p id="Pg233">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 236 was noted for the grain oil content. Among the quality traits, the genetic determination of the starch content is the smallest, but no numerical value is available. In the present experiment the difference between the varieties was 2.84%, while the location had a greater influence, mainly due to the quantity of rainfall (4.06%). Conclusions Many scientists agree that, despite the decisive effect of inherited traits, the quality and quantity of maize yields can be considerably influenced by mineral fertilisation, irrigation and the use of up-to-date technologies (Bertic et al., 2008; Pepó el al., 2008). In the present experiment the highest yield averages were achieved with FAO 300 hybrids, which also exhibited the smallest yield fluctuations and had the highest starch contents. The greatest grain starch contents were recorded in wet locations (Debrecen), and this was closely correlated with the lowest grain protein and oil contents (Josipovic et al., 2007).An analysis of the relationship between location and quality traits revealed that the ecological differences between locations had a greater influence on the grain starch content than on the protein or oil content, which were subject to greater genetic determination than the starch content. There were greater differences in protein and oil content between the hybrids than between the locations. Knowledge on the effects of genetic factors and on their relationship with environmental and agronomic factors at both the species and hybrid level may have a fundamental influence on the method and success of farming (Hegyi et al., 2008; Sipos and Ungai, 2008).

A. Hlinku 2, 949 01 Nitra, email: Peter.Kovacik@uniag.sk 2 Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture and Economics, Hugo Kołłątaj´s Agricultural University in Krakow, Al. Mickiewicza 21, 31-120 Krakow, Poland Abstract: The stress effect of insufficient phosphorus nutrition on spring barley parameters was determined over a three-year trial in a small plots situated 11 kilometers far from town Nitra on haplic luvisol with low supply of Nan, P and Cox. Stress resulted from inadequate phosphorus nutrition during spring barley NK fertilization in relation to full NPK nutrition significantly decreased the grain yield, independently of whether nitrogen nutrition had taken place before seeding or during barley vegetation (growth stage DC 25). When nitrogen was applied before seeding, the decline of grain yield was by 1 270 kg ha-1, and by 590 kg ha-1 when nitrogen was applied during vegetation. These findings indicate that a deficit in phosphorus nutrition had a more negative effect on the level of the yield if nitrogen was applied before seeding, compared with N application in the DC 25 growth stage. It is clear from these findings that nitrogen fertilization restrains the symptoms caused by the lack of phosphorus during vegetation. The absence of phosphorus nutrition has also a negative effect on grain quality parameters (thousand kernel weight, volume weight, first-class grain percentage). This impact was also more significant when nitrogen had been applied before seeding. Keywords: phosphorus deficit, nutritional stress, nitrogen fertilization, spring barley Introduction In period 1980-1990, application rates of mineral fertilizers per hectare of agricultural land in Slovakia and Poland represented the level of about 150% of the rates applied in member states of European Union (12 countries). At present, consumption of mineral fertilizers reaches only 60% of current EU consumption (25 countries) in both these countries, i.e. about 45% in comparison with the eighties of last century. In addition, consumption of organic manures declined even more than twice (Pl) or three-times (SVK) during this time period. This situation caused decline of mobile forms of nutrients in soil and evoked that the effect of nutritional stress on yield parameters of grown crops is increasingly studied by many authors (Slamka et al., 2008; Macák et al., 2008) in both the states. Topic of nutritional stress effect on agricultural crops has been studying systematically within the framework of national research in Hungary over 40 years (Debreczeny and Berecz, 2008). The aim of our experiment was to contribute to solve this problematic from the viewpoint of phosphorus deficiency effect study on the spring barley yield characteristics, as nowadays phosphorus becomes limiting factor of soil fertility in both Poland and Slovakia. Materials and methods The field experiment was carried out in locality of Kolíňany (48°22´N and 18°12´E) on haplic luvisol with low supply of available phosphorus (44-48 mg kg -1 ) in soil profile of 0.0-0.3 m which enables to examine the effect of phosphorus deficiency stress on spring</p><p id="Pg235">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 238 barley yield parameters. Haplic luvisol agrochemical parameters were determined by methodical procedures stated below table 1. The experiment was established by block method with checkerboard arrangement of plots in three replications. As a model crop spring barley (variety Jubilant) was seeded at the seeding rate of 4 millions of germinative grains per hectare and grown in crop rotation after sugar beet which was fertilized insufficiently (for only 75% of its requirements). Experimental treatments and nutrient rates are illustrated in table 2. In treatment 1 (control) no fertilizers were applied. In treatments 2 to 5 mineral fertilizers were applied at the rates taking into account the supply of nutrients in soil. In relation to the low supply of P and medium supply of K in soil, there was used saturating system of fertilizing with phosphorus (amount of P taken off by aboveground phytomass + P needed for reaching medium supply level of P in soil) and so called substituting one with potassium (when only the amount taken by aboveground phytomass is returned into the soil) (Table 2). In treatments 2 and 3 nitrogen was applied before barley seeding and in treatments 4 and 5 at the end of tillering. Rate of nitrogen (DN) for treatments 2 and 3 was calculated by formula DN = PN –Nan x 9, where PN = need of nitrogen for planning yield of 5 t.ha -1 of grain (formation of 1t of grain needs 24 kg of nitrogen). Nan = content of inorganic (mineral) nitrogen determined before seeding in soil profile of 0.0-0.6 m. Number 9 represents coefficient for recalculating mg kg -1 unit to kg ha -1 one and is valid for the soil depth of 0.6 m and volume weight of 1.5 kg m -3 in this profile. Table 1.

Achieved results were evaluated by analysis of variance using computer programme Statgraphics, version 5. Results and discussion The stress of phosphorus deficit (low supply of mobile P in soil and absence of P nutrition - treat. 3 and 5) at sufficient NK nutrition (Table 3) caused statistically significant decrease of spring barley grain yield in comparison with complete NPK nutrition (treat. 2 and 4). Yield decline was more expressive when nitrogen fertilization was carried out before seeding (1 270 kg ha -1 , treat. 3 versus treat. 2) in comparison with N fertilization during growing season (590 kg ha -1 , treat. 5 versus treat. 4).

It decreased portion of the 1st class grain, thousand kernel weight and volume weight (treat. 2 versus treat. 3 and treat. 4 versus treat. 5), but worsening of these parameters was more marked under pre-seeding N fertilization like when nitrogen was applied during growing season. It implies from above stated facts that application of N during tillering softened negative effect of phosphorus deficit on quantitative as well as qualitative parameters of spring barley grain. Similar effect of N fertilization on the crude protein content was also found out. Content of crude protein in grain was increasing in consequence of P deficit under full NK nutrition; what is evaluated positively in this case, because there were the low crude protein contents in all treatments generally. Deficit of phosphorus nutrition negatively influenced economy of spring barley growing (Table 4). Under the absence of P nutrition, profit per hectare declined by 146.6 € when nitrogen was applied before seeding (treat. 3 versus treat. 2). However, when nitrogen was applied during growing season profit decreased only by 33.7 € ha -1 (treat. 5 versus treat. 4). Although the profit achieved in treatment 5 (absence of P nutrition) was lower than in treatment 4 (complete nutrition), it was higher than in other investigated treatments. At the same time the highest economical effectiveness of mineral fertilizers application was achieved in this treatment (treat. 5). This finding gives reasons why farmers in Poland and Slovakia (in spite of the spring barley yield parameters worsening in a consequence of insufficient P nutrition) are oriented particularly towards nitrogen nutrition and examination of its the most effective application.</p><p id="Pg237">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

It is also confirmed by yieldforming and economical effect of treatments 4 and 5 in relation to treatments 2 and 3. The highest grain yield of spring barley with adequate quality parameters was achieved in the treatment with complete NPK nutrition and when nitrogen was applied during growing season at the rate respecting its supply in soil and plant.

STANLEY Tomo MILOSEVIC 1 – Nebojsa MILOSEVIC 2 1 Faculty of Agronomy, Cacak, Cara Dusana 34, Serbia, e-mail: tomom@tfc.kg.ac.rs 2 Fruit Growing Institute, Cacak, Kralja Petra I/9, Serbia Abstract: The stress effect of Plum pox virus (PPV) on the vegetative growth and yield of cv. Stanley was examined under the conditions of Cacak (Western Serbia) in 2006-2007. The results showed that PPV induced significant differences in one-year-old shoot length (17.00%), fruit weight (6.21%) and yield per tree and unit area (20.61%) between infected and non-infected trees. Keywords: fruits, plum, plum pox virus, shoots, stress, yield Introduction Plum pox virus was registered in Serbia in 1936. Its negative effect is manifested in the stress being caused in infected cells, tissues and organs of plums and other stone fruits and ornamental plants (Horváth et al., 2007), particularly the fruit, inducing highly destructive changes inhibitory to normal metabolic processes (Hernández et al., 2007; Moor et al., 2007; Balla et al., 2008). Therefore, production in plum-growing countries have suffered great economic damages, being reflected in fruit size reduction and fruit shape deformities in susceptible cultivars (Christov, 1947; Jordovic and Janda, 1963) and reduced yields (Vágó et al., 2007) due to premature fruit drop - ranging from 2030% (Pribék, 2001) to 80-100% - in highly susceptible ones (Kegler and Hartman, 1998). The PPV-infected trees exhibit limited vegetative growth (Kišpatić, 1987), adversely affecting their vitality and yield capacity in subsequent years (Pribék and Gáborjányi, 1998). Stanley is an old American plum cultivar grown in Serbia since 1956. It is PPV tolerant (Rankovic, 1986). However, in some Serbian plum orchards of cv. Stanley, PPV symptoms have occurred recently on both the leaf and the fruit, resulting in shape deformities, size reduction and premature fruit drop. The main objective of the study was to determine the PPV effect on the growth dynamics in oneold-year shoots and fruits as well as on the fruit yield per tree and hectare in cv. Stanley. Materials and methods The commercial orchard of cv. Stanley grafted on Myrobalan rootstock is located in Prislonica (Cacak, Western Serbia). It was established at a 5 × 3 m spacing in 1994. The trial was conducted in 2006-2007. At the end of May 2004, five trees with four replications with clearly visible PPV symptoms (RT-PCR positive for PPV), and as many without visible symptoms (RT-PCR negative for PPV) were marked. Non-infected trees were also registered and checked by RT-PCR throughout the observation period. After the commencement of the growing season in 2005, upon reaching a length of 5 cm, 20 vegetative shoots in five replications were marked on each of the selected trees in order to monitor the dynamics of growth in length (cm). Fruit weight (g) was measured in a sample of 20 fruits per tree in five replications after the fruits reached the size of a</p><p id="Pg239">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 242 wheat grain. One-year-old shoots length (cm) and fruit weight (g) were measured every 10 days by ruler, vernier calipers and a Tehnica ET-1111 electric scale. An ACS system electronic scale was used to measure fruit yield per tree. Fruit harvest was followed by measurements of fruit yields per tree (kg) and hectare (t). Significant differences among treatments were analyzed by ANOVA using an LSD at P &lt; 0.05 (Statistica 6.0). Results and discussion One-year-old shoot and fruit growth The analysis of the dynamics of one-year-old shoot growth in length is given in Fig. 1a. Results suggested that the shoots of the virus-free trees had a more intensive growth compared to those of the infected ones. Until 5 May, no differences were found in the one-year-old shoot growth dynamics, whereas from mid-May to the end of the measurement (15 August), the difference in growth intensity was evident in one-yearold shoots of the virus-free trees.

Dynamics of one-year-old shoot growth in legth (a) and dynamics of fruit weight change (b) Whether originating from the infected or non-infected trees, they grew most intensively until 25 June, when their growth noticeably slowed down until 5 July and finally ceased. The data given in Table 1 suggest the one-year-old shoot length in infected and non-infected trees to be 36.74±0.109 cm and 44.27±0.323 cm, respectively. There are growth differences between the shoots of purely vegetative character and future bearing shoots. Namely, the former shoots grow long for two to three months, and the latter ones take shorter time. According to Prica (1977), short bearing shoots of Pozegaca, a cultivar highly susceptible to PPV, take 10-20 days to grow in length. The initial shoot growth and fruit growth stages coincide, both using the reserve nutrients that have remained after the previous growing season, and competitive relationship later develops between them, which was also confirmed by this study, regardless of whether the Stanley trees were infected (Fig. 1a). The vegetative growth of shoots in length was a slow process at first, which suddenly progressed faster, and slowed down again until it eventually ceased (Milosevic, 1997). The shoots of both infected and non-infected trees of cv. Stanley grew intensively till 25 June on average but their length remained unchanged thereafter, which suggested that it reached its maximum on the said date in both infected and non-infected trees (Table 1). The intensive length growth of cv. Stanley shoots terminated on 15 June or 10 days before the results of the present study,</p><p id="Pg240">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 243 the differences being due to internal and external factors (Paunović and Ogašanović, 1972). PPV does not significantly affect the growth and vigour of infected plum trees, but the more susceptible the cultivar, the greater the changes, particularly on the fruits (Kišpatić, 1987). However, in our study, the difference in one-year-old shoot length was significant at P &lt; 0.05. Table 1. Mean±SE of one-year-old shoot length, fruit weight and yield of cv.

Thereafter, until harvest performed on 25 August in the period 2006-2007, the fruits of the infected trees exhibited lower intensity of change in fruit weight. The differences between fruit weight in the infected (35.34±0.713 g) and non-infected trees (37.68±0.615 g) were significant at P &lt; 0.05 (Table 1). Plum fruits show a specific growth dynamics. There are three distinct stages of stone fruit growth – the rapid stage, the slow stage and the very rapid stage (Milosevic, 1997). As far as this is concerned, there are no differences between non-infected and infected fruits of cv. Stanley, the only exception being the less intensive dynamics of changes in dimensions of infected fruits (Fig. 1b). Jordovic and Janda (1963) showed that the fruits of susceptible plum cultivars (Pozegaca, Italian Prune), while they were still green, developed hollow depressions that enlarged as the fruit matured, as well as wrinkles that deformed the fruit form, consequently affecting the dynamics of change in the final fruit form. According to the stated authors, PPV infected fruits of cv. Stanley, which retained their normal form, but not the size. The lowest fruit size reduction was registered in cv. Stanley (1.0%). The results of our study show that the infected and non-infected fruits of cv. Stanley exhibited an almost identical dynamics of change in weight, the dynamics in infected fruits, however, showing lower intensity (Fig. 1b). The above dynamics induced differences in the final fruit weight of 6.21%. Christov (1947) conducted a thorough examination of the morphological changes in fruits of some plum cultivars and determined that the changes resulted in weight and size losses, as confirmed by the present study (Table 1). The above author also reported that the content of resinous substances in the infected fruits was twice the content in non-infected ones. The fruits of cv. Stanley follow a three-stage sigmoid curve growth pattern from fruit setting to maturity, the stages being the rapid, slow and very rapid one of different duration, depending on the cultivar, the second stage being the shortest, lasting 10-12 days (Milosevic, 1997), as confirmed by the results of our study. Yield The data in Table 1 show that the final fruit yield of non-infected trees was 16.5± kg or 20.62±0.357 t ha-1, that of the infected ones being 13.1±1.003 kg tree-1 or 16.37±0.269 t</p><p id="Pg241">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 244 ha -1 . The difference in the total yield per tree between the infected and non-infected trees was 3.4±0.098 kg or 4.25±0.436 t ha-1. The above indicates that the trees of Stanley showing PPV symptoms gave a 20.61% lower yield per tree and per hectare. The differences between the infected and non-infected trees were significant at P &lt; 0.05, being most likely due to the destructive effect of PPV on the yield of cv. Stanley in the our study, although Ranković (1986) reported cv. Stanley to be a tolerant cultivar under Serbian conditions. Pribék (2001) reported yield losses of 20-30% in PPVinfected plum trees. About 100 million stone fruit trees in Europe are currently infected, and susceptible cultivars can result in 80-100% yield losses (Kegler and Hartman, 1998). The results by Pribék and Gáborjányi (1998) could be given serious consideration in terms of the stress effect of PPV on the growth and yield of cv. Stanley. Conclusions PPV induced significant differences in one-year-old shoot length (17.00 %), fruit weight (6.21%) and yield per tree and unit area (20.61%) between infected and non-infected trees of cv. Stanley under the conditions of Cacak (Western Serbia). References Balla B. –Abonyi F. –Drén G. –Barkaszi I. –Holb I.: 2008. Effect of three storage methods on fruit decay and brown root of apple.

Laszlo CSEUZ – Janos PAUK – Csaba LANTOS – Istvánné KOVÁCS Cereal Research Non-profit Ltd.Co. – H-6726 Alsókikötı sor 9. Szeged, Hungary, Abstract: Drought tolerance of wheat was tested by a mobile automatic rain shelter (MARS) in a conventional pedigree breeding program of Cereal Research Non-Profit Ltd. Co. (CRC) in Szeged. The MARS, parallel with ideal water supply gives a good chance for field testing of relatively high number of genotypes for drought tolerance. Using the automatic rain shelter which was installed in 2006, advanced lines of winter wheat could be tested for tolerance to water shortages under irrigated (control treatment) and under dry conditions. Withdrawal of water caused significant effects on yield and yield components and raised the canopy temperature of the genotypes tested. We have developed a novel breeding system by which we can routinely select for drought resistance. The methods applied can easily be incorporated into our working pedigree breeding system. Keywords: drought tolerance, wheat, breeding Introduction In all over the world the capacity of crop production highly depends on the availability of water. Climatic changes and deforestation accelerate the process of desertification and persistent water deficits may generate tragic consequences in different parts of the world. Even in Europe the shortage of water is the most important abiotic stressor in plant growing. One of the possible defences against drought is breeding for drought tolerance. Under our conditions the goal is to produce genotypes, which are resistant to drought in every developmental stage of their life cycle. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a quite stress tolerant species, but water deficiency may cause remarkable losses in grain yield and quality. Grain yield improvement under drought stress conditions must combine the high yield potential and specific factors, which are able to protect the crop against reductions due to water shortages. Although there are new sensing methods available (Tamás et al. 2007) drought stress can not be measured precisely in the field. Since the weather and natural water supply is changing year by year in Hungary, grain yield data are not suitable to judge the tolerance level of cultivated genotypes. The problem is even more complicated, because most drought tolerance mechanisms are in negative correlation with grain yield capacity. We have to evaluate the tolerance level of genotypes by means of inexpensive, fast but reliable testing methods, which can be applied in the field or even in laboratories and can be performed independently of the weather conditions. In this paper we demonstrate our efforts in this field. Materials and methods Our breeding system is a modified pedigree method, based on manual crossing, head selection from F2 generation until uniform head-rows are available. Generally from F4 generation information yields trials, later four-replicated yield trials, and at last multilocation performance tests help selecting the best ones among the advanced lines. From the generation of F5, quality tests and parallel scoring in rust (P. recondita, P. graminis) and virus nurseries (under provocative conditions) give additional information for the</p><p id="Pg243">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 246 successful selection. In the younger, segregating generations (F3-F5) visual scoring of morphological and phenological characters is the only effective method to evaluate the drought tolerance of large number of genotypes (10000-20000 accessions per year). The most important traits that may be checked visually are: leaf firing, leaf rolling, leaf color under serious stress, the hairiness or glaucosity of the leaves, kernel size and healthiness. Fast seedling emergence, rapid phenological development in spring, earliness in heading, anthesis and maturity are also advantageous parameters when the goal is drought tolerance. For testing drought tolerance per se in the field, mobile automatic rain shelter (MARS) was constructed and installed in the nursery of CRC in Szeged (fig.1.). Figure 1. The automatic rain shade MARS covers a 720 square meter area. Rain sensors set the closing mechanism which completely covers the field plots by a convertible plastic tunnel. Drain ditches prevent the side-wetting from the neighboring soil profiles. Drought can be traced by two automatic meteorological stations which continuously measure the rainfall, sun radiation dew point, soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, wind direction and speed. 85 winter wheat genotypes have been tested on two-row plots in three replications in the 2007/2008 wheat year. Most of the tested genotypes were the advanced breeding lines of the Cereal Research Non-Profit Co., and check varieties. All the genotypes were planted in two-row plots in 3 replications by a Wintersteiger Seedmatic sowing machine in October, 2007. Plot size was 0,5 m 2 . The effects of drought were evaluated by measuring plant height, acceleration in heading time, depression of the yield components, grain yield and the difference between the canopy temperatures of stressed/control plots of the different genotypes. The later method has been considered to be effective in screening wheat genotypes for drought tolerance (Blum, 1988, Inagaki and Nachit, 2008, Matuz et al. 2008, Winter, 1988) since tolerant genotypes can maintain photosynthesis (and evaporation) longer (Winter et al. 1988)</p><p id="Pg244">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 247 and their canopy temperature is lower. Canopy temperature was determined by infrared thermometer (Crop Trak, Spectrum Technologies Inc.). Results and discussion The effect of water withdrawal (under MARS) caused significant differences on plant height and thousand kernel mass, and significantly decreased grain yield and changed heading time and canopy temperature. Among the tested genotypes plant height was 89,4 cm in the treated (shaded) and 94,5 cm in the control treatment. Water shortage decreased plant height by 5,1 cm which means a 5,4 % depression. Tolerant genotypes’ depression in growth was more moderate than susceptible ones’. Water stress also affected heading time. Mean of heading time was 137,7 days after the first of January (17th of May) in the control treatment while it happened on the 12th of May in the stress treatment. Here heading accelerated, and on the average of the tested genotypes heading time started earlier by 5,8 days, which means a 4,2 % shorter time from the beginning of the year. On the average of the 85 genotypes tested, grain yield decreased by 36,8 %, while thousand kernel mass (TKM) decreased by 7,8 %. The two-row plots’ average grain yield was 394 g in the irrigated, and 249 g in the stress treatment, which means a 36,8 % depression. Only about 22 % of grain yield loss could be explained by TKM depression. The rest of the yield depression could be happen due to the less number of fertile and productive spikes. The higher number of secondary spikes also decreased the difference of TKM between the two treatments. Table 1.

Air temperature was 34 ºC and 30 ºC during the measurements. Canopy temperature was 22,7 ºC and 19,1 ºC on the average of the control plots and 27,9 and 24,2 in the treated (stressed) treatments. Generally the results of drought stress trials has no correlation to yield data. The best correlation with MARS data were found with grain yield (r = 0,628 - 0,836*** ). Conclusions Rain shelter is an appropriate device to generate drought stress in the field. However selecting for drought tolerance even using this equipment is a difficult project. Under</p><p id="Pg245">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 248 our conditions following the coldest months the withdrawal of water must be started as soon as possible (not later than in February), otherwise the sufficient seriousness of drought stress could not be achieved. Comparing the canopy temperature of the control and stressed wheat plots is a very fast screening method, by which single measurements can be made within a few seconds. Even hundreds of genotypes can be measured easily. However, the results can be affected by numerous factors such as wind, moving clouds, the angle of the equipment, the density of the canopy etc. so the results must be based on replicated measurements and a competent number of control measurements (on check genotypes). The mentioned selection methods are applied in our conventional winter wheat breeding program. All these tests can only be additional methods in the breeding procedure besides visual scoring of morphological and phenological traits. Also, important information can be obtained from the multi-location yield trials especially at drier locations and/or in drier years. Significant improvement in drought tolerance of future wheat varieties can only be achieved by the combination of all these data. The advance in drought tolerance can be found among our latest registered wheat varieties and numerous new winter wheat candidates with a higher level of adaptability to dry environments. Bread wheat varieties: GK Jászság (1999), GK Szálka (2000), GK Ati, (2001), GK Csongrád (2001) GK Békés (2005) GK Csillag (2005) GK Hunyad (2005) are reputed tolerant to water shortages, and performed very well under stress conditions, too.

Our goal is to size up the possibility of the homogenization of the quality of wheat on compound soil. The results of the first year have shown a significant correlation between the quality of wheat and the phosphorus contents of the soil of the plot. For the sake of the yield of the second year potash and phosphorus fertilizer was distributed by precision technology in the course of autumn nutrient supply. The extraordinary vintage had a strong effect on crop quality this year as well as in the first. The quantitative data were acceptable but certain quality parameters were reduced to the level of forage wheat due to the heavy rainfall right before harvest time which also delayed harvesting. Keywords: precision plant growing, crop quality, crop quantity, compoundness Introduction Winter wheat is the most important field crop in the world and in Hungary as well. According to Sárvári (2006) the quantity of wheat grown in Hungary is satisfactory, it is, therefore, not the quantity but the quality of wheat crop which needs to be improved.- This cannot be realized without being aware of the ecological, biological and agrotechnical factors and their interactions. Due to Harmati (1987) the nutrient supply plays a significant role in the growth and development of winter wheat. Nutrient supply is the agro-technical factor most apt for improving the yield and the quality of wheat. Ragasits states based on the results of long term experiments that nutrient economy based on soil analysis and on the cognition of ecological makings is the vital condition of economic wheat growing. Plants need balanced nutrition for normal growth and good health. Crops that grow in a good quality soil and have balanced nutrient supply yield better, because nutrient balance results in increased nutrient and water use efficiency by plants. (Kádár 2007). Phosphorous plays a determinative role in the development of wheat grain due to its physiological significance. Phosphorous accumulation increases in the vegetative phase, grows in spots till the milky ripening in the generative phase and the state of component loss is to be observed afterwards. The period of rapid accumulation is to be experienced between the fenophase of shooting and ear emergence independent from production area. By harvesting at the end of the vegetation the major part of accumulated phosphorous is infiltrated into the seed grain a smaller proportion of it is to be found in the vegetative parts. (Lastity 2006) On the basis of the results obtained effects of different treatments on seed quantity and quality were determined. Form the results it could be concluded that the various circumstances had effects on different quality parameters depending on the crop year and the variety used. Seed quality and quantity values proved to be variety specific. Further examinations are needed to evaluate crop year effects on the parameters studied. (Klupács et al. 2008) The presence and availability of N during the first half of wheat development has a decisive influence on the development of the generative organs and thus on the grain yield (Varga et al.,</p><p id="Pg247">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 250 2007). According to Jolánkai – Németh (2002) the aim of precision plant production is to adapt the production technology more precisely to the conditions prevailing in the production area. The survey of inhomogenity within the basic ecological unit of production the production plot and the demand of biological, productional and technological accommodation to it has an age-long history. Czinege et al. (2000) identify the spatial identification of the pattern of characteristics within the plot as the philosophical key issue of precision farming. Agro-technical tasks can be determined on this basis which can be connected to agro-ecological features and at the same time to the dynamically changing cultural state as well. Materials and methods The experiment took place in Gyöngyöspata 12 km from Gyöngyös. The soil type of the experimental area is brown forest soil which shows great diversity even within the plot regarding nutrient supplying ability as well as microclimate or relief. The experiment was set within the framework of large-scale farming by the filed splitting method. A 50 ha area was allocated on the plot as experimental area. By selecting the variety our aim was to choose a variety growing securely in the given production area. The variety surveyed was the Mv Magdaléna characterized by its heritably high gluten contents and the high average yield which can reach 7,0-7,5 t ha -1 under favourable conditions. Its high falling number stability contributes to quality preservation even if the weather is rainy at the harvesting period. Preparation works of the experiment were done in the first year the contours of parcels were drawn up by GPS and soil analysis was carried out on the basis of which the nutrient content maps of the territory were prepared. The bottleneck among the nutrients was the phosphorous provision as there was a significant heterogeneity regarding this nutrient as on certain parts of the parcel only clues of it were to be found. In the first year samples were taken at certain GPS coordinates and the quality resp. the deviation of the quality of the yield was surveyed for the preparation of a yield map. The 2007 samples showed a significant coherence between the quantity of the crop and the phosphorous content of the soil. In autumn 2007 traditional nutrients delivery was applied on one part of the parcel while the P quantity suggested by the computer programme was delivered by precision technology on the other. When harvesting in 2008 knowing the GPS coordinates we returned to the sampling points of the previous year and took samples repeatedly. Surveying the deviation of the quantity and quality parameters of the two years we were eager to know how the deviation of the quantity and quality parameters of the crop are affected by phosphorous fertilizer delivered by precision method at the same point. Results and discussion Neither the year 2008 nor 2007 can be considered a standard vintage. Though the quantity of rainfall in the vegetation period did not exceed 514,5 mm, but 138 mm of it in July, right before harvesting. This fact affected the crop quality heavily. On the basis of the average yield one can come to the conclusion that the distribution of rainfall was more favourable in 2008, as the average yield was 4,55 t ha -1 which means a</p><p id="Pg248">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 251 remarkable increase compared to the 3,28 t ha -1 figure of 2007. Surveying the deviation we stated that the deviation of the average yield did not supportably increase. Nearly all the quality parameters of the year 2008 showed a significant decrease compared to same of 2007 which was a mainly dry vintage. (Table 1.) Table 1.

The handling did not decrease the heterogeneity of crop quantity within parcel. Comparing the data of relative deviation after handling of the two years it can be stated that the parcel shows a notable heterogeneity regarding protein quantity in both years. The percentage of gluten and protein became more homogeneous in the second year. The relative deviation of the percentage of protein decreased from 6,07 to 3,99 while that of the gluten from 7,00 to 4,33 in case of samples taken from the same points. F-probe was applied for the analysis of crop and protein data. The average crop and protein data did not exceed the Fcrit 5%. The gluten and the protein exceeded the Fcrit 1%, the moisture content of the crop the Fcrit 0,5%.</p><p id="Pg249">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 252 Conclusions On the surveyed territory we have expected similar or smaller deviations besides the increase, stagnation or decrease of the average of different parameters. The percentage of protein decreased to 14,01 from 17,44 besides the certifiable decrease of deviation. The average protein quantity and its deviation did not change significantly. The average gluten percentage decreased by 18% - from 36,77 to 30,24 – compared to the results of 2007 but a significant decrease of deviation was also to be observed. Regarding moisture contents the results of the year 2008 were more favourable than those of the previous year in spite of the hugh quantity of rainfall right before harvesting which had a negative effect on the quality. On the basis of the results of the second year of the experiment it can be stated that the quantity and quality parameters of the crop can be strongly affected by the vintage effect. After applying precision phosphorous nutrient delivery a significant decrease of deviation was experienced in case of more quality parameters at points determined by GPS coordinates. Though the results of the survey are based on the data of two years only and the evaluation and analysis of the data of several years would be needed to verify the conclusion that the precision nutrient delivery makes it possible to homogenize the crop quality within parcel. The survey of more and more quality parameters and the expansion of the information gathered about the parcel and its agro-ecological environment are suggested in order to come to this conclusion.

IN DIFFERENT CROP ROTATIONS Attila VAD – Lajos Fülöp DÓKA Research Institute and Model Farm, Agronomy Faculty, University of Debrecen H-4032 Debrecen, Böszörményi út138, e-mail: doka@agr.unideb.hu, vadattila@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Effects of crop-rotation, fertilization and irrigation on the yield of maize has been studied in different cropyears characterized by different water supply (2007 year=dry; 2008 year=optimum) on chernozem soil. Our scientific results proved that in water stress cropyear (2007) the maximum yields of maize were 4316 kg ha-1 (monoculture), 7706 kg ha-1 (biculture), 7998 kg ha-1 (triculture) in non irrigated circumstances and 8586 kg ha-1, 10 970 kg ha-1, 10 679 kg ha-1 in irrigated treatment, respectively. In dry cropyear (2007) the yield-surpluses of irrigation were 4270 kg ha-1 (mono), 3264 kg ha-1 (bi), 2681 kg ha-1 (tri), respectively. In optimum water supply cropyear (2008) the maximum yields of maize were 13 72913 787 (mono), 14 137-14 152 kg ha-1 (bi), 13 987-14 180 kg ha-1 (tri) so there was no crop-rotation effect. In water stress cropyear (2007) fertilization caused yield depression in non irrigated treatment (control=2685 kg ha-1; N240+PK=2487 kg ha -1). Our scientific results proved that the effects of abiotic stress could be strongly reduced by using the optimum crop models in maize production. We obtained 8,6-11,0 t ha-1 maximum yields of maize in water stress cropyear and 13,7-14,2 t ha-1 in optimum cropyear on chernozem soil with using appropriate agrotechnical elements. Keywords: maize, abiotic stress, cropyear, yield Introduction Maize is an important grain crop both in Hungary and in the World. In Hungary, maize is produced on 1.1- 1.2 million ha (25% of the arable land) and the yields range between 4 and 7 t ha -1 depending on the cropyear and the applied agrotechnical methods. The yield of maize is significantly changes on farm and plot level as well, which shows the high sensitivity of the plant for ecologic and agrotechnical factors (PEPÓ et al. 2006). Fertilization, genetics, crop protection, plant density and irrigation as production technology factors play important role in the determination of maize yields (GYİRFFY 1976, NAGY 1996, SÁRVÁRI and SZABÓ 1998, PEPÓ 2001). To some extent, the negative influence of climatic factors can be reduced by appropriate hybrid selection (SÁRVÁRI 1995, PEPÓ et al. 2007) and by appropriate agrotechnical management. Nutrient and water supply are determining agrotechnical factors. Maize needs harmonized NPK fertilization; however, out of macroelements nitrogen has significant importance (BERZSENYI 1993, LIANG and MAC KENZIE 1994, KOVAČEVIC et al. 2006, IZSÁKI 2007). In dry years the role of irrigation is especially significant in ensuring high yields of maize (RUZSÁNYI 1990, PEPÓ et al. 2008). Materials and methods The long-term experiment was set up in 1983 on chernozem soil in the Hajdúság (Eastern Hungary) by Prof. László Ruzsányi. The multifactorial experiment has been managed by Prof. Péter Pepó since 2004. Regarding the physical characteristics of the soil, the area can be classified as loam and has a nearly neutral pH value (pHKCl=6.46). It has a medium-level humus content (2.8 %) and a humus depth of about 80 cm. Its supply of phosphorous is medium and its supply of potassium can be considered good. The structure of the multifactorial experiment is as follows:</p><p id="Pg251">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 254 - crop rotation: monoculture (maize), biculture (wheat-maize), triculture (peaswheat-maize) - fertilization: control, one-, two-, three- and fourfold amounts of the basic dosage of N=60 kg ha -1 , P2O5=45 kg ha -1 , K2O=45 kg ha -1 - irrigation: not irrigated and irrigated During the vegetation period of 2007, irrigation was applied 4x50 mm (200 mm) in the irrigated treatment (between early May and late June). In 2008 year we did not applied irrigation. Against Diabrotica virgifera in 2007 year we used soil desinfection in monoculture (Force 1,5 G 14 kg ha -1 ) and sprayed in mono-, bi- and triculture (17 July, Karate Zeon 0,3 l ha -1 ) and in 2008 year we applied soil desinfection (Force 1,5 G 14 kg ha -1 ) in mono- and biculture but there was no spraying in the vegetation period. We applied 60.000 ha -1 plant density in 2007 and 2008 years in all crop rotations. The other agrotechnical elements met the requirements set by modern maize production. The hybrid Reseda (PR 37 M 81) was used in our long-term experiments. Table 1 contains the 30 year average of the most important meteorological parameters (rainfall, temperature) and these parameters in the cropyears of 2007 and 2008. Table 1.

In the dry cropyear of 2007, in natural circumstances (if no irrigation was applied) the yields of maize ranged between 26854316 kg ha -1 yields in monoculture, 6258-7706 kg ha -1 in biculture and 6716-7998 kg ha -1 in triculture. In years with favourable climatic conditions the yields difference among the different crop rotation systems was minimal and not significant. In 2008 no irrigation was necessary. The yields of maize ranged between 9154-13 787 kg ha -1 (nonirrigated) and 8830-13 729 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in monoculture, 11 613-14 137 kg ha -1 (non-irrigated) and 12 314-14 152 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in biculture, and 11 291-13 987 kg ha -1 (non-irrigated) and 10 874-14 180 kg ha -1 (irrigated) in triculture. In dry cropyear (2007) the yield increase generated by irrigation was modified partly by crop rotation and partly by nutrient supplementation. The yield-increasing effect of irrigation only prevailed if sufficient nutrient supply was provided, i.e. there is close correlation between the nutrient and water supply (Figure 1). In the control treatment in 2007 the yield surpluses of irrigation ranged between 1436-2525 kg ha -1 , in the optimal fertilization treatment it ranged between 2681-4270 kg ha -1 .</p><p id="Pg252">VIII.

Effects of irrigation on the yield surpluses of maize (Debrecen, 2007-2008, chernozem soil) The appropriate nutrient supply of maize is highly important in the decreasing of unfavourable abiotic stress (weather) and in the realizing of yield increasing effect of optimal water supply. Our results prove that in dry year (2007) the yield increasing effect of fertilization was lower than in humid year (2008). In dry year compared to the control treatment fertilization caused only moderate yield increase (1282-1631 kg ha -1 according to the crop rotation system) in non-irrigated circumstances. In treatments where irrigation was applied the yield increasing effect of fertilization was significantly higher, almost twice compared with the non-irrigated treatment. In humid year (2008) the yield increase generated by fertilization was determined by the crop rotation system.</p><p id="Pg253">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 256 In dry year (2007) in non-irrigated circumstances the fertilization dose exceeding the agronomic optimum of maize (N240+PK) decreased the yields compared to the optimal treatment, furthermore, in extreme water conditions the yields were lower than in the control treatment (control treatment in monoculture: 2685 kg ha -1 , in the N240+PK treatment: 2487 kg ha -1 , in triculture were: 6716 kg ha -1 , 6630 kg ha -1 yield, respectively). Conclusions In draughty cropyear the maximum yield increase caused by irrigation was 4270 kg ha -1 (monoculture), 3264 kg ha -1 (biculture) and 2681 kg ha -1 (triculture). In dry cropyear there was strong interaction between water and nutrient supply. The yield surpluses of maize were significantly lower in the control treatment (1436-2525 kg ha -1 ) than in the optimal NPK treatment (2681-4270 kg ha -1 ). The yield increasing effect of fertilization was primarily influenced by the cropyear and modified by crop rotation and irrigation. In dry cropyear the yield increase over the control was 1282-1631 kg ha -1 (nonirrigated) and 2527-3376 kg ha -1 (irrigated). In favourable year the yield increase was highest in monoculture (4633-4899 kg ha -1 ) but it was high in biculture (1838-2524 kg ha -1 ) and in triculture (2696-3306 kg ha -1 ) as well, respectively. The scientific results of our long-term experiments proved that applying appropriate agrotechnical elements the abiotic stress effects caused by weather can be moderated but cannot be eliminated.

In real conditions, biosystems are widely influenced by different factors that are hard or unpossible to manipulate . For example the cropyear effects are such factors that consist of two important parts: the temperature and precipitation. The author has investigated the geometric and agro-physical parameters of wheat kernel sampled from four different years. The width of kernel varied year by year but there was no significant difference between dry and moist years. The effect of a dry year caused notable difference for the length and thickness. The kernel length was significantly smaller in the year of drought and at the same time the thickness increased. Keywords: wheat, kernel size, kernel shape, hardness, Introduction The aim of growing cereals is to supply food industry and animal feed. Wheat is the most valuable crop, its production is the biggest. It is used in various forms of milling products: among others bread is made from that. It is a world trade product, so not only the growing conditions (weather, insect, etc.) determine it, but the market conditions, too. The reason of the wide spread is the good adaptability. It grows everywhere in the World within the tropical, desert and the polar region. The weather conditions determine both the quantity and the quality (FÓNAD et al 2008). In Hungary, the weather is changeable; and thus there is an extreme effect of rain and temperature. When the wheat has better quality properties the effect of the weather is less as reported PEPÓ and GYİRI (1997). KUTASY (2002) examined different wheat varieties from different season. He determined that from the investigated 26 different samples the quality of 9 varieties was stable in every year. In his study the wheat quality was determined by the genetical conditions, the growing and agro technology. The kernel size and shape are the common behaviour of the wheat and for both of them good measuring techniques are available. It is important parameter as showed by MORGAN et al.(2000), and TROCCOLI and di FONZO (1999). In all operation of milling technology kernel size has a significant role, thus it is important to be aware of it. As well, in the planning of the agricultural machines it is needed to have the information about the size of the kernel (POLYÁK, N.I., 2001). Materials and methods In this study we tested the varieties of Cereal Research Ltd. Szeged from 1999 to 2002. The samples were harvested from three different plots. Mustard was the plant in Kecskéstelep and Bemutató plot, the fertilizer was N/P/K, 75 kg/hectare. In the Öthalom plot, there was pea plant in 2000 and 2002, and corn in 2001. The fertilizer was 45-45 kg/hectare after pea and 150 kg nitrogen and 75-75 kg phosphorus and potassium after corn.</p><p id="Pg255">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

This was the reason that there wasn’t a product short fall and the quality was good in that droughty years (2000). The Table 1. has shown the different weather parameters according to different year.

The caliper has 0,01 mm disassembly and 0,03 mm precision. To determine the error of method of the kernel size measurement, we provided control measure using 100-100 kernels. The reproducibility of the method was analysed and the standard deviation determined which is a margin of error. The Hardness Index (HI) was measured by SKCS 4100 (PERTEN INSTRUMENTS, INC.). The statistical analysis has been carried out the investigate the effect of the year of cultivation on the size and kernel hardness index using Statistica for Windows.

Although the length size was two times that of the width size but there was no significant correlation between these parameters. There is a middle correlation between the width and thickness, the ratio is 1.16. The determination coefficient is lower (R 2 =0,3131), thus the relationship is rather deterministic than significant. The size is influenced by the genetical behaviour of the variety and the conditions of the growing. The ANOVA shows that the effect of year is very strong parameter for the kernel size (Figure 1.). Thickness size Lenght size Width size Figure 1. Kernel size according to harvested year 1999-2002 (n=278) The weather conditions of the different cultivation year determine the length and the thickness parameter. In the drier and drought warm year (2000 and 2002) the kernels were shorter and more thick. The width parameter did not show the same trend, except in year 1999. The milling technology requires knowing the kernel size, so it is indispensable. They have to know the kernel size and its distribution to the riddle. It is more important if it is an export wheat, because it needs a homogenous mass, it is requirement. Figure 2 show that the year of cultivation effected the kernel hardness. There is a significant difference among the four growing years, so the hardness depend on the weather conditions. In Figure 2, the statistical analysis of the HI is displayed with a confidental interval of 0.95?. It is noticeable that the HI was much lower in year 1999 when the amount of rain was the largest. In years 2000 and 2002, when the was a</p><p id="Pg257">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 260 droughty years, the HI was highest. The possible reason for the good quality of the wheat from year 2000 was the high amount of rainfall in the previous 1999 year.

The hardness index (HI:%) values according to harvested year (n=173) Conclusions There was no connection among the geometrical behaviour of the wheat kernel parameters. The parameters are independent, but there is a connection with the agro physical behaviours. The nearest connection is between the width and the thickness. The wheat kernel size is determined by genetical pattern and the condition of the growing. The year effect and the place of plot have a great impact. There was dry and warm in the examined years of 2000 and 2002, the amount of the rain was essential less, than the average. The width size varied, but there was no significant difference between the dry (2000) and the rainy year (2001). The droughty weather has significant effect to the length and the thickness size. The length size was shorter but the thickness size increased. So the axes were changed and it caused the increase of the sphericity. This relationship was examined and determined by the sphericity examination.

According to the requirements of sustainable agriculture the plant-cultivation applies adequate tools and matters in the given environmental capability beside the environmental protection in such a manner that it would give a profit for the agriculture. Application of chemicals, such as fertilizers may cause some problem for the environment. Abiotic stress, such as toxic elements, unconformable nutrient supply, may affect the operation of photosynthetic mechanisms. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters make it possible to evaluate the plant's photosynthetic performance and the extent of its tolerance to environmental stress. The aim of work was to investigate the relationship between different nutrient supply and some chlorophyll-fluorescence parameters in the case of corn and sunflower. Plants were grown in hydroponic condition applying different nutrient solutions, and the parameters of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were detected with a PAM-2001 modulated light fluorometer. Sensibility of fluorescence parameters were different in altered amount and type of nutrient solution. Relative fluorescence decrease (RFD), as a vitality index of stress response was also calculated in the case of all treatments and plants. Keywords: chlorophyll-fluorescence, plant nutrition Introduction Chlorophyll fluorescence has been routinely used for many years to monitor the photosynthetic performance of intact plants and algae (Janda 1998; Antal and Rubin 2008; Elster et al., 2008; Solti et al., 2008). Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements could be used to estimate rapidly the operating quantum efficiency of electron transport through PSII in leaves and this PSII operating efficiency was related to CO2 assimilation (Genty et al., 1989). There are several aspects and parameters of the chlorophyll fluorescence, which can be used for stress detection. Excess of excitation energy can be de-excited by thermal dissipation processes. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence is an indicative of the level of nonradiative energy dissipation in the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem II. The importance of the non-photochemical quenching results from the fact that it shows that the level of excitation energy in the PSII antenna can be regulated. This is thought to prevent over-reduction of the electron transfer chain and, therefore, provides protection from photodamage. Non-photochemical quenching is induced under conditions when the photosynthetic apparatus cannot use the total of absorbed light energy for photochemistry. Stress conditions markedly promote NPQ, therefore the amount of NPQ is an indicator of the stress severity (Schreiber et al., 1986). Fluorescence decrease ratio (RFD) values as a vitality index also provides very much useful information on the physiological state of photosynthesis and has been applied with great success as stress detection (Lichtenthaler and Rinderle 1998). Fluorescence studies have been applied to investigate the effects of major abiotic stresses on photosynthesis during crop production and to identify cultivars that are tolerant. Changes in the status of many nutrients in leaves also have an effect on fluorescence characteristics (Kastori et al., 2000), but there is no has sufficient knowledge in this topic.</p><p id="Pg259">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 262 Materials and methods The seeds of corn (Zea mays, L cv. Norma sc.) and sunflower (Helianthus annus L. cv Arena PR) were grown on different nutrient solutions under controlled laboratory conditions. Three different nutrient contents were applied. First of all, complete nutrient solution (totalns) is contains 2.0 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.7 mM K2SO4, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM KCl, 1 µM H3BO3, 1 µM MnSO4, 1 µM ZnSO4, 0.25 µM CuSO4, 0.01 µM (NH4)6Mo7O24, 10 -4 M FeEDTA. In the second applied nutrient solution (1/2ns) was the 50% diluted variant of complete nutrient solution. Thirdly, only distilled water (dw) was used. Parallel of these treatments plant growth promoting bacteria containing biofertilizer (Phylazonit MC®) was added to the solutions (1ml l-1) on the 1 st day of experiments. Phylazonit MC® is a viscous solution containing Azotobacter chroococcum and Bacillus megatherium, these microorganisms help nitrogen and other elements uptake and mobilisation in the rhizosphere. Measurements were carried out on 8days old seedlings. The parameters of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were detected with a PAM-2001 (Walz,Germany) modulated light fluorometer as described by Schreiber et al. (1986). Samples were dark-adapted for 30 minutes. After dark adaptation, the initial fluorescence (Fo) was excited by weak light, the maximal fluorescence (Fm) was induced by white saturating flash (fast phase of chlorophyll fluorescence). After that, the slow phase of chlorophyll fluorescence induction was detected under 200 µmol m-2s1 light intensity for 5 minutes with the saturation pulse method, which allows the analysis of photochemical (qP=(Fm’-Ft)/(Fm’-Ft)), non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (NPQ=(Fm-Fm’)/Fm’ processes, relative fluorescence decrease ratio (RFD) values. Results and discussion The abiotic stress factors such as cold, heat, wrong nutrient supply has an unfavourable direct or/and indirect impact on all living organisms (Mészáros 1994; Vinkovics et al., 2007). The quantity and quality of nutrients can influence soil life, the physiology of plant and thereby the lives of other organisms (Précsényi and Mészáros 1999). Too much chemicals cause environmental pollution, but in our days any activity or method that aims at the moderation of environmental pollution has and will have a major role in our lives (Várallyay 2007, Kádár 2008). Bio-fertilizers containing plant growth promoting bacteria and less chemical compounds. These useful microorganisms facilitate nutrient uptake for plants, enhance the decomposition and mobility of nutrients, and directly increase the volume of nutrient utilization. The nutrients availability can operate the activity of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence method is applicable to detect changes in CO2 assimilation (Genty et al., 1989). The results of Table 1 and 2 show values of qP/qN and non-photochemial quenching (NPQ) in correlations with nutrient contents and applicance of biofertilizer. The ratio of qP/qN was the highest in the case of the lowest nutrient level both in corn and sunflower. The value of qP was remained invariable, but qN was increased parallel with</p><p id="Pg260">VIII.

The NPQ values are also increased with the level of higher nutrient content in both investigated plants. Table 1.

The RFD is a measure of the potential photosynthetic capacity of a leaf. The values of RFD steadily decline with increasing stress from 3-5 via values of 1-2 to values far below 1 which indicate irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Lichtenthaler and Rinderle, 1998). Although the RFD values were lower in the case of corn, but it does not sign stress situation. The RFD values were higher in sunflower by 20-25 percentages. The differences between the values of plants perhaps originate from the dissimilar composition of plant tissues. The corn has more schlerophyll leaves, which can modify fluorescence measurement, but there is no scientific evidence and literature to certify it. If biofertilizer was added to the nutrient solution there were not significant differences. Table 2.

In the laboratory the growing circumstances, eg. light intensity mainly does not perform similarly to field conditions. Moreover, the insufficient nutrient treatments may cause alterations during the relatively short time under laboratory conditions. The applied biofertilizer also had no effect on the measured parameters. Similar investigations are proposed under field conditions.</p><p id="Pg261">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Barr [syn: Endothia parasitica (Murr.) And.] fungus caused big damages of the chestnut stands throughout the World. In 1969, symptoms of the disease were reported first on chestnut in the Carpathian-Basin, in Hungary. Until 1998, the fungus was only detected on chestnut there. Then blight symptoms were also detected on some young sessile oak (Quercus petraea) trees in SouthTransdanubie (Hungary) and later in Slovakia. Main goals of our studies were field investigations of oaks in different regions of the Carpathian-Basin (in Romania, in Ukraine, in Slovakia and in Hungary) to detect the symptoms of the blight fungus. During our examinations, blight symptoms on oaks were identified on three Hungarian sites. Infected oak trees with bark necrosis were also found near Baia Mare, Romania and in Slovakia near Duchonka. Blighted oak trees were not yet found in Ukraine so far. Four fungal strains were identified from bark samples of infected oaks (EU-3, EU-16, EU-9 and EU-11) in Hungary. Only one strain (EU-2) was identified in the Slovakian site and also one fungal strain (EU-12) was identified in Romania from oak bark samples. Until now, C. parasitica have not caused so serious destruction on oaks as on chestnut trees in the Carpathian-basin, but it could be a more serious parasite for our forests in the future. Keywords: Cryphonectria parasitica, oak spp., Quercus petraea, blight symptoms Introduction Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr (syn: Endothia parasitica [Murr.] And.) is an important pathogenic fungus for Castanea species. At the beginning of the XX-th century, this pathogen killed almost the whole American chestnut (Castanea dentata) populations in the USA (Anagnostakis, 1987). In the middle of the last Century, it was reported in Europe too in an European chestnut (Castanea sativa) forest near Genova (Italy) (Biraghi, 1946), and it caused the "Chestnut blight" epidemia throughout the continent. In Europe, C. parasitica spread rapidly and heavily infected the chestnut stands. Then blight symptoms were detected in the Carpathian-Basin, including Hungary (Körtvély, 1970), Austria (Donaubauer, 1964), Slovakia (Juhasova, 1976), Romania (Florea and Popa, 1989) and Ukraine (Radócz, 2001). At the second half of the last Century, typical blight symptoms were observed on some oak trees in the USA (Torsello et al., 1994), in Switzerland (Bissegger and Heiniger, 1991) and in South-Italy (Dallavalle and Zambonelli, 1999). Until 1998, C. parasitica was only detected on Castanea sativa in Hungary. But later some young Quercus petrea trees were found in mixed chestnut-oak forests which showed typical blight symptoms in Zengıvárkony and in Kıszeg (Radócz and Holb, 2002) (Figure 1). Although the symptoms were not so serious on Quercus petraea than on Castanea sativa, it seems that Cryphonectria parasitica became a new serious pathogen for young oak trees in the Central-European region, mainly in heavily infected mixed chestnut-oak forests. Field investigations were done in several regions of the Carpathian-basin to examine oaks and to find blight symptoms. During the field works, bark samples were collected for laboratory examinations and identifications. Main goals of our studies were the followings: - investigation of damages caused by C. parasitica on oak trees, - isolation of the fungus from bark samples and study the fungal isolates in vitro.</p><p id="Pg263">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 266 Figure 1. Map of test sites in Central-Europe Materials and methods Field examinations were done in chestnut-oak mixed forests in different regions of the Carpathian-Basin in Romania, in Ukraine, in Slovakia and in Hungary. During the field works, all of the oak trees were investigated in the examined populations, or a samplefield. Bark samples for laboratory identifications and further examinations were collected from the infected trees with a disinfected sharp scalpel. PDA (potato-dextroseagar) media were used in the laboratory cultivations. Surface sterilized bark samples were cultivated on PDAmb media and the isolates were incubated for 7 days in a climated chamber. Then vegetative compatibility tests were done, when isolates were paired to study their compatibility. Finally, the pure cultures of the isolates were paired with EU-tester strains to classify their Vegetative Compatibility Groups (VCG-s). Those isolates which formed a visible barrage zone at the edge of the growing mycelia were classified into different VCGs. Results and discussion In 2004, field examinations were done in South-Hungary in several chestnut-oak mixed forests on the Mecsek-mountain and in Zala county. Chestnut trees were infected by the chestnut bligth fungus in the examined sites. Symptoms of the pathogen were found on sessile oak trees on three examined plots (Bakonya 16I., Iharos, Pogányszentpéter), but oak trees in the other examined populations (Bakonya 18A., Boda, Hetvehely) were healthy (Table 1). A test site with 150 oak trees were selected in the Bakonya 16I. area. All trees of the test site were checked yearly since that time, so 4 examinations were done on the signed oak trees of this test site until 2008. It was detected that more and more oak trees become infected year by year on the test site. Results of the yearly examinations are presented in Table 1. It was also detected that symptoms of the disease are becoming more and more serious on oak trees and the infection ratio (I%) was increasing year by year. Field examinations were done in North-West Romania between 2004 and 2006 near the town Baia Mare on five different chestnut populations mixed with oak trees (Baia Mare-Tautii de S., Baia Mare-Kıbánya, Baia Mare-Borpatak, Baia Mare-Veresvíz, Tautii Magheraus). It was detected that chestnut trees were heavely infected by Cryphonectria parasitica on all examined sites. On the other hand some infected young oak trees were detected on three examined Romanian plots (Table 1).

Canker and pycnidia on sessile oaks Figure 3. Blight symptoms on in Bakonya 16I test site (Hungary) sessile oak in Romania Conclusions Blight symptoms were identified on oaks in Hungary, in Romania and in Slovakia. It was confirmed by laboratory examinations. Until now C. parasitica have not caused so serious damages on oaks as on European chestnut trees in these countries, but potentially it could be a more serious parasite for our forests in the future. Summer drought which occured in 2003 and in 2006 may also have long-term affects for the forest condition by making the oak trees susceptible to abiotic and biotic stresses occuring in the growing seasons (Szıllısi et al., 2008).

In case of fertilizing, the major yield increasing nutrient is nitrogen, but phosphorus and potassium are also having a profound influence. Effects of extensive (without nutrient supply), medium (150 kgha-1) and large dose (300 kgha-1) intensive fertilizers on the botanical combination of meadows are compared in this study. As a summary it can be concluded, that the level of nutrient supply modifies grassland composition. Stress caused by the lack of nutrients will not only result in a decrease in the number of species, but also in the disappearance of valuable grass species from the area. In case of nutrient supplies, first-rate grassland components are going to remain on the area, but the numbers of other species are going to decrease in direct proportion due to the effects of the stress caused by the increasing dose of fertilizers. Keywords: extensive grassland management, intensive grassland management, nutrient supply, coenosys of grasslands Introduction Fertilization is a yield-increasing procedure, but its effects on botanical composition have also been proven by several experiments. According to Szemán (2007a), the number of grass species increases when nitrogen fertilizers are applied, but fertilization with the same amount of nitrogen each year stabilizes the composition of species. Applying a minimum of 100-150 kgha -1 N causes a considerable change in the number of species (Magyar et al. 2005, Tasi 2008). According to Bánszki (1991), nitrogen fertilizers promote the propagation of Dactylis glomerata L. and Bromus inermis Leyss., as these species prefer nitrogen. It has also been observed that leguminous species disappear from grasslands after large doses of nitrogen (100 kgha -1 ) are applied (Bánszki 1991, Szemán 2007a). Potassium and phosphorous provide favourable conditions for the spreading and survival of leguminous species (Szemán, 2007a; Vinczeffy ed., 1993; Barcsák, 2004). Both the lack of fertilizing as well as overdosing may cause stress in the plant community (Penksza et al. 2008). The degree of stress depends on the type of utilization and the aim of grassland management. The lack of nutrients, for instance, can not be considered a stress factor in case the aim of the management is sustaining a natural habitat (Szemán 2007b; Tasi 2007, Harcsa et al. 2008), and the decrease in the number of species caused by applying fertilizers in large doses can not be considered a stress effect on lawns either (Kulin et al. 2008). As a summary, we can conclude that the level of nutrient supply can modify the proportions of different grassland components in the grassland composition (Tasi, 2007; Kulin et al. 2008; Füleky, 2008). According to Bánszki (1991) in case of major changes in the nutrient level, the type of grasslands can also undergo transformation. In my article, I compare the effects of extensive (without nutrient supply), and intensive (150 kgha -1 and 300 kgha -1 fertilizers) grassland management methods on the botanical composition of natural meadows.</p><p id="Pg267">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 270 Materials and methods In the recent study, analysis of the effects of nutrient supply on natural grasslands in Kosd, a hilly area, and in Mátra, a mountainous area, in Hungary have been carried out in five years. Three kinds of treatments were applied at both sites on small plots: a 150 kgha -1 (N1) (with 50 kgha -1 P2O5 and 100 kgha -1 KCl) fertilizer and a 300 kgha -1 (N2) (with 100 kgha -1 P2O5 and 200 kgha -1 KCl) fertilizer were applied each year, while the third plot was left untreated as the control area (Ø)(0 kgha -1 N). The size of plots was 4x5 m, in randomised block design. The botanical survey was carried out through Balázs’s dominancy analysis (1949) at both sites on all plots four replications. The results presented in this article refer to the changes in cover rates and species’ composition comparing the initial (zero) year to the final year of the experiment. Results and discussion In the experiment in Kosd (1. table), throughout the five years of the experiment, a continuous degradation was experienced on the control plot. Succession processes could be identified on the natural grassland. The area got weedy because of the stress caused by the lack of nutrient supplies and treatment. The coverage and diversity of grass species showed a decreasing tendency. As a result of fertilizers, the coverage of grass species increased, the number of species became balanced, but their numbers were less than those in the control area. The coverage of other plant species were also increasing, but to a smaller extent. The number of weed species was smaller, than on the control areas. Applying a larger dosage of fertilizer, the number of plant species decreased considerably. Table 1.

Changes in number of species in Mátra C- control, N1- 150 kgha-1 , N2- 300 kgha-1 Values of Mátra’s area (2. table) showed similar results, as the grassland in Kosd. However, at first, in the control areas there was an increase in the cover rates of grass species; decrease only started in the third year of the experiment. The number of grass species in the control area was almost constant. The number and cover rate of leguminous species was also constant. The number and cover rates of weeds fluctuated; they decreased in the second and third years of the experiment, and showed an increasing tendency afterwards. This result was presumably caused by the different climate effects of the different years. As a result of fertilization, the botanical composition of Mátra’s natural grassland went through substantial changes. The coverage of grass species was increasing, while the number of species remained constant. Compared to the Kosd experiment, larger doses of nitrogen did not cause so large a change in the cover of grass species. As a result of nutrient supplies, legumes disappeared from the area. The number of dicotyledonous plant species (“other”) and their coverage also showed a major decrease, compared to the results of the control plot. Table 2.

The use of fertilizers increases the cover ratio of valuable grass species, while undesirable weed species can be eliminated from meadows. On the other hand, as an effect of the use of large dose nitrogen fertilizers, the number of species may show a major decrease. It can be concluded from the results, that leaving natural grasslands without any treatment leads to degradation because of the stress caused by the lack of nutrients. If natural grasslands are brought under cultivation, the botanical components of the meadow can be changed according to the aim of utilization by using the suitable amount of nutrient supplies. Still, it should always be considered carefully that the use of large doses of fertilizers results in a major decrease in the number of grassland species. References Balázs F.: 1949.

Hungary is eager to meet the criteria in the Kyoto protocol. The usage of biomass energy has the greatest potential in Hungary. According to these requirements plant production for energy purposes has been stressed lately. The Miscanthus is a kind of perennial grass containing a great amount of energy, which could be the most relevant plant for producing biomass in Hungary. The major cost in growing Miscanthus is planting. In our experiment the effect of soil moisture on the rhizome and plant propagated Miscanthus has been investigated under different planting times. Keywords: biomass energy, energy cane, rhizome, nurseling, drought stress Introduction The increase of the amount of greenhouse gases that cause the change of climate, the rising environmental pollution and the limited sources of fossil fuels make the World’s countries cooperate and use renewable energy sources in a wilder field (Reijnders 2006, Dobó et al. 2007). The increasing of the CO2 level of the air, and the average temperature, together with the more and more frequent occurrence of weather anomalies means a cumulative stress effect to the living being of the World, also to the human population. (NÉS). The agro-policy of the EU emphasises on the increase of usage of renewing energy sources. Bio energy offers sustainable resource to minimize current environmental, economical and social draw backs of fossil fuel (Percze et al. 2007). The huge energy import dependence and the big rate of fossil energy sources in energy production, that is more than 80% nowadays makes the situation of Hungary worse. (Gockler 1996, Csoknyai 2007), the rate of renewing energy sources is only 3-4% (Sulyok et al.2007, Csoknyai 2007), that sounds very low. The usage of biomass energy has the greatest potential in Hungary to change the usage rate of renewing energy sources (Csoknyai, 2007). According to this requirement plant production for energy purposes has been stressed lately. The Miscanthus is a kind of perennial grass containing a great amount of energy, which could be the most relevant plant for producing biomass in Hungary. Materials and methods It is a condition of the economical energy production from biomass to harvest the biggest amount of energy from point area. In the case of energy cane it can be expected from a 3 years old, well set plantation. The yield in this case is 10-20 tons per hectare if it is not irrigated. The yield is in important connection with the fallen moisture, on a field where the yearly amount of precipitation is less than 500 mm the cultivation is risky. The planting of the Mischantus should be done with rhizome and transplants, but</p><p id="Pg271">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 274 the last one is hard to purchase. This is why the propagation happens with rhizome. But after the spring planting the emergence is usually not equal, and the ten thousand emergence plants per hectare is also not typical. According to our experience, the nurseling 3 months after planting was 75-85% depending on the quality of the rhizome material. To achieve the expected plant number, a posterior planting is needed. In our experiment we examined the plant replacement with rhizomes and transplants. The date of the first planting was 2008. May 17 th , the second, provocation planting was on 2008. June 24 th , this one is the model of the posterior planting. We planted 20 plants in each plot. After this we examined the nurseling two times, on July, 22 nd , and on August, 13th, by counting the living plants. We measured the percentage of soil moisture five times (05.17., 06.11., 07.02., 07.22., 08.13.) with a PT-1 type hand instrument. We examined the activity of the lateral (axillar) buds of the Miscanthus in laboratory in a year period, on samples collected every three weeks. Part of the results of the exams can be seen on figure 2. The small and big plot examinations were set near Felsıpetény, in Nográd county. The water management of the soil is average, it is clayey brown forest soil. KA: 43, humus content is 1.5-1.9 %. Results and discussion We did the crop counting (nurseling) three times after the plantings. The results are on the Table 1. After the favourable Spring planting, more than 50% of the rhizomes are burgeoned in the small plot examination. Whilst we experienced that in the model plantation (06.24.) that modelled the posterior planting no plants were burgeoned from the 20 rhizomes. But the transplants that were planted in the second plantation were alive despite of the drought. The nurseling varied between 58-77% (Table 1) Table 1. Results of nurseling examination of Miscanthus sinensis (Felsıpetény, 2008) Rhizome (%) Nurseling (%) Date (crop counting) 05.17 06.24 06.24 2008.06.11 51 0 2008.07.22 51 0 77 2008.08.13 53 0 58 Lot of researcher determined that the activity of the rhizomes show seasonality. (Lukács-Hunyadi 1998, Lukács 2002). From the activity examination of the lateral buds of Miscanthus it was revealed that the activity of the buds is rising in June (Figure 1) so these were able to grow shoots. The late planted rhizomes did not push out, but because of other issues. According to the weather data of Felsıpetény, after the second planting there was a small amount of precipitation (22mm) within 3 weeks, but the temperature of the air was 30 C during the days (gray cells in Table 2). The soil moisture was very favourable at the time of the first planting, but this changed until the second planting.

Drought tolerance is a complex phenotypic trait that involves multiple physiological mechanisms that result of the expression of several protective genes and QTLs. We tried to compare reactions of five different barley genotypes exposed to drought stress with values of some physiological and molecular biological parameters that could describe different strategies of these genotypes for overcoming drought stress. Samples for evaluation of C13 isotope, endogenous ABA content and transcription activity of two dehydrine genes were collected during two weeks of drought conditions. A relation between level of drought sensitivity and gene expressions of two dehydrine genes were observed. Higher expression level of tested Dhn genes was detected in two more tolerant genotypes. Comparison of the results from all analyses enabled us described different drought adaptation mechanisms in cv. Tadmor and Malz. Keywords: Drought tolerance, Dhn genes, ABA , barley, carbon isotope discrimination Introduction The adaptation of plants to stress conditions is a very complex trait and it is influenced by many physiological and biochemical processes. The progress of breeding for drought tolerance depends on effectiveness of selection, which could be based on the evaluation of several these processes together, because the well adapted genotypes demonstrate more drought related mechanisms on different levels simultaneously (Cattivelli et al.2008). Important physiological parameters are connected with the water use efficiency, transpiration and photosynthesis. These factors can be indirectly evaluated by the carbon isotope discrimination. During photosynthesis plants discriminate against the heavy isotope of carbon ( 13 C) and the ratio is associated with transpiration efficiency and stomatal conductance (Farquhar and Richards, 1984). Other biochemical parameters are determined by ABA sensitivity and osmotic adjustment. ABA controls transpiration water loss by promoting stomatal closure and induces activation of the many stress activated genes (refer to Cattivelli et al. 2008) and it is often studied in relation with the rates of the photosynthesis and the transpiration (Stuchlíková et al. 2007). On molecular biological level, the activity of stress related genes and their transcript factors can be used for selection. The faster activation and higher level of expression is often connected with higher tolerance to abiotic stresses. In barley, expression of dehydrine genes Dhn1 and Dhn6 have been used for prediction of sensitivity level (Surprunova et al., 2004). The our work was aimed at the evaluation of the stress response of five barley cultivars with different level of drought tolerance. For evaluation, several physiological and molecular biological methods were applied with the purpose to cover more adaptation mechanisms simultaneously.</p><p id="Pg275">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 278 Materials and methods Five barley cutivars were selected for evaluation of drought sensitivity: Tadmor H.vulgare, spp. spontaneum, (TAD) from Syria, well drought adapted genotype, Czech spring cultivars Amulet (AMU), Bojos (BOJ) and Malz (MAL) and spring cultivar from Netherlands Jersey (JER) (Hordeum vulgare). The plants were grown in hydroponics in MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium. Two-week old seedlings were transferred into MS with PEG (0.3 MPa) to simulate drought conditions. The control plants were all-time cultivated in MS medium. Light and temperature were controlled (light 12/12 hours (day/night), 18/16 °C and after 14 days 20/18 °C). After 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then after 4, 7 and 14 days of cultivation in PEG, samples of yang leaves were collected for all planned analyses. Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg of leaf tissue using Ambion RNAqueous TM Kit and purificated by Turbo DNA free TM (Ambion). First-strand cDNA was prepared from 500 ng of total RNA using QuantiTect ® Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). Gene quantification was performed using Real time PCR (QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit, Qiagen). Reaction conditions of Dhn1 genes were the same as in Surprunova et al. (2004) In case of Dhn4, the new primers were designed (5'aagtgtaccggccaaaagaa3', 5' gtccctcatgggctggtaat 3' ) and reaction conditions were modificated: 2 min 50ºC, 15 min 95ºC, 40 x (15 s 94ºC, 30 s 56ºC, 30 s 72ºC). Transcription activity was evaluated as normalised relative expression calculated with real-time PCR efficiency correlation according to method of Pfaffl (2001).The changes in the activity of both genes normalised to α-tubulin and relative to the expression at optimal growth conditions (25°C) was calculated for each sample. Radioimmunological assay (RIA) of ABA endogenous level was done according Quarrie et al. (1988). 200 mg of leave tissues were collected and 50 µl of water extract were analysed. Leaf samples (the youngest leaves, 150mg) were ground to a fine powder and composite samples from three replicates was used for carbon isotope composition according (Farquhar et al. 1989). All analyses were done in triplicate and each value are characterised by means and standard deviation +/-SD. Results and discussion Tadmor (5.2% loss of water), Malz (7.4%), Amulet (22.5%), Bojos (30.3%) The tested cultivars could be sized according its water loss from leaves tissue during 14 days in drought conditions and the most sensitive Jersey (37%). During the experiment the activity of two Dhn genes was evaluated, one of them (Dhn4) is known as ABA regulated and the second one (Dhn1) is not (Fig. 1). High expression of both genes was detected in both tolerant cultivars, but their responses varied in timing, Malz reached the maximum activity after 7 days and Tadmor after 14 days. Faster activation of the Dhn genes in more sensitive barley cultivars was reported by Surprunová at al, (2004), but in case of our experiment Tadmor probably used different defence mechanisms, particularly in the earliest stages of stress induction. This suggestion corresponded with much lower level of endogenous ABA in Tadmor</p><p id="Pg276">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 279 compared with Malz (Fig. 2). In Malz, the high level of endogenous ABA was detected after 7 and 14 days of stress, together with high expression of Dhn genes. ABA level in Tadmor was 8 times lower than in Malz, but he expression of Dhn genes was only 3 times lower. Those findings confirm the fact, that due to its origin, cv. Tadmor is well adapted to arid conditions (Teulet et al. 2002). Figure 1. Evaluation of normalised relative expression (RE) Dhn1 and Dhn4 expression in drought condition (PEG -0.3 MPa). The ABA level was increasing during experiment in all tested cultivars and the highest concentration was detected in Malz, this fact corresponded with expressed level of drought tolerance of this cultivar, measured by other approaches. 0 200 400 600 800 TAD MAL AMU BOJ JER n g .g -1 F M 6 h 12 h 24 h 4d 7d 14d Figure 2.

The Malz reached the highest values ∆13C in control optimal conditions (data not shown) and at the beginning of drought stress action. But during prolonged drought condition, also Malz can improve the WUE (better then Jersey, similarly as Bojos but not so well as Amulet or Tadmor). Conclusions All tested methods were applicable for evaluation of stress sensitivity induced in our experiments. We were able to distinguish tested cultivars according their expressed sensitivity. The most sensitive cultivar was Jersey (ABA low level, low activity of both Dhn genes, the lowest level of WUE), the sensitivity of Amulet and Bojos were comparable but in some parameters (activity of Dhn1 and WUE) Amulet was better then Bojos. This fact corresponded with lower level of leave tissue desiccation during this experiment. The highest tolerance was found in cv. Malz and Tadmor. However, these two cultivars differed significantly in defence mechanisms against stress, Tadmor showed very low accumulation of ABA and the activations of gene expression in stress conditions were delayed in comparison to Malz, which reacted very intensively on stress (high levels of ABA and earlier activation of Dhn genes). Is it possible, that Tadmor adopts some other defence strategies (mainly in the first stage of stress), but the productivity of this cultivar selected from a Syrian landrace is much worse than that of modern high yielding cultivars as Malz, particularly in a favourable environment.

Co., Szeged, Alsókikötı sor 9. H-6726, Hungary, www. gabonakutato.hu, e-mail: fonadp@gk-szeged.hu Abstract: Many agronomical features of winter wheat have molecular markers which may accelerate the selection process significantly. However, the stability of yield or rheological parameters as polygenic attributes cannot be approached simply by the MAS (marker assisted selection) technique. The use of multilocation trials is a more practicable way and provides the first possibility to describe the adaptability of the advanced lines after their 6-8-year-long breeding procedures. In 2008, 57 wheat lines were tested in an experimental network at nine growing locations representatively. The abiotic and biotic stress factors like drought, nutrient deficiency, soil acidity or pathogen pressure affecting heavily these important agronomic parameters were different over locations. Yield, TKW (thousand kernel weight) were weighed, and wet gluten, protein content and hardness index of seed samples from each location were measured by NIR (nearinfrared) method on intact seeds. The data were evaluated by different statistical methods. Variance analyses, mainly the dispersion along the series of the location were an effective way to characterize the adaptability of wheat lines. Cluster analysis was efficient to identify the similarity of flexible lines or similar locations, respectively. The statistical quantity of the locations and their diverse growing conditions allowed to measure and predict the yielding stability of each wheat line related to their tolerance to different stress factors. The main goal of the rough quantity screening was similar and could make easy to identify genotypes with fluctuating parameters. This experimental network decisively contributed to register seven new candidate genotypes in the Hungarian state variety experiments in 2008. Keywords: field trial, adaptation Introduction The key of the high adaptability of GK (GabonaKutató Non-profit Kft = Cereal Research Non-profit Co.Ltd.) winter wheat varieties resides in screening them in a type of multi-location experiment fitted to our breeding system. Year by year, wheat genotypes are tested for yield potential, seed quality and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. On the different growing areas the experiments are performed by the same method. The experimental locations cover a lot of ecological diversity to make us able to exclude downsides (e.g. low frost tolerance or lodging tendency), or conversely, to select for favourable parameters (e.g. drought tolerance, stem strength, high adaptability to different growing conditions). By the help of this multi-location system, we can trace the physiological responses of potential candidates given to different growing conditions before their registration. This knowledge is indispensable to produce and maintain the genetic base of the wheat varieties together with introducing them into the market. Materials and methods At the F6-F8 population, multi-location yield tests were set up for testing the adaptability of advanced wheat lines. In 2008, the trials were executed in 11 locations under different conditions (diverse soil types, altitude, precipitation, lowest temperature in winter, high and low inputs, sowing time). At each location, 56 winter wheat and one durum wheat genotypes were tested together with three early, three medium and two late ripening check varieties.

The yield harvested from each plot was weighed and the TKM (thousand kernel mass) was calculated. Some of the most important quality parameters of the samples from each location like gluten and protein contents, hardness index were determined by Mininfra 2000T tester running with NIR (near-infrared) technique on intact seeds. To evaluate of the yield and quality data, different statistical methods were carried out like one factor variance analysis and correlation analysis, classification and clustering. Results and discussion The mean yield values dispersed between 3.53 and 4.62 t/ha. There was significant correlation among certain yield series along locations (e.g. Enying/Mezıkövesd, Öthalom/Fülöpszállás). Conversely, other pairs of yield series did not show any significant correlation (e.g. Enying/Szeged, Enying/Kiszombor, Kocs/Lippó) (Table 1). Table 1.

Kiszombor Szeged As regards TKM, either pair of locations showed close significant correlation. This finding demonstrates the determining role of fluctuating rates of other yield components (head/m 2 and seeds/head) among local yield anomalies. The results verified the genotype-specific character of TKM strongly determined genetically with good heritability. The close correlation was also connected with the loss of severe rust epidemic affecting heavily the TKW. The hardness index is a genotype-specific agronomic feature, similarly to TKW. There was significant correlation between the locations in each case. The lowest HI values were in Dicháza but, generally, the values were not below the hardness category limit. As regards gluten content data, there were no significant correlations between certain locations (Tab. 1.). Apparently, the sensitive and tolerant genotypes could be diverged by the help of these „indicator” locations (Fülöpszállás, Kiszombor). The genotypes responded in different ways to the nutrient supply and stresses specific to the growing environments. (Fig. 2.) The genotypes 22, 44 and 46 having variable gluten content showed significant gluten loss in the experiment at Fülöpszállás (Fig. 1b). Conversely, the 23, 50 and 70 genotypes proved to be stable for this trait (Fig. 1a).</p><p id="Pg280">VIII.

The closest negative correlation was found between the hardness index values and their variances (r=-0,74***) (Fig. 3.) There was also negative but not significant correlation in the cases of the yield and protein content data. The most important result of our work is the developed variety itself. Year by year, the multi-location trial is the basis of the development of our new winter wheat and winter durum wheat varieties. The high-yielding, good quality GK wheat lines with wide resistance spectrum and outstanding adaptability are generally applied for registration. In 2008, six new winter wheat and one durum wheat candidate were registered and their testing started in the state experiments. Simultaneously, their variety maintenance and seed multiplication began. Conclusions The results certified that local abiotic stresses may have strong effect indirectly on certain yield components like head/m 2 , seeds/head and some quality features like gluten and protein content. Our experiences suggest that the parameters like hardness index and TKW were more considerably determined by the cultivar itself than by the diverse local abiotic factors. The consequence in connection with the agronomical values and their stability can be useful in breeding. Probably, the positive selection to certain</p><p id="Pg281">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 284 agronomical features (TKW, gluten, hardness index), simultaneously, will be positive selection to their stability. However, it is necessary to execute further trials of several years to test a wider range of quality and resistance parameters to verify and extend these observations on the adaptability of wheat. The enlargement of this experimental information is also crucial in order to substantiate the agronomic recommendations attached to the marketed GK (Szeged-bred) wheat varieties and the recommended variety list itself. y=2362-25,42x 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Hardness index S ta n d a rd iz e d v a ri a n c e y=271,5-5x 0 50 100 150 200 250 30 35 40 45 50 TKM S ta n d a rd iz e d v a ri a n c e Figure 3.

HUNGARY, e-mail: Czobel.Szilard@mkk.szie.hu 2 Plant Ecological Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences &amp; Szent István University Abstract: To examine how water addition, fertilization and different abiotic stress factors can affect the species, especially weed composition and structure of a Central European loess grassland community, ex situ and in situ grassland plots were irrigated and fertilized for three consecutive years, including an extremely dry year (2003). During the studied period not only serious drought stress occured but other abiotic stress (e.g. heat) factors also influenced the species and weed composition. The treatments consisted of spray irrigation in the growing season at ex situ plots, while a compound mineral fertilizer was applied once a year at in situ plots. In addition aboveground biomass was removed twice per year. Interannual and intraannual dynamics of species richness, percentage cover, and different plant functional groups in treated and untreated permanent plots, were studied simultaneously. The majority of the examined parameters varied considerably among years at both treatments and their controls. At the treated plots, in general species richness, the number of plant life forms and social behaviour types, the ratio of dicots and C4 plants declined with addition of water and extensive fertilization. The ratio and number of disturbance tolerants, weeds and alien competitors declined due to the affect of water addition and compared to control stand. Fertilization created gaps in the treated plots, thus the number and ratio of weeds increased at the beginning. Keywords: drought stress, weed dynamics, fertilization, irrigation, managed grasslands Introduction Weeds are part of different ecosystems and can invade both managed and natural ecosystems. Any change in their species number and density provide an early sign of degradation processes, thus weed monitoring can be used to characterize terrestris vegetation. Grassland ecosystems in the Carpathian Basin may be particularly vulnerable to current and predicted changes in precipitation and nutrient supply, and ecosystem responses to potential effects of water and fertilizers are not well understood (Czóbel et al. 2009). However, relatively little research has focused on understanding how ecosystems respond to changes in precipitation regimes (Weltzin et al. 2003). The temporal changes of Pannonian natural grassland and wetland communities on species composition have been well studied from both ecological and ecophysiological point of view (Nagy et al. 2007, Szerdahelyi &amp; Nagy 2007, Tuba 2005, Tuba et al. 1996). But little is known about how change in source availibility and abiotic stress parallel may influence weed cover and richness in temperate natural grasslands. Irrigation (and other resource manipulations) resulted to increased invasibility of the grassland community, and resource enrichment generally increased diversity and productivity, these responses were contingent upon species availability and tended to be more pronounced in the presence of an expanded propagule pool (Kirchner 1977, Foster &amp; Timothy 2004). To examine how water addition, fertilization and abiotic stress factors can affect the species, especially weed composition and structure of a Central European loess grassland community, ex situ and in situ grassland plots were irrigated and fertilized for three consecutive years, including an extremely dry year (2003). During the studied</p><p id="Pg283">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 286 period not only serious drought stress occured but other abiotic stress (e.g. heat in 2003, flood in 2004) factors also influenced the species and weed composition. Materials and methods Study sites and experimental plots The in situ investigation was partly carried out on a tall-grass loess steppe near Isaszeg (47 o 42’N, 19 o 24’E, 255 m a.s.l.). Plots (1m x 1m) were selected along two tansects (5 fertilized, 5 control). Fertilizer was applied once a year in early summer in 2002 and at the beginning of the vegetation period in the ensuing years till 2004. The following amount were dispersed: 100 kg N ha -1 , 50 P ha -1 , 50 K ha -1 . Vegetation covered loess monoliths were transplanted from Gödöllı Hills (near Isaszeg) to the Botanical Garden of Szent István University in spring 2002 in order to study, among other the plant compositional and structural effects of irrigation. The measuring site is situated at Gödöllı (47 0 36’N, 19 0 26’E, 220 m above sea level). Transplanted monoliths were also positioned along two transects (5 irrigated, 5 control) and arranged to same sized loess grass patches (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.4m). Irrigation was scheduled to maintain a near steady state soil water content during the growing season (AprilOctober). Top spray irrigation operated at night was used for the water supply. Soil water cc. was kept below but near 0.35m3/m3 in treated plots. The climate of both site is temperate continental (mean annual precipitation is 560mm, mean annual temperature is 10.5 0 C), and the soil of the studied plots was a moderately eroded lime-impregnated chernozem. During the three years of our study, annual precipitation ranged from 432mm in 2003 to 627mm in 2004. Vegetation description The vegetation studied was xeric, species rich, tall loess grassland /Salvio-Festucetum rupicolae/. Selected plots initially dominated by Festuca ovina ssp. valesiaca (80%), Bromus inermis (8.7%) and Brachypodium rupestre (6.7%) in spring 2002. Other characteristic taxa of the community, like Salvia nemorosa, Euphorbia pannonica, Seseli osseum and Galium verum were commonly encountered in the plots. Applied methods Percent cover for each species was estimated using the relevé method (See e.g. Van Der Maarel 1979) out of which species richness, Shannon Diversity, mean cover and number of C4 species, and the relative distribution of functional groups (including social behaviour types based on Borhidi /1993/) were calculated. Results and discussion In general the species richness of weeds had been continuously low in both site and the higher weed ratio occured in autumn (Figure 1 &amp; 2). At Isaszeg site weeds occured only in the fertilized plots with very low density in spring 2004, while in autumn the number of weed taxa was the same and the relative weed cover was almost equal in the fertilized and control plots. In every autumn the mean no. of weed taxa was the same in the fertilized and its control plots (Fig. 1). Both fertilization and irrigation resulted increasing weed cover in the first year but significant shift followed it in the consecutive years (autumns). At Gödöllı site after 2 treated years the number of weed taxa decreased significantly in spring and by half in autumn in the irrigated stand. In 2004 both the weed richness and relative cover were lower (the latter significantly) in the</p><p id="Pg284">VIII.

In irrigated stand the mean weed cover only twice exceeded the control values probably due to the adaptation of the vegetation to the treatment (Fig. 2).

Temporal variation of percent weed cover and number of weed species in irrigated and control plots</p><p id="Pg285">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 288 In autumn of the drought stressed year 2003 the weed cover decreased significantly in both fertilized and irrigated stand, while increased in their controls compared to the fall 2002. In Gödöllı site the extreme dry spring 2003 resulted less decline in the total weed richness of non-stressed irrigated stand, while in autumn 2003 its number was equal in the treated and non-treated stand. In the latter period drought stress caused the largest difference of relative weed cover between the 2 stands, because it significantly increased the weed cover of the control plots. Conclusions The majority of the examined parameters varied considerably among years at both treatments and their controls. At the treated plots, in general species richness, the number of plant life forms and social behaviour types, the ratio of dicots and C4 plants declined with addition of water and extensive fertilization. The ratio and number of weeds, alien competitors and disturbance tolerants also decreased due to the affect of water addition and the increasing dominance of a strong competitor, Dactylis glomerata. Fertilization created gaps in the treated plots, thus the number and ratio of weeds increased at the beginning but because of the rapid natural regeneration of native taxa declined later. Our study gave further evidence that it is important to allow for an initial acclimation period in the evaluation of any manipulation experiment.

Methods based on chlorophyll fluorescence measurement are perspective for the assessment of herbicide efficacy and their phytotoxicity for grown crops. Current methods are mainly based on subjective assessment of treated plants by human senses, which can cause some inaccuracies. A fluorescence camera FluorCam is able to determine differences and intensity of fluorescence emitting caused by spreading herbicides in plant. We can assess their distribution in leaves, speed and effect on plant health. This method is non-invasive, non-destructive, fast and very sensitive. In the experiment, six herbicides were tested and assessed using a parameter called Quantum yield of fluorescence (QY). Treated experimental plants of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) were measured using a FluorCam at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 15 days after treatment and results were compared with current subjective assessment and growth parameters. Herbicides with active ingredients dicamba, bentazone, mesotrione, terbuthylazine, nicosulfuron and glyphosate-IPA were used in 100% registered doses in the experiment. The results showed that the effect of herbicides with active ingredients bentazone, mesotrione, terbuthylazine was detected earlier by QY than by any other parameter. Subjective assessment was the best parameter for detection of dicamba, nicosulfuron and glyphosate-IPA. We can say that measuring of QY values is suitable for herbicides that affect plant photosynthesis and can be used for herbicide assessment together with main subjective assessment for other herbicides as a supplementary parameter. Keywords: herbicide efficacy, chlorophyll fluorescence, fluorcam Introduction Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis has become one of the most powerful and widely used techniques available to plant physiologists and ecophysiologists (Maxwell, Johnson, 2000). Measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence has appeared to be reliable method to assess photosynthesis (Lu et al., 2000). Chlorophyll fluorescence is a light with specific wavelength which is emitted by plants as a “waste” of unused absorbed sunlight energy and its intensity depends on many stress factors. Methods based on chlorophyll fluorescence measurement are perspective for the assessment of herbicide action in plant, efficacy and phytotoxicity for grown crops. Current methods are mainly based on subjective assessment of treated plants by human senses which can cause some inaccuracies. Moreover, in many cases the actual effect of the herbicide is not visible by human eye, while the plant itself can be very seriously and significantly damaged. This method is non-destructive, non-invasive, fast and also very sensitive (Mouget and Tremblin, 2002). It is used for early detection of abiotic and biotic stress (high temperature, frost, drought, lack of nutrients, infection, exposure to herbicides, etc.) (Oukarroum et al., 2007, Toth et al., 2007, Christen et al., 2007), for polymorphism detection by fluorescent in situ hybridization (Szakács and Molnár-Láng, 2008) or for assessing of antioxidant activity, chilling tolerance of crops (Janda et al., 2005), etc. Materials and methods Six herbicides (Table 1) were tested and assessed using a parameter called Quantum yield of fluorescence (QY) in the experiment. Experimental plants of redroot pigweed</p><p id="Pg287">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 290 (Amaranthus retroflexus) were grown in a light-box with defined growth conditions to the stage of four true leaves, treated with herbicides (sprayer SOLO SPRAYSTAR 460) and measured by a FluorCam at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 15 days after treatment (thereinafter as DAT; Figure 1). Results were compared with current subjective assessment (10-point scale) and selected growth parameters (plant height, number of leaves &gt; 5mm) and statistically tested by analysis of variance with subsequent testing by Tukey´s test and analysis of correlation coefficients (Table 2). The fluorometer FluorCam FC-800 (closed version) is an instrument for multi-spectral kinetic fluorescence imaging that measures sequences of chlorophyll fluorescence images with user-defined irradiance protocols and timing of measurements (www.psi.cz). QY is currently the most studied and used fluorescence parameter. For simplicity, we can say that the value of QY refers to the "health state of the plants." It has range from 0 to 1 and healthy plants in the field show the max value of around 0.8, and the value below 0.7 means serious damage of plant. QY = (Fm-Fo) / Fm, QY is a measure of the Photosystem II efficiency, Fm is maximal fluorescence intensity and Fo minimal fluorescence intensity of selected object. Table 1.

Conclusions A very important finding based on the results obtained from the experiments is that the effect of herbicides is expressed in the change of chlorophyll fluorescence and the camera FluorCam provides sufficient opportunities in assessing the efficacy of herbicides. The results revealed that the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence using the FluorCam device can be used for early efficacy assessment of herbicides which affect photosynthesis.</p><p id="Pg289">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 292 Possibility of early determination can be very well justified by the fact that we can determine the effect of the herbicide just before visible symptoms. Fluorescence measurement gives us early reference of the current status of the plants while the subjectively rated symptoms of herbicide damage can be visible later. This is particularly true for the results of the contact herbicide with active ingredient bentazone and systemic herbicides containig terbuthylazine and mesotrione because of their direct effect on photosynthesis. For active ingredients dicamba, nicosulfuron and glyphosateIPA, QY measurement is not so sensitive for early detection in comparison with subjective assessment because of their indirect influence on photosynthesis. The FluorCam also allows us to capture the speed and intensity of exposure to the herbicide in different parts of plants. In particular, when monitoring systemic herbicides on fluorescent photographs, we can clearly see visible difference in young parts of plants that are most affected by the herbicide.

Abstract: Frost is an abiotic environmental stress factor significant hazard to many horticultural regions in Hungary. Now we should be focusing more studies on the effects of climatic changes because understanding and ability to minimise the risk of crop loss or damage is fundamental to managing a profitable enterprise. The year of 2007 was critical for Hungarian fruit growers, especially in Alföld region. Serious frost damaged was observed at blooming time in this region, which was approximately 100%. The aim of our research is to study the effects of frost of 2007 on nutrient uptake of an integrated apple orchard in North-West Hungary. Besides plant observations, macronutrient status of eight apple cultivars was studied for three years (2006-2008) to study the effects of frost on fruit load of trees and to conclude the degree and long-term impact of frost stress. Leaf N content decreased while leaf P and K was increased at all cultivars in the year of frost. In the next year leaf P and K dramatically decreased while leaf N increased and reached the earlier N level. Plant observations pointed out that the vegetative and generative balance of trees was significantly shifted due to the frost stress. Fruit loss caused higher vigour and nutrient disorder of trees. The damage not only puts at risk the current season’s fruit, but also because of the perennial nature of fruits, can influence the productivity of fruits for several seasons in the future. Keywords: frost, nutrient disorder, apple, environmental stress Introduction The climate condition is one of the main key factors in the production of high and qualitative yields of fruits (Bramagle, 1993). Nowadays climate extremities result more and more problems for fruit growers all over world (Várallyay, 2007). Frost is an abiotic environmental stress factor significant hazard to many horticultural regions in Hungary. As fruit trees are perennial plants, should they be damaged, the consequence of that event may have impact on growth and yield for years, which cause severe economic losses (Rodrigo, 2000). Spring frost damage in 2007 points out that the degree of injury depends on the minimum temperature reached the rate at which the temperature falls, the amount of time below a critical temperature and the orchard site. However, appropriate cultural techniques will enable damage to be minimal (Kincses et al., 2008). As a consequence yield and fruit composition return to maximum levels as quickly as possible. In practice managing frost injury can be divided into three broad sections: • Understanding the factors that affect the frost sensitivity of a particular site. • Managing a site and fruits to minimise risk in a particular season. • Managing fruits that have been damaged to reduce immediate. The aim of our research is to study the effects of frost of 2007 on nutrient uptake of an integrated apple orchard in North-West Hungary. Besides plant observations, macronutrient status of eight apple cultivars was studied for three years (2006-2008) to</p><p id="Pg291">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 294 study the effects of frost on fruit load of trees and to conclude the degree and long-term impact of frost stress. Materials and methods Our investigations were carried out between 2006 and 2008 in an integrated apple orchard (Malus domestica Borkh.) of TEDEJ Rt., Hajdúnánás-Tedej, in Eastern Hungary. The orchard was set up on lowland chernozem soil. It was established in the autumn of 1999, using grafted on MM106 rootstocks at a spacing of 3.8 x 1.1 m. Soil samples were taken from three layers (0-20 cm; 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm). Sampling was performed at the beginning of the vegetation period on April, in 2006. Determination of the soluble nutrient element content of the soil was based on MSZ 20135:1999. For plant analysis the following apple cultivars were selected (see in Table 2.). Healthy, fully developed leaves were taken from the mid-third portion of extension shoots current year were collected. Leaf samples were collected 100 days after full bloom, from 50 uniform trees in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Leaf N was determined described by Nagy, 2000. Leaf P and K were determined described by soil samples. Results and discussion Soil analysis: For the characterisation of the soil the most important soil parameters were determined (Table 1.). Table 1.

The physical category of soil was clay loam. The soil P and K was medium, while the soil N was suitable for growing. The values of easily soluble N form correspond to the type of examined soil and decreased by depth. Plant analysis: Values and status of leaf N, P and K at different species in 2006, 2007 and 2008 were shown in Table 2-4. In 2006, before frost, leaf N, P and K was sufficient at most of cultivars and balanced nutrient ratios ruled in the orchard (Table 2-4). In 2007, leaf N was lower, while leaf P and K was higher at most cultivars than in 2006. It can be explained by the absence of fruits caused a smaller accumulation of N.</p><p id="Pg292">VIII.

It meant that the vegetative processes became dominant. Increase of leaf P and K explained with the fruit failure also. Falling down of flowers and fruit sets hindered the translocation of the uptake P and K towards fruit sets. In the year followed frost reverse changes were observed. In 2008, higher leaf N was measured at all cultivars than in 2007 and its level reached the earlier N supply level (Table 2). Leaf P and K deceased in the year after frost, contrary to leaf N (Table 3-4). Dramatic dropping was observed with especial regard to leaf P (Table 3). Table 3.

Chemical analysis of leaves and plant observations pointed out that the vegetative and generative balance of trees was significantly shifted due to the frost stress. Fruit loss caused higher vigor and nutrient disorder of trees. The damage not only puts at risk the current season’s fruit, but also because of the perennial nature of fruits, can influence the productivity of fruits for several seasons in the future.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the rearranged wheat chromosome and to identify the 7D chromosome segment eliminated by the translocated 5HS segment using 7D-specific SSR markers. The elimination of the 7DS terminal region was proved by three of the twenty-four tested markers. The breakpoint of the 5HS.7DS translocation was considered to be closer to the telomere than the breakpoint of known deletion lines, which provides a new physical landmark for future deletion mapping studies. The fine mapping of 7D makes it possible to localize agronomically useful genes to the precise chromosomal region of the eliminated 7DS segment, opening up the possibility of marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning. Keywords: wheat-barley translocation line, in situ hybridisation, SSR markers, physical mapping Introduction Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), one of the most important crops, carries several genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, which can be transferred to wheat via wide hybridisation. The production of wheat-barley translocation lines is an important intermediate step in transferring genes of interest into wheat. Besides their importance in wheat breeding programmes, translocation lines are excellent genetic materials for the physical mapping of genes or molecular markers to specific breakpoint intervals (bins). Using the translocation breakpoint as a physical landmark, genes or molecular markers can be located to a precise chromosomal region (Nagy et al. 2002). When comparing genetic and physical maps, discrepancies were found in marker order and in the distances between markers. Due to the recombination hotspots, which are more frequent in the gene-rich regions close to the telomeres, genetic maps provide only an estimate of marker positions (Gustafson et al. 1990; Lukaszewski and Curtis 1993). It is particularly difficult to assess the marker order using genetic mapping in regions of high marker density, where genetic distances are very short (Sourdille et al. 2004). Microsatellite markers are highly polymorphic genetic markers making it possible to discriminate between closely related species. Translocations and their breakpoint positions can be visualised using genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) (Schwarzacher et al. 1989, Le et al. 1989, Molnár-Láng et al. 2000b) and the rearranged chromosomes can be identified with fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using repetitive DNA sequences (Molnár et al. 2009). The 5HS.7D translocation line analysed in the present study was developed in Martonvásár from the ‘Mv9kr1’ × ‘Igri’ hybrid (Molnár-Láng et al. 2000a) and was identified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This genetic material was previously used for the physical mapping of the 5H barley chromosome (Nagy et al 2002, Molnár-Láng et al. 2005) but it was not completely clarified which region of the</p><p id="Pg295">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 298 7D chromosome was substituted by barley chromosome arm 5HS. The aim of the present study was to describe the precise composition of the translocated chromosome and to identify the substituted wheat chromosome segment. Materials and methods Plant material: The wheat/barley translocation line was developed from the Mv9kr1 × Igri hybrid produced in Martonvásár, Hungary, as described in detail by Molnár-Láng et al. (2000a). The 5HS.7D translocation line was selected from the backcrossed progenies of the hybrid using GISH. Genomic in situ hybridization: Total genomic DNA from the barley cultivar Igri was labelled with fluorored (rhodamine-4-dUTP, Amersham) using nick-translation, while DNA from Mv9kr1 wheat was used as blocking DNA. The in situ hybridization experiment was carried out as described previously by Szakács and Molnár-Láng (2008), except that the hybridisation temperature was 65°C. SSR marker analysis: DNA was isolated from the wheat cultivar Mv9kr1, the barley cultivar Igri and from the Mv9kr1/Igri translocation line. The DNA extraction was performed as described by Anderson et al. (1992). Twenty-four SSRs distributed over the 7D chromosome (7DS-specific SSRs: Xwmc506, Xgdm130, Xbarc184, Xgwm44, Xgwm295, Xgdm86, Xbarc126, Xgwm111, Xbarc214 and Xgwm350; 7DL-specific SSRs: Xwmc437, Xwmc94, Xbarc1046, Xbarc172, Xbarc111, Xgdm46, Xgdm67, Xbarc53, Xgwm428, Xgwm37, Xcfd69, Xgdm142, Xgdm150 and Xgdm84) were selected from the GrainGenes 2.0 database (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml). The PCR reactions were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinc Inc., Hamburg, Germany) using the PCR mixture described by Schneider and Molnár-Láng. (2008). The 45 cycles were performed with 30 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at either 50°C, 55°C or 60°C (depending on the annealing temperature of the microsatellite markers), 30 sec at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. The bands were stained using ethidium bromide, and DNA was visualised using a SynGene GelDoc system (SynGene, Cambridge, England). Results and discussion Twenty-four microsatellites distributed over the 7D chromosome were used to determine the 7D chromosome segment eliminated by the barley chromosome arm 5HS. Polymorphism was detected for all the markers between PCR products amplified by wheat and barley DNA, so all the markers could be used to characterise the rearranged chromosome. All the 7DL-specific markers produced PCR products of the expected size on wheat and on the translocation DNA, revealing the presence of the complete 7DL. In the case of three 7DS-specific markers (Xbarc184, Xwmc506 and Xgdm130) the Mv9kr1/Igri translocation line failed to amplify the 7DS-specific fragments given by wheat DNA, signaling the elimination of a short chromosome segment carrying these markers. None of these three markers were previously mapped physically within 7DS but genetic mapping studies located them close to the telomere of 7DS. The other seven 7DS-specific markers were present on the translocation chromosome. Four of these markers (Xbarc126, Xgwm44, Xgwm295, Xbarc214) were mapped previously to the</p><p id="Pg296">VIII.

As the FISH experiment detected the absence of a strong Afa family signal characteristic of the terminal 7DS region, it was concluded that this region had been deleted. The 7DSspecific markers absent from this genetic material were thus located on the deleted, most distal region of 7DS. Obviously, the three missing markers (Xbarc184, Xwmc506, Xgdm130) were situated distally to the four markers present on the translocation chromosome (Xbarc126, Xgwm44, Xgwm295, Xbarc214) and mapped previously to the terminal bin of 7DS. The present study physically mapped Xbarc184, Xwmc506 and Xgdm130 to FL 0.61-1.00, but distally to markers Xbarc126, Xgwm44, Xgwm295 and Xbarc214.

The marker order revealed in the present study showed good accordance with the wheat microsatellite consensus map established by Somers et al. (2004), except for the marker Xgwm350, which was mapped genetically as the most distal marker within 7DS. The analysis of the 5HS.7DS.7DL translocation clarified the position of this marker and placed it proximally to Xbarc184, Xwmc506 and Xgdm130. The 5HS.7DS.7DL translocation provides a new breakpoint interval within FL 0.611.00 characterised by three microsatellites, making it possible to construct more detailed physical maps involving the terminal 7DS region.</p><p id="Pg297">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

More detailed physical mapping analysis of the terminal regions of 7DS is thus possible, opening up the way for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection.

Helena HNILIČKOVÁ 1 – František HNILIČKA 1 – Petr SVOBODA 2 – Jiří KOŘEN 2 – Jaroslava MARTINKOVÁ 1 1 Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, 165 21 Prague 6 – Suchdol, Czech Republic, e-mail: hnilickova@af.czu.cz 2 Hop Research institute, Co., Ltd., Kadaňská 2525, Žatec, Czech Republic Abstract: Hop plants are very demanding as concerns sufficient amount of water, and therefore the aim of the experiments was to monitor the impact of water deficit on the exchange of gases in the juvenile hop plants. The impact of water deficit was observed in controlled greenhouse conditions where the plants of Žatecký poloraný červeňák (SAAZ)“Osvaldův klon 72” were cultivated in 15 l containers in two groups – the control group and the stressed group. In the stressed group, irrigation was interrupted for a period of nine days and then seven-day rehydration followed. It is apparent from the obtained results that after irrigation is interrupted, the levels of stomatal conductivity, transpiration and photosynthesis rate significantly decrease. After nine days of stress, the stomatal conductivity reached almost a zero level and the photosynthesis rate was 5.320 µmol CO2 m -2 s-1 and the transpiration rate was 0.987 mol H2O m -2 s-1. When irrigation was resumed, the stomatal conductivity, transpiration rate and photosynthesis rate increased. At the end of the experiment, the photosynthesis rate reached 55.64 % of the pre-stress level and the stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate reached 49,54 % and 38 % of the pre-stress level, respectively. Keywords: hop plants, Humulus lupulus L., water stress, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductivity Introduction The most frequent factor limiting the growing of field crops is the uneven distribution of precipitation during their vegetation and subsequent drought because the works by Várallyay (2008) suggest possible changes of climate in Central Europe. With regard to these facts, it is necessary to study wild and cultural plants as concerns their resistance to abiotic stressors (Vegh and Rajkai, 2006, Kuklová and Kukla, 2008). However, from this point of view, cultivating plants to make them resistant to abiotic stressors, especially drought, is very complicated, time-consuming and the assessment of this resistance is a long-term problem (Vegh and Rajkai, 2006). According to Hniličková et al. (2007, 2008), studying the physiological characteristics of hop and the resistance of hop to stresses is very complicated because it reaches the height of up to 8 m and the most significant cultivation area is situated in the territory of the rain shadow of Krušné Mountains. Since there is a lack of more detailed data on the physiology of the cultivated hops, our objective was to identify the selected physiological characteristics of a classical hop clone with respect to water deficit. Materials and methods In the greenhouse of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, an experiment concentrated on studying the effect of water deficit on the selected physiological characteristics of young hop plants was carried out. The experiment was designed as a vessel-based experiment, in which the experimental plants were grown in vessels with a volume of 15 l, filled with homogenized garden substrate. The experimental material</p><p id="Pg299">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 302 was Žatecký poloraný červeňák (SAAZ) "Osvaldův klon 72". The plan of the experiment contained two groups: the control group (irrigated up to full saturation) and the stressed group where irrigation was limited to 35 % of the field capacity. In this group, irrigation was interrupted for a period of nine days (d). Then the irrigation of the stressed plants was resumed for a period of seven days (r). In the hop plants, at the development stages 12.BBCH through 25.BBCH, selected physiological parameters [photosynthesis rate (PN), transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductivity (gs)] were measured by means of an infrared gas analyser LCpro+. The physiological characteristics were measured under constant illumination at 740 µmol and temperature of 25 °C. The levels of physiological characteristics obtained in the measurement were statistically processed in the STATISTICA Cz software, version 7.0. Results and discussion The levels of the monitored physiological parameters of the stressed hop plants obtained in the measurement are stated in figure 1-3. After the irrigation was interrupted and gradual dehydration was induced, all the monitored physiological characteristics decreased. As early as on the second day after limitation of the irrigation (dehydration), a statistically conclusive decrease of stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate was recorded. These results are in accordance with the works, for example, by Živčák et al. (2008), Ahmadi, Siosemardeh (2005), Lia et al (2005), who mention a decrease of stomatal conductivity in common wheat after exposure to water deficit. On the ninth day of dehydration, the stomatal conductivity reached the order of thousandths (0.003 mol m -2 s -1 ) and the photosynthesis rate (5.32 µmol CO2 m -2 s -1 ) and the transpiration rate (0.987 mmol H2O m -2 s -1 ) were also hovering at very low levels in comparison with the plants in the control group, as shown in figure 1-3. The decrease of transpiration rate after exposure of wheat plants to water deficit is mentioned, for example, by Meng et al. (2006), Lu et al. (2005). As compared with the stressed plants, in the plants from the control group, a gradual increase of the photosynthesis rate was observed in the monitored period because the photosynthesis rate was 12.603 µmol CO2 m -2 s -1 at the beginning of the experiment and 13.612 µmol CO2 m -2 s -1 at the end of the experiment. The photosynthesis rate levels were oscillating within the range of the levels, which are stated for hop plants by Hniličková et al. (2007, 2008) in her work. The transpiration rate of the plants from the control group did not show any increase or decrease during the experiment. The transpiration rate hovered within the range from 2.987 mmol H2O m -2 s -1 (the 8 th day of dehydration) to 3.698 mmol H2O m -2 s -1 (the 2 nd day of rehydration). The transpiration rate levels of the hop plants from the control group were higher than the ones stated, for example, by Hniličková et al. (2008). A decrease of the photosynthesis and transpiration rates, depending on water deficit, is confirmed, for example, by Bodi and Pepo (2007), Csajbók et al. (2007, 2008) for maize plants, by Hniličková et al. (2008) for hop plants. After irrigation of the stressed plants had been resemed, we monitored the regeneration of the individual physiological functions for a period of seven days.

Both parameters of the stressed plants show a very strong correlation. The correlation coefficients were 97% and 98% for the photosynthesis rate and the transpiration rate, respectively. Similar correlation was also identified in the plants from the control group. The results of Xu et al. (2007) show a significantly positive correlation between photosynthesis and stomatal conductivity. This conclusion was confirmed according to the calculated correlation coefficient not only for photosynthesis rate but also for transpiration rate. In conclusion, it is possible to state in agreement with Strauss, Agenbag (2000) that measuring the gas exchange rate is a useful parameter for identifying the water stress in plants.</p><p id="Pg301">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

At the end of the experiment, the photosynthesis rate reached 62 % of the pre-stress level and the stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate reached 38 % of the pre-stress level. The measuring the gas exchange rate is a useful parameter for identifying the water stress in plants.

Zoltán BERZSENYI – Györgyi MICSKEI – Eszter SUGÁR Crop Production Department Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 2462 Martonvásár, Hungary Abstract: The effect of three microbial consortia (comprise of Azospirillum, Pseudomonas and Glomus strains) was studied on the growth, physiological parameters and yield of maize under different fertilisation conditions in a long-term experiment within an international research project. Fertilisation had a significant effect on the shoot and root growth and the root/shoot ratio. The microbial consortia affected the root/shoot ratio. The effect of the fertilisation treatments was characterised by the nutrient stress parameter based on the mean absolute growth rate (AGR). Among physiological parameters, only the fertilisation treatments had significant effect on the leaf area and the chlorophyll content. Fertilisation had significant effect on the grain yield of maize and its protein content. Only the grain protein content was affected significantly by microbial consortia. Keywords: maize, long-term experiment, fertilisation, microbial consortia, dry matter, nutrient stress Introduction The objective of the international research project was to develop and validate integrated farming practices based on the management of indigenous and inoculated plant-beneficial microbes in the maize rhizosphere, so as to reduce chemical fertiliser usage in maize monoculture. The project was focused on synergistic consortia of multifunction microbes comprising the two PGPR Azospirillum and Pseudomonas, and mycorrhizal fungus Glomus. The research included the development of a plant-microbe interaction toolbox, selection of synergistic microbial consortia, identification of inoculant-friendly maize genotypes. Our task in the project was the implementation of field trials and agronomic monitoring of crop quality and yield. Materials and methods The effect of microbial consortia on maize growth and grain yield was studied in 2008 at Martonvásár in a long-term experiment established by Gyırffy in 1961. The soil of the experimental area is a humus-rich loam of the chernozem type with forest residues, poorly supplied with available phosphorus, but well supplied of potassium. The experiment was set up in a split-plot design, the main plot was the fertilisation and the sub-plot was the microbial consortia. The long-term experiment included 5 fertilisation treatments: A: control, without fertilisation (N0P0K0), B: N50P24K43, C: N100P48K87, D: N200P96K174, E: N300P144K261. Three microbial inoculation treatments were studied: C0: control, no microbial consortia, but non-inoculated carriers (peat and zeolite) were used, C1: A. lipoferum CRT1 + P.fluorescens Pf153 + G. intraradices JJ129, C2: A. lipoferum CRT1 + P.fluorescens F113 + G. intraradices JJ129. Sowing date was April 25 and inoculant-friendly PR37Y15 maize hybrid was sown with a plant density of 70 000 plants ha -1 . The weather conditions were favourable for maize production in 2008. During the vegetation period the amount of rainfall was 483 mm, the average temperature was 18.0°C, and the cumulated global radiation was 329 MJ m -2 . The shoot and root weight was measured in five sampling dates and the main phonological phases were recorded. Leaf area was measured by a portable leaf area meter (LA 300A) and the chlorophyll content with a SPAD 502 chlorophyll meter on the leaf under the ear after</p><p id="Pg303">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 306 flowering, while the grain yield and protein content of the yield was determined at harvest. The data at each sampling dates were analysed by the two-factorial variance analysis, and the measurements combined over time were evaluated with the three-factorial variance analysis. Mean values of absolute growth rate (AGR) were calculated from the shoot and root dry weight data according to Hunt (1982). Nutrient stress is a quantitative estimate of the intensity of current nutrient deficiency in a plant (Izsáki 2007, Sárvári et al. 2007, Berzsenyi - Dang 2008). The relative shortfall can be expressed as a percentage (Greenwood 1976): 100∗[(AGR at maximum NPK response) – (AGR at deficiency)]/(AGR at maximum NPK response). Results and discussion The effect of fertilisation was significant on the dry weight of the shoot, on the root/shoot ratio and, with the exception of the first sampling date, on the dry weight of the roots as well. The values of these parameters increased significantly at the higher fertilisation rates (D-E treatments) at every sampling times (Table 1.). The effect of the microbial consortia was only significant for the root/shoot ratio in the third and fourth sampling dates. The seasonal dynamics of shoot and root dry weight accumulation according to fertilisation and microbial consortia are shown on Figure 1. It is clear that shoot- and root weights increased constantly throughout the investigated period in every treatment. The three-factorial variance analysis showed that the effect of fertilisation, sampling date and their interaction was significant. As a result of fertilisation, from the third sampling date the shoot and root dry weight was significantly higher in D-E treatments, comparing with the other treatments. The effect of microbial consortia was not significant (Figure 1). Table 1.

Böszörményi út, Debrecen, Hungary, e-mail: tarjanzs@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Nowadays high yield, good baking quality, suitability for intensive production and good adaptation ability to non optimal conditions are generally required for winter wheat varieties. The more than 130 registered varieties offer a wide range of opportunities to select the right genetic basis being the most suitable for the cropping location and agronomy. The expression of genetic potential both in yield and quality is highly influenced by ecological conditions, and under the Hungarian weather conditions, the low level of precipitation, and this way, the plant available soil moisture is a significant stress factor of production in almost half of the cropping years. Kosutány (1907) says that quality of wheat is determined first of all by precipitation and temperature and in the changeable weather conditions of nowadays more and more verify his findings. In our study we have analysed the connection between the weather parameters (precipitation, daily average temperature), as stress factors and protein characteristics quality parameters of winter wheat (protein content, wet gluten content, gluten index, gluten expansiveness and Zeleny sedimentation volume) to find the weather parameters and critical periods that had proved effect on the quality of winter wheat flour. Our data are from a long term field experiment at Látókép, what gives us the possibility to compare years with extreme weather conditions (as 2006 and 2007) to normal and optimal cropping years for the winter wheat production. Keywords: weather conditions, protein characteristics, gluten content, glutenindex Introduction Qualitative and quantitative success of the chosen species is influenced considerably by ecological conditions. According to Ragasits quality of wheat is determined decisively by the habitat and success of good quality is facilitated by advantageous year. Accordingly adaptability to the variable ecological, mainly weather conditions is a measure of value characteristics of the individual species (Balogh and Pepó, 2008). Hornok M. (2008) has made similar observations. Gyıri and Gyıriné (1998) have found that the year essentially influence the uptake and utilization of elements. Lelley and Rajtháthy think, that northern boundary of wheat growing is the latitude where the from May to September the monthly average temperature is above 14 ºC, while on the southern boundary it doesn’t exceed 23-25 ºC during graining. Kosutány (1907) says quality of wheat is determined first of all by precipitation and temperature, while according to Vida and Jolánkai (1995) the appropriate supply of precipitate is the most important parameter (copious rainfall in April and May, moderate in June and July). On the basis of the results of a species-comparative analysis carried out on chernozem we looked for connection between the annual trend of weather parameters (total precipitation, average temperature) as stress factors and some quality parameters (wet gluten content, gluten index, gluten expansiveness and Zeleny-number) to find weather parameters and critical periods that have proved effect on the quality of winter wheat flour.</p><p id="Pg307">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

In the spring and summer months there is a more significant deviation between the two production years. In 2005-2006 the amount of precipitation was square, in all months there was a lot precipitation, the highest amount fell in April: 92.3 mm. In the spring-summer months of 2006-2007 the amount of precipitation was low, the highest amount fell in May: 54.0 mm. The studied plots were treated with optimal fertilizer dosages: 120 kg ha -1 N, 90 kg ha -1 P2O5, 106 kg ha -1 K2O.

Under wet conditions the wet gluten content of winter wheat is higher than under dry, milder climatic circumstances. In case of the studied species this tendency can be observed, except for MV Suba that wet gluten content wasn’t affected by the weather. We found the highest difference in case of the GK Békés: it was 24 % between the two years. We observed significant deviation also in case of GK Kapos. The change of Zeleny sedimentation volume (Figure 3.) was similar to the change of wet gluten content. In humid production year 2005-2006 the Zeleny sedimentation volume of every species was higher than in 2007. The difference between the two production years was the highest in case of species GK Kapos. The Zeleny sedimentation volume in 20052006 was 63.75 ml, while this value was only 39.75 ml in 2006-2007. The difference was significant at P&lt;0.05. In Figure 2. the gluten index is shown depending on the production years and studied species. The more humid wetter increased the gluten content (Figure 1.), in contrast the quality of gluten decreased (Figure 2.). In case of the studied species the gluten index was higher in 2006-2007 than in 2005-2006. We found a significant difference between species MV Suba, MV Mazurka, GK Békés and GK Kapos in the two years (P&lt;0,05). The gluten expansiveness (Figure 4.) is an important quality parameter as well. There was a significant difference in the gluten expansiveness of species GK Békés, GK Kapos, MV Mazurka and Lupus (P&lt;0.05).

However, we have observed that various varieties very much distinctly react to change of mean yearly rainfall and average daily temperature. In 2006, wet gluten content and Zeleny sedimentation volume of the investigated flours improved due to the wetter and cooler weather conditions, but the quality of gluten decreased. While, in the year with dry and hot weather, the quantity of wet gluten was less, but the quality properties of gluten were excellent. References Balogh Á., Pepó P.

These species can impose their allelopathy on other plants, but in many cases investigators can their different effects in several experiments, so their real allelopathic effects are questionable. Some investigators suggested that several environmental (abiotic and biotic) factors may play role in allelopathic relationships, and can modify it significantly. Effect of drought stress and temperature were studied on allelopathy of the three weeds imposed on test plants (cress – Lepidium sativum). Germination and growth of test plant were evaluated, and concentrations of some allelochemicals were measured in donor plants. It was found that all examined environmental factors had significant effect on allelopathy of velvetleaf, jimsonweed and cocklebur appeared in responses of test plant and amounts of allelochemicals. Keywords: allelopathy, environmental factor, stress, velvetleaf, jimsonweed, cocklebur Introduction Allelopathy of several weeds was identified in biotests, and it was observed under natural conditions in agroecosystems in many cases. Allelopathy of noxious weeds, i. e. velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), cocklebur (Xanthium italicum Mor.), jimsonweed (Datura stramonium L.) was proved long time ago, and it supposed to play determinant role in competitiveness of them. However, real role of allelopathy is controversial in competition of plants and in non-herbicidal weed management methods. One of main reason of antinomic estimation of allelopathy is its changeability: allelopathy of plants or microorganisms expresses in different degree and manner in several experimets. Rice (1964) called attention to several factors which can modify allelopathical relationship of plants and microorganisms. He found that age of plant parts influence their allelophatic effects depending on species. He observed differences in allelopathy of plants falling within the same species depending on phenological stages, and found differences when there was no inequality in maturity. In these cases he supposed that environmental factors can modify allelopathy. According to Kazinczi et al. (1991) main factors which can influence effect of allelopathy are used plant parts (leaf, stem or root), maturity of plant parts, examined live process, plant species (perhaps cultivars). Allelopathic plants contain mixtures of several types of allelochemicals (flavonoids, polyphenols, phenoloids, etc.) (Kazinczi et al. 2007.), so final effect depends on their ratio and interactions. Dias and Dias (2000) examined the effect of drought stress on expressing of allelopathy in case of jimsonweed as donor and cucumber as test plant. Differences were found among effect of plants grown under different water supply levels, furthermore age of plant parts proved to be determinant in amounts of several allelochemicals. Effects of stress factors was found by several authors (El-Tayeb, 2006; Farooq and Azam, 2007) Casini (2004) examined allelopathic effect of cocklebur extracts on several maize hybrids, which had different responses to the same treatments.</p><p id="Pg311">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 314 Szabó (2000) proposed to unify experimental methods to decrease methodical differences and make better reproducibility of experiments. An uniform methodology may make better reproducibility of experiments, but it must be based on knowledge of main factors which can effect on allelopathy. Materials and methods Allelopathy of Xanthium italicum, Abutilon theophrasti and Datura stramonium was examined in bioassays. Donor plants were grown in greenhouse in plots on sandy soil in 2008. Soil of plant was kept on 70% ( treatment 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21), 50% (treatment 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22), 30% (treatment3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23) of minimum water capacity or dried to unavailable water content of soil in case of treatment 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (table 1.). Shoots and roots were collected separately at 4 or 5 leaves stage of plants. Collected plant samples were stored frozen until drying at 40 o C then samples were stored cooled until use. Extracts were made of 2,5g dried and ground shoot or root in 100 ml water. Extraction lasted 24 hours at 21 o C in darkness. Bioassays were conducted in Petri dishes (diameter 9cm) with cress (Lepidium sativum) (50 seeds in a dish) under 12 hours light/12 hours dark light regime. Temperature of germination was 20 o C in one case or 10 o C in other case. Root and shoot growth of test plants were measured after 3 and 6 day the establishment of biotests. Table 1.

Shoot extracts had the strongest inhibitory effect when donor plants were grown in soil dried until unavailable water content. Root extracts did not reduce root length as much as shoot extracts, and in some cases they stimulated the growth of cress. Some extracts had contrary effects on test plants germinated at low (10 o C) and higher (20 o C) temperature.

This region is specific with highly variable rainfall distribution that in most years causes strong reduction of yield, particularly on well-drained sandy soils. In the years 2006-2008 the plot trials were conducted at two sites differing significantly in water availability during vegetation period. Applying incomplete-block design the performance of more than 40 registered varieties was assessed. At site with high soil and sub-soil moisture average grain yield reached 8.7 t.ha-1. At the second site characterised with sandy soil the average yield was approx. 3.5 t.ha-1. Several distinctive groups of varieties were identified, i.e. high yielding varieties suitable for normal conditions, varieties superior on soils with restricted water availability and also varieties with over average yields in both environments. Keywords: Triticum aestivum, abiotic stress, drought, varietal response Introduction Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most important crop in the Czech Republic, it covers more than a half of the production area of cereals (2008 year: 802 324 ha, average yield 5.60 t.ha -1 ). In some areas the productivity of this crop is heavily influenced by the presence of abiotic stresses, particularly by lack of available water. In contrast to other semiarid regions, the drought periods in Central Europe fluctuate and can induce rather sudden stress in some crucial stages of plant development. Hlavinka et al. (2008) demonstrated that at least in some areas of the CR drought is one of the key causes of interannual yield variability and has a quantifiable negative effect even within more humid regions. Under drought, grain yield is determined by the amount of water the crop extracts from the soil, the efficiency with which this water is converted into biomass and the fraction of this, which is partitioned to grains. All of these processes are genetically controlled (Foulkes et al., 2002). Study of varietal response to different environmental conditions is in general complicated by the genotype by environment interactions, thus it is a problem to select varieties adapted to less favourable environments (Farshadfar, Sutka, 2006). Different statistical approaches have been adapted for identification of superior genotypes (Hill et al, 1998; Mohammadi, Amri, 2008). Materials and methods The experiments were located at the Field Research Station of Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno, Žabčice, Czech Republic (longitude 49°01´ N, 16°37´ E; altitude 179 m. s. l.; annual average temperature 9.2 °C; annual precipitation 480 mm). This locality is unique due to presence of heavy loamy soils (gleyic fluvisol, 51 % of clayey particles) with good water retention near to exceedingly permeable sandy soils of chernozem type formed on a gravel terrace (20 – 28 % of clayey particles). Each year two parallel plot trials were established on both loamy (A) and sandy (B) sites. According to regular soil analyses (Mehlich III.) the level of macronutrients (P; K; Ca and Mg) was characterised as optimum or high in all</p><p id="Pg315">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 318 experimental years on both sites, pH (KCl) varied from 6.5 to 7.3 at A site and 5.7 – 5.9 at B site. The availability of nitrogen in soil was also tested. An incomplete block design (Alpha-design) was used for randomisation within three replicate blocks, the harvested area of one plot was 10.5 m 2 . Each year from 42 to 47 current winter wheat varieties were selected so as to provide information about the response of most grown commercial varieties. Commonly those comparative trials are done with the use of irrigation (e.g. Foulkes et al., 2002; Baser et al., 2004), but conditions at our station allowed us to get significant results naturally. Weather observations included air temperature, precipitation and the measurement of soil moisture. Plot management followed the rules of experimental practice, fertilizer application and chemical treatments were adjusted according to growing conditions and disease occurrence. The amount of added nitrogen was about 100 kg N.ha -1 at A site and about 70 kg N.ha -1 at B (sandy) site. An optimum rate for low-cropping environments is considered 40 kg N.ha -1 (Limon-Ortega, 2008). During vegetation period the observation of important agronomic traits were recorded (earliness, lodging, height of plants, no. of ears per m 2 ), and after harvest grain yield (kg.m -2 at 14 % of moisture), thousand grain weight (g) and specific weight (g.l -1 ). For statistical analysis Statistica 7 (StatSoft) was used. Results and discussion Varietal trials in the years 2006 – 2008 were established on two different sites to test the response of winter wheat varieties to stress conditions. The chosen fields differed mostly in the water availability during vegetation; the site A with high level of sub soil water provided the plants with sufficient moisture even in the periods without rainfall, the water availability on sandy soil (site B) was restricted mainly from the stage of stem elongation to harvest. The data provided by the continuous monitoring of soil moisture confirmed the occurrence of water deficiency on sandy soils (data not given here). Table 1.

The small differences were detected in specific weight, only 4 % (A sites 787 g.l -1 ; B sites 752 g.l -1 ). The observed yield reduction in dry conditions corresponded with results from similar experiments, e.g. Márton (2008). Effects on components of yield depended on the timing of drought. Foulkes et al. (2002) stated that drought mainly after flowering did not affect the number of ears per area, but individual grain weight and no. of grain per ear were significantly decreased. More prolonged drought affected all yield components. Table 2.

The SRY describes genetic performance of varieties as relative varietal yields standardised to equal variance of varietal means within the trial groups. This method was proved as a simple tool to evaluate trial series and to provide straightforward information on varietal response to different environments (Schwarzbach, 2007). Figure 1. Standardised relative yield of 10 varieties in normal (A) and dry (B) conditions According to SRY, varieties with superior performance in all environments were identified, e.g. Meritto (aver.

SRY 112 %); varieties more suitable to favourable conditions, e.g. Hedvika (A site SRY 125 %, B site SRY 96 %) and Etela (A site SRY 109 %, B site SRY 98 %), and also a few varieties performing better under stress conditions, particularly Biscay (A site SRY 97 %, B site 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 A 2006 A 2007 A 2008 B 2006 B 2007 B 2008 S ta nd ar di se d re la tiv e yi el d (% ) Akteur Alacris Arida Biscay Cubus Dromos Etela Hedvika Meritto Simila</p><p id="Pg317">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Conclusions The performance of commercial winter wheat varieties grown under stress conditions was studied and compared with their performance in more favourable environment. The stress was induced mainly by the limited water availability during crucial stages of the plant development important for the yield formation. The most affected characters were grain yield, no. of ears per area and individual grain size. This indicates that the stress was present even before flowering (lower no. ear.m -2 ) and mainly during grain filling (low TSW). Some varieties with different response were identified using standardised relative yields, e.g. Hedvika which was well adapted to favourable environments, Meritto which shoved superior in both environments, and Biscay which might have specific adaptation to harsh conditions. With predicted climate changes and more frequent periods of drought not only high yielding varieties, but also those with a pattern of drought tolerance should be recommended to farmers.

The homozygous translocation line was selected from a heterozygous translocation line with the help of molecular markers and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using repetitive DNA probes. The wheat chromosome arm involved in the translocation was identified by FISH as 4BS. The barley chromosome segment could not be unequivocally determined with the hybridisation of the repetitive DNA sequences used in the present work (Afa family, pSc119.2, pTa71). The microsatellite marker analysis revealed the presence of an almost complete 7HL chromosome arm, but the centromeric region of 7HL was missing from this translocation line. The rearranged chromosome, identified as 4BS.7HL with a centromeric deletion of 7HL, represents a unique genetic material which can be used for the physical mapping of genes or genetic markers within 7HL. As the barley chromosome 7H is considered to be the most important chromosome for drought tolerance, the translocation line will make it possible to reveal the effect of the abiotic stress-related genes situated on the incorporated 7HL segment in the genetic background of wheat. Keywords: wheat, barley, 7H chromosome, translocation, microsatellite markers Introduction The wide hybridisation of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) opens up the possibility to transfer agronomically useful genes from related species into bread wheat. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), which is tolerant of various abiotic stresses and has good nutritional parameters, represents a potential gene source for wheat improvement. In order to transfer agronomically useful traits from barley into wheat a new wheat-barley hybrid was developed in Martonvásár (Hungary) by crossing the Ukrainan six-rowed barley cultivar Manas with the Japanese wheat cultivar Asakaze komugi (Molnár-Láng et al. 2000). After several backcrosses, wheat/barley addition lines were selected from the progenies. Wheat/alien addition lines are excellent genetic materials for studying the effect of alien chromosomes in the genetic background of wheat and they can be used as a starting point for gene transfer from an alien chromosome. Translocation lines can be selected from the progenies of addition lines. A spontaneous translocation was detected in progenies of the 7H wheat/barley addition line using GISH. The translocation line carries 42 chromosomes. The importance of the translocation line is that the long arm of the 7H chromosome is considered to be the most important genomic region for drought tolerance (Cattivelli et al. 2002). The objective of the present work was to identify the chromosomal regions involved in the translocation, and to detect which chromosome segments have been deleted from the Asakaze komugi/Manas translocation line using GISH, FISH and SSR markers. Materials and methods Plant material: A wheat×barley hybrid was developed previously in Martonvásár (Hungary) by crossing the Japanese wheat cultivar Asakaze komugi (Triticum aestivum L.) with the Ukrainian six-rowed winter barley cultivar Manas (Hordeum vulgare L.)</p><p id="Pg319">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 322 (Molnár-Láng et al. 2000). The hybrids were backcrossed twice with Chinese Spring wheat, and the translocation line was selected from the BC2 progenies (Molnár-Láng et al. 2005). GISH (Genomic in situ hybridisation): Total genomic DNA from the barley cultivar Manas and the wheat cultivar Asakaze komugi was isolated using the phenolchloroform method described by Sharp et al. (1988). Barley DNA was labelled with Fluorored (rhodamine-4-dUTP, Amersham) using nick translation. Wheat DNA was used as blocking DNA at a ratio of 30:1. The in situ hybridisation was carried out according to Molnár-Láng et al. (2000). FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridisation): The GISH hybridisation signals were washed off the slides in 4×SSC Tween at 25 ºC overnight. The Afa family, pSc119.2 and pTa71 repetitive DNA sequences were used for three-colour FISH. The probe labelling was carried out as described by Sepsi et al. (2008) and the in situ hybridisation experiment was performed according to Szakács and Molnár (2008). SSR marker analysis: Genomic DNA was isolated from three BC2 plants, from Chinese Spring and from Manas according to Anderson et al. (1992). PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25µl. The reaction mixture contained 25ng of template DNA, 2× GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, USA) and 0.2 µM of both primers. Amplification was carried out in an Eppendorf Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Germany), with the corresponding profile described previously for each primer pair. The following microsatellites were tested: 4BS-specific markers: Xgwm368, Xgwm113 (Roder et al. 1998) and Xbarc1045 (Sourdille et al. 2004); 4BL-specific markers: Xgwm149, Xgwm165 and Xgwm251 (Röder et al. 1998); 7HS-specific markers: HvM4 (Liu et al. 1996) and Bmag0021 (Ramsay et al. 2000); and 7HL-specific markers: HvID, Bmag0120, Bmac 0156 (Ramsay et al. 2000), EBmac0827, EBmac0785 (Rostoks et al. 2005) and GBM1102 (Varshney et al. 2006, Hearnden et al. 2007). The PCR products were separated using 2.5% SeaKem agarose (Cambrex, USA) gels and the fragments were stained with ethidium bromide. A 50bp DNA ladder (Fermentas, Lithuania) was used to estimate molecular weights. The patterns were documented and analysed using a GeneGenius gel documentation system (Syngene, UK). Results and discussion A wheat/barley translocation was detected by GISH using barley DNA as a probe (Fig. 1). Using three repetitive DNA probes, FISH identified the wheat chromosome segment involved in the translocation as 4BS. The presence of 4BS was confirmed with the 4BS specific markers (Xgwm368, Xgwm113 and Xbarc1045) and the lack of signals for markers mapped to 4BL (Xgwm149, Xgwm165, Xgwm251) proved the absence of 4BL. The barley chromosome segment could not be clearly identified using FISH, but the presence of an almost complete 7HL was proved by the signals given by four 7HLspecific microsatellites. The elimination of the centromeric region of 7HL was suggested by the absence of the Afa family signal characteristic of the 7HL centromere (Fig. 1). The 7HS-specific markers (HvM4, Bmag0021) gave no signals, indicating the elimination of 7HS. As a physical map of the 7H-specific SSR markers was not available, the position of the translocation breakpoint could not be compared to the breakpoint of known deletion</p><p id="Pg320">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 323 lines. The 7HL-specific SSR markers were selected from three genetic maps (Rostoks et al. 2005, Hearnden et al. 2007, Ramsay et al. 2000). Some of the markers were included in more then one genetic map, making it possible to compare their positions within different mapping populations. In the centromeric regions several markers were mapped genetically within a small distance of each other. Greater distances were found between markers in the middle of the chromosome arm, while in the telomeric region the markers were situated closer to each other. The FISH pattern of the translocation chromosome suggested the absence of the centromeric region of 7HL. Six 7HL-specific microsatellites were tested in order to identify the eliminated 7HL segment. Two of these markers (EBmac0785, Ebmac0827) were mapped to the centromeric region (Rostoks et al. 2005, Hearnden et al. 2007), a third marker (GBM1102) was positioned near the centromeric region (Varshney et al. 2006, Hearnden et al. 2007), two markers (Bmag0120, Bmac0156) were mapped near the middle of the chromosome arm (Ramsay et al. 2000, Hearnden et al. 2007, Karsai et al. 2007), and the sixth marker (HvID) was the most distal marker on 7HL (Ramsay 2000, Rostoks 2005). The SSR marker analysis confirmed the results obtained using FISH and proved the presence of an almost complete 7HL. The absence of two 7HL-specific markers from the translocation line (EBmac0785 and Ebmac0827), which were previously mapped genetically close to the centromere, revealed the absence of the 7HL centromeric region. The translocation breakpoint could be placed between markers Ebmac0827 and GBM1102 (Fig. 1).

Cereal Research Communications 324 Conclusions The 4BS/7HL translocation line described in the present study makes it possible to study the effects of genes situated on 7HL. Moreover, this is an excellent genetic material for the physical mapping of genes or molecular markers in the centromeric region of 7HL, which plays an important role in drought tolerance. It is planned to test the drought tolerance of the 4BS/7HL translocation line in order to study the effect of QTLs involved in drought tolerance in the genetic background of wheat.

Milan SKALICKY Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 165 21, Czech Republic, e-mail: skalicky@af.czu.cz Abstract: Weed beet has a negative effect on the sugar beet crop, especially as concerns competition for nutrients, water and light, which are the factors that significantly influence the yield. Chemical protection features the highest effectiveness on strongly weeded land (more than 1,000 individuals/ha); the application of non-selective herbicides (such as Roundup) during the period of blooming is most effective. The germinating capacity of the weed beet glomeruli exposed to total herbicides was tested. Provable differences in the germinating capacity were identified between the glomeruli exposed to the non-selective herbicides and the glomeruli that were not exposed to the herbicides (correlation to the herbicide application/BBCH phase). The differences in the germinating capacity within one BBCH phase can be explained by the varying size of the glomeruli. The big glomeruli (more than 4 mm) had the highest germinating capacity; there is a direct correlation to a higher content of reserve substances. The significantly different specifications of the morphological signs (shoot length, root length, root form) in weed beets exposed to a total herbicide (in the phase BBCH 65-69), with the consequence of being stressed, prove its significant influence on the growth and development of these plants. A high percentage of seeds (glomeruli) exposed to the herbicide survive even after repeated application of the herbicide (the effect of sclerenchyma pericarp in mature glomeruli) and maintain their high germinating capacity. Keywords: Beta vulgaris, glomerulus, herbicide Roundup, BBCH Introduction Weed beet can be determined by many physiological and morphological features, which, however, may not become manifest during its development all at the same time (e.g. Ungai and Sipos, 2008). Weed beet produces a great amount of seeds with various dormancy periods. Seed bank dynamics constitute a key process of the annual life-cycle because they determine not only infestation during the on-going year, but also the residual risk for subsequent years. As concerns cultivated beets, the germination capacity of their seeds was examined in many studies (e.g. Gummerson, 1986), but very little is known about the structure of the glomerulus and the germination capacity of weed beet. The main difference between cultivated seeds and weed beet seeds is the presence of primary dormancy in the latter, leading to the emergence of a permanent seed bank, with seeds being able to survive for several years. The standard included among the Czech State Standards does not permit any presence of weed beets. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic permitted an exception to this standard up to the level of 0.05% of weed beet seeds. This means 13 plants per hectare. According to researches undertaken in the United Kingdom, these 13 plants can produce up to 20,000 viable seeds; their annual mortality is 30% of the seeds (Longden and Breay, 1995). As opposed to cultivated beets, the weed beet seeds germinate in a large range of soil structure and climate conditions (Diprose et al., 1980). The objective of the experiment was to find out whether the glomeruli of weed beet, stressed by nonselective herbicides, have a significantly lower germination capacity than the glomeruli not exposed to herbicides. The objective was also to assess the changes of selected morphological features in the late stages of development with regard to the stress generated by total herbicides.</p><p id="Pg323">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 326 Materials and methods The defined issue was addressed experimentally. Weed beet (a form of the species Beta vulgaris L.) was the experimental plant. Its glomeruli were collected from the beet growing areas in the Czech Republic in the years 2005 and 2006. A glomerulus (also called “seedball”) is a cluster formed with two to six flowers aggregated during their maturation. Each flower forms a cavity called cell, which contain one seed if pollination is successful. Group A consisted of the glomeruli of weed beet. In BBCH 65-69 (full flowering – end of flowering, fruit set visible; Meier, 1993), they were treated by a spray of a total herbicide (Roundup Klasik, 480 g l -1 Glyphosate-IPA) and they were collected at the stage of BBCH 89 (fully ripe, seed coat final colour, perisperm hard). Group B (the control group) consisted of the weed beet glomeruli not exposed to total herbicides and collected at the same BBCH stage. The germination capacity was being identified in the glomeruli of weed beet under the controlled conditions in climate boxes by means of the standard methods defined in the ISTA rules (Don, 2006). The laboratory-stored glomeruli were tested after dormancy ended (8 months – in April 2006 and 2007). For germination test in the dark, glomeruli were laid directly on pleated paper (pleated strips, 113 g m -2 , double folds, 2,000 mm × 110 mm, 50S) in a plastic box with 30 ml of water to ensure non-limiting water conditions (50 glomeruli in one box). The boxes were closed hermetically to avoid water loss and placed in an incubator at 20 °C. All the handling actions were carried out in a dark room illuminated by a green inactinic lamp without any stimulating effect on germination as shown by Colbach et al. (2002). Every sample was prepared in 4 repetitions and within each taken sample (one plant), the glomeruli were divided into three size categories (category I – larger than 4.5 mm; category II – up to 4.5 mm; category III – up to 3 mm). Seed germination in the boxes in darkness was assessed every 7 days. The final count was carried out after 1 month. Germination assessment consisted in counting the newly protruding roots. From each monitored location, 30 weed beet plants exposed to non-selective herbicides and 30 weed beet plants not exposed to non-selective herbicides were taken at random for the purpose of phenotype observation. In each plant, its shoot length, root length and root form were identified. The features were sorted into categories and statistically assessed depending on the frequency in the given category of the feature, according to Skalický et al. (2007). A statistical evaluation was carried out by the analysis of variance with α = 0.05 in the Statistica software (8.0), using the ANOVA module. Results and discussion The germination capacity of the glomeruli of the weed beet exposed to non-selective herbicides was significantly lower than that of the unexposed glomeruli only in one size category (Figure 1). The germination capacity in group A I and B I was 56% and 73 %, respectively. In spite of the application of the Roundup herbicide, the weed beet retained its high germination capacity, especially in the glomeruli larger than 3 mm, which is probably related to the non-permeability of sclerenchymized pericarp of the glomeruli. In field conditions, this can be influenced by the method of applying nonselective herbicides and by other factors (climatic conditions, the height of the sugar beet plants, the experience of the persons operating the applicator, etc.).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 327 germination capacity levels of the weed beet glomeruli not exposed to herbicides correspond to the results of Sester et al. (2006). Even the glomeruli (group B) with a diameter of up to 4.5 mm retain high germination capacity (42 %). The glomerulus size cat. III had the lowest germination capacity in both groups (8 % in group A and 19 % in group B).

Cereal Research Communications 328 exposed to the herbicide have most often stems 100-130 cm long (mean: 118 cm). There are similar differences in root length where the plants exposed to the herbicides most often have a root up to 19 cm long (mean: 15 cm) and in the plants not exposed to the herbicide, the root length oscillates between 19 and 25 cm (mean: 21 cm). The pencilshaped form of the root (very long and thin) was observed most often (in both groups). In all the plants exposed to the herbicide, at least a part of their stems was yellowish or almost black. Conclusions Provable differences were identified between the germination capacities of the glomeruli exposed and unexposed to non-selective herbicides. The differences in the germination capacity within the same BBCH stage can be explained by the different size of glomeruli. Large glomeruli (more than 4 mm) displayed the highest germination capacity; there is a direct connection with the higher content of reserve substances. The significantly different levels of selected morphological features in weed beets exposed to a total herbicide (at the stage BBCH 65-69) and to the subsequent stress confirm its strong influence on the growth and development of these plants. Chemical protection, due to its high effectiveness, can be recommended for strongly weeded plots of land (more than 1,000 individual plants/ha); application of non-selective herbicides (such as Roundup) during the flowering period seems to be highly effective. A high percentage of the seeds (glomeruli) exposed to the herbicide survive even after repeated herbicide treatment (due to the effect of the sclerenchyma pericarp of the mature glomeruli) and retain a high germination capacity.

Their cumulative effects are expressed as a crop failure. However, the monoecious unisexual, wind-pollinated flower buds indicate high variability on phenology and fructification within the different varieties. The detailed variety examination opens potentialities for reducing the disadvantageous influence of the main stress factors. Keywords: walnut, stress factor, PSA, fertilization, productivity Introduction In the previous period the expectation has been increasing for higher-level intensity in the walnut growing. A major trend has been developed to enlarge the productivity by new varieties. Numerous breeding programmes have been started worldwide to improve the VCU (Value for Commercial Use) characteristics, using distant gen-source or imported (Martino 1994) the varieties directly. Although it was taken less into consideration that the walnut belongs to the botanical taxon Juglandaceae despite the fact that the majority of temperate zone fruit species are included in the Rosaceae. The taxonomical distance is accompanied by special characteristics influencing directly the productivity of the species (Soltész, 2003). Walnut trees are located in closed monoculture may suffer stress either from their own density-dependant self-regulating reproduction system (Szentiványi, 1990), or from other kind of well-known environmental factors, mainly diseases and late frosts (Simon, 2007), (Ripka, 2007). Their cumulative effects are expressed as a crop failure. The detailed variety examination opens potentialities for reducing the disadvantageous influence of the main stress factors (Szani, 2007). The objectives of this study are 1) to observe the adaptation of new varieties in a Central European walnut producer region, and 2) to present varietal differences under same biotic and abiotic stress, and 3) to discuss possibilities of reducing the stress-affect. Materials and methods We performed our walnut variety researches in Pölöske (Hungary), in the Trial Station of the Central Agricultural Office Hungary. The trial was planted in 1988. The plot design was a randomized complete block with 4 replications of 3 trees. All the trees were one-year-old grafted plants on walnut seedling rootstock. Each of them was spaced 8 m apart in 10 m rows. The training system was a minimum pruning. The impact of biotic and abiotic stress factors were observed on 11 walnut varieties bred in Central Europe and in the USA. The observation started in 1998, after trees came into bearing. The first step was testing varieties (VCU) between 1998 and 2005. From 2006 to 2008 the second step focused on detailed examination to clarify its flower-biological background. The flower-biological observation was made on 45 shoots, taken 5 parts from each tree of 3 replications. Diseases, as Walnut blight (Xanthomonas campestris pv. juglandis) and Anthracnose (Gnomonia leptostyla) attack on leaves were observed</p><p id="Pg327">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 330 in a spontaneous infection years. The data were evaluated with analysis of variance, based on an 11-year period. Observed varieties originated from different walnut producer regions of the world. It was tested and compared to the well-adopted native varieties (‘Alsószentiványi 117’ ‘Alsószentiványi 118 ’and ‘Milotai 10’), the imported high-fruiting varieties from the USA (‘Pedro’ and ‘Hartley’) with the new hybrids from crossing them (‘Milotai bıtermı’, ‘Milotai kései’, ‘M 10-25’, ‘Milotai intenzív’, ‘Bonifác’, ‘Alsószentiváni kései’). In the margin were collected dates from some further Central European walnut (‘Seifersdorfer runde’, ‘Jupiter’ and ‘Apollo’). Results and discussion Comparative analysis shows considerable varietal differences regarding production (Table 1). Within the new genotypes the increased fertility appeared accompanied by reduced vigour. The imported varieties and the hybrids are characterised by medium or even weaker vigor, however the growths are acceptable. In addition both of their total yield and the yield efficiency in relation to different vegetative attributes are significantly higher. On average the vegetative production has decreased with 30%, the generative production has increased with 100%. Although it has to allow for the realized production as a result of an extreme biotic stress factors. Table 1. Production biological description of walnut varieties. Pölöske 1998-2005.

Examination has revealed that ‘Alsószentiványi 117’ and their progeny (‘Bonifác’, ‘Alsószentiváni kései’) suffer less</p><p id="Pg328">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 331 from Gnomonia. Conversely ‘Milotai bıtermı’ and ‘Milotai kései’ have inherited susceptibility to it from ‘Milotai 10’. It has not proved any significant differences between susceptibility to Xanthomonas, although various courses of disease were noticed. Both of two pathogenic take obvious effect later on after flowering, destroying the thriving fruits. In our trial the disadvantageous high pollen-density had the definitive impact on realized production. Its stress expresses as PFA (pistillate flower abortion). Over the structural conditions of the trial, the PFA depends on the flower-biological characteristics of varieties (table 2). The varieties were grouped into 3 bearing-types based on predominant location of fruit buds according to UPOV (International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants) Guideline (TG/125/6). To the type 1 belong ‘Milotai 10’’ and ‘Alsószentiványi 117’, fruiting at tip of one-year old shoot. The type 2 contains ‘Hartley’, ‘Alsószentiványi 118’ and ‘Milotai kései’, fruiting in clusters. To the type 3 belong ‘Milotai bıtermı’, ‘M10-25’, ‘Milotai intenzív’, ‘Pedro’, ‘Bonifác’ and ‘Alsószentiváni kései’, fruiting on lateral brindles. The other Central European varieties, like ‘Seifersdorfer runde’, ‘Jupiter’ and ‘Apollo’ seems to belong to type 2. The time of male and of female flowering separated from each other on the same tree at the following proterandry hybrids: ‘Milotai kései’, ‘M10-25’, ‘Milotai intenzív’, ‘Pedro’ and ‘Bonifác’. Late-flowering helps to avoid the late frost, like in the case of ‘Bonifác’. (Average date of latest frost between 1998-2005 in Pölöske: 4.04.) Table 2.

Fruitbuilding and abcission on top and lateral buds. Pölöske, 2007-2008. Conclusions The breeder’s purpose of introducing higher fertility by distant gene source had been achieved. These have adapted well to the Central European climate. Phenological synchrony of female flowering with self male flowering, rate and distance from crosspollinator influenced basically the fertilization. However, the monoecious unisexual flower buds indicate high variability on phenology and fructification within the different varieties. The ideal pollen count should be the result of different varieties combining. This opens potentialities for reducing PFA and other stress factors.

The resistant ‘BKT9086-95’ line developed from the variety ‘Bánkúti 1201’ was crossed with the moderately FHB-resistant variety ‘Mv Magvas’ to create a single seed descent population for the purpose of studying the genetic background of resistance. Based on the results of artificial inoculation, 15 resistant and 15 susceptible genotypes were selected for the purpose of bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The bulk samples and the parents were analysed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method. The two bulk samples and the parents were tested with a total of 81 primer combinations, and an average of 5.02 deviations per reaction was found between the parents. AFLP patterns similar to that of the resistant parent were found in a further 16 cases. On the basis of the BSA results the testing of the whole population using the AFLP and simple sequence repeat methods has been commenced. Keywords: Fusarium head blight, QTL Introduction Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most important staple crop world-wide, with a total production of over 600 million tons annually. Since the green revolution in the 1960s the total yield quantity has increased by around 40%. However, consumption is also increasing at an accelerating rate, so the fight against biotic stress factors endangering yield quantity and quality is of key importance. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most important wheat diseases, leading to yield reduction and poor grain quality as well as contamination with deoxynivalenol (DON), which poses serious health risks when inhaled as dust or ingested as food by humans and livestock (Hornok et al. 2005, Reddy et al. 2008, Szabó-Fodor et al. 2008). Recent studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of F. graminearum is increasing in Central Europe and is now responsible for 90% of the losses, followed in importance by F. culmorum (Tóth et al. 2005). The presence of pathogenic fungus species is indicated by the discoloration of the spikelets and the spindle and by the whitening of the spikes. In infected spikes the grains are typically white or pink and have lower thousand kernel weight compared with healthy grains, leading to substantial yield losses. The efficiency of chemical control depends greatly on the time of application (Prigozliev et al. 2008) and the technology (Lehoczki-Krsjak et al. 2008). The greatest level of resistance is possessed by varieties from Asia (‘Sumai 3’ and its derivatives) and South America (e.g. ‘Frontana’; Bai and Shanner 2004). The agronomic properties of these resistance sources differ considerably from those of Hungarian varieties (thus lengthening the time required to breed resistant commercial varieties), while the European sources reported as resistant have proved to belong to at most the moderately resistant category (e.g. Arina; Ruckenbauer et al. 2001). Fusarium head blight (FHB) was first detected in Hungary in the 1920s, but the first nation-wide epidemic did not occur until 1970. This could be attributed not only to the introduction of more intensive cultivation techniques (soil cultivation, forecrops,</p><p id="Pg331">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 334 nutrient supplies, sowing date, seed quantity) and to weather conditions favourable for infection, but also to the susceptibility of the varieties (Kükedi 1988). The variety ‘Bezostaya 1’ was registered in Hungary in 1960, after which its sowing area increased rapidly until it occupied almost 80% of the total area (Koltay and Balla 1982). ‘Bezostaya 1’ is susceptible to FHB (Mesterházy 1986) and many scientists held this variety responsible for the epidemic in 1970 (Szunics and Szunics 1992). It was partly this that later caused the variety to disappear rapidly from general cultivation (Bedı et al. 2001). It was impossible to determine, however, what role the change of variety played in the spread of FHB. As the old Hungarian wheat varieties did not become infected in farmers’ fields, the question arises of whether this was due simply to a favourable constellation of various factors, or whether they had genetically coded resistance. The resistance of ‘Bánkúti 1201’ has been investigated in artificially inoculated trials for several decades and the variety is consistently one of the most resistant genotypes to this disease (Szunics and Szunics 1992). The homogeneity within populations of old Hungarian varieties is characterised by the fact that while they can be distinguished more or less on the basis of morphology, they are more heterogeneous for quality traits than modern plant varieties, on the basis of both biochemical and molecular markers (Vida et al. 1998, Rakszegi et al. 2000, Juhász et al. 2000). Materials and methods In the course of field testing, detailed examinations were made on several lines of ‘Bánkúti 1201’ origin. Known resistance sources and a susceptible control variety were also sown in the experiment and given the same treatment as the ‘Bánkúti 1201’ lines. Testing was carried out with single isolates of F. graminearum or F. culmorum in three replications. Bunches of spikes in the same stage of development were inoculated at flowering using a spore suspension with a concentration of 5*10 5 macroconidia/ml. Inoculation was repeated two days later. The degree of spike infection was evaluated on the 26 th day. Among the ‘Bánkúti 1201’ lines included in the experiment, ‘B9086-95’ proved to be the most resistant, with an FHB infection level of 10–20%. By comparison, the level was 1% for the resistant genotype ‘Sumai 3’ and 70–80% for the susceptible control. This line was crossed with several Martonvásár varieties. Among the combinations the FHB resistance of the parental genotypes differed to the greatest extent for ‘B908695’/’Mv Magvas’, so this combination was chosen for further analysis. Uniform lines developed from the progeny population using the SSD method were used to identify chromosome regions connected with the FHB resistance of ‘Bánkúti 1201’. The resistance of 250 SSD lines derived from this combination was tested in the greenhouse and field for the spread of Fusarium within the spike (Type II resistance). The ‘IFA-104’ F. culmorum isolate was used for artificial inoculation. Conidia were washed off the surface of infected seeds, after which the spore concentration was adjusted to 1 million/ml. Spikelets on the upper 2/3 of the spike were inoculated with 5µl conidium suspension on four plants of each line. The extent of Fusarium spike infection (severity %) was determined on the 21 st day after inoculation.</p><p id="Pg332">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 335 Results and discussion The level of spike cover was 36.7% in 2005 and 31.7% in 2006, averaged over the lines. Averaged over these two years, the infection levels of the lines, parents and control varieties ranged from 5.0 to 72.3%. Based on the mean data for 2005 and 2006 the ‘BKT9086-95’ parent had the lowest rate of infection (5.0%), followed by the resistance source ‘Sumai 3’ (6.37%). The infection severity of 36 lines did not differ significantly from that of the better parent (LSD5%=16.8). The difference between the rate of infection of ‘Mv Magvas’ and that of the resistant parent was more than double the significant difference (44.8%). Spike cover significantly greater than that of the susceptible parent was observed for six lines (Fig 1). The distribution of the lines in terms of spike infection did not differ from normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = 0.048 ns ). As there was a large interval between the lines with the best and worst FHB resistance and the population exhibited normal distribution, this line population was suitable for analysis at the molecular level, aimed at identifying DNA sequences related to FHB resistance. DNA was isolated from the plants examined in the greenhouse (Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini kit), after which bulk samples were made from the DNA solutions of plants with extreme values. Based on the ratio of infected spikelets and the Xu-Fan scale (field data for 2005 and 2006, greenhouse data for 2007), 15 resistant and 15 susceptible plants were selected for bulk segregant analysis. The bulk samples and the parents were analysed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method. The reaction products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gel using the Li-Cor 4300 DNA sequencing gel documentation system. The DNA of the four bulked samples and the parents was tested using a total of 81 primer combinations. An average of 5.02 diverse patterns per reaction was observed between the 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 -1 0 % 1 0 -2 0 % 2 0 -3 0 % 3 0 -4 0 % 4 0 -5 0 % 5 0 -6 0 % 6 0 -7 0 % 7 0 -8 0 % Spike cover do not differ significantly from the better parent Spike cover significantly greater than that of the susceptible parent FHB severity N o. o f ge n ot yp es Figure 1.

In the better parent and the samples formed from resistant plants, reaction products of the same size were found in 16 cases, which could indicate that Fusarium resistance has a genetic background. Averaged over the population, 8.7 different products per reaction were identified with markers giving patterns of the maternal type, and 40% of the polymorphisms observed were of this type (Fig 2.). The results confirm the presence of the genetic markers detected by BSA at the level of the whole population.

The degree of infection of three hybrids and their parental lines to fusarium stalk rot was tested by artificial inoculation with two Fusarium isolates (FG36, FGH4) over three years (2006–2008). The greatest level of infection was recorded in 2007, and FGH4 proved to be the more pathogenic isolate. When testing for resistance to fusarium stalk rot it is not sufficient to observe only natural infection levels, but testing with a single Fusarium isolate may be enough, if it is wisely chosen. The resistance level of the female parent is probably decisive in the inheritance of fusarium stalk rot resistance. Keywords: Fusarium spp., maize, corn stalk rot Introduction It is essential for Hungarian agriculture to prepare for the effects of current climate change, as all living organisms respond sensitively to a changed ecological environment. Experiments have shown that climate change will influence both the crops that can be grown and the yields of all major field crops (Harnos et al., 2007). Plant protection will also be affected. In addition to the appearance of new pests and pathogens, serious problems will also be caused by the resurgence of biotic stress factors for which the changed ecological environment is favourable. The dry weather of 2007 again drew attention to the importance of maize stalk strength, which is determined by two main factors: the mechanical structure of the stalk and fusarium stalk rot, which is caused by various species of Fusarium and Macrophomina (Koehler 1960, Christensen, Wilcoxson 1966). The degree of fusarium stalk rot infection depends greatly on environmental factors, the genotype × environment interaction and the resistance of the given maize genotype to the pathogens (Kommedahl and Windels 1981, Mesterházy 1983, Todd and Kommedahl 1994, Buhinicek et al. 2005, Palaversic et al. 2007, Szıke et al. 2007, Mesterházy et al. 2008, Reinprecht 2008). The present paper will discuss the importance of fusarium stalk rot in influencing maize stalk strength. Materials and methods Three single-cross hybrids and their six parental lines were inoculated with two Fusarium graminearum isolates (FG36, FGH4) in 2006–2008. The two isolates were selected as being the most aggressive on the basis of preliminary pathogenicity studies in the phytotron. The genotypes were sown in a split-plot design in four replications, with the maize genotypes in the main plots and the treatments (FG36, FGH4, sterile, natural infection) in the subplots. Inoculation was carried out on the 12 th day after flowering by placing infected wheat grains in the second internode from the roots on six plants per plot. The wheat grains were soaked in a 1 g/l N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide</p><p id="Pg335">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 338 sodium salt solution for 3 min and then rinsed twice with distilled water. The grains were then sterilised in a 60°C water bath for 2×5 min, after which they were placed in test tubes with 2 ml of a 10 6 conidia/ml suspension of the above isolates at 27°C for 14 days. Sterile wheat grains were placed in the maize stalks as a control, and natural infection was scored on the fourth plot. After placing the grains in holes made in the stalks with a 2 mm hand-drill, the holes were sealed with sticking plaster to prevent external infection. The collection and processing of samples was begun on October 10 th . The stalk samples were cut in half lengthwise and all the samples were photographed with a digital camera to determine the area of the lesions on the pith using the Colim 4.0 image analysing program. Percentage values were calculated from the complete area of the internode and the infected area. The data were evaluated using analysis of variance (Sváb 1981). Results and discussion In response to artificial inoculation both the hybrids and lines suffered considerable infection from the two Fusarium graminearum isolates, of which FGH4 proved to be more pathogenic at the LSD5% level of probability averaged over the whole experiment in the case of both hybrids (LSD5% = 5.034%) and lines (LSD5% = 3.203%). It is clear from Figure 1, however, that in 2008 isolate FG36 caused greater infection in both hybrids and lines, the difference being significant for the latter (LSD5% = 5.54%). The lines were more severely infected than the hybrids, the level of infection being 10% greater for the lines in 2006 and 2008, though in 2007 the level of infection was similar for lines and hybrids. A relatively high rate of infection was also recorded in both hybrids and lines after treatment with sterile grains (figure 1). This could be attributed to the fact that the experiment was set up on an area used as a pathological nursery for several decades (until the appearance of the corn rootworm), so the soil was heavily infected with conidia and chlamydospores. In addition European corn borer caused considerable damage, especially in 2007 (data not shown). The extent of natural infection in untreated subplots was 1.6%, averaged over genotypes and years. The greatest natural infection was recorded in 2007. 0 20 40 60 80 H y b ri d L in e H y b ri d L in e H y b ri d L in e FG36 FGH4 STER (% ) 2006 2007 2008 -10 10 30 50 70 2006 2007 2008 (% ) Hybrid Line Figure 1.

Due to the heat and drought stress at flowering there was a reduction in the carbohydrate content of the stalk tissues, which were destroyed to a great extent by the cell wall-decomposing enzymes of the Fusarium species playing a major role in the course of the disease (Szécsi 1985). In 2006 and 2008 the hybrids exhibited similar extents of infection (42.68%). The year effects were greater for the lines than for the hybrids, with infection levels of around 65% in 2007 and 2008 and 51.42% in 2006 (figure 2). An analysis of the infection of the hybrids and their parental partners (figure 3) revealed that, over the grand average of the treatments, the MV3 hybrid exhibited the greatest infection, followed by MV1 and MV2, but the difference between the hybrids was only significant between MV3 and the other two hybrids (LSD5% = 5.03%). More pronounced differences were observed between the lines. In the case of the most sensitive hybrid, the infection level of the parental lines was also the highest of all the lines. Lines E and F, which were the female and male parents of this hybrid, had the highest level of infection in all three years. A comparison between the natural infection and artificial inoculation data showed that these three genotypes tended to have a similar response to spontaneous infection with stalk rot. 0 20 40 60 80 M V 3 E F M V 1 A B M V 2 C D(%) 0 2 4 6 8 M V 3 E F M V 1 A B M V 2 C D(%) Figure 3. Level of infection of hybrids (green) and their parental components (female: red, male: yellow) averaged over treatments (left) and natural infection (right). For artificial inoculation, LSD5%=4.53% for lines and 5.03% for hybrids; for natural infection: LSD5%=2.54% for lines and 1.78% for hybrids. The parental components of hybrid MV1 (A and B) exhibited a sensitive response to artificial inoculation, but not to natural infection. Hybrid MV2 had the lowest level of infection, but again considerable differences were recorded for the response of the hybrid and its parental components to artificial inoculation and natural infection. These data draw attention to the fact that exact information on the resistance or susceptibility of a given population to stalk rot can only be obtained from artificial inoculation data. Due to the small sample number the present data are not suitable for drawing farreaching conclusions on the inheritance of stalk rot, but they suggest that the resistance level of the female parent is of prime importance. For hybrids MV3 and MV2 the female suffered greater infection than the male parent at the LSD5% level of probability. Conclusions Due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather conditions, renewed attention must be paid to the development of maize lines and hybrids with resistance to stalk rot. The present results indicated that both natural infection and artificial inoculation produced</p><p id="Pg337">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 340 the greatest level of infection in 2007, among the years tested. This year was ideal for the development of stalk rot (little rainfall at flowering, wet weather in the autumn months). Of the two F. graminearum isolates used for the artificial inoculation, although FG36 caused significantly greater infection to the lines in 2008, in 2006 and 2007 the FGH4 isolate was more pathogenic to both hybrids and lines. It is suggested that, it may be enough a single Fusarium isolate for the testing of breeding materials and hybrids, if it is wisely chosen. The high infection rate observed in the sterile grain treatment draws attention to the fact that the development of fusarium stalk rot is greatly facilitated by any type of injury to the stalk (pests, cultivation tools, hail), so the mechanical parameters of the stalk (thickness, strong outer layer) should also be considered in the course of selection. Natural infection data are not sufficient for successful selection for stalk rot resistance. The genotypes examined had different levels of resistance to fusarium stalk rot. The data suggest that the resistance level of the female parent could be decisive in the inheritance of fusarium stalk rot resistance, but further tests will be required to confirm this conclusion.

Abstract: We carried out foliar fertilization trials with copper-tetramine-hydroxide complex compounds on small plots with alluvial Danube soils of high CaCO3 content, alkaline pH and copper deficiency. Copper treatments were applied in the phenological phases of shooting and flowering. Applied copper doses amounted 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 kg/ha. In our investigations we searched for the symptoms of stress induced by higher copper doses on yield, gluten and raw protein content. Testing the yields we observed that higher doses at booting treatments resulted in gradually increasing yields. In treatments at flowering copper doses of 0.5kg/ha still increased yields but higher doses induced stress that produced a decrease in yields. Gluten content shows maximum curve as an effect of copper treatments at both booting and flowering. Maximum gluten content could be achieved at copper doses of 1.0 kg/ha at phenological phase of booting, and of 0.5 kg/ha at flowering. Raw protein content shows maximum curve similarly to the changes of gluten content in copper fertilization trials after treatments at booting and flowering. While a decrease in raw protein content was produced as a result of stress after treatments of 1.0 kg/ha at booting, lower copper doses of 0.5kg/ha reduced protein content after treatments at flowering. Keywords: wheat, copper, complex, yield, raw protein, gluten, stress Introduction Since the 30s many elements in plant tissues being present in small quantities proved to be essential besides macro-elements (NPK). Such an element is copper. Based on FAO testing soils in Hungary show a great level of copper deficiency, but even in soils of good copper supply can copper deficiency occur due to hindered transportation in winter wheat (Sillanpää 1982, Szakál et al., 2008). Copper deficiency result in hindering nitrogen up-take of winter wheat, which again result in minor quality and yield (Kádár and Shalaby., 1984). Copper has a very important role in plant biochemical processes therefore we need to consider an adequate copper supply of the plants. Copper can be replaced through soil or leaves. In foliar fertilisation nutrient uptake follows a similar mechanism to that of the roots. Ions and molecules get through the micro-pores of the cuticle. If we wet the waxen cuticle it will widen and open up lack of continuity and pores. Nutrients can get through the intercellular ways to the place of usage. Protoplasm selectively binds cations by passing down H + . Nutrient up-taking surface of the roots with root hairs are many thousand times bigger than leaves surface so leaf fertilization can only have a supplementary role in most cases. In foliar fertilization plants take up nutrients selectively according to their needs (Schmidt and Szakal 2007, Schmidt et al. 2008) Considerable effect could be attained through direct contact to metabolism. Both antagonism and synergism could be observed in nutrient uptake through the leaves (Pecznik, 1976). Radioactive test prove that substances put on leaves can spread very quickly in the leaves. Their uptake is greatly influenced by the form of compound and</p><p id="Pg339">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 342 ligand-effect (Hornik et al., 2008, Pipiska et al., 2008). The main problem of foliar fertilization is the sensitivity of leaves and possible stress effect. Stress effect is higher by metal salts (osmotic pressure) than by metal chelates, where metal is in organic bond. Metal chelates dissolve in the cells metal ions untie and build in. Stress can be reduced if we treat leaves with copper-ion-exchanged synthesised zeolite (Schmidt et al. 2008). Stress is a state of burden, where after an initial destabilization through a normalisation the resistance strengthens, but if exceeding the tolerance limit plants suffer from permanent damage or die. Weak antropogen stress on plants can activate cell metabolism, i.e. foliar treatments of low concentration have stimulating effects, but in larger quantities they damage the metabolic processes, reduce plant activities and a state of distress develops. Stress causes morphological, physiological and biochemical changes in plants. Responses induced by defensive mechanisms depend on the type and time of stressors and reproduction capacity of the plants (Lang 2002, Lichtentaler 1996). Stressors can change the red-oxy status within the plant cells and push metabolism into oxidative direction (Sies, 1991). The developed organic peroxides e.g. copper-, and ferro-, will be reduced to alcoxyl radical, which is able to start radical series of reactions. Materials and methods Trials were launched on 10m 2 plots of Danube calcareous alluvial soil in four repetitions in a randomised block design on winter wheat in Darnózseli in 2008. Table 1 shows the average composition of soil of high calcium content, alkaline pH and shallow tilth (40cm). The soil is poorly supplied with copper so the available copper content is around 0.6 mg/kg. We used copper tetramine hydroxide complex compound to replace copper. Copper complex was applied on the foliage in doses of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 1.0 and 2.0 kg/ha. Copper complex of 0.6 litres was sprayed on the leaf surface per plot. Plants on the control plots were sprayed with water of the same quantity. Trials were carried out in two phenological phases at the end of booting and at the beginning of flowering. At harvest we measured the yield and the raw protein and gluten content among parameters characterizing flour quality. The results were evaluated by analysis of variance. Table 1.

Our measurements covered the stress effects of increased copper doses. Yields Higher rate of copper doses applied in the phenological phase of shooting produced higher yields. The highest yield (4.62 t/ha) could be achieved by applying the highest copper doses (2.0 kg/ha). Higher copper doses did not show any damaging stress effects. The applications at flowering showed the stress effects of higher copper doses. As a result of higher copper doses yields (4.92 t/ha) increased up to copper doses of 0.5 kg/ha according to maximum curve. Higher doses of 1.0 and 2.0 kg/ha induced stress and reduced the yields. At copper doses of 2.0 kg/ha resulted in stress effects that produced yields (4.22 t/ha) lower than the control (Table 2). Table 2.

Data in Table 2 show changes in raw protein content due to copper doses applied at shooting and flowering. Raw protein changed according to a maximum curve due to copper doses applied at booting. Copper doses of 1.0 kg/ha produced the highest raw protein content (13.25 %) then as a result of stress raw protein content decreased at higher copper doses. Copper doses of 0.5 kg/ha applied at flowering produced the maximum rate of raw protein increase. Stress due to copper doses of 1.0 and 2.0 kg/ha resulted in gradual raw protein decrease. Gluten content Gluten content is of outstanding importance among the parameters determining flour quality. Table 2 shows the changes due to copper-tetramine-hydroxide foliar treatments in two phenological phases. After foliar treatments applied at booting higher doses increased the gluten content (1.0 kg/ha) gradually. Due to copper doses of 1.0 kg/ha gluten content achieved a value of 33.37 % compared to the value of 31.4 % measured on the control plot. As a result of the treatment with 2.0 kg/ha copper doses the gluten content reduced. More efficient</p><p id="Pg341">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 344 increase could be achieved with copper-complex treatments in the phenological phase of flowering. Maximum gluten content could be achieved by 0.5 kg/ha copper doses, where the rate of increase in gluten reached 7.5 % compared to the control. Wheat plants respond to higher copper doses very sensitively, the resulted stress induces a gradual decrease in gluten content. Conclusions Comparing the effect of applications of copper on the yield in the two phenological phases we can conclude that the treatment applied in the phenological phase of flowering was more efficient than the treatment applied at booting. Lower copper doses resulted in higher yields, but higher doses of copper treatment caused stress that resulted in gradually decreasing yields. Copper doses applied at flowering produced a much higher increase in raw protein content than lower doses applied at booting. Treatments at flowering resulted in stress effects at lower copper doses than treatments at booting. Regarding the gluten content, in both phenological phases we measured the highest value at the 0.5 kg/ha copper dose which was statistically significant as well. The 2 kg/ha copper dose due to stress effects reduced the gluten content already. References Hornik M. – Pipiska M. – Vrtoch L – Sekácová J –Augustin J –Lesny J.: 2008.

Every times when we mow the turf we cut down from the plant and it is becomes a lost assimilative surface of leaf what the plant try to compensate to grow new shoots as a result of this the needs a larger amount of nutrient supply which means stress for the roots and in totality for the whole plant. Keywords: turf, cut, fertiliser, weed, biodiversity Introduction In our interpretation the turf is a type of grassland what we maintain with regular and professional mowing. The beautiful green turf is a determinative element in the garden (Hessayon, 2002). The topsoil is one of the most important components in grassland and sustains the sward physically, chemically and biologically (Szemán, 2007). The lawn needs to be fertilized to maintain colour, density and vigor. The healthier and more vigorous a lawn is, the better it can withstand stress from heat, drought, traffic and pets. We often try to achieve a dark green lawn, but the darkest green lawn is not always the healthiest lawn. The nitrogen is the most important element what is responsible for green colour and the vegetative growth. At each mowing we have to count with 1g/m 2 nitrogen agent need (Gruber, 1964). The most important element of the intensively used sport fields sports grass is the nutrient supply of the soil of the pitch (N:P:K), which greatly adds to the colour, density, solid of the grass, as well as to the stress caused by drought and cold (Németh, 2006). Though all three elements are important in maintaining the healthy turf stand nitrogen will result the greatest response (Szemán, 2007). With the help of a computer model, the potential grass yield gets easily calculable depending on the changing climatic factors (Antal, 2007). The other important question is the weeds. The control of weeds is an essential aspect of productive agriculture. Weeds compete with grass for moisture, light and nutrients. (Velkoska et al. 2008) We can install the grass with seed or sod. Seedling establishment should be managed in field situations to avoid or minimize the negative effect of light competition on RWR seedlings. For example, the use of companion crops to reduce weeds, hold erodible soil against wind erosion, or produce an economic return during the establishment year should be avoided due to competition and light quality effects on seedling growth. Weed control through herbicide application or tillage should be practised so that competition is minimized even where there are generally open canopies.

It has sited in fall 2000 from a “park” type mixture (40g/m 2 ) which contains: rye-grass (Lolium perenne):20%, red fescue (Festuca rubra) + (Festuca heteophilla Lam.):70%, meadow-grass (Poa pratensis) 10%. The experiment placed on fourteen parcels, seven were cut by rotary mower and seven were cut by push reel mower. The Turf was sustained by regular mowing in the rhythm of growing grass. The height of turf in case of rotary mower was 50 mm, while in case of reel mower it was 27 mm. Mowing below the optimum height restricts root growth and increases susceptibility to damage from insects, disease, drought, and traffic (Reicher Bigelow, 2006). Mowing of turf started in the middle of April. Only 30 % of the vegetation was removed by mowing so at least 23 of the leaves were always left on the blades of grass. We call this the rule of one third. Every time in each parcel mowing was performed by a grass collecting mower. Yield was measured in every parcel at times and regularity listed in the table while weight of green mass was indicated in the table and illustrated in the diagram. The first fertilization was made in 7 th of May with all types of fertilizers, than 2 more times with Ammonium-nitrate 25 th of June and 18 th of August. Watering happened occasionally when the stress of droop appeared. Weighting of green mass for data collection and color measurement happened 16 times. Count of shoots and separate to monocotyledon and dicotyledonous happened 3 times. Results and discussion We examined the effect of mowing and the fertilizers onto weeds practised. We indicated the results in the cover percentage of the parcel.(Figure 1,Figure2) when we fertilized with ammonium-nitrate. It is manifest from the results, those parcels where AN. treated and deeper (27mm) cut the crab grass (Digitaria sanguinalis) reaches 10% cover while on the rest of the parcels 5% cover it significantly shows a value. Similarly the taller one cut (50mm) case. Plantago, appearance because of a mowing altitude independently the Sb. 8-9 were frequent on handled areas. The examination aims the annual graminaceous received emphasized importance weeds (Poa annua) and the allergen weeds (Ambrosia artemisiifolia/elatior) the watch of these spreading in the lawn. In the deeper cut lawn the soil warms up much more easily so rising one-year biological cycle weeds so called technological weeds break out from the seed in this manner. If the lawn thick enough oppresses these races, then in this manner on the area (Ambrosia aremisiifolia/elatior) and (Poa annua) did not appear. The density of the lawn was expected and positive phenomenon for us for peoples. But in terms of grass races forming lawn the mowing is a continuous stress against, what they have to defend themselves. They have to live and multiply, their genetics dictates this. Offspring are pushed because of this by what it is increased the cover of the soil and a flower tries to be yielded because of this even under the lawnmower. As a result of the decay of the condition of the useful grass races the perennial multypling root ones (Convolulus arvensis, Achillea millefolium) and sarmentous races (Trifolium repens) could gain ground. Against them only with agricultural engineering without herbicides only, we were not able to protect the useful grass in the turf. Because</p><p id="Pg344">VIII.

The deficiency of the nutrients primarily the nitrogen, Trifolium repens breaking out was growing in a big measure visibly on the roads between the parcels. The other “newcomer” races appearance those places where the turf opened caused by mole digging and therefore the seeds of these species can germinate. The nitrogen from the ammonium-nitrate was able to be released soon than the resin coated from artificial fertiliser with a husk. The nitrogen was released due to the moisture more quickly and washed into the deeper layers of the soil, where the graminaceous grasses were not able to assimilate it. The symptoms of turning yellow appeared because of this. The 90% of the roots of the grasses grows in the soil top 020cm zone. Even the three times spread ammonium-nitrate were not able to provide constant enough nitrogen, so the Digitaria sanguinalis and Echinochloa crus-galli weeds could appeared in the turf.

Hungary 4 Hungarian Meteorological Service Abstract: The UV-radiation is especially high in the flowering period of the maize, in June, July and August. It can be considered as a very significant abiotic effect from the point of view of the longevity of pollens. The big amount of the vital pollens is the precondition of the suitable quantity and quality of the produced seeds. Our researches were carried out in the years 2003-2005 in Martonvásár, in the Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the course of our laboratory surveys we have experienced that the viability of pollen of the six surveyed parental lines decreased heavily owing to UV-radiation. But the measure of this is highly dependant on the crop-year effect, furthermore the weather sensitivity of the parental lines was very different. Keywords: maize pollen viability, UV-radiation, drought stress, in-bred lines Introduction Pollen is an important vector of gene flow in maize (Zea mays L.). The maize pollen is desiccation intolerant and has a high settling rate. (Luna et al, 2001) Maize is one of the most important cultivated crop plant species in our country and in the world considering the role it plays in human consumption and in animal feeding as well, moreover it is getting more and more significant as a source of energy nowadays. The most favourable dry matter production and leaf area index dynamics were recorded for high rates of NPK fertiliser in wet years and for farmyard manure in dry years. (Micskei et al, 2008) Good nitrogen and water supplies promote a rapid initial growth in the leaf area index of maize, allowing optimum LAI values to be maintained with good biomass duration. This is favourable for the flow of assimilates into the grain (Berzsenyi et al., 2007). Hybrids are produced today on a major part of the sown area due to their high crop yield and other favourable features. Due to this fact there is a great demand on seeds. Seed production in general and hybrid maize seed production in particular, as well as breeding and production of maize have a significant impact on crop production of Hungary. In case of Hungarian climatic conditions, rainfall and temperature are the two essential factors determining near the corn growth the average yield mass development (Izsáki, 2007; Surányi, 1957 in Pál-Fám et al, 2008.) Flowering is a critical phase of seed production regarding the quality as well as the quantity of the crop. In the literary review the phases of seed and hybrid production and the biology of corn plant especially the inflorescence and pollen have been discussed. Since flowering is a very significant phase of hybrid production as well as seed production a brief review of the subject has been compiled. A more specific survey of the biology of pollen provides a tool to the evaluation of the experiments.</p><p id="Pg347">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 350 Materials and methods Experiments were conducted to investigate the duration of pollen viability and the effectiveness of UV-radiation. The experiments have been carried out in Martonvásár, in the research area of MTAMGKI and in Gödöllı, in the laboratory of SZIE-NTTI. The parental lines of three wide spread maize hybrids have been studied. Four of them are inbreed lines and two are single-cross lines. The pollen production ability of the lines and the exfoliation of them have been measured and the duration of pollen vitality under laboratory circumstances has been observed in the years 2003-2005. The pollen production and the duration of vitality have been evaluated considering the weather effects, using data of UV-radiation. We used TTC (triphenyle-tetrazonium-chloride) to dye the viable pollen grains, every 30 minutes, for two hours. We counted the number of viable pollens under microscope, with the help of a Bürker-chamber. Results and discussion The year 2003 was the most droughty in the three years period of the examination. It has been stated, that the lines named B022 (inbred parental line) and F066 (single crossed parent) produced the biggest quantity of pollen in these year. We measured the number of pollen sin 1 mg pollen, and we can say that the highest number of pollen grains was in the case of lines B022 and F066. Line B022 produced 17500 pieces/mg, the F066 15417 pieces/mg. These values were significantly higher than the pieces / mg pollen of the other parental lines.

Cereal Research Communications 352 Based on our three figures it can be concluded that UV radiation has significant effect on pollen viability. When comparing the three years’ measures, it can be seen, that the level of UV radiation was the lowest in the first year at the time of measurement (4 July 2003, Figure 1). The highest radiation level has been observed in the third year (29 July 2005, figure 3). With medium level radiation in the second year the pollen viability was favourable (6 August 2004, Figure 2). This can be explained by the fact that in this year the weather conditions provided nearly ideal performance for maize pollination processes. Conclusions Based on the results of our studies, we can conclude that from the line studies that the pollens of Line B022 and Line E055 are the most resistant against drought. In all three years of the study these lines were the most resistant against weather conditions, both in respect of the drought and the UV radiation. These lines are worth to be considered as subjects of future studies, and breeding works.

SZABÓ – Antal VÉHA University of Szeged, Faculty of Engineering, 6725 Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 5-7., e-mail: szpb@mk.uszeged.hu Abstract: Quality in general is the sum of characteristics. In this work factors of complex quality have been examined. The factors, which determine the wheat quality, can be sorted into two groups, the natural factors and the growing factors. The natural factor (rainfall, temperature, air) determines the varieties and the growing technology. The growing factor (variety, seed, sowing-time, nutrients etc.) determines the profit. The wheat was harvested at two different times, and was grown by the same agro-technological treatments. Before the harvest we examined the kernel, we get information about the possible injury. After harvest we examined the gluten characteristics, the alveograph and valorigraph performances. The effects of varieties were dominating, but there was a strong influence of the weather, since the harvest was delayed and so the plants were exposed to a lot of rain. Yield is an economic index and it is a connection with the kernel hardness, the order of the varieties shows it. In this study we examined these parameters, and the connection among these factors. Both natural and growing factors proved to be stressors influencing wheat performance. Keywords: harvest time, climate factor, wheat Introduction In Hungary there is a one phase harvest, so we have to determine the optimum harvest time. This time is, when there is a beginning of the whole ripening. In this time the biological value of the wheat is good. In USA, GB, Canada, there are two phase harvests. In the first step they harvest the wheat in a wax ripening and after 3-5 day, when it is dried, they are threshing. The advantages are the dried weeds and the good quality. But if it is raining the grain quality and quantity may get worse and it needs more work, because you have to go to the land twice and it causes more cost. We have to choose the right harvest time; it has to fit the variety in favour of good quality and quantity. We need to plan the harvest, but the weather may change that. Some research examines the harvest time and its effects to the wet gluten, the hectolitre and the baking parameters. Hectolitre weight and baking parameters are worst in the overripen phase. The different consumption habits do require diverse quality, and thus the quality behaviour must be permanent. To maintain this permanency in biological system is far too difficult, since different conditions, i.e. the agricultural land use, the weather, etc have all significant role in variance of quality factors (Szabó 1986). Pollhamerné (1981) sorted the agricultural impacts into two groups. In the first group is the agro technical factors (sowing time, artificial fertilizer, seed grain amount, etc.), in the second group is the effect of the land. The differences between the two groups are that the effect of land is given. The agro technical factors are changed by us, so the quality of wheat is influenced. The natural factors and the growing factors determine the quality of the wheat. The natural factor determines the varieties and the growing technology. The growing factor determines the profit. Natural factor determines the yield. The chemical reaction of the soil is an important thing. Rain full determines the yield and the results of the fertilizer. If there isn’t water in the beginning of the growing, the plants will be residual. The temperature determines develop of the plant. The light gives energy and</p><p id="Pg351">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 354 determines the growing of the plants. The air content is permanent. Near the soil the air content is changing. The growing factors are as follows: variety, seed, soil tillage, seedbed, precrop, sowingtime, nutrients, fertilizer, care of plants, etc. Materials and methods Eleven different registered bread wheat varieties with diverse technological qualities were used in this study. The samples were provided by the Cereal Research NPC, Szeged, in Hungary, and included the following varieties: GK Garaboly, GK Békés, GK Kalász, GK Verecke,GK Holló, GK Ati, GK Petur, GK Nap, GK Élet, GK Csongrád, GK Hattyú. We examined the Hardness index with the Perten SKCS 4100 (Perten Instruments, Sprinfield, Illinois, USA) instrument is one of the well know machines, which examine the kernel hardness. Brabender ® Quadrumat ® Senior (Brabender GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Duisburg, Germany) laboratory mill was used to determine the milling properties and the flour yield of the different types of wheat. Ash content refers to the mineral content of flour. It depends on many factors, such as the variety of wheat, the fertilization, the climate, etc. The gluten index (GI) was examined by Glutomatic 2200 (Perten Instruments AB Huddinge, Sweden). The farinograph determines dough and gluten properties of a flour sample by measuring the resistance of dough against the mixing action of blades. Absorption is the amount of water required to center the farinograph curve on the 500-Brabender unit line. We used the Brabender ® farinograph (Brabender GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Duisburg, Germany). We used Chopin Alveorgraph NG (CHOPIN Technologies, Villeneuve-la-Garenne Cedex, France) the alveograph test were determined according to the EU-Standards. The alveograph determines the gluten strength of dough. It is measuring the force required to blow and break a bubble of dough. The results include P Value, L Value, P/L Value and W Value. Statistica 8.0 (StatSoft, Inc. Tulsa, USA ) and Microsoft © Office 2003 Excel software for Windows were used to perform statistical analyses. The wheat was tested for significance using analysis of variance techniques (ANOVA). A level of significance of P &lt; 0:05 is used throughout the analysis. Results and discussion The crop land was: 6729 Szeged, Alsóváros’s black soil 39. The soil type was loam font soil, the thickness of the topsoil was 30-35 cm, and there was P and K supply. The fore crop was oil radish. The wheat was harvested at two different times: o Bemutató 2 (Bem 2): 7th July 2005. o Bemutató 3 (Bem 3): 18th July 2005. The physical, physicochemical and baking characteristics of the 11 varieties in research have been evaluated.

Varietal impacts were proven to be dominant, but there were effects caused by rain that occurred betweenthe two harvest dates. Hardness Index, the gluten characteristic, the alveograph and valorigraph (water absorption capacity) performances have been evaluated. There were two significant correlations between impacting factors and quality; the Hardness Index decreased and W value of alveograph performed similarly. References Bedı Z.: 2003.

There are two very important concepts of sward composition. One is that pasture composition moves toward equilibrium with the environment. The second is that botanical composition is a dependent variable and not a driving variable in the climate – soil – plant - animal system. Sward composition reflects what happening to the system. With financial support from the “GAK, JUHFETA4” an experimental trial has been carried out at the grassland of AWASSI Rt. The objective was to investigate the relative effectiveness of fast-acting fertilizers and farm manure treatment to control the changes of rangeland sward composition by the effect of summer rainfall. There were control, and five fertilizer 100kg N ha-1, 100kg P ha-1, 100kg K ha-1, 100kg NP ha-1, 100kg NPK ha-1 and one farmyard manure 10 t ha-1 year-3 treatments. The botanical composition and the biodiversity components of the plots were recorded three times every experimental year. The diversity of the flora was reduced by the introduction of grassland fertilization, and was improved by the farmyard manure application. Keywords: rangeland, stress effects, diversity, precipitation, fertilization Introduction The botanical composition of natural grasslands is a result of several ecological effects. (Frame, 1992, Szemán, 2007). Factors determining the diversity of species are characteristics of the soil, nutrient and water supplies, (Stekauerová, et.al. 2007) the terrain and precipitation. (Centeri et.al. 2007, Szabó et.al.,2007, Várallyay, 2007, Haynes, et.al.1993, Tasi, 2007, As the plant stand reaches its climax, the botanical composition of the grassland can be considered permanent, because it reaches equilibrium with its environment. This stabile state changes due to external interventions. Gradual changes result in an even reaction. Occasional (Szemán, et.al.2007, Penksza, et.al.2007) yearly changes, however, can develop stress in the botanical composition and diversity of the plant stand. The strongest environmental effect is represented by grassland management (Benyovszky, et al. 2007) as an activity of agricultural production. Grassland management is a process based on grassland plants as biological bases, utilizing the crop produced through grass production (Rutkoviene, et.al. 2007, Haynes, et.al 993) by farm animals. Of all procedures of production technology, manuring changes (Kádár, 2007) the ecological nutrient level of the soil and through this the botanical composition and biodiversity of grasslands. (Herczeg, et.al. 2006, Pajor, et.al. 2007) Nutrient supplies can either be artificial fertilizers or manure. The yearly changing dose of nutrient supplies (Csatho, et.al. 2007) presents a stress for the plant stand, but original plant composition returns as fertilizing is discontinued. Among the active agents, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium play major roles in the change of biodiversity determined by precipitation (Ľubomír – Hallett, et.al. 2007) conditions.</p><p id="Pg355">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 358 Materials and methods Diversity and cover of grass species were determined on species rich natural grasslands in Bakonszeg which neighbour the Hortobágy, during two growing seasons characterising different summer precipitations (rainy summer of 2006 and dry summer of 2007: 570 mm and 370 mm of annual rainfall, respectively). The top layer of the meadow solonetz soil was of clay texture, with a humus content of 4-5%. Seven fertilization treatments (Table 1) were used. The basic plot size of fertilization was 5x5 m and was replicated three times. The botanical composition and the biodiversity of the plots were recorded three times in each experimental year. The effects of nutrients have been influenced by precipitation. Depending on the weather, we can talk about rainy, rainfall deficient and dry (arid) years. Years when the amount of rainfall deviates from the average either in a positive or a negative direction, impose an abiotic stress effect on the biodiversity of grasslands, this is why we examined the effect of the 2006 rainy summer (570 mm) and 2007 year dry summer (370mm) on the effect of artificial fertilizers and manure. Results and discussion The botanical composition of the grassland included first rate bottom and top grasses, secondary Festuca species, perennial and annual forage legumes, as well as valuable dicotyledons and weeds. Table 1. The growing season and annual precipitation and fertilizer treatment on Sward composition changes The botanical composition (table 1.) of control plots consisted of 12 grass species, 3 perennial legumes, 8 annual legumes, 7 other dicotyledons (forbs) and 3 weed species. As a result of nutrient applications, the number of species in the grassland changed.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.2 359 On the control plots, precipitation caused an increase in the number of species, while the lack of precipitation caused a decrease. This change has been indicated primarily by annual leguminous species. The number of grass species was not influenced by either nutrient supply or the precipitation in a given year. The botanical cover of some species increased by the use of nitrogen, while potassium and phosphorus did not have the similar effect. The effect of fertilizers was enhanced by rainy years, and reduced by dry years. In dry years, the decrease in the botanical cover of primary grass species was significant, while the cover of secondary grass species did not increase significantly in rainy years either. The use of nitrogen resulted in a decrease in the number of perennial leguminous species. The application of different fertilizers caused a change in the number of annual legumes only in rainy weather. When using nitrogen, the number leguminous species decreased or they disappeared. Applying manure, phosphorous or potassium promoted their appearance in grasslands. In dry weather, legumes disappeared from all plots. The use of artificial fertilizers decreased the number of dicotyledonous species in the grassland. This change was reinforced by the lack of precipitation. Some species disappeared, while some species appeared. Rainy periods caused an increase, while deficiencies in the rainfall caused a decrease in the number of species of dicotyledons on the treated plots. The number of weed species decreased on plots where artificial fertilizers were applied, while it increased on plots where manure was applied. Convulus arvensis could only be identified on plots where nitrogen fertilizers or manure was applied. The change of precipitation had no effect on the number of weed species. Conclusions Results ( table 1.) of our research clearly identify stress effects on plants. The application of fertilizers did not have an effect on the number of grass species, therefore the nutrient supplies with the doses and active ingredients applied in our trial cause no stress effect for grasses. The change in the precipitation of each year caused no changes to the number of grass species either, so it can be concluded that grassland species tolerate the abiotic stress caused by the changes of weather. This proves the fact that extreme weather effects can regularly occur in the area. The stress tolerance of perennial legumes towards nitrogenous fertilizers is enhanced by surplus precipitation. Annual leguminous species do not tolerate stress caused by artificial fertilizers. Abundant precipitation causes no stress for legumes, while dry weather is not tolerated by these species. The number of weed species remained unchanged in grasslands, but their botanical composition changed as a result of stress caused by nitrogenous fertilizers. Depending on the type of active ingredient used, certain weed species disappeared, while others appeared. The application of manure improved the number of species, therefore it did not have as strong a stress effect as active ingredients applied in the form of artificial fertilizers.</p><p id="Pg357">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

YIELD Helga KLUPÁCS – Ferenc H. NYÁRAI – István BALLA – Márton JOLÁNKAI Crop Production Institute, Szent István University, Gödöllı, Hungary and HAS-SIU Agronomy Research Group, Gödöllı, Hungary Abstract: Moisture availability is a major stressor in relation with yield quality and quantity performance of winter wheat. In a 12 years experimental series of winter wheat agronomic trials run at the Szent István University’s Nagygombos experimental site effect of water availability has been evaluated. Various crop years have had different impact on crop yield quantity. Yield figures were in positive correlation with annual precipitation in general. Water availability had diverse influence on quality manifestation. High precipitation has often resulted in poorer quality, especially gluten and Hagberg values have been affected by that. Drought stress reducing the amount of yield has induced quality improvement in a few cases. Keywords: water availability, wheat yield, quality, quantity, drought stress Introduction Availability of water is a major stressor in relation with yield quality and quantity performance of winter wheat. Cereals represent a most plausible source of human alimentation in the World. Wheat provides a basic staple for mankind. This crop is one of the most important cereals in Hungary with a high economic value. Utility, market and alimentation value of the crop is highly affected by climatic conditions and within that annual weather performances, as well as soil moisture conditions (Ács et al., 2008; Koltai et al, 2008; Skalová et al, 2008; Várallyay 2008). The aim of wheat production is twofold; to provide quantity and quality. Milling and baking quality of wheat is mainly determined by the genetic basis, however it can be influenced by management techniques (Pollhamerné, 1981; Nagy et al., 2006, Varga et al., 2007; Vida et al., 1996). The aim of this study was to determine the role of water availability impacts on wheat quantity and quality. Since main quality indicators - protein, farinographic value, gluten content, Hagberg falling number - have a rather diverse manifestation, there is a need to gain more information concerning the behaviour of them. Materials and methods In long term field trials a wide range high quality winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. varieties were examined under identical agronomic conditions in the experimental years of 1996-2007. The small plot trials were run at the Nagygombos experimental field of the SZIU Crop Production Institute. Soil type of the experimental field is chernozem (calciustoll). Experiments were conducted in split-plot design with four replications. The size of each plot was 10 m 2 . Plots were sown and harvested by plot machines. Various agronomic treatments were applied to plots. Weed control (fluroxipir, bromoxynil, dicamba and MCPA a.i.), the rate and application time of nitrogen top dressing (ammonium nitrate 0-40-80 kgha -1 in direct and split applications), fungicides and insecticides (triadimefon, tebukonazol+triadimefon, bensultap a.i.) were applied in single and combined treatments. Precipitation records have been evaluated in relation with yield quantity and quality. Protein, farinographic value, wet gluten content and</p><p id="Pg359">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Results and discussion Annual amounts of precipitation and winter wheat yields have been examined in a 12 years time range at the Nagygombos experimental field of the Szent István University, Gödöllı.

In 1999 year, when 837 mm rainfall, the highest in the period examined was recorded, however a sever drought spring was followed by an extreme moist summer obstructing yield formation and ripening as well as harvest. Figure 2 provides examples regarding interactions between annual precipitation and nitrogen supply.
