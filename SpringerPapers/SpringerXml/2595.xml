However, most of these coherent excitons have only been observed in some low-dimensional semiconductors when coupled with cavities, as there are large inhomogeneous broadening and dephasing effects on the transport of excitons in their native states in materials. Here, by confining coherent excitons at the 2D quantum limit, we first observed molecular aggregation-enabled âsupertransportâ of excitons in atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) organic semiconductors between coherent states, with a measured high effective exciton diffusion coefficient of ~346.9âcm<sup>2</sup>/s at room temperature. This value is one to several orders of magnitude higher than the values reported for other organic molecular aggregates and low-dimensional inorganic materials. Without coupling to any optical cavities, the monolayer pentacene sample, a very clean 2D quantum system (~1.2ânm thick) with high crystallinity (J-type aggregation) and minimal interfacial states, showed superradiant emission from Frenkel excitons, which was experimentally confirmed by the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) emission, highly enhanced radiative decay rate, significantly narrowed PL peak width and strongly directional in-plane emission. The coherence in monolayer pentacene samples was observed to be delocalised over ~135 molecules, which is significantly larger than the values (a few molecules) observed for other organic thin films. In addition, the supertransport of excitons in monolayer pentacene samples showed highly anisotropic behaviour. Our results pave the way for the development of future high-speed excitonic circuits, fast OLEDs, and other optoelectronic devices.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Excitonics: Supertransport in 2D organic semiconductor</title><p id="Par2">Scientists have detected excited quasi-particles, called excitons, moving far and fast in a two-dimensional organic semiconductor, paving the way for applications in quantum computing and fast light emitting diodes. Yuerui Lu of the Australian National University and colleagues conducted tests in a 2D sample of pentacene, an organic semiconducting compound made of benzene rings fused into a chain. Light particles are absorbed by pentacene, generating excitons that can be used to develop tiny, very fast, energy-efficient optoelectronic devices. The team found that excitons move through the crystal depending on the temperature and pentaceneâs molecular arrangements and order of crystallinity. The long-range and fast migration of excitons in a monolayer of pentacene was at least an order of magnitude higher than in other materials. The excitons in the pentacene monolayer also generated sharp, strong âsuperradiantâ light emissions.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>116</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41377_2020_Article_347.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Applied and Technical Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Classical and Continuum Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Physics and Astronomy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Recently, there has been increasing interest in harnessing the long-range and fast transport of coherent excitons (electron-hole pair quasi-particles) in solid-state inorganic semiconductors and molecular systems with confined geometries to enhance light-matter interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Coherence is critical to engineering the quantum electrodynamics (QED)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> in low-dimensional systems, such as quantum wells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, two-dimensional (2D) materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, leading to various applications in realising quantum memories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, single-photon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, laser cooling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, narrow linewidth lasers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, high efficiency solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and stable polaritons to achieve Bose Einstein condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Long-range and fast migration of coherent excitons also has tremendous applications in schemes of high-speed excitonic circuits, quantum computing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and high quantum yield light-emitting diodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Spontaneous coherent emission from a system of several non-interacting dipole active atoms (excitons) was defined as superradiance (SR) by Dicke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In this phenomenon, interactions between transition dipoles of individual molecules allow coherent delocalisation across multiple sites. This leads to a net enhancement in the optical transition dipole moment (TDM) and a sharp enhancement of the excitonic radiative decay rate of an ensemble of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> independent emitters compared to the radiative decay rate of a single emitter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The same principle of coherent delocalised superradiant emission gives rise to an analogous phenomenon called cooperative energy transfer or supertransfer (ST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The resulting enhanced oscillator strength from delocalisation over large molecular assemblies can lead to large-scale exciton transport. In an ST process, the molecular assemblies (consisting of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> molecules) with comparable net TDMs can play the role of acceptors similar to individual molecules in the FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, the excitation (exciton) can be transferred over much longer distances in a delocalised molecular assembly before annihilation, resulting in large effective exciton diffusion coefficients.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, coherent exciton transport with highly enhanced effective exciton diffusion coefficients (3â70âcm<sup>2</sup>/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> was observed in quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) molecular assemblies (cylindrical bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, nanotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and wires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>), and these coefficients were significantly higher than the migration speeds of incoherent excitons reported in other materials, including conventional organic thin films and their heterostructures (0.001â3âcm<sup>2</sup>/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, IIIâV semiconductor quantum wells (0.1â10âcm<sup>2</sup>/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and phosphorene (0.01â14.5âcm<sup>2</sup>/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, etc. (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>). However, the migration speeds of the coherent excitons in these quasi-1D systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> were still hindered by the low overall exciton oscillation strengths (low coherence length with small <italic>N</italic><sub>c</sub> values), which were mainly limited by the low quantum confinement of excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (diameter size &gt;12ânm) and potential disorder and interfacial sites in the systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Additionally, these quasi-1D systems had very small cross-section areas for light-matter interactions, limiting their applications in future excitonic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. As predicted by theory, the exciton oscillation strength, a key parameter for coherent excitons, is very sensitive to the quantum confinement of the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, confining coherent excitons at the 2D quantum limit is a very promising way to realise long-range and fast transport of excitons; moreover, the 2D structure can also provide a large cross-section area for light-matter interactions, enabling tremendous applications in future excitonic devices.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, in atomically thin organic molecular crystals without any optical cavities, we observe long-range and fast migration of Frenkel (FR) excitons between coherent states at the 2D quantum limit. A very high effective exciton diffusion coefficient of ~346.9âcm<sup>2</sup>/s at room temperature is reported, which is one order of magnitude higher than the values previously reported (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>) for other materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The sharp, strong emission arising from J-type (monolayer, shortened as 1L) aggregation in pentacene in contrast to the emission arising from H-type (wetting layer, shortened as WL) aggregation is confirmed to be superradiant emission from FR excitons. The coherence in 1L pentacene samples is determined to be delocalised over ~135 molecules, which is more than one order of magnitude larger than the values (a few molecules) observed in other organic thin films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Our simulation results from quantum calculations attribute this to the constructive dipole coupling in the J-aggregates in 1L pentacene that forms an enhanced net optical dipole moment, which supports our experimental observations. The supertransport of excitons observed on the macroscopic scale will enable realisation of strongly enhanced light-matter interactions at the quantum limit using such 2D organic materials, which has key applications in developing high-speed quantum computing devices, fast response time OLEDs, excitonic transistors and other optoelectronic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample growth and characterization</title><p id="Par7">Single-crystal pentacene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was epitaxially grown layer by layer on a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) surface with atomic smoothness and well-defined crystal facets.

Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the presence of pentacene on h-BN (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). PL spectroscopy with a continuous-wave 532ânm excitation laser was used to characterise the excitonic emissions from the atomically thin pentacene layers. The WL region showed much stronger PL emissions than the 1L region at room temperature (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> and associated text). Compared with inorganic TMD 2D semiconductors, WL showed a much broader PL spectrum at room temperature, which is associated with the various band energy levels formed in pentacene due to vibronic couplings between FR and charge-transfer (CT) excitons (Supplementary Information note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the 1L region showed a single peak centred at ~680ânm that corresponds predominantly to FR excitonic emission, which will be explained later. This region is a heterostructure consisting of 1L on top of WL. However, in the PL spectrum from the 1L region, we did not see the higher-energy emission (~â550â650ânm) observed in the WL sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) because the photoexcited charges in the WL underneath could be quickly transferred to 1L before radiative emission occurred (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). Therefore, the PL spectrum measured from the 1L region comes from the 1L pentacene sample and reflects its intrinsic nature.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Characterization of atomically thin 2D layered pentacene samples.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Optical microscope image of the sample used for measurements.

To confirm this coherent superradiance from 1L, we measured the temperature-dependent lifetimes of two excitonic emissions from WL and 1L pentacene samples using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements with a resolution of 2.1âps after deconvolution (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). The lifetime observed for the 1L pentacene sample significantly dropped from ~12.7âÂ±â0.8âps at room temperature to ~4.1âÂ±â0.7âps at 77âK (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). To further confirm the measurement accuracy of the lifetime, we performed time- and spectrally resolved differential transient reflectance (TR) measurements on WL and 1L pentacene samples at 77âK using a pump-probe technique with a time resolution of 200âfs. The 1L pentacene sample showed a clear dip in the differential TR mapping centred at 677ânm; in contrast, the dip was not clear for the WL sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>). The relaxation of this feature in the 1L sample followed a fast decay (lifetime of ~4.2âÂ±â0.53âps; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Fitting of the decay curve was performed using a single exponential decay and a 95% confidence interval, giving an estimated lifetime range of 3.6â4.7âps (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). Further details about the measurements and the fitting are explained in Supplementary Information Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref> and the associated text. The consistency between the two complementary techniques confirms the accuracy of our lifetime values measured with our TRPL system. The significant reduction in the emission lifetime with decreasing temperature is consistent with the observed sharp rise in the PL intensity in the 1L pentacene sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), confirming the fast and radiative nature of the decay, as expected for superradiance.</p><p id="Par11">Furthermore, the radiative lifetime of singlet FR excitonic emissions in bulk pentacene thin films (which are non-coherent monomer states) was experimentally established to be ~1200âps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We also confirmed the lifetime in our bulk thin film pentacene grown on the same h-BN substrate, which was measured to be 1241.1âps at room temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref> and associated text). The significantly reduced lifetime (~12.7âps) in our 1L pentacene sample compared to the value (~1200âps) for the non-coherent states in thin film pentacene, coupled with the consistent temperature-dependent PL emission and lifetime, further substantiates superradiant emission from 1L pentacene. The value of <italic>N</italic><sub>c</sub>, as extracted from this sharp reduction in lifetime, was ~100 at room temperature, which is again in close agreement with the aforementioned extracted values based on the highly enhanced PL intensity and reduced FWHM with decreasing temperature. In contrast, the lifetimes for the WL pentacene sample were measured to be 2.89âns using TRPL at room temperature and 2.64âns at 77âK (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), much larger than the values from the 1L pentacene samples, confirming the non-coherent nature of the CT excitons in the WL samples.</p><p id="Par12">We further performed PL measurements with angle-resolved excitation and emission polarisation (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>) to confirm the anisotropic nature of the superradiant FR excitonic emissions from 1L.

The theoretically predicted strongly directional total TDM in 1L pentacene (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3a</xref>) is expected to lead to an in-plane anisotropic emission of the FR excitons. Henceforth, the zero-degree reference in the polar plots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) and subsequent figures can be identified as the <italic>b</italic> axis of the unit cell in 1L pentacene (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3a</xref>). The directional emission in the 1L pentacene sample was independent of the excitation polarisation angle of the incident laser (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>). A similar anisotropy for the PL emission from 1L pentacene was observed for 1L samples at room temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>). Normally, the dichroic ratio (<italic>DR</italic>) is a term used to characterise the in-plane anisotropy of optical transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here, it is defined as DRâ=âI<sub>â¥</sub>/I<sub>â¥</sub>, where I<sub>â¥</sub> and I<sub>â¥</sub> are the PL peak intensities measured at polarisation angles of 0Â° and 90Â°, respectively. The measured DR values of PL emission from 1L for emission (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, blue curve) polarisation at 77âK were high, up to 10.3, which indicates the strongly anisotropic nature of the PL emission from 1L. At room temperature, the DR value observed for 1L samples was close to 5.9. In sharp contrast, the DR values measured from the PL emission in WL pentacene were isotropic both at room temperature and 77âK (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, red curve), which suggests that these peaks are dominated by the contribution of CT excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

Using the lifetimes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), the extracted diffusion coefficients for the 1L and WL pentacene samples at 77âK were 354.5âÂ±â50.1âcm<sup>2</sup>/s and 3.5âÂ±â0.2âcm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> value obtained from 1L is almost one order of magnitude higher than the values reported for other organic/inorganic systems with coherent and delocalised excitonic emissions (3â70âcm<sup>2</sup>/sec, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. At the same time, this value is ~3 orders of magnitude higher than the diffusion constant reported for non-coherent singlet excitons in bulk thin film pentacene by Marciniak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The exciton diffusion coefficients in WL and 1L at 77âK were further corroborated by another alternative method, spatial-temporal mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which is a very robust method for accurately determining the exciton diffusion coefficient in similar materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows the experimental setup used for spatial-temporal mapping, and the obtained data plots stitched together are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>. (See Methods section) The diffusion coefficient extracted from the spatial-temporal mapping was obtained by extracting the Gaussian dispersion of the emission profile over time and was consistent with our reported values obtained from the time-resolved PL and diffusion mapping in space technique, highlighted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The diffusion coefficients for 1L and WL were 306.8âÂ±â14.1âcm<sup>2</sup>/s and 3.3âÂ±â1.1âcm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively, as obtained from the slope in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>. It is important to remark here that the initial diffusion value for WL was non-zero due to cooling of hot CT excitons in the &lt;4âps regime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. As discussed earlier in this report, WL is predominantly CT exciton dominated. For CT excitons in the initial few hundred femtoseconds to few ps regime, the CT excitons undergo cooling or lose excess energy due to the creation of many intermediate energy states between S<sub>1</sub> (natural excited exciton energy state) and CT states, and they are all electronic states that excitons can quickly jump to in a few ps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, due to excitons residing on two different molecules, the extent of movement is also enhanced. All of this occurs in a few hundred femtoseconds to a few ps; hence, the non-zero value in WL can be attributed to hot CT exciton states cooling rapidly to intermediate energy levels created due to H-type aggregation and donor/acceptor-mediated hopping of excitons. Once the initial cooling occurs, the excitons then stabilise and diffuse normally. Since this non-zero transport occurred within the few ps regime, it did not affect the accuracy of our measurement of the exciton diffusion coefficient in WL, where the diffusion stretched to the few hundred ps-ns regime. In 1L samples, which are predominantly FR exciton dominated, we did not observe such non-zero transport at <italic>t</italic>â=â0, as the hot CT excitons were practically non-existent there. The results further confirm the effectiveness of our technique in measuring precise exciton diffusion with a high resolution and the limited role of triplet fission in our samples.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Exciton transport mapping using near-field imaging.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Measured contour plots of PL intensity as a function of emission wavelength and space of exciton diffusion for 1L (<bold>a</bold>) and WL (<bold>b</bold>) pentacene samples at 77âK.

The reason we were able to achieve these large effective exciton diffusion coefficients is threefold. First, in our 1L pentacene samples, the strong intermolecular coupling (J-type aggregation) results in a strong net exciton oscillator strength and thus delocalised and superradiant excitonic emissions. Within each delocalised segment, the excitation energy propagates ballistically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, in contrast to the diffusive-hopping-described FRET. Delocalised excitons in principle accelerate energy transfer compared to incoherent molecular hopping transfer because delocalisation can define an effective hopping length that is much larger than the nearest intermolecular spacings (Supplementary Information note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Second, because of the high-quality epitaxial 2D growth, our pentacene samples have highly ordered crystallinity and minimised defects/disorder, resulting in long delocalisation lengths and large coherence lengths (<italic>N</italic><sub>c</sub>â~â135, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>, extracted from temperature-dependent PL line strength measurements), which significantly benefit the transport speed of coherent excitons. The exciton delocalisation length is defined by competition between intermolecular coupling and disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which can be clearly seen from the comparison between the PL spectra from high-quality and low-quality samples. In some 1L samples with low-quality growth, the FR exciton peak at ~680ânm was weak; instead, high-energy CT peaks appeared in the PL spectra (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>; Supplementary Information note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Compared with the high-quality 1L pentacene samples, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, these low-quality 1L samples showed a broader peak and a lower PL peak intensity at 680ânm and longer radiative lifetimes of the FR excitons (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S13</xref>), which was caused by the reduced coherence length in the low-quality 1L samples. In the experiment, we also found that the disorder and interfacial states increased as the sample thickness increased, which led to decoherence and reduced exciton delocalisation length in thick samples, such as 2L and bulk samples (both had J-aggregation). The 2L pentacene sample also showed a sharp emission peak at 680ânm, but the peak had a slightly larger width and a much lower PL intensity compared to 1L (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>). Additionally, bulk pentacene showed a broad PL emission, and the 680ânm emission peak was almost negligible (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>) due to the significantly reduced coherence length caused by the disorder and interfacial states in the sample, similar to other bulk organic thin films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In comparison, the 1L PEN sample showed a very strong and narrow linewidth PL emission at 680ânm, which is a key characteristic of coherent emission. Thus, the lack of crystallinity, presence of more defect sites, inhomogeneous growth and high thickness compared to the 2D state lead to loss of coherent states in bulk thin film pentacene samples. Of course, our 1L samples were not perfect. There is still much room to improve the sample quality, which might give us a higher coherence length and a longer exciton diffusion length. Third, the quantum confinement of the system is beneficial to the speed of exciton transport since the confinement can increase the exciton oscillation strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (Supplementary information note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). Our 1L pentacene samples (~1.2ânm thick) have intrinsically high confinement at the 2D quantum limit. Moreover, the excitons in 1L are highly anisotropic and can be aligned in a quasi-1D space along the <italic>b</italic> axis, which further increases the confinement of exciton transport in 1L pentacene. In summary, structural uniformity with a defect-free interface, highly confined excitons and excellent intermolecular coupling (large oscillator strengths) results in the supertransport of excitons in 1L pentacene. On the other hand, the diffusion coefficient (3.5âcm<sup>2</sup>/s; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) of the CT excitons in the WL sample was also much larger than that of other similar CT excitons reported recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Even though no coherence was observed in WL, the strong spatial confinement of the excitons (~0.6ânm thick) and the almost defect-free interfaces in WL samples led to long and fast propagation of long-lived CT excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The high diffusion length obtained in WL PEN samples is critical for applications in high efficiency solar cells and charge separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In addition, waveguiding effects can be excluded, as the thicknesses of the 1L and WL pentacene samples were &lt;1.5ânm and that of the h-BN layer underneath was only ~4ânm (measured by AFM), thus making them insufficient for any light trapping and waveguiding, similar to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par15">It is important to remark here that the observed diffusion corresponded to bright singlet excitons in our 1L and WL pentacene samples and that the long-lived triplet excitons generated via the singlet fission in pentacene did not affect the diffusion measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The reasons are twofold. First, the triplet states are non-radiative dark states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and cannot be detected by the confocal photoluminescence setup we employed for our measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Second, the regeneration of emissive singlets via subsequent triplet fusion is not allowed in pentacene, and singlet fission in pentacene is expected to be exothermic and unidirectional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> because the relaxed triplet in pentacene has significantly less than half the energy of the singlet. This is in contrast to the situation in tetracene, where the near-degenerate singlet and triplet-pair energy levels permit both singlet fission and triplet fusion to occur.</p><p id="Par16">It is also important to remark here that the observed supertransport of excitons in 1L pentacene should be related to the unique properties of singlet fission in pentacene. First, singlet fission in pentacene, a fast non-radiative decay, occurs within a time scale of ~80âfs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. On the picosecond time scale, the singlet fission in pentacene thin films has a very small total yield of ~2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In our 1L pentacene sample, both our pump-probe (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and TRPL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> inset) measurements showed a monoexponential radiative decay of ~4âps, which indicates minimal contribution of non-radiative singlet fission mechanisms in the 1â10-ps regime, consistent with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Second, our 1L pentacene sample at 77âK showed a much stronger PL intensity than our 2âL and bulk pentacene samples (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>), which suggests a highly reduced singlet fission rate in our 1L sample. This could be attributed to the minimised disorder in our 1L samples and the impact of molecule packing on singlet fission in organic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Of course, further exploring the aggregation and layer-dependent singlet fission in 2D pentacene samples would be a very interesting future topic.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Superfast and angle-dependent transport of coherent excitons at room temperature</title><p id="Par17">Semiconductors with long-range and fast transport of excitons at room temperature are critical for future high-speed excitonic circuits and quantum computing devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> that can operate at room temperature. Here, we also observed superfast and angle-dependent transport of excitons from 1L pentacene samples at room temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In our measurement system, the polarisation angle of the incident laser was fixed to be parallel to the diffusion mapping direction. The exciton diffusion lengths and effective diffusion coefficients along two axes (<italic>b</italic> and <italic>a</italic>, labelled as 0Â° and 90Â°, respectively) of the pentacene unit cell were measured by rotating the sample with respect to the polarisation of the incident laser. The measured exciton diffusion length for the 1L pentacene sample showed a maximum value of 0.93âÂ±â0.09âÎ¼m along the <italic>b</italic> axis (0Â°) and a minimum value of 0.37âÂ±â0.02âÎ¼m along the <italic>a</italic> axis (90Â°; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, c</xref>).

We successfully identified molecular aggregation-sensitive PL emissions in atomically thin single-crystal organic semiconductors with different types of aggregation (H- and J-type) at the 2D quantum limit. The 1L pentacene samples with J-type aggregation (FR exciton dominated) showed superradiant emission, which was experimentally confirmed by the temperature-dependent PL emission, highly enhanced radiative decay rate, significantly narrowed PL peak width and strongly directional in-plane emission. This can be attributed to the constructive dipole coupling in the J-aggregates in 1L pentacene that forms an enhanced net optical dipole moment. The excitons in 1L pentacene samples were determined to be delocalised over ~135 molecules. In addition, the supertransport of excitons in monolayer pentacene samples showed highly anisotropic behaviour. On the other hand, the WL pentacene samples with H-type aggregation (CT exciton dominated) showed fast migration of isotropic CT excitons with a measured diffusion coefficient of ~â2.4âcm<sup>2</sup>/s at room temperature, a few times larger than that reported for other similar CT excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Our results provide an important experimental demonstration of the long-range and superfast transport of excitons between coherent states at the 2D quantum limit, paving the way for promising applications in future high-speed excitonic circuits, quantum computing devices, fast OLEDs, and other optoelectronic devices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Material growth</title><p id="Par19">Few layer h-BN samples were prepared by mechanical cleavage method and placed onto a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer which was thermally grown; 285ânm in thickness and deposited over a silicon substrate.

Pentacene samples (Chem Supply: P0030-1G) were then deposited over exfoliated h-BN which were placed in the centre of vacuum tube in furnace. The h-BN samples were then placed around 15âcm downstream in the vacuum tube, and a pressure of ~10<sup>â4</sup> mbar was achieved in quartz tube using a molecular pump.

A charge-coupled device (CCD) Si detector was used in conjunction with a 532-nm diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser which was used to excite the samples. For low temperature (above and at 77âK) measurements, the samples were placed in a microscope-compatible chamber with a temperature controller (which used liquid nitrogen as the coolant). For polarisation dependent measurements the incident angle of polarisation of laser was controlled by a half-wave plate, and the angle of polarisation on the emission side (<italic>Î¸</italic>) was then determined using a polarizer which was angle-varied and placed in front of the detector. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed using a setup that incorporated Î¼-PL spectroscopy and a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system. Pulsed laser which was linearly polarised (frequency doubled to 522ânm, with a 300-fs pulse width and a 20.8-MHz repetition rate) was channelled to a high numerical aperture (NAâ=â0.7) objective (Nikon S Plan 603). The PL signal was then gathered by a grating spectrometer, thus either collecting the PL spectrum through a charge-coupled device (CCD; Princeton Instruments, PIXIS) or detecting the PL intensity decay using a Si single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) and the TCSPC (PicoHarp 300) system. The double exponential decay from 1L PEN is attributed to the biexponential decay in the instrument response function (IRF). The double exponential decay in the IRF is due to the delay in the response timings of the MPD SPADÂ® photon detector and the PicoHarp 300 coupled to it.
