    , Accepted 26th February 2020First published on 28th February 2020AbstractTetrathiafulvalene (TTF) has been one of the most well-studied heterocyclic compounds since the discovery of the electrical conductivity of its charge-transfer complexes in the early 1970s. As the half unit of TTF, 1,4-dithiafulvene (DTF) presents an excellent organic electron donor and hence has been widely utilized as a functional molecular building block in the design of advanced organic electronic and optoelectronic materials. In the early years of DTF chemistry, research efforts were mainly focused on the development of π-extended TTFs as well as related donor/acceptor (D/A) functionalized π-conjugated systems. Meanwhile, studies dealing with the redox-activity and reactivity of DTF have also progressed significantly over the past few decades. With the growing understanding of the fundamental properties of DTF, the past ten years have witnessed significant advances in the development of DTF-based organic π-conjugated materials and related optoelectronic devices with novel properties and enhanced performances. This review is aimed at reviewing the new chemical properties and reactivities of DTF disclosed in the recent literature as well as highlighting the molecular design, synthesis, and application of state-of-the-art DTF-containing organic π-conjugated materials.
1 Introduction
Sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds have found extensive applications in modern synthetic, materials, biological, and medicinal chemistry. Among the vast number of sulfur-based heterocycles, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF, see Scheme 1A) stands out as the most well-known and thoroughly investigated system in the literature.1–7 Ever since the seminal work by Wudl and co-workers on TTF in the early 1970s,8,9 enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the subject of TTF-based functional π-conjugated materials and molecular devices. TTF contains two non-aromatic 1,3-dithiole rings which can be sequentially transformed into aromatic dithiolium rings upon oxidation. Because of this property TTF shows excellent electron-donating ability and has been widely used as a π-electron donor in many redox-active π-conjugated materials and molecular electronic devices.

The half structure of TTF, 1,4-dithiafulvene (DTF, Scheme 1B), is also a very interesting organic functional group. The unsubstituted parent DTF molecule is 2-methylene-1,3-dithiole, which was only theoretically investigated in the early literature in terms of its structural and thermochemical properties.10,11 Based on nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) and isomerization stabilization energy (ISE) calculations, Nielsen and Sauer proposed that the 1,3-dithiole ring in unsubstituted DTF behaves in a similar way to that in TTF, which renders DTF a good organic π-electron donor as well.12 Much research has been conducted on DTF derivatives, in which the 1,3-dithiole unit is linked to other functional groups through π-conjugation. The π-extension in various DTF derivatives not only improves their stability, but also enriches their synthetic accessibility, electronic properties, and redox activities. For these reasons, functionalized DTFs, like TTF and its derivatives, have also been widely used as molecular building blocks in organic conjugated materials. Conceptually, the DTF group can be integrated in π-conjugated molecular systems through three main connection motifs as illustrated in Scheme 1B. In motifs I and II, the DTF group is directly connected to a π-conjugated unit via covalent linkages (e.g., C–C bond) at the vinylidene position, while in motif III π-extension is achieved through fusion of the 1,3-dithiole ring with other conjugated structures. When multiple DTF groups are connected to a π-unit in a conjugated manner, the resulting systems in many cases can be viewed as π-extended analogues of TTF (often referred to as ex-TTFs), which have attracted enormous attention in the field of TTF chemistry. A number of important review articles has been published previously to cover this vibrant research topic.13–16 To differ from previous reviews, this account thus focuses on the recent advances in DTF-functionalized molecular and macromolecular systems mainly carrying the structure of motif I.
2 Synthetic methods for DTF-functionalization
The first synthesis of DTF was reported by Kirmse and Horner17 in 1958. Photolysis of 4-phenyl-1,2,3-thiadiazole (1) led to thiokene 3 through Wolff rearrangement, and the combination of 3 with a biradical intermediate 2 subsequently yielded diphenyl-substituted DTF 4a (Scheme 2A). However, this method was not suitable for DTF-functionalization due to low yield and lack of control over stereoselectivity. More practically useful synthetic methods were later developed based on the Wittig-type olefination reactions. In 1971 Hartzler reported a one-pot synthetic method for 2-benzylidene-1,3-dithioles (i.e., phenyl-substituted DTFs).18 The reaction involved two steps: (i) cycloaddition of an aliphatic phosphine–CS2 complex with acetylene to form a phosphorane intermediate, and (ii) the Wittig reaction with a benzaldehyde counterpart. Later, Cava and co-workers19 devised a modified approach to conveniently prepare 1,3-dithiol-2-yl phosphonium salts (e.g., 8 in Scheme 2B) by protonation of the phosphorane intermediates with HBF4. These phosphonium salts can be readily converted into Wittig reagents under basic conditions, hence allowing olefination to occur with various aldehydes and ketones of choice. A plethora of similar types of phosphonium salts and phosphonate reagents were thereafter prepared, making Wittig-type olefination a dominant synthetic methodology for DTF-functionalization on π-conjugated systems. In 2007, Bryce and co-workers20 reported a phosphite-promoted olefination method, in which a 1,3-dithiole-2-thione (e.g., 10) was directly reacted with a ketone or aldehyde substrate in the presence of P(OMe)3 or P(OEt)3 to achieve DTF-functionalization (Scheme 2C). There are several advantages for this method: (i) the method is one-step and quite straightforward to execute. (ii) There are a vast number of π-conjugated ketones and aldehydes available, which greatly benefits the structural design and modifications of DTF-functionalized π-systems. (iii) The 1,3-dithiole-2-thione precursors can be readily synthesized and easily tailored. For these reasons, the phosphite-promoted olefination reactions have become a highly popular DTF-functionalization strategy in recent years. Indeed, most of the examples of DTF-functionalized systems highlighted in this account were prepared through this efficient synthetic method. Moreover, a double S-vinylation approach can be useful for post-olefination functionalization.21–23 This method uses 1,2-benzenedithiol to react with a gem-dihalovinyl system (e.g., Scheme 2D). The resulting DTF product features a π-extended benzo[d][1,3]dithiole structure. Recently, the groups of Morin and Nielsen respectively demonstrated that this reaction could achieve highly efficient DFT-functionalization on large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cores, such as anthanthrene and tetraceno[2,1,12,11-opqra]tetracene, under very mild conditions.24,25 It was noted that the reaction could be used to handle some challenging DTF synthesis where Wittig-type and phosphite-promoted olefination methods failed.

3 Properties and reactivities of DTF
DTF has long been known as an electron-rich heterocycle which can readily release an electron upon oxidation. In their 1958 paper, Kirmse and Horner17 reported that DTF 4a could be oxidized into a reddish-violet salt, and they ascribed this observation to an oxidative dimerization reaction. In 1974 Mayer and Kröber26 examined the oxidation of a series of diaryl-substituted DTFs (4a–d, Scheme 3) and elucidated the structures of oxidized products as 15a–d based on elemental and UV-Vis absorption analyses. A detailed mechanism was proposed therein, suggesting the oxidation of DTF first generates a radical cation which subsequently dimerizes to form a stable dication salt. The aryl group attached to the vinyl position of DTF is believed to facilitate the electron transfer to form the radical cation intermediate, while the presence of a vinyl proton is essential for the elimination step to yield stable dication product. Mayer and Kröber26 also pointed out that this dimerization reaction has “preparative interest and allows access to electron-rich butadienes and novel heterocycles”.
 Scheme 3  Oxidative dimerization of DTFs. 
The oxidative dimerization of DTF can be induced by a variety of oxidants such as (BrC6H4)3SbCl6,27,28 I2,29,30 Br2,31,32 and AgBF4.33–35 Electrochemical conditions were also found to promote DTF dimerization reactions, affording TTF vinylogues (TTFV) as products.36–39 In 1996 Hapiot et al.40 investigated the mechanism of DTF oxidative dimerization by means of cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis. Their studies showed that a fast single-electron transfer first generates a radical cation species, which rapidly forms a protonated dimer (see Scheme 4A). This protonated dication then slowly deprotonates into TTFV, which is quickly oxidized into a stable TTFV dication at a potential lower than that for the starting DTF. Fig. 1 illustrates the cyclic voltammogram of a para-CN substituted phenyl-DTF (DTF-CN) measured at a low scan rate (0.2 V s−1). On the first anodic scan, an irreversible peak appears at +0.74 V due to the oxidation of DTF. After the first reverse cathodic scan, a new reversible wave pair emerges at much lower potentials, which corresponds to the TTFV product resulting from oxidative dimerization.40 Indeed, the oxidative dimerization has turned out to be the most useful reactivity of DTF for synthetic purposes. Over the past few decades, a large variety of π-extended TTF analogues and related conductive polymers have been prepared through this facile oxidative C–C bond forming approach.41,42

Other reactivities of DTF have also been reported in the literature, a summary of which is outlined in Scheme 4B. In most of these reactions, the vinylidene proton of DTF is displaced by various electrophilic groups. Hartzler in his 1971 paper18 considered benzylidenedithioles (i.e., phenyl-DTFs) as quasiaromatic systems, which can be described by the resonance scheme shown in Scheme 4B. As such, the exo-ring CC bond can act as a nucleophile susceptible to various substitution reactions, including bromination,43 addition to a diazonium salt,44 nitrosylation,44 and formylation with oxalyl chloride.45 DTF can also be readily protonated by a strong acid. For instance, our group recently observed facile H/D exchange when DTFs were treated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence of excess D2O. The activated CC bond of DTF can also undergo cycloaddition reactions. For example, the reaction between DTF and phenyl isocyanate (PhNCO) first led to a β-lactam intermediate, which was then transformed into an amide-functionalized DTF product.46 DTF was found to undergo a photo-oxidative cleavage reaction in the presence of C60 fullerene and air.24,47 In this reaction, the photo-excitation of C60 first induced the formation of singlet oxygen, which then reacted with the CC bond to cleave DTF into corresponding aldehyde and 1,3-dithiol-2-one.
 Scheme 4  (A) Mechanism for DTF oxidative dimerization. (B) Summary of the reactivities of DTFs with various electrophiles. 
Recently some unique DTF reactivities have been discovered. Bouzan et al. observed that when a phenyl-DTF carrying an ortho-substituent (e.g., CH3 or Br) was subjected to iodione-promoted oxidative coupling conditions, the resulting product afforded an unusual dispiro-tricyclic structure such as compounds 17a/b shown in Scheme 5A.48,49 It was proposed that the presence of an ortho-substituent hinders the deprotonation step in the oxidative dimerization mechanism, hence allowing Na2S2O3 to react with the protonated dication intermediate during the workup step. It was also found that the DTF group directly linked to a π-extended aryl group, such as anthracene49 and pyrene,50 may become inert to oxidative dimerization due to the strong resonance effect that stabilizes the radical cation intermediate. Such properties are in line with a new type of iodione-mediated vinylic sulfenylation reactions recently disclosed by Fu and co-workers.51 As shown in Schemes 5B, 1-naphthyl and 9-anthryl-substituted DTFs 18 were first oxidized by iodine and the resulting radical cations, instead of undergoing oxidative dimerization, reacted with 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiols 19 to form thiadiazolyl-substituted products 20 in good yields.

Our group recently discovered by serendipity that the DTF group can undergo an intramolecular alkyne-dithiolium cycloaddition reaction. As shown in Scheme 5C, bis-DTF 21 was originally intended to generate polymers through iodione-promoted DTF oxidative coupling. To our surprise, the reaction ended up with the formation of bis(indenothiophene) 22 as the major product.52 A control reaction of 21 under the treatment of TFA yielded a cyclized product 23, indicating that protonation of the vinylic carbon of DTF is a key step in the cyclization reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) mechanistic studies revealed that protonation of the DTF group leads to a dithiolium cation which favors reaction with the ortho-alkynyl group to form an intramolecular cycloaddition product.53
4 Recent advances in DTF-functionalized organic materials
4.1 Organic solar cells
The DTF group can be applied as an active electron-donating group in various π-conjugated systems to bring about enhanced optoelectronic performance. In 2008, Leriche and co-workers54 synthesized a group of DTF-functionalized triphenylamines (TPAs) (24a/b, Fig. 2). These compounds were tested as organic semiconductors in organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and photovoltatic (PV) devices. Compound 24b was found to show a hole mobility (3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of 24a due to stronger π-stacking in the solid state. Compound 24b was also paired with C60 fullerene (electron acceptor) to form a bilayer heterojunction solar cell. The solar cell gave a power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.11%, but the stability of the device was poor.

In 2012, Yang and co-workers55 designed and synthesized a group of DTF-π-(2-cyanoacetic acid) hybrids (25a–c, Fig. 2). which were applied as metal-free organic sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Device performance was observed to increase with the π-bridge length, while the device based on compound 25c reached a remarkably high η of 8.29%. The efficiency was comparable with that of the Ru-based N719 sensitizer, hence pointing to a promising future of developing high-performance organic DSSCs based on DTF-functionalized dye molecules. Studies in this direction were thereafter actively carried out, not only expanding the family of these D–π–A type organic dyes (25d–p) but also further enhancing the performance of related DSSCs.56–61 Incorporation of DTF groups as donors into various π-conjugated systems has been proven beneficial for improving the performance of DSSC devices. Most recently, Guo and co-workers61 designed a DSSC, in which a V-shaped dye 25k was co-adsorbed with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on TiO2 to achieve an η value as high as 9.04%. A similar DTF/(2-cyanoacetic acid)-functionalization strategy has been applied to star-shaped TPA systems in order to obtain high-performance dyes for DSSCs. In 2013, Wan et al.62 developed a bis(DTF)-substituted TPA 26a, which features simple preparation and high molar absorptivity. Under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the DSSC based on 26a gave a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.41%. Compared with a simple TPA dye, DTF-functionalized TPA 26a attained a 79% increase in η. Analogous DTF–TPA dyes 26b and 26c were also prepared as dyes for DSSCs, and the devices afforded power conversion efficiencies of 3.78% and 4.09%, respectively.63
In 2017, Yang and co-workers64 developed a group of DTF-based D–π–A type of metal-free organic sensitizers 27a–c (Fig. 3) in which pyridine was employed as the acceptor. In this series of compounds, 27c possesses the longest π-bridge. Interestingly, the maximum UV-Vis absorption wavelength of 27c (407 nm) shows an unusual blueshift relative to that of 27b (417 nm). This result could be explained by a larger degree of excitation-induced geometric change occurring in 27c than 27b. UV-Vis absorption spectra of 27a–c adsorbed on transparent mesoporous TiO2 films, however, showed a normal trend of redshift with increasing π-bridge length. As such, a DSSC based on 27c achieved the highest efficiency of 2.61%. Overall, recent studies have convincingly testified to that DTF-functionalization is an effective design approach for generating high-performance metal-free organic dyes for DSSCs.

In 2018, Wu and co-workers65 synthesized two DTF-functionalized spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] molecules (28 and 29, Fig. 4) and explored their application as dopant-free hole-transporting materials in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Incorporation of DTF groups into the spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] was found to give rise to high hole mobility and good air stability due to beneficial S–S contact in the solid state. Compound 28 shows a hole mobility (1.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) 4.95 times greater than that of 29. Devices based on 28 and 29 attained power conversion efficiencies of 10.67% and 8.78%, respectively. The studies disclosed that DTF-functionalized positions on the spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] structure have significant impact on the device performance.

4.2 Molecular wires
Many linear π-conjugated oligomers and polymers can exhibit molecular conductance and thus are useful as molecular wires for various nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.66–70 Since 2006, Nielsen and co-workers71–75 have continually synthesized a class of DTF-functionalized oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s (OPEs); for example, compounds 30–32 illustrated in Fig. 5. These compounds were subjected to comprehensive characterization of molecular conductance by different methods, including conducting probe (CP) atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), mechanically controlled break-junction (MCBJ) experiments on single molecules, and scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction (STM-BJ) experiments on single molecules, in order to understand their molecular wire behavior and related structure–property relationships.76,77 In these studies, CP-AFM analysis revealed that the molecular conductance of these OPE wires tends to increase with increasing number of DTF groups orthogonally placed along the wires. Single-molecule measurements using STM-BJ and MCBJ methods, on the other hand, suggested that DTF groups cause the junction formation probability to decrease and exert insignificant effects on the single-molecule conductance. The different outcomes indicated that the measurement of molecular conductance is a very complex and challenging task. In addition to molecular properties, other factors such as interfacial structures also play important roles.
 Fig. 5  DTF-functionalized OPEs as molecular wires. 
In a recent study, Lissau et al.78 investigated a series of D–A substituted OPE wires with linear and cross-conjugated structures. Particularly, the molecular properties of two DTF-functionalized OPEs (33 and 34, Fig. 6) were examined and compared. The two OPE wires were found to exhibit remarkably broadened conductance peaks measured by the MCBJ technique with gold contacts. Due to different degrees of resonance effects, compounds 33 features linear conjugation whereas 34 shows cross-conjugation. As such, the measured condutance histograms of these two compounds appeared to be different. The calculated transmission of cross-conjugated 34 is a factor of 4 lower than that of the linearly conjugated OPEs such as 31. Transmission of protonated 33, which features a cross-conjugation pattern through enhanced resonance effects, was calculated to show a value similar to that of cross-conjugated 34. This study for the first time demonstrated that molecular resonance forms could be tracked in single-molecule conductance experiments.

4.3 Building blocks for redox-active polymer sensors
As mentioned above, the oxidative dimerization of DTF offers a facile C–C bond forming methodology, through which a plethora of redox-active π-conjugated polymers was generated through oxidative polymerization of DTF-functionalized arene precursors.41 In general, a bis(DTF)-substituted arene under oxidative conditions (chemical or electrochemical) would produce linear polymers as products. However, the formation of cyclic oligomers (e.g., macrocycles) stands as another possible scenario. In 1997, Hascoat and co-workers79 reported that the macroscale electrolysis of bis(DTF) 35 yielded two macrocyclic products 36a and 36b (Scheme 6) as an inseparable mixture with a total yield of 47% (ratio 4:6).
 Scheme 6  Preparation of TTFV macrocycles 36via electrolysis. 
Our group in 2016 synthesized a TTFV-pyrene macrocycle 38 through direct oxidative coupling of a bis(DTF)-pyrene precursor 37.50 As shown in Scheme 7, the synthetic procedures involved two important steps. In the first step, bis(DTF)-pyrene 37 was subjected to a partial oxidative dimerization (iodine as oxidant) in the solution phase for a limited period of time, forming a mixture of dimer and unreacted monomer. Without purification, the mixture was then subjected to grinding in the presence of iodine and silica gel to afford macrocycle 38 in an overall yield of 37%. A molecular modeling study suggested that the presence of DTF groups facilitates the binding of macrocycle 38 with electron-deficient aromatics such as nitrobenzene. UV-Vis titration experiments further confirmed that 38 could act as a supramolecular host for nitrobenzene with an association constant of 3644.6 ± 0.4 M−1. Inspired by these findings, we designed a series of multivalent DTF-functionalized polyarenes 39–42 (Fig. 7) as building blocks for the construction of redox-active polymer thin film sensors for nitrobenzene explosives.80,81 Octa(DTF) 40 was found to form a microporous cross-linked polymer thin film on a glassy carbon electrode upon multi-cycle cyclic voltammetric scans. The thin film showed sensitive electrochemical responses to nitrobenzene at sub-mM concentrations.80 To improve the durability of the cross-linked polymer thin film, a double-layer strategy was recently devised by our group.81 Tetra(DTF) 42 was electropolymerized on a robust TTFV polymer film pre-deposited on a glassy carbon electrode, and the two layers of polymers were covalently bound. The double-layer polymer thin film exhibited very high sensitivity and selectivity for 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TNT) among other nitrobenzene derivatives, and hence can be used as a TNT sensor with excellent durability and re-usability.

4.4 Selective dispersants for single-walled carbon nanotubes
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are highly useful carbon nanomaterials owing to their excellent electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.82–86 SWNTs are generally produced as mixtures of various electronic types, tube diameters, and chiral indices.87 To be practically useful in device applications, purification or enrichment of SWNTs of a desired type is therefore critically needed.88 Non-covalent functionalization of SWNTs offers an effective approach to achieve such a challenging goal. π-Conjugated polymers show favored non-covalent binding to SWNTs (e.g., wrapping through π-stacking) and therefore can induce dispersion of SWNTs in various solvents. Rationally designed conjugated polymers have been prepared to show preferential binding with certain types of SWNTs, thus attaining selective SWNT dispersion.89 Moreover, incorporation of stimuli-responsive groups into polymers could achieve control over dispersion and release of SWNTs in the solution phase.
In recent years, DTF has been utilized as a functional group in π-conjugated polymers that acted as SWNTs dispersants. In 2013, Bao and co-workers90 synthesized a series of poly(dithiafulvalene-fluorene-co-m-thiophene)s (43, Fig. 8). DTF was utlizied here as a building block for these polymers in view of its strong interactions with SWNTs. The polymers could selectively disperse semiconducting SWNTs in toluene upon treatment of sonication and centrifugation. It was also found that increase in the ratio of thiophene to dithiafulvene units in the polymer structure led to improved selectivity for semiconducting SWNTs. Thin film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated based on the polymer-sorted SWNT network and the devices showed an average on/off ratio of (1.56 ± 1.08) × 104 and average mobility of 1.26 ± 0.51 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are much better than those of the devices built with unsorted SWNTs. Our group designed and synthesized a series of TTFV-phenylacetylene-based co-polymers 44 as efficient dispersants for SWNTs.91,92 The TTFV unit prefers a V-shaped conformation, allowing the polymers to wrap around individual SWNTs through π-stacking. In the meantime, the alkoxy chains on the polymer backbone play an important role in SWNT dispersion as well. Incorporation of the TTFV unit in the polymer backbone allowed the polymers to show conformational switching properties in response to external stimuli such as oxidation/reduction or protonation/deprotonation. As such the polymers could achieve controllable wrapping/unwrapping around SWNTs, and hence allowed multi-cycles of dispersion and release of SWNTs to be executed. Adronov and co-workers93 further developed a TTFV-fluorene-based co-polymer 45, which showed high selectivity for dispersing small-diameter SWNTs in organic solvents. More interestingly, addition of a strong organic acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), to the SWNT-polymer suspension resulted in a rapid conformational change and desorption of the polymer from the SWNT surface. As a result, pure SWNTs that were completely free of polymers were released as precipitate. In 2016, Adronov and co-workers reported two fluorene-based co-polymers 46 and 47, in which DTF groups are included in the polymer backbones.94 Both polymers showed strong interactions with high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPCO) SWNTs, leading to their effective dispersion in organic solvents. In particular, the electron-donating properties of DTF groups facilitated good selectivity for large-diameter semiconducting SWNTs. Mulla et al.95 designed two poly(p-phenylene ethynylene)s 48 and 49, in which DTF groups were appended to the polymer backbones through “click chemistry”. Molecular modeling studies suggested that these polymers could interact with SWNTs through a “centipede”-like wrapping mode. The polymers showed good selectivity for dispersing small-diameter semiconducting SWNTs in chloroform. It was quite interesting to observe that almost dispersant-free SWNTs could be readily released from the SWNT-polymer suspensions in chloroform by addition of hexane. Moreover, release of SWNTs from the polymer-SWNT suspension could be achieved through electrolysis at a voltage of +0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Both the solvent mixing and electrolysis methods are easy to scale up and have the potential to enable large-scale preparation of high-quality SWNTs.
 Fig. 8  DTF-functionalized π-conjugated polymers for selective dispersion of SWNTs. 
In addition to DTF-functionalized π-conjugated polymers, certain π-conjugated oligomers with relatively short chain length have also been found to act as efficient dispersants for SWNTs. In 2013, Mulla and Zhao47 investigated a series of DTF-endcapped π-oligomers 50–53 (Fig. 9). Although these oligomers possess relatively short π-conjugated frameworks, they showed reasonable to good efficiencies in dispersing SWNTs. Of particular note, the Z-shaped oligomer 53 brought about good solubility of HiPCO SWNTs (0.29 mg mL−1) in chloroform. Like the behavior of DTF-appended polymers 48 and 49, the DTF-oligomers showed selectivity for small-diameter SWNTs and the resulting SWNT-oligomer suspensions could be easily dissociated upon addition of hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, releasing dispersant-free SWNTs as precipitate. In 2015, Khadem and Zhao96 synthesized and investigated a class of TTFV-fluorene-based co-oligomers 54a–c (Fig. 9) through DTF-oxidative coupling. NMR and gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analyses indicated that oligomers 54a–c possess relatively short chain lengths (i.e., trimer to octamer). Studies also showed that these oligomers afforded good diameter-selectivity in dispersing SWNTs (ca. 1.04 nm) in organic solvents such as chloroform and THF. To further understand the role of DTF-functionalized π-oligomers in assisting the dispersion of SWNTs, Lagowski and co-workers97–99 performed a series of molecular modelling studies based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT analysis confirmed that the presence of DTF groups in phenylacetylene and fluorene-based π-oligomers significantly increases the binding energies of SWNT/oligomer complexes. Long alkyl chains were also found to favorably wrap around the SWNT to facilitate binding. It is also interesting to note that the DFT calculations revealed that small-diameter SWNTs such the (6,5) tube have stronger binding than relative larger-diameter SWNTs (e.g., (8,7) tubes). Solvent effects were also examined to show that choloroform delivers a stronger effect on SWNT dispersion than hexane,99 which is in agreement with the experimental observations.47

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are important nanomaterials with extensive applications in various fields such as biology, catalysis, and nanotechnology.100 The preparation of GNPs is usually achieved through reduction of Au(III) species, while the presence of suitable ligands in the reaction systems is essential to stabilize the GNPs formed. The first application of DTF as a reducing agent for GNP synthesis was reported by Chujo and co-workers.101,102 In their work, a DTF polymer 54 (Scheme 8) was prepared through a cycloaddition polymerization of a corresponding aldothioketene precursor derived from 1,4-diethynylbenzene.103 The polymer showed good electron-donating properties and could reduce HAuCl4 in DMSO, forming polymer-protected GNPs with an average size of 6 nm (Scheme 8).101,102 In addition to the formation of GNPs, polymer 54 was also found to be effective at producing Pd and Pt nanoparticles through reduction reactions.102 It was proposed that oxidized 54 serves as the ligand to protect metal nanoparticles, but the detailed nature of the DTF group (cation or radical cation) in the oxidized state was not clearly described.

Adows and Zhao104 in 2016 investigated a group of carboxylated DTFs and TTFVs (55–58, Fig. 10). The interactions of these electron-donating compounds with HAuCl4 were examined in various polar organic solvents. It was found that DTF 55 underwent oxidative dimerization in acetonitrile upon treatment with HAuCl4 to form the corresponding TTFV product 56. However, reduction of HAuCl4 under these conditions did not afford GNPs. The redox reactions of DTF 57 with HAuCl4 in DMF and DMSO led to the formation of GNPs. Particularly in DMSO, the resulting GNPs showed diameters of tens of nm and very good stability. It was also discovered that TTFV derivatives 56 and 58 could reduce HAuCl4 in organic solvents, but the resulting Au(0) species were gold microcrystals rather than GNPs. Overall, this study suggests that DTF is an essential group for the formation of GNPs, since it can act as both reductant and ligand. Also, the formation of GNPs is strongly dependent on the solvent. More detailed GNP forming mechanisms still await investigation.

Recently, Granados and co-workers evaluated a family of DTF-dithiolate derivatives (59a–e, Scheme 9) as reducing agents for the formation of noble metal nanoparticles (Au, Pd, and Pt).105,106 In this series of DTF derivatives, the presence of a dithiolate group in conjugation with DTF stabilizes their radical cations via resonance effects after single-electron transfer. Hence these DTFs did not undergo the typical oxidative dimerization reaction, which was evidenced by cyclic voltammetric analysis. Owing to their good electron-donating properties, DTFs 59a–e reduced HAuCl4, PdCl2, and AgNO3 in acetonitrile, respectively. The resulting colloidal metal nanoparticles were found to be stable, and the authors proposed that the DTF cation acts as an effective ligand to protect the metal nanoparticles.

4.6 Functional organic chromophores
DTF has also long been recognized as a useful electron-donating (D) group for the design of functional organic chromophores, in which DTF and various electron acceptors (A) are integrated together through π-conjugated linkages. Previously, a range of DTF–π–A type of push–pull systems were developed as nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores.107–109 New types of DTF-based organic chromophores have been continuously designed in recent years, which warrant highlighting in this section.
In 2016, Deng et al.110 prepared a DTF–TPA–dicarbazole (60, Scheme 10) as a precursor for electrochemical polymerization. Compound 60 was subjected to cyclic voltammetric scans to generate a polymer film of 61 on an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The polymer film showed interesting electrochromic properties; at different voltages, the film changed its color reversibly from light yellow to green to blue grey, with a coloring response time of 4 s, bleaching response time of 8 s, coloration efficiency of 23.77 cm2 C−1 and 40% at the wavelength of 658 nm.

Recently, Guo and co-workers111 reported a bis(DTF) π-oligomer (62, Fig. 11). In general, DTF-functionalization on a π-conjugated system would cause significant fluorescence quenching due to the strong electron-donating nature of DTF. In contrast to the general trend, DTF-functionalized chromophore 62 exhibited intriguing aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE) behavior; the fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF) of 62 increases from 8% (in THF) to 13% (in solid film). Their studies also disclosed that the AIEE property can be ascribed to the formation of excimers and J-aggregates in the solid state.
 Fig. 11  New DTF-based organic chromophores developed in recent years. 
Rachi et al.112 in 2018 reported a class of D–π–A type of chromophores (63a–f, Fig. 11) containing DTF as the donor group. These compounds showed intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) properties, which were evidenced by their UV-Vis absorption bands in the long-wavelength region (640–710 nm). The solid-state structures of these chromophores were elucidated by crystallographic analysis, showing that hydrogen-bonding and π-stacking play important roles in solid-state assemblies. Although there were no potential applications reported in this work, these DTF-based chromophores present some new ideas for the design of solid-state optoelectronic materials.
Two DTF–TPA–C60 fullerene conjugates (64a and 64b, Fig. 11) were reported by Guldi and co-workers in 2017.113 In these compounds, C60 acts as the electron acceptor and DTF as the donor. The DTF–TPA–C60 conjugates could form short-lived (τ = 6 ps) and long-lived (τ = 130 ns) radical ion pairs, respectively, depending on the excitation wavelengths. Activation barriers of 2.4 and 10.0 kJ mol−1 were determined for the singlet and triplet radical ion pair state, respectively. The authors suggested that these compounds have potential in photovoltaics and photocatalysis.
5 Conclusions
As an excellent organic electron donor, DTF has been widely used in the design and synthesis of functional organic π-conjugated materials for decades. Indeed, there is a vast body of literature related to this topic and its size is still growing rapidly. The aim of this review is to highlight the most recent research directions of DTF-based organic materials rather than to achieve comprehensive coverage. Current research progress has clearly demonstrated that DTF-functionalization can bring about intriguing electronic and optical properties beneficial to the development of advanced optoelectronic devices and nanomaterials. On the other hand, studies on the fundamental properties of DTF continue to offer new insights into rational molecular design and materials applications. Recently, the quests for novel functional materials such as redox-active metal organic frameworks (MOFs)114–116 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs),117,118 artificial molecular machines,119–123 and redox-catalysis124 have emerged as new frontiers in materials science and technology. As a versatile redox-active molecular building block, DTF is expected to find extensive applications in these exciting fields. It is worth remarking that the rich redox-activity and reactivities of DTF should deserve much prudent consideration in order to avoid undesired synthetic outcomes or attenuated stability of DTF-functionalized materials. In the meantime, there are still challenging issues waiting for further investigations; for example, the properties and mechanisms involved in the interactions of DTF with other nanomaterials (e.g., SWNTs and metal nanoparticles). It can be envisioned that studies dealing with these fundamental issues will be of great value for future design and application of DTF-based organic conjugated materials.
