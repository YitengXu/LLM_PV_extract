    , Accepted 5th February 2019First published on 5th February 2019AbstractElectrocatalytic N2 reduction as an alternative approach to the energy-intensive and large CO2-producing Haber–Bosch process for NH3 synthesis under mild conditions has attracted extensive attention. Current research efforts on N2 reduction have mainly focused on metal-based catalysts, but metal-free alternatives can avoid the issue of metal ion release. In this work, oxygen-doped hollow carbon microtubes (O-KFCNTs) derived from natural kapok fibers are reported as a metal-free NRR electrocatalyst for N2-to-NH3 conversion with excellent selectivity. In 0.1 M HCl, the O-KFCNTs achieve a high faradaic efficiency of 9.1% at −0.80 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a NH3 yield rate of 25.12 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.85 V vs. RHE under ambient conditions. Notably, this catalyst also demonstrates high stability.
NH3 synthesis is a pillar of the chemical industry and a milestone in both human history and the ecology of the planet, owing to its significance in the manufacturing of inorganic fertilizers, medicaments and explosives.1 And, it has also attracted attention as a high-efficiency energy carrier with a gravimetric hydrogen density of 17.8%, making it a promising transportation fuel (easily liquefied with a boiling point at −33.3 °C at 1atm).2 At present, the Haber–Bosch process (N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3) is the main method for industrial-scale NH3 production, but this method requires high temperatures and pressures and produces a large amount of CO2 emissions.3 To this end, it is crucial to develop an environmentally-benign and sustainable method for N2-fixation to NH3.
Electrochemical N2 reduction is regarded as an environmentally-friendly alternative to the Haber–Bosch process for ambient N2-to-NH3 conversion and can be driven by the electricity produced from renewable energy resources (solar energy, wind wave power, etc.) without producing CO2 emissions, but it demands high-performance electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) to break the strong NN triple bond of N2.4–6 Noble metal-based materials are active for electrochemical N2-to-NH3 fixation.7–10 However, their large-scale use is greatly hindered due to their high price and low abundance. Thus, researchers have turned their attention towards non-precious metals due to their low price and abundant reserves,11–27 but these metal-based catalysts may release metal ions during the catalytic process, resulting in environmental pollution. To address this thorny issue, developing more environmentally-friendly metal-free catalysts for NRR with high performance is highly desired.28,29
Biomass carbon, mainly derived from plants, with the advantages of being low-cost, plentiful, environmentally-friendly and renewable,30 holds great promise for electrochemical applications. Meanwhile, doping non-metal heteroatoms into the backbone of carbon frameworks can modulate the electronic properties of carbon materials, providing more active sites and improving the interaction between carbon frameworks and active sites.31 In this study, oxygen-doped hollow carbon microtubes (O-KFCNTs) derived from natural kapok fibers with a one-dimensional hollow architecture32 are proposed as a superior metal-free catalyst for electrochemical N2 fixation to NH3 under ambient conditions. When tested in 0.1 M HCl, a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 9.1% at −0.80 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a NH3 yield rate of 25.12 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.85 vs. RHE were attained. The catalyst also demonstrated long-term electrochemical durability and reusability.
O-KFCNTs were prepared by pyrolytic carbonization in Ar of a readily available KF (see the ESI† for preparative details). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to characterize the carbonized product. As shown in Fig. 1A, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 22.0° and 44.0° can be attributed to the (002) and (100) reflections of graphitized carbon.33,34Fig. 1B shows a typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the O-KFCNTs with lengths of over 100 μm. It can be seen that the O-KFCNTs are hollow microtubes with diameters of over 10 μm (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows that the wall thickness is about 1.2 μm. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1E) and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1F) show that the tube has an electron-microscopically perfectly smooth surface and is amorphous in nature. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of the O-KFCNTs confirm the uniform distribution of elemental C and O, as shown in Fig. 1G. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of the O-KFCNTs, indicating the existence of C and O atoms with an O content of 19.21% in the O-KFCNTs. The product also contains a trace amount of P (0.18%), S (0.12%) and Ca (0.21%). The high-resolution C 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 1H shows the presence of C–C bonds in graphite domains (284.4 eV), C–O (284.9 eV) and CO (286.0 eV) groups.35 In Fig. 1I, the high-resolution spectrum of O 1s indicates the presence of O–H (531.2 eV), O–CO (532.3 eV) and C–O (533.8 eV).36 All of these data demonstrate the formation of O-doped hollow carbon microtubes.

Electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode system, in which 0.1 M HCl functioned as the electrolyte, and O-KFCNTs deposited on carbon paper (O-KFCNTs/CP) served as the working electrode, with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl electrolyte) as the reference electrode and graphite rod as the counter electrode. The NRR was carried out in a typical H-cell, in which the cathodic and anodic compartments were separated with a proton exchange membrane. The primary reaction can be described as: Anodic: 3H2O → 3/2O2 + 6H+ + 6e−(1) Cathode: N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3(2) Overall reaction: N2 + 3H2O → 2NH3 + 3/2O2(3)
All potentials are reported via the RHE scale for all nitrogen reduction tests. Firstly, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured in Ar- or N2-saturated 0.1 M HCl solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 to evaluate the potential range of the N2 reduction of O-KFCNTs/CP (Fig. 2A). It can be clearly observed that when the potential is more negative than −0.75 V, the current density in the N2-saturated solution is higher than that in the Ar-saturated solution, indicating the occurrence of NRR. Fig. 2B presents the current densities of the chronoamperometry curves at different potentials (from −0.75 to −0.95 V), and the produced NH3 was determined by spectrophotometry using the indophenol blue method.12 The concentration-absorbance curve calibrated with standard NH3 concentrations is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Fig. 2C shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of NH3 produced from post-tested electrolyte coloured with indophenol indicator corresponding to different potentials. The NH3 yield rates (VNH3) and faradaic efficiencies (FEs) under a series of potentials were calculated and plotted in Fig. 2D. As observed, O-KFCNTs/CP is a superior catalyst for NRR, attaining a high FE value of 9.1% at −0.80 V vs. RHE and a NH3 yield rate of 25.12 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.85 vs. RHE under ambient conditions, comparing favourably to the behaviour of oxygen-doped carbon nanosheets.37 Table S1 (ESI†) compares the NRR performances of O-KFCNTs/CP with some reported catalysts under ambient conditions. Of note, when the potential is below −0.85 V, the NH3 yield rate decreases significantly.

(D) NH3 yield rates and FEs of O-KFCNTs/CP for NRR at different potentials. 
The catalytic performances of O-KFCNTs/CP and bare CP were also investigated under the same reaction conditions. According to the corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the bar chart of the amount of NH3 (Fig. 3A), O-KFCNTs/CP has a higher NRR activity than bare CP. A series of control experiments were conducted to further verify the N source of the produced NH3. Firstly, O-KFCNTs/CP was immersed with alternating 2 h cycles in N2-saturated and Ar-saturated electrolyte for a total of 12 h at −0.85 V. The corresponding NH3 yield rates and FEs were then calculated and plotted as shown in Fig. 3B, suggesting that NH3 only generates in the periods where the electrolyte is N2-saturated. Furthermore, the O-KFCNTs/CP was placed in N2-saturated solution at open circuit potential and in an Ar-saturated solution at −0.85 V. No NH3 was detected in either case (Fig. 3C) and the corresponding UV-Vis spectra show weak signals similar to those of blank solvent (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, the absorbance values increase upon an extension of the electrocatalysis time (Fig. S5, ESI†) and a good linear relationship was observed between the amount of NH3 and electrocatalysis time (Fig. 3D), which further proves that NH3 is produced by NRR.

(D) The relationship between the amount of NH3 and reaction time at −0.85 V. 
Since stability is another critical parameter used to evaluate the performance of a catalyst, we investigated in the stability of O-KFCNTs/CP in NRR. The current densities of the chronoamperometry curves during the electrochemical reduction N2 to NH3 on O-KFCNTs/CP at −0.85 V showed almost no fluctuation for 6 successive cycles (Fig. 4A). The corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectra are plotted in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and the NH3 yield rates as well as the FEs shown in Fig. 4B indicate negligible change, demonstrating the excellent reusability of the catalyst. Meanwhile, the current densities of the chronoamperometric measurements remained almost unchanged upon extending the electrolytic time to about 80000 s at −0.85 V (Fig. 4C). After the NRR, the morphology of the catalyst was still well maintained (Fig. S7, ESI†) and the XPS spectra of the post-tested catalyst also remained unchanged (Fig. S8, ESI†). All of these results indicate that O-KFCNTs/CP has excellent stability and durability under ambient reaction conditions for NRR. Of note, the selectivity for N2-to-NH3 conversion is another critical parameter of O-KFCNTs/CP for NRR. The possible by-product N2H4 may be produced and can be detected by the method described by Watt and Crisp (see the ESI† for details). Comparing the detected calibration curves for N2H4 in Fig. S9 (ESI†) with the detection results of the solution after NRR, it indicates that no N2H4 by-product is produced at all potentials (Fig. 4D). Therefore, O-KFCNTs/CP possesses excellent selectivity for N2-to-NH3 conversion. Furthermore, we also conducted electrocatalytic NRR in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M NaOH. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows that the NRR performance in both electrolytes is inferior to that in acid. In addition, in order to study the effect of the annealing temperature on the NRR performance, kapok fibers were carbonized in Ar gas at different temperatures of 400 °C and 800 °C for 2 h. The samples obtained were designated as O-KFCNTs-400 and O-KFCNTs-800, respectively. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the FE and NH3 yield rate of the O-KFCNTs are both higher than those of O-KFCNTs-400 and O-KFCNTs-800, revealing that the carbonization temperature has a great effect on the NRR performance, and it was found that the electrocatalyst treated with an annealing temperature of 600 °C had the best NRR activity.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to shed light on the active sites of O-KFCNTs in NRR.38,39 To accurately replicate the O-KFCNTs, both defective graphene and a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) were built. The relaxed structures of all configurations are presented in Fig. S12A–C (ESI†). There is no large lattice deformation observed after structure relaxation for both defective graphene and the SWNT, manifesting the good stability of the oxygen-doped amorphous carbon. Our DFT calculations show that in all configurations, only oxygen atoms can absorb N2 molecules, and carbon atoms (both around the vacancy and far from the vacancy) will not absorb N2 molecules. This indicates that the active sites in the amorphous carbon are the oxygen atoms rather than the carbon atoms. Oxygen-doped defective graphene with a 3% carbon vacancy has an absorption energy of −0.09 eV for N2 molecules (Fig. S12D, ESI†), and the one with 6% carbon vacancy possesses an absorption energy of −0.16 eV for N2 molecules (Fig. S12E, ESI†). The enhancement in the absorption for N2 molecules upon an increase in the defect concentration corresponds well with the experimental findings. We also built models of pristine graphene and a SWNT and calculated the absorption energy for N2 molecules. It was found that graphene has an absorption energy of −0.08 eV for N2, while the SWNT attains an absorption energy of −0.06 eV for N2 molecules (Fig. S12F, ESI†). The increased absorption energy between defective carbon and N2 molecules corroborates the superior NRR performance of amorphous carbon.
In summary, O-KFCNTs, derived from low-cost and abundant Kapok fibers, were first used as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical NRR under ambient conditions. This catalyst achieves a high FE of 9.1% at −0.80 V vs. RHE and a NH3 yield rate of 25.12 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.85 vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl, and also presents excellent selectivity and electrochemical stability. This work not only provides us with a low-cost and efficient catalyst material for electrochemical NH3 synthesis, but may also open up an exciting new avenue to develop biomass-derived nanocarbons for N2-fixation applications.
