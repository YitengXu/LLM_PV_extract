    , Accepted 14th January 2012First published on 18th January 2012AbstractWe report on low-cost, all solution fabrication of efficient air-stable nanostructured thin film photovoltaics comprised of n-type Sb2S3 chemically deposited onto TiO2 nanowire array films, forming coaxial Sb2S3/TiO2 nanowire hybrids vertically oriented from the SnO2:F coated glass substrate, which are then intercalated with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) for hole transport and enhanced light absorption.
Solution-growth techniques using earth crust abundant materials offer an exciting opportunity for achieving low-cost, high performance solar cells.1Sb2S3 (stibnite) is a promising photovoltaic material due to its relative abundance in the earth's crust, high absorption coefficient (1.8 × 105 cm−1 at 450 nm), and a mid-range optical bandgap of ∼1.7–1.8 eV that is well suited for capturing visible light photons.2Antimony chalcogenide thin films have been synthesized using methods including vacuum evaporation and chemical deposition.3 The successful photovoltaic applications of these films suggest that antimony chalcogenides and related ternary or quaternary materials offer intriguing prospects for the development of high performance, low cost solar cells.4 However, in fabrication of photovoltaics using such materials the maximum efficiency so far reported is below 1% primarily due to slow electron/hole transfer.4 Combining light absorbing thin films of Sb2S3 with nanocrystalline or nanoporous TiO2 and interpenetrating hole conductors such as CuSCN,5 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)6 enable greatly improved solar conversion efficiencies.7 Alternatively, high surface area one-dimensional (1D) nanowire and nanotube array films, vertically oriented from the substrate, can offer vectorial transport of the photogenerated charge to the electrical contacts, with orthogonalization of light absorption and charge transport.8 Such 1-D architectures offer the promise of being able to use thicker films capable of greater light absorption with larger interface contact area without a corresponding decrease in charge collection efficiency. Thus, our strategy is to create vertically oriented coaxial Sb2S3/TiO2 nanowire hybrids coupled with hole conductor P3HT, with the ordered 1-D nanoarchitectures of large interface contact area promoting rapid charge separation and transport, leading to low cost, stable, high efficiency photovoltaic devices. Herein, we report on solution fabrication of highly ordered vertically aligned coaxial Sb2S3/TiO2 nanowire hybrids for nanostructured organic–inorganic thin film photovoltaics. We recently reported the synthesis of 1D TiO2 nanowire and nanotube arrays for water photoelectrolysis and dye-sensitized solar cell application.9 Building upon these results, we couple vertically aligned TiO2 (rutile) nanowire array films hydrothermally grown on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass with thin Sb2S3 films deposited using a chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique with spin-coated P3HT used as both light absorber and hole conductor to achieve a solid inorganic–organic FTO|TiO2 nanowire array|Sb2S3|P3HT|PEDOT:PSS|Au photovoltaic geometry (Fig. 1). The optical absorbance of the designed nanostructured hybrid of TiO2, Sb2S3, and P3HT layers making up the photovoltaic device is complementary, promoting broad spectrum light harvesting (Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the FTO|TiO2 nanowire array|Sb2S3|P3HT|PEDOT:PSS|Au hybrid all solid organic–inorganic thin film solar cell described herein and its energy level positions and charge transfer processes with efficient charge separation and transport. 
In a typical fabrication, vertically oriented TiO2 nanowire array films were grown on FTO–glass substrates using seeded hydrothermal growth,9 and were then coated with a thin layer of Sb2S3 using CBD (see ESI† for experimental details). The morphology and microstructure of the coaxial TiO2/Sb2S3 nanowire hybrid thin films were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Fig. 2a shows a FE-SEM image of the top surface and cross-section of a TiO2 nanowire array film with a nanowire length of 900 nm and diameter in the range of 20–30 nm, achieved with 2 h growth at 170 °C. The nanowires are well-separated and vertically aligned on the substrates (inset of Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b–e show illustrative FE-SEM images of TiO2 nanowire samples upon which Sb2S3 is deposited for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. After a 1 h deposition (Fig. 2b), the nanowires are covered by Sb2S3 nanocrystals. After a 2 h deposition, the sharp ends of most of the nanowires are coated by a Sb2S3 film that appears to nucleate at the tip of the nanowire. The nanowire to nanowire spacing (inset of Fig. 2c) becomes smaller due to the increased thickness of the Sb2S3 film. By further prolonging the deposition time to 3 (Fig. 2d) and 4 h (Fig. 2e), almost all the nanowires are covered with a thick Sb2S3 film, forming coaxial Sb2S3/TiO2 nanowire hybrids (Fig. 2d). Eventually all nanowire interspaces are filled by the Sb2S3 film, and thus the desired nanostructure is lost as indicated in the inset of Fig. 2e. The Sb2S3 nanoparticle size and the film layer thickness as a function of deposition time are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 2f presents a digital photograph of an as-deposited Sb2S3 film, on a TiO2 nanowire substrate, and a similar film after a 0.5 h 250 °C annealing. The brown color of the annealed sample is characteristic of stibnite (Sb2S3).

(e) Digital photograph of Sb2S3 (4 h) as deposited onto the TiO2 nanowire film, and after a 0.5 h 250 °C annealing in Ar. (f) The brown color of the annealed sample is characteristic of stibnite (Sb2S3). 
The crystal phase of the samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Sb2S3 thin films as-deposited onto the TiO2 nanowire array substrates were amorphous. When annealed in air, Ar or N2 at temperatures above 250 °C these films produced XRD patterns matching well with that of stibnite (JCPDS No. 42-1393) (Fig. S2, ESI†). This agrees with the color change from yellow for amorphous Sb2S3 to brown for crystalline Sb2S3 (Fig. 2f). The XRD pattern shows that the film is crystallized in the orthorhombic phase and presents a preferential orientation along the (310) plane parallel to the substrate. The (220), (230), (211), (221), (301), (311), (240), (420), and (041) peaks were also observed besides three additional peaks assigned to the substrate. Sb2S3 films cooled in air, resulting in the formation of a top Sb2O3 surface layer as indicated by XRD analysis, outperformed samples cooled in Ar or N2, although good photovoltaic cells could be obtained if the Ar or N2 cooled Sb2S3 samples were re-heated in air (10 min at 200 °C).
The performance of the FTO|TiO2|Sb2S3|P3HT|PEDOT:PSS|Au photovoltaics depends upon a number of factors, including annealing temperature of the Sb2S3 layer (Fig. 3a), P3HT density (Fig. 3b), and P3HT spin-coating rotation speed (Fig. 3c). For the annealing study Sb2S3 was deposited for 4 h onto the TiO2 nanowire substrate, and then annealed at variable temperatures for 0.5 h in Ar and allowed to cool in air. A P3HT concentration of 15 mg mL−1 was used with molecular weight 10 kg mol−1, and spin coated at 200 rpm for 600 s. P3HT and PEDOT:PSS layers were deposited in a N2 filled glove box. For the molecular weight study, Fig. 3b, Sb2S3 was deposited for 4 h onto the TiO2 nanowire substrate and then annealed at 250 °C for 0.5 h in Ar. Different molecular weights of P3HT were evaluated: 5, 10, and 20 kg mol−1 at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1, spin coated at 200 rpm for 600 s. For the spin coating study, Fig. 3c, Sb2S3 was deposited for 4 h onto the TiO2 nanowire substrate and then annealed at 250 °C for 0.5 h in Ar. Different P3HT spin-coating rotation speeds were evaluated using a 15 mg mL−1 solution of 10 kg mol−1P3HT. Rotation speeds less than 200 rpm resulted in poorly performing devices with a noticeably greater thickness in the center of the film. Finally, our optimized solar cell fabrication procedure was as follows. The TiO2 nanowire|Sb2S3 films were annealed in air at 250 °C for 0.5 h to crystallize the Sb2S3. A 15 mg mL−1 solution of 10 kg mol−1P3HT in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was prepared and stirred overnight. The prepared P3HT solution was spin-coated at 200 rpm for 600 s onto the TiO2|Sb2S3 substrates. Subsequently, a PEDOT:PSS solution (2:1 PEDOT–PSS/methanol) was spin-coated onto the samples at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were then heated at 90 °C on a hot-plate for 30 min. After cooling the samples were removed from the glove box and placed in a sputter-coater where a gold electrical contact was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. Aluminium masks (0.314 cm2) were placed over each cell before IPCE and J–V measurements.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of our optimized FTO|TiO2 nanowire|P3HT|PEDOT:PSS|Au solar cells under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of Sb2S3 deposition time, with device parameters summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Device performance increases with Sb2S3 deposition time due to increased light harvesting associated with the thicker Sb2S3 layers observed in Fig. 2. However, when the Sb2S3 deposition is carried out beyond 4 h, reaching a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 4.65% (Fig. 4b), the photoconversion efficiency decreases. This decrease, we believe, is due to the Sb2S3 filling the voids between the TiO2 nanowires, as indicated by the inset of Fig. 2e, with a corresponding decrease in surface area and charge separation efficiency. Air stored, these photovoltaic devices showed no degradation in performance through repeated (periodic) testing over a period of six months, indicating excellent air and moisture stability of the cells.

Our FTO|TiO2 nanowire|P3HT|PEDOT:PSS|Au solar cells demonstrate a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of over 17 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a), the highest Jsc value for the Sb2S3 based photovoltaics so far reported. The increased photocurrent is due, we believe, to the nanowire array geometry that allows rapid collection of the photogenerated charges. Fig. 4c shows the IPCE of the photovoltaic devices as a function of Sb2S3 deposition time. IPCE (%) = 100hcj(λ)/eλP(λ), where h denotes the Planck constant, c the velocity of light, e the electron charge, λ the wavelength, j(λ) the photocurrent density at λ and P(λ) the power density of light at λ.9 Optimal samples exhibit an IPCE of 72–58% between 420 and 680 nm.
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a simple solution process for the fabrication of nanostructured organic–inorganic thin film photovoltaics using earth abundant photovoltaic materials including TiO2 and Sb2S3. The rutileTiO2 nanowire array base, upon which the Sb2S3 is deposited, provides a large interfacial surface area for light absorption and facile charge separation. P3HT was used as the hole conductor to further promote rapid charge separation and transport. This device structure design results in the largest reported photocurrent density values for a Sb2S3 based photovoltaic. The AM 1.5G photoconversion efficiency of our typical, optimized devices was 4.5%, a value limited by the relatively low Voc values of our devices. In comparison to anatase, the lower quasi-Fermi level of rutile results in lower Voc values that in turn limit the photoconversion efficiency.10 Hence our current efforts are now focused on integration of Sb2S3 with vertically oriented anatase nanowire films, which should increase both the open circuit voltage and photocurrent density of the resulting photovoltaic devices.
