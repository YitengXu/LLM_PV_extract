The introduction of fluorine atoms on the quinoxaline constituents is an effective way to lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the alternating copolymers, resulting in an enhanced open-circuit voltage for the devices based on the fluorinated polymers (∼0.1 V per F added). Furthermore, fluorination also improves the charge carrier mobility in the bulk heterojunction blends. Despite the formation of unfavorable photoactive layer morphologies, the best solar cell performance is obtained for the copolymer prepared from the difluorinated quinoxaline monomer, affording a power conversion efficiency of 5.26% under AM 1.5G irradiation, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.83 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.58 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 55%.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have drawn quite some attention during the last years as a promising technology for renewable energy generation. Organic solar cells offer several advantages in comparison to competing photovoltaic technologies. Their lightweight, flexible, colorful and semi-transparent character opens the door for a number of contemporary applications such as (energy-neutral) building and automotive integration, smart textiles, sunscreens and different consumer goods.1 The inherent low(er) cost of OPVs offers advantages for fast-deployable PV systems, especially in areas without connection to the classical grid.2 Depending on the photoactive layer materials, organic solar cells can be produced via low-cost printing techniques, allowing for easy and cheap manufacturing on large surfaces.3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed OPV devices has significantly increased over the last few years, to over 10% for the best-performing bulk heterojunction (BHJ) cells, due to the design of novel electron donor conjugated polymers (or related small molecules), the introduction of suitable interfacial charge transport layers and the use of new device architectures.4,5 In solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells, the active layer consists of an intimate blend of an electron-donating organic semiconductor and an electron-accepting material (usually a fullerene derivative).1h Most often low bandgap copolymers are used as the donor materials. These conjugated push–pull polymers are composed of alternating electron rich (donor) and electron poor (acceptor) (heterocyclic) building blocks. Chemical variation of these building blocks allows for fine-tuning of the frontier molecular orbitals and the bandgap. Numerous polymers have been prepared according to this principle and have afforded a good understanding of the molecular structure-blend morphology-device performance relationships.1,4,6
4H-Cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) is one of the classical building blocks applied in low bandgap copolymers. Due to its relatively electron rich nature (in comparison to other donor moieties such as benzodithiophene and carbazole), rather low bandgaps can be obtained for the polymers based on this moiety, resulting in extended absorption and therefore potentially high short-circuit current density (JSC) values.1b,7,8 In combination with thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as electron poor building block, polymer solar cells with a PCE of 6.5% have been obtained.9 In the last couple of years, CPDT has lost some of its attractiveness though, in part due to the quite laborious synthetic route required to obtain this bridged biheterocycle. Recently, we have optimized two condensed high-yielding synthesis protocols towards CPDT, which have as an additional benefit that they allow smooth asymmetric (alkyl) side chain substitution or the introduction of particular functional groups.10 As a result, variation in the side chain pattern can simply be obtained, which can be important to further boost the efficiency (and stability) of the solar cells.4b,11
On the other hand, quinoxalines (Qx) have emerged as a promising class of electron poor moieties for low bandgap copolymers because of their strong electron affinity, resulting in deep HOMO energy levels and a broad absorption range.12 Moreover, quinoxalines allow for the introduction of two side chains per monomer, thereby generally providing well-soluble polymer materials. However, most quinoxaline building blocks have been substituted with regular alk(ox)ylated phenyl rings, limiting the absorption coverage. Recently, it was shown that the absorption spectrum can be extended by changing the 2,3-phenyl substituents into alkylated thiophenes.13
Although quinoxalines themselves are already quite electron poor, further increase of their electron affinity is pursued in this work. An often employed and effective strategy serving this purpose is the introduction of fluorine atoms on the conjugated backbone. Several groups have shown that fluorination of the electron poor building block can increase the performance of polymer solar cells.8f,h,14 Most often, this increase in device efficiency cannot be attributed to one single material property, as it is rather an interplay of different parameters which are affected upon fluorination. It has been reported that the incorporation of fluorine atoms decreases both the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels, which leads to an increase of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) with a minimal impact on the bandgap.8f,h,14 Furthermore it has also been shown that fluorination can affect the hole mobility of the polymer,15 the active layer morphology,14j the internal polarization and crystallinity,16 charge recombination in the active layer,14f and the dielectric constant of the polymer.17
In this context, we have synthesized three novel thienyl-substituted quinoxaline monomers (non-, mono- and difluorinated) with broadened absorption features. After copolymerization with an asymmetrically dialkylated 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the electron rich cross-coupling partner, a unique series of alternating copolymers was obtained, namely poly{4-(2′-ethylhexyl)-4-octyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,3-bis[5′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]quinoxaline-5,8-diyl} (PCPDTQx(0F)), poly{4-(2′-ethylhexyl)-4-octyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-6-fluoro-2,3-bis[5′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]quinoxaline-5,8-diyl} (PCPDTQx(1F)) and poly{4-(2′-ethylhexyl)-4-octyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis[5′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]quinoxaline-5,8-diyl} (PCPDTQx(2F)). It was observed that quinoxaline fluorination is an effective tool to enhance the VOC (approximately 0.1 V for every fluorine atom added) and charge carrier mobility of the resulting PCPDTQx:fullerene solar cells. Using this strategy, BHJ OPV devices with a PCE of more than 5% were obtained for the difluorinated copolymer PCPDTQx(2F), even without an optimal active layer morphology.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The polymers were prepared via Stille polycondensation between the distannylated CPDT derivative and the dibrominated Qx acceptors with Pd[P(o-tol)3]2 as a catalyst. The synthetic route towards the Qx building blocks and the final push–pull copolymers is illustrated in Scheme 1. The required Qx monomers were synthesized via a two-step procedure, involving a reduction of the appropriate benzothiadiazole 1a–c18 and consecutive condensation of the obtained o-phenylenediamines 2a–c with 1,2-bis[5′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]ethane-1,2-dione. After Stille polymerization, the resulting copolymers were precipitated in methanol and filtered off. The collected polymers were subjected to consecutive Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone and n-hexane. It is worthwhile to mention that all three polymers could be collected with n-hexane, indicating the high solubility of the materials in common organic solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, chloroform and chlorobenzene). After extraction with an aqueous sodium N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate solution to remove the last traces of palladium,19 the polymers were subjected to preparative size exclusion chromatography (prep-SEC) to remove the low molar mass parts (and additional purification). Polymer molar masses and their distributions were determined by analytical SEC. In all instances, high number-average molar masses (Mn) were obtained (47, 69 and 53 kDa for PCPDTQx(0F), PCPDTQx(1F) and PCPDTQx(2F), respectively) with polydispersity indices (PDI) around 1.5 (Table 1).

The thermal stability of the copolymers was analyzed via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) from the onset of the first derivative of the mass loss as a function of temperature (Table 1 and Fig. S1†). All three polymers showed the same mass loss temperature of ∼350 °C. Melting points (Tm) and glass transition temperatures (Tg) were investigated via rapid heat–cool calorimetry (RHC) (Table 1 and Fig. S2†). RHC was chosen above regular differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) because of its increased sensitivity to thermal transitions as a result of the fast scanning rates and the low sample amounts required.20 For PCPDTQx(0F), no clear glass transition could be observed, but the curvature in the baseline may suggest a very broad and gradual change in heat capacity. PCPDTQx(1F) and PCPDTQx(2F) did show a glass transition occurring at 78 and 65 °C, respectively. Both materials also seem to exhibit a second, higher Tg at 168 and 163 °C, respectively, and the melting point and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) increase upon fluorination. Nonetheless, the melting enthalpy remains quite small for all polymers, indicating the low crystalline character for these materials.
The HOMO and LUMO frontier energy levels of the polymers were estimated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) from the onset of the oxidation and reduction peaks, respectively. The oxidation and reduction waves for all polymers are quasi-reversible and the reported values are the means of the first three redox cycles (Table 2). From these results it is clear that the introduction of fluorine on the Qx monomer has a major influence on the HOMO energy level. For each fluorine atom introduced, the HOMO level decreases by approximately 0.1 eV, which corresponds with the results reported in previous work on other fluorinated copolymers.14 Because of the larger influence on the HOMO energy level in comparison with the LUMO, the electrochemical bandgap (EECg) slightly increases upon fluorination.

Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra in solution and thin film for all three copolymers are shown in Fig. 1. All copolymers show a similar absorption profile, i.e. a higher energy band arising from the localized π–π* transition and a lower energy band which is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer from the CPDT to the Qx moiety. Due to the strong charge transfer character, the absorption extends to the near-infrared region (absorption edge around 800 nm). Upon fluorination, a small blue-shift is observed, which is in accordance with the increase in bandgap obtained from CV.16 For the introduction of the first fluorine atom, the blue-shift is very small, whereas upon addition of the second fluorine atom a more pronounced blue-shift of 20 nm is observed. In film, this blue-shift is less distinct. Additionally, only a slight red-shift is observed when moving from solution to the solid state. Upon fluorination, this red-shift increases but stays nevertheless very small.

DFT calculations
To analyze the impact of the fluorine atoms on the positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the M0521 exchange–correlation functional and the 6-311G(d) basis set. The effects of the solvent (THF) were taken into account by using the polarizable continuum model.22 All calculations were carried out using Gaussian09.23 First, the ground state geometries were fully optimized for the individual donor and acceptor moieties, for the donor–acceptor combinations (DA), as well as for dimers of the donor–acceptor units (DADA). The large alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to accelerate the calculations without impacting the results. Several conformations differing by the torsion angles between the donor and acceptor units have been considered. Using the optimized geometries, the energies and the topologies of HOMO and LUMO were determined (Table 2). Since the energies of the syn and anti conformers differ little, the reported HOMO and LUMO energies were obtained after performing a Boltzmann averaging (T = 298.15 K). The M05 results show that adding fluorine atoms on the quinoxaline moiety stabilizes the HOMO level as well as the LUMO level, but the impact on the former is stronger so that the HOMO–LUMO gap slightly opens with increasing number of fluorine atoms. Then, as shown in Fig. 2, the topologies of the HOMO and LUMO are little affected by the number of fluorine atoms with dominant contributions on the donor CPDT (HOMO) and acceptor Qx (LUMO) moieties.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performances of the three polymers were evaluated in BHJ polymer solar cells fabricated in the standard configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The active layer processing conditions for the three polymers were optimized independently (Tables 3 and S1–S3†). For all polymers the optimal donor–acceptor ratio appeared to be 1:3, except for PCPDTQx(2F) (1:2.5 was identified as the optimal ratio for this polymer when processed with 1-chloronaphthalene as an additive). Despite the relative small change in chemical structure (keeping the same side-chain pattern), the best processing conditions (solvent and additive) differ for each polymer, which reflects the large influence of the fluorine atoms on the material properties. The J–V curves for the best solar cells are shown in Fig. 3, nicely illustrating the stepwise increase in VOC for each fluorine atom introduced. The insertion of one fluorine on the Qx moiety causes the VOC to increase by ∼0.1 V. Upon introduction of the second fluorine atom, the VOC further improved by ∼0.1 V to 0.83 V for PCPDTQx(2F). This observation is in good agreement with the observed decrease of 0.1 eV for the HOMO energy level for each fluorine atom added. Besides the VOC, also the JSC and fill factor (FF) improved for the monofluorinated copolymer PCPDTQx(1F) (to 11.17 mA cm−2 and 0.58, respectively), giving rise to an average PCE of 4.56% (4.87% for the top-performing device). For PCPDTQx(2F), a slight decrease in JSC and FF was observed compared to PCPDTQx(1F), but nonetheless these solar cells showed elevated PCE values due to the strong increase in VOC. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cells based on the fluorinated polymers was found to be higher at all wavelengths, exceeding 40% over a broad wavelength range (350–750 nm), with a maximum approaching 60% (at ∼500 nm) for PCPDTQx(2F) (Fig. 4).

 Fig. 4  EQE spectra of solar cell devices made from the different PCPDTQx copolymers. The devices employed for the EQE measurements gave a JSC of 8.68, 12.10 and 11.58 mA cm−2 for PCPDTQx(0F) (in ODCB + 3% CN), PCPDTQx(1F) (in CF + 10% ODCB) and PCPDTQx(2F) (in CB + 3% CN), respectively, with JEQE's of 8.31, 11.97 and 11.16 mA cm−2. 
To investigate the charge transport features of the BHJ blends, photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements were performed. The charge mobility of the active layer (in the appropriate direction of the solar cell mode) was determined to be 6 × 10−4, 9 × 10−4 and 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCPDTQx(0F), PCPDTQx(1F) and PCPDTQx(2F), respectively (Fig. S3†). These results indicate an increased active layer charge mobility upon fluorination.
Based on these results, a higher JSC could be expected for the device based on PCPDTQx(2F). This raises questions to which extent the obtained blend morphology allows for efficient charge extraction. AFM imaging of the active layer was performed to study the BHJ film topology, revealing extensive domain formation (up to ∼250 nm) for the fluorinated copolymer blends (Fig. 5), previously attributed to the fluorophobicity of PC71BM.14m,16 Somewhat surprisingly, however, this phenomenon does not seem to be a major limiting factor, as the solar cell performance for both fluorinated polymers increases compared to the non-fluorinated copolymer, which shows a finely intermixed BHJ blend. Similar observations have been made for PTB7-based polymer solar cells, still procuring JSC's as high as 15 mA cm−2.24 To understand the nature of the detected domains, DMT (Derjaguin–Muller–Topolov) modulus images were acquired via PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical property Mapping (QNM; Fig. S4†). Since both the observed domains and the surroundings show similar DMT moduli, no major compositional differences are to be expected. A small reduction of the domain size could be obtained by the use of suitable processing additives, giving rise to improved solar cell performances (Table 3 and Fig. 5). This PCE increase is quite strong for PCPDTQx(2F), with the top efficiency rising from 2.49 to 5.26%. The reduced JSC for the difluorinated copolymer blend compared to the PCPDTQx(1F) blend can be related to the (even) less favorable active layer morphology, possibly obscuring the potential high performance of the devices based on this copolymer. Despite a lot of efforts employing various solvent-additive combinations, the optimal recipe could not be found (yet). For the PCPDTQx(2F):PC71BM device, not only the JSC increases upon adding 1-chloronaphthalene to the processing solution, but there is also a noticeable rise in VOC (from 0.78 to 0.83 V; Table 3), which is absent for the devices based on the non- and monofluorinated copolymer. This effect can probably be related to the more significant morphology changes observed for the PCPDTQx(2F):fullerene blend (Fig. 5). It has been reported before that the nano- and mesoscopic active layer morphology of polymer solar cells can (strongly) affect the VOC.25

Conclusions
For the first time, a complete set of (fluorinated) PCPDTQx(F) copolymers was synthesized. Further structural distinctiveness was provided by the quinoxaline 2,3-bis[5′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thien-2′-yl] substitution pattern and the combination with an asymmetrically dialkylated 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene. The physicochemical and optical properties of the polymers were influenced only to a minor extent by fluorination, but the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were more seriously affected. For every fluorine atom added, the HOMO energy level decreased by approximately 0.1 eV. This deepening of the HOMO level translated into an increase of the VOC of the resulting polymer solar cell by approximately 0.1 V for every fluorine atom added, leading to a VOC of 0.83 V for the PCPDTQx(2F):PC71BM device. In addition to the VOC, also the JSC and FF increased for PCPDTQx(1F) in comparison with the non-fluorinated copolymer, affording a maximum PCE of 4.87%. Despite the further increase in VOC for PCPDTQx(2F), the JSC did not follow this trend, consequently translating in a less pronounced PCE enhancement to 5.26%. The decreased JSC was related to the less favorable photoactive layer morphology, showing large domains up to ∼250 nm. Nonetheless, the presented results clearly portray the potential of the combination of cyclopentadithiophene and quinoxaline building blocks. Side chain manipulation may be a way to obtain a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the active layer and activities in this direction are currently pursued. Another aspect of current interest is the thermal and photostability of the PCPDTQx:PC71BM photoactive layers.1a,26

High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source operating in the nebulizer assisted electrospray mode. The instrument was calibrated in the m/z range 220–2000 using a standard solution containing caffeine, MRFA and Ultramark 1621. Reported masses are the 100% intensity isotope peaks. UV-Vis measurements were performed on a VARIAN Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer at a scan rate of 600 nm min−1. The films for the UV-Vis measurements were prepared by drop casting a solution of the polymer in chloroform on a quartz substrate. The solid-state UV-Vis spectra were used to estimate the optical band gaps (from the wavelength at the intersection of the tangent line drawn at the low energy side of the absorption spectrum with the x-axis: Eg (eV) = 1240/(wavelength in nm)). Analysis of the molar masses and molar mass distributions of the polymers was performed on a Tosoh EcoSEC System, comprising of an autosampler, a PSS guard column SDV (50 × 7.5 mm), followed by three PSS SDV analytical linear XL columns (5 μm, 300 × 7.5 mm) and a UV detector using THF as the eluent at 40 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The SEC system was calibrated using linear narrow polystyrene standards ranging from 474 to 7.5 × 106 g mol−1 (K = 14.1 × 10−5 dL g−1 and α = 0.70). Rapid heat–cool calorimetry (RHC) experiments were performed on a prototype RHC of TA Instruments, equipped with liquid nitrogen cooling and specifically designed for operation at high scanning rates.20a,27 RHC measurements were performed at 250 or 500 K min−1 in aluminum crucibles, using helium (6 mL min−1) as a purge gas. TGA experiments were performed at 20 K min−1 in platinum crucibles on a TA Instruments Q5000 TGA using nitrogen (50 mL min−1) as purge gas. Electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry) were performed with an Eco Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat using a three-electrode microcell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (silver wire dipped in a solution of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile). The reference electrode was calibrated against ferrocene/ferrocenium as an external standard. Samples were prepared by dip coating the platinum working electrode in the respective polymer solutions (also used for the solid-state UV-Vis measurements). The CV measurements were done on the resulting films with 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile as electrolyte solution. To prevent air from entering the system, the experiments were carried out under a curtain of argon. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. For the conversion of V to eV, the onset potentials of the first oxidation/reduction peaks were used and referenced to ferrocene/ferrocenium, which has an ionization potential of −4.98 eV vs. vacuum. This correction factor is based on a value of 0.31 eV for Fc/Fc+vs. SCE28a and a value of 4.68 eV for SCE vs. vacuum:28b

OPV device fabrication and characterization
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells were constructed using the traditional architecture glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. Prior to processing, the indium tin oxide (ITO, Kintec, 100 nm, 20 Ohm sq−1) coated substrates were thoroughly cleaned using soap, demineralized water, acetone, isopropanol and a UV/O3 treatment. PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid), Heraeus Clevios] was deposited by spincoating to achieve a layer of ∼30 nm. Afterwards, processing was continued under nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box, starting off with an annealing step at 130 °C for 15 min to remove any residual water. Subsequently, all PCPDTQx:PC71BM (1:3) ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, Solenne) active layer blends were spincoated with optimal thicknesses of ∼80–120 nm, as confirmed by profilometry (DEKTAKST3). Polymer concentrations for the main solvents chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) were varied from 5 to 8 and 12 mg mL−1, respectively. In a final step, the devices were finished off with Ca and Al as top electrodes, with thicknesses of 20 and 80 nm, respectively, resulting in a device active area of 3 mm2. The I–V characteristics were measured using a Newport class A solar simulator (model 91195A) calibrated with a silicon solar cell to give an AM 1.5G spectrum.
EQE measurements were performed with a Newport Apex illuminator (100 W Xenon lamp, 6257) as light source, a Newport Cornerstone 130° monochromator and a Stanford SR830 lock-in amplifier for the current measurements. A silicon FDS100-CAL photodiode was employed as a reference cell. For AFM imaging, a Bruker Multimode 8 AFM was used in PeakForce tapping mode. The images were produced with a silicon tip on a nitride lever with a spring constant of 4 N m−1. Photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) signals were registered from solar cell devices utilizing a pulsed laser (Continuum minilite II, 532 nm), a Tektronix TDS 620B oscilloscope and a Tektronix AFG3101 function generator. The samples were placed in a sample holder filled with nitrogen to avoid exposure to ambient air.
