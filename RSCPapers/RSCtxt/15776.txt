    , Accepted 13th September 2018First published on 14th September 2018AbstractOwing to its excellent chemical stability and low cost, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely studied as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, TiO2's practical applications in solar energy-to-synthetic fuel conversion processes have been constrained by its inherently poor ability to transport photogenerated electrons and holes. In this paper, we report Ta-doped porous TiO2 nanorod arrays on Ta foil (Ta-PTNA) that do not possess this issue and that can thus efficiently photoelectrocatalyze water oxidation, helping the production of H2 (a clean fuel) from water at the expense of solar light. The materials are synthesized by a new, facile synthetic approach involving the hydrothermal treatment of a TiO2 precursor with Ta foil, without seeds and templates, and followed by calcination of the product. Besides serving as a source of Ta dopant atoms, Ta foil is found to play a vital role in the formation of nanopores in the materials. The material obtained with hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 10 h (Ta-PTNA-10), in particular, affords very large photocurrent density and very high photoconversion efficiency (0.32% at 0.79 V vs. RHE, which is better than those of many previously reported photocatalysts and ∼4 times larger than that of undoped TiO2 nanorod arrays). Ta-PTNAs’ remarkable PEC catalytic performance is found to be due to their nanoporous structure and high electronic conductivity.
1. Introduction
The development of alternative, environmentally-friendly energy systems has become critical as the consumption of fossil fuel reserves (petroleum, natural gas, coal, etc.) continues unabated and fossil fuels’ ongoing negative environmental impacts (e.g., water, soil and air pollution) are growing.1,2 These include renewable, clean, carbon-free energy carriers such as dihydrogen (H2), which can reduce and/or eliminate our over-reliance on fossil fuels.3,4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, where the electrolysis of water is driven by sunlight using semiconductor materials as catalysts or photoanodes, is one of the most appealing, sustainable and promising technologies to produce H2.5 Among the various metal oxide semiconductor materials being investigated as photoelectrodes for water splitting, TiO2 has attracted substantial attention ever since the report of PEC water splitting over TiO2 by Fujishima and Honda in 1972.6 However, the intrinsic low electron mobility (1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the short minority carrier (hole) diffusion length (10–100 nm) in TiO2 greatly diminish TiO2's photo-to-current conversion efficiency, even under UV irradiation.7 It has been reported that the rate of photoconversion of light to current on TiO2 can be improved by making TiO2 with nanoscale sizes as well as by tuning its structure and morphology.8–10
Hence, various nanostructured TiO2 electrodes, especially with a one-dimensional (1-D) structure, have been synthesized and studied.11,12 Such materials (especially TiO2 nanowires and nanorods) can attain relatively high solar energy conversion efficiency or photocatalytic performance for water splitting due to their relatively short diffusion pathways for photogenerated holes.13–15 Furthermore, by introducing a nanoporous structure in TiO2 photoanodes, larger contact area between the material and electrolyte, better electron transport, improved light harvesting and greater charge separation efficiency can be achieved in them.16–18 Another approach that has proven to be effective in increasing the catalytic performance of TiO2 photoelectrodes is the incorporation of metal dopants such as Ta into the material.19–21 Among various metal dopants, Ta can be easily incorporated into the TiO2 lattice without causing large distortion due to the similar atomic radius of Ta and Ti elements.22,23 Besides, rutile TiO2 can epitaxially grow on a Ta metal substrate because their perfect crystalline structures match, giving the enhanced combination between TiO2 and the Ta substrate.24 Given these, we had hypothesized that the PEC catalytic performance of TiO2 can be significantly boosted by making it possess all these three features at the same time, namely, 1-D nano-architecture, metallic dopants and nanoporous structures.
To this end, we here report the synthesis of densely grown, nanoporous Ta-doped TiO2 nanorod (1-D) arrays on Ta foil (denoted as Ta-PTNA materials) that can serve as efficient PEC catalysts for water oxidation (Fig. 1a). The synthesis involves a facile two-step procedure comprising the hydrothermal treatment of a TiO2 precursor with Ta foil without any template or capping agents, followed by calcination of the product (see Table S1† and details in Experimental section below). The porous structures in the nanorods seem to have been formed by the Ta-assisted Kirkendall effect, a process that has never before been reported for 1-D TiO2.24,25 Besides serving as a substrate, the Ta foil delivers dopants by undergoing dissolution in the HCl solution used for the synthesis and then providing Ta5+ ions to be incorporated into the cube-shaped TiO2 (rutile) seeds and subsequently to the nanorods growing over the seeds. Finally, pores form in each nanorod of Ta-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays during the calcination step. The resulting Ta-PTNA materials show high photocatalytic activity for PEC water oxidation compared with many other photocatalysts and the undoped TiO2 nanorods prepared on FTO (named undoped TiO2/FTO) as control materials for comparative studies.

2. Experimental section
Synthesis of Ta-PTNA materials
First, Ta foils were cut into small pieces with sizes of ca. 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm. The small pieces of Ti foils were then cleaned in 2-propanol, then acetone, and finally deionized water under sonication (for 30 min each) at room temperature. The Ta foils were further treated with 2 M NaOH solution at 55 °C under sonication for 30 min to remove any tantalum oxide present on their surfaces. After rinsing the solution completely, they were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. They then became ready for growing the Ta-doped nanoporous TiO2 nanorod arrays on them under different conditions as compiled in Table S1.†
For the synthesis of the series of the desired materials, six 15 mL sized Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves were taken, and into each of them 5 mL of deionized water was mixed with 5 mL of concentrated HCl solution. After stirring under ambient conditions for 5 min, into each autoclave 0.20 mL of tetrabutyl titanate was gradually added using a pipette. The solutions were kept stirring for another 15 min, after which a cleaned Ta foil prepared above was placed inside each solution at an angle of 45° against the wall of the Teflon liner. The autoclaves were then immediately kept in an electric oven and the samples were subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for variable periods of time, namely 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 or 24 h. After letting them cool to room temperature, the substrates were taken out of the autoclaves, washed thoroughly with deionized water and allowed to dry under ambient conditions. Finally, the as-obtained samples were calcined at 450 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The products were named Ta-PTNA-t (where t represents the hydrothermal time) (see Table S1†).
In addition, a series of control materials (A series) was synthesized by treating the precursors hydrothermally at temperatures of 160 and 200 °C (instead of 180 °C) for 10 h, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 1 h. A second series of control materials (B series) was obtained by calcining the products obtained hydrothermally at 180 °C for 10 h at different calcination temperatures, namely 250, 300, 350, 400, 500 and 550 °C for 1 h. A third and last series of control materials (C series) was obtained by making the material hydrothermally at 180 °C for 10 h and then calcining the product at 450 °C for different times, i.e. 0, 30 or 120 min. The different synthetic parameters/conditions are all compiled in Table S1† below.
For comparison, undoped TiO2 nanorods were synthesized using fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as a substrate hydrothermally at 180 °C for 10 h and then calcining the product at 450 °C for 1 h. This product was named undoped TiO2/FTO.
Preparation of undoped TiO2 nanorods coated on Ta foil and FTO substrates
Undoped TiO2 nanorods on Ta foil and FTO substrates were synthesized by the drop-coating method. In detail, 6 mg of undoped TiO2 powder was obtained from TiO2/FTO by scrapping off the FTO slide. It was then dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (600 μL) under sonication for 1 h. Then, 20 μL of the resulting suspension of TiO2 nanorods was drop-coated on Ta foil or FTO substrates, and the slides were dried at 60 °C for 30 min. This procedure was repeated 3 times. The materials were then kept at 60 °C for 4 h to dry. Finally, the films were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h.
Instrumentation and materials characterization
Various techniques were used to systemically characterize the as-prepared materials. The crystallographic phase(s) were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max diffractometer operating with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The XRD patterns were obtained in a 2θ range from 20° to 80° at a scan rate of 10° min−1. High resolution XRD patterns were obtained at a scan rate of 0.12° min−1 for the TiO2 sample obtained from Ta foil by scraping and then placed on a Si slide. The Rietveld analysis was performed with the refinement program Topas 3.0. The morphology and microstructure of the materials were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 400) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) and operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F30) equipped with a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The absorption spectra of the TiO2 film were recorded with an UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) using BaSO4 as a reference. X-ray photoelectron spectra and data were acquired with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (ESCALab250) operating with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα). The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The binding energy resolution for the XPS survey and the high-resolution scans were performed with 1 and 0.1 eV, respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 920 system with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 920 fluorimeter with excitation and detection wavelengths at 340 nm and 410 nm, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical analysis and photocatalytic tests
The photocurrent density (Jp) over TiO2 was evaluated in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 7.04) at 50 mV s−1 using a typical three-electrode configuration comprising a TiO2 electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt mesh as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The potential was controlled by a Metrohm Auto Lab (PGSTAT302N). The photoresponse was measured under chopped irradiation from a 300 W Xe lamp (Perfect light PLS-SXE300CUV) equipped with an AM1.5G filter, calibrated with a standard Si solar cell to simulate AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The photoconversion efficiency of the material depends on the applied potential. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE, %) was calculated from the I–V curves using the equation: ABPE = I(1.23 − E)/Jlight, where I is the photocurrent density, E is the applied voltage vs. RHE, and Jlight is the irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G).26 The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is expressed as IPCE = (1240I)/(λ·Plight), where I is the photocurrent density, λ is the incident light wavelength, and Plight is the power density of monochromatic light at a specific wavelength of irradiated light.27 The evolved gases were detected using a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC 7820A).
Electron flux, the number of electrons (Ne), of the AM1.5G solar spectrum was calculated from solar spectral irradiance using the equation: Ne = E·e·[(λ × 10−9)/(h·c)], where e is the charge of electron (1.6022 × 10−19 C), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10−34 J s), and c is the speed of light (2.9979 × 108 m s−1). In addition, the electron flux of the photoanode could be obtained from the product of the AM1.5G electron flux, Ne × ηLHE. Photocurrent density (JAbs) under 100% absorbed photon conversion efficiency was determined by integrating the electron flux at the photoanodes across the 300–420 nm wavelength range.28 The charge injection efficiency (ηInjection) and separation efficiency (ηSeparation) were estimated as functions of applied potential by using 0.5 M potassium phosphate (KH2PO4) buffer solution (pH = 7) with or without 1 M sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). The ηInjection for H2O was defined as the ratio of the photocurrent density of the reaction in H2O (JWat) to the one obtained in Na2SO3 (JSul) (ηinjection = JWat/JSul). The ηSeparation was determined using the equation: ηSeparation = JSul/JAbs, where JAbs is the photocurrent density at 100% internal quantum efficiency.29
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range of 104–0.1 Hz using an amplitude of 20 mV at the open circle potential. The impedance vs. frequency spectra was acquired at the open circuit potential of the system under light illumination. The measured impedance spectroscopic data were fitted into the models of the two RC equivalent circuit with the Zsimpwin software. Afterwards, impedance vs. potential data at a fixed frequency (1 kHz) was obtained to determine the carrier density. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots showing the electron donor density were acquired by using the equation: ND = (2/eεε0)/[d(1/C2)/dV], where C is the space charge layer capacitance, e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant, and ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum.30
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, the structural features of Ta-doped TiO2 nanorods obtained by hydrothermal synthesis at 180 °C were dependent on the hydrothermal time. This is also why the materials were labelled as Ta-PTNA-t, where t denotes the hydrothermal time. In the initial stage (1 h), sparsely distributed, cube-shaped Ta-doped TiO2 nanocrystals were epitaxially grown on Ta foil because their perfect crystalline structures match (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1a†).24 After ca. 5 h, densely grown nanorods, most of which were perpendicularly oriented with respect to the substrate, were observed (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, when the reaction time was increased to 10 h, the top of each TiO2 nanorod gradually dissolved through anisotropic corrosion, forming a hollow opening.31,32 The resulting arrays of Ta-doped TiO2 nanorods, which covered the entire surface of Ta foil, had an average diameter of ca. 600 nm (Fig. 1e). The cross-sectional image (Fig. S2b†) showed that Ta-PTNA-10 possessed vertically aligned nanorods with an average length of ca. 5.0 μm homogeneously grown on the Ta foil. After 15 h, their diameter increased to 700 nm while their length increased to 5.6 μm (Fig. S1d†). However, any further increase in hydrothermal time (e.g., to t = 24 h) at 180 °C did not cause any significant change in the diameter as well as the length of the nanorods, except making most of the nanorods aggregate (Fig. S1e, S2 and S3†). Interestingly, when the hydrothermal treatment was performed at 160 °C, nanorods with no hollow opening resulted (Fig. S4a and b†), and when the synthesis was carried out at 200 °C, most of the nanorods bent down or aggregated (Fig. S4c and d†). Meanwhile, the undoped TiO2/FTO had vertically aligned nanorods with no hollow opening (Fig. S5†). Thus, it can be concluded that Ta plays a major role in the formation of the hollow structure in the nanorods.
SEM-based energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was conducted on a single nanorod of TiO2 scraped from the substrate to eliminate the possible impact of the underlying Ta metal substrate on the analysis. As compiled in Table S2,† the results illustrated that the material obtained at 5 h (Ta-PTNA-5) had a large amount of Ta dopant atoms. This must have been due to the fact that in the initial stage of the reaction the rate of Ta doping was much faster than the rate of growth of TiO2; however, in the later stage the rate of growth of TiO2 remained the same while the rate of Ta doping into TiO2 slowed down because the TiO2 nanorods forming on the surface of the Ta substrate increasingly restricted the dissolution of Ta. Thus, when the reaction time was increased, e.g., to 10 h, a relatively lower amount of Ta dopants made it into the TiO2 nanorods. Increasing the reaction time further, beyond 10 h, however, made the rate of growth of TiO2 slower and the relative amount of Ta dopants in TiO2 concomitantly higher again. Ultimately, 5 h was found to be the optimal hydrothermal time that gives TiO2 nanorods with the highest Ta-to-TiO2 ratio.
The XRD patterns of Ta-PTNA materials obtained with different reaction times (Ta-PTNA-10, -15 and -24) all showed a more intense (101) peak than the (110) peak, indicating the preferential growth of the nanorods along the [001] direction (Fig. S6†). The materials synthesized at 160 and 200 °C and the undoped TiO2/FTO also appeared to have nanorods mainly grown in a similar direction (Fig. S7 and S8†). The Rietveld refinement XRD data of Ta-PTNA-10 revealed that the Ta atoms occupying the Ti sites were ∼1.5% (Fig. S9 and Table S3†). XPS survey spectra demonstrated the presence of Ti, Ta, O and C in Ta-PTNA (Fig. S10†). High-resolution Ti 2p XPS spectra of undoped TiO2/FTO showed two main peaks, at 458.6 and 464.4 eV, which can be assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+, respectively. However, compared with the Ti 2p peaks of undoped TiO2, those of Ta-PTNA-t shifted slightly to lower banding energies, which is most likely due to the presence of the Ta5+ dopant species in TiO2.22,33 It is a fact that the Ta 4f7/2 peak being observed at a binding energy of 25.5 eV, which is between that of Ta2O5 (25.9 eV) and that of metallic Ta (21.9 eV), is consistent with the incorporation of Ta5+ in place of Ti4+ in the TiO2 lattice.34
TEM image and elemental mapping obtained with scanning TEM-based EDX (STEM-EDX) of a single nanorod in Ta-PTNA-10 showed that Ta atoms were present over the entire nanorod (Fig. 2a). The sharp diffraction spots in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken along the zone axis of [−120] (Fig. 2b), indexed as the (001) and (210) planes of rutile TiO2, confirmed the high crystallinity of the material. Furthermore, the high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Fig. 2c) revealed lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.29 nm and 0.21 nm corresponding to the d-spacing of the (001) and (210) crystallographic planes, respectively, of rutile.26 High angle annular dark field (HAADF) images (Fig. 2d) indicated that the Ta-doped TiO2 nanorod possessed lots of pores with sizes ranging from 10 to 50 nm (Fig. 2e). The density and size of pores formed in the nanorods were found to be dependent on the hydrothermal reaction time, calcination time and/or calcination temperature. The density of pores decreased as the hydrothermal time was increased from 5 h to 10 h, but then remained about the same afterwards (Fig. S11†). The pore sizes remained about the same throughout though. While no pores were seen in the nanorods when the calcination temperature was <300 °C (Fig. S12†), pores were increasingly seen as the temperature was >300 °C. The highest pore density was obtained when the nanorods were synthesized at 450 °C for 1 h (Fig. S13†), and larger-sized pores, albeit in lower density, were seen in those obtained using higher temperatures (e.g., 550 °C) for 1 h (Fig. S12†). Meanwhile, only a few pores were observed in the nanorods of undoped TiO2/FTO (Fig. S11†). These results indicate once again that Ta plays a role in the formation of the pores in the TiO2 nanorods, most likely through the Kirkendall effect involving an ion exchange between the Ta5+ dopant species and Ti4+ ions in the nanorods.35,36

The photoelectrocatalytic activities of Ta-PTNA-t materials and the control material (i.e., undoped TiO2/FTO) for water oxidation were then evaluated. The photocurrent density over Ta-PTNA-t materials increased as the calcination time, t, was increased from 3 to 10 h, but then decreased afterwards (Fig. 3a, S14 and S15a†). In other words, the material obtained with t = 10 h (Ta-PTNA-10) showed the best catalytic activity toward the reaction. At an applied potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE) and without a co-catalyst, a high current density of 1.1 mA cm−2 was generated with this material, and this is comparable with those obtained with the state-of-the-art TiO2-based photoanodes and higher than those previously reported for other Ta-doped TiO2 materials (Table S4†).13,14,37–40 Ta-PTNA-3 and Ta-PTNA-5 exhibited lower photocurrent densities of 0.24 and 0.61 mA cm−2, respectively, at the same potential. The relatively lower photocurrent given by these two materials can be accounted for by their randomly orientated, lower density nanorods (Fig. S1b and S1c†). Ta-PTNA-15 and Ta-PTNA-24 also gave lower photocurrent densities (0.94 and 0.72 mA cm−2, respectively) than Ta-PTNA-10, though they both gave better photocurrent densities than undoped TiO2/FTO. The lower photocurrent density of these two materials compared with that of Ta-PTNA-10 may be the result of their smaller surface area and aggregated nanorods, which give rise to longer diffusion pathways (Fig. S1 and S2†).14,41 The Ta-PTNA materials obtained at hydrothermal temperatures of 160 and 200 °C also showed lower current density compared with Ta-PTNA-10. These two materials have lower crystallinity and aggregated structure, respectively, due to the respective lower (160 °C) and higher (200 °C) hydrothermal temperatures used to synthesize them (Fig. S4, S7 and S15b†). Ta-PTNA-10 obtained using 450 °C as the calcination temperature exhibited the best catalytic performance compared to the corresponding materials obtained using lower and higher calcination temperatures (Fig. S15c†); this is because the nanorods obtained at lower temperatures (below ca. 400 °C) had less pore density and those obtained at higher temperatures (above ca. 500 °C) peeled off from the substrate or were unstable (Fig. S16†).

The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE, %) as a function of the applied potential (Fig. 3b) revealed that Ta-PTNA-10 gave the highest efficiency, with a value of 0.32% at 0.79 V, which is ∼4 times higher than that of undoped TiO2/FTO (0.08%). Ta-PTNA-5, Ta-PTNA-15 and Ta-PTNA-24 also afforded optimal ABPE efficiencies of 0.18%, 0.22% and 0.17% at an applied bias of 0.79 V, respectively. Amperometric I–t curves determined at 1.23 V under chopped light irradiation over the materials displayed nearly vertical rise and fall in the values of current densities (Fig. 3c). This indicated that the charge transport in the photoelectrodes occurred quickly in the direct electron transfer pathway provided by the nanorods in Ta-PTNA materials.10 Moreover, no significant loss of current density was observed after 10 h of reaction under light (Fig. S17a†). In addition, the H2 production rate is ∼15.9 μmol h−1 at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. S17b†). Abundant bubbles were observed at both the photoanode and cathode (Fig. S17c and d†), suggesting that the photocurrent increase after irradiation merely comes from the splitting of water but not some other reactions on the photoanode.42 Furthermore, the maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) over the Ta-PTNA-10 photoelectrode under incident light of 390 nm were found to be 48% whereas the corresponding value over the undoped TiO2/FTO photoelectrode was only ca. 25% (Fig. 3d). This means that charge carrier separation and transport were more effective in Ta-TNRAs-10 than in the undoped TiO2 nanorods.
To obtain a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the higher photocurrent density, three possible fundamental processes taking place during photoelectrocatalysis were systemically investigated by taking into consideration the following equation:29 JP = JAbs × ηInjection × ηSeparation(1)where JP is the measured photocurrent density for water oxidation, JAbs is the photocurrent density at 100% internal quantum efficiency, ηInjection is the efficiency of the involvement of surface-reaching holes in water oxidation, and ηSeparation is the photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency. UV-Vis spectra clearly showed that the largest absorbance between 300 to 420 nm was shown by Ta-PTNA-10, followed by Ta-PTNA-15 and then Ta-PTNA-24 (Fig. 4a and b), a result that is well in line with their PEC performances. This is in accordance with their porous and hollow opening in their 1-D structure, which must have allowed multiple reflections of light to occur in these materials (Fig. 4a and Fig. S21†).43 (Note that the absorbance between 420–600 nm (Fig. S18–S20†) was mainly due to Ta foil, which does not directly contribute to Ta-PTNAs’ photocatalytic activity.) Besides, all the Ta-PTNA materials showed higher ηInjection than undoped TiO2/FTO (∼80% at 1.23 V (vs. RHE)). Most notably, the Ta-PTNA-10 photoelectrode gave ηInjection of 98% (Fig. 4c and Fig. S22†). This high value of ηInjection is most likely due to the porous structures in the nanorods of this material, which allow the electrolyte to easily reach its catalytic sites and the photogenerated holes to have short diffusion pathways over the material.28,44 However, compared with the value of ηInjection of undoped TiO2/FTO at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), that of Ta-PTNA-10 was only 1.25 times higher and not large enough to explain its ∼3 times higher catalytic performance. The additional factor must have been the favorable charge separation observed in Ta-PTNA-10 by experiments. Ta-PTNA-10 showed higher ηSeparation (= JSul/JAbs, where JSul is the measured photocurrent density for sulphite oxidation) of 60% at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4d, S21 and S23†), which is larger than those of other Ta-PTNA materials and 2.4 times as high as that of undoped TiO2/FTO (25%). Based on these results, it can be concluded that Ta-PTNAs’ structure significantly inhibits charge recombination and facilitates the consumption of photogenerated holes during photoelectrocatalysis (Fig. 4a).

(b) UV-Vis absorbance spectra, (c) calculated charge injection efficiency, and (d) charge separation efficiency for Ta-PTNA-t and undoped TiO2/FTO photoanodes. 
In the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots (Fig. 5a), the Ta-PTNA-10 photoelectrode exhibited the smallest slope and gave the highest calculated donor density (2.87 × 1018 cm−3) among all of the Ta-PTNA materials (Table S5†).45 It is worth mentioning that direct comparison of M–S slopes and donor densities of Ta-PTNA-10 and undoped TiO2/FTO may not be precise due to the different underlying substrates in them, i.e., Ta foil versus FTO (Fig. 5b and Fig. S24†). To get around this issue, the Ta-PTNA-10 nanorods were scraped off the Ta foil and then coated on FTO (Fig. 5c). This electrode showed a smaller M–S slope and larger donor density than the scraped undoped TiO2/FTO. This result suggested that the Ta doping in TiO2 nanoarrays resulted in higher electron density and electronic conductivity (see Fig. S24† for more detailed explanation).

(d) Potential energy diagrams of undoped TiO2/FTO and Ta-PTNA-10. 
By taking the x intercept of linear fit in the M–S plots, the flat band potential (EFB) can be obtained. As depicted in Fig. 5c, the EFB of the undoped TiO2/FTO and Ta-PTNA-10 was 0.24 V and 0.14 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Assuming the gap between the flat band potential and the bottom edge of the conduction band can be negligible for n-type semiconductors, the potential energy diagram (Fig. 5d) was determined by the EFB and the optical band gap energies (Tauc plot).46–48 The results suggest that Ta doping makes both the flat band potential and the conduction band potential undergo a cathodic shift with a value of 0.1 V. This negative shift in the flat band potential is not only favorable for the inhibition of photogenerated hole–electron recombination but also beneficial for the material to find practical application as an electrode to generate H2 from water.48,49
The EIS spectra of all the materials (Fig. 6) showed Nyquist plots consisting of two semicircles in the high to low frequency regions, corresponding to the resistance of electron transport within the electrode and at the electrode/electrolyte interface, respectively.50 The equivalent circuits depicted in Fig. S25† were employed to fit the EIS data to obtain the optimum fitting values (Tables S6–S10†). The arches for Ta-PTNA-10 were much smaller than those for all the control materials (Fig. 6 and Fig. S26†), especially undoped TiO2/FTO, confirming again that Ta doping gave rise to faster charge carrier transport and lower resistance in the electrode. It is worth adding that the semicircles related to the electron transport within electrodes in the dark are much larger than those under illumination in both cases (Ta-PTNA-10 and undoped TiO2/FTO) (Fig. 26a†), demonstrating that the photogenerated charge carriers substantially reduced the charge-transfer resistance. The larger resistance was obtained for the materials obtained by calcination at <400 °C or at >500 °C (Fig. 6b), likely because of their low pore density and greater tendency to peel off from the underlying substrate, respectively. In contrast, owing to its large surface area, Ta-PTNA-10 exhibited a greater interfacial charge transfer rate between itself and the electrolyte and substantially lower electron–hole recombination rate.51,52 To further investigate the photogenerated carrier transfer behavior of Ta-PTNA-10 and the undoped TiO2 materials, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fig. S27a†) was conducted at room temperature. The PL intensity at 410 nm of Ta-PTNA-10 is lower than that of the undoped material, indicating that Ta doping has significantly suppressed the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.53 Moreover, the fluorescence lifetime values, calculated from time resolved PL spectroscopy (Fig. S27b†), are 0.54 and 0.68 ns for undoped TiO2 and Ta-PTNA-10, respectively. The prolonged fluorescence lifetime of Ta-PTNA-10 is related to the long life of electrons in the excited state, which can enhance the charge separation efficiency and retard charge recombination, and thus give better performance for photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation.54,55

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, Ta-doped porous TiO2 nanorod arrays (Ta-PTNAs) have been successfully synthesized via a simple, template-free synthetic route. The porous structure in the nanorod arrays is believed to have been formed by the Ta-assisted Kirkendall effect. Compared with undoped TiO2/FTO and many other previously reported photocatalysts, Ta-PTNA photoanodes showed much higher PEC catalytic activity toward water oxidation. Ta-PTNAs’ excellent photocatalytic activity has been attributed to their Ta dopants, large porosity and 1-D structure, and the low charge recombination rate on them. The reported Ta-PTNA materials can thus become promising photoelectrodes for a variety of solar energy-based applications such as solar cells, besides photoelectrocatalytic water.
