    , Accepted 4th February 2019First published on 7th February 2019AbstractHydrogen and ammonia have attracted attention as potential energy vectors due to their abundance and minimal environmental impact when used as a fuel source. To be a commercially viable alternative to fossil fuels, gaseous fuel sources must adhere to a wide range of standards specifying hydrogen delivery temperature, gravimetric capacity and cost. In this article, an ammonium chloride–metal hydride reaction cycle that enables the solid thermal decomposition products to be recycled using industrial processes is proposed. A range of metal hydrides and metal amides were reacted with ammonium chloride to determine the reaction pathways, products and overall feasibility of the cycle. The NH4Cl–MH (MH = metal hydride) and NH4Cl–MNH2 (MNH2 = metal amide) mixtures were heated to temperatures of up to 500 °C. The resulting products were experimentally characterised using temperature program desorption residual gas analysis, simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis and in situ powder X-ray diffraction. Similar analysis was undertaken to determine the effect of catalyst addition to the starting materials. A maximum yield of 41 wt% of hydrogen and ammonia gas mixtures were released from the NH4Cl–MH materials at a maximum yield of 41 wt%. This exceptional gravimetric capacity allows for volumetric gas densities (363–657 kg m−3) that are much higher than pure NH3, H2 or metal hydride materials. Overall, this reaction cycle allows carbon-neutral regeneration of the starting materials, making it a potential sustainable energy option.
Introduction
With world energy consumption projected to exceed 18000 TW h by 2035,1 investment in the development of sustainable energy technologies has never been more important. Hydrogen is an attractive potential energy vector. It is universally abundant on earth, and its combustion does not produce any carbon dioxide or nitrous oxides, resulting in minimal environmental impact. Storing hydrogen in a high volumetric density system that flexibly links its production and use as an energy source is a critical part of developing a hydrogen economy.2–4
Hydrogen is traditionally stored in cylinders as a liquid at cryogenic temperatures or as a gas at high pressure.5 Storage of hydrogen as a high-pressure gas is preferable in industrial facilities and laboratories, where weight and volume capacities are not limiting factors. Storage of hydrogen as a liquid is also not suitable for energy applications, as liquefaction can lead to a loss of up to 40% of energy content. Boil-off and safety concerns involving high-pressure build up upon cooling failure are also factors to consider.6 The development of an efficient hydrogen storage system to overcome these barriers would provide a long-term solution to meet global energy demands in a sustainable manner.
Metal hydrides are of special interest to the hydrogen storage community. They have the capacity to be developed from inexpensive or abundant materials such as sodium, magnesium, calcium and titanium, and form a variety of hydrogen-containing species including ionic hydrides, complex hydrides and interstitial hydrides.7–11 The thermal energy density of metal hydrides is up to thirty times more than molten salts, currently used to store solar energy.3,12,13 They also have the potential to reversibly absorb large amounts of hydrogen which makes them ideal for fuel cell applications.
When in the form of metal hydrides, light metals such as lithium, sodium, magnesium and aluminium are appealing hydrogen storage candidates due to their low atomic weight and high gravimetric hydrogen content.3,4,7–9,11,13 The higher the hydrogen–metal ratio and the lighter the metal elements incorporated into these compounds, the higher the hydrogen capacity of the material. Increasing the hydrogen capacity of a material is in effect, increasing its gravimetric energy density. Complex hydrides containing these lightweight metals such as borohydrides, transition metal hydrides, amides, imides and alanates are under investigation for use in hydrogen storage applications due to their potential high hydrogen weight capacities.2–4,8,9
Ammonia has also been receiving heightened attention as a potential medium of indirect hydrogen storage and as an independent fuel source.14–16 Ammonia releases 316.80 kJ mol−1 of energy during combustion.17 This high energy release inspired Green to propose it as an energy vector in 1982.18 Ammonia's combustion reaction simply releases nitrogen and water (eqn (1)), both naturally present in the earth's atmosphere, although a small amount of NOx may be produced as a by-product.19 Providing the nitrogen and hydrogen used to synthesise the ammonia are derived from clean and renewable sources, this reaction does not result in the release of hazardous air pollutants such as CO2, SO2 and soot.20 Generally NH3 has a narrow flammability limit of 15.5% to 27% volume in air,20 which leads to a low combustion rate. However, recent studies have shown that the presence of hydrogen during ammonia combustion can lower combustion temperatures and increase the burning velocity of ammonia flames. In addition, ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) that can directly utilise ammonia without the requirement for cracking have been developed.21 4NH3(g) + 3O2(g) → 2N2(g) + 6H2O (316.8 kJ mol−1 NH3)(1)
The Haber–Bosch process22 has made ammonia readily available at a cost ranging from US$385 to $770 per tonne.23 In fact, global ammonia production is projected to exceed 150 mega tonnes per annum by the end of the decade.24 Infrastructure for large-scale ammonia transportation also exists in the form of trucks, tank carriage, barge, ships and pipelines.25 Therefore, an ammonia based fuel cycle could be expanded to an industrial scale without the need for any new infrastructure. Many factors have prevented the utilisation of ammonia as a large scale commercial fuel source as it is acutely toxic if inhaled, and highly harmful if released into marine environments.26 The risk associated with ammonia's toxicity can be mitigated by storing it as a solid in the form of metal amines, ammonium chlorides, ammonium carbonates or urea, although infrastructure to retrieve the ammonia from the solid form (such as thermal treatment) still needs further development.27
In recent studies, ammonium complexes of metal hydrides or metal ammine complexes and metal amines have been under scrutiny as a means of high-density ammonia and hydrogen storage.14,16,28–31 Upon thermal treatment, these complexes produce either NH3 and/or H2. Rather than using ammonia directly as a fuel source, David et al. have reported a promising method of extracting hydrogen from ammonia or “ammonia cracking”.14 By passing ammonia through a sodium amide catalyst powder they achieved a 99.2% ammonia decomposition efficiency at a temperature of 530 °C. Technology for an ammonia cracking fuel cell using a zirconium-based catalyst has also been patented.32
More recently, high purity H2 (99.99%) has been produced using a two-step process with initial decomposition of NH3 using a 1 wt% Ru on Al2O3 catalyst, followed by purification of the hydrogen using Pd-coated tubular vanadium membranes.33 The catalyst and membrane are operated at temperatures of 450 and 340 °C, respectively. Other reported hydrogen/ammonia separation membrane systems include Pd, Pd–Ag, vanadium alloys and Nb.34 Additionally, adsorption of ammonia into zeolites has been shown to be an efficient method to purify H2 produced from ammonia.34
Li and Hurley investigated the effect of the presence of palladium(II) and palladium(IV) chlorides and ammonium chloride on the reaction between ammonia and magnesium hydride.35 Their results showed that the addition of palladium(II) chloride and ammonium chloride increased the concentration of hydrogen in the released ammonia by up to 20% compared to a non-doped system. This article, along with a study on the effect of La3+ on the dehydrogenation of LiAlH4–NH4Cl,36 is one of the few articles in current literature that examines ammonium chloride in a metal hydride system.
For the ammonia cycle to be feasible and especially allow ammonia-based materials to be used in vehicular or stationary applications, cracking of ammonia must be achieved at a temperature lower than the current limit of 450 °C in order to reduce energy costs.37 In fact, for vehicular applications, a conversion temperature of ∼100 °C would be ideal, with high density storage of ammonia/hydrogen a necessity. In addition, the cycle must use cost-effective materials that can be reprocessed.
In this study, the reactions of ammonium chloride with sodium, magnesium, lithium and calcium hydrides and sodium and lithium amides have been experimentally characterised to determine the temperature at which gas release occurs. An evolved gas composition of N2 and H2 would be ideal for technical applications as this would allow technological applications using a PEM fuel cell. The addition of PdCl2 as a catalyst has been explored to promote the formation of H2 rather than NH3. A number of complementary analysis techniques have been employed to determine the reaction pathway and products including temperature program desorption residual gas analysis, simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis and in situ powder X-ray diffraction. In addition, a cost-effective cycle has been proposed, demonstrating the recyclability of the reaction products.
Experimental
All handling of chemicals was undertaken in an argon-atmosphere Mbraun Unilab glovebox to minimise oxygen (O2 < 1 ppm) and water (H2O < 1 ppm) contamination. NH4Cl (>99.5%), NaH (>95%), LiH (−30 mesh, >95.5%), MgH2 (hydrogen storage grade), LiNH2 (>99.5%) and PdCl2 (>99.9%), all purchased from Sigma Aldrich and NaNH2 (>95%, Fluka) were used as supplied with no further purification. CaH2 powder was prepared by the hydrogenation of Ca powder (99%, granular, Sigma Aldrich) under a H2 pressure of 30 bar and a temperature of 400 °C for 18 h.
The ammonium chloride and metal hydride (MH)/metal amide (MNH2) powders were mixed by ball milling (BM) at 450 rpm in a PQ-NO4 Planetary Ball Mill employing tempered steel vials and balls in an Ar atmosphere. A ball-to-powder mass ratio of 15:1 was employed, in 15 cycles of two minutes milling and a two-minute pause, giving a total milling time of 30 minutes. The stoichiometry of the mixed samples are presented in Table 1. The sample catalysed with PdCl2 was prepared by combining the previously BM NH4Cl + NaH powder with either 1 or 10 mol% PdCl2 using an agate mortar and pestle for 2 to 3 minutes under an argon atmosphere.

The HSC software v6.1 (ref. 17) was used to estimate the thermodynamics of the reactions between NH4Cl and the metal hydrides/amides to form the corresponding metal chloride, NH3 and H2 (the enthalpy of formation, ΔHof of LiNH2 was taken from ref. 39). All reactions, Table S1,† were predicted to be exothermic at room temperature with reaction enthalpies ranging between −6.1 and −86.1 kJ mol−1 of NH4Cl.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using the Bruker AXS D8 Advance Discover XRD System (λ = 1.5406 Å) set at 40 kV and 40 mA. The data was collected with a proportional counter, using a step scan from 2° to 80° 2θ with 0.03 degree steps for 0.6 s per step. XRD sample holders covered with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) airtight dome were used to prevent oxygen/moisture contamination during data collection. The PMMA airtight bubble results in a broad hump in XRD patterns centred at ∼20° 2θ. In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) was performed at the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne, Australia.40 Powdered samples were loaded in a quartz capillary (outer diameter 0.7 mm, wall thickness 0.01 mm) that were then, using graphite ferrules, mounted in 1/16′′ tube fittings in a glove box filled with purified argon (<1 ppm O2 and H2O). The sample holder was then connected to a H2 gas filling/vacuum manifold and the capillary heated with a hot air blower with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1in vacuo. The temperature of the hot-air blower was calibrated against the known thermal expansion coefficients for NaCl and Ag.41,42 One-dimensional SR-XRD patterns (monochromatic X-rays with λ = 1.0003896(1) Å) were collected using a Mythen, microstrip detector with an exposure time of 54 s per pattern. The capillary was rotated 120° during exposure to improve the powder averaging. The crystalline phases were identified by reference to the ICDD PDF database. Diffraction patterns were quantitatively analysed with the Rietveld method using the TOPAS software (Bruker-AXS).
TPD-MS (Temperature Programmed Desorption-Mass Spectrometry) was performed on a quadrupole mass spectrometer residual gas analyser (Stanford Research Systems RGA 300). For each measurement, approximately 0.5 mg of sample was outgassed at below 4 × 10−7 mbar over a minimum of 3 hours. While still under vacuum, the samples were heated up to 480 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Interpretation of the MS data was carried out using RGA Version 3.218.004 (SRS) using m/z = 2 for H2 and 17 for NH3. Simultaneous Differential Scanning Calorimetry-Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (DSC-TGA) was performed on a Mettler Toledo DSC 3+ using sample masses of ∼10 mg at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under an argon flow of 20 mL min−1. The temperature accuracy of this instrument is ±0.2 °C, while the balance has an accuracy of ±20 μg.
Results and discussion
Thermal analysis and decomposition pathway
The NH4Cl and metal hydride mixtures were ball-milled for 30 min to maximise homogeneity but also minimise any potential reaction that could occur due to the heat generated during the milling process. Any reaction would result in capacity loss of gases evolved during thermal analysis. Table 1 summarises each of the mixtures employed in this study along with primary results of thermal experiments including DSC-TGA-RGA and also theoretical thermodynamic calculations.
Thermal decomposition of pure NH4Cl
The decomposition of commercial ammonium chloride was measured by in situ SR-XRD and DSC-TGA (Fig. 1 and S1†) to allow direct comparison against the decomposition pathway of the measured NH4Cl–MH and NH4Cl–MNH2 powder mixtures. The DSC data shows two endothermic events with peak maxima at 190 °C (corresponding to the phase II (LT-NH4Cl) and phase I (HT-NH4Cl) solid–solid phase transition), and 310 °C (corresponding to the decomposition of NH4Cl), which was in agreement with literature values.43,44 The TGA shows a distinct sublimation onset at ∼208 °C, ending at ∼330 °C, with a total mass loss of 94 wt%, allowing for the purity of the starting material.

The in situ SR-XRD data corroborates the thermal analysis results. Phase analysis of the material shows that the material at room temperature has Bragg peaks corresponding to LT-NH4Cl only (space group (SG) Pmm). At ∼190 °C there is a phase change corresponding to the solid–solid phase transition from the LT-NH4Cl to HT-NH4Cl (SG Fmm) followed by the subsequent start of decomposition at ∼200 °C.
Thermal decomposition of NH4Cl + NaH
Quantitative analysis of the SR-XRD data of the starting material at room temperature (RT) indicates that the BM material consists of NH4Cl (66.3(2) wt%), NaH (29.3(2) wt%), NaOH (2.2(2) wt%) and NaCl (2.1(1) wt%) (Fig. 2a and S2†). The small quantity of NaCl observed at RT can only be distinguished by the [022] reflection at 2θ = 29.0° due to the [002] (2θ = 20.4°) reflection being overlapped by the [111] peak of NaH. At ∼100 °C the [022] reflection for NaCl clearly starts to increase in intensity corresponding to the onset of decomposition with a corresponding initial gas detection at ∼90 °C for the RGA and TGA (Fig. 2b, d, region (i) and Fig. S2†). The first decomposition event is exothermic having a maximum heat flow at 161 °C and ending at ∼180 °C (Fig. 2c). Coincidentally, NaH is no longer observed by SR-XRD after ∼185 °C, while any remaining LT-NH4Cl transitions to the HT phase, which is denoted by an endothermic peak by DSC (peak max = 187 °C). In addition, a splitting of the NaH Bragg peaks is observed to occur above 100 °C which is associated with the dissolution of NaOH impurities into the NaH lattice.11 From TGA, the mass loss in the first decomposition step was measured as 16.8%, while quantitative Rietveld refinement determined that 85 wt% of NH4Cl has been consumed along with 100% NaH, giving a weight loss of 16% consisting of 0.85NH3 and 0.925H2.

Region (ii): contains NaH, LT-NH4Cl, NaOH and NaCl phases. Region (iii) contains NaCl, NaOH and HT-NH4Cl phases. Region (iv) contains NaCl. For complete phase identification of XRD data see Fig. S2.† ΔT/t = 5 °C min−1. λ = 1.0003896(1) Å. Endothermic heat flow in the down direction for DSC data. 
The remaining NH4Cl decomposes in an endothermic process, with a maximum rate of H2 and NH3 release at ∼215 °C, leaving NaCl as the only crystalline product. For the remaining HT-NH4Cl to not decompose into HCl and NH3, a Na source, other than NaCl, must be present in order to form NaCl, H2 and NH3. Crystalline NaOH is still present up to ∼200 °C allowing for a Na source. Beyond this temperature, it is likely that an amorphous NaOH species may exist. This is corroborated by the fact that only H2 and NH3 were observed by RGA above 200 °C. Overall, a total mass loss of 24.8 wt% was measured before 260 °C, which is close to the expected mass loss of 24.6 wt%.
Thermal decomposition of NH4Cl + LiH
Initial laboratory based XRD of the NH4Cl + LiH starting material at RT directly after BM indicates that the material consisted of LT-NH4Cl (89(2) wt%), LiH (10(2) wt%) and LiCl (1.0(2) wt%) (Fig. S3†), indicating that negligible decomposition occurred during the process. After eight months of storage at RT under an Ar atmosphere SR-XRD was conducted. At this point some decomposition had occurred with a composition of NH4Cl (78.2(5) wt%), LiH (8.4(5) wt%) and LiCl (13.4(1) wt%) being determined (Fig. 3a, S3 and S4†). This suggests that the mixture of these two materials is only metastable. According to the RGA data (Fig. 3d), onset of H2 desorption occurs at 115 °C, while NH3 was not detected until 145 °C. The SR-XRD data shows that at ∼135 °C the LiCl phase ([111] Bragg peak at ∼2θ = 19.2°), by observation of the data, starts to increase in intensity while at 182 °C the LT-NH4Cl phase disappears ([011] Bragg peak at ∼2θ = 20.8°) with some undergoing a phase transformation to HT-NH4Cl. At ∼200 °C quantitative Rietveld refinement determines that the sample consists of HT-NH4Cl (38.9(4) wt%), LiCl (58.1(5) wt%) and LiH (3.0(6) wt%). The initial quantity of LiH may be diminished compared to the theoretical value due to the reduced X-ray scattering of the light Li and H atoms compared to N and Cl. As a result, the peaks for LiH are barely visible in the initial diffraction pattern thus quantification by XRD may not be totally dependable throughout.

Region (iv) contains LiCl. For complete phase identification of XRD data see Fig. S4.† ΔT/t = 5 °C min−1. λ = 1.0003896(1) Å. Endothermic heat flow in the down direction for DSC data. 
The remaining HT-NH4Cl decomposes in an endothermic process having a maximum heat flow at 264 °C (Fig. 3c) and a peak desorption rate measured by RGA for both H2 and NH3 at 241 °C. The final crystalline product is LiCl although 2.5(6) wt% LiH was also observed upon completion of the XRD experiment. Overall a total mass loss of 35.5 wt% was measured below 268 °C by TGA (Fig. 3b), which is close to the theoretical mass loss of 31.0 wt%. There are subtle variations of an otherwise linear weight change in this region which are most easily observed in the derivative of the TGA pattern (Fig. S5†). As LiH is still observable at the end of the in situ SR-XRD experiment, the exaggerated mass loss of an additional 4.5% may be attributed to the direct decomposition of NH4Cl into NH3 and HCl. Although HCl was not detected by RGA, the gas release profile of NH3 and H2 appear to be similar and it may be assumed that the HCl may react with the stainless steel tubing producing H2 at the same rate as NH3 is detected.
Thermal decomposition of NH4Cl + NaNH2
The SR-XRD pattern of the initial BM mixture of NH4Cl and NaNH2 indicates that some decomposition has occurred during milling with the observation of NaCl along with the NH4Cl and NaNH2 starting materials (Fig. 4a and S6†). In addition, impurity NaOH and another unknown phase were identified. Upon reaching ∼146 °C during in situ SR-XRD measurements, all remnants of NaNH2 had disappeared. At this point, excluding the unknown phase, the composition of the material determined by quantitative phase analysis is ∼42.7(5) wt% of NH4Cl, 28.7(4) wt% NaCl and 28.5(8) wt% NaOH. The LT to HT phase change for NH4Cl begins at ∼164 °C, while the HT-phase undergoes decomposition and is unidentifiable by ∼215 °C. The NaOH and the unknown phase are no longer detected by ∼190 and ∼200 °C, respectively, leaving NaCl as the only crystalline phase. While it was not possible to index the Bragg peaks for the unknown phase, it is believed that it is a Na(OH)1−x(NH2)x phase.45 The formation of this material during BM would also ascertain why NaCl is observed in the initial material.

Endothermic heat flow in the down direction for DSC data. 
Thermal decomposition of NH4Cl + LiNH2
The SR-XRD pattern of the BM mixture of NH4Cl and LiNH2 contains 57.4(1) wt% NH4Cl, 20.3(1) wt% LiNH2, 21.8(1) wt% LiCl, and 0.43(9) wt% Li2O indicating that some decomposition occurred during the milling process (Fig. 5a and S7†). This assumption is corroborated by TGA data, in which a 38 wt% loss is observed rather than the theoretical value of 44.5 wt% (Fig. 5b). As the BM initial sample contained 21.8(1) wt% LiCl, assuming a 1:1 reaction product of LiCl:NH3 (Table 1), this equates to 8.8 wt% NH3 desorbed during milling, which is close to the difference between the measured and theoretical TGA capacities.

Region (iii) contains LiNH2, LiCl, Li2O, unknown and HT-NH4Cl phases. Region (iv) contains LiCl. For complete phase identification of XRD data see Fig. S7.† ΔT/t = 5 °C min−1. λ = 1.0003896(1) Å. Endothermic heat flow in the down direction for DSC data. 
Thermal analysis of the material by TGA indicates that the onset temperature of decomposition occurs at 80 °C (Fig. 5b). The broad exothermic event in the DSC data originating at 90 °C, with a maxima of 143 °C, is attributed to a slow reaction between NH4Cl and LiNH2, producing NH3 gas (Fig. 5c). This step produces 9 wt% NH3 between 80 and 152 °C. NH3, along with a miniscule quantity of H2, continues to be desorbed until 175 °C (Fig. 5d), at which point in situ XRD indicates that the phase change from LT-NH4Cl to HT-NH4Cl occurs with subsequent decomposition between ∼180 and 210 °C (Fig. 5a and S7†). An endothermic peak is also observed in this regime, with a peak heat flow at 190 °C. The decomposition of LiNH2 appears to be present until ∼280 °C as observed in the in situ SR-XRD experiment, even after the decomposition of NH4Cl at ∼220 °C. In addition, three Bragg peaks of a minor unknown phase are observed at 14.6, 19.5, 20.8, 22.7 and 29.5° 2θ. This phase increases in crystallinity from ∼60 °C until disappearing at ∼280 °C. The decomposition of NH4Cl, LiNH2 and the unknown phase explain the broad endothermic peak in the DSC data between 200 and 280 °C along with a concomitant slow release of NH3. The decomposition temperature of lithium amide is therefore greatly reduced compared to that of the pure material, an effect that was also noted when exploring the effect of Cl− on LiNH2 with the addition of LiCl.46
Thermal decomposition of 2NH4Cl + MgH2
The initial composition of the BM material measured by SR-XRD indicates that NH4Cl, MgH2 and Mg are present in the powder (Fig. 6a and S8†). In situ SR-XRD of the powder shows that the phase transition onset of LT-NH4Cl to HT-NH4Cl begins at ∼176 °C with no more LT-NH4Cl being observed at 197 °C. Any remnants of HT-NH4Cl disappears at 248 °C. In addition to the NH4Cl phase change and decomposition, a new phase emerges at 170 °C, which has a maximum intensity at ∼242 °C and a decomposition temperature of 258 °C. This phase can be indexed to a tetragonal phase with lattice parameters of 5.01746(2), 5.01746(2), 16.2398(1) Å at ∼240 °C corresponding to a possible space group of I4/mmm. A possible structure is (NH4)2MgCl4 which is isomorphous with K2MgCl4.47 MgH2 appears to start decomposing at 190 °C and is last observed at 294 °C. During the decomposition regime of MgH2 and the (NH4)2MgCl4 phase, two unknown phases begins to appear at ∼248 °C and disappear by 311 and 330 °C. Due to the analogous nature of (NH4)2MgCl4 to the K2MgCl4 system, the unit cells for K3Mg2Cl7 and KMgCl3 were evaluated but not match either of the unknown phases.48 In addition, Mg(NH3)xCl2 (x = 1, 2, 4, 6) were considered as potential side products in the reaction. While these products may be thermodynamically preferred in this temperature range, none of them were observed. This may be a consequence of the slow reaction between the NH4Cl and the metal hydride/amide that means that the metal ammine chlorides are not kinetically preferred products. This is supported by the large amount of NH4Cl that is still present in the sample that directly decomposes to NH3 and HCl between ∼270 and 320 °C. Within this temperature range Mg(NH3)2Cl2 is the only likely compound to exist49 and unfortunately none of the unknown phases match the measured lattice parameters or unit cell.50

MgCl2 is not observed until ∼300 °C and is the major crystalline phase after 330 °C, along with another minor unknown phase.
The thermal analysis data correlates extremely well with the crystallographic data, which shows that there are three distinct decomposition events, each containing multiple components Fig. 6b–d. The first event releases NH3 and H2 between ∼125 to ∼250 °C, as determined by RGA. DSC analysis identifies four endothermic maxima (177, 185, 200 and 215 °C), while TGA indicates a corresponding mass loss of 10.5 wt%. Between 225 and 238 °C, a mass loss of 4.5 wt% is observed, along with a triplet of exothermic peaks at 225, 228 and 232 °C. Between 238 and 264 °C a doublet of endothermic events 243 and 259 °C and an associated mass loss of 5.2 wt% is observed. After 264 °C a large exothermic peak is determined with a maximum heat flow at 334 °C. The event continues until 355 °C where 10.8 wt% of NH3 and H2 is released. Overall, 40.4 wt% loss is detected by TGA despite a theoretical loss of 28.6 wt%. This would indicate a loss of a quarter of the Cl content, although analysis of the RGA for HCl and N2 indicated no loss of gaseous Cl containing products. As construed in the reaction between NH4Cl + LiH, it is possible that HCl may be produced during the decomposition of NH4Cl causing a continued detection of H2 throughout the remaining experiment.
Thermal decomposition of 2NH4Cl + CaH2
Compared to the 2NH4Cl + MgH2 mixture, the decomposition of 2NH4Cl + CaH2 is relatively simple. The initial mixture was determined to contain only NH4Cl (71.8(1) wt%) and CaH2 (28.2(1) wt%), as expected, by SR-XRD (Fig. 7a and S9†). NH3 and H2 are observed by RGA starting at ∼120 °C and both having maxima at 230 °C (Fig. 7d). A second NH3 peak is observed at 273 °C and is no longer detected after 365 °C. H2 meanwhile, is continuously evolved throughout experiment. The first indication of decomposition by TGA occurs at 152 °C, in which a mass loss of 30.1 wt% is achieved before 284 °C (Fig. 7b). The second mass loss step releases 8.6 wt% before 335 °C giving a total of 38.7 wt% mass loss. As observed with 2NH4Cl + MgH2, the measured mass loss is greater than the theoretical value of 25.5 wt% and may be attributed to the loss of a quarter of the Cl content. Again, the RGA data indicated no evolution of HCl or N2 although H2 is observed throughout the experiment even after mass loss from the sample is complete.

Region (iii) contains CaH2, HT-NH4Cl and NH4CaCl3 phases. Region (iv) contains CaH2, and two unknown phases. Region (v) contains CaH2, CaHCl and CaCl2. For complete phase identification of XRD data see Fig. S9.† ΔT/t = 5 °C min−1. λ = 1.0003896(1) Å. 
During the DSC measurement, three endothermic events are observed with peak heat flows at 195, 280 and 329 °C (Fig. 7c). The peak at 195 °C corresponds to the decomposition of LT-NH4Cl, which is no longer observable by XRD after 203 °C. On this occasion, no phase change is observed from LT-NH4Cl to HT-NH4Cl by in situ SR-XRD. NH4CaCl3 (space group Pnma51) is observed from ∼170 °C. This phase has a maximum intensity at ∼207 °C and disappears by 227 °C. CaH2 is observed from RT to 400 °C although the corresponding Bragg peaks begin to diminish at ∼239 °C. CaH2 is most likely to be the largest contribution to the second endotherm at 280 °C (see Fig. 7c). This temperature is considerably lower than that observed for pure CaH2,52 likely caused by the destabilising effect of the added NH4Cl. The onset of decomposition for CaH2 coincides with the onset of formation of CaHCl (space group P4/nmm)53 and an unknown phase which are thermally stable up to at least 500 °C. CaCl2 is observed to commence formation at 286 °C along with another unknown phase. One exothermic event is observed at 345 °C although the cause is unclear, it is most likely attributed to a phase change. The identity of the unknown phases were considered and attempts to index the peaks were made. Materials that were considered also include CaCl2·(NH3)x (x = 2, 8).
Addition of Pd catalyst to NH4Cl + NaH
In attempt to alter the reaction kinetics between the NH4Cl and NaH and to cause preferential formation of H2 and N2 over NH3, palladium(II) chloride was added (1 mol% and 10 mol%) as a potential ammonia dissociation catalyst to the NH4Cl + NaH powder (Fig. 8, S10 and S11†). From in situ SR-XRD data, the NH4Cl, NaH and 1 mol% PdCl2 material does not show any observable Bragg peaks for PdCl2 as it is below the limit of detection (Fig. 8a and S10†). LT-NH4Cl phase transitions to the HT phase at ∼176 °C, which also decomposes before ∼206 °C. NaH is no longer visible in the XRD pattern by 214 °C. On the contrary, analysis of the BM mixture of NH4Cl, NaH and 10 mol% PdCl2 shows that minimal reaction has occurred between the starting reagents and only 3 wt% NaCl is present. As the sample is heated in situ, the intensity of PdCl2 starts to decrease at ∼130 °C and has disappeared by 155 °C (Fig. 8e and S11†). At the same time, Pd metal is observed and increases in intensity. The observed intensity of NaH begins to decrease from ∼95 °C while it is no longer detected at the temperature of the LT-NH4Cl to HT phase change at 176 °C. Once the HT-NH4Cl has decomposed, ∼227 °C, no further reaction occurs. Overall, the increment of 1 mol% PdCl2 to 10 mol% does not alter the reaction pathway, but the temperatures at which reactions occur.

Region (iii) contains NaH, LT-NH4Cl, Pd and NaCl phases. Region (iv) contains HT-NH4Cl, Pd and NaCl phases (also NaH for 1 mol% PdCl2 containing material). Region (v) contains NaCl. For complete phase identification of XRD data see Fig. S10 and S11.† ΔT/t = 5 °C min−1 for SR-XRD. λ = 1.0003896(1) Å. Endothermic heat flow in the down direction for DSC data. 
A comparison of the thermal analysis data (DSC-TGA and RGA) shows a stark contrast between the catalysed and uncatalysed NH4Cl + NaH samples. The pure sample shows a peak gas desorption at ∼170 °C while 1 mol% and 10 mol% have a maximum H2 release at 166 and 198 °C, respectively. In addition, for the catalysed samples, H2 continues to be detected until the end of the experiment. This is surprising as no crystallographic events at these temperatures during in situ SR-XRD. In addition, the measured mass loss for the 1 mol% and 10 mol% catalysed systems is much greater than the theoretical mass loss. The 1 mol% PdCl2 system loses 28.8 wt% while the theoretical mass loss is 24.3, whereas 31.2 wt% is measured compared to a theoretical quantity of 20.0 wt% for the 10 mol% system. As mentioned previously for the NH4Cl mixed with MgH2 or CaH2, the elevated practical mass loss may be attributed to HCl loss. This gaseous acid reacts with the stainless-steel tubing producing hydrogen. It is noted that elevated mass loss occurs with increased addition of PdCl2, with no difference in mass loss being observed when catalyst is not added to NH4Cl + NaH. This is attributed to the NaH reacting with PdCl2 rather than the intended NH4Cl. The remaining NH4Cl then decomposes as observed for the pure material (Fig. 1) producing HCl, although NH3 is not observed during this process. Overall, this suggests that the addition of PdCl2 does not incur splitting of NH3 during desorption as discussed previously in the literature.35
The DSC data exhibits the largest contrast between samples. The pure and 1 mol% samples have a large exothermic peak between ∼125 and 175 °C (Fig. 2c and 8c), whereas the 10 mol% sample exhibits two exothermic peaks in the same region with an additional sharp endothermic peak at ∼165 °C (Fig. 8g). The mass loss for all three samples is completed between 225 and 250 °C.
Technological feasibility assessment
For energy storage materials to be utilised in technological applications, they must have a high energy density, be inexpensive, and usable within a practical temperature range. The materials employed in this study hold great potential for technological applications as they meet these demands. The US DOE has provided targets that hydrogen storage materials must meet to be used for vehicular applications, one of which is that the gas should be released between 40 and 85 °C.54 The mixture of NH4Cl + NaH has a decomposition onset temperature of ∼90 °C, although peak gas evolution is not achieved until ∼170 °C. Addition of 1 mol% PdCl2 to NH4Cl–NaH has a similar, albeit increased, onset decomposition temperature of ∼65 °C although this incurs an increase in monetary price. The other MH's and MNH2's investigated in this study have increased decomposition onset temperatures, compared to NH4Cl–NaH, of between 72 and 125 °C, which is potentially useful. 2NH4Cl + MgH2 has the highest onset operating temperature of above 125 °C, making it the least likely to find application.
The cost of a fuel is a very important consideration when examining its viability compared to current fuel options. The US DOE has set an energy target cost of US$10 per kW per h. The energy target cost of these materials compare favourably to the US DOE target. NH4Cl–NaH for instance, would cost US$1.25 per kg of raw material.38,55 A 50:50 NH3:H2 combustion ratio would produce 14.7 MJ kg−1 (4.1 kW h kg−1) of gas, giving an overall cost of US$0.6 per kW per h (Table 1).38 The cost of the other mixtures would be of similar size although sourcing industrial prices for these materials is troublesome. These prices would diminish further for large scale production of the materials. The 2NH4Cl–MH2 (M = Mg, Ca) materials show excellent gravimetric capacity (40.4 and 41.4 wt%, respectively) and practical volumetric gas densities (607 and 657 kg m−3, respectively). The cost of these MH's is also low with 2NH4Cl–CaH2 and 2NH4Cl–MgH2 costing US$0.5 per kW per h and US$0.3 per kW per h, respectively. LiH, LiNH2 and NaNH2 may have agreeable energy densities and decomposition temperatures but the price of the raw materials excludes them from contention. In addition, the long term utilisation of a lithium based material as a fuel source is not sustainable.56
A weakness of these materials is that they decompose over multiple steps. This may have a detrimental effect on the energy storage capacity because if the fuel is operated at lower temperatures, the onset of decomposition for the next step will not be reached resulting in a major reduction in efficiency.
The decomposition pathway and thermodynamics of these materials have been determined using HSC Chemistry software (Table S1†). Unfortunately, the database for this software did not contain many of the by-products experimentally observed including e.g. the Mg and Ca amides/imides, (NH4)2MgCl4 and NH4CaCl3. The thermodynamic properties of many of these compounds are generally unknown and as a result accurate thermodynamic predictions could not be obtained. Theoretically the reactions are all exothermic with NH4Cl + NaH having the largest predicted reaction enthalpy of −86.1 kJ mol−1 NH4Cl. The thermodynamics of (NH4)2MgCl4, NH4MgCl3 and NH4CaCl3 were estimated based on the enthalpy of formation of K2MgCl4, KMgCl3 and KCaCl3 from the corresponding metal chloride salts.57 However, the reactions between NH4Cl and MgH2 or CaH2 to form the ternary ammonium metal chlorides, H2 and NH3 were still mildly exothermic. Experimentally many of the systems exhibit endothermic reactions although a precise determination of the thermodynamics could not be achieved due to the multiple overlapping reaction steps and impurities within the samples. Comparing the Ca and Mg systems, it is clear that the experimental pathway is predominantly endothermic rather than exothermic. This is due to the mismatch between the theoretical and experimental reaction pathway.
Since the NH4Cl–MH and NH4Cl–MNH2 materials form NH3/H2 gas mixtures during decomposition, the fuel produced could be burnt in an internal combustion engine to avoid poisoning of fuel cell membranes. Generally NH3 has a narrow flammability limit of 15.5% to 27% volume in air,20 which leads to a low combustion rate. However, recent studies have shown that the presence of hydrogen during ammonia combustion can lower combustion temperatures and increase the burning velocity of ammonia flames.58 These mixtures are theoretically producing a 50 mol% ratio of H2 and NH3 apart from LiNH2 and NaNH2 which are producing nearly 100% NH3. Therefore, these mixtures will allow efficient conversion of the gas fuel to energy to propel a vehicle without the formation of large quantities of NOx or other products usually associated with combustion engines using petrol or diesel.
Upon refuelling the vehicle, the waste product removed would be the solid metal salt, e.g. NaCl, which is non-hazardous. Off-board regeneration of the waste product can also be considered to recycle this material using methods that are already used in large scale commercial processes. An example of a viable fuel cycle utilising commercial processes is exhibited in Fig. 9 with the reactions incorporated into the scheme outlined below. Ideally the hydrogen would be produced using renewable energy sources.

The left over CO(g) and H2(g) could then be used to produce CO2(g) and more H2(g)via the water shift reaction.60

Conclusions
This study has explored the reactions of four ammonium chloride–metal hydride (NH4Cl–MH) and two ammonium chloride–metal amide (NH4Cl–MNH2) powders for potential use as solid-state ammonia and hydrogen fuel sources for vehicular applications. Comparison of the results to US DOE guidelines for vehicles running on gas reveals that these materials exceed targets with respect to the cost of materials, fuel capacity and operating temperature. DSC-TGA and RGA analysis indicates that the onset of H2 and/or NH3 release occurs at ∼90 °C for NH4Cl–NaH with an average of 97 °C for all materials in the study. TGA analysis revealed a high gravimetric gas evolution ranging between 24.8 wt% for NH4Cl–NaH and 41.4 wt% for 2NH4Cl–CaH2 providing exceptional volumetric gas densities of 363 and 657 kg m−3, respectively. This far exceeds densities of pure NH3, H2 or metal hydride materials such as Mg2FeH6.

In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction of each of the materials shows that the metal hydrides decompose at significantly lower temperatures compared to their pure counterparts with the reaction with NH4Cl enhancing the decomposition process. The final products after a full reaction are the metal hydride salts with no other by-products. This will allow for the products to be recycled in an off-board process.
Each of the NH4Cl–MH or NH4Cl–MNH2 materials released NH3 and H2 upon reaction apart from NaNH2 and LiNH2. To determine if the NH4Cl–NaH mixture could be catalytically prevented from forming NH3, PdCl2 was added. Unfortunately, this resulted in a slight increase in the onset temperature of desorption with NH3 still being released. Further investigation into alternative catalysts such as Ru based compounds may alter the decomposition pathway. NH4Cl alone could not be used in a system as the decomposition process involves the formation of HCl. No acid was identified in the decomposition process of the NH4Cl–MH or NH4Cl–MNH2 systems.
The high gravimetric capacity of the materials along with the low cost of NH4Cl allows for the overall cost to meet US DOE targets of US$10 per kW per h. NH4Cl–NaH has a material cost of US$0.6 per kW per h while 2NH4Cl–CaH2 and 2NH4Cl–MgH2 cost US$0.5 per kW per h and US$0.3 per kW per h, respectively. A recycling process has been identified for the NH4Cl–NaH material using industrial processes already developed. This will decrease the overall cost of the system, which is already estimated to meet targets set by the US DOE. If the industrial process is to be scaled up further, the cost of these metal hydrides should decrease causing this fuel to be even more competitive in the future. Overall, the reaction cycle potentially allows carbon-neutral regeneration of the starting materials, making it a sustainable energy option.
