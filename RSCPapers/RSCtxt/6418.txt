    , Accepted 4th May 2013First published on 7th May 2013AbstractA composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) heterojunction photocatalyst has been prepared by a simple in situ polymerized complex method. Upon Pt cocatalyst loading, this catalyst shows higher photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen production than individual SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) in the presence of methanol sacrificial reagent. Microscopic morphology studies show that well defined heterojunctions are formed by matching the lattice fringes of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), and Pt was preferentially loaded on the surface of the Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) component in the composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) photocatalyst. XPS and EPR analyses show that the composite photocatalyst also has the lowest amount of Cr6+ electron trapping sites. Band structure analysis by combining absorption spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky plots shows that, in the composite photocatalyst, the photogenerated electrons and holes tend to migrate from SrTiO3(La,Cr) to Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and from Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) to SrTiO3(La,Cr), respectively. This kind of band structure can facilitate charge transfer and separation driven by the minor potential difference between the two components, which is further confirmed by the observation of long lived electrons in the time resolved FT-IR spectroscopic study. It is concluded that the superior photocatalytic activity of the composite heterojunction photocatalyst is due to efficient charge transfer and separation by well defined heterojunctions formed between SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), preferential loading of Pt nanoparticles on the Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) component, and the lowest amount of Cr6+ in the composite photocatalyst. The tailored design and synthesis of the composite heterojunction structure is a promising approach for the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst.
1 Introduction
One of the most fascinating ways to produce hydrogen is photocatalytic splitting of water utilizing solar energy. So far, many materials are known to exhibit photocatalytic activity for H2 or O2 production half reactions in the presence of sacrificial reagent,1 and some of the semiconductor based photocatalysts even show overall water splitting activity2–4 although the energy conversion efficiencies are still low. In order to efficiently split water, a photocatalyst should be visible light responsive, and assembled in such a way that it can efficiently promote charge separation and migration by inhibiting undesired charge recombination.5–7 Among the vast majority of the active photocatalysts for water splitting, layer structured perovskite titanates are considered as one of the ideal building blocks for the assembly of a water splitting photocatalyst.8 Perovskite titanates are n-type semiconductors constituted of earth abundant elements, and usually are stable in aqueous solutions. However, the large bandgaps of the titanates (>3.0 eV) correspond to the ultraviolet (UV) light region, which shares only around 3–5% of the solar radiation spectrum. Doping of foreign elements into UV-active metal oxides is an effective method being employed for the extension of the light absorption of a semiconductor into the visible region.9–11 It was found that Cr doping is an effective way to shift the light absorption of the titanates into the visible region for hydrogen production from aqueous methanol solutions.12,13 However, doping also creates defect sites acting as charge recombination centers. To solve this problem, codoping methodologies are applied. It was reported recently that codoping of SrTiO3 with Cr3+/Sb5+,14 Cr3+/Ta5+,15 Cr3+/La3+16 can reduce the amount of charge recombination centers by keeping the charge balance and suppressing the formation of undesired Cr6+ electron trapping sites.
Assembly of a multi-component composite photocatalyst might be an ideal approach to achieve efficient charge separation for enhancing photocatalytic activity of water splitting, since no great achievement has been made so far on single component photocatalysts, such as TiO2. Lee's group17,18 reported that formation of a p-n junction between n-type and p-type semiconductors can efficiently separate photogenerated charges and enhance the photocatalytic activity. Ye et al.19 reported that a Cr-doped Ba2In2O5/In2O3 composite photocatalyst system can drive both water oxidation and reduction half reactions under visible light irradiation. In this kind of composite photocatalyst approach, proper design and fabrication of the interface between the different components should be essential and necessary. We found that formation of surface phase junction of anatase/rutile,20 heterojunction of MoS2/CdS,21,22 and solid solution junction of ZnO/Zn2−xGeO4−x−3yN2y23 have positive effects on the improvement of the photocatalytic activities either in hydrogen production or water oxidation half reactions. In order to facilitate charge transfer and separation in the composite photocatalyst, at least two crucial factors must be carefully considered, i.e., redox (band structure) matching and lattice structure matching of the junctioned/interfaced components.
In this work, we have prepared a composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) heterojunction photocatalyst by a simple in situ polymerized complex method. In photocatalytic H2 production reaction under visible light irradiation in the presence of methanol sacrificial reagent, this composite heterojunction based photocatalyst shows much higher photocatalytic activity than the individual SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr). It was found that formation of well defined heterojunctions between SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), preferential loading of Pt as cocatalyst on the surface of the Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) component, and the lowest amount of Cr6+ formation in the composite heterojunction Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) photocatalyst are accountable for the efficient charge transfer and separation, hence enhancing the photocatalytic activity.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of materials
SrTiO3(La,Cr), Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) were prepared by the polymerized complex method.24,25 In a typical procedure for the synthesis of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), 4.0507 g titanium tetra-isopropoxide (J&K Chemical; 98+%) was dissolved in 33.5 mL ethylene glycol (Sinopharm Chemical; ≥99.0%), followed by addition of 31.521 g citric acid (Kermel Chemical; ≥99.5%). The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at 50 °C until it became transparent. 3.0157 g and 6.1505 g Sr(NO3)2 (Guangfu Chemical; 99.5%) were added to the reaction mixture for the synthesis of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), respectively. After the addition of Sr(NO3)2, 0.3248 g La(NO3)3·6H2O (Kermel Chemical; ≥98.5%) and 0.3001 g Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (J&K Chemical; 99%) were also added and further stirred at 50 °C for 4 h to yield a completely dissolved reaction mixture. The solution was polyesterified at 130 °C for 20 h, followed by pyrolysis at 350 °C for 2 h. The resulting black solid product was then ground into a powder and calcined on an Al2O3 plate at 900 °C for 2 h in air in a temperature programmed Muffle furnace. The calcined samples were kept in vials and stored in a desiccator. For the preparation of Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr), 2.7005 g titanium tetra-isopropoxide was dissolved in 22.3 mL ethylene glycol, followed by addition of 21.014 g citric acid. 3.0686 g Sr(NO3)2, 0.2001 g Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and different amounts of La(NO3)3·6H2O (the molar ratios of [La]/[Cr] were 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25) were added to the reaction mixture. Other procedures were the same as the those of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr).
Pt cocatalyst was loaded on the synthesized photocatalysts with H2PtCl6 as Pt precursor, applying the standard impregnation method.26 In the Pt4+ → Pt reduction process, formation of Cr6+ at high temperature should be avoided since it acts as an electron trapping site. For optimization of the Pt reduction temperature in our experiments, reduction of Pt4+ to Pt was carried out in H2 flow at elevated temperatures.
2.2 Characterizations of materials
The crystallinity of the synthesized samples was studied by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) technique on a Rigaku D/Max-2500/PC powder diffractometer. The measurement was performed using CuKα as the radiation source with operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 200 mA. The scanning rate was kept at 5° min−1 with a step size of 0.02° in the 2θ range of 10–80°. UV-Vis Diffuse Reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550) equipped with an integrating BaSO4 sphere. The morphology of the samples was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images taken with a Quanta 200FEG scanning electron microscope. TEM and HRTEM images were obtained on Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin (FEI company) microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The amounts of the Pt loading are 0.155, 0.163 and 0.164 wt% for SrTiO3(La,Cr), Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite samples, respectively, determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) on an ICPS-8100. The BET surface areas of the samples were calculated based on the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorption analyzer. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Escalab 250 equipped with a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at 77 K on a Bruker ESR A200 spectrometer. The settings for the EPR measurement parameters were as follows: center field, 3360.000 G; sweep width, 6000.000 G; microwave frequency, ∼9.389 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; power, 0.792 mW. The time-resolved (ms) Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was recorded on a Nicolet 870 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT (Mercury cadmium telluride, HgCdTe) detector and 355 nm laser pulse of 6–8 ns duration. The decay curves were recorded at room temperature by accumulating 50 traces repeated at 1 Hz.
2.3 Photocatalytic reactions
The photocatalytic H2 production reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. Photocatalyst (0.5 g) was suspended in 200 mL aqueous solution containing 40 mL methanol and thoroughly degassed by evacuation. The photocatalytic reaction was performed by photoirradiation of the reaction mixture using a 300 W Xe lamp (Ushio-CERMAX LX300) equipped with an optical cutoff filter (Kenko, L-42; λ > 420 nm) and a water filter to prevent passing of the ultraviolet and infrared light, respectively. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at 288 ± 1 K by a continuous flow of cooling water. The amounts of the evolved H2 were determined by on line gas chromatography (Shimadazu; GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar Carrier). The amounts of produced H2 at 5 h reaction time were used for evaluating the photocatalytic activities of the samples.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The flat-band potentials of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) were determined by extrapolation of the Mott–Schottky plots measured on a standard three-electrode cell electrochemical workstation (CHI660A, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China). In this system, a Pt plate was used as counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was employed as reference electrode, and the thin films of the photocatalyst samples fabricated by electrophoretic deposition method were used as the working electrode. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution.
Photocurrent measurements were carried out by suspension of the photocatalyst (25 mg) in distilled H2O (75 mL) containing acetate (0.1 M) and Fe3+ (0.1 mM) as electron donor and acceptor, respectively.18,27 The pH value of the suspension was adjusted to 1.8 with HClO4. A Pt plate (2 × 2 cm2, both sides were exposed to the solution), a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and a Pt gauze were used as working (collector), reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. About +0.6 V vs. SCE bias potential was applied on the Pt electrode. All the experiments were conducted under the same experimental conditions with continuous purging of Ar gas into the suspension.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Photocatalytic reactions
SrTiO3(La,Cr), Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite samples with the same amounts of codoped La and Cr and Pt loadings were synthesized under the same experimental conditions. The photocatalytic activities of these samples toward H2 production at 5 h reaction time in the presence of CH3OH as electron donating sacrificial reagent are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the photocatalytic activities of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) are relatively low, but the composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) photocatalyst shows a photocatalytic activity up to 6.4 and 3.0 times of the individual SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), respectively. An induction period at the initial stage of the photocatalytic reactions was also observed in the time course study (inset of Fig. 1).15 The photocatalyst was further optimized for the Pt reduction temperature and the amount of Pt cocatalyst loading. It was found that the optimized Pt reduction temperature is between 573 K and 623 K (Fig. S1a†). In the following reactions, the temperature of 623 K was used as the fixed Pt reduction temperature. Examination of the amount of Pt loading at the reduction temperature of 623 K shows that the optimized Pt loading is 0.25 wt% (Fig. S1b†). In summary, the composition of the optimized composite photocatalyst under our experimental conditions is as follows: Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) with [La]:[Cr]:([Ti] + [Cr]) = 5:4:80, 0.25 wt% Pt loading, and reduction of Pt in hydrogen flow at 623 K. Corresponding individual SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) samples used for comparison in the following sections were also prepared under the same optimized experimental conditions.

3.2 Crystalline structures and morphologies
XRD patterns of the prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2. The SrTiO3 (Fig. 2a) sample shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of (110), (111), (200) and (211) at 2θ of 32.57°, 40.14°, 46.64° and 57.94°, respectively, indicating that the synthesized SrTiO3 is of cubic structure (JCPDS-84-0443). After La and Cr doping, these peaks are well preserved and no additional impurity peaks are observed (Fig. 2b), showing that doping of La and Cr did not alter the cubic structure of SrTiO3. A similar doping effect was also observed when La and Cr were doped into the tetragonal structured Sr2TiO4 (JCPDS-39-1471). Comparison of the XRD patterns of Sr2TiO4 (Fig. 2c) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) (Fig. 2d) shows that all of the domain diffraction peaks of the Sr2TiO4 were well maintained in the La and Cr codoped Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) sample. Fig. 2e shows the XRD pattern of the La and Cr codoped Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3 composite photocatalyst. Both SrTiO3 and Sr2TiO4 diffraction peaks indicate that the cubic structured SrTiO3 and tetragonal structured Sr2TiO4 crystallite phases are all well maintained in the composite photocatalyst. It was reported that, in La and Cr codoped titanate,16,28 La3+ usually replaces the Sr sites and Cr3+ replaces the Ti sites. Thus the crystalline structure of the original titanate can be well preserved, and the formation of Cr6+ can be largely suppressed due to charge balancing between the doped cations. The ratio of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) to SrTiO3(La,Cr) in the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst was determined to be approximately 3:2 by Le Bail whole-pattern analysis from XRD data (Fig. S2†).

SEM images (Fig. 3) in 50 nm scale show that these three samples are quite different in surface morphology. The SrTiO3(La,Cr) sample has a smooth surface with the size varying from tens to hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 3a), while the Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) sample has a relatively rough surface made up of irregularly shaped aggregates with size ca. 5–10 nm (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) sample is composed of two big nanoparticles with distinctly different surface morphologies, one is smooth and the other one is rough (Fig. 3c). Based on the morphological features, these two nanoparticles can be assigned to SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), respectively. Observation of the close contact of individual SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) in the composite photocatalyst is consistent with the XRD results. In other words, the composite photocatalyst possesses a kind of superlattice macrostructure integrated with SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) nanoparticles throughout the sample. Because Pt was loaded in less than 0.2 wt% per ICP-MS analysis results and the formed Pt nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the samples, we encountered some difficulties in finding the Pt sites in SEM images. However, sparsely dispersed Pt nanoparticles with size smaller than 5 nm can be visualized as white spots with relatively sharp contrast shown in the arrow directed areas in each of the images of the samples (Fig. 3a–c). It was also noted that Pt was preferentially loaded on the rough surface of the Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) component instead of the relatively smooth surface of the SrTiO3(La,Cr) component of the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst. We deliberately prepared Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) with 1.0 wt% Pt loading. As shown in Fig. S3,† the overall tendency of the Pt deposition is similar to the sample with 0.2 wt% Pt loading. But due to higher Pt loadings, small amounts of Pt are also occasionally deposited on the smooth surface of the SrTiO3(La,Cr). This further confirms that Pt nanoparticles are preferentially loaded on the rough surface of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr). Preferential loading of Pt on Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) might be due to a better interfacial interaction (sticking) of Pt to the rough surface substrate of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr).

Fig. 4 shows the TEM (Fig. 4a) and HRTEM images (Fig. 4b) of the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst. The dark contrast in the TEM image is due to thickness difference in that particular area. The HRTEM image clearly shows the existence of individual Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr) crystalline particles in the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst, as identified by the corresponding (103) and (111) lattice fringe parameters of 2.84 Å and 2.24 Å, respectively. These lattice fringe parameters match well with the corresponding lattice parameters calculated by XRD. The HRTEM image also shows that a well defined heterojunction between Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr) nanoparticles is formed by merging the lattice fringes of the respective (103) and (111). Formation of such a kind of well matched heterojunction is expected to facilitate charge transfer and separation between the nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.21–23

3.3 Band structures and charge carrier properties

Fig. 5a shows the DRS spectra of the samples. The undoped SrTiO3 and Sr2TiO4 are only UV responsive with absorption edges at ca. 380 nm. However, upon La and Cr codoping, the absorption edges of these samples are extended to the visible region. At the same doping level, the absorption edges of the SrTiO3(La,Cr), Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) samples lie at ca. 650 nm, 570 nm and 580 nm, respectively. The similar absorption edge of the composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) sample (580 nm) to that of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) (570 nm) is an indication that Cr is more preferentially doped into the more open structured Sr2TiO4 lattice rather than SrTiO3 (650 nm).29 The visible light absorption upon La and Cr codoping is mainly due to bandgap narrowing by Cr3+ dopant whose occupied 3d orbital overlaps with the O 2p valance band of the strontium titanate.12

The bandgap energies of the La and Cr codoped samples were determined by extrapolation of the plots of the (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν) (Fig. 5b) and calculated by the following formula:30αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2, where α, ν, Eg, and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, bandgap, and a constant value, respectively. The index n depends on the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor, i.e., direct transition (n = 1) or indirect transition (n = 4). The best fit of (αhν)2versus Eg was obtained only when n is 1, suggesting that direct transitions across the energy bandgaps of these materials are allowed. So the bandgap energies of the synthesized materials (Table 1) were estimated by the interception of the tangent to the x-axis. The bandgaps of Sr2TiO4 and SrTiO3 are evaluated to be 3.34 eV and 3.32 eV, respectively. While the bandgaps of La and Cr codoped Sr2TiO4 and SrTiO3 are 2.54 eV and 2.26 eV, respectively. As for the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite material, the observed bandgap is 2.52 eV, the value of which is more close to that of the Sr2TiO4(La,Cr).

Both Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr) are n-type semiconductors as shown in Fig. 6a. Upon photoexcitation of an n-type semiconductor, the photoexcited electrons and holes tend to migrate to the interior bulk and surface, respectively. However, the photoexcited electrons can migrate further to the metal cocatalyst (such as Pt) if a metal with appropriate Fermi level is loaded on the surface.31 To address the charge transfer properties of the composite photocatalyst, we estimated the relative band structures of individual Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr). Fig. 6a shows the Mott–Schottky curves measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. The flat-band potentials of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr) were obtained by the extrapolation of the Mott–Schottky plots (C−2vs. E, electrode potential) using the following equation: Csc−2 = 2(E − Efb − κT/e)/eεε0ND.32 It can be seen that the Efb of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) is about −1.36 V, which is more positive than that of SrTiO3(La,Cr) by ca. 0.1 V. This value is in good agreement with the data reported in the literature.33 By further considering that the bandgaps of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr) are 2.54 eV and 2.26 eV, the valence band of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) can be estimated to be roughly ca. 0.38 eV more positive than that of SrTiO3(La,Cr). Based on these calculation results, the band structure of the composite photocatalyst can be depicted as shown in Scheme 1. Thermodynamically, under visible light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons and holes are more readily transferred from SrTiO3(La,Cr) to Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and from Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) to SrTiO3(La,Cr), respectively.

 Scheme 1  Schematic band structure of La and Cr codoped Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3 and its mechanism for H2 production under visible light irradiation. 
Charge transfer properties of the composite photocatalyst under visible light irradiation were further evaluated by measuring the photocurrent time courses of the samples suspended in an aqueous solution containing acetate and Fe3+ as electron donor and acceptor, respectively (Fig. 6b). It was found that Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst generates a much higher photocurrent under visible light irradiation than the individual Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) or SrTiO3(La,Cr). A high photocurrent implies that the composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) heterojunction photocatalyst generates more charges on the surface to be delivered to the electrode via the electrolyte. In other words, upon photoexcitation, the composite photocatalyst can have more photogenerated charges available on the surface to participate in the surface reactions, hence enhancing the photocatalytic activity.
In Cr-doped titanate semiconductor photocatalysts, formation of Cr6+ should be avoided since the Cr6+ 3d orbital level is usually located below the Ti 3d conduction band level and acts as an electron trapping site.12,14,15,34 XPS and EPR spectroscopy were applied to examine the Cr valance state on the surface and in the bulk of the synthesized photocatalysts. XPS (Fig. 7a) reveals that the relative content of Cr6+ (580.2 eV) on the surface of the synthesized samples decreases in the order SrTiO3(La,Cr) > Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) > Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr), while the relative content of Cr3+ (576.5 eV) increases in the order SrTiO3(La,Cr) < Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) < Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr). This demonstrates that much fewer surface Cr6+ recombination sites are created on the surface of the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst. Fig. 7b shows the EPR spectra of samples measured at 77 K. All of the samples show broad Cr3+ EPR signals with linewidth ca.35 G and g value ca. 1.979.35 The EPR intensity of Cr3+ in these samples is in the order SrTiO3(La,Cr) ≈ Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) < Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr). This further demonstrates that the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst has a lower amount of Cr6+ formed not only on the surface, but also in the bulk. Note that these three samples were doped with the same amount of Cr under the same experimental conditions. Formation of a lower amount of Cr6+ throughout the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst is beneficial for charge transfer and separation.

3.4 Time-resolved FT-IR spectroscopy
The time-resolved (ms) FT-IR (Fig. 8) was conducted to characterize the photogenerated electrons in the synthesized photocatalysts.36 In micro-scale time-resolved FT-IR, the IR absorption intensity directly reflects the amount of long-lived electrons on the shallow traps, defects or those due to efficient charge separation.37 It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the overall trends of the time decay profiles for the individual samples and the composite samples are quite similar except the IR intensity differences, indicating that these samples have different amounts of long-lived electrons (life-times in ms scale) which decay in similar ways. Because the photocatalytic activity of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) is higher than that of SrTiO3(La,Cr), the higher IR intensity of SrTiO3(La,Cr) (Fig. 8a) than that of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) (Fig. 8b) is an indication that the observed long-lived electrons in these two individual samples are mainly due to the electrons trapped by shallow traps/defect sites, such as Cr6+. The possible assignment of the long-lived electrons due to electron traps on the Cr6+ defect sites is coincidentally in good agreement with the XPS and EPR results that Cr6+ content is higher in SrTiO3(La,Cr) than in Sr2TiO4(La,Cr). It is also noted that the time resolved IR decay profile of Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst (Fig. 8c) lies between those of SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr). As shown in the previous sections, the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst has a kind of superlattice macrostructure integrated with Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr) nanoparticles (TEM) in an approximately 3:2 composition ratio (XRD). If there are no other effects on the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) composite photocatalyst, it should show a time decay profile with 3/5 and 2/5 intrinsic characteristics of the individual Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr), respectively. The time resolved IR decay profile of the simulated data based on this assumption has been plotted, as shown in Fig. 8d. It can be seen that the experimentally observed decay profile (Fig. 8c) shows higher IR intensity than that of the simulated decay profile (Fig. 8d), indicating that the composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) photocatalyst has much more long-lived electrons than expected. There might be some additional contributions to such long-lived electrons in the composite photocatalyst besides the shallow traps/defects. It is feasible to assign the additional long-lived electrons in the composite photocatalyst to the long-lived electrons generated by efficient charge transfer and separation across the heterojunctions.38

3.5 Mechanism of the photocatalytic reactions on the composite photocatalyst

Table 1 summarizes the bandgap energies and specific BET surface areas of the synthesized photocatalysts. It can be seen that the specific surface area of SrTiO3(La,Cr) is 8.9 m2 g−1, which is slightly larger than those of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) (6.1 and 6.2 m2 g−1, respectively). Since there is no big difference in surface area of these samples, the effect of the surface area on the high photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalyst can be ruled out.
Based on the experimental results, the proposed model for enhanced H2 production of Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) heterojunction is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1 (all of the potentials are normalized to NHE). When the photocatalyst was excited by visible light with photon energy higher or equal to the bandgaps of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and SrTiO3(La,Cr), the electrons in the valance band could be excited to the conduction band, leaving the same amount of holes in the valance band. Since the conduction band edge potential of SrTiO3(La,Cr) is more negative than that of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), and the valance band edge potential of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) is more positive than that of SrTiO3(La,Cr), the photogenerated electrons and holes can readily transfer from SrTiO3(La,Cr) to Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and from Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) to SrTiO3(La,Cr), respectively. As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be more efficiently separated between the two components of the nanoparticles via the heterojunctions. Because the Pt nanoparticles were mainly deposited on the surface of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr), the separated electrons on Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) may further transfer to the Pt nanoparticles and participate in the surface reduction reaction for hydrogen evolution. The heterojunction structure, preferential deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) component, and the lower amount of Cr6+ electron trapping sites are the main reasons for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity for the composite heterojunction photocatalyst.
4 Conclusion
In summary, we have prepared a composite Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) heterojunction photocatalyst which shows higher photocatalytic activity compared to the individual SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. The composite photocatalyst constitutes of a kind of superlattice macrostructure integrated with SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) nanoparticles throughout the sample, and well defined heterojunctions are formed by matching the lattice fringes between SrTiO3(La,Cr) and Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) components. Band structure analyses show that the photogenerated electrons and holes tend to migrate from SrTiO3(La,Cr) to Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) and from Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) to SrTiO3(La,Cr), respectively. The charge transfer and separation can be driven by the existing minor potential differences between the two components. Furthermore, codoping of La with Cr in Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr) results in the presence of the doped Cr mainly in the form of Cr3+ rather than high valent Cr6+ species acting as electron trapping sites. Overall, the composite photocatalyst possesses a higher photocurrent in the photoelectrochemical measurements and more long-lived electrons due to efficient charge separation in the time resolved FT-IR spectroscopic study. Finally, the preferential loading of the Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the electron accepting component of Sr2TiO4(La,Cr) in the composite photocatalyst further facilitates the photocatalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction. These results suggest that it is an effective method to improve the photocatalytic activity by the tailored design and synthesis of a composite photocatalyst possessing lattice and energy matching heterojunctions.
