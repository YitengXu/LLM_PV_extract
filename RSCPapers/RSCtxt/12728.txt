    , Accepted 26th September 2022First published on 27th September 2022AbstractOwing to their large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long diffusion length, low defect density and tunable direct band gap, low-dimensional perovskite structures have been widely regarded as promising candidates for developing next-generation photo-electrical devices. Herein, we proposed and presented a high-performance photoconductive detector, which is composed of a single CsPbBr3 microwire covered by a Ag nanolayer (Ag@CsPbBr3). The Ag@CsPbBr3 microwire detector reveals a higher responsivity of 18.96 A W−1, a linear detection range (LDR) of 84.72 dB, a detectivity of 1.67 × 1014 Jones, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.60 × 103% upon the operation of 405 nm light illumination at an operating bias of 3 V. The on–off switching ratio of the Ag@CsPbBr3 detector reached up to 105, a higher photoresponse speed with a rising/falling time of 17/57 ms, and excellent stability to ultraviolet-visible light signals. The performance of the device has been greatly enhanced. The performance-increased photodetecting mechanism was exploited. That is, cladding a Ag nanolayer can not only achieve surface cleaning modulation to inhibit perovskite degradation but also facilitate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in the CsPbBr3 MW, thus enabling fast charge transfer. In particular, the influence of the Ag nanofilm on the long-term stability of the fabricated CsPbBr3 microwire detector is considerably positive. The experimental research provides an innovative scheme for manufacturing photosensitive, stable, and flexible perovskite photodetection devices and will promote their commercial applications in the future.
1 Introduction
Perovskite-based optoelectronics have been studied extensively for their novel properties and potential applications in devices, such as solar cells, photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes (LED), transistors etc.1–9 So far, perovskite photodetectors with excellent performance have become promising candidates for exploiting neuromorphic computing, image sensing, environmental monitoring and optical communication, which can merge data transmission and light detection.10–15 Low-dimensional perovskite materials possess unique optical properties and charge transport properties, which makes them promising candidates for optoelectronic and electronic devices. Due to the flexibility of their formulation and the solution-based processing, low-dimensional halide perovskites of different shapes and sizes can be synthesized easily. Various perovskite functional materials have been explored for constructing photodetectors, such as zero-dimensional (0D) spherical quantum dots, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials and three-dimensional (3D) structures.16–20 Samples of 0D perovskite quantum dots have strong exciton binding energy that can increase the radiative recombination in optoelectronic devices. However, their application is limited by the easy ionization and decomposition of perovskite quantum dots.21 Although the 2D perovskite structure can be used to fabricate high performance devices, their extensive commercial applications are still limited by bulky organic cations in the structure compared with pure 3D perovskite-based devices.22–24 Also, multi-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskite-based photodetectors have high efficiency and promising device durability. But the complex function of the 2D/3D device interface remains vague.25 Meanwhile, despite the outstanding performance of 3D perovskites, 3D perovskite-based photodetectors still suffer from negative charge recombination and low carrier mobility.26,27 As for the potential advantages of 1D perovskites or quasi-1D perovskites, they have been regarded as attractive materials for a diverse range of optic and optoelectronic applications, such as linear polarized light detectors, lasers, and LED, owing to their great flexibility, good carrier transport performance, polarized absorption, and emission properties in comparison with other types of perovskite materials and structures.28–31
Although research on 1D perovskites has made a great contribution in semiconductor fields, the defects of perovskites could not be ignored in any type of photoelectric device. The main defects of perovskite materials are as follows: antisite substitution or interstitial defects, grain boundary defects and surface defects. Xu et al. employed PCBM to passivate the key PbI3− ions which caused Pb–I antisite defects. This is a mixed material in solar cells that feature low hysteresis and enhanced photovoltage.32 Cu(Tu)I was incorporated in perovskites by Ye's group to fill the metal cations and halide anions vacancies, showing a breakthrough perovskite solar cell efficiency of 19.9%.33 Deng et al. introduced polymethyl methacrylate on the surface of a perovskite network, resulting in a device with greatly enhanced stability.34 However, the applications of perovskites in practical devices are still limited by some disadvantages, such as high-temperature processing, the production cost, long-term stability, which sophisticate the optimization of additives.35,36 Through tremendous efforts on material design and device construction, performance enhanced photodetectors have been achieved with perovskites. However, the surface defects of perovskites have severely limited their further applications. Therefore, construction of high-performance perovskite photodetectors with low consumption and high operability needs to be further explored.
In the present study, we proposed and presented a new generation of flexible, ultrahigh stability and sensitive photoconductive detector, which is composed of a single CsPbBr3 microwire uncovered and covered by a Ag nanofilm. The sample of individual CsPbBr3 was synthesized using a facile low-cost quasi-static solution-based approach. The CsPbBr3 wire detector exhibited good visible photodetection performances, such as a maximum photoresponsivity of 5.83 A W−1, a detectivity of 2.52 × 1013 Jones, a linear detection range (LDR) of 46.74 dB, an on–off ratio of 103, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.67 × 103% upon 405 nm light illumination at a voltage of 3 V. By capping with Ag nanofilms, the device performances have been observably increased, and the corresponding enhanced performances comprise a higher responsivity of 18.96 A W−1, a detectivity of 1.67 × 1014 Jones, a LDR of 84.72 dB, an on–off ratio of 105, and an EQE of 5.60 × 103% under identical testing conditions. The stability of the fabricated CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector, especially for the device that was covered by a Ag nanolayer, was also investigated. The results illustrated a much more superior long-term stability without any encapsulation treatment. Finally, the working principle of the enhanced photodetection was studied, that is, the enhanced photosensivity and device stability could be derived from the decreased defects, improved crystallinity, enhanced light absorption, and improved charge transfer in the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 wire due to the incorporation of Ag nanolayer cladding. The present research provides a novel approach to efficiently increase the photodetection performances and long-term stability of low-dimensional perovskite structure detectors and can significantly contribute to their future commercial applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Sample preparation
Individual CsPbBr3 wires were synthesized by a solution-phase quasi-static solution method. The preparation process is as follows. (i) Prepared solutions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 1 mL), CsBr (0.5 mM) and PbBr2 (0.5 mM) were mixed and stirred for 2 hours at 60 °C. (ii) Isopropanol (IPA, 0.2 mL) was added dropwise into DMSO solution under vigorous stirring for 4 hours. (iii) 0.2 mL of the solution (filtered through a 0.22 mm filter) was dropped onto a 20 × 20 mm glass substrate using a pipette. (iv) The reaction substrate was covered with another identical glass substrate (cover-substrate) for the growth of the microstructure. (v) When the cover-substrate was removed, CsPbBr3 MWs with a well-defined geometry were obtained individually on the substrate.
2.2 Device fabrication
A kind of photoconductive detector, which is composed of a single CsPbBr3 MW with Ag colloids as symmetric electrodes, was constructed. The device preparation is as follows. First, a single CsPbBr3 MW was mechanically transferred from the glass substrate and then placed in a clean polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Second, both ends of the wire were fixed on the PET substrate using Ag colloids. Thus, a MSM structured optoelectronic device based on a single CsPbBr3 MW was constructed. Third, an Ag nanolayer was deposited on the side surfaces of the CsPbBr3 MW using the radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method. The sputtering chamber was devoted to a pressure of 1.0 Pa, and high purity Ar working as a protective gas was used. By varying the sputtering time, a deposited Ag nanolayer with controlled thickness can be prepared. Finally, thermal annealing treatment conducted at a temperature of 60 °C was carried out in a tube furnace. Therefore, a perovskite-based photodetector with the CsPbBr3 MW and covered by a Ag nanolayer was constructed.
2.3 Characterization and analysis
The surface morphology of the CsPbBr3 MW was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to analyze the crystal structure of the CsPbBr3 MW. The samples were excited by a 530 nm laser as an excitation source to determine the photoluminescence (PL) properties, and a LABRAM-UV Jobin Yvon spectrometer was used to record the emitted photons. The absorption spectra of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 samples were recorded using a microscopic ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) characterization and elemental mapping were performed based on a high-resolution FE-SEM/FIB (LYRA3 GMU) instrument equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis system. Current–voltage (I–V) measurements and photodetecting characteristics of the single CsPbBr3 MW based photodetector were tested on account of an optoelectronic measuring system, which contains a xenon lamp, a monochromator and a semiconductor analysis device (Keithley B1500A). All the measurements were carried out at room temperature.
3 Results and discussion
As was described in the Experimental section, individual CsPbBr3 MWs with well-defined geometries were fabricated through solution-phase quasi-static synthesis. Compared with the CVD method, our designed method can be carried out at a lower temperature (60 °C) in an atmospheric environment. The preparation of CsPbBr3 samples exhibits much flexibility and expansibility, and the synthesis is no longer limited by the substrate availability. The schematic diagram of preparing single-crystal perovskite MWs is schematically depicted in Fig. 1(a). In the synthesis process, the nucleation should be initially concentrated on the substrate. Introducing an anti-solvent IPA can prompt instant supersaturation of the precursor solution, resulting in the nucleation of the perovskite as fast as possible.37,38 In the next step, the precursor solution of the mixed IPA, DMSO, CsBr and PbBr2 is then sandwiched by two freshly cleaned glass substrates, which makes the reaction system free from the impact of surroundings. The synthesis of CsPbBr3 MWs presented in this work has the following advantages: (1) it utilizes common and cheap chemicals; (2) they can be synthesized under ambient conditions instead of an inert gas atmosphere; (3) the final products are CsPbBr3 MWs scattered individually, which does not require further refinement or transferring processes; (4) the synthesis procedure is facile, time-saving and highly repeatable. As a result, individual CsPbBr3 MWs can be obtained through the improved method with cross-sectional sizes ranging from several microns to tens of micrometers, and the length varies from 100 mm to several millimeters. The crystal structure of CsPbBr3 is shown in Fig. 1(b).

(f) PL and absorbance spectra of a single CsPbBr3 MW. Inset: the Tauc plot of the CsPbBr3 MW, giving rise to an optical bandgap Eg ∼ 2.27 eV. 
The EDS results of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 sample are shown in Fig. 1(c). From the figure, the chemical elements Cs, Pb, and Br that exhibit a molar ratio of approximately 1:1:3 can be detected. The results are principally consistent with the stoichiometry of CsPbBr3. Besides, the observed strongest signal in the EDS spectrum is assigned to the Si chip, which is featured as a substrate in the measurement. Fig. 1(d) shows the elemental mapping of the Cs, Pb and Br species, respectively. It indicates that the detected elements are uniformly distributed in a single CsPbBr3 wire. The crystallinity of the as-grown CsPbBr3 sample was measured by means of XRD patterns. Fig. 1(e) reveals that the strong diffraction peaks centered at 15° and 30.73° can be ascribed to the (100) and (200) planes of CsPbBr3, respectively. The XRD result of the as-synthesized samples is in good agreement with the diffraction pattern obtained from the JCPDS database (No. 18-0364).39,40 The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of CsPbBr3 MWs is only 0.018°. Fig. 1(f) shows the PL and absorption spectra of the CsPbBr3 MW. The main PL wavelength of the CsPbBr3 sample is centered at 525 nm with a FWHM of 17 nm. In the absorption spectrum, a strong absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible wavelengths was observed. Accordingly, the optical energy bandgap is evaluated to be about 2.27 eV based on the plot of the formula (ahv)2 as a function of photon energy (hv) (see Fig. 1(f)). In general, the experimental results indicate that the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 wires prepared on the glass substrate possess a high crystalline quality, which is fundamental for the fabrication of high-performance photodetectors.41
Illustrated in Fig. 2(a) is a schematic of the photodetector structure, which is made of a single CsPbBr3 MW placed on a clean PET substrate. In the device, Ag electrodes were dropped onto both ends of the CsPbBr3 wire. The fabrication procedure is described in detail in the Experimental section. Upon illumination by different light wavelengths, the typical I–V curves were plotted on a logarithmic scale of the device and these are illustrated in Fig. 2(b); the results were obtained in the dark and under differently illuminated lights of 365 nm (∼8.20 mW cm−2), 395 nm (∼10.11 mW cm−2), 405 nm (∼12.81 mW cm−2) and 532 nm (∼11.28 mW cm−2) by using a Xe lamp as a light source and a monochromator. The recorded photocurrents strongly depended on the illuminated light wavelengths and the corresponding light power density. As the illumination wavelength increases from 365 to 405 nm, the photocurrent is enhanced prominently. The device posed a low dark current of 7.46 × 10−11 A and the ON/OFF ratio was determined to be ∼three orders of magnitude at 3 V under 405 nm light irradiation. Additionally, the device also showed an excellent photoresponse characteristic measured with the time-dependent photocurrent (I–T) at various intensities ranging from 1.60 to 12.81 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 2(c), when the optical density is increased from 1.60 to 12.81 mW cm−2, the measured photocurrents aggrandize from 0.99 nA at 1.60 mW cm−2, 1.58 nA at 4.06 mW cm−2, 2.84 nA at 6.52 mW cm−2, and 4.79 nA at 8.67 mW cm−2, and then increase to 10.79 nA at 12.81 mW cm−2. At the same time, the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector device exhibits a relatively repeatable and stable photocurrent under all the fixed optical power intensities.
The significant performance metrics of photodetectors include the responsivity (Rλ), linear dynamic range (LDR), detectivity (D*) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). The responsivity (Rλ) can be described as follows:42 (1)In this formula, Ip and Id are the photocurrent and dark current of the device. S is the effectively illuminated active area. Pλ is the average power density. In the present research, the effective illumination area (S) is measured to be approximately 1.2 × 10−4 cm2. LDR can be expressed by the following formula: (2)In this formula, Id is the dark current and Ip is the photocurrent. Generally, the detectivity (D*) demonstrates the noise equivalent power (NEP) in a photodetector and can be calculated as follows: (3)where R is the responsivity, A is the effective irradiation area, e is the electron charge, and Id is the dark-current. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a fabricated photodetector can be determined from the measured photocurrents via the following formula: (4)In this formula, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e is the electron charge and λ is the wavelength of radiated light.

(d) Wavelength-dependent responsivity of the single CsPbBr3 MW photodetector by varying the operation bias voltage in the range of 0–3.0 V. (e) The calculated LDR of the prepared photodetector when illuminated at different light wavelengths. The operation bias voltage varies from 0 to 3.0 V. (f) Energy band diagram of the device. 
The biased voltage-dependent responsivity of the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector is shown in Fig. 2(d). As shown in the responsivity spectra, the device exhibits a maximum photoresponse peaking at around 405 nm. The corresponding response wavelengths vary from 150 to 500 nm, covering from the UV band to the green band. The responsivity of the device increases as the voltage strengthens. The peak responsivity can reach up to 5.83 A W−1 when working at a forward bias voltage of 3 V. The linear dynamic range (LDR) demonstrates that the photodetection device exhibits a linear photoresponse to illuminated light intensities within a certain range and can maintain a changeless responsivity. As shown in Fig. 2(e), the LDR is determined to be ∼50 dB at 405 nm. This indicates that within a certain range, the photocurrent has a linear response as the incident light intensity changes. The energy diagram of the photodetector device is also provided in Fig. 2(f). In the CsPbBr3 MSM photodetector device, ohmic contact between the CsPbBr3 MW and the Ag electrode was formed. When the device was illuminated by 405 nm light and a bias voltage, electron–hole pairs were generated in the perovskite according to the photoelectric effect. Then the photo-generated charge carriers were rapidly separated and collected by electrodes under the assistance of an internal electric field.
Consequently, the fabricated photodetector on account of a single CsPbBr3 MW shows good photodetection capabilities, including a responsivity of 5.83 A W−1, a detectivity of 2.52 × 1013 Jones, a LDR of 46.74 dB, an on–off ratio of 144, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.67 × 103% upon 405 nm light illumination at a voltage of 3 V. It is obvious that the bare CsPbBr3 MW photodetector has no distinctly unique advantages relating to photodetection characteristics compared with other previously reported perovskite-based photodetectors.43,44 However, the photosensitivity is still lower than expected, which can be attributed to the carrier recombination, unsatisfactory charge transport and band alignment which are caused by the surface defects of the CsPbBr3 MW.45–47 Metal structures have been employed to optimize the performance of optoelectronics and optical devices.48–56 Among those, Ag is widely used to realize performance-enhanced photodetection for the work function of Ag is close to that of most perovskites. Thus, it is meaningful to carry out an investigation about performance-enhanced perovskite photodetectors in combination with Ag.
As an alternative, a Ag nanolayer ∼30 nm in thickness was introduced to evaporate on the wire using a magnetron sputtering system. A comparative experiment on the thickness of the Ag quasi-particles nanolayer is shown in Fig. S1.† The single CsPbBr3 wire covered by the Ag nanolayer was characterized, as shown in Fig. 3(a), and an enlarged SEM image of the Ag nanolayer is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3(a). From the figures, the evaporation of Ag nanostructures on the CsPbBr3 sample can be clearly observed. To evaluate the influence of the Ag nanolayer on the photodetection performance of the fabricated CsPbBr3 MW photodetector, photocurrent–voltage tests were performed in the dark and under 405 nm light illumination with different light intensities ranging from 1.06 to 12.81 mW cm−2. The I–V characteristic curves of light ON/OFF states are plotted in Fig. 3(b). Clearly, increasing the light illumination intensity can lead to a significant enhancement of the measured photocurrent. For example, as the incident light power intensity reached 12.81 mW cm−2, the photocurrent of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW detector was measured to be about 8.60 × 10−7 A, which was an increase over five orders of magnitude larger than that of the dark current. It is worth noting that the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW device shows significant responses at both the reverse and forward bias voltages. The peak responsivity of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector was evaluated to be about 18.96 A W−1, which is much larger than that of the uncovered CsPbBr3 MW photodetector (∼5.81 A W−1) (see Fig. 3(c)).

The inset shows the enlarged Ag nanostructures. (b) Photodetection characterization via I–V curves of a single Ag@CsPbBr3 wire detector in the dark and under light illumination of different light intensities. (c) The responsivities of the single CsPbBr3 MW detectors uncovered and covered by an Ag nanolayer when operated at a forward bias voltage of 3 V are shown for comparison. The light power intensity is fixed at 12.81 mW cm−2. (d) Time-dependent ON/OFF photoswitching tests of the fabricated detectors with the light (405 nm, 12.81 mW cm−2) on and off at a bias voltage of 3 V. The time-fitting response speed of the fabricated CsPbBr3 MW photodetector uncovered (e) and covered by a Ag nanolayer (f), extracted from the I–T characteristic curves. 
When operated at a forward bias voltage of 3 V under 405 nm light illumination with a light power intensity of 12.81 mW cm−2, the time-resolved response curves of the fabricated CsPbBr3 MW photodetector uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer were generated and are plotted in Fig. 3(d). The dynamic light responses of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW and CsPbBr3 MW photodetectors are stable, indicating that the devices possess extraordinary stable photo-sensitive behaviors, thus indicating that the fabricated CsPbBr3 MW photodetectors have an insignificant degeneracy effect with the ability to work continuously. When operating at a forward bias voltage of 3 V, the photocurrent responses of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector increased sharply to 877 nA and then dropped quickly to 0.12 nA when the light was turned ON/OFF. The measured photocurrent is increased over 100 orders of magnitude higher than that of the uncovered CsPbBr3 MW photodetector. This phenomenon of enhanced photocurrent values is usually explained by the improvement of the efficiency of photoelectric conversion. Accordingly, the photoresponse speeds in the case of rising/decaying times of the fabricated photodetector uncovered and covered by a Ag nanofilm were calculated and the results are shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f), respectively. The rise time (τr, the time it takes for the photocurrent to reach 90% from 10%) is defined as the duration of the photocurrent, while the decay time (τd) is defined as the time of the inverse course. From the figures, the τr/τd value of the fabricated Ag@CsPbBr3 MW detector is measured to be about 17/57 ms, which is much faster than that of the uncovered perovskite device (τr/τd ∼ 79/120 ms). The enhancement of the response rate including the rising and falling edges is attributed to the deposition of the Ag nanolayer on the CsPbBr3 MW.

Fig. 4(a) shows the logarithmic I–V curves of the fabricated perovskite photodetectors in the dark and under 405 nm light illumination with a light intensity of 12.81 mW cm−2. In the devices, the individual CsPbBr3 MW was uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer. Under darkness (the red and blue lines), the recorded dark-current of the fabricated Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector hardly changed at all compared with that of the uncovered CsPbBr3 MW device. In contrast, the photocurrent of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector can reach up to 8.60 × 10−7 A at 3 V, which is about 4.7 times enhanced compared with the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector (∼1.08 × 10−8 A). In particular, at an operating bias voltage of 3 V, the ON/OFF switching (Ip/Id) of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector is evaluated to be about 105, which is increased by about 119 times compared to that of the uncovered device. Fig. 4(b) shows the bias voltage-dependent responsivity of the fabricated perovskite detectors based on a single CsPbBr3 MW uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer. The calculated responsivities exhibit a nearly linear increase with the bias voltage in the range of 0–3.0 V, which can be derived from the enhancement of the photocurrents. Significantly, the responsivity of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector is much more superior to that of the uncovered CsPbBr3 MW device, highlighting the positive influence of cladding metal nanostructures on the low-dimensional perovskite materials. For instance, at an operating bias voltage of 2 V, a responsivity of 12.4 A W−1 can be achieved in the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW detector, which is about 3.5-fold larger than that of the uncovered device. If we interpolate the curves to lower operating bias voltages, the enhancement in responsivity would be even larger. The calculated LDR values of the fabricated detectors are shown in Fig. 4(c) for comparison. At the operation bias voltage range of 0 to 3 V, the super high LDR (over 70 dB) of the as-constructed Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector shows a relatively larger ratio of photo-current to dark current and has an extremely higher signal-to-noise ratio. Interestingly, the LDR value of our Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector is much larger than those of commercial photodetectors (∼66 dB).
 Fig. 4  Comparison of the fabricated single CsPbBr3 MW photodetectors uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer. (a) Logarithmic I–V curves of the fabricated single MW photodetectors under darkness and upon 405 nm light illumination (the incident light power intensity was fixed at 12.81 mW cm−2). In the devices, the CsPbBr3 MW used was uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer, respectively. Comparison of the calculated responsivity (b), LDR (c), detectivity (d) and EQE (e) of the fabricated photodetector devices, which were operated under 405 nm light illumination with an optical power intensity of 12.81 mW cm−2. The biased voltage varied in the range of 0–3 V. (f) Logarithmic plot of the photocurrent versus the incident light irradiation power at a forward bias voltage of 3.0 V. 
Based on the eqn (3), the detectivities (D*) of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector and CsPbBr3 MW photodetector as a function of the voltage were calculated. As illustrated in Fig. 4(d), the maximum D* is evaluated to be as high as 16.7 × 1013 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 per W) under 405 nm light. The calculated D* is consistently 6.37 orders higher than that of the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector (2.52 × 1013 Jones) at the same bias voltages. The EQE values of the devices without and with the Ag quasiparticle nanofilm are compared in Fig. 4(e), in which the EQE of the photodetector with Ag quasiparticle nanofilm is much larger than that of the device without Ag quasiparticle nanofilm, even though the EQE corresponding to the device without the Ag quasiparticle nanofilm has been multiplied by a factor of 3.34. Under the radiation intensity of 12.81 mW cm−2 and 405 nm light, the EQE of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector reach the maximum value of 5609%. Fig. 4(f) illustrates the nonlinear relationship between the light power (P) and photocurrent (Ip) which are defined by an ordinary power law: Ip ∝ APθ. In this formula, A is a constant with a certain wavelength and the exponent θ indicates the character on the generation and recombination behavior of the photocurrent and shows an ideal state of the devices. In general, the parameter θ is less than 1.0 since a proportion of photogenerated charge carriers recombine before they are collected by the Ag electrodes. Consequently, a large parameter θ suggests that more photogenerated charge carriers are collected. The best-fitting results are shown in Fig. 4(f), giving values of the parameter θ of 0.87 and 0.96 for the CsPbBr3 and Ag@CsPbBr3 photodetectors, respectively. As a result, an increased collection of photogenerated charge carriers occurs in the Ag@CsPbBr3 photodetector.
The reliability of our fabricated CsPbBr3 MW detectors uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer was studied. During the long-term stability measurement, the fabricated photodetectors were without any encapsulation and stored in an ambient environment with a humidity of 20–50% and with storage temperature ranging from 20–35 °C. First, the transient switching response of the fabricated photodetector uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer was measured when operated under 405 nm light illumination with an optical power intensity of 12.81 mW cm−2 at 3 V, which could be used to identify the stability of the ON/OFF switching features. The ON/OFF state photocurrent monitoring for 238 continuous switching cycles is shown in Fig. 5(a). By comparison, the photocurrent of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector device retained ∼92.3% of the initial performance after 238 cycles, which illustrates that it is much more stable than the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector device (retained ∼66.0%). In particular, for the fabricated Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector, there is nearly negligible variation in the ON/OFF state photocurrent during the measurement, suggesting its excellent reversibility and stability. It is clearly illustrated that the recorded photocurrent can be effectively turned on and off in the visible light region with fast response time. After being stored in a normal laboratory environment for about 30 days, the dark-current and photocurrent of the fabricated detectors were further recorded. The variations of the ON/OFF state photocurrent of the fabricated photodetectors are demonstrated in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively. The photocurrent of a single CsPbBr3 MW photodetector dropped from 10.78 to 7.11 nA. Meanwhile the obtained photocurrent of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector remained at around 818 nA, which was almost unchanged. We further exploit the influence of the Ag nanolayer on the stability of the fabricated CsPbBr3 MW photodetector. Fig. 5(d) shows the I–V curves of the device in a logarithmic plot when exposed to 405 nm light illumination. The I–V curves show that the device responded nearly identically to the illumination of 405 nm light of the same optical power intensity after 0 and 30 days of exposure. In comparison with the uncovered perovskite, these results show that the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector exhibits superior stability.

(a) Time-resolved photocurrent of the fabricated photodetectors with 405 nm illumination switched on and off for 238 cycles. In the detectors, the single CsPbBr3 wire was uncovered and covered by a Ag nanolayer. For the photocurrent measurement, the incident light power intensity was fixed at 12.81 mW cm−2, and the bias voltage was 3 V.

(d) I–V characteristic curves of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector stored in the atmosphere for 30 days under 405 nm illumination with a power density of 12.81 mW cm−2 at room temperature. 
The flexibility of photodetectors is also of great importance for wearable device applications. A flexible photodetector that uses PET as the device substrate was constructed, in which the used CsPbBr3 MW was covered by a Ag nanolayer. Here, a typical device with a bending configuration is shown in Fig. 6(a). The performance of the photoresponse was measured after cycles of repeated bending tests. As shown in Fig. 6(b), Ip and Id show high stability after 400 bending cycles. Moreover, Fig. 6(b) shows that the current ON/OFF ratio of the photodetectors can be kept at 63.5% after 400 bending-and-recovery cycles, indicating the good robustness of the devices. R and D* are plotted in Fig. 6(c). R declines rapidly in the first 100 bending cycles and then remains almost unchanged before a sharp drop after 300 bending cycles. Logarithmic I–V curve measurements were performed under several values of θ as shown in Fig. 6(d), and the inset of Fig. 6(d) illustrates the schematic diagram of the flexible photodetector with various bending angles. The photocurrent shows no significant degradation. Fig. 6(e) shows that the photocurrent of the flexible photodetector had no significant loss when the device had been bent from 0 to 90°. And it is clearly seen that R and LDR remained at a high level when the bending angle was below 90° (see Fig. 6(f)). These results suggest that the CsPbBr3 photodetector exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility.

The probable working mechanisms of the devices without and with a Ag nanolayer decoration are illustrated in Fig. 7. When the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector was illuminated by 405 nm light, photoinduced electron–holes were generated in the CsPbBr3 MW, forming a detectable photocurrent. The separation and transport of the generated electrons and holes would be affected by the surface defects. According to a previous literature report, the appearance of surface defects in the as-synthesized low-dimensional CsPbBr3 structures, such as vacancies (VPb, VBr and VCs), antisites (PbBr and CsBr), and interstitial defects (Pbi and Csi), is unavoidable.67 For example, when the electrons transfer in the CsPbBr3 wire channel, they will be easily captured by the defects, thus forming non-radiative recombination centers (see Fig. 7(a)(iii)).68 These formed trap states will cause an increase of the nonradiative ratio for photogenerated carriers, resulting in a significant reduction of the carrier charge collection. Therefore, those unfavorable non-radiative recombination centers further degrade the detection performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

As an alternative scheme, a Ag quasiparticle film with appropriate thickness was sputtered on the CsPbBr3 MW using the magnetron sputtering method. The schematic diagram of the fabricated single CsPbBr3 MW photodetection device that was covered by a Ag nanolayer is shown in Fig. 7(b)(i). Capping with a Ag nanolayer can work as an electron-transfer bridge to allow transport of electrons in the case that the work function of the Ag is nearly consistent with the conduction band position of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 samples. Thus, the Ag nanolayer employed as a surface cleaner can remove weakly bonded defective species, vacancies and residual ionic species from the CsPbBr3 MW surfaces, thus achieving effective suppression of surface defects.69 Furthermore, the obviously optimized response speed and the enhanced photocurrents of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector can be regarded as compelling evidence for the surface passivation of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 MWs with the aid of metal nanostructure capping. Additionally, the Ag nanolayer can also offer another transport channel for the photogenerated electrons. The incorporation of Ag nanostructures can effectively facilitate surface cleaning and passivate trap states for the perovskite structures, thus balancing electron and hole transfer, eliminating charge accumulation, and reducing recombination of charge carriers, and eventually enhancing the device performances. Therefore, an easy method of combining CsPbBr3 MWs with a Ag quasiparticle film is proposed to fabricate high-performance photodetectors. The inference above can be confirmed by the experimental results. As shown in Table 1, the fabricated CsPbBr3 MW photodetectors show a comparable performance with previously reported devices fabricated using various perovskite-based materials and structures. By employing a Ag nanolayer, a performance-enhanced Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector with a remarkably large ON/OFF ratio, high detectivity and good responsivity, which is the most competitive for practical applications, was successfully fabricated.

4 Conclusions
In summary, a performance-enhanced CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector has been proposed and demonstrated by covering it with a Ag nanolayer. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this work are as follows. Compared with the CsPbBr3 MW photodetector, the detectivity of the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector increased 6.65 times and the EQE increased 3.34 times. Meanwhile, the LDR of the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector was improved 1.81 times after the decoration with a Ag quasiparticle nanofilm. Additionally, the Ag@CsPbBr3 MW photodetector exhibits excellent mechanical stability and flexibility without obvious degradation in its photoresponse after repeated bending cycles. The experimental characterization shows that the improved performance and remarkable stability of the device originated from surface passivation, surface cleaning and elimination of trap states in CsPbBr3 due to the cladding of a Ag nanolayer. Therefore, our results may promote the application of perovskite devices for highly efficient optoelectronics and will accelerate their commercialization in the future.
