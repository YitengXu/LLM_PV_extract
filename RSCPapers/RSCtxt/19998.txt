    , Accepted 23rd April 2012First published on 29th May 2012AbstractA divergence from the conventional approach to chromophore design has led to the establishment of many exciting new benchmarks for the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), including the first documented power conversion efficiency in excess of 12% at 1 sun illumination [Yella et al., Science 2011, 334, 629]. Paramount to these advances is the deviation from polypyridyl ruthenium dyes bearing NCS− ligands, such as [Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2] (N3; dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine). While metal-free and porphyrin dyes have demonstrated much promise, the discovery that the NCS− ligands of N3 can be replaced by anionic, chelating cyclometalating ligands without compromising device efficiencies has ushered in a new era of ruthenium dye development. A particularly appealing feature of this class of dyestuff is that they offer acute control of the frontier molecular orbitals to enable the precise attenuation of both the ground and excited state redox potentials through judicious chemical modification of the aryl ring. This Perspective summarizes very recent developments in the field, and demonstrates how the new and rapidly expanding class of Ru-based sensitizers provides a conduit for enhancing the performance (and potentially the stability) of the DSSC.Kiyoshi RobsonKiyoshi Robson was born and raised in Vernon, British Columbia, Canada.

1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1,2 have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Si-based and thin-film photovoltaic technologies. Silicon-based PV devices, for example, are exquisitely sensitive to the intensity of the incident sunlight thus rendering their use optimal for solar farms in areas that receive intense sunlight.3 The relatively constant power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSC at all light levels, on the other hand, is better suited for urban and indoor applications.4 The DSSC also does not require rigorously pure materials and is therefore distinguished by a lower embodied energy relative to conventional PV technologies.4 While thin-film PV devices (e.g., CdTe, CIGS, GaAs) may offer many of the same benefits as the DSSC – and display superior PCEs in certain cases (e.g., ∼28%)5 – the reliance on rare earth, toxic and expensive materials may ultimately limit their scalability as we strive to reach the Terawatt level of clean power generation.6
Among the suite of emerging PV technologies, the DSSC is arguably the best positioned to penetrate the market in the immediate future. The stability of the DSSC nonetheless remains a significant impediment to commercialization due to the hermetic sealing of the electrolyte and the degradation of the dye.4,5,7,8 While solid-state electrolytes could help to resolve said problems,9,10 charge-transport limitations have hitherto confined performance to unacceptably low levels thus restricting commercial devices to liquid electrolytes. The long-term stability of sensitizers represents another critical problem.7,11 Indeed, the current set of commercially relevant dyes (e.g., N3, N719, Black Dye; Fig. 1) are susceptible to degradation over time due, at least in part, to the loss of the monodentate, labile NCS− ligands.11 In recognition of these shortcomings, our research program (and others) have sought to replace these NCS− ligands with chelating bidentate and tridentate ligands without compromising device performance.12,13 This line of inquiry has unraveled a compelling approach to modulating both the ground and excited state redox potentials – an unprecedented accomplishment for high-performance DSSC dyes.13 These developments will be presented in this Perspective to demonstrate how the physicochemical properties of these chromophores will help the DSSC reach new benchmarks in performance in the not-too-distant future.

2. High-performance DSSC dyes
There are a number of prevailing features among “champion dyes” (i.e., dyes that generate a PCE > 10% in the DSSC; Fig. 1) that enable a high PCE in the DSSC: effective charge-separation upon light absorption; panchromatic absorption envelope; suitably positioned ground and excited state redox potentials; and reasonably good thermal and chemical stabilities.32,33 A key aspect of light-induced charge-separation is distancing the donor chromophore group from the acceptor ligands, where the latter are held in close proximity to the TiO2 surface to facilitate electron injection. In N3, for example, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized primarily on the metal–thiocyanate fragment while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is confined to the π* orbitals of the dcbpy (dcbpy = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine) anchoring ligands.2 Not only does this scenario foster vectorial electron-transfer towards the TiO2 surface, the resultant electronic asymmetry lowers the degeneracy of the energy levels of the frontier orbitals to increase the number of non-degenerate allowed transitions to further enhance light absorption.
The ability to absorb panchromatic light remains a fundamental challenge for discrete molecules, but the predominant strategy is to enhance the conjugation of the π* system of the polypyridyl ligands. The onset of absorption for the Black Dye ([Ru(Htctpy)(NCS)3](NBu4)3];29 Htctpy = the doubly deprotonated version of H3tctpy; H3tctpy = 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:;6′,2′′-terpyridine; Fig. 1), for example, is found at much longer wavelengths compared to most Ru-based dyes because generally the LUMO is a π* system delocalized over three pyridine rings of the H3tctpy ligand rather than the two that constitute the dcbpy ligands found in most Ru-based champion dyes (Fig. 1). Alternative strategies to enhance light absorption include the installation of conjugated aromatic rings including, but not limited to, thiophene (C101; Fig. 1), selenophene (C105) and EDOT (C107), to the N3 scaffold.14,23,34,35 While champion dyes have historically been derivatives of N3,4 this landscape has recently changed upon the discoveries of an organic sensitizer (C219) that can reach a PCE of 10.1%, and the co-sensitization of TiO2 by a porphyrin (YD2-o-C8) and organic dye (Y123), which achieves a PCE of an unprecedented 12.3% at 1 Sun – and 13.1% at 0.5 Sun!15 While these examples do not resemble N3 with respect to molecular structure, the dyes still conform to all of the aforementioned molecular design principles necessary for sensitizing TiO2.
The basic operating principles of the DSSC are summarized in Fig. 2.36 A prerequisite for electron injection into TiO2 is an excited state (from which injection occurs) being positioned energetically above the conduction band (Ecb) of TiO2 (∼ −0.5 V vs. NHE). The regeneration of the photo-oxidized dyes by I− requires a driving force that is >500 mV (based on the I−/I3− redox couple of ∼ +0.4 V vs. NHE in MeCN) thus demanding that the HOMO level be positioned lower than +0.9 V vs. NHE in energy. Indeed, all of the Ru-based champion dyes that we surveyed in the literature indicated HOMO levels at E < +0.9 V.13 The apparent driving force for dye regeneration is somewhat misleading, however, because this single electron-transfer process is likely better defined by a I2−˙/I− redox potential of +0.8 ± 0.1 V rather than the 2-electron chemical transformation between I3− and I− measured at the Pt electrode.37,38 Recognition of these energy levels is important (vide infra) in that they define the minimum HOMO–LUMO energy gap that can be used for effective light absorption and charge extraction when relying on the I¬/I3¬ redox couple; i.e., electrons generated by light absorption at wavelengths longer than ∼900 nm will generally not be converted into useful electrical work.

Processes I–V (blue arrows) should ideally be kinetically favoured over the recombination processes VI–IX (red arrows). 
3. Cycloruthenated dyes
Several excellent recent reviews have documented how the cyclometalation of Ru has formed the basis of many different areas of research spanning many fields over the past four decades.40–42 It is also worth mentioning that the cyclometalated chemistry of Pd, Ir and Rh has provided a wealth of synthetic and physical knowledge pertinent to the work presented herein.43–47 The key precursor to cycloruthenated dyestuff relevant to this Perspective emerged in the mid-1980's when Constable and Holmes48 and Reveco et al.49 concurrently reported the synthesis of [Ru(bpy)2(ppy)]+ (Fig. 3) (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; ppy = 2-phenylpyridine). Analogous systems bearing tridentate ligands (e.g., [Ru(tpy)(pbpy)]+, tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine; pbpy = 6-phenyl-2,2′-bipyridine; Fig. 3) were reported shortly thereafter along with important synthetic breakthroughs for accessing complexes of this type.50,51 Subsequent work by Sauvage,52,53 Thummel,54,55 and many others56–75 have provided critical insight into how the organometallic bond can affect the photophysical and electrochemical properties of this class of molecules (Fig. 3). While the emission properties of cycloruthenated complexes are far less diverse than those of their polypyridyl counterparts,40,67 a number of creative strategies have been implemented to enhance this behavior vis-à-vis longer excited state lifetimes.56 There have also been a number of synthetic advances that have provided access to a host of bis- and tris-heteroleptic cyclometalated dyes that are presented herein.74,76,77
 Fig. 3  Representative cycloruthenated complexes in the literature: (a) [Ru(bpy)2(ppy)]+;48,49 (b) [Ru(tpy)(pbpy)]+;50 (c) [Ru(tpy)(dpb)]+ (dpb = 1,3-di(pyridin-2-yl)benzene);65 (d) [(tpy)Ru(tpb)Ru(tpy)]2+ (tpb = 3,3′,5,5′-tetra(pyridin-2-yl)benzene);60 (d) [Ru(dqp)(dqb)]+ (dqp = 2,6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine; dqb = 1,3-di(quinolin-8-yl)benzene).56 
Our interest in cyclometalated complexes was triggered by a 2006 report by Mayo et al. that demonstrated sensitization of TiO2 by a cyclometalated Ir complex, [Ir(dcbpy)(ppz)2]+ (ppz = 2-phenylpyrazole).78 While this study did not generate a high PCE in the DSSC due to weak absorption of visible light, it demonstrated a proof-of-principle that prompted us to evaluate analogous Ru-based systems because of their superior spectral coverage in the visible region. Shortly thereafter, the first example of a cycloruthenated sensitizer on TiO2 was reported by van Koten et al. to produce a modest PCE (vide infra).79 Indeed, inspection of the physical properties of [Ru(bpy)2(ppy)]+ revealed it to be poised for the effective sensitization of TiO2 upon the addition of anchoring substituents; i.e., an absorption profile extending out to >550 nm and suitable ground- and excited state redox potentials (Fig. 4).48 Moreover, the optical and electrochemical properties of the corresponding dye (which we define as a complex containing chemical groups capable of anchoring the complex to the semiconductor surface), [Ru(dcbpy)2(ppy)]+ (1), bears a striking resemblance to that of N3.12 Although the chelating ppy− ligand is a stronger donor ligand than the two anionic NCS− ligands, as evidenced by the oxidative wave of 1 (ca. +0.96 V vs NHE) being cathodically shifted by ca. 130 mV relative to N3, 1 is still appropriately positioned for regeneration by I− (vide infra). The HOMO for both N3 and 1 is delocalized over the metal and anionic ligand(s), while the LUMOs are confined to the anchoring ligands in both cases. The effectiveness of the cycloruthenated motif as a molecular platform for “champion” sensitizers was shown in 2009 by Grätzel et al. that a PCE of 9.8% could be achieved for 1.24 This same study showed that a related complex with a higher oxidation potential (E1/2,ox = 1.09 V vs. NHE), [Ru(dcbpy)2(ppy-F2)]+ (YE05; ppy-F2 = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine; Fig. 1), could achieve 10.1% thus ushering in a new era of commercially relevant dye development for the DSSC.24

One of the unique advantages of this class of dyestuff is the acute control of the energy of the HOMO through modification of the substituents of the anionic ring (Fig. 5).80 This feature stands in stark contrast to thiocyanate-based dyestuff where direct attenuation of the HOMO energy level would require the synthetically challenging chemical alteration of the NCS− ligand. On the other hand, the installation of electron-donating or -withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring of 1 can lower or increase, respectively, the metal-based oxidation potential over a >400 mV range. Attaching aromatic groups on this same ring to extend the conjugation from the metal and anionic ring (and to increase the light-induced charge-separation distance) has also proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing the optical cross-section of the dyes. The Ru cyclometalated motif is an attractive platform because it satisfies the criteria for a good chromophore. Replacing the labile, monodentate, thiocyanate ligands with chelating multidentate cyclometalating ligands could, in principle, engender greater long-term stability.8,81 While experiments are underway in our labs to show that chelating ligands do increase long-term stability, there still exists no meaningful quantitative data to corroborate this claim.

Modification of –R2 improves light harvesting through an extended π-system while modulating the energy of the HOMO, representing a comparative advantage in view of the difficulty in chemically modifying the NCS− groups.80 
4. Ru dyes bearing a bidentate cyclometalating ligand
4.1 Synthetic protocols
The first cyclometalated dyes bearing bidentate ligands (e.g., 1) were assembled by installing the C^N ligand on the metal in either the first or last ligand coordination step.12 The synthesis of YE05 involved the addition of ppy-F2 to cis-Ru(dcbpy)2Cl2—a synthon that is employed in the synthesis of N3. Avoiding the presence of light is critical for this precursor, however, because isomerization to the trans form will preclude the cyclometalation reaction. We have therefore adopted a procedure where ppy− is chelated to the Ru site in the first ligation step to avoid said isomerization issues (with the added benefit of accessing a platform that is available to sequential ligation of distinctive ligands to create trisheteroleptic sensitizers; vide infra). In an approach similar to that reported by Fernandez et al.,51 the combination of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 and a cyclometalating ligand produced a mixture of [Ru(p-cymene)(MeCN)2(C^N)]+/[Ru(MeCN)4(C^N)]+ in reasonably good yields; the mixture is used for subsequent chemistry because the slow displacement of p-cymene from the metal site does not diminish the formation of the final product. Ligands bearing electron-withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring were found to react faster than those with electron-donating moieties due to the increased acidity of the aryl proton that undergoes the requisite C–H bond-breaking event. As documented by Ryabov et al.,72 electron-rich precursors can turn green after brief exposure to air, but no detectable change in the structure via NMR spectroscopy was observed and the target dyes could still be isolated in decent yields.72 Both solvated intermediates were suitable for subsequent ligation by two dcbpy ligands in an aqueous methanolic mixture; four equivalents of base were required to solubilize the anchoring ligands and water was not used in the synthesis of certain intermediates to overcome solubility issues (e.g., [Ru(p-cymene)(MeCN)2(ppy4thio)]+) (ppy4thio = 5-(3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde). After ligation, acidification in H2O affords the fully protonated dye (Fig. 6); transformation to the fully deprotonated systems is achieved by titration with NBu4OH or an equivalent base until the aqueous dye solution reaches pH 7.
 Fig. 6  Synthetic protocol for dyes of general formula [Ru(dcbpy)2(C^N)]+.511H NMR spectroscopy shows evidence for two MeCN groups bound to the metal in the intermediate containing the cymene. The hapticity of the cymene in the intermediate is likely η4 in order to furnish an 18e− complex. 
4.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The classical coordination complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2+, is characterized by an intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band (ε = 1.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at λmax = 451 nm) in the visible region (Fig. 4).82 This band can be broadened and bathochromically shifted by replacing one of the bpy ligands with anionic ligands (e.g., NCS−, ppy−; Fig. 4). The inherently lower symmetry of the resultant complexes lowers the degeneracy of the MLCT transitions leading to more unique transitions, and the anionic charge of the ligands raises the energy of the HOMO level to a greater extent (∼800 mV) than the low-lying excited states that are localized to the bpy ligands (∼300 mV). Consequently, the λmax and onset of absorption for [Ru(bpy)2(ppy)]+ are red-shifted 95 nm and 150 nm, respectively, compared to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (Fig. 4). Importantly, the lowest-energy excited states are situated on the polypyridyl ligands that, when bearing anchoring groups, will provide a facile pathway for charge-transfer into TiO2.83 This binding mode leads to a geometric configuration that positions the anionic ligands away from the surface to better interact with the electrolyte and suppress charge recombination.84
As mentioned earlier, a limiting factor of N3 is the inability to directly control the energy of the HOMO. The HOMO for 1, however, is delocalized over the metal and the phenyl ring of ppy−, thereby enabling substituents positioned on the anionic ligand to directly affect the position of the HOMO energy level. For example, the HOMO energy of the parent ppy system (ca. +0.96 V vs NHE) is lowered by 100–200 mV with the addition of electron-withdrawing –F or –NO2 groups.80 These electrochemical trends are aligned with the optical properties, whereas the installation of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on the phenyl ring of ppy− induces a spectral blue shift while electron-donating groups (EDGs) have the opposite effect on the absorption edges. Moreover, the intensity of the absorption bands can be increased by adding conjugated substituents (e.g., -phenyl, -pyridyl, -2-thiophene-5-carbaldehyde) to the aryl ring of the ppy¬ ligand, which further extends the HOMO beyond the metal and phenyl ring to the increase the probability of photon absorption (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of [Ru(dcbpy)2(ppy-4-(2-thiophene-5-carbaldehyde)]+ (2) illustrating the expanded delocalization of the HOMO onto the conjugated substituent of the ppy− ligand. Atom labels: Ru – pink; C – gray; N – blue; O – red; S – yellow; H – omitted. 
The protonation level of sensitizers offers an additional electrochemical handle, as documented for conventional dyes.84 The extreme cases of protonated and deprotonated systems exhibit significantly different electrochemical and photophysical properties: the first oxidation potentials of the tetra or triacid systems are >+0.96 V vs. NHE while their deprotonated analogues range from +0.61 to +0.80 V. Not only do these latter values raise concerns about regeneration of the oxidized dyes, their absorption spectra are also hypsochromically shifted, thus discouraging the utility of the fully deprotonated derivatives in the DSSC.
4.3 Trisheteroleptic derivatives
Trisheteroleptic sensitizers that are based on the N3 scaffold now account for the vast majority of champion dyes in the literature (Fig. 1). The primary reasons for this are rooted in one bpy ligand needing to have two anchoring groups and the longstanding belief that the NCS− groups were necessary, thus leaving open the opportunity to manipulate one of the dcbpy ligands (Fig. 5). It has been demonstrated that replacing the acid groups of one N3 dcbpy ligand with alkyl chains and chromophoric substituents can reduce recombination at the TiO2 surface and increase the extinction coefficients, respectively. The most widely used chromophore units for this purpose include thiophene, bithiophene, aryl, and fluorenyl units, while the optimal carbon chain length has been shown to be six (e.g., C101, C104, CYCB1, Z910; see Fig. 1). Note that the use of aliphatic chains can also limit H2O from reaching the TiO2 surface, thereby engendering greater device stability.
Following this same line of inquiry, we recently developed the first examples of trisheteroleptic cycloruthenated dyes (Fig. 8).85 The isolation of these dyes required new synthetic protocols because it was found that each of the ligands must be added successively thereby precluding the “one-pot” approach that has proven effective for NCS−-containing dyes. The mixture of [Ru(p-cymene)(MeCN)(C^N)]+/[Ru(MeCN)4(C^N)]+, which was an effective starting point for furnishing complexes of type [Ru(dcbpy)2(C^N)]+, does not translate to the trisheteroleptic derivatives because the p-cymene is not labile at the low temperatures required for metal chelation of a single bpy, and higher temperatures drive the equilibrium towards the addition of two bpy units. Fortunately, the synthon, [Ru(MeCN)4(C^N)]+ generated from [Ru(C6H6)Cl2]2, was sufficiently reactive at room temperature to generate the desired intermediate [Ru(bpy)(MeCN)2(C^N)][PF6] (Fig. 9). This approach produces the desired intermediate in exclusivity if the C^N ligand is electron-rich and a poor π-acceptor, which promotes the dissociation of MeCN from the metal site. Conversely, an electron-withdrawing ligand limits dissociation of the MeCN ligands to fashion a mixture of [Ru(bpy)(MeCN)2(C^N)][PF6] and the undesirable byproduct, [Ru(bpy)2(C^N)]+. The latter product is also favored if the bpy contains an extended π-system (e.g., 4,4′-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine). While it is difficult to avoid the formation of the byproduct as well as subsequently separate it, the successive addition of 4,4′-diethylester-2,2′-bipyridine (deeb) enables the facile separation of the desired product. An alternative strategy is to add both deeb and bpy simultaneously to [Ru(MeCN)4(C^N)][PF6] to gain the product after separation (Fig. 9); this approach yields the product in similar amounts (30–50%). In either case, the deeb-containing ester product could be saponified in a DMF–H2O–NEt3 solution to yield the dye bearing a single dcbpy ligand.

 Fig. 9  Synthetic protocol for trisheteroleptic sensitizers. 
The three distinctive bidentate ligands can furnish different coordination arrangements to give rise to multiple isomers. The cyclometalating ligands may, for example, arrange in one of two possible orientations about the metal (i.e., C^N versus N^C). Note that the synthesis described above involves the formation of [Ru(bpy)(MeCN)(C^N)](PF6), where the bpy is intuitively positioned trans to the organometallic bond because MeCN is a stronger donor than bpy (the alternative isomer would involve two strong donors trans to one another), and the subsequent addition of deeb yields a single product. Taking these features into account, we had assumed that the subsequent addition of deeb retained the coordination modes of the ligands thus positioning the Ru–C bond cis to the deeb/dcbpy ligand. We recently determined this not to be the case, however, in light of the crystallographic determination of the trisheteroleptic complex, [Ru(bpy)(deeb)(ppy)]PF6, depicting an organometallic bond trans to the deeb ligand.86 While the formation of this isomer was not anticipated based on the synthesis, it does ultimately represent the more thermodynamically favorable isomer because deeb is a superior electron acceptor to bpy and can therefore better stabilize the metal centre. We therefore do not expect saponification to alter this orientation, but efforts are underway to prove it by crystallographic means.
A select series of trisheteroleptic dyes were studied in the DSSC where only the cyclometalating ligand was modified; namely, [Ru(bpy)(dcbpy)(ppy)]+(3), [Ru(bpy)(dcbpy)(ppy–F2)]+ (4) and [Ru(bpy)(dcbpy)(ppy-4-(2-thiophene-5-carbaldehyde)]+ (5) (Fig. 8).85 The fluorine groups do not significantly change the absorption profile, while 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde leads to a nearly 2-fold enhancement in absorbance of 5 between 400–750 nm relative to 3. The HOMO energies, however, corresponded to +0.70, +0.93 and +0.73 V vs. NHE for 3, 4 and 5, respectively. DSSC devices constructed with 3 and 5 showed similarly poor PCEs of ∼2.4% despite the disparity in the optical profiles (Fig. 10a). This result calls attention to the need for the HOMO to be positioned at >+0.9 V vs. NHE for efficient regeneration of the photo-oxidized dye by I− (vide infra). Dye 4 meets this criterion, and thus produced a much higher PCE (∼4.0%) despite being a much weaker light absorber than 5.

It is important to take the HOMO energy into account when designing trisheteroleptic C^N systems because derivatized bpy ligands are generally electron-rich and will therefore raise the energy of the HOMO to compromise dye regeneration. Consequently, strongly electron-withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring are needed to mitigate this effect. We therefore designed a trisheteroleptic dye where two –CF3 groups were placed on the aryl ring, while the anchoring groups on one of the dcbpy ligands were replaced with 2-hexylthiophene groups, i.e., [Ru(dthbpy)(dcbpy)(ppy–(CF3)2)] (6; dthbpy = 4,4'-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,2'-bipyridine).17 This strategy yielded a remarkably high PCE of 7.3% and short-circuit photocurrent of 16.3 mA cm−2 (note that the PCE of N3 was 6.3% when tested under the same conditions) (Fig. 9). We attribute the high performance to three key features: (i) a sufficiently high oxidation potential (+0.99 V vs. NHE); (ii) improved light harvesting by the hexylthiophene units appended to bpy (dthbpy); and (iii) reduced interaction of electrolyte with the TiO2 surface due to the presence of hydrophobic hexyl chains. Notably, the high performance of 6 is sustained in devices containing thin (i.e., 6 μm) active layers of TiO2 achieving 6.9% at 1 Sun. These results may provide an advantage for commercialization because DSSCs with thinner films have the potential to reduce fabrication costs and increase reproducibility.17 Despite the synthetic challenges encountered in obtaining trisheteroleptic sensitizers, this class of cycloruthenated dyes demonstrates a significant step toward new high-performance dyes, and opens the door to the use of new electrolytes (vide infra).
4.4 Dye regeneration and access to new electrolytes
A recurring point in this Perspective is the the HOMO energy of the dye relative to the redox couple of the electrolytes species, which leads to the important question: where exactly does the HOMO energy need to be positioned? The answer to this question requires a full appreciation of the numerous reactions that can take place within the iodide-based electrolytes.
The Voc of the DSSC can be estimated by the energy separation of the Fermi level of the semiconductor and the formal reduction potential of eqn (1): Eo = +0.4 V vs. NHE in MeCN.38 While this approach is valid because the platinized counter-electrode is capable of catalyzing the 2-electron reduction of I3− to 3I−, the reduction of a photo-oxidized dye is a process that typically involves the transfer of a single electron. Consequently, the thermodynamic driving force for the reduction of the oxidized dye by the electrolyte species is not defined by the potential corresponding to eqn (1), but rather eqn (2) (Eo = +0.8 ±0.1 V vs. NHE in MeCN38). The regeneration of the photo-oxidized dye by I− therefore requires a dye HOMO energy level positioned below ca. +0.8 V vs. NHE!17 This statement is corroborated by direct measurements of the relevant couples (orange levels in Fig. 11), and the fact that all champion dyes in the literature are characterized by oxidation potentials that are greater than +0.9 V vs. NHE (when measured in MeCN).13 (While there are other redox reactions that occur in the iodide/iodine-based electrolyte (Fig. 11, grey), they tend not to play major roles in the regenerative cycle and are therefore not detailed here.37,38) A metal-free dye with a HOMO positioned at +0.55 V vs. NHE has been shown to be efficiently regenerated,87 but the redox-active tetrathiofulvene component of this particular dye is capable of 2-e− transfer and is therefore capable of mediating different redox chemistry than conventional dyes; thus, this anomalous system is not detailed here. (1) (2)
 Fig. 11  Relevant redox potentials for a DSSC with an iodine/iodide-based electrolyte.37,38 Orange energy levels are most relevant to the regenerative cycle; auxiliary reactions are shown in grey. The relevant energy levels for the dye and TiO2 are representative values of champion devices. 
Elucidating how exactly the oxidized dye is regenerated by the electrolyte is made difficult by the transient nature of the relevant species as well as the sensitivity of the DSSC to dye/electrolyte/cell configurations.38,88,89 Notwithstanding, an examination of the redox potentials in Fig. 11 and spectroscopic evidence provide clues to the relevant processes. Mechanism C (eqn. (C1)–(C4)),88 for example, requires the formation of an iodine atom that rapidly reacts with I−, which is an endergonic process (the HOMO of most champion dyes resides over the +0.9 to +1.1 V range) and therefore unlikely to occur.88Mechanism B (eqn. (B1)–(B3)) requires an iodide pair whose formation is governed by potential-determining cations (e.g., Li+, Mg2+) near the TiO2 surface.90 This process is also energetically unfavourable compared to those reactions involving I− and I2−˙ and can therefore be ruled out as well. Mechanism A (eqn. (A1)–(A3)) is therefore arguably best aligned with the majority of the experimental data in the literature.38,89 The critical step for this mechanism involves the formation of an adduct between the oxidized dye and I− (A1), followed by reduction of the photo-oxidized dye by a second I− species that results in the formation of I2−˙ (A2), which can be observed by transient absorption spectroscopy. Two I2−˙ species then disproportionate to give I3− and I− (A3). The concept of an adduct between the iodide and dye, which was first proposed in the early 1990s by Fitzmaurice and Frei,91 has been corroborated by computational methods.92,93 Schiffmann et al. have proposed an additional cycle where I2−˙ can reduce a neighboring dye upon release from the original sensitizer, which also involves the formation of a dye-I2 adduct prior to a reaction with an incoming I− to release I3−.94 While there still remain open questions surrounding the interaction of the dye and electrolyte, it does seem that the regeneration process involves the formation of a dye⋯I− adduct. While there is much support for the polarizable S atom of the NCS− groups playing a critical role in this interaction,95 high cell efficiencies with cyclometalated dyes devoid of S atoms shows that they are not a prerequisite.

The cyclometalated sensitizer 6 generates a high DSSC PCE using the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox shuttle, which has gained renewed interest as an electrolyte in light of the high cell performance recently obtained with an organic sensitizer.96 (Previous studies on conventional dyes with one-electron redox shuttles were not exceedingly promising due to the facile interception of the injected electron in TiO2 by the electrolyte.97,98) Utilizing a cobalt-based electrolyte, 6 produced one of the highest power conversion efficiencies (5.5%) for a Ru dye at full sun light intensity to date (N3 did not yield a PCE higher than 1% under the same conditions).17 Notably, this value was measured without the use of blocking layers that are commonly needed for electrolytes associated with a 1 − e− redox couple.98,99 Our current belief is that this higher performance is manifest in the orbital geometry of the HOMO being better optimized to chemically interact with the Co-based electrolyte relative to dyes bearing NCS− groups, while dyes containing soft S atoms presumably have a higher affinity for the I−-based species in solution. This claim is not yet proven and thus studies are underway in our labs to probe this point in further detail.
5. Bistridentate cycloruthenated complexes
5.1. Background
The highest certified PCE measured for a DSSC stood at 11.4% until only very recently;15 the dye used to achieve this benchmark was the black dye (Fig. 1).29 Despite this achievement in device performance, the black dye long stood as the only documented example of a “champion” sensitizer bearing a tridentate ligand (Fig. 1). The reasons for this are rooted in the parent complex [Ru(tpy)2]2+ being characterized by inferior spectral coverage and more accessible excited state deactivation pathways [due to the close proximity of the metal-based (3MC) state to the π* (3MLCT)] relative to analogues of [Ru(bpy)3]2+.82 The substitution of one ligand of [Ru(tpy)2]2+ with three NCS− ligands overcomes these problems because the anionic ligands raise the energy level of the HOMO to induce a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption properties, and help separate the 3MC and 3MLCT states to suppress deactivation pathways enabling more efficient charge injection. While the black dye absorbs light at λ > 800 nm, the use of a single polypyridyl ligand in conjunction with the C2v symmetry of the complex does not promote high ε values (e.g., ∼7000 M−1 cm−1 at 611 nm), thus requiring relatively thick active layers of TiO2 films on the order of ∼20 μm.29
Optimization of the optical properties of the black dye through chemical modification is also not trivial given that three coordination sites are inherently occupied by the anchoring ligand and the remaining sites are occupied by NCS− ligands that had been deemed compulsory. A distinct advantage of the tridentate anchoring ligand, H3tctpy, is that the three –CO2H groups strongly bind the sensitizer to the semiconductor. Moreover, the protonation levels of these acid groups can be used to manipulate the energy of the ECB of the semiconducting surface and the π* orbital;84 indeed, the lower π* orbital of H3tctpy, relative to that of dcbpy, enables the sensitization of TiO2 beyond 800 nm. It has been recently discovered that replacement of the NCS− ligands can be done while maintaining high cell performance if the ligand is appropriately designed to: (i) enhance the light-harvesting properties; (ii) tune the HOMO energy; and (iii) accommodate dye regeneration.16,100 This section will focus on how cyclometalating ligands meet these criteria to render high-performance sensitizers.
5.2 Black dye analogues
The first report of a ruthenium cyclometalated sensitizer in the DSSC was provided by van Koten et al. in 2007 in the form of [Ru(ph-dcbpy)(tpy)]+ (ph-dcbpy = 6-phenyl-4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine; Fig. 12a).79 The HOMO and LUMO are localized on the metal–aryl fragment and anchoring ligand, respectively, thus enabling a modest PCE of 2.1% in the DSSC. This value was higher than any other Ru polypyridyl system lacking NCS¬ ligands at the time of the report, but the power output was, in part, constrained by the inherently low extinction coefficients. Exploiting the wealth of knowledge of Ru photochemistry,82 we have shown that the absorption properties of these dyes can be improved significantly by placing electron-donating groups (e.g., –OMe groups) on the anionic ring of C2-symmetric bis-tridentate Ru complexes where the anionic bond is positioned opposite the anchoring ligand (Fig. 12b).101 While the resultant donor-acceptor profile is beneficial, the HOMO energy level is negative in energy compared to the I¬/ I2¬˙ redox couple and is therefore not properly positioned for regeneration by I− in the DSSC. Ko et al. reported a series of cycloruthenated dyes (e.g., JK-206; Fig. 12e) bearing a single NCS− ligand that incorporate electron-withdrawing fluorine groups on the anionic ring to stabilize the HOMO level (i.e., the Ru(III)/Ru(II) redox couple resides at +0.99 V vs. NHE) to generate a PCE of 10.4% for JK-206.61 Chi, Chou and co-workers successfully developed a series of thiocyanate-free complexes using functionalized 2,6-bis(5-pyrazolyl)pyridine chelates (e.g., TF-2; Fig. 12d).16 These pyrazolyl ligands have again been substituted with strongly electron-withdrawing –CF3 groups to tune the electron-donating character of the dianionic ligands in order to maintain a sufficient driving force for dye regeneration by the electrolyte (the Ru(III)/Ru(II) redox couple lies at +0.95 V vs. NHE). A key advantage of this molecular framework is that it is completely devoid of the labile NCS− ligand and that it is readily modifiable at the 4′-position of the central pyridyl ring. Moreover, the ligands are weaker donors than those containing the anionic aryl rings; consequently, dye motif TF-2 was found to produce a PCE of 10.5% in the DSSC.

5.3 Bichromophoric dyes
The poor performance of bis-tridentate cyclometalated dyes (Fig. 12) prompted us to explore the effects of appending a secondary organic chromophore (Fig. 13). Our choice of secondary organic chromophore – a triphenylamine (TPA) group – was inspired by its use as the donor unit of metal-free chromophores that have been shown to produce high PCE values in the DSSC.103 The first organic dye bearing a TPA moiety was documented by Sun and Hagfeldt,104 while a successive iteration synthesized by Wang et al. reached the remarkable efficiency of 10.2% (Fig. 1).18 The attachment of a TPA unit to a metal scaffold has also been reported by several groups.105–107 These assemblies are capable of producing long-lived charge-separation on TiO2 after electron injection from a 3MLCT state into the semiconductor and subsequent reduction of the photo-oxidized metal by the adjacent TPA—a feature that could potentially lead to even higher efficiencies (e.g., Fig. 14).106,107 We positioned a thiophene spacer between the chelate and the TPA to alleviate any torsional strain between the adjacent six-membered rings and to further enhance the absorption envelope.102 This platform has provided a wealth of information vis-à-vis light-harvesting and charge-separation because the scaffold contains two redox-active units that can be independently modulated by substituents at the –R1 and/or –R2/R3 positions, which is summarized below.

 Fig. 14  Examples of TPA-functionalized Ru dyes.106–109 
We have successfully prepared a comprehensive library of bichromic bistridentate Ru complexes (e.g., Fig. 13) by exploiting a modular ligand synthetic strategy involving the coupling of a TPA-functionalized boronic-ester to halide-derivatized tridentate chelates following standard Suzuki methodologies (Fig. 15, Route A). The binding of the ensuing ligands to a Ru precursor follows standard procedures.77,100–102,110,111 In general, a tridentate cyclometalating ligand can be readily attached to a Ru(Me3tctpy)Cl3 (Me3tctpy = 4,4′,4′′-trimethoxycarbonyl-2,2′:;6′,2′′-terpyridine) synthon in a high dielectric constant solvent in the presence of base; the high dielectric constant is needed to facilitate the dissociation of the Cl− ligand from the coordination sphere.77 The increased hydrophobicity of the complex engendered by the TPA unit typically requires the addition of one equivalent of THF to the solvent; thus, a 5:1:1 MeOH:H2O:THF solvent combination enables the formation of the target bichromic sensitizers in yields up to 75%.
 Fig. 15  General synthetic scheme for the TPA ligand synthesis and complex formation. (a) NH4OAc, formamide, 120 °C, 14 h; (b) Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3, THF–H2O (9:1), 65 °C, 14 h; (c) MeOH–H2O–THF (5:1:1), N-ethylmorpholine, 65 °C, 14 h; (d) DMF–H2O–NEt3 (3:1:1), reflux, 14 h; (e) N-ethylmopholine, MeOH–H2O (5:1), reflux, 14 h; (f) Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3, DMF, 70 °C, 14 h. 
All of the cyclometalation reactions in this Perspective invariably involve a C–H activation step, which is usually easily achieved by reacting a Ru synthon (e.g., Ru(Me3tctpy)Cl3) in a high dielectric solvent (mixture) held at reflux for several hours. An exception to this protocol is a series where the TPA groups were functionalized with aliphatic chains, which rendered the ligand insoluble in such solvents systems.112 A higher ratio of THF was not a viable means of overcoming this issue because the lower solvent dielectric suppresses the lability of the Cl−-ligand, thus shunting the cyclometalation step. To overcome these obstacles, the TPA fragment furnished with a boronic ester was attached to a bistridentate Ru complex bearing a suitable group on the chelate (e.g., Br−) to enable functionalization by standard cross-coupling techniques (Fig. 15, Route B and C). This approach of using a coordinatively saturated metal complex as a synthon in cross-coupling reactions is far less common in the literature, but proved to be remarkably efficient and yielded the target compounds in 60–80% yield.112
A curious feature related to the C–H activation step was also observed within a certain set of bichromic complexes: EDGs and EWGs on the aryl ring (i.e., –R2 or –R3; Fig. 13) of the tridentate chelate led to different isomers (Fig. 13).113 For example, the cyclometalation of [Ru(Me3tctpy)Cl3] with 4-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-6-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (pbpy-CF3) led to the exclusive formation of the isomer with the –CF3 group positioned para to the organometallic bond (i.e., –R2; Fig. 13). Interestingly, the same reaction with 4-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-6-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (pbpy-OMe) led to the isomer where the –OMe group was positioned ortho to the Ru–C bond (i.e, –R3; Fig. 13). The latter observation was surprising because the isomer is sterically disfavored, yet even bulkier –OEt groups favored the same ortho isomer. These results indicate that electronic parameters play a prominent role in the C–H activation step. In the case of the –OMe derivatives, the ortho-substituted product is stabilized by ca. 50 mV relative to the para-substituted isomer. This rationalization does not, however, fully explain why derivatives containing -SEt groups, which are weak donors, also favor the ortho-substituted product (i.e., –R3; Fig. 13). We therefore postulated that the electronegativity of the X atom (X = O or S) in the Caryl–XEt bond was largely responsible for the regioselective C–H activation during the electrophilic metalation step (i.e., the electronegativity of the X atom helps stabilize the σ*C–X orbital, which, in turn, stabilizes the anionic charge on the adjacent C atom during the formation of the Ru–C bond). Further studies are underway to corroborate this effect.
The molecular asymmetry of the bichromic dyes dictates that the position of the organometallic bond relative to the TPA group must also be considered. Altering the position of the Ru–C bond about the primary coordination sphere results in a rearrangement of the frontier molecular orbitals, which can have a dramatic effect on the optical properties, and affect the specific position of the LUMO and HOMO about the molecule (Fig. 16).100,111 For example, if the central ring of the ligand is juxtaposed to the chelate bearing the TPA group (i.e., Z = C), then the LUMO will reside on the chelate away from the TiO2 surface, which is not conducive to electron injection; it is also synthetically more challenging to place anchoring groups on this chelate. If the TPA is bound to the aryl ring (i.e., X = C), then the intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) transitions emanating from the TPA group are hypsochromically shifted by >200 nm. Thus, the pbpy chelate (i.e., Y = C) shown in Fig. 13 is optimal because: (i) it displays superior light-harvesting throughout the visible region (Fig. 16 and 17a); and (ii) the LUMO is localized to the ligand anchored to the TiO2. (Note that having the pbpy on the opposite side of the molecule is a viable structure.61)

The solid and dashed lines correspond to the Ru(III)/Ru(II) and the TPA+/TPA0 redox couples, respectively. 
The rational design of effective bichromic sensitizers demands a favorable electronic gradient where electrons and holes can be shuttled to/from the TiO2 surface, respectively. The platform in Fig. 13 has proven to be very beneficial in this regard as the energy levels for the TPA˙+/TPA0 and Ru(III)/Ru(II) redox couples can be adjusted through substitution at –R1 or –R2/R3, respectively. For example, the replacement of –H with –OMe groups at –R1 lowers the TPA˙+/TPA0 redox couple from +1.20 to +0.99 V, while the Ru(III)/Ru(II) potential can be modulated over a range of +1.10 to +1.27 V by substitution of the anionic ring of the pbpy chelate with –OMe and –CF3, respectively.100,111 Transient absorption spectroscopy experiments have verified that the appropriate energy gradient between the Ru and TPA chromophores can be designed to achieve the desired hole-transfer (e.g., 8, Fig. 13); however, it remains to be confirmed whether this process translates to charge recombination and, in turn, higher device performance. Another convenient outcome of these systems is that these manipulations have little effect on the optical properties enabling the discrimination of how the frontier energy levels affect device performance.
The PV performance parameters of select bichromic dyes were very promising in that high efficiencies were observed for a bistridentate scaffold devoid of NCS− ligands. At 1 Sun, 7 displayed a JSC of 14.95 mA cm−2, VOC of 672 mV, and FF of 0.71 to yield a PCE of 7.13%. Under similar conditions, 8 generated an even higher PCE of 8.02% (JSC = 16.78 mA cm−2; VOC = 682 mV; FF = 0.71). As a reference point, cells with N3 were characterized by the following parameters: JSC = 16.48 mA cm−2, VOC = 713 mV, FF = 0.74, and PCE = 8.65%. The photocurrent action spectrum for 8 shows the panchromatic current that these bichromic bis-tridentate cyclometalated Ru(II) sensitizers can generate; e.g., the IPCE response beyond 900 nm is ∼200 nm further into the infrared region than that obtained for N3.100 The high PCEs of 7 and 8 lend credence to the strategy of utilizing bichromic cyclometalated sensitizers. It should also be noted that the PCE of 7 and 8 in the DSSC was far better than dyes containing aryl rings at the other positions about the Ru coordination sphere.
6. Conclusions
Many new benchmarks for the DSSC have been recently established, including a thiocyanate-free Ru champion dye,24 a metal-free champion dye,18 a high performance DSSC with Co-based electrolytes,96 and the first DSSC with a PCE in excess of 13%!15 Each one of these breakthroughs deviates from the N3 scaffold, which has served as the paradigm for the field over the past two decades. This Perspective details the recent advances in cycloruthenated dyes, which hold enormous potential for further improving the performance standards of the DSSC. Cyclometalating ligands offer access to a wide range of ground- and excited state redox potentials that enable acute control of the optical properties and the driving force for both electron-injection and dye regeneration. While remarkably high PCE values have already been demonstrated with these dyes,17,24,100 we are optimistic that the best is to come for this class of dyes in view of the fact they can be tailored to better interact with non-conventional electrolyte species.17 This feature provides the unique opportunity to bypass the corrosive iodide-based electrolyte and provides an avenue for enhancing the VOC and stability of the DSSC, thus bringing the DSSC one major step closer to large-scale commercialization.

 	Fig. 1  DSSC dyes that have been documented to produce a PCE > 10% in the DSSC. The paradigmatic N3 dye is highlighted by the enclosure. Sample codes correspond to those used in the original reports.14–31 (aDoubly deprotonated form of N3; bA proton replaced by Na+ cation; cProtons are replaced by Na+ and NBu4+ cations.)	 

 	Fig. 2  Summary of select absorption/emission events and charge transfer/transport processes in the DSSC:2,4,39 (I) light-induced excitation; (II) electron-transfer from the photoexcited dye into semiconductor; (III) electron-transport to conducting glass through mesoporous film; (IV) reduction of electrolyte redox species; (V) regeneration of the oxidized dye by the electrolyte species (vide infra); (VI) radiative or non-radiative decay of the photo-excited electron (note that photophysical events such as intersystem crossing are not depicted here for the sake of brevity); (VII) reduction of photo-oxidized dye by electron in Ecb of semiconductor; (VIII) interception of electron in Ecb of semiconductor by electrolyte species (a significant deleterious pathway in the DSSC); and (IX) reduction of electrolyte species by photo-excited dye. Processes I–V (blue arrows) should ideally be kinetically favoured over the recombination processes VI–IX (red arrows).	 

 	Fig. 3  Representative cycloruthenated complexes in the literature: (a) [Ru(bpy)2(ppy)]+;48,49 (b) [Ru(tpy)(pbpy)]+;50 (c) [Ru(tpy)(dpb)]+ (dpb = 1,3-di(pyridin-2-yl)benzene);65 (d) [(tpy)Ru(tpb)Ru(tpy)]2+ (tpb = 3,3′,5,5′-tetra(pyridin-2-yl)benzene);60 (d) [Ru(dqp)(dqb)]+ (dqp = 2,6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine; dqb = 1,3-di(quinolin-8-yl)benzene).56	 

 	Fig. 4  
Top: UV-vis spectra of N3, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Ru(bpy)2(ppy)]+ in MeCN. Bottom: A simplified illustration of relevant ground- and excited state redox potentials for dyes N3, [Ru(dcbpy)3]2+ and [Ru(dcbpy)2(ppy)]+ (1) to illustrate how the anionic ligands affect the electronic structure.	 

 	Fig. 5  Optimization of Ru-based dyes for the DSSC. Substitution at –R1 can improve light absorption and suppress deleterious interactions between TiO2 and H2O/electrolyte. Modification of –R2 improves light harvesting through an extended π-system while modulating the energy of the HOMO, representing a comparative advantage in view of the difficulty in chemically modifying the NCS− groups.80	 

 	Fig. 6  Synthetic protocol for dyes of general formula [Ru(dcbpy)2(C^N)]+.511H NMR spectroscopy shows evidence for two MeCN groups bound to the metal in the intermediate containing the cymene. The hapticity of the cymene in the intermediate is likely η4 in order to furnish an 18e− complex.	 

 	Fig. 7  Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of [Ru(dcbpy)2(ppy-4-(2-thiophene-5-carbaldehyde)]+ (2) illustrating the expanded delocalization of the HOMO onto the conjugated substituent of the ppy− ligand. Atom labels: Ru – pink; C – gray; N – blue; O – red; S – yellow; H – omitted.	 

 	Fig. 8  Listing of representative trisheteroleptic cycloruthenated sensitizers: [Ru(bpy)(dcbpy)(ppy)]+ (3), [Ru(bpy)(dcbpy)(ppy-F2)]+ (4) and [Ru(bpy)(dcbpy)(ppy-4-(2-thiophene-5-carbaldehyde)]+ (5) and [Ru(dthbpy)(dcbpy)(ppy-(CF3)2)] (ppy-(CF3)2 = 2-(2,4-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)pyridine) (6).	 

 	Fig. 9  Synthetic protocol for trisheteroleptic sensitizers.	 

 	Fig. 10  (A) UV-vis spectra collected in MeOH at ambient temperature and (B) I–V traces for select trisheteroleptic cycloruthenated sensitizers 3, 4, 5, 6 and N3 achieving PCEs of 2.4%, 2.4%, 4.0%, 7.3% and 6.3% respectively.17,85
