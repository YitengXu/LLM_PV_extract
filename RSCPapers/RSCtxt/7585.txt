    , Accepted 14th January 2014First published on 14th January 2014AbstractPlatinum (Pt)-based catalysts used in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) usually suffer from low catalytic activity, slow kinetics of methanol oxidation and poor electrochemical stability. This is mainly due to the toxic effect of carbon monoxide and inefficient use of the Pt catalysts. To address these problems, we immobilized Pt nanoparticles with diameters of 4–6 nm onto the three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating graphene networks (graphene hydrogel or G-Gel) deposited in the micropores of nickel foam (NF). In this Pt/G-Gel/NF composite catalyst, nearly all the Pt nanoparticles are accessible to methanol and can be efficiently used for electrocatalyzation. It showed excellent electrochemical stability and an activity 2.6 times that of a conventional Pt/reduced graphene oxide (Pt/rGO) composite catalyst. Furthermore, the rate of methanol electro-oxidation at the Pt/G-Gel/NF catalyst can be about 27 times that at the Pt/rGO catalyst, making it applicable for fabricating DMFCs with high current and/or power outputs.
1. Introduction
DMFCs have attracted a great deal of attention because of their light weights, eco-friendliness, high energy-conversion efficiencies and power densities, low operating temperatures, and simple handling and processing.1–4 However, several issues including the methanol crossover effect, low methanol electro-oxidation kinetics and the adverse effects of intermediate species are the critical obstacles for their practical applications. A promising strategy to address these problems is to develop new electrocatalysts with strong poison tolerance, high catalytic activity and efficiency on methanol oxidation. Pt is the most widely used effective catalyst for this purpose.5–7 However, the performances of Pt-based catalysts depend strongly on their preparation conditions, supporting materials, additives and pretreatment processes.1,8–16 Many carbon materials such as Vulcan XC-7 carbon,17,18 carbon nanotubes,19–21 carbon nanofibers,22 and mesoporous carbons23,24 have been used as the supports of Pt catalysts. Recently, graphene materials have also been widely explored to immobilize Pt catalysts because of their unique atom-thick two-dimensional structures, high specific surface areas, large surface to volume ratios, superior electrical conductivities, and good mechanical and electrochemical stabilities.25–31 The combination of Pt nanoparticles and graphene sheets opens up new possibilities for designing the next generation of catalysts.4 Among graphene materials, rGO can be prepared on a large scale and at low cost by chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO). Thus, it is an attractive carbon material for loading Pt catalysts. However, most Pt/rGO composite catalysts were modified on the surfaces of carbon electrodes as compact films for catalyzing methanol oxidation.2,5,7,32–36 In these cases, polymer binders and conductive additives were frequently applied to form mechanically stable and electrically conductive catalytic electrodes. As a result, the Pt nanoparticles cannot be efficiently used and for the most part only the Pt nanoparticles on the surfaces of composite films are accessible for electrocatalyzation. Furthermore, the small surface areas of the electrodes also limit the reaction rates and efficiencies of methanol oxidation.
On the other hand, graphene hydrogels and their composites have been widely used in energy related systems such as supercapacitors, lithium batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells and hydrogen production.37–42 Here, we report a Pt-based catalyst prepared by immobilizing Pt nanoparticles on the graphene hydrogel (G-Gel) deposited in the micropores of nickel foam (NF). In this catalyst, nearly all the Pt nanoparticles are accessible to methanol molecules even in a thick electrode (about 1.6 mm) because of the interconnected porous structure of G-Gel. Furthermore, a thick G-Gel was separated into small pieces on the micrometer scale and each of them was surrounded by Ni framework. Thus, the distances of transporting methanol molecules, ions and electrons in the electrodes were greatly shortened. The Pt/G-Gel/NF composite film can be directly used as a catalytic electrode without using any binder, conductive additive and additional current collector. As a result, this catalyst showed strong catalytic activity, high efficiency and improved electrochemical tolerance, making it suitable for practical applications in DMFCs with high current and/or power outputs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of GO
GO was synthesized by the oxidation of natural graphite powder (325 mesh, Qingdao Huatai Lubricant Sealing S&T Co. Ltd, Qingdao, China) according to an improved Hummers' method.43 Briefly, graphite powder (3.0 g) was added to concentrated H2SO4 (70 mL) under stirring in an ice bath. Under vigorous agitation, KMnO4 (9.0 g) was added slowly to keep the temperature of the suspension lower than 20 °C. Subsequently, the reaction system was transferred to a 40 °C oil bath and vigorously stirred for about 0.5 h. Then 150 mL water was added, and the solution was stirred for 15 min at 95 °C. An additional 500 mL water was added and this was followed by a slow addition of 15 mL H2O2 (30%), turning the colour of the solution from dark brown to yellow. The mixture was filtered and washed with 1:10 HCl aqueous solution (250 mL) to remove metal ions. The resulting solid was dried in air and diluted to 600 mL, making a graphite oxide aqueous dispersion. Finally, it was purified by dialysis for one week using a dialysis membrane with a molar mass cut off of 8000 to 14000 g mol−1 to remove the remaining metal species. The resultant graphite oxide aqueous dispersion was then diluted to 1.2 L, stirred overnight and sonicated for 30 min to exfoliate it to GO. The GO dispersion was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 40 min to remove the unexfoliated graphite.
2.2 Preparation of the Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts
3 mL aqueous dispersion of GO (4 mg mL−1) and 3 mL aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) with a certain concentration (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 mg mL−1) were mixed to form a homogeneous suspension. The concentration of H2PtCl6 solution was used to modulate the Pt loadings, and the resulting composite films are named as Pt/G-Gel/NF-n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively). Then, NF sheets (1.5 cm × 1 cm × 0.16 cm, mass per unit area = 42 mg cm−2, Changsha Lyrun New Material Co. Ltd, Changsha, China) were immersed in the above GO/H2PtCl6 suspension. Subsequently, the system was stirred by using a vortex mixer (Vortex-5, Qilinbeier Apparatus Co., China) until the NFs sank, followed by sonication for 10 min to ensure the successful filling of the GO/H2PtCl6 suspension into the micropores of the NFs. The NFs containing GO/H2PtCl6 suspensions were transferred to plastic tubes (diameter 1.3 cm) containing 3 mL of 10 mg mL−1 vitamin C (VC) (99.7%, Beijing AoBoXing Bio-tech Co. Ltd, Beijing, China). The reaction system was kept undisturbed for 1 h and subsequently heated at 60 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the Pt/G-Gel/NF composite films were repeatedly rinsed with de-ionized (DI) water for use.
2.3 Preparation of the Pt/G-Gel
The removal of the NF from a Pt/G-Gel/NF composite film was performed by immersing it in the aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (6 mol L−1) at 80 °C for 4 h and subsequently at room temperature for 48 h. Finally, the released Pt/G-Gel was rinsed with de-ionized (DI) water to remove residual acid. The Pt/G-Gel composite was dried under vacuum at 100 °C overnight for measuring its solid content, and for morphological and spectral studies.
2.4 Preparation of the Pt/rGO catalysts
Pt/rGO composite catalysts were prepared through a conventional chemical reduction approach. A GO/H2PtCl6 suspension made by mixing 3 mL of 4 mg mL−1 GO and 3 mL of 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 mg mL−1 H2PtCl6 was diluted to 50 mL with DI water. Then 3 mL of 10 mg mL−1 VC was added into the solution and then heated at 60 °C under stirring for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, Pt/rGO composite catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washing and drying under vacuum at 100 °C overnight. For electrochemical study, 1 mg of Pt/rGO catalyst was put into 1 mL ethanol and sonicated to form a stable dispersion, and 5 μL of this ink was dropped onto the surface of a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (3 mm in diameter) and dried at room temperature. Finally, 5 μL of Nafion (0.5 wt%) solution was cast on the surface of the catalyst-modified GC electrode and dried before electrochemical experiments. The GC electrode had been pretreated by polishing with chamois leather containing Al2O3 slurry (Al2O3 particle diameter 500 nm and 50 nm, concentration 70–90 mg mL−1, Tianjin AiDaHengSheng Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) followed by repeatedly washing with ethanol and DI water.
2.5 Instruments
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were acquired with a Hitachi H-7650B TEM at 80 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were recorded by using a Tecnai TF20 HRTEM (FEI, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken using a Sirion 200 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI, Tokyo, Japan). X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured with the use of a D8 Advance X-Ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, Bruker, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Pt loadings (mPts) of the catalysts were measured by the use of an inductive coupled high frequency plasma spectrometer (ICP, Vista-MPX). The size distribution of Pt nanoparticles was surveyed by using the software Nano Measurer, edition 1.2.
2.6 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical properties of the catalysts were studied by the use of a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX). A Pt/G-Gel/NF film, a Pt foil or a Pt/rGO/GC electrode was used as the working electrode. A Pt foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All measurements were performed at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. NF is electrochemically unstable in acidic media; thus, the electrochemical studies were carried out in an alkaline medium of 0.5 M KOH. Furthermore, Pt is known to have a higher CO tolerance in alkaline media than in an acidic environment.44 The resistances of the electrodes were measured by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The EIS spectra were recorded at frequencies in the range of 105 to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of modulation voltage of 10 mV. The chronoamperometry tests were conducted in a 1 M CH3OH + 0.5 M KOH solution at −0.3 V for a period of 1 h.
2.7 Electrochemically active surface areas (ESAs) of Pt nanoparticles in the catalysts
A Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 composite film was put into 10 mL DI water and the pH value of water was adjusted to 10 with 1 M NaOH. Then, a NaBH4 solution (10 mL of 2.0 mg mL−1) was added dropwise into the suspension and kept at room temperature for 12 h to fully reduce Pt species. The reduced sample was repeatedly washed with DI water for use. A Pt/rGO catalyst was also treated through the same procedures for comparison. The ESAs of catalysts were measured by CO adsorption. The stripping of adsorbed CO was performed in a CO saturated 0.5 M KOH solution by cyclic voltammetric scanning in the potential range of −1.04 to 0.4 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1.44
3. Results and discussion
Free-standing Pt/G-Gel/NF films can be obtained in arbitrary shapes and sizes according to those of the NF (Fig. 1a). The films obtained from the H2PtCl6 solutions with different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 mg mL−1) are nominated as Pt/G-Gel/NF-n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6; see Experimental section). Here, we take Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 as an example for morphological and structural studies. The cross-sectional SEM images of a freeze-dried Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 film (Fig. 1b and c) indicates that the Pt/G-Gel composite was filled in the micropores of the NF and surrounded by the framework of the NF (Fig. S1, ESI†). The TEM images of the Pt/G-Gel composite sheets released from Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 show that the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the graphene sheets (Fig. 1d and e). The HRTEM image of a Pt nanoparticle demonstrates a face-centered cubic (fcc) (111) lattice structure and the lattice spacing was measured to be 0.23 nm (Fig. 1e and its inset). All the Pt nanoparticles were considered to be spherical and their diameters were evaluated using Nano Measurer software to be in the range of 4 to 6 nm (Fig. 1f). EDX spectral examination reflects that the Pt/G-Gel composite has C, O and Pt elements, while its Ni content is undetectable (Fig. S2, ESI†). In the catalysts of Pt/G-Gel/NF-n, where n = 1 to 4, Pt nanoparticles showed uniform distributions (Fig. 2a to d). However, when an H2PtCl6 solution with higher concentration (e.g. 25 or 30 mg mL−1, n = 5 or 6) was used as one of the starting materials, Pt nanoparticles were partly aggregated because of their high number density (Fig. 2e or f). The uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles on graphene sheets was mainly due to the unique 3D structure of the Pt/G-Gel/NF film and the properties of the graphene sheets. The high specific surface areas of rGO sheets and 3D microporous channels provide a large space for immobilizing Pt nanoparticles. Furthermore, the residual oxygen functionalities of rGO sheets also play a key role for anchoring Pt nanoparticles onto the graphene sheets.

Fig. 3a is a typical XRD pattern of the Pt/G-Gel composite sheets released from Pt/G-Gel/NF-4. The broad diffraction peak at around 2θ = 23.3° can be indexed to the (002) reflection of the carbon hexagonal structure, implying the composite has few-layer graphene sheets. The peaks at 2θ = 39.9°, 46.5° and 67.5° are assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes (JCPDS 87-0646) of fcc Pt nanocrystals, respectively. The lattice space of fcc (111) was calculated to be 0.23 nm according to its XRD peak position, and this value is in good agreement with the HRTEM result (Fig. 1e) and those of the Pt/graphene composites reported previously.2,45

Fig. 3b and c illustrate the C 1s and Pt 4f XPS spectra of the Pt/G-Gel composite sheets obtained from Pt/G-Gel/NF-4. The C 1s spectrum shows that the composite sheets have 4 types of carbons (Fig. 3b): C–C (284.8 eV), C–O (286.0 eV), CO (287.8 eV) and O–CO (289.0 eV).45,46 The atomic ratio of intact (CC/C–C) and oxygenated carbons were calculated to be 5.87. This value is much higher than that of GO (2.47), indicating the oxygenated groups of GO have been partially removed by chemical reduction with VC to form conductive rGO. The residual oxygenated groups acted as the active sites for attaching Pt atoms to facilitate the uniform loading of Pt nanoparticles on the surfaces of rGO sheets.2,44 The reduction of GO has also been confirmed by Raman spectroscopic studies (Fig. S3, ESI†). The Raman spectra of GO or Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 have two prominent bands around 1351 and 1590 cm−1, and they are assigned to the D and G bands of carbon, respectively. The G band is related to graphitic carbon and the D band is associated with the structural defects or partially disordered structures of graphitic domains. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) for GO was calculated to be 0.91, while that of Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 was measured to be 1.28. This result indicates that the oxidized areas of the GO sheets were partly restored upon reduction, forming small conjugated domains.47 The Pt 4f XPS spectrum of Pt/G-Gel composite sheets has two pairs of doublet peaks (Fig. 3c): the predominate doublet (71.6 and 74.9 eV) is associated with metallic Pt; the weaker doublet (72.7 and 76.0 eV) can be assigned to Pt(II) species (such as PtO and Pt(OH)2).1,48 The atomic ratio of Pt and Pt2+ species was calculated to be 3.50, indicating that the Pt in the composite catalyst is predominately metallic, which can provide more suitable sites for methanol decomposition than the Pt2+ species.36,45
The Pt/G-Gel/NF composite films have been directly used as the electrocatalytic electrodes for methanol oxidation without blending with any binders and conductive additives or using additional current collectors. For comparison, a Pt foil and a glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with a Pt/rGO composite catalyst prepared via chemical reduction and stabilized by a Nafion binder were also studied under the same conditions. To evaluate the activity of the catalysts toward the methanol electro-oxidation, CVs of Pt/G-Gel/NF, Pt and Pt/rGO/GC electrodes were carried out in a 1 M CH3OH + 0.5 M KOH solution at 50 mV s−1. The related electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, each CV of the Pt/G-Gel/NF electrodes has a forward anodic wave of methanol oxidation and a backward anodic wave related to the oxidation of intermediates such as carbon monoxide. The forward anodic peak current density (If) of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts gradually increases with the loading of Pt nanoparticles (mPt). Particularly, the If of Pt/G-Gel/NF-5 was measured to be as high as 139.0 mA cm−2, nearly 27 times that of Pt/rGO catalyst (If = 5.2 mA cm−2). It should be noted here, the electrocatalytic activity of our Pt/rGO catalyst was comparable to those of the counterparts reported in literature (If = 6.0 mA cm−2).2,7 On the other hand, a Pt foil has also been used as the catalytic electrode and its CV showed a weak If of 1.6 mA cm−2. These results demonstrate that the rate of methanol electro-oxidation at the Pt/G-Gel/NF-5 catalyst is 27 and 86 times those at Pt/rGO/GC and Pt electrodes, respectively. This finding implies that our catalysts can be used to resolve the problem of slow kinetics of electro-oxidation of methanol, being suitable for the applications in DMFCs with high current and/or power outputs.

The onset potentials of faradaic currents (Eonset) at the Pt/G-Gel/NF electrodes, the tangent intersections of base lines and forward anodic waves, are in the range of −0.42 to −0.45 V (Table 1). These values are close to that at Pt (−0.40 V) or Pt/rGO/GC (−0.43 V) electrodes. The forward anodic CV waves of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts are more sluggish and their peak potentials (Ep) were higher than that of Pt/rGO. These phenomena are mainly due to the 3D microporous structures of the former catalysts provided a wide distribution of catalytic sites with different mass and charge transferring distances.49 The Ep in the CVs of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts positively shifted with the increase in their mPt, while the peak potentials of backward anodic waves remained nearly unchanged. This is mainly due to the dramatic increase of If resulting in increasing the IfR drops of the electrodes, where R is the resistance of the electrode (R = 4.8 ± 0.5 Ω, Table 1) measured by EIS (Fig. S4, ESI†). The small changes in backward anodic peak current density (Ib) led to a negligible potential shift of the backward anodic waves, indicating the increase of mPt selectively accelerated the electro-oxidation of methanol and improved the stability of the catalyst.
To compare the efficiencies of different Pt-based catalysts, the plots of Ifversus mPt are shown in Fig. 4c and d. If increases linearly with mPt from 54.5 mA cm−2 for Pt/G-Gel/NF-1 with a mPt of 104.9 μg cm−2 to 105.8 mA cm−2 for Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 with a mPt of 219.7 μg cm−2 (Fig. 4c). The If for Pt/G-Gel/NF-5 showed a little distortion from linearity, possibly due to the slight aggregation of nanoparticles. A further increase of mPt caused a dramatic decrease of If (Fig. S5, ESI†). The electrocatalytic activity of a Pt catalyst can be evaluated by the ratio (rc) of If and mPt, and the rcs of Pt/G-Gel/NF-n (where n = 1 to 5) were calculated to be as high as 481 ± 5 mA mg−1. These results indicated that the electrocatalytic activities of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts have not been influenced by their mPt in the scale of 100 to 300 μg cm−2. In comparison, the If of conventional Pt/rGO/GC electrodes increases linearly with mpt initially and it was saturated at around 30 μg cm−2 (Fig. 4d), and this value is one order of magnitude lower than that of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts (Fig. 4c). The rc of Pt/rGO/GC electrode was calculated to be only 183 ± 2 mA mg−1. These findings reflect that the catalytic efficiencies of the Pt nanoparticles in Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts are much superior to that of the traditional Pt/rGO catalysts even at a high mPt of around 300 μg cm−2.
For methanol oxidation, the current ratio of If to Ib is an important index that can be used to evaluate the poison tolerance of a Pt-based catalyst. As shown in Table 1, the If/Ib for Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts increases with mPt. The If/Ib of Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 was measured to be the highest and calculated to be about 18.2. This value is about 2.8 times that of the Pt/rGO catalyst (If/Ib = 6.5), indicating a stronger tolerance toward CO.50 However, the Pt/G-Gel/NF-5 catalyst showed a higher value of Ib (9.3 mA cm−2) and a lower If/Ib of 14.9, also possibly due the slight aggregation of Pt nanoparticles in this catalyst. The higher If/Ib ratios for the Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts than that for the Pt/rGO catalyst can be explained as follows. The much larger loading and more efficient use of the Pt nanoparticles in Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts allowed methanol to be oxidized more completely and the side reaction to form CO was strongly reduced. As a result, If increased dramatically, while Ib remained nearly unchanged with the increase of mPt.

Fig. 4e and f illustrate the chronoamperometric curves of different catalytic electrodes in 1 M CH3OH + 0.5 M KOH at −0.3 V. The polarization currents at these electrodes decreased rapidly during the initial stage, mainly due to the formation of intermediate species during methanol oxidation. However, the current density of Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 became stable to 3600 s, indicating its excellent electrochemical stability. Actually, the Pt nanoparticles in this catalyst kept their original morphology after a long-term methanol oxidation (Fig. S6, ESI†). In comparison, the current densities at the Pt foil and Pt/rGO/GC electrodes decrease dramatically during the same period (Fig. 4f). The stability of catalysts in the electrochemical processes is crucial for their commercial applications and also is a vital standard to evaluate the performances of DMFCs.
The high performances of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts are mainly due to the graphene hydrogel providing a porous network for supporting Pt nanoparticles and making nearly all the nanoparticles accessible to catalyze the electro-oxidation of methanol actively and efficiently. A pristine NF or a pure G-Gel/NF composite film did not show any electrocatalytic activity (Fig. S7, ESI†), indicating that the Pt/G-Gel composite encapsulated in the NF is responsible to the electrocatalytic activity of a Pt/G-Gel/NF composite electrode. The ESA of Pt nanoparticles in Pt/G-Gel/NF-4 was measured to be about 150.3 m2 g−1 by CV stripping of adsorbed CO (Fig. S8, ESI†). This value is 4.2 times that of Pt/rGO catalyst (35.9 m2 g−1). Furthermore, the framework of NF separated the 1.6 mm thick Pt/G-Gel into small sizes of micrometers, greatly shortening the transport distances of ion/electrons during electrochemical processes. The uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles at an extremely large mPt on the interpenetrating graphene networks of G-Gel also greatly and selectively accelerated the electro-oxidation of methanol and improved the electrochemical stability of the catalyst.
4. Conclusions
A one-step, mass-producible and eco-friendly method has been developed to prepare Pt/G-Gel/NF composite electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation in alkaline solution. The catalyst electrode can be prepared without any binders or additives, and produced in arbitrary sizes and shapes. The composite catalysts showed a high electrochemical activity of 481 mA mg−1, nearly 2.6 times that (183 mA mg−1) of conventional Pt/rGO composite catalyst measured under the same conditions. The strong activity of these catalysts can be kept even as their mPt increased up to about 300 μg cm−2, while a conventional Pt/rGO catalyst showed its highest activity at a small mPt around 30 μg cm−2. More importantly, the high activity and the extremely large mPt of Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts greatly increased their electrochemical stability and the kinetics of methanol electro-oxidation. The mPt of the Pt/G-Gel/NF catalysts can be further increased without decreasing their performances just by increasing the thickness of the NF, making them promising for applications in real DMFCs.
