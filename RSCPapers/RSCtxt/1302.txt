This single shuttle led to a large enhancement of the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) to ∼940 mV relative to that of conventional iodine-based shuttle and greatly increased the efficiency of the solar-to-electric energy conversion at lower illumination levels by a factor of ca. 5.6.
Inorganic ruthenium complexes have been intensively studied due partly to academic curiosity about their electrochemical natures1–5 and partly to their possible uses as photoelectron sources in photocatalysis6–10 and photovoltaics.11–19 These complexes could possibly be utilized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), which are electrochemical photovoltaic devices that are mainly composed of nanoporous semiconductors, chromophores, and redox shuttles. In fact, various ruthenium complexes have been examined as light harvesters in DSCs.12 These DSCs have exhibited a comparable or better solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) than high-tech silicon-based solar cells and thus have shown considerable promise as alternatives to these silicon-based technologies. For instance, N719, a ruthenium-based inorganic complex chromophore, has exhibited a PCE greater than 11%.13
The major role of redox shuttle is to reduce and thereby regenerate the oxidized chromophores by delivering electrons from the counter electrode. Another important role of the shuttle is its contribution to generating the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), which is the main factor for gauging the PCE. For more than two dozen years, the place for the shuttle has been thought to be “reserved” by the iodine/iodide couple. Recently, researchers have begun searching for new redox shuttles to attain higher photovoltages, thereby enhancing the PCE. As a result, several shuttles such as cobalt-,20–26 iron-,21,27–29 copper-,21,22,30,31 nickel-,32 sulfide-,33–35 and thiocyanate-based shuttles36 have been discovered. Obviously, these shuttles have enhanced the photovoltage. A cobalt-based shuttle, in particular, resulted in the development of state-of-art DSCs with a PCE greater than 12%.20 Nevertheless, all the shuttles, whether serendipitously discovered, or rationally designed, are commonly a “paired form”, that is formed by the coupling of reduced and oxidized components. For example, iodide (reduced form) in an iodine/iodide shuttle is coupled with triiodide, the oxidized form of iodide. Here, we report a new “single-component redox shuttle” that consists of a primitive version of a ruthenium complex: tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) [Ru(bpy)32+]. This complex is a counter part of the oxidized form, Ru(bpy)33+, as a half component of a complete set of the shuttle. The Ru(bpy)33+ can be readily produced from Ru(bpy)32+, using strong oxidants, such as NOBF4,37 but it has proven difficult to treat it under ambient conditions due to its rapid reduction to Ru(bpy)32+ (see the ESI,† Sections S1 and S2).38–44 Also, we have observed that the addition of Ru(bpy)33+ into the Ru(bpy)32+ electrolyte led to a substantial decrease in both the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) and the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) (see ESI,† Section S3). As described below, however, we find that, although it operates solely without its oxidized pair, this new single shuttle possesses a high open-circuit voltage (ca. 950 mV). Notably, this single shuttle boosts the conversion efficiencies under a lower power illumination level (i.e., 10 mW cm−2) by a factor of ca. 5.6. More interesting is that ruthenium complexes, to the best of our knowledge, have rarely been considered for use as redox shuttles, even though they have been broadly investigated for use as chromophores in DSCs.37,45
One unique feature of ruthenium complexes is their “self-exchange” of electrons. Meyer and colleagues revealed that Ru(bpy)32+ complexes intermolecularly exchange their electrons (outer-sphere electron-transfer) even in the solution phase.1 On the basis of this fact, we tested a ruthenium complex to utilize it as a “single-component redox shuttle”. The electrolyte solution was simply prepared by dissolving Ru(bpy)3·2PF6 and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile (ESI,† Section S1). Essentially, for a DSC to properly function, the redox potential of a shuttle should be higher than the potential of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a chromophore. To determine the redox potential of Ru(bpy)32+ and to eventually find a suitable chromophore that is compatible with this ruthenium shuttle, we employed cyclic voltammetry and simulated the electronic structure of Ru(bpy)32+ using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see the results in the ESI,† Sections S4 and S5). The resulting redox potential of the ruthenium complex agreed well with the value reported in the literature.46 Given the aforementioned results, we chose the JK2 dye because its quasi-HOMO potential is lower than that of the Ru(bpy)32+ shuttle (Fig. 1 and ESI,† Section S4). With this combination, we optimized the cell performance by varying the thickness of the TiO2 photoelectrode and the concentration of the Ru(bpy)32+ electrolyte. Using cells composed of a 2.4 μm-thick TiO2 film and 8 mM (maximum concentration) Ru(bpy)32+ electrolyte, we obtained a VOC of 940 mV and a JSC of 1.41 mA cm−2 (see Fig. 2 and ESI,† Sections S7 and S8).

Obviously, the ruthenium shuttle significantly enhanced the VOC (note that typical iodine/iodide cells exhibit VOC values of ca. 700 mV).14 We attributed this enhancement to the substantially lower redox potential of the ruthenium complex {ca. 1.58 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE); compare this value to the redox potential of I−/I3−, which is 0.35–0.93 V}.15 The JSC values, however, were quite low compared to those of typical I−/I3− cells. We hypothesized that the slow dye-regeneration led to this low current generation. (We note that “dye-regeneration” here means all the expansive processes for the reduction of the oxidized dye, i.e., electron-transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the oxidized dye, mass-transfer of both Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)33+ – the latter is initially absent but transiently formed after donating electrons to the oxidized dye, and the regeneration of Ru(bpy)32+ from Ru(bpy)33+ at the counter electrode.) To confirm this hypothesis, we examined three factors that can influence the dye-regeneration: (i) the electrolyte concentration, (ii) the distance between the dye (in the photoanode) and the counter electrode, and (iii) the intrinsic mass-transfer rate. (We note that, in particular, the latter two factors are mainly governed by transiently formed Ru(bpy)33+.) Firstly, as previously discussed, we observed that a higher electrolyte concentration resulted in a higher current generation (see Section S7 of the ESI†). However, we also noted that 8 mM was the maximum concentration of the ruthenium complex in acetonitrile. Secondly, we intentionally designed cells in which the cross-sectional electrolyte gap interval was rationally modulated from 25 to 175 μm (see the ESI,† Section S9). As expected, the JSCs decreased as the interval increased. Given that the typical I−/I3− cells did not exhibit this pattern (see the ESI,† Section S10), we tentatively ascribed this current decrease to a slow dye-regeneration resulting from a longer delivery distance. Lastly, smaller nanopores in the TiO2 electrode can conceivably lead to slower mass-transfer rates relative to larger nanopores. To corroborate this hypothesis, we synthesized smaller TiO2 nanoparticles (with an average size of ca. 10 nm) and used them to fabricate electrodes (see the ESI,† Sections S1 and S11).16 As also expected, the smaller pores afforded a lower current density compared to that afforded by the larger pores. Accordingly, we reasoned that the low photocurrent output was due to the overall slow dye-regeneration process of this ruthenium electrolyte. In addition, we speculate that the transiently formed Ru(bpy)33+ can also limit the current density due to its slow diffusion to the counter electrode.47–49
Meanwhile, we consistently observed sizable peak currents when turning on the illuminating light (AM 1.5-simulated one Sun). See Fig. 3. These observations indicate that the instantaneous peak current is always over a critical current saturation point and that the continuous current has already reached its attainable maximum under the simulated 1 Sun. We assumed that this current saturation is attributable to the limited electron-delivery capacity of 8 mM Ru(bpy)32+ and transiently formed minuscule Ru(bpy)33+, which can limit dye regeneration.48,49 To confirm this assumption, an experiment was designed to determine the critical (lowest) light power that could induce current saturation, because the number of instantaneously incident photons is strongly associated with the number of instantaneously oxidized dye molecules that lose photoelectrons upon injection but are not yet regenerated by the shuttles, and the number of instantaneously injected photoelectrons is closely correlated with the peak current. The determination of the critical light power was achieved by testing the chronoamperometric current changes upon the power of the illuminating light from 0 (dark) to 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3). While the peak current was substantially reduced as the illumination intensity was decreased, the reduction of the continuous current was not as significant. For instance, even though the illumination power was decreased by a factor of 10, the continuous current density at 10 mW cm−2 (0.75 mA cm−2) was only half that at 100 mW cm−2 (1.44 mA cm−2). Also, the magnitude of the peak current at 10 mW cm−2 (0.22 mA cm−2) was substantially low relative to those over the other illumination ranges (0.72–1.35 mA cm−2). In view of these results, we speculated that the critical illumination power for continuous dye regeneration is similar to or less than 10 mW cm−2 (0.1 Sun).

These experiments suggested that the ruthenium electrolyte would likely exhibit a better PCE performance under a low-power illumination. With this assumption in mind, we examined the applied voltage-to-current output (JV) responses to several illumination powers (see Fig. 4 and Table 1). The cell exhibited JSC values of 1.41, 1.07, 0.91, and 0.73 mA cm−2 under illumination powers of 100, 50, 30, and 10 mW cm−2, respectively. These results showed that, in contrast to the steep decrease in the illumination power, the decrease in the JSC was relatively gradual. Thus, the PCE at 10 mW cm−2 (ca. 4.7%), by contrast, was enhanced by 5.6-fold, with a reduction in the light power (compared with a PCE of ca. 0.8% at 100 mW cm−2). Interestingly, such a dramatic enhancement of the PCE corresponding to changes in the illumination power has been rarely reported.20,50–52 Given that the PCE at 10 mW cm−2 (ca. 4.7%) is comparable to that of typical I−/I3− cells (ca. 5.1%) although the concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ (8 mM) is ca. 90-fold less than that of I− (700 mM), we expect that the use of the ruthenium electrolyte would likely be highly cost-efficient (see the ESI,† Section S12).

In summary, a new conceptual single-component redox shuttle, Ru(bpy)32+, led to a large enhancement in VOC (∼940 mV) relative to the VOC of cells containing the standard iodine-based shuttle. The enhanced VOC was ascribed to the relatively low redox potential of the ruthenium complex. Furthermore, this shuttle greatly boosted the PCE under low-power illumination conditions by approximately six-fold, suggesting that this shuttle is suitable for indoor use. Although the photocurrent output is quite low in this beginning step, chemical modification to the ruthenium complex to increase its concentration is expected to eventually magnify both the JSC and the PCE. We also anticipate that this ruthenium shuttle can be applied as an alternative electrolyte for quantum-dot solar cells (QDSCs) because of its low corrosiveness. This new concept should also be transferable to other solar cells, such as those with solid-state molecular electrolytes.
