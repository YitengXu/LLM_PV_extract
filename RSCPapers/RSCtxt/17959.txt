Practical limits for d are in the 100 nm range. To circumvent this limit, photolithography can be used to fabricate a sacrificial electrode that is then used to initiate and propagate the growth by electrodeposition of a nanowire. We have described a version of this strategy in which the sacrificial electrode delimits one edge of the nascent nanowire, and a microfabricated “ceiling” constrains its height during growth. The width of the nanowire is determined by the electrochemical deposition parameters (deposition time, applied potential, and solution composition). Using this method, called lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE), nanowires with minimum dimensions of 11 nm (w) × 5 nm (h) have been obtained. The lengths of these nanowires can be wafer-scale. LPNE has been used to synthesize nanowires composed of bismuth, gold, silver, palladium, platinum, and lead telluride.Chengxiang XiangChengxiang Xiang was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1981.

Introduction

Nanowires are finding applications in an ever expanding list of devices. Among their capabilities, nanowires composed of metals,1–8,11–17,19–23,31–34,39,40 semiconductors,6–10,18,24–29,41–43 metal oxides,30,44–58 and other materials59–65 can detect molecules,30,45,66,67 process electrical signals as transistors,68–77 diodes,78–83 and switches,84–92 and they can generate,79–82 absorb,93–95 and detect light.96–98Nanowires can function as lasers,99,100 strain sensors,101 and solar cells.93–95,102 Their remarkable utility and versatility is placing a premium on the development of new methods for preparing nanowires. But why are these new methods required?

        Copper
        nanowires, for example, are already extensively used as interconnects deep within some types of integrated circuits, especially microprocessors.103 These nanowires are produced using photolithography in conjunction with the damascene or double damascene methods,103–105 both of which allow the down-sizing of features produced at or above the diffraction limit of light. The utility of such copper nanowires for applications other than interconnects is limited, however, because these nanowires are embedded in a trench and surrounded on three sides by either silicon or a dielectric. “Exposed” metal nanowires can be patterned on top of glass or silicon surfaces by using electron beam lithography (EBL) in which an electron beam serially exposes a photoresist layer with very high resolution. EBL is widely used for patterning nanowires for research and development applications but it has not seen wider use because of its intrinsic inefficiency: Each nanowire must individually be “written” with an electron beam that moves, typically, at a speed of 10 cm h−1.106
In order to expedite the assimilation of nanowires into various technologies, two barriers must be overcome: first, it must be possible to efficiently synthesize ultra-long nanowires (L > 100 μm) that possess a high degree of diameter uniformity and that are free from breaks, and second, it must be possible to exercise control over the location and two-dimensional trajectory of a nanowire on a surface. Fabrication methods that satisfy either of these two criteria are listed in Table 1 and it is apparent here that very few nanowire fabrication methods presently satisfy both.

In 2005, a graduate student in our laboratory, Erik Menke, discovered a new approach to nanowire fabrication in which photolithography was first used to pattern an evaporated nickel film deposited on a glass microscope slide. Without removing the photoresist required for the patterning process, the nickel edge exposed at the perimeter of the patterned region was used to electroplate a metal (Pt, Au, or Pd) nanowire from an aqueous solution of the corresponding ion. Finally, the photoresist and the patterned nickel layer were both removed leaving the electrodeposited nanowire on a glass surface (Fig. 1). This approach enabled nanowires that were millimetres in total length to be lithographically patterned onto glass surfaces—a capability that we found very exciting. But Erik also noticed something unexpected: in some initial trials, gold nanowires prepared using this method were flat. Erik recognized that this was caused by the undercutting of the photoresist during the initial nickel removal step (Fig. 1, step 5). This undercutting caused the formation of a rectangular “trench” at the edges of the patterned region into which the nascent nanowire was deposited. The nanowire electrodeposited within this trench was flat and it had a uniform thickness that matched the thickness of the evaporated nickel layer. Subsequently, Erik showed that this undercut could be intentionally and reproducibly formed by controlled “over etching” of the nickel layer thereby affording him precise control of the nanowire height. Erik’s method was refined by students Chengxiang Xiang and Michael Thompson and their data formed the basis of our first publication describing the lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) method in 2006.36

Since then, we have been interested in defining the limits of the LPNE method and in expanding these limits. In this feature article, we summarize the new capabilities of the LPNE method that have emerged over the past three years.
The LPNE method
(a) Process flow for wire fabrication
The lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) method involves seven steps (Fig. 1). In step 1, a sacrificial film of either nickel or silver is deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) at a rate of 0.5–1.5 Å s−1. This metal layer is 5–200 nm in thickness and it defines the ultimate thickness of the nanowire that will be produced. In step 2, the metal film is over-coated with a uniform layer of a positive photoresist (PR) (Shipley 1808) using spin-coating (step 2). This PR layer is “soft baked” at 90 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. In step 3 of the LPNE process the PR layer is patterned by exposing it for 1.5 s using 365 nm light through a contact mask. In our lab, the light source is an intense NUV illumination system (Model 97434 Newport Corporation) controlled by a digital exposure controller (Model 68945 Newport Corporation). This level of sophistication is not required, however, and we have successfully prepared nanowires using contact masks prepared by laser printing onto transparency film in conjunction with a hand-held UV lamp. It is important to note here that we routinely carry out this photolithography in a standard chemistry laboratory with unfiltered air. Pattern transfer to the PR layer is completed by developing the exposed PR using Shipley MF-319 for 20 s, followed by rinsing in pure water, and drying in a stream of N2 or compressed air. Now, in step 4, the exposed metal layer is removed and an undercut is produced at the perimeter of the exposed region. For a nickel layer, 0.8 M nitric acid is used for this purpose whereas for silver the etchant is 18% NH4OH and 4% H2O2. The etching time is adjusted by trial and error to produce a ≈300 nm undercut and it varies depending on the thickness of the metal layer. At this point, a lithographically patterned, recessed metal edge has been produced on the glass surface. In step 5, we electrodeposit the nanowire into this “horizontal trench”. For metals, including gold, palladium, platinum, or bismuth, electrodeposition can be carried out potentiostatically and the wire width is then related to the concentration of metal ion in the plating solution, the deposition potential, and the deposition time. For lead telluride, a more complex procedure, described later, is required. The electrochemical cell employed for nanowire growth is a simple, 50 mL, one compartment, three-electrode cell. The composition of plating solutions, and other electrodeposition parameters are summarized in Table 2. A saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a 2 cm2Pt foil counter electrode were also employed. The final two steps, 6 and 7, involve the removal of the PR layer and the sacrificial metal electrode. The photoresist is removed first by rinsing with electronic grade acetone (Acros), methanol (Fisher), and finally Nanopure water in sequence. Then in step 7, the metal film is removed using the same etching solution that was used earlier in step 4.

In general, the nanowires produced using the LPNE method adhere strongly to the glass, oxidized silicon, or Kapton surfaces on which they are deposited. Promoting wire adhesion to the surface is a sub-monolayer of the metal (either silver or nickel) that persists on the insulator even after exposure to the etching solution. This residual metal is observable by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
(b) Independent control over lateral wire height and width
An important attribute of the LPNE method is that the nanowire height and width can be independently controlled. The horizontal trench produced in step 4 is the key to control of the nanowire height. This trench has a height that matches that of the recessed nickel layer (Fig. 2). Consequently, the height of the nanowire—that is, its dimension perpendicular to the surface—is controlled by the thickness of the evaporated metal layer deposited in step 1 of the process. A comparison of the thickness of this metal layer and the nanowire height—both measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM)—shows they are identical within our measurement precision (Fig. 2a). The minimum height of the nanowire is in the 5∼8 nm range depending on material.
 Fig. 2  Both the height and the width of a nanowire produced by LPNE can be independently controlled. (a) Nanowire height measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) versus the thickness of the evaporated nickel or silver layer.

The width of the nanowire is controlled by the electrodeposition duration together with the composition of the plating solution and the applied deposition potential. For the electrodeposition of a material into a rectangular trench using a time-invariant current density, Jdep, the width of the deposited nanowire, w, is given by:35 (1)where tdep is the deposition time, Vm is the molar volume of the deposited material, n is the number of electrons required to reduce each metal complex ion, and F is Faraday’s constant (96450 C/eq). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to measure the nanowire width as a function of deposition time (Fig. 2b). For nanowires composed of metals, the deposition time ranges from 5 to 500 s and the nanowire width increases linearly with the deposition time qualitatively as predicted by eqn (1). The minimum wire width obtainable by LPNE is ≈11 nm.
Thus, in the LPNE method, parameters associated with photolithography determine the position and 2D trajectory of the nanowire on the surface, its length and its height. Parameters associated with the electrodeposition control the nanowire width. Importantly, while LPNE makes possible extremely small wires, the distance separating nanowires on the surface continues to be constrained by the optical diffraction limit. A practical limit for this interwire “pitch” in our laboratory is presently 2 μm.
Metal nanowires
(a) The electrochemistry of LPNE nanowire growth

          Nickel is employed as the sacrificial electrode because it can be selectively removed by nitric acid without damaging gold, palladium, or platinum. Silver is substituted for nickel in the case of bismuth nanowire growth because it can be selectively removed using a mixture of NH4OH and H2O2 whereas the HNO3 required for removal of the nickel layer also attacks bismuth.
The properties of the nanowire electrodeposition depend both on the composition of the sacrificial electrode and on the composition of the plating solution. In the LPNE experiment, the electrode consists of an edge of exposed metal—a “nanoband” electrode—that wraps around the perimeter of the lithographically pattern region. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) can be used to study the electrochemistry in four metal plating solutions at this nanoband electrode. Two distinctly different behaviors are seen in the data shown in Fig. 3: if one looks first at the nickel edge data of Fig. 3a–c, the first metal deposition scan shows something unusual: the deposition current after the scan reversal at the negative limit is greater than before it for all three metals in spite of the fact that the concentration of metal ions near the nanoband is being depleted on the forward scan. The reason for this unusual voltammetric behavior derives from the fact that the nickel edge is oxidized and it is unable to efficiently transfer electrons to metal ions within the trench. As the metal deposition reaction proceeds, however, the NiO surface is replaced with gold (Fig. 3a), palladium (b) or platinum (c), all of which catalyze electron transfer and resist oxidation. Continued growth of the deposition current for all three metals is observed on subsequent scans as the replacement of NiO with noble metal is completed.
 Fig. 3  
            Cyclic voltammograms acquired in different metal plating solutions: (a) gold, (b) palladium, (c) platinum, (d) bismuth. The ranges of electrodeposition potentials are indicated in red. Reproduced with permission from ACS Nano, 2008, 2, 1939–1949. Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society.35 

          Bismuth deposition at a silver edge (Fig. 3d) shows dramatically different behavior, with the deposition current decreasing both on the first voltammetric scan and on subsequent scans. Here, in contrast to the case with nickel, the silver edge does not impede electron transfer because it does not support the formation of a significant oxide overlayer at this pH. The electrodeposition of bismuth has the opposite effect: instead of catalyzing electron transfer, electrodeposited bismuth is highly resistive and the ohmic drop within it reduces the overpotential available for continued bismuth deposition by dissipating some of this overpotential as heat. In addition, bismuth is a much poorer electrocatalyst than silver, a factor that contributes to the attenuation in the deposition rate as a function of time seen in Fig. 3d.
In spite of the differences seen in the details of the electrodeposition process at nickel and silver nanobands, nanowires of all four metals are readily obtained by potentiostatic growth under the conditions indicated in Table 2. This means that the LPNE method is remarkably tolerant of variations in the microscopic properties of the electrodeposition reaction. This versatility extends to the growth by LPNE of nanowires composed of semiconductors, such as lead telluride, a material which we shall discuss in some detail below. Subject to the constraint that the final etching step selectively removes the sacrificial metal layer, LPNE seems to be a materials-general method for patterning electrodeposited materials as nanowires.
(b) 
          Nanowire
patterning and LPNE process latitude
A distinguishing characteristic of LPNE is its ability to produce nanowires in any two-dimensional pattern subject to the “wire proximity constraint”: Sections of a single wire cannot approach one another at a distance below the diffraction limit, and no two nanowires produced in a single LPNE patterning operation can be positioned closer than this limit, which is approximately 2 μm in our laboratory.
Examples of nanowire patterns that can be obtained in a single LPNE patterning operation are shown in Fig. 4a–d. In these patterns, the critical dimension for the lithography that was performed is in the 10 μm range. The widths of the squares shown in the pattern of Fig. 4d, for example, are constrained by the diffraction limit. The continuous length of the nanowires contained within these patterns can easily exceed 1 mm. The parallel gold nanowires of Fig. 4b, for example, are spaced by 9 μm and are 1 cm in length. The gold nanowire shown in the spiral pattern in Fig. 4c has a total length of 2.7 cm (the patterned area is 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm).
 Fig. 4  
            Scanning electron micrographs (a–d and f) and a photomicrograph (e) of patterned of gold nanowires produced using the LPNE method. 
The length of these ultra-long nanowires can be reduced by appending a second photolithography step to strip away sections of nanowires, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. Here, a parallel array of gold nanowires was “diced” into gold nanorods by masking these wires with 2 μm wide photoresist stripes. The exposed gold segments were then removed by dissolution in an iodide/tri-iodide etching solution (16 mM KI3 and 8 mM KI). Gold nanorods were revealed after the removal of the photoresist.
The “wire proximity constraint” imposed by the diffraction limit is relaxed when the LPNE process is repeated twice in succession. Using this trick, nanowire patterns can be overlaid on top of one another to form more complex nanowire architectures.
For example, arrays of crossed nanowire junctions can be fabricated by patterning a parallel array of linear metal nanowires using a first LPNE operation, then repeating the entire LPNE process using the same mask rotated by 90°. SEM images of surfaces prepared using exactly this process are shown in Fig. 5. Importantly, the nanowire–nanowire junctions formed in these “LPNE nanowire overlays” have a resistance that is much smaller than that of typical nanowire connecting segments (Fig. 5c).

We have also demonstrated that nanowires can be directly patterned onto flexible Kapton polymer films. Kapton films were cleaned in acetone and pure water and then cut into 2.54 cm × 2.54 cm squares. These squares were then affixed to a glass slide to facilitate the LPNE processing steps, and released from this surface at the end of the fabrication procedure, which is otherwise identical to the process used for preparing metal nanowires on glass or oxidized silicon. Gold nanowires produced on Kapton (Fig. 6) adhered strongly and maintained their electrical continuity even after repetitive bending of the film.

Finally, we have discovered a method for obtaining, in a single LPNE operation, nanowires that are modulated in height. Shown in Fig. 7a, for example, is a gold “zig-zag” nanowire in which segments of the wire alternate between 22 nm and 78 nm in height (Fig. 7f).

These nanowires are obtained by preparing a sacrificial nickel layer that has the desired height modulation. Height modulated nickel layers were prepared by photopatterning a photoresist layer on a planar nickel film and then evaporating nickel a second time onto this patterned photoresist. After lift-off, a height modulated nickel film is produced as a nanowire growth template. Finally, this height modulated nickel layer is patterned, and nanowire arrays are electrodeposited exactly as in the normal LPNE process to produce height modulated nanowires mimicking the height profile of this nickel film.

          Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of linear metal nanowires composed of gold, palladium, platinum and bismuth on glass are shown in Fig. 8. These nanowires have a well-defined and highly uniform width and appear in these images to be continuous and free of gaps for millimetres, in most cases.

These images also expose one type of imperfection in these nanowires—deviations from the straight wire path programmed by the photolithographic mask. Experience has shown that the extent and severity of these “nanowire positioning defects” are mainly a function of the quality of the photolithography operation, including the type of contact mask employed and whether processing steps were carried out in a cleanroom or (as in Fig. 8) in unfiltered laboratory air. The metal etch carried out in step 4 (Fig. 1) can also cause the path of the metal edge to deviate from the trajectory programmed by photolithographic patterning, but we have concluded that this is a less important contributor to wire positioning defects than the photolithography itself.

          SEM images like those shown in Fig. 8 are used to assess the uniformity of the nanowire height and width. This analysis affords some broad generalizations for different metals as follows: the relative standard deviation RSDw for the width dimension is lowest for gold (RSDw,Au = 15%) and highest for platinum (RSDw,Pt = 28%). The height dimension is better controlled for all four metals, with RSDh ranges from RSDh,Bi = 6% to RSDh,Pd = 14%.
The ability of LPNE to produce dense arrays of nanowires makes possible the use of X-ray powder diffraction to determine the crystallographic structures of nanowires prepared by LPNE. Arrays of thousands of nanowires of 1 cm length and 2 μm in space are used to carry out powder X-ray diffraction measurements using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD, Fig. 9). In the cases of gold, platinum and palladium, the observed diffraction peaks can be indexed to the face-center cubic (fcc) structure except the broad peak centered at 25° that is produced by diffuse diffraction from the glass surface on which these nanowires were supported. For bismuth nanowires, more than twelve reflections can be indexed to the rhombohedral space group, indicating that the material is highly crystalline.

The nanowires prepared by the LPNE method are polycrystalline and XRD can provide an estimate of the mean grain size based upon Scherrer line broadening if the contribution of strain to the total line broadening can be assumed to be negligible. For nanowire arrays like the one shown in Fig. 9a, the GIXRD experiment produces a scattering vector oriented from 0° to 45°versus surface normal so it is mainly the out-of-plane grain structure that is probed using this method.
In addition to XRD, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be carried out together with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in order to probe the grain structure of nanowires. In general, only the wire height is small enough—between 5 and 20 nm—to enable the transmission of electrons so it is the in-plane grain structure of the nanowires that can be probed using TEM. This means that the grain size information gleaned from TEM is complementary to that provided by XRD, not redundant to it. Sample preparation for TEM usually involves the removal of nanowires from a glass or photoresist-covered surface and the collection of these nanowires onto carbon-coated TEM grids. TEM images (Fig. 10) show the in-plane grain diameters for four metals ranges from 3.9 ± 0.3 nm for bismuth to 40 ± 10 nm for gold. The spacing of the {111} lattice plane for all four metals is measured by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and in all four cases this spacing matched literature values (Fig. 10).

(d) Electrical characterization of metal nanowires
The ability of metal nanowires to conduct current is central to many of their projected applications. However, little electrical characterization data is available for metal nanowires prepared using the state-of-the-art methods summarized in Table 1, in large measure because these methods are very new and these data have not yet been collected. In fact, there is surprisingly little data on electrical conduction in metal nanowires prepared by EBL or conventional silicon microfabrication methods, such as the damascene and double damascene methods. Gold nanowires prepared by EBL have been studied by Durkan and Welland107 while copper104,105,108,109 and tungsten110nanowires prepared using a variant of the damascene method have been studied by Steinhogl and co-workers.104,105,108–110Palladium nanowires prepared using a pore-templated electrodeposition process and individually contacted using a focused ion beam (FIB) method have been studied by Marzi and co-workers.111
We have investigated the electrical properties of metal nanowires in some detail both at ambient temperature and as a function of temperature to 20 K in order to learn whether LPNE nanowires behave in accordance with the known physics of conduction in nanowires. For bulk metals, the resistivity arises from the scattering of conducting electrons by lattice vibrations and impurity sites. Two additional mechanisms of dissipation contribute to the resistivity of a polycrystalline nanowire: (1) surface scattering and (2) grain boundary scattering. In surface scattering, the specularity coefficient, p, describes the fraction of electrons that is specularly scattered at the wire surface from Fuchs–Sondheimer theory.112,113 In grain boundary scattering, the reflection coefficient, R, describes the fraction of electrons that are scattered by the potential barrier at grain boundaries from Mayadas–Shatzkes theory.114
We have been able to measure the values of p and R for nanowires of gold and palladium using equations for the temperature-dependent resistance of nanowires with rectangular cross-sections derived by following the seminal work of Steinhogl and co-workers who have studied nanowires composed of copper104,105,108,109 and tungsten.110 These measurements reveal that the additional resistivity seen in nanowires of Au and Pd derives first and foremost from enhanced grain boundary scattering (Au: 74.1–82.0%; Pd: 46.4–51.7%) and secondarily, from enhanced surface scattering (Au: 6.42–7.87%; Pd: 1.16–2.04%).
Using ultra-long gold nanowires prepared by LPNE, we have studied the effect on the electrical resistance of the electrochemical growth of an oxide monolayer.115 The electrical resistance of gold nanowires was measured as a function of the applied potential while sections of these wires were immersed in a 0.10 M solution of sulfuric acid, and the voltage range investigated coincided with the formation of an oxide monolayer. For the smallest wires investigated in this study, with dimensions of 18 × 95 nm, the growth of 0.8 monolayers of oxide caused the resistance to increase by 57% relative to the resistance of the reduced nanowire. The magnitude of this resistance increase is much larger than can be explained based upon either a simple depression of the specularity parameter, p, or a reduction in the cross-section of the wire (Fig. 11c). As the height of the nanowire increases from this 18 nm minimum value, the induced oxide monolayer causes a progressively smaller resistance elevation (Fig. 11b and c). Based on these observations, we believe a new dissipation mechanism operates at nanowire surfaces. One candidate mechanism is the infiltration of the oxide into grain boundaries at wire surfaces which can directly impact the value of R—the reflection coefficient at grain boundaries—adding to the enhanced resistance caused by the oxide at the surface of the nanowire by a depression in p.

The electrical behavior of bismuth (Bi) nanowires is considerably more complex due to its small effective mass, large mean free path, and small charge carrier density and Bi nanowires continue to be the subject of intensive study.116–121Bi nanowires are expected to show an extraordinary size dependence118,119 characterized by a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior at a critical dimension of 50 nm as a consequence of a quantum-confinement-induced semimetal–semiconductor transition.122 We have so far studied two relatively large Bi nanowires with dimensions of 96 × 290 nm (ρ300K = 359 Ω cm) and 260 × 650 nm (ρ300K = 654 Ω cm). The measured room temperature resistivities of these nanowires (ρ300K) were within the range of values measured previously6,123 and both showed monotonic thermally activated electrical conduction characteristic of semiconducting nanowires in spite of the fact that both were much larger than the 50 nm dimension above which bulk-like, metallic behavior is expected. The persistence of semiconducting behavior for bismuth nanowires with dimensions above 50 nm has been reported by Chiu and Shih123 and non-monotonic resistivity temperature behavior has also been reported by Cornelius, Heremans and co-workers119,124,125 due to finite grain sizes.
Lead telluride nanowires
(a) Electrochemistry of PbTe nanowire synthesis
A strength of the LPNE method is that nanowires are formed from electrodeposited material. In principle, this opens the door to the synthesis of nanowires composed of a wide variety of functional metal oxides, semiconductors, and polymers. Our first foray into nonmetallic nanowire growth has involved the preparation of nanowires composed of lead telluride (PbTe), a material that is of interest because of its desirable thermoelectric properties.126–133
The electrodeposition of PbTe is considerably more challenging than the growth of metal nanowires because the Pb : Te stoichiometry is critically important in this process and elemental excesses of both Pb and Te can readily be produced in addition to PbTe, degrading the quality of the deposited material.
Previously, we have employed an electrodeposition–stripping method to produce nanowires composed of Bi2Te328,29 and CdSe.24 The strategy in electrodeposition–stripping is to use a negative-going potential scan to synthesize the compound of interest (PbTe) as well as a small excess of lead (or cadmium). Then, on a subsequent positive-going scan, the excess Pb (or Cd) is stripped from the deposit to produce stoichiometric PbTe (or CdSe). The electrodeposition of elemental Te (or Se) is also possible at negative potentials within the synthesis range and Te (or Se) is not selectively removed during the ensuing anodic scan so it is critically important to minimize the concentration of these precursor species to eliminate excess elemental Te or Se in the produced nanowires. In general, this is accomplished by using a large (≈100-fold) stoichiometric excess of the metal relative to the chalcogenide.130,134
In Fig. 12 we show cyclic voltammograms associated with the growth of PbTe nanowires using LPNE and a nickel edge electrode. Here the synthesis solution contained 83 mM Pb2+ and just 0.83 mM TeO32−. On the negative-going scan to −0.85 V vs.SCE, PbTe and elemental Pb were concurrently electrodeposited and the excess lead is stripped from this deposit on the ensuing positive-going scan. The deposition of elemental Te is suppressed because of the very low concentration ratio (1 : 100) of TeO32− to Pb2+. The positive limit of −0.2 V is selected to enable the quantitative removal of elemental lead without affecting the PbTe which is itself stripped at ≈0 V vs.SCE (Fig. 12, red curve).

(b) Structural and composition characterization of PbTe nanowires
The characterization of nanowires composed of compounds presents all of the issues that are encountered for metal nanowires, including determination/verification of the bulk crystal structure, the detection and characterization of surface oxides, the measurement of the grain size, structure, and preferred orientation if any. New challenges involve the greater chemical and structural phase space, and the issue of stoichiometric excesses or deficiencies either within the bulk of the material or at wire surfaces.
A typical SEM image (Fig. 13a) of an array of PbTe nanowires captures a feature that is often seen for LPNE growth of linear wire arrays—the presence of two slightly different interwire spacings. This effect is caused by the fact that etching of the nickel layer reduces the interwire spacing in the direction of nickel removal. This asymmetry provides a way to quickly determine the growth direction for nanowires which is always towards the larger of the two interwire spacings. In high resolution SEM images (Fig. 13b), the edge of the nanowire that coincides with its growth direction is usually indicated by a greater edge roughness. This is apparent in Fig. 13b, for example, where the growth direction for all nanowires is down. As the nanowire width grows to the edge of the trench and fills it, the height dimension of the nanowire is no longer controlled and taller wire regions are produced along one edge (Fig. 13b, bottom). Images such as these reveal the depth of the trench and allow for the adjustment of this important parameter. Collectively, these SEM images clearly show that the cyclic electrodeposition–stripping method produces dense, continuous nanowires of PbTe that are free of breaks for hundreds of microns (Fig. 13a and b).

By controlling the number of scans, the width of PbTe nanowires can be adjusted from 60 nm to 400 nm (Fig. 13b and 14a). The height of PbTe nanowires is controllable using the thickness of the nickel layer deposited in step 1 of the LPNE process, just as with metal nanowires (Fig. 14b).

A TEM image of a PbTe nanowire ≈45 nm in width and 20 nm in height is shown in Fig. 13c. TEM images at higher magnification (Fig. 13d) permit the grain size to be directly measured and lattice fringe spacings can be measured to verify a particular crystal structure for the material. The image of Fig. 13d, for example, demonstrates good crystallinity by showing clear lattice fringes arrayed along the [200] direction with a d-spacing of 0.32 nm.135 The existence of a crystallographically preferred growth direction can also be detected in data of this type, but this is not observed for PbTe. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) converts TEM images with lattice resolution into diffraction patterns. The SAED pattern in Fig. 13e shows six diffraction rings that can be assigned to a single phase of PbTe—namely face-center cubic (fcc) PbTe (diffraction file number JCPDS 38-1435).
The quality of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns far exceeds that available from SAED in part because XRD data is derived from a much larger total quantity of material. XRD patterns for PbTe nanowires (Fig. 13f, blue trace) were collected for an array of PbTe nanowires deposited at 2 μm interwire pitch, resembling the gold nanowire array shown in Fig. 9a. As shown in Fig. 9b, an incident angle below the critical angle is used to achieve total external reflection of the X-rays from the silicon surface thereby maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio for the nanowires deposited on top. This incident angle is 0.3° in Fig. 13f.136,137 Diffraction peaks assignable to cubic PbTe (JCPDS 38-1435) are observed with high signal-to-noise. We routinely carry out the electrodeposition of the material of interest on a thin evaporated nickel layer for purposes of comparison to the LPNE nanowires (Fig. 13f, middle). In the case of PbTe, this thin film shows evidence of preferential texturing along [220]. If the contribution of lattice strain can be ignored, the Scherrer equation provides a means for determining the average grain size from the X-ray line width. When this analysis is applied to the XRD data for PbTe nanowires a mean grain size of 10–20 nm is obtained.
These XRD and TEM data provide no information on the chemical composition of nanowire surfaces where deviations from the bulk nanowire composition can be expected. X-Ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful tool for probing surface chemical composition and we have been fortunate to carry out XPS analysis of nanowires in a collaboration with Prof. John Hemminger and his research group at UCI. Typical narrow scan XP spectra of PbTe nanowires that were exposed to air for a few minutes are shown in Fig. 13g. For both Pb(4f), and Te(3d) regions, two pairs of doublets are seen—the more intense doublets are derived from PbTe, while the weaker doublets can be assigned to oxides of lead and tellurium with estimated thicknesses of 0.56 nm for PbO and 0.37 nm TeO2, respectively. From this result we conclude that air oxidation of PbTe nanowires is rapid at room temperature.
(c) Suspended PbTe nanowires
To measure the thermal properties of nanowires composed of PbTe and other materials, these nanowires must be thermally isolated from the surfaces on which they are supported. To accomplish this, nanowires must be suspended across air or vacuum gaps.138,139 We have developed a method called photoresist-bottomed LPNE (called PB-LPNE) in order to achieve this suspension for arrays of PbTe nanowires. PB-LPNE (Fig. 15a, b) allows the suspension of 25 μm nanowire sections 2 μm above a silicon surface between microfabricated photoresist bumps. The details of the PB-LPNE procedure are described elsewhere.37 This process (Fig. 15c) departs from the baseline LPNE process (Fig. 1) by starting with a glass or silicon surface on which a photoresist (PR) layer 1–2 μm has been deposited (Fig. 15c). At the end of the PB-LPNE process, this PR layer is patterned to produce a series of linear, periodic supports between which nanowires are suspended.

The air gap between the PbTe nanowires and the glass surface is ≈2 μm in this case. (c) Process flow for PB-LPNE commencing, at upper left, with step 4 of the “baseline” LPNE process (Fig. 1). Unique to PB-LPNE is the PR layer interposed between the nickel and glass. Reproduced with permission from Nano Letters, 2008, 8, 2447–2451. Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society.37 
(d) Electrical conductivity of PdTe nanowires
The air instability of PbTe nanowires demonstrated by the XPS spectra of Fig. 13g presents a barrier to the electrical characterization of these nanowires: How can their electrical properties be evaluated when an air exposure of a few minutes causes the formation of a insulating surface oxide layer? This duration is simply too short to permit the preparation by thermal evaporation of electrical contacts.
A solution to this problem is depicted in Fig. 16a. Since in the LPNE method, PbTe nanowires are grown on nickel nanoband electrodes, an intimate electrical contact is formed at the nickel–PbTe interface along the entire axis of the nanowire. Therefore, after the nanowire is deposited and the photoresist has been removed, this sacrificial nickel layer can be patterned to form the electrical contacts necessary to make high quality, four-point measurements of the nanowire resistance. The patterning of the nickel layer can be carried out using photolithography. The central portion of such a device is shown in the SEM image of Fig. 16b. Using devices such as these, I–V curves for three PbTe nanowires were acquired (Fig. 15c), yielding conductivities ranging from 0.70 × 104 to 1.8 × 104 S m−1. This value is in the range of conductivity values of bulk PbTe in the literature.135,140,141 This approach is not limited to PbTe and we expect it to be useful for the electrical characterization of a variety of other air-reactive nanowire materials.

Conclusions
Lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) is a new tool for the synthesis of nanowires on surfaces. LPNE leverages photolithography to control the position and path of nanowires and electrochemistry to synthesize them. Nanowires may be produced in parallel over wafer scale distances, and nanowires can be electrically continuous for centimetres, but lateral nanowire dimensions are not constrained by the diffraction limit: wire widths are controlled by the electrodeposition parameters, and the wire height by the template prepared by photolithography.

        LPNE makes it possible to pattern nanowires faster, and at lower cost, than is possible by any other currently available method to our knowledge. This cost efficiency exists as a consequence of the fact that nanowires are produced over large, wafer-scale regions in parallel. The competing method of electron beam lithography requires nanowires to be serially written in photoresist using an electron beam, expending far greater time, proportional to the length of the nanowires to be produced, and requiring an expensive electron beam writer. As a specific example, the fabrication by LPNE of the nanowire array shown in Fig. 9a, consisting of 20 nm × 200 nm nanowires each 1 cm in length and spaced laterally by 2 μm (a total nanowire length of 50 m!) required approximately 6 h. Approximately 500 h would be required to produce a similar array using an electron beam writer operating at 10 cm h−1. Is the time efficiency of LPNE economically offset by the demands for electrical power of the method? No, this is not the case because of the minute amounts of material that are deposited. Referring again to the nanowire array of Fig. 9a, a total of just 6 mC (or 6 mA for one second) would be required to produce this gold nanowire array. LPNE opens the door to the use of nanowires in integrated circuits, in chemical sensors, and in optical devices such as diffraction gratings where it has not been practical to employ nanowires up until now.
Because the gamut of materials accessible using electrodeposition is enormous, ranging from metal oxides, to polymers, to semiconducting compounds, to conductive charge transfer complexes in addition to metals, the potential for LPNE to produce nanowires with unique and useful properties is unbounded.
A central challenge for future work is control of the grain size. LPNE produces polycrystalline, not single crystalline, nanowires. Methods must be developed for adjusting the grain size without altering their lateral dimensions or degrading the wire dimensional uniformity. A long term goal of this work is to obtain single crystalline metal and semiconductor nanowires with lengths in the millimetre range.
