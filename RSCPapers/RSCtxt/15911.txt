    , Accepted 12th February 2017First published on 13th February 2017AbstractThe conversion of carbon dioxide into useful chemicals is a prospective strategy for alleviating the greenhouse effect and the depletion of energy. Herein, we report an artificial photosynthetic system composed of a photoanode and a photocathode comprised of NRx@TiO2 functionalized with Nile red via covalent linkage or Pd/NRx@TiO2 with additional palladium nanoparticles. The new Nile red derivatives and organic–inorganic composite electrodes were steadily prepared and well characterized using NMR, HRMS, UV-vis, FTIR, TEM, XPS, XRD and SEM. Methanol and oxygen were the products that could be detected in the liquid and gas phase. The main active species in this artificial photosynthesis system were proven using EPR spectroscopy to be hydroxy radicals releasing O2 gas via H2O2. Moreover, the carbon source of methanol was validated using a 13CO2 labeling experiment; 18O2 was determined to come from H2O using GC-MS. The optimal photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction was carried out using Pd/NR2@TiO2 as the working electrode yielding methanol at a rate of 106 μM h−1 cm−2 with high light quantum efficiency (Φcell = 0.95).
1. Introduction
Solar energy is regarded as the most prospective energy resource on account of inexhaustibility and zero-pollution character and is utilized with the help of three distinct approaches: photoelectric, photothermal, and photochemical conversion.1 Solar fuels derived from solar energy by photochemical conversion can act as an alternative to traditional energy sources.2 Artificial photosynthesis is one of the promising photochemical processes mimicking photosynthesis in nature,3 with the exception for water splitting, first reported by Honda and Fujishima.4 Although various catalyst systems have achieved water splitting to release oxygen and hydrogen,5,6 these only fulfil partial artificial photosynthesis without CO2 participation. Therefore, light-driven CO2 conversion in water to carbon-based fuels allowing for better integration into the existing energy infrastructure is the best example of artificial photosynthesis in light of the coupling of water splitting and CO2 reduction.7–37
In 1978, Halmann reported pioneering research on photocatalytic CO2 reduction employing a p-type GaP cathode to obtain a small amount of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol.21 Subsequently, CO2 reduction with water in the presence of TiO2 was reported by Honda et al.22 Unfortunately, several promising semiconductors such as TiO2, oxides in particular, have a wide band gap, which results in an onset of the absorption below 400 nm.2 A convenient method to overcome this issue is using a molecular sensitizer adsorbed on a semiconducting electrode, which will harvest visible light and trigger the photocatalytic CO2 reactions.38,39
N-Containing ligands have also demonstrated good properties to absorb and activate CO2 in this reaction.40–42 Herein, we designed a new approach to modify a semiconductor by embedding sensitizers of Nile red via N-containing ligands onto the surface of TiO2 films producing a series of organic–inorganic composite photocathodes (NRx@TiO2). The new artificial photosynthetic cells of NRx@TiO2||Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 and Pd/NRx@TiO2||Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 can efficiently realize both water-splitting and CO2 reduction yielding solely methanol in the liquid phase and oxygen in the gas phase (Scheme 1).

2. Experimental
2.1 Syntheses of Nile red dyes
The derivatives of Nile red (NRx, x = 1, 3, 4) were fabricated referring to a literature procedure43 using 5-diethylamino-2-nitrosophenol hydrochloride and various 2-naphthol derivatives as starting materials. The detailed procedures for their preparation are described in the ESI.† The synthetic route to NR2 is depicted in Fig. 1. 6-Bromo-2-naphthol (1) was reacted with boron ester to give the boron precursor 2 that was then treated with TBSCl to protect the free phenolic hydroxyl group yielding intermediate 3. The protection strategy aimed to adjust the solubility of intermediate 2, which was beneficial for purification of the subsequent reactions. A Suzuki cross-coupling between 2,3-dibromonaphthalene-1,4-dione and 3 was conducted to form a C–C bond and give intermediate 4 in modest yields. Key intermediate 4 could react with o-aminophenol via an intramolecular Michael addition to yield Nile red derivative 5 that was then converted to the corresponding intermediate 6via a deprotection reaction using butyl ammonium fluoride. The target molecule NR2 could be efficiently obtained via a Duff reaction.

2.2 Preparation of the photocathodes
The preparation procedures for the photocathodes are illustrated in Fig. 1. FTO/TiO2 films were initially fabricated following our previously reported procedure.44 These electrodes were then modified with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES, J&K Chemical) in ethanol under reflux conditions. The organic–inorganic composite photocathodes (dye–APS–TiO2) were produced in situ by submerging the electrodes into a THF solution of the new Nile red dyes under reflux conditions. The obtained photocathodes were coloured from red to blue were designated as NRx@TiO2. After depositing Pd nanoparticles onto the surfaces of the NRx@TiO2 electrodes, more efficient photocathodes named as Pd/NRx@TiO2 were successfully obtained.
2.3 Artificial photosynthesis experiments
A two-electrode cell of (Pd/NRx@TiO2)||Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 equipped with a Si-solar cell was filled with 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution as the electrolyte and saturated with a stream of high-purity CO2 for 30 min. Then, the reactor was irradiated using a xenon lamp under 200 mW cm−2 when a tiny voltage (∼0.6 V) was provided between the photoanode and photocathode by the solar cell under 5 W LED light. The liquid products were quantified by 1H NMR spectroscopy using 70 μL electrolyte containing deuterated water, dimethyl sulfoxide and phloroglucinol as internal standards.
3. Results and discussion
Considering the CO2 absorption of the N-containing ligands and the light-harvesting ability of dyes, Nile red derivatives were immobilized onto the surface of FTO/TiO2. The designed organic–inorganic photocathodes were successfully fabricated and characterized using various techniques. The performance of their artificial photosynthetic cell was documented as well.
3.1 UV-vis, IR spectra and TGA of the organic–inorganic composites
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the NR series dyes in DMF solution and the organic–inorganic composites of dye–APS–TiO2 (NRx@TiO2) are depicted in Fig. 2 & Table 1. The results show that the absorption bands of the dyes in the organic–inorganic composites have a significant bathochromic-shift when compared to that of the free NR series dyes in DMF solution. According to their FTIR spectra (Fig. S5†), the peaks at 1068 and 1680 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of the Si–O and CN bonds, respectively, indicating the formation of a Si–O–Ti linkage and Schiff base, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S6†) reveals that the dyes were embellished onto the surface of TiO2 film via APTES as well.

3.2 The electrochemical properties of the dyes
To gain more insight into the properties of the dyes, the energy levels of the molecular orbitals were calculated based on their cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and UV-vis spectra. The E0–0 values of the dye molecules (Table 1 & Fig. S1†) were estimated from the intersection between the UV-vis absorption and emission spectra as follows: 2.12 eV (NR1), 2.44 eV (NR2), 2.08 eV (NR3) and 2.05 eV (NR4). In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dyes were also calculated and are listed in Table 1. We can see that the LUMOs of the dyes were located more positively than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, which indicates that the injection of photoelectrons from the LUMO of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2 was a thermodynamically facile process (Fig. 3). In particular, the LUMO of NR2 was positioned at −2.5 eV, which shifted to a more positive level than that of the other sensitizers implying a larger driving force in the electronic injection process. The HOMOs of the dyes were much higher than the valence band (VB) of TiO2.

3.3 XPS, SEM and TEM characterization of the Pd/NRx@TiO2 photocathodes
The fabricated photocathodes Pd/NR2@TiO2 were authenticated using a variety of characterization techniques. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images revealed the clear lattice plane of Pd (111) with d111 = 0.2282 nm and TiO2 (101) with d101 = 0.3492 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the photocathodes (Fig. S8†) showed that the percentages of anatase, rutile phase and SnO2 of FTO were not changed before and after our investigations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Pd/NR2@TiO2 manifests the characteristic peaks of Pd, which were situated at 334.4 eV (3d5/2) and 339.7 eV (3d3/2). There were two chemical peaks for nitrogen elements, in which, one peak at 397.2 eV was derived from the CN bond and another peak at 401 eV was assigned to the N elements in the heterocycles (Fig. 4). These phenomena validated the deposition of Pd and the linkage of the organic molecules onto the surface of the TiO2 films. Moreover, XRD and XPS results show that the photocathode has no palpable change before and after the artificial photo-electrocatalytic experiments (Fig. S7 and S8†). In addition, the current density was slightly enhanced after 100 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S10†). These results confirm the high stability of our organic–inorganic composite photocathode.

3.4 Linear sweep voltammetry
To reveal the photoelectrocatalytic activities of new organic–inorganic composite photocathodes of Pd/NRx@TiO2, their linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of were recorded using an electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The experiments were conducted in an aqueous solution of KHCO3 saturated with CO2 under simulated sunlight irradiation, and the results are depicted in Fig. 5a. Their current densities increase evidently when the bias potential was over −0.6 V, reflecting a good coupling of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and electrochemical water splitting. Taking notice that a considerable photocurrent was detected around a bias potential of −0.4 V, a photocatalytic water splitting and photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction would occur in these systems. Therefore, we decided to set up a new artificial photosynthesis system containing two electrodes under a voltage below 1.23 V of theoretical water splitting. The LSV diagrams of the two-electrode cell for Pd/NR2@TiO2||Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 under argon were also recorded and are presented in Fig. 5b. The voltage of water splitting was taken from 1.43 V under dark conditions to 1.38 V under light irradiation conditions. The current density of the cell was larger under light irradiation than that found under dark conditions because of the photoelectrons generated by the Nile red dyes.

3.5 Artificial photosynthetic experiments
The artificial photosynthetic cells were assembled with novel photocathodes, NRx@TiO2 or Pd/NRx@TiO2, a photoanode of Co-Pi/W:BiVO4, and electrolyte of 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution, mimicking a plant environment. This equipment is shown in Scheme 1 and was irradiated using simulated sunlight as well as being powered by a Si-solar cell on the electrodes with −0.6 V. After termination of the experiment, the products in the electrolyte and gas phase were then detected by proton NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS, respectively.
The formation rates of the products and quantum efficiency versus various conditions are illustrated in Fig. 6 as a histogram. First, when the organic–inorganic composite photocathodes of NRx@TiO2 were applied in this artificial photosynthetic system, methanol was a unique product in the electrolyte. The formation rates of methanol for the various electrodes were 2.32 (NR1@TiO2), 6.94 (NR2@TiO2), 3.47 (NR3@TiO2) and 5.79 μM h−1 cm−2 (NR4@TiO2), respectively. In contrast, a bare TiO2/FTO photocathode working in artificial photosynthesis could not generate the target product. These results imply that the dye molecules of NRx embedded on the surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles are not only a good sensitizer harvesting sun-light, but also are good ligands to catch CO2 molecules. When the palladium nanoparticles were deposited on the basis of the NRx@TiO2 films generating new photocathodes of Pd/NRx@TiO2, the production rate for the artificial photosynthetic systems augmented sharply to 21.76 (Pd/NR1@TiO2), 106.4 (Pd/NR2@TiO2), 54.88 (Pd/NR3@TiO2) and 29.09 μM h−1 cm−2 (Pd/NR4@TiO2), respectively (Fig. 5). These results show that Pd loading has a great impact on the CO2 conversion performance. This was attributed to the Pd nanoparticles embedded on the surface of TiO2 having a good ability to adsorb protons from the electrolyte. The protons combine in situ with the photoelectrons in the LUMOs of the TiO2 films generating active hydrogen atoms that reduce CO2 to the target product. The highest light quantum efficiency (Φcell) was up to 0.95 for the Pd/NR2@TiO2 photocathode, which was more than two times that found for plants in nature.
 Fig. 6  The conversion results for CO2 reduction using the various photocathodes. 
As a comparison, this artificial photoelectrochemical system bearing Pd/NR2@TiO2 as a photocathode also worked without the external power supply from the solar cell. The formation rate of methanol dropped significantly from 106.4 to 5.92 μM h−1 cm−2 (Fig. 7). This implies that the external power supply is very important for our new artificial photosynthesis systems to give electrons from the photoanode to the cathode. Excitingly, these new artificial photosynthesis systems can also work under weak irradiation conditions of 32 mW cm−2, giving methanol at a rate of 6.61 μM h−1 cm−2. In addition, the oxygen released from the photoanode mimicking photosystem II could be detected by GC-MS (Fig. S18†). In order to certify the stability of the prepared photoelectrodes, repeated experiments were conducted using Pd/NR2@TiO2 in our new photoelectrochemical cell. The results show that the activity of the photocathode kept at the same level after four cycles because the reduction reactions that take place in this photocathode differ from the oxidation reaction in the pollutant decomposition process. In addition, the used photocathodes were also studied by XRD and XPS (Fig. S7, S8 and S19†).

3.6 Mechanism investigation

3.6.1 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 
The charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be illustrated by the electrochemical impedance spectra. Impedance experiments were conducted at −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the CO2 saturated electrolyte solution (0.1 M KHCO3) using Pd/NRx@TiO2 as the working electrode. An equivalent Randles circuit model was fitted to the data to obtain the Rct value for each artificial system,19 which indicates the interface transfer resistance between electrode and electrolyte. The Nyquist plots and Rct values are shown in Fig. 8 and Table S1.† The Pd/NR2@TiO2 photocathode exhibits a smaller circular radius than the other photocathodes, which suggests that Pd/NR2@TiO2 has a lower resistance in the electron transfer process and acquires enough electrons for CO2 reduction.

3.6.2 Mott–Schottky ananlysis of Pd/NRx@TiO2 electrode. 
Mott–Schottky plots of the two photocathodes under dark conditions are presented in Fig. 6b, in which Pd/NR1@TiO2 and Pd/NR2@TiO2 showed the greatest difference in the carbon dioxide conversion rates. The positive slopes, which indicate that the film behaves as an n-type semiconductor, were obtained at 0.5 kHz for each electrode; however, the slopes at a given frequency for the two electrodes were slightly different. Mott–Schottky plots were fitted to the following equation.  where ε0 is the dielectric constant, εr is the permittivity of free space (F cm−1), q is the electronic charge (C), Efb is the flat band potential (V) and Csc is the capacitance of the space charge layer, the charge carrier densities (ND) were calculated and obtained assuming the relative permittivity of TiO2 to be εr = 80 according to the literature.45 The carrier concentration of Pd/NR2@TiO2 was estimated to be 1.098 × 1019 cm−3, which was somewhat larger than that of Pd/NR1@TiO2 (0.94 × 1019 cm−3). This suggests that Pd/NR2@TiO2 should have a greater carrier density relative to Pd/NR1@TiO2. In addition, the flat band potential (Efb) plays an important role in the photoelectrocatalytic performance. The Efb value of the Pd/NR2@TiO2 photocathode shifted negatively from −0.58 V to −0.72 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) when compared with the Pd/NR1@TiO2 photocathode, which indicates an enhancement in the bending band edge and a smaller barrier for the transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers. As shown in Fig. S15,† the CB potential of Pd/NR2@TiO2 was high enough (ca. 0.14 eV vs. NHE) for CO2 reduction to produce methanol. In contrast, the potential of Pd/NR1@TiO2 could not thermodynamically afford an adequate driving-force for methanol formation. The more negative flat band potential, higher carrier density and abundant driving force promised to be more active for CO2 conversion.


3.6.3 EPR experiments. 
EPR experiments are an effective technique used to detect the formation of short-lived radicals. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was widely used as a spin trapper for OH radicals. The results are depicted in Fig. 9. The signals with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 (blue hexagram, hfsc: αN = αH = 14.73 G) were assigned to DMPO-OH˙ radicals that are in agreement with the literature values.24 The other 6 signals marked with a red star are assigned to DMPO-O2H˙ radicals (hfsc: αN = 16.1 G, αHβ = 24.5 G) that exist in a neutral solution.46 Hence, ˙OH and ˙OOH radicals should be the main active species during carbon dioxide reduction under visible light irradiation.

3.7 Isotopic labelling experiments using 13CO2 and H2O18
To verify the carbon source of methanol derived from CO2 reduction in our artificial photosynthesis system, an isotopic labelling experiment using 13CO2 for CO2 reduction was carried out. After bubbling argon for 30 min to eliminate oxygen from the entire system, 13CO2 gas was introduced into the system for 15 min. The related artificial photosynthesis was performed for 8 h under solar-simulated light irradiation. Fig. 10 presents the result of the labelling experiment, in which, a double peak of 13-methanol, at 3.03 and 3.42 ppm, was attributed to the coupling of proton and 13C of the methyl group caused by the influence of nuclear magnetic moment of isotope carbon on the hydrogen nucleus. This result clearly indicates that the carbon source for methanol is 13CO2.

The artificial photosynthesis with 98 atom% H2O18 was also carried out under the same conditions. Isotopically labelled 18O2 was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using Pd/NR2@TiO2 as the photocathode (Fig. 11), which proved that the oxygen was released from the photoanode mimicking photosystem II. Synchronously, the results reveal that no side products can be detected.
 Fig. 11  GC-MS of 18O2. 
In general, when supplying a tiny voltage to the cell, the protons (H+) and hydroxyl groups (OH−) move oppositely to the negative or positive electrode. The CO2 reduction takes place at the photocathode; the CO2 molecules are caught by the nitrogen atoms in the organic moieties and the protons are absorbed by the Pd nanoparticles (Fig. 12). When the dye molecules harvest the photons, the electrons in the HOMO of the dyes jump to the LUMO generating photoelectrons that would transfer immediately to the protons on the surface of the Pd nanoparticles, making active hydrogen atoms that reduce CO2in situ to methanol. Simultaneously, the hydroxyl radicals are generated under light irradiation via the OH− group transferring to the BiVO4 electrode and releasing oxygen gas via H2O2. On the other hand, the OH− groups transfer electrons directly to the HOMO of the dyes rather than forming hydroxyl radicals, and this electron transportation is a photocatalytic way of sensitizer recovery.

4. Conclusions
We developed a novel artificial photosynthesis system containing a Nile red dye embedded organic–inorganic composite photocathode mimicking the photosystem I and Calvin cycle, and Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 as the photoanode mimicking photosystem II. These efficient photoelectrocatalytic cells can uniquely convert CO2 to methanol at a rate of 106.4 μM h−1 cm−2 under a light density of 200 mW cm−2. Encouragingly, these cells can work with very weak light irradiation as well. The isotopic labelling experiments of 13CO2 and H2O18 show that the carbon source of the methanol product comes from the CO2 gas supply instead of the decomposition of the organic moieties in the electrode. The EPR experiments demonstrate that the ˙OH radicals are the key intermediates in this process of artificial photosynthesis. The light quantum efficiency of the new artificial photosynthetic cells can reach up to 0.95, which is higher than that found for plants (0.4).
