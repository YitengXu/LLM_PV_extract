    , Accepted 24th October 2018First published on 8th November 2018AbstractThe development of highly efficient electrocatalysts has attracted increasing attention in the field of electrochemical energy conversion. Therefore, we report a simple self-template method to construct Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages through the anion exchange reaction of CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes with chalcogenide ions under mild solvothermal conditions. Benefiting from advantageous compositional features and well-designed architectures, the obtained Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages display enhanced electrocatalytic activity for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. Remarkably, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages as the counter electrode (CE) catalyst deliver a prominent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.25% for DSSCs compared with Pt CE (8.19%). Furthermore, when used as an OER catalyst, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity in terms of their low overpotential of 304 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH solution. This work provides wide prospects for the rational design and synthesis of high-performance transition metal chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts for future energy conversion systems.
Introduction
With the increasing need for sustainable and clean energy resources to reduce consumption of exhaustible fossil fuels and accompanying environmental issues, electrochemical energy conversion techniques are poised to play a crucial role in meeting future energy demands.1–3 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and water electrolysis, as rising stars with inherent distinguished properties, stand out from other energy conversion technologies and have gradually received worldwide attention on account of their low cost, eco-friendly nature and excellent performance.4–8 To date, Pt- and Ir/Ru-based catalysts are considered to be suitable electrocatalysts for triiodide (I3−) reduction and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which occur in DSSCs and water electrolysis, respectively. Nevertheless, their widespread application is extremely hindered due to costs, resource scarcity and poor durability.9–12 Hence, it is extremely essential to design high-efficiency and robust electrocatalysts composed of earth-abundant elements for both DSSCs and OER.
Because of their outstanding optical, catalytic, electrical and magnetic characteristics, considerable efforts have been dedicated to investigating transition metal chalcogenides.13,14 The outstanding characteristics of these materials make them ideal for large-scale applications in DSSCs, water electrolysis, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and so on.15–20 In particular, CoX2 (X = S, Se, Te) has been previously regarded as a highly effective counter electrode (CE) material in DSSCs and a promising candidate for OER.15,21–23 For instance, Dong et al. synthesized single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods through a hydrothermal method, which exhibited a better power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.38% compared with 7.83% for the Pt CE under the same conditions.24 Moreover, it was systematically demonstrated by Cui's group that transition metal dichalcogenides (MXs, M = Co, Ni, Fe; X = S, Se, Te) exhibit good electrocatalytic performance for OER, since MXs have a large potential to transform into metal oxide/hydroxides during electrochemical tests in alkaline solution.25 However, compared with noble metal-based catalysts, the DSSC and OER performance of the reported binary CoX2 (X = S, Se, Te) electrocatalysts is far less satisfactory, and further improvements are imminently required. Thus, a number of strategies have been developed to improve the DSSC and OER performance of CoX2-based (X = S, Se, Te) catalysts through modulating the active sites on the atomic scale. For example, Sun and co-workers engineered and synthesized a NiS2/CoS2 CE, which displayed a better PCE of 8.22% than that of the Pt CE (6.61%) and a CoS2 CE (5.91%).25 A hybrid structure comprising CoS2–CoSe2 nanocrystals encapsulated in N-doped carbon hollow nanocubes (denoted as CoS2–CoSe2@NC) was synthesized by Qian et al. via a simultaneous sulfuration and selenation strategy. The obtained CoS2–CoSe2@NC provided an impressive PCE of 8.47%, which is superior to those of CoS2@NC (7.38%), CoSe2@NC (7.85%) and Pt (8.08%), respectively, demonstrating the synergistic effect of CoS2–CoSe2 heterojunctions.27 In addition, a hybrid comprising Au atom-decorated CoSe2 with a modulated d-band has been proven to exhibit substantially better OER efficiency than single-crystal CoSe2.28 Therefore, decorating electrocatalysts with another metal compound provides an optional method for constructing high-activity electrocatalysts on the atomic scale.
Moreover, tin chalcogenides (Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te)) have been researched for years as alternative materials to noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on sodium storage,29 Li-ion batteries,30 Na-ion batteries30,31 and solar cells,32 while the application of tin chalcogenides as DSSC and OER electrocatalysts has rarely been exploited. As is known, Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) has high electrical conductivity and prominent chemical durability, enabling it to act as a promising electrocatalyst for both DSSCs and OER.33–35 In this regard, combining CoX2 with Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) to form hybrid architectures integrates the advantages of the individual components to realize a strong synergistic effect, thus elevating the intrinsic properties of each component. However, it remains a challenge to predict the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal sulfides, selenides and tellurides according to their different compositions, structures and morphologies.
In addition to chemical composition control, the morphology and size of catalysts also play an important role in the efficiency of renewable energy systems.12,36,37 Particularly, nanostructured cubic morphologies with exposed edges and vertices containing catalytically active sites are exceptionally attractive for DSSCs and OER.38–41 However, the construction of hollow or porous nanostructured metal chalcogenides remains a challenge, since it is hard to find appropriate templates and effective preparation approaches. Thus, the development of facile methods to synthesize hollow or porous transition metal chalcogenide nanocubes that are highly efficient in energy conversion applications is highly desired.
Herein, highly uniform Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages were in situ generated from CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes via an anion exchange strategy under gentle solvothermal conditions. This self-template method offers an opportunity to fabricate nanocages with different chemical compositions and porous interiors by changing the chalcogenide ions. Impressively, the unique nanoporous and conductive structures of the obtained samples guarantee ample active sites or edges during the electrocatalytic process, leading to the enhanced DSSC and OER performances. More importantly, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages as CE materials exhibit an extraordinary PCE of 9.25% in DSSCs, surpassing that of the Pt CE (8.19%). Furthermore, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages also serve as attractive OER catalysts with superior activity, affording a small overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and excellent stability in alkaline solution.

All reagents were used directly without any further purification. Water deionized with a Millipore system was used in this work.
Synthesis of CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes
The CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were synthesized based on a previous report with minor modification.42 4 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O and 4 mmol of Na3C6H5O7·2H2O were dissolved in 140 mL deionized (DI) water and the mixture was stirred for several minutes. Subsequently, the pink solution was mixed with ethanol (20 mL) containing SnCl4·5H2O (4 mmol) under vigorous stirring, and then 20 mL of NaOH (2 M) was added dropwise into the solution under ambient temperature. After stirring for 1 h, the pink product was collected and washed using DI water and ethanol, and then dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum.
Synthesis of Co–Sn–S nanocages
Typically, 40 mg of the as-obtained CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes and 80 mg of C2H5NS were dispersed in 60 mL of ethanol and stirred for 15 min. After thoroughly mixing, the mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and held at 140 °C for 12 h. Then, the resulting black product was collected by rinse-centrifugation, washed several times with DI water and ethanol, and then dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight. Finally, in order to enhance its crystallinity, the product was calcined at 450 °C for 2 h at the heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere.
Synthesis of Co–Sn–Se nanocages
90 mg of the as-obtained CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes and 64 mg of Se powders were dispersed in 30 mL of DMF, and then 2 mL of N2H4·H2O (80%) was added drop by drop under stirring. The homogeneous solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After centrifugation, washing thoroughly with DI water and ethanol more than three times, and drying at 50 °C overnight under vacuum, the resulting Co–Sn–Se nanocages were finally collected. Co–Sn–Se nanocages with high crystallinity were obtained using same treatment as that employed in the synthesis of the Co–Sn–S nanocages. For comparison, pure CoSe2 and SnSe2 were directly prepared using the same process, except CoCl2·6H2O and SnCl4·5H2O were used as the metal sources, respectively.
Synthesis of Co–Sn–Te nanocages
26 mg of Te powder and 8 mg of NaBH4 were dispersed in 12 mL of DI water under vigorous stirring until a homogeneous solution was obtained, and then 14 mg of the as-synthesized CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were added. After thorough mixing, the mixture was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 15 h. The product was obtained by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol several times, and finally dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum. The Co–Sn–Te nanocages with high crystallinity were obtained using the same treatment as that employed in the synthesis of the Co–Sn–S nanocages.
Material characterization
The crystal phases of the products were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert3, Cu-Kα, λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Raman spectra were characterized using a Renishaw system with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The surface morphologies of all samples were collected using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). The inner structure and element mapping of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages were investigated using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, TECNAI G2 F20) with equipment for energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, AMETEK). The chemical states of the samples were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Mg-Kα radiation). The specific surface areas and corresponding pore-size distributions of the products were investigated using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm tests on an Autosorb-iQ analyzer (Quantachrome).
Electrode preparation

Fabrication of electrode for DSSCs. 
According to our previous report,43 the homogeneous catalyst ink was obtained by dissolving 100 mg of as-prepared material in 10 mL of isopropanol solution under sonication for 30 min. By using a spin-casting method, the resulting homogeneous catalyst ink (50 μL) was casted onto cleaned FTO glass (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) at a rotating speed of 500 rpm for 12 s. The treated CEs were then kept at 120 °C for 10 min after each spin-coating. Finally, the mass loading of the catalysts was about 0.67 mg cm−2. As a reference, the Pt CE was prepared by spin-casting 20 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution onto FTO glass, and then annealing at 450 °C for 0.5 h in an oven.


Fabrication of electrode for OER. 
For the preparation of the working electrode, typically, 5 mg of the catalyst was added into a mixed solution containing 20 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) and 980 μL of DI water/ethanol (v/v = 1:1) with the assistance of sonication for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 10 μL of catalyst ink was dropped onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) using a micropipette and dried naturally. The loading amount of the catalyst was about 0.71 mg cm−2.

Fabrication of DSSCs
Screen-printed double layers of TiO2 particles were used as photoelectrodes in this study, similar to our previous reports.44,45 Traditionally, commercial 20 nm TiO2 sols were coated five times to build a transparent layer on the FTO conducting glass. Then 200 nm TiO2 sols were printed twice to fabricate a scattering layer. After sintering at 500 °C for 1 h in air and cooling down to 25 °C, the photoanodes were immersed into TiCl4 aqueous solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 60 min and roasted again under the same conditions. Afterwards, the TiO2 photoanodes were immerged into absolute ethanol solution of dye N719 (0.3 mM) for 24 h to adsorb sufficient dye and obtain the resultant dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes. The electrolyte (300 mM 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 100 mM LiI, 50 mM I2 and 500 mM 4-tert-butylpyridine in anhydrous acetonitrile) was added into the separation between the TiO2 photoanode and as-prepared CE. Finally, sandwich-like DSSCs were obtained with an active electrode area of the sealed cell of 0.16 cm2.
Electrochemical measurements
All of the tests were carried out on an electrochemical work station (CHI 660E) at room temperature.

DSSCs measurements. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were obtained under AM 1.5 G one sun intensity (100 mW cm−2), produced by a solar simulator (XM-500 W, Trusttech). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted in symmetrical cells assembled with two identical CEs (CE/electrolyte/CE), using a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and an AC amplitude of 10 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a three-electrode system at different scan rates with a potential from −0.5 to 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, in which the as-formed CE, Ag/AgCl electrode, and Pt sheet were taken as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. An anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 1 mM I2, 10 mM LiI and 100 mM LiClO4 was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical stability of Co–Sn–Se was evaluated using a CV test cycled 40 times. Tafel polarization curves were also acquired in the symmetrical cell at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.


OER measurements. 
The electrocatalytic activities of the materials for OER were comprehensively evaluated using a three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. In this system, a GCE uniformly covered with the electrocatalyst was identified as the working electrode, a Pt plate (1 × 1 cm2) was taken as the counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode was employed as the reference electrode. The potential was measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and transformed into that for the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + (0.059 pH + 0.197) V. Before each experiment, the working electrode was continuously cycled at least 40 times in the potential range from 0 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 until a stable cyclic voltammetry was recorded for OER. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was collected in a potential range from 0 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The EIS measurements were performed at 0.56 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalysts was obtained by CV measurements in the potential range from 0.17 to 0.27 V vs. Ag/AgCl at different scan rates (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 mV s−1). The value of Cdl was calculated by linear fitting the j = (janodic − jcathodic)/2 at 0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl against the scan rate, where the linear slope was Cdl. The long-term stability of Co–Sn–Se was obtained by the current amperometric and a 2000-cycle CV test. To remove the gas bubbles during electrocatalysis process, a rotation rate of 500 rpm was applied in the OER measurements.

Results and discussion
Growth mechanism of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages
The synthesis strategy is schematically expounded in Fig. 1. First of all, well-defined CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were facilely prepared in an aqueous solution via fast stoichiometric co-precipitation of Sn4+ and Co2+ in the presence of citrate ions and OH−, according to a previous report.42 Afterwards, the formed CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes, which simultaneously act as the metal source and structural template, were reacted with chalcogenide ions under solvothermal conditions to fabricate Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages. The involved driving force mentioned above can be conditionally regarded as the anion exchange mechanism, similar to some previous reports.46–48 In detail, at the time of the solvothermal sulfuration reaction, S2− ions (the active species) were generated through the alcoholysis of C2H5NS (eqn (1) and (2)). Furthermore, S2− ions were oxidized to elemental S (eqn (3)), which played a vital role in the next chemical reaction. Lastly, Co2+ and Sn4+ cations in the CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes diffused outwards and reacted with S2− and S, resulting in the formation of CoS2 and SnS2 nanoparticles (eqn (4)). CH3CSNH2 + C2H5OH → CH3(NH2)C(OC2H5) – HS(1) (2) 2H2S + O2 → 2S + 2H2O(3) CoSn(OH)6 + 3H2S + S → CoS2 + SnS2 + 6H2O(4)

Moreover, the selenation process can be accomplished through the reaction with Se powder under a reductive environment. Typically, the involved reaction progression can be expressed as follows. 5N2H4 + 2Se → 4N2H5+ + 2Se2− + N2↑(5) CoSn(OH)6 + 3Se2− + Se → CoSe2 + SnSe2 + 6OH−(6)
Likewise, the possible procedures for the preparation of the Co–Sn–Te nanocages can be described as follows. 2Te + 4BH4− + 7H2O → 2HTe− + B4O72− + 14H2↑(7) CoSn(OH)6 + 3HTe− → CoTe2 + SnTe + 3OH− + 3H2O(8)
Morphologies and compositions
The compositions and crystal structures of the as-prepared catalysts were first characterized using XRD. Obviously, the XRD pattern (Fig. S1a†) shows that all the peaks of CoSn(OH)6 can be perfectly assigned to cubic CoSn(OH)6 (PDF no. 74-0365), indicating that CoSn(OH)6 was synthesized successfully. After sufficient solvothermal sulfidation treatment, CoSn(OH)6 was fully in situ transformed into a Co–Sn–S bimetal sulfide hybrid of CoS2 and SnS2, as confirmed by Fig. 2a. In detail, the peaks located at 27.91°, 32.33°, 36.33°, 39.91°, 46.39° and 55.03° are ascribed to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220) and (311) planes of cubic CoS2 (PDF no. 65-3322), respectively. Furthermore, the XRD patterns confirm the existence of hexagonal-type SnS2 (PDF no. 23-0677) and exhibit five peaks at 14.98°, 28.43°, 32.20°, 41.91°, 49.97° and 52.44°, corresponding to the (001), (100), (101), (120), (110) and (111) lattice planes, respectively. In Co–Sn–Se (Fig. 2b), the diffraction peaks of the samples are well-matched with cubic CoSe2 (PDF no. 65-3327) and hexagonal SnSe2 (PDF no. 89-2939), suggesting the coexistence of CoSe2 and SnSe2 in Co–Sn–Se. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of pure CoSe2 and SnSe2 shown in Fig. S1b† further verify the crystal structure of Co–Sn–Se. As for Co–Sn–Te (Fig. 2c), the diffraction peaks can be assigned to orthorhombic CoTe2 (PDF no. 74-0245) and cubic SnTe (PDF no. 39-0924), indicating the successful transformation of CoSn(OH)6 to the corresponding telluride. The XRD results fully prove that the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages were fabricated successfully after the anion exchange reaction.

Raman spectroscopy was further employed to analyze the composition of Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te). As displayed in Fig. 2d, Co–Sn–S exhibits two peaks situated at 388 and 314 cm−1 corresponding to the Ag mode of CoS2 and the A1g mode of SnS2, respectively, and confirming the formation of CoS2 and SnS2 in the hybrid material.33,49 According to the red curve in Fig. 2d, the peak located at 184 cm−1 may result from the vibrational mode of the Se–Se bond (Ag).50 Furthermore, the peaks at 464, 510 and 668 cm−1 demonstrate the constitution of the cubic CoSe2 phase.49 In addition, the Raman spectrum of Co–Sn–Te displays one typical peak (A1) located at 121 cm−1, which can be ascribed to elemental tellurium, indicating the existence of telluride in the Co–Sn–Te composite.51,52
In order to reveal the surface morphology of the as-synthesized CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes and Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages, FESEM analysis was conducted. The FESEM images of the materials are shown in Fig. 3 and S2.† It can be seen in Fig. 3a and b that the CoSn(OH)6 particles possess exclusively regular nanocubes with an average size of approximately 150 nm. Notably, after the anion exchange reaction, the regular Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) particles still retain their cubic morphology and size well, but exhibit rough surfaces, as displayed in Fig. 3c–h. For comparison, amorphous CoSe2 and SnSe2 are shown in Fig. S2.† As such, we demonstrate the efficacy of this straightforward method to fabricate metal chalcogenides while retaining their cubic shape and size through anion exchange treatment.

To get further insight into the inner and crystal structure of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages, TEM and HRTEM images are displayed in Fig. 4. As revealed in Fig. 4a and b, the Co–Sn–S nanocages are constructed by numerous interconnected ultra-small nanoneedle matrixes. Moreover, the HRTEM image of the Co–Sn–S nanocages shown in Fig. 4c reveals two sets of interlayer distances of 0.278 and 0.589 nm, which are well assigned to the (200) plane of CoS2 and the (001) plane of SnS2, respectively. This result is entirely in accordance with the XRD analysis. The representative TEM images (Fig. 4d and e) show the cubic hollow structure with a thin shell composed of numerous tiny and densely packed crystallites in the resulting Co–Sn–Se samples, in good agreement with the SEM observations. Meanwhile, well-defined interlayer spacings of 0.264 and 0.610 nm are clearly visible in the HRTEM image (Fig. 4f), which are indexed to the (210) plane of CoSe2 and (001) plane of SnSe2, respectively. In Fig. 4g and h, it is clear that the Co–Sn–Te nanocages are constitutive of enormous encapsulated particles (yellow circles) with diameters of about 20 nm. As depicted in Fig. 4i, the interlayer distances of 0.281 nm and 0.240 nm are associated with the (111) plane of CoTe2 and (110) plane of SnTe, respectively. Note that the Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te nanocages possess different inner and outer structures, which may be due to the well-known Kirkendall effect during the solvothermal process.53–56 Additionally, the EDX spectra (Fig. S3a–c†) and EDX element mapping (Fig. 4j–l) demonstrate the coexistence of (Co, Sn and S), (Co, Sn and Se) and (Co, Sn and Te), as well as their homogeneous distribution in the Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te nanocages, respectively.

XPS measurements were further carried out to investigate the chemical composition of Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te). The survey spectra of Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) (Fig. S3d†) indicate the presence of (Co, Sn and S), (Co, Sn and Se) and (Co, Sn and Te) in the Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te, respectively. Fig. 5a, d and g display the Co 2p region of Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te, respectively. All samples exhibit two main peaks at about 780 and 795 eV accompanied by two satellite peaks, assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively.57 Additionally, the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 in the Co 2p spectrum increase in the following order: Co–Sn–Se < Co–Sn–S < Co–Sn–Te. Likewise, the high-resolution scans of Sn 3d for Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te are described in Fig. 5b, e and h, in which two characteristic peaks at around 484 and 495 eV can be attributed to Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively.58 However, the binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 show the adverse order of Co–Sn–Te < Co–Sn–S < Co–Sn–Se. Moreover, in the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 5c, the peaks at 161.9 and 162.9 eV indicate the formation of disulfide S22−, and the peak at 168.9 eV is ascribed to S–O resulting from surface air exposure.59 The high-resolution Se 3d spectrum (Fig. 5f) displays two peaks located at 54.4 and 55.4 eV corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, which is consistent with Se22− and Se2− in CoSe2 and SnSe2.60 In addition, the peak at 59.8 eV is attributed to Se–O present in the surface of Co–Sn–Se, according to a previous report.54 The Te 3d XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 5i demonstrates that the peaks positioned at 573.1 and 583.5 eV belong to Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2, respectively.61 Moreover, the peaks at 576.1 and 586.6 eV are assigned to Te–O, implying oxidized Te on the surface of the Co–Sn–Te.62

For the purpose of evaluating the specific surface areas and pore size distributions, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 6, all the isotherms show a type-IV isotherm with a type-H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.5–1.0 p/p0, indicating the presence of a mesoporous structure in Co–Sn–Se (X = S, Se, Te).45 The specific surface areas of Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te, acquired from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation, are 48.81, 53.83 and 26.56 m2 g−1, respectively. In addition, the pore size distributions calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method are exhibited in Fig. S4a–c.† Both Co–Sn–S and Co–Sn–Se possess a small pore size distribution between 3 nm and 5 nm, while the Co–Sn–Te nanocages exhibit a relatively broad pore size distribution range from 1 to 10 nm. Furthermore, the BJH desorption pore volumes of Co–Sn–S, Co–Sn–Se and Co–Sn–Te are approximately 0.27, 0.30 and 0.17 cm3 g−1, respectively. As expected, the high specific surface areas and pore volumes of Co–Sn–Se can be ascribed to the porous hollow structure, which may provide large contact area and ample catalytic sites, leading to better electrocatalytic performance in both DSSCs and OER.63–66

DSSC performance of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages
The J–V curves of integrated DSSCs based on different CEs are shown in Fig. 7a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters containing open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 1. It is noteworthy that the DSSCs fabricated with different CEs have similar Voc. Therefore, it is a higher Jsc that actually results in a better PCE of a DSSC. The reason why the PCE can be improved by increasing Jsc is mainly due to the rapid electron transport and low charge transfer resistance (Rct) for I3− reduction.43 Evidently, the cell device with the Co–Sn–Se CE produces a higher PCE of 9.25% (Voc = 783 mV, Jsc = 18.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.65) than that of Co–Sn–S (8.91%) and Co–Sn–Te (8.72%), arising from their own higher catalytic activity, electrical conductivity, larger specific surface area and larger accessible inner surface for electrolyte filling.67 Moreover, the PCEs based on Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) are superior to those of the Pt CE (8.19%), CoSe2 CE (7.89%) and SnSe2 CE (7.42%) due to a synergistic effect of the catalytic activity and nanoporous structure, which brings about plentiful contact areas and electroactive sites during the I3− reduction process. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs containing a Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) CE is also comparable to those based on previously reported transition metal chalcogenides (Table S1†), making Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) catalysts fascinating CE materials for use in DSSCs.

In order to thoroughly illustrate the electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared CEs, EIS measurements were obtained. The Nyquist plots of all samples display two semicircles. In general, the left semicircle in the high-frequency field represents Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which reveals the charge transfer process and the catalytic activity of the different CEs. The intersection with the horizontal axis signifies the series resistance (Rs), made up of contact resistance and bulk resistance.67 Meanwhile, the right arc in the low frequency range is related to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple (I−/I3−) transport within the electrolyte. Traditionally, a low Rct promotes electron transfer from the CE to the electrolyte for catalytic reduction of I3− and accordingly contributes to reducing the interfacial recombination, while a large Rct implies a tardy electron transfer process and frequently brings about a small Jsc value of the DSSC.68 The resulting EIS plots and corresponding equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 7b, and the relevant parameters are displayed in Table 1. Apparently, the various CEs exhibit similar Rs values, indicating that the performance of different CEs impacted by Rs values can be neglected.45 The Rct values follow the tendency of Co–Sn–Se (0.59 Ω) < Co–Sn–S (1.02 Ω) < Co–Sn–Te (1.72 Ω) < Pt (2.52 Ω) < CoSe2 (3.41 Ω) < SnSe2 (4.65 Ω), demonstrating an inverse order of catalytic activity, which is consistent with the J–V measurements.
The reaction kinetics and catalytic activities of the prepared CEs, which are positively related to the PCE, were investigated using CV measurements. CV curves exhibiting two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox-1/Red-1, Ox-2/Red-2) are clearly observed in Fig. 7c. From left to right, the two couples of the redox current peaks are assigned to the I−/I3− (eqn (9)) and I3−/I2 (eqn (10)) redox reactions, respectively.16 I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(9) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(10)
With respect to CE function, the left pairs of peaks (Ox-1/Red-1) are closely related to the catalytic ability of the as-prepared CEs; thus, more attention is paid to it. Traditionally, the higher reduction peak current intensity (|JRed-1|) and lower peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Ox-1 and Red-1 definitely represent better catalytic activity and electron transfer efficiency of the CEs.26 The |JRed-1| and corresponding Epp values are displayed in Table 1. Obviously, the |JRed-1| values conform to the tendency: Co–Sn–Se (1.75 mA cm−2) > Co–Sn–S (1.51 mA cm−2) > Co–Sn–Te (1.30 mA cm−2) > Pt (1.12 mA cm−2) > CoSe2 (1.08 mA cm−2) > SnSe2 (0.91 mA cm−2), whereas the corresponding Epp values exhibit the adverse order: Co–Sn–Se (293 mV) < Co–Sn–S (342 mV) < Co–Sn–Te (369 mV) < Pt (393 mV) < CoSe2 (462 mV) < SnSe2 (511 mV). Consequently, Co–Sn–Se shows the best electrocatalytic activity for reducing I3−, which is in accordance with the J–V and EIS measurements.
CV measurements at different scan rates for the Co–Sn–Se CE were performed to assess the relationship between the scan rates and the peak current densities of Ox-1 and Red-1. As shown in Fig. 7d and e, the peak current densities are positively correlated with the scan rates. Meanwhile, an obvious linear relationship between the peak current densities and the square root of the scan rates can be obtained, suggesting that diffusion limitation of the redox reaction on the surface of the Co–Sn–Se CE obeys the Langmuir isotherm principle.69 This consequence indicates that I3− reduction is mostly restrained by the ionic diffusion process in the electrolyte and there is no specific interaction between the I−/I3− redox couple and Co–Sn–Se CE.70 In addition, the electrochemical stability of Co–Sn–Se was evaluated by conducting continued CV tests (40 cycles) at a scan rate of 50 mV S−1. As shown in Fig. S5,† no significant changes in the |JRed-1| and Epp values were observed, indicating the long-term electrochemical stability of the Co–Sn–Se CE. Furthermore, the physical stability of Co–Sn–Se was investigated by SEM and XRD (Fig. S6†). Obviously, the cubic morphology and composition were retained, confirming the robustness of Co–Sn–Se.
Tafel polarization tests were further executed to reconfirm the catalytic activity of the different CEs. Fig. 7f and Table 1 display the Tafel curves of the samples and corresponding parameters, respectively. Obviously, both the exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) increase in the order of Co–Sn–Se > Co–Sn–S > Co–Sn–Te > Pt > CoSe2 > SnSe2. Traditionally, the J0 value is obtained by the tangents to the cathodic branch at zero potential ordinate and the interception of the cathodic part with the vertical axis is identified as the Jlim.71 Moreover, J0 can also be obtained from eqn (11).16 In general, a higher value of J0 and Jlim reflects a better electrocatalytic ability of an electrode.
Consequently, the results of Tafel polarization curves match well with the above experiments, and also certify the preeminent diffusion properties and remarkable catalytic activity of the Co–Sn–Se CE for reducing I3−. J0 = RT/nFRct(11)
Here, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (298 K), n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction, F is Faraday's constant and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.
OER performance of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages
The electrocatalytic OER performance of the as-synthesized samples was evaluated through coating a uniform catalyst film on a GCE and making use of a three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH solution. Electrochemical preconditioning was conducted by continuously cycling for at least 40 times in the potential range from 0 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 to reach a stable state. LSV polarization curves showing the current density versus the voltage for the synthesized samples and RuO2 are shown in Fig. 8a. As depicted in Fig. 8b, the Co–Sn–Se, Co–Sn–S and Co–Sn–Te exhibit low overpotentials of 304, 332 and 343 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Notably, the OER electrocatalytic activity of the Co–Sn–Se is much higher than CoSe2 (378 mV) and SnSe2 (420 mV), indicating a strong structural advantage and synergistic effect between CoSe2 and SnSe2. In addition, Co–Sn–Se presents better catalytic activity than RuO2 (330 mV), owing to its chemical composition, hollow structure and high specific surface area, which is comparable to the performance of many previously reported Co-based electrocatalysts (Table S2†).

(c) The corresponding Tafel plots of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) samples, RuO2, CoSe2 and SnSe2. (d) Nyquist plots of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) samples, RuO2 and CoSe2, and the corresponding equivalent circuit (inset). (e) The Cdl of the Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) samples. (f) The i–t curve of the Co–Sn–Se at a constant overpotential of 304 mV. The inset of (f) shows the OER polarization curves of the Co–Sn–Se before and after 2000 CV cycles. 
The catalytic kinetics for the OER were examined by the linear fitting of the corresponding Tafel plots derived from LSV curves according to the Tafel equation, η = blogj + a, where η is the overpotential, b corresponds to the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and a is a constant.72 It can be seen in Fig. 8c that the Tafel slope of 72 mV dec−1 for Co–Sn–Se is much smaller than those for Co–Sn–S (81 mV dec−1), Co–Sn–Te (91 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (78 mV dec−1), implying that Co–Sn–Se exhibits faster kinetics and a higher catalytic activity.
To further research the OER kinetics of the electrocatalysts, EIS measurements were carried out. The Rct acquired from the semicircle in the high frequency range is closely associated with the catalytic kinetics between the catalyst and electrolyte. Furthermore, a smaller value indicates a quicker electron transfer rate.73,74 As can be seen in Fig. 8d and S7,† Co–Sn–Se presents a smaller Rct of 22.24 Ω than Co–Sn–S (35.38 Ω), Co–Sn–Te (51.50 Ω), RuO2 (30.86 Ω), CoSe2 (87.23 Ω) and SnSe2 (389.5 Ω), which is in good agreement with the analysis of the LSV tests and indicates a reason for the better electrocatalytic performance of Co–Sn–Se.
In addition, to gain insight into the excellent intrinsic OER activity of Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te), the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which is proportional to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), should be estimated.75 Therefore, Cdl was calculated using CV measurements in the non-faradaic region from 0.17 to 0.27 V vs. Ag/AgCl with different scan rates (Fig. S8†). As depicted in Fig. 8e, Co–Sn–Se shows a large Cdl value (41.90 mF cm−2), which is modestly higher than those of Co–Sn–S (34.87 mF cm−2) and Co–Sn–Te (16.47 mF cm−2). The higher specific capacitance indicates that the Co–Sn–Se possesses more active sites, which is beneficial for the enhancement of OER activity.76 This may be another reason for the enhanced OER performance of Co–Sn–Se.
Meanwhile, the current amperometric (i–t) test at an overpotential of 304 mV exhibits a slight decline of the current density after 10 h in alkaline medium (Fig. 8f) and no significant change was observed after 2000 cycles (inset of Fig. 8f), demonstrating the long-term stability of Co–Sn–Se. The high stability of Co–Sn–Se was further attested in terms of the preserved original profiles and structure analyzed by SEM and XRD characterizations (Fig. S9a and b†). The unchanged morphology and structure may pledge a large specific surface area with abundant exposed electrocatalytic active sites for OER. Metal oxide/hydroxides, as the true active sites for OER, were not detected by XRD, which might be ascribed to the fact that the oxidation reaction may only occur on the surface and their content is too tiny to be observed.25,77 Moreover, XPS was performed to examine the surface composition of Co–Sn–Se. By comparing the XPS spectra before and after the OER stability measurements (Fig. S10a–d†), it can be observed that after OER stability testing, the Co 2p XPS spectrum exhibits a similar intensity at about 778.2 eV. Meanwhile, a distinct intensity increase and positive shift are observed at around 780.8 eV (corresponding to the oxidized Co species), reflecting the surface oxidation of Co–Se.78 As for the Sn 3d binding energy (484–488 eV), no obvious variation was observed. Additionally, the Se 3d binding energy (54–56 eV) exhibits a slight negative shift after the OER stability test. Consequently, the XPS results further confirm the robustness of Co–Sn–Se after long-term serial oxygen evolution.35,77,78 From all of the above analysis, it can be concluded that Co–Sn–Se exhibits outstanding OER activity as well as good stability in an alkaline electrolyte.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a simple and general anion exchange method for the synthesis of Co–Sn–X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages with uniform morphology and good structural stability using CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes as functional templates. The as-prepared samples all show enhanced electrochemical performance in DSSCs and OER. Particularly, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages containing CoSe2 and SnSe2 exhibit better catalytic activity for both DSSCs and OER than Co–Sn–S and Co–Sn–Te nanocages, owing to their compositional features, hollow structures and larger specific surface areas. As CE materials for DSSCs, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages demonstrate an extraordinary PCE of 9.25%, outperforming the Pt CE (8.19%). Moreover, the Co–Sn–Se nanocages also possess brilliant OER properties with a small overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and long-term stability in alkaline solution. This work holds the potential to provide guidelines for the construction of transition metal chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts in energy conversion technologies.
