    , Accepted 20th January 2023First published on 26th January 2023AbstractOne-dimensional nanowires have emerged as compelling ideal materials due to their characteristic structure, properties, and applications in nanodevices. Herein, based on experimental vdW-chain bulk crystals, a series of one-dimensional (1D) XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I) ternary nanowires are theoretically investigated. Such exfoliated 1D nanowires possess excellent stability and moderate band gaps (1.76–3.16 eV). The calculated electron mobilities were found to reach a magnitude of 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 and even up to 322.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1D BiSeI nanowires, which are much larger than those of the previously reported 1D materials. Furthermore, the appropriate band edge alignments and considerable optical absorption endow 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires with prospective photocatalytic properties for water splitting. Notably, AsSI and AsSeI nanowires possess a unique non-centrosymmetric structure and exhibit promising 1D ferroelectricity. Large spontaneous polarization values, Ps, of 11.31 × 10−10 and 6.92 × 10−10 C m−1 are obtained for 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires, respectively, and such 1D ferroelectricity can be regulated by intra-chain strains. Our calculations not only broaden the family of 1D materials but also reveal their great potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric devices.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of graphene,1 low-dimensional materials have attracted much research attention because of their unique structures and properties. In particular, compared with three-dimensional (3D) bulk and two-dimensional (2D) sheets, one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials not only exhibit a much larger specific surface area but also possess outstanding flexibility, which enables 1D materials for a multitude of exciting applications, such as catalysts,2,3 transistors,4 and flexible devices.5 Recently many new 1D materials have been proposed theoretically and confirmed experimentally.
So far, some 1D materials obtained by breaking the bonds of 3D bulk crystals, including Cu and ZnO nanowires,6,7 have been explored and used for applications in fields of optoelectronics and catalysis. However, the sectional dimension of these 1D materials is about several tens of nanometers, which cannot meet the demand of integration and miniaturization of devices. With the size of electronic devices continuing to scale down, designing and synthesizing 1D materials with a smaller width scale become an urgent demand. Recently, some 1D materials at the atomic scale, such as Ta2X3Se8 (X = Pd, Pt),8–11 Nb2Se9,12 TaSe3,13 and Te/Se nanochains,14,15 have been successfully exfoliated from their van der Waals (vdW) bulk crystals. Such a natural vdW-chain structure provides a convenient solution for the preparation of 1D nanochain materials and the obtained 1D nanostructures have unique advantages, such as structural homogeneity and non-dangling-bond surfaces. Based on the successful exfoliations of 1D materials in the experiment, some 1D single-chain materials have also been predicted using theoretical methods, including SbXY (X = S, Se; Y = Br, I),16 Sn2X3 (X = S, Se),17 V2Se9,12,18,19 SiX2 (X = S, Se),20 PdGeS3,21 Ta4SiTe4,22 and Ga3Te3I,23 which have greatly enriched the family of 1D materials.
Non-centrosymmetric materials may exhibit useful pyroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and ferroelectricity, leading to their potential applications in transistors,4 sensors,24,25 random-access memory,26 actuators,27,28 and photocatalysis.2,3 Particularly, the miniaturization of electronic devices has put forward a new requirement of reduction of size of ferroelectric materials. The discovered low-dimensional vdW materials provide a broad application prospect for the further development of ferroelectric materials at the atomic scale. Compared to the traditional bulk perovskite materials, such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and BiFeO3,29–34 the primary advantages of low-dimensional (1D or 2D) vdW materials are stable atomic thickness and surfaces without dangling bonds.1,31,35–37 In fact, the ferroelectricity of a variety of 2D layered and 1D chained materials has been proposed using experimental and theoretical methods, such as 2D SnTe,38,39 2D CulnP2S6,40 2D In2Se3,41–43 2D WTe2,44 1D InSeI,45 1D XN (X = Sb, Bi),46 and 1D XS (X = Sn, Ge).47,48 However, low-dimensional ferroelectric materials with good structural stability and robust spontaneous polarization are comparatively rare.
Bulk group V–VI–VII compounds are typical vdW materials crystallized in chain structures, which are linked via weak vdW interactions.49–58 Such materials are expected to exfoliate into 1D chained materials by micromechanical or solution methods. Meanwhile, the reduction of the dimension of V–VI–VII compounds may break the inversion symmetry, resulting in the appearance of ferroelectricity. As a significant family of compounds, it is worthy studying the exfoliated feasibility and unique properties of 1D V–VI–VII ternary nanowires.
In this work, we constructed 12 group V–VI–VII ternary nanowires XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, and I) from their corresponding experimental bulk crystals. Based on first-principles calculations, a series of 1D nanowires were theoretically searched based on their structural stability, electronic band structures, ferroelectricity, carrier mobilities, and band edge alignments. Our calculations show that these 1D nanowires possess moderate band gaps in a large range of 1.76–3.16 eV and exhibit higher electron mobilities with one or two orders of magnitude larger than their corresponding hole mobilities. Due to the appropriate band edge alignments and considerable optical absorption, 1D XVYVIZVII semiconductors are expected to be used as photocatalytic materials. Moreover, for two non-centrosymmetric structures, AsSI and AsSeI, we also explore the promising 1D ferroelectricity. The calculated spontaneous electric polarizations of the 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires are 11.31 × 10−10 and 6.92 × 10−10 C m−1, respectively, which are much larger than those of the previously reported 1D ferroelectric materials. Furthermore, the ferroelectric switching barrier and the spontaneous electric polarization can be effectively regulated by the applied tensile strain. All the extraordinary properties ensure that 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires have a broad application prospect in electronic and optoelectronic devices.
2. Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),59,60 using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.61 The exchange–correlation interaction was employed to describe the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.62 The kinetic cut off energy of plane-wave basis was set to 500 eV and the Brillouin zone was sampled using 1 × 1 × 12 Γ-centered k-point grids.63 The convergence criteria for energy and force were set to 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. A vacuum region with 20 Å thickness was introduced to eliminate the interaction between nanowires with periodic boundary conditions. The vdW interactions were corrected using the DFT-D3 approach in Grimme's scheme.64 The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional was adopted to calculate the electronic band structure.65 The phonon spectrum calculations were performed using the finite displacement method in the PHONOPY code under a 1 × 1 × 8 supercell.66 The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations within the canonical NVT ensemble were implemented using a 1 × 1 × 10 supercell at 300 K by using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat.67,68 The spontaneous electric polarization was calculated by using the modern theory of polarization based on the Berry phase method.69–71 The energy barriers of phase transition processes were determined using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.72
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures and stability
The structures of group V–VI–VII ternary bulk compounds have been studied experimentally for a long time. As is known, there are 12 typical vdW-chain structures in the bulk crystals XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I), which exhibit different interchain stacking and space groups. As shown in Fig. 1, bulk AsSI and AsSeI belong to the P21/c (No. 14) space group,49,57,58 while bulk AsTeI and SbTeI possess their own typical C2/m (No. 12) space group symmetry.52,58 Bulk SbSI and SbSeI possess two phase structures, belonging to Pnma (No. 62) and Pna21 (No. 33) space groups, respectively.50,51,56 The bulk SbSI and SbSeI with the Pnma space group are centrosymmetric. However, the Pna21-space-group phase structures are typically non-centrosymmetric and exhibit a ferroelectric distortion. Small displacements between Sb and S (Se) atoms along the chain direction exist in such phase structures, leading to the appearance of polarization along the chain direction. In the experiment, the phase-transition temperature of the two phases for bulk SbSI was measured to be 295 K.73 Actually, for SbSI and SbSeI, the bulk structure with the Pnma space group is more stable than that with the Pna21 space group with energy. Thus, we only consider the Pnma phase structure in this work. Moreover, all other Bi-based V–VI–VII bulk vdW-chain compounds were mainly stacked in the form of Pnma (No. 62) space group, such as BiSCl, BiSBr, BiSI, BiSeCl, BiSeBr and BiSeI.53–55

To assess the possibility of exfoliating these 1D V–VI–VII ternary nanowires, we carry out the calculation of exfoliation energy defined as:17,22 E1Dexf = E1D/N1D − Ebulk/Nbulk,(1)where Ebulk (E1D) and Nbulk (N1D) are the total energies and number of atoms for 3D bulk (1D nanowires), respectively. All the exfoliation energies of these 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires are summarized in Table 1. The results show that exfoliation energies of all systems are lower than that of the experimentally exfoliated 1D Te nanochain (∼273 meV per atom).15 Such small exfoliation energies determine the exfoliation feasibility of 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires from their bulk counterparts.

When the dimensionality is reduced to 1D, the crystal symmetry of XVYVIZVII nanowires mainly changes to P21 and P21/m space groups, which belong to polar and non-polar structures, respectively. All units are periodically arranged in the form of a net-like structure in the plane perpendicular to the xy-plane, forming 1D nanowires along the z direction. As shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f), the primitive cell of 1D XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I) nanowires is represented by a rectangle and 2 XV, 2 YVI, and 2 ZVII atoms are included in the primitive cell. The lattice constants varied from 4.09 to 4.35 Å with a general increase trend with increasing halogen atomic number. As summarized in Table 1, the majority of 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires adopt non-polar arrangement of atoms, such as AsTeI, SbSI, SbSeI, SbTeI, BiSCl, BiSBr, BiSI, BiSeCl, BiSeBr, and BiSeI, which belong to the P21/m space group and exhibit the inversion symmetry. Remarkably, the broken inversion symmetry of the polar structure, represented by 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires (P21 space group), is induced by structural distortion and the polar structure is derived from the displacement between the neighbouring As atom and Se (S) and I atoms.
The stability of 1D nanowires is an important issue to be addressed. To assess the dynamical stability, we then calculate the phonon spectra of 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), there are no appreciable imaginary phonon modes across the whole Brillouin zone, which indicate the excellent dynamical stabilities of these 1D nanowires. Moreover, it is worth noting that similar structures exhibit similar phonon spectra, with the highest frequency modes decreasing with the increase of halogen atomic number. The AIMD simulations are further performed at the room temperature (300 K) for 5 ps with a time interval of 1 fs, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Clearly, the potential total energies stabilize in a small interval, and the geometric structures do not undergo severe structural distortions after 5 ps, implying that these are certainly stable at room temperature. And more notably, when the temperature effect is considered, 1D nanowires may crinkle and curl along the chain direction. To maintain the integrity of the 1D chain structure, the confinement inside carbon nanotubes may be a successful method for such 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires.

3.2 Electronic band structures
Previously, 1D V–VI–VII ternary nanowires have been rarely reported. Herein, the electronic band structures of XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I) nanowires are calculated at HSE06 levels.65 The obtained band structures are displayed in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the corresponding band gaps are also summarized in Table 1 for comparison. The band structures indicate that most of the nanowires possess indirect band gaps, and the locations of the valence band maximum (VBM) are on the path from the Γ–Z line, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the Γ point. Particularly, AsSI and AsSeI nanowires are direct band gap semiconductors. At the HSE06 hybrid functional level, 1D XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I) nanowires possess moderate band gaps in a large range of 1.76–3.16 eV, which can extend the entire visible region. Such band gap ranges indicate that these 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires may effectively absorb visible light and have an important application in photoelectric devices. Meanwhile, semiconductors with moderate band gaps will be promising channel materials for next generation field-effect transistors and are also regarded as an important prerequisite for applications in the field of photocatalysis. Moreover, the band gaps of 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires exhibit an obvious periodic trend, decreasing gradually with increasing atomic number of group VI elements. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), the decrease of the band gaps is due to the overall downward shift of the CBM.

3.3 1D ferroelectricity
Then we focus our attention on the two typical 1D polar nanowires, AsSI and AsSeI, with a P21 space group. As shown in Fig. 1(e), As and S (or Se) atoms are arranged alternately along the z direction and form a torsional chain structure, while I atoms only bond with As atoms in the outer space of nanowires, resulting in the breaking of inversion symmetry in the chain (z) direction. Such a polar structure induced by the lattice distortions can generate spontaneous electric polarizations along the chain direction, manifested as desirable 1D ferroelectric nanowires.
1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires with non-centrosymmetric states exhibit a polar arrangement of the corresponding atoms, which leads to non-coplanarity with respect to the xy-plane in the fully relaxed lattice structure. The corresponding non-polar paraelectric phase of such AsSI and AsSeI ferroelectric nanowires can be constructed by comparing with the other centrosymmetric group V–VI–VII nanowires, as shown in Fig. 1(f). To clearly express the structure distortion, we define the relative distance between As and S/Se (or I) atoms along the chain direction, as characterized by XL and XR in Fig. 4, and the polarization reversal is realized by shifting the S/Se and I atoms relative to the As atoms. The free-energy contour vs. the different displacement values of XL and XR for 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires are plotted in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), which determines that phases B and B′ are indeed the most stable polar phases with minimum energy and they are separated by the energy saddle point phase A. Such A phase exactly corresponds to the paraelectric phase (XL = XR = 0) with the centrosymmetric P21/m space group. Besides, the diagonal direction is the path with lowest energy, along which the polarization reversal is realized to form double-well structures, which strongly implies the existence of ferroelectricity in 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires. The distorted ferroelectric structures B and B′ and undistorted paraelectric structure A are displayed in Fig. 4(c).

Using the CI-NEB method,72 we proceed to calculate the energy barrier bridging the two degenerate ferroelectric states with the opposite direction of polarization, as demonstrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b) for 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires, respectively. The lattice vectors of 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires are fixed to the same values as those of the ferroelectric phase in the entire CI-NEB calculations, which are 4.25 and 4.10 Å, respectively. It is worth noting that considering the variation of lattice vectors in the transition process will further reduce the reversal energy barrier caused by the smaller inner stresses.74–76 The results display that the energy barrier EB of polarization reversal is 278 meV per unit cell (u.c.) for the 1D AsSI nanowire, which is of the same order of magnitude as 1D GeS (122 meV u.c.−1),47 1D SbN (485.70 meV u.c.−1), 1D BiN (225.27 meV u.c.−1),46 and 1D InSeI (97 meV u.c−1).45 Meanwhile, we obtain a relatively small energy barrier EB of 32 meV u.c.−1 in 1D AsSeI, which is comparable to the 1D SnS (39 meV u.c.−1)47 and 2D β-GeS (53.3 meV u.c.−1).48 And the two values of barrier energies are consistent with the lowest energy paths of the free energy contour. Furthermore, nearly ten times difference in energy barriers between AsSI and AsSeI systems is attributed to the different sizes of axial offset for As and S/Se (or I) atoms. The specific displacement values Xmax are summarized in Table 2. To sum up, large atomic displacement requires high energy to reverse the polarization, and vice versa. Generally, the energy barrier is positively correlated with Curie temperature, which manifests that a higher energy barrier usually means a higher Curie temperature to achieve ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition.

Following the modern theory of polarization, we can evaluate spontaneous polarization Ps by using the standard Berry phase calculations.69–71 As shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), the calculated Ps values of 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires are 11.31 × 10−10 and 6.92 × 10−10 C m−1, respectively. Herein, the side area of the nanowires unit cell is considered in the calculations in order to facilitate the comparison of Ps with those of the reported 2D layered systems. The side area is defined as the product of distance between two I atoms in the y direction and length of nanowires in the z direction. Such large Ps values in 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires are comparable to those of 1D SbN (14.12 × 10−10 C m−1) and BiN (11.63 × 10−10 C m−1) nanowires,46 and obviously larger than those of most typical 1D ferroelectric nanowires, such as GeS (5.70 × 10−10 C m−1),47 SnS (4.90 × 10−10 C m−1),47 and InSeI (3.89 × 10−10 C m−1),45 manifesting that AsSI nanowires could be an excellent candidate for 1D ferroelectric materials.
The introduction of strain in low-dimensional materials can effectively modulate the physical properties in a wide range. Herein, the external strain  along the axial direction is applied to 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires, where c and c0 are the lattice constants along the z direction for the strained and unstrained structures, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 5(e) and (f), the external tensile strain can effectively tune the spontaneous polarization and the reversal energy barrier. For 1D AsSI (AsSeI) nanowires, the Ps can be tuned from 11.31 × 10−10 (6.92 × 10−10) to 12.46 × 10−10 (10.04 × 10−10) C m−1, and the EB is regulated from 278 (32) to 636 (221) meV under the small tensile strains (ε = 0.00–0.06). Obviously, one can apply a tensile strain to enlarge the values of EB and Ps. Such effective regulation of ferroelectricity is of great significance for their wide application prospect. To sum up, 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires provide a promising platform to study 1D ferroelectric physics and extend the family of 1D ferroelectric materials. However, except AsSI and AsSeI, other 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires lack obvious ferroelectricity due to the presence of inversion symmetry (P21/m space group).
3.4 Carrier mobility
Carrier mobility is one of the critical factors that greatly affects and even determines the efficiency of devices. Thus, the carrier mobilities along the z direction of 1D XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I) nanowires are systematically calculated at room temperature (300 K) using the deformation potential (DP) theory.77 We describe the carrier mobility of the 1D system by the following formula:78,79 (2)where e, ℏ, kB, and T express the electron charge, reduced Planck constant, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. C1D is the elastic constant described as  for the 1D system, where E is the total energy, ε is the applied uniaxial strain, and c0 is the optimized lattice constant, respectively. E1 represents the deformation potential constant of the VBM for holes and CBM for electrons, which can be calculated as , where Eedge is the energy of the valence (or conduction) band edge. Deformation potential constant is calculated by the linear fitting of the CBM (VBM) versus strain and 1D elastic constant is obtained by a quadratic fitting of the total energy versus strain. The effective mass m* is defined by the second derivative with respect to the band dispersion to . The effective mass of carriers at the VBM and CBM is acquired by parabolic band approximation. m0 refers to the free electron mass. The fitting results of parameters mentioned above and the calculated mobilities of electrons and holes are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. S4, S5 (ESI†).

As listed in Table 3, most 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires possess considerable electron mobilities, which are one or two orders of magnitude larger than hole mobilities. Especially, the electron mobilities of 5 nanowires, AsSI, AsTeI, SbSeI, SbTeI and BiSeI, reach the magnitude of 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 and even up to 322.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BiSeI, indicating that these nanowires can be potential candidates for high-speed nano-electronic devices. Such mobilities of electrons are superior to those of most reported 1D materials, such as InSeI,80 SbSeI16 and Sn2S3,17 and comparable to that of 1D Sn2Se3.17 Besides, it can be analyzed that the higher electron mobility can be attributed to their relatively smaller values of effective mass and deformation potential constant for electrons.
3.5 Band edge alignments
The band gaps of 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires are in a large range of 1.76–3.16 eV, almost extending the entire visible region. Thus, such materials may exhibit promising light-related properties and have potential applications in photocatalytic and photovoltaic devices.2,21 Besides suitable band gap, the band edge alignment is the other basic need for the optical applications. Then we examine the band edge alignments of all the 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires and the corresponding CBMs and VBMs aligned with vacuum level correction are shown in Fig. 6(a). For comparison, the reduction potential of protons (H+/H2) and the oxidation potential of water (O2/H2O) at pH = 0 and pH =7 are shown in Fig. 6(a). From the band edge alignments, we can qualitatively evaluate the capacities of photocatalytic water splitting of the 1D nanowires.
 Fig. 6  (a) The calculated energy positions of the CBM and VBM for 1D XVYVIZVII (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I) nanowires relative to the vacuum level. The black and pink horizontal dashed lines represent redox potentials of water at pH = 0 and pH = 7, respectively. (b) Calculated absorption coefficients of partial 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires at the HSE06 level: AsSI, AsSeI, AsTeI, SbSeI, SbTeI, and BiSeI. The vertical dashed lines represent the visible region. 
As shown in Fig. 6(a), at pH = 0, the band edges of all the 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires can meet the thermodynamic requirement of photocatalytic water splitting very well, namely, the CBMs are higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV at pH = 0) and the VBMs are lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (−5.67 eV at pH = 0). This indicates that 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires may be useful photocatalysts for water splitting and the redox reactions can proceed spontaneously under an enough driving force. However, at pH = 7, the reduction potential of H+/H2 and the oxidation potential of O2/H2O will rise to −4.03 and −5.26 eV, respectively. Then, most 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires still fulfill the requirement of band edge alignment for photocatalytic water splitting, except AsTeI, SbTeI and BiSeBr nanowires. The CBMs of these three nanowires are slightly lower than the reduction potential of H+/H2 at pH = 7, which means that the hydrogen reduction half reaction cannot proceed in the 1D AsTeI, SbTeI and BiSeBr nanowires, but the water oxidation half reaction in such materials is still feasible.
Moreover, the electric polarization and ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition in the 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires may be important for promoting photocatalytic water splitting. The corresponding mechanisms of ferroelectric photocatalysis have also been discussed in 2D AgBiP2Se6 monolayers and 1D MoSSe nanotubes.3,81 However, the large band gap of 3.16 eV for the AsSI nanowire is unfavorable for visible absorption, which is a barrier to photocatalytic water splitting.
Thus, considering the suitable band gap and band edge alignment, the AsSeI nanowire may be the most promising 1D ferroelectric photocatalyst for water splitting.
3.6 Optical absorptions
The moderate band gaps may endow the 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires with strong power to harvest solar light including the ultraviolet and visible light, which gives rise to photoexcited electron–hole pairs. To visually demonstrate light capture performance, herein, we investigate the optical absorption ability by calculating the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function as determined by the HSE06 functional. The results are displayed in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. S6(a) (ESI†), which are calculated by the following equation:82 (3)where ε1 and ε2 represent the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively; c is the velocity of light.
The optical absorption coefficients of the nanowires mentioned above can reach up to 105 cm−1, comparable to those of bulk perovskites and rock salt.83,84 The absorption edges start from the visible region and mostly concentrate in the ultraviolet region, exhibiting outstanding optical adsorption properties to efficiently harvest sunlight, which would facilitate their utilization as photocatalysts for water splitting. Furthermore, the band gaps show a periodic trend of decreasing gradually with increasing atomic number of group VI elements. Thus, the optical absorption capacity in the visible region of 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires is remarkably improved with the increasing atomic number of group VI elements. Because1D AsTeI and SbTeI nanowires possess the small band gaps of 1.76 and 1.85 eV, they exhibit the strong optical absorption capacity in the visible region. Besides, as shown in Fig. 6(b), the ferroelectric phase of the AsSeI nanowire also exhibits strong optical absorption in the visible region, while the optical absorption capacity of the ferroelectric phase of the AsSI nanowire is far less impressive because of its large band gap. However, the optical absorption peak generates an obvious redshift and reaches far into the visible region when the ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition occurs in AsSI and AsSeI nanowires, as shown in Fig. S6(b) (ESI†). Such redshifts of optical absorption are attributed to the prominent changes in structures and band gaps during the ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition process. The results imply that the ferroelectric switch or phase transition can effectively regulate the optical adsorption of 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires. The strong capacity of visible absorption may endow the 1D paraelectric AsSI and AsSeI nanowires with promising applications in photovoltaic conversion and photocatalytic devices under special conditions.
4. Conclusions
Based on the quasi-1D experimental bulk crystals, we constructed a series of 1D XVYVIZVII ternary nanowires (X = As, Sb, Bi; Y = S, Se, Te; Z = Cl, Br, I). We theoretically explore the stability, electronic band structures, partial ferroelectricity, carrier mobilities, band edge alignments, and optical absorptions of these 1D nanowires. All these 1D nanowires can be easily exfoliated from the bulk counterparts and possess excellent dynamical and thermal stability. The range of band gaps (1.76–3.16 eV) of 12 nanowires almost covers the entire visible region, and the highest electron carrier mobility reaches up to 322.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1D BiSeI nanowires. Remarkably, the special non-centrosymmetric structure endows 1D AsSI and AsSeI nanowires with promising 1D ferroelectricity. The large spontaneous polarizations Ps of 11.31 × 10−10 and 6.92 × 10−10 C m−1 are obtained in AsSI and AsSeI nanowires, respectively, which are much larger than those of the reported 1D and 2D materials. Furthermore, the moderate band gaps, suitable band edge alignments, and excellent optical absorptions of such 1D XVYVIZVII nanowires indicate their potential applications as functional photocatalysts for water splitting at the neutral and acidic environments. Our findings broaden the family of 1D materials and reveal their great potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric devices. It is much expected that these 1D nanowires predicted in this work would be synthesized in experiments.
