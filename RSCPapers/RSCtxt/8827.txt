    , Accepted 23rd March 2023First published on 24th March 2023AbstractCsPbI3 as a newly emerging semiconductor material has displayed tremendous prospects for optoelectronic applications. However, the poor photoactive black-phase stability limits its further application. In this work, we introduce transition metal nickel ion (Ni2+) as a B-site substitute into CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) to stabilize their black phase. The optimized CsPbI3 NCs film presents a record photoactive black-phase stability time of 54 hours under the conditions of 85 °C and 85% relative humidity, over 108 times that of the undoped film. Furthermore, the Ni2+-doped CsPbI3 NCs solutions maintain bright red emission after vigorous stirring with an equal volume of water for 200 hours (the undoped solution is almost completely quenched), and also show bright red emission after being stored in the air for 200 days (the undoped solution is completely quenched within 43 days). Meanwhile, the photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 31.48% for undoped CsPbI3 NCs to 87.69% for doped Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs. We suggest that these outstanding stabilities and excellent optical properties can mainly be attributed to the increased defect formation energy after rational Ni doping and lattice adjustment by partial replacement of Pb2+ with small-sized Ni2+. Our work provides guidance for the synthesis of phase-stabilized CsPbI3 NCs and an insight into the effect of B-site doping in a perovskite lattice, providing a promising pathway to construct stable and efficient photoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have emerged as a class of ground-breaking photovoltaic materials owing to their outstanding photoelectronic performances over the past decade.1–4 Compared with organic-inorganic halide perovskites, all-inorganic perovskites CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, or mixed Cl/Br/I) achieve enhanced moisture and thermal stability due to the absence of volatile organic cations.5,6 Among these Cs-based lead halide perovskites, black-phase CsPbI3 has the most suitable bandgap for photovoltaic applications;7,8 thus it has attracted the extensive attention of researchers around the world. However, poor phase stability limits its further application. The black phase of CsPbI3 would convert into a more thermodynamically stable orthorhombic yellow phase and lose its excellent photoelectric performance in an ambient environment.9–11
Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t = (RA + RX)/√2(RB + RX), where RA, RB, and RX are the ionic radius of the A-site cation, B-site cation and X-site anion, respectively) is usually used to predict the lattice stability of a perovskite structure. As for CsPbI3, the tolerance factor is only 0.807, which is much lower than the ideal value of 1 of the cubic phase. The lattice undergoes a greater extent of rotation and distortion of [PbI6]4− octahedra, resulting in a phase transition from the black phase (where the [PbI6]4− octahedra are corner-shared) to the yellow phase (where the [PbI6]4− octahedra are edge-shared).12 Obviously, partial substitution in the lattice can modulate the perovskite structure, influence the tolerance factor, then map to stability. According to the formula for the tolerance factor, substitution with a larger A-site ion, smaller B-site ion and X-site ion can increase the tolerance factor t. Cs is already the largest-size element of Group IA without radioactivity. Introducing smaller X-site ions of Cl or Br would induce an undesirable enlarged bandgap, which would theoretically result in a reduced power conversion efficiency. Actually, the bandgap of CsPbI3 (1.73 eV) is already larger than the optimum (1.34 eV) for a single-junction solar cell.13 Excitingly, previous experiments have shown that B-site doping with a smaller size of cation can stabilize black-phase CsPbI3 without obviously increasing the bandgap.5,12,14,15
To stabilize black-phase CsPbI3, some B-site ions have been employed over these years. Hu et al. introduced Bi3+ into CsPbI3 to stabilize the black phase and found that there is no obvious change in diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of a Bi-doped CsPbI3 film after storing it in ambient air at 25 °C with 55% relative humidity (RH) for 144 h (the control sample began to degrade after 48 h).16 Then Yao et al. demonstrated more stable Sr-doped CsPbI3 NCs, and the doped NCs films could be stabilized over 20 days at 20 ± 10 °C with 30–40% RH.17 Zhang et al. found that Zn-doped CsPbI3 NCs films still showed bright red emission after 10 days of storage in an ambient environment with 20–30% RH (the emission of pristine CsPbI3 NCs film had absolutely disappeared after this time).5 Besides ion doping, strategies in terms of synthesis of quantum dots (QDs), additive engineering and alloying were applied to enhance the stability of CsPbI3.10,18–20 However, their performances under high humidity and temperature have not been studied.
As is well known, the 85 °C/85% RH damp-heat test (i.e. an aging test under 85 °C and 85% RH, the standard lifetime-assessment tests of the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 61215:2016) is an important part of product testing in the photovoltaic field. However, up to now, most stability testing of lead halide perovskites was carried out under low humidity at room temperature and few studies have conducted a phase stability test under high humidity of over 50% RH, probably owing to the poor humidity resistance of black-phase CsPbI3.16,18,20–22 Therefore, further improvement in stability (especially under high humidity) is an essential step toward the commercial application for CsPbI3 all-inorganic perovskites. The transition metal nickel Ni has a small-sized ionic radius (0.69 Å, the Pb2+ radius is 1.19 Å); thus the phase stability of CsPbI3 can theoretically be improved by reducing the rotation and tilt of [BI6]4− octahedra after the partial substitution of Ni atoms in B sites.12 Previous studies have shown that Ni doping in CsPbX3 NCs has a positive effect on improving optical and stability properties.14,23,24 However, insights into the Ni-doping-induced enhancement of the black-phase stability of CsPbI3 are still elusive. Furthermore, the phase transition behaviors of CsPbI3 films under both high humidity and temperature are rarely investigated.
In this work, we introduced Ni2+ into CsPbI3 NCs to significantly increase its black-phase stability (Fig. 1a). An optimized Ni-doping concentration and thus a more robust lattice structure was obtained by tuning the precursor ratio and reaction temperature. Then we discuss in detail the enhanced optical performances. Specifically, we investigated the black-phase stability of CsPbI3 NCs films under the conditions of 85 °C and 85% RH. We further studied the stabilities of CsPbI3 NCs solutions and films towards air and water. Finally, insights into Ni doping in the perovskite lattice were investigated through theoretical calculation. Our study provides a feasible and effective approach to improve the stability of all inorganic perovskites towards high damp-heat conditions, water and air, and paves the way to construct photoelectronic devices with high efficiency and stability.

Results and discussion
Before we synthesized the Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs, we found that, although CsPbI3 NCs can be obtained through a hot injection method as reported in a previous article,25 it is a challenge to introduce Ni2+ into the perovskite lattice, especially with a high level of doping, owing to the much higher activation energy for the vacancy-mediated diffusion of B-site components compared with the A-site and X-site.26,27 Generally, increasing the concentration of the precursor and the reaction temperature can promote the doping process. However, the precursor NiI2 powders were difficult to dissolve in the reaction solution. To overcome this issue and enable a high doping level of Ni2+, besides the commonly used ligands of oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm), we introduced trioctylphosphine (TOP) to assist in dissolving NiI2 powders. Furthermore, we raised the reaction temperature to dissolve the precursors well and increase the doping concentration.
Herein, we have successfully synthesized Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs with different doping concentrations by varying the conditions of reaction temperature and NiI2/PbI2 loading ratio in the precursor solutions. Fig. 1a is a schematic diagram of Ni doping in the CsPbI3 lattice. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) to quantify the Ni concentration in the obtained NCs. Then the products were named Ni-x% CsPbI3 NCs according to their actual molar ratio of Ni/Pb. We found that the incorporated concentration of Ni increases from 1.25% to 5.28% as the reaction temperature and NiI2/PbI2 loading ratio increase (Table S1†). All the samples can be matched with the standard pattern of cubic phase CsPbI3 with the pmm space group by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 1b). We noted that the peaks shifted to higher angles with the increase in Ni-doping concentration. Since Ni2+ (0.69 Å) is much smaller than Pb2+ (1.19 Å), the partial substitution of Pb2+ by Ni2+ would result in lattice contraction. However, the substitution ratio of Ni/Pb is low, and the shift angle is small. It is worth noting that the undoped sample showed some additional diffraction peaks between 22° and 28° (2θ) (Fig. 1b and S1†), which can be assigned to two intermediate phases (β-phase and γ-phase). These intermediate phases of CsPbI3 NCs were also observed in other reported works.15,28 Those additional diffraction peaks from intermediate phases became weaker after Ni doping, and were no longer observed when the doping level increased to a certain range (Ni-3.65% and Ni-4.42% CsPbI3 NCs), which indicates that it is feasible to obtain the cubic phase by introducing an appropriate amount of Ni element.
The morphologies of these NCs with different Ni-doping concentrations were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found that Ni doping has no evident impact on the morphology of the products, but has an obvious effect on the crystal size and size uniformity of CsPbI3 NCs (Fig. S2 and S3†). The edge length decreased from ∼15 nm of undoped CsPbI3 NCs to ∼7 nm of Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs (Table S1†), and excess Ni doping could lead to a less uniform size distribution (Fig. S3c and d†), which probably results from the suppression effect of high Ni2+ concentration on the NC growth process.29 We will discuss this later in detail in the theoretical calculation section. The Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NC sample presented the smallest crystal size and narrowest size distribution among all the samples (Fig. 1c). The lattice constant of Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs calculated from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image was 0.63 nm (Fig. 1d), which matches well with the lattice spacing of the (100) plane. Meanwhile the individual spots in the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) clearly showed its single-crystalline nature. Another example of Ni-1.25% CsPbI3 NCs also displayed a single-crystalline nature (Fig. S4†). Furthermore, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping indicated the uniform distribution of elements of Cs, Pb, I and Ni in the doped NCs (Fig. 1e and f). The atomic ratios of Cs, Pb, I and Ni were measured to be 13.08%, 21.38%, 64.66% and 0.88%, respectively (Fig. S5†). The calculated atomic ratio of Ni/Pb was 4.10% here, close to the value of 3.65% measured by ICP-MS. The slight difference in value may be due to testing discrepancies between different instruments. All these measurements revealed that the Ni element has been successfully incorporated into the CsPbI3 perovskite lattice.
To further characterize the existence of Ni dopant and electronic states of constituent elements in the CsPbI3 NCs, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. XPS survey spectra revealed clear signals of Cs, Pb and I elements in undoped and doped NCs (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the presence of Ni2+ was confirmed in the high-resolution spectrum by a typical signal of Ni 2p (Fig. 2b). The weak signal of Ni 2p is mainly attributed to the relatively small amount of Ni compared with other elements. We note that Cs 3d peaks (Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2), Pb 4f peaks (Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2) and I 3d peaks (I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2) of doped NCs showed a similar trend of shifting to higher binding energy in comparison with the undoped NCs (Fig. 2c–e), which indicated a modified chemical environment and stronger ion interactions between Cs, Pb and I after Ni incorporation and thus implied a more robust lattice structure.30

After confirming the successful doping of Ni, we systematically investigated the effect of Ni doping on optical properties. Fig. 3a displays digital photographs of undoped and doped CsPbI3 NC colloidal solution under white light and ultraviolet (UV) light. All the samples showed a reddish brown color under white light and showed bright red emission under 365 nm UV light, and Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs showed the brightest emission among all the samples. Although absorption bands and photoluminescence (PL) peaks shifted slightly compared with the undoped CsPbI3 NCs, no new peaks were found after Ni doping (Fig. 3c). This demonstrated the weak influence of Ni doping on the electronic structure of the host CsPbI3, consistent with previous reports.14,24 The slight shift of absorption bands and PL peaks can be attributed to the variation of the bandgap, which was controlled by the size-dependent quantum confinement effect.18,23 Specifically, absorption bands and PL peaks were blue shifted, then red shifted as the crystal size decreased from 15 nm for undoped CsPbI3 NCs to 7 nm for Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs, then increased to 10 nm for Ni-5.28% CsPbI3 NCs (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the PL intensity of CsPbI3 NCs was observably enhanced after Ni doping and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) improved from 31.48% for undoped CsPbI3 NCs to 87.69% for Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs. However, a further increase in doping concentration led to a lower PLQY (Fig. 3d). A previous study revealed that Ni doping decreased defects, resulting in an improved short-range order of the CsPb(Cl/Br)3 lattices, and thus an enhanced PLQY.24 Our theoretical calculations suggested that a suitable Ni-doping concentration causes an increased defect formation energy, while excess Ni doping results in a decreased defect formation energy (Table 1). These findings matched our experimental results, where the values of PLQY increased at first, then decreased with an increase in Ni-doping concentration. These indicated that Ni-doping concentration should be controlled within a reasonable range to obtain a high-level PLQY value.

To further investigate the photophysical properties of these Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement was conducted with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Overall, the PL kinetics of doped NCs were faster than those of undoped NCs (Fig. 3e and Table S2†). This can be attributed to the size-dependent quantum confinement effect, where enhanced exciton binding energy accelerates the recombination rate of excitons with a reduction in NC size, resulting in faster PL kinetics.17 Thus reduced NC size results in decreased PL lifetimes (Table S2†). Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs have the smallest crystal size and fastest PL decay. We note that the TRPL spectrum of Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs could be fitted well with a single-exponential function, while the other spectra required a bi-exponential function to be fitted, which suggests lower defects in Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs.31 Therefore, suitable Ni doping decreased the defects in the NCs, enabling a more ideal lattice and better stability. Furthermore, we calculated the radiative and non-radiative decay rates based on the average lifetimes and PLQYs (Table S2†). We found that the radiative decay rate increases from 3.88 μs−1 of undoped NCs to 46.31 μs−1 of Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs, which indicates the positive effect of Ni doping on promoting radiative recombination and enables the high PLQY of Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs.
As we all know, a damp-heat test under 85 °C and 85% relative humidity is an extreme test in the photovoltaic field. Up to now, few studies have done a stability test under such high-temperature and high-humidity conditions, probably owing to the poor phase stability of black-phase CsPbI3. To evaluate the endurance capacity of NCs films at high temperature and high humidity, and consider the practical application needs of solid films in the fields of photovoltaic devices, light emitting diodes and so on, we carried out the 85 °C/85% RH damp-heat test for the NCs films. Fig. 4a shows the time-resolved color changes of CsPbI3 NCs films with different Ni-doping concentrations under white light and UV light, where a color change from black to yellow under white light represents the phase transition from black phase to yellow phase. It is found that the Ni-doped NCs films displayed significantly enhanced stability under an 85 °C/85% RH damp-heat test. The undoped CsPbI3 NCs film existed stably for around 30 min, suffered a phase transition from black phase to yellow phase at 40 min, and finally completely transformed to yellow phase at 14 h. More details are presented in Fig. S6.† In sharp contrast, Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs film underwent no change for at least 54 h, showing significantly enhanced stability of over 108 times compared with the undoped film. Meanwhile, both Ni-3.65% and Ni-4.42% CsPbI3 NCs film performed with a retention ratio of over 95% for the black phase at 100 h and over 70% at 147 h (Fig. 4b and S6†). However, a further increase in Ni-doping concentration resulted in decreased phase stability. The Ni-5.28% CsPbI3 NCs film retained just 55% black phase at 100 h. In addition, after the 85 °C/85% RH damp-heat test of Ni-doped NCs films, the pure orthorhombic phase δ-CsPbI3 was observed and no additional phase was detected, revealing that only the phase transition had occurred without any decomposition or new components being introduced (Fig. 4d). Compared with reported studies,5,8,10,16–18,21,32–35 our work has made an enormous improvement in the stability of CsPbI3 NCs films in both a high-humidity and high-temperature environment (Fig. 4c).

Note that ambient temperature in the references was considered to be 25 °C. (d) XRD patterns of Ni-5.28% CsPbI3 NCs films before and after an 85 °C/85% RH damp-heat stability test. 
We further investigated the water stability of undoped and doped NCs. The NCs were dispersed in hexane, forming a colloidal solution. The doped Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs solution still showed bright red emission even after mixing with an equal volume of water by intense stirring for over 200 h (Fig. S7†). More excitingly, a drop coated film of Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs can exist stably under water at room temperature (Fig. S8†). After completely soaking in water for 100 h, the change in the emission properties was negligible (Fig. S9†). This demonstrated the outstanding stability and excellent performance for resisting water of CsPbI3 NCs after Ni doping.
The air stability of undoped and doped NCs was also investigated. The PL of undoped NCs solution disappeared completely after 43 days, while the Ni-doped NCs solution performed with relatively high PLQY (36.16% for Ni-4.42%, 25.27% for Ni-5.28%). More excitingly, both Ni-4.42% and Ni-5.52% CsPbI3 NCs still retained bright emission and a comparable PLQY (12.16% for Ni-4.42%, 13.36% for Ni-5.52%) after storage for 200 days (Fig. S10†). This evidence showed the outstanding phase stability of Ni-doped samples in ambient conditions.
Afterwards, we performed theoretical calculations to investigate the effects of Ni doping on the crystal structure and stability of CsPbI3. The doped Ni could possibly occupy an interstitial site (Nii), replace a Cs (NiCs), or replace a Pb (NiPb). The formation energies of these defects were calculated and compared. As shown in Fig. S11a,† NiPb was more likely to form compared with NiCs or Nii in the available chemical potential region of CsPbI3, suggesting NiPb was the dominant form of Ni atom in the perovskite lattice, which is consistent with what we expected and designed. Previous studies showed that, in a Pb-rich environment as in our experiments, the formation energy of VPb (vacancy of Pb) is larger than VCs (vacancy of Cs) or VX (vacancy of X),36 which indicates that VCs and VX were the dominant atom vacancy defects in the CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) lattice. The changes in defect formation energy (ΔH) before and after Ni doping were calculated to explore the effects of Ni on vacancy formation. Our calculated results showed that, with an Ni/Pb doping concentration of 3.1%, the formation energies of VCs and VI increased by +169 meV and +79 meV, respectively, which indicated that the formation of Cs and I vacancies was suppressed (Table 1). ΔH(VPb) presented a small negative value of −9 meV, suggesting the facility of forming a small amount of Pb vacancies, which assists in the replacement process of Pb2+ by Ni2+. When the Ni/Pb ratio was increased to 10%, ΔH(VCs) and ΔH(VI) changed to −65 meV and −208 meV, which suggests that it is conducive to the formation of Cs and I vacancies in this situation. While ΔH(VPb) is only −2 meV, which can be ignored. All these results indicated that a suitable Ni-doping concentration can suppress the formation of a vacancy, while excess Ni doping would have the opposite effect. Hence, the substitution level of Ni atoms should be controlled in a certain range to suppress the formation of vacancy defects and thus form a more robust lattice against moisture and heat load. All these results were consistent with our experiments, which confirmed that the phase stability and optical properties of CsPbI3 NCs were closely related to Ni-doping concentration. In addition, we note that the crystal formation energy was closely related to Ni-doping concentration, which increased linearly with the Ni/Pb-doping level (Fig. S11b†). This indicated that Ni doping can suppress the grow rate of CsPbI3 NCs, leading to a smaller grain size, which was consistent with our synthesis results. Under the same reaction temperature of 170 °C, the average grain size decreased from ∼15 nm for undoped CsPbI3 NCs to ∼7 nm for Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs (Fig. S2 and S3†). As a previous study reported,37 a size effect might play a role in phase stability to some extent. In our case, the undoped CsPbI3 NCs and Ni-1.25% CsPbI3 NCs were similar in size, but there are significant differences in their stabilities (Fig. 4a and S6†). A similar phenomenon occurred between Ni-1.25% CsPbI3 NCs and Ni-5.28% CsPbI3 NCs (Fig. 4a and S6†). This illustrated that the significantly improved black-phase stability of CsPbI3 NCs could mainly be attributed to Ni2+ doping in the size range of our study.
We also prepared Ni2+-doped CsPbI3 polycrystalline bulk films by classic spin-coating methods. These undoped and Ni2+-doped CsPbI3 films performed with similar absorption band edge and emission peaks (Fig. S12†). Their XRD patterns all matched well with γ-CsPbI3 (Fig. S13†). This was consistent with a previous report.11 Most importantly, the Ni2+-doped CsPbI3 films showed much higher thermal stability compared with undoped film (Fig. S14 and S15†). All these results indicated that both the CsPbI3 NCs and bulk CsPbI3 films can be efficiently stabilized by Ni2+ doping.
Based on all the above experimental and calculation results, the insights into the highly photoactive black-phase stability of CsPbI3 nanocrystals towards air, moisture, water and damp-heat conditions of 85 °C and 85% relative humidity can be summarized as follows: (1) B-site partial substitution of Pb2+ by Ni2+ notably increased the defect formation energy of CsPbI3, contributing a less defective lattice. Meanwhile, the iodine-rich condition (Fig. S5†) played a suppressive role in the formation of iodine vacancy defects; (2) the introduced small-sized Ni2+ modulated the perovskite lattice at the atomic level, reducing the rotation and tilt of [BI6]4− octahedra and improving the tolerance factor to a more ideal value. All these meant fewer defects and a robust lattice, resulting in high phase stability after rational Ni doping.
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized CsPbI3 NCs with different doping levels of Ni2+ by a modified hot injection method. The obtained Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs films showed remarkably improved black-phase stability, and the optimized doped NCs film presented a record stability time of 54 h (over 108 times that of the undoped sample), and exhibited a retention ratio of over 95% for the black phase at 100 h under the damp-heat conditions of 85 °C/85% RH. In addition, the doped NCs showed excellent stability against air (>200 days for NCs solution) and water (>200 h for NCs solution and >100 h for NCs film). Excitingly, the Ni-doped NCs not only demonstrated excellent black-phase stability, but also displayed a significantly enhanced PLQY (87.69% for Ni-3.65% CsPbI3 NCs vs. 31.48% for undoped CsPbI3 NCs). We suggested this excellent phase stability was closely related to the less defective lattice after Ni doping and lattice modulation by partial substitution of Pb2+ with small-sized Ni2+. These outstanding figures for Ni substitution will greatly expand the practical applications of CsPbI3 NCs. This work provides a promising pathway to fabricate highly phase-stabilized and efficient perovskite solar cells and other photoelectronic devices.
Experimental
Materials
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%, Alfa Aesar), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%, Aladdin), nickel iodide (NiI2, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar), oleic acid (OA, 90%, Sigma-Aldrich), oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%, Acros), tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP, 97%, Strem), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%, Sigma-Aldrich), n-hexane (>99%, Aladdin), methyl acetate (MeAc, ≥99%, Aladdin). All chemicals were used directly without further purification.
Preparation of Cs-oleate
First, 0.2 g of Cs2CO3, 0.7 ml of OA along with 10 ml of ODE were added into a 25 ml 3-neck flask and stirred for 1 h at 120 °C under vacuum to remove water. And then a 3-neck flask was heated to 150 °C under an N2 environment until Cs2CO3 had completely reacted with OA. The final solution was kept at 120 °C under an N2 atmosphere for the following synthesis.
Synthesis of CsPbI3 NCs and Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs
For the synthesis of CsPbI3 NCs, 92.2 mg of PbI2, 5 ml of ODE were loaded together into a 25 ml 3-neck flask, and dried at 120 °C for 1 h under vacuum conditions. Then the dried 1 ml of OA and 1 ml of OAm were injected into the flask and the temperature was raised to 170 °C under an N2 atmosphere. Next, 0.4 ml of Cs-oleate was injected quickly, and the reaction solution was cooled by a water bath after 5 seconds. A CsPbI3 NCs colloidal solution with a dark red color was finally obtained. For a typical synthesis process of Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs, 92.2 mg of PbI2, 187.5 mg of NiI2, 5 ml of ODE and 1 ml of TOP were loaded together into a 25 ml 3-neck flask; the other steps were similar to the synthesis process for CsPbI3 NCs. The Ni-doping concentration was tuned by varying the NiI2/PbI2 molar ratio from 0:1 to 3:1 in the precursor and the reaction temperature from 170 °C to 200 °C, CsPbI3 NCs with different Ni-doping concentrations (Ni/Pb ratio from 0 to 5.28%) were finally obtained in our work.
Isolation and purification of CsPbI3 NCs and Ni-doped CsPbI3 NCs
After cooling to room temperature, the crude solution was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 8000 rpm and washed twice with a certain amount of hexane. Note that some methyl acetate was added in the centrifugal process in order to isolate small-sized NCs.
Composition, structure and morphology characterization
ICP-MS (Agilent 7800) was performed to determine the doping concentrations of Ni element in the final products. Powder XRD patterns of the products were obtained by using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source. TEM images with different magnifications were performed on a JEOL JEM-F200 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a JEOL JEM-2100 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Optical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a fiber optical spectrometer (PG2000 pro, Shanghai Ideaoptics). PL spectra were measured using a spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments) with a xenon lamp. PLQYs were obtained with an FLS980 equipped with an integration sphere. TRPL spectra were collected using an FLS980 spectrometer equipped with a 340 nm excitation light source.
XPS characterization
XPS curves were recorded using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha; the operating voltage was 12 kV. C 1s (284.8 eV) was performed to calibrate the binding energy.
The 85 °C/85% RH damp-heat stability test
In order to compare the significant differences in stability, all NC films were first fixed on a microslide. Then the microslide was exposed to an atmosphere with a temperature of 85 °C and relative humidity of 85%. The high temperature and humidity were provided by hot plate and a commercial humidifier, respectively.
Theoretical calculation
All calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).38 The core–valence interaction was described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method,39 and the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof was used.40 The wavefunctions were expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a 300 eV cutoff. Structure relaxation was stopped when the force on each atom was smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. A 2 × 2 × 2 orthorhombic supercell of CsPbI3 with 160 atoms was adopted. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a gamma-centered 2 × 2 × 1 k-grid.
The crystal formation energy was calculated withEform = (Etot − NCsECs − NPbEPb − NIEI − NNiENi)/Ntotwhere Etot is the total energy of the Ni-doped supercell, ECs, EPb, EI, and ENi are the atomic energies of the corresponding elemental solids. Ntot is the total number of atoms in the supercell, and NCs, NPb, NI, and NNi are the numbers of atoms of different elements.
The defect formation energy of a defect α with a charge state q is defined as:41  where E(α, q) and E(host) are the total energies of the defective and pristine materials in a supercell, respectively. EVBM is the host VBM energy, and EF is the Fermi energy referenced to VBM. ni is the number of atoms i exchanged with the reservoirs to create the defects in the host. Ei is the atomic energy of the corresponding elemental solid. The chemical potential μi involves the effects of growth environments. Thermodynamic equilibrium growth requires that μi is negative and limited within a finite region, so that there are no elemental precipitates or secondary phases. For the vacancy defects, the most important quantity is the change in defect formation energy before and after Ni doping. This can be obtained from the difference between Edoped(α, q) and Eundoped(α, q), without explicit calculations of ΔHf. Here we considered fully ionized vacancies, namely VCs+, VPb2+, and VI−, since their defect levels are quite shallow.
