    , Accepted 2nd September 2015First published on 4th September 2015AbstractA series of cobaloxime complexes, [Co(III)(dmgH)2(py-m-X)Cl] (dmgH = dimethylglyoxime, py-m-X = meta-substituted pyridine, X = COOH (2), COOCH3 (3), CH2CH2COOH (6), and CH2CH2COOCH3 (7)), and [Co(III)(dmgH)2(py-p-X)Cl], (py-p-X = para-substituted pyridine, X = COOH (4) and COOCH3 (5)), were synthesized and their photocatalytic H2 production activities were compared in an artificial photosynthesis system containing a xanthene dye Eosin Y as the photosensitizer (PS) and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reductant (SR) in CH3CN/H2O (1:1, pH = 7.5). Irrespective of substitution by an electron-donating or electron withdrawing group, the photocatalytic H2 production activities of 2–7 are all higher than that of [Co(III)(dmgH)2(py)Cl] (1). Importantly, meta-substitution is more efficient than para-substitution, and COOH is more efficient than COOCH3, in enhancing the photocatalytic activities. 6 showed the highest activity among the examined complexes. The –CH2CH2– chain linking COOH and pyridine might play a role in the promising performance of 6, which makes the proton relay via interaction between COOH and dmgH possible. This work may open new avenues for developing more efficient cobaloxime-based H2 evolution catalysts (HERs).
Introduction
As a promising solution for energy crisis and climate changes, H2 generation via water splitting has been intensively and extensively studied for decades.1 Both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic H2 evolution catalysts (HERs) of high efficiency and low cost are highly pursued, making the first row transition metal complexes the focus of related research. Among them, cobaloxime catalysts are particularly attractive by virtue of their high activity and easy preparation.2 Lehn and coworkers reported the first H2-production artificial photosynthesis (AP) system using Co(dmgH)2(dmgH = dimethylglyoxime) as a HER, Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer (PS), and triethanolamine (TEOA) or triisopropanolamine (TIPOA) as a sacrificial reductant (SR).3 Since then, lots of cobaloxime-based AP systems have been scrutinized, and many viable PSs, including Pt,4 Re,5 Ru,6 Ir,7 and Au-based8 complexes and metal free organic dyes,9 have been developed. Meanwhile, efficient electrocatalytic H2 production based on cobaloxime complexes was also realized.10 Irrespective of photocatalysis or electrocatalysis, it is generally recognized that cobaloxime complexes are reduced to Co(I) or Co(0) species at first, and then protonated to form the key intermediate Co(III)H or Co(II)H, by which H2 generation may be achieved via either protonolysis or bimetallic reaction.11 As a result, the catalytic activity is highly dependent on the reduction potentials and pKa values of these oxidation states of the cobaloxime complexes,12 and their tuning via ligand modification has been explored to optimize the H2 generation activity.10 It was found that introducing an electron-donating substituent in the axial pyridine ligand of a cobaloxime complex may enhance its electrocatalytic H2 production activity remarkably.10 In contrast, Eisenberg and coworkers improved the photocatalytic activity of a cobaloxime complex by tethering an electron-withdrawing group in the axial pyridine ligand.4b
Engineering on proton transportation may also boost activities of HERs significantly. In [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenase enzymes, the pendant amine in the dithiolate ligand serves as a proton relay to facilitate heterolytic formation (or cleavage) of hydrogen.12 Inspired by the unique structure and ultrahigh activity of [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenase enzymes, the team of D. L. DuBois and M. R. DuBois constructed a series of novel nickel complexes using cyclic diphosphine ligands, abbreviated as PR2NR′2(1,5-R′-3,7-R derivative of 1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane (R, R′ = aryl or alkyl)).13 When the pendant amines in the second coordination sphere are positioned close to the Ni ion, they facilitate the cleavage or formation of the H–H bond and promote proton transfer between the metal center and solution, leading to highly efficient electrocatalytic H2 generation.13 Though the proton relay strategy has been successfully applied in electrocatalytic HERs,14 its exploitation in photocatalytic HERs is still in its infancy. Up to now, only three examples have been reported.15 In the first case, a HER of DuBois-type was used to construct homogeneous and heterogeneous AP systems using a phosphonated Ru(II) complex as the PS.15a In the second case, a cationic analogue of DuBois-type catalyst by functionalizing its outer ligand sphere with primary amines realized photocatalytic H2 production in self-assembling hydrogel scaffolds.15b In the third case, Wu and coworkers synthesized a branched poly ethylenimine grafted [FeFe]-H2ase mimic and realized photocatalytic H2 generation in water in combination with quantum dot-based PS and ascorbic acid-based SR.15c In light of the appealing performance of [Co(III)(dmgH)2(py)Cl] (1 in Scheme 1) in catalytic H2 generation and the fact that its chemical modification was focused on substituent's electronic effect and was performed mainly at the para-position of the axial pyridine ligand,4b,10 we herein designed and synthesized a series of new cobaloxime complexes, [Co(III)(dmgH)2(py-m-X)Cl], (py-m-X = meta-substituted pyridine, X = COOH (2), COOCH3 (3), CH2CH2COOH (6), and CH2CH2COOCH3 (7), Scheme 1) with the hope that the COOH group may act as a proton relay to enhance the photocatalytic H2 generation activities of the corresponding complexes. For comparison, [Co(III)(dmgH)2(py-p-X)Cl], (py-p-X = para-substituted pyridine, X = COOH (4) and COOCH3 (5), Scheme 1) was also studied. Among these cobaloxime complexes, complex 6 showed the best photocatalytic behavior and proton relay in the outer coordination sphere may play a role.

Results and discussion
Design of HER
To improve the activities of HERs, pendant amine groups have been utilized widely to serve as proton relays to mimic the structure and function of [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenase enzymes.13–15 Similar to the amine group, the carboxylic acid/carboxylate group is also a proton relay candidate. Though electrocatalytic HERs using the pendant carboxylic acid/carboxylate group as a proton relay have been examined,11c,14c,16 to the best of our knowledge, such a strategy has not been explored yet in developing new photocatalytic HERs, which becomes the impetus for this work.
As a proton relay, the carboxylic acid/carboxylate group should be in close proximity to the reaction center of the cobaloxime catalysts. Keeping this in mind, complexes 2 and 6 were synthesized, in which the carboxylic acid group is either attached directly to the axial pyridine ligand at the meta-position or through a short but flexible CH2CH2 chain. To better understand the role of the carboxylic acid group in photocatalytic H2 production, complexes 3 and 7 were prepared as controls. Additionally, complexes 1, 4 and 5 were also studied for comparison. While 1 and 5 had been studied before as HERs,4b,9a2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 are all new compounds. Modification at the ortho-position of the axial pyridine ligand is not considered, since steric hindrance will hamper its coordination to the Co center.
Optimization of photocatalytic H2 production conditions
We at first used complex 6 to optimize the photocatalytic H2 production conditions. Eosin Y was selected as a PS due to its noble metal-free character and its successful combination with complex 1 in photocatalytic H2 production.9a Fig. S1† shows the UV-visible absorption spectrum of Eosin Y in CH3CN/H2O (1:1). In our AP systems, TEOA was chosen as a SR. As shown in Table 1, 6, Eosin Y and TEOA are all necessary for photocatalytic H2 production (runs 1–3).

We then fixed the concentrations of the three components at 0.2 mM for 6, 0.05 mM for Eosin Y and 5% volume ratio for TEOA, and examined the influence of solution pH on the H2 generation activities of our AP systems. As shown in Fig. 1b, with the gradual increase of the solution pH from 4.0 to 10.0, the turnover number (TON, vs. HER) of the system after 5 h irradiation increased at first and then decreased.

The maximum TON was obtained at pH 7.5. The same trend was also observed in other irradiation time windows, e.g. 1 h or 3 h (Fig. 1a). Below pH 5, no H2 generation was observed, and above pH 10, the H2 amounts were less than 20% of those obtained at pH 7.5. At pH lower than 5.0, the protonation of TEOA eliminates its electron-donating feature, whereas, at pH higher than 9.0, the thermodynamic driving force for protonation of either Co(I), Co(0), or Co(III)H and Co(II)H becomes unfavorable.9a Similar pH effects have been observed in many AP systems.3,4,19
Similar to solution pH, other factors, including solution composition (Fig. S2†) and the concentrations of TEOA (Fig. S3†), 6 (Fig. S4†), and Eosin Y (Fig. S5†), also affected the photocatalytic activities of the systems remarkably. After careful optimization, the best conditions were set up in which the concentrations of 6, Eosin Y, and TEOA are, respectively, 0.1 mM, 0.025 mM, and 4% in volume ratio, while the solution pH is 7.5 and the solution composition is 1:1 of CH3CN/H2O. Under these optimal conditions, a TON (vs. HER) of 111 (5 h irradiation) and a TOF (vs. HER) of 44 h−1 (during the initial 2.5 h) were obtained for 6 (Fig. 2).

Photocatalytic activity comparison of HERs
Under the optimized conditions, the HER activities of 1–7 were compared in detail (Fig. 2 and Table 2). For 1, a TON (vs. HER) of 55 was obtained after 5 h irradiation. Under similar conditions (different light sources), Eisenberg and coworkers reported a TON (vs. HER) of 72.6 for an AP system containing 1, Eosin Y and TEOA.9a When the electron-withdrawing COOCH3 group is anchored at the para-position of pyridine, a small but reproducible enhancement in H2 production was observed for 5 (Fig. 2). In a 5-based AP system using a Pt complex as a PS, Eisenberg and coworkers also found a slight improvement in photocatalytic H2 production with respect to 1-based system.4b

Under our experimental conditions (pH = 7.5), the COOH group should be deprotonated and becomes a weak electron-donating functionality, since the pKa values of isonicotinic acid, nicotinic acid, and acetic acid are 1.94, 3.13, and 4.75, respectively.20 Interestingly, compared with 5, the photocatalytic activity of 4 has a further increase albeit not very large (Fig. 2). In sharp contrast, Eisenberg and coworkers observed a decrease in H2 production activity when 1 is substituted by a strong electron-donating group of N(CH3)2 at the para-position of pyridine.4b
It has been well recognized that introducing an electron-withdrawing substituent in the axial pyridine ligand will shift the reduction potentials of the oxidation states of a cobaloxime anodically, facilitating their electron harvesting from an excited PS and thus H2 production.21 On the other hand, the electron-withdrawing substituent will decrease the pKa values of the oxidation states of a cobaloxime, hindering their protonation and thus H2 production.21 Such opposite effects will also appear in the case of an electron-donating substituent. Theoretically, both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups may improve the photocatalytic activity of a HER, provided the modulation on reduction potentials and pKa values are properly balanced. Bearing these considerations in mind, it is not surprising anymore that both COOCH3 (electron-withdrawing) and COOH (electron-donating under our conditions) can lead to activity improvement of the AP systems.
Once the meta-substitution is compared with the para-substitution, interesting phenomena may be observed immediately, i.e. the photocatalytic activities were augmented further and followed the order of 6>7>2>4 > 3 > 5 > 1 (Fig. 2). Such an activity order is highly reproducible in five independent measurements, though the TON differences are not significant between the adjacent catalysts in this order. It is well known that both electronic induction effect and electronic conjugation effect are much lower at the meta-position than at the para-position. Though the observed activity enhancement in the case of meta-substitution might be attributed to a better balance between the modulation of reduction potentials and pKa values, a through-space effect cannot be ruled out, particularly, in the case of 6. For 6, its carboxylic acid or carboxylate group may interact with dmgH via H-bonding, and thus plays the role of proton relay. Unlike HERs of DuBois-type, in which the pendant amine may direct a proton directly to the hydride atom coordinated on the Co center, the carboxylic acid/carboxylate group in 6 cannot approach the hydride atom which is on the opposite side of the [Co(dmgH)2] plane, and has to find a relay to realize proton transfer, as shown in Scheme 2. Clearly, the flexible –CH2CH2– alkyl chain makes such an interaction possible. Recently, Norton and coworkers observed the UV-Vis absorption spectra of Co(dmgBF2)2L2 in CH3CN under H2 pressure of up to 70 atm.22 In this work, a Co(I) compound with an exchangeable proton is proposed to be in equilibrium with Co(III)H species, as shown in eqn (1),22a suggesting that proton relay in the manner shown in Scheme 2 is feasible. We performed theoretical calculations and obtained an optimized structure as shown in Scheme 3, in which the distance (1.738 Å) between the H atom of the COOH group and the O atom of one dmgH moiety falls in the region of O–H⋯O bonding,23 supporting our proposed mechanism. Kahnt, Guldi and coworkers studied the kinetics of the reduction of 1 in detail and proposed a dimer structure as the key intermediate, where the dmgH ligand and the solvent water molecules make a contribution through the H-bonding interaction.22b

In addition, by the combination of theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments, Artero, Field, and coworkers24 as well as Hammes-Schiffer and coworkers25 proposed an electrocatalytic mechanism for cobalt diimine–dioxime complexes, in which the first proton-coupled electron transfer process leads to a Co(I) compound containing a protonated oxime bridge, Co(I)LH. Then, the second proton-coupled electron transfer process gives rise to a Co(II) hydride species bearing a protonated ligand, Co(II)HLH. Finally, H2 is produced either through external protonation or through an intramolecular mechanism.26 The photocatalytic mechanism shown in Scheme 2 is very similar to this mechanism in the ligand protonation. The difference lies in that proton relay by way of the COOH group might play a role in the ligand protonation in complex 6. (1)
Singlet excited state quenching of PS
Generally, an AP system may realize photocatalytic H2 production through either the reductive quenching mechanism or the oxidative quenching mechanism, depending on which process quenching of the excited PS by SR or HER, is preferential. To understand the mechanism involved in our AP systems, the fluorescence quenching of Eosin Y by the examined cobaloxime complexes and TEOA was investigated.
As shown in Fig. S6–S13,†1–7 and TEOA may quench the fluorescence of Eosin Y effectively. Based on the Stern–Volmer equation (eqn (2)), where I0 and I are the integrated emission intensities of Eosin Y in the absence or presence of a quencher, and τ0 (4.73 ns (ref. 27)) is the singlet excited state lifetime of Eosin Y without the presence of any quencher, the bimolecular quenching rate constants of the complexes and TEOA were calculated, as shown in Table 3. The apparent quenching rate constants of the complexes are higher than the diffusion constant of the solvent (2.2 × 1010 M−1 s−1 for CH3CN at 25 °C),28 implying the presence of static interactions between Eosin Y and the complexes. Though the quenching rate constants of the cobaloxime complexes are two orders of magnitude larger than that of TEOA, the singlet excited state of Eosin Y should be mainly quenched by TEOA in our AP systems, since the concentration of TEOA (4% in volume ratio) is three thousand times higher than those of the complexes. I0/I = 1 + kqτ0[Q](2)

From Table 3, one may find that the quenching rate constants of the complexes substituted by the COOH group are 3–5-fold higher than those by the COOCH3 group, e.g.2vs. 3, 4vs. 5 and 6vs. 7, in line with their photocatalytic H2 production activities. Due to ionization in pH 7.5 solution, the COOH group will take a negative charge and presents an electron-donating feature, both disfavor the electron harvesting from anionic Eosin Y. A possible explanation may be that the COOH group may interact with Eosin Y through H-bonding, facilitating the photoinduced electron transfer process between them. However, the overall trend of fluorescence quenching efficiencies of these cobaloxime catalysts is not in line with their photocatalytic H2 production activities. For example, both 2 and 4 can quench the fluorescence of Eosin Y more efficiently than 6, yet their photocatalytic H2 production activities are lower than that of 6. These results suggest that the photocatalytic activities should not be related to the photoinduced electron transfer from Eosin Y to the catalysts. A proton relay mechanism might make some contribution to the unique performance of 6.
Triplet excited state quenching of PS
Due to the high intersystem crossing efficiency of Eosin Y (Φisc = 0.8 ± 0.08),26 its triplet excited state should take part in the photocatalytic H2 production also. Fig. 3a shows the transient absorption spectra of Eosin Y obtained upon irradiation of 532 nm-laser in CH3CN: H2O (1:1, pH = 7.5). Besides the strong ground state bleaching centered at 520 nm, a weak absorption band at around 560 nm was also observed, which may be attributed to the triplet excited state absorption of Eosin Y.28 When 4% TEOA was present, the transient absorption spectra underwent significant changes (Fig. 3b). One peak centered at 410 nm appeared, assignable to the radical anion of Eosin Y29 and indicating the electron transfer from TEOA to the triplet excited state of Eosin Y. By monitoring the decay of the transient spectra at 560 nm, the triplet excited state lifetimes of Eosin Y were measured to be 100 μs and 6.3 μs, respectively, in the absence and presence of TEOA, suggesting an efficient reductive quenching. In sharp contrast, the transient absorption spectra of Eosin Y in the presence of 6 (0.1 mM) are nearly the same as that of Eosin Y alone in both spectrum profile and decay kinetics (Fig. 3c), demonstrating that the oxidative quenching cannot occur in the triplet excited state of Eosin Y.

Electrochemical properties
To obtain more insight into the photocatalytic H2 production behavior of 6, its electrochemical properties were also studied. As shown in Fig. 4a, upon cathodic scan, an irreversible wave at −0.66 V (vs. SCE, peak potential) was followed by a reversible redox process at −0.92 V (half wave potential), assignable to Co(III) to Co(II) and Co(II) to Co(I), respectively. The irreversible character of the first reduction process suggests that the axial Cl ligand may dissociate from the Co(II) center. A further scan to a more negative potential led to a new wave at −1.64 V, which may be attributed to the reduction of Co(I) to Co(0). Many cobaloxime complexes have similar redox processes at similar potentials.24a,30

Upon the addition of acetic acid, a large catalytic reduction current was observed beyond −1.5 V (as shown in Fig. 4b). In the absence of 6, reduction currents in this electrochemical window were much lower even in the presence of 15 equiv. acetic acid (as shown in Fig. S14†). The large catalytic current may be attributed to the electrocatalytic H2 production process of the Co(0) species. The redox process of Co(II)/Co(I) remained reversible, demonstrating that the pKa of Co(I) is not high enough to be protonated by acetic acid. Thus, the electrocatalytic H2 production of 6 may proceed as follows (eqn (3)–(8)).31 Co(III) + e− → Co(II)(3) Co(II) + e− → Co(I)(4) Co(I) + e− → Co(0)(5) Co(0) + H+ → Co(II)H(6) Co(II)H + H+ → Co(II) + H2(7) 2Co(II)H → 2Co(I) + H2(8)
Conclusions
In this work, the photocatalytic H2 production activities of the cobaloxime complexes 1–7 were compared in a multicomponent system, using Eosin Y as the PS and TEOA as the SR. No matter the substituent in the axial pyridine ligand is electron-withdrawing or electron-donating in nature, the corresponding complexes showed enhanced photocatalytic activities with respect to their parent complex 1. More interestingly, meta-substitution is somewhat more efficient than para-substitution and COOH is slightly more efficient than COOCH3, in improving the photocatalytic H2 generation activity. In particular, 6 showed the highest activity among the examined complexes. Its unique structure, i.e. the short but flexible methylene chain, makes the direct interaction between COOH and dmgH possible, indicating the role of proton relay in 6. These interesting findings encourage us to develop new proton relay based cobaloxime catalysts for more efficient photocatalytic H2 production.

Instruments

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-400 MHz spectrophotometer. HR-MS were recorded on a Bruker APEX IV (7.0 T) FT_MS. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
H2 evolution studies
A 10 mL of CH3CN/H2O (1:1, v/v) solution containing 0.025 mM Eosin Y, 0.1 mM cobaloxime complex, and TEOA (4%, v/v) were put into a 40 mL glass vial equipped with a rubber-septum-sealed outlet. After bubbling with argon for 25 min, 3 mL of gas in the vial was removed by a syringe and 3 mL of methane was then injected into the vial to serve as the internal standard for H2 quantification. The vial was irradiated with visible light, which was obtained from a 1000 W solar simulator (Oriel 91192) using a 400 nm long pass glass filter and a distilled water pool to cut off the UV and IR light, respectively. The production of H2 was monitored and quantified by gas chromatography on a Shimadzu GC-2014 (thermal conductivity detector, 5 Å molecular sieves, 30 m × 0.53 mm column, N2 gas carrier).
Electrochemistry
The redox potentials were measured on an EG&G model 283 potentiostat/galvanostat in a three-electrode cell with a platinum-wire working electrode, a platinum-plate counter electrode, and a SCE (saturated calomel electrode) reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in an argon-saturated anhydrous CH3CN containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte.
Quenching experiments
All quenching experiments were performed by adding calibrated amounts of quencher into the Eosin Y solution at room temperature. The Eosin Y concentration was fixed at 1.0 × 10−6 M in CH3CN/H2O (1:1, v/v). The solutions were degassed with argon for 25 min. Steady-state luminescence spectra were then collected for each sample. The relative emission intensity of the chromophore in the absence and presence of a quencher was used to calculate the quenching rate constant by the Stern–Volmer equation.
Transient absorption
Nanosecond transient absorption measurements were performed on a LP-920 laser flash photolysis setup (Edinburgh). Excitation at 532 nm with a power of 2.0 mJ per pulse from a computer-controlled Nd:YAG laser/OPO system from Opotek (Vibrant 355 II) operating at 10 Hz was directed to the sample with an optical absorbance of 0.96 at the excitation wavelength. The laser and analyzing light beam passed perpendicularly through a 1 cm quartz cell. The complete time-resolved spectra were obtained using a gated CCD camera (AndoriSTAR); the kinetic traces were detected by using a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope and a R928P photomultiplier and analyzed by using Edinburgh analytical software (LP920). All samples used in the flash photolysis experiments were deaerated for 30 min with argon before measurements.
Computational details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 (G03) program package18a employing the DFT method with Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional18b and Lee–Yang–Parr's gradient corrected correlation functional (B3LYP).18c The LanL2DZ basis set and effective core potential were used for the Co atom, and the 6-31 G* basis set was applied for H, C, N, O and Cl. The ground-state geometries of the complex were optimized in CH3CN using the conductive polarizable continuum model (CPCM).
