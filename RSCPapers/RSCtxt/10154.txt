Introduction
Perovskite (pero-SCs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs) that are representatives of next-generation solar cells have received much attention as a promising alternative energy source because of the low cost for device manufacturing, light weight, mechanical flexibility, etc. Significant efforts including the development of new light harvesting materials, device structures, and morphological engineering have improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of pero-SCs and PSCs up to 22% and 13%, respectively.1–5 Among the various approaches, an effective strategy for improving both device efficiency and stability is interfacial engineering using charge transport layers with excellent charge selectivity and long-term air stability. Charge transport layers can be classified into hole and electron transport layers. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-styrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide can be used as hole transport layers (HTL) and titanium oxide and zinc oxide can be used as electron transport layers (ETL). Among them, PEDOT:PSS has been commonly and widely used as an HTL in optoelectronic devices including pero-SCs and PSCs because of its excellent hole selectivity and amphiphilic nature for solution-processed multilayer deposition. However, the acidic and hygroscopic properties of PEDOT:PSS were detrimental to device stability by accelerating the decomposition rate of the light harvesting layer and/or etching of the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.6–12
While there have been many investigations to improve the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film, few studies have been conducted to enhance the stability of the PEDOT:PSS film under ambient conditions. Janssen's group introduced sorbitol into PEDOT:PSS as a high boiling processing additive to increase its electrical conductivity and environmental stability.13 Thermal annealing treatment resulted in improvements of conductivity and stability, which are attributed to the reduced water uptake by the denser packing of PEDOT chains. F. Hou et al. employed the bilayer structure of MoO3 and PEDOT:PSS as the HTL of inverted-type pero-SC.14 Although the incorporation of the MoO3 layer improved both device stability and efficiency, an additional layer made the device fabrication procedure more complex. Surface treatment of PEDOT:PSS using methanol (MeOH) improved its electrical conductivity, compared to an untreated PEDOT:PSS film.15 The MeOH-treated PEDOT:PSS surface is covered by more conductive PEDOT nanodomains by washout of a partially insulating PSS component. The mechanism of this process for improving conductivity is almost the same as previously reported post-treatment methods using acidic solvents such as HCl, HBr, and H2SO4.16–19 However, they only focused on the change of conductivity as a function of solvents and relative humidity, but not final device stability.
In this work, we introduce a photo-crosslinking agent into a PEDOT:PSS film for simultaneously improving the stability and efficiency of both pero-SCs and PSCs. The water-soluble nature is one of the major advantages of PEDOT:PSS for solution-processing. The incorporation of the photo-crosslinking agent can transmute this intrinsic property into the water-resistant PEODT:PSS film. Furthermore, the crosslinking system prevents the penetration of water into the HTL and has no negative effect on hole extraction from the active layer and hole transport between PEDOT chains.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the fabrication of the water-resistant PEDOT:PSS film by crosslinking agents. We employed 2-pentacosa-10,12-diynamidoethylsulfate (PCDSA) as a photo-crosslinking agent. A PEDOT:PSS solution containing 5 wt% PCDSA was spin-cast on an ITO-coated glass substrate. This is the optimum amount of PCDSA in the PEDOT:PSS film to have water resistivity without interruption of hole extraction/transport.20 UV irradiation (254 nm, 28.3 mW cm−2, 3 min) using a portable UV lamp induced photo-polymerization of PCDSA molecules, leading to the formation of polydiacetylenes (PDAs) inside the PEDOT:PSS film. Finally, we applied MeOH treatment for a surface engineering process to improve the electrical conductivity by removing insulating PSS parts and PDA residues.15,21

As shown in Fig. 1b, we performed a water resistance test of the PEDOT:PSS film with the crosslinking agent. We also prepared a pristine PEDOT:PSS film for comparison. A thermal annealing process was applied to dry pristine PEDOT:PSS, while we conducted UV irradiation for the crosslinked PEDOT:PSS film. In the UV irradiation process, a photomask was used to clearly visualize the water resistance of the PEDOT:PSS film containing crosslinked and non-crosslinked parts. Finally, the prepared samples were immersed in deionized water for 5 s. As clearly seen in images of Fig. 1b, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film was completely removed and its residue only left after immersion. In contrast, we observed the PEDOT:PSS film with a clear photomask pattern in the crosslinked film. This confirms the successful formation of the crosslinking system in the PEDOT:PSS film by photo-polymerization of PCDSA. Moreover, it is meaningful that the photo-crosslinking agent changes the water-soluble property, which is an intrinsic characteristic of PEDOT:PSS, into a water-resistant property.
To investigate the influence of the crosslinking agent in the PEDOT:PSS film, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As seen in the XPS results (Fig. 2a), all samples showed a dominant peak at 284 eV, which corresponds to the C–C bonds of PEDOT and PSS parts. A slight shift of the binding energy from 284 to 285 eV for PEDOT:PSS films with the crosslinking agent may be ascribed to the weak interaction between PEDOT and PSS caused by the crosslinking agent.22 In contrast to pristine PEDOT:PSS, we observed the peak at 289 eV for the PEDOT:PSS film with PDA (after photo-crosslinking), corresponding to the CC bonds of PDA. This weak peak resulted from a small amount of PDA inside the PEDOT:PSS film. MeOH treatment slightly reduced the CC peak. This is attributed to the removal of surface residual PDAs in the PEDOT:PSS film.
 Fig. 2  (a) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peaks and (b) transmittance spectra of PEDOT:PSS films with different treatments. 

Fig. 2b shows the transmittance spectra of PEDOT:PSS films with different treatments. Pristine and PEDOT:PSS films with PCDSA (before photo-polymerization) exhibited similar transmittance spectra due to negligible absorption of PCDSA. It is noticeable that the transmittance decreased in the range of 350–450 nm for PEDOT:PSS with PDA (after photo-polymerization). This change was attributed to the absorption of PDA.20 In the above-mentioned XPS result, MeOH treatment removed surface residual PDAs, thus leading to increased transmittance in the range of 350–450 nm again. XPS and UV-vis absorption results confirm the successful formation of the crosslinking system inside the PEDOT:PSS film and the removal of residual PDAs by MeOH surface treatment.
To study the changes of surface conductivity and morphology in the PEDOT:PSS film by the crosslinking agent, we performed conductive and topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Fig. 3a–d exhibit conductive AFM (c-AFM) images of PEDOT:PSS films with different treatments. A 2 V bias was applied to samples for comparing surface conductivity differences. The root-mean-square (rms) current of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film was 0.152 nA. Incorporation of PCDSA into PEDOT:PSS decreased the rms current to 0.020 nA due to the insulating property of PCDSA molecules. Formation of PDAs by photo-polymerization of PCDSA further decreased the surface current to 0.015 nA. These phenomena resulted from the interruption of charge transport between PEDOT chains due to the insulating properties of PCDSA and PDA. However, surface MeOH treatment significantly increased the rms current up to 5.801 nA by simultaneously removing surface residual PDAs and insulating PSS parts.21

Fig. 3e–h exhibit topographic images of PEDOT:PSS films with different treatments. Surface uniformity/roughness is one of the key factors for determining device performance by affecting contact and adhesion between the HTL and the active layer. There were no huge differences of surface roughness between pristine PEDOT:PSS (1.421 nm) and PEDOT:PSS with PCDSA (1.495 nm). The PEDOT:PSS film with PDA had a high surface roughness of 1.809 nm because of the formation of PDAs with a larger domain size from the photo-polymerization of PCDSA monomers with a small size. The MeOH treatment removed residual PDAs and PSS parts of the PEDOT:PSS film, decreasing the surface roughness to 1.692 nm. Conductive and topographic AFM results confirmed that the combination of the crosslinking system and MeOH treatment for the PEDOT:PSS film led to excellent surface conductivity for efficient charge transport and smooth surface roughness for compact contact at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer.
Additionally, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the influence of PEDOT:PSS with different treatments on the crystallinity and morphology of a perovskite film. Fig. S1† shows XRD peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films deposited on PEDOT:PSS with different treatments. All samples clearly showed peaks of 14.10°, 28.45°, 30.35° and 31.85° corresponding to a tetragonal crystal structure. However, compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS, the PEDOT:PSS films with PDA and the MeOH-treated PDA exhibited slightly high XRD intensities, indicating increased perovskite domain size.23,24 This may result from different surface energies due to the existence of PDA molecules.20 The SEM results clearly supported these phenomena, as shown in Fig. S2.† We observed larger perovskite crystals in perovskite films coated on PEDOT:PSS with PDA and MeOH-treated PDA (Fig. S2c and S2d†) than those of pristine PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S2a†) and PEDOT:PSS with PCDSA (Fig. S2b†).
To verify the applicability of PEDOT:PSS with a crosslinking agent as the HTL of solar cells, we fabricated both pero-SCs and PSCs. Fig. 4a exhibits the device structure of inverted-type pero-SCs. We employed a simple device configuration of ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Al. Fig. 4b and c present current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of optimized pero-SCs with different treatments, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control device with pristine PEDOT:PSS showed a PCE of 12.38% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.08 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.93 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74. The device based on PEDOT:PSS with PCDSA (before photo-polymerization) had a slightly lower PCE of 11.80% than the control device. Furthermore, there was a considerable decrease of PCE (8.72%) for the device based on PEDOT:PSS with PDA (after photo-polymerization). These tendencies are coincident with conductive and topographic AFM results. Interruption of charge transport by insulating PCDSA and PDA molecules within the PEDOT:PSS HTL resulted in a significant decrease of the JSC. Compared to PCDSA with a small domain size, PDAs with a larger domain size further disturbed the hole hopping process between PEDOT chains. It is noteworthy that MeOH treatment restored the device efficiency and further gave rise to remarkable PCE improvement.

The device based on PEDOT:PSS with PDA and MeOH treatment showed a PCE of 13.22% with a JSC of 19.36 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.91 V and a FF of 0.74. This high device efficiency is attributed to the successful removal of PDA residues and insulating PSS moieties on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film. As shown in Fig. 4c, the calculated JSC values from EQE were consistent with those from J–V measurement (pristine PEDOT:PSS: 17.36 mA cm−2, PCDSA: 16.07 mA cm−2, PDA without MeOH treatment: 12.87 mA cm−2, and PDA + MeOH treatment: 18.04 mA cm−2). At this point, we suspected that the high device efficiency is caused by only the MeOH effect. To confirm this, we fabricated pero-SCs based on the PEDT:PSS HTL with and without MeOH treatment. The device without MeOH treatment exhibited a higher PCE (12.38%) than that of the device with MeOH treatment (11.10%) (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). This may be attributed to the slight washing of the PEDOT:PSS layer during dropping MeOH droplets and spinning process. This result indicates that the crosslinking system in PEDOT:PSS strengthens its polar solvent resistance. Finally, we confirm that the combined effects of the crosslinking system and MeOH treatment contributed to the remarkable PCE improvement.
To investigate the effect of the crosslinking system on the device stability, we also performed a stability test of pero-SCs. Since inverted pero-SCs are vulnerable to oxygen and moisture owing to the easily oxidized Al electrode and fast decomposition of perovskite crystals, we conducted the device stability test for 570 hours in a glovebox filled with nitrogen gas (Fig. 4d).25 We prepared two samples, which were the devices based on pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS with PDA and MeOH treatment. The device with pristine PEDOT:PSS showed a fast efficiency reduction rate of 40% after a storage time of 4 hours, whereas the device based on crosslinked PEDOT:PSS and MeOH treatment exhibited a slower reduction rate of 10%. From this time, we observed the gradual efficiency decrease for both devices. After a storage time of 570 hours, the device with the crosslinking system showed better stability (60% of the initial PCE), compared to that of the device with pristine PEDOT:PSS (40% of the initial PCE). This can be attributed to the fact that PDA containing the PEDOT:PSS HTL delays the decomposition rate of the perovskite light absorbing layer due to more neutral pH conditions by the removal of PSS parts.26
We also employed crosslinked PEDOT:PSS in PSCs to ensure its universality. We prepared two kinds of PSCs with the same device configuration of ITO/HTL/active layer/Al and different photoactive materials (Fig. 5a). Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) were used as the active component for the first device. We used poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-e-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th) and phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) for the second device. Fig. 5b and c present the J–V characteristics of optimized P3HT:PC60BM and PTB7-Th:PC70BM PSCs with different treatments, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the two PSCs are summarized in Table 1. It is noticeable that the device results of the two PSCs have perfectly same tendencies as those of pero-SCs. Both devices based on PEDOT:PSS with PDA and MeOH treatment exhibited the highest device efficiencies among various devices with different treatments (PTB7-Th:PC70BM device: 7.93% and P3HT:PC60BM device: 3.36%).

(d) Stability test of PTB7-Th:PC70BM PSCs with and without a crosslinking agent both in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and under ambient conditions. 
We performed the stability test of PSCs in the same manner as for pero-SCs. The difference from pero-SCs was determined by comparing the stability of the devices with different treatments under both nitrogen and air conditions (Fig. 5d and Fig. S4†). An additional stability test under an air atmosphere was carried out to clearly confirm the effect of the water-resistant PEDOT:PSS HTL on device stability. The conditions for device stability were average temperature of 20 ± 5 °C and relative humidity of 40 ± 10%. As a representative of PSCs, PTB7-Th:PC70BM was used for the device stability test. In a glovebox filled with nitrogen gas, all devices showed excellent device stability regardless of the presence of the crosslinking agent in the PEDOT:PSS film (pristine PEDOT:PSS: 90% of the initial PCE, crosslinked PEDOT:PSS with MeOH treatment: 96% of the initial PCE after a storage time of 160 hours). Interestingly, the difference between them was observed for the stability test under air conditions. After exposure to air for 20 hours, the device with pristine PEDOT:PSS exhibited an efficiency reduction rate of 68%, whereas there was an efficiency reduction rate of 37% for the device with crosslinked PEDOT:PSS. After the exposure time for 160 hours, this device still maintained about 30% of the initial PCE. This superior device stability is ascribed to the prevention of water penetration into the PEDOT:PSS HTL due to the water resistant property of PEDOT:PSS with the crosslinking system.
These results from device characteristics and stability test clearly confirm the universality of crosslinked PEDOT:PSS as efficient HTL for simultaneously improving device efficiency and stability of both pero-SCs and PSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a water-resistant PEDOT:PSS HTL by incorporating a photo-crosslinking agent into a PEDOT:PSS film. The crosslinking system was successfully formed inside the PEDOT:PSS film by simple and fast photo-polymerization of PCDSA monomers via the UV irradiation method. Both pero-SCs and PSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL with PDA and MeOH treatment exhibited higher device efficiency and better stability, compared to those of the devices with pristine PEDOT:PSS. The crosslinking system inside PEDOT:PSS changed its intrinsic water-soluble characteristic into a water-resistant property, thus preventing water penetration into the PEDOT:PSS film. In addition, MeOH treatment improved the surface conductivity and reduced the surface roughness of the PEDOT:PSS film by removing surface residues of PDAs and insulating PSS parts. Consequently, the combination of crosslinking system and MeOH surface treatment simultaneously improved the device efficiency and stability of both pero-SCs and PSCs. This work provides a new type of PEDOT:PSS as an efficient and stable hole transport material that can be applied to different kinds of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and field-effect transistors as well as being suitable for solution-processed multilayer stacking for a tandem structure.
Experimental
Device fabrication and characterization
Patterned ITO coated glass substrates (sheet resistance: 30 Ω sq−1) were washed with detergent and ultrasonicated sequentially in deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol. The substrates were dried in an oven for 12 h and then subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. For control device, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios VP Al 4083) solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 140 °C for 10 min. For PEDOT:PSS with crosslinking agent, 5 wt% of DA monomer, 2-pentacosa-10,12-diynamidoethylsulfate (PCDSA), was added into PEDOT:PSS solution. This PEDOT:PSS solution with PCDSA was used to spin-coat on the ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. This film was subjected to UV-ozone treatment for photo-polymerization of PCDSA (synthesis of PDA) and then washed with methanol to remove surface residual PDA. The substrates were transferred into a glove box and the active layer was spin-coated on the HTL from the solution of PTB7-Th:PC70BM = 1:1.5 (w/w) dissolved in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (DPE) (97:3 vol%) at 1800 rpm for 40 s; P3HT:PC60BM = 1:0.8 (w/w) was dissolved in dichlorobenzene at 800 rpm for 40 s. We prepared perovskite precursor solution that consist of MAI and PbI2 dissolved in mixed solvent of DMSO and DMF (3:7 v/v). For pero-SCs, we introduced PC60BM as the electron transport layer on perovskite film. The PC60BM solution (25 mg ml−1) was prepared by dissolving in mixed solvent of chloroform and chlorobenzene. Subsequently, an Al (100 nm) electrode was deposited on top of the active layer under vacuum (<10−6 Torr) using thermal evaporation. The area of the Al electrode defines an active area of the device as 0.13 cm2. The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a LCS-100 SERIES SMALL AREA SOLAR SIMULATOR. The solar cell performance was tested using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a PV measurement QE system by applying monochromatic light from a xenon lamp under ambient conditions. XRD data were measured using a Rigaku Model SmartLab and XPS data were measured using a theta probe base system at Hanyang LINC + Analytical Equipment Center (Seoul).
