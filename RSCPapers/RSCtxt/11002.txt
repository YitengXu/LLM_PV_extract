    , Accepted 8th April 2021First published on 8th April 2021AbstractWith the increasing emphasis on transitioning to a sustainable society, electrosynthetic routes to generate fuels and chemicals are rapidly gaining traction. While the electrolysis of water and CO2 has been heavily investigated over the last decade, electrocatalysis of other abundant resources such as biomass and methane is now increasingly coming into focus. As this area is relatively less mature, much work remains to be done. In particular, efforts to decipher reaction mechanisms and extract the fundamental insights are necessary to develop economically competitive electrosynthetic routes using biomass and methane. Against this backdrop, this feature article focuses on the recent developments within the community using atomically precise catalysts, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, as model systems to understand these reactions.

Introduction
As solar, hydro and wind technologies mature, the price of renewable electricity is correspondingly decreasing1,2 Coupled with the increasingly evident effects of fossil fuel burning, the development of electrosynthetic routes to replace thermocatalytic reactions becomes an increasingly attractive alternative.3,4 To this end, efforts over the last decade in generating H2 from water or carbon-based chemicals from CO2 have resulted in the maturation of these technologies to the point of nearing commercialization.5,6 However, there remains much to be done in translating electrosynthesis to take advantage of other available feedstocks.
Mechanisms of HMF oxidation and methane oxidation
Compared to water splitting and CO2 conversion, electrosynthetic routes to valorize abundant raw resources such as biomass and methane are relatively underdeveloped. These areas are becoming increasingly important in the transition to a sustainable society, especially as biomass and methane are available at large scales and the products from their conversion can be directly integrated into current infrastructure.7,8 Biomass and bioenergy systems, for example, can currently cover up to 25% of transportation fuel needs within the United States9 and are expected to provide 10% of the global energy supply within 15 years.10 Methane is also readily burned via gas flaring, contributing to approximately 1% of global CO2 emissions, as decentralized methods to directly convert it to liquid fuels are not fully developed.11 Further, methane is becoming more and more available with the emergence of shale gas technologies and renewable energy technologies to directly process methane can make a significant impact on society's sustainability.12 Directing intermittent electricity to biomass and methane oxidation en route to powering the chemical and fuel industries therefore stands to be a crucial component of a closed carbon cycle powered by renewable sources.
Underpinning the future success of these electrosynthetic technologies is the fundamental understanding of the catalysts that drive them. A powerful way to extract this knowledge is through the use of catalysts with atomically precise active sites where the exact intermediate binding motifs, secondary sphere interactions, local chemical environment and more can all be deduced. To this end, we place the focus of this feature article on recent developments within the community in utilizing electrocatalysts, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, with atomically precise active sites to electrochemically valorize biomass and methane to an array of fuels and societally important chemicals. In particular, we aim to show through multiple examples how efforts towards designing and implementing atomically precise active sites, coupled with electroanalytical, spectroscopic and theoretical investigations of them, have augmented the fundamental understanding of this chemistry and consequently laid the groundwork for eventual commercialization (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  The scope of this article entails the use of atomically precise catalysts geared towards the electrolysis of methane and biomass platforms. 
Biomass valorization
Biomass is largely considered as an untapped resource, the utilization of which carries a high payoff if suitable methods are developed to fully valorize it. As a byproduct of many existing industrial and agricultural processes much of waste biomass is simply discarded or burned because the infrastructure and technology is not yet in place to convert it into societally useful chemicals.13 It is in this particular domain that electrosynthetic routes are envisioned to play an important role. In contrast to valorization of water and CO2, the valorization of biomass and biomass platforms (readily extracted chemicals from raw biomass) generates products that carry a much higher commercial value in comparison to H2 or C1 products produced from water and CO2, respectively. Further, converting biomass to useful chemicals through electrosynthetic routes as opposed to thermochemical methods is emerging as a particularly attractive route as the necessary energy input potentially comes from renewable sources.
Biomass platforms of scientific and economic interest include glycerol14–16 and furfural.17 In addition to these two, one biomass platform that we focus on in this work is 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, HMF. This biomass platform can readily be extracted from the acidic dehydration of simple sugars.18,19 While being only modestly useful itself, HMF can be electrochemically oxidized to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a potentially green alternative to terephthalic acid used in a variety of polymers.20 To this end, the performance of current electrosynthetic systems must still be augmented to render these technologies economically viable.
Serving as the foundation of this is the precise elucidation of reaction mechanisms at surface active sites. Uncovering the mechanisms is important for a number of key reasons. (1) Discovery of rate-limiting steps and the identity of most active sites within a catalyst system provides a rational avenue for maximizing the density and activity of these sites in next-generation materials en route to attaining economically viable technologies. In particular, lower overpotential and higher selectivity at industrially relevant reaction rates of hundreds of mA cm−2 still need to be achieved.21,22 (2) There are multiple biomass platforms and chemicals with shared functional groups whose chemical conversion processes need to be developed.7 Therefore, the fundamental knowledge of, for example, how to selectively carry out C–H or CO activation can be translated across several of these platforms to accelerate the field as a whole. Selective partial reactivity is particularly important because overoxidation/overreduction can often lead to valueless products.23 In addition, fundamental insights can also be later applied to more complex, downstream electrosynthetic processes such as those generating chemicals relevant to the pharmaceutical or cosmetics industries.24,25
Heterogeneous HMF oxidation catalysts
Against this backdrop, a multi-component HMF oxidation catalyst was synthesized through layer-by-layer deposition of Au and Pd metal nanoparticles to maximize the efficiency of sequential HMF oxidation reactions to FDCA.26 Through variation of the thickness and position of different metal nanoparticles, the relationship between the structure and activity was elucidated. Alternating layers of Au and Pd showed higher activities than monometallic catalysts (that is, pure Au and pure Pd catalysts). Further, the performance of the system can also be tuned by changing the position of different metal nanoparticles; the (AuPd)7 catalyst showed a better performance than the Au7/Pd7 and Pd7/Au7 catalyst (Fig. 2a and b). The reason behind the high activity of (AuPd)7 was that Au is beneficial for the conversion of HMF to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HFCA) through the oxidation of the aldehyde group, while Pd has a better activity for the conversion of HFCA to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) via alcohol oxidation. Thus, the outer layered Au nanoparticles (NPs) can transform HMF to HFCA rapidly, and provide the HFCA reactant for Pd to further oxidize to form the final product FDCA (Fig. 2c)

A parallel effort entailed the design of PtNiSx for HMF oxidation. Compared with pure Pt, PtNi, and NiSx components, the PtNiSx composite showed an enhanced activity and stability for HMF oxidation.27 For HMF oxidation, it showed a similar current density and onset potential to that of PtNiSx/CB, but PtNiSx/CB showed a lower Tafel slope than NiSx/CB, which suggests that NiSx is the active site for HMF oxidation reaction. In addition, the Ni 2p XPS spectrum before and after the reaction revealed that the valence state of Ni became higher (from Ni2+ to Ni3+), lending evidence that high-valence Ni species within PtNiSx is the active site of HMF oxidation. DFT calculations demonstrated that the improved performance of PtNiSx originates from the surface interaction between Pt and NiSx nanocrystals; NiSx on Pt(111) reduces the binding energy between the Pt surface and intermediates, as well as the interaction between Pt and NiSx nanoparticles promotes electron transfer, culminating in improved activity for HMF oxidation.
Inspired by the water oxidation catalyst of photosystem II, the Mn4CaO5 complex, a team reported helical manganese borophosphate (LiMnII(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O, denoted LiMnBPO) as a (pre)catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and HMF oxidation (Fig. 3a).28 LiMnBPO showed a high catalytic activity and a faradaic Efficiency (FE) of ∼98% for HMF oxidation to FDCA. The origin of the performance of LiMnBPO was revealed by Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). These experiments demonstrated that LiMnBPO converted to amorphous birnessite-type Mn oxide (a-δ-MnO2) under reaction conditions, along with the dissolution of the phosphate and borate species and the partial replacement of Li sites with K+ ions from the electrolyte. As the reaction proceeded, the corrosion process was extended from the surface to the interior of the catalyst, increasing the porosity and exposing more MnIII active sites. Raman and X-ray data also showed that the valence state of a-δ-MnO2 is not fully MnIV but a mixed valence of MnIII and MnIV. The charge-neutralizing cations reduced some MnIV to MnIII, deemed to be the active site for catalysis due to its longer Mn–O bonds. Through Jahn–Teller distortion, the longer and consequently weaker bonds can promote the oxidation reaction through the easier formation of oxygen vacancies.

A powerful method of tuning electrocatalytic activity is through modulating the absorption energy of the reactant molecule with an active site modulated through inductive effects from its support.29,30 To this end, depositing single atom (SA) sites onto metal oxide supports is an attractive strategy in the design of electrocatalysts. One particular study introduced Ir single atom sites on a Co3O4 scaffold to generate a highly active HMF oxidation composite system (Fig. 4a).31 Following an impregnation/calcination synthetic route, the uniform atom-scale dispersion of Ir was confirmed by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Relative to that of Co3O4, the diffraction peaks of Ir-Co3O4 were slightly shifted to a higher angle, indicating that the introduction of Ir led to contraction of the crystal structure. Complementary X-ray absorption measurements were subsequently used to validate the single-atom configuration of the Ir species.

Electrochemical analysis shows a lower onset of HMF oxidation performance (1.15 vs. 1.35 VRHE) and higher current density for Ir-Co3O4 than Co3O4 attributed to the activity of the Ir single atom sites while product analysis confirmed higher yields and faradaic efficiency. At a mechanistic level, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out in HMF, ethylene and monoxide atmospheres to evaluate the preferred adsorption of the CC group on Ir atom sites. These experiments, in conjunction with DFT calculations, showed an enhanced CC adsorption on Ir sites on Ir-Co3O4 relative to Co3O4 only and was interpreted to be beneficial for HMF oxidation. In all, this work demonstrated a powerful strategy to design electrocatalysts at the atomic level through modulating the cooperative adsorption behavior of the reactants.
The strategy of incorporating a catalytic element within an electronic-structure modulating host was also used with Co atoms embedded within Cu fluorophosphate materials (Fig. 5).32 In this work, Cu fluorophosphates were catalytically inert but rendered Co sites electron-poor, as evidenced through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The resulting effects were both an enhanced water oxidation and HMF oxidation activity. Such works open new pathways in the use of inductive effects to tune the electronics and the consequent activity of solid-state catalytic materials.

Molecular HMF oxidation catalysts
Heterogenized molecular catalysts in their various forms enable the use of synthetic chemistry to design catalytic sites and are readily applicable in flow systems, often exhibit enhanced stability and do not need to be separated from reaction products like their solubilized analogues. To this end (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO), first used as a mediator in HMF oxidation,33 was grafted onto the surface of mesoporous indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.34 To carry out the surface-grafting step, the TEMPO molecule was modified with a silatrane-anchor (STEMPO) and covalently immobilized on the ITO surface. Success here was validated through a combination of electrochemical, XPS, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. In particular, the EPR measurements showed that the catalytically active site (i.e. the oxoammonium cation) is both stable and readily regenerated under electrocatalytic conditions and the long-term stability of the hybrid electrode assembly is limited by the amide bond in STEMPO. The functionality and performance of the device were confirmed by HMF, methylbenzylalcohol and glycerol oxidation. This molecular hybrid system highlighted the utility of combining high surface area electrodes as scaffolds with grafted molecular active sites towards functional electrosynthetic systems.
Metal and covalent organic frameworks (MOFs and COFs) present unique opportunities as they can be tuned across multiple length scales and dimensions. Within the scope of this work, we focus on how atomically precise active sites within these structures are applied to HMF oxidation. In this regard, nickel(II)-modified covalent-organic framework films (TpBpy-Ni) were recently demonstrated to be active for HMF conversion to FDCA.35 The prepared TpBpy-Ni film afforded a nearly 100% HMF conversion and a FDCA yield of 58%. A linear dependence of peak current and HMF concentration was obtained, suggesting that the HMF oxidation rate is linearly dependent on its concentration. XPS analysis of pre- and post-catalysis TpBpy-Ni@FTO films and post-catalysis ICP-MS analysis of the reaction medium demonstrated the stability of the film throughout the catalytic cycle. The HMF oxidation pathway here was identified through monitoring the reaction with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The last step, FFCA oxidation to FDCA, was determined to be rate-limiting in the overall catalytic cycle. Overall, this work puts forth COFs as a promising platform for incorporating molecularly defined transition metal active sites.
High valence Ni species are seen as active sites for alcohol and aldehyde oxidation. To this end, Co2+ was used to stabilize high-valence Ni within Co-doped two-dimensional Ni-based metal–organic frameworks (2D NiCoBDC, BDC represents terephthalic acid), with high activity, selectivity and stability for HMF oxidation to FDCA.36 The performance of NiCoBDC was attributed to the abundance of accessible active sites within the open structure of the MOFs, as well as to the coupling effect between Ni and Co atoms. Relative to NiBDC, NiCoBDC showed a shift to higher binding energies of the Ni 2p peak and a shift to lower binding energies of the O 1s peak in the MOFs’ XPS spectra. The results were interpreted to signify a partial transfer of electrons from Ni2+ to O2-. As the valence electronic configuration of Ni2+ is 3d8, the (t2g) d-orbital is fully occupied, leading to an electron repulsion between Ni2+ and bridging O2− from the ligands. This electron repulsion inhibits the electron transfer in the MOFs. However, the introduction of Co2+ with unpaired electrons into NiBDC enables an interaction with bridging O2− by π-donation, reducing the electron repulsion and promoting charge transfer from Ni2+ to Co2+. In all, this facilitates the formation of high-valence Ni species and consequently maximizes the performance of the electrocatalysts (Fig. 6).

A complementary strategy for boosting active site activity is the modulation of coordination. In this regard, a missing linker strategy was used to construct coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites within a MOF-74 scaffold (Fig. 7).37 The MOF containing rationally incorporated defects, named Ni74D, exhibited greatly enhanced activity for HMF oxidation relative to the nominally defect-free Ni74 MOF. Through an operando spectroscopic study, the enhanced activity was assigned to the defect sites being able to co-adsorb both HMF and *OH next to each other, with *OH acting as a local proton acceptor necessary to oxidize the HMF alcohol and aldehyde groups.

In summation, while considerable gains in system performance must still be realized, gains in both mechanistic knowledge and system functionality are continually being made, especially through the strategies outlined above.
Heterogeneous methane oxidation catalysts
As the most abundant hydrocarbon on earth,38 methane carries much societal importance as both a chemical building block in industrial processes and a fuel source. At a fundamental level, research into the oxidation of methane stands to bring important knowledge about the activation of the molecule's relatively inert C–H bonds (bond dissociation energy of 439.3 kJ mol−1)39 and how to rationally direct reaction pathways following this initial step. Currently most methane conversion proceeds through a two-step thermo-catalytic process: (1) methane is converted through steam reforming at temperatures of 700–1000 °C over Ni catalysts to carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas) and (2) these two products are recombined through the Fisher–Tropsch reaction over typically Fe or Co catalysts to generate liquid hydrocarbons.40 In place of the indirect process, much attention has been placed on direct methane oxidation to products such as methanol or formaldehyde.41
Direct methane conversion has been carried in the gas-phase over Cu and Fe containing zeolites in a process that involves activating the transition metal active site with O2 or N2O, methane adsorption, and finally product extraction.42–44 Through a combination of ex situ and operando (performed while the catalyst is functioning) spectroscopy, the precise chemical structure of the active sites has been identified (Fig. 2a and b).43,45–47 Strikingly, the synthetic active sites resembled those of methane monooxygenase enzymes,48,49 which function to convert methane to methanol in a room-temperature aqueous environment.
In the liquid phase, the oxidation of methane to methyl bisulfate has been notably achieved with solubilized Pt-bipyridine compounds in sulfuric acid.50,51 These initial results enabled a wide array of systematic modifications to the Pt complexes by changing the ligand identity or adding in a second metal to boost the catalytic performance.41 Electrochemical heterogeneous oxidation of methane, discussed in this article, is particularly interesting because the applied potential to the catalyst can be fine-tuned to precisely modulate the catalyst's oxidation state, tune the electronics, and perhaps even dictate the reaction pathway.52
Theoretical investigations have elucidated that the key species active for the heterogeneous C–H activation of methane is the weakly bound *O species (Fig. 8).53 This species is typically generated under positive applied potentials as a part of the water oxidation cycle and on certain catalysts may break the C–H bond to form *OCH3 en route to CH3OH. A similar study was carried out on M–N4 sites embedded within graphene to construct a Pourbaix diagram of adsorbed oxygen species.54 This study has predicted that Fe–N4 and Ir–N4 sites would generate sufficiently reactive sites *O for C–H activation of methane and are therefore promising starting point for experimental endeavours.

Experimentally, work with well-defined Pt surfaces has provided a useful series of insights into C–H activation with metal catalysts (Fig. 9).55 In this work, the authors investigated Pt(111), Pt(110), and Pt(100), and stepped surfaces of Pt(S)[n(100) × (110)] and Pt(S)[n(100) × (111)] with the (100) terrace. Only Pt(100) surfaces were active towards CH4 oxidation with CO being the primary reaction product. Cyclic voltammograms of each surface showed that only Pt(100) exhibited an extra oxidation peak in the presence of CH4 dissolved in the electrolyte. Complementing this were operando IR experiments which visualized a multiply bonded CO occupying 65% of the Pt surface. DFT calculations revealed that all three planes can activate the C–H bond of CH4, but only on Pt(100) the formed CHx intermediates can be further oxidized through coupling with surface oxygen species.
 Fig. 9  CVs of Pt(111) (a), Pt(110) (b) and Pt(100) (c) point to only Pt(100) being active for methane oxidation. Operando IR experiments point to a multiply bonded CO species as being the dominant one throughout the catalytic cycle (d). Reprinted with permission from ref. 44: H.-B. Ma, T. Sheng, W.-S. Yu, J.-Y.

Among transition metal oxides, Co3O4 possesses weak M–O bonds, and thus is expected to be an active catalyst for methane oxidation through its oxygen vacancies that carry out this reaction. ZrO2 features only weak interactions with Co3O4, which will not decrease the reducibility of Co3O4, and simultaneously shows a good adsorption capacity of oxidants such as carbonate. Considering the above reasons, a series of ZrO2/Co3O4 electrocatalysts with different composition ratios and morphologies were investigated to elucidate this relationship and link it to their resultant methane oxidation activities.56 When using ZrO2 nanotubes (NTs) as a substrate instead of ZrO2 nanoparticles, ZrO2 NTs/Co3O4 showed an enhanced activity towards methane oxidation to propanol products due to a higher surface area with more active sites and a promoted diffusion of oxidants/CH4. When exploring composition effects, 1:4 ZrO2:Co3O4 showed the highest activities. XPS results pointed to this composition as featuring an optimal proportion of surface oxygen vacancies serving as the adsorption sites of oxidants and high charge-transfer rates to carbonate species from the electrolyte.
Recently a photoelectrochemical system for selective production of CO from CH4 oxidation was developed (Fig. 10).57 Atomic-layer deposition (ALD)-grown TiO2 was found to possess a high concentration of Ti3+ sites on the surface through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. A combination of operando Raman and IR experiments elucidated that the Ti3+ sites generated *O species that interacted with neighboring *OCH2 adsorbed on Ti4+ by abstracting hydrogen in the key step to CO production on this system. Such synergistic effects were deemed to be important in terms of controlling the reaction pathways toward CO formation and highlighted the utility of proximal interactions of surface-bound C species.

Molecular methane oxidation catalysts
In contrast to heterogeneous methane oxidation catalysts, molecular systems feature the advantage of more precise active site design and tunability. While the presence of O2 may deactivate some molecular methane oxidation catalysts, microscopic electrode engineering can be used to circumvent this pathway. Inspired by the fixation of nitrogen by aerobic bacteria, methane oxidation was achieved under aerobic conditions through the use of an O2 gradient.58
To this end, a silicon nanowire array was used to generate an O2 gradient in which CH4 activation was carried out on a Rh porphyrin catalyst in the interior anaerobic region, while the oxidation of the methane-bound intermediate occurred in the aerobic exterior (Fig. 11). The possible mechanism of CH4 oxidation was proposed as follows: First, a precatalyst was reduced under a positive applied potential and subsequently activated CH4. At the same time, the catalyst can deactivate through reactions with O2. At the silicon nanowire structure, both calculations and experiment proved the existence of an O2 gradient in which the Si nanowire array on the surface of the electrodes significantly extended the anaerobic region where the catalyst was functional. This was experimentally probed with operando phosphorescence measurements. A follow-up study pointed to an 81% efficiency for generating the RhII metalloradical species in the nanowire channels as opposed to 0% in an electrode with a planar geometry.59 Overall, these works provided a new avenue for catalyst design through microscopic morphology tuning.

Along the same line of electrochemical regeneration of molecular species, PtIV salts consumed in a methane oxidation catalytic cycle were able to be reformed to give rise to a sustained methane oxidation system. Typically, PtIV is active towards methane conversion to methanol but is stoichiometrically consumed in the process and converted to PtII. However, Pt electrodes with surface-adsorbed Cl species were shown to be active in converting the PtII back to PtIV and thus re-initiating the catalytic pathway. By maintaining a consistent PtII/PtIV ratio in the solution, activity over extended time-periods (10 h) was maintained.60 This methodology was further extended to Pd-based systems in which simple PdSO4 species were oxidized to a dimeric PdIII–PdIII species as the active catalyst for methane oxidation.61 Electroanalytical, theoretical and in situ NMR studies pointed to the abstraction of an H atom from methane to form the ˙CH3 radical as the rate limiting step in the process and highlighted this step's general importance in methane oxidation electrocatalysis (Fig. 12).62

Conclusions
In all, this work touched on recent works advancing the state-of-the-art in emerging electrosynthetic reactions. We particularly paid attention to how the structure of the catalyst active site at a molecular level dictates a system's performance at the macroscopic level. For example, the bottom-up design of HMF oxidation catalysts and the discovery of their precise function puts forth foundational knowledge of how (1) HMF initial binding to the active site, (2) active site electronic structure and redox activity throughout the catalytic cycle, and (3) the presence of proximal hydrogen abstraction sites all determine the reaction pathway and efficiency of the reaction. Similarly, the bottom-up design of methane oxidation catalysts that generate reactive M–O* species was deemed essential for heterogeneous systems. For homogeneous systems, the electrochemical generation of reactive species was a critical step and particularly important were spectroscopic and other analytical methods that identified these metastable species. For both HMF and methane oxidation catalyst discovery, an overview of the foundational works cited here paints a picture in which the synergy between complementary material synthesis, spectroscopic/analytical methodology, and theoretical modelling is necessary to put forth the most complete stories and hence the most impactful works in this field.
It is expected that these directions will increasingly carry more importance in concurrence with the fall in renewable electricity prices and urgency in sustainability research. Though there still remains a considerable gap between academic research and industrial applicability, the foundational work covered here with atomically precise catalytic systems serves as a promising foundation from which to build.
