    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractThe wavelength of incident light can be shifted by down-conversion (DC) and up-conversion (UC) photofluorescence. DC and UC molecules are typically independent one-way conversion species, and UC should be stimulated by a laser source. In this paper, we find that diazoacetate- and fumarate-containing fluorescent molecules are wavelength-focusing species of simulated solar radiation. Monochromatic UV and NIR lights (354/696, 457/819 or 346/686 nm) are synchronously focused to 454, 473 or 454 nm, respectively, using (5R)-5-cyano-3-carbmenthoxy-2-pyrazoline, 3-carbethoxy-2-pyrazoline grafted polyvinyl alcohol and a cyclic oligomer of ethyl diazoacetate with carbethoxy carbene and allyl acrylate. With a broadband light source, portions of the 300–500 nm and 580–800 nm wavelength bands of incident light are synchronously converted to 507 nm using a copolymer of PEG and fumarate, which offers a promising way to harvest the UV and NIR portions of sunlight in the visible region.
Focusing wavelengths refers to shifting unequal wavelengths to equal wavelengths, and wavelength-focusing (WF) molecules should be able to shift portions of shorter and longer wavelengths of incident light to an identical wavelength in between, by which polychromatic light is converted to monochromatic light, and a broad spectrum is narrowed down (Fig. 1a and b). One of the well-known methods for shifting wavelength is photofluorescence, which is a mono-/mono-wavelength process, i.e., the wavelengths of excitation and emission light are both single. However, focusing wavelengths is a multiple-/mono-wavelength process, in which the wavelength of excitation light is multiple but that of emission light is single. A monofluorophore molecule is typically considered as an independent one-way (down- or up-) conversion species,1–3 and a two-way conversion (TWC) system results from the combination of DC and UC species.4 Recently, we reported that two types of ethyl diazoacetate (EDA)-containing oligomers are TWC fluorescent molecules and that the emitted wavelengths of DC and UC are identical,5,6 indicating that EDA offers the possibility of focusing wavelengths similar to how refraction offers the possibility of focusing light itself.

The visible portion of sunlight is industrially transformed into power by using silicon solar cells and is also the light source of light-catalyzed water splitting into hydrogen, dye-sensitized solar cells, organic solar cells and thin-film silicon solar cells. Focusing the UV and IR portions of sunlight in the visible spectral region and then transforming the visible light into power or hydrogen energy is an easier, more convenient and more economical substitute for directly harvesting them. Using this approach, the efficiency of solar energy is significantly enhanced with the increasing intensity of the visible portion of sunlight.7 In the last decade, several efforts have been made towards developing DC and UC solar cells with rare earth nanoparticles and triplet–triplet annihilation, and the photoluminescence was often excited by a monochromatic laser.8,9 However, the UV and IR portions of sunlight are polychromatic and considerably weaker than a laser. Moreover, DC and UC devices and systems are complex, and their preparations are cumbersome.10 To overcome these challenges, we developed WF monofluorophore molecules that not only are stimulated by two or more monochromic UV and IR portions of a Xenon light source but also emit visible light at an identical wavelength. Diazoacetate- and fumarate-containing molecules are such species. For example, regardless of whether 346 or 686 nm light was absorbed by a cyclic oligomer of EDA with carbethoxy carbene and allyl acrylate (EDA–CEC–AA), only 452 nm fluorescence was emitted (Fig. 1a). Another example is a copolymer of PEG and fumarate (CoPF), which was stimulated using wavelength bands of 300–500 nm and 580–900 nm broadband light and emitted light at only 507 nm (Fig. 1b).
The WF behavior of diazoacetate-containing molecules was further confirmed via fluorescence imaging, in addition to its spectroscopic characterization. The fluorescence images of an EDA–CEC–AA specimen via two-photon laser scanning confocal microscopy with excitation light of 405 (Em1) and 700 nm (Em2), as well as the merged image of Em1 and Em2, which is brighter than that of Em1 or Em2, are shown in Fig. 1c. These results indicate that EDA–CEC–AA is a WF monofluorophore species. The cell fluorescence images (Fig. 1d–g) of 3-carbethoxy-2-pyrazoline grafted polyvinyl alcohol (CEP-g-PVA) (Fig. S1, ESI†) show that it is also a WF monofluorophore species compared with those of EDA–CEC–AA (Fig. 1h–k).
We initiated our investigation by carefully re-checking the fluorescence behavior of EDA again to understand the transformation of EDA from an independent non-fluorescent molecule into a WF fluorophore and observed that EDA shows two excitation peaks at 338 and 667 nm and one emission peak at 480 nm in its amplified excitation and emission spectra (Fig. 2a–c). Without amplification, the two excitation peaks are not sufficiently strong enough to be identified. In stark contrast, stronger Rayleigh scattering peaks were recorded. The fluorescence emission of EDA appeared to be almost entirely suppressed by the Rayleigh scattering, which suggests that the diazoacetate group may act as a strong fluorophore if it participates in cycloaddition or polymerization as a subunit to form a macromolecule, its polarizability is changed11 and Rayleigh scattering is greatly reduced. Additionally, CN–N in the pyrazoline ring has a resonance effect with the adjacent nitrogen atom and transforms to C–NN that is also a subunit in EDA-containing co-polymer EDA–CEC–AA. The azo group is suppressed by the rigid pyrazoline ring or polymer chain, resulting in the enhancement of the fluorescence properties of the azo group.12–15 Rayleigh scattering exhibits polarizability-dependent optical behavior; this behavior may be reduced by increasing the size of diazoacetate-containing fluorescent molecules to change their polarizability. We designed and synthesized (5R)-5-cyano-3-carbmenthoxy-2-pyrazoline (5R-CCMP), CEP-g-PVA and cyclic EDA–CEC–AA. 5-cyano-3-carbethoxy-2-pyrazoline (CCEP) and 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2-pyrazoline (DCEP) were also synthesized for comparison. 5R-CCMP is a pure enantiomer, and its specific rotation αD is −87° (ethanol). It was first synthesized by our group by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of (−)-menthyl diazoacetate with acrylonitrile, and its molecular structure was characterized via1H NMR and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. S2, S3 and Table S1, ESI†). The absolute configuration of the chiral carbon atom in the pyrazoline ring was 5R-.

The five types of diazoacetate-containing molecules were all stimulated by two monochromic lights and were able to focus the two monochromic lights into one monochromatic light. For example, their DC/UC excitation wavelengths were 354/696 (5R-CCMP), 457/819 (CEP-g-PVA), 346/686 (EDA–CEC–AA), 358/699 (CCEP) and 354/694 nm (DCEP), and their emitted wavelengths were 454, 473, 454, 444 and 442 nm, respectively (Fig. 2a–c). In our discussion below, the competition of emission with Rayleigh scattering is indicated by the ratio of emission to scattering intensity; Em1/Sca1 and Em2/Sca2 denote the emission/scattering of DC and UC, respectively. Using Em2/Sca2 as an example, those of the five synthesized EDA-containing molecules were 6.17 (5R-CCMP), 0.82 (CEP-g-PVA), 17.93 (cyclic EDA–CEC–AA), 0.66 (CCEP) and 0.63 (DCEP) (Fig. 2d), which represent a twenty- to six-hundred-fold increase compared to that of EDA (0.029), and the DC quantum yield (ϕ) of 5R-CCMP, CEP-g-PVA, cyclic EDA–CEC–AA, CCEP and DCEP are 3.78%, 1.96%, 10.35%, 1.89% and 1.56%, respectively, which were measured using the method of Williams and Winfield.16 Rayleigh scattering of the cyclic molecules was significantly reduced, and the fluorescence emission and quantum yield considerably increased as a result. The results strongly support the notion that WF is the inherent characteristic of the diazoacetate group even though it is negligible in an independent EDA molecule. Furthermore, larger EDA-containing molecules with effectively reduced Rayleigh scattering are WF species and can focus monochromic UV and NIR light into monochromic visible light.
The fluorophores in 5R-CCMP and CCEP are identical, but the Em2/Sca2 of 5R-CCMP (6.17) is seven times larger than that of CCEP (0.82), indicating that the Em2/Sca2 value is not just polarizability-dependent. Structurally, the difference between 5R-CCMP and CCEP is the substituted group at position 3, which is a carbmenthoxy group in 5R-CCMP but a carbethoxy in CCEP. The crystal structures of 5R-CCMP and CCEP indicate that the former is “T” shaped by two cyclic subunits, whereas the latter appears as a linear “L” (Fig. 3a). The molecular shape also affects the competition of emission and Rayleigh scattering considerably.

In our previous work, we detected that cyclic oligo(3,4,5-tricarbethoxy-2-pyrazoline) exhibited strong fluorescence and oligo(1,4-butanediol-bis(5-carbonyl-3-carbethoxy-2-pyrazoline)) exhibited a high quantum yield (ϕ = 51.84%), but their monomers 3,4,5-tricarbethoxy-2-pyrazoline (TCEP) and 1,4-butanediol-bis(5-carbonyl-3-carbethoxy-2-pyrazoline) were weakly fluorescent species, which indicates that cyclopolymerization is an efficient way to enhance the fluorescence of a chromophore.12,17 Our present work shows that EDA undergoes cyclocopolymerization with allyl acrylate to give EDA–CEC–AA (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†), in which CEC is formed via the release of nitrogen from EDA. The novel cyclic terpolymer is a promising WF macromolecule with an Em2/Sca2 value of up to 17.9, which is not only six hundred times larger than that of EDA (0.029) but also 1.6 times larger than those of Rhodamine B and Calcein (11.2 and 11.3, respectively).
The fluorescence emission of DCEP (Em2/Sca2: 0.63) can be further enhanced by its stacking, which was achieved by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of EDA with polyvinyl acrylate. In this manner, the Em2/Sca2 increased from 0.029 (EDA) to 0.82 (CEP-g-PVA), showing the synergistic effect of the pyrazoline stacking and EDA cycloaddition reaction (Fig. 2a–c).
The excitation spectra of the EDA, 5R-CCMP, CEP-g-PVA, TCEP, DCEP, CCEP and CoPF show that the two excitation peaks are wavelength doubled. For example, the excitation wavelengths of EDA are 338 (λEx1) and 667 (λEx2) nm, and those of DCEP are 354 (λEx1) and 694 (λEx2) nm. The ratios of their λEx2 to λEx1 are approximately 2 (Fig. 3b), similar to that of frequency doubling scattering, which is a well-known phenomenon in fluorescence detection. Among those molecules, 3-carbalkoxy-2-pyrazolines are prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkyl diazoacetate with heteroatom-conjugated olefins, such as ethyl acrylate, diethyl maleate and acrylonitrile. In terms of energy levels all these molecules are three-level systems, Eπ, Eπ* and an intermediate level (Ei) that sits around the half of Eπ*. With 5R-CCMP as an example, Eπ* is 3.51 eV (λEx1 354 nm) and Ei is 1.78 eV (λEx2 696 nm), by which π–π* transition can take either a single-photon process at 354 nm (in DC) or a two-photon process at 696 nm (in UC). We verified that the UC fluorescence of these wavelength-doubled excitation molecules originates from the two-photon absorption (Fig. 3c and d).
The diazoacetate chromophore comprises two double bands, NN and CO, by which only a single wavelength of UV and NIR light is focused. However, the UV and IR portions of the solar spectrum are both multi-wavelength lights. We detected that polyethyleneglycol (PEG) is also the Rayleigh scattered and wavelength-focusing molecule (blue line in Fig. 4a) and has two broadband excitation peaks (Ex1: 260–368 nm and Ex2: 524–737 nm). However, it was never considered as a fluorescence species, which may transform into the component of a multi-wavelength-focusing molecule. The excitation spectrum of ECP-g-PVA in Fig. 2a clearly shows that the second effect of polymerization on the WF molecules is to increase the width of the excitation peak, by which the broadband WF molecules may be obtained. However, the width of the excitation peak and the intensity of the emitted fluorescence of PEG 1000 did not increase as its molar mass increased to PEG 3000. Thus, a copolymer of PEG with dicarboxylic acid was evaluated. Diethyl maleate, fumarate and terephthalate are Rayleigh scattered and wavelength-focusing species because they are π–π–π conjugated molecules (cis/trans OC–CC–CO and OC–ph–CO). Our results indicate that the fluorescence signals of cis-OC–CC–CO (maleate) and linear OC–ph–CO (terephthalate) are extremely weak, but trans-OC–CC–CO (fumarate) appears to be a promising chromophore for continuous wavelength focusing, showing two strong broadband excitation peaks with bandwidths from 326 to 432 nm and from 661 to 835 nm (green line in Fig. 4a). In contrast, its scattering peak (447 nm) is relatively weak. We synthesized CoPFs from fumaryl chloride with PEG 800, PEG 1000 and PEG 3000 to produce multi-wavelength-focusing polymers and found that the two excitation peaks of CoP1000F (ϕ = 2.23%) were widened from 313 to 501 nm and from 605 to 900 nm and that the scatting peak of PEG was weakened significantly (red line in Fig. 4a). The half-width of the DC excitation peak of CoP1000F is 110 nm (from 358 to 468 nm), and the half-width of the UC excitation peak is 189 nm (from 669 to 858 nm) (cf.Fig. 1b). However, the half peak width of the DC excitation peak of diethyl fumarate is 57 nm, and the half peak width of its UC excitation peak is 97 nm, which indicates that polymerization is a distinctive way to widen the absorption band of trans-OC–CC–CO. The maximum emitted wavelength of CoP1000F remained constant when the excitation wavelength varied from 378 to 425 nm and from 754 to 834 nm. Fig. 4b shows some emitted peaks of CoPF, which was stimulated by 378, 388, 425, 754, 784, 814 and 834 nm light but emitted fluorescence at approximately 507 nm. The results indicate that CoPF is a photofluorescence species that can focus broadband UV and NIR light.

The dashed line is the excitation spectrum. (c) The emission spectra of CoPF and DMSO stimulated by a Laser-Driven Light Source. The red line is 0.2 times light intensity of the spectral output of a Laser-Driven Light Source. (d) The red line is the fluorescence spectrum of CoPF stimulated by a Laser-Driven Light Source and the black line is the superposition of the fluorescence intensity of CoPF stimulated by 378, 388, 415, 425, 754, 784, 804, 814, 824 and 834 nm light (fluorescence spectrophotometer) with the slit width set at 5.0 for both monochromators. 
The simultaneous focusing of broadband UV and NIR light by CoPF was conducted with a laser-driven light source that provided 190 to 2100 nm of multichromatic light, which was recorded by an optical-fiber spectrometer in the lateral direction without using any blocking optical filter. As expected, an emitted peak of CoPF was recorded at 528 nm on a PG2000-EX spectrometer when it was simultaneously stimulated by the broadband incident light (Fig. 4c), whereas the fluorescence emission peak of DMSO was extremely weak, when DMSO was used as a solvent in CoPF detection. We experimentally obtained another broadband-stimulated emitted peak of CoPF indirectly by combining the intensities of monochromatic light stimulated emitted peaks of CoPF with excitation wavelengths at 378, 388, 415, 425, 754, 784, 804, 814, 824 and 834 nm. Fig. 4d shows that the WF process of CoPF in single-wavelength excitation is nearly the same as that in multi-wavelength excitation.
WF is the unique characteristic of diazoacetate- and fumarate-containing molecules, which are able to focus wavelengths under low-power irradiation (from 3.5 to 4.0 mW cm−2) with extremely simple organic monofluorophore molecules but not complex DC + UC systems and devices. For EDA–CEC–AA the intensity of the excitation peak at 686 nm is a little stronger than that at 346 nm, showing that it can convert more NIR portion of sunlight into a visible band, and in the case of CoPF, two excitation wavelength bands range from 358 to 468 nm and from 669 to 858 nm, respectively, by which more UV and NIR bands in the solar spectrum can be harvested through photofluorescence.
