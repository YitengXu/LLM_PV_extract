    , Accepted 10th June 2021First published on 10th June 2021AbstractMicrostructure modulation is an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for solar energy conversion. In the present work, abundant carbon defects and holes in g-C3N4 have been successfully created with a novel NH4Br-assisted programmed heating method. The decomposition of NH4Br provides an ammonia atmosphere for the preparation of g-C3N4. It also acts as an exfoliating agent, which not only dramatically decreases the average layer thickness, but also creates abundant holes on the surface of planar nanosheets. The g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared have a significantly enlarged surface area and more exposed catalytically active sites. More importantly, carbon vacancies were simultaneously introduced in the tri-s-triazine repeating units of g-C3N4, which leads to greatly suppressed recombination of charge carriers and increased concentration of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a result, this holey g-C3N4 (CN–Br) photocatalyst showed a much higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity (5-fold) and photooxidative ability (12 times) under visible light irradiation in comparison with bulk CN. The newly developed synthetic strategy is simple and convenient, and might be used in the design of other efficient photocatalysts.
Introduction
Semiconductor-based photocatalytic conversion of solar energy has attracted enormous attention due to its potential contribution to the energy supply and alleviation of environmental pollution.1 The development of high-efficiency, visible-light responsive photocatalysts is still a challenge, because the performance of a photocatalyst is an integrated result of morphology, microstructure, surface defects, and chemical composition.2,3 All these items are affected dominantly by the preparation methods. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged in the recent years as the “star material” of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts.4,5 It possesses an appropriate optical bandgap (∼2.70 eV) and favorable chemical stability, and is obtained by cost-effective synthetic methods from inexpensive organic molecules (melamine, dicyandiamide, or urea).6 Traditionally, g-C3N4 is prepared by direct thermal polymerization methods, which results in 2D stacked graphite-like multilayer superstructures. Such bulk superstructures are usually tens or even hundreds of nanometers thick and consist of dozens of stacked g-C3N4 layers, which not only leads to a low surface area, but also severely hinders electron migration.7 Consequently, g-C3N4 suffers from rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and low photocatalytic activity. In order to overcome its weaknesses, numerous efforts have been devoted to increase the surface area and accelerate the diffusion and separation of photogenerated charges, such as modifying with metals (Ag, Cu, Pt, Na, etc.) or metal oxides (CoOx) for electron or hole capture, coupling with other semiconductors to form heterojunctions, optimizing the morphology to increase the surface area and number of reaction active sites, etc.8,9 However, these extrinsic surface modification approaches can't exert a significant effect on the intrinsic chemical structure of g-C3N4, such as atomic arrangement, charge density distribution, and chemical bond interaction. This reminds us to pay attention to the chemical composition and intrinsic polymeric network structure, which are the basic factors for varying the properties of g-C3N4 materials.
g-C3N4 has a condensed 2D layered structure consisting of tri-s-triazine units interconnected via tertiary amine units, which stacks through van der Waals interactions between neighbouring layers. Excessive stacking and agglomeration dramatically decrease the surface area and the number of exposed catalytically active sites. It has been found that a decrease of the layer number by exfoliation could provide more surface-active sites, enhance the affinity with solvents, and shorten the diffusion paths of charge carriers.10 Yang et al. employed a continuous sonication method to exfoliate bulk g-C3N4 into nanosheets in isopropyl alcohol solvent.11 The resulting nanosheets were about 2 nm thick, which dramatically reduced the electron transfer resistance. In addition to sonication exfoliation, other exfoliation methods including mechanical exfoliation, acid/base solution exfoliation, thermal-oxidation exfoliation, and hydrothermal exfoliation have been reported in the literature.12 These exfoliation methods required the post-treatment of bulk g-C3N4 materials under harsh conditions for breaking the strong inter-layer van der Waals forces. In addition, the long-range polymerization (mainly aromatic C–N heterocycles) in g-C3N4 leads to insufficient exposed edges and increases the recombination possibility of charge carriers. Breaking the 2D conjugated structure by introducing defects is likely to be a useful strategy to alleviate the above problems.13 Both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that defects in the in-plane tri-s-triazine repeating units could generate additional energy levels in the bandgap and then affect the charge density distribution. Some of the defects could serve as trapping sites for photogenerated charge carriers to facilitate photocatalytic reactions rather than being recombination centers of electrons and holes.14 The introduction of nitrogen vacancy defects into the planar conjugated network is more easily realized compared with the formation of carbon vacancy defects due to the low thermodynamic stability of N atoms in the carbon framework.15 As a result, g-C3N4 materials with nitrogen defects are more accessible to obtain and have been developed in many reports. For example, Zhang and co-workers developed a KOH-assisted one-step route, which can introduce two types of nitrogen defects into g-C3N4 at the same time.16 Nitrogen defects can also be introduced by NaBH4 treatment or thermally treating bulk g-C3N4 in a H2/N2/Ar atmosphere.17 However, it is more challenging and uncontrollable to construct carbon-vacancy modified g-C3N4via a convenient method. The present g-C3N4 with carbon vacancy need heating under a pure NH3 atmosphere and causes large security concerns.18 Therefore, few studies that focused on the effect of carbon vacancies on photocatalytic performance were reported. Searching for a facile and safe strategy of carbon defect introduction in carbon nitride materials is highly desirable.
Based on the facts mentioned above, we are aware of the important effect of ammonia molecules on the formation of carbon vacancies. It was proposed that ammonium halides can serve as templates to modify the morphology of semiconductors.13,19 The decomposition process of ammonium halides produces a large volume of ammonia. So, we wondered if carbon vacancies could be created in carbon nitrides by directly using the ammonia from the decomposition of ammonium halides. On the basis of the above analysis, we developed a safe and facile one-step strategy to fabricate carbon defect rich g-C3N4 (CN–Br) via a co-pyrolysis route utilizing melamine and ammonium bromide (NH4Br) as precursors. At the same time, due to the complex and diverse intermediates involved in the formation process of carbon nitride materials, most studies focus on the structure and activity of the obtained materials and neglect the study of the intermediate properties and formation mechanism of the materials. Our case, for the first time, studied the relevant intermediates during the programmed heating process and the effect of NH4Br on the morphology, structure and chemical environment aspects in detail. The “One Stone, Three Birds” capability of the NH4Br-assisted programmed heating method was found. First, its decomposition created an ammonia atmosphere, which helped in the formation of carbon vacancies in the structure of g-C3N4. Secondly, it can act as an exfoliating agent to dramatically decrease the average layer thickness and produce numerous in-plane holes on the surface of planar nanosheets. The abundant carbon defects lead to improvement of the electron delocalization, and then greatly suppress the recombination of charge carriers. Structural characterization also show that the presence of NH4Br during the programmed heating process can lead to a significantly enlarged surface area of CN–Br. Consequently, the new CN–Br material exhibits a more efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution activity (5-fold) and photooxidative ability (12 times) under visible light irradiation in comparison with bulk CN.
Results and discussion
Formation mechanism of porous CN–Br
CN–Br was obtained via one-step co-pyrolysis of melamine and NH4Br in a static air atmosphere with programmed heating procedures as described in the experimental section.† We firstly explored the formation mechanism of the porous morphology of CN–Br and the critical role of NH4Br. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of NH4Br in Fig. 1a shows a dramatic weight loss in temperature range of 200–360 °C, which is very close to the thermal polymerization temperature of melamine (340 °C). However, the TGA curve of the melamine–NH4Br mixture exhibited three typical decomposition peaks at temperatures of 320 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C, respectively. A steep weight loss was observed below 320 °C, followed by a gentle weight loss at about 320–500 °C and an inflection point at 450 °C. To identify the formed intermediates during the heating process, we treated the melamine–NH4Br mixture at 320 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C and maintained these temperatures for 2 hours. The samples are named CN–Br-T320, CN–Br-T450, and CN–Br-T500, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1d, the SEM image of CN–Br-T320 presents many chunky particles with an irregular shape. With the temperature raised to 450 °C, the SEM images of CN–Br-T450 show a porous skeleton of carbon nitride with uneven holes and grooves on the surface. When the temperature reached 500 °C, CN–Br-T500 presents a three-dimensional interconnected open framework and possesses abundant holes.

(m) Schematic illustration of the formation of jellyfish-like holey g-C3N4. 
XRD patterns and FTIR spectra further reveal structural changes during the co-pyrolysis process. As shown in Fig. 1b, CN–Br-T320 shows a series of XRD peaks located at 21.87°, 31.12°, 38.36°, 44.59°, 50.18° and 55.37°, which are assigned to the (100), (110), (111), (200), (210) and (211) crystal planes of pure NH4Br (PDF card: 36-1469).19 This indicates that CN–Br-T320 contains a great quantity of NH4Br, which can be attributed to the low reaction temperature and NH4Br not being able to decompose completely at this temperature. In the magnified pattern in Fig. 1c, it is noted that several small peaks are identified at 2θ values of 25.1° and 26.6°. The small peaks at 25.1° (d = 0.355 nm) and 26.6° (d = 0.333 nm) correspond well to the pseudo-(002) stacking motif of nascent carbon nitride domains like melam or oligomers and the concomitant protonation of the carbon nitride [C6N9H4]+ network.20 This XRD result indicates that the chemical reactions, including pyrolysis and condensation of melamine, have indeed occurred in the presence of NH4Br at 320 °C and a new Br-containing intermediate was formed (detailed discussion is presented below with the assistance of FTIR characterization), although the reaction is far from complete. As the temperature increased to 450 °C, a set of distinct XRD peaks are observed at 2θ values of 12.21°, 13.36°, 16.43°, 18.04°, 19.34°, 19.58°, 25.85°, 26.34° and 27.81°, which are indexed to the monoclinic unit cell of melem.21,22 This reveals the presence of a stepwise polymerization process, in which melam or its oligomers further condense to melem (detailed condensation route can be seen in Scheme S1 in the ESI†).23 As for CN–Br-T500, two characteristic peaks located at around 27.0° and 13.0° indicate the formation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The broad (002) peak at 27.0° corresponds to a 0.32 nm interplanar stacking distance between neighbouring g-C3N4 sheets. Another weak peak at about 13.0° was specific for the in-plane structural packing of tri-s-triazine units with a 0.68 nm spacing.24
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed also to further reveal the change of functional moieties during the co-pyrolysis process (Fig. 1h–k). The characteristic broad peaks between 2900 and 3600 cm−1 in all samples can be attributed to the combined symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of N–H (2900–3300 cm−1) and O–H (3300–3600 cm−1) bonds.25 It should be noted that CN–Br-T500 shows obviously blue-shifted N–H stretching peaks with a distinctive reduced intensity in comparison with the other samples. This is an indication of the reduced concentration of –NHx groups during g-C3N4 formation.13
Apart from the high-frequency region above 2900 cm−1, the CN–Br samples synthesized at different temperatures show obvious differences in three regions, i.e. 2700–2900 cm−1 (region 1), 1200–1900 cm−1 (region 2) and 780–810 cm−1 (region 3). CN–Br-T320 shows a new peak at 2790 cm−1 in region 1 as shown in Fig. 1i. This characteristic peak is attributed to the special low N–H stretching frequency in the presence of halide ions, which has been studied in detail by Wolf and co-workers.26 Based on the XRD result in Fig. 1c, CN–Br-T320 sample contains concomitant protonation of the carbon nitride [C6N9H4]+ network and additional N–H species should be formed through the protonation of melam or melam oligomers. Each Br− occupies a large network void compensating the charge of hydrogen ions protonating the network, which results in the obvious high shift of binding energy of the Br 3d XPS spectrum and indicates the lower electron density of Br (Fig. S1†). The hydrogen ion protonates the axial electron lone pair of the nitrogen atom within the C3N3 heterocycle and forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the nitrogen atom on an adjacent heterocycle. As a result, the stretching vibration of this Br-containing structure (R2NH+⋯N unit) results in the unusually low N–H stretching frequency at 2790 cm−1. With the completion of the co-pyrolysis process, the stacking space of the (002) plane in the CN–Br sample was enlarged in comparison with that of pure CN (without Br incorporation). As shown in Fig. 1j, the FTIR spectrum of CN–Br-T320 shows also a series of peaks at 1676, 1646, 1559, 1506, 1364, and 1337 cm−1 in region 2, which can be assigned to the stretching vibration modes of C–N heterocycles from the nascent carbon nitride domains like melam or oligomers, which is in good agreement with previous reports.27,28 The FTIR spectrum of CN–Br-T450 shows peaks at 1648, 1603, 1514, 1475, 1330, and 1274 cm−1 due to C–N stretching of the tri-s-triazine (C6N7) aromatic nucleus of the melem structure. After the conversion of melem into g-C3N4 by increasing the temperature to 500 °C, CN–Br-T500 still retains the skeletal stretching vibrations of aromatic C3N4 heterocycles with a slight shift in peak positions. But, the bending vibration peak of N–H in NH4Br (at 1400 cm−1) disappeared. Additionally, a gradually enhanced peak emerged at 780–810 cm−1 (region 3 in Fig. 1k) with increasing co-pyrolysis temperature and the peak position blue-shifted from 781 cm−1 for CN–Br-T320 to 809 cm−1 for CN–Br-T500. Generally, the IR band at ∼800 cm−1 reflects the out-of-plane bending vibration of conjugated structure rings like tri-s-triazine.27 Both intensity enhancement and position shift of this peak further confirm the stepwise formation of the tri-s-triazine structure and the improvement of the conjugated structure with the increase of temperature, which is consistent with the results of the XRD and TGA experiments.
Based on the above characterization and analysis, the schematic formation mechanism of the porous g-C3N4 can be illustrated in Fig. 1m. Melamine first reacts with a substantial amount of NH4Br to produce a Br-containing intermediate with an irregular chunky particle morphology. The structure of this Br-containing intermediate is a protonated oligomer network, in which bromine ions occupy the periodic voids of the oligomer network. With the temperature increasing to 450 °C, melam oligomers further deaminate and polymerize to form highly conjugated tri-s-triazine structures. Accompanied with the release of NH3, HBr and other gases, a porous skeleton and carbon defects are formed. At about 500 °C, tri-s-triazine moieties are connected through tertiary amino groups, melem is transformed into melon, and a long-range ordered intralayer framework is formed. Owing to the etching effect and pore-creating ability of NH3, CN–Br-T500 shows an irregular macroscopic network with abundant pores.
Structure and morphology of the CN–Br samples
By controlling the molar ratios of melamine to NH4Br (1:10, 1:30, and 1:40) during the preparation process, a series of graphitic carbon nitrides with a three-dimensional interconnected open framework were obtained, which are denoted as CN–Br (1:10), CN–Br (1:30), and CN–Br (1:40), respectively. For comparison, pure bulk g-C3N4 (CN) was also prepared under the same conditions but without adding NH4Br. The morphologies of the resulting samples were examined by SEM, TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is observed that CN is composed of aggregates of stacking layers with a size of tens of microns and dense folded edges of the stacking structure (Fig. 2a and b). CN–Br (1:30) exhibits an irregular macroscopic network and numerous uniformly distributed holes on the surface of planar nanosheets (Fig. 2c and d). The average pore width is around ∼18 nm (Fig. S2†). This holey planar structure can be attributed to the etching effect of alkaline NH3, which suppresses the long-range polymerization. This holey planar structure endows CN–Br (1:30) with more exposed active sites and cross-plane diffusion channels for mass transfer,18 which should be beneficial to the catalytic reaction. The average layer thickness decreases from 7.7–12 nm for bulk CN to 4–7.5 nm for CN–Br (1:30) as shown in Fig. S3,† revealing the presence of the exfoliation effect of NH4Br during the co-pyrolysis process. CN–Br exhibits a larger surface area than bulk CN (Fig. S4†) due to this reduced layer thickness. The maximum value of surface area reaches about 50 m2 g−1 for CN–Br (1:30), which is approximately 3.6 times larger than that of bulk CN. The increased surface area could provide more active sites and enhance interfacial contact with the reactant, which should also facilitate the photocatalytic reaction.

Subsequently, the phase structures of the CN and as-prepared CN–Br samples were characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2e, two characteristic peaks at 13.0° and 27.2° can be observed on all samples, which can be attributed to the in-plane structural packing motif (100) and periodic stacking (002), respectively.24 The existence of the two peaks and the signals in the FTIR spectra in Fig. S5† indicate that the chemical skeleton of g-C3N4 (JCPDS No. 87-1527) is well-maintained after introducing NH4Br. However, compared with that for CN, the peak of the (002) lattice plane moves from 27.2° for CN to 27.0° for CN–Br, indicating a slightly enlarged interlayer spacing.29 This should be attributed to the incorporation of Br− in the net framework. At the same time, diffraction peaks of both the (100) and (002) planes in the CN–Br samples become weaker and broader than those in CN, suggesting the decreased on-stacking degree of tri-s-triazine rings along the z-axis, corresponding well to the results from AFM observation. It should be noted that the peak of (100) plane of both CN–Br (1:30) and CN–Br (1:40) is extremely small, implying the presence of numerous in-plane defects in CN–Br. These results can be ascribed to the presence of NH4Br, which acts as an exfoliating and etching agent, and causes the loss of long-range ordered structures and the formation of defects within the g-C3N4 framework.
Composition and chemical structure
The composition and content of the N and C elements in the CN and CN–Br samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) experiments. As shown in Fig. 2g, the atomic ratio of C to N in CN–Br (1:30) is about 0.69, which is much lower than the value of 0.82 determined for the CN sample and 0.75 for the stoichiometric C3N4. Similar values appeared in the CN–Br (1:10) and (1:40) samples (Fig. S6 and Table S1†), which are 0.74 and 0.62, respectively. The obviously lower carbon content of the CN–Br samples in comparison with that of CN suggests the presence of carbon vacancy defects. The surface C/N atomic ratios measured by using XPS analysis are 0.71 for CN–Br (1:30) and 0.79 for bulk CN (Fig. S6†), which are similar to those measured with ICP-AES. In addition, the chemical state of atoms in bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) was further studied by XPS. The full survey spectra show the C, N, and O elements in both samples. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra in Fig. S7b† show that the CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples present similar peaks at about 532.0 eV, corresponding to the surface adsorbed oxygen-containing species (like H2O).30,31Fig. 2i presents the high-resolution C 1s spectra of these two samples, which can be decomposed into three Gaussian–Lorentzian peaks. The peaks centered at 284.7 eV, 286.1 eV, and 288.2 eV can be assigned to graphitic carbon atoms (C–C/CC), carbon atoms connected to NHx on the edges of tri-s-triazine units, and the carbon atoms with sp2 hybrid orbitals of NC–N species in the tri-s-triazine ring of g-C3N4, respectively.32,33 Compared with that in bulk CN, the peak area of the NC–N carbon (288.2 eV) in CN–Br (1:30) decreased obviously. The peak area percentage of NC–N carbon with respect to the sum of the peak areas of all carbon atoms, N–CN, C–NHx and graphitic carbon (C–C/CC), decreases from 51.50% for bulk CN to 40.42% for CN–Br (1:30) (Table S1 and Fig. S8†), which means carbon vacancies are created at the position of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in the N containing aromatic rings. Meanwhile, the N 1s XPS spectra of these two samples (Fig. 2j) can be deconvoluted into four peaks located at 398.7 eV, 400.0 eV, 401.1 eV and 404.3 eV, respectively. The most intense peak at 398.7 eV corresponds to the sp2-hybridized aromatic N in triazine rings (C–NC, N–C2), and the peak at 400.0 eV is ascribed to the tertiary N atom bonded to C atoms (N–C3).34,35 The peak at a binding energy of 401.1 eV can be indexed to the nitrogen atoms bonded with hydrogen atoms (–NHx).11,18 The aromatic structure (NC–N) and N–C3 are the fundamental building blocks for the triazine or tri-s-triazine rings of g-C3N4.27 Owing to the introduction of carbon defects in the N containing aromatic rings, the peaks of sp2(C–NC) and sp3(N–C3) in CN–Br (1:30) become weak and more –NHx groups are exposed. As expected, the ratio of (sp2(C–NC) + sp3(N–C3)) to –NHx decresed to 8.60 for the CN–Br (1:30) sample, which is obviously smaller than that for bulk CN (Table S1†).
Solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS-NMR) was conducted to identify structural differences before and after the introduction of carbon defects. Compared with CN, the intensity of 13C NMR peaks in CN–Br (1:30) obviously decreased, which is in good agreement with the formation of carbon defects of the CN–Br (1:30) sample. Both bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples show two broad carbon resonance peaks. The signal at 156.7 ppm in both CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples can be assigned to the CN3 moieties of the tri-s-triazine nucleus (characteristic C1 in Fig. 2k).36 CN–Br exhibits another carbon peak at 164.4 ppm, which is different from that of bulk CN (165.1 ppm). This lower field chemical shift is indicative of the coordination environment change of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which are connected directly to more terminal (NH)x species (CN2(NH) and CN2(NH2)).37,38 It should be noted that the introduction of carbon defects in CN–Br (1:30) does not create new types of carbon atoms. Therefore, it is speculated that the carbon vacancies are located at the original sp2-hybridized carbon atoms connected to tri-s-triazine units (Fig. 2h). In addition, the peak intensity ratio of CN2(NH)x to CN3 moieties in CN–Br is ∼1.85, which is much higher than that in bulk CN (value ∼1.79). This further confirmed the presence of carbon defects in the CN–Br samples.
Besides solid-state 13C NMR analysis, the hydrogen environments were further probed by solid-state 1H CP-MAS-NMR. As shown in Fig. 2l, both CN and CN–Br samples exhibit broad NMR signals. By deconvolution of the broad signals using pseudo-Voigt profiles,39 we obtained four peaks. The peaks at 0.88 ppm for CN and 0.46 ppm for CN–Br can be attributed to C–NH/–NH2, and the peaks at around 4.0 ppm can be assigned to H–CN.38,40 It is obvious that the proportion of the H–CN signal at 4.08 ppm for CN–Br (44.81%) is lower than that of the bulk CN sample (56.15%). This result indicates the reduction of the H–CN structure, which should result from the decomposed heptazine units in CN–Br by corrosion with the ammonia released from NH4Br, introducing carbon vacancies. This is consistent with the result of 13C NMR characterization. The signals at 7.02, 8.04, 8.88 and 11.04 ppm are mainly derived from the different hydroxyl species, H2O and residual hydrogen protons adsorbed on the carbon nitride network,21,39,41 which are also detected by XPS analysis.
Optical properties and bandgap structure
The optical properties of the bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples are characterized using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and Mott–Schottky plots. As shown in Fig. 2m, both samples show typical absorption properties of polymeric carbon nitride. Compared with that of bulk CN, the absorption edge of the CN–Br (1:30) sample blue shifted in region 1 and the corresponding optical bandgap increased from 2.836 eV for CN to 2.879 eV for CN–Br (1:30) based on the Tauc plots (inset of Fig. 2m). This intrinsic absorption band is caused by the transition from the populated valence band (2p orbitals of nitrogen atoms) to the conduction band (2p orbitals of carbon atoms) of carbon nitride.21,40,42 The blue shifted absorption edge of CN–Br (1:30) in comparison with that of bulk CN should be attributed to the quantum confinement effect caused by exfoliation and fragmentation of the g-C3N4 structure during the polymerization in the presence of NH4Br (discussed using TEM and AFM images), which is consistent with previous reports.43 In addition, a broad absorption tail, in the region of 450–700 nm (region 2), is clearly observed for the CN–Br (1:30) sample. Several studies reported that both the multiple reflection of incident light in hole-abundant structures and the existence of carbon defects associated with porous surfaces could result in increased optical absorption in the visible region.44,45 In our work, SEM and TEM images show the numerous holes on the surface of planar nanosheets in the CN–Br samples. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that these holes facilitate multiple reflection of incident light and induce the enhanced visible optical absorption. More importantly, from the transition of energy band structure, K. Shankar and Weidong Shi have suggested that the broad absorption tail at around 500 nm can be attributed to n → π* transitions involving lone pairs of the edge nitrogen atoms of –NHX species.22,25 Our XPS and NMR results show that the introduced carbon defects in CN–Br break the integrated tri-s-triazine units and expose more terminal –NHX species, which enhances n → π* transition absorption.

Fig. 2n shows the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of the bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples within frequencies ranging from 1.0 kHz to 3.0 kHz. The obtained positive slopes confirm that the bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples are typical n-type semiconductors.18 The determined flat band potentials from the x-intercepts in the corresponding M–S plots for bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) are −1.107 V and −1.132 V (vs. saturated Ag/AgCl at pH 7.0), respectively, which are equivalent to −0.91 V and −0.935 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).46 The VB-XPS spectra in Fig. 2p show that the energy gap between the valence band (VB) and Fermi level (Ef) is 2.558 eV for bulk CN and 2.605 eV for the CN–Br (1:30) sample, respectively. Generally, the value of the flat band potential is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level.47 Therefore, the VB positions of the bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples are equal to 1.648 eV and 1.679 eV, respectively. Using the formula Eg = EVB − ECB, the conduction band (CB) positions of the bulk CN and three CN–Br samples are calculated to be −1.188 V and −1.209 V, respectively. Such an upshift in the CB and Fermi level of the CN–Br samples leads to enhanced thermodynamic driving force in the photocatalytic reduction of hydrogen protons. The corresponding diagram of the band energy levels of all samples is displayed in Fig. 2q.
Photocatalytic activity and stability
The photocatalytic performance of the carbon-vacancy modified CN–Br samples was evaluated with hydrogen evolution and RhB degradation experiments. As shown in Fig. S9a and b,† bulk CN exhibits a fairly low activity with an average H2 evolution rate of ∼13.7 μmol h−1, while the photocatalytic activity of all CN–Br samples is obviously enhanced. Among the photocatalysts, CN–Br (1:30) shows the highest H2 evolution rate, 68.7 μmol h−1, which is about 5.0 times that of bulk CN. It is well known that the increase of surface area could improve the catalytic activity of photocatalysts due to the enlarged active sites. In addition, the effect of the introduced carbon defects on the photocatalytic performance should be also considered. Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was normalized to the corresponding BET surface area, which excludes the effect of the surface area on the photocatalytic activity and more accurately reflects the effects of carbon defects on the photocatalytic reaction. The point plot in Fig. 3a shows that the hydrogen evolution rate per surface area of CN–Br (1:10) is also much higher than that of bulk CN, suggesting that the introduction of carbon defects has indeed improved the catalytic activity of CN–Br. Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation rate of rhodamine B (RhB) on the CN–Br samples was also much higher than that on bulk CN. Considering the possibility of the photosensitization effect of the RhB dye itself, a series of controlled experiments and characterization steps were carried out to prove the degradation mechanism. The detailed analysis is exhibited in Fig. S10† and the result shows the absence of the sensitization effect during RhB degradation. As illustrated in Fig. 3b and Table S2,† the highest normalized apparent rate constant (k) per surface area for the CN–Br (1:30) sample can reach 1.84 min−1 m−2 g (detailed experimental procedures and calculations are shown in Fig. S11 in the ESI†). This improvement in the catalytic activity of CN–Br is related to the significant enhancement of ˙O2− evolution, which has been verified in controlled experiments with various radical scavengers (Fig. S12a†), EPR experiment with DMPO (Fig. S12b†) and quantitative measurement of ˙O2− concentration (Fig. S12c and d†). The photocatalytic stability of the CN–Br sample was tested in H2 evolution and RhB degradation reactions. The result shown in Fig. 3c suggests that the photocatalytic activity is well maintained in the recycling runs, indicating that the photocatalyst is stable. The structure and surface chemical properties of CN–Br (1:30) remain almost unchanged after photocatalytic reaction, which has been confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS characterization as shown in Fig. S14.†

Photocatalytic mechanism
To deeply understand the reason for the excellent photocatalytic activity of CN–Br (1:30), a series of photoelectric and photochemical characterization steps were performed. At first, room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained to evaluate the electronic nature and paramagnetic species of bulk CN and CN–Br (1:30). Fig. 3d shows the Lorentzian lines with the Lande factor (g) calculated from g = 0.07145 × γ (MHz)/H (mT), where γ is the microwave frequency and H is the magnetic field strength. Both the CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples present the same paramagnetic absorption signal at g = 2.0028. This signal originated from the unpaired electrons on carbon atoms of the aromatic rings in π-bonded clusters, which is beneficial to the mobility of charge carriers.17 As evidenced by the EPR spectra, the intensity of the Lorentzian line of CN–Br (1:30) is noticeably enhanced, which should be related to the increased carbon defect concentration in CN–Br.38 Carbon defects were formed with the loss of carbon atoms from the tri-s-triazine skeleton, which can effectively delocalize the isolated valence electrons in the π-conjugated heterocyclic rings and increase the concentration of unpaired electrons.38 Furthermore, after light irradiation for 10 min, both the CN and CN–Br (1:30) samples exhibit enhanced EPR signals, which is attributed to that more unpaired electrons are formed in conduction band.17,22 It is noted that CN–Br (1:30) with light irradiation shows an enhanced Lorentzian line intensity in the magnetic field regions of 3473–3484 mT and 3524–3536 mT, which reflects the presence of carbon defects.18,48 At the same time, the overall EPR signal intensity enhancement of the CN–Br (1:30) sample under light irradiation over that in the dark (2.71 times) is significantly larger than that of the CN sample (1.56 times). This enhancement further verified the presence of more carbon defects in CN–Br (1:30), which can generate more unpaired electrons under light irradiation and facilitate the photogeneration of active radical pairs in the photocatalytic reactions.38,49
Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra were measured to investigate the photo-induced charge separation. As shown in Fig. 3e, the SPV signal in the region of 300–500 nm corresponds to the electron transition from the VB to the CB of g-C3N4 (band gap transition). The positive signal implies that photogenerated electrons transfer to the bulk inside and photogenerated holes transfer to the surface, which is a representative feature of n-type semiconductors in SPV.50 Compared with bulk CN, the photovoltage signal of CN–Br (1:30) shows two different characters. The first one is the obviously wider photovoltaic response wavelength range of CN–Br (1:30), especially in the range of 450–500 nm. The introduction of carbon vacancies facilitates delocalization of isolated valence electrons in the π-conjugated heterocyclic rings and enhances n → π* transitions of electrons under light irradiation, which is consistent with the enhanced absorption in the long-wavelength region of UV-vis spectra.49 The second one is the significantly reduced photovoltaic response intensity of CN–Br (1:30), meaning that there are more photogenerated electrons accumulating on the surface.51 Both EPR and SPV results attest that the introduction of carbon defects in CN–Br (1:30) is beneficial to generating more electrons with light irradiation transferring to the surface, which is favorable for the catalytic reaction.
The separation and recombination of charge carriers are analyzed by photoluminescence (PL) measurements. From the steady-state PL emission spectra shown in Fig. 3f, bulk CN presents an emission peak at 466 nm, which can be ascribed to the CB to VB recombination of charge carriers. The significantly reduced intensity of PL emission of the CN–Br (1:30) sample demonstrates the dramatically suppressed CB to VB radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs. Absolute fluorescence quantum yield measurements also support this result. CN–Br (1:30) displays a much smaller absolute fluorescence quantum yield than bulk CN (1.77% vs. 5.21%). In addition, the PL emission peak red shifted from 466 nm for the CN sample to 483 nm for the CN–Br (1:30) sample, which can be ascribed to the carbon vacancy defects and is consistent with the enhanced absorption in the long-wavelength region of UV-vis spectra. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decays are also measured at the corresponding emission peaks to investigate the charge separation dynamics and obtain the average radiative lifetime (τave) of charge carriers. As illustrated in Fig. 3g, the CN–Br (1:30) sample exhibits a tri-exponential decay with an average lifetime of 13.60 ns, which is much faster than that of bulk CN (τave ∼21.77 ns). The decreased lifetime demonstrated that the decay of the excited state of CN–Br is more likely to occur through non-radiative pathways, possibly by electron transfer to some the formed carbon defects,52,53 thus improving charge transfer and separation.
The photogenerated charge transport ability is further characterized using photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). As shown in Fig. 3h, all samples show a uniform and fast photocurrent response under visible-light irradiation in light on–off cycles, indicating their stable charge transfer characteristics. Compared with bulk CN, all CN–Br samples exhibit obviously enhanced photocurrent intensity. CN–Br (1:30) has the highest photocurrent density of 0.47 μA cm−2, which is approximately 7.6 times higher than that of bulk CN. The high photocurrent density suggests the enhanced mobility of charge carriers and charge transport efficiency.45 The EIS experimental results shown in Fig. 3i reveal that the CN–Br samples exhibit a smaller semicircle radius than bulk CN, suggesting the faster interfacial charge transfer and higher charge separation efficiency in CN–Br in comparison with those in bulk CN.54 It can be seen that the arc radii of the Nyquist plots for all CN–Br samples are smaller than that of bulk CN. With the increase ratio of x value in CN–Br (1:x), the arc radius first diminishes and then rises up. CN–Br (1:30) presents the smallest semicircle radius among the samples, which means that it has the most efficient interfacial charge transfer, which agrees well with the photocurrent and PL results.
On the basis of the above discussion, it is reasonable to conclude that the introduced carbon defects break the heptazine units and thus offer more aromatic edges and NHx groups in the CN–Br samples, which could facilitate the formation of unpaired electrons and benefit the photoinduced generation of charge carriers for photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S15a†). In addition, the porous structure of the CN–Br samples endows them with larger surface areas, which will provide more reaction active sites and more cross-plane diffusion channels for reactants. This will also benefit the photocatalytic activity. The contribution of carbon defects and surface area enlargement to the improvement of catalytic activity is illustrated clearly in Fig. S15b.†
Conclusions
In summary, we report here a facile and safe method to construct carbon-defect modified g-C3N4 with abundant in-plane holes. This method involves programmed heating of precursors in the presence of NH4Br. The released NH3 during the decomposition process of NH4Br not only etches CN with abundant in-plane holes, producing a high specific surface area, but also produces carbon vacancy defects. This porous CN–Br exhibits a 5-fold higher hydrogen evolution catalytic activity and nearly 12 times rhodamine B (RhB) degradation catalytic activity. The excellent photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the enlarged surface area and the introduced carbon vacancy defects. The larger surface area provides more interfacial contact with reactants and more reaction active sites. The carbon vacancy defects endow the samples with enhanced visible light absorption, a high concentration of photogenerated electrons in the CB, and a more negatively shifted CB position. The present work presents not only a facile and safe method to create carbon-defect modified g-C3N4 with abundant in-plane holes, but also systematically reveals the role of carbon vacancy defects in improving the catalytic activity of g-C3N4. This information will be useful in the design of new g-C3N4 based photocatalysts.
