According to theoretical first-principles calculations, the formation enthalpy of CuTaN2 is negative (−0.66 eV per atom), but this material is metastable with respect to decomposition into Cu, Ta3N5 and N2. Nevertheless, the experimental thermal stability limit of single phase CuTaN2 powders synthesized using an ion exchange method is 250 °C in ambient atmosphere, according to combined temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and thermo-gravimetric analyses. Electronic structure of the CuTaN2 is different compared to that of CuAlO2, in particular the band gap of this nitride delafossite (1.3 eV) calculated using HSE06+G0W0 is much smaller than the band gap of the oxide delafossite. The onset of optical absorption onset of CuTaN2 at 1.5 eV determined from experimental diffuse reflectance measurements is consistent with the theoretical 1.4 eV optical band gap and large calculated absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1 above 1.5 eV) determined from time-dependent HSE06 calculations corrected by a scissors operator. The significance of our findings is that optical properties of CuTaN2 are nearly optimal for photovoltaic energy conversion.1 IntroductionNext-generation solar energy conversion is a vibrant field of energy research that explores unconventional materials for photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical applications.1,2 The novel materials may have additional benefits compared to conventional group-IV, III–V or II–IV semiconductors, for example earth-abundance, chemical stability under operating conditions, large-scale low-temperature manufacturing. Historically, a lot of attention in the field has been devoted to oxide absorbers, in particular Cu2O3 and other oxides4 for solar cells, and Fe2O3 and TiO2 (ref. 5) for solar fuels. More recently, the focus of the research started to shift towards nitrogen-containing absorbers, including (In,Ga)N nitride alloys for photovoltaics,6 and (Zn,Ga)(O,N) oxynitrides7 for photoelectrochemistry. These nitrogen-containing materials are thought to have more efficient light absorption and charge carrier transport properties than oxides, the two features that are critical for generation of both solar energy and solar fuels.8,9 For the solar fuels applications, nitrides and oxynitrides offer an additional benefit compared to oxides due to higher energy of the positive charges that can more effectively drive the conversion of sunlight into solar fuels.Ternary nitrides represent an exciting field of materials, which is relatively little explored compared to binary nitrides or ternary oxides.10–13 Of particular interest are ternary copper nitrides, only five of which have been reported in the literature. Similar to other nitrides, the few known ternary copper nitrides feature very diverse crystal structures, including CuTaN2 with the delafossite structure,14 Mn3CuN with an anti-perovskite structure15 and a AECuN (AE = Ca, Sr and Ba) family16 and related Cu3Sr6N5 (ref. 17) with various structures that contain straight and kinked Cu–N–Cu chains. Besides their crystal structure, nearly nothing else is known about the basic properties of these copper containing nitride materials. Nevertheless, band structure, optical and other properties of these materials are of great potential interest because of the peculiar energy matched yet unstable character of copper–nitrogen bonds. Other noble metal nitrides very often show unusual and technologically interesting properties, for example very large bulk modulus in platinum containing nitrides.18,19Here, we show that one ternary copper nitride CuTaN2 has optical properties that are very promising for solar cell applications. In agreement with theoretical calculations, this material has an experimentally measured steep optical absorption onset at 1.5 eV, close to the optimal for a photovoltaic absorber. Interestingly, despite the fact that this material is calculated to be metastable, it does not decompose in ambient atmosphere below 250 °C, indicating the potential for long-term stability under photovoltaic operating conditions. The results presented here indicate that ternary copper nitrides may have considerable potential as absorbers in earth abundant solar cells.2 Methods2.1 SynthesisApproximately 1 g of Ta2O5 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was placed in an alumina boat and heated in an 1 inch silica tube with air-tight stainless steel end caps under ammonia (Anhydrous, Airgas) at 800 °C for 8 h to prepare Ta3N5. NaTaN2 was then prepared by mixing 0.5 g of Ta3N5 and 0.19 g of Na metal (99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich) in an alumina boat. The mixture was placed in a stainless steel tube with air-tight stainless steel end caps and heated under flowing ammonia at 350 °C for 2 h before raising the temperature to 500 °C for 24 h to produce single phase NaTaN2. NaTaN2 was then combined with 5 times molar excess of CuI (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) in an argon filled glove box with an O2 level below 0.1 ppm. The mixture was ground using a mortar and pestle, then pelletized in the glovebox before heating in an air-tight steel tube in a flow-through furnace. The mixture was heated at 400 °C for 48 h under nitrogen gas (High Purity Grade, Airgas). The resulting product was then washed twice with 14.5 M ammonium hydroxide and dried in a desiccator. All gases were purified to remove trace amounts of oxygen or water using pellet copper, nickel, palladium and platinum powders dispersed on porous zeolites as a support. Argon gas was passed over the sample for 15 min to expel air before establishing a flow of different gases. The sample was heated to the above reaction temperatures at 150 °C h−1. After treatment for the specified period, the furnace power was turned off and the product cooled to room temperature in ∼4 h under the gas flow. Before the silica tube was taken out of the split tube furnace, argon gas was flowed through the silica tube to expel the ammonia gas.2.2 CharacterizationThe purities of the products at each stage were confirmed by powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD). Finely ground powders were examined with a Rigaku Ultima VI powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Kα1, λ = 1.5406 Å and Kα2, λ = 1.5444 Å). Crystal structures of the oxides and resultant nitrides were confirmed by PXRD profiles using the GSAS package.20 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) were performed with a LEO-1550 field emission SEM (FSEM). Optical properties of CuTaN2 powders were evaluated using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy method using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer in parallel beam configuration. CuTaN2 powder was placed in an integrating sphere with compacted BaSO4 powder as reference and the diffuse reflectance spectra were collected using UV Probe software in the spectral range of 350–2500 nm. Absorption spectra α were determined from diffuse reflectance spectra R using Kubelka–Munk method as α ∼ k/s = (1 − R)2/(2R). The optical band gap was estimated from extrapolating a linear portion of the (1 − R)2/(2R) line to k/s = 0. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Mettler-Toledo TGA instrument on the 30 mg of CuTaN2. Temperature-dependent XRD study was performed in Cu Kα radiation on a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with a hot stage. The CuTaN2 sample was mounted to the stage using Ag paste and the surface temperature was monitored using a thermocouple. Both TGA and temperature-dependent XRD were performed at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air.2.3 Thermodynamic stability calculationsThe thermodynamic stability of CuTaN2 is evaluated using the formation enthalpies (ΔHf's) of CuTaN2 and its competing phases from first-principles calculations, which are corrected by the fitted elemental-phase reference energies.21–24 We employ the GGA+U Hamiltonian with U = 5 eV for Cu 3d states and U = 3 eV for Ta 5d states. We calculate the ΔHf's of CuTaN2 in a set of structure types of 1:1:2 stoichiometry in the Inorganic Chemistry Structural Database (ICSD),25 and identify the lowest-enthalpy structure. The ΔHf's of competing phases are evaluated in the reported crystal structures in ICSD, which are used together with the ΔHf of CuTaN2 to construct the ground state surface connecting lowest-energy structures (ΔHfvs. compositions or so called “convex hull”). The reaction enthalpies for the potential decomposition of CuTaN2 into its competing phases as well as oxidation reaction in air are evaluated based on the convex hull and the large entropy of gas phases (e.g. N2) estimated using the ideal gas law. The entropies of solids are not included because of their cancellation and their small magnitudes compared to gases.2.4 Electronic structure calculationsBecause of the localized character of Cu 3d states, a higher-accuracy methods, such as screened hybrid functional method (HSE06), or HSE06 together with perturbative many-body Green function (GW) method (HSE06+G0W0), were necessary to describe correctly the electronic band structure of CuTaN2. Not only such methods have proven themselves to be particularly successful for transition metal compounds,26 but they also successfully captured crucial many body effects at both valence band maximum and conduction band minimum (CBM).27,28 Specifically, the position of the CBM was found to be particularly sensitive to many body effects and could not be described satisfactorily within the commonly used density functional theory (DFT) or DFT+U techniques.For the CuTaN2 band structure calculations using HSE06+G0W0, the GGA+U-relaxed lowest energy rhombohedral crystal structure with 4-atom primitive cell was converted into a 12-atom hexagonal supercell. Such a change results in band folding into higher-symmetry k-points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, such as Γ (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), M (0.5, 0.0, 0.0), A (0.0, 0.0, 0.5) and L (0.5, 0.0, 0.5), but it conserves the atomic character of the electronic states and the strength of the dipole matrix elements used for calculation of absorption coefficient. A 16 × 16 × 4 k-point mesh and bands with energy up to 190 eV above the Fermi level were used for constructing the screened interaction W and the Green function G. As a result of these calculations, G0W0 perturbations were found to have minimal influence on the HSE06 electronic band structure. Therefore, the subsequent calculation of the optical absorption spectrum was performed using HSE06 wave functions and the HSE06 energies corrected by a scissors operator. The response function and the frequency dependent absorption coefficient were calculated within the time-dependent HSE06.29 For the absorption spectrum calculations, we used a denser 18 × 18 × 6 k-point mesh and adjusted the mixing parameter to 1/ε∞. The resulting anisotropic absorption spectrum was averaged over the three Cartesian directions in order to model the isotropic absorption spectrum of the polycrystalline samples studied experimentally.3 Results and discussion3.1 Composition and crystal structureCuTaN2 was synthesized by an ion exchange reaction between CuI and polycrystalline powders of NaTaN2 as previously reported.14 During reaction with CuI, the Cu intercalates into the layers and the Na deintercalates to form NaI, which is easily washed away after the synthesis is completed. The NaTaN2 and CuTaN2 powders are yellow and dark-brown in color, respectively. The particle sizes of the CuTaN2 grains vary from 50 to 300 nm in diameter as shown by SEM images in Fig. S1,† which is a typical size for reasonable reaction rates in ion exchange synthesis.30 Based on the results of EDX analysis, the Cu:Ta ratio of the CuTaN2 powder sample was 1:1 within the overall expected errors of ±10%. No Na was detected in the product by EDX. The crystal phase purity of both NaTaN2 and CuTaN2 was confirmed by Rietveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as shown in Fig. 1. The structures of NaTaN2 and CuTaN2 are both layered and crystallize in the Rm space group, as previously reported;14,31 however, NaTaN2 and CuTaN2 do not adopt the same structure type. As derived from the atomic positions in Table S1,† Na in NaTaN2 is octahedrally coordinated by six N atoms, while Cu in CuTaN2 is linearly coordinated by two N atoms. The refined experimental lattice parameters for these two compounds of are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1  Rietveld refinement and crystal structure (insets) of (a) NaTaN2 and (b) CuTaN2.

The theoretical 12-atom hexagonal lattice parameters that correspond to the 4-atom rhombohedral primitive cells of CuTaN2 (a = 3.192 Å, c = 17.462 Å) and NaTaN2 (a = 3.168 Å, c = 17.148 Å) are slightly (∼1.5%) overestimated compared to experimental values (Table 1), which is quite typical for the employed GGA+U DFT calculation methods. These calculations also demonstrate that 2 other similar structure prototypes (hexagonal AgFeO2-type and NaNiO2-type) have the same energy within the accuracy of the method. The NaTaN2-type precursor structure of the CuTaN2 has a rather high energy (0.21 eV per atom) relative to the 3 lowest energy delafossite related structures. Formation enthalpies ΔHf of CuTaN2 in the 10 lowest-energy crystal structures calculated using DFT+U are shown in Table S2.†3.2 Thermodynamic and kinetic stabilityAccording to theoretical calculations, CuTaN2 has negative formation enthalpy (does not disproportionate into elemental components), but it is metastable with respect to phase separation into Ta3N5, Cu and N2 gas. The convex hull (calculated ground state surface connecting lowest-energy structures) of the Cu–Ta–N ternary space is shown in Fig. 2. The Cu3N, Ta4N5, Ta5N6, compounds reported in literature are above the convex hull, and thus they are thermodynamically unstable and are not show in Fig. 2. The CuTaN2 compound discussed in this paper is also a metastable material, and its location on the Cu–Ta–N diagram is shown in Fig. 2 for illustrative purposes. Specifically, CuTaN2 has 0.112 eV per atom higher energy than the combination of the convex hull compound Ta3N5 and standard elemental phases N2 and Cu at ambient conditions. The decomposition reaction is: (1) Fig. 2  Ground state surface connecting lowest-energy structures (convex hull) of Cu–Ta–N. However, under realistic solar cell operating conditions CuTaN2 absorbers are more likely to undergo an oxidation or hydrolysis reaction rather than a decomposition reaction. Therefore, we studied oxidation process of this material in air. Taking into account the fact that N–O gases have large positive ΔHf, the most likely oxidation reaction in air is: (2)The enthalpy of this reaction (eqn (2)) depends on the chemical potentials of oxygen (ΔμO) and nitrogen (ΔμN) and is 1.2174 + 0.4667ΔμO − 0.2667ΔμN eV per atom. We note that in the air, ΔμO ≈ ΔμN since 0.2 atm (or 0.8 atm) and 1 atm partial pressure gives almost the same Δμ.32 It means that the enthalpy of this oxidation reaction (eqn (2)) will become positive only when ΔμO is extremely small (∼−6 eV), which corresponds to very low pO2 (<10−40) at the 400 °C synthesis temperature, or very high temperature (>3000 °C) in air. Since neither of these conditions are met during sample synthesis in nitrogen or sample storage in air, CuTaN2 is only kinetically but not thermodynamically stable.CuTaN2 powder is stable in air up to 250 °C, as indicated by combined temperature-dependent TGA and XRD studies (Fig. 3). According to the XRD results, crystalline CuTaN2 was observed up to 400 °C. However, the presence of a crystalline second phase is suggested by the appearance of an extra diffraction peak at ∼36 degrees at 250 °C perhaps due to the formation of CuO, in agreement with onset of weight increase at this temperature. This extra peak persisted until 420 °C, above which (and up to 550 °C) the peak at ∼36 degrees disappeared. There was no crystalline phase observed between 450 °C and 550 °C, indicating that the oxidation products lack long-range atomic order in this temperature interval. Overall, the weight increase of the CuTaN2 sample upon heating in air from 25 to 550 °C is consistent with a 10.3 wt% calculated mass change expected from the oxidation of the nitride to CuO and Ta2O5. The main implication of these results is that despite its metastable character, CuTaN2 does not decompose in air below 250 °C and thus it is a relatively stable material that might be used in practical applications such as solar cells.

The electronic wave functions that correspond to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of CuTaN2 band structure are shown in Fig. S2.† In order to gain better insight into the electronic structure of nitride delafossite CuTaN2, we compared it to the band structure of the related oxide delafossite CuAlO2.33 Interestingly, the atomic characters of the lowest valence and conduction bands of CuTaN2 and CuAlO2 are similar, but the extreme of these bands are located in different positions. Fig. 4  Band structure of CuTaN2 with 12-atom hexagonal cell calculated using HSE06+G0W0 method. The red circles indicate the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum. The valence band maximum (VBM) of CuTaN2 lies at A-point of the hexagonal Brillouin zone and is formed by a strong contribution from N p states and a significant admixture of Cu 3d states with t2g symmetry (Fig. S2a†). The pronounced Cu 3d character of the valence band maximum is also observed in the case of CuAlO2 together with the change of character of the VB across the Brillouin zone. However, the position of the valence band maximum at A for CuTaN2 is different than the position of the valence band maximum of CuAlO2, which according to different reports is in the vicinity of the K point,34 at the L point35 or near the F point.27 The similar atomic character of the valence band of the two materials is likely to lead to similar defect and electrical properties. Thus, CuTaN2 can be expected to have p-type conductivity caused by copper vacancies and band-like conduction through holes with somewhat anisotropic mobility, similar to these properties in CuAlO2.36,37The conduction band minimum (CBM) of CuTaN2 occurs at L point of the Brillouin zone, giving rise to a 1.3 eV indirect band gap. The lowest conduction band of CuTaN2 has predominantly a Ta 5d character, but with significant contribution from N p orbitals (Fig. S2b†). The lowest direct band gap of 1.4 eV is between a valence band formed by N pz orbitals mixed with Cu 3d states with eg symmetry oriented along Cu–N bond, and a conduction band formed of mixed N pz orbitals with Ta d orbitals. Most of the higher energy conduction bands of CuTaN2 are dominated by Ta 5d states as expected from octet rule, if one assumes Cu to be in 1+ oxidation state and Ta to be in 5+ oxidation state. In contrast with CuAlO2, there is an almost null contribution of Cu 3d states to the conduction band,27,28 indicating that the chemical bonding in CuTaN2 is slightly differently than in CuAlO2. Indeed, in addition to the absence of Cu d states in the conduction band, one finds a significant character of Cu s states in the valence band, implying that the charge transfer between Cu and the Ta–N layer is not fully complete.3.4 Optical propertiesThe experimental optical absorption spectrum of CuTaN2 derived from diffuse reflectance measurements shows a quite steep onset (Fig. 5a). The linear portion of the absorption spectrum extrapolates to 1.5 eV, which is estimated to be the optical band gap of CuTaN2. No inference can be made about direct vs. indirect character of the CuTaN2 bandgap from the slope of experimental absorption spectrum due to expected strong excitonic effects in this delafossite material.38 These experimental optical absorption results are in good agreement with the theoretical value of the 1.4 eV direct band gap calculated within HSE06+G0W0 (Fig. 4), and with the theoretical optical absorption spectrum calculated using TD-HSE06 with a scissors operator (Fig. 5b). According to the optical absorption calculation results (Fig. 5b), CuTaN2 has very steep optical absorption onset (absorption reaches 105 cm−1 just 0.1 eV above the 1.4 eV direct band gap) and a very high optical absorption saturation value (absorption reaches 2 × 105 cm−1 at 2 eV). The apparent noise in the calculated optical absorption spectrum (Fig. 5b) is explained by (i) the difficulty of sampling of the Brillouin zone due to strong anisotropy of the CuTaN2 band structure, and (ii) the choice of a small smearing in order to clearly identify the absorption onset. Fig. 5  Optical absorption spectra of CuTaN2 obtained from (a) diffuse reflectance measurements and (b) TD-HSE06 calculations based on HSE06+scissor operator energies and HSE06 wavefunctions. Dashed black lines are the fits to the energy range where absorption increases steeply. Both the steep onset of absorption and the high absorption coefficient are key properties for absorber layers in thin film photovoltaics. The experimental 1.5 eV optical absorption onset of CuTaN2 powder (Fig. 5a), the theoretical 1.3 eV indirect band gap (Fig. 4), and the theoretical 1.4 eV direct band gap (Fig. 4) are all very close to 1.4 eV optimal value for a solar cell absorber, according to the Shockley Queisser efficiency model.9 The calculated high absorption coefficient of 105–106 cm−1 (Fig. 5b) is approximately an order of magnitude higher compared to current thin film absorbers based on CIGS (typically ∼2 μm thickness) or CdTe (typically ∼6 μm thickness).39 This suggests that at least in principle significantly thinner absorber layers could be used in CuTaN2 solar cells, so development of CuTaN2 thin films is warranted.4 ConclusionsThe ternary copper nitride CuTaN2 with layered delafossite crystal structure was synthesized by using the ion exchange method. The experimentally measured optical absorption onset of CuTaN2 is at 1.5 eV, in good agreement with 1.3 eV indirect gap and 1.4 eV direct gap determined from first-principles theoretical calculations. Powders of CuTaN2 have steep optical absorption onset, and theoretical studies show high values of absorption coefficient in 105–106 cm−1 range. CuTaN2 powders are stable in air up to 250 °C despite the theoretically calculated metastable character of this ternary copper nitride compound. Overall, the results of this study indicate that CuTaN2 is an interesting candidate for thin film photovoltaics and suggest that other copper metal nitrides may also have promising properties for solar cell absorber applications.AcknowledgementsThis research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, as a part of the “Ternary Copper Nitride Absorbers” Next Generation PV II project within the SunShot initiative.
