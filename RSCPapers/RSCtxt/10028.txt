ChinaReceived 13th July 2013, Accepted 19th September 2013First published on 19th September 2013AbstractAdvanced thermoelectric technology offers the potential to convert waste heat into useful electricity, and a mechanism of transmission-free methods for solid state cooling. A low thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for obtaining high efficiency thermoelectric materials. It is a challenge to achieve low thermal conductivity without simultaneously destroying the electric conductivity, for which a ‘phonon glass/liquid–electron crystal’ is proposed. To realize the phonon glass–electron crystal, a host–guest cage crystal system is considered, while to realize the phonon liquid–electron crystal, superionic conductivity is needed. Here we report a novel material, a KCu7−xS4 nanowire, which exhibits enhanced thermoelectric properties compared to the traditional chalcogenide Cu7S4 nanostructure. The presence of K ions not only forms a clathrate and a superionic fluid structure, which provides the phonon glass and liquid–electron crystal, but also adjusts the product to give a nanowire-like morphology. A low thermal conductivity and large Seebeck coefficient can be achieved when the nanowires are pressed into a bulk material. Higher electrical conductivity is also obtained below 420 K. In addition, the numerous grain boundaries, Cu deficiency and the orientated nanowires further increase the thermoelectric properties. The results indicate a new strategy to obtain high efficiency thermoelectric materials by introducing kalium into copper chalcogenides to form a new crystal structure with ‘phonon glass and liquid–electron crystal’ properties.1. IntroductionIn recent years, growing environmental concerns and ever increasing energy demands have been a driving force for the development of new, sustainable sources of energy. Much effort has been made in the research of solar cells,1,2 novel fuel cells,3 water splitting for hydrogen production,4,5 nanogenerators to collect energy from surrounding mechanical vibrations,6 as well as thermoelectricity.7–9 Thermoelectric (TE) materials can be used to convert heat to electricity through the Seebeck effect, and can harvest waste heat recycled from transportation, power plants, oil refineries and solar energy. Although worldwide efforts to find materials with a high thermoelectric figure of merit are most often focused on crystalline semiconductors with low thermal conductivity, such materials are of a limited number, and most of them are chalcogenides and related compounds. Therefore, the exploration of an optimum crystalline structured material with low thermal conductivity and high electric conductivity is a challenging and urgent topic.TE conversion efficiency is governed by the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT = S2T/ρκ, where S, T, ρ and κ are the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient), absolute temperature, electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity, respectively. Ideal thermoelectric materials should possess low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, so a crystalline semiconductor structure is desirable for the electronic transportation (electron-crystal), but a disordered atomic arrangement is desirable to give low lattice thermal conductivity (phonon-glass). There are two ways to reduce the thermal conductivity: by reducing phonon heat exchange, and heat transport of charge carriers. Usually, reducing the heat transport of charge carriers destroys the electric conductivity, and thus reducing the phonon heat exchange would be a good option to obtain low thermal conductivity with high carrier transportation. The phonon heat exchange is related to the crystal lattice structure. Prominent examples of thermoelectric materials with open host framework structures containing loosely bonded guest entities are skutterudites10 and clathrates,11,12 which enable simultaneously a large charge carrier conductivity similar to crystalline structures and a low thermal conductivity similar to a glass, recognized as the phonon glass–electron crystal concept.Recently, the investigation of β-Cu2−xSe has indicated a new strategy to realize high efficiency thermoelectric properties, where there exists a crystalline sub-lattice for electronic conduction surrounded by liquid-like ions.13 The crystal structure of a ‘liquid-like’ charged fluid of Cu ions inhibits the propagation of transverse waves and disrupts heat propagation by phonons, but does not affect its superionic conduction, and is proposed as the phonon liquid–electron crystal.On the other hand, many studies have reported that compacting nanoparticles into dense products can achieve low thermal conductivity due to the enhanced scattering of phonons at their numerous grain boundaries, and at the same time products with high density after compaction could also show increased thermopower.14–16 Furthermore, previous research has found that the novel quarternary chalcogenide Cu2CdSnSe4 (ref. 17), and other chalcogenides such as Cu2ZnSnSe4 (ref. 18) and Cu2SnSe3,19 have reasonable thermoelectric properties at mid-range temperatures when doped with Cu. These materials show a drastic reduction of ρ due to the creation of p-type Cu ion carriers; however, the vacancies in the compact material would further increase the carrier concentration.8Here we report a novel material, a KCu7−xS4 nanowire, in which the clathrate structure and crystalline sub-lattice are achieved, displaying low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity simultaneously. By comparing samples of KCu7−xS4 and Cu7S4, we determine the effect of the introduction of K ions into the crystalline structure on its thermoelectric properties, and a new class of K–copper chalcogenide nanowires is proposed to achieve high efficiency TE properties.2. ExperimentalMass produced KCu7−xS4 nanowires have been obtained by a modified composite hydroxide mediated (M-CHM) approach in the absence of any organic surfactant.20 In a typical experiment, (1) 10 g of mixed hydroxides (NaOH:KOH = 51.5:48.5), 0.198 g of CuCl and 0.24 g of NaS·9H2O were placed in a 25 mL Teflon vessel, and 1.6 mL of water was added into the vessel. (2) The vessel in an autoclave was then put into a furnace preheated to 200 °C. (3) After 24 h in the furnace, the autoclave was then taken out and allowed to cool to room temperature. The clean KCu7−xS4 nanocrystals were obtained by washing the products several times with deionized water and then drying at 60 °C. Analogous experiments were performed using only 10 g of NaOH and 1.6 mL of water as the reaction medium to obtain Cu7S4 nanowires. The resulting products were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD: BDX3200) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN, VEGA2). Detailed analysis of the morphology and structure of the KCu7−xS4 nanowires was performed using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI20, Philips) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to investigate the chemical composition of the samples.In order to investigate the TE properties of the as-synthesized samples, a block of the KCu7−xS4/Cu7S4 nanowires was prepared by casting the dispersed nanowires (in ethanol solution) onto a dielectric substrate layer by layer after being dried naturally, which were then pressed under 15 MPa pressure at room temperature using a press moulding machine for 30 min to make the samples more dense and even. A small rectangular block with a size of 4 mm × 4 mm × 1 mm was cut, keeping the plane perpendicular to the pressed plane in each pressed sample for measuring the thermal conductivity (κ) with a laser flash apparatus (NETZSCH, LFA 457). Films were prepared by the same method to measure the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of the product. The dimensions of the films were 15 mm length, 8 mm width, and 0.08 mm thickness, where the thickness was determined by scanning the cross-section of the film with SEM. The measurements of electrical conductivity and the thermal electromotive force of the films were performed with a FLUKE 45. The two ends of the films were placed on two blocks with a temperature difference of 1–2 °C, and the temperatures of the two ends were measured by thermocouples on the film surface. The Seebeck coefficient (S) was evaluated by the slope of the linear relationship between the thermal electromotive force and the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends of the film. Carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity of the KCu7−xS4 and Cu7S4 films were measured at room temperature using a Hall Effect Measurement System (HMS-3000).3. Results and discussionFig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized by the conditions with and without KOH. The sample without K ions can be indexed as monoclinic Cu7S4 (JCPDS no. 23-0958). The sample synthesized with mixed hydroxides is identified as the body centered tetragonal KCu7−xS4 crystal (JCPDS no. 83-0357) according to our previous report, which is non-stoichiometric with x ≈ 0.2, as revealed by elemental analysis results.20Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the as-synthesized samples and the thicknesses of the films made from the samples. The morphology of Cu7S4 is irregular particles mixed with wires (Fig. 2a). The thickness of the Cu7S4 film is about 80 μm (Fig. 2b), and EDS (inset of Fig. 2b) shows the elemental composition is Cu and S. Fig. 2c shows that the KCu7−xS4 sample has wire-like morphology with a diameter of 200–500 nm. The thickness of the KCu7−xS4 film is also about 80 μm (Fig. 2b), as we used the same amount of sample in the preparation of the film. The EDS results (inset of Fig. 2d) show the elemental composition of the KCu7−xS4 wires is K, Cu and S. The TEM image in Fig. 2e and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction in Fig. 2f indicate that the KCu7−xS4 nanowires grow along the [001] direction.

The TE properties of the two samples in the temperature range of 323–573 K are shown in Fig. 3. Both Cu7S4 and KCu7−xS4 films display very low κ values (less than 0.5 W mK−1), and the KCu7−xS4 film presents a lower κ value than that of Cu7S4 film, as shown in Fig. 3a. It is worth noting that the κ values here are much lower than those of previously reported chalcogenides,8,13 although the κ value increases with increasing temperature. The Seebeck coefficient S, measured versus the temperature difference, is shown in Fig. 3b, demonstrating that the S of the uniform KCu7−xS4 nanowire film is much larger than that of the Cu7S4 mixed structure film. S increases with the increasing temperature, and the maximum values of the KCu7−xS4 and Cu7S4 films are 192 and 125 μV K−1 at 573 K, respectively. The abrupt increase in κ and S from 440 K reveals a phase transition of the two samples, which is a common phenomenon in copper chalcogenides.9,13,20–22 Fig. 3  Temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (a), Seebeck coefficient (b), electric resistivity (c) and the figure-of-merit (d) of the KCu7−xS4 and Cu7S4 films. DSC of the samples is shown in the ESI, Fig. S1a and S1b.† The endothermic peaks, centered at 440 K and 435 K respectively, indicate there is an endothermic structural phase transition in these samples. Carrier concentration (n), mobility (μ) and resistivity (ρ) for the samples at room temperature are listed in Table 1. We can see that the carrier concentration of the KCu7−xS4 film is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Cu7S4 film, while the mobility of the KCu7−xS4 film is one order of magnitude lower than that of the Cu7S4 film. The resistivity (2.901 × 10−3 Ω cm) of the KCu7−xS4 film at room temperature is one order of magnitude lower than that (9.191 × 10−2 Ω cm) of the Cu7S4 film, which shows little difference compared with the circuit measurements of 6.83 × 10−3 Ω cm for the KCu7−xS4 film, and 2.16 × 10−2 Ω cm for the Cu7S4 film at 323 K (a little above room temperature), as shown in Fig. 3c. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity of the two films (Fig. 3c) also demonstrates the structural phase transition. The resistivity of the KCu7−xS4 film increases quickly between 440 K to 480 K, and drops quickly above 480 K. Commonly, the change in resistivity caused by a structural phase transition for a single-crystalline K–Cu–S composition depends strongly on the copper content. Stoichiometric KCu7S4 exhibits semiconducting behavior around room temperature, when all the energy bands are filled. With decreasing copper content the sulfur is oxidized, creating holes in the sulfur 3p band; thus non-stoichiometric KCu7−xS4 exhibits metallic behavior and a metal-to-semimetal transition with increasing temperature.20,22–24 In copper chalcogenides Cu2−xX (X = S, Se or Te), in spite of the obvious change in thermal conductivity κ with the phase transition, there is little difference in resistivity.10 Analogously, although an obvious change of κ can be observed for both the KCu7−xS4 and Cu7S4 samples with increasing temperature, the sharp change in resistivity only occurs in the KCu7−xS4 film due to its metal-to-semimetal transition.

Samplen (1020 cm−3)μ (cm2 V−1 s−1)ρ (10−3 Ω cm)KCu7−xS496.970.22192.901Cu7S40.30515.46291.91According to the above measured data, we calculated the temperature dependence of ZT values, as shown in Fig. 3d. As the present results are obtained from a film prepared by cold pressing and measured over a small temperature range (from 323 K to 573 K), the improvement of ZT is limited. It can be deduced that the ZT value could be improved if a hot pressing method was adopted and measurements were carried out in a higher temperature range, as the ZT values of our samples continued to increase with increasing temperature above 530 K. Although the ZT value of KCu7−xS4 is slightly lower than that of Cu7S4 between 430 K and 530 K due to the much larger electronic resistivity in this temperature region, it is worth noting that the ZT value of KCu7−xS4 is much higher than that of Cu7S4 when the temperature is below 430 K and above 550 K.To look into the causes of the higher thermoelectric properties of the KCu7−xS4 nanowires, the crystal structures of KCu7−xS4 are given in Fig. 4. The crystal structure of KCu7−xS4 is very similar to that of the β-Cu2−xSe, which presents a ‘liquid-like’ charged fluid of Cu ions as suggested by Liu et al.,10 and is shown in Fig. 4a. The S and K atoms in KCu7−xS4 form a lattice, providing a crystalline pathway for conducting electrons (or more precisely holes), while the copper ions are highly disordered around the S and K sub-lattice, and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. The projected plane representation of the crystal structure along the [001] direction indicates that Cu ions can travel freely among the interstitial sites (Fig. 4b). This extraordinary ‘liquid-like’ behavior of the copper ions around a crystalline sub-lattice results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity. It is obvious in our experiment that the TE properties have been enhanced in the KCu7−xS4 crystalline structure. The thermal conductivity of the KCu7−xS4 film is lower than that of the reported Cu2−xSe.10 The crystal cell of KCu7−xS4 is given in Fig. 4c. We find that the crystal structure is a clathrate unit cell. From previous density functional calculations,12,13 it is known that clathrates can be good thermoelectric materials if they satisfy several conditions: (1) if the guest atoms are loosely bound to the walls of the cage, they will rattle and provide the phonon scattering needed to lower the thermal conductivity; (2) if electron conductivity takes place mostly through the frame atoms, the rattling of the guest is unlikely to affect the electrical conductivity. For the KCu7−xS4 crystalline structure (Fig. 4c), conditions (1) and (2) are met, as the guest (K) atoms, trapped inside the clathrate cages, scatter phonons efficiently and lead to low thermal conductivity. Electric conductivity takes place mostly through the clathrate frame and the conduction carriers (Cu ions) are not scattered by K vibrations.12,13 There is very little charge transfer between the K atoms and the frame (S), and as a result, K vibrations are weakly coupled to the conduction carriers. The Seebeck coefficient is strongly affected by the positions of Cu atoms in the frame. This finding is in agreement with reported inorganic clathrate thermoelectric materials.12,13 Consequently, besides the superionic conduction along the [001] direction (a ‘liquid-like’ charged fluid of Cu ions) and the ‘liquid’ inhibition of the propagation of transverse waves to disrupt heat propagation by phonons, the clathrate structure of KCu7−xS4 further lowers the thermal conductivity and does not affect its superionic conduction. In addition, the non-stoichiometry of KCu7−xS4 is due to the stacking faults in the copper-deficient phase.20,22 Cu ions travel much more easily between the Cu vacancies, as shown in Fig. 4b, where the Cu deficiency in KCu7−xS4 results in an equivalent concentration of holes, which increases the electric conductivity.8 From Table 1, the non-stoichiometric KCu7−xS4 has a much higher carrier concentration than Cu7S4, and the mobility is much lower than in Cu7S4. Commonly, a higher carrier concentration results in a lower Seebeck coefficient. However, the lower mobility of the KCu7−xS4 film would reduce the heat transport of charge carriers, and thus prevent the decrease in Seebeck coefficient to some extent. The lower phonon heat exchange from the advantages of the crystal lattice structure of KCu7−xS4 and the lower mobility of the charge carriers results in a decrease of thermal conductivity and ensures a relatively higher Seebeck coefficient. Fig. 4  Crystal structure (a), projected plane representation of the crystal structure along the [001] direction (b), and the unit cell (c) of KCu7−xS4. On the other hand, the morphology of the as-synthesized samples also affects the TE properties. Theoretical calculations and laboratory findings over the past few years suggest that a size effect in nanostructures such as quantum wells, nanowires and quantum dots, significantly increases the efficiency and figure of merit of TE materials.7,8 Although the dense bulk of the ternary KCu7−xS4 nanocrystals could benefit from increased grain boundaries to reduce the thermal conductivity, such grain boundaries might also reduce the electrical conductivity. To understand this effect, the detailed morphologies of the films were characterized and are shown in Fig. 5. Both of the pressed KCu7−xS4 and Cu7S4 films are rather compact (Fig. 5a and b), and the layered structure formed by the high pressure pressing can be observed in the cross-section (Fig. 5c and d). Though the grain boundaries of the Cu7S4 film appear irregular in Fig. 5a, we still can determine the mixture of wire and particle structures from the enlarged image in the inset of Fig. 5a. The nanowire structure can be clearly seen in the pressed KCu7−xS4 film from the broken shallow surface in Fig. 5b. A better layered structure is formed in the pressed KCu7−xS4 film than in the pressed Cu7S4 film. The nanowires orientated along the film plane may be attributed to the fact that the nanowires are fairly uniformly distributed on the substrate surface, with their lateral orientation randomised by the dispersion of a droplet of the suspended nanowire solution onto the substrate in a layer by layer fashion during film preparation before pressing, as shown in Fig. 5e. According to Fig. 4b, the KCu7−xS4 nanowires grown along the c-axis and orientated along the film plane facilitate fast charge carrier transmission along the a–c plane, and efficient phonon scattering between the interfaces of the nanowires, which allows the enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient with a small drop in the electrical conductivity.25 Fig. 5  SEM images of the surface of the thin films made of the Cu7S4 nanostructure (a) and the KCu7−xS4 nanowires (b), and the enlarged image of the Cu7S4 nanostructured film (inset of a). Cross-sectional images of the Cu7S4 nanostructured film (c) and the KCu7−xS4 nanowire film (d). A schematic diagram showing the formation of the layered structure of the KCu7−xS4 nanowire film during film preparation (e). Based on the discussions above, a new class of K–copper chalcogenide nanowires with advanced TE properties can be achieved by introducing kalium into copper chalcogenides to form a clathrate in a sub-lattice structure with ‘phonon glass and liquid–electron crystal’ characteristics. These compounds are very interesting because a large number of derivatives might be created by the synthesis of similar compounds with various guests, such as LiCux−δSey, NaCux−δTey, or by the synthesis of new compounds with mixed guests.4. ConclusionsIn summary, the TE properties of the film made from KCu7−xS4 nanowires is much better than that of the film made from Cu7S4 mixed nanoparticles and nanowires in the temperature range below 430 K and above 550 K due to its lower thermal conductivity, higher electrical conductivity and larger Seebeck coefficient. The low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity are the result of the clathrate and sub-lattice structure, where the K guest entities are believed to have independent oscillations, so-called rattler modes, which scatter the acoustic phonons and reduce the thermal conductivity, and the sub-lattice structure of a ‘liquid-like’ charged fluid of host Cu ions inhibits the propagation of transverse waves to disrupt heat propagation by phonons but does not affect its superionic conduction. In addition, the high electrical conductivity of the KCu7−xS4 nanowire film is also due to the high degree of orientation of the nanowires in the film. The high degree of orientation of the nanowires in the film allows high electrical conductivity along the film plane. In this sense, our work indicates a new direction to broaden the scope of thermoelectric materials by introducing kalium into copper chalcogenides to form copper vacancy-rich clathrate and sub-lattice hybrid structures with ‘phonon glass and liquid–electron crystal’ properties.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the NSFCQ (cstc2012jjB0006), SRFDP (20110191110034), NSFDYS (50925205), NSFC (11204388), the “100 Talents Program” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the large-scale equipment sharing fund of Chongqing University.ReferencesC.
