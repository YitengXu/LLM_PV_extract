    , Accepted 21st January 2021First published on 22nd January 2021AbstractOwing to their emerging role in solar cell technology, lead halide perovskites have aroused significant research interest in the recent past. However, due to its obvious toxicity, looking for a potential alternative to lead is becoming one of the most important pursuits in present times. We present our work based on density functional theory (DFT) investigating lead free defect perovskites (Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)). In particular, we explore the crystal structure, thermodynamic stability, electronic structure, and optical properties of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as a function of increasing Te concentration. Our results show that the Sn–Te alloyed perovskites exhibit considerable stability, a suitable band gap, small effective mass, and excellent light absorption. Especially, Rb2Sn0.75Te0.25I6 and Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 have a direct band gap of 1.35 and 1.44 eV, respectively, which is highly favorable for use in a single-junction photovoltaic cell. We hope that our work will arouse the interest of experimental as well as theoretical scientists for synthesizing new materials and/or exploring the Sn–Te mix as a potential substitute for lead in photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
During the last decade, significant progress has been made in the field of halide perovskites (HPs) due to their promising role in future photovoltaic technology.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on HPs has improved considerably, reaching 25.2%5 in a few years. The PCE achieved so far is comparable to commercially available materials such as silicon (c-Si@27.6%) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS@23.4%).6,7 Such a rapid increase in the PCE of lead based perovskites is mainly due to a suitable band gap, high optical absorption, ambipolar nature of charge transport, and long-photo-generated carrier diffusion lengths.2,8–10 However, despite all the progress achieved, organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIH-PVKs) have some serious issues: most notably the toxic nature of lead (Pb) and instability against moisture, high temperature, and light.8,11,12 The presence of the toxic Pb in high performance OIH-PVKs causes environmental contamination and some brain related symptoms such as intellectual disability.11,13 Similarly, the highly efficient OIH-PVKs contain organic cations on the A-site, such as formamidinium (CH(NH2)2) or methylammonium (CH3NH3), which are highly volatile and hygroscopic.14 This makes OIH-PVKs highly unstable and they tend to degrade rapidly in a humid environment. Thus both the issues undoubtedly hinder further development of perovskite photovoltaic technology, opening up diverse opportunities for researchers to replace Pb in hybrid halide perovskites with other nontoxic benign metals.15,16 Concerted efforts have led to the development of nontoxic and air-stable halide perovskites with the hope that the problems mentioned above may be overcome whilst key properties are preserved for emerging perovskite solar cells.17–25
There are two possible ways to make perovskite related absorbers suitable for effective commercialization. The first strategy is to replace both the organic (monovalent) and Pb (divalent) cations in AB2+X3 perovskites with other suitable elements. The most obvious choice for the A-site cation is Cs+ and Rb+, whereas, for B2+, some non-toxic divalent cations from group 2, group 12, and group 14 (Sn2+ and Ge2+) may be considered. This in turn can significantly enhance the perovskite thermal/moisture stability. Among these, only Sn-based halide perovskites have achieved reasonable PCEs of magnitude 6.4%.19 The second route is to design alternative all-inorganic perovskites by introducing trivalent (Bi3+ and Sb3+), tetravalent (Sn4+ and Te4+), and multivalent (Ag+ and Bi3+) cations in the AB2+X3 structure.26 This results in Pb-free perovskite derivatives of the type A3B23+X9, A2B4+X6, and A2B+B3+X6 (A = Cs or a monovalent inorganic ion, B = a non-Pb trivalent/tetravalent cation, and X = halogen).27 Trivalent and tetravalent substitutions transform the 3-dimensional (3D) and octahedral corner-sharing AB2+X3 perovskite into 2D and 0D perovskites with the corresponding octahedral edge-sharing and face-sharing environment. The multivalent substitution retains the same 3D structure wherein every pair of B-cations in AB2+X3 is replaced by one B+ (Cu+/Ag+) and one B3+ (Bi3+/In3+) cation.26 Many halide perovskites have been theoretically designed and experimentally synthesized based on multi and/or trivalent substitution, such as Cu+, Ag+, Bi3+, and Sb3+ (e.g., Cs3Bi2I9 2.2 eV, Cs3Sb2I9 2.4 eV, and Cs2AgBiBr6 2.2 eV).22,27,28 Such HPs have shown promising photovoltaic properties, including better stability against moisture and excess carrier recombination lifetime. However, their suboptimal band gap is undesirable, making them unsuitable for photovoltaic applications.29
Recently, A2BX6 perovskites have attracted increasing attention for use in photovoltaic technology and as an alternative to OIH-PVKs due to the non- or less-toxic nature. In comparison to ABX3, the A2BX6 structure exhibits enhanced air and moisture stability under ambient conditions, correlating with the presence of a tetravalent B-cation (formally 4+ oxidation in A2BX6 compared with 2+ in ABX3).24,30,31 The structure contains ordered vacancies with isolated [BX6]2− octahedra, more recently referred to as vacancy ordered double perovskites or defect perovskites.23,31 Unlike ideal perovskites, the [BX6]2− octahedra in the A2BX6 structure do not share vertices, and can be described as zero-dimensional perovskites.32
Various efforts have been made to develop defect perovskites A2BX6. Among them, Sn-based materials are of great interest and demonstrated the best PCE (∼8.5%).20 The initial study on such HPs was performed by Lee et al., reporting Cs2SnI6 as a hole transport material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).30 The compound adopts cubic Fmm type structure at ambient temperature, and shows enhanced air/moisture stability, n-type electrical conductivity, a direct band gap (∼1.3 eV) and good visible light absorption, all of which are favorable for most photovoltaic applications.23,24,30 Replacing ‘Cs’ with the smaller ‘Rb’ cation produces Rb2SnI6, accompanied by major changes in crystal structure and the subsequent optoelectronic properties.33 Rb2SnI6 crystallizes in three different phases (cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic)33,34 and, like Cs2SnI6, exhibits n-type electrical conductivity. Similarly, several Sn-based representatives of the A2BX6 family were also reported, for instance K2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br, I),35 Cs2Sn(I,Br)6,36 and Cs2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br, I).31,37 During the past few years, research on A2BX6 based perovskites has expanded to include other tetravalent cations, most notably Ti(IV),14,29 Te(IV),23 Ge(IV),38 Pd(IV),39,40 and Pt(IV),41,42 paving the way to replace Sn in A2SnX6. In this context, Ju and his co-workers14,29 studied a series of Ti-based perovskites with general composition A2TiX6 (A = K, Rb, Cs, In, MA (methylammonium), FA (formamidinium); X = I, Br, or Cl). The compounds, namely K2TiI6, Rb2TiI6, Cs2TiI6, and In2TiI6, possess optimum band gap (1.0–1.8 eV) and desired electronic/optical properties as visible-light absorber materials for PV applications. Maughan et al.23 carried out an integrated study by combining theory and experiment to understand the structure–property relationship in a Cs2(Sn/Te)I6 defect perovskite. The study also reported the electronic, optical, and defect properties of Sn and Te doped solid solution, Cs2Sn1−xTexI6. Ma and Li38 incorporated Ge in Cs2SnI6 to see the effect on the structure as well as the electronic, elastic, and thermodynamic nature of Cs2Sn1−xGexI6. Similarly, palladium (Pd) based A2BX6 perovskites have been reported in many studies for a wide array of optoelectronic applications.39,41,43,44 Very recently, Schwartz et al. synthesized Cs2PtI6 using solution processing techniques.42 The study reported a band gap of 1.4 eV and high optical absorption >105 cm−1, suggesting Cs2PtI6 as a possible layer in single- or multi-layer photovoltaic devices.
In extension, doping has been considered as an effective strategy to improve the stability and the fundamental properties of optoelectronic semiconductors.45 Doping engineering relies on the incorporation of a small amount of impurities into the host, causing changes in the stability and photovoltaic performance of halide perovskites.46 It has been successfully applied in low dimensional as well as other perovskites to understand the crystal symmetry and band gap engineering.47 Previously, several groups reported impurity doping in halide perovskites. For example, Zhou et al.48 fabricated a Bi-doped organometal halide perovskite and found ultrabroad photoluminescence and electroluminescence. They further suggested low cost and earth-abundant perovskite semiconductors for different optical sources. The same authors also examined the effect of various metal doping in lead halide perovskites.46 In particular, metallic elements, such as Bi, Rb, Sr, and Mn, were incorporated as dopants for improving the performance of halide perovskites. Another group of researchers tuned the efficiency of Sn-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with mixed A-site organic cations. The authors reported a PCE of magnitude 8.12% for (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3.49 Similarly, in A2BX6 perovskites, successful doping has been reported. For instance, Tan and his co-workers13 prepared Bi-doped Cs2SnI6 and confirmed blue emission at 455 nm and an outstanding photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The reported PLQY is up to 80%, which is the highest ever reported value among all inorganic Pb-free perovskites. Yuan et al.50 reported the thermal stability and optical properties of Cs2SnI6−xBrx (x = 0–6) for potential applications in solar cells.
Herein, for the first time, we report a series of lead-free A2BX6 mixed tin and tellurium perovskites using an element mixing strategy. We chose Rb2SnI6 as a host and Te as the dopant for a Pb-free and stable perovskite Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The successful substitution of Sn by Te is due to the close match between the ionic radii of Sn and Te. We systematically assessed the geometric structure, electronic, and optical properties of the selected perovskite derivatives using the rules of density functional theory in order to find better candidates for optoelectronics and solar cell applications. The Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 compounds adopt cubic Fmm structure across the entire range of Te substitution. The compositional influence on the electronic structure and optical properties is then studied using the highly successful modified Becke Johnson and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof functionals. The band gap of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 increases linearly with increasing Te content, leading to a tunable range of 1.10 to 2.18 eV. Our results on the optical properties show that the Te-doped materials exhibit significant absorption in the visible range, suggesting these materials as promising solar light harvesters. The suitable band gap, enhanced stability, and high optical absorption make them ideal candidates for a wide range of applications, from single-junction devices and top/bottom cells for tandem photovoltaics to light-emitting devices.
2. Computational methods
First-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), based on DFT.51 The standard projector augmented wave (PAW) method was adopted to describe the ion–electron interactions.52 A plane-wave cutoff energy of 450 eV was employed in all the calculations to avoid the error arising from Pulay stress.53 The 4s2 4p6 5s1 (Rb), 4d10 5s2 5p2 (Sn), 4d10 5s2 5p4 (Te) and 5s2 5p5 (I) electrons were treated explicitly as valence electrons. DFT calculations were performed on unit cells of vacancy-ordered double perovskite Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 containing randomly distributed Te atoms replacing Sn atoms for x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1. The relevant crystal structure was geometrically relaxed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation (XC) functional.54 For the electronic properties, we used the modified Becke Johnson (mBJ)55 and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)56 functionals. The HSE06 functional incorporates 75% of the exchange and 100% of the correlation energies from PBE together with an exact exchange (α) contribution of 25%. The k-point sampling for the Brillouin zone was done with the Monkhorst–Pack scheme57 centered at the Γ point with a grid spacing of 0.02 × 2π Å−1, both for ionic and self-consistent field (SCF) iterations. The convergence criteria for the forces (in ionic step iterations) and energy (in SCF iterations) were selected as 10−2 eV Å−1 and 1.0 × 10−5 eV, respectively, whereas 170 bands were chosen for the band gap calculations. Compositions corresponding to 25, 50, 75, and 100% Te concentrations were generated using the Material Studio package, and all the schematic representations of the crystal structure were rendered by the VESTA plotting tool.58 Since the unit cell is so small, few Sn positions are indeed available to generate this randomness, and thus the layout of substitutional Te atoms could have been perfectly created by hand for the same results.
The optical parameters were investigated in terms of frequency (ω) dependent dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) ± iε2(ω), where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. The imaginary part shows the energy absorption and can be calculated by the following expression59 (1)(e: electronic charge, m: mass of an electron, ω: frequency of photons used to excite electrons, ħ: reduced Planck's constant, ψc and ψv: wave function in the conduction and valence bands, : momentum operator, : the momentum matrix element, and Ec and Ev: energy eigenvalues).
The real part (also called the dispersive part) of the dielectric function shows the extent of polarization and can be calculated from the imaginary part using the Kramers–Kronig relationship60 (2)where P is the principal value of the integral. Other optical parameters such as the absorption coefficient α(ω) and the exciton binding energy (Eb) can be calculated from ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) using the following relationship (3) (4)where ‘c’ is the speed of light, ‘μr’ is the reduced effective mass, and ‘εs’ is the electronic or optical dielectric constant. The optical properties were calculated using the PAW formalism described by Gajdoš and his co-workers,61 implemented in VASP. For the post-processing of the VASP data, we used the VASPKit code62 to obtain the optical properties.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric properties
In principle, the structure of A2BX6 can be derived from the corresponding ABX3 perovskite by orderly removing half of the B-atoms in the octahedral cluster.8 The cage between the BI6 octahedral frameworks is filled with A-cations, which is itself surrounded by twelve I-anions. Each B-cation has six iodide ions in coordination (2 in the apical and 4 in the equatorial direction). Due to this structural change, the B–X bond length in A2BX6 gets smaller, giving rise to high chemical stability.
According to our calculations, the Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloyed compounds crystallize in a face-centered cubic structure with space group Fmm (no. 225). The Rb atoms occupy the 8c sites and the B-atoms (Sn/Te) occupy the 4a sites, while the iodide anions stay at the 24e Wyckoff sites. The optimized geometries of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 are shown in Fig. 1. The lattice parameters obtained with the PBE functional in comparison with the available experimental data on Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 are given in Table 1. To our knowledge, only the end members (Rb2SnI6 and Rb2TeI6) have been synthesized experimentally.34,63 Our results show that the lattice constant is 11.87 Å and 11.92 Å for Rb2SnI6 and Rb2TeI6, respectively, in fair agreement with reported experimental values (with a difference of ∼2%). For the mixed Sn–Te compounds, a slight increase in the lattice constant is observed in accordance with increasing Te concentration (Fig. S1, ESI†). For the doped systems, we noticed that the optimized lattice parameters are the same for the face-centered doping as well as the apex position i.e. the doping site does not affect the cell parameters. Therefore, we only considered face-centered doping in this study. Further, we see that the unit cell volume increases with increasing Te concentration (Fig. S1, ESI†), presumably due to the replacement of Sn4+ with Te4+. To better understand the geometric structure, we calculated different bond lengths after geometry optimization and presented them in Table S1 (ESI†) in comparison with available experimental values. The bond lengths Rb–B and B–I (B = Sn, Te) per our calculations lie in the range of 5.13–5.16 Å and 2.90–2.96 Å, respectively.

To assess the crystallographic stability and structural distortion of the compounds, we used the tolerance factor (t), introduced by V. M. Goldschmidt,64  (where rA, rB, and rX are the radii of A, B, and X site atoms) and the octahedral factor μ (μ = rB/rX).65 Both of these parameters are considered very effective in knowing the stability or otherwise of compounds of type A2BX6.66 For Rb2Sn1−xTexI6, we considered Sn(IV) and Te(IV) as similar cations and used the following expression to calculate the average ionic radii with nearly identical size rB = [(1 − x) × rSn + x × rTe]. The halide perovskites are considered stable for ranges of t and μ as 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 1.11 and μ > 0.414,67 respectively.
From the Shannon ionic radii,68 we used rRb = 1.72 Å for Rb+, rSn = 0.69 Å for Sn4+, rTe = 0.97 Å for Te4+, and rI = 2.20 Å for iodine to get a precise tolerance factor. The calculated t and μ values for a range of Sn–Te composition are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table S2 (ESI†). It can be seen that all the structures cover the range where the perovskite phase is stable 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 1.11 and this consequently gives evidence that mixed Sn–Te perovskites Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 can be created.

A bottleneck for commercialization of perovskite-based photovoltaics is their long-term stability. Therefore, we have estimated the formation energies of the parent as well as the mixed perovskites in terms of the possible pathways. According to an earlier report,42 the formation process of A2BX6 perovskites can be defined as follows.A2BX6 → 2AX + BX4In order to find the stability, we define the formation energy of A2BX6 (A = Rb; B = Sn, Te; and X = I) by the following equation Ef = E(A2BX6) − 2E(AX) − E(BX4)(5)where the term Ef represents the formation energy, and E(A2BX6), E(AX), and E(BX4) are the total energies of the compounds involved in the decomposition reaction obtained through the PBE method. For the Te-doped system, the formation energies are calculated using the following decomposition reaction Ef = E(Rb2Sn1−xTexI6) − [2E(RbI) + (1 − x)E(SnI4) + xE(TeI4)](6)where x represents ratios of 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4. In the literature, the sign, as well as the magnitude, of Ef is mostly used to assess the stability of a compound.42 Accordingly, a negative Ef suggests stability whereas a positive value would indicate instability. The obtained results are plotted in Fig. 3, suggesting that all the structures except Rb2SnI6 are stable. The formation energy increases gradually with increasing the proportion of Te in the mixture. Particularly, Rb2Sn0.25Te0.75I6 and Rb2TeI6 are significantly stable inside the Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 perovskite set of systems.
 Fig. 3  The calculated formation energies (eV) of Sn–Te perovskites with change in the Te proportion (0 to 100%). 
In addition, we also performed thermodynamic stability calculations via the convex hull approach. For each compound, the experimentally known competing phases were considered and their total energies were calculated to construct the phase diagram. To obtain stable growth of Rb2(Sn,Te)I6 and to avoid the formation of other competing phases, the relative chemical potentials were constrained to meet the following necessary conditions 2ΔμRb + ΔμB+ 6ΔμI = ΔH(Rb2BI6) (B = Sn, Te)(7) Δμi ≤ 0, (i = Rb, Sn, Te, I)(8) njΔμRb + mjΔμB + qjΔμI ≤ H(RbnjBmjIqj), j = 1,…,Z(9)where Δμi = Δμi − Δμ0i denotes the deviation of the chemical potential of atomic species i during the growth from that of the most stable bulk phase. ΔH is the enthalpy of formation (per formula unit) and RbnjBmjIqj represents all the known competing phases. Eqn (7) is the equilibrium growth condition. Eqn (8) is used to avoid precipitation into elemental solids Rb, Sn, Te and I, and eqn (9) ensures the energetic stability of Rb2(Sn,Te)I6 against the possible binary and ternary competing phases. The existing competing phases and their formation energies are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The chemical potential ranges for single phase Rb2SnI6 and Rb2TeI6 in a two dimensional plane with two independent variables ΔμRb and ΔμSn/ΔμTe are illustrated in Fig. 4. For each compound, all the relevant binary and ternary phases are also shown. The stable sliced polygon regions are shaded in green and the lines surrounding them are the existing competing phases. As evident from Fig. 4, no stable region exists for Rb2SnI6 whereas Rb2TeI6 is thermodynamically stable under Te-rich conditions.

3.2. Electronic properties
A key factor for assessing the performance of a solar cell is the nature of the electronic band gap of the absorbing material. In order to achieve a theoretical efficiency of >25%, the band gap value should be within the range 0.9–1.6 eV.69 The electronic properties of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) have been computed using the optimized data given in Table 1. The band gap calculated using the PBE approximation lies in the range 0.13–1.78 eV (Table S4, ESI†). However, it is well known that the PBE-GGA method severely underestimates the band gap. Therefore, we have performed expensive mBJ and HSE06 calculations to get an accurate estimation of the band gap. The details of the band gap of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with the mBJ and HSE06 methods are presented in Fig. 5 (data listed in Table S4, ESI†). Our calculations (in case of both mBJ and HSE06) show an increase in the band gap with increasing the proportion of Te. As shown in Fig. 5, the band gap is found to be 1.10, 1.35, 1.44, 1.67 and 2.18 eV for x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1, respectively. As the B–I (B = Sn/Te) bond length increases with increasing Te content, a decrease in the interaction between B and I atoms may be causing less orbital overlap and band dispersions leading to an increase in the band gap. Our results on the band gap suggest that Rb2Sn0.75Te0.25I6 (1.35 eV) and Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 (1.44 eV) are the most suitable compounds within the set for a single-junction solar cell. Similarly, our calculations indicate that Rb2SnI6 (1.10 eV) is useful as a low band gap bottom cell in tandem devices. The compound Rb2Sn0.25Te0.75I6 (1.67 eV) seems appropriate to be used as a top cell material in tandem devices. Meanwhile, Rb2TeI6 (2.18 eV) does not suit as an ideal material for photovoltaic application due to its larger band gap. The band structure calculated on the basis of the HSE06 functional corresponding to the end members of the group Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is shown in Fig. 6, whereas the band structure for the doped systems is plotted in the ESI† (Fig. S2). In the case of Rb2SnI6, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) both lie at the Γ point, while, in Rb2TeI6, the VBM and the CBM lie at the Γ and L lines, respectively. It is well known that a semiconducting material with a direct optical transition is more favorable than an indirect one. Fortunately, among the five compounds, Rb2SnI6, Rb2Sn0.75Te0.25I6, and Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 have been found to possess a direct band gap nature (at the Γ point), while the other two combinations, viz. Rb2Sn0.25Te0.75I6, and Rb2TeI6, exhibit an indirect band gap character (Fig. 6 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The direct band gap character of Rb2SnI6 is consistent with theoretically obtained results reported elsewhere.41 It is noticeable that the optical transition nature of these compounds changes with the increase of the Te concentration.

To further understand the nature of the valence and conduction bands, the density of states (DOS) characteristics of these compounds were also simulated. The projected DOSs for the parent and the Sn–Te mixed perovskites exhibit similar profiles (Fig. 7 and Fig. S3, ESI†). It suggests that the Rb-cation does not contribute to the band edges because the orbitals of Rb are too far from the Fermi level, i.e. the molecules do not take part in the active region. It can act as a charge compensator to balance the charge neutrality of the ionic perovskite system. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, only the valence orbital contributions of Sn, Te, and I around the Fermi level are presented. The main contribution to the valence band (VB) of all these perovskites comes predominantly from 5p orbitals of halogen atoms. Similarly, the conduction band (CB) is formed due to the overlap of the B-site (5s for Sn and 5p for Te) and the I-site (5p) orbitals. For the Te doped systems, a closer look at the DOS plots reveals that the states just below the valence band maximum around −0.25 eV (responsible for charge carrier as well as energy transport) contain a mixture of Te-s and halogen p orbitals. Moreover, the calculated DOS results happen to be in good agreement with the Cs based A2BX6 perovskites.23,41 Upon increasing the Te concentration, we notice that the dominant contributing orbital to the CB becomes Te-5p, replacing Sn-5s, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). This phenomenon may be responsible for the increase of the electronic band gap with the Te concentration in Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 perovskites. Consequently, we can say that the electronic properties, which were primarily controlled by Sn4+ in Rb2SnI6, are now controlled by a new hybrid orbital of Te4+ and Sn4+ in the mixed state of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6.

3.3. Optical properties
The complex dielectric function, ε(ω) = ε1(ω) ± iε2(ω), describes the optical response of a material to incident light and is calculated on the basis of the linear response method.70,71 The real part, ε1(ω), is related to the electronic polarizability of a material, whereas the imaginary part ε2(ω) gives information about the absorption behavior of a crystal. We calculated the dielectric properties of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as a function of photon energy from zero to 5 eV. The real parts of ε(ω) of pure and doped Rb2SnI6 are shown in Fig. 8(a, c and e) and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The static dielectric constants ε0 are found to be 4.20, 4.32, 5.14, 5.22, and 5.27, for x = 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1, respectively. The results reveal anisotropy in the optical properties of cubic Rb2Sn1−xTexI6. The increase in the value of ε0 with increasing Te proportion may indicate a smaller exciton binding energy. Beyond the zero frequency limit, ε1(ω) starts to increase with the increase of the photon energy, showing various peaks as shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2. The highest among the peaks corresponds to Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 with a maximum value of 11.77 at 2.30 eV (Fig. 8e). The spectrum of Rb2Sn0.75Te0.25I6 (Fig. 8c) contains three main peaks at 1.05, 2.25, and 3.57 eV, followed by a small peak in the ultraviolet region (4.72 eV). It can be observed that the Te-doped systems show a higher dielectric constant compared to the pure Rb2SnI6. Further, it should be noted that the majority of peaks are centered in the energy range ∼1.1–3.7 eV. However, with the increase of the Te concentration, the curves seem to move towards the red side in the visible region, i.e. towards smaller photon energies.

A similar trend is also visible in the imaginary part of the dielectric function, shown in Fig. 8(b, d and f) and Fig. S4 (ESI†). For Rb2SnI6 as well as the Te-doped (x = 0.25 and 0.50) systems, the dielectric spectra contain three main peaks (labelled as I, II, and III) with multiple shoulders at different energy values. The value of ε2(ω) starts to increase at photon energies equal to or greater than the fundamental band gap. With the increase of the Te to Sn ratio, the magnitude of ε2(ω) becomes larger and the peaks on the curve get more pronounced in the visible range of the spectrum. In conjunction with the DOS plots, the ε2(ω) peaks can be attributed to the transition between the orbitals in the VB and the CB. In particular, the low energy peaks are associated with the transition between I-5p orbitals in the uppermost VB and Sn-5s/Te-5p orbitals in the CB. For Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6, the highest peak lies at about 1.50 eV, indicating a significant absorption in the region. Similarly, for Rb2Sn0.25Te0.75I6 and Rb2TeI6, no noticeable features in the dielectric function ε2(ω) show up except a broad peak at ∼2.90 eV. It can be concluded that, in terms of the dielectric properties, Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 is a suitable choice for optoelectronics and solar cell applications.
The charge carrier transport is another essential property of efficient solar cell absorbers. The effective mass of electrons and holes contributes significantly to the mobility of the carriers inside a solar cell. To assess the carrier mobility, the carrier effective mass of Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 is estimated according to  (ε(k) is the band edge eigenvalue).72 We calculated the effective mass using the DFT-HSE06 rendered eigenvalues at more dense k-points by the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory.73 Since both the electrons and holes in Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 thermally relax to the bottom of the CB and top of the VB, their effective mass (Table 2) was calculated from the band structure according to the above expression. The reduced effective mass was calculated using μ = memh/(me + mh). In general, the more dispersive the band near the edges, the smaller the effective mass, and vice versa. Altogether, the holes are found to be heavier than the electrons, which indicates better electron transport. This may be due to the fact that the lowest conduction band, derived primarily from delocalized Sn-s/Te-p orbitals, is more dispersive than the highest valence band, derived predominantly from low energy halogen p orbitals. Therefore, the electron effective mass me* is smaller than the hole effective mass. Table 2 shows relatively smaller me* values for the end-members as well as for the mixed Sn–Te perovskites (with x = 0.75), suggesting their better carrier transport ability, which is a crucial factor for a better PCE of a solar cell. In contrast, the hole mass mh* spans over a wide range 1.28–1.77m0 (m0 is the rest mass of an electron). It is worth noting that in all the perovskites under our investigation, the effective mass profile is rather complex due to the presence of multiple valence bands around the band edges. To account for the excitonic effect, the exciton binding energies (Table 2) were calculated using the dielectric constant and the reduced effective mass values obtained in our study. We calculated two types of exciton binding energy: (1) Eb, calculated on the basis of a static dielectric constant by including the phonon contribution, and (2) Ẽb, calculated using the maximum dielectric constant without taking into account the phonon contribution. We observed that the dielectric constant and the exciton binding energy vary in an inverse fashion.
A very important parameter in photovoltaics characterization, the absorption coefficient, of these compounds was calculated in the limit of the visible photon energy (Fig. 9). The absorption coefficient of Rb2SnI6 seems to be largely influenced by the presence of the Te dopant. For Rb2Sn0.75Te0.25I6, the strongest absorption (∼6.9 × 105 cm−1) occurs at approximately 1.97 eV. Similarly, for Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6, the maximum absorption (6.04 × 105 cm−1) occurs at 2.6 eV. Both the compounds possess a broad absorption spectrum in the visible range (1.50–2.60 eV), suitable for use as absorbing layers in PSCs. Further, we notice that the light absorption is significantly higher in the mixed Sn–Te perovskite as compared with the end-members.
 Fig. 9  The calculated absorption spectra (left) and SLME (right) of the Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 perovskite. 
In the Shockley–Queisser scheme,69 the solar cell efficiency mainly depends upon the band gap value, which is regarded as a primary metric for efficient PV materials. However, the band gap is not the only factor to evaluate the performance of a solar cell. In fact, strong visible light absorption, the allowed band gap nature (direct/indirect), and the thickness of the solar absorber layer are all crucial parameters for achieving highly efficient PSCs. Taking the above facts into account, the spectroscopic-limited-maximum-efficiency (SLME) metric is calculated according to the method adopted by Yu and Zunger.74 The SLME method has shown superiority over the Shockley–Queisser limit in several ways: (i) the non-radiative recombination rate is approximated, which is based on the difference between the fundamental band gap and the lowest allowed optical transition, (ii) the optical absorption depending on frequency (ω) is taken into account, and (iii) the thickness of the absorber layer is considered. Using the above screening criteria, the SLME for our compounds was calculated (Fig. 9). All the compounds except the one with x = 0.75 have shown to possess a large SLME. Compound Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 exhibits the highest efficiency correlated with its favorable band gap and high optical absorption.
4. Conclusions
We investigated the crystal structure, formation energies, and electronic and optical properties of defect perovskites Rb2Sn1−xTexI6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) of the family A2BX6 using density functional theory. By applying the PBE-GGA, mBJ, and HSE06 functionals, we explored the substitution of Sn on the B-site by Te in detail, which seems to significantly change the band gap and structural stability of the compound. The calculated structural parameters obtained at the PBE-level have been found in good agreement with the available experimental results. Our results show an increasing trend in the band gap from 1.10 to 2.18 eV with increasing Te concentration, revealing the potential use of these compounds in a wide variety of optoelectronics devices such as single- and multi-junction PSCs. Optically, these perovskites possess high dielectric constant, large optical absorption, and suitable electron–hole effective masses. The spectroscopic-limited-maximum-efficiency criterion shows that the compound with x = 0.5 exhibits the highest efficiency. The overall analysis of the structural stability, electronic, and optical properties suggests that Rb2Sn0.75Te0.25I6 and Rb2Sn0.50Te0.50I6 with a direct band gap of 1.35 and 1.44 eV, respectively, are potential candidates for optoelectronic applications.
