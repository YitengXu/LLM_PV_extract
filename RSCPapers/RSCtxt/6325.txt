    , Accepted 4th June 2022First published on 6th June 2022AbstractPlasmon-catalyzed decarboxylation reactions of Ru(II) bis(2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) denoted as Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(II) tris(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) denoted as Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes in hydrosol systems with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) conditioned by the presence of Ag(0) adsorption sites on Ag NP surfaces have been revealed by surface-enhanced (resonance) Raman scattering (SERRS and/or SERS) spectral probing and monitoring further supported by factor analysis. Interpretation of the experimental results was based on an identification of specific marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy and of the Ru-bpy units. Furthermore, by a series of specifically targeted SERRS and/or SERS experiments complemented by UV/vis spectral measurements and TEM imaging of deposited Ag NPs, plasmon catalysis by charge carriers, namely hot electrons (e−) and hot holes (h+), has been established as the most probable mechanism of decarboxylation reactions undergone by the carboxylate-chemisorbed Ru-dcbpy units of the complexes. The presence of Ag(0) adsorption sites on Ag NP surfaces as the necessary condition of the reaction progress is in full accord with the charge carrier mechanism of plasmon catalysis. In particular, the neutral Ag(0) sites create the interface required for the transport of hot e− to H+ co-reactants complementing thus the C–C bond breaking and CO2 formation caused by hot h+.
1. Introduction
Chemical transformations of various chemical species on the surfaces of plasmonic metal nanostructures (NS) have recently become a subject of focused interest particularly in connection with identification of plasmon-catalyzed reactions and elucidation of their mechanisms.1–13 Plasmon catalysis provides challenging possibilities of conversion of light energy into chemical bond energy.1–13 Surface-enhanced (resonance) Raman spectroscopy (SERS and SERRS) has been established as the most suitable tool for monitoring reactions of molecular species in hybrid systems with plasmonic NS, such as Ag and Au nanoparticles (NPs).14–16 Furthermore, detailed SERS and/or SERRS spectral studies carried out under various conditions can actually reveal new surface reactions undergone by chemical species.17–19
Chromophoric Ru(II) polypyridine complexes are well known for their interesting photophysical properties20 and as a class of efficient sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells.21–23 These complexes have also been employed as model chromophores in exploration of the mechanisms of SERS and SERRS.24,25 In particular, in our previous study, we employed Ru(II) bis(2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) denoted as Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(II) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) denoted as Ru(bpy)3 complex dications for a comparative evaluation of the effect of chemisorption and/or electrostatic bonding of a chromophore to the surface of Ag NPs on the molecular resonance contribution to SERRS.25 For this purpose, we have performed an assignment of SERS and SERRS spectral marker bands of the Ru-bpy and Ru-dcbpy units in the chemisorbed Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex on the basis of the mutual differences between their SERRS and SERS excitation profiles,25 and of the previously published normal coordinate analysis (NCA) of Ru(bpy)3.26 In addition to that, a suitable preaggregation agent was required to ensure the same morphology of Ag NPs assemblies, and consequently, the same electromagnetic mechanism contribution to the overall SERRS enhancement experienced by each of the two complexes. Surprisingly, chlorides, frequently used as a preaggregation agent,27,28 were found unsuitable for this purpose, since their addition caused remarkable changes in the SERRS spectra of the chemisorbed Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex (hence the non-invasive perchlorates were employed as an alternative).25
In this work, the preliminary identification of the above-mentioned spectral changes as the disappearance of SERRS spectral marker bands of the dcbpy unit coordinated to Ru(II) in the Ru(II) bis(2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) complex, further denoted as Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) throughout this paper, has initiated our systematic exploration of surface-reactivity of this complex, as well as of another dcbpy-containing Ru(II) complex, namely Ru(II) tris(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) denoted as Ru(dcbpy)3, in systems with modified Ag nanoparticle hydrosols. In particular, this study aims at (i) identification of reaction products, establishing the reaction pathways and of the surface character of the reactions, (ii) specification of the conditions of the reaction progress, and (iii) establishing the role of plasmon mediation in the reaction progress and revealing of the most probable mechanism of plasmon catalysis. SERS and SERRS spectral measurements and monitoring complemented by resonance Raman scattering (RRS) and UV/vis spectral measurements and their interpretation, supported, when appropriate, by a multivariant statistical method of spectral set evaluation, namely factor analysis (FA), have been established as the appropriate tools for the achievement of these goals (Section 3.1 of Results and discussion). In Section 3.2, exploration of the surface reactions of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex in systems with Ag NPs initiated by addition of chlorides as well as by an alternative, purposefully designed initiation procedure is reported, together with the characterization of the selected systems by TEM imaging and surface plasmon extinction (SPE) measurements. Investigation of the reactivity of Ru(dcbpy)3 complex under the same conditions (as in Section 3.2) is described in Section 3.3. The final evaluation of the reaction conditions and establishing of the most probable mechanism of plasmon catalysis of these reactions is given, for both complexes, in Section 3.4.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Analytical grade AgNO3, NaBH4, NaCl and NaOH were purchased from Merck and HCl from Lach-Ner. Tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) dichloride was obtained from Fluka and cis–bis(2,2′-bipyridyl)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) hexafluoro–phosphate (Ruthenizer 455-PF6) and tris(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) dichloride (Ruthenizer 470) from Solaronix (SA). Distilled deionized water was used for all sample preparations.
2.2. Preparation procedures

2.2.1. AgNP hydrosol. 
Ag NP hydrosol was prepared by reduction of AgNO3 by NaBH4 in aqueous ambient according to the previously reported preparation procedure (ii).29


2.2.2. AgNP hydrosol/complex systems. 
AgNP hydrosol/complex systems were prepared by adding 20 μL of a 1 × 10−4 M aqueous solution of Ru(II) bis(2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) (bis)hexafluorophosphate [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)](PF6)2 and/or of Ru(II) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) dichloride [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 to 2 mL of Ag NP hydrosol yielding thus 1 × 10−6 M final concentration of the complex in the system. For Ru(II) tris(4,4′-dicarboxy-bipyridine) dichloride [Ru(dcbpy)3]Cl2, due to its insufficient solubility in pure water, an alkaline aqueous solution had to be prepared by addition of 200 μL of 1 M NaOH to 20 mL of the initial 1 × 10−3 M aqueous solution. Subsequently, 20 μL of this solution were added to 2 mL of Ag NP hydrosol (yielding thus 1 × 10−5 M final concentration of the complex in the system).


2.2.3. AgNP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaCl. 
To 2 mL of the initial AgNP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (1 × 10−6 M) system, various amounts of 1 × 10−2 M aqueous solution of NaCl were added, namely 0, 10, 50, 75, 100, 125, 250, 375, 500, 750 and 1000 μL. The final concentration of NaCl was thus varied step-wise in the 0–5 × 10−3 M range. The systems were used as samples for SERRS spectral measurements subsequently subjected to factor analysis (FA, vide infra).


2.2.4. AgNP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3/NaCl and AgNP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3/NaCl/HCl systems. 
To 2 mL of the initial AgNP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3 (1 × 10−5 M) system, 50 μL of 1 M NaCl were added. Subsequently, 20 μL of 1 M HCl were added to the pre-prepared AgNP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3/NaCl system. The final concentrations of NaCl and HCl were 2.5 × 10−2 M and 1 × 10−2 M, respectively.


2.2.5. Systems with AgNPs grown by chemical reduction in the presence of a complex. 
Systems with AgNPs grown by chemical reduction in the presence of either Ru(bpy)2dcbpy, or Ru(dcbpy)3, were prepared by a modification of the procedure originally employed for 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy).28 Briefly, 3.5 mg of NaBH4 were dissolved in 74 mL (or 68 mL) of distilled deionized water and cooled to 2 °C. To the former solution, 0.757 mL of 1 × 10−3 M solution of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) were added, while 7.9 mL of 1 × 10−4 M solution of Ru(dcbpy)3 were added to the latter one, respectively. Subsequently, 4.5 mL of 4.4 × 10−3 M aqueous solution of AgNO3 were added dropwise into each of the two systems, and stirred briefly. The prepared Ag NPs hydrosol system was brown in the case of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and yellow-orange in the case of Ru(dcbpy)3. The final concentration of the complexes in the systems was 1 × 10−5 M. The systems were employed as samples for SERRS and/or SERS spectral measurements 5 min after preparation.

2.3. Instrumentation
Raman spectra (RRS, SERRS and/or SERS) of all samples were measured with a DXR Raman spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a macro-adapter for liquid samples and quartz cuvettes with either 1 cm or 0.2 cm optical path. The excitation was provided by a 445 nm diode laser with a laser power set to 10 mW. Full spectral range (100–3900 cm−1, 1200 lines per mm) grating was used. SERS spectra of selected samples were measured by a MonoVista CRS+ (Spectroscopy & Imaging GmbH, Germany) spectrometer using 532 nm and/or 780 nm excitation line provided by diode lasers (laser power was approximately 10 mW, spectral range 40–3200 cm−1, 150 lines per mm grating). The spectrometer was calibrated by software-controlled auto alignment using mercury and Ne–Ar lamps. Quartz cuvettes with the 1 cm optical path length were used. UV/vis absorption spectra were measured with an Specord s600 (Analytik Jena) spectrometer using quartz cuvettes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed by using a Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin transmission electron microscope (FEI, Brno, Czech Republic) at an acceleration voltage of 120 keV. Samples for TEM imaging were prepared by deposition of a 5 μL drop of a sample onto a commercial carbon coated Cu grid which was then let to dry at room temperature.
2.4. Acquisition of set of SERRS spectra of AgNP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaCl systems measured as a function of increasing NaCl concentration
A set of 11 SERRS spectra of AgNP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaCl systems were obtained by the sequential SERRS spectral measurements of a sample prepared as described in Section 2.2.3, in which the final molar concentration of NaCl varied in the following sequence: 0; 5 × 10−5; 2.5 × 10−4; 3.8 × 10−4; 5.0 × 10−4; 6.3 × 10−4; 1.3 × 10−3; 1.9 × 10−3; 2.5 × 10−3; 3.8 × 10−3 and 5.0 × 10−3 M. The spectra were measured at 445 nm excitation with 10 mW power. It should be noted that due to the sequential measurement of the same sample after each new addition of NaCl with the accumulation time of 64 s and the 5 min break between the measurements, not only the NaCl concentration, but also the intermittent irradiation time of the sample increased.
2.5. Factor analysis
The spectral backgrounds of the 11 SERRS spectra within the particular spectral set were adjusted by using the orthogonal differences method. Subsequently, the spectral set was treated by factor analysis (FA)30 using the singular value decomposition algorithm.31 This procedure provides a set of orthonormal subspectra Sj(ν), a square matrix of virial coefficients Vij and singular values Wj which represent the statistical weight of each subspectrum. Each particular experimental spectrum Yi(ν) within the set can then be approximated as:  
The factor dimension M represents the number of independent components (subspectra) resolvable in the analyzed spectral set, and its value can be derived from the plot of the singular values as a function of the subspectrum number. The spectra of the pure spectral components Pn (n = 1, 2…M) have been obtained as linear combinations of the statistically relevant subspectra Sj(ν).  
The details of the procedure employed for obtaining the pure spectral components have been reported previously.31
3. Results and discussion
3.1. SERRS and RRS spectral marker bands of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy), Ru(dcbpy)3 and Ru(bpy)3 complexes
SERS and/or SERRS spectral monitoring of surface reactions is conditioned by a reliable identification of marker bands of reactants and products. Structural formulas and SERRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 as the prospective reactants and of Ru(bpy)3 as one of the possible products, all of them obtained from Ag NP hydrosol/complex systems at 445 nm excitation, are shown in Fig. 1A–C. Electronic absorption spectra of the complexes (Fig. S1 in ESI†) provide evidence that the 445 nm excitation coincides with the intense electronic absorption bands and fulfills thus the condition required for a resonance enhancement of Raman scattering. Employment of this excitation thus yields SERRS spectra of the complexes in systems with Ag NP hydrosols, and RRS spectra of the complexes in solution (vide infra). On the other hand, the 532 nm and 780 nm excitations provide SERS spectra of the complexes.

The wavenumbers of typical SERRS spectral bands of the complexes are listed in the first three columns of Table 1.

In addition to those, there are also the wavenumbers of spectral bands which are common to the spectra of both homoleptic complexes, as well as to the heteroleptic Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (presented in standard font). Apparently, in SERRS spectrum of the heteroleptic Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy), a superposition of the characteristic marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy (bold wavenumbers) as well as of the Ru-bpy (italic wavenumbers) structural units has been detected.
Furthermore, the disappearance of SERRS spectral marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy unit in the SERRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) observed after addition of chlorides to Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) system at 445 nm excitation has been the starting point of this study. First of all, an evidence has been required to confirm that the disappearance of the SERRS spectral marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy unit from the SERRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex signifies the absence of this unit in the structure of the resulting complex. For this purpose, RRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) in an aqueous solution and SERRS spectra of this complex localized on Ag NPs surfaces have been mutually compared in Fig. S2 (in ESI†) spectra A and B, respectively. The same comparison was done also for Ru(dcbpy)3 and Ru(bpy)3 (Fig. S3 and S4, respectively, in ESI†). In all cases, a reasonably good match is found for the intense spectral bands in the 1000–1700 cm−1 region (Tables S1–S3 in ESI†). It should be noted that the only difference between RRS and SERRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) observed in the 1200–1300 cm−1 range stems from the fact that the most intense band in this range of RRS spectrum is that of the Ru-bpy unit at 1271 cm−1, while in SERRS spectrum, the 1255 and 1293 cm−1 bands of the Ru-dcbpy unit prevail.
For Ru(bpy)3 dication which is attached to the negatively charged ions on Ag NPs surface by the electrostatic bonding,25 the abovementioned match between SERRS and RRS spectra is not surprising, and it has been reported previously.24 On the other hand, this (newly acquired) result is largely important for Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) as well as for Ru(dcbpy)3. In particular, Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) was found to be chemisorbed on Ag NPs surface by COO− group(s), as witnessed by observation of the weak spectral bands of coordinated (i.e. chemisorbed) COO− groups both in the previously reported SERRS spectra (measured at 441.6 nm excitation)25 and in the SERRS spectrum of the complex excited at 445 nm and presented here in Fig. 1A. These bands have been observed at 1366 and 1426 cm−1 in the former case, and at 1370 and 1423 cm−1 in the latter case. Observation of analogous weak spectral bands, namely 1370 and 1438 cm−1, of the chemisorbed COO− group(s) in the (newly reported) SERRS spectrum of Ru(dcbpy)3 measured at 445 nm excitation (Fig. 1B) indicates that this complex is also chemisorbed on Ag NPs surface by the COO− group(s). For these two complexes, the match between the characteristic bands of the Ru-dcbpy unit in the SERRS and the RRS spectra indicates, that their position is not principally affected by chemisorption of this unit on Ag NPs surface. Specifically, for Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex, the additivity of the distinct marker bands of the Ru-bpy and of the Ru-dcbpy units is thus proved to be the inherent characteristics of the Raman spectra of the complex both in its “free” state in solution and in its chemisorbed state on Ag NPs surfaces (Fig. 1A, Fig. S2 and Table. 1, TableS1, ESI†).
Furthermore, there is a very good match between the characteristic marker bands of the Ru-bpy units in both SERRS and RRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(bpy)3, respectively (Fig. 1A, C, Fig. S2, S4, Table 1 and Tables S1, S3, ESI†). A reasonably good match was found also for the marker bands of Ru-dcbpy units in SERRS and RRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3, respectively (Fig. 1A, B, Fig. S2, S3, Table 1 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). These results indicate that for both Ru-bpy and Ru-dcbpy units, the position of their marker bands are virtually independent on the number of bpy and/or dcbpy ligands within the particular complex.
It has to be emphasized that the distinct differences in the wavenumber positions of the marker bands of the Ru-bpy and Ru-dcbpy unit, respectively, have their chemical origin in the presence of the two electron-withdrawing carboxylate (COO−) groups as substituents of the Ru(II)-coordinated bpy ligand in the case of Ru-dcbpy unit and in their absence in the case of Ru-bpy. In particular, the presence of the two electron-withdrawing COO− substituents in the Ru-dcbpy unit, in comparison to their absence in the Ru-bpy unit, causes changes in the electron density distribution within the Ru(II)-coordinated bpy ligand. These changes manifest themselves by the shifts of SERRS as well as RRS spectral bands positions, for example 1477 cm−1 (Ru-dcbpy) → 1488 cm−1 (Ru-bpy) and 1542 cm−1 (Ru-dcbpy) → 1558 cm−1 (Ru-bpy). The established marker bands are thus more reliable indicators of the two COO− groups presence in the Ru-dcbpy unit than the COO− groups spectral bands themselves, since the latter bands are very weak, particularly in the SERRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 measured at 445 nm excitation (Fig. 1A and B). Concerning the assignment of the abovementioned marker bands of Ru-bpy and Ru-dcbpy units, it should be noted that each of the normal vibrational modes of both bpy and dcbpy ligand coordinated to Ru(II) involves changes in several internal coordinates of the aromatic, bpy part of the ligand, as demonstrated by the potential energy distribution (PED) resulting from the normal coordinate analysis (NCA) of the Ru-bpy unit in Ru(bpy)3 complex,26 presented here in Table S3 (ESI†).
In summary, for both the Ru-bpy and the Ru-dcbpy units, observation of the marker bands of the particular unit in the SERRS spectrum of a complex indicates the presence of at least one such unit in the structure of the complex. Consequently, the disappearance of the marker bands of Ru-dcbpy unit from the SERRS spectrum of a complex indicates the complete removal of this unit from the complex structure.
3.2. SERRS and SERS spectral probing and monitoring of surface reactions undergone by Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex in systems with modified Ag NPs

3.2.1. Probing and monitoring the reaction undergone by Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) in system with Ag NPs upon addition of chlorides: factor analysis of SERRS spectral set. 
SERRS spectra of Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (1 × 10−6 M)/NaCl (0–5 × 10−3 M) system were measured as a function of the increasing concentration of chlorides in the system at 445 nm excitation (details in Experimental, Sections 2.2.3 and 2.4). A series of 5 representative spectra (from the overall set of 11 spectra, Section 2.4) is shown in Fig. 2, spectra (a)–(e).
 Fig. 2  SERRS spectra of Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2dcbpy (1 × 10−6 M) systems measured at 445 nm excitation (a) in the absence of NaCl, and (b–e) in the presence of NaCl with the 5.0 × 10−5, 2.5 × 10−4, 6.3 × 10−4 and 5.0 × 10−3 M final concentrations of NaCl in the systems, respectively. 
The SERRS spectral evolution presented in Fig. 2 monitors the pronounced spectral changes observed within the set. In particular, the differences between the first and the last spectrum of the series are attributed to disappearance of markers of the Ru-dcbpy unit which are clearly observed in the former and absent in the latter spectrum. The first spectrum is thus fully consistent with the SERRS spectrum of the AgNP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) system (Fig. 1A and the first column of Table 1), while the last spectrum is a very good analogue of the SERRS spectrum of Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)3 system (Fig. 1C and the third column of Table 1).
The abovementioned set of 11 SERRS spectra has been subjected to factor analysis (FA, Section 2.5) which has provided the following results: The plot of singular values as a function of the subspectrum number in Fig. 3A (as well as the plot of residual errors as a function of the factor dimension in Fig. 3B) indicate that only the first two subspectra S1, S2 meaningfully contribute to the spectral set. These S1, S2 subspectra are shown in Fig. 3C. Each spectrum in the set can be reconstructed as a combination of S1 and S2 subspectra, and their relative contributions to each experimental spectrum are depicted in Fig. 3D.
 Fig. 3  FA of a set of SERRS spectra measured as a function of the final concentration of chlorides in Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2dcbpy (1 × 10−6 M)/NaCl (0–5 × 10−3 M) system: (A) singular values of individual subspectra contributing to the spectral set; (B) residual error values plotted as a function of factor dimension (C) physically meaningful subspectra S1,S2 (D) relative contributions of physically meaningful subspectra S1, S2 to each spectrum within the spectral set. 
The spectra of the two pure spectral components P1 and P2 have been obtained as linear combinations of S1 and S2 subspectra, and they are shown in Fig. 4A, spectra (I) and (II), respectively. The relative contributions of each of the two pure spectral components P1 and P2, respectively, to each experimental spectrum within the set, are depicted in Fig. 4B.
 Fig. 4  FA of a set of SERRS spectra measured as a function of the final concentration of chlorides in Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (1 × 10−6 M)/NaCl (0–5 × 10−3 M) system: (A) spectra of pure spectral components: I-P1 and II-P2 (B) percentual contribution of each of the pure spectral components to the individual spectra within the spectral set. 
The spectrum of the P1 pure component (Fig. 4A, spectrum I) is virtually identical with the SERRS spectrum of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) excited at 445 nm and shown in Fig. 1A. The spectrum of the P2 pure component (Fig. 4A, spectrum II) shows no marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy unit (Table 1, the 4th column), and it is analogous to SERRS spectrum of Ru(bpy)3 excited at 445 nm and presented in Fig. 1C and in Table 1, 3rd column.
In summary, the results of FA of the set of SERRS spectra measured as a function of the final concentration of chlorides in Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (1 × 10−6 M)/NaCl (0–5 × 10−3 M) system provide evidence that Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex in system with Ag NP hydrosol undergoes, upon irradiation by 445 nm excitation wavelength, a chemical transformation driven by addition of chlorides. The transformation results into a product, in which the presence of only the Ru-bpy unit(s) is detected.
As the next step, RRS spectra of Ru(bpy)2dcbpy complex in an aqueous solution prior and after addition of chlorides have been inspected (Fig. S5 in ESI†), and no spectral changes were found. This result provides evidence that the chemical transformation of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) induced by addition of chlorides is a surface reaction conditioned by the presence of Ag NPs.
Furthermore, detection of only the marker bands of the Ru-bpy unit in SERRS spectrum of the product of this surface reaction, together with the information that virtually the same marker bands of this unit are observed in the SERRS spectra of the Ru(II) complexes regardless the number of bpy ligands constituting their structure (provided in the preceding Section 3.1) indicate, that two possible reaction pathways and product structures have to be considered.
The first one is decarboxylation of the dcbpy ligand coordinated to Ru(II) yielding Ru(bpy)3 as the final product, the second one is replacement of the dcbpy ligand coordinated to Ru(II) by two Cl ligands, i.e. the ligand exchange reaction leading to formation of Ru(bpy)2Cl2.
Both types of reactions have their analogues in the previously reported studies of surface reactivity of transition metal complexes.19,32 In particular, decarboxylation of the dcbpy ligands in Ru(II)(dcbpy)2(SCN)2 complex has been reported and proposed to proceed by plasmon catalysis.32 Furthermore, adsorbed chlorides were shown to provide Cl ligands for the tpy/2Cl ligand exchange undergone by Zn(tpy)2 (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) complex dication on Ag NP surfaces.19
Concerning this second, ligand exchange reaction pathway for Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) chemisorbed on Ag NP surfaces, chlorides (or other ligands suitable for the ligand exchange) are, indeed, required as co-reactants. On the other hand, the relationship between the presence of chlorides and the progress of a decarboxylation reaction is, on the first sight, not obvious. Nevertheless, their presence can still be important for the reaction progress e.g. by creating suitable conditions for plasmon catalysis. Considering now a possible importance of chlorides for this first, i.e. the decarboxylation reaction pathway, we recollect their role in systems with Ag NPs (prepared by the same procedure as in this study) and the chemisorbed 2,2-bipyridine (bpy) established in our previously reported paper,28 namely their ability to induce Ag NPs fusion and generation of neutral (reduced) Ag(0) adsorption sites on Ag NPs surfaces. Comparison of the TEM images of Ag NPs/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) systems prior and after addition of chlorides (each presented in two different magnifications, Fig. 5A–D, respectively) demonstrates that the chlorides-induced Ag NPs fusion takes place in this system as well.

In addition to that, the presence of Ag(0) adsorption sites has been established also in the systems in which Ag NPs were grown by the chemical reduction (of AgNO3 by NaBH4) in the presence of an adsorbate (namely bpy), but in the absence of chlorides.28 On the basis of this knowledge, we have inspected the reactivity of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex in the system with the growing Ag NPs and in the absence of chlorides as a prospective strategy for distinguishing between the two reaction pathways. The results are reported in the subsequent Section 3.2.2.


3.2.2. Probing and evaluation of SERRS and SERS spectral changes undergone by Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) in system with growing Ag NPs in reducing ambient: evidence of decarboxylation of dcbpy ligand coordinated to Ru(II). 
Surface reactivity of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) has been explored in the system, in which an aqueous solution of AgNO3 was added dropwise to a mixed aqueous solution of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and NaBH4 (details in Section 2.2.5), i.e. under the conditions of Ag NPs growth driven by the chemical reduction and performed in the presence of Ru(bpy)2dcbpy complex as the potential reactant. UV/vis absorption spectrum of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaBH4/AgNO3 system measured 5 min after the addition of AgNO3 has been accomplished, is shown in Fig. 6A. Contribution of surface plasmon extinction (SPE) of Ag NPs to this spectrum as well as the TEM images of the grid-deposited samples in Fig. 6B, C and D indicate the presence of partially fused Ag NP aggregates (both smaller and larger in size) with a rather broad distribution of Ag NP sizes.

RRS spectrum of the initial Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaBH4 system (Fig. 7A) and the spectrum of the final Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaBH4/AgNO3 system measured 5 min after its preparation (Fig. 7B) were obtained at the same, namely 445 nm excitation. Comparison of the relative intensities of the spectral bands belonging to the complex with respect to those of the Raman bands assigned to the O–H stretching vibrations of water reveals a remarkable increase of the relative intensities of the Ru-(bpy) unit spectral bands in spectrum B with respect to those of both the Ru-dcbpy and Ru-bpy units in spectrum A. Both the disappearance of Ru-dcbpy unit marker bands (with exception of a shoulder at 1538 cm−1) and the remarkable intensity increase indicate that spectrum B is actually a SERRS spectrum of the product of a chemical transformation of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) complex chemisorbed on Ag NPs. The transformation manifests itself by the disappearance of a majority of the marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy unit.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of (A) RRS spectrum of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaBH4 system and of (B) SERRS spectrum of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaBH4/AgNO3 system at 445 nm excitation. 
Further time-evolution of the SERRS spectra of the reaction product has been followed at 445 nm excitation and on the time-scale of 5–27 min. The first and the last spectrum of this SERRS spectral set are shown in Fig. 8, spectra A and B, respectively. Their comparison demonstrates that the weak residual marker band of the Ru-dcbpy unit at 1538 cm−1 observed in spectrum A has almost disappeared in spectrum B, i.e. 22 min after the system evolution upon irradiation by 445 nm excitation during the sequential SERRS spectral measurements. Spectrum B thus contains entirely the marker bands of the Ru-bpy unit (Table 1, 5th column) and it is consistent with the SERRS spectrum of Ru(bpy)3 shown in Fig. 1C (and presented in 3rd column of Table 1). Importantly, spectrum B in Fig. 8 is also consistent with the SERRS spectrum of the Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)/NaCl (5 × 10−3 M) system (obtained at the same, i.e. 445 nm excitation) (Fig. 2, spectrum e and Table 1, 4th column), although no chlorides (or other ligands suitable for a ligand exchange) were present in the hydrosol system. On the basis of this result, the ligand exchange reaction pathway, in which chlorides would play the role of co-reactants, has been excluded.

The surface reaction of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) has thus been attributed to the decarboxylation of the Ru(II)-coordinated dcbpy ligand, yielding Ru(bpy)3 as the final product. Furthermore, the progress of this reaction appears to be conditioned by the presence of Ag(0) adsorption sites on Ag NPs surfaces, which has been previously established in both types of ambient28 in which this reaction has now been found to proceed (Section 3.2.1 and this section).
In the subsequent exploration of the mechanism of the decarboxylation reaction, we focused our attention on the role of the excitation and reaction initiation wavelengths. The 445 nm wavelength employed in the preceding experiments for initiation of the decarboxylation reaction and for its SERRS spectral probing and monitoring coincides with both the electronic absorption band of the Ru(bpy)2dcbpy complex (Fig. S1A, ESI†) and with the SPE band of the Ag NPs assembly (Fig. 6A). Consequently, both a photochemical and a plasmon-catalysed reaction could be initiated by this excitation wavelengths. By contrast, the 532 nm and 780 nm excitations do not coincide with the electronic absorption band of the complex, however, they fall into the broad SPE curve of Ag NPs assembly (Fig. 6A). Initiation of the decarboxylation reaction by these excitation wavelengths would thus exclude the photochemical origin of this reaction. The results of SERS spectral probing of the reaction progress at 532 nm excitation are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), together with the reference SERS spectra of Ru(bpy)2dcbpy and Ru(bpy)3 obtained at the same excitation (Fig. S6A and B, ESI†). On the basis of their mutual comparison, a partial decarboxylation of Ru(bpy)2dcbpy has been detected in the SERS spectrum of the Ru(bpy)2dcbpy/NaBH4/AgNO3 system (Fig. S6C, ESI†), and its complete decarboxylation in the SERS spectrum of the Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(bpy)2dcbpy/NaCl system (Fig. S6D, ESI†). In addition to that, a partial decarboxylation of the complex in the Ru(bpy)2dcbpy/NaBH4/AgNO3 system has been detected by the SERS spectral probing at 780 nm excitation (Fig. S7, ESI†). These results demonstrate that decarboxylation of Ru(bpy)2dcbpy is not a photochemical or surface-enhanced photochemical reaction. On the other hand, the results indicate a possibility of plasmon catalysis.

3.3. SERRS spectral probing and monitoring of surface reactions undergone by Ru(dcbpy)3 complex in systems with modified Ag NPs
Ru(dcbpy)3 complex (Fig. 1B, inset) possesses six carboxylate groups in its structure. For a complete dissolution of this complex in water, NaOH solution has to be added. The addition of NaOH could possibly have a negative effect on the progress of a decarboxylation reaction. Furthermore, a complete decarboxylation of this complex requires removal of all six carboxylate groups, while all of them could hardly be chemisorbed on an Ag NP surface even in strongly aggregated and/or fused Ag NPs systems. These factors have to be taken into account upon the exploration of decarboxylation of this complex in the same systems and under the same conditions employed in the preceding Section 3.2 for Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy). On the other hand, since Ru(dcbpy)3 does not contain a Ru-bpy unit, detection of the marker bands of this unit in the SERRS and/or SERS spectra of the complex clearly indicates the decarboxylation reaction progress.

3.3.1. SERRS spectral evidence of a partial decarboxylation of Ru(dcbpy)3 in systems with Ag NPs upon addition of chlorides. 
SERRS spectra of Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3 (1 × 10−5 M) system, Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3 (1 × 10−5 M)/NaCl (2.5 × 10−2 M) system, and Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3 (1 × 10−5 M)/NaCl/(2.5 × 10−2 M)/HCl (1 × 10−2 M) system are mutually compared in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and UV/vis spectra depicting SPE of Ag NPs in the same systems are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).
Small, but detectable changes in the SERRS spectrum of Ag NP hydrosol/Ru(dcbpy)3, namely the disappearance of the 700 cm−1 marker band of the Ru-dcbpy unit have been observed upon addition of NaCl (Fig. S8, ESI,† spectrum B). These changes became more pronounced after the subsequent addition of HCl, and the spectrum C represents a mixture of marker bands of Ru-dcbpy (e.g. the 1477 and 1616 cm−1 bands) and Ru-bpy units (e.g. the 1273, 1318, and 1551 cm−1 bands). This observation indicates that at least a partial decarboxylation of the complex has been accomplished under these conditions. In particular, the addition of HCl (i.e. acidification of the system) was shown to have a positive effect on the decarboxylation reaction which, in turn, indicates a pH sensitivity of the reaction progress.


3.3.2. SERRS spectral evidence of a complete decarboxylation of Ru (dcbpy)3 in system with growing Ag NPs in reducing ambient upon efficient irradiation. 
Surface reactivity of Ru(dcbpy)3 has further been explored in the system, in which an aqueous solution of AgNO3 was added dropwise to a mixed aqueous solution of Ru (dcbpy)3 and NaBH4, i.e. under the conditions of Ag NPs growth driven by the chemical reduction and performed in the presence of Ru(dcbpy)3 complex as the potential reactant. The reaction conditions were thus analogous to those employed for Ru(bpy)2dcbpy in Section 3.2.2, with an exception of the presence of NaOH required for dissolution of Ru(dcbpy)3 in water.
UV/vis absorption spectrum of Ru(dcbpy)3/NaBH4/AgNO3 system measured 5 min after the addition of AgNO3 has been accomplished, is shown in Fig. 9, and depicts the SPE of Ag NPs in the system. In contrast to SPE of the analogous system with Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (Fig. 6A), SPE spectrum of Ru(dcbpy)3/NaBH4/AgNO3 system (Fig. 9) is constituted by a narrow band with max. at 390 nm which indicates the presence of non-aggregated, small Ag NPs (ca. 3–25 nm in size).34,35
 Fig. 9  UV/vis absorption spectrum of Ru(dcbpy)3/NaBH4/AgNO3 system measured 5 min after addition of AgNO3 and depicting SPE of Ag NPs in the system. 
SERRS spectra of Ru(dcbpy)3/NaBH4/AgNO3 system measured at 445 nm excitation 5 min after addition of AgNO3 and after 2.5 min of irradiation by 445 nm line in a 1 cm path and/or in a 0.2 cm path cuvette, respectively, are compared in Fig. 10, spectra A and B, respectively. The SERRS spectrum A obtained from the measurement with a 1 cm path cuvette represents a mixture of Ru-dcbpy and Ru-bpy marker bands, in which, however, the marker band of the Ru-dcbpy unit as the characteristics of the unperturbed complex (presented in Fig. 1B and Table 1, 2nd column) still prevail. In contrast to that, entirely the marker bands of Ru-bpy unit have been detected in spectrum B measured in the 0.2 cm path cuvette (Table 1, 6th column), indicating thus a complete decarboxylation of Ru(dcbpy)3 complex in the system with non-aggregated, small Ag NPs upon its efficient irradiation with the 445 nm laser excitation wavelength, and in the presence of Ag(0) adsorption sites on the surfaces of these NPs. This result also indicates that aggregation of Ag NPs and generation of “hot spots” is not required for the decarboxylation reaction progress.

3.4. Evaluation of conditions and proposed mechanism of plasmon-catalyzed decarboxylation of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes in systems with Ag NPs
Systematic exploration of surface reactions undergone by Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes in systems with Ag NPs was initiated by establishing that reaction of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) with chlorides in systems with AgNPs yields a product in which only markers of the Ru-bpy unit were detected by SERRS (Section 3.2.1). Of the two reaction pathways proposed, i.e. the decarboxylation of the dcbpy ligand, or the dcbpy/2Cl ligand exchange, the former one has been established by generation of the same product, i.e. Ru(bpy)3, in the absence of chlorides, namely in systems with Ag NPs grown in the presence Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy). The decarboxylation reaction pathway has been reconfirmed by observation of the markers of a newly formed Ru-bpy unit in SERRS spectra of Ru(dcbpy)3 complex under the same above-mentioned reaction conditions (Sections 3.2.2 and 3.3.2).
Furthermore, the absence of any reactivity of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) in an aqueous solution, i.e. in the absence of Ag NPs, but in the presence of chlorides or NaBH4 (as the reductant in Ag NPs growth) demonstrated that the decarboxylation reactions are the surface reactions conditioned by the presence of Ag NPs (Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2).
In addition to that, a pronounced dependence of the efficiency of the reaction progress on the intensity of irradiation demonstrated particularly for the Ru(dcbpy)3 complex in the system with the growing Ag NPs indicates that the decarboxylation reaction is a light-induced process (Section 3.3.2). Two types of light-induced reactions are known to proceed for species localized on Ag NPs surfaces: plasmon-catalyzed reactions and surface-enhanced photochemical reactions.6 Surface-enhanced photochemistry requires an overlap between the electronic absorption band of a reactant and the wavelength of irradiation.33 Therefore, the initiation and progress of the decarboxylation reaction of Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) in Ru(bpy)2dcbpy/NaBH4/AgNO3 and Ru(bpy)2dcbpy/NaCl systems upon irradiation by 532 nm and/or 780 nm excitation wavelengths which do not coincide with the electronic absorption band of the complex (with max. at 455 nm) provides evidence that the decarboxylation reaction is not of a photochemical origin and most probably proceeds by plasmon catalysis (Section 3.2.2).
For plasmon-catalyzed chemical transformations, three mechanisms are currently established: (i) catalysis by charge carriers, i.e. by hot electrons (e−) and hot holes (h+); (ii) catalysis by a production of heat, and (iii) catalysis by a direct transfer of energy across the plasmonic NS-adsorbed reactant interface.1–13,36–39 The former two mechanisms (i) and (ii) are initiated by absorption of radiation by plasmonic NS, such as Ag NPs, followed by the excited localized surface plasmon (LSP) relaxation by a non-radiative process. These two mechanisms (i) and (ii) mutually differ by the time-scale of their operation in fs and ps, respectively.36,37 For both of them, their operation is governed by the absorption contribution to the plasmonic NPs extinction.1–13 On the other hand, operation of the last mentioned mechanism (iii) is governed by resonance Mie scattering contribution to the plasmonic NPs extinction, i.e. by the very fast radiative process.10 When considering the most probable mechanism of the plasmon-catalyzed decarboxylation undergone by the complexes containing the Ru-dcbpy unit(s), we recollect that the decarboxylation reaction of Ru(dcbpy)3 proceeds efficiently also in systems with non-aggregated small (<25 nm in size) Ag NPs (Section 3.3.2). SPE of such NPs is governed by the absorption contribution.35 This result thus indicates that the decarboxylation reaction most probably proceeds by one of the two mechanisms based on the absorption of radiation by Ag NPs, i.e. either (i) by the formation of hot charge carriers, or (ii) by the production of heat caused by the hot charge carriers recombination.
It has been shown previously that decarboxylation reactions of aromatic carboxylic acids can be driven by heat at temperatures ∼250 °C.40 On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the temperatures rise achieved in plasmon-catalysis by heat is less than 100 K.9 The temperatures lower than ca 125 °C will thus be insufficient for catalysis of decarboxylation reactions by heat. Therefore, plasmon catalysis by charge carriers, i.e. by hot electrons (e−) and hot holes (h+), emerges as the most probable mechanism of plasmon-catalyzed decarboxylation of the Ru-dcbpy unit(s) in Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes.
Plasmon catalysis by charge carriers has been found to induce an efficient decomposition of formic acid on Pd nanosheets involving a C–H bond breaking and yielding CO2 and H2 as reaction products.38 Plasmon catalysis by charge carriers has also been established as the most probable mechanism of decarboxylation of mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) molecules acting as molecular linkers (bridges) between Au surface and Au NPs, i.e. upon chemisorption of MBA molecules to Au NPs by carboxylate groups.39 The role of hot h+ was attributed to interaction with the coordinated COO− groups leading to the C–C bond breaking by radical mechanism and the subsequent release of CO2. Hot e− were proposed to interact with H+ and create H-radicals that attach themselves to terminal C radicals formed by the C–C bond breaking.39 In our experiments, the role of H+ (or H3O+) ions as co-reactants is supported by the positive effect of acidification of Ag NPs/Ru(dcbpy)3/NaCl system (by addition of HCl) on the progress of the decarboxylation reaction (Section 3.3.1). It is thus highly probable that decarboxylation of the dcbpy ligands coordinated to Ru(II) proceeds by the same reaction pathway as that outlined for MBA.39
In particular, the reaction is described by the following equation:(bpy)2-Ru(II)-bpy-(COO−)2 + 2hot h+ + 2H+ + 2hot e− → Ru(II)(bpy)3 + 2CO2
Concerning our experiments, i.e. decarboxylation of the Ru-dcbpy unit(s) in Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes, an important question remains to be answered: why this reaction does not proceed in the pre-prepared Ag NPs/complex system, and why either addition of chlorides, or the presence of the complex in the system with the reduction-driven Ag NPs growth, is required for its progress? Towards this goal, we have considered that the common role of addition of chlorides into the Ag NPs/complex systems and of the reducing ambient under the conditions of Ag NP growth in the presence of the complex is the generation of Ag(0) adsorption sites on Ag NPs surfaces. Generation of Ag(0) adsorption sites under these conditions has been established in our previously published paper by using bpy as the spectral probe.28 We propose that the crucial role of Ag(0) adsorption sites in the decarboxylation reactions undergone by the complexes and catalyzed by the charge carriers is the creation of an appropriate interface for the interfacial transfer of hot e− to H+ ions. In particular, we reason that provided that only oxidized Ag+ adsorption sites were present on Ag NPs surfaces, hot e− would be used primarily for reduction of these adsorption sites by reaction:Ag+ sites + hot e− → Ag(0) sitesand could not thus reach the H+ ions as the co-reactants in the plasmon-catalyzed decarboxylation reaction.
This argument, in conjunction with the previously established presence of only the oxidized Ag+ adsorption sites on the surfaces of the pre-prepared Ag NPs28 employed for Ag NPs/complex systems preparation, also satisfactorily explains the observation that no decarboxylation reactions proceed in such systems.
4. Conclusions
Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes were found to undergo a light-induced decarboxylation reaction of their Ru-dcbpy unit(s) on Ag NPs surfaces in the hydrosol systems with Ag NPs modified by adsorption of chlorides and in the systems with the chemical reduction-driven Ag NPs growth. In particular, Ru(bpy)3 has been identified as the final product of a complete decarboxylation of Ru(bpy)2dcbpy. Furthermore, a clear evidence of decarboxylation of one (or more) Ru-dcbpy unit of Ru(dcbpy)3 complex has been provided by observation of the SERRS spectral marker bands of the Ru-bpy unit. In both the abovementioned systems, the oxidized Ag+ adsorption sites coexist with the neutral Ag(0) adsorption sites on Ag NPs surfaces. By contrast, the same complexes showed no light-induced surface reactivity in the pre-prepared Ag NP hydrosol/complex systems, in which only Ag+ adsorption sites are available.
The established distinct differences between the wavenumber positions of SERRS spectral marker bands of the Ru-dcbpy and Ru-bpy units, respectively, enabled us to employ SERRS spectroscopy as the optimal tool for monitoring the reaction progress and its subsequent treatment by factor analysis (FA). Furthermore, the conditions under which the decarboxylation reactions proceed were established by SERRS, SERS and UV/vis absorption spectral probing.
The dependence of the reaction progress on the reaction initiation wavelength and its relation to the electronic absorption spectra of the complexes and to the surface plasmon extinction (SPE) spectra of Ag NPs in the systems indicated plasmon-catalysis by charge carriers and/or by heat as the possible mechanisms of the decarboxylation reactions. The conditions of the decarboxylation reactions initiation by heat specified on the basis of the previously reported data were found inconsistent with plasmon-catalysis by heat. Consequently, plasmon-catalysis by charge carriers was established as the most probable mechanism of the decarboxylation reactions undergone by Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) and Ru(dcbpy)3 complexes. In particular, hot holes (h+) are proposed to be responsible for C–C bond breaking and CO2 formation, and hot electrons (e−) for reduction of H+ ions and C–H bond formation. Finally, the presence of Ag(0) adsorption sites is considered to be necessary for a successful interfacial transport of hot e− to H+ cations.
In more general terms, purposeful generation of neutral Ag(0) adsorption sites on the surfaces of Ag NPs in hydrosol systems with prospective reactant(s) is expected to create appropriate conditions for triggering various chemical transformations plasmon-catalyzed by the charge-carrier mechanism.
