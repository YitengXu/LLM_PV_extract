    , Accepted 22nd May 2015First published on 25th May 2015AbstractThree new metal-free organic sensitizers with a D–A–π–A configuration based on a triarylamine donor, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) and different π units have been synthesized. Because a long alkyl side chain has been attached to the thiophene adjacent to BDT, HECA achieves the best performance. Under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions, the HECA based-device gives the best conversion efficiency of 9.13% with a Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 0.77. Although EDCA displays superior optical properties, it does not give the desired results. The device based on EDCA achieves efficiency of 7.37% with a Jsc of 15.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V and a FF of 0.70. EIS analysis confirms the existence of fast recombination in the EDCA system. Further computational analysis indicates that the coplanarity and the very strong affinity to iodine molecules of EDCA may be the origin of the low performance.
Introduction
Recently, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention as an ideal alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices due to their potentially low cost, easy device fabrication, and relatively high efficiency.1 Although ruthenium (Ru) complexes still stand out as efficient and stable sensitizers,2 these dyes have some disadvantages such as high cost, use of noble metals and difficulties in synthesis and purification which limit their wide application. Recently the highest efficiency of DSSCs has reached 13% using a porphyrin-based D–A sensitizer reported by Michael Grätzel.3 Besides those dyes, several dipolar metal-free dyes have been reported in recent years, including those based on indoline,4 coumarin,5 and triarylamine.6 The organic sensitizers show molecular tuning flexibility resulting from various π-conjugated bridge components and the D–π–A configuration ensuring sufficient light absorption and effective photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer. One successful strategy to improve the performance of DSSCs is varying the components such as the donor, bridge and acceptor. Triarylamine has been widely used in opto- and electro-active materials for its good electron donating and transporting capability, as well as its special starburst molecular structure. In addition, the nonplanar property of triphenylamine is favourable for disrupting dye aggregation, which has an adverse impact on the performance by decreasing the electron injection efficiency and inducing unfavourable charge recombination between the injected electrons and oxidized dye. Recently, chemical modification of triphenylamine units has been employed to further fine-tune the physical and optical properties of sensitizers.7 Attachment of an alkoxyl chain to triphenylamine units is reported to reinforce electron delocalization and enhance the absorption of sensitizers, yielding improved photocurrent and device efficiency. Previously, our group reported a highly efficient dye incorporating an auxiliary acceptor 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). The additional electron acceptor significantly increased the molar extinction coefficient as well as Jsc and red-shifted the absorption, resulting in efficiency of 9.02%.8 Previous research reported that iodide could bind to electron-rich atoms such as the sulphur atom in the thiophene ring, facilitating electron recombination.9 Thus a long alkyl side chain blocking the approach of iodide to the titanium dioxide could be introduced to suppress this recombination. The long alkyl chain can also increase the solubility of the dye as well as disrupt the π aggregation. In this regard, we incorporate a 3-hexyl-thiophene unit into the π link to construct the dye HECA. EDOT (3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene) is generally used in polymer cells for the excellent mobility and high stability in the oxidized state originating from the stronger electron donating ability of the O atom. EDOT is also widely used in DSSCs.6s–u The strong electron donating ability red shifts the absorption band and increases the molar extinction coefficient, which can improve the photocurrent density. A previous reference reported the existence of interaction between the hydrogen atom and an electron-deficient group such as BTD and weak interaction between S and O atoms,10 finally resulting in high planarity and delocalization of electrons which further facilitated charge transfer from the donor to acceptor. Hence we incorporate an EDOT unit into the bridge to construct the dye EDCA. Based on previous research, we vary the π bridge with different conjugate blocks and investigate the impact of these changes on absorption, energy levels, and photovoltaic performance. The structures of the three dyes are shown in Scheme 1.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis procedures of the three dyes are shown in the ESI.† We failed to obtain compound 4via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction and hence the Stille reaction was adopted because the activity of the boronic acid derivative of EDOT was inferior to that of the corresponding trialkylstannyl derivative of EDOT. All the intermediates of bromination were used in further steps without purification due to the similar polarities. We did not obtain the desired terminal product via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine in THF solution. So we replaced piperidine with a buffer solution of acetic acid and ammonium acetate to yield the terminal product. Purification of the intermediate was performed by flash column chromatography. All final products were characterized by standard spectroscopic methods including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS.
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. 1 and the data are listed in Table 1. Generally, the organic dyes showed two main absorption bands: intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption and π–π* absorption bands.11 The absorption bands in the UV region for THCA and HECA originated from the local π–π* transition and their peaks were located at 383 nm and 333 nm, respectively. THCA and HECA showed the maximum absorption wavelength at 531 nm and 526 nm, respectively. The corresponding molar extinction coefficient was 23000 and 36000 M−1 cm−1 which could be ascribed to ICT. Obviously, incorporation of the 3-hexyl-thiophene unit significantly increased the molar extinction coefficient. However, a slight blue shift of the absorption band was observed which could be attributed to the hexyl chain adjacent to the thiophene unit that increased the dihedral angle and disrupted the planarity. This phenomenon was consistent with previous reported results.4d We further substituted the hexyl thiophene unit with a stronger donor (EDOT) to construct the dye EDCA, which showed λmax at 553 nm as well as a molar extinction coefficient of 54000 M−1 cm−1 and yielded a broad spectral response. Relative to THCA, improvement in the molar extinction coefficient for EDCA and HECA was 31000 and 18000, respectively, and the red shift of the absorption band of EDCA was 22 nm upon introduction of the EDOT unit. Considering the superior optical properties, we expect to obtain high Jsc for EDCA and HECA.

The absorption spectra of the dyes on transparent films are shown in Fig. 2, in which the maximum absorption peaks are located at 504, 501, and 535 nm, respectively. Compared to the absorption spectra in solution, almost identical blue shifts for all the three dyes were observed which could be ascribed to the deprotonation of the –COOH group binding to TiO2.

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out to determine the redox properties of the dyes. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S1,†THCA and HECA exhibited almost the same HOMO level, which was more positive than that of the electrolyte mediator, indicating that the oxidized dye could be regenerated effectively by I−/I3−. After the introduction of the EDOT unit, EDCA showed a positive shift of the HOMO corresponding to a value of 0.07 V. E0–0 values of the dyes were estimated from wavelengths at 10% maximum absorption intensity in CH2Cl2 with values of 2.02 eV, 1.90 eV, and 2.00 eV, respectively. The decrease of the bandgap for EDCA was consistent with the increase of the electron-donating ability of EDOT and the red shift of the absorption spectra. The LUMO was estimated to be −1.20 V, −1.19 V and −1.15 V versus NHE, respectively, indicating a sufficient driving force for electron injection from the oxidized dye into the conduction band.
The device was optimized using 0.01 M CDCA as a co-adsorption additive, which could significantly improve the efficiency resulting from the suppression of fast recombination. The photocurrent density–voltage curves of the cells were measured under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM 1.5 sunlight. CDCA (0.01 M) was used as the co-adsorption additive to construct the cells based on the three dyes. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, DSSC based on the dye THCA displayed a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 14.31 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V and a fill factor of 70%, resulting in power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.09%. After introducing the EDOT unit, a slight increase of Jsc was observed compared to the dye THCA. The EDCA-based cell showed a Jsc of 15.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V and a FF of 70%, giving power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.37%. This improvement was ascribed to the increase of the molar extinction coefficient and red shift of the absorption band extending to 750 nm. However, this increase was not proportionate to the improvement in the optical properties for EDCA relative to THCA. A decrease of voltage by about 40 mV was observed. Considering that molecular planarity will facilitate dye aggregation, resulting in low Voc and Jsc, we speculated that this discrepancy primarily originated from the recombination caused by aggregation which was partially confirmed by the fact that EDCA did not give a clear signal in the various tested solvents. After addition of trimethylamine or tetrabutyl tin chloride, a perfect H NMR signal was observed which might be possibly ascribed to the disruption of aggregation caused by the additive.6d It is known that electron-deficient halogen atoms such as iodine can form complexes with other electron-rich atoms through a non-covalent interaction, i.e., halogen bonding.9a–d The adverse role of the possible halogen bonding in interfacial charge recombination in DSSCs had been proposed by several groups.9b,c The details would be discussed in the Computational Studies section. IPCE of EDCA reached 70% from 450 to 650 nm as shown in Fig. 4. However, we found that substitution of the EDOT unit with the 3-hexyl-thiophene group featuring a long alkyl side chain had a positive impact on the performance. The cell based on HECA showed a Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 77%, giving the best η of 9.11%. Incorporation of a large donor group could block the approach of the electrolyte mediator to the titanium dioxide which finally retarded fast recombination;7 we attribute the improvement in all parameters to the double blocking effect originating from the long hexyloxy chains of the donor and the hexyl side chain attached to the thiophene which restricted recombination as shown in Scheme 2. Despite displaying inferior optical properties relative to EDCA, HECA achieved 28.6% improvement in efficiency. This phenomenon inspired us to investigate the root of this huge discrepancy.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
To get insight into the reason for the very low open circuit voltage of EDCA which was ascribed to fast electron recombination, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.12 The Nyquist plot and Bode plot are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The radius of the large semicircle increased in the order of EDCA < THCA < HECA, indicating that electron recombination resistance decreased in the order of HECA > THCA > EDCA which was consistent with the variation of Voc. In the Bode phase plot, the peak of the middle frequency correlated with the electron lifetime. The low frequency corresponding to the long electron lifetime reflected slow recombination. The lifetime decreased in the order of HECA > THCA > EDCA. This result was also consistent with the increase of Voc. The combination resistance and electron lifetime could also explain the low Voc of EDCA relative to THCA and HECA. This shows that an auxiliary donor with a long side chain can be chosen to constraint electron recombination.

Computation studies
We examined several different conformations of the sensitizers by rotating the C–C single bonds connecting the aromatic rings, and the most stable geometries are shown in Fig. 7. The weak hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stabilization of the conformations are also indicated. We can see that the hydrogen–nitrogen distance between the triphenylamine donor and the benzothiadiazole acceptor is around 2.4 Å, while the nitrogen–hydrogen distance between benzothiadiazole and the adjacent thiophene ring is slightly shorter, around 2.3 Å. It is noteworthy that the EDOT unit in the EDCA compound has no hydrogen atom and thus cannot form hydrogen bonds with the benzothiadiazole nitrogen atoms. However, the oxygen atom of EDOT can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, forming a hydrogen bond with the benzothiadiazole hydrogen atom. As shown in Fig. 7, the hydrogen–oxygen distance is 2.156 Å, much shorter than the other hydrogen bonds identified in these three compounds. The weak hydrogen bonds also contribute to the co-planarity of the aromatic rings. As shown in Table 3, the dihedral angle between triphenylamine and benzothiadiazole is around 30°, while that between benzothiadiazole and thiophene is much smaller, around 3°. The dihedral angle γ is 15.9° in HECA owing to the steric hindrance of the long alkyl chain, while in EDCA the dihedral angle γ is 0.6°, rendering the high co-planarity of the aromatic rings in EDCA. The complexes formed by the sensitizer dyes and iodine molecules were also investigated. The geometries of the complexes and the binding free energies are shown in Table 4. In all the three compounds, the most favorable binding site is the benzothiadiazole sulfur atom. In HECA and EDCA, an additional binding site was found at the thiophene ring adjacent to benzothiadiazole. Particularly, EDCA has a third binding site, that is, the oxygen atom in the EDOT unit, rendering the strong affinity between EDCA and iodine molecules. Therefore, the EDCA compound has the most co-planar geometry and the strongest affinity to iodine molecules which may play a synergistic role in inducing fast electron recombination, finally decreasing both the Jsc and Voc.

Conclusions
In summary, three new dyes based on benzothiadiazole and different π conjugation bridges were successfully synthesized. The results showed that the open circuit voltage (Voc) could be improved by incorporating an axial long alkyl chain into the bridge unit, which proved to be an effective strategy to reduce the π–π aggregation of the dyes on TiO2 films and suppress charge recombination. Theoretical analysis indicates the affinity of EDCA to iodine molecules which favours the formation of a dye–I2 complex leading to fast interfacial charge recombination. Among the three dyes, the HECA-based DSSC with 3-hexylthiophene as the building block shows the highest overall conversion efficiency of 9.11%, with a Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 0.77. This result inspires us to select the appropriate π conjugation bridges to further improve the performance.
Experimental section
Measurement and characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer and mass spectra were obtained on a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dyes in solution and on dye-soaked films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms of dyes were obtained from a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) with the conventional three electrode configuration comprising of a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a regular calomel reference electrode in saturated KCl solution. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAPF6 in CH2Cl2. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene and all the potential data in this paper are presented relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The spectra were scanned in the frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz with the applied potential set at the open circuit of the corresponding DSSC and the alternate current amplitude was set at 10 mV. The current–density voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured by recording J–V curves using a Keithley 2400 source meter under an illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light (Newport-91160 equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp and an AM 1.5G filter). The incident light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard silicon solar cell (Newport 91150V). Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Newport-71640).
Materials
All reagents that we have used in the experiments were obtained from J&K Chemical Co. and Aladdin Chemical Co., and were used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were disposed by primary procedures. The starting material (1) was synthesized according to the previous literature.6d FTO conducting glass (F-doped SnO, transmission >90% in the visible region, sheet resistance 15 Ω square−1, Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd, China) was handled with a detergent, redistilled water, ethanol, chloroform and acetone successively under an ultrasound cleaner for 30 min each before use.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The thin TiO2 films (12 μm) consisting of a transparent layer (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) and a 4 μm scattering layer (Ti-Nanoxide 300) were coated on a well-cleaned FTO conducting glass using a screen printing technique, followed by calcination at 500 °C under an air flow in a muffle for 30 min. When cooling down to the room temperature, the obtained films were immersed in 0.05 M aqueous TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 75 °C, washed with redistilled water and anhydrous ethanol consecutively, then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After the obtained films were cooled down and immersed into the dye solution (0.1 M in the required solvents) for 12 h, the dyes were deposited on the film. Then the working electrodes were rinsed with chloroform and anhydrous ethanol, respectively. ∼100 nm thick Pt was deposited on the conductive surface of the Pt-counter electrodes and two holes (0.8 mm diameter) were drilled into the Pt-counter electrodes. A sandwich type solar cell was assembled with the working and Pt-counter electrodes and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness. The electrolyte was injected into the cell from the holes and the fabrication of the solar cells was finally completed by sealing the holes using a UV-melt gum. The composition of the electrolytes was 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in acetonitrile as a liquid electrolyte.
Synthesis

4-(7-Bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-N,N-bis(4(hexyloxy)-phenyl)-aniline (2). 
Compound 1 (600 mg, 1.14 mmol) was dissolved in new distilled THF solution and cooled down to −78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, then n-BuLi (1.72 mmol, 1.5 eq., 0.715 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture. After stirring for 1 h at the same temperature, isopropyl borate (1.72 mmol, 0.4 mL) was slowly injected into the reaction solution. After stirring for further 2 h, the solution was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The crude mixture was used without further purification. 4,7-Dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1.326 g, 4.56 mmol, 4 eq.), catalytic amount of Pd(dffp)Cl2, K2CO3 (1.38 g, 10 mmol) and a solution of THF (25 mL) and H2O (5 mL) were added into the previous mixture. The mixture was further refluxed overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the reaction was completed, CH2Cl2 (20 mL) was added and the organic layer was separated, then the aqueous solution was washed with CH2Cl2 two times. The organic solution was collected. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by chromatography to afford the desired compound 2 (578 mg, 77%). 1HNMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), 7.88 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.74 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.51 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.15–7.09 (m, 4H), 7.02 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 6.85 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 4H), 3.94 (t, J = 6.5 Hz, 4H), 1.83–1.74 (m, 4H), 1.51–1.41 (m, 4H), 1.38–1.34 (m, 8H), 0.91 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H).

In a 10 mL round-bottom flask was added compound 3 (38 mg, 0.055 mmol), 5 mL acetic acid, 100 mg ammonium acetate and excess cyanoacetic acid and the mixture was reacted overnight under 80 °C. After the reaction was complete, CH2Cl2 (20 mL) was added and the organic layer was separated, then the aqueous solution was washed with CH2Cl2 two times. The organic solution was collected. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by chromatography to afford the desired compound (THCA) (22 mg, 53%). 1HNMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), 8.29–8.18 (m, 2H), 7.89 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H), 7.85 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.09 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 4H), 6.94 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 4H), 6.87 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 3.94 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 4H), 1.76–1.64 (m, 4H), 1.46–1.37 (m, 4H), 1.31 (m, 8H), 0.88 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H).

2,3-Dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine (5 g, 35.16 mmol, 3.73 mL) was dissolved in new distilled 10 mL THF and cooled down to −78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, then n-BuLi (38.6 mmol, 15.5 mL, 1.1 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture. After stirring for 1 h at the same temperature, tri-n-butyltin chloride (10.47 mL, 38.6 mmol, 1.1 eq.) was slowly injected into the reaction solution.
