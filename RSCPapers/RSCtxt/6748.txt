    , Accepted 23rd November 2020First published on 23rd November 2020AbstractA Yb3+ free self-sensitized Er2WO6 phosphor has been synthesized via a solid-state reaction method. The phosphor material, Er2WO6, has a monoclinic crystal structure with space group P2/c (13). The deconvoluted high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra of all the core elements in the Er2WO6 phosphor material were explored. The highly resolved absorption peaks in the ultra-violet, visible and near-infra-red (NIR) regions of the diffuse reflectance spectrum were due to the Stark-splitting of the 4f energy levels of the Er3+ ions. Under 980 nm NIR laser excitation, the Er2WO6 phosphor showed an intense up-converted red emission at 677 nm due to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ions. The cross-relaxation and resonance energy transfer process involved in the key intermediate 4F3/2 and 4F5/2 levels of the Er3+ and their role in generating red emissions were investigated. The laser pump power versus upconversion intensity plot showed a slope with an n value <1 and the possible reasons behind this behavior were investigated. The photoluminescence properties of the Er2WO6 phosphor in the visible and NIR region were further analyzed. The potential application of the phosphor as a marker in latent fingerprint detection was also evaluated.
1. Introduction
Upconversion (UC) phosphor materials have been the concern of researchers since 1966 and a lot of attention has been given to investigate this after the discovery of near infra-red (NIR) to visible UC of light in rare-earth ions incorporated in glasses discovered by Auzel.1–4 UC phosphor materials activated with lanthanide ions have been widely used because of their prospective applications in bio-imaging, fingerprint detection in forensic science, optical thermometry, solar cells, bioassays, and photodynamic therapy.5–9 Among the lanthanide ions, Er3+ has an electronic configuration of [Xe] 4f11 with the 4I15/2 level as its ground state10 and its luminescence properties have comprehensively been studied. Activator Er3+ ions show high quality red/green UC luminescence and are efficiently pumped by NIR radiation. In general, Yb3+ ions have been used as a sensitizer that transfers the NIR energy to the activators in the UC emission process.10 Addition of Yb3+ ions stimulate the activators to higher excited levels, which lead to emission of photons with ultraviolet, visible or NIR wavelengths.11,12 However, Yb3+ ions have shortcomings which lack the absorption of light in the visible region13 and limit the phosphor to be used in the multi-functional applications. Also, due to the narrow band absorption characteristics of the Yb3+ ion when used as a sensitizer for the UC process, it levies challenges to the biological applications.11,12 Yb3+ has a single excited state (2F5/2), which results in the absorption band found at around 980 nm (2F7/2 → 2F5/2). This band coincides with the strong absorption of water which is the most concentrated and important NIR absorber.14 The primary constituent of latent fingerprints is sweat, which consists of almost water (>98%).15 Since the sweat consists of 98% water, a Yb3+ free phosphor is highly advantageous. Herein we demonstrated a possible way to generate intense UC emission without using Yb3+ that could be better suited for latent-finger print applications.
Tungstate based metallic functional materials are of much interest to the research community because of their possible applications in science and technology. As self-activated luminescent phosphors, tungstate materials are commonly suitable for up/down conversion and NIR emission processes due to their excellent chemical, optical, and thermal stability.9,16 For example, Huang et al.17 synthesized green-emitting Yb3+/Er3+ doped AWO4 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) phosphors and investigated their UC luminescence characteristics. Zhang et al.18 reported Yb3+ doped Lu2WO6 and its NIR emission properties and energy transfer mechanism. Up and down conversion properties of Sm3+ and Yb3+/Er3+ activated NaY(WO4)2 nano phosphors were also studied.19 Tungstate based inorganic phosphors are also identified as a promising applicant for X-ray imaging, bio-imaging, field emission displays and white light-emitting diodes, etc.20,21 Further, lanthanide ions activated tungstate phosphors could also be explored as marking agents for the detection of latent fingerprints, which is one of the most important techniques of physical identification in the forensic science. The important properties such as high chemical stability, bright luminescence in the visible region, high quantum efficiency, hydrophilic contact with the fingerprint residual components, high contrast bifurcation of ridge patterns and non-toxic make a phosphor material ideal for fingerprinting detection.15
The order n of the UC process is the slope of the luminescence intensity versus laser pump power, i.e. the number of photons required to excite the emitting state of the phosphor is directly proportional to a certain power of the excitation source intensity, which is usually ∼2 for the UC processes. However, due to the conservation of energy, nonlinear processes, such as the UC process, involving energy transfer across multiple quantum states cannot maintain its nonlinearity up to infinite excitation energy. Pollnau et al. describe that for a pump power P, when an UC phosphor is excited by n photons, its emission intensity can vary from Pn for infinitely small UC processes, or can come down to P1 for the upper states or can be less than P1 for intermediate states that are limited by infinitely large UC processes.22 The lower limit for the population of the intermediate states is a function of the energy transfer upconversion (ETU) or excited state absorption (ESA) during the excitation process and also depends on whether de-excitation takes place radiatively to the ground state or through relaxation to the next lower lying state.
Here, a Yb3+ free multi-functional Er2WO6 phosphor, synthesized using a solid-state reaction method is explored. Investigations of its UC luminescence process and its corresponding excitation pump power dependence revealed an interesting non-linear dependence with a power n value less than 1. The reasons behind this behaviour are discussed. While there are not many reports on such similar phenomenon, Pollnau et al. did conduct some preliminary investigations on Er3+ and Nd3+-doped halide phosphors and their results are compared to the results obtained in this study to show that it is indeed possible to obtain UC luminescence with n < 1. The photoluminescence and the down-conversion NIR emission properties of the monoclinic phased Er2WO6 phosphors are also investigated comprehensively and its application as a latent fingerprint marker is tested. The electron binding energies of the elements present in the Er2WO6 phosphors are also explored.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Synthesis of Er2WO6 phosphor material
Monoclinic phased Er2WO6 phosphors were synthesized by the solid-state reaction technique. The starting materials utilized for the synthesis of Er2WO6 phosphor were of analytical grade and procured from Sigma Aldrich with 99.9% purity. At first, stoichiometric proportions of Er2O3 and WO3 powders were cautiously weighed and ground using a mortar and pestle for 1 h. The powder mixture was then annealed for 6 h at 1473 K with ramp up rate 5 °C per minute in an ambient environment and allowed to cool with ramp down rate 5° C per minute before characterizing its various properties.
2.2. Characterization and measurement techniques
The phase identification of the crystalline Er2WO6 phosphor was examined by using a Bruker X-ray diffraction (XRD) system using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å), analyzed in the range from 20 to 80 degree. A three-dimensional view of the monoclinic phased of the Er2WO6 crystal structure has been evaluated using the VESTA software23 and furnished in ESI.† Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra of the as-prepared phosphor were recorded by using a PerkinElmer (Lambda-950) UV–visible spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere. The morphology and elemental mapping of the Er2WO6 phosphor were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM JEOL JSM-7800F) furnished with an Oxford Aztec energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) device. The oxidation state of the chemical elements in the Er2WO6 phosphor and its unique binding energy values were analyzed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) technique using a Versa Probe 5000 system. High-resolution XPS scans were conducted for the Er 4d, W 4f, O 1s & C 1s region. All the binding energy values were corrected for the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. The UC and photoluminescence properties along with the emission lifetime of the as-prepared Er2WO6 phosphors were investigated using the FLS980 system (Edinburgh Instruments) with a 980 nm laser source. The PSU-III-LED device equipped with a maximum of 2 W power with a spot size ∼0.01 cm2 is used as a source of excitation. Emission was detected with photomultiplier tube (PMT) detectors in the visible (Hamamatsu-R928P) and NIR (Hamamatsu R5509-72) regions. Continuous excitation is used for UC emission measurements while the pulsed excitation is adopted for decay profile measurement with the spectral bandwidth 0.4 nm. The commission of Internationale de l’ Eclairage (CIE) colour coordinates were determined by exploring the spectral energy distribution functions of the Er2WO6 material.
2.3. Fingerprint collection and analysis
The use of the phosphor as a latent fingerprint marker was evaluated on a thumbprint embossed on a glass slide. The powder was dusted on to the fingerprint using a camel hair-brush and then excited using 980 nm laser light. The excitation power density used to capture the fingerprint image is 0.60 W cm−2 and excitation power density across the fingerprint is measured about 4 cm2. Canon EOS 1100D camera with Canon EF-S 18–55 mm f/3.5–5.6 III lens configuration has been used to capture the fingerprint image. The image acquisition parameters are aperture f/5, ISO 100, exposure time 10 seconds, zoom 45 mm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Powder XRD and morphological investigation

Fig. 1 exhibits the XRD pattern of the Er2WO6 phosphor material synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. All the reflections in the XRD patterns are identically matched with the ICDD number 04-006-0460 analogous to the Er2WO6 monoclinic phase, confirming its phase purity. The Er2WO6 phosphor has a monoclinic crystal structure, which corresponds to the space group P2/c (13). No other supplementary reflections were observed in the powder XRD pattern. In the Er2WO6 structure, there are three inequivalent Er3+ sites that are formed and there are 6 inequivalent oxygen sites formed.24

3.2. XPS core level spectra of the Er2WO6 material

Fig. 3 shows the occurrences of all the elements in Er2WO6 such as Er, W, and O which are well confirmed in the XPS wide scan survey. To investigate the chemical state and binding energy of each element, high-resolution XPS measurements were done and the results are shown in Fig. 4(a–d). The baseline for the as-obtained data was corrected using the Shirley-Tougaard background approximation method. For the deconvolution process, the as-obtained high-resolution XPS data were fitted using Gaussian–Lorentzian components.25

Fig. 4(a) represents the high-resolution XPS spectra of the core level Er-4d region in the Er2WO6 phosphor material. The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of Er 4d is well fitted into four distinct peaks. The XPS peak signal traced at 166.5 eV is due to the Er3+ 4d binding energy26 and the highly intense XPS signal observed at 167.7 eV were assigned to metallic Er.27 The peaks located at 169.4 eV and 170.3 eV were attributed to the 3+ valence state of Er ion in Er2O327,28 and Er–OH bonds,29 respectively. Fig. 4(b) elucidates the fitted XPS spectra of the W 4f core levels which have one doublet peak due to W 4f7/2 (35.2 eV) and W 4f5/2 (37.3 eV) with the binding energy difference of ∼2.1 eV attributed to the hexavalent W in WO3.30,31 From the W 4f XPS results, it was found that the W exists only with the 6+ oxidation state which is octahedrally coordinated. The deconvolution of the O-1s region in the Er2WO6 phosphor material is shown in Fig. 4(c) and was well fitted into three separate peaks. The main binding energy line positioned at 529.7 eV is recognized as the photoelectron expulsion from the O-1s level from the WO3 metal–oxygen group.32 The photoelectron peaks identified at 530.4 and 532.2 eV were assigned to the O-1s level from the Er2O3 and Er(OH)x, respectively.29 From Fig. 4(d) it was found that the high-resolution XPS spectra of the C-1s level consist of three binding energy peaks located at 286.7 eV, 285.0 eV and 284.5 were attributed to C–O, C–H and C–C/C–H, respectively.33–35
3.3. Optical properties of Er2WO6 material

3.3.1. Diffuse reflectance spectrum analysis. 

Fig. 5 portrays the UV–vis-NIR DR spectrum of the Er2WO6 host material recorded from 200 nm to 1000 nm. At first, the reflectance spectrum measured in the UV region comprises of a wide band with intense absorption of light as found between 200 to 320 nm which corresponds to the charge transfer band of the [WO6]6− host group. Many sharp, distinct and highly resolved absorption peaks were observed in the visible and NIR region which are due to the characteristic f–f transitions of the Er3+ ions.36,37 These absorptions are ascribed to the transition between the 4I15/2 ground level to the different excited levels of the Er3+ ion: 355 (4I15/2 → 2P3/2), 364 (4I15/2 → 2K15/2), 379 (4I15/2 → 4G11/2), 407 (4I15/2 → 2G9/2, 4H9/2), 451 (4I15/2 → 4F5/2, 4F3/2), 487 (4I15/2 → 4F7/2), 521 (4I15/2 → 2H11/2), 655 (4I15/2 → 4F9/2), 796 (4I15/2 → 4I9/2), and 971 (4I15/2 → 4I11/2) nm, respectively.36–38 All these narrow f–f absorption lines of the Er3+ ions are owed to the splitting of the higher energy levels by the crystal field environment around the Er ions in the Er2WO6 material. The features of many absorption lines in the reflectance spectrum indicate that the as-synthesized phosphor could be effectively excited in the ultraviolet, visible, and NIR wavelength ranges.

3.3.2. Upconversion luminescence properties of self-sensitized Er2WO6 phosphor. 

Fig. 6(a) exhibits the UC luminescence spectrum of the Er2WO6 phosphor material synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. Upon 980 nm NIR excitation, the UC luminescence spectrum comprises of emission bands peaking at 525 nm (green), 546 nm (green) and 678 nm (red) ascribed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. The UC luminescence spectrum is governed by 678 nm due to the hypersensitive transition from the populated 4F9/2 states to the 4I15/2 ground states of Er3+ which suggests that intense ground state absorption of the Er3+ ion takes place. It is interesting to observe that the integrated intensity ratio between the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 is 2.60 in the Er2WO6 phosphor, showing that the UC emission of the red light component was higher than the green light component. Also, the presence of the many sharp peaks is endorsed to the Stark-splitting pattern of the 4f energy levels of the Er3+ ions by the crystal field environment.
 Fig. 6  (a) UC luminescence spectrum of Er2WO6 phosphor under 980 nm laser excitation (inset – emission colour of the sample), (b) graphical illustration of absorption, cross-relaxation (CR) and resonance energy transfer (RET) process involved in the self-sensitized Er2WO6 phosphor under 980 nm NIR excitation. 
This evidence clearly indicates that the UC emission is primarily due to the transitions in the Er3+ ions only. Further to realize the process of the UC luminescence, the complex energy transfer mechanism in the self-sensitized Er2WO6 material is explained as follows: the plausible UC emission scheme illustrated in Fig. 6(b) can be compared to literature.36,39,40 After the absorption of 980 nm NIR radiation, the donor Er3+ ions initially get populated from the 4I15/2 ground state to the excited 4I11/2 level through the ground state absorption (GSA) process and the corresponding absorption matches well with the DR spectrum analysis. The highly populated 4I11/2 level of the donor Er3+ ion transfers most of its energy and gets excited to its 4F7/2 level. Since the energy of the 4I11/2 level in the donor and acceptor ions is equal, the donor Er3+ ion partly shares some of its energy to the acceptor ion through resonance energy transfer process (RET).36 Now, the highly energized 4F7/2 level of donor Er3+ ion transfers some of its energy to the 4F7/2 level of the acceptor Er3+ ion trough another RET process. The excited 4F7/2 levels in the donor and acceptor ions then non-radiatively relax to their respective 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2 intermediate levels. Importantly, the 4F7/2 + 4F9/2 levels of donor Er3+ ion non-radiatively share their excess energy to the 4F9/2 + 4I11/2 level of the acceptor Er3+ ion via cross-relaxation (CR) process.41–43 This is because the difference in energy between the 4F7/2 and 4F9/2 levels (∼5190 cm−1)43 in the donor Er3+ ion is nearly equal to the difference in energy between the 4F9/2 and 4I11/2 (∼5030 cm−1)43 levels of the acceptor Er3+ ion. Due to the above said CR process from donor to acceptor ion (see Fig. 6(b)) and non-radiative transition from 4F7/2 to 4F9/2 in both donor, acceptor ions, the population density of the stark levels 4F9/2(1) and 4F9/2(2) in both donor and acceptor Er3+ ions is extremely high. Finally, the populated levels 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2(1) and 4F9/2(2) in both donor and acceptor Er3+ ions relax radiatively into their respective 4I15/2 ground states by emitting visible photons at 525, 546, 657 and 678 nm, respectively. Among all the peaks, the intensity of the Stark sublevels 4F9/2(1) → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2(2) → 4I15/2 found at 678, 657 nm is very high. This shows that the level 4F9/2 is highly energized and in the end, it radiatively relaxed into the 4I15/2 ground level by releasing an intense UC red light at 678, 657 nm when compared to the green emission observed at 525 and 546 nm.


3.3.3. Pump power dependence of UC luminescence. 
In order to comprehend the mechanism associated with the observed UC process, the dependence of laser pump power with respect to their corresponding UC emission intensity was studied. This helps identify how many incident photons are required to excite the Er3+ ions in the Er2WO6 material. To achieve this, the laser excitation pump power was gradually increased and applied to the as-synthesized phosphor. Fig. 7(a) shows the UC luminescence of the Er2WO6 phosphor material as a function of laser pump power. The UC emission intensities of the Er2WO6 phosphor increased when the laser pump power was increased from 0.09 W to 1.5 W with a spot size of ∼0.01 cm2. The emitted intensity ‘I’ is proportional to the nth power of the pump power ‘P’, where ‘n’ represents the number of incident photons required to stimulate the Er3+ ions into their excited states. Fig. 7(b) shows the plot of the logarithmic intensity ‘I’ vs. logarithmic pump power ‘P’ fitted in a straight line. The ‘n’ value is calculated by determining the slope of the straight line which is found to be 0.95 and 0.69 for the transitions 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. Notably, the slope values found to be less than 1 indicates, and the results do not agree with the classical power dependence due to multiphoton absorption process. Balaji et al.44 studied the upconversion luminescence properties of Er3+ doped tungsten tellurite amorphous glasses. These Er2WO6 nanocrystals dispersed in the glass matrix showed green luminescence peaking at 548 nm due to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ion and identified with two photon absorption processes along with a very weak red emission observed at 670 nm. However, the Er2WO6 crystalline phosphor that shows strong red emission at 678 nm due to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions which is mainly through a single photon absorption process. The decrease in the slope of an upconversion luminescence versus the pump power was investigated in detail some twenty years ago in a Cs3Er2Cl9 UC phosphor. Pollnau et al.22 clearly demonstrated that the significance of the conservation of energy, a nonlinear phenomenon that shares energy from one quantum state to another quantum state cannot maintain its nonlinear process up to infinite excitation energy. Hence, the decrease in the slope of an upconversion luminescence is also expected with increasing laser pump power.

There are several mechanisms such as ground and excited level absorptions, type of energy transfer process, depletion by luminescence, cross-relaxation between the excited states in an ion, non-uniform radiative pump profile, non-uniform longitudinal pump absorptions, ground-state bleaching, distribution of luminescence ion in the host material are mainly influenced by the relaxation from an excited state to ground state. The four simple models proposed by Pollnau et al. were (i) constant population density in the ground states, (ii), continuous ground state absorption process, (iii) UC steps between subsequent excited states takes place by either energy transfer upconversion or excited state absorptions, (iv) transition from the excited states to the next lower-lying state or to the ground state. Hence, the decrease in the slope values obtained from the graph plotted between upconversion luminescence intensity versus increasing pump power is determined by the competition between the linear decay and upconversion processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states.22,45 This signpost that less than one photon is absorbed in the emission of the green (546 nm) and red (678 nm) light, respectively suggesting a prevailing behaviour of the UC luminescence. This is because the populated 4F9/2 and 4S3/2 energy levels rely on a large number of Er3+ neighbours for proficient UC in Er2WO6. This indicates that the RET and CR are being more effective in generating red UC luminescence as suggested in section 3.3.2.
In another recent study conducted by Liao et al. on Yb3+-, Nd3+-, and Er3+-doped β-NaYF4 UCNPs, the slope for their excitation intensities were <1 across the whole power density range that was ascribed to a saturation in the various emissive states of Er3+.46 The authors used two different excitation sources at 808 nm and 976 nm and observed that for 808 nm, the decrease in the slope was obtained in the low power regions while for higher powers, the slope increased. The increased slope for 808 nm was ascribed to UC luminescence from an excited Nd3+ state. In our study, since this is a self-sensitized phosphor with no additional doping, the low n values further suggest the high population of excited Er3+ states with a higher power threshold for the Er3+ → Er3+ transfer pathway. Fig. 7(c) displays the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the Er2WO6 phosphor when it was pumped with the 1.5 W laser which was found to be x = 0.5354 and y = 0.4612. By increasing the pump power from 0.09 W to 1.5 W, the CIE coordinates did not show any noticeable changes. Fig. 7(d) portrays the luminescence decay profile of the 678 nm UC red emission from the Er3+ ions due to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition in Er2WO6 and the approximate lifetime was calculated to be 46 μs. The decay profile was well-fitted using a second-order exponential function given by,47 (1)

3.3.4. Luminescence properties of the Er2WO6 phosphor. 

Fig. 8(a) exhibits the PL excitation spectrum of the Er2WO6 phosphor material measured from 200 nm to 425 nm at room temperature. The PL excitation spectrum was obtained by observing the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission of the Er3+ ions at 677 nm. The PL excitation spectrum of the Er2WO6 phosphor consists of an intense wideband which has two segments within the wavelength range of 200 to 350 nm. This is due to the charge transfer bands (CTB) produced by the transition from oxygen to the incomplete W 5d orbitals (O → W6+) found at 249 nm and oxygen to the 4f levels of the Er3+ ion (O → Er3+) observed at 305 nm, respectively.48,49 Also, the excitation spectrum contains many sharp peaks from 350 to 425 nm that were assigned to the intra-4f transitions of the Er3+ ions from the 4I15/2 ground level to the 2P3/2 (356 nm), 2K15/2 (365 nm), 4G11/2 (378 nm) and 2G9/2 + 4H9/2 (407 nm) excited levels, respectively.36,50
 Fig. 8  (a) PL Excitation (monitored at λem = 677 nm), (b) PL emission (excited at λem = 249, 305 and 378 nm) spectra of the Er2WO6 phosphor material, (c) CT and PL process in the Er2WO6. 

Fig. 8(b) indicates the PL emission spectrum of the Er2WO6 phosphor material, which comprises of two main peaks measured in the wavelength range from 510 nm to 705 nm. When excited, the as-synthesized phosphor shows a weak green emission band found at 556 nm and a high-intensity red emission originated at 677 nm due to the transitions from 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. The PL emission spectra of the Er2WO6 phosphors excited at 249, 305, and 378 nm have similar spectral profiles and do not show any significant change in their peak position. Nevertheless, the luminescence intensity of the peak located at 677 nm was higher when the phosphor was excited at 249 nm. It must also be pointed out that the ratio of the green with respect to the red also changed with excitation wavelength. Fig. 8(c) explains the scheme of energy transfer phenomenon involved in the photoluminescence process. Upon excitation at 249, 305 & 375 nm wavelengths of the Er2WO6 phosphor, the energy is transferred from charge-transfer states of WO66− group to the 4f ground levels of Er3+ ions. The Er3+ ions are subsequently populated form the 4I15/2 ground state to 2P3/2, 2K15/2, 4G11/22G9/2 and 4H9/2 excited levels. Finally, the levels 4S3/2, 4F9/2 get highly populated through non-radiative transfers of energy form the above said excited levels and the corresponding emission is observed at 556 and 677 nm due to the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively.


3.3.5. NIR luminescence properties of the Er2WO6 phosphor. 

Fig. 9(a) demonstrates that the PL spectral profiles at the emission of 1537 nm (λex = 980 nm) might efficiently warrant that Er2WO6 acts as a self-sensitized phosphor and also gives emissions in the infrared region. The NIR luminescence spectrum contains a high intense wideband between 1425 nm and 1675 nm with a peak centered at around 1537 nm. This wide emission band is assigned to the characteristic 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition taking place in both donor and acceptor Er3+ ions. Upon 980 nm laser irradiation on the Er2WO6 phosphor, the level 4I13/2 of donor Er3+ ion gets populated from its 4I15/2 ground level through the GSA process. In addition, the populated 4I13/2 of donor Er3+ ion non-radiatively promotes its energy to its 4I11/2 level. The excited 4I11/2 level of donor Er3+ ion shares some of its energy to the 4I11/2 level of acceptor Er3+ ion through RET process (see Fig. 6(b)) after which, the populated 4I11/2 levels in both donor and acceptor Er3+ ions non-radiatively relaxes to their respective 4I13/2 levels. Then, the highly energized 4I13/2 level of donor and acceptor Er3+ radiatively de-excites into the 4I15/2 ground level, resulting in the emission at 1537 nm. Fig. 9(b) shows the luminescence decay profile for the transition 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 in the Er2WO6 phosphor, which was calculated as 181.6 μs using a single exponential function. The comparatively long lifetime of Er3+ ions calculated for the transition 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 at 1537 nm signifies the suitability of the Er2WO6 phosphor material for its use in optical communication. In conclusion, various processes such as GSA, RET and CR mechanisms have been employed to investigate the UC and PL of 4f levels in Er3+ ions.

3.3.6. Latent-fingerprint detection in forensic applications. 

Fig. 10 illustrates the strategy developed for latent-fingerprint detection using the Er2WO6 UC phosphor. Minute sweat holes or pores on the friction ridges having a size ∼1–50 μm act as an entryway for sweat and these pores connect sweat glands through a duct. The three important glands eccrine, sebaceous and apocrine produce sweat which is essential for the latent-fingerprints detection.15 The collected fingerprint mostly consists of moisture that quickly evaporates and leaves some material residue on the surface. The residual constituents are normally NaCl, KCl, lipids, amino acids, supplementary inorganic matter, organic components, etc.51 Dusting the phosphor powder on the site of fingerprints, particles of the phosphor powder initially dissolves in the sweat residual components. Some of the halide ions in sweat react with amino acids and esters, resulting in the formation of some amides which finally interact with the dusted phosphor powder and bond non-covalently through a physisorption process. Besides, dusting the phosphor results in a substantial reduction in motion of the sweat molecules and thus creating a pressure shortfall. Due to this pressure shortfall, the particles of the phosphor powder fully stick with the remaining residue. Moreover, the hydrophilic contact of the phosphor material with the fingerprint residual components supports the binding properties of each other. Since the Er2WO6 phosphor is highly hydrophilic and adheres readily to the fingerprint on embossed on difficult surfaces without any surface modification which conventional UC nano-phosphors require. Besides, the ridges and traces of the fingerprint have a more water of almost 98% and no background signal is detected. The applicability of this scheme using the Er2WO6 phosphor for detection of fingerprints was investigated. Fig. 10 displays the representative UC luminescence of the Er2WO6 phosphor material captured upon 980 nm NIR laser light. The image clearly demonstrates the details of the fingerprint structure and validates the usefulness of this phosphor in identifying fingerprints of individuals, confirming the efficacy of the Er2WO6 phosphor as a marker for fingerprint detection.

4. Conclusions
A Yb3+ free Er2WO6 phosphor material was prepared through a solid-state method at a temperature of 1473 K. The obtained Er2WO6 has a monoclinic structure in which a hexavalent W atom is connected to six equal oxygen atoms to form deformed [WO6]6− octahedra. High-resolution XPS measurements clearly demonstrate that the photoelectron peaks found at 169.4 eV were due to the 3+ valence state of the Er3+ ion. Narrow f–f absorption lines of Er3+ ions were found in the DRS are due to the splitting of the higher energy levels by the crystal field environment around the Er3+ ions in the Er2WO6 material. Under 980 nm excitation, the UC emission in the red region at 678 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) was much higher than the green component at 546 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2). The intermediate levels 4F7/2 and 4F9/2 of the donor Er3+ ion play an important role in UC of the red emission in the Er2WO6 phosphor acts as a self-sensitizer via CR and RET processes. The low n value in the intensity vs. excitation pump power suggests an over population of excited Er3+ states with a higher power threshold for the Er3+ → Er3+ de-excitation pathway. Other possible reasons for this low value have also been discussed. Upon 980 nm NIR excitation, the highly populated 4I13/2 level of Er3+ non-radiatively decays into the 4I15/2 ground level by emitting a broad band centered at 1537 nm. The UC luminescence properties of Er2WO6 suggest that the phosphor can be considered as a useful candidate for fingerprint detection in forensic science.
