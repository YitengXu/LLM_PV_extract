Uniform coating of WO3 shell indicates a clear preference for growth on the single crystalline Si nanowires. Structure and crystallinity of the WO3 shell are strongly dependent on the filament temperature (Tf). X-ray diffraction patterns and micro-Raman spectra suggested that there was a structure evolution from amorphous into crystallite WO3 monoclinic structure when Tf was increased to 1300 °C and above. The WO3 shell exhibits stoichiometric tungsten trioxide structure as identified by micro-Raman and X-ray photoemission spectra analyses, which showed only W6+–O vibration modes for the former analysis and W6+ energy band for the latter. Microstructure, crystal lattice, interface and growth orientation of the core–shell nanowires were recognized using a high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that the core–shell nanowires had preserved the optical transmittance of Si core at a longer wavelength, while showing an additional transmission band edge at a shorter wavelength due to tungsten oxide coating. Their optical absorption increased to 80% and above in visible region, owing to the one-dimensional Si NWs backbone. Optical band gap of the core–shell nanowires showed a variation from 2.4 to 1.8 eV with Tf. This superior visible light absorption core–shell nanowires architecture subsequently enhanced the photocurrent density of the crystalline WO3 nanostructures.
1. Introduction
Complex inorganic nanoheterostructures, for instance core–shell, core-multi-shells, dendritic and hierarchical nanowires (NWs) have garnered tremendous research interest owing to their superiority in cell conversion efficiency due to their unique geometry and effective integration with other materials.1,2 Recent reports showed that solar water splitting and photocatalytic performances for TiO2,3 α-Fe2O3,4 Cu2O5 and ZnO nanostructures6 were significantly enhanced by using a core–shell nanoheterostructure strategy. These metal oxide semiconductors have the advantages of good stability and high resistance to photocorrosion.7 However, they mostly work with only UV or portion of visible solar irradiation due to their wide band gaps. Si NWs have shown high optical absorption over broad wavelength range because of their relatively low band gap (1.12 eV) and the one-dimensional nanostructures morphology which facilitates light trapping. The formation of Si/metal oxides core–shell NWs can be a remedy to achieving full solar spectrum absorption, thus maximizing the efficiency of water splitting reaction. Compare to other three-dimensional heterostructure architectures, core–shell nanoheterostructure is favourable because the metal oxide shell can protect the Si core from the corrosion by electrolytes.8 In addition, core–shell structures maximize the surface contact, and therefore enhance the electron-hole pair separation efficiency at both junctions.3 On top of that, core–shell nanoheterostructures give rise to other novel properties by combining intrinsic properties of each material. For example, porous Si/ZnO core–shell NWs exhibit white photoluminescence in the entire visible light region resulting from the merging of blue and green emissions from ZnO and red emission from porous Si.9,10
Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is an n-type wide band gap semiconductor. The indirect band gap of WO3 varies from 3.25–3.65 eV (amorphous)11 and 2.6–2.7 eV (crystalline),12,13 depending on the structure and sample preparation method.14 The wide band gap, high coloration efficiency, and large reversible optical transmittance of amorphous WO3 make it a good candidate for electrochromic windows and wide-angle displays.15 In contrast, crystalline WO3 were proven to be a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water splitting cells due to its lower band gap and high photocatalytic activity.16 Moreover, crystalline WO3 displays better stability in cyclic voltmetric and higher durability against oxidative damage compared to oxygen deficient WO3−x.17 Likewise, polycrystalline WO3 displays a more stable resistance switching behavior and higher low-to-high resistance signal ratio than their non-stoichiometric structures.18 However, WO3 generally exhibits low optical absorption in visible and near infrared regions, which can cause the loss of photogenerated charge carriers for energy conversion. One possible approach to address this problem is to place WO3 on the base of low band gap nanostructures to improve light trapping ability. Additionally, the formation of complex WO3 architecture can subsequently increase its effective surface area, resulting in better performance for WO3 photoelectrochemical cells.
Numerous deposition techniques have been reported for the preparation of Si and WO3 nanostructures. Si NWs have been synthesized via two approaches, namely top down and bottom up, by using a variety of deposition techniques including thermal evaporation, laser ablation, reactive-ion etching and electroless metal deposition, chemical vapor deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD).19,20 Bottom up vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) NWs growth process is a favorable approach due to its capability to produce good crystallinity, less crystal defect and low impurities Si NWs.21 Meanwhile, pulsed laser deposition, magnetron sputtering, thermal evaporation, HWCVD, electrodeposition, anodization, hydrothermal and sol–gel methods have been introduced for WO3 nanostructures fabrication.22,23 HWCVD is a widely explored technique using a tungsten filament as the tungsten source. The heated tungsten filament is readily oxidized upon exposure to oxidized gas. The WO3 or WO3−x molecules will then tend to desorb from the filament surface, forming WO3 condensation on the substrate.
Studying and monitoring the growth process of heterostructured NWs is of fundamental importance in order to enhance their quality and performance. We have demonstrated the controllable growth of one-dimensional Si NWs using HWCVD in our previous reports.24–27 The synthesis of WO3 nanostructures can be performed by using the same system. Here, we report, for the first time, the growth of Si/WO3 core–shell NWs via two separate processes in a single reactor based on plasma-assisted hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (PA-HWCVD) technique. The conformal coating of WO3 nanostructures on the as-prepared Si NWs arrays resulted in the formation of Si/WO3 core–shell NWs. To ensure the growth of stoichiometric WO3 shell, we implemented an efficient oxidizing technique with the assistance of nitrous oxide (N2O) plasma to form stabilized WO3 bonds. The WO3 nanostructured shell with filament temperature (Tf) was examined thoroughly in order to evaluate their properties such as the morphology, bonding and structural evolution.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthetic procedures of Si NWs base
Si NWs, which serves as the base for the growth of three-dimensional nanostructures, were synthesized on Si(111), glass and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrates using a home-built PA-HWCVD system.28 Indium seeds were used as catalyst to initiate VLS growth of Si NWs. To begin with, the indium seeds were deposited on the substrates by evaporating the indium wire (purity = 99.999%) in a hydrogen plasma environment. Details pertaining to the formation of the indium catalyst including its morphology are as reported in our previous paper.24 The growth of Si NWs was begun by introducing silane gas (diluted in hydrogen gas) into the reactor and heating the tungsten filament at a temperature of 1700–1800 °C. The deposition procedures were as previously described.24–27
2.2 Growth of tungsten oxide nanostructures
WO3 nanostructures were deposited on the as-grown Si NWs substrate using the same plasma-assisted hot-wire chemical vapor deposition system. Tungsten wire (purity = 99.9%) which was used as the tungsten source, was coiled for about 30 turns filament with a length and diameter of about 3 cm and 5 mm, respectively. The tungsten filament was then coupled with two electrodes on both ends and was placed about 5 cm above the Si NWs substrates. Substrate temperature was kept at 300 ± 10 °C using a heater rod which was placed under the substrate. The tungsten filament was resistively heated to different Tf ranging from 950 to 1700 °C in a N2O plasma environment. The N2O plasma acts in the oxidization of the filament surface to form WO3 (or WO3−x) molecules. The N2O plasma was generated at a radio frequency of 13.56 MHz and power of 60 W, while the N2O gas flow rate and reactor pressure were fixed at 60 sccm and about 0.3 mbar, respectively. The WO3 deposition was terminated by switching off the hot-wire power supply after deposition for 3 minutes.
2.3 Characterization techniques
Morphology of the samples was studied using a Hitachi SU 8000 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The samples were scanned at low voltage (<3 kV) to obtain their surface morphologies. An X-MAX Oxford Instrument energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached to a JSM-7600F JEOL FESEM was utilized to acquire EDX spectra for composition analysis. Structural properties of the samples were analyzed using a SIEMENS D5000 X-ray diffractometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained at a 2θ range of 20 to 60° at a grazing angle of 5°. Micro-Raman measurement was performed using a Renishaw InVia PL/Raman spectrometer. The micro-Raman spectra were observed under Ar + laser source operating at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm. Chemical bonding of the samples was examined using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), operated by a BL3.2a beam-line photoemission electron spectroscopy from Synchrotron Light system in Thailand. The measurements were done using photon energy settings of 0–600 eV with an energy step of 0.1 eV. Microstructures, crystal lattices as well as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of the NWs were studied via a JEOL JEM 2100F high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). For TEM specimen preparation, the NWs coated substrates were immersed in aqueous isopropanol, and then sonicated for about 10 minutes to dislocate the NWs from the substrate. The NWs containing solution was dropcasted onto a Lacey Formvar copper grid, then dried in an oven for the HRTEM analysis.
Optical transmission and reflection spectra of the samples were measured by using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectrophotometer. Photocurrents of the samples were measured using a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat (Ametek Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN). A solar light simulator (Oriel Instrument) was used to simulate sunlight under AM 1.5G with a light irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. A conventional three-electrode cell with samples as working electrode, a platinum wire as counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl) as reference electrode, was built, and was immersed in a 1 M KCl electrolyte solution for the photocurrent measurements. Electron field emission measurements were conducted using a home-built field emission chamber (base pressure < 2 × 10−6 mbar), equipped with high-voltage source-measure unit (Stanford Research Systems, model PS350). A planar configuration with ITO glass as anode and sample as ground was constructed. The spacing between anode and sample was maintained at 200 ± 20 μm for all measurements.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the EDX spectra and cross-sectional FESEM images (inset of figures) of Si NWs and WO3-coated Si NWs substrates, respectively. The indium-catalyzed Si NWs reveal a tapered structure with a length of about 2 μm and a base diameter of about 120 nm. A strong signal for Si from the EDX spectrum [Fig. 1(a)] confirms the purity of the Si NWs, while a weak signal for oxygen seems to originate from the native surface oxide of the Si NWs. Traces of the indium element were detected from the indium caps (on top of the NWs). The WO3 deposition resulted in changes in the diameter and surface roughness of the NWs [inset in Fig. 1(b)]. EDX spectrum of the structure revealed a tungsten signal (wt% of 25.35%) and amplification of the oxygen signal (wt% increased from 6.84% to 18.64%). This provides evidence that the Si NWs have been successfully coated with tungsten oxide. There was an overlap between the low energy W peak (1.77 keV) with the Si peak (1.74 keV), thus both peaks were obtained via deconvolution using existing software in the EDX spectrometer to generate the wt% for both elements.

Morphologies of the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs formed at different Tf for 3 minutes of WO3 deposition are presented in Fig. 2(a)–(c). The one-dimensional structure was conserved and no WO3 coating was found in the interspace between NWs, showing that the WO3 nanostructures are layered only on the Si NWs' surface. The WO3 coating formed a thin shell layer at Tf of 950 °C, retaining the tapered shape of the Si NWs [Fig. 2(a)]. Increase in Tf gave rise to elevation of condensation rate for the WO3. At Tf of 1100 °C [Fig. 2(b)], the WO3 nanostructures coating resulted in the formation core–shell NWs with a uniform diameter. The WO3 nanostructures have a tendency to condense on the upper region of the Si NWs rather than the bottom part. This phenomenon was proven by the formation of an inverted cone shape as shown in Fig. 2(c) when Tf was further increased to 1700 °C. Meanwhile, the core–shell NWs possessed a rough surface presumably due to the variety of WO3 nanostructure dimensions growing on the Si NWs' surface. To further analyze the lateral growth process of the WO3 nanostructure, the varied diameter of the NWs' on the top and bottom sides were plotted against Tf as shown in Fig. 2(d). The higher growth rate of WO3 nanostructures on the upper region of the NWs as observed by the increase in steepness of the plot for the NWs' tip diameter indicates a change in morphology for the core–shell NWs when Tf was increased. The irregular thermal transfer from the heated tungsten filament could be responsible for the change. Heat transferred from the hot-wire to the Si NWs surface via radiation at a rate, P ∝ Tf4. As Tf increases, the radiation power increased dramatically. The one-dimensional structure of Si NWs tends to slow down the phonon transportation,29 therefore, more thermal energy was confined in the upper region of the NWs. This created a preferred growth site for adsorption of WO3 molecules and caused the growth of inverted cone-shaped core–shell NWs.

Structural properties and crystallinity of the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs were examined by XRD. The XRD patterns of the samples prepared at different Tf are presented in Fig. 3. At Tf of 950 and 1100 °C, only Si diffraction peaks corresponding to the cubic Si crystal planes were observed from their XRD patterns. This reveals that the WO3 nanostructures deposited are amorphous in structure, or may only consist of smaller range crystal lattices could not be detected by XRD. WO3 diffraction peaks were detected for the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs prepared at Tf of 1300 °C and above, indicating crystallization of WO3 nanostructures when Tf was increased. The WO3 diffraction peaks were well-matched to the crystallography planes of monoclinic γ-WO3 (JCPDS no. 43-1035). Higher Tf is likely to enhance the crystallinity of the WO3 structure, as proven by the increment in the intensity of WO3 diffraction peaks. In addition, WO3 crystals have a tendency to grow towards the 〈001〉 orientation, as indicated by the enhancement of (002) crystal plane when Tf was increased. Meanwhile, the existence of Si crystal diffraction peaks in all the XRD patterns confirms that the crystal structure of the Si NWs base were unaltered after the secondary deposition of WO3.
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns and (b) micro-Raman spectra of the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs prepared at different Tf. 
Micro-Raman measurements were carried out to examine the chemical bonds of Si NWs core and WO3 nanostructure shell. Fig. 3(b) shows the micro-Raman spectra of the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs prepared at different Tf from 950 to 1700 °C. Consistent with the XRD results, all the samples showed high Si peak (520 cm−1) intensity corresponding to transverse optical (TO) phonon mode originating from the crystalline Si NWs core. Typical vibration modes of monoclinic WO3 including W6+–O–W6+ bending mode (137 cm−1), O–W6+–O bending mode (274 and 326 cm−1) and W6+O stretching mode (718 and 808 cm−1)30,31 were observed only at Tf of 1300 °C and above. The absence of any oxygen deficient WO3−x bonding vibration mode (W5+–O or W4+–O)32 confirms the stoichiometric WO3 shell structure. The W6+O stretching modes located at 718 and 810 cm−1 are two figurative peaks representing crystalline WO3.33 The significant enhancement of the stretching modes, especially at the 810 cm−1 Raman peak, indicates improvement in crystal structure of the WO3 with increase of Tf. The micro-Raman spectra of the samples prepared at Tf of 1100 °C and below showed no Raman peak for WO3, which confirms that the WO3 shell grown at these Tf exists only in amorphous phase. Both XRD and micro-Raman analyses suggest crystallization of WO3 begins at Tf of between 1100 and 1300 °C. As the substrate temperature (300 ± 10 °C) is slightly lower than the WO3 crystallization temperature of 350 to 390 °C,34,35 it is apparent that crystallization is due to the thermal radiation from the hot-wire surface. The heat transferred onto the growth sites provides additional kinetics for the WO3 molecules, leading to the rearrangement of the lattice to form long range, ordered WO3 crystal.
Although XRD and micro-Raman results validated the crystalline stoichiometric WO3 shell, the stoichiometry of amorphous WO3 shell is yet to be confirmed. XPS spectrum [Fig. S1†] was analyzed using the W and O chemical bonding to evaluate the stoichiometry of the WO3 nanostructure. Fig. 4(a) and (b) display the XPS spectra of W 4f core level measured on the amorphous WO3 nanoclusters (Tf of 950 °C) and crystalline WO3 nanocolumns (Tf of 1700 °C) coated Si NWs samples, respectively. The W 4f spectra obtained from both samples show a broad, double band peak which can be deconvoluted into two symmetrical Gaussian peaks at 35.5 and 37.6 eV, corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 bands, respectively.36 These double energy bands correspond to the W6+ oxidation state.37 The W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 spin–orbit separation is 2.1 eV, which agrees with the theoretical value for WO3.36 The XPS peaks that fit well with the W6+ oxidation bands clearly indicate that the samples are mainly consisting of stoichiometric WO3 bonding. It can thus be concluded that both amorphous and crystalline shells are stoichiometric WO3. Previous reports showed that the vapor phase deposited tungsten oxide is usually oxygen deficient.38 In our case, the N2O plasma environment plays a crucial role in the formation of stoichiometric WO3. The N2O plasma provides a surface treatment on the heated tungsten filament by extraction of weak W and O bonds to form reactive free voids. The excited O species bond rapidly to the W voids, eventually forming stable WO3 molecules.
 Fig. 4  XPS element scan of W 4f (a and b) and O 1s (c and d) spectra obtained from samples prepared at Tf of (a and c) 950 °C, and (b and d) 1700 °C; respectively. 
In addition, O 1s spectra from both amorphous and crystalline WO3 samples were also examined as depicted in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The O 1s spectra can be further deconvoluted, producing two peaks at 530.5 and 532.5 eV. The 530.5 eV energy peak, which is assigned to the O–W bond, is contributed by the oxygen atoms in stoichiometric WO3;39 whereas the 532.5 eV energy peak is attributed to the Si–O bond (532.5 eV) in native oxide of Si NWs40 or the oxygen in water molecules bound in the WO3 structure (532.7 eV).41 As the samples were prepared in a vacuum system where water molecule contamination was minimized, we believe that the 532.5 eV peak was mainly due to the Si–O bond. High intensity of Si bonded to O was observed for Si NWs coated with amorphous WO3 nanoclusters. The Si–O bond could have originated from the native oxide layer on the Si NWs or O–Si bonding formed at the interface layer of the WO3 and Si. For crystalline WO3 nanoclusters coated Si NWs prepared at Tf of 1700 °C, the rise of the O–W peak and suppression of O–Si peak suggest that the surface of the Si NWs are densely packed with WO3 crystals.
The structures and crystal lattices of the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs were studied using HRTEM and results are as depicted in Fig. 5. TEM and HRTEM micrographs of the sample prepared at Tf of 950 °C [Fig. 5(a)] shows a high density of WO3 nanoclusters cladding on the Si NW's backbone. Magnified HRTEM micrograph of the nanocluster region is displayed in Fig. 5(b). The WO3 nanoclusters coating (darker, outermost region) reveals only amorphous structure and this was confirmed by the FFT pattern [inset in Fig. 5(b)] which did not show any diffraction pattern or ring. The crystal lattices observed from the brighter region as identified by the FFT analysis corresponds to the Si NWs. This confirms the formation of crystalline Si/amorphous WO3 nanoclusters core–shell NWs at lower Tf. The thickness of the nanoclusters shell is about 10 nm. For samples prepared at Tf of 1700 °C, nanocolumnar structures of WO3 grew and became elongated from the Si NWs' surface [Fig. 5(c)]. The Si NWs were totally covered with nanocolumnar WO3 structures forming a typical core–shell. The WO3 nanocolumns grew longer at the upper part of the Si NW, extending up to nearly 150 nm. The length gradually reduced towards the base of the NW. HRTEM micrograph [Fig. 5(d)] reveals crystalline structure of the WO3 nanocolumns. The lattice spacing measurement obtained using the HRTEM was about 0.38 nm, which corresponds to the (001) crystallographic plane of the monoclinic WO3. FFT pattern of the WO3 nanocolumns [inset of Fig. 5(d)] shows the growth axis of the WO3 crystal is along the [001] orientation. HRTEM micrograph obtained from the c-Si and c-WO3 interface [inset of Fig. 5(d)] reveals a good atomic connection. The WO3 lattice makes an angle of about 56° with the Si lattice, agreeing with the slanted angle of the WO3 nanocolumns.

Stoichiometric WO3 is highly transparent in visible and near infra-red regions. As shown in Fig. 6(a), typically, the WO3 films reveal high transmittance (T > 80%) at λ > 400 nm. The T spectra of WO3 nanostructure films decreased sharply at λ < 400 nm (E > 3.1 eV) due to the fundamental adsorption edge.42 We observed a red-shift in the T edge with Tf, which may indicates an energy gap narrowing of the WO3. Si NW array [Fig. 6(b)] reveals a low transmittance value (<65%) within the spectral range of study due to the high absorption ability of the one-dimensional sub-wavelength structures.43 The T edge of the Si NWs sample is about 750 nm (E ∼ 1.6 eV). Si/WO3 core–shell NWs revealed a similar T spectrum with Si NWs at near infra-red region; while an additional T band tail extended towards the shorter wavelength was observed in visible region. This could be caused by the shifting of optical band gap contributed by the WO3 shell. The optical R spectra of WO3 films, Si NWs, and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs were presented in Fig. 6(b). The low R of Si NWs and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs (<2%) in visible region confirm the good light absorption of the sample.
 Fig. 6  Typical optical (a) transmission, and (b) reflectance spectra of WO3 films, Si NWs, and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs prepared on glass substrates. 
To study the light absorption properties, optical absorbance (A) of the samples was calculated from the T and R spectra using the relation as: A = 100 − T − R. The average absorbance in visible region (λ of 400 to 800 nm), Avis, of the WO3 films and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs were calculated and plotted in Fig. 7(a). The Avis is generally lower than 12% for all the WO3 films samples. However, the Avis slightly increases with Tf due to the improvement in the crystalline structure of WO3. The Si/WO3 core–shell NWs revealed significantly higher Avis of more than 80%, owing to the vertically-aligned Si NWs array, which enhance light trapping effect. The inverted-cone shaped core–shell NWs prepared at higher Tf showed higher Avis than the core–shell NWs with cone-shape formed at lower Tf. The inter-nanowires scattering effect and the nanoscale rough surface (from HRTEM micrographs) of WO3 shell are expected to contribute to the further enhancement in light harvesting.
 Fig. 7  Variation of (a) Avis, and (b) Eg with Tf for the WO3 thin films and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs. 
Optical energy gap (Eg) of the samples was calculated using Tauc's relation, as: (αE)m = B(E − Eg), where m is 0.5 for allowed indirect allowed transition.44 The absorption coefficient, α can be calculated from the optical transmission (T) and reflectance (R) as: . Tauc's plots of the WO3 thin films and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs are shown in Fig. S2 and S3,† respectively; while the Eg were obtained by using the method shown in the literature.45 Theoretically, amorphous WO3 has a band gap of about 3.25 to 3.65 eV,11 while band gap of bulk crystalline WO3 (monoclinic) is about 2.6–2.7 eV.12,13 The band gap of nanocrystallines WO3 (mixed phase of amorphous and nanocrystalline) is in between 3.25 to 2.92 eV, mainly depending on their crystalline sizes.46 The Eg of HWCVD deposited WO3 films obtained from our experiments are plotted in Fig. 7(b), showing a constant decrease from 3.7 to 2.7 eV, when Tf increases. The reduction is attributed to the transition of WO3 films from amorphous into crystalline phase, as indicated by XRD and micro-Raman analyses. Eg of the crystalline WO3 prepared at Tf 1700 °C is close to the Eg of bulk crystalline WO3 (2.6–2.7 eV). Our as-grown Si NWs sample exhibits an Eg of 1.4 eV. Formation of WO3 shells on the Si NWs backbone modified their optical Eg. Tauc's plots of these Si/WO3 core–shell NWs [Fig. S3†] show two indirect energy band curves, which are lower Eg slope (1.4–1.6 eV) and higher Eg slope (1.8–2.4 eV), corresponding to Si core and WO3 shell, respectively. The Eg of Si is virtually conserved in the core–shell NWs system. The band gap narrowing in WO3 shell could be due to the diffusion of Si atoms into the WO3 structure, creating a doping to the WO3 shell. The amorphous WO3 shells exhibit Eg of about 2.4 and 2.2 eV for Tf of 950 and 1100 °C, respectively. The Eg of the crystalline WO3 shell decreased from 2.1 eV to 1.8 eV when Tf increased from 1300 to 1700 °C. The lower Eg and higher visible light absorption suggest an enhancement in photon management of Si/WO3 core–shell NWs, compared to the planar WO3 thin films.
To study the photocurrent response, photocurrent–time plots of the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs system under light on/off illumination are displayed in Fig. 8. The photocurrent–time curves were obtained by setting the baseline as light off current. The as-grown WO3 thin films showed no photocurrent response [Fig. S4†] regardless to the Tf of WO3 deposition. This could be due to the low optical absorption of the WO3 films, which is incapable to trap enough photon for current conversion. For Si/WO3 core–shell NWs, the photocurrent response can be witnessed by observing the difference in dark and photo currents. Amorphous WO3 usually showed lower photocurrent compared to the crystalline WO3 due to its higher band gap.47 Similarly, the amorphous WO3 shell revealed relatively low photocurrent density (about 1.5 μA cm−2) compare to the crystalline WO3 shell (∼12 μA cm−2) under zero biased voltage. Meanwhile the photocurrent response was enhanced by a factor of about 1.5, reaching a photocurrent density of about 21 μA cm−2 under a biased voltage of 1 V. This photocurrent density is comparable to the WO3/Fe2O3 nanostructures system, which showed a maximum photocurrent density of 22 μA cm−2 at 0.8 V.48 The photocurrent generated by this Si/crystalline WO3 core–shell NWs anode showed high stability under a continuous illumination for more than 30 minutes (Fig. S5†). In addition, the photocurrent–time plot showed a short photocurrent response time in the light on condition, where the photocurrent reached its optimum value in a time interval of less than 5 seconds. However, under light off condition, the system took more than 40 seconds to reach an optimum dark current. The large decay time could be due to the presence of surface related trap center which can be improved via a proper surface treatment.49,50

Additionally, field emission experiment was carried out to study the electron transportation of Si in the presence of WO3 shell. The current density–electric field (J–E) curve of Si NWs and Si/WO3 core–shell NWs are plotted in Fig. 9. In order to minimize the morphological effect on the field emission properties, Si/WO3 core–shell prepared at 950 and 1300 °C, which still remained the tapering morphology of Si NWs, while exhibited amorphous and crystalline WO3 structures respectively were chosen. Our tapering Si NWs showed a low turn-on field of 8.0 V μm−1 for J = 0.01 mA cm−2, which is comparable to the literatures.51,52 Coating of WO3 shell on the Si NWs' surface increases the turn-on field to 13.1 V μm−1 (for amorphous WO3) and 12.8 V μm−1 (for crystalline WO3). As the Si/amorphous WO3 and Si/crystalline WO3 core–shell NWs showing similar field emission effect, the electron tunneling from the WO3 shell itself can be neglected. The inhibition of electron emission is thus related to the band structure of the Si and WO3 combination. Si is known to exhibit an electron affinity of 4.05 eV; and electron affinity of WO3 is determined to be 3.33 eV.53 The conduction band of WO3 should be higher than Si, thus, the transportation of electron charge from WO3 shell into Si core is energetically more favorable. This explains the increase in the turn-on field of electron tunneling for Si/WO3 core–shell NWs compared to Si NWs, and elucidates the enhancement in the photocurrent generation due to the increase in electron mobility from WO3 shell towards Si core.

4. Conclusions
As a summary, successfully grown Si/WO3 core–shell heterostructure NWs were achieved using a cost effective single PA-HWCVD reactor technique. The proposed technique is promising for the deposition of complex core–shell NWs with tunable structures and morphologies. Amorphous and crystalline stoichiometric WO3 shell can be synthesized on the Si NWs core by controlling the filament temperature. The Si/WO3 core–shell NWs showed high visible light absorption properties (>80%), and their optical band gaps vary from 2.4 to 1.8 eV with the filament temperature. The high photocurrent detected under low applied potential and the stable photocurrent responses indicate that the Si/WO3 core–shell NWs system can be a candidate in photoelectrochemical cells and photovoltaic applications.
