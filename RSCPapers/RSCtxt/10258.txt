    , Accepted 31st October 2013First published on 11th November 2013AbstractSix cobalt and manganese corrole complexes were synthesized and examined as single-site catalysts for water splitting. The simple cobalt corrole [Co(tpfc)(py)2] (1, tpfc = 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole, py = pyridine) catalyzed both water oxidation and proton reduction efficiently. By coating complex 1 onto indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, the turnover frequency for electrocatalytic water oxidation was 0.20 s−1 at 1.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7), and it was 1010 s−1 for proton reduction at −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 0.5). The stability of 1 for catalytic oxygen evolution and hydrogen production was evaluated by electrochemical, UV-vis and mass measurements, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which confirmed that 1 was the real molecular catalyst. Titration and UV-vis experiments showed that the pyridine group on Co dissociated at the beginning of catalysis, which was critical to subsequent activation of water. A proton-coupled electron transfer process was involved based on the pH dependence of the water oxidation reaction catalyzed by 1. As for manganese corroles 2–6, although their oxidizing powers were comparable to that of 1, they were not as stable as 1 and underwent decomposition at the electrode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that water oxidation by 1 was feasible through a proposed catalytic cycle. The formation of an O–O bond was suggested to be the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier of 18.1 kcal mol−1 was in good agreement with that obtained from experiments.
1. Introduction
Development of renewable carbon-free energy from the sun is a major scientific and technological challenge in meeting the energy needs of the future.1–11 Hydrogen (H2) is considered as an ideal energy carrier for our future power plants.12–16 From a more applicable perspective, it is crucial to convert and store solar energy in the form of chemical fuels. Therefore, artificial photosynthesis to split water using the energy of light is a research area of great interest.2–10,17 As part of water splitting, water oxidation to give dioxygen (O2) affords a clean and abundant source of electrons and protons.3,18,19 In nature, the oxidation of water to produce O2 and protons and electrons is a key process happening at the CaMn4Ox active site of Photosystem II.3,20–22 Unlike the reduction of protons, the oxidative reaction leading to O2 production from water is a thermodynamically uphill reaction (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−, ΔEθ = 1.23 V vs. NHE) and is also demanding from the kinetic (significant molecular rearrangement) point of view.6,10,19 As a result, the design of stable and highly efficient catalysts for water oxidation is necessary for solar energy conversion, and has attracted much attention from chemists and material scientists.3–10,23,24
A variety of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) have been reported, including nanostructured metal oxides,4,8,10,18 molecular and supramolecular complexes,6,25–30 and devices made of active WOC species.5,7,31,32 The ease of studying the reaction by spectroscopic methods, tuning the activity via chemical functionalization and combining the catalysts with other devices causes molecular WOCs to be very significant in this area.19,23 In particular, single site WOCs have recently attracted special attention not only because they are capable of catalyzing water oxidation as efficiently as multinuclear metal complexes19,33–39 but also because the research on mononuclear metal complexes has largely improved our understanding of the mechanism of the oxidation reaction of water.19,32,40–43 Although single site WOCs based on noble metal elements have been now well known in the literature, those based on first-row transition metals have received much less attention. There are only a few examples based on iron, copper and cobalt elements. Iron(III) complexes with tetraamido macrocyclic ligands44 and iron(II) complexes with tetradentate nitrogen-based ligands45 were demonstrated to catalyze water oxidation in acidic solution (pH < 2.0). Copper(II) complexes with the 2,2′-bipyridine46 or triglycylglycine macrocyclic ligand47 showed a very high turnover frequency (TOF, 100 s−1 and 33 s−1, respectively) with moderate overpotential (∼750 and ∼520 mV, respectively) in basic solution (pH > 11).
Since the pioneering work on a heterogeneous cobalt–phosphate (Co–Pi) WOC was reported in 2008,18 catalysts made of cobalt have been largely developed.4,24,48,49 Compared to iron and copper, cobalt-based single site WOCs provided good reactivity and stability under neutral pH conditions. The Berlinguette group demonstrated a mononuclear Co(II) pentapyridine complex as a single site WOC at pH 9.2.50,51 In 2011, the Nocera group showed that a Co(III) hangman corrole complex, bearing β-octafluoro and meso-pentafluorophenyl substituents, catalyzed water oxidation at pH 7.0 with a TOF of 0.81 s−1 at an overpotential of ∼780 mV.52 Very recently, the Sakai group reported three water-soluble cobalt porphyrins as homogeneous catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation.53 The second order dependence on catalyst concentration for the rate of water oxidation reaction indicated a bimolecular radical coupling process as the rate-determining step in the Co–porphyrin system. In all these cases, proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes are determined to be involved in the catalytic mechanism.
Design and development of catalysts for proton reduction have been an active research area in the last decade.12–16,54–58 Although many coordination complexes made of diverse transition metal elements and ligands are found to be capable of catalyzing H2 evolution with high efficiency, how to reduce the cost for practical application is still critical.24 Cobalt complexes have been widely examined as molecular catalysts for the production of H2.49 An earlier work was performed by Schrauzer on model compounds for the active site of Vitamin B12,59 which led to the study of bis(dimethylglyoximate)cobalt complexes (termed as cobaloximes) for H2 evolution.54,55,60,61 After that, many cobalt-based molecular catalysts for proton reduction have been discovered, and several excellent review articles have been recently published to summarize the work in this field.24,49,58 In 2013, Dey and co-workers reported a cobalt corrole complex, which could catalyze proton reduction under ambient conditions (i.e. aerobic and using H2O from naturally available sources) with a TOF of 600 s−1.62 However, this work used the high-priced 3,4-difluoropyrrole (>$1000 per gram) to synthesize the β-octafluorocorrole ligand for cobalt.
Despite these achievements in the development of catalysts for water splitting, however, few examples have been demonstrated to use a molecular metal complex as a bifunctional catalyst for both O2 evolution and H2 production.17,19 We report here that a simple cobalt corrole [Co(tpfc)(py)2] (1, tpfc = 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole, py = pyridine) efficiently catalyzes the evolution of both O2 and H2 from aqueous solutions. The use of β-nonfluorinated corrole can substantially reduce the cost of ligand synthesis, which is crucial for practical application of the catalyst. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies suggested that 1 is the real molecular catalyst, and it is stable during both O2 evolution and H2 production processes. A catalytic cycle for water oxidation with 1 was proposed based on the experimental observations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, five manganese corrole analogues were synthesized and their catalytic properties for water oxidation were evaluated. The results showed that these Mn corroles were not stable under our catalytic conditions although their oxidizing powers were comparable to that of 1.
2. Experimental section
2.1 General methods and materials
Manipulations of air- and moisture-sensitive materials were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas using standard Schlenk line techniques. All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received unless otherwise noted. Dry solvents, acetonitrile (MeCN), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dichloromethane (DCM), were purified by passage through activated alumina. Corrole ligands, 5,10,15-triphenylcorrole, 5,15-phenyl-10-(4-nitrophenyl)corrole, 10-phenyl-5,15-(4-nitrophenyl)corrole, 5,10,15-tris(4-nitrophenyl)corrole, and 5,10,15-tris-pentafluorophenylcorrole were synthesized using modified methods reported previously.63–65 Electronic absorption spectra were acquired on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectroscopic measurements were made on a Brüker spectrometer operating at 400 MHz. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Daltonics Inc. BIFLEX III Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer. The morphologies of the ITO surface after electrolysis were examined using a JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The EDX spectra were collected from three randomly selected areas of each sample. In addition, the materials were analyzed at several local spots to ensure their chemical homogeneity. Images were obtained with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV or 10 kV.
2.2 Synthesis of Co–corrole complex 1
Complex 1 was synthesized according to a literature method.66 To a 8.5 mL solution of pyridine, were added Co(OAc)2·4H2O (50 mg, 201 μmol) and 5,10,15-tris-pentafluorophenylcorrole (34 mg, 42.5 μmol), and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 15 min. The solvent was then evaporated, and the purple residue was purified by column chromatography. Recrystallization from DCM/hexane/pyridine (1:1:0.01) afforded red plates of 1 (32.5 mg, yield 76%).661H NMR (400 MHz, [D6]benzene): δ = 9.40 (d, J = 4.3 Hz, 2H), 9.14 (d, J = 4.7 Hz, 2H), 8.95 (d, J = 4.7 Hz, 2H), 8.91 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 4.68 (brs, 2H), 4.08 (brs, 4H), 0.98 (brs, 4H).

2.4 Electrochemistry
All electrochemical experiments were performed using CH Instruments (model CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer). Cyclic voltammograms recorded in acetonitrile (0.1 M Bu4NClO4) used a three-compartment cell possessing a 0.07 cm2 glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation was measured in 0.1 M phosphate (or acetate) buffer, and either 0.5 M H2SO4 or 0.5 M KOH was used for pH adjustment in pH dependent measurements. Electrocatalytic activity for proton reduction was measured in a deoxygenated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The counter electrode was a Pt wire and the reference was the Ag/AgCl electrode from BAS instruments. The solution was bubbled with N2 for 30 min before analysis. The O2 and H2 produced during electrocatalysis were detected using a SP-6890 Gas Chromatograph.
2.5 Crystallographic studies
The complete data set for Co–corrole complex 1 (CCDC 967549) was collected. Single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were coated with Paratone-N oil, suspended in a small fiber loop, and placed in a cooled gas stream at 153(2) K on a Brüker APEX CCD X-ray diffractometer. Diffraction intensities were measured using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data collection, indexing, data reduction and final unit cell refinements were carried out using APEX2;67 absorption corrections were applied using the program SADABS.68 The structure was solved with direct methods using SHELXS69 and refined against F2 on all data by full-matrix least squares using SHELXL,70 following established refinement strategies. Crystallographic studies revealed that complex 1 crystallized in the triclinic space group P. There are two molecules of 1 in the asymmetric unit (Z = 4). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms binding to carbon were included in the model at geometrically calculated positions and refined using a riding model. The isotropic displacement parameters of all hydrogen atoms were fixed to 1.2 times the U value of the atoms they are linked to. Details of the data quality and a summary of the residual values of the refinements are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
2.6 DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 software package.71 The M06-L functional was used for all the calculations.72 In the calculations of standard reduction potential and pKa, geometry optimization and frequency calculations were performed in the gas-phase using the def-SVP basis set.73 The energy was corrected by using a larger basis set def-TZVP.74 The Gibbs free energies in the gas-phase were calculated by adding the gas-phase total energy at the def-TZVP level with the gas-phase thermal correction to the Gibbs free energy at 298 K. By using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM),75 the solvent effects were considered through single-point energy calculations. The redox potential of the reaction, R(aq) → O(aq) + ne−(g)(1)relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) can be computed as: (2)where ΔGθsol is the free energy change associated with the redox couple in the solvent, ΔGθNHE is the free energy change for NHE, which is −4.28 eV based on Boltzmann statistics for the electron,76,77F is the Faraday constant and n is the number of electrons involved in the redox couple. In the present study, ΔGθsol was calculated by adding the free energy change in the gas phase (ΔGθgas) and the difference in solvation free energies (ΔΔGsolv), ΔGθsol = ΔGθgas + ΔΔGsolv(3)
The solvation free energy change was calculated as the adjustment by compressing an ideal gas from 24.5 L to 1.0 L, which is RTln(24.5) or 1.9 kcal mol−1,77–79 plus the 1 M to 1 M transfer free energy computed from the CPCM model. For a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, BH(ag) → B(aq) + H+(aq) + e−(g)(4)the standard free energy of a proton in solution () is needed. Here, a value of −272.2 kcal mol−1 was used, by adding the free energy of solvation of a proton (−265.9 kcal mol−1)80 and the gas-phase Gibbs free energy of the proton (−6.3 kcal mol−1).81 The measured redox potential E under experimental pH conditions is related to standard conditions (pH = 0) using the Nernst equation: (5)where ne and nH+ are the number of electrons and protons involved in the redox reaction, respectively. In the present study, the experimental pH value of 7.0 was used. For an acid–base equilibrium in solution: BH+(aq) → B(aq) + H+(aq)(6)the change in standard free energy is related to the pKa by pKa = ΔGsol/(RTln10)(7)where ΔGsol = ΔGθsol + RTln(10) × pH.
For the O–O bond formation and O2 release processes, the solvent effect was considered in the geometry optimization at the M06-L/def-SVP level.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
Cobalt corroles (or porphyrins) have been known to be very active for the reduction of O2,82–84 which is the reverse reaction of O2 evolution. Previous results based on our theoretical studies suggested that cobalt would be the best transition metal in corrole macrocycles for water oxidation among metal elements known to be active for this process (Co, Fe, Mn, Ru, and Ir).85 In order to experimentally compare the activity of different transition metal corroles, we synthesized Co-corrole 1 and Mn-corrole 2 using ligand tpfc. Reaction of cobalt acetate and H3tpfc afforded red crystals of 1 in 76% yield,66 and a similar reaction with manganese acetate gave 2 in 85% yield. X-ray diffraction studies of 1 revealed that the Co atom was located perfectly in the plane defined by the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle, and there were two additional Co-bound pyridine ligands giving an octahedral coordination (Fig. 1, crystal data and structure refinement parameters are summarized in Table S1, ESI†). The short Co–N(pyrrole) bond distances (1.879(7) Å by average) and long Co–N(pyridine) bond lengths (1.992(7) and 1.998(8) Å) are indicative of a d6 Co(III) electronic structure. Consistent with its Cs symmetry, there are four β-pyrrole-CH doublets in the 1H NMR, and the signals of Co-bound pyridines are located at high field due to the diamagnetic current effect of the corrole macrocycle (Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  The thermal ellipsoid plot (30% probability) of Co–tpfc complex 1. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. 
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1 in a 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile solution at a glassy carbon (GC) electrode showed two reversible waves at E1/2 = 0.38 and 0.94 V vs. ferrocene (Fig. 2, Table 1). Previous spectroscopic and DFT studies on a “CoIV” corrole with an axially ligated chloride, indicated that it is better described as [CoIIICl–corrole˙+].84 In the case of complex 1, our theoretical results also suggested that the first oxidation was corrole-centered (vide infra). The CV of 2 showed two comparable redox events at E1/2 = 0.26 V and Epa = 0.80 V vs. ferrocene (Fig. 2). In addition to 1 and 2 with tpfc, we synthesized Mn–corrole complexes 3–6 using a series of corrole ligands with different combinations of phenyl and 4-nitrophenyl substituents at the meso positions of the macrocycle (Scheme 1). As can be seen from Table 1, the introduction of nitro units at para positions of meso-phenyl groups increases the oxidizing potential of metal corrole complexes (CVs of 3–6 are shown in ESI†).

3.2 Electrocatalytic water oxidation
Cyclic voltammetric studies of 1–6 in acetonitrile indicated that all six complexes have sufficient oxidizing power for water oxidation, and thus they are potential WOCs. Therefore, we tried to examine their electrochemistry in aqueous solutions. Catalyst-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes were prepared by dropping 25 μL of DCM solution containing 0.1 mM of the catalyst directly onto an ITO-coated glass slide. Slow evaporation at room temperature gave a thin film with 2.5 nmol of the catalyst per square centimetre. As shown in Fig. 3, by immersing an electrode coated with 1 into a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0), a significant rise of the current starts at ∼1.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). This catalytic process begins to occur ∼0.53 V beyond the thermodynamic requirement for water oxidation (0.62 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH = 7), and this number is comparable to the lowest value recently reported for molecular WOCs.50,52 The current at E = 1.15–1.40 V corresponds to catalytic water oxidation instead of auxiliary chemical processes on the electrode as there are no changes in successive cycles of CVs (Fig. S3, ESI†). This result also indicates that the Co–corrole catalyst 1 is stable during catalytic water oxidation (vide infra). The electrocatalytic properties of Mn–corroles 2–6 were also examined. Compared to Co–corrole 1, all Mn–corroles 2–6 investigated here exhibited much smaller currents and larger overpotentials (Fig. 3a). In addition, the catalytic current at E = 1.40 V for complexes 2–6 constantly decreased over several cycles of CVs (Fig. S3, ESI†), which suggested that Mn–corrole catalysts 2–6 might decompose on the electrode during the oxidation of water. As a result, only Co–corrole 1 will be discussed in the following experiments.
 Fig. 3  (a) CVs of the ITO background (black) and the ITO electrode coated with complex 1 (red) or 2 (blue) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 7. The loaded catalyst was 2.5 nmol cm−2, and the ITO area is 0.2 cm2. (b) O2 gas bubbles formed on the 1-coated ITO electrode at 1.40 V. (c) CVs of 1 in 0.1 M phosphate (red) or acetate (blue) buffer. (d) Gas chromatography detection of evolved O2 during electrolysis with 1 (red) at 1.40 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the theoretical amount of O2 produced (black). 
The onset potential for water oxidation catalyzed by 1 is pH dependent (Fig. 4). In the range of pH = 6.0–14.0, a plot of the potential (measured at i = 75 μA) vs. pH shows a monotonic decrease with a slope of −67 mV per pH unit (Fig. 4). This pH dependence of water oxidation suggests that a PCET process is involved in the catalytic mechanism.52 The possibility that Co–Pi films generated from decomposition of complex 1 and deposited on the electrode are responsible for the catalytic activity at pH = 7.0 is ruled out. First, the CV of 1 is different to that of Co–Pi films and lacks an anodic wave at E = 1.13 V.18 Second, no differences are observed in successive cycling experiments (Fig. S3, ESI†). Third, similar electrochemical behavior is obtained by using an acetate buffer (Fig. 3c). Fourth, there is no catalytic current if the ITO-electrode is rinsed with DCM after several cycles of CVs. In addition to the pH dependence, the rate of water oxidation with 1 was greatly enhanced by increasing the phosphate concentration (Fig. S8, ESI†). This result indicates that a concerted atom-proton transfer (APT) pathway may be involved in the key O–O bond formation process.32,42 Phosphate may act as a base to catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the water molecule by accepting one proton.42 As should be demonstrated later by our theoretical studies, the base-assisted O–O bond formation is the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation.
 Fig. 4  Left: CVs of 1 in aqueous solutions at different pH values (7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 from right to left). The loaded catalyst was 2.5 nmol cm−2, and the ITO area is 0.2 cm2. Scan rate is 50 mV s−1. Right: the slope of potential (measured at 75 μA) vs. pH is determined to be −67 mV per pH unit. 
In order to further confirm the stability of 1 during catalysis and examine its efficiency for catalytic water oxidation, electrolysis at a constant potential (1.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was performed in an aqueous solution (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 7) under nitrogen. As shown in Fig. 3b, a large number of O2 gas bubbles are generated on the surface of an ITO electrode upon initiation of electrolysis. By using a gastight electrochemical cell, the amount of O2 that formed can be quantitatively determined by analyzing the headspace using gas chromatography, which gives a Faradaic efficiency greater than 95% (Fig. 3d). There are six lines of evidence that suggest complex 1 is the real WOC and is stable during this electrocatalytic O2 evolution process. First, there was no decay of the catalytic current observed during 250 min electrolysis (Fig. 5a and b). Second, the CVs of the 1-coated ITO electrode were identical before and after electrolysis (Fig. 5c). Third, after electrolysis, the electrode was carefully washed with water and DCM. This electrode exhibited no catalytic current in new CV experiments (Fig. 5d), indicating that no cobalt oxide particles formed as a result of possible decomposition of 1 during electrolysis. Fourth, the washed ITO electrode after electrolysis was examined by SEM and EDX methods (Fig. S4, ESI†), which showed very similar features compared to the bare ITO surface. Fifth, the recovered catalyst after electrolysis was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 6a) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which identified the presence of complex 1. Sixth, CV of a bare ITO electrode in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with addition of 0.5 nmol Co(OAc)2 (the same amount of Co ions as a 1-coated ITO has) showed no catalytic current. This result indicated that the activity we observed for 1-coated ITO was not due to free Co ions that may have been possibly released from decomposed species of 1.

(b) Titration studies showed the changes in UV-vis upon addition of pyridine to the DCM solution of 1. 
In the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 in DCM, there are four major absorption bands with maxima at 384, 442, 584, and 602 nm, respectively, and their intensities are highly dependent on the coordination of pyridine to the Co center. Upon dissociation of pyridine, the absorption at 384 nm increases while that at 442 nm decreases.66 In contrast, by adding pyridine to a DCM solution of 1, these changes can be reversed (Fig. 6b). Based on our spectroscopic studies, complex 1 lost at least one of its pyridines during catalysis. This change in the Co coordination is considered to be critical for the activation of water (vide infra). After the verification that water oxidation was catalyzed by molecular complex 1, the turnover frequency (TOF) for this 4e−/4H+ process was calculated to be 0.20 s−1 at 1.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
3.3 Electrocatalytic proton reduction
Coordination cobalt complexes have been shown to be very efficient in catalyzing the reduction of proton to H2.49,54,55,57,61 The formation of Co(I) intermediates in the catalytic cycle has been suggested by spectroscopic methods, and this Co(I) state was believed to be the active form for catalysis.55,57 By using a fully fluorinated Co–corrole complex, catalytic H2 evolution was recently demonstrated in aqueous solutions.62 Based on spectroscopic data and theoretical studies, a Co(I)–corrole was also suggested to be the intermediate that reacted with a proton to give a Co(III)-hydride species. As its β-nonfluorinated analogue, complex 1 costs much less and is more readily available. In addition, it is expected that Co(I) in β-nonfluorinated corrole will have stronger reducing power. Previous studies by Gross and co-workers revealed that complex 1 in a degassed acetonitrile solution showed an irreversible Co(III/II) redox couple at −0.20 V (vs. SCE) and a reversible Co(II/I) redox couple at −1.25 V (vs. SCE),66 which is 0.25 V more negative than its fluorinated analogue. It was also observed that the Co(III/II) reduction peak of 1 is strongly affected by the addition of external pyridine, which was consistent with the dissociation of pyridine from the Co center of 1 in solution.
Catalytic proton reduction was performed in a 0.50 M sulfuric acid solution (pH = 0.5) using a GC electrode coated with complex 1 (ca. 0.10 nmol). As shown in Fig. 7, a large electrocatalytic current started to grow at −0.90 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), accompanied by the formation of numerous gas bubbles on the surface of the GC electrode. This result indicates that H2 evolution is correlated with the reduction of Co(II) to Co(I).62 Possible auxiliary chemical processes on the electrode were not likely because no changes were observed in several successive cycles of CVs, which also indicated that no degradation of complex 1 took place during catalytic proton reduction. Similar to water oxidation, the stability of 1 in electrocatalysis for proton reduction was further established based on our experimental observations. In a 9.0 h electrolysis under anaerobic conditions at −1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the catalytic currents of complex 1 remained almost constant (Fig. 8a). The resultant 1-coated GC electrode had identical behaviors in CV compared to the electrode before a 9.0 h electrolysis (Fig. 8c). The recovered complex 1 after electrolysis was also identified by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 8d), which showed the loss of its Co-bound pyridines during catalysis (see above).

Hydrogen gas that evolved from proton reduction was detected and quantified by using gas chromatography (Fig. 8b). Electrolysis at −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) gave a Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen production greater than 96%. With the establishment of catalytic H2 production with 1, the TOF can be calculated to be 1010 s−1 and 6150 s−1 at −1.0 V and −1.1 V, respectively, under anaerobic conditions at room temperature. These values are comparable to those using its fluorinated analogue (600 s−1 and 1140 s−1 at −0.7 V and −0.8 V, respectively).62 The higher onset potential observed for water reduction using complex 1 compared to its fluorinated analogue is a result of the shift of the Co(II/I) redox process of 1 towards the negative direction by about 0.25 V.
3.4 Theoretical studies
In order to better understand the reaction mechanism of water splitting catalyzed by 1, DFT calculations were carried out. Since H2 evolution catalyzed by the β-fluorinated analogue of 1 was recently studied computationally,62 we therefore focus on the mechanism of water oxidation to form O2. Fig. 9 shows the calculated reaction cycle starting from a CoIII–corrole species [Cor–CoIII–OH2], which has a water molecule and a pyridine as axial ligands. For simplicity, the pyridine ligand was omitted in the nomenclature. In previous theoretical studies by us85 and other groups78 on the water oxidation catalyzed by a cobalt hangman corrole, a cobalt–oxo species formed from the [Cor–CoIII–OH2] complex via 2e−/2H+ oxidation processes was found to be the active species for the O–O bond formation. Therefore, we first studied the 2e−/2H+ oxidation processes of [Cor–CoIII–OH2], which has a close-shell singlet ground state. The free energy changes for sequential electron and proton transfers were expressed as standard reduction potentials or pKa, and they are given in Fig. 9. Here, we focused on two sequential 1e−/1H+ oxidation steps, which result in the formation of [Cor˙+–CoIII–OH] and [Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−], respectively. The former species has a doublet ground state, while the latter one, [Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−], has a triplet ground state. The calculated redox potentials at pH = 7.0 are 0.45 and 1.37 V (vs. NHE) for the [Cor–CoIII–OH2]/[Cor˙+–CoIII–OH] and [Cor˙+–CoIII–OH]/[Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−] couples, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the experimental values of 0.78 and 1.34 V (vs. NHE) obtained from cyclic voltammetric studies of 1 in acetonitrile.

The oxo radical moiety of the two-electron oxidized species [Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−] can undergo nucleophilic attack by a water molecule (so-called water nucleophilic attack, WNA), accompanied by a concerted proton transfer. Previous studies suggested that the first and perhaps other solvation shells may play a decisive role in proton transfer as part of this O–O bond formation step.27,30,77–79,81,86–88 As such, we first investigated the WNA reaction by including a cluster of four water molecules. The transition state (TS) was located and shown in Fig. 10a. The O–O bond length in this TS was found to be 1.83 Å. The calculated reaction barrier of 29.9 kcal mol−1 is high, which is about 26 kcal mol−1 higher than that for the cobalt hangman corrole system, in which the pendant carboxylate group acts as an intramolecular base to assist the proton transfer of the attacking water molecule.85 It was demonstrated by Meyer and co-workers that added bases could catalyze WNA by acting as proton acceptors for the attacking water molecule. The acceleration of water oxidation with added bases was due to an additional, base-dependent pathway.32,42
 Fig. 10  Water nucleophilic attack transition state structure of (a) [Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−] with four water molecules and (b) [Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−] in the presence of an OAc− as the base. 
Therefore, we subsequently considered the WNA reaction in the presence of an external base, such as phosphate or acetate, which was used as supporting electrolytes. Our calculations showed that the inclusion of an acetate ion significantly lowered the reaction barrier to 18.1 kcal mol−1. The TS structure with an acetate ion (Fig. 10b) shows a longer O–O bond distance at 2.01 Å, indicating an earlier TS compared with that for [Cor˙+–CoIII–O˙−] with four water molecules. Importantly, this calculated barrier is in a good agreement with the experimental activation barrier for water oxidation (18.4 kcal mol−1 estimated from TOF = 0.2 s−1 using transition state theory). Attempts to include a phosphate ion in the calculation as an added base were not successful due to a severe self-interaction error for the reactant complex.
To release oxygen and regenerate the catalyst, we determined that a subsequent PCET reaction generates [Cor–CoIII–OO˙−]1− at a favorable potential, −0.56 V. The [Cor–CoIII–OO˙−]1− intermediate could undergo further oxidation to yield [Cor˙+–CoIII–OO˙−] at a potential of −0.02 V. The resulting [Cor˙+–CoIII–OO˙−] species was found to be able to release O2 through the displacement with water, a process having a small energy barrier of 3.6 kcal mol−1. Clearly, our calculations demonstrated that the water oxidation by 1 is feasible. It can be also seen from Fig. 9 that the O–O formation step is the rate-determining step, and the calculated reaction barrier is in good agreement with the experimental activation barrier for water oxidation.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we report here a simple bifunctional cobalt corrole catalyst for O2 evolution and H2 production. The β-nonfluorinated cobalt corrole 1 can catalyze both water oxidation and proton reduction efficiently. A catalytic cycle for water oxidation with 1 is proposed based on our experimental and DFT studies. Key points include: (1) the dissociation of a Co-bound pyridine group and PCET steps were involved in the catalytic mechanism; (2) the dependence of the water oxidation rate on phosphate concentration suggested that an additional, base-dependent APT process contributed to the rate-determining O–O bond formation step; (3) the calculated activation barrier of 18.1 kcal mol−1 for the rate-determining O–O bond formation was in good agreement with the estimated value from experiments (18.4 kcal mol−1 based on TOF = 0.20 s−1 for this 4e−/4H+ process). In addition, complex 1 can catalyze the reduction of the proton to H2 with the TOF of 1010 s−1 and 6150 s−1 at −1.0 V and −1.1 V, respectively. Compared to its β-fluorinated analogue, although complex 1 has a more negative onset potential by 0.25 V in electrocatalytic proton reduction, its β-nonfluorinated corrole ligand costs much less. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies suggested that 1 is the real molecular catalyst for both reactions, and it was stable during the catalysis of water splitting.
