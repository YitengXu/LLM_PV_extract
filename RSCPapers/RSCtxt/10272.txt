Different types of linkages in terms of configuration and proper bridging lead to several types of discrete linear or cyclic macromolecular aggregates with different sizes, which consequently have a significant effect on their properties. The Re-backbone in the multinuclear assembly may have only a structural role and mainly exhibits host–guest behaviour for encapsulation, or it may produce photofunctional properties as a direct result of the Re(I) chromophoric unit, which makes these compounds applicable in light-harvesting systems or photochemical CO2 reduction. In particular, we would like to emphasize bisphosphine-bridged multinuclear complexes that exhibit outstanding photophysical properties.Jana RohacovaDr Jana Rohacova was born in the Czech Republic and graduated in organic chemistry and pharmacochemistry from the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague.

1. Introduction
Rhenium(I) complexes occupy a prominent position in organometallic compounds with d6-electron configurations.1 Among these, the fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3L]n+ family (N^N = bidentate diimine ligand, such as 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline; n = 0: L = anionic ligand, such as Cl−, Br−, SCN−, or CN−; n = 1: L = ligand without charge, such as PR3 and N-heterocyclic ligand) and the cis,trans-[Re(N^N)(CO)2(PR3)2]+ family have attracted special interest due to their rich excited-state behaviour.1–5 Such properties can be widely tuned by modification of the ligand and the medium; this was demonstrated in the pioneering work by Wrighton and his co-workers6 and over decades has been extended by other groups. Typically, the low-lying excited state of these compounds is attributed to a triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) excited state, which in some cases has weak or strong interligand excited state characteristics. Many such Re complexes show long-lived and strong room-temperature luminescence even in solution, governed by the energy gap law,7 and they are one of the few classes of metal carbonyl compounds that exhibit these properties. The tuneable photophysical properties, chemical stability and synthetic flexibility of such Re compounds give them enormous potential in applications such as luminescent probes for sensing and biological labelling,8,9 electroluminescence devices,10 and photocatalysts or photosensitizers in solar energy conversion processes such as H2 evolution,11,12 photocatalytic CO2 reduction11,13 and dye-sensitized solar cells.14
Interest in multinuclear transition-metal complexes performing light- and/or redox-induced functions has also garnered attention because of their potential applications, such as artificial light-harvesting antennae, light-emitting devices and molecular-scale photonic and charge transport wires, molecular switches and molecular devices featuring information-storage functions.15–18 Since such systems consisting of multi metal-complex units can be expected to exhibit interactions through bonds between metals and ligands or non-covalent interactions, they may have new effects on their properties, especially the rates of energy and electron transfer processes across the whole assembly.19–21 In general, and considering the group of diimine metal complexes, such photofunctional polynuclear complexes, reported on mainly Ru(II), can be categorized as follows:22 (1) polymers constructed of organic units such as polystyrene, in which metal complexes are coordinated to pendant diimine/N-ligand groups, (2) π-conjugated oligomers or (co)polymers with coordinating diimine units in a main chain,23,24 including racks and dendrimer-like25,26 and (3) metal ions incorporated into the main strand of a multinuclear entity.
There is a very limited number of photofunctional transition metal polynuclear complexes or polymers categorized in (3) and this is probably due to the difficulty of synthesis, even though they should have unique properties because of the contribution of the d-orbitals in the transition metal ions to the main chain. Polynuclear compounds constructed of Re(I) diimine carbonyl complex units are one of the exceptions; various emissive linear-, square- and ring-shaped multinuclear Re complexes have been reported so far. In this perspective, we summarized the syntheses, photophysics and applications of such photofunctional multinuclear Re(I) diimine carbonyl complexes, some of which have different and remarkable photophysical and photochemical properties compared to the parent Re(I) monomers.
2. Synthesis of fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3L]n+ and their reactivity
From the viewpoint of synthesis, Re(I) diimine carbonyl complexes are suitable as monomeric units for constructing polynuclear scaffolds since diverse ligands can be introduced step-by-step. Two directional-types of basic structures of the Re(I) diimine carbonyl complexes have been differentiated: fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3L]n+, which can be used as a corner with an L-shape (Chart 1A) and cis,trans-[ReI(N^N)(CO)2(L)2]n+, which can be used as a central unit with a linear- or T-shape dimension (Chart 1B).
 Chart 1  Structures of L-shaped (A) and linear or T-shaped (B) Re(I)-carbonyl complex units. 
As outlined in Scheme 1, the reaction of [Re(CO)5X] (X = Cl and Br) with 2 eq. of pyridine derivatives (Xpy) or 1 eq. of bidentate aromatic diimine (N^N) under mild reaction conditions gives fac-[ReI(Xpy)2(CO)3X] or fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3X] (Step 1). Exchange of the halogen atom for a weakly coordinating ligand such as OTf− (Step 2) can afford a complex that is an important platform for constructing multinuclear complexes (Step 3). Although no suitable methods were available for further selective substitution of one of the CO ligands, we successfully developed two methods for this: (1) for the type of fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3(PR3)]+ with a phosphine ligand, the CO ligand in the trans position of the PR3 ligand can be photochemically substituted with various substrates (L′) giving cis,trans-[ReI(N^N)(CO)2(PR3)(L′)]n+;27 (2) by using a mild selective decarbonylation reagent Me3NO,28 a wider range of Re diimine tricarbonyl complexes can be selectively converted to cis,trans-[ReI(N^N)(CO)2(L)(L′)]n+. Both syntheses are described in detail later for specific complexes.

The simplest connection patterns between two Re-diimine complexes can be categorized into three types (direct Re–Re bonded and μ-bridged dimers are excluded): (a) usage of a multiple N^N ligand through either an alkyl chain or an aromatic multi-condensation (1a and 1b in Chart 2)29,30 or a double link with longer bended N^N (1c in Chart 2),31,32 (b) usage of a bidentate axial ligand BL (2 in Chart 2),33–35 and (c) a combination of methods (a) and (b), which gives metallacycles where two metal centres share both the N^N ligand and the axial ligand.36 It is noteworthy that in the case of category 1, there is another substitutable ligand, i.e. ‘X’ in Scheme 1.

3. Multinuclear complexes with P-linkages
Re(I) complexes with a phosphine ligand, fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3(PR3)]+,37 which can be synthesized in an analogous way to the L = N-ligand (Step 3 in Scheme 1), exhibit more intense emission from their longer-lived 3MLCT excited states compared to other fac-[Re(N^N)(CO)3L]n+ (L = Cl−, Br−, n = 0; L = N-ligand, n = 1) mainly for the following two reasons; (1) the excitation energies (E00) of fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3(PR3)]+ are higher owing to the higher ligand fields of the phosphine ligands and (2) inter-ligand interactions occur between aromatic groups in the N^N ligand and the aromatic groups in the PR3 ligand if this has at least two aryl groups. Since the latter phenomenon is also important for understanding the photophysical properties of the multinuclear Re complexes, we will mention it in more detail later.
Application of photochemical ligand substitution (PLS), as described in the Synthesis section, can afford biscarbonyl bisphosphine Re(I) complexes, cis,trans-[ReI(N^N)(CO)2(PR3)(PR′3)]+ (Scheme 2). They are photochemically more stable and their visible-light absorption is red-shifted compared to the corresponding fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3(PR3)]+-type complexes because of the weaker ligand field of the phosphine ligands compared to that of the carbonyl ligand in these cases.38,39
 Scheme 2  Photochemical ligand substitution (PLS) reaction and Jablonski diagram of the process. 
The aforementioned interligand interaction between the N^N ligand and the aromatic groups of the PR3 ligands is stronger for cis,trans-[ReI(N^N)(CO)2(PR3)(PR′3)]+ giving ‘unusual’ photophysical and redox properties, i.e. a red-shift of the absorption but a blue-shift of the emission, a longer lifetime of the 3MLCT excited state and stronger oxidation power in the 3MLCT excited state.
A. Linear or T-shaped multinuclear Re(I) complexes
It is noteworthy that all the Re multinuclear complexes with N-linkages have cis-configurations between two N-ligands or between the N^N ligand and another monodentate ligand, except for the CO ligands, which is due to the unfeasible selective substitution of the carbonyls. This should cause less structural variation in this type of Re multinuclear complex. From this viewpoint, cis,trans-[ReI(N^N)(CO)2(PR3)(PR′3)]+-type complexes have a unique structure, which can provide a basis for synthesizing liner and T-shaped multinuclear Re complexes.

The first highly luminescent Re dimers bearing a 2,2′-bipyridyl ligand as N^N were reported in parallel by our40 and Sullivan's41 groups in 2001, in which two Re(I) ions were connected by et or vi P–P ligands, respectively. Photochemical substitution of one of the CO ligands in the trans-position of the bidentate phosphine ligand with an acetonitrile molecule (Scheme 3), which is labile as a ligand, allowed us to prepare a series of trinuclear and tetranuclear complexes by reaction with a mononuclear ‘[Re-(η1-P–P)]’ type complex or dimerization with P–P, respectively.42 The isolated yields of [Ln(N^N)x] (n = number of Re units, N^N and x specify substituted bpy and P–P ligands, respectively) were high for several N^N (Chart 4) and P–P ligands, as summarized in Table 1.

Although the photochemical substitution of one CO ligand from the Re dimers was rapid and quantitative, PLS of the opposite edge CO ligand in the trans-position of the bidentate phosphine ligand was much slower because of energy transfer from the non-substituted Re unit to the CO-substituted unit; this type of intramolecular energy transfer is discussed in detail later. Although prolonged irradiation finally yielded the substitution product of both the terminal axial CO ligands, this reaction was accompanied by one more undesired equatorial CO replacement to yield a green by-product with a monocarbonyl Re unit. Interestingly, we can suppress this side reaction by replacing the acetonitrile solvent with acetone–water, and [Lnx] can be almost exclusively converted into the target [Lnx-(Solv)2] (n ≥ 2).
An attempt to synthesize larger Re oligomers and polymers was successful42 as a result of applying Balzani's concept, the so-called complex as metal and complex as ligand.25 For example, a reaction of a mixture of [L3ac-CH3CN] and [L3ac-(CH3CN)2] as complex as ligand with a dinuclear complex with a η1-bisphosphine ligand at one edge, i.e. [L2ac-η1-ac] as complex as metal gave penta-[L5ac] and heptanuclear [L7ac] complexes (Scheme 4A). Analogously, the reaction of tetranuclear instead of trinuclear complexes with [L2ac-η1-ac] gave hexanuclear [L6ac] and octanuclear [L8ac] complexes. Reactions of mixtures of tetranuclear [L4ac-CH3CN] + [L4ac-(CH3CN)2] or pentanuclear complexes [L5ac-CH3CN] + [L5ac-(CH3CN)2] with mixtures of tetranuclear or pentanuclear complexes with one and two η1-bisphosphine ligands ([L4ac-η1-ac] + [L4ac-(η1-ac)2] or [L5ac-η1-ac] + [L5ac-(η1-ac)2]) gave mixtures of [Lnac] with n = 8, 12, 16 or 10, 15, 20 and 25 (Scheme 4B).

The separation of each multinuclear complex from the mixtures can be achieved by using size-exclusion chromatography with a column for the separation of proteins and a MeOH–CH3CN eluent containing a CH3COONH4 salt (Fig. 1).43

Photophysical properties. 
All of the linear Re(I) oligomers and polymers with the P–P bridging ligands show absorption spectra with similar shapes but proportionally higher molar extinction coefficients compared to the corresponding mononuclear Re(I) bisphosphine complex, i.e. π–π* absorption with λmax = ca. 300 nm, and MLCT absorption with λmax = ca. 400 nm. Fig. 3 shows the cases with ac as typical examples. These results clearly show that there is no strong electronic interaction through the P–P bridging ligands among the Re(I) units in the multinuclear complexes in the ground state.

All of these Re(I) multinuclear complexes were also emissive at room temperature even in solution. The emission spectra featured non-vibrational bands, which is typical of emission from the lowest 3MLCT excited state of Re(I) complexes. Fig. 4 shows the emission spectra from the linear Re(I) oligo-/polymers with the ac bridging ligands in CH3CN. Table 2 summarizes the photophysical properties of [Lnet] and [Lnac].

An interesting feature is the difference between the Re dimers and the other multinuclear complexes; only the emission from the dimer had a higher energy than the others. This clearly shows that an efficient intramolecular energy transfer proceeded from the edge units with the tricarbonyl structure [Re(bpy)(CO)3(PR2-)]+ to the interior units with the biscarbonyl fragment [Re(bpy)(CO)2(PR2-)2]+. Only in the case of the dimer, the edge units with the [Re(bpy)(CO)3(PR2-)]+ structure could strongly emit owing to lack of the biscarbonyl fragment. The rates of the intramolecular energy transfer were dependent on the P–P ligands and the number of Re units (Table 2). The quantum yields of emission (Φem) decreased as the number of Re(I) units increased. This might be caused by intramolecular aggregation of the Re polymer molecules because the Φem values of the compounds measured with the addition of a non-polar solvent such as toluene were higher than those in CH3CN.
Multiple emission lifetimes were observed for all the Re multinuclear complexes [Lnx] with n ≥ 3 (Table 2). The shortest lifetime of only a few ns is attributed to emission from the edge unit, of which the excited state transfers excitation energy to the interior parts as described above, while other lifetimes of a hundred or several hundreds of ns correspond to emission from the interior regions. The existence of two longer lifetimes for n ≥ 3 suggests that there are at least two conformations of [Lnx] in the solution. The longest lifetime was dominant for [Lnac], while the medium one became the main component for [Lnet]. This can be explained by the existence of interligand interactions not only between the bpy ligand and the phenyl groups of the phosphine ligand but also between the bpy and the ethynylene spacers. This type of interligand interaction significantly prolongs the lifetime of the excited states of various Re(I) diimine complexes with phosphine ligands. In addition to the role of the interligand interaction, direct effects of the electronic properties of the P–P ligands on the photophysical properties were evident, i.e. [Lnac], in which ac is a stronger π-acceptor than et, presented a blue-shift of the emission maxima, a longer lifetime (τem ≈ 0.8 μs), and a high emission quantum yield (Φem up to 0.07) compared to [Lnet] (τem ≈ 0.5 μs, Φem up to 0.01). Finally, the intramolecular energy transfer process from the edge unit to the interior in [Lnac] was faster than in [Lnet]; the rate constants (ket) are summarized in Table 2.
Analogously to those of mononuclear Re complexes, the photophysical properties of the Re multinuclear complexes can also be tuned by modification of the diimine ligands. For example, when electron-donating groups were introduced into the diimine ligands, using 4dmb instead of bpy, emission from [Ln(4dmb)ac] was blue-shifted and this was accompanied by longer emission lifetimes and higher emission quantum yields (Table 2).


Application to light-harvesting molecules and materials. 
In natural photosynthesis, efficient harvesting of solar light is one of the most significant functions.44 To simulate artificial photosynthesis using molecular-based devices, this light harvesting (LH) property is essential because solar light is a very weak energy source from the standpoint of molecules (ca. 10 photons nm−2 s−1). Natural photosynthesis can efficiently accumulate such diluted photons using light antenna systems, which are constructed of assemblies of chlorophyll molecules (Chl) as light absorbers that efficiently transfer the absorbed light energy to the reaction centres (RC).44 For example, purple bacteria have a sequential two-step light energy accumulation system, i.e. LH2 → LH1 → RC. Photons absorbed by several hundreds of Chl located in the LH2 units are quantitatively accumulated by one LH1 unit and then transferred to the RC, which makes a 1:1 pair with LH1 and induces charge separation (Scheme 5). This well-organized system can achieve both the efficient absorption of solar light with many antenna molecules and an adequate frequency of charge separation with a minimum number of RCs, followed by catalytic water oxidation and reduction of the coenzyme NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).44
 Scheme 5  Schematic representation of sequential two-step light energy harvesting in purple bacteria. 
Since, as described above, [Ln(N^N)x] can efficiently transfer energy from the edge units to the interior ones, these compounds were successfully used as photon collectors for constructing a novel type of light-harvesting system. A Ru(II) trisdiimine complex was covalently tethered as an energy acceptor to [Ln(4dmb)ac] (n = 3 and 5) through an ethylene chain on the diimine ligand, yielding T-shaped complexes [L3(4dmb)ac-RuA], [L3(4dmb)ac-RuB] and [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru], as shown in Scheme 6.45

P–P = ac. 
They can absorb a wide range of UV–vis light (Fig. 5A); the strong absorption around 290 nm is attributed to π–π* excitation of the diimine ligands on both the Re(I) and the Ru(II) units, and the absorptions at 330–430 and 400–550 nm correspond to the 1MLCT absorption bands of the Re chain and the Ru(II) unit, respectively. The absorption spectra of these Ru–Re complexes were almost identical to the sum of those of the individual model complexes (Fig. 5A), which indicates that there is no strong electronic interaction between the Ru part and the Re chain in the ground state.
 Fig. 5  UV–vis (A) and emission spectra (B) of [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] and the corresponding model complexes [L5(4dmb)ac] and [Ru(4dmb)3]2+ (all PF6− salts) in degassed CH3CN; the emission spectra were normalized to absorbed photons at λex.

The Ru–Re complexes emitted at room temperature in solution, and the emission was very similar to that from [Ru(4dmb)3]2+ but very different from the emission from the model of the undecorated Re chain, i.e. [Ln(4dmb)ac] (Fig. 5B in the case of [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]). This clearly indicates that the observed emission predominantly originated from the 3MLCT excited state of the Ru(II) unit, even when the Re part was mainly excited. A detailed analysis of the emission kinetics showed that energy transfer from all the Re moieties to the Ru(II) unit took place with an efficiency up to 89%. The rate constants of the energy transfer from each Re unit to the Ru unit and between the Re units are included in Scheme 6.
The Ru–Re mixed multinuclear complex [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru], in which the energy transfer took place with 77% efficiency, was applied as a model of LH1/RC in natural photosynthesis, where the Re chain functions as the LH1 model and the Ru unit functions as the RC model. A periodic mesoporous organosilica was chosen as the LH2 model, where many biphenyl groups were embedded as light absorbers within a silica framework in a dense and ordered manner (Bp-PMO).46 [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] could be efficiently introduced and fixed into the mesopores of Bp-PMO in an orderly fashion with the assistance of a non-ionic surfactant, C12H25(COCH2CH2)4OH, to give a hybrid [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]@Bp-PMO (Fig. 6).47
 Fig. 6  Cartoon of Bp-PMO channel with the adsorbed [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] complex. 
The maximum amount of [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] adsorbed into Bp-PMO at the saturation point was (9.28 ± 0.05) × 10−2 mol g−1. From the crystallographic and physical data of Bp-PMO, the average number of metal-complex molecules adsorbed into a mesopore of Bp-PMO with a length of 10 nm was determined to be 10.4 [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru], which indicates that the metal complexes are densely packed in 2–4 lines in the mesopores without any aggregation. The approximate size of the complex is shown in Fig. 6.
The adsorbed [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] and the absorbed model compounds, i.e. [L5(4dmb)ac] and [Ru(4dmb)3]2+ (Ru), maintained their absorption properties as in the solution (Fig. 7), and these hybrids remained stable in an CH3CN solution.

The sole Bp-PMO emitted by excitation at λex = 266 nm with an emission maximum of 380 nm (blue line in Fig. 8A), which was composed of three types of excimers between two adjacent biphenyl units with τem = 1.3–26.7 ns and Φem = 0.02–0.26.48 The emission from Bp-PMO (λex 266 nm) was substantially quenched as the amount of loaded [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] increased and was accompanied by a new emission band from the adsorbed metal-complex (Fig. 8A).

Almost quantitative quenching of the Bp-PMO emission proceeded in [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]@Bp-PMO with the adsorbed amount of [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] > 0.06 mmol g−1. This clearly indicates that an efficient energy transfer proceeded from the excited biphenyl groups in the walls of Bp-PMO to [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru] in the mesopores. Fig. 8B shows emission spectra from the adsorbed metal complexes in the three types of hybrids; the emission spectrum of [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]@Bp-PMO was more similar to that of Ru@Bp-PMO than that of [L5(4dmb)ac]@Bp-PMO.

Fig. 9 shows transient emission spectra of an [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]@Bp-PMO suspension in an Ar-saturated MeCN solution (λex = 269 nm). Just after excitation, the main component of the emission resulted from the excited biphenyl units with λmax ≈ 360 nm and then disappeared with τem = 0.2 ns. A broad emission band between 500 and 800 nm was also observed, which contained four components. Emission at λmax ≈ 540 nm had three lifetimes (τem = 1.9, 37 and 214 ns), which were attributed to the edge and the two types of interior Re units. Another emission at λmax ≈ 620 nm with τem = 958 ns is attributed to the Ru unit.

The importance of covalent bonding between the Re and Ru moieties within the silica framework was confirmed because energy transfer for a mixture of the model complexes, i.e. [L5(4dmb)ac] and [Ru(4dmb)3]2+ loaded onto Bp-PMO, proceeded with much lower efficiency than that for [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]@Bp-PMO, and emission from both model complexes was observed. From the viewpoint of light harvesting, it should be noted that in the [L5(4dmb)ac-Ru]@Bp-PMO hybrid, more than 400 biphenyl units collect photons and efficiently transfer photon energy step-by-step, firstly to 5 units of the Re chain and then accumulate to one unit of the Ru complex, as the main emitter. This should be an artificial model of the LH2–LH1–RC system in natural photosynthesis as described above (Scheme 7).

B. Ring-shaped Re(I) multinuclear complexes
As described in section A, the linear-type Re(I) multinuclear complexes did not possess real linear structural shapes, but they were of U-shapes of the Re trimers and holding structures of the Re tetramers in the crystal form. It is logically expected that cyclic, so-called ring-shaped, Re(I) multinuclear complexes can be synthesized if both edge units of the linear-type Re(I) multinuclear complexes can be connected to each other. We can expect that these Re-rings have interesting features, e.g. (1) each Re unit in the Re-rings has the same structure and possibly similar photophysical and electrochemical properties with a lack of energy transfer, unlike the linear precursor; (2) the structures of the Re-rings should be more rigid compared to those of the corresponding linear-types and (3) each Re unit in the Re-rings might be used as a unique redox photosensitizer.

Synthesis. 
Various types of Re-rings with [Re(bpy)(CO)2]-repeating units, [Rnx] (n is the number of Re units, x denotes P–P), were synthesized by three methods. The initial approach used a dinuclear complex linked with an appropriate P–P ligand; after removal of both terminal carbonyls, the dinuclear complex reacted with P–P under reflux conditions to give a mixture of Re-rings with various but even numbers of Re units (Scheme 8A).49 The unit number strongly depended on P–P: short and long alkyl chains in the P–P bridging ligands allowed the synthesis of lower n-membered rings, while medium length chains afforded larger Re-rings with up to ten Re units, as compared in Table 3. The separation of each ring could be effectively achieved by size-exclusion chromatography under the same conditions as those explained in the section on the synthesis of the linear Re multinuclear complexes.

In the second method, longer linear-type Re multinuclear complexes were used as starting compounds instead of the Re dimers (Scheme 8B).49–51 This allowed the synthesis of Re-rings with three Re units, and higher yields of the Re rings could be obtained in many cases (Table 3). It is also applicable for the synthesis of some heteroleptic Re-rings, e.g. a trinuclear et-based ring, of which the Re units had one bpy and two 4dmb ligands.50 Hence, both approaches led to a large series of [Rnx] having all types of spacers in P–P.
In the synthesis of some bpy-modified Re-rings, such as [R3(5mxb)ph] and [R3(tmb)ph], the yields of the PLS reactions were unfortunately low because of the decomposition of the corresponding linear Re trimers under irradiation. Therefore, a new one-pot synthetic method that did not involve the photochemical reaction was developed (Scheme 8C);52 tricarbonyl Re(I)-diimine complexes fac-[Re(N^N)(CO)3(η1-ph)]+ were reacted with Me3NO, which is an effective decarbonylation reagent for metal carbonyl complexes, affording the corresponding biscarbonyl-Re(I) mononuclear complex cis,trans-[Re(N^N)(CO)2(η1-ph)(L)]+ (L = solvent or Me3N) as a building block with the labile ligand L. These reactions proceeded quantitatively even under mild conditions. Prolonged reflux with no additional reagents led to both coupling and cyclization, affording the corresponding trinuclear Re-ring [R3(N^N)ph] as the major product, with larger linear and eventually ring-shaped Re(I) multinuclear complexes as minor products. This high selectivity should be reasonable because of the highly symmetrical structure of the trinuclear Re-rings with the ph ligands as described below. The new Re-rings were successfully isolated by size exclusion chromatography in ca. 20% yield.


Structure. 
The X-ray structures of [R2bu], [R3pr], and [R4et] showed that the diimine and phosphine ligands are closely packed and that both the bpy ligands and the Ph groups of the phosphine ligands are located on the periphery of the ring (Fig. 10A–C). On the other hand, the hexanuclear complex [R6bu] contains a large inner space with a diameter of ∼6 Å and should therefore have a more flexible structure (Fig. 10D). In the rings with only a small inner space, steric hindrance should direct both the diimine ligand and the phenyl groups towards the outer side even in solution, and interligand interactions between them should be larger. The effects of this on the photophysical and electrochemical properties are discussed later.

Hydrogen atoms, counter ions and solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. Gray, blue, red, orange, and pink correspond to C, N, O, P, and Re atoms, respectively. 
The Re-rings with ph as the bridging ligands had unique structures. In the case of [R3ph] (Fig. 11A and B), all three bridging phenylene groups and the three Re cations created a flat plane and were fixed perpendicularly between the carbonyl ligands directed towards the inside of the inner cavity whose interior diameter was ∼5.5 Å. This orientation provided an almost perfectly symmetrical hexagonal plane structure, in which two pendant phenyl groups of ph were located close to the bpy ligand, which induces a strong interligand interaction. On the other hand, [R4ph] had a chair-like conformation with different spatial distances between two opposite Re centres (Fig. 11C).
 Fig. 11  Side (A) and top views (B) of the molecular structure of [R3ph] (CCDC 1407198) and side view of the molecular structure of [R4ph] (C) (CCDC 1407200). Hydrogen atoms, counterions and solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. Gray, blue, red, orange, and pink correspond to C, N, O, P, and Re atoms, respectively. 
The FT-IR spectra of the cis,trans-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(PR3)(PR′3)]+-type complexes measured in solution usually display two characteristic carbonyl peaks between 2000 and 1850 cm−1 with similar intensities, which are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes, respectively.38 Interestingly, in the cases of the smaller Re-rings, such as [R3x] (x = et, pr, vi and ac) and [R4ac], each peak was structured or broadened. This observation suggests the existence of different conformers of Re(I) units even in a single molecule of these Re-rings in solution, but they could not be distinguished on the NMR time scale.


Photophysical properties. 
The absorption spectra of all the Re-rings with unsubstituted bpy ligands displayed an interligand transition of the bpy at λmax ≈ 300 nm and a longer wavelength Re(dπ) → bpy(π*) 1MLCT transition at λmax ≈ 400 nm (Fig. 12 shows the [Rnpr] series as a representative example).

All of these emitted at room temperature in solution, and the emission spectra showed a broad and non-structured band from the 3MLCT excited state maxima between 543–634 nm. These photophysical properties, including emission lifetimes, are summarized in Table 4.

The absorption and emission spectra and emission lifetimes of the series of Re-rings connected with alkyl chains in the P–P ligands were strongly affected by the differences in the number of Re(I) units and the length of P–P.
Re-rings such as [R2bu], [R3pr] and [R4et] (Fig. 10A–C), which do not have a wide cavity in the central space owing to a small number of Re(I) units and/or P–P ligands with a short alkyl chain, emitted much more strongly compared to the corresponding mononuclear complex and the linear Re oligomers. On the other hand, the other Re-rings exhibited photophysical properties similar to those of the models. As an example, Fig. 13A shows the emission spectra of [Rnbu] (n = 2, 3, 4 and 6) along with those of the corresponding Re(I) mononuclear complex (cis,trans-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(PPh2Et)2]+). The emission quantum yield of [R2bu] (Φem = 0.081) was about 5-fold greater and its emission maximum was blue-shifted by about 20 nm compared to the other complexes. Based on the results of time-resolved transient IR measurement of [R2bu], it was determined that 3MLCT occurs in only one of the Re units in which P–Re–P angle is significantly bended, thereby producing a structural deformation of the second part to reduce the overall tension. One of the reasons of the blue shift of the phosphorescence and high quantum yield is attributed to the broken symmetry of the ring.53

In the case of [Rnpr] (n = 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10), the emission behaviour was highly dependent on the ring size (Fig. 13B). The complexes [R4pr], [R8pr] and [R10pr] emitted at about 625 nm (Φem ∼0.03) with an intensity that was about 1.5 times more intense than those of the model complex in CH3CN; [R3pr] and [R6pr] emitted more strongly at 617 nm by a factor of 2.5, and these emissions were blue-shifted by 10–20 nm compared to those of the model complex (∼630 nm). Interestingly, although [R3pr] and [R4pr] retained their emission abilities in a less polar solvent, CH2Cl2, the emission quantum yields of [R6pr], [R8pr] and [R10pr] became comparable to that of the model complex (Table 4).
Emission from the 3MLCT excited state of both the Re-rings and the model complex could be analysed using a double exponential function, which showed lifetimes of ∼200 and 500–600 ns, respectively. The proportion of the longer-lifetime component was significantly greater than that of the shorter-lifetime component for the Re-rings that emitted more strongly than the model complexes. For example, for [Rnpr] series, the most emissive complexes [R3pr] and [R6pr] showed a larger proportion of longer lifetimes in CH3CN (lifetimes: 0.57 and 0.59 μs, ratios: 90% and 83%, respectively). In contrast, the ratios of longer lifetimes of other Re-rings were significantly smaller (44%, 52% and 50% for [R4pr], [R8pr] and [R10pr], respectively), but still higher than those of the model complex (lifetimes 0.47 μs, ratios 20% for cis,trans-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(PPh2Et)2]+). Although this ratio of [R3pr] was almost maintained even in a CH2Cl2 solution, the longer-lifetime proportion decreased to 30% for [R6pr] in a CH2Cl2 solution.
It has been reported that mononuclear Re(I) complexes with two phosphine ligands, each of which has one alkyl and two phenyl groups (cis,trans-[Re(4dmb)(CO)2(PPh2R)2]+), emit with different lifetimes.39 These emissions came from different rotational conformers of such complexes with different strengths of interligand interactions between the 4dmb ligand and the phenyl groups on the phosphine ligands. The interligand interaction strongly affected the photophysical properties of the Re complexes: the lifetime of the excited states became longer, and the Stokes shift between the 1MLCT absorption band and the emission from the corresponding 3MLCT excited state became smaller. For the Re-rings, the strength of the interligand interaction between the bpy ligand and the phenyl groups of the P–P ligands is controlled by the size of the cavity in the central space. Both the diimine ligands and the phenyl groups of the bisphosphine ligands of the Re-rings with small cavities, such as [R2bu], [R3pr] and [R4et], should be localized at the outside of their small central cavity because the rotational motion along the Re–P bond should be limited. The reason why [R6pr] and [R8pr] were exceptions only in a CH3CN solution may be that inter-unit π–π interactions among the aromatic groups of these Re-rings stabilize some favourable conformations for the interligand interaction between the diimine ligand and the phenyl groups of the P–P ligands. Therefore, the emission properties of [R6pr] and [R8pr] in the less polar solvent, CH2Cl2, which should weaken the π–π interaction, were similar to those of the models.
For the Re-rings with multiple CC bonds or phenylene groups in the P–P ligands, i.e. [Rnvi], [Rnac] and [Rnph], only small rings (n = 3, 4) could be synthesized because of their structural rigidities. The UV–vis absorption spectra of these Re-rings exhibited a similar pattern to that of the Re-rings with alkyl chains in the P–P ligands, but the 1MLCT absorption maxima of [Rnac] and [Rnvi] were blue-shifted. Only minor perturbations in the 1MLCT absorption maxima that were related to the ring size were observed in these series of Re-rings.
A broad and non-vibrational emission from the lowest 3MLCT excited state was observed from these Re-rings; [Rnac] exhibited the highest-energy maxima at 581 nm, and those of [Rnvi] and [Rnph] were red-shifted to 603 and 612 nm, respectively. Also, the number of Re units did not significantly affect the emission maximum (Δλem = 1–3 nm), in contrast to that of [Rnet] with an ethylene chain in the P–P ligand (Δλem = 5 nm). Their emission quantum yields were much higher than those of [Rnet]. In particular, the Φem values of [Rnac] were approximately 3-fold larger than those of [Rnet]. All of their emission decays could be fitted with a single exponential function with a long lifetime (ca. 0.6–0.9 μs), although some conformers of the Re(I) unit were observed in the IR spectra for [R3vi] and [Rnac]. The fit of these emission decays with a single exponential function is one of the marked differences from the Re-rings with alkyl spacers whose emission decays were fitted using double exponential functions as described above. This strongly suggests that not only the phenyl groups but also the vinylene and ethynylene chains in the P–P ligand can interact with the bpy ligand; this was corroborated by their X-ray analysis data.
All methyl-substituted rings exhibited similar photophysical behaviour, such as intense MLCT absorption at λabs ≈ 400 nm and strong broad non-vibrational 3MLCT emission at λem < 600 nm; the positions of both corresponding maxima were gradually blue-shifted in the order 4dmb → 5dmb → tmb (Fig. 14). Both the emission quantum yields and the emission lifetimes concomitantly increased for the Re-rings with higher emission energy (Table 4). In contrast, only [R3(5mxb)ph] displayed the most blue-shifted λabs and λem, and the shape of the spectra showed some differences: strong absorption at λabs ≈ 300 to 350 nm and a shoulder peak at λabs ≈ 380 to 410 nm along with a vibrationally structured emission (λem ≈ 540 nm, 510 nm (sh)), which indicates that the emissive state contained not only 3MLCT but also 3IL characteristics. It is noteworthy that the emission quantum yield of [R3(5mxb)ph] is the highest among the Re(I) complexes (Φem = 0.66) reported so far, and the emission lifetime was also very long (τem = 7.8 μs).

As well as outstanding photophysical properties, the Re-rings show unique electrochemical characteristics. Fig. 15 displays cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of [R4x] (x = et, pr, bu, pe, and he) and their model mononuclear Re complex cis,trans-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(PPh2Pr)2]+ measured in DMF.

For [R4he] (Fig. 15A), a reversible wave and an irreversible wave were observed at E1/2 = −1.72 V and Ep = −2.34 V vs. Ag/AgNO3, respectively, which are attributed to the reduction of the ligand (bpy/bpy˙−) and rhenium (ReI/Re0), respectively. Although these potentials were similar to those of the model mononuclear complex cis,trans-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(PPh2Pr)2]+ (E1/2 = −1.73 V and Ep = −2.36 V), the observed current with [R4he] was 2.7-fold higher than that of cis,trans-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(PPh2Pr)2]+ at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, which indicates that the number of electrons accepted by one molecule of [R4he] was 4. This clearly shows that there was no strong electronic interaction among the Re units of [R4he] even in its reduced states. As shown in Fig. 15B, the shorter alkyl chains in the bidentate phosphorous ligands resulted in a broader reduction wave, which was attributed to the reduction of the ligand (bpy/bpy˙−) of [R4x]. In particular, two distinct reduction peaks were observed for [R4et] (E1/2 = −1.66 V, −1.76 V), which were attributed to the initial reduction of two Re units at a more positive potential, followed by the reduction of the other two units at more negative potentials owing to the interaction with the adjacent reduced units. Similar broadening was observed for [R3vi] and [R3ac], i.e. stepwise one-electron reductions occurred, as shown in Fig. 16. On the other hand, the voltammogram for [R3ph] showed a single three-electron reduction wave. These results indicate that through-space electronic interactions occur among the three units in [R3vi] and [R3ac] and probably also in the Re-rings with the short alkyl chains in the P–P ligands and the small number of Re units, e.g. [R4et], as described above.

By addition of methyl groups to the bpy ligand, especially at the 5,5-positions, the reduction potentials of the Re-rings can be shifted in a negative direction; for example, Ered1/2 = −1.82 V for [R3(5dmb)ph]. The reduction potentials of the selected rings are summarized in Table 4.


Photochemical multi-electron accumulation. 
The 3MLCT excited states of the Re-rings can be reductively quenched by various reductants such as triethanolamine (TEOA). Continuous irradiation of the Re-rings in the presence of the reductant produced ‘one-electron reduced species’ (OERS) of each Re unit and afforded multi-electron accumulation into one molecule of the Re-rings (Scheme 9).50,52
 Scheme 9  Photochemical multi-electron accumulation in a tetranuclear Re-ring. 

Fig. 17A shows UV–vis absorption spectral changes of [R4bu] in a DMF–TEOA mixed solution under irradiation at λex = 436 nm, which included the appearance of a new absorption band over a wide range of the visible region; this was attributed to the reduced Re complexes. Calculations using this data and the molar extinction coefficient of the model Re mononuclear complex indicated that [R4bu] accumulated 3.6 electrons in one molecule during 20 min of irradiation. Similar multi-electron accumulation was observed for [R4x] (x = pr, pe and he), which can accumulate 2.9–3.6 electrons in one molecule (Fig. 17B), and [R6bu], which can accumulate 4.4. These reduced species were stable under anaerobic conditions even under irradiation. The formation quantum yields of the reduced species (ΦOER) exceeded 100% during the first stage of the photoreactions. This is not surprising because TEOA acts as a two-electron donor owing to the strong reduction power of the α-amino radical species formed by deprotonation from one-electron oxidized TEOA.54 Although a longer irradiation time lowered ΦOER, in general, the photoinduced multi-electron accumulation can be achieved with high efficiencies.

Photosensitizers for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
As described in the previous sections, the Re-rings have excellent properties as redox photosensitizers (PS), i.e. strong absorption in the visible-region, a long lifetime of the 3MLCT excited state, strong oxidation power in the excited state, high formation quantum yield, stability, and strong reduction power of their OERS. Hence, the Re-rings have fascinating possibilities as PS for various redox reactions,55 such as organic syntheses,56 H2 generation,12,57 and CO2 reduction (Scheme 10A).13,58 The first example of this usage of the Re-rings was reported for highly efficient CO2 reduction as follows (Scheme 10B).49
 Scheme 10  (A) Mechanism of photosensitized CO2 reduction. (B) Conditions of photochemical CO2 reduction. 
Two important parameters for evaluating photocatalysis, i.e. quantum yield (efficiency) and turnover number (durability) are given using the following equations. (1) TONPRODUCT = Product [mol]/Catalyst [mol](2)
A DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) mixed solution containing [R3(5dmb)et], fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ ([Re-ACN], Chart 5), as a catalyst (Cat), and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH, Eox = 0.13 V vs. Ag/AgNO3)59 as a strong reductant was irradiated at λex = 436 nm under a CO2 atmosphere, which resulted in the selective formation of CO with high efficiency. The quantum yield of the CO formation (ΦCO) was 0.82, which shows that this is the most efficient photocatalytic system for CO2 reduction so far. It has been reported that [Re-ACN] was quantitatively converted to the CO2–TEOA adduct, fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(R2N-CH2CH2O-COO)] (R = C2H4OH), in a DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) mixed solution under a CO2 atmosphere, as shown in Scheme 11, and this species functions as a real catalyst.60
 Chart 5  Structures and abbreviations of the catalysts used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
 Scheme 11  Reactions of fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ with solvent molecules (DMF, TEOA) and subsequent CO2 capture. 
Since the excited states of the Re-rings with the phenylene chains have stronger oxidation powers compared to those of the Re-rings with alkyl chains, TEOA can be used as a reductant in the photocatalytic systems using [R3(5dmb)ph], in which the 3MLCT excited state was quantitatively quenched by TEOA. Note that TEOA is a much weaker electron donor (Eox = 0.51 V vs. Ag/AgNO3)61 than BIH. For example, Ru(II)-trisdiimine complexes cannot be quenched or are quenched with very low efficiency by TEOA, and even in the cases of [R3et] and [R3bu], only 55% and 13% of their excited states could be reductively quenched by TEOA in the DMF–TEOA mixture (5:1 v/v, 1.256 M), respectively. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems using [R3(5dmb)ph] as a photosensitizer and TEOA as a reductant were reported with three types of catalysts, as shown in Chart 5, namely, fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+, as above, trans(Cl)-[Ru(dtbb)(CO)2Cl2] and fac-[Mn(dtbb)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+.52Table 5 summarizes the results.

When [Re-ACN] (0.05 mM) was used as a catalyst, the numbers of photons absorbed by [R3(5dmb)ph] (0.05 mM) and the catalyst were in the ratio 87:13 at λex = 436 nm. Irradiation of the DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing [Re-ACN] (0.05 mM) and [R3(5dmb)ph] (0.05 mM) selectively produced CO with ΦCO = 0.61 and TONCO = 71 after 15 h of irradiation. Although ΦCO remained unchanged even in the presence of various concentrations of BIH, TONCO drastically increased with higher concentrations of BIH; for example, TONCO ≈ 400 for [BIH] = 0.05 M, where almost all of the added BIH was consumed. Accumulation of the oxidation products of TEOA in the reaction solution might then disturb the photocatalytic reaction and cause faster PS decomposition. A higher value of ΦCO = 0.74 using solely TEOA was achieved by using another 5,5′-substituted ring, namely [R3(5mxb)ph] in combination with a half-molar ratio of [Re-ACN] under 405 nm irradiation.
When [Ru-Cl2] was used as a catalyst in an equimolar ratio (0.05 mM) to [R3(5dmb)ph] as a photosensitizer in DMA–TEOA (5:1 v/v), the ratio of photons absorbed by the photosensitizer and the catalyst was 98:2. The main product was formic acid accompanied by H2 and CO as minor products. Relatively high durability was achieved: TONHCOOH was 290 and the TONs for H2 and CO were around 70 and 20, respectively, for 24 h irradiation. The quantum yield (ΦHCOOH) was 58%, which is the highest value reported to date for a photocatalytic system for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. During the photocatalytic reactions, the OERS of [R3(5dmb)ph] was not detected. This suggests that the reaction of [R3(5dmb)ph˙−] with the catalyst was very efficient and fast.
An earth-abundant metal catalyst, [Mn-ACN], was used under the same photocatalytic conditions with [R3(5dmb)ph] as the Ru catalyst, where the absorbed photon ratio was 72:28 for the photosensitizer and the catalyst in the starting stage of the photocatalytic reaction. Formic acid was evolved as the main product with TONHCOOH = 85, and this was accompanied by CO. In the initial stage, the UV–vis absorption spectral changes of the reaction solution accurately indicated that dimerization of the Mn complex proceeded to give [Mn(dtbb)(CO)3]2 with strong absorption over a wide range of the visible region. During the dimer formation, and even at any moment of the photocatalytic reaction, the OERS of the ring was not detected. The quantum yield of HCOOH formation was 48% despite the inner-filter effect of the dimer absorption. This is the highest value so far among the reported photocatalytic systems using an Mn complex as the catalyst.
These high Φ of CO2 reduction can be attributed to several reasons, especially: the high formation yield of the OERS of [R3(5dmb)ph] via reductive quenching of the excited state with TEOA, owing to its long lifetime and strong oxidation power in the excited state, and the rapid electron transfer process from the OERS of [R3(5dmb)ph] to the catalyst, which suppresses accumulation of the OERS. Accumulation of the OERS induces the inner-filter effect due to their strong absorption in the visible region (Fig. 17A), which lowers the apparent Φ of the CO2 reduction product. In the photocatalytic reaction solutions, no accumulation of the OERS of [R3(5dmb)ph] was observed. As described in the ‘Photochemical multi-electron accumulation’ section, in the absence of a catalyst, most of the ring was converted to the corresponding OERS within several minutes of irradiation. These results clearly indicated that electron transfer from the OERS of [R3(5dmb)ph] to the catalyst was not the rate-limiting step. In all cases, we found that the catalysts decomposed first, which means that these rings should be durable PS in the presence of the catalyst.

C. Square-shaped Re(I) tetranuclear complexes
Square-like tetramers 4a and 4b (Chart 6) were briefly reported by Sullivan and co-workers.62 They were synthesized by refluxing fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(OTf)] and pr or vi in o-dichlorobenzene at very high temperatures. Although their X-ray structures were not reported, the unusual trans,cis-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(P–P)2]-configuration assignment could be elucidated on the basis of other analytical data.63 Both compounds were found to be emissive (Table 6) in solution with a typical 3MLCT character, and their quantum yields and lifetimes were larger when compared to cis-[Re(bpy)(CO)2(μ-P–P)]+ monomers. No other photophysical and photochemical properties have been reported so far.

4. Multinuclear complexes with N-linkages
Two-dimensional triangles, squares, rectangles and other polygons, polyhedra, and three-dimensional prisms and cages64,65 were synthesized by using the [ReI(CO)3L]n+ units as corners of the multinuclear complexes (5–16 in Table 7). The construction of these structures is often driven by self-assembly. As typical examples, pyrazine or 4,4′-bipyridine react with [Re(CO)5X] under mild conditions to give symmetric neutral Re(I) squares with a facial arrangement of the CO ligands (Scheme 12A).66 Many other larger linkers, including Zn-porphyrins, Zn-salen, Fe-clathrochelate,67 and other transition-metal complexes,68 were used for constructing the analogous larger molecular squares (Table 7 shows only emissive examples).

These display absorption spectra similar to the corresponding mononuclear complex [Re(η1-BL)2(CO)3L]n+, but many of them exhibit no emission from the Re(I) unit. The emission mostly arises from the linker moiety, such as the Zn-porphyrin units in 11–13. In 5–10, the Re units can emit with short emission lifetimes and low emission quantum yields. In these systems, therefore, the rhenium complexes only have a structural role as corners rather than a direct photophysical role. One particular interesting feature of these compounds is the formation of one-dimensional open channels not only in the macroscopic single crystals but also in the microcrystalline thin films.69 Their available cavities range in size from three to tens of Å and serve as hosts for complexation with small volatile organic compounds,70 aromatic nitrocompounds,71 chiral aminoalcohols,72 and pyridino-porphyrins.73 However, the binding behaviours in solution have been studied mainly by NMR techniques or by following other incorporated emissive units due to the lack of emissive properties of the Re(I) parts.
As exceptional examples, Lu and co-workers introduced quadrates having fac-[ReI(CO)3X]-corners with different double-monodentate ligands for each dimension, affording rectangle-type complexes (Scheme 12B, 17–22 in Table 7).74,75 In contrast to the square-type complexes with homoleptic ligands, these complexes showed weak emission at around 600 nm with lifetimes of 11 ns to 0.5 μs from the 3MLCT state of the Re(I) part. This was particularly useful for the detection of quionones,76 as good electron acceptors, and aromatic amines77 as electron donors by means of emission quenching through charge transfer between the host and the guest.
Rectangular molecules with the 1b motif (Chart 1) have been prepared independently by Hupp78 and Lu79 (Scheme 12C). In the majority of these cases, the Re(I) units did not emit in solution except for 23–28 in Table 7.
There have been a few examples of Re(I) macrocycles consisting of a single tridentate/tetradentate bridging ligand, such as hydroxyterpyridine,80 pyridyl-terpyridine,81 and thiopyrimidine.82 In the series of the trimeric assembly, a pseudo-cylinder-type complex 29a is emissive (Table 7).80 Interestingly, this compound was stabilized by a silver ion as a cap stopper of the cavity, which could be reversibly removed by irradiation. The silver-free species (29b) showed similar photophysical properties to its silver-containing counterpart and they were studied as metal ion carrier through cell membranes.83
Particular trinuclear and octanuclear metallacyclic cages (30–32) and prism (33) were also found to be emissive and are included in Table 7.
A few examples of larger homo-/copolymers containing [Re(N^N)(CO)3L] fragments through an N-linkage have also been reported. Most such polynuclear complexes have polyacrylate,91 poly(vinylpyridine) (PVP),92,93 polystyrene-PVP,94 poly(amidoamine)-type95 or other96 organic polymers with pendant free N^N or pyridine ligands to coordinate Re(I) complex units. These showed some unique properties, such as high electronic conductivity, high absorption in the visible and/or near-IR regions, and similar photophysical properties to the corresponding Re mononuclear complexes.
A scarce group of branched Re(I)-containing polymers is represented by a dendrimer-like molecule with Re(I) nodes used as the active layer in a photovoltaic cell,97 and a π-conjugated network with [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl]-components for application in heterogeneous organic catalysis.98
Schanze99 and others100–102 reported π-conjugated-types of Re(I) copolymers, in which the N^N ligands were incorporated into linear synthons (Chart 7). In these cases, and in solution at room temperature, all of the polymers featured only a short-lived, blue fluorescence with tailing to ca. 600 nm, which increased with higher rhenium loading, and became dominant in thin-films.
 Chart 7  Example of Re(I) π-conjugated copolymers.99 
5. Multinuclear complexes with both P-linkages and an N-linkage
We have also reported a symmetric tetramer (34) and trimers (35) with two types of connectors between the units, i.e. P–P and 4,4′-bpy (Scheme 13), which exhibit interesting photophysical avenues.40 Unlike the N^N-homoleptic 34 and 35a, where only energy transfer takes place, in trimer 35b, the 3MLCT excited state of the one-edge Re unit could transfer excitation energy to the interior unit and then electron transfer proceeded from the excited interior unit to the dftb-edge unit, whose ligand has low-energy π* orbitals.

6. Summary and outlook
Over the last decade, it has been reported that Re(I)-diimine-based complexes represent a unique group of metal complexes with wide synthetic flexibility and coordination possibilities, allowing various types of multinuclear oligo/polymers or macrocycles to be obtained. Based on precise design, the incorporation of different types of ligands by different strategies provides the target complexes with suitable properties, such as a highly emissive and long-lived excited state, compared to the mononuclear complex. Their improved properties benefit their application in luminescent probes or solar energy conversion functions. Herein, we gave particular attention to complexes containing phosphine ligand connectors, their involvement in pronounced interligand interactions, and further effects on the complex properties. Linear complexes mainly show efficient light-harvesting properties; meanwhile, the cyclic complexes were shown to be excellent PS for CO2 reduction. Some cyclic complexes also exhibited host–guest behaviour with small molecules.
There have been a certain number of reports concerning the photophysical properties of these polynuclear Re complexes and polymers. However, the application of these compounds is still limited. We can expect that there is a wide range of possibilities for these applications because of their unique and fascinating features with respect to their photophysics, photochemistry and electrochemistry.

Jana Rohacova	Dr Jana Rohacova was born in the Czech Republic and graduated in organic chemistry and pharmacochemistry from the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague. She moved to Valencia, Spain, where she obtained her PhD in photochemistry and photobiology under Prof. Miguel A. Miranda in 2010. She was awarded a JSPS postdoctoral fellowship in 2011, which allowed her to work for four years with Prof. Osamu Ishitani at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, focusing on organometallic chemistry and photocatalysis. In 2016 she joined the R&D team of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in Opava, Czech Republic, as a chemical specialist.
Osamu Ishitani	Osamu Ishitani is a Professor at the Department of Chemistry of the Tokyo Institute of Technology. He obtained his Dr. Eng. at Osaka University in 1987. After he spent three months as a visiting researcher at the Hahn-Meitner Institute, Berlin (Prof. Dr W. Schnabel), he joined the National Institute for Resources and Environment in Japan. He became a senior researcher at the same institute in 1993. He was a visiting researcher between 1993 and 1995 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Prof. T. J. Meyer) for one and half years and then at the University of Nottingham (Prof. J. J. Turner) for three months. Just after he returned to Japan, he became an associate professor at Saitama University in 1995. He moved to the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2002, and then he became a full professor in 2006. His main interests are artificial photosynthesis, photocatalytic CO2 reduction, photochemical properties of transition metal complexes, and photo-functional metal complexes. The details of his laboratory and his publication list can be found on http://www.chemistry.titech.ac.jp/~ishitani/index.html.
