    , Accepted 9th September 2018First published on 10th September 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites are a recent ground-breaking advancement in attaining power conversion efficiencies exceeding 21%. However, the toxicity of lead in these PSCs could be a deterrent for large-scale development due to the environmental concerns. The methylammonium tin triiodide (CH3NH3SnI3) perovskite has been successfully employed in lead-free PSCs as an alternative to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The PSCs have mostly been realized with a highly expensive spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting material (HTM). Herein, copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) was implemented as a HTM instead of the highly expensive spiro-OMeTAD counterpart. The results show that CuSCN is a promising HTM for the lead-free CH3NH3SnI3-based PSCs. We investigated and optimized the parameters of the lead-free CH3NH3SnI3-based PSCs with the CuSCN HTM. The simulated device shows a power conversion efficiency exceeding 26% under AM 1.5G illumination and an absorption onset up to 1080 nm. The reported CH3NH3SnI3-based PSCs provide a viable path to the realization of environmentally benign, low-cost, and high-efficiency PSCs.
Introduction
In the past few years, lead-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention, due to their high efficiencies, solution-processability and low-cost fabrication method. Although efficiencies exceeding 21%1–5 have been attained in less than a decade, the toxicity of lead could be an encumbrance for large-scale production due to the environmental concerns. The replacement of Pb with Sn would be a promising way to overcome this problem. As an alternative, methylammonium tin triiodide (MASnI3) has been prosperously implemented in lead-free PSCs.6,7 The reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for MASnI3-based PSCs is about 6%.6,7 The maximum reported values for open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) were 0.88 V, 21 mA cm−2, and 0.48, respectively.7 Exhibiting a narrower band gap around 1.2 to 1.3 eV,6–9 compared to 1.55 eV10 for MAPbI3, the MASnI3 perovskite extends the light absorption onset up to 1050 nm.11 Thus, in a properly designed device, MASnI3 perovskites may ultimately demonstrate a better performance than MAPbI3 perovskites.12 Sn-Based halide perovskites, however, are prevalently prone to oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ when exposed to air.13–15 Recently, Song et al.13 reported an effective process that involves a reducing vapor atmosphere during the preparation of tin-based halide PSCs in order to solve this problem. More than 20% reduction of Sn4+/Sn2+ ratios was achieved using the reducing vapor atmosphere process, which results in a greatly suppressed carrier recombination, to a comparable level of lead-based perovskites. For the MASnI3 perovskite, very high mobilities μe ≈ 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh ≈ 300 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and holes, respectively, have been reported.16 Work by Ma et al.12 revealed that SnF2 doping in the MASnI3 film leads to carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 500 nm, which is a very high value compared to 30 nm, its initial reported value.7 Recent findings also show that pressure-induced amorphization and recrystallization processes result in structural stability, increased conductivity, and enhanced photo-responsiveness.17 MASnI3-based PSCs often exhibit a short-circuit behavior. Yokoyama et al.8 employed a low-temperature vapor assisted solution process to overcome this phenomenon. It is remarkable that the recent studies open a new avenue and pave the way for developing high-efficiency MASnI3-based PSCs for attaining environmentally benign and competitive alternatives to the widespread MAPbI3-based PSCs.8,12,13,17 It is noteworthy that there is a growing interest in implementing lead-free perovskites in PSCs. In this context, in addition to tin, perovskites based on cesium, bismuth, and copper have also been explored recently.18–27
In pursuit of high-PCE PSCs, charge carriers should be manipulated along the pathways, including interfaces, from the absorber to the electrodes. Interface recombination is one of the main obstacles for gaining higher values of PCE. Therefore, interface studies have been expanded to investigate the effect of their physical parameters on PSCs’ performances.28–37 Interface engineering as a main concern in promoting PCE has been considered by Zhou et al.28 They reduced the work function of the metal electrode to get a closer value to the Fermi energy of the TiO2 layer, so that the electron collection at the interfaces is facilitated. It is reported that the electron transport has been improved by doping the TiO2 electron transporting material (ETM) layer, and also modifying the ITO layer, which reduced its work function from 4.6 to 4.0 eV. Interfacial engineering has been employed to improve the efficiency of PSCs, by the modification of the TiO2 ETM using graphene,38 amino acids,39 thiols,40 carboxyl groups,41 TiCl4,42 and CsCl.43
In the present paper, we have investigated the role of electron affinity in the two interfaces of buffer TiO2/MASnI3 absorber layers and MASnI3 absorber layers/CuSCN HTM layers on the lead-free PSC's efficiency. We introduce two interface layers to take into account the interface carrier recombination. We study the variation of the electron affinities in the two interfaces to understand their effect on the solar cell performance.
The most commonly used hole transporting materials (HTMs) for achieving PSCs with efficiencies greater than 20% are highly expensive organic materials, due to their complicated synthetic procedure – the main prohibitive limitation for further large-scale implementation.4 One of the prevalently used and most efficient HTMs in PSCs is spiro-OMeTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene]. However, it has a price that is more than ten times that of gold and platinum.44 In order to introduce an alternative to the spiro-OMeTAD, various HTMs, e.g. carbon nanotubes (CNTs),54,55 copper thiocyanate (CuSCN),4,51,56–58 copper iodine (CuI),44 poly triarylamine (PTAA),59 poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),59 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),60 and 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine,61 have been developed. Among these HTMs, CuSCN is an extremely-cheap solution-processable inorganic p-type semiconductor, which transmits light throughout the visible and near infrared spectrum due to its wide bandgap (3.7–3.9 eV).56,57 CuSCN also shows a good stability and high mobility of 0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD.57 Additionally, a solution-processed method can be used for its deposition, which makes it consistent with flexible substrates.57 Most recently, Arora et al.4 reported PSCs with CuSCN HTMs that yield stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20%. The implementation of CuSCN instead of spiro-OMeTAD could be a step forward in the development of low-cost PSCs. To the author's knowledge, experimental work on the implementation of CuSCN in the MASnI3-based PSCs has not been reported to date. The leaping of PSC technology from a laboratory to industrial scale scenario faces some limits. For instance, it is crucial to find an alternative method to spin-coating, a laboratory-scale-used method for the deposition process. For this purpose, spray-coating and printing techniques are promising methods.62 These methods do not demand strictly controlled atmospheres. It is worth noting that the upscaling of PSCs has attracted remarkable attention in the PSC research community in recent years.63–65
Optoelectronic simulation
The simulations were performed using the SCAPS 3.3.04 software,66 which solves the Poisson equation, and the continuity equations for electrons and holes. The device architecture of the lead-free PSCs is transparent conductive oxide (TCO)/ETM/interface layer 1 (IL1)/absorber/interface layer 2 (IL2)/HTM. Although the majority of PSCs are based on FTO electrodes, ITO was used here as an electrode, which was considered to be modified using polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), a polymer containing simple aliphatic amine groups to reduce the work function.28 The same treatment caused smoother surfaces and interfaces in the structure. Regarding improvement in stability, reproducibility, spectral properties of PSCs, and device performance, Cs-doping plays an important role in PSCs.2,4,67,68 The complete set of simulation parameters is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the TCO, ETM, absorber, and HTM are ITO/PEIE, TiO2, CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite, and CuSCN, respectively. Fig. 1(b) depicts the energy level diagram of the corresponding materials used in the architecture. For the sake of efficiency optimization, it would be preferable to have the valance band (VB) of the HTM in close alignment with the perovskite.58 Employing CuSCN as an HTM – a promising material for efficient hole extraction in PSCs – would guarantee such a requirement. Herein, Eg is the band gap energy, χ is the electron affinity, εr is the relative permittivity, Nc and Nv are the conduction band (CB) and VB effective density of states, μn and μp are the mobilities of the electrons and holes, NA and ND describe the acceptor and donor densities, and Nt is the defect density. The absorption coefficient (α) of the TiO2, MASnI3 perovskite, and CuSCN was extracted from experimental results12,45,53 in order to contemplate a more practical device. For IL1, and IL2 the pre-factor Aα was 105 to obtain the α curve calculated by α = Aα(hν − Eg)1/2. The diffusion lengths of the electrons (LeD) and holes (LhD) were set to be 258 nm and 549 nm, respectively.12 The IL1 and IL2 with 10 nm thicknesses were inserted between the ETM/absorber interface and the absorber/HTM interface, respectively. Such interface layers have already been introduced and examined to describe the experimental results successfully.47,69 The thickness of the ITO/PEIE layer was set to be 450 nm. The electron and hole thermal velocity was 107 cm s−1. The simulations were carried out at AM 1.5G illumination.

Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the variation in solar cell performance for different absorber layer thicknesses. The thickness of the absorber layer has been varied from 50 nm to 450 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a), by increasing the thickness of the absorber layer, the Jsc and Voc fall off smoothly. This is due to the fact that larger absorber lengths induce longer pathways for photo-generated charge carriers which may cause more recombination. The small lengths of the absorption layers are not beneficial as they prevent the system from reaching higher PCEs (Fig. 2b). A desirable range of the absorption layer length starts from 100 nm and ends at 200 nm, after which the PCE is decreased. For the thicknesses beyond the calculated range, photo-generated carriers will face recombination and cannot be collected effectively. Also, optimized thickness values for the ETM and HTM were obtained to be 15 nm and 200 nm, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows that the optimized PCE value can be reached up to a thickness of 120 nm of the absorber, whereas the FF for this optimized configuration is 72.88%.

Fig. 3(a–d) depict the variation of the solar cell performances with different electron affinity values of IL1 (χIL1) and IL2 (χIL2). The range of the affinity values was chosen in such a way that it met the convergence condition. The Jsc value stays at about 33 mA cm−2 for the whole range of χIL1 when χIL2 = 3.7 eV (Fig. 3a and 4a). However, it decreases noticeably fast when χIL2 > 3.7 eV. This could be explained by the high recombination current depicted in Fig. 5(c).

(c) Recombination current for different values of χIL1 and χIL2. (d) Electric field distribution for different values of χIL2. 
The Voc, however, is optimized when χIL1 does not exceed 4.3 eV (Fig. 3b), and the upper limit of χIL2 is 3.8 eV. The optimum values of FF, also, will fall in the same region (Fig. 3c). To achieve a higher PCE, the optimum ranges of the electron affinity values are 4.1 < χIL1 (eV) < 4.3 and 3.7 < χIL2 (eV) < 3.8. Fig. 4 depicts how changes in electron affinities affect the performance of the solar cell. For χIL2 = 3.7 eV, increasing χIL1 results in lower Voc and an undesirable curvature in the current density–voltage (J–V) curve (Fig. 4a). However, Jsc does not change. For χIL1 = 4.15 eV, increasing χIL2 not only affects Voc, but also creates a double-diode like curvature in the J–V curve (Fig. 4b). These observations along with the resulting lower values of Jsc lead to a low FF (Fig. 3c).

Fig. 5(a) illustrates the CB diagram for different values of χIL1 as a function of depth from the surface. For χIL1 = 4.10 and 4.15 eV spikes are formed at the IL1/MASnI3 interface. These spikes induce extra charge separation at the interface, where it leads to an increase in Voc (Fig. 3b). It is clearly seen from Fig. 5(a) that increasing χIL1 over 4.30 eV leads to an increase in spikes at the TiO2/IL1 interface. This gives rise to a higher electron concentration at the TiO2/IL1 interface, where, it will lead to higher recombination current (Fig. 5c) and lower Voc values (Fig. 3b). The electron affinities of χIL1 = 4.20, 4.25 and 4.30 eV form other spikes in the TiO2/IL1 interface, instead, whereas cliffs are formed at the IL1/MASnI3 interface. Although the presence of these cliffs helps the electrons to travel through the passage, the presence of the spikes plays the same role as previous ones to raise the charge separation and keep Voc as high as possible.
For χIL2 = 3.7 and 3.8 eV spikes are formed at the IL2/CuSCN interface in the VB, as shown in Fig. 5(b). These spikes, like in the CB above, elevate the charge separation which leads to high Voc values (Fig. 3b). Increasing χIL2 over 3.8 eV, the spikes disappear at the IL2/CuSCN interface (Fig. 5b) resulting in lower Voc values (Fig. 3b). A further increasing pattern of Voc, after χIL2 = 4.2 eV, is originated in forming another set of spikes at the MASnI3/IL2 interface (Fig. 5b). In Fig. 5(d), the electric field at the IL2/CuSCN interface is depicted, when the electron affinity changes. The monotonic decrease in the electric field with rising electron affinity at the IL2/CuSCN interface leads to higher recombination current (Fig. 5c) and lower Jsc (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 5(d), for χIL2 = 3.7 and 3.8 eV the electric field is considerably high at the IL2/CuSCN interface, which leads to promotion of the charge separation and subsequently higher Voc values (Fig. 3b). For χIL2 = 3.9, 4, and 4.1 eV a cliff is formed at the IL2/CuSCN interface that does not hinder photo-generated hole flow toward the Au contact and Jsc does not change significantly, as shown in Fig. 3(a). This is in agreement with the uniform electric field behavior for χIL2 = 3.9, 4, and 4.1 eV (Fig. 5d).
The effect of the MASnI3 defect density was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 6(a and b). The Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination model can be used to perform a detailed study on the influence of the defect density of the perovskite layer on cell performance. The SRH recombination model is as follows:70–72  where n and p are electron and hole densities, respectively, under the non-equilibrium condition. ni is the intrinsic density, Ei is the intrinsic energy level, and Et is the energy level of the trap defects. The aforementioned formula assumes that the traps are non-radiative recombination centers and that electron and hole capture cross sections are equal (σn,p = σn = σp = 2 × 10−14 cm2). The term np − ni2 in the formula plays a role as a source of recombination, because it measures the deviation of the system from the equilibrium condition. Also, it is postulated that the defects are set to be at the center of the intrinsic band gap. Considering electron and hole diffusion lengths assumed in this work, lowering the defect density which is accompanied by an increase in electron (hole) life time leads to a reduction in the recombination rate and will, finally, improve the device performance. The appropriate defect density to obtain a high-efficiency performance is about 1016 cm−3. The Voc is more sensitive to the defect density than Jsc, in the range selected for defect density (Fig. 6a). When defect density is as high as 1018 cm−3, the cell performance declines down to a PCE value of 23.72%, when Jsc, Voc, and FF are 33.1 mA cm−2, 0.88 V, and 81.44%, respectively (Fig. 6a and b).

Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the effect of the NA of the CuSCN on the solar cell parameters. It is discernable that the optimized value for NA is ∼1.42 × 1017 cm−3. The Voc behavior with respect to NA can be described by Koster et al.'s assumption about PSCs.73 Increasing the NA level in PSCs will raise the density of states and Voc accordingly. The fall off Jsc pattern, when NA increases, originates in the suppression of hole transportation, because, the enhanced impurity scattering centers could present an obstacle to the positive charge carriers (holes) completing the conduction process. The PCE value changes under the influence of the monotonically increasing (decreasing) pattern of Voc (Jsc). Consequently, there would be a narrow range of appropriate doping concentration which can improve the PCE value, and the doping concentration falling out of this range is unfavorable.

Fig. 8(a and b) show the light J–V, dark J–V, and power density–voltage (P–V) curves for the resultant device with optimized parameters. A Jsc value of 35.06 mA cm−2 was achieved, with a Voc value of 0.91 V and a FF of 81.76%, thus generating a PCE of 26.05%.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) covers the entire visible spectrum, as shown in Fig. 9. It is accompanied by a remarkable absorption onset up to 1080 nm. The MASnI3 PSCs have a larger absorption onset12 compared to MAPbI3 PSCs.6,11,74 Moreover, CuSCN transmits light across the entire visible and near infrared spectral region, due to its wide bandgap.

Conclusions
In summary, MASnI3-based PSCs with CuSCN HTM and ITO/PEIE electrodes were analyzed using the SCAPS 3.3.04 software. The PCE of 26.05% was achieved by engineering and optimization of different parameters. Our results also demonstrated that CuSCN is a promising HTM for the lead-free MASnI3-based PSCs. The simulated device showed a remarkable absorption onset up to 1080 nm, which is notably redshifted compared with MAPbI3-based PSCs. The lead-free solution-processed photovoltaic devices based on MASnI3 perovskites represent an applicable approach to achieve high-efficiency, low-cost, and environmentally benign PSCs.
