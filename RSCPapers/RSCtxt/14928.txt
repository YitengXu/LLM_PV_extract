1 Introduction
There has been an increasing worldwide demand for the development of alternative energy techniques with greater efficiency and sustainability due to the fast consumption of fossil fuels and related environmental issues of climate change and global warming. Over the past decades, many efforts have been made in developing new techniques toward clean energy including biofuels, wind power and solar energy, as well as efficient energy storage such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.1 As more and more renewable energy resources are used, the development of high-performance, low-cost and environmentally friendly energy storage devices is crucial to practical applications (such as consumer electronics, electric and hybrid vehicles) and the future sustainable economy. Among the various energy storage systems, supercapacitors or electrochemical capacitors are considered as promising alternative power sources for rapid storage and release of electric energy as a result of their high energy density, simple principles, long cycle life, long-term operation stability, low level of heating and high rate capability.2,3
A supercapacitor consists of two nonreactive porous plates, or electrodes immersed in an electrolyte and separated by a porous membrane that allows migration of electrolyte ions and electrically isolates the two electrodes. According to the charge storage mechanisms, supercapacitors can be classified into two types: pseudocapacitors and electric-double-layer capacitors (EDLC). The pseudocapacitors store energy via the fast Faradaic redox reactions of the electrode materials, while the electric-double-layer capacitors store energy via the adsorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of electrode materials.1,3 Therefore, metal oxides and conducting polymers that can undergo reversible redox reactions are usually used as electrode materials for the pseudocapacitors. Materials with high specific surface area are beneficial for the adsorption of electrolyte ions, which are suitable for EDLC.
Carbonaceous materials with high surface area and porous structure have been widely investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors (for example activated carbons,4 templated carbons5 and carbon aerogels6). Carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels are a large class of porous carbonaceous materials. Carbonaceous hydrogels possess the characteristics such as high water absorptivity, good elasticity and good osmotic property, which have been investigated for applications as sensors,7 adsorbents,8 electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors.6,9 Carbonaceous aerogels exhibit the characteristics such as high porosity, high surface area and low density, leading to promising applications in the field of adsorbents,10 electrodes11 and catalyst supports.12 Carbonaceous gels manifest an open three-dimensional (3D) network and porous structure, which can provide efficient diffusion/mass transfer of the liquid/gas phase and a large amount of active sites for the adsorption of ions/molecules.6 The unique structure of the carbonaceous gels could allow stable and sustained transport of both electrolyte ions and electrons to the surface, leading to promising applications for supercapacitors. On the other hand, the carbonaceous gels can serve as robust substrates, decorated with metal oxides or conducting polymers, which can enhance the capacitance.
In this feature article, basic knowledge of the theory for supercapacitors and backgrounds for the carbonaceous gels are introduced. Recent advances in carbonaceous gels are summarized, particularly in the related synthetic methods and their applications for supercapacitors. In detail, the fabrication of polymer derived carbonaceous gels, carbon nanotube based carbonaceous gels, graphene based carbonaceous gels and biomass derived carbonaceous gels is discussed. Various synthetic methods for the synthesis of carbonaceous gels including freeze-drying, hard template, soft template and hydrothermal treatment are discussed. Applications and perspectives of the above carbonaceous gels as electrolyte or electrode materials are discussed in detail.
2 Backgrounds for supercapacitors, hydrogels and aerogels
2.1 Basic knowledge for supercapacitors
Depending on their structure and properties, carbonaceous gels work mostly as electric-double-layer capacitors (EDLC) for supercapacitors. Fig. 1 shows the structure of EDLC containing two electrodes immersed in an electrolyte and a separator located between the two electrodes. The main mechanisms for the EDLC arise from the reversible adsorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of the electrode materials. During the charge process, anions transport to the surface of the positive electrode and cations transport to the negative electrode, forming electrical double layers at the interface. While the stored energy released, the adsorbed electrolyte ions will release to the solutions. The accumulated ions on the electrodes result in a capacitance C as described by Helmholtz13 by the following formula: (1)where εr and ε0 are the electrolyte and vacuum dielectric constants, respectively, d is the effective thickness of the electrical double layer, and A is the surface area of the interface. Each electrode (C1 or C2) can be considered as a capacitor. The total capacitance of a supercapacitor cell (Ccell) can be calculated by using eqn (2): (2)where C1 and C2 are the capacitance of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The electric energy (E) of the supercapacitor is related to the capacitance (C) and the applied voltage (V): (3)
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the charged and discharged electric double layer capacitor. 
The capacitance essentially depends on the electrode materials used. The use of high-capacitance materials is crucial to the obtaining of high electric energy and power density. The power (P) of a supercapacitor can be calculated by the following equation: (4)where V is the maximum cell voltage and Rs is the equivalent series resistance (ESR) in ohms. The capacitance of EDLC is mainly dependent on the characteristic of the electrode materials such as conductivity, surface area and pore size distribution. For further improving the capacitance, other materials such as metal oxides or conducting polymers that exhibit pseudo-capacitive behavior can be doped in the electrode materials.
2.2 Backgrounds for carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels
Hydrogels are physically or chemically cross-linked 3D hydrophilic solid networks with adsorbed water in the networks. As one of the soft materials, hydrogels have been widely applied as artificial tissues,14,15 drug carriers,15 electrode materials,6,16 actuators,17 sensors,18 and adsorbents.19 The classification of the hydrogels is dependent on a variety of characteristics such as the source, the nature of cross-linking (covalent or non-covalent) and the structural features (affine or phantom).20 Traditional hydrogels crosslinked by organic polymers are usually associated with problems of poor mechanical properties and stability which limit their applications. Novel hydrogels or hybrid hydrogels with hierarchical structures and multifunctional properties have been synthesized by using advanced materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, biomass etc.) as constituent building blocks or incorporating other functional materials such as nanoparticles into the hydrogels. For example, multifunctional hydrogels or hybrid hydrogels including carbonaceous nanofiber hydrogels,8 graphene–poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) composite hydrogels,14 graphene hydrogels,16,17 and polymer–clay nanosheet composite hydrogels21 have been successfully fabricated recently. Novel hydrogels with inorganic or organic–inorganic hybrid building blocks have drawn much attention due to their excellent mechanical properties. Our group6 has fabricated carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels by using crude biomass as the source and demonstrated their robust mechanical properties (Fig. 2). As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the carbonaceous hydrogels can be easily compressed in water and can recover their original scale. The compressive stress–strain curve of the hydrogels shows the maximal stress of 23.8 kPa at a set stain (ε) of 60% (Fig. 2c). The dynamic viscoelastic measurements (Fig. 2b) at angular frequencies of 1–100 rad s−1 show a storage modulus of about 948.5 kPa at 10 rad s−1 and the storage modulus value is much higher than the loss modulus value over the entire angular frequencies, indicating an excellent elastic property of the carbonaceous hydrogels.

Aerogels have a similar structure to that of hydrogels. Aerogels can be synthesised by replacing the liquids in hydrogels or other wet gels with air without collapsing the interconnected microstructure. The properties of low density (0.004–0.500 g cm−3), high surface area and large open pores of the aerogels could lead to many advanced applications such as supercapacitors,6,22 electrocatalysis,23 adsorbents,8,24 stretchable conductors,25,26 lithium-ion batteries,27 and artificial muscles.28 The traditional aerogels are usually associated with problems of poor mechanical strength and using supercritical drying which is less energy efficient. Thus, many efforts have been made aiming to synthesize functional aerogels with strong mechanical properties and, more importantly, to develop novel and cost-effective synthetic methods. For example, novel aerogels based on carbon nanofibers,24 graphene,26 nanocellulose,29 and epoxy-clay30 are fabricated by using freeze-drying methods. Wei et al.31 prepared silica–polymer composite aerogels by a simple sol–gel process stepped by air-drying. The obtained composite aerogels showed properties of low high-temperature thermal conductivities and high mechanical strength. Novel carbonaceous aerogels fabricated by our group6 by using a freeze-drying method exhibited excellent compression properties as shown in Fig. 2a and d.
Carbonaceous material based hydrogels and aerogels not only inherit the advantages of the gels but also exhibit some unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity and high biocompatibility. The high surface area and high electrical conductivity of the carbonaceous gels offer great potential for application in supercapacitors. More importantly, a growing demand for wearable and miniaturized electronic devices requires the development of high-performance, lightweight and wearable energy conversion and storage systems. Thus, the carbonaceous gel based supercapacitors could be a suitable choice for the power supply due to their excellent properties such as high performance, lightweight, flexibility and stretchability.
3 Carbonaceous gels for supercapacitors
Over the past few decades, many efforts have been made in synthesizing novel carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels for supercapacitors. On the basis of the source, the carbonaceous gels can be classified into four groups: (1) polymer derived aerogels, (2) carbon nanotube based aerogels, (3) graphene based hydrogels and aerogels, and (4) biomass-derived hydrogels and aerogels. Some recent advances focus on the development of carbonaceous hydrogel and aerogel based supercapacitors with characteristics of large capacitance, light-weight and flexibility. For further improving the capacitive properties of the carbonaceous gels, redox-reaction materials such as conducting polymers and metal oxides can be introduced into the networks of the gels to form a composite material.
3.1 Polymer derived aerogels for supercapacitors
Polymer derived carbon aerogels (CAs) are a large class of carbonaceous aerogels. In 1989, Pekala and Kong first reported the synthesis of CAs by pyrolyzing the resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) organic aerogel in an inert atmosphere.32,33 The RF organic aerogel is prepared by the sol–gel poly-condensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde monomers in water and subsequently by supercritical drying.34 Other sol–gel derived polymers are also employed as precursors for preparing CAs, including phenol–melamine–formaldehyde gel,35 poly-benzoxazine gel,36 cresol–resorcinol–formaldehyde gel,37 resorcinol–pyrocatechol gel,38 cresol–formaldehyde gel,39 resorcinol–methanal gel,40 and poly(vinyl chloride) gel.41 In addition to supercritical drying, microwave drying,42 ambient drying (or air drying),43,44 and freeze-drying45 are also applied for the preparation of dried organic gels. The dried organic gel precursors can be transformed into CAs by pyrolysis. The structure of the CAs can be easily adjusted by controlling the composition of the precursors and the pyrolysis conditions (pyrolysis temperature and time).
Polymer derived CAs have been studied extensively as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Pekala first demonstrated that CAs have great potential for application as electrodes in supercapacitors in 1994.46 The 3D CAs are composed of interconnected nanoparticles (3–30 nm) with a large number of interstitial pores (<50 nm) created by the interconnected solid networks. CAs hold the advantages of high porosity (80–98%), high electrical conductivity (25–100 S cm−1), high surface area (>400 m2 g−1), controllable pore structure and low electrical resistivity.46,47 Benefiting from their unique structure and excellent properties, CAs offer very attractive prospects for application as electrodes in supercapacitors. Pekala et al. studied the synthesis, and structure–property relationships of CAs for supercapacitors.48 The effects of aerogel density, CO2 activation, pyrolysis temperature and Ru-doping on capacitance values of the CAs were investigated. They demonstrated that the capacitance properties of the CAs are dependent on the structure and properties of CAs, which can be adjusted by controlling the parameters such as the ratio of the organic precursor, dopant compounds and the pyrolysis temperature. Some strategies have been developed to enhance the performance of the CA based supercapacitors, including activation, doping with metallic compounds, and combining with conducting polymers or other materials. Liu et al. prepared CO2 and KOH activated CAs and investigated their performance for supercapacitors.49 The activated-CAs exhibit a hierarchically porous structure with high specific surface area. There are three types of pores in the activated CAs: micropores (<2 nm), small mesoporous (2 nm–4 nm) and large pores (>30 nm). The KOH activated CAs possess a pore volume of 2.73 cm3 g−1 and a very large surface area of 2119 m2 g−1. Meanwhile, the KOH activated CAs exhibit a high capacitance of 250 F g−1 and a power density of 8.49 Wh kg−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. The high capacitance of the activated CA supercapacitors could be ascribed to the large surface area and the presence of a large number of micropores, which are beneficial to charge separation and transport.
Other porous carbons used in supercapacitors such as activated carbons and templated carbons are usually associated with problems of low efficiency. Although activated carbons have a high specific surface area of about 1000–2000 m2 g−1, there are not enough mesopores for the transportation of electrolyte ions, which results in a low electrolyte accessibility. The mismatch between the ion size of the electrolyte and the pore size of the electrode material is responsible for the low efficiency of activated carbons for supercapacitors. Similarly, templated carbons have highly ordered pores with consistent orientations and narrow pore size distribution. However, a single type of pore in the templated carbons is not good enough for the transportation of electrolyte ions. Moreover, the pores in templated carbons are usually accessible by a single channel, while the pores in CAs are all round and interconnected. The interconnected pores in CAs make the transportation of electrolyte ions much easier. Some researchers suggested that an appropriate pore size is more important for achieving high specific capacitance than achieving high surface area.49 In addition, large mesopores and macropores are crucial for EDLCs at a high charge–discharge current rate.49 Thus, the high capacitive performance of CA electrodes could be due to the presence of all the micropores, mesoporous and macropores. However, traditional CAs are usually associated with problems of poor mechanical properties which hinder them for application in flexible supercapacitors. There are also some other disadvantages of using CAs as electrodes in supercapacitors such as the difficulty in preparation and the use of expensive raw materials.
Doping CAs with metallic compounds is demonstrated to be an efficient approach for enhancing the capacitance of carbon aerogels. Lee et al. fabricated a series of metal doped CAs and applied them as electrode materials for supercapacitors.50 They found that the metal doped CAs show higher capacitance than that of the pure CAs. The Mn-doped CAs exhibited the highest capacitance of 107 F g−1, while Cu- and Fe-doped CAs showed the most stable cyclability. Other metallic compound doped CAs are also studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors, including Mn3O4-CAs,40 NiCo2O4-CAs,51 ZnO-CAs,52 FeOx-CAs,53 MnO2-CAs,54 SnO2-CAs,55 NiO-CAs,56 and RuO2-CAs.57 Chien et al. reported that NiCo2O4 doping can significantly enhance the capacitance of CAs.51Fig. 3a shows the representative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CA, NiCo2O4 aerogel and NiCo2O4–CA composite. The area of the CV curve of the NiCo2O4–CA composite is larger than that of both CA and NiCo2O4 aerogel, indicating an enhanced capacitance of the composites. The NiCo2O4–CA based supercapacitors show an ultrahigh specific capacitance of ∼1700 F g−1 at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 in a potential window of −0.05 to 0.5 V in 1 M NaOH aqueous solutions. The charge–discharge curves of the NiCo2O4–CA composite show a symmetric shape with no obvious internal electric resistances (I–R drops) (Fig. 3b). The capacitance obtained from the discharge curves reached a maximum of 1455 F g−1 after 600 cycles. CV curves of the NiCo2O4–CA composite at scan rates of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mV S−1 display similar shapes, demonstrating an excellent cycling stability (Fig. 3c). The cycle life test also demonstrates that the NiCo2O4–CAs supercapacitors have an excellent high rate capability by achieving a high specific capacitance above 800 F g−1 at a high scan rate of 500 mV s−1 and an outstanding cycling stability with retention of about 97.6% of the original capacitance after 2000 cycles of the charge–discharge test (Fig. 3d). The high performance of the composite materials could be due to the complete utilization of nickel cobaltite for pseudocapacitance generation.51 The composite structure could enable good exposure of nickel cobaltite to the electrolyte and the ease for the transportation of charge carriers, ions, and electrons. Another method available to enhance the performance of CA based supercapacitors is to modify the CAs with conducting polymers. An et al. fabricated polyaniline/CA composite materials by deposition of polyaniline polymers on the surface of CAs.58 The obtained polyaniline/CA composite was applied as an electrode material for supercapacitors, achieving a high specific capacitance of 710.7 F g−1, which is much higher than that of pure CAs (143.8 F g−1). Lv et al. fabricated CNT modified CAs for supercapacitors and obtained a specific capacitance of 141.3 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, which is 1.4 times higher than that of the original CAs.59 The studies on CA based supercapacitors are summarized in Table 1, where the synthetic methods and the capacitance values are compared.

3.2 Carbon nanotube based aerogels for supercapacitors
CNT aerogels are 3D porous networks that build up by using CNTs as building blocks. Many methods have been developed for the fabrication of CNT based aerogels, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods,28,60 freeze-drying,61,62 and critical-point-drying.63–65 For example, Zou et al. fabricated a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) aerogel by using a freeze-drying method.62Fig. 4 shows the fabrication procedures of the MWCNT aerogel. Pristine MWCNTs were first dispersed in chloroform via sonication by adding poly-(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate) (P3HT-b-PTMSPMA) as a surfactant and cross-linking agent. After that, the MWCNTs were crosslinked by polymers to form a wet gel. After the freeze-drying process, the wet gel was transformed into the MWCNT aerogel. The obtained MWCNT aerogel exhibited a low mass density of 4 mg cm−3, a high electrical conductivity of 3.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 and a very large surface area of 580 m2 g−1. Meanwhile, the MWCNT aerogel also showed excellent mechanical properties with small thickness reduction after 1000 cycles of the compression–recovery test. Recently, the fabrication of CNT based hybrid/composite aerogels is also studied extensively for a variety of applications. Qi et al. prepared cellulose–CNT hybrid aerogels by freeze-drying the wet-gel precursors.66 The composite aerogels showed excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability and good sensitivity to ambient pressure. They demonstrated that the cellulose–CNT hybird aerogels can be used as sensors for the detection of gases or volatile organic compounds. Sun et al. fabricated ultralight CNT–graphene composite aerogels by direct freeze-drying of CNTs and graphene mixed aqueous suspension.67 The 3D networks of the CNT–graphene composite aerogels were constructed with giant graphene walls and CNT ribs. The composite aerogels showed excellent integrated properties, such as outstanding elasticity, ultralow density (ρ ≥ 0.16 mg cm−3), excellent thermal stability, good electrical conductivity, and high adsorption capacities toward organic compounds. The CNT based aerogels not only hold the advantages of the CNTs, such as high electrical conductivities, high mechanical resilience and high thermal conductivity, but also exhibit the unique properties of aerogels (3D porous structure, low mass densities, continuous porosities, and high surface areas). These features suggest that CNT aerogels are suitable materials for application as polarizable electrodes in supercapacitors. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected networks with a large number of pores in the aerogels could provide a substrate for incorporating with other electrode materials such as activated carbon, metal oxides and conducting polymers, which further improves the capacitive properties of the aerogels.
 Fig. 4  Photographs show the fabrication steps of MWCNT aerogels. 
In the past decades, there has been mushrooming growth of research focusing on the fabrication of novel CNT based supercapacitors. The application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electrode materials for supercapacitors was first reported by Niu et al. in 1997.68 They demonstrated that nitric acid pretreated CNT electrodes exhibit a high surface area of 430 m2 g−1 and an enhanced specific capacitance of 102 F g−1. Recently, CNT aerogels are studied as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their unique structure and properties. Li et al. fabricated a CNT sponge (or aerogel) by using the CVD method.69 The 3D CNT sponge, consisting of interconnected conducting networks, can be easily compressed and recover most of its original scale (with small plastic deformation less than 5%). Cyclic voltammetry tests of the CNT sponge based electrodes under compressive strain of 50% showed the specific capacitance maintained over 90% of the original capacitance, and more than 70% of the capacitance retained under 80% strain. The results demonstrated that the above compressible and deformation tolerant electrodes can be used in flexible supercapacitors. CNT aerogels decorated with conducting polymers are also studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. For example, Lee et al. fabricated a transparent and flexible hybrid nanomembrane by coating CNT aerogel sheets with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene).70 The hybrid nanomembrane exhibited very high mechanical strength and flexibility, and was studied as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The obtained supercapacitors show a very large volumetric capacitance of ∼40 F cm−3 at 100 V s−1, a high volumetric energy of ∼70 Wh cm−3 and a power density of ∼7910 W cm−3. Polyaniline deposited on CNT sponge networks was prepared by Zhong et al.71 The free-standing and flexible polyaniline/CNT sponge composites are applied as electrode materials and deliver an excellent area capacitance of 1.85–1.62 F cm−2 with good cycle stability and high rate capability. CNT based composite aerogels prepared by incorporating CNTs with other carbonaceous materials such as cellulose nanofibers72 and mesoporous carbon73 are also fabricated and applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Deposition of CNT arrays on other 3D networks by using the CVD method can also lead to the formation of CNT based composite aerogels.60,74,75 For instance, Fang et al. reported the synthesis of Ni-microfiber-supported CNT aerogels by a catalytic CVD method.74 The CNT arrays are directly deposited on the surface of 3D Ni-microfiber networks. The obtained Ni-microfiber-supported CNT aerogel was further coated with polyimide and subsequently carbonized by pyrolysis to form a free-standing electrode. The composite electrode materials exhibited a high capacitance of 348 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 in 5 M KOH electrolyte. The high capacitance could be attributed to the unique 3D structure of the electrode and the doping with Ni. As an advanced material, CNT based aerogels show many advantages such as robust mechanical properties, excellent flexibility, high conductivity and high surface area. More importantly, other materials with high capacitive performance can be easily incorporated into the networks of the aerogels to form composite materials. And these advantages make the CNT based aerogels highly promising as lightweight and flexible supercapacitors for real-world applications. In spite of these excellent properties, the high cost of production of the CNT based aerogels still restricts their applications. The studies of CNT aerogel or CNT composite aerogel based supercapacitors are summarized in Table 2, where the synthetic methods and the capacitance values are also listed.

3.3 Graphene based hydrogels and aerogels for supercapacitors
Graphene, a one-atom-thick 2D carbon material, has been studied extensively in various fields due to its unique properties such as high mobility of charge carriers, excellent flexibility and intensity and superior thermal conductivity. The intrinsic capacitance of graphene was reported to be 21 mF cm−2. More importantly, graphene holds the advantages of large theoretical specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1), high conductivity and excellent chemical stability which provide great potential for capacitance applications. For example, Zhu et al. prepared an activated graphene oxide (GO) with an extremely high surface area of up to 3100 m2 g−1 and a high electrical conductivity.76 The activated GO was tested as electrode materials for supercapacitors, achieving a high specific capacitance of 166 F g−1 and a high energy density of ∼70 Wh kg−1 in ionic liquid electrolytes. However, these unique properties of graphene are usually relevant at the nanoscale so that this restrains its macroscopic application. In particular, graphene nanosheets easily agglomerate and restack into large paper-like structures which dramatically reduce its surface area and further harness its applications in electrochemical electrodes and composite materials.
Graphene based hydrogels and aerogels are 3D carbonaceous materials that were prepared by using graphene sheets as building blocks. The graphene hydrogels and aerogels not only inherit the advantages of graphene but also hold the unique properties of the hydrogels and aerogels. Some strategies have been developed for the synthesis of graphene, including exfoliation from graphite, epitaxial growth and CVD. It is difficult to manufacture graphene using the epitaxial growth and CVD methods at a large scale and these methods are associated with problems of high cost. The exfoliation method is suitable for scalable and low-cost production of graphene. Thus, exfoliated graphene has been widely used as a building block for fabrication of graphene based 3D materials.

3.3.1 Graphene based hydrogels for supercapacitors. 
In recent years, graphene based hydrogels and aerogels have been the subject of intensive investigation for application in supercapacitors. Generally, graphene based hydrogels are fabricated by using GO as building blocks. There are several methods for the gelation of GO, including self-assembly by hydrothermal reaction,77 ions or polymer induced gelation78 and cross-linking by chemical bonds.79 For example, graphene hydrogels prepared by hydrothermal treatment of GO suspension are reported by Xu et al. (Fig. 5).77 The graphene hydrogels exhibit strong mechanical properties, an excellent electric conductivity and a high specific capacitance of about 175 F g−1. Similarly, other researchers also reported the self-assembled graphene hydrogels prepared by hydrothermal reaction, exhibiting a high specific capacitance in the range of 186–308 F g−1.80–84 Graphene hydrogels can also be fabricated under mild conditions by using small molecules as reducing agents. For instance, self-assembled graphene hydrogels have been successfully fabricated by chemical reduction of GO with L-glutathione85 and sodium ascorbate,86 respectively. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on the L-glutathione reduced graphene hydrogels and nanostructured MnO2 showed a specific capacitance of 157.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. While the sodium ascorbate reduced graphene hydrogel based electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 240 F g−1 at a current density of 1.2 A g−1. Recently, Yang et al. fabricated a densely packed graphene hydrogel film by using a capillary compression method.87 They confirmed that the flexible graphene hydrogel films hold advantages of low ion transport resistance and high ion-accessible surface area, leading to excellent performance for supercapacitors (255.5 F cm−3 in aqueous electrolytes and 261.3 F cm−3 in organic electrolytes at a current density of 0.1 A g−1). The high performance of the densely packed graphene hydrogel films holds great potential for large-scale real-world applications due to the fact that the methods are essentially compatible with the traditional paper-making process and can be readily scaled up.

The porous structure of graphene hydrogels could allow the decoration of another nanomaterial into the 3D networks to form graphene hydrogel based composite materials. To further improve their applicability, composites, consisting of graphene hydrogels with other materials such as conducting polymers,88–90 metal oxides,91 and CNTs,92 could be expected to exhibit high performance for supercapacitors due to the synergetic effects. For example, Zhou et al. fabricated a hybrid hydrogel containing graphene and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT).89 They demonstrated that the hybrid hydrogel exhibits an excellent mechanical performance, a high specific capacitance of 174.4 F g−1 and a good electrical conductivity of 0.73 S cm−1. These predominant properties could be due to the synergetic combination of the excellent conducting, mechanical properties of graphene and the pseudo-capacitance of PEDOT. Surface functionalization of graphene hydrogels with molecules that can undergo reversible redox reactions could also lead to an enhanced capacitance for supercapacitors. Xu et al. prepared a modified graphene hydrogel by using hydroquinone as the functionalizing molecule, achieving an impressive specific capacitance of 441 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.93 Recently, graphene/Ni(OH)2 composite hydrogels have been successfully fabricated and applied as 3D electrode materials for supercapacitors.94 These hybrid hydrogels exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼1247 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with excellent cycling stability. Graphene hydrogels were deposited on 3D networks of nickel foams and applied as composite electrodes for supercapacitors.95 The composite electrode materials show a high capacitive performance which could be due to synergetic effects of the high conductivity and electrochemical stability of graphene hydrogels and the short distance of charge transfer from graphene hydrogels to the current collecting electrodes. The studies of graphene hydrogel based supercapacitors are summarized in Table 3, where the preparation method and the capacitance values are given.

3.3.2 Graphene based aerogels for supercapacitors. 
Replacing the infilling medium, water, of graphene hydrogels with air without collapsing the network structure can lead to the other 3D network, graphene aerogels. Generally, graphene aerogels are prepared by supercritical or freeze-drying of the graphene based wet gels. For instance, Chen et al. fabricated reduced-GO (rGO) aerogels by gelation of the rGO sheets in aqueous solution stepped by freeze-drying.96 The obtained rGO aerogels exhibit a 3D porous structure with high mechanical strength. The study of graphene aerogels for supercapacitors has been booming in recent years due to the fact that graphene aerogels are large 3D networks with a continuous porous structure and large surface area. The unique structure of graphene hydrogels could provide efficient ionic transportation and adsorption, leading to high performance for supercapacitors.
Recently, rGO aerogels have been successfully prepared and studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The rGO aerogels can be obtained by thermal reduction97 or H2 reduction98 of a GO aerogel, or by pre-reduction of GO in the wet gels stepped by freeze-drying or supercritical drying. Chemicals such as mercaptoacetic acid,96L-ascorbic acid99 and hypophosphorous acid/I2100 are applied for the gelation and reduction of GO. Liu et al. fabricated a flexible and folded structured graphene paper from the thermally reduced GO aerogels.97 They demonstrated that the graphene paper based electrodes showed better capacitive performance than the available carbon materials. Moreover, these kinds of electrodes are more flexible, free-standing, binder-free, and suitable for mass production.
Many researchers focus on the fabrication of graphene aerogel based composite materials for supercapacitors. For example, Wu et al. synthesized nitrogen and boron co-doped graphene aerogels by introducing ammonia boron trifluoride in the wet gels stepped by freeze-drying.101 They fabricated an all-solid-state supercapacitor by using the doped graphene aerogels as electrode materials and the PVA–H2SO4 gel as the electrolyte. The all-solid-state supercapacitors showed a specific capacitance of about 62 F g−1, an energy density of about 1600 W kg−1 and an excellent cycling stability. Organic molecules or polymers are also applied for the modification of graphene aerogels. For instance, carbohydrates, including glucose, β-cyclodextrin and chitosan, are employed for the synthesis of hybrid graphene-based aerogels.102 The carbohydrate modified graphene aerogels showed an excellent electrochemical behavior with strong and stable performance. Metal oxides are also introduced into the networks of graphene aerogels to form composite materials. Wu et al. fabricated graphene based composite aerogels by decorating metal oxides such as Co3O4 and RuO2 in the networks.103 The metal oxide loaded graphene aerogels exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 226 F g−1, a high rate capability and an excellent cycling stability, due to the synergetic effects of the pseudo-capacitive metal oxides and high surface area, high conductivity and electrochemical stability of the graphene aerogels. Meng and co-workers prepared graphene/carbon composite aerogels by embedding graphene into the precursor of carbon aerogels (resorcinol–formaldehyde).104 The composite aerogels exhibited a desirable specific capacitance (122 F g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1) with excellent rate performance. The reports of graphene aerogel based supercapacitors are summarized in Table 4, where the synthetic methods and the capacitance values are shown.

3.4 Biomass-derived hydrogels and aerogels for supercapacitors
Biomass derived carbonaceous materials have attracted significant interest due to their low cost, easy accessibility and environmentally friendly nature. Biomass derived hydrogels and aerogels are a large class of gels consisting of 3D solid networks and a lot of open pores. Benefiting from their unique structure and excellent properties, biomass derived gels have been studied extensively in supercapacitors both as electrolyte and electrode materials. Generally, the biomass-derived hydrogels can be used as gel electrolytes and as binders for fabrication of composite electrode materials. The biomass derived aerogels are usually applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Biomass derived carbonaceous hydrogels can be prepared by hydrothermal treatment of biomass6,105 or directly obtained from the crude natural polymers.106 As for binders' application, the 3D hydrogels serve as substrates for dispersion of electrochemical active materials to form composite electrodes. For example, DNA hydrogels were utilized as templates for binding of electrode materials,107 and chitosan hydrogels binding black pearl carbon were employed as electrodes for fabrication of all solid-state electrical double layer capacitors.106 Owing to the synergetic combination of the biocompatibility, the unique structure and strong mechanical properties, the biomass derived hydrogels could have great potential in supercapacitors for application as a power source for implantable biomedical devices. The biomass derived carbonaceous hydrogels are also widely used as electrolyte materials due to the fact that the 3D solid polymeric networks can adsorb and retain water. For example, Choudhury et al. reported the application of a natural gel, gelatin hydrogel, as a solid electrolyte for supercapacitors.108 The supercapacitor displayed an optimal capacitance of 81 F g−1. Yamazaki and co-workers fabricated novel composite hydrogels containing two kinds of natural materials, cellulose and chitin, and two kinds of ionic liquids.109 The hybrid hydrogels immersed in H2SO4 aqueous solution were applied as electrolytes for supercapacitors. The gel electrolyte based supercapacitors displayed an enhanced capacitance of 155 F g−1 with excellent high-rate discharge capability and durability. The advantages of good reliability, good biocompatibility and the absence of leakage of liquids could endow them great potential in supercapacitors for biomedical applications.
Biomass derived carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels are also studied extensively as electrode materials for supercapacitors due to the synergetic benefits obtained from the combination of the low-cost, sustainable biomass and the unique structure, large surface area and strong mechanical properties of the hydrogels and aerogels. Recently, we have fabricated carbonaceous gels by using crude biomass, watermelon as the source.6 The obtained carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels showed an interconnected microscopic structure with an average pore diameter of about 45.8 nm. We further decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the 3D network of the aerogels and transformed them into magnetic carbon aerogels by pyrolyzing. The magnetic carbon aerogels showed a very light weight and exhibited an excellent capacitance of 333.1 F g−1 and an outstanding cycling stability for supercapacitors (Fig. 6). As a natural hydrogel, bacterial cellulose has attracted increasing interest as a new material or substrate for a wide range of applications. The studies on bacterial cellulose (BC) based electrode materials have also boomed in recent years. For example, Lee et al. fabricated nanocarbons by using BC as a carbon source.110 The nanocarbon based electrodes displayed a specific capacitance of 42 F g−1 and an area-normalized specific capacitance of 1617 F cm−2. Other BC based composite materials are also studied as electrodes for supercapacitors, such as BC/PANI nanocomposites111 and BC/CNTs composite papers.112 Cellulose nanofibers are also studied extensively for the fabrication of composite aerogels. For example, hybrid aerogels containing cellulose nanofibers and rGO are fabricated by Gao et al.22 The obtained cellulose nanofibers/rGO hybrid aerogels are applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors, achieving a high capacitance of 207 F g−1. Similarly, cellulose nanofiber–multi-walled CNT aerogels are also synthesized and showed a specific capacitance of about 178 F g−1.113

4 Summary and outlook
In this feature article, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent advances of the applications of carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels for supercapacitors. The fabrication of all kinds of carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels, including polymer derived carbonaceous gels, carbon nanotube based carbonaceous gels, graphene based carbonaceous gels and biomass derived carbonaceous gels is discussed and the related synthetic methods are summarized. The applications of the carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels in supercapacitors are introduced and their performances are listed and compared. The polymer derived carbon aerogels have the advantages of high specific surface area and highly tunable pores which are beneficial to achieve a high performance for supercapacitors. The richness in resources is another advantage for the CAs. However, the poor mechanical properties hinder their application in flexible supercapacitors. CNT based aerogels and graphene based aerogels hold advantages of high conductivity, robust mechanical properties, excellent flexibility and high surface area. More importantly, many of the aerogels are free-standing, binder-free and easily mass produced. These advantages make them greatly promising as electrodes for lightweight and flexible supercapacitors. These supercapacitors are a suitable power source for portable and wearable electronic devices. In spite of these excellent properties, the high cost of raw materials and difficulty for production still restrict their applications. Biomass derived carbonaceous gels hold the advantages of abundant resources, low price and being environmentally friendly. However, the limited energy storage and rate capability restrain them from being applied in high performance supercapacitors.
As we can see, the unique structure and excellent properties of the carbonaceous gels could provide great application potential in supercapacitors. However, how to enhance their performance for supercapacitors is still a hot topic and the fabrication of composite electrode materials with more efficiency and sustainability is still a challenge. More importantly, immediate efforts should be made for the fabrication of flexible and wearable supercapacitors to meet the increasing demand of the market for portable and wearable electronic devices such as sportswear, wearable displays and embedded health monitoring. Significant progress in the development of novel type energy storage systems has been achieved over the past decade. As one of the promising energy storage systems, supercapacitors have achieved great success in the applications as power sources with high-performance and low-cost. Thanks to the rapid expansion of nanoscience, many neotype electrochemically active materials have been developed, especially the novel carbonaceous nanomaterials. The development and flourishing of these novel carbon materials (such as CNTs and graphene) provide great opportunities for the development of new energy storage systems or devices. Carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels as a large class of porous nanocarbons would also play an important role in the fabrication of neotype energy storage devices. Thus, we believe the applications of carbonaceous hydrogels and aerogels for next-generation energy storage systems such as supercapacitors will meet its golden age.
