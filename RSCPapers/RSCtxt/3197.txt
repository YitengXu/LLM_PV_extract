1. Introduction
Energy storage technologies have become a global concern over the last decades because of global climate change and the fossil energy shortage. Exploring alternative sources for energy production and storage becomes a current urgent task. Solar and wind power have been applied in energy storage technologies for years, but their intermittent nature limits large-scale applications. However, electrochemical energy storage technologies based on secondary batteries with lots of breakthroughs have recently started to become a promising choice.1 Battery systems are appropriate for energy integration and conversion because of their high efficiency and flexible characteristics. The advantages of batteries, long cycle life and relatively low maintenance, make them suitable to provide intermittent power output into grids. Besides, battery systems with different packing sizes can be adapted to various applications including cell phones, electric vehicles and urban power grids.
Up to now, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in energy storage applications such as portable devices and electric vehicles.2 The demand of lithium rapidly increases year by year, pushing up the price and making lithium resources less affordable. Thus, it is crucial to find an alternative technology beyond LIBs employing abundant elements on earth. Sodium becomes a suitable candidate due to its high abundance and low cost as well as the similar redox potential to lithium (ENa+/Na = −2.7 V versus standard hydrogen electrode, only 0.3 V above that of lithium). In fact, research in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is not newly developed. The discovery of high-temperature solid-state sodium conductors shed light on sodium electrochemistry.3 After that, sodium batteries operating at high temperature attracted much attention with the discovery of NASICON.4 Several decades later, along with the investigation of LIBs in the 1980s, the concept of SIBs was put forward.5 Whereas LIBs received rapid progress and advanced technology, SIBs faded out of researchers' sight gradually.
In the past few years, ambient-temperature SIBs with intercalation materials have gone through a revitalization due to the sustainable advantages and large-scale applications. Plenty of cathodes for SIBs have been studied while suitable anode materials are quite limited.6,7 Although graphite is widely used as the anode in commercialized LIBs, it shows a poor capacity performance in SIBs. Attempts have been made to modify graphite, but there are still some problems demanding solutions.8 Ti-based materials, including titanium dioxide and a series of Ti-containing compounds, have been widely investigated in photocatalysis, solar cells, and water splitting. In particular, owing to their exceptional chemical durability and crystalline structural diversity, Ti-based materials such as TiO2 (ref. 9–16) and Li4Ti5O12 (ref. 17–20) have now been recently explored in energy storage areas. In this review, we focus on the recent progress on nanostructured Ti-based anode materials for SIBs. The enhanced performances through rational design and hybridization as well as the sodium storage mechanism combined with computational simulation are summarized. Furthermore, SIBs based on Ti-based anodes operating in an aqueous electrolyte will be overviewed.
2. Ti-based anode materials
Titanium is the ninth most abundant element on earth. The most common oxide of Ti-based compounds is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which can be easily synthesized at low cost. There are four common polymorphs of TiO2 in nature: anatase, rutile, brookite and TiO2 bronze (TiO2-B). All these polymorphs are stable in ambient conditions, while the electrochemical properties vary from each other. When used in LIBs, the Li-ion intercalation/de-intercalation in TiO2 can be carried out by the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox in TiO6 octahedra.
Earlier research on the Li-ion intercalation mechanism was carried out on anatase TiO2. For a long time, the anatase phase was considered as the most electroactive and promising polymorph of TiO2. However, later research revealed that both the solid-state diffusion mechanism and the pseudocapacitive mechanism can exist in Li-ion insertion/extraction processes in some unique TiO2 nanostructures.21 The Li insertion potential in anatase is 1.8 V vs. Li/Li+, which is more anodic than other TiO2 polymorphs. Rutile TiO2, as the most stable polymorph in titanium dioxide, has been also studied for Li-ion insertion.22 The high density and slow Li diffusion kinetics limit its application in LIBs. Although no structural changes exist in brookite during Li insertion,23 the synthesis method for stable brookite remains a challenge. Those mentioned limitations can be partially avoided by the rational design of suitable nanostructures and preferable morphologies.
TiO2-B, a monoclinic TiO2 bronze phase, has attractive chemical properties compared to other TiO2 polymorphs. TiO2-B is able to store 1 Li+ per Ti, showing the highest theoretical capacity (335 mA h g−1) among all the TiO2 polymorphs. Due to its superior cyclability, safe lithiation potential, higher capacity and rate capability compared to those of other TiO2 polymorphs, TiO2-B has so far aroused much interest as an anode material in LIBs. In particular, both nanostructured and bulk TiO2-B can intercalate and de-intercalate Li-ions through a pseudocapacitive mechanism (a surface redox process), leading to a higher capacity and more stable rate capability.24 TiO2-B has a distinct open channel structure with the channels parallel to the b-axis, which contributes to the easier and faster Li-ion transportation. Also, the Li insertion potential of TiO2-B is about 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+ which is more cathodic than that of the anatase phase (Fig. 1).

Despite the recent advances in TiO2-based electrode materials, several issues still need to be addressed for their practical applications in LIBs. As a semiconductor material, TiO2 has a poor electrical conductivity. The low Li-ion conductivity or ion mobility is also a challenge. Nanostructuring may be an effective strategy to prompt the capability of Li-ion diffusion in TiO2 electrodes, benefiting from the shortened transport pathway of Li-ions. However, the reduced particle size of active materials could lower the tap density of the electrodes, thus decreasing the volumetric capacity. In addition, active Ti–O and Ti–OH groups as well as defects on the surface of nanostructured TiO2 may cause degradation of the electrolyte and irreversible trapping of Li-ions, and a high initial capacity loss may occur upon discharge/charge Li cycling. Over the last several years, several approaches have been developed to solve these problems. The most used strategy is carbon-coating such as carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide (GO), which can provide the mechanical support and improve the conductivity simultaneously. TiO2 with metal-ion doping25 and with the introduction of oxygen vacancies also shows a superior electrochemical performance compared to that of the pristine TiO2 materials.26 Furthermore, the controlled crystal growth based on a certain orientation can help to improve the capacity and rate capability. For example, anatase TiO2 with a high percentage of exposed (001) facets shows enhanced electrochemical performances.27
Compared with TiO2, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) has been successfully applied as an anode material in LIBs. The Li-ion (de-)intercalation process occurs at a potential of 1.55 V vs. Li/Li+. Due to the zero strain effect, LTO shows an excellent rate capability during fast charge/discharge processes.20 Recently, it has been demonstrated that Na-ions can also insert into LTO through a complex phase transformation different from that of Li-ions.28 Although the energy density of LTO is low with a theoretical capacity of 175 mA h g−1, some companies have already employed this material in cells for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The merits such as safety and reliability of LTO make it a promising alternative in commercialized LIBs and SIBs.
In the family of Ti-based electrode materials, Na2Ti3O7 is another potential option as an anode in SIBs. It has the lowest potential of Na-ion insertion ever reported among Ti-based oxides. Despite the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, Na2Ti3O7 still achieves a capacity of 120 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.29 In addition, sodium titanates with different stoichiometric ratios have been also studied as anodes in SIBs. In this review, we denote these sodium titanates as Na–Ti–O materials. The related progress of Na–Ti–O materials will be discussed in the following section.
Apart from SIBs using non-aqueous electrolytes, aqueous SIBs with Ti-based electrodes have attracted much attention. Owing to the appropriate redox potential and stable cycling performance, the NASICON-type compound NaTi2(PO4)3 becomes a suitable candidate for SIBs using aqueous electrolytes. The recent advances in Ti-based electrode materials for aqueous SIBs will be also summarized in this article.
3. Progress of Ti-based anode materials in SIBs
3.1 Ti-based anode materials in non-aqueous electrolytes

3.1.1 TiO2. 
Through different chemical preparation methods, plenty of morphologies of nanostructured TiO2 have been successfully achieved, such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanosheets and nanoparticles. TiO2 has attracted much attention as a Li insertion/de-insertion electrode material, holding a great promise in LIBs and other devices. The radius of Na-ions is 1.02 Å, which is close to that of Li-ions (0.76 Å). This minor difference in ionic radius makes TiO2 a proper candidate for applications in SIBs. Based on the fact that Li-ions insert into anodes through a diffusion-controlled mechanism, the tube-like morphology becomes a good choice for Na-ion transportation. Rajh and co-workers prepared amorphous TiO2 nanotubes through electrochemical anodization on a Ti foil.30 The direct growth of amorphous TiO2 nanotubes on a current collector without using carbon additives and binders facilitated efficient electron transport. Over the potential range from 0.9 to 2.5 V at a rate of C/3 (∼0.05 A g−1), an initial specific capacity of 75 mA h g−1 and a discharge capacity of 150 mA h g−1 after 15 cycles were obtained. It is suggested by the authors that the self-improving capacity in Na-ion systems occurs at a low rate. Na-ions first diffuse into the pores of nanotubes, gather around the reduced Ti atoms, and then diffuse into the TiO2 matrix when the concentration of Na-ions reaches a certain value. It is known that there are mainly three charge storage mechanisms in electrode materials: the traditional diffusion-controlled mechanism (faradaic), the surface redox process also referred to as pseudocapacitance (faradaic), and double layer capacitance (non-faradaic).24 The contribution from each process can be characterized by analyzing the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles with different scan rates according to the following equation:31 i = avb(1)where the current i keeps a relationship with the scan rate v. Based on this general relationship, the current and scan rate can evaluate the value of b, which can help to determine the mechanisms for the charge storage process. According to classic electrochemical theory: i = 0.4958nFAc(DαnFv/RT)1/2(2) i = vC(3)When b = 0.5 this stands for a diffusion-controlled process, while when b = 1 this is referred to as a surface redox process. The calculation in Rajh's work shows that the value of b is around 0.9. Therefore, it is determined that Na-ions insert into amorphous TiO2 nanotubes based on a mixed mechanism. Both the diffusion process and the surface redox process contribute to the total capacity. These findings shed some light on the Na storage mechanism for Na-ion insertion/extraction in TiO2-based electrode materials. To improve the electrochemical performance, Dai and co-workers fabricated self-organized amorphous TiO2 nanotubes on a porous Ti foam though an electrochemical anodization technique.32 The nanotube arrays grown on the porous Ti foam exhibited a higher capacity than those grown on a normal Ti foil. The higher surface area of the Ti foam and the porosity of the TiO2 nanotubes are assigned to the enhanced capacity. A self-improving capacity was also found in a Na half cell at a low charge/discharge rate. To optimize the nanotube materials, Tirado's group prepared TiO2 nanotubes using different anodizing voltages and reaction times to explore the electrochemical properties.33 It is found that TiO2 nanotubes of 30–70 μm in length show better electrochemical performances for both Li-ion and Na-ion insertion. Specific capacities of around 160–106 mA h g−1 were achieved in the TiO2 nanotubes of 38 μm in length when cycled in the range of 0.5–2.6 V vs. Na. However, longer TiO2 nanotubes of 100–200 μm delivered much lower capacities, mainly arising from the slower kinetics and irreversible surface reactions (Fig. 2).

Generally, TiO2 nanotubes synthesized through electrochemical anodization are amorphous. They could be transformed into the crystalline anatase phase by thermal treatment.34 Tirado and co-workers reported that the anatase nanotubes composed of TiO2 nanocrystals are maintained after continuous Na-ion intercalation/extraction cycles. During the potential range of 0.5–2.6 V, the surface redox process mainly contributes to the Na cycling. Unlike single-walled nanotubes, double-walled TiO2 nanotubes have been synthesized by Alcantara and co-workers through a one-step anodization strategy under a voltage ramp.35 The nanotubes were further annealed to form the anatase phase at 550 °C in air for 3 h. As a result of the increased surface area and pseudocapacitance, the double-walled TiO2 structures exhibit enhanced electrochemical Na storage performances. According to the traditional diffusion-controlled mechanism in LIBs, it is believed that the structures with channels and pores can also operate in SIBs. However, the pseudocapacitive contribution (or the surface redox process) existing in SIBs renovates the insight into the Na storage mechanism. Apart from TiO2 nanotubes, the Na storage behaviors of anatase with other morphologies have been explored. For instance, Mitlin et al. prepared anatase TiO2 nanocrystals of 10–15 nm by a template method using titanium isopropoxide as a Ti precursor followed by the hydrolysis treatment and annealing process.36 Composed of edge-sharing TiO6 octahedra, it is known that anatase TiO2 has a three-dimensional (3D) network structure formed by stacking of 1D zigzag chains. These empty zigzag channels offer possible sites for Na-ion accommodation and suitable pathways for Na-ion diffusion. A broad peak in the CV profile during the potential range of 0.2–1.2 V suggests a capacitive contribution to the overall capacity. This is the first report on nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 as an anode material for SIBs. In addition, the electrolyte may also influence the electrochemical performances of TiO2. Passerini and co-workers carried out a thorough electrochemical characterization on commercialized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles as anodes in SIBs using different electrolytes.37 The results showed that the anatase electrode exhibits an excellent rate capability when 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) solution was used as the electrolyte. In addition to anatase nanocrystals and nanoparticles, some unusual structures of anatase TiO2 have been fabricated. Iso-oriented anatase TiO2 mesocages have been successfully synthesized by Wei et al.38 A pseudocapacitive mechanism was proposed for the Na-ion insertion in the anatase mesocages over the potential range of 0.01–2.5 V. Also, Ji and co-workers prepared cube-like anatase through a hydrothermal process using tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) as a hydrolysis precursor.39 The electrode made of TiO2 nanocubes shows an excellent cycling performance and rate capability. The specific capacity remains at 108 mA h g−1 even at a rate of 10C. The capacity loss is less than 10% after 1000 cycles at rates of 2C and 10C. According to the first-principles calculation, the authors suggest that this enhanced performance is related to the {100} facets around the nanocubes. The {100} facets have a higher attachment energy than that of other facets, and therefore are more favourable for Na-ion accommodation (Fig. 3).

TiO2-B, namely the TiO2 bronze phase, has been widely employed as an anode in SIBs in recent years for its high theoretical capacity and the monoclinic structure with open channels along the b-axis. It is considered that the large interlayer spaces in TiO2-B provide sites for Na-ion intercalation. Gao et al. first reported the Na storage performance in TiO2-B anodes.40 TiO2-B nanotubes exhibit a first discharge capacity of 132.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 40 mA g−1. The slope of the charge–discharge curves shows that the solid-solution mechanism dominates the Na-ion insertion process in TiO2-B nanotubes. Recently, noodle-like TiO2-B secondary particles were synthesized by a one-pot route based on TiCl3 hydrolysis.41 The secondary particles have an average size of about 250–350 nm, composed of nanoparticles of 10–20 nm. The TiO2-B electrode exhibits a reversible specific capacity of about 100 mA h g−1. No obvious cathodic or anodic current peak was observed in the CV curves in the potential range of 0.1–2.0 V, indicating a pseudocapacitive Na storage process, similar to the trend of amorphous TiO2.
In addition to the anatase and TiO2-B phases, the electrochemical behavior of other polymorphs has been studied for Na storage applications. For example, Ji and co-workers reported that rutile TiO2 microspheres anchored by nanoneedle clusters were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method.42 The electrode made of rutile microspheres shows an initial specific discharge capacity of 308.8 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 121.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 200 cycles. It is believed that the 3D structure provides a high surface area and contact area with the electrolyte, ensuring a high capacity and rate performance in sodiation and de-sodiation processes. Besides, rutile TiO2 mesocrystals composed of nanoparticles exhibit a high reversible capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1.43
Hollandite-type TiO2, an uncommon polymorph of TiO2, was also explored as an anode in SIBs.44 The electrode of hollandite-type TiO2 exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 280 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 85 mA h g−1 at a C/8 rate over the potential range of 0.2–2.5 V. Although far from the theoretical capacity (335 mA h g−1), the TiO2 (H) phase is still considered as an interesting anode for SIBs.
In terms of photocatalysts, it is believed that TiO2 with dual phases exhibits a better photocatalytic activity. Inspired by this, bi-phase TiO2 has been recently employed as an anode in LIBs and SIBs. Bi-crystalline TiO2 spheres with anatase and TiO2-B phases have been synthesized through a one-pot solvothermal method.45 The dual-phase spheres have a core–shell structure with TiO2-B nanosheets surrounding the anatase core composed of nanoparticles. The anode made of anatase@TiO2-B spheres shows a capacity of 131 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 170 mA g−1 in Na-ion half cells. After cycling at 850 mA g−1, a capacity of 168.6 mA h g−1 is restored when the current density reduced to 85 mA g−1, indicating a superior Na storage capability.
The investigation on pristine TiO2 materials helps to understand the fundamental behavior of the Na-ion insertion/extraction process. To further enhance the cyclability and rate capability, meanwhile, and increase the electron and ion conductivity of TiO2 materials, carbonaceous coating/hybridizing and element doping have been considered as effective methods in recent years. Anatase TiO2 nanorods coated by carbonization of pitch show an electric conductivity of 1.8 × 10−1 S cm−1, which is much higher than that of pristine TiO2 (6.9 × 10−6 S cm−1).46 The anode of carbon-coated TiO2 nanorods exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 193 mA h g−1 in the potential range of 0–3 V. Even at a rate of 100C, a capacity of 53 mA h g−1 is achieved. Passerini and co-workers reported that carbon-coated anatase nanotubes exhibit a reversible capacity of 170 mA h g−1 at C/10, and a capacity of around 100 mA h g−1 at 2C.47
Nanoparticles as carbonization substrates as anodes in SIBs have also been reported recently. For example, Sun and co-workers fabricated an anode made of carbon-coated anatase microspheres prepared by a hydrothermal route, where sucrose was used as the carbon source.48 TiO2 microspheres with a 6.8 wt% carbon coating exhibit an excellent electrochemical performance: nearly 100% capacity retention after 50 cycles and a good rate capability (82.7 mA h g−1 at a rate of 10C). A polymerization-induced phase separation process was developed by Vogt and co-workers to prepare a porous carbon/TiO2 composite.49 The composite electrode shows less than a 10% fade in capacity even at 5C. Thermolysis of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was also used to coat anatase TiO2 nanoparticles.50 Hollow structures can provide good contact with the electrolyte and alleviate the volume expansion, leading to a better performance than the normal solid spherical structure. Zhang and co-workers prepared TiO2/carbon hollow spheres via a template method using SiO2 as the template and dopamine as the carbon precursor.51 The carbon-coated hollow TiO2 spheres exhibit enhanced cyclability and rate capability compared to that of bare TiO2 spheres. In addition, it is demonstrated that carbon-coated amorphous TiO2 solid spheres exhibit superior performances compared to TiO2 solid spheres and pristine anatase TiO2.52 Furthermore, the sodium storage properties of carbon-coated TiO2 hollow spheres with controlled crystal phases were explored.53 Carbon-coated anatase TiO2 hollow spheres show superior electrochemical Na storage performances to amorphous and rutile TiO2 (Fig. 4).

In addition to carbon-coating, element doping is effective at improving the electrochemical properties of TiO2-based anode materials. Nb-doped rutile TiO2 was synthesized by a sol–gel method followed by gas deposition, and delivers a reversible capacity of 160 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.54 Sn-doped TiO2 nanotubes show a charge capacity of 257 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and 103 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1.55
Owing to its high electrical conductivity and mechanical support, graphene has been intensively investigated as an electrode material for energy storage applications. Hybridizing with graphene or graphene oxide is considered as an important and effective method to improve the electrochemical performance. TiO2 nanoparticles grown on N-doped open channelled graphene exhibit a reversible capacity of 405 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and 250 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.56 The open pores in graphene may facilitate electron transfer and the N doping may increase the wettability between the electrode and the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the crystal defects can provide ion adsorption sites. Nowadays, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has become a popular choice in carbonaceous hybridization because of its high conductivity, specific surface area and chemical stability. Through an ultraphonic and reflux method, Jiao and co-workers synthesized ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles on rGO nanosheets.57 The nanoparticles of around 10 nm are uniformly dispersed on the rGO sheets. A capacity of 186.6 mA h g−1 was achieved at 0.1 A g−1, and 112.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. The superior electrochemical performance mainly results from the conductive networks of rGO and the synergetic effects between the well-dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles and the rGO substrate. Anatase TiO2 nanofibers wrapped by rGO sheets via electrospinning exhibit a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.7% at a rate of 5C.58 Our group synthesized a graphene-coupled TiO2 nanocomposite material through a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process using TiCl3 as the Ti precursor.59 The resulting TiO2/graphene hybrid containing a dual crystal phase of TiO2 (76.9 wt% TiO2-B and 23.1 wt% anatase) exhibits a high reversible capacity even after 4000 cycles, and a specific capacity of 90 mA h g−1 at a rate of around 36C. The CV curves revealed that the Na+ intercalation process was dominated by a pseudocapacitive mechanism which is a unique electrochemical property of TiO2-B phases. First-principles calculation suggests that the excellent cyclability and rate capability are attributed to the reduced energy barrier and the unique synergetic effects between TiO2 nanoparticles and the rGO substrate (Fig. 5).

Some special designs for TiO2-based materials were employed to improve the electrochemical performance in SIBs. N-doped TiO2 nanorods supported with carbon dots were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route.60 The electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capability. Partially F-doped anatase TiO2 embedded on a carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate was synthesized.61 The formation of Ti3+ and the CNTs helps to improve the electronic conductivity, and meanwhile the structure remains even at a high rate. Nanostructured black anatase TiO2 with oxygen vacancies has been investigated as an anode in LIBs.62 The oxygen vacancies induce Ti3+ self-doping and change the host structure of anatase TiO2, leading to improved electronic conductivity and electrochemical performances. The Na-ion intercalation properties of anatase TiO2 with oxygen vacancies were recently explored by Ji and co-workers.63 The electrode of black anatase titania delivers a reversible capacity of 91.2 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 20C. Highly ordered 3D Ni–TiO2 nanoarrays fabricated through a nanoimprited AAO template method show a capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, and a capacity of 95 mA h g−1 when the rate reached 5 A g−1.64 Most recently, self-supported TiO2 nanotube arrays with sulfur doping exhibited outstanding cyclability and rate performance.65


3.1.2 Na–Ti–O materials. 
The structure of Na2Ti3O7 is composed of zigzag Ti–O octahedra layers with Na-ions in the interlayer space. Palacin and co-workers reported that Na2Ti3O7 can accommodate 2 Na-ions per unit, showing a capacity of 200 mA h g−1.66 Hu and co-workers carried out an investigation in detail on the charge storage mechanism and Na-ion transport properties of Na2Ti3O7.29 The microsized electrode shows a reversible capacity of 188 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in 1 M NaClO4 in PC electrolyte with sodium alginate as the binder. Combined with first-principles calculation, a vacancy hopping mechanism was proposed with three energy favourable specific trajectories analyzed. Recently, the Na storage behaviors of Na2Ti3O7 materials with different morphologies have been explored. Balaya and co-workers fabricated microsized Na2Ti3O7 composed of agglomerated microplates of 5–50 μm.67 Single crystalline Na2Ti3O7 rods were obtained with a precursor synthesized via a reverse micelle method.68 Na2Ti3O7 microspheres composed of tiny nanotubes prepared through a hydrothermal route exhibit a good cycle life and rate performance, mainly due to the increased specific surface area and larger contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte.69 The 3D spider web architecture made of Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes that are grown on the Ti substrate via a hydrothermal method was directly used as the electrode without any additives (binders and conducting agents), and exhibits an excellent cycling performance and rate capability.70 The Na2Ti3O7/C composite synthesized through a rheological phase method exhibits a better performance than that of pristine Na2Ti3O7 with a specific capacity of 111.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C.71
In addition to Na2Ti3O7, the Na storage ability of other Na-containing titanium oxides with different stoichiometry has been demonstrated. For instance, continuous 2D channels in monoclinic Na4Ti5O12 (M–Na4Ti5O12) have been synthesized and employed as an anode it can provide the pathway and space for Na-ion intercalation.72 Shen et al. synthesized Na2Ti6O13 electrode material through ball milling Na2CO3 and anatase TiO2 followed by annealing, and the resulting Na2Ti6O13 anode exhibits a reversible capacity of nearly 200 mA h g−1.73 The binder-free anode made of Na2Ti7O15 nanotubes that were in situ grown on the Ti net substrate through a hydrothermal route exhibits a reversible capacity of 130 mA h g−1 even at a rate of 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles.74 Recently, Ceder's group reported a layered O3-type NaTiO2 material through a solid-state reaction using Na metal to reduce anatase TiO2.75 It is demonstrated that nearly 0.5 Na can be reversibly inserted into NaTiO2, delivering a reversible capacity of 152 mA h g−1. A reversible O3 to O′3 phase change was observed by in situ X-ray diffraction during the Na-ion intercalation process. Moreover, a series of sodium titanates were synthesized through a facile electrochemical method using molten salts of NaF–NaCl–NaI with solid TiO2.76 The single-phase Na0.23TiO2 and Na0.46TiO2 exhibit capacities of 185 and 213 mA h g−1. No obvious capacity fading was observed after 500 cycles owing to the 3D porous structure. This research provides new insight in the low-cost electrochemical synthesis for sodium titanates as electrode materials in SIBs (Fig. 6).

3.1.3 Li4Ti5O12. 
Spinel Li4Ti5O12, which is famous for its zero strain effect as an anode in the Li intercalation process, has been investigated as an anode material in SIBs in recent years. It is interesting and worth noting that Li4Ti5O12 can accommodate Na-ions as well as Li. Hu's group reported its application in sodium storage for the first time in 2012.77 The Li4Ti5O12 electrode exhibits an average Na insertion potential of about 1.0 V, and delivers a reversible capacity of 145 mA h g−1. Confirmed by CV curves and ex situ XRD patterns, it is believed that the sodium intercalation mechanism in Li4Ti5O12 differs from that of Li: after 3 Na inserted, the final phase becomes a mixture of LiNa6Ti5O12 and Li7Ti5O12. These results lay the foundation of further investigation. Atomic-scale investigation on the Na storage mechanism in Li4Ti5O12 was further carried out.28 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proposed a possible three-phase mechanism: 2Li4Ti5O12 + Na+ + 6e− ↔ 2Li7Ti5O12 + Na6LiTi5O12, which was confirmed by in situ synchrotron XRD and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The average Na storage potential is 0.91 V. With a suitable binder and electrolyte, the electrode could provide a reversible capacity of 155 mA h g−1 in SIBs. With the help of an advanced characterization technique, in situ synchrotron XRD, the mechanism of Na-ion insertion into Li4Ti5O12 was further clarified.78 It turns out that Na-ion intercalation into Li4Ti5O12 is size-dependent. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of Na-ions is much smaller than that of Li-ions, revealing sluggish Na-ion diffusion kinetics in Li4Ti5O12 (Fig. 7).

Based on the earlier research on the Na-ion storage mechanism, the morphology control and structure design of Li4Ti5O12 have attracted much attention recently. For example, textured Li4Ti5O12 thin films have been synthesized through a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method for Na-ion storage properties.79 This study focused on the size (thickness) effect on the Li4Ti5O12 material. It is demonstrated that half the capacity contribution came from the pseudocapacitive process, which is closely related to the thin film structure. This binder-free and additive-free thin film Li4Ti5O12 material exhibits intrinsic Na storage properties. Hasegawa and co-workers reported a hierarchically porous Li4Ti5O12 material with flower-like morphologies and explored the Na storage performance.80 Li4Ti5O12 nanorods synthesized through a hydrothermal method using TiO2-B as the Ti source deliver a reversible capacity of 131.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1C over 100 cycles (Fig. 8).81

3.2 Ti-based anode materials in aqueous electrolytes
The investigations of Ti-based materials as anodes in SIBs mentioned above are operating in organic (non-aqueous) electrolytes, which usually consist of NaClO4 dissolved in solvents such as PC, EC and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Although sodium microcells with non-aqueous electrolytes are intensively studied in laboratories all over the world, the high cost of organic agents, strict control of humidity, and safety issues (organic electrolyte is flammable) make non-aqueous SIBs less affordable and unsafe for large-scale applications. One alternative approach to overcome these challenges would be using aqueous electrolytes. Several kinds of cathode materials have been proven to function well in aqueous systems. Therefore, it is urgent and vital to find suitable and matchable anode materials. NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 has been studied as an anode material in aqueous LIBs.82,83 Inspired by this, NaTi2(PO4)3 may also find applications as anode materials in aqueous SIBs.
Okada and co-workers first reported the properties of NaTi2(PO4)3 that works in aqueous cells.84 The NaTi2(PO4)3 powder was synthesized through the Pechini method. A three-electrode electrochemical cell was used in an aqueous solution of 2 M Na2SO4 for the measurements of CV and charge/discharge tests. The reference and counter electrode were the Ag/AgCl electrode and pure Zn, respectively. At a rate of 2 mA cm−2 in aqueous electrolyte, the cycling stability of the NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode is superior to that in a non-aqueous system. This is the first report that sodium-ions can reversibly intercalate into NaTi2(PO4)3 with no significant structure change in an aqueous electrolyte. To make the synthesis method simpler and more convenient, microwave-assisted synthesis can provide uniform heating and reduced steps with a shortened reaction time. Wu et al. reported a microwave synthesis route for the first time for the synthesis of NaTi2(PO4)3 using graphite as the carbon-coating agent and the resulting NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode exhibits a discharge capacity of 85 mA h g−1 (Fig. 9).85
 Fig. 9  Comparison of cyclic performance of carbothermally treated NaTi2(PO4)3 in an organic electrolyte of 1 M NaClO4/EC:DMC (1:1 in volume) and aqueous electrolyte with 2 M Na2SO4 at a current density of 2.0 mA cm−2. Reproduced from ref. 84 with permission from the Electrochemical Society. 
Although NaTi2(PO4)3 presents a suitable redox plateau (about 0.6 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) and can accommodate 2 Na-ions during intercalation/de-intercalation processes, delivering a theoretical capacity of 133 mA h g−1, the low electronic conductivity remains a challenge. Just like other Ti-based materials, carbon-coating and carbonaceous hybridization are effective methods to improve the electronic conductivity and further enhance the electrochemical performance. Carbon-coating, graphite-coating and graphene composites have been reported for improving the performance of NaTi2(PO4)3. For example, graphene-supported NaTi2(PO4)3 has been synthesized through a sol–gel method followed by annealing.86 The obtained NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode containing 6.84% graphene exhibits a discharge capacity of 63.5 mA h g−1 at 20C. Wu et al. investigated the effect of carbonaceous additives on the electrochemical performance of NaTi2(PO4)3. The electrochemical behavior of NaTi2(PO4)3 containing intimate carbon (graphite or carbon nanotubes introduced as a precursor) was characterized.87 Results show that graphite-coated NaTi2(PO4)3 with additive carbon nanotubes exhibits an excellent performance in aqueous cells, and a capacity retention of 86% was reached at 1C after 100 cycles.
Apart from carbon-coating, rational structure design is beneficial to deliver enhanced performance. 3D porous networks with hierarchical structures are the ideal candidate to improve the electrochemical performance, due to the large surface area, structural stability and efficient ion transport. Such a design has been provedn in NaTi2(PO4)3 electrodes. For example, Deng's group synthesized self-assembled wafer-like porous NaTi2(PO4)3 nanostructures with hierarchical carbon as the anode material in aqueous SIBs with Na0.44MnO2 as the cathode.88 A superior cycling stability and rate performance were achieved. Deng et al. also synthesized a frogspawn-like architecture of NaTi2(PO4)3 through an impregnation process.89 The NaTi2(PO4)3/C skeleton was connected by hollow carbon spheres with NaTi2(PO4)3 nanospheres filling in the hollow space. This unique 3D nanostructure provides better electron/ion transport and good stability, leading to excellent cyclability and rate performance. When tested in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with Na0.44MnO2 as the cathode, the full cell exhibits ultralong cycling performance at different rates, which is among the best of the aqueous SIBs. It is believed that unique 3D architectures can provide efficient ion/electron transport, stable mechanical support and electrolyte wettability, which makes such designs attractive and suitable for high-power applications. Recently, a new design of aqueous SIB consisting of NaTi2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 has been investigated by Li and co-workers.90 This full aqueous battery was fabricated by all NASICON-structure electrodes. The full cell exhibits a plateau of 1.2 V and a great performance even at high current densities. This battery design can be a promising candidate for low-cost and high-voltage applications (Fig. 10).

4. Summary and outlook
With the future cost and sustainability of lithium resources becoming a global concern, developing a high-energy density and low-cost rechargeable battery system that can be employed for diverse energy storage applications is of great importance. SIBs operating at ambient temperature have again become a suitable candidate for stationary and large-scale energy storage. The past decade has witnessed plenty of breakthroughs in the study of electrode materials of SIBs. A variety of layered sodium metal oxides have been proven to be suitable cathode materials and can be commercialized for practical uses. The sodium storage properties of different kinds of anode materials have been investigated during the past few years such as hard carbon materials, transition metal oxides and alloys. Similar to LIBs, SIBs based on intercalation chemistry have achieved several developments over the past few years. As one of them, titanium dioxide has the advantage of high abundance, low cost and safety, which holds promise for sodium storage in the future. Other Ti-based anode materials, such as Na2Ti3O7, exhibit a low operating potential, but still face the challenge of the unstable SEI layer.
In this review, we have summarized the recent progress and development of Ti-based anode materials in SIBs. The rational structural design, suitable material composites and matchable electrolyte systems can promote the electrochemical performance and alleviate problems for large-scale applications. It is believed that carbonaceous hybridization and unique nanostructures can be effective designs to improve the specific capacity, cyclability and rate performance. Suitable electrolyte systems are also proven to be beneficial to enhance the sodium storage performance. By virtue of advanced characterization technologies such as in situ XRD and STEM combined with first-principles calculations, the sodium-ion storage and transport mechanism along with the phase transformation occurring in host structures have been proposed and analyzed. New insights on synthesis methods and modifying strategies for Ti-based anode materials have been put forward.
Although significant progress has been realized in recent years, we hold the opinion that the following issues should be paid more attention to in future research. Firstly, the poor electronic conductivity of TiO2 remains a big challenge. Appropriate carbonaceous hybridization is proven to be an effective method. Introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 along with the hydrogenation method seems to be a future trend to enhance the electronic and ionic conductivity of host materials. Secondly, future work should be done to explore the electrolyte systems, although electrolyte chemistry is not involved much in this review. To date, the use of NaClO4 salt is extensive and widespread. Other electrolytes such as NaPF6 and sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) have also been investigated as the Na salt. In addition to the carbonate solvents, ethers are demonstrated to be helpful to enhance the sodium storage performance. Moreover, additives such as fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) are found to improve the cyclability. Further exploration on the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte should be carried out with a modified design of electrolyte systems that could result in enhanced performances. Of course, the electrolytes with a lower cost are worth developing for large-scale applications. Finally, in-depth investigation of the Na-ion transport mechanism is in great need. Understanding of the intercalation mechanism as well as the phase transformation process will provide more theoretical references for structural designs and help to alleviate problems such as low initial coulombic efficiency and poor rate performance. In conclusion, the understanding of Ti-based materials operating in Na systems is in the primary stage and challenges still exist for large-scale and high-power applications. The poor electrical conductivity is intrinsic for semiconductor materials and the specific capacity of Ti-based materials is limited. However, it is widely accepted that Ti-based materials have the advantages of structural stability, high abundance, non-toxicity and low cost. It is hopeful that Ti-based materials could be an ideal candidate to overcome the difficulties of current electrodes in SIBs and might be applied in other energy storage and conversion areas.
