    , Accepted 14th July 2020First published on 14th July 2020AbstractLow-cost and efficient multifunctional electrodes play an important part in promoting the practical application of energy conversion and storage. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of N-graphyne, with a novel structure, by one-step ball milling of CaC2 and pyrazine. The accurate doping of nitrogen atoms at the controllable sites of the molecular skeleton of γ-graphyne was achieved using the nitrogenous precursor (pyrazine) as a reactant. Various techniques were adopted for the investigation of the composition, structure, and morphology of the obtained samples. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that N-graphyne can serve as an excellent electrode material for both electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. As an electrocatalyst, N-graphyne exhibited an overpotential of 280 mV at 100 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 122 mV dec−1 for the oxygen evolution reaction with highly stable morphology and electrocatalytic performance. As a supercapacitor electrode, N-graphyne showed a maximum capacitance of 235 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and capacitance retention of 87% after 3000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of N-graphyne is due to the nitrogen heteroatomic defects, large electrochemical active surface areas and fast electron migration. Our studies provide a facile synthesis of novel N-graphyne with controllable doping sites and promote its potential applications in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.
1. Introduction
The decreasing fossil fuels and increasing environmental problems make it imperative to explore effective materials/devices for clean and renewable energy conversion/storage.1–3 To date, electrocatalysis of water and supercapacitors is regarded as a prospective technology to achieve electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Firstly, the electrocatalytic water splitting is an environmentally friendly route for producing oxygen and hydrogen for the supply of clean fuels, which could ease the energy crisis.4–7 Secondly, the supercapacitor is one of the effective devices for energy storage because of its low maintenance cost, long cycle stability, high power density, and unique rate capacity.8–13 The design and development of low-cost, highly active, earth-abundant, and durable materials are crucial for promoting the practical application of electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitors.
As reported, carbon materials (fullerenes, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphynes, etc.) have exhibited excellent electrochemical properties for sustainable energy conversion and storage.14–18 Recently, graphyne, a new member of the carbon family, has attracted much attention as an electrode material for electrocatalysis and supercapacitors in both scientific experiments and theoretical calculations due to its high electron/hole mobility, large surface area, excellent stability, and quantum Hall effects.19,20 Graphynes, with hybrid networks containing only sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, can be simply classified into graphyne and graphdiyne according to the number of “–CC–” linkages between two sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. Generally, there is one acetylenic (–CC–) linkage, and two acetylenic (diacetylenic) linkages (–CC–CC–) between two sp2 hybridized carbons for graphyne and graphdiyne, respectively. Compared with other carbon members, extraordinary electronic and optical properties can be found for graphynes due to the presence of alkynyl groups.21,22 Li et al.23 investigated the in situ formation of CoNx@graphdiyne on nickel foam by a hydrothermal reaction. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was confirmed by the low overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, which were 70 mV and 260 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Chen et al.24 synthesized the nanocomposite of MnO2@graphdiyne oxides to improve the performance of supercapacitors. The electrochemical measurements revealed that the MnO2@graphdiyne oxide composite exhibited a high capacitance of 301 F g−1 at the current density of 0.2 A g−1, as compared with pristine MnO2 (100 F g−1).24 Although graphynes have been demonstrated to show superior electrochemical performance in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors, the expensive and complicated fabrication procedure for graphynes is still a great challenge for speeding up their scientific research process.
Doped graphynes have been demonstrated to provide further benefits for energy applications. It is well-known that nitrogen doping can adjust the physical and chemical properties of carbon materials, thus improving electronic conductivity and activity.25–27 The electron distribution in graphynes can be affected by the doping of nitrogen heteroatoms, which can enhance the electro-active surface area and the wettability. Moreover, pseudocapacitance can be introduced to the system by the active nitrogen atom, which can improve the supercapacitor performance. Secondly, the introduction of nitrogen atoms will cause local tension and structural deformation to produce micropores in graphynes. A variety of research revealed that a certain amount of micropores can significantly contribute to electron transfer.28 Therefore, doping N atoms into graphynes is a good alternative for the improvement of the electrochemical properties of graphynes, which has been demonstrated by several reports. Li et al.29 prepared N-graphdiyne with a slight explosion and investigated it in the field of supercapacitors. The as-prepared samples can achieve high-performance up to 250 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Zhang et al.30 reported the modification of graphdiyne by N doping and found that the lithium-ion storage performance of N-graphdiyne (700 mA h g−1) was much better than that of graphdiyne (500 mA h g−1). However, the reported doping procedure often proceeds after the synthesis process, which makes the total synthesis process of N-graphynes relatively complicated. Moreover, the doping of the N heteroatom into fixed sites in the molecular skeleton of graphynes is often uncontrollable. Thus, it is still a challenge to develop facile fabrication strategies and achieve accurate doping at the fixed sites of graphynes.
Ball-milling synthesis is one of the high-energy mechanochemical approaches with cost-effective and reproducible properties for initiating structural changes and chemical reactions.31 The chemical bonds of precursors can be broken and the formation of new bonds occurs with strong mechanical stress. In 2017, Li et al. firstly reported the use of calcium carbide (CaC2) to synthesize acetylene-based carbon materials for energy storage.32 Subsequently, Cui et al. developed the mechanochemical preparation of γ-graphyne via the ball-milling of CaC2 with PhBr6 or benzene.33,34 It is worth mentioning that we recently demonstrated a sonochemical method for fabricating γ-graphyne, in which the sp2 carbon atoms of two adjacent benzene rings were bonded by single acetylenic (–CC–) linkages to form a hybrid network via ultrasonically vibrating CaC2 and PhBr6. The electrochemical properties of γ-graphyne in supercapacitors and the photoelectrochemical performance were investigated.35 Herein, we disclose a facile mechanochemical route to fabricating N-graphyne by the ball-milling promoted reaction of CaC2 and pyrazine in absolute ethanol. The molecular skeleton of pyrazine raw materials with fixed-position nitrogen was introduced into the product and is responsible for the accurate doping of nitrogen atoms at the controllable sites of γ-graphyne. A single acetylenic (–CC–) linkage was inserted between the sp2 carbon atoms of two adjacent pyrazine rings for the formation of N-graphyne with a hybrid network. The obtained N-graphyne was systematically characterized and its potential application as electrode material in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors was studied. This work simplifies the previous doping process and achieved site-controlled nitrogen doping by directly using the nitrogenous precursor reactant rather than the addition of other nitrogen sources. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the obtained N-graphyne in this work possesses a novel doping structure, which has not been reported before. This is the first report on the one-step in situ mechanochemical fabrication of N-graphyne for energy conversion and storage applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation
Calcium carbide (CaC2, LR, 75%), pyrazine (C4H4N2, RG, 99.0%), absolute ethanol (C2H5OH, GR, 99.7%), nitric acid (HNO3, AR, 68%), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, AR, ≥96%) were obtained from Tansoole and used without further pretreatment. Deionized water was used in all experiments.
The mechanochemical synthesis procedure is presented in Scheme 1. As shown, CaC2 and pyrazine were employed as the initial reactants, and ball-milling served as the high-energy driving force for the mechanochemical reaction. Firstly, CaC2 (4 g), pyrazine (2 g), absolute ethanol (50 mL), and 300 g stainless steel balls (a mixture of 2 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm with quantity ratio of 1:1:1:1) were mixed in a 100 mL stainless steel pot. Secondly, the ball-milling was carried out in an argon atmosphere at 600 rpm for 24 h (cooling down every 30 minutes, with 15-minute cooling intervals) on a planetary ball mill equipment (QXQM-2). Thirdly, the obtained suspension was successively centrifuged and washed with 1 mol L−1 nitric acid and deionized water for the removal of residual CaC2. Then, ultrasonic treatment of the obtained samples in absolute ethanol proceeded continuously for one hour. Finally, the centrifugal separation was carried out again and the obtained solid sample (N-graphyne) denoted as N-GY, was fully dried at 70 °C for 12 h. On average, 1 g of black products was obtained.

2.2 Characterization
A Panalytical X'Pert X-ray diffractometer (Holland) was used to record the X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. A JEOL JSM-7000F electron microscope (Japan) was used to conduct the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of samples. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were conducted on an FEI Tecnai F20 equipment (USA). A Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, UK) was applied to record Raman spectra using a 325 nm He–Cd laser. An RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (PerkinElmer) was utilized to conduct the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Al/Mg Kα radiation. The Fourier Transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were obtained on a NEXUS-470 (USA) instrument.
2.3 Activity
The electrochemical properties of the obtained samples in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors were tested in a three-electrode cell on a Shanghai Chenhua electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China).
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was tested in KOH aqueous electrolyte (1 mol L−1). Platinum wire and Hg/HgO (SCE) were employed as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared according to the following procedure: briefly, the nickel foam (NF) substrate was ultrasonically treated with acetone, 3 mol L−1 HCl, and purified water for 5 min, respectively. Three pieces of the pre-treated nickel foam (1 × 2 cm2) were dipped into the mixture of 20 mg N-graphyne, 2 mmol NH4F, and 1 mL H2O in a 5 mL beaker, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. Then, a total volume of 20 mL was obtained by the addition of some water. It was then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and the hydrothermal process was kept at 160 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature and drying at 80 °C, the working electrode N-graphyne/foam nickel was obtained. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots were measured at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained in a frequency range from 0.01 to 100000 Hz. The conversion of potential (V) vs. Hg/HgO and reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was performed in terms of the formula E (RHE) = E (Hg/HgO) + 0.098 + 0.0591 × pH.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) were conducted to evaluate the electrochemical properties of N-graphyne in supercapacitors. The working electrodes were fabricated by mixing 90% N-graphyne, 5% acetylene black, and 5% polytetrafluoroethylene via ultrasound treatment for 2 hours. Afterward, the obtained homogeneous slurry was brush-coated on nickel foam (1 × 2 cm) and dried at 80 °C for 12 h, followed by pressing under 10 MPa. The counter electrode, reference electrode, and electrolyte were platinum wire, Hg/HgO (SCE), and 6 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The specific capacitances (C) were calculated from the GCD curves using the equation: C = IΔt/mΔV, where ΔV, I, m, and Δt are the applied potential window (V), the discharge current (A), the mass of active materials (g), and the discharge time (s), respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis mechanism for N-graphyne
A plausible nucleophilic substitution mechanism for the preparation of N-graphyne by the ball milling of CaC2 and pyrazine is shown in Scheme 2. In the synthesis process, ball milling not only greatly enhances the full and intimate contact of reactants because of the smaller particle size and the strong mechanical function but also provides enough high energy to achieve the reaction of CaC2 and pyrazine. As depicted in Scheme 2, the alkyne groups (–CC–) with negative electricity arising from CaC2 can serve as nucleophiles. Due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen atoms than carbon atoms, the –CC– can attack the carbon atoms with positive charge rather than nitrogen atoms in the ring of pyrazine. Therefore, the H atoms on pyrazine are substituted by –CC– for the formation of the C–C bond. The substituting alkyne groups on the pyrazine ring can also be used as nucleophiles while the nucleophilic substitution can still occur on partially substituted pyrazine due to the electron attracting effect of the alkyne groups. Thus, the cross-coupling nucleophilic substitution can keep going on and finally form a two-dimensional N-graphyne with a planar network structure.

3.2 Characterization analysis

Fig. 1 compares the XRD patterns of N-graphyne, CaC2, and pyrazine as well as the PDF card of graphite (JCPDS no. 01-089-8487). As shown in the XRD results, the position of the diffraction peak for N-graphyne is different from that of CaC2 and pyrazine. In the XRD pattern of CaC2, the diffraction peaks located at 2θ values of 26.8°, 28°, 32.6°, 43.5°, 47°, 48.9°, and 54.9° are attributed to CaC2, whereas the remaining peaks correspond to a small amount of impurities including CaO and Ca(OH)2. All the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of pyrazine are ascribed to pyrazine (JCPDS no. 00-022-1904), indicating the high purity for the raw material pyrazine. Apparently, in the XRD pattern of N-graphyne, the characteristic diffraction peaks for the raw materials CaC2 and pyrazine, as well as the impurities CaO and Ca(OH)2 in CaC2, are invisible. There are only two diffraction peaks with strong intensity at around 26° and 44°, which are assigned to the (002) and (101) facets of graphite; i.e., the obtained N-graphyne exhibits a regular graphitized structure. In all, the XRD results indicate that the obtained N-graphyne exhibits a high degree of crystallinity and high purity.

Fig. 2 presents the FE-SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, and EDS elemental mapping for the analysis of the morphology and microstructure of N-graphyne. The lamellar structure of N-graphyne can be seen in the FE-SEM images (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the TEM image in Fig. 2b also shows the visible morphology of overlapped nanosheets, which further confirms the typical layered two-dimensional (2D) structure of the obtained N-graphyne. Moreover, the 2D structure of N-graphyne possesses wrinkled characteristics, which may be caused by the multiplicity of carbon chemical bonds within a single carbon layer or among several carbon layers. The two-dimensional structure and folded zone of N-graphyne endow its large surface areas, which can expose more active sites for potential applications in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. The HR-TEM image of N-graphyne is depicted in Fig. 2c. Clear lattice fringes are observed, suggesting the good crystallinity of the prepared N-graphyne, which is consistent with the high intensity of XRD diffraction peaks. Furthermore, by comparison with the XRD patterns of N-graphyne, the lattice spacing of 0.354 nm corresponds to the diffraction peak at a 2θ value of 26°, which seems larger than the spacing of graphene (0.335 nm),32 and the other lattice spacing of 0.205 nm corresponds to the diffraction peak at 44°. Fig. 2d shows the EDS elemental mapping of N-graphyne, which can confirm that N-graphyne contains C, N, and O elements. Moreover, it can be observed that the three elements show good distribution in the obtained sample, indicating the successful fabrication of N-graphyne.

Raman spectra are a sensitive tool for the characterization of carbon materials. As presented in the Raman spectrum of N-graphyne (Fig. 3a), seven characteristic peaks with different intensities are observed at 670, 1100, 1360, 1530, 1980, 2240, and 2700 cm−1, respectively. Generally, the band at 670 cm−1 is assigned to the sp-hybridized carbon bending vibration, which may be derived from the conjugated ethynyl linkages. The D band and G band are observed at 1360 cm−1 and 1530 cm−1, which correspond to the defect/disorder structure of carbon and the first-order Raman stretching for the in-phase stretching vibration of sp2-hybridized carbon, respectively. The G′ bands at 2700 cm−1 are attributed to the Raman scattering process of the double-resonance inter-valley.36 Two tiny peaks at 1980 and 2240 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of the sp2-hybridized carbon.37 In particular, compared to γ-graphyne, a strong peak at 1100 cm−1 in the Raman spectra was observed, which is attributed to a T model from C–N. Additionally, the peak intensity also represents the high content of the C–N bonds in the prepared N-graphyne.38

FT-IR spectra were also used to investigate the chemical bonds and functional groups in the prepared N-graphyne (Fig. 3b). There are five main peaks at around 600, 1180, 1380, 1600, and 1640 cm−1. The peak at 600 cm−1 is assigned to the bending vibration of ethynyl groups, whereas the peaks at 1180 and 1600 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of C–O and CO, respectively. They can be attributed to the oxidation of some of the products. Moreover, the two remaining strong peaks at 1380 and 1640 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of C–N and CN. The inset of Fig. 3b is the magnification of the FT-IR spectra from 2140 cm−1 to 2170 cm−1. Two weak peaks at 2147 and 2162 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of ethynyl links.39 According to the reports, there are no obvious signals of acetylenyl groups in the FT-IR spectra if they are symmetry substitutions in compounds.40 Therefore, the low intensity of the peaks for the stretching vibrations of ethynyl groups implies that the prepared N-graphyne possesses a well-symmetrical molecular structure.
XPS spectra of N-graphyne are shown in Fig. 3c–e, the calibration was made using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s for γ-graphyne was corrected by the Shirley background and fitted by the combination of Lorentzian and Gaussian functions. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the characteristic peaks for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) are clearly observed in the XPS survey spectrum, which is in accordance with EDS mapping. The presence of an O 1s peak at 532 eV is due to the absorption of air in the prepared N-graphyne.41 Moreover, the XPS results also indicate that the atomic percentage of N/C is 1/5 in the prepared N-graphyne. The C 1s and N 1s high-resolution XPS spectra for N-graphyne are displayed in Fig. 3d and e, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 3d, the XPS peak of C 1s can be fitted into four sub-peaks.42 The deconvoluted peaks centered at the binding energies of 284.5 and 285.1 eV are assigned to the C–C (sp2) and C–C (sp), respectively, while the peaks located at the binding energies of 286.5 and 288.7 eV are attributed to C–O/C–N and CO/CN linkages, respectively. The sub-peak width values are 0.8, 1.1, 1, and 1 for the deconvolution analysis of C 1s XPS, respectively. Notably, there is no C 1s peak for sp3-hybridized carbon; thus, we can deduce that there exists an sp- or sp2-hybridized style of carbon rather than the sp3-hybridized style in the obtained N-graphyne. The area ratio of sp2/sp was estimated to be about 1, indicating that the structure of the prepared N-graphyne is similar to that of the γ-graphyne structure, except for the substitution of some carbon atoms by nitrogen atoms. Additionally, the ratio value also implies a high degree of symmetry of the sp and sp2 hybrid carbon, which contributes to the high stability of the obtained N-graphyne. As displayed in Fig. 3e, the raw N 1s XPS peak located at a binding energy of 400 eV can be divided into pyridine-N (400 eV) and graphitized-N (401.5 eV) (the peak width values for the deconvolution analysis of N 1s XPS are 2 and 1.5, respectively). The XPS results demonstrate that the obtained N-graphyne contains different hybridized carbon (sp and sp2) and different types of nitrogen as well as oxygen atoms, which also present a highly symmetrical structure.
The XRD pattern for the starting material pyrazine in Fig. 1 demonstrates its high purity, and, the molecular structure of pyrazine is well known. Thus, we can deduce that the skeleton structure of pyrazine with fixed-position nitrogen may be introduced into the obtained product N-graphyne through a plausible nucleophilic substitution reaction between CaC2 and pyrazine. The sp2-hybridized carbon atoms of two adjacent pyrazine rings are connected by a “–CC–” linkage to form the hybrid network of N-graphyne. Further, combined with the Raman, XPS, and FT-IR spectral analyses, a probable spatial structure and valence bond for the prepared N-graphyne are schematically illustrated in Fig. 3f. According to the proposed structure of N-graphyne, the theoretical atomic percentage of N/C was calculated to be 1/3.54, which is higher than the experimental values obtained from XPS. As we know, carbon peaks often appear in the XPS spectra, even if there are actually no carbon elements in samples, which may originate from CO2 absorbed on the surface of the samples from the air when the samples are exposed to the air or the XPS instrument.43 Thus, the lower experimental values compared with the theoretical values in N-graphyne is plausible.
3.3 Electrocatalysis
The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of nickel foam (NF), graphene (GE), γ-graphyne (GY), and N-graphyne (N-GY) were studied in 1 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 4). Based on the polarization curves in Fig. 4a, it is noted that nickel foam exhibited very poor OER activity (410 mV at 100 mA cm−2). The peaks at around 1.4 V are due to the polarization of nickel foam, which leads to the oxidation peaks. Graphene displays an overpotential of 382 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. A smaller overpotential of 336 mV was achieved for γ-graphyne as compared to graphene at 100 mA cm−2. Impressively, N-graphyne requires the lowest overpotential of 285 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm−2, which indicates the best electrocatalytic OER activity. N-Graphyne also shows better OER activity as compared to other common electrocatalysts as summarized in Table S1.† The results indicate that N-graphyne is a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the conversion of H2O to O2 bubbles in the KOH electrolyte.
 Fig. 4  (a) LSV curves, (b) Tafel slopes, (c) the comparison of overpotentials and Tafel slopes of different samples, (d) plots of the double-layer capacitances, (e) Nyquist plots at the potential of 0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO), and (f) histogram of Rct values. NF, GE, GY, and N-GY represent foam nickel, graphene, γ-graphyne, and N-graphyne, respectively. 

Fig. 4b presents the Tafel linear fitting curves of foam nickel, graphene, γ-graphyne, and N-graphyne electrodes. According to Fig. 4b, the Tafel slopes for nickel foam, graphene, γ-graphyne, and N-graphyne electrodes are 310, 152, 130, and 122 mV dec−1, respectively. In general, a smaller Tafel slope indicates the lower resistance and better electrochemical performance of the sample. The combined graph of overpotentials and Tafel slopes can further show the electrochemical performance of different samples intuitively. Fig. 4c summarizes the overpotentials and Tafel slopes of graphene, γ-graphyne, and N-graphyne. It can be clearly seen that N-graphyne presents a smaller overpotential and Tafel slope than graphene and γ-graphyne. The values of overpotential and Tafel slope show the same regularity, indicating that N-graphyne possesses better OER performance.
To explore the reason for the superior OER activity of N-graphyne, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was investigated to evaluate the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. S1†) at various scanning rates without an obvious Faradaic process. Generally speaking, a higher ECSA indicates the exposure of more electroactive sites, which can result in improved catalytic activity.44 As revealed in Fig. 4d, N-graphyne exhibits the largest Cdl (71 mF cm−2), which is higher than that of γ-graphyne (68 mF cm−2) and graphene (45 mF cm−2). The increased electrochemically active surface areas of N-graphyne are due to the change in the electron cloud distribution arising from nitrogen doping, which increases the accessibility of the coordination unsaturated edge and corner sites and leads to the exposure of more active sites.45
The N-graphyne electrode kinetics in the process of the OER was further detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS Nyquist plots and the corresponding equivalent circuit model are illustrated in Fig. 4e. As shown, the semicircle radius of the Nyquist plot for N-graphyne at high-frequency became smaller as compared with that of γ-graphyne and graphene, indicating that the interfacial resistance between the electrode and electrolyte for charge transfer gets smaller. In the equivalent circuit model, Rct, Ri, and CPE are the interfacial charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte, the internal resistance, and the constant phase element, respectively. Table S3† lists the fitting results. The lower Rct value implies the higher electron transfer rate. Thus, the Rct reflects the electrocatalytic kinetics; i.e., a low Rct value often corresponds to a high rate of OER reaction.46 According to the fitting results, the Rct values of graphene, γ-graphyne, and N-graphyne electrodes are 1.208 Ω, 0.393 Ω, and 0.357 Ω, respectively (Fig. 4f), suggesting that the N-graphyne electrode possesses a lower interfacial charge transfer resistance than that of graphene and γ-graphyne. The EIS results can further illustrate the superior OER activity of N-graphyne.
The electrocatalytic stability of materials is also a very important parameter to evaluate their potential applicability. In order to explore the stability of N-graphyne, a chronopotentiometry curve of the N-graphyne electrode was recorded at the current density of 100 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 5a, the N-graphyne electrode presents an overpotential of 280 mV and a retention rate of nearly 100% for 60 h. The results indicate that N-graphyne shows good electrocatalytic stability as an oxygen evolution material. The comparison of LSV curves is presented in Fig. 5b. As shown, the overpotential values for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution are 280 mV and 303 mV before and after 60 h testing, respectively. It is obvious that the overpotential of N-graphyne changed by only 24 mV and the electrocatalytic retention rate was up to 92%. The FE-SEM images of the N-graphyne electrode before and after the electrocatalytic 60 h test are compared in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. It is worth noting that the 2D layer structure sample is dispersed over the nickel foam surface in the form of large sheets prior to the test, and after the 60 h test, the overall morphology of the sample did not change significantly. However, there was some stacking, which is attributed to the sample gathering under the function of a long time-directional current. Thus, after a 60 h electrocatalytic stability test, N-graphyne still presented excellent oxygen evolution performance.

Scheme 3 displays the water oxidation mechanism of N-graphyne. As is known, electrocatalysis is a four-electron catalytic process. H2O breaks down into OH− and H+ under the action of ionization with the release of an electron. Then, OH− ionizes to O* and H+, which releases an electron again. The third step is to combine the O* with H2O to become OOH* and the final step is that OOH* breaks down to release O2.47 The excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance of N-graphyne can be illustrated from the following two aspects. Firstly, N-graphyne is a two-dimensional material with a holey structure for a large electrochemically active surface area, which provides abundant active sites for the electrocatalysis. Meanwhile, due to the existence of a Dirac cone, it has ultra-high electron/hole mobility and quantum Hall effect, which play an important role in promoting electron transfer in the electrocatalytic process.48,49 The electrons generated during oxygen evolution are transferred out quickly to reduce the local electron cloud density. Thus, the electrons do not heavily gather, which speeds up the oxygen evolution reaction. Secondly, the electron cloud distribution of N-graphyne is different from γ-graphyne, which makes the N-graphyne structure possess more defects than γ-graphyne. In addition, there are many vacant N sites in the structure of N-graphyne. These defects and attachment sites play a key role in greatly improving the electrocatalytic performance of nitrogen-containing N-graphyne. The subsequent improvements of electrochemical performance in supercapacitors can be further supported by the above two aspects.

3.4 Supercapacitors
N-Doped carbon materials have been widely studied in the area of supercapacitors. However, to our knowledge, there have been few reports on the use of N-graphyne in supercapacitors. Therefore, CV and GCD measurements were performed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of N-graphyne as a supercapacitor electrode material (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a compares the CV curves of N-graphyne at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 mV s−1. Evidently, as the scan rate increases, a proportional increase in current density occurs. Moreover, no parent redox peaks and polarization were observed, manifesting that N-graphyne exhibits a superior rate capacity and possesses a distinct feature of double-layer capacitor.50,51
 Fig. 6  (a) CV curves at different scanning rates, (b) galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles at different current densities, (c) the specific capacitance values of N-graphyne at current densities ranging from 10 to 1 A g−1, (d) specific capacitance retention at a current density of 6 A g−1. 

Fig. 6b depicts the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of N-graphyne at various current densities. The almost linear shape for all the GCD curves is observed. The constant current charge/discharge curves showed a regular isosceles triangle shape with a large current or small current. The phenomenon indicates that N-graphyne shows high coulombic efficiency and good electrochemical reversibility. There was no apparent voltage drop, manifesting that the N-graphyne electrode has small internal resistance. Fig. 6c displays the plot of capacitance vs. current density calculated from GCD curves. With the current density decreasing from 10 A g−1 to 1 A g−1, the Cm values gradually became larger. The higher storage performance was obtained at a lower scan rate. At a small current density (1 A g−1), the Cm value for the N-graphyne electrode was 235 F g−1, which is much larger than that of γ-graphyne (50 F g−1). Even at a high current density (10 A g−1), N-graphyne can also exhibit unique capacitance performance (71 F g−1). The results indicate that N-doping plays an important role in the improvement of the supercapacitor's performance. As listed in Table S2,† the capacitance values of N-graphyne in this work are higher than that of other reported carbon materials such as N-doped graphene aerogel, N/P co-doped graphene, carbon nanosheets, alkynyl carbon materials, and graphdiyne materials. The comparisons show that N-graphyne has wide application prospects in supercapacitors.
The cycling measurements of N-graphyne as a supercapacitor electrode were successively tested at a current density of 6 A g−1 (Fig. 6d) for 3000 cycles. As displayed in Fig. 6d, the capacitance of the sample decreased slowly owing to many harsh redox reactions with the increase of the cycles. As a result, the N-graphyne electrode showed capacity retention of 87% after 3000 cycles, which suggests that N-graphyne has excellent cycling stability and good durability properties in supercapacitors. The large capacitance and excellent stability indicate that N-graphyne has potential as a supercapacitor electrode material. The excellent electrochemical properties of N-graphyne in supercapacitors can also be explained by the plausible reasons given for the OER described earlier. Firstly, the large conjugated system, abundant carbon chemical bonds (such as CC, CC, and CN), and large electrochemically active surface area boost the superior electrochemical performance. Secondly, the introduction of N atoms in the graphyne skeleton creates more heteroatomic defects and active sites, thus promoting the enhanced supercapacitor performance. Moreover, N heteroatoms in the N-graphyne molecules can reduce the surface side reactions, which contribute to the formation of stable interfaces, thus improving the cycling stability of N-graphyne in supercapacitors.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, N-graphyne was successfully prepared by the one-step ball milling of CaC2 and pyrazine in absolute ethanol. The structures and morphologies of the prepared samples were systematically characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, FT-IR FE-SEM, TEM, and EDS mapping measurements. The oxygen-evolution overpotential of N-graphyne was demonstrated to be only 285 mV at 100 mA cm−2, implying excellent electrocatalytic performance. The electrocatalytic stability was confirmed by the comparison of FE-SEM images and LSV curves of N-graphyne before and after chronopotentiometry testing for 60 h as well as an overpotential retention rate of nearly 100% for 60 h. Furthermore, N-graphyne exhibited a maximum capacitance of 235 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent capacitance retention of 87% after 3000 charge/discharge cycles at 6 A g−1. The promising electrocatalytic and supercapacitor behaviors of N-graphyne are due to the nitrogen heteroatomic defects, large electrochemical active surface areas and high electron mobility, as confirmed by Tafel and Nyquist curves. This research provides a facile mechanochemical route for the synthesis of novel N-graphyne with controllable doping sites and promotes its application in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.
