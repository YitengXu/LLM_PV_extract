    , Accepted 19th September 2017First published on 20th September 2017AbstractImproving the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) is essential to tap their potential as light-harvesting materials in QD sensitized solar cell (QDSC) applications. High quality composition controllable Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDs were synthesized, and the influence of non-stoichiometry on the optoelectronic properties, as well as on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting QDSCs, was investigated systematically. Experimental results revealed that the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs can remarkably influence the optical properties of QDs as well as the resultant photovoltaic performance of solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be distinctly improved with the use of Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs as a sensitizer regardless of the compromised light harvesting capability. Transient absorption (TA) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements demonstrated that the defect state-related donor–acceptor pair (DAP) in the ZCISe QDs was favorable for the enhancement of the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in the ZCISe QDSCs. The long-lived electrons in the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs benefit the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices by suppressing charge recombination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results illustrated that the charge recombination process at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces can be effectively inhibited in Cu-deficient ZCISe QD based cells. Finally, a highest PCE of 12.57% (Jsc = 25.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.752 V and FF = 0.644) was achieved employing ZCISe QDs with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7 under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination. This is one of the highest efficiencies in QDSCs.
1. Introduction
Faced with the increasingly concerning energy and environmental issues, exploring high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic cells is undoubtedly believed to be a promising choice.1 Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) with a theoretical thermodynamic power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 44% are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next generation solar cells.2–6 In recent years, the highest PCE of QDSCs has been improved rapidly to over 12%. On the one hand, the exploration of excellent QD sensitizers and the employment of ingenious electrode interface engineering greatly promote the astonishing evolution of QDSCs.7–11 On the other hand, the development of an efficient counter electrode is also crucial to improve the PCE of QDSCs.12–17 However, the obtained PCEs of QDSCs are still low compared to those of other emerging solar cells such as perovskite solar cells.18,19 Hence, it is still an urgent and challenging task to improve the PCE of QDSCs to a competitive new level. There is no doubt that exploring superior QD sensitizers is a requisite for the further development of QDSCs.
Recently, I–III–VI group QDs, such as CuInS2 (CIS) and CuInSe2 (CISe), have attracted great attention as sensitizers in QDSCs due to their prominent advantages, including a high absorption coefficient, a narrow bandgap and an appropriate band edge position.9,10,20–31 What’s more, their low-toxic nature without Cd or Pb heavy metal elements renders them more attractive as light harvesting materials. Particularly, CISe QDs have gained more and more attention in QDSCs due to their narrower band gap compared to CIS (1.05 vs. 1.52 eV). This is favorable for extending the light absorption edge to the near-infrared (NIR) region and further improving the short-circuit current (Jsc) value.26–31 Klimov et al. developed a CuInSe1−xSx alloyed QD sensitizer and achieved a PCE of 5.5%.26,27 Hyeon et al. optimized the thickness of the ZnS passivation layer in CISe QDSCs and obtained a record PCE of 8.1% with the Jsc as high as 26.93 mA cm−2.31 Notably, Zhong’s group developed an alloyed Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QD sensitizer with a wide absorption range and a high conduction band edge, and boosted the PCE of the QDSCs beyond 11%.10 Therefore, it is believed that the ZCISe QDs possess great potential to promote the development of QDSCs further. Nevertheless, the quality of the ZCISe QDs used in the QDSCs was not satisfactory due to the limitation of the adopted dodecanethiol-free synthetic method, resulting in severe charge recombination loss in the resulting devices.10,28 Therefore, improving the quality of ZCISe QDs is essential to tap their potential as a light-harvesting material in QDSCs.
Until now, with the aim to obtain high quality I–III–VI QDs, considerable efforts have been devoted to investigate their synthesis approaches and photoluminescence (PL) properties.32–49 Extensive reports by several groups have shown that the radiative recombination in I–III–VI QDs is mainly derived from defect states and the composition control is crucial in the preparation of high quality I–III–VI QDs.39–45 It is generally accepted that the copper deficiency in I–III–VI QDs is beneficial for the improvement of the PL properties. For example, Chuang et al. synthesized CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs with varying Cu/In molar ratios and found that the QDs displayed the highest emission efficiency with a Cu/In molar ratio of 1/2.46 Kim et al. demonstrated that the internal defect-related emission process was highly promoted by the large Cu deficiency, which can be ascribed to the formation of a defect-ordered structure by the large Cu deficiency in CIS QDs.48 Zhong et al. pointed out that the non-stoichiometry in CIS QDs resulted in the variation of the density of donor–acceptor pair (DAP) defect states, thus influencing the PL properties of CIS QDs.45 It has been demonstrated that the relatively long PL lifetime of non-stoichiometric I–III–VI QDs was mainly derived from the long transition time of charge carriers in the DAP states.47 It is worth noting that the feature of the long transition time of the charge carrier in the DAP favors the improvement of the electron lifetime in QDSCs, thus reducing the risk of electron recombination through other pathways.50–52 Regretfully, this unique property of non-stoichiometry generated DAPs in I–III–VI QDs has not been exploited for improving the performance of the resultant QDSCs.
Herein, based on recently reported high efficiency ZCISe QDSCs, we systematically investigate the effect of Cu-deficient non-stoichiometry in ZCISe QDs on the solar cell performance. The results indicated that the Cu/In molar ratio in the ZCISe QDs can significantly influence the optical properties of the QDs as well as the resultant solar cell performance. It is found that the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs benefit the improvement of the solar cell performance. A defect state-related DAP induced electron lifetime prolonging mechanism is proposed in view of the long transition time nature of the DAP states in the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs. Experimental results reveal that the DAP in the ZCISe QDs is favorable for the enhancement of the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in QDSCs, and the charge recombination process at the photoanode/electrolyte interface is inhibited effectively. The ZCISe QD based QDSCs, with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7, gave the best solar cell performance and an impressive PCE of 12.57% (Jsc = 25.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.752 V and FF = 0.644) was achieved under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination.
2. Experimental section
Chemicals
Copper iodide (CuI, 99.998%), indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 99.99%), and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 97%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), oleylamine (OAm, 95%), and 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%) were obtained from Aldrich. Zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2, 99.99%) and diphenylphosphine (DPP, 98%) were received from J&K. All chemicals were used as received without further treatment.
Fabrication of the solar cell devices
The synthesis of the ZCISe QDs as well as the ligand exchange process to obtain the water-soluble MPA-capped QDs are referred to in previous literature.10 TiO2 mesoporous films with a thickness of 25 ± 1.5 μm (20 μm transparent layer and 5 μm light scattering layer) were prepared through the screen printing method. For the QD deposition, MPA-capped water-soluble ZCISe QDs were pipetted onto the TiO2 film for 4 h. Then, six cycles of the ZnS passivation layers were performed by alternately immersing the QD-sensitized photoanodes into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min per dip. The Cu2S/brass counter electrodes were prepared by immersing brass in HCl solution at 90 °C for 30 min. The method to prepare the MC/Ti counter electrode is referred to in a previous report.17
Measurements and characterizations
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument working at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an Ultima IV instrument. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was recorded on an Agilent 725 ES instrument. The absorption spectra of an oil-soluble QD solution as well as QD sensitized TiO2 films were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Before each test, an NREL standard Si solar cell was used to calibrate the power of the simulated solar light to 100 mW cm−2. The photoactive area is 0.237 cm2 defined by a black metal mask. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter with illumination from a 300 W tungsten lamp and a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. The samples for the OCVD measurements were illuminated by a white light-emitting diode (LED) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the decay of the photovoltage with time was recorded after switching off the light source. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab250Xi machine. The measurement was carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (10−8 mbar) with a high energy discharge lamp (He(I), 21.22 eV). The femtosecond-resolution transient absorption (TA) measurement was carried out under a N2 atmosphere to characterize the samples deposited on the TiO2 and SiO2 substrate. In the measurement, a titanium/sapphire laser (CPA-2010, Clark-MXR Inc.) with a wavelength of 775 nm, pulse width of 150 fs and repetition rate of 1000 Hz was applied as the laser source. The light was divided into two parts: one part was used as the probe pulse, and the other was used as the pump light to produce tunable wavelengths of light pulses. In this study, the pump light with a wavelength of 490 nm was used.
3. Results and discussion
Optical properties of the ZCISe QDs
In this work, the ZCISe QDs were synthesized via a hot injection method with the use of DPP-Se as the Se source.10 It is well-known that I–III–VI group semiconductors can tolerate a wide range of non-stoichiometric compositions compared to II–VI group binary semiconductors.45 To achieve composition control in the ZCISe QDs, we varied the amounts of the CuI precursor and fixed the amount of In(OAc)3 and other components to tune the Cu/In molar ratio from 0.5 to 1.0 in the synthesis process. To confirm the final composition of the obtained ZCISe QDs, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurement was carried out and the actual Cu/In molar ratios in the obtained QD samples are shown in Table S1.† It can be found that the measured Cu/In molar ratios (0.55, 0.68 and 0.92) are extremely close to the nominal Cu/In molar ratios (0.5, 0.7 and 1.0). Therefore, the nominal Cu/In molar ratio instead of the actual Cu/In molar ratio is used in the following discussions. Firstly, the effect of non-stoichiometry on the optical properties of the resulting ZCISe QDs was studied. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the ZCISe QDs with different Cu/In molar ratios are shown in Fig. 1a. We can see that with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio from 1.0 to 0.5, the absorption onset of the obtained QDs exhibited a systematical blue-shift from 1050 nm (Cu/In = 1.0) to 900 nm (Cu/In = 0.5), indicating that decreasing the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs leads to the increase of the band gap. The observed results are consistent with previous reports.45–48 Moreover, the absorbance of the ZCISe QDs was also lowered with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio, implying that the extinction coefficient was decreased for the Cu-deficient QDs. The PL spectra of the ZCISe QDs with different Cu/In molar ratios are shown in Fig. 1b. Similarly, the PL peak position also displayed a slight blue-shift with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio. Meanwhile, the PL intensity was increased with the decreased Cu/In molar ratio from 1.0 to 0.7, and then reduced with the further decrease of the Cu content. This phenomenon is in good agreement with previous results.45–47 It has been proven that the enhancement of the PL intensity was derived from the defect state-related DAPs in non-stoichiometric Cu-deficient QDs, whereas too high a density of the DAPs will cause the quenching of the PL.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis (a) and PL (b) spectra of the ZCISe QDs synthesized with different Cu/In molar ratios from 0.5 to 1.0. 
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterization was used to reveal the effect of the Cu/In molar ratio in the ZCISe QDs on the location of the band edge position.53,54 The UPS curves and the obtained energy level diagram of the ZCISe QDs with Cu/In molar ratios of 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 along with TiO2 are illustrated in Fig. S1.† The results indicated that the valance band (VB) edge of the ZCISe QDs was lowered with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio. It has been demonstrated that for the copper chalcogenide QDs such as ZCISe, the conduction band (CB) minimum was composed of hybrid orbitals of In 5s5p and Zn 4s4p, while the VB maximum was made up of hybrid orbitals of Cu 3d and Se 4p. Therefore, the band-gap variation depending on the Cu content was reasonably understood since the maximum level of the VB was lowered with a decrease in the number of orbitals originating from the Cu content.55,56 The CB edge was calculated by adding the optical bandgap to the energy of the valance band edge. It was found that the CB edge was also lowered with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio.
Structural characterization
The TEM images of the ZCISe QDs synthesized with Cu/In molar ratios of 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that all of the samples are very mono-dispersed without any aggregates and the average particle size is 4.5 ± 0.3 nm. Moreover, the Cu/In molar ratios did not show an obvious effect on the final particle size of the obtained ZCISe QDs. Fig. 2d shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the corresponding ZCISe QDs. As we can see, the samples exhibited the characteristic diffraction patterns of chalcopyrite CISe (JCPDS: 40-1487). Similarly, the XRD patterns of the ZCISe QDs are almost the same with the change of the Cu/In molar ratio from 0.5 to 1.0, indicating that a tiny alteration of the chemical composition will not change the crystal structure of the ZCISe QDs.

Photovoltaic performance
The solar cell devices were constructed by assembling the sensitized photoanodes and the counter electrode (Cu2S/brass or MC/Ti) filled with polysulfide electrolyte (consisting of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the QDSCs based on the ZCISe QDs with different Cu/In molar ratios under AM 1.5 G full one sun illumination are shown in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Herein, Cu2S/brass was used as the counter electrode due to its facile preparation and good reproducibility. As shown in the results, with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio from 1.0 to 0.7, the average PCE was significantly improved from 8.44% to 9.28%. However, a further decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio was accompanied with the deterioration of the solar cell performance. It is found that the evolution of the PCEs was mainly derived from the variation of the Jsc values. The cells based on the ZCISe QDs with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7 demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 9.28% and a highest PCE of 9.39%. The J–V results indicated that the Cu-deficient non-stoichiometric ZCISe QDs are superior for the improvement of the solar cell performance.

Furthermore, we fabricated cell devices using the optimal ZCISe QD sensitizer with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7 based on the recently reported highly efficient Ti mesh supported mesoporous carbon (MC/Ti) counter electrode. The average and highest photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1 and the J–V curves of the individual cell and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S3.† Finally, an average PCE of 12.41% and a highest PCE of 12.57% (Jsc = 25.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.752 V and FF = 0.644) were achieved. These obtained performances are among the best results for QDSCs.
To gain insight into the effect of the composition of the ZCISe QDs on the solar cell performance, the light harvesting capacity of the photoanode with the use of different QD sensitizers was firstly evaluated. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of the ZCISe QD sensitized TiO2 films (6.0 μm transparent layer with an area of 1.6 cm2). It can be found that the absorbance of the films decreased steadily with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio from 1.0 to 0.5. Given that the thickness of the TiO2 films as well as the other factors were identical, it is clear that the extinction coefficient of the ZCISe QDs was decreased with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio. This result is consistent with the results of the absorption spectra of the QDs in solution. In addition, as mentioned above, the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio in the QDs resulted in the blue-shift of the absorption onset. Thus, it can be concluded that the light harvesting capacity of the sensitized films was lowered with the decrease of the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs. Besides, it has been demonstrated that the CB edge was lowered with the decrease of the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs, indicating a slower electron injection efficiency. However, it is surprising that the average Jsc values were improved (from 24.78 to 25.92 mA cm−2) with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratios from 1.0 to 0.7. To further investigate the effect of the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs on the performance of the QDSCs, the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the cells was measured. As shown in Fig. 3c, the variation trend of the IPCE is consistent with that of the Jsc value obtained from the J–V test. It is well known that the IPCE value is determined by three parameters: IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ηcc (LHE, the light harvesting efficiency; ϕinj, the electron injection efficiency; and ηcc, the charge collection efficiency). It is obvious that the enhancement of the IPCE can be attributed to the increase of the ηcc since both the LHE and the ϕinj were reduced with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio. In addition, the APCE (absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) was also calculated according to the following equation:57APCE(λ) = IPCE(λ)/[1 − 10−abs(λ)]
As shown in Fig. 3d, the APCE values of the Cu-deficient ZCISe QD based solar cells were much higher than that of the stoichiometric ZCISe based one. These results indicated that the Cu-deficient non-stoichiometric ZCISe QDs favor the improvement of the charge collection efficiency in the resultant solar cell devices.
Defect induced electron lifetime prolonging mechanism
Herein, a defect-related DAP induced electron lifetime prolonging mechanism was proposed for the Cu-deficient non-stoichiometric ZCISe based QDSCs and this is responsible for the improvement of the charge collection efficiency. Previous studies have shown that the Cu-deficient I–III–VI QDs presented an attractive long PL lifetime, arising from the defect-related DAPs formed in the QDs.42–48 The sulfur vacancy (VS), the interstitial copper (Cui), and the copper site substituted by indium (InCu) act as donors, while the copper vacancy (VCu), the indium vacancy (VIn) and the indium site substituted by copper (CuIn) act as acceptors. It has been demonstrated that the charge carrier transition between the DAPs is rather slow compared to those of the surface or band edge related recombination processes. This is the main reason for the observed remarkably long PL lifetime. Consequently, this distinct property has great potential to be used in QDSCs to prolong the excited electron lifetime. As shown in Fig. 4, following excitation by solar light, the electron is excited to the conduction band of the ZCISe QDs. Then, electrons in the conduction band can transfer to the donor states through relaxation. The long lifetime of the DAP transition enables electrons to stay for a longer time at the donor states and then to be injected into the TiO2. It can be considered that this outstanding property of the DAP states performs an electron “holding” function in the QDSCs. Thus, the electron lifetimes of the photogenerated electrons are prolonged, and so the probability of charge recombination through the surface defect states or with the oxidation species in the electrolyte is reduced. This DAP induced electron lifetime prolonging mechanism is similar to that of the Mn doped QD based QDSCs which was reported firstly by Kamat’s group.50 In this work, the decrease of the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs increased the density of defect-related DAPs, thus improving the electron lifetime and the overall solar cell performance. On the other hand, the density of the DAPs should be precisely controlled since an extensive density of DAPs will quench the PL due to the interaction between the DAPs, as discussed above. To confirm this hypothesis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient absorption and open-circuit voltage-decay measurements were carried out to gain insight into the charge transfer dynamics.

Transient absorption analysis
The femtosecond (fs)-resolution transient absorption (TA) measurement was used to evaluate the dynamics of charge recombination within the QDs and transfer from the QDs to the TiO2.58,59 The ZCISe QDs with Cu/In molar ratios of 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 were deposited on both SiO2 and TiO2 substrates and measured under a N2 atmosphere. Fig. 5 displays the recovery of bleaching on the insulating SiO2 as well as the TiO2 substrates. The fitted TA results are listed in Table 2 according to the biexponential function of eqn (1), and the average bleaching recovery lifetime (τav) is calculated based on eqn (2), Y = A1e1t/τ + A2e2t/τ(1) (2)where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes and A1 and A2 are the contributions of the two components, respectively. For the samples on the SiO2 substrate, the TA decay is dominated by the charge carrier recombination within the QDs, so we can obtain the intrinsic recombination characteristics of the QDs. According to previous reports, the shorter lifetime, τ1, may be assigned to band edge or surface related recombination processes, while the longer lifetime, τ2, is attributed to the DAP transition. It was found that the bleaching recovery lifetime of the QDs on SiO2 increased from 7.99 to 11.96 ps with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio from 1.0 to 0.7. The enhancement of the bleaching recovery lifetime is mainly derived from the improvement of the τ2. It means that the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs generated a longer lifetime of carrier recombination in the QDs due to the increase of the DAP density. This result is in good agreement with previous reports and the PL result in Fig. 1b. While in the case of the Cu/In molar ratio of 0.5, the bleaching recovery lifetime was shortened to 9.90 ps, probably due to the interaction between the DAPs under the condition of high DAP density. This result strongly supported that the DAPs in the QDs were beneficial for the improvement of the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers.

The decay rates were much faster for the samples deposited on the TiO2 substrate due to the existence of a charge transfer process from the QDs to the TiO2, resulting in a much shorter τav. The electron injection rate (ket) can be calculated from eqn (3), ket = 1/τav(QDs/TiO2) − 1/τav(QDs/SiO2)(3)where τav(QDs/TiO2) and τav(QDs/SiO2) represent the τav of the QDs deposited on the TiO2 and SiO2 substrates, respectively. It can be found that the ket was slightly lowered with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio. The decreased ket can be attributed to the downshift of the CB edge as shown in the UPS results. In addition, the defect-related donor states are located below the CB edge. This may also be responsible for the decreased ket.
Open-circuit voltage-decay measurement
Open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) measurement is commonly used to obtain the electron lifetime of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and QDSCs. At first, the cell is illuminated for a while under open-circuit conditions to get to a steady Voc, and then the output Voc is measured as a function of time when the light is turned off. The decay rate is relevant to the electron lifetime of the cell since the variation of the Voc after turning off the light is determined by the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons.60–63 Herein, the constructed cells were illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 for 10 seconds to get to a steady Voc, and then the Voc values were recorded after turning the light off. The decay curves of the different cells are shown in Fig. 6a. Obviously, the Cu-deficient non-stoichiometric ZCISe QD based solar cells displayed a much slower Voc decay rate. The corresponding electron lifetime (τn) can be calculated by the following equation:  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T represents the absolute temperature (298.15 K), and e is the elementary charge.60–63 As shown in Fig. 6b, the τn is longer over the whole range of the voltage conditions with the use of the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs as the sensitizers. This result indicated that, for the cells based on the non-stoichiometric ZCISe QDs, the excited electron can survive for a longer time without being captured through other pathways. This further supports the hypothesis that DAPs in the QDs provide an effective route to prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons, thus favoring the improvement of the solar cell performance.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
The above obtained TA and OCVD results demonstrated that the photogenerated electron lifetime was prolonged notably in the Cu-deficient ZCISe QD based QDSCs. Accordingly, the prolonged electron lifetime is believed to be beneficial for the inhibition of the charge recombination process, especially for the recombination process from the QDs to the electrolyte due to the electron “holding” function of the DAP states. To confirm this anticipation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out on cells based on the ZCISe QDs with different Cu/In molar ratios. The obtained EIS results were analyzed by standard fitting models and the equivalent circuits (shown in the inset of Fig. 7b) according to the previous literature.63,64 The detailed Nyquist curves under different bias are shown in Fig. S3† and the extracted chemical capacitance (Cμ) and charge recombination resistance (Rrec) are illustrated in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a, the similar Cμ values observed in all of the samples implied that the conduction band edge position of the TiO2 was not changed for the different ZCISe QD based systems. However, it was found that the Rrec values were distinctly different with the change of the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs, as shown in Fig. 7b. The Rrec values were increased significantly in the Cu-deficient ZCISe QD based cell devices. This indicated that the charge recombination rate at the photoanode/electrolyte interface was much slower with the use of Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs as the sensitizer. In order to give a direct comparison of the Rrec value, Fig. 7d presents the Nyquist plots for the cells at a forward bias of −0.6 V, which is close to the Voc of the cell devices. The extracted EIS parameters are listed in Table S4.† It was found that the Rrec value was increased by 30% with the decrease of the Cu/In molar ratio from 1.0 to 0.7. In addition, the calculated electron lifetime (τn = Rrec × Cμ) of the cell devices was also improved from 1434 to 1812 ms. Moreover, the degree of the charge recombination can also be reflected by the dark current test. As shown in Fig. 7c, the dark current of the cells using the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.5 and 0.7 was smaller than that of the reference cell, implying that the charge recombination loss in the cell device was reduced. The EIS results demonstrated that the prolonged electron lifetime in the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs is favorable for the inhibition of the charge recombination process at the crucial photoanode/electrolyte interface. It can be reasonably deduced that this charge recombination inhibition effect is mainly derived from the charge protection function of the DAP states in the ZCISe QDs, avoiding the excited electrons from being captured by the oxidation species in the electrolyte.

4. Conclusions
In summary, high-quality composition-controlled ZCISe alloyed QDs were synthesized through the precise control of the Cu/In molar ratio in the QDs. The non-stoichiometry of the ZCISe QDs presented remarkable effects on the photoelectronic properties of the QDs as well as the photovoltaic performance of the constructed QDSCs. It was found that the Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs were favorable for the improvement of the solar cell performance. The enhanced PCE can be principally attributed to the formed DAP defect states in the ZCISe QDs due to the Cu deficiency. Experimental results demonstrated that the DAP defect states favored the enhancement of the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons in the ZCISe QD based QDSCs and suppressed the charge recombination process as well. An impressive highest PCE of 12.57% was achieved employing ZCISe QDs with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7. This work paves a new way to prepare high quality I–III–VI group QD sensitizers and further promotes the development of QDSCs.
