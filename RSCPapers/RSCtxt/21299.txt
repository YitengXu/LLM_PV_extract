    , Accepted 6th April 2011First published on 3rd June 2011AbstractBattery technology plays critical role under clean energy systems because it contributes for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Breakthroughs in cathodes, anodes, and electrolyte materials are needed to reach high power and energy density in lithium ion batteries. The electrochemical performance (cycling stability, power density, and reversibility) depends on the morphological and compositional characteristics of the electrode materials, which could be controlled during the synthesis and also the annealing process. Enormous leverage can result from the advances in nanostructured electrode materials. Nano sized electrodes exhibit minimal impedance growth, which means no substantial loss of power with cycling, also increase the electrode/electrolyte contact area, which in turn increase the charge/discharge rate to achieve maximum power. This report reviews novel nanostructured cathode materials and their influence on the electrochemical performance of lithium ion batteries.Ragupathy PitchaiP.

Introduction
With the increasing world population and substantial increase in living standards, there has been increase in demand for both conventional and non-conventional energy sources. Faster depletion of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns impose the greatest scientific and technological challenges in this century. Challenges and barriers in developing alternative and sustainable clean energy technologies have to be addressed properly. Some of the alternatives are solar, wind, hydrothermal, geothermal, nuclear, and biomass. Though nuclear reactors provide a constant energy source, the disposal of radioactive waste remains an unsolved issue. Geothermal energy is restricted in terms of location. Solar radiation, wind and waves represent energy sources that are seasonable in their availability. These sources require energy storage for the long run. In this regard, electrochemical energy systems are other promising alternatives as they offer several advantages like direct energy conversion without an intermediate step, high efficiency, absence of moving parts and hence minimum noise levels, minimum pollution, portability, miniaturization, convenience to scale up and so on.1–3
The development of electrochemical energy systems has come a long way, because of the various efforts made by scientists and technocrats in understanding the fundamental properties of such systems. However, the commercialization of electrochemical energy technologies is hampered by higher cost, durability, and problems associated with operations in automobile applications such as electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Although Li-ion batteries have revolutionized portable electronic devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, laptops etc., with a high energy density, their power density is generally low due to the high concentration polarization of Li+ within the electrode material. This eventually results in termination of the discharge process before the maximum capacity of the electrode material is used.4 In this regard, the nanostructured materials have received enormous interests in recent years because of the unusual mechanical and electrical properties endowed by confining the dimension and combination of bulk and surface properties to overall behavior.5–7 Nanostructured materials can offer versatile strategies towards improving the electrochemical properties. High rate capabilities are expected due to the fact that the distance over which Li+ must diffuse in the solid state dramatically decreases in the nanostructured electrode. In this review, we focus on nanostructured cathode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries.
Principle of Li-ion cells
A Li-ion cell consists of both an anode and cathode comprising intercalation materials with layered structures which involve topotatic insertion/extraction of Li-ions. In commercial Li-ion batteries, lithiated graphite is used as a negative electrode and lithium transition metal oxides such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4 are employed as positive electrodes. These two electrodes are separated by a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising a lithium salt such as LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) or dimethylene carbonate (DMC) or a mixture of them. Charging the cell involves the migration of Li-ions from the LiCoO2 cathode through the electrolyte towards the anode and intercalating in graphite. Discharge reverses the process moving the Li-ions out of the graphite and reforming LiCoO2. Equivalent number of electrons passes through the external circuit for charge compensation. This Li-ion cell is also referred to as a rocking-chair, swing or shuttle-cock cell, because the Li+ shuttles between the cathode and anode during the charge–discharge process.
The half cell reactions at the two electrodes during the charge–discharge cycles of a Li-ion cell are shown below.

The operating principle of a Li-ion cell is described schematically in Fig. 1.

Nanostructured materials are appealing in particular to increase the energy density and rate capability due to the following advantages:
i. they offer new reactions which cannot take place in micrometer size particles (for example, the reaction of transition metal compounds with Li leads to the in situ formation of metal nanoparticles (M) embedded in a Li2X matrix, MX + zLi+ + ze− ↔ LizX + M, where X = O, S, F or N);
ii. nanostructured materials provide short path lengths for both Li+ ion diffusion and electron transport in comparison with micron-sized particles and therefore can enhance the charge/discharge rate;
iii. a short path length for electronic transport can allow for utilizing materials having low electronic conductivity;
iv. an increased electrode/electrolyte contact area can also lead to enhanced charge/discharge rates;
v. nanomaterials can accommodate large volume expansion/contraction associated with Li+ transport and preserve the integrity of the electrode leading to longer cycle-life.
Layered oxides
Among the early-developed transition metal oxides, V2O5 was the first layered oxide reported by Whittingham8 for electrochemical Li intercalation in late seventies. V2O5 has a layered structure consisting of V2O5 layers along the c-axis of the orthorhombic cell. Each layer is built up of VO5 square pyramids sharing edges and corners with four V–O distances being close to 2 Å and the apical one being about 1.5 Å. The structure of V2O5 is shown in Fig. 2.

Later, it was realized that depending on the amount of lithium intercalated into V2O5, several phases exist. The α- and ε-phases are obtained for x < 0.01 and 0.35 < x < 0.7 in LixV2O5 respectively, increasing the puckering of the layers.9 With x = 1 in LixV2O5 the corresponding δ-phase has been observed by the gliding of one layer in every two. For x ≤ 1 the phase transitions were fully reversible maintaining original V2O5 layered structure. The γ-phase formed with intercalation of 1 < x < 2 Li per V2O5. Upon further addition of about 3 mole of Li, a highly irreversible ω-Li3V2O5 stabilizes in the rock salt structure. The electrochemical lithium intercalation and deintercalation can be expressed by  
With the advent of nanoscience, it was observed that nanostructured vanadium oxides play an important role in improving the electrochemical performance of rechargeable Li-ion batteries. 1-D nanostructure in particular received enormous interest in this regard. For instance, Liet al.10 have synthesized V2O5 nanobelts on a large scale by hydrothermal treatment using H2O2 aqueous solution. A dehydration–recrystallization–cleavage mechanism has been proposed for the formation of nanobelts. Hydrothermally obtained V2O5 is composed of a belt like structure with lengths of up to 10 μm as shown in Fig. 3. The rectangular cross-section of the belt is clearly seen (inset Fig. 3). The width and thickness are in the range of 100–300 nm and 30–40 nm, respectively.

The authors have compared the electrochemical performance of V2O5 nanobelts with commercially available V2O5 to emphasize the importance of nanostructured V2O5 (Fig. 4). The initial discharge capacity (288 mAh g−1) of V2O5 nanobelts is about 55% higher than that of V2O5 powders (132 mAh g−1). The enhancement in capacity is attributed to the larger surface area.

Nanostrips of V2O5 have been synthesized by our team using the polyol method involving vanadyl ethylene glycolate as the precursor.11Polyol is not only used as the reducing agent but also as the structure directing agent. It coordinates to the central metal ion to form a metal glycolate further leading to subsequent oligomerization.12,13 The evolution of the nanostrip is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5. The SEM images show that the individual strips have the following dimensions: length, 1.3 μm; width, 332 nm; thickness, 45 nm (inset Fig. 6a). The obtained V2O5 nanostrips exhibited the high specific capacity of about 427 mAh g−1. However, the cyclablity was found to be poor due to inherent phase transformation of V2O5. Our team intended to see the morphological changes upon cycling. The SEM image of the V2O5 nanostrip composite electrode after the first cycle is seen retaining the nanostrip morphology (Fig. 6a). It is evident from the SEM image (Fig. 6b) that the initial morphology of the electrode has been destroyed after the 20th cycle. Presumably, this is also one of the reasons for poor capacity retention in addition to the crystallographic phase transformation of V2O5. The diffusion coefficient (D) of the V2O5 nanostrips was found to be 1.37 × 10−11 cm2s−1 using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). A wide range of D values for Li+ diffusion in V2O5 were reported in the literature between 5 × 10−8 and 1 × 10−13 cm2s−1.14,15 The D value obtained for Li+ diffusion in the nanostrip indicates that the nanodimensions of the electrode active materials may not change the diffusion coefficient value, but the distance available for Li+ diffusion is decreased.

It is well reported that Li-ion batteries exhibit poor low temperature performance.16–18Nanostructure-based electrode active materials in Li-ion batteries could extenuate this low-temperature performance challenge. In this regard, Sides and Martin19 have used a template synthesis method to prepare various diameters of V2O5 rods: 70 nm, 0.8 μm and 0.45 μm (Fig. 7). They have proved that nanorods (diameter 70 nm) of V2O5 exhibit higher specific discharge capacities at low temperature than V2O5 rods with micrometer sized diameters. The electrochemical performance of these materials has been investigated at three different temperatures (25, 0, and −20 °C). The better performance of nanorod arrays (diameter 70 nm) at low temperature is attributed to its nanoscale, the short distance for Li+ diffusion, and the temperature dependence of the solid state diffusion coefficient of the materials.

Chan et al.20 have studied the reaction kinetics of V2O5 nanoribbons in the Li+ diffusion process. The authors have calculated the time required for Li+ to diffuse completely into a 740 nm wide nanoribbon was 1.5 h, which is 3 times longer than is observed in thin nanoribbons. It is believed that the transformation requires a crystal lattice distortion in all three dimensions to accommodate the ions, which can induce strain energy. It is found that the activation barrier for this distortion is relatively small in the case of nanoribbons compared to their bulk counter parts. The minimum activation energy makes the system to relax the strain which promotes faster transformation leading to faster Li-ion diffusion. Wang et al.21 have prepared nanotubes arrays of V2O5.nH2O by template-based electrodeposition. The nanotube morphology can be easily controlled by simply manipulating the applied voltage and deposition time. The V2O5.nH2O nanotube arrays exhibits an initial capacity of about 300 mAh g−1, which is almost twice the capacity observed from the V2O5.nH2O film. The enhanced capacity is mainly attributed to the large surface area and shorter diffusion distances offered by the nanotube array. Subsequently, Ban et al.22 have prepared nanocrystalline V2O5 by hydrothermal treatment of electrospun composite fibers. The initial discharge capacity was found to be 360 mAh g−1 which is remarkably high compared to the bulk. Very interestingly, this electrospun V2O5 retains about 67% of its initial capacity after 25 cycles in spite of its inherent phase transformation. This systematic investigation leads to the fabrication of batteries with not only higher power density and also longer cycle life for EVs applications.

        LiCoO2 has served as an archetype electroactive cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries ever since its discovery by Goodenough's group in 1980.23 Despite the high cost and toxicity of the cobalt, LiCoO2 has been used in many commercially available Li-ion batteries. LiCoO2 is easily synthesized via a solid state reaction in the temperature range between 850 and 1000 °C over several hours. LiCoO2 is isostructural with α-NaFeO224 having a rhombohedral structure in which Li+ and Co3+ occupy alternative layers of edge sharing octahedral sites in a close-packed oxygen array (Li in 3b, Co in 3a and O in 6a sites) with R-3m space group.25 This structural arrangement provides two dimensional diffusion paths for lithium ions in the LiCoO2 framework as shown in Fig. 8.

High lithium chemical potential μLi(c) associated with the highly oxidized Co3+/4+ couple provides a high cell voltage of about 4 V. The direct Co–Co interaction with a partially filled t2g6−x band associated with Co3+/4+ couple leads to higher electronic conductivity for Li1-xCoO2. Additionally low spin Co3+ (t2g6 eg0) and Co4+ (t2g5 eg0) ions for the octahedral sites provides good structural stability for Li1-xCoO2 without encountering a migration of Co3+/4+ ions from the octahedral sites of the Co plane to the octahedral sites of the lithium plane via the neighboring tetrahedral sites. These properties make LiCoO2 an attractive cathode material.
The complete removal of Li in LiCoO2 with theoretical specific capacity of 274 mAh g−1 brings about a 6–8% reduction in volume of the unit cell, which is detrimental to electrode reversibility. Practically delithiation in LiCoO2 is restricted to x = 0.526 giving rise to 4.2 V vs.Li/Li+. This limitation is mainly attributed to the structural instability, arising from a significant overlap of the redox active Co3+/4+:t2g band with the top of the O2−:2p band.27 However, 90–95% of lithium can be accommodated in CoO2 by electrochemical reduction at a low rate suggesting that both phase and volume changes are reversible.28 Dissolution of Co at high potential in the electrolyte causes capacity fade upon cycling above 4.2 V. Therefore cycling of the LiCoO2 cathode is generally limited to only up to 4.2 V. However, several efforts are being made to achieve high energy density and long cycle-life. For instance, nanoscale engineering and nanochemistry such as surface-coating and control of particle sizes and morphologies are appealing more versatile approaches. Gu et al.29 have synthesized nanofibers using sol–gel based electrospinning techniques. The obtained fibers have a dense and slippery outer shell (Fig. 9).

The obtained cyclic voltammogram of LiCoO2 nanofibers shows smaller peak separation between anodic and cathodic peaks compared with powder electrodes, illustrating that the diffusion and migration Li+ ions are slower in the powder electrode compared to the nanofibers. LiCoO2 nanofibers exhibit an initial discharge capacity of about 182 mAh g−1while LiCoO2 powder shows only 132 mAh g−1. The surface areas were found to be 18.04 and 3.14 m2 g−1 for prepared LiCoO2 nanofibers and powder, respectively. The enhanced capacity value is attributed to high surface area and shorter Li+ ion diffusion distance in nanostructured fibers of LiCoO2. It is known that larger particles with longer Li+ diffusion distance are hampered for high rate capability and cyclability. For example, smaller primary particles of Li[Ni0.20Li0.2Mn0.6]O2 in the range of 80–200 nm forming large aggregates of 1–20 μm showed the initial discharge capacity of about 288 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, while the discharge capacity decreased to 200 mAh g−1 by increasing the current density to 400 mA g−1 in discharge capacity.30 Layered Li0.88[Li0.18Co0.33Mn0.49]O2nanowires have been synthesized by the hydrothermal process at 200 °C.31 The initial charge and discharge capacities are 283 and 245 mAh g−1 at 1 C, respectively, with reasonably good cyclability at high rates. Only 8% capacity loss was observed after 50 cycles at a rate of 1 C. In addition to capacity retention, nanowires having a diameter of about 50 nm delivered the initial discharge capacities of 245 mAh g−1 and 220 mAh g−1 at 48 mA g−1 and 3000 mA g−1, respectively. This clearly indicates that the obtained nanowires possess excellent rate capability for high power density devices. The high surface area and shorter diffusion path of nanowires likely lead to higher electrode/electrolyte contact area and reduced strain of interaction during the charge–discharge process to improved cycling performance. xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiMO2 (where M = Mn, Ni and Co) is an another interesting composite materials with a layered structure.32,33 The advantage of using layered structured electrode systems such as Li2MnO3 and LiMnO2 (structurally integrated) allow lithium extraction/insertion from/into the LiMnO2 component while using the structurally compatible electrochemically inert Li2MnO3 to provide stability to the electrode at a defined potential. Johnson et al.34 have prepared xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)Li(Mn0.33Ni0.33Co0.33)O2 where x = 0.5 and 0.7, by the co-precipitate method. These materials deliver anomalously high capacity at 50 °C, greater than theoretical value, by complete removal of lithium ions.
Spinel oxides
Spinel LiMn2O4 has appeared as another important electrode material in Li-ion batteries due to its low cost and environmentally benign. Though the use of spinel as positive electrode was reported in 1983,35 the importance of the spinel compound has been realized only after the commercial Li battery using LiMn2O4 as active material brought out by Nippon Moli.
It has cubic spinel structure with space group fd-3m. Li and Mn ions occupy 8a tetrahedral sites and 16d octahedral sites, respectively, of the cubic close packed oxygen array with other octahedral site vacant (Fig. 10). In the framework, MO6 octahedra share edges to build a rigid 3-dimensional network with open interconnected channels in the <110> direction where Li+ ions are mobile within these channels along 8a-16c-8a path.36,37 Reversible extraction/insertion of Li+ ion from the matrix proceeds in predominantly two steps, one around 4 V and the other around 3 V.38 However, the insertion/de-insertion at about 3 V leads to poor cycling behaviour due to the asymmetric lattice expansion/contraction associated with the Jahn Teller effect of the Mn3+ ion.39,40 During the 4 V potential range the cubic symmetry was maintained consequently leads to good rechargeability and cycling stability.

Traditionally, spinel LiMn2O4 has been synthesized by conventional solid state methods by heating lithium compounds (LiOH, Li2CO3, LiNO3 or LiI) with manganese oxide, acetate or hydroxide.41 As the annealing process involves heating at a high temperature in air, it leads to the formation of large particle size in the range 1–3 μm. Nanoparticles of spinel LiMn2O4 have been synthesized by various procedures, which include laser ablation,42 sol–gel,43spray drying,44 template synthesis,45,46combustion synthesis,47 microemulsion,48 the Pechni method,49,50 solid state reaction,51 and the resorcinol-formaldehyde route52etc. Cabana et al.46 have synthesized nanoparticles of LiMn2O4 by a hard template route. The average particle size was found to be 15 nm after firing the reactants at 600 °C for 4 h. In comparison to the micron size particles, nanoparticles of LiMn2O4 offered better performance. A discharge capacity of 113 mAh g−1 was obtained by nano-LiMn2O4 whereas micron size particles of LiMn2O4 delivered a capacity of 105 mAh g−1. Moreover, nano-LiMn2O4 was observed to exhibit better performance at 2 C rate and with better capacity retention in comparison with the micron size particles. Nanocrystalline LiMn2O4 particles of size around 42–70 nm have been prepared by combustion synthesis.47 The compound synthesized by using PVA–urea delivered a discharge capacity of 137 mAh g−1 with only a 10% reduction of the capacity after 50 cycles. In another study, Wu et al.44 reported a discharge capacity of 131 mAh g−1 at 1/2 C rate with good capacity retention for LiMn2O4 of particle size less than 100 nm synthesized by spray drying method. Stoichiometric LiMn2O4 was synthesized by Shaju et al.52 which consisted of particles of 50–100 nm in size fused to form a porous structure. The oxide delivered an initial capacity of about 131 mAh g−1 with an excellent cyclability at a discharge rate of 1/2 C. In addition, the oxide retained 90% of its capacity at 40 C and 85% at 60 C. The electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 has been reported to have a close relationship with its morphology. Cui et al.51 synthesized LiMn2O4 nanorods by a solid state reaction. The as prepared LiMn2O4 nanorods have an average diameter of 130 nm and length of 1.2 μm. It was observed that the performance of the nanorods was better than a commercial sample at high rates, although the discharge capacity was almost the same (100 mAh g−1) at 1/10 C rate. Morphology plays an important role in improving the kinetic properties of the materials coupled with good capacity retention upon cycling. Single crystalline spinel nanowires have been obtained by a high temperature solid state reaction.53 The nanowire structure was found to be maintained without any deformation even at 800 °C (Fig. 11a).

The discharge capacity values at current densities of 0.1, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1 were 118, 108, 102 and 88 mAh g−1, respectively. A small variation in capacity as function of current density proves the excellent rate capability of LiMn2O4 nanowires as seen in Fig. 11b. However, the commercial samples yielded lower capacity values at high rates probably because of their large particle size. Most of the nanostructured electrode materials were prepared at low temperatures. LiMn2O4 nanoparticles have been obtained by microwave assisted hydrothermal method using prior synthesized amorphous manganese oxide and LiOH. More importantly, authors have achieved well crystalline LiMn2O4 without any high temperature treatment. The achievement of 85% capacity retention is mainly attributed to the nanocrystalline nature of LiMn2O4.54 Depending upon the synthetic procedure, nanosized LiMn2O4 with different physical and chemical properties such as crystallinity, specific surface area and different morphologies were obtained. Nanoparticles of LiMn2O4 synthesized by an acetate based solution route exhibited severe capacity fade on cycling.55 In search of materials with smaller particles in comparison with the existing micron sized particles, recently sub-micron size particles have drawn attention. Several procedures were reported for the synthesis of sub-micrometer size particle of LiMn2O4. Wu et al.56 reported the formation of LiMn2O4 by the Pechni method followed by heating between 600 and 800 °C for 6 h. Size of the particles increased from 30 nm to 0.2–0.6 μm on heating from 600 to 800 °C. The sub-micrometer size particles performed better than the nanosize particles prepared at low temperature. Similar data was also reported by Liu et al.43LiMn2O4 was prepared by the sol–gel method using lithium and manganese acetate as precursors. It was reported that the calcined product at 600 °C had an average particle size of 119 nm. However, the spinel phase was obtained at 300 °C itself. The sample heated at 600 °C delivered a discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1 with good cyclability in relation to the nanosize sample prepared at a low temperature. Hydrothermally51 prepared LiMn2O4 having a particle size distribution in the range of 50–300 nm delivered a discharge capacity of 121 mAh g−1 at rate 1/10 C. Synthesis of sub-micrometer size LiMn2O4 particles by the microemulsion route has proven as versatile method.48 A reversible extraction of Li+ from LiMn2O4 occurs in two steps at 4.05 V and 4.15 V resulting in MnO2. Despite the high operating voltage of spinel LiMn2O4 compared to LiCoO2, the achievable capacity is lower with poor cyclability. The fundamental problems associated with spinel LiMn2O4 is poor cyclability due to the following reasons: (i) dissolution of Mn into the electrolyte, (ii) decomposition of the electrolyte at fully charged state, (iii) break down of spinel frame work due to repeated contraction–expansion and (iv) Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ at 3 V. The surface coatings have become more important in improving the electrochemical performance including reversible capacity, columbic efficiency in the first cycle, cycling behavior, and rate capability. Surface modifications of LiMn2O4 with oxides such as ZnO, MgO, Al2O3, CuO and CeO2 have been investigated to improve the cyclability.57 For instance, the effect of ZnO coating on the surface of LiMn2O4 has been investigated by Sun et al.58 It is evident from scanning electron microscopy that the ZnO nanoparticles were uniformly coated on the surface of LiMn2O4. Both as prepared and ZnO coated LiMn2O4 showed the nearly same discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1 irrespective of ZnO. The ZnO coated electrodes, exhibiting no capacity loss even after 50 cycles, remarkably improved the cycling stability, while the bare LiMn2O4 suffered a 10% capacity loss after 50 cycles. Similarly, Liu et al.59 have modified the surface of LiMn2O4 with ZnO by using a chemical process. The initial discharge capacity of bare and ZnO coated LiMn2O4 were found to be 124 mAh g−1 and 121 mAh g−1 respectively. However, ZnO coated LiMn2O4 retained 97% of its initial capacity, while 21.4% capacity loss was observed in the case of bare LiMn2O4. The enhanced capacity retention was attributed to significantly reduced HF content in the electrolyte, resulting in the decrease of Mn dissolution.
LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 has received special interest as 5 V cathode due to its high specific capacity, dominant plateau at around 4.8 V and the high rate capability offered by the 3-dimensional Li+ ion diffusion in the spinel lattice. The tetravalent of Mn in LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 has restrained its dissolution into the electrolyte effectively, compared to LiMn2O4 in which 50% of Mn exists as Mn3+ leading to a huge Mn dissolution. Thus, LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 showed excellent cycling stability.60 However, LixNi1−xO, an impurity phase, always forms during the synthesis of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4. Recently, it has shown that cationic substitutions help to eliminate the formation of LixNi1−xO and stabilize the spinel structure. Liu et al.61 have investigated systematically the improved electrochemical performance of Fe substituted LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4. For example, partial substitution of Fe for Ni in LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LiMn1.5Ni0.42Fe0.08O4) delivered a high discharge capacity of 136 mAh g−1 at 1/6 C with 100% stable capacity in 100 cycles and capacity of 106 mAh g−1 even at 10 C rate. This improved electrochemical performance of Fe substituted LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 is attributed to the stabilization of the cation-disorded structure, suppression of the formation of thick SEI layers, and lower polarization resistance.
Arrebola et al.62 have synthesized highly crystalline nanometric LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 by a template synthesis method using PEG-400 (PEG: polyethylene glycol) as a sacrificial template. The discharge capacity obtained for this material was found to be 121 mAh g−1 at 2 C rate. Also it showed the superior electrochemical rate performance due to high crystallinity and nano size of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4. Sun et el.63 have optimized the synthesis conditions to prepare LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 by an ultrasonic assisted sol–gel method. The sample annealed at 850 °C delivered a remarkably high discharge capacity of 134.5 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C with 96.2% capacity retention after 50 cycles.

        Phospho-olivines

Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) is another emerging cathode material in Li-ion batteries reported by Goodenough et al.64 The importance of LiFePO4 arises from low raw material cost, environmental compatibility, higher thermal stability at fully charged state, high energy density and high safety in comparison with the other positive electrode materials. With a theoretical capacity of 170 mAh g−1, higher than that of LiCoO2, at a flat potential 3.4 V vs.Li/Li+ plateau, it adopts the olivine based structure with space group Pmna in which Li, Fe and P atoms occupy octahedral 4a, octahedral 4c and tetrahedral sites, respectively (Fig. 12). Divalent Fe2+ ions occupy corner shared octahedra and the lithium ions reside in chains of edge-shared octahedra.

The possibility of chemically removing Li+ from LiFePO4 resulted in FePO4 which is isostructural with Fe0.65Mn0.35PO4 has been demonstrated by Goodenough. The olivine LiFePO4 with covalently bonded PO4 groups and more stable redox couple offers excellent chemical stability.64 The Fe2+/3+:t2g band is placed well above the top of the O2−:2p band resulting good chemical stability. However, LiFePO4 limits its performance due to its poor electronic and Li ion conductivities arising from lack of mixed valency and one-dimensional lithium ion diffusion.65 Recently, various approaches such as cationic doping, synthesizing nanostructured materials via solution-based synthesis, and coating with electronically conductive polymers and carbon have been explored to overcome these problems.66–71
In LiFePO4, Li ions shuttles front and back from the structure, the phosphate group remains inactive. Thus, there is only the minimum possibility of the reaction of oxygen with the electrolyte. Hence, LiFePO4 is a very appropriate candidate for increasing the rate capability by decreasing the particle size. For instance, nanoparticles of LiFePO4 have been synthesized by polyol method.72 Discharge capacity of 166 mAh g−1 was observed at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 with good cycle-life. More importantly, it exhibited excellent rate performance at 30 C and 60 C rates with 58% and 47% of capacity retention, respectively. Masquelier et al.73 have prepared nanoparticles of LiFePO4 by direct precipitation method followed by soft thermal treatment at 500 °C for 3 h under slight reducing atmosphere. The average particles size was found to be 140 nm (Fig.13).

Attractive electrochemical performance of the sample was obtained in terms of specific capacity, i.e. 147 mAh g−1 at 5 C rate, and there was no significant capacity fade after more than 400 cycles. The co-precipitate method has also been adapted to synthesize LiFePO4 particles by Zheng et al.74 The particle sizes were in the range of 100–200 nm. The electrochemical performance of the sample synthesized at 500 °C delivered a high discharge capacity of 166 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C rate and possessed a favourable capacity retention on cycling at different rates from 0.1 C to 10 C rate. The rate capability of the batteries plays a crucial role in achieving high power density devices for various applications especially EVs and HEVs. Kang et al.75 have synthesized off-stoichiometric LiFePO4 nanoparticles of 50 nm in size by a solid state reaction. They have demonstrated that Li ion batteries can be charged in a matter of seconds. Within 72 s (50 C), nanoparticles of LiFe1.95P0.95O4–δ deliver about 80% of their theoretical capacity with excellent capacity retention. In addition to a smaller path length for Li+ ion diffusion, they also claimed that it is possible to enhance the mobility of Li+ into electrode active materials by introducing the amorphous nature of the coating which removes the anisotropy of the surface properties. Lee et al.76 have synthesized a hollow sphere secondary nanostructure LiFePO4 by the precipitate method. Very interestingly, this hollow structure nanoparticles of LiFePO4 possessed extraordinary high power discharge performance especially at high rates (50 C). The enhancement in rate capability is attributed to the nano dimensional structure, conductive carbon layer on each primary particles, and full utilization of primary particles of LiFePO4 due to its hollow secondary structure.
Ravet et al.77 have shown that the carbon coating combined with the particle size-reduction have significantly improved the electrochemical performance. LiFePO4/carbon composites have been synthesized by the sol–gel78 route in the temperature range 450–850 °C consisting of 20–30 nm particles. It is believed that carbon can minimize the particle growth during the sintering process and increase the electronic conductivity of the composite materials. It has been concluded that the improved rate capability is due to small grain size and enhanced electronic conductivity. Slides et al.79 have synthesized LiFePO4/carbon nanofibers using polycarbonate filter as template. The carbon particles dispersed throughout the nanofibers of LiFePO4 (Fig. 14)

This unique morphology of LiFePO4/carbon composites leads to a very high discharge capacity of 165 mAh g−1 at 3 C. Moreover, it retains 36% of its theoretical capacity at 65 C. Nanorods of LiFePO4 were synthesized using the hydrothermal method by Huang et al.80 The obtained nanorods have uniform diameter around 100 nm and an aspect ratio of 5–10 nm. Good crystallinity and clear lattice fringes of nanorods are evident from HRTEM investigations. Two lattice fringes having d spacing values 0.61 nm and 0.47 nm corresponding to (010) and (001) planes respectively. The reduced crystal size leads to the reduction in the diffusion path for Li ions and electron transportation enhancing the electrochemical properties. Subsequently, Manthiram et al.81 have recently synthesized LiFePO4 with nanostructures by a microwave assisted solvothermal and hydrothermal route. It was reported that nanorods with shorter length (i.e., 25 nm × 100 nm) performed better than longer rods (40 nm × 1 μm). A very high capacity of about 166 mAh g−1, which is close to theoretical capacity, could be achieved with small nanorods. In another study, a solution based synthesis method was used to obtain nanorods of LiFePO4 by H. Liu et al.82 The diameter and length of each rod were about 20 m and 50 nm respectively. The capacity values were found to be 150, 141, 94, and 80 mAh g−1 at the rate of 5,10, 50, and 60C rate, respectively with high coulombic efficiency of about 98%. The high rate capability is mainly attributed to the reduced path for the electron transport and ion diffusion in the electrode material.
Since the pioneering work on LiFePO4 by Padhi et al.,64 other transition metal phosphates with olivine structures were also studied. Among them, LiMnPO4 has gained enormous interest due to the potential of the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple located at 4.1 V vs.Li/Li+. Drezen et al.83 have systematically investigated the effect of particle size on electrochemical performance of LiMnPO4. The discharge capacity increased from 78 to 116 mAh g−1 on moving the particles size from 270 nm to 140 nm. Moreover, at 1 C rate the capacities were found to be 81 and 7 mAh g−1 for 140 nm and 270 nm diameter particles, respectively, indicating the feasibility of small particles in high power applications (Fig. 15).

Wang et al.84 have clearly demonstrated the benefits of using crystalline platelet structured LiMnPO4 synthesized by the polyol method at 100 °C. This platelet morphology offers very high capacity 145 mAh g−1 at 1/20 C. Moreover, due to this interesting morphology, it was possible to reach high discharge capacity 113 mAh g−1 with a short period of time (1 h). A minimal effect of Jahn–Teller distortion from the Mn(III) [d4: t2g3 eg1] is evident from the stable cycling of this material over 200 cycles. Large polarization during charging has always been identified as a significant problem in achieving high rate. Crystallinity is an important factor which manipulates polarization in electrode materials. It is widely known that low temperature routes have been adapted to synthesize the nanomaterials to prevent grain growth and agglomarization.
High sintering temperatures are required to achieve more thermodynamically stable structures with stronger bonding, which facilitate the one dimensional diffusion path for Li ions, thus enhancing the electrochemical activity. In this regard, Choi et al.85 have obtained highly crystalline LiMnPO4 nanoplates by a molten hydrocarbon-assisted solid state reaction. As obtained nanoplate of LiMnPO4 is approximately 50 nm in thickness with 1–2 μm length (Fig. 16). This nanoplate morphology of LiMnPO4 exhibited high discharge capacity of 168 mAh g−1 at 1/50 C with reasonably good cyclability.

Based on our literature evaluation, the morphology of layered, spinel and olivine based cathode materials significantly influence the specific capacity. Fig. 17 illustrates the observed capacity ranges for various cathode materials discussed in this review.

Conclusions and remarks
This article clearly demonstrates the importance of nanostructured materials in developing the high performance Li-ion batteries. Lithium insertion into or extraction from the electrode is crucial parameter which influences the charge–discharge processes. Properties of nanostructured metal oxides, such as high surface area, short diffusion paths, and large active sites make them the most promising active materials for high energy storage devices. With the advent of Li ion batteries, the gap between electronic technologist and battery specialist has narrowed to large extent. However, for the realization of a wide range of industrial applications such as electric and hybrid electric vehicles, further rapid development is required in miniaturization of batteries with enhanced power and energy capabilities. Further understanding of the mechanisms of Li ion storage in nano sized materials and kinetic transport properties on the interface between electrode and electrolyte has to be investigated in detail. In order to develop the next generation of green and sustainable energy storage devices, nanomaterials and nanotechnology have to be combined with novel synthesis methods with low cost and commercially viable processes. Electrospinning is such a cheaper but industry viable synthetic method that produces the nanostructures such as nanorods, nanofibers, nanotubes form upon the application of stronger electric field, hence expected to play major role in Li ion battery developments.

Seeram Ramakrishna	Seeram's research work over the past 25 years has led to seminal contributions in the novel processing and understanding of functional behavior of nanofibers and composite materials. His scientific advances contributed to enhanced solutions in energy conversion & storage, and filtration & separation fields. According to SCOPUS scientific database, he is number one in the field of electrospinning, and among the top ten to fifteen in nanotechnology. His approach of fabricating ceramic nanostructures has several advantages: a) high tunable surface area (porosity), b) hollow, aligned and core-shell morphologies, c) ease of surface functionalization, and d) creating diverse morphologies within the nanofiber structure. He demonstrated that the metal oxide nanofiber anode and cathode enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries, and revealed that nanofibers result in lower capacity fading compared to nanoparticles.
