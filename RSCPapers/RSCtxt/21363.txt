    , Accepted 9th September 2018First published on 12th September 2018AbstractWith good chemical and thermal stabilities, ZnO is a promising thermoelectric material that can be operated over a wide temperature range, particularly for high temperatures. For two dimensional (2D) thin films, modifying the thermal and electrical transport properties could be simplified due to the loss of one dimension. However, the carrier transport properties of pure ZnO have not yet been optimized. Herein, highly c-axis-orientated Ga-doped thin films have been epitaxially deposited at different temperatures, and the surface morphology and roughness have been modified. The GZO film deposited at 673 K exhibited an increased Hall mobility due to its high quality and crystallinity as well as higher carrier concentration due to enhanced Ga doping efficiency on Zn sites, resulting in its remarkable electrical conductivity. In addition, the enlarged effective mass, which could be mainly attributed to the enhancement in the density of states, allows the high retention of Seebeck coefficient value of GZO-673-AO upon increasing the carrier concentration. Ultimately, an improved power factor value of 256 μW m−1 K−2 at 623 K has been achieved for GZO-673-AO, demonstrating that Ga doping combined with optimized deposition temperatures could be a promising strategy for enhancing the thermoelectric properties of ZnO-based epitaxial films.
1. Introduction
With a capability of directly converting waste heat into electric energy (Seebeck effect) or using adjustable current to produce temperature differences (Peltier effect), thermoelectric (TE) materials and their devices could be widely used in many fields, such as power generation, solid-state cooling and tuning the catalytic activity of carbon dioxide hydrogenation, which play pivotal roles in a sustainable future.1–3 Moreover, there are numerous virtues of TE materials and devices, such as no moving parts or emissions, high reliability, and long lifetimes, making them highly promising as compared with traditional methods.4–6 However, similar to other types of energy conversion devices, such as solar and fuel cells, the low efficiency of TE devices has largely limited their future developments. Improving the conversion efficiency is a systematic and complex engineering task. One significant goal is to enhance the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = σS2T/κ, where σ is the electrical conductivity, S the Seebeck coefficient, κ the total thermal conductivity, and T the absolute temperature.7 A good TE material requires an optimized power factor (PF = σS2), and a rather small κ; therefore, for achieving high ZT values, we need to consider strong inter-correlations between phonon and electron transport, which is extremely challenging. Alloy-based material systems such as skutterudites,8 clathrates,9 half-Heusler alloys10 and bismuth/lead chalcogenides have been intensively investigated with promising electrical and thermal properties.11,12 Considering the rare, expensive and toxic elements used and their low chemical and thermal stabilities, TE alloys have numerous problems resulting from both limited resources and environmental factors.
Oxygen-containing compounds with low-cost, earth abundance and excellent intrinsic thermal and chemical stabilities in air, such as layered Ca3Co4O9 and BiCuSeO, perovskite-like SrTiO3 and simple oxide ZnO, could be used over a wide temperature range, particularly for operations at moderate and high temperatures.13–17 Among them, ZnO ceramics, with ionic bonding between the atoms and insufficient defects to create carriers, have high electrical resistivity and lattice thermal conductivity (κL).18 Hence, to improve its TE properties, optimizing the PF based on a reduced κ should be an effective strategy. For the PF modification processes, doping the Zn sites can improve the electrical properties by tuning the carrier concentration and/or band gap. For instance, several dopants, including Al, Fe, In, Ti, Mn and Ga have been used; notably, the doping efficiency values of Al and Ga are much higher than those of other dopants.19–24 In addition, Al/Ga dual doping could increase the solubility limit and achieve higher comprehensive performance.25 The ionic radius of Al3+, Ga3+ and Zn2+ are 0.054 nm, 0.062 nm and 0.074 nm, respectively, indicating that smaller distortions of crystal structure will be introduced by doping Ga on the Zn site. Considering the bond lengths of Al–O, Ga–O and Zn–O are 0.27 nm, 0.192 nm and 0.197 nm, respectively, ionic bonding still plays a predominant role after doping. Moreover, a Ga/Zn solid-solution is more stable than that of Al/Zn and hence, impurities are more difficult to form.26–28 Recently, a Ga-doped ZnO single crystal with diameter of 50.8 mm was prepared by using hydrothermal methods, showing outstanding properties, with electrical conductivity, mobility and carrier concentration of 455 S cm−1, 1 × 1019 cm−3 and 80 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.29 The atomic mass of Ga3+ is heavier than that of Al3+, which also contributes to decreasing lattice thermal conductivity by introducing more mass fluctuations. Therefore, Ga is much more effective than Al for improving the TE properties.
Based on the attributes of simple structural design and optimization, enhanced density of states (DOS) and limited phonon transport, i.e., decreased κ, low-dimensional TE materials such as two dimensional (2D) ZnO epitaxial films have attracted significant attention.30–34 For the synthesis process, several state-of-the-art methods and techniques are currently used, including magnetron sputtering,35 sol–gel,36 atomic layer deposition (ALD)37 and spin coating.38 However, to obtain the optimal stoichiometric ratios in epitaxial films, particularly for oxide-based multi-component samples, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is extensively adopted.39,40 For Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films synthesized by PLD, the strategies investigated via novel studies,14,18,41–43 including those of substrate effects, deposition temperature Td, and cooling atmosphere, have shown to be very promising. Considering the more effective Ga-doping in bulk systems, Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) epitaxial films could achieve improved TE properties. In addition, Td plays a significant role in affecting the quality of the epitaxial films, as it could change the growth rate, crystallinity, surface roughness and even Fermi level. Furthermore, both the mechanical and functional properties could be optimized;44–46e.g., ultralow temperatures hinder crystal formation, while very high temperatures result in large roughness.
In this study, highly c-axis-orientated GZO thin films have been successfully grown on Al2O3 (0001) single-crystal substrates by the PLD technique. Moreover, the surface morphology and roughness have been modified by tuning Td. The GZO film deposited at 673 K has exhibited an increased Hall mobility due to the good quality and crystallinity along with higher carrier concentration due to enhanced Ga doping efficiency on Zn sites, resulting in remarkable electrical conductivity. In addition, the enlarged effective mass, which could mainly be attributed to DOS enhancements, allows the high retention of the Seebeck coefficient value of GZO-673-AO upon increasing the carrier concentration. Consequently, an improved power factor value of 256 μW m−1 K−2 at 623 K has been achieved for GZO-673-AO, which is comparable to the best values reported for ZnO-based films.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation of GZO thin films
GZO films were grown on Al2O3 (sapphire, 0001) single-crystal substrates via the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique by utilizing a KrF excimer pulsed laser (λ = 248 nm) with a repetition rate of 5 Hz and an energy density of 1.4 J cm−2 for 20 min. The GZO (2% Ga doping, Zn0.98Ga0.02O) target was synthesized by a solid-state reaction (SSR) route at a sintering temperature of 1373 K. For the deposition and cooling processes, the oxygen pressure was maintained at 6.7 Pa and 600 Pa, respectively. The Td for different samples was set at 573 K, 673 K, 773 K and 873 K, which were symbolized as GZO-573-AO, GZO-673-AO, GZO-773-AO and GZO-873-AO, respectively. The distance between the target and substrate was 60 mm, and the growth rate was about 6.5 nm min−1. The thicknesses of GZO-573-AO, GZO-673-AO, GZO-773-AO and GZO-873-AO were 140 nm, 135 nm, 140 nm and 130 nm, respectively. After the deposition process, the films were cooled to room temperature in the chamber.
2.2 Characterization
The phase purity, crystal structure and epitaxy were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku smartlab, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphology and roughness were revealed by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Gemini SEM 500, Zeiss, Germany) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Oxford, U.S.) in tapping mode, respectively. The growth rate of thin films was determined by high-resolution X-ray reflectometry (XRR, Bruker D8 discover, Germany) and the thickness of each film was measured by AFM. The chemical states of the ions were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi, U.S.). To measure σ and S from 300 K to 623 K under helium atmosphere using the four-probe method (ZEM-3, ULVAC-RIKO, Japan), the films were first fixed to a homemade Al2O3 ceramic holder on both ends by smearing silver conductive adhesive, and then put in an oven at 323 K for 5 min, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI).† Following this, the σ and S values were measured by the four-probe method, and the settings are almost the same as usual, except the setting for sample thickness. This thickness is the real thickness of the thin films measured by AFM. Hall coefficient (RH) measurements were recorded on a homemade system equipped with a 5 T superconducting magnet (Cryogenic Limited, U.K.), and the magnetic field was measured by a flux meter. The van der Pauw method with four-probe configuration and pressure contact was used for the measurements. The carrier concentration (n) and Hall mobility (μH) were estimated from the measured RH and σ by the relations n = r/e|RH| (assuming the Hall factor r = 1.0) and μH = σ|RH|, respectively. The uncertainties of S and σ measurements are estimated to be ∼3% and ∼5%, respectively. As a result, the uncertainty in the PF is accumulated to be ∼10%.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the GZO epitaxial films (Fig. 1(a)) deposited at different temperatures present only the (002) peak of ZnO and another peak from the Al2O3 substrate, indicating that these films are highly c-axis orientated. In addition, the diffraction peaks of the GZO films agree well with those of pure ZnO deposited at 573 K, and the intensity of the (002) peak enhanced with the increase in temperature (573–873 K), illustrating that the crystallinity is evidently improved. Moreover, the (002) peak slightly shifts to a higher degree, as shown in Fig. 1(b), which relates with the smaller ionic radius of Ga3+ (r ∼0.062 nm) as compared with that of Zn2+ (r = ∼0.074 nm), revealing that Ga may be successfully doped. To further evidence this hypothesis, the c-axis lattice constants of different samples were calculated based on the XRD patterns and shown in Fig. 1(c); more details can be found in the experimental section. The decreasing trend of c with the increase in temperature ascertains that Ga has been effectively substituted into the Zn sites.

(a) The XRD patterns of GZO films grown on Al2O3 (0001) substrate with Td of 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, and 873 K; (b) an enlarged section of (a); (c) the calculated lattice constant of the c-axis; (d) out of plane ϕ scan patterns of the GZO films grown on the Al2O3 (0001) substrate deposited at 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, and 873 K. 
To evaluate the epitaxy of single-crystal thin films, out of plane ϕ scan patterns have been detected along the (101) peak; the results are shown in Fig. 1(d). Furthermore, the temperature dependence of crystallinity and epitaxy were investigated. It is noted that only at Td over 773 K, the film could demonstrate remarkable epitaxy and crystallinity with a 6-fold symmetry. For GZO-673-AO, a total of 12 peaks are marked, indicating that there is a mixed structure consisting of 30° rotated and unrotated hexagonal GZO unit cells, which are orientated along the c-axis of the Al2O3 substrate.14 In addition, the low intensity of the peaks in the patterns shows that GZO-573-AO possesses nearly no epitaxy, further proving the significance of modifying Td for the quality of films.
To shed more light on the effects of Td, the surface morphology of all our GZO thin films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The results show that all samples are composed of closely packed oval-shaped particles with the sizes in the range of 30–50 nm and have smooth surfaces, of which GZO-673-AO shows the best particle connectivity and smoothest surface. Poor connectivity between the particles is observed when Td is not sufficiently high, as indicated by the presence of some pores on the surface (Fig. 2(a)). In addition, increasing Td deteriorates the quality of the GZO films, as higher roughness and larger sizes were measured due to particles that are evident on the surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2(e) and (h), which may severely affect the transport of carriers.

To quantify the roughness and obtain more details of the morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed for further confirming the optimized conditions for deposition of GZO films. The results are shown in Fig. 2(b, d, f and i). The roughness of GZO-673-AO is 0.608 nm, which is the smallest compared with those of other films (1.098 nm for GZO-573-AO, 0.987 nm for GZO-773-AO, and 2.791 nm for GZO-873-AO). The thin films could retain dense and smooth surfaces even at higher temperatures. However, the increased number of particles with large size would destroy their microstructures. Therefore, to synthesize GZO epitaxial films with high quality, Td should be set as ∼673 K. Taking the correlation between structure and performance into account, the optimized temperature should also affect the properties of the films, particularly the TE properties.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the electrical conductivity (σ) of all samples increased with the increase in temperature, indicating that all samples possess semiconductor-like behavior. Among them, GZO-673-AO shows the highest value in the entire measured temperature range (300–623 K), in which σ increases from 228 S cm−1 at 300 K to 488 S cm−1 at 623 K; this value is almost 10 times larger than that of GZO-873-AO. Moreover, this result is also consistent with the novel research report for the effect of Td on the TE properties of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films, Mele et al.14

To reveal the electrical transport properties, Hall coefficients (RH) for all samples were measured at room temperature. The negative values illustrate that these samples are n-type. Then, the carrier concentration (n) and Hall mobility (μH) were calculated. The results are listed in Table 1 and shown in the inset of Fig. 3(c). It is noted that the n of GZO-673-AO is 3.3 × 1020 cm−3, which is higher than that of other samples, but is still lower than the theoretical value of 8.41 × 1020 cm−3, indicating that Td affects the transport properties. The reason for the maximum n obtained at 673 K is probably the enhanced doping efficiency as more Ga atoms could be substituted into the Zn sites. Oxygen vacancies may also play some role in modifying the electrical properties with varying Td; however, their small amount makes their effect negligible. Based on SEM and AFM characterizations, the remarkable quality and crystallinity of GZO-673-AO with no evident particles on the surface allow for achieving a high μH value of 18.6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high roughness and poor particle connectivity of GZO-573-AO result in an inferior μH. However, because of the decrease in roughness or increase in particle connectivity, μH only varies slightly above 673 K and remains at a high value as compared with that of GZO-673-AO. Herein, we demonstrated that the optimization of Td modified the electrical transport properties of the epitaxial films, namely, higher n due to enhanced Ga doping efficiency and an increased μH due to the direct impact of Td on the quality, roughness as well as the crystallinity of the films.

The temperature dependence of S for all thin films shows the same trend as that of σ with the increase in temperature, as shown in Fig. 3(b), and the negative values are in good agreement with RH, indicating n-type conductivity due to Ga doping on the Zn site and/or intrinsic oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the maximum S value in GZO-873-AO, varying from −53 μV K−1 at 300 K to −95 μV K−1 at 623 K, coincided with the minimum σ. However, the S value of GZO-673-AO remains comparable with the maximum value over a wide temperature range (300–523 K), which is very unique. As shown in the figure, the σ of GZO-673-AO increased evidently along with a decrease in S when the temperature was above 523 K, which is rarely seen in a wide band gap semiconductor. However, for samples with efficient dopants, such as Ga-doped ZnO, there may exist dual or multiple impurity levels rather than only one level in the bands.52 At low temperatures, majority of the carriers would be attached to the impurity levels, but they are still able to move about by hopping from one impurity level to another. Thus, more carriers (electrons) would be present in the conduction band when the temperature is just over the specific temperature, which is decided by the location of impurity levels. Therefore, based on the single parabolic band (SPB) model, the S values would decrease with the increase in carrier concentrations. However, the slight decrease in S value above 523 K could be ignored and would not significantly change the comprehensive PF value. To obtain deeper insight into the reason for retention of S values, the m* of the GZO epitaxial films are further evaluated and listed in Table 1. The calculations are based on the assumption of the SPB model and acoustic phonon scattering, and further details could be found elsewhere.4,53 As seen from Fig. 3(c), it is revealed that except for GZO-573-AO, the other three thin films show similar μH values as compared with those of other ZnO-based thin films and bulk materials.23,45–51 The m*–n plots are presented in Fig. 3(d) with additional data from literature, which evidently illustrate the nonparabolicity in the band of ZnO as m* increases with varying n. Moreover, it is revealed that the enhanced m* of GZO-673-AO plays a predominant role in retaining high S values upon increasing n. There are some differences between the m* of GZO film and other samples taken from the literature, as most points are higher than the dashed line, particularly for high n values. This demonstrates that Ga doping may introduce impurity levels that are close to the Fermi level; furthermore, both the DOS and m* could be increased. Thus, thermal tuning by optimizing Td and Ga doping contribute to enhancing the electrical properties of the films.
The chemical bonding configurations of pristine ZnO and GZO-673-AO were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and listed in Table 2. Two evident types of states are evaluated for the samples: the former type represents the binding state of Zn located at ∼1045 eV and ∼1021 eV, assigned to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, while the latter type represents the binding states of O 1s located at ∼530 eV. Compared with the spectra of ZnO, two additional peaks belonging to Ga have been detected in GZO, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The binding energies of Ga 2p1/2 and Ga 2p3/2 are found to be ∼1144.6 eV and ∼1117.6 eV, respectively, revealing that Ga atoms have been incorporated into the hexagonal structure of ZnO. Consequently, based on the comparison between the experimental results and the standard database, the oxidation states of Zn and Ga ions are +2 and +3, respectively; no other valences which may lead to the unique transport properties have been observed.

Due to the enhanced σ and S, the PF value of GZO-673-AO improved over the entire temperature range, as shown in Fig. 5(a). This value is 256 μW m−1 K−2 at 623 K, which is four to five times larger than that of the other films. Furthermore, a comparison between the results of this study and data taken from literature is shown in Fig. 5(b). Additional data including those for GZO thin films deposited at 673 K on the SiO2 substrate (GZO-673-SO) and AZO thin films deposited at 673 K on the Al2O3 substrate (AZO-673-AO) have also been added, and the red dashed line shows the average PF value of all the samples listed. It is revealed that the PF value of GZO-673-AO is still the highest, which indicates that Ga doping combined with optimum Td tuning are effective for enhancing the TE properties of ZnO-based films.

4. Conclusions
In this study, highly c-axis-oriented GZO epitaxial films have been successfully deposited on Al2O3 (0001) single crystal substrates using the PLD technique. By varying the deposition temperature from 573 K to 873 K, the surface morphology and roughness of the GZO films have been modified. Furthermore, GZO film deposited at 673 K shows the best quality and crystallinity, leading to an increase in μH along with a higher n value due to the enhanced Ga doping efficiency, resulting in remarkable electrical conductivity. Moreover, the higher m* could be mainly attributed to the enhancements in DOS based on Ga impurity levels, allowing the high retention of S value of GZO-673-AO upon increasing n. Compared with literature data, the PF value of 256 μW m−1 K−2 at 623 K for GZO-673-AO remains superior, which ascertains that optimization of deposition temperatures combined with Ga doping could be a promising strategy for improving the thermoelectric properties of ZnO-based epitaxial films.
