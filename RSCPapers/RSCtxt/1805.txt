    , Accepted 14th December 2012First published on 17th December 2012AbstractThree new n-type copolymers were synthesized using the isoindigo monomer. 5-Octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), 5,5′-dioctyl-1,1′-4H-bithieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,4′,6,6′(5H,5′H)-tetrone (BTPD) and 3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) were utilized as electron-withdrawing comonomers to obtain reduced or low bandgap n-type copolymers with deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The TPD and BTPD copolymers were synthesized using direct arylation polymerization and show bandgaps of 1.72 and 1.75 eV, respectively. Their LUMO and HOMO energy levels are also low at −4.2 and −6.0 eV, respectively. We investigated their electron mobility using thin film transistors and achieved electron mobility as high as 3.0 × 10−4 and 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 V−1 for the TPD and BTPD copolymers. The DPP copolymer was synthesized using Suzuki conditions and shows a low bandgap of 1.35 eV and a low LUMO energy level of −4.0 eV. The DPP copolymer exhibits an electron mobility of 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1. All these polymers show interesting properties as potential electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Recently, Reynolds et al. presented the synthesis of a new monomer, the planar isoindigo unit.1 This unit has been utilized for the preparation of various conjugated polymers which have already led, when blended with some fullerene derivatives, to power conversion efficiencies over 6% in organic solar cells2 and to hole mobilities over 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in organic field-effect transistors.3–6
Even if the isoindigo unit is now well studied as a p-type material, very few efforts up to now have been made to obtain n-type materials with this unit. In a recent publication, Pei et al. used a fluorinated isoindigo derivative to lower the electronic levels of the resulting copolymer and obtained an ambipolar polymer with an electron mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1.6 On the other hand, Reynolds' group investigated the utilization of this monomer for n-type polymers using an all-acceptor design employing only electron-deficient units.7 The polymers in that work exhibited low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels while having a bandgap of 1.70 eV. This shows the potential of the isoindigo unit for producing reduced bandgap n-type copolymers for use in organic electronics.
A major application of organic n-type materials is organic photovoltaics. Until now, the most efficient n-type materials used in organic solar cells are based on fullerene derivatives. Bulk heterojunction solar cells of these molecules mixed with a p-type polymer or small molecule can now achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 8% in both single-layer8–11 and tandem cells.12,13 Systems employing electron-accepting polymers as the n-type material were also explored. This approach has several advantages compared to polymer–fullerene blends since conjugated polymers often exhibit absorption at longer wavelengths and have higher absorption coefficients than fullerene derivatives, which should help to increase the photocurrent. However, all-polymer solar cells still fall short in showing their potential since the best efficiency devices struggle to surpass a PCE of 1.9–2.0%,14–17 the best cell reported in the literature being at 2.7%.18 It is also notable that this field has not made significant progress since the publication by Friend et al. in 1998 which demonstrated a PCE of 1.9% for all-polymer solar cells19 based on a cyano derivative of poly(p-phenylene vinylene).
As it has been pointed out,20,21 it is possible to use two polymers with complementary bandgaps in order to reduce light absorption overlap and to achieve better spectral coverage. This has the potential to yield higher photocurrents in polymer blend devices. As some of the most efficient and well-studied p-type polymers possess bandgaps higher than 1.8 eV, it is possible to design n-type polymers with a complementary lower bandgap. Polymers such as regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT), with their bandgap of 1.9 eV,22,23 could benefit from such reduced bandgap n-type materials. However, the design of such materials is not easy since there are few examples of conjugated polymers with bandgaps below 1.8 eV exhibiting both n-type properties and producing PCE higher than 1% in all-polymer devices.24–26
In the present study, the properties of new n-type conjugated copolymers have been investigated and their electron mobilities measured. The isoindigo unit was utilized with different electron-withdrawing comonomers with low steric hindrance. More precisely, 5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), 5,5′-dioctyl-1,1′-4H-bithieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,4′,6,6′(5H,5′H)-tetrone (BTPD) and 3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) units were copolymerized with isoindigo. In this way, we have been able to produce n-type copolymers with good charge mobility, low energy levels and reduced or low bandgaps.
Synthesis of the polymers
As mentioned above, the TPD, BTPD, and DPP comonomers were chosen to produce all-acceptor copolymers with reduced or low bandgaps and low energy levels. The comonomers DPP,27 TPD,28 BTPD29 and their dibromide derivatives were prepared according to methods already published. Diborylated isoindigo was prepared using the method recently described by Reynolds' group.7 The synthesis of the polymers is described in Fig. 1. The synthesis of P1–P3 was first tried using standard conditions of Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. While P3 could be obtained with a yield of 70% (Mn of 44 kDa and Mw of 132 kDa) using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and potassium carbonate as the base (see the detailed method in the ESI†), syntheses of P1 and P2 were not successful using this method. Several other catalytic systems were studied for both P1 and P2 while using the same general procedure used for P3: Pd(PPh3)4 with potassium fluoride; Pd2dba3 with tri(o-tolyl)phosphine and tetraethylammonium hydroxide and Pd2dba3 with triphenylarsine and tetraethylammonium hydroxide.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis of the polymers. 
Almost none of these conditions allowed the formation of polymers. Only the catalytic system using Pd2dba3 with tri(o-tolyl)phosphine and tetraethylammonium hydroxide yielded some polymeric product with TPD, but none could be isolated from the reaction with BTPD. A TPD-based copolymer soluble in hexanes was obtained after 48 hours of polymerization with a yield of 16%. A number average molecular weight (Mn) of 13 kDa with a polydispersity index (PD) of 1.3 was measured. In all other cases, only products soluble in methanol were obtained and all the monomers used were degraded. These results are not surprising as, even though a lot of work involving TPD was done, we could find very few examples of polymers made from the dibrominated derivatives of TPD using Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings.29–31
Since it was difficult to copolymerize TPD or BTPD units with the diborylated isoindigo derivative, we opted to copolymerize the dibromoisoindigo derivative with non-brominated TPD and BTPD by the utilization of the recently developed direct (hetero)arylation polymerization. This method allows the formation of C–C bonds by directly coupling a halogenated aromatic compound with an aromatic C–H bond.32,33 There have been recently several publications on this type of polymerization.34–50 Though this polymerization method is highly promising, some limitations have been identified by Kanbara et al.34 For instance, when coupling a halogenated aromatic compound on a hydrogenated thiophene derivative, it seems that if the 3,4-positions are unsubstituted, some cross-linking can occur. However, using units with substituted 3,4-positions generally allows the formation of processable copolymers with high molecular weights and yields. As recently demonstrated by our group,40 TPD, which possesses such protected 3,4-positions, is a good candidate for direct (hetero)arylation polymerization.
The procedure used for P1* and P2* was based on one of our recent publications40 (see the detailed method in the ESI†). Several ligands (shown in Fig. 2) and bases were investigated for the synthesis of P1* and P2*. Results of this optimization are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for P1* and P2*, respectively. Ligand optimization results for P1* are shown in entries 1–5 of Table 1. Polymeric products could be obtained with all investigated ligands except for JohnPhos (2-(di-tert-butylphosphino)biphenyl, L5), where no color change of the reaction mixture was observed. Low molecular weight polymers soluble in hexanes were obtained with tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate (L3) and triphenylphosphine (L4). Polymers not soluble in hexanes but soluble in chloroform were obtained with tricyclohexylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate (L1) and tri(o-anisyl)phosphine (L2). Both yields and molecular weights obtained with L2 (Mn = 24 kDa, Mw = 53 kDa and Y = 77%) were better than those obtained with L1 (Mn = 14 kDa, Mw = 24 kDa and Y = 37%). For the polymerization done with L2, some polymer was still left in the Soxhlet cartridge after chloroform extraction.

For P2*, different ligands were also examined with cesium carbonate as the base, as shown in entries 6–9 of Table 2. In this case, the only condition which yielded a polymer was with L3 (Mn = 18 kDa, Mw = 40 kDa and Y = 80%). The utilization of L1, L2 or L4 afforded brown solutions containing no polymers. Further optimizations were tried by changing the base (entries 10–13 of Table 2). Except for potassium tert-butoxide, all these conditions successfully gave polymeric materials. Molecular weights varied greatly depending upon the nature of the base. The utilization of cesium pivalate (Mn = 5 kDa, Mw = 9 kDa and Y = 74%) and the addition of 30% mol of pivalic acid to 2.3 equivalents of cesium carbonate (Mn = 14 kDa, Mw = 32 kDa and Y = 71%) gave both lower yields and lower molecular weights. Potassium acetate led to comparable results (Mn = 20 kDa, Mw = 43 kDa and Y = 87%) to those obtained with cesium carbonate. It is worth noting that the direct (hetero)arylation procedure was not utilized for the preparation of P3 since the couplings are not yet selective enough for the corresponding comonomers.
Characterization of polymers
High molecular weight P1* and P2* (entry 2 of Table 1 and entry 11 of Table 2) as well as P1 and P3, were further characterized using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy
UV-vis absorption spectra of P1, P1*, P2* and P3 were obtained both in solution in chloroform and as a thin film on a glass substrate. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 3. P1, P1* and P2* have similar absorption UV-vis spectra with a broad absorption at long wavelengths, giving similar optical bandgaps (1.71 for P1, 1.72 eV for P1*, and 1.75 eV for P2*). The absorption maxima in thin films are of 614 nm for P1, 618 nm for P1* and 611 nm for P2*. The absorption of these polymers is broad, giving them a dark blue color in solution.

We also investigated the effect of molecular weight on the absorption spectra of P1* using the polymers obtained with the polymerization conditions shown in entries 1 to 4 of Table 1. We then compared these results to the absorption spectrum of P1 and the results are shown in Fig. 4. It can clearly be observed that a higher molecular weight leads to an increase of the absorption at longer wavelengths relative to its absorption at shorter wavelengths. P1 shows an absorption spectrum similar to P1*, indicating both polymers share similar structures.

P3 yields a completely different absorption spectrum with an absorption extending to longer wavelengths. The absorption onset of this polymer is at 930 nm, yielding a low bandgap of 1.35 eV. The absorption maximum for this polymer is of 837 nm. P3 presents a small red shift of its absorption spectrum as a thin film compared to that obtained in solution (see comparison in the ESI†). The optical bandgaps of these polymers are summarized in Table 3.

Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers were obtained using polymer films deposited on platinum electrodes. A reference electrode of Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) was used. This Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The resulting voltammograms, presented versus SCE, are shown in Fig. 5. Energy levels were estimated using the onset of the reduction peak (LUMO level) and the onset of the oxidation peak (HOMO level), assuming that the SCE is −4.71 eV from vacuum. The results obtained are summarized in Table 3.
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of P1, P1*, P2* and P3. 
Energy levels of P1* and P2* are relatively low with LUMO energy levels of −4.2 eV, a value which is close to that of PC61BM.51 The LUMO energy level of P1 is at −4.1 eV. HOMO energy levels are also low, with a value of −6.0 eV for both P1 and P1* and of −6.1 eV for P2*. These three polymers show no electrochemical reversibility in the oxidation process, but present some quasi-reversibility in their reduction wave.
Cyclic voltammogram of P3 shows some reversibility both in its oxidation and in its reduction. The LUMO energy level of this polymer is of −4.0 eV, which is higher than that of P1* and P2*. Its HOMO energy level is also higher at −5.3 eV.
These results suggest that P1, P1* and P2* might be excellent candidates as n-type polymers, possibly for all-polymer solar cells. Their LUMO and HOMO energy levels are almost as low as PC61BM and they possess deep HOMO energy levels. Their bandgaps also mean they could be well matched with higher bandgap polymers such as P3HT and PCDTBT. P3 presents an even lower bandgap, but its LUMO and HOMO energy levels are higher than P1* and P2*, making it a possibly better match for P3HT.
Thin film transistor properties
Thin film transistor properties of P1*, P2* and P3 were investigated in order to assess their potential as n-type copolymers. After annealing at 200 °C, P1* and P2* exhibit interesting electron mobility of 2.0 ± 0.7 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1 (best cell: 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1) for P1* and 2.5 ± 0.7 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 V−1 (best cell: 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 V−1) for P2*. P3 presents, after annealing at 200 °C, an electron mobility of 1.6 ± 0.6 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1 (best cell: 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1).
According to these results, it appears that using BTPD instead of TPD tends to increase the electron mobility. This could be explained by the fact that BTPD is centrosymmetric while TPD is not. According to the work done recently by Pei et al.,3 using centrosymmetric comonomers with isoindigo increases the hole mobility of the corresponding copolymers due to better packing. In the BTPD case, this effect might be helping with the electron mobility. The electron mobility presented by all these polymers are comparable to the mobility of PC61BM in a thin film52,53 (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), meaning they have the potential to be applied as n-type materials in organic electronics.
Conclusion
We have reported the synthesis of new polymers presenting n-type properties for potential applications as acceptor polymers in all-polymer solar cells. The polymers synthesized were based on isoindigo copolymerized with 5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), 5,5′-dioctyl-1,1′-4H-bithieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,4′,6,6′(5H,5′H)-tetrone (BTPD) or 3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP). The DPP and TPD copolymers could be synthesized with Suzuki–Miyaura conditions, but we were unable to synthesize the BTPD copolymer using this method. The TPD and BTPD polymers were synthesized using the advantageous direct (hetero)arylation polymerization reaction, thus reducing the number of steps necessary to obtain these polymers. Bandgaps obtained were of 1.72, 1.75 and 1.35 eV for the TPD, BTPD and DPP polymers, respectively. They also possess low-lying LUMO and HOMO, with the TPD and BTPD derivatives having LUMO levels of −4.2 eV. Their electron mobility was also tested, resulting in mobility as high as 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 V−1 for the BTPD copolymer. These polymers show promising features for applications as acceptors in all-polymer solar cells and will be further investigated in the near future.
