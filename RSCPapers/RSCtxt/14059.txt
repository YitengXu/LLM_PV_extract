We observed that the values of QFL of TiO2 at short circuit and open circuit are different and found for the first time the linear relationships between QFL shifts at short circuit and open circuit induced by 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and that the slopes of the lines were significantly influenced by the nature of cations in the electrolyte. Different QFL shifts at short circuit and open circuit were observed in the presence of TBA+. These quantitative results suggest that the QFL of TiO2 films at short circuit and open circuit can be adjusted separately by developing suitable additives and cations, which will be helpful to further improve the efficiency of DSCs.
The development of solar energy conversion technology is expected to help meet the rapidly increasing global demand for energy.1,2 Solar cells based on nanostructured materials are currently attracting widespread attention because of their potential low cost, environmentally friendly photovoltaics characteristics, and high efficiencies.3Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) based on randomly associated TiO2 nanoparticles have received much interest in recent years.4–7 A typical DSC consists of a dye-adsorbed nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode based on a transparent conducting oxide substrate, a platinum (Pt) counter electrode, and an electrolyte solution containing an I3−/I−redox couple between the electrodes. Although overall energy conversion efficiencies exceeding 11% have been achieved,7 the efficiency must be increased further if such cells are to be used for commercial power generation.
The use of additives such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and cations in the electrolyte is an effective way to improve the conversion efficiency. However, many studies have shown that although TBP greatly improves the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the cell, the improvement is accompanied by a decrease in the short-circuit current density (JSC).8–11 If this trade-off could be eliminated, that is, if both VOC and JSC could be improved simultaneously or one could be maintained while the other was increased, an efficiency of 15% could be achieved,12 which would be high enough for industrial applications. The trade-off is thought to result from a decrease in electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 film due to the influence of surface adsorption of TBP on the Fermi level of the TiO2 film.13 However, accurately determining the Fermi level of a TiO2 film is difficult in practice, so indirect methods such as intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy,14Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,15 the charge extraction method,16,17 and density functional theory calculations18 have been employed. Despite such attempts, accurate results of QFL shifts are still limited owing to the lack of a direct method. We recently reported direct experimental evidence that the TBP-induced increase in VOC is due to a shift of the QFL to higher potential and that the QFL shifts at short circuit and open circuit are the same.19
In the current study, to further investigate the effect of TBP on the QFL of TiO2 films, we used two different cations in the electrolyte, as cations are generally used as the counter ions of the iodide salt in the typical I−/I3− electrolyte of DSCs. We selected Li+ ions because they are widely used in the most highly efficient DSCs and well known to improve JSC and selected tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA+) ions to compare because they have large size.20,21 On the basis of our results, we discuss the possible relationship between adsorption of the cations and TBP on the surface of the TiO2 films.
To measure the QFL shifts, we used a direct method based on a three-electrode DSC.19 We determined the QFLs of TiO2 films during measurements of the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the three-electrode DSC (Fig. 1). In the DSC, the thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 film was about 6 μm after heating. The Ti electrode was 1 mm wide and ∼100 nm thick. The TiO2 film was sensitized with 0.3 mM (Bu4N)2[Ru(Hdcbpy)2 (NCS)2] dye (N719 dye; H2dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine, Bu4N = tetra-n-butylammonium) solution. The active area of each DSC was 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. The electrolyte consisted of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI or 0.1 M TBAI, and 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in acetonitrile; and TBP was added to the electrolyte at a concentration of 0.1–0.5 M. Three cells were prepared for each electrolyte composition, and replicate cells prepared with identical electrolyte compositions gave highly reproducible results. The J–V characteristics were measured under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated solar illumination at 100 mWcm−2. All the QFLs were measured with respect to the equilibrium redox potential of the electrolyte. The QFL of the electrolyte side of the TiO2 film is referred as EQFL.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the three-electrode DSC and the circuit connection used during measurements of J–V and QFL. 
The variations of the EQFL values of the TiO2 films in DSCs containing 0.1 M Li+ or TBA+ in the electrolyte were strongly influenced by the type of cation in both the presence and absence of TBP (Fig. 2). The EQFL values of the cells containing TBA+ were clearly higher than those of the cells containing Li+, and in the presence of TBP, EQFL shifted to higher potential both for cells containing Li+ and for cells containing TBA+. In our previous study, we found that the QFL profile of a TiO2 film is determined by the QFLs at short circuit and open circuit (EQFL,SC and EQFL,OC, respectively).19 Therefore, in this work, we paid special attention to the short-circuit and open-circuit conditions.

For comparison of the effects of additives on the QFLs at both short circuit and open circuit, the EQFL,SC and EQFL,OC values for the different additive components are summarized in Fig. 3. In the cell containing 0.1 M Li+ (Fig. 3a), the EQFL,SC and EQFL,OC values were much lower than those in the cell containing 0.1 M TBA+ (the differences were 0.2 and 0.12 V respectively). This result implies that Li+ ions shifted the QFL of the TiO2 film to lower potential much more than did the less-adsorptive TBA+ ions and that the influences of the two kinds of cations differed under short- and open-circuit conditions. The results for cells containing 0.1 M Li+ and TBP (Fig. 3b) showed that the EQFL,SC and EQFL,OC values increased by 0.13 and 0.14 V, respectively, when 0.3 M TBP was present in the electrolyte. That the EQFL,SC and EQFL,OC increases were almost the same based on two quite different initial values (0.32 V for EQFL,SC and 0.58 V for EQFL,OC) suggests that the adsorption of TBP was unaffected by the presence of Li+ ions because they can easily intercalate into the TiO2 film.22 In the cell containing TBA+ (Fig. 3c), EQFL,SC increased by 0.13 V after the addition of 0.3 M TBP, whereas EQFL,OC increased by only 0.08 V. Notably, the EQFL,SC increase induced by TBP was almost the same in the cells containing 0.1 M Li+ and 0.1 M TBA+. In other words, at short circuit, the QFLs of the TiO2 films were shifted to higher potential after the addition of 0.3 M TBP, and the shifts were nearly the same in cells containing Li+ as in those containing TBA+. In contrast, for cells containing 0.1 M TBA+, the EQFL,OC increase was much lower than the corresponding EQFL,SC increase. This difference implies that TBA+ ions can adsorb on the surface of the TiO2 film at open circuit, that the adsorbed TBA+ partially blocked the further adsorption of TBP, and that the blockage resulted in a lower increase in EQFL,OC.

We varied the TBP concentration in the presence of the cations to further investigate the influence of additives to the QFL at short circuit and open circuit and fixed the concentration of cations at 0.1 M because in the concentration range of 0.1 to 1 M, cations do not markedly influence DSC performance.21 The observed VOC, JSC, and quasi-Fermi level shift values as a function of added TBP concentration are shown in Table 1. The shifts in EQFL,OC and EQFL,SC toward higher potential were accompanied by a decrease in JSC as the concentration of TBP was increased. This trade-off between JSC and VOC occurred because the conduction band Fermi level of the TiO2 film was shifted to higher potential by TBP. The energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye and the TiO2 conduction band decreased, and the decrease resulted in a lower injection driving force and thus a decrease in JSC. The variation in the dependence of EQFL,OC on EQFL,SC with TBP concentration in cells containing 0.1 M Li+ or 0.1 M TBA+ is shown in Fig. 4. The relationship between EQFL,OC and EQFL,SC was linear in both cases:

 Fig. 4  Linear relationships between EQFL,OC (VOC) and EQFL,SC of cells containing Li+ and TBA+, respectively. EQFL,OC (VOC) = 0.25 + 1.02 EQFL,SC (R = 0.99) for cells containing 0.1 M Li+, and EQFL,OC (VOC) = 0.38 + 0.62 EQFL,SC (R = 0.99) for cells containing 0.1 M TBA+.

QFL,OC = 0.38 + 0.62 EQFL,SC, for cells containing 0.1 M TBA+,
while slopes of the lines are different, for the cells containing 0.1 M Li+, the slope was very close to 1, suggesting that the increases in EQFL,SC and EQFL,OC were similar and that the QFL increases were the same at short circuit and open circuit. For the cells containing 0.1 M TBA+, the slope was 0.62, implying that the QFL increase was larger at short circuit than at open circuit; this difference led to a larger decrease in JSC for the TBA+-containing cells than for the Li+-containing cells.
The difference in the shifts of EQFL,OC and EQFL,SC due to the presence of Li+ and TBA+ may be caused by the difference in the extent to which the cations adsorbed on the TiO2 surface at open circuit and short circuit. The adsorption of cations and TBP on the TiO2 surface is determined by the condition of the TiO2 surface and the properties of species in the electrolyte. For example, the different electron densities in the TiO2 film at open circuit and short circuit may influence the cations adsorption. We estimated the electron density under these two conditions according to a method described in the literature.23 It is found that the difference in electron density under these two conditions was huge. For example, in the cell containing 0.1 M Li+ and 0.3 M TBP, the electron density was as high as 1018 per cm3 at open circuit, whereas the highest electron density (at the electrolyte side of the TiO2 film) at short circuit was less than 1013 per cm3. This difference may greatly affect cation adsorption under the two conditions, which may explain why TBA+ ions partially adsorbed on the TiO2 surface at open circuit despite their large molecular size, whereas they did not adsorb at short circuit. On the other hand, the properties of species in an electrolyte are much more complex and need further studies. On the basis of their influence on the QFLs of the TiO2 films, we propose the following scheme for the relationship between adsorption of Li+ (TBA+) and TBP (Fig. 5). At short circuit, Li+ ions intercalated into or adsorbed on the TiO2 film, and the adsorbed Li+ ions did not affect TBP adsorption. In contrast, TBA+ ions could not adsorb on the TiO2 surface, because they were too large. At open circuit, some of the TBA+ ions could adsorb on the surface of the TiO2 film because of its high electron density, and the adsorbed TBA+ ions partially blocked further adsorption of TBP. The quantities of adsorbed cations to TiO2 are determined by the adsorption equilibriums, and they are still need to be further studied. It is worth noting that in most previous studies, the effects of additives were studied only at open circuit, and the difference between short-circuit and open-circuit conditions has not been well studied. This work provides the first quantitative information about the relationships of the effects of TBP and cations in the electrolyte on QFL shifts under both conditions. If we could develop suitable additives and cations, or combinations of the two, such that the QFL shift at open circuit was much larger than the shift at short circuit, the trade-off between JOC and VOC might be eliminated, and higher efficiency DSCs could be obtained.

Conclusions
We directly measured the effects of TBP on the QFLs of TiO2 films during J–V testing of DSCs in the presence of two different cations. We found for the first time that the relationship between the TBP-induced QFL shifts at short circuit and open circuit was linear and that the slopes of the lines were influenced by the nature of cations in the electrolyte. Different QFL shifts at short circuit and open circuit were observed in the presence of TBA+. The effects of adsorbed Li+ ions on the QFL values indicated that the ions did not impede adsorption of TBP under either open-circuit or short-circuit conditions. In contrast, adsorbed TBA+ ions at open circuit partially block further adsorption of TBP. These quantitative results will provide valuable information for controlling the Fermi level of TiO2 films for further optimization of the efficiency of DSCs.
