    , Accepted 14th February 2020First published on 17th February 2020AbstractCore engineering of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) is crucially important for enhancing device efficiency for nonfullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSCs). The most commonly used SMAs (e.g., ITIC) utilize indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the central core, which has restricted their absorption ranges due to the weak electron-donating ability and short conjugation length. Here, we fused two electron-rich units, namely cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTPR), into the cores for constructing low-bandgap SMAs. The resulting CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl molecules exhibit extended nonacyclic central cores and strengthened intramolecular transfer (ICT) effect, resulting in red-shifted absorption (up to ∼950 nm) and up-shifted HOMO levels compared with IDTT-4Cl. Consequently, the NF-OSCs based on PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl and PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl achieved higher PCEs of 12.15% and 10.75%, respectively, than those of the PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl ones (7.70%). Notably, high short-circuit current densities (JSC) of 23–25 mA cm−2 were obtained by the CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, indicating the great potential of the electron-donating CPDT and DTPR as promising building blocks to construct high-performance low-bandgap SMAs.
1. Introduction
The invention of novel organic semiconducting materials has propelled the field of organic photovoltaics and the development of light-weight, inexpensive, solution-processable and roll-to-roll compatible organic solar cells (OSCs). Extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of small molecular acceptor (SMA)-based OSCs, since SMAs possess advantages such as facile synthesis, tunable optical absorption and energy levels, and potentially good device stability.1–5 The best-performing SMAs typically feature the A–D–A structure, which consists of a multicyclic aromatic core as the electron-donating part and two terminal groups as the electron-withdrawing part.6–9 The manipulation of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing units can easily fine-tune the absorption spectra as well as energy levels of A–D–A-type SMAs. Although the most popular A–D–A-type SMAs based on indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), IT-4F or IT-4Cl, have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) surpassing 14%,10–13 the IDTT central core exhibits relatively short conjugated length and weak electron-donating ability, leading to limited absorption ranges of the resulting SMAs (generally with absorption onset of <850 nm).14–20
As a large portion of solar energy is distributed in the near-infrared (NIR) region, the development of SMAs with strong NIR photon response is of great importance to harvest the full potential of photons and further improve the short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCEs of non-fullerene OSCs. Moreover, NIR-absorbing SMAs are indispensable for the fabrication of efficient semi-transparent,21–23 tandem,24–27 or ternary OSC devices.28–31 Synthetic strategies have been recently proposed to construct NIR-absorbing SMAs with absorption onset beyond 900 nm, such as the introduction of oxygen or nitrogen atoms,23,32–36 extension of the conjugated systems,37,38 quinoid-resonance effects,39,40 and replacement of benzene with thieno[3,2]thiophene.21,41 In addition, there are a large amount of electron-donating building blocks that were originally used in the synthesis of low-bandgap materials for optoelectronic applications, which remain unexplored for constructing low-bandgap SMAs.42 Among these building blocks, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTPR), originally utilized for tandem OSC applications,43–45 feature strong electron-donating ability and relatively easy synthesis, and have the ability to extend the absorption range of SMAs to beyond 900 nm.46–48 In particular, the DTPR unit having one more oxygen atom compared with the CPDT one possesses even stronger electron-donating ability, which is reflected by the up-shifted HOMO levels as indicated by calculations (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms with additional alkyl chains of CPDT and DTPR prevent excessive intermolecular aggregation and thus render decent solubility of the resulting SMAs.

Herein, we demonstrate the fusion of CPDT and DTPR into the IDTT-like molecular backbone to yield two electron acceptors, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl (Fig. 1b), for OSC operations. Owing to the enhanced ICT effect and the extended nonacyclic central core, the resulting CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl exhibit dramatically red-shifted (up to ∼950 nm) and more intense absorption compared with IDTT-4Cl, as predicted by theoretical calculations. In addition, both the HOMO and LUMO levels of CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl are increased relative to IDTT-4Cl. In OSC devices consisting of PTB7-Th (Fig. 1c) as the donor polymer, the CPDT-4Cl-based cells show the highest PCE of 12.15% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.74 V, a JSC of 23.24 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.1%, which outperforms the IDTT-4Cl-based ones with the highest PCE of 7.70% with a VOC of 0.61 V, a JSC of 18.34 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.3%. Besides, the further extended absorption of DTPR-4Cl enables an even higher JSC of 24.97 mA cm−2, but an inferior FF of 61.8% leads to a moderate PCE of 10.75%. Morphology studies reveal that the PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl blend exhibits suitable phase separation relative to the other two systems, leading to suppressed charge recombination and thereby accounting for its superior device performances.
2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route to CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl is illustrated in Scheme 1, which is very similar to that of IDTT-4Cl. Starting from commercially available diethyl 2,5-dibromoterephthalate, the two central cores were readily prepared via a three-step procedure, i.e., palladium-catalyzed Stille or Suzuki cross-coupling, substitution by alkyl phenyl side chains, and acid-assisted Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization in decent yields. After the Vilsmeier–Haack reactions, the resulting dialdehyde compounds underwent Knoevenagel condensation with the end group, 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl) to yield the targeted SMAs, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl. Both molecules were unambiguously characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra, which are summarized in the ESI.† The thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss of IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl were determined to be 375, 383 and 353 °C, respectively, suggesting their good thermal stability (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Theoretical calculations were performed using density-functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31(d,p) basis set to investigate the effects of the core variations on the molecular geometries and electronic properties of IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl. The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups for simplification. As shown in Fig. 2, the optimized geometries of IDTT-4Cl and CPDT-4Cl are highly planar with very small S–C–C–S dihedral angles of <1° owing to the planar structure of TT and CPDT. In contrast, the non-planar nature of the six-member ring of DTPR (O–C–C–S dihedral angle of 13.0°) causes two changes in the molecular geometry of DTPR-4Cl. On the one hand, it is observed from the front view that the planarity of the DTPR-4Cl molecule is not as high as the other two, which may reduce the tendency of intermolecular π–π stacking. It is also demonstrated in previous literature that after the introduction of the oxygen atom, it endows better solubility for the DTPR-based polymers than the CPDT-based ones.43 On the other hand, from the top view DTPR-4Cl shows a wavier backbone with an angle of 66.7° between the core and the end groups than IDTT-4Cl (49.8°) and CPDT-4Cl (53.6°). Regarding the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), the HOMO levels are gradually upshifted from −5.65 to −5.33 and to −5.29 eV for IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl, respectively, which is consistent with the trend of the upshifted HOMO levels of the corresponding building blocks (Fig. 1a). Further theoretical calculations using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) were conducted to compare the optical absorption of the three SMAs shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). The main absorption peaks are located at 667, 726 and 772 nm for IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl, respectively, which corresponds to the HOMO–LUMO excitation. The red-shifted absorption of CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl is attributed to the stronger ICT effects, which is supported by the larger dipole moments (Fig. S2b, ESI†) between the core and the end groups of CPDT-4Cl (12.19 D) and DTPR-4Cl (12.99 D) than that of IDTT-4Cl (9.66 D).

To verify the calculation results, the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of three SMAs were recorded in their solution and thin-film state. In diluted chloroform solution (1.0 × 10−6 M), while IDTT-4Cl shows an absorption peak (λmax) centered at 702 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of 2.52 × 105 M−1 cm−1, dramatically red-shifted absorption peaks together with higher εmax are observed for both CPDT-4Cl (λmax = 804 nm, εmax = 3.36 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and DTPR-4Cl (λmax = 833 nm, εmax = 3.00 × 105 M−1 cm−1), which is in agreement with the TDDFT calculation results. Similarly, in the thin-film state, the absorption onsets are extended from 832 nm for IDTT-4Cl to 919 nm for CPDT-4Cl, and to 950 nm for DTPR-4Cl. As a result, the optical bandgaps (Eg) of CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl are determined to be 1.35 and 1.30 eV, respectively, which are greatly reduced compared with IDTT-4Cl (1.49 eV). The smaller Eg of CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl can be attributed to two factors: the electron-rich cores and extended conjugation lengths. While IDTT-4Cl has a large part of overlapped absorption to the donor polymer PTB7-Th, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl can form more complementary absorption in the blends (Fig. S3, ESI†). As the photons in the NIR region can be effectively harvested by CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl, the JSC values of the devices are expected to improve. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of three SMAs in the thin-film state (Fig. 3c). The HOMO and LUMO levels were extracted from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of the CV curves with ferrocene/ferrocenium as the external standard, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3d and Table 1. Both CPDT-4Cl (HOMO/LUMO = −5.32/−3.78 eV) and DTPR-4Cl (HOMO/LUMO = −5.35/−3.85 eV) have upshifted energy levels relative to IDTT-4Cl (HOMO/LUMO = −5.49/−3.91 eV), which is consistent with the calculated values shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, when combined with PTB7-Th, the devices based on CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl should benefit from higher VOC.

To compare the photovoltaic performances of the three SMAs, inverted OSC devices with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al were fabricated. The well-known PTB7-Th was selected as the donor polymer due to its high-lying HOMO level that ensured efficient hole transfer from the SMAs. The details of device fabrication and optimization are summarized in the ESI,† and the device data are collected in Table 2. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the optimal PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl devices exhibited an average PCE of 7.16% with a low VOC of 0.61 V, a JSC of 18.34 mA cm−2 and a moderate FF of 64.3%. Surprisingly, the optimal PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl devices showed a much higher PCE of 12.15% with simultaneously improved VOC of 0.74 V, JSC of 23.24 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.1%. The 0.13 V higher VOC of the PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl devices can be attributed to the up-shifted energy levels of CPDT-4Cl relative to IDTT-4Cl, as discussed in the electrochemical part. In addition, the stronger absorption as well as broadened absorption range of CPDT-4Cl can explain the better JSC of the devices. However, although the even more red-shifted absorption of DTPR-4Cl compared to CPDT-4Cl resulted in a higher JSC of 24.97 mA cm−2, an FF of 61.8% and a slightly lower VOC of 0.68 V yielded only a moderate PCE of 10.75%.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three devices are presented in Fig. 4b. The PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl device showed a photon response in the range of 300–800 nm with the peak EQE of 76% at 580 nm. Both CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices exhibited dramatically broadened response range to beyond 900 nm, which is consistent with their corresponding absorption range. Moreover, the PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl and the PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl devices showed higher EQE values of 79% at 590 nm and 77% at 740 nm, respectively. The integrated JSC values from the EQE curves were calculated to be 17.97, 22.67 and 24.80 mA cm−2 for IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with the values from the J–V curves. As a result, the broader photon response range together with the higher EQE values can well explain the improvement of the JSC of the CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices. Furthermore, the plots of photocurrent (Jph, defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) versus effective voltage (Veff, defined as V − V0, where V is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0) of the three devices are shown in Fig. 4d. All three devices reached their saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) at Veff of >2 V, suggesting that all excitons were dissociated and free charge carriers were completely collected by the electrodes. Besides, the charge dissociation probability (Pdiss, defined as JSC/Jsat) was determined to be 97%, 99% and 99% for the IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, respectively. The high Pdiss values are also supported by the high photoluminescence quenching efficiencies of the three blends (94%, 93% and 98% for the IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, respectively) relative to the pristine PTB7-Th film excited at 633 nm, implying the efficient charge dissociation process (Fig. S4, ESI†).
To gain more insights into the origins of the improved photovoltaic performances of the CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, we conducted light-intensity dependent experiments to investigate the charge dissociation and recombination processes. Fig. 4e presents the relationship between JSC and light intensity described as JSC ∝ Pα, where α is equal to unity when all separated charge carriers are efficiently collected by the corresponding electrodes without recombination. The slopes α were fitted to be 0.918, 0.945 and 0.928 for the IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, respectively. The largest α of the CPDT-4Cl-based device suggests suppressed bimolecular recombination, which accounts for its FF of ∼70%. In addition, the light-intensity-dependent VOC plots of the three devices are also illustrated in Fig. 4f. A stronger light-intensity dependence of VOC with a slope of larger than kT q−1 can be found (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge), if more monomolecular recombination occurs, either from the trap-assisted SRH or the geminate recombination. The slopes extracted from the plots are 1.38 kT q−1,1.08 kT q−1 and 1.01 kT q−1 for the IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices, respectively. Therefore, both light-intensity-dependent JSC and VOC experiments suggest efficiently suppressed recombination for the CPDT-4Cl-based device.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to obtain the detailed information of molecular packing induced by the introduction of the CPDT and DTPR units into the molecular backbone. The two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns of the three blend films are shown in Fig. 5a–c, and the 1D profiles are plotted in Fig. 5d. The PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl film exhibits a number of sharp and pronounced lamellar and π–π stacking peaks, which should be attributed to the high crystallinity of IDTT-4Cl. The π–π stacking peak locates at q = 1.85 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance (d010) of 3.39 Å and a coherence length (CL010) of 37.8 Å for IDTT-4Cl. In sharp contrast, the CPDT-4Cl-based blend exhibits a lamellar stacking peak located at q ≈ 0.26 Å−1 in the in-plane direction and a broad π–π peak located at q ≈ 1.70 Å−1 (d010 = 3.69 Å and CL010 = 13.4 Å). Similar to CPDT-4Cl, a broad π–π peak can be observed at q ≈ 1.71 Å−1 for DTPR-4Cl-based devices, which is associated with a d010 of 3.67 Å and a CL010 of 13.2 Å. The reduction in crystallinity of CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl can be attributed to the extra propyl chains attached to the molecular backbone, which hinder the excessive intermolecular stacking of end groups and render better solubility of the SMAs with extended conjugation length. Several recent reports also demonstrated that lowering the degree of crystallization for certain highly crystalline SMAs with similar chemical structures to CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl helps to achieve better morphological compatibility with the donor polymers.49–51

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements were conducted to investigate the phase separation between PTB7-Th and three SMAs. The Lorentz-corrected RSoXS profiles of the three blend films acquired at 283.4 eV are illustrated in Fig. 6. It can be observed that the RSoXS profile of the PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl blend shifts towards a lower q relative to the PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl, and PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl ones. The long period of the blend films is extracted to be 53.9, 55.9 and 72.2 nm for PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl, PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl and PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl, respectively (Table 3). In addition, although CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl show less crystallinity than IDTT-4Cl, they can still achieve comparable root-mean-square composition variation (representing the average phase purity) when blending with PTB7-Th. The difference in phase separation of the blend films is more discernible from their atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the phase separation of the PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl blend is significantly larger than those of the other two blends, which is in agreement with the RSoXS results above. The surface roughness with root-mean-square (RMS) values are derived to be 1.69, 2.75 and 4.55 nm for PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl, PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl and PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl, respectively. Therefore, the relatively low FF of the PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl devices can be attributed to the rough surface morphology as well as the excessively large phase separation.

To better understand the morphological compatibility between PTB7-Th and the three SMAs, contact angle measurements were performed based on the two-solvent method.
The surface tensions (γ) of the smooth pristine films of PTB7-Th, IDTT-4Cl, CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl were determined by the Owens-Wendt geometric mean equation utilizing water and ethylene glycol (EG) as solvents (Fig. S6, ESI†). The results are collected in Table S1 (ESI†) and the calculation details are summarized in the ESI.†52 Then, the Flory–Huggins parameters χ were calculated to be 0.83, 0.95 and 1.02 for the PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl, PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl and PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl pair, respectively. The trend in the χ values between PTB7-Th and the three SMAs is well consistent with that in the RSoXS and AFM measurement, as a larger χ value would induce stronger phase separation and larger domain sizes. The largest χ between PTB7-Th and DTPR-4Cl results in excessively large domains, while the moderate χ between PTB7-Th and CPDT-4Cl leads to suitable miscibility and phase separation.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, two low-bandgap SMAs named CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl with absorption onset of beyond 900 nm were constructed by incorporating strong electron-donating building blocks (CPDT and DTPR) into the molecular backbones. Compared with IDTT-4Cl, the enhanced ICT effects of CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl led to dramatically red-shifted absorption and up-shifted HOMO levels, as evidenced by theoretical calculations as well as optical and electrochemical measurements. When blending with PTB7-Th as the donor, the CPDT-4Cl and DTPR-4Cl-based devices showed improved JSC of 23.24 and 24.97 mA cm−2, respectively, owing to their extended absorption range relative to the IDTT-4Cl ones. In addition, the PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl blend exhibited suitable phase separation as demonstrated by the AFM and surface tension experiments, resulting in suppressed charge recombination and a high FF of ∼70%. Consequently, a high PCE of 12.15% was achieved by the PTB7-Th:CPDT-4Cl device, which outperformed that of the PTB7-Th:IDTT-4Cl one (7.70%). Although the PTB7-Th:DTPR-4Cl device yielded only a moderate PCE of 10.75%, the most red-shifted absorption of DTPR-4Cl still demonstrates the potential applications of the DTPR building block in the design of low-bandgap SMAs. Overall, this work highlights the great potential of the electron-donating CPDT and DTPR units as promising building blocks to construct high-performance low-bandgap SMAs.
