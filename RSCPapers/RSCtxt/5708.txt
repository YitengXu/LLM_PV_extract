Herein, wettability measurements with selected solutions reveal that passivation is crucial to suppress hydrogen bonds for hydrophobic perovskite surfaces, advocating a novel strategy to render perovskite hydrophobic efficiently.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention since their relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 10% was demonstrated in 2012.1 Thus far, PSCs have been developed, especially on the perovskite layer, through various methods such as deposition,2–4 composition manipulation4–7 and passivation of perovskite layers.7–12 Owing to the combination of these techniques, PCEs of over 25% are now achievable.7 Among the techniques, perovskite passivation is a relatively new method, and it has been developed by various passivator materials,7–12 which are mainly divided into aliphatic-8 or phenyl-ammonium halides.9,10 The passivation is notably effective in imparting hydrophobicity to the perovskite surface and enhancing open circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cell due to a decreased recombination through an interfacing between the perovskite and a contact layer (e.g., hole transport material (HTM)). Indeed, for a recently reported cell that exhibited a PCE of over 25%, passivation with aliphatic ammonium salt (i.e., n-octyl ammonium iodide: OAI in Fig. 1a) over formamidinium-lead-halide (FAPbI3), perovskite played a crucial role in achieving the desired performance.7 Therefore, passivation has been vital for cutting-edge PSCs, and the resulting highly efficient PSCs are anticipated to meet the high demands of utilizing renewable energies. Hence, PSCs are now considered to be broadly manufactured at an industrial level.

(d) Images after dropping 100 μL HTM solution onto 15 × 15 mm perovskite layer with or without passivation using PEAI or OAI. 
In terms of industrialization, PSCs are advantageous for their scalability owing to their printable nature. Perovskite cells are composed of plural layers, and the standard configuration is as follows: transparent conductor/electron transport material/perovskite/HTM/metal conductor (Fig. 1b; e.g., FTO/TiO2/perovskite/SpiroOMeTAD/Au). These layers can mostly be deposited by the coating and subsequent drying of the respective precursor solutions (e.g., Fig. 1c). Hence, for ensuring feasibility of the scalable wet process, it is crucial to achieve high wettability of the precursor solutions over the layers to be coated (see ESI† for more details). However, surface properties of the perovskite layer after passivation have remained elusive.
Although the resulting hydrophobic perovskite is currently attributable to the presence of non-polar alkyl moiety over the perovskite surface, other factors likely involved in enhancing the hydrophobicity have seldom been discussed. One clue for the presence of other factors is the wettability for the HTM solution. We found that the wettability of HTM solution over perovskite (after the process Fig. 1c) can be modified by passivation treatment (Fig. 1d). HTM solution can spontaneously spread over the perovskite layer with and without (pristine; Fig. 1d left) passivation using phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI; Fig. 1d center), which is a typical phenyl-type passivator. In contrast, the same solution did not spread spontaneously over the layer passivated by OAI treatment (Fig. 1d right). (More details can be found in ESI,† Fig. S1.) As explaining this phenomenon with existing knowledge is difficult, this difference indicates that the passivated perovskite surfaces still possess some unveiled properties particularly relevant to wettability. Hence, to obtain a certain passivation strategy for both hydrophobic and scalable perovskite layers, a systematic wettability study to reveal the surface properties of the passivated perovskite is desirable.
According to the Fowkes method,13 the surface tension (γ), which is related to the wettability, can be divided into non-polar dispersion force (γa) and polar terms. Additionally, the polar term can be divided into dipole force (γb) and hydrogen bond force (γc).12 Thus, as described in eqn (1), the surface tension can be divided into γa, γb and γc. γ = γa + γb + γc(1)The slight polarity of alkyl moiety in passivator materials is expected to mainly affect γa, whereas the other two parameters (γb and γc) are still unclear. As represented by the development of polymer surfaces after the Fowkes report,13 understanding parameters γb and γc will help control the surface properties. Therefore, investigation of the divided γa,b,c of perovskite surfaces will provide further knowledge of passivation effects and strategies for developing PSCs.
In the present work, to reveal the effects of passivation treatments on the perovskite surface of non-polar, dipole and hydrogen bond properties, the wettability of solutions, which were selected in terms of γa,b,c, over the perovskite layer were measured, and the importance of factors other than γa was elucidated; suppressing hydrogen bonds over perovskite surfaces is instrumental for hydrophobic perovskite layers, and controlling the surface dipole is important for the high wettability of HTM solutions.
For the experiments in this work, FAPbI3 PSCs and thin film samples for wettability measurements were prepared using previously reported methods with minor modifications (see ESI† for details). Two passivator materials, OAI7,8 and PEAI,9,10 were chosen as the representatives of aliphatic- and phenyl-ammonium salts, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 2a (backward scan), passivation over the perovskite layer using OAI or PEAI effectively improved Voc from 1.01 to 1.05 V (forward scan: Fig. S2, more detailed analysis of the PSC performances can be found in ESI†). Fig. 2b depicts the contact angles (CAs) of water to the perovskite layer. Both OAI and PEAI passivation resulted in larger CA (from 56.8 ± 1.1° to 70.2 ± 1.8° or 77.4 ± 1.3°, respectively) between water and the perovskite surfaces, indicating that both passivations rendered perovskite surfaces hydrophobic. In addition, the suppressing defect in perovskite made the photoluminescence lifetime of the perovskite layer longer. (Fig. S4 and Table S4, ESI†) Hence, these observations are consistent with those reported previously,7–9 indicating that the passivation treatments employed in this study were typical.

Meanwhile, Fig. 2c shows the CAs of chlorobenzene (CB), the most common solvent for an HTM solution and was used for the solvent in Fig. 1d, over perovskite layers with or without passivation treatments. The pristine perovskite layer possessed high wettability for CB (CA: < 5°). However, although both OAI- and PEAI-treated perovskite layers were hydrophobic (Fig. 2b), the CA of CB over these passivated perovskite layers were drastically different; the CB solution was highly wettable for the PEAI-treated perovskite layer (CA: < 5°), but less wettable for OAI-treated sample (CA: 27.3 ± 1.9°). Therefore, this slightly wettable feature of CB over the OAI-treated sample led to the phenomenon observed in Fig. 1d. This result also indicates that the proper selection of passivator materials retains the high wettability of the HTM solution and improves solar cell performance. To understand the unveiled surface properties of the perovskite layer, including the wettability of the HTM solution, the wettability of the solutions selected by γa,b,c natures for the perovskite layers were investigated hereafter.
In principle, the CA is determined using Yang's law: γS = γL cosθ + γSL(2)where γS, γL and γSL are the surface tension of the solid, liquid and solid-liquid interface, respectively; and θ is the CA between the solid and liquid. The adhesive work (WA) can be described via Dupre's law: WA = γS + γL − γSL(3)According to the extended Fowkes equation, WA can be described as follows:11 WA = 2 ((γaSγaL)1/2 + (γbSγbL)1/2 + (γcSγcL)1/2)(4)Moreover, by combining eqn (1–5) was obtained: γL (1 + cosθ) = 2 ((γaSγaL)1/2 + (γbSγbL)1/2 + (γcSγcL)1/2)(5)Using eqn (5), the three parameters (γaS, γbS and γcS) for solid surface tension can be estimated through CA measurement using three types of liquids classified as follows: (i) non-polar; γL = γaL, (ii) polar without hydrogen bonding; γL = γaL + γbL, and (iii) polar with hydrogen bonds; γL = γaL + γbL + γcL. Herein, n-hexadecane, tetrabromoethane and water were chosen as liquid types (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively.14,15 Each parameter of the liquids is listed in Table 1.14–16

Table 2 exhibits the CAs obtained from using each liquid. Table 3 shows the estimated γaS, γbS and γcS values of the perovskite surface with and without the passivation treatments. The CA of n-hexadecane, a simple alkane, resulted in similar values between the pristine surface (8.0 ± 0.5°) and PEAI-treated surface (7.5 ± 0.4°), while the OAI-treated surface exhibited a larger CA (22.4 ± 2.8°). Considering the surface tension of n-hexadecane (27.6 N cm−2) and eqn (5), the γaS of pristine, OAI-treated and PEAI-treated perovskite surfaces were estimated to be 27.3 ± 0.1, 27.3 ± 0.1 and 25.5 ± 0.5 N cm−2, respectively. The lowest γaS of the OAI-treated surface in the series of samples is most likely attributed to a low dispersion force of the aliphatic moiety in the OAI compared to that of phenyl in PEAI. Consequently, the passivation treatments led to a slight change in γaS, indicating that γbS and/or γcS primarily influence the perovskite surface properties.

The γbS values were also obtained using tetrabromoethane, which were calculated to be 45.6 ± 1.0, 36.6 ± 1.1 and 3.0 ± 1.8 N cm−2 for the pristine, PEAI-treated and OAI-treated perovskite surfaces, respectively (Table 3). This result indicated that the OAI treatment significantly decreased the dipole of the perovskite surface, while the PEAI treatment did not. The minute change in γbS after PEAI passivation was possibly due to the interaction between the permanent dipole of the tetrabromoethane and the induced dipole of the phenyl moiety in PEAI introduced over the perovskite surface. This significant decrease in γbSvia the OAI treatment most likely resulted in the relatively low wettability of the HTM solution (Fig. 1d) because CB is a type (ii) liquid (γaL = 32.1 N cm−1, γbL = 1.5 N cm−1);17 hence, the drop in γbS of the perovskite surface considerably reduces the WA between CB and the perovskite surface (Table S5, ESI†). Furthermore, practical HTM solutions generally contain dopants possessing strong polarities (e.g., Li-TFSI). Hence, the practical HTM solution has γbS higher than that of pristine CB; thus, a decrease in polarity of the perovskite surface via the passivation treatment reduces the practical HTM solution wettability to a greater degree than that of pure CB, as demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Consequently, a passivation treatment that decreases the dipole of the perovskite surface (γbS) can reduce the wettability of the HTM solution (Fig. 1d). This may hinder the large-scale fabrication of PSCs if the practical production process requires a high dispersibility of the HTM solution over perovskite. To address this, two strategies are discussed here: (1) developing a passivator material that retains the dipole of the perovskite surface (γbS), such as PEAI, and (2) using a solvent other than CB. The permanent dipole corresponding to γbS of CB causes the wettability issue; hence, other solvents that possess negligible γbL will be prominent candidates in terms of wettability.
The present results provide insights into scalable PSCs and importantly elucidate the passivation effect on the resulting hydrophobicity of the perovskite layers with the γcS values: a parameter regarding hydrogen bonds. The γcS values were obtained from the CA values for water and the calculated γa,bS values. The γcS values of pristine, PEAI- and OAI-treated perovskite surfaces were calculated to be 10.4 ± 0.5, 4.7 ± 0.7 and 5.4 ± 0.6 N cm−2, respectively (Table 3). Thus, both passivation treatments approximately halved the γcS values. This reduction was likely because the passivation eliminated hydrogen-bond-relevant defects and/or replaced the FA cations, which have active hydrogen-nitrogen bonds (H–N), with passivator ammonium cations so that water cannot physically access the H–N bonds.
To date, several CA measurements with water over perovskite have been conducted to show the effect of passivation treatments on hydrophobicity. It is considered that the resulting hydrophobicity after passivation is attributed to the slight polarity of the alkyl moiety in passivator materials (e.g., octyl moiety in OAI) remaining above the perovskite surface, thereby leading to a decrease in its γaS. However, the present results indicate another mechanism. The changing range of the non-polar term in WA (2 (γaSγaL)1/2 in eqn (4)) is not large, even in the presence of a non-polar moiety over the perovskite surface (Table 4) because the feasible difference in γa with the changing materials is relatively small (e.g., the difference between pristine and OAI-passivated: 27.3 ± 0.1 and 25.5 ± 0.5 N cm−1). Moreover, γaL (29.1 N cm−1) of water is lower than its γcL (42.4 N cm−1). Owing to high γcS of water, hydrogen bond suppression, which is barely attainable by alkyl moieties in passivator materials, likely has the most significant effect on the passivated perovskite surface hydrophobicity (eqn (5)). This is in line with the fact that the hydrogen bond is one of the strongest forces of water when regarding affinity. Indeed, for the estimated value in this work, a decrease in the polar term γc, especially concerning hydrogen bonding, significantly contributes to a decrease in WA (2(γaSγaL)1/2 from 42.4 N/cm to 28.6 or 31.6 N cm−1; Table 4).

Accordingly, the development of hydrogen bond suppressors, such as passivator materials capable of suppressing hydrogen bonds, would be an effective strategy to improve hydrophobicity, which may not be achievable by only introducing a non-polar moiety over the perovskite surface. In fact, a previously reported passivator material with a C–F bond interacting with an N–H bond in methyl ammonium (MA) in perovskite resulted in a considerably high CA for water (> 100°),11 supporting the proposed effect in this work. However, this previous report does not discuss the contribution of hydrogen bond suppression to hydrophobicity.11 Therefore, the novel insights obtained herein will help to develop techniques for a viable and highly hydrophobic perovskite layer.
Conclusion
The wettability of three types of selected solutions, which were (i) non-polar (γa), (ii) polar without hydrogen bonding (γb), and (iii) polar with hydrogen bonds (γc), over a perovskite surface with or without passivation was investigated to obtain certain strategies of effective passivation treatment for scalable and feasible hydrophobic perovskite photoabsorber layers.
It was revealed that the passivation treatment with OAI can reduce the wettability of the HTM solution over the passivated perovskite surface owing to the significant decrease in the dipole of the perovskite surface (γbS). Hence, if the low wettability of the HTM solution becomes a significant issue for the industrial fabrication of solar cells, passivation with different types of materials, such as phenyl-type ammonium iodide and/or using solvents without a permanent dipole, can help to overcome this problem.
Furthermore, the suppression of hydrogen bonds (i.e., the decrease in γcS) plays a pivotal role in rendering the perovskite surface hydrophobic via passivation, particularly for perovskites consisting of organic-ammonium-cation-based A site (e.g., MA and FA). This provokes a novel strategy for the fabrication of a hydrophobic perovskite layer encompassed with ‘hydrogen bond suppressors’, such as fluorinated carbon moieties that can be incorporated with perovskite18,19 and are designed for this function. However, this finding differs from the current school of thought: the slight polarity of the alkyl moiety (γaS) in the passivator material being over the perovskite surface is the predominant factor for the resulting hydrophobicity.
Therefore, the insights obtained herein provide certain strategies regarding passivator materials to render perovskite layers hydrophobic and prompt further research on hydrogen bond suppressors, which will lead to the development of PSCs.
