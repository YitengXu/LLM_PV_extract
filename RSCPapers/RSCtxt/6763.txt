    , Accepted 28th September 2015First published on 29th September 2015AbstractIn this study, a novel three dimensional (3D) ZnO/Cu2O nanowire (NW) photocathode material with highly efficient photoelectrocatalytic performance was prepared on a copper substrate using simple, cost-effective wet chemical oxidation and hydrothermal growth methods. FE-SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS were used to investigate the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs, revealing the formation of the high density orientated Cu2O NW cores and ZnO NW shells. Compared with the pure Cu2O NWs, the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs showed a larger photocurrent (−4.55 mA cm−2) and better stability under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). In light of the high effective surface area and the ability to facilitate good electron transportation, this unique nanostructure will be favorable for efficient photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting and organic pollutant degradation.
1. Introduction
The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) technique has attracted much attention in past years because it provides a great insight into the utilization of solar energy for producing hydrogen, degrading organic pollutants, or even generating electricity.1–5
The PEC system is usually established using a semiconductor based photoanode or photocathode, where the oxidation reaction or reduction reaction occurs during a photoelectrocatalytic process.6–8 Apparently, the photoelectrode is crucial to the conversion efficiency of solar energy and suitable photoelectrode materials are therefore of deep concern for many researchers pursuing high performance. Over the years, tremendous amounts of literature have reported various photoanode materials, such as n-type semiconductors (TiO2, BiVO4, WO3, Fe2O3, ZnO, CdS, etc.) and their composites.9–15 However, relatively much less concern was given to the p-type photocathode material for PEC applications.
Recently, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has been a promising photocathode material because it is a natural p-type material, with a direct bandgap of 2 eV and a corresponding theoretical light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 18%.16,17 Moreover, Cu2O is also abundant in nature and environmentally benign. Due to a low conduction band potential (−0.7 V vs. RHE), Cu2O is an excellent candidate for water reduction. Grätzel's group reported a bulk Cu2O film on FTO glass and after passivation of the Cu2O surface the obtained electrode showed a remarkable efficiency in PEC water splitting.17–20 Moreover, even Cu2O nanowires (NWs) grown directly from a Cu substrate give advantages over bulk Cu2O, such as a large surface area, lower carrier recombination loss, decoupling directions of light absorption and charge-carrier collection.21–23
However, the severe drawback for Cu2O is its low stability in aqueous solutions because the redox potentials of Cu2O lie within the bandgap, which limits the use of Cu2O as a photocathode for PEC systems.24–26 In this case, the Cu2O can be reduced to Cu, leading to a significant loss in photoactivity. An ideal solution is to find a material that not only matches Cu2O in energy level but also passivates Cu2O to be free from the electrolyte. For this purpose, a ZnO nanowire (NW) is proposed as it possesses the following attributes. First, it is an n-type semiconductor with a conduction band above the water reduction potential while it maintains the band bending in Cu2O. Second, the electron diffusivity (Dn) in a single ZnO NW (0.05–0.5 cm2 s−1) is several hundred times larger than the highest diffusivity reported for TiO2 or ZnO NP films.27–29 When coupling ZnO NWs with Cu2O NWs, 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs could be formed. In the special nanostructure, the ZnO NWs that fully wrap the inner Cu2O NW not only act as the outer protection shell but also provide a much larger surface area and efficient photogenerated electron–hole pair separation.
In this paper, a facile route for the large-scale fabrication of a 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW photocathode material with highly efficient PEC performance is proposed using an all-solution processing method for the first time. The morphology, compositions and crystalline phases of the ZnO/Cu2O NW photoanodes were well characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray power diffraction analyses and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Finally, the photoelectrochemical performances were investigated and compared under simulated solar light illumination.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Analytical-grade NaOH (≥98%), ammonium persulfate (≥99%), zinc acetate (≥99%), ethanol (≥99%), zinc nitrate hydrate (≥99%) and potassium persulfate (≥99%) were obtained from the Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company. Hexamethylenetetramine (≥99%) was obtained from the Aladdin Industrial Corporation. All chemicals were used without further purification. All solutions were prepared with doubly distilled deionized water.
2.2 Synthesis of 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs
The synthesis of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs was performed by following these procedures: first, the nanosheet-arrayed Cu(OH)2/Cu was prepared by immersing a thin copper sheet into an aqueous solution containing 2.5 M NaOH and 0.125 M (NH4)2S2O8 for 10 min (wet chemical method) followed by a rinsing and drying process.30 Second, a zinc acetate layer was formed on the Cu(OH)2 nanosheet by 10–20 iterations of spin-casting of a 5 mM zinc acetate solution in ethanol. The spinning speed is controlled at 800 to 1500 rpm. Subsequently, the as-prepared sample was annealed in N2 gas at 500 °C for 4 hours, forming ZnO seeds/Cu2O nanowires. Third, the ZnO/Cu2O NW growth was carried out by suspending the seeded Cu2O nanowires in a vertical manner in a container filled with an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hydrate (0.025 M) and hexamethylenetetramine (0.025 M) at 90 °C. It took 2 hours for the NWs to grow to the desired length. Then, the ZnO/Cu2O NWs were removed from the solution, rinsed with DI water, and baked in air at 100 °C for 4 hours. At last, epoxy resin was applied to cover the edge of the samples and a 1 cm2 area was exposed for the photoelectrochemical test.
2.3 Structure characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) (Philips, Netherlands, Sirion200). The crystal phase of the samples was characterized with X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (Bruker, Germany, AXS-8 Advance). The elements present in the electrode were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG icrolab 310F, Al Kα radiation). Optical absorption measurements were carried out in a Lambda 750 UV-Vis-IR spectrophotometer using an integrating sphere.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements and applications were conducted in a three-electrode PEC cell, with the photoelectrode (Cu2O NWs or ZnO/Cu2O NWs) as the working electrode (with an area of 1 cm2), Pt foil as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. An electrochemical workstation (CHI 660c, CH Instruments Inc., USA) was used for the current density measurements. Potentials were reported versus RHE using V versus RHE (volts) = V versus Ag/AgCI (volts) + [0.059 (volts) × PH] + 0.1976 (volts). The linear sweep voltammetry (J–V plots) was measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under illumination from an external solar simulator with an AM1.5 filter (with a radiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2). Photocurrent stability tests were carried out by measuring the photocurrent produced under chopped light irradiation (light/dark cycles of 20 s) at a fixed electrode potential of 0 V versus RHE. A mild agitation was applied during the photoelectrochemical tests and the electrolyte was purged with N2 gas for at least 5 min before the start of each photoelectrochemical test.
Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPs) was carried out using an electrochemical workstation (ZENNIUM, ZAHNER-elektrik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) equipped with a controlled-intensity-modulated-photospectroscopy setup (CIMPS, PP211, ZAHNER-elektrik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) following a two-electrode configuration. A white light lamp (WLC02, ZAHNER-elektrik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) was used as the light source. The modulated light in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 KHz superimposed on a steady dc light with an intensity of 60 mW cm−2 was applied.
3. Results and discussion
The main procedure for fabricating 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW photoelectrodes can be divided into four steps. First, high density and straight Cu(OH)2 nanosheets were obtained by wet chemical oxidation (eqn (1)) which accounts for the Cu(OH)2 nanosheet growth (Scheme 1(1)).30 Second, Zn(AC)2 was deposited onto the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets by a spin coating method (Scheme 1(2)). Third, calcination was applied to transform Cu(OH)2 and Zn(AC)2 into Cu2O NWs and ZnO nanoparticles simultaneously (Scheme 1(3)). The transformations are represented by eqn (2)–(4) which indicate the oxidation reactions. Unlike ZnO, the formation of Cu2O underwent two phase changes: Cu(OH)2 was first oxidized into CuO at a low annealing temperature (120 °C) and then CuO was reduced into Cu2O at a high annealing temperature (500 °C) due to the Cu diffusion from the Cu substrate, which serves as a reductant. The 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs were finally synthesized through the growth of ZnO NWs using a hydrothermal method (Scheme 1(4)).31 Cu + 4NaOH + (NH4)2S2O8 → Cu(OH)2 + 2Na2SO4 + 2NH3↑ + 2H2O(1) Cu(OH)2 → CuO + H2O(2) Cu + CuO → Cu2O(3) Zn(AC)2 → ZnO + CO2(4)

Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the samples at different stages. It can be seen that the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets were straight with sharp tips and some of them showed flat structures with some nanosheets bundled together (Fig. 1a). The higher magnification image reveals that the nanosheets were 10 to 20 μm in length and ∼300 nm in diameter (Fig. 1b). Compared to the smooth Cu(OH)2 nanosheets, the transformed Cu2O NWs had a pod-like nanostructure, while they still remained similar in length and diameter (Fig. 1c and d). After growing the ZnO NWs on Cu2O NWs, the high-density, thinner and shorter ZnO NWs completely wrap the inner Cu2O NWs, forming a 3D nanostructure (Fig. 1e and f). Fig. 2 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of a piece of Cu2O NW and 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, a pod-like structure is clearly observed for the pure Cu2O NWs. Accordingly, a large number of ZnO NW branches which totally wrap the inner Cu2O NWs can be observed in Fig. 2b. The ZnO NWs were ∼500 nm in length and ∼50 nm in diameter. Photos of the electrodes with different morphology are also shown in Fig. S1.† The color of the electrodes changed from blue to red and then to orange with successive formation of the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets, Cu2O NWs and 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs, respectively.

The formation of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs is dependent on some key parameters. For example, an annealing temperature of 500 °C is the best for transforming the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets to Cu2O NWs. A higher annealing temperature (such as 700 °C) would lead to the collapse of the Cu2O NWs, resulting in a flat structure (Fig. S2†). On the other hand, the growth of the ZnO NWs is directly affected by the deposition of Zn(AC)2 onto the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs using different spinning speeds and numbers of cycles. In Fig. 3a and b, the ZnO NWs were mainly grown in the space between Cu2O NWs when applying a low spinning speed of 800 rpm with 10 cycles. This can be attributed to the poor adhesion of the Zn(AC)2 molecules on the surface of the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets without a high centrifugal force. A higher spinning speed of 1500 rpm is able to enhance the centrifugal force and uniformly deposit Zn(AC)2 onto the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets. Fig. 3c and d show that the ZnO NWs were uniformly grown on the surface of the Cu2O NWs using a spinning speed of 1500 rpm with 10 cycles. However, the density of the ZnO NWs was so low that the Cu2O NWs underneath were still exposed. By increasing the number of cycles from 10 to 25 the amount of Zn(AC)2 could be further increased so as to guarantee a dense layer on the Cu(OH)2 nanosheets. Under these conditions, the high density ZnO NWs can be finally prepared after calcination and hydrothermal growth, as shown in Fig. 3e and f.

The elemental composition of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs was analysed and the characteristic elements were identified using an EDX detection spectrometer. As shown in Fig. S3,† only Cu, Zn, and O elements were found in the sample. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples are also shown in Fig. 4a to investigate their crystal phase. For the wet chemical oxidation treated copper sheet, all the diffraction peaks, except those arising from the copper substrate (marked with a triangle), can be indexed to the orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 phase (black line).32 Compared with the powder XRD pattern (JCPDS card file 13-0420), these peaks were significantly enhanced, indicating that the nanowire crystals were on average roughly perpendicular to the copper substrate with a wide distribution of tilts. After further calcination, the Cu(OH)2 phase disappeared and the new peaks appeared at 29.3°, 36.1° and 42°, indicating the complete transformation of Cu(OH)2 into Cu2O (red line). When depositing Zn(AC)2 onto the Cu(OH)2 NWs and processing a calcination and hydrothermal growth, the as-prepared sample showed additional peaks at (100) and (0002) which were attributed to the ZnO NWs (blue line).33

XPS measurements were performed to further investigate the chemical composition and oxidation state of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs (Fig. 4b). The full survey indicated the presence of Zn, Cu and O and no obvious impurities could be found on the surface of the ZnO/Cu2O NWs. The inset shows the high resolution XPS spectra of ZnO and Cu2O, respectively. Two peaks located at around 1021.5 eV and 1044.5 eV in the left inset are assigned to the binding energy of Zn 2p3 and Zn 2p1, respectively, indicating the presence of Zn2+ of the ZnO NWs in the sample. Accordingly, the right inset shows two strong peaks at 932 eV and 952 eV, which are assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in Cu2O, respectively.34 From the peak-fit for Cu 2p, a small satellite peak is found at 943 eV, which is assigned to Cu 2p3/2 in CuO.35 The weak peak implies that some CuO formed at a low temperature still exists, although it was not detected in the XRD pattern. The combined results of FE-SEM, EDX, XRD and XPS convincingly proved that the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs were successfully synthesized.
The optical absorption spectra of Cu2O and the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs are shown in Fig. 5. Pure Cu2O NWs show an absorption edge around a wavelength of 600 nm, close to the Cu2O bandgap energy of 2.0 eV. For 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs, there are two absorption edges which lie at 600 nm and 380 nm respectively and the absorption in the range of 350–600 nm was significantly enhanced. This could be attributed to the dense ZnO NWs over the Cu2O NWs that greatly enhance the light dispersion within the nanostructured material.

To evaluate the PEC activity of the samples, linear sweep photovoltammetry (LSV) was used under illumination of chopped AM 1.5G in 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution. The potential of the photocathode was determined using V versus RHE (volts) = V versus Ag/AgCl (volts) + [0.059 (volts) × pH] + 0.1976 (volts). Fig. 6 presents the LSV characteristics of the pure Cu2O NWs and 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs in the dark and under illumination of chopped AM 1.5G. As can be seen in Fig. 6, a large light-generated current was observed showing a high photoactivity for both electrodes. Moreover, the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs showed a photocurrent density of −4.55 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6a), much higher than the −2.08 mA cm−2 from the pure Cu2O NW electrode (Fig. 6b). Comparably, only ZnO seed coated Cu2O NWs have little improvement in the photoresponse (Fig. S4†). This result suggests that the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs were contributive to the enhanced PEC activity since the band edge potentials of Cu2O and the ZnO NWs created a suitable band energy offset that reduced the recombination of electrons and holes and optimized the electron flow.

The insets show the respective photocurrent density decay for the electrode held at 0 V vs. RHE in chopped light illumination for stability evaluation. 
Pure Cu2O has a weak stability because of the reductive decomposition according to eqn (5).36 In order to investigate the effect of the outer ZnO NWs on the Cu2O NWs, the photocurrent stability was measured at 0 V versus RHE under chopped illumination. Cu2O + 2e− + 2H+ → Cu + H2O(5)
As to the stability under illumination, the current–time (I–t) curves of the pure Cu2O NWs and 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs for 900 s of illumination are presented in the insets of Fig. 6, respectively. The inset in Fig. 6a shows that the pure Cu2O NW electrode initially had a large photocurrent but that the photocurrent quickly diminished to ∼−1 mA cm−2 within 100 s. After 300 s, the photocurrent was further reduced to zero. During the process, reductive decomposition of the Cu2O NWs was observed with the formation of a black area on the electrode, till the film was finally peeled off.
Compared to the pure Cu2O NWs, 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs showed a more stable photocurrent during the I–t test. The photocurrent only decreased to −2.2 mA cm−2 in the first 100 s, and −1.5 mA cm−2 in 300 s. After 900 s, the sample still kept −0.81 mA cm−2. As was speculated, the presence of the outer ZnO could, to some degree, protect the inner Cu2O from reductive decomposition. XPS measurements were further carried out to investigate the samples after 900 s of stability testing. As can be seen in Fig. S6,† the typical peaks of Cu2O totally disappeared for the pure Cu2O NW sample, while the relative strong peaks of Cu2O can still be found for the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs.
Compared with the reported multi-layer “metal oxide” protection,17 the single ZnO NWs layer was still not able to maintain a long-term stability, although it had already greatly improved the stability of the pure Cu2O NWs. In future work, an additional TiO2 layer will be investigated in order to further improve the stability. Table 1 summarizes the photoresponse of the samples fabricated under different conditions. It is found that the partial growth of the ZnO NWs on Cu2O (fabrication using low rpm or cycles) gave a limited improvement to the photoresponse and stability of the Cu2O NWs. But, significant improvement can be obtained when the ZnO NWs totally wrap the inner Cu2O NWs. The H2 production test was also carried out to investigate the performance of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs in water splitting. As shown in Fig. S5,† the accumulated H2 production rate reached 5.5 μmol cm−2 in 20 min using Na2SO4 as electrolyte, while no H2 was produced when adding sacrificial electron acceptors (K2S2O8). This indicates that the presence of K2S2O8 consumed the photogenerated electrons and it also confirmed that the photogenerated electrons reach the electrolyte interphase for the reduction of water.

To further characterize the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs, the transit time (τd) of the majority carriers in both the Cu2O NW electrode and 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW electrode was measured by IMPS. The transit time τd is the average time that photogenerated charges take to transfer to the back contact, and can be estimated from the equation τd = (2π × fmin(IMPS))−1, where fmin is the frequency at the minimal value in the IMPS plot.37 The transit time reflects the recombination probability of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the photoeletrode.38Fig. 7 shows the IMPS plots of the Cu2O NW electrode and 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW electrode. According to the aforementioned equation, the transit time τd for the Cu2O NW electrode is 15.9 ms, whereas it is only 4.9 ms for the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW electrode. This indicates that the transport speed of the photogenerated majority charges in the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW electrode is 3 times faster than that in the Cu2O NW electrode. That is, the ZnO–Cu2O heterojunction can facilitate the transport of the photogenerated majority charges to the counter-electrode and, correspondingly, the transport of the photogenerated electrons to the electrolyte can also be enhanced. In consequence, the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs could be improved.
 Fig. 7  The IMPS plots in the function of normalized efficiency vs. log (frequency). 
The improved performance of the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs is mainly due to the larger surface area, the improved optical absorption and the specific heterostructure which favour the separation of the photo-introduced electron–hole pairs. As depicted in Fig. 8a, the light might experience multiple scatterings in the free space among the ZnO NWs and Cu2O NWs, resulting in the enhancement of the light absorbance. Fig. 8b shows the favourable p–n junction formation, which contributes to the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs under visible light irradiation, avoids charge recombination with band bending at the ZnO–Cu2O junction and reduces the barrier at the ZnO–electrolyte junction. This increased band bending and decreased barrier lead to the enhanced photocurrent. On the other hand, in an ideal situation the high-density ZnO NWs grown on a single Cu2O NW would provide a 50 times larger surface area than the Cu2O NW alone, which would greatly favour photocatalytic applications such as the photocatalytic degradation of organics.

4. Conclusions
A facile route for the large-scale fabrication of 3D ZnO/Cu2O NW photocathode material is proposed in this paper. 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs were grown on a copper substrate using simple, cost-effective wet chemical oxidation and hydrothermal growth methods. The heterojunction was investigated by FESEM, XRD and XPS, which confirmed that the electrode mainly consisted of ZnO NWs and Cu2O NWs. Due to the larger surface area and ZnO NW shells, the 3D ZnO/Cu2O NWs exhibited a higher photocathodic current as well as an enhanced stability. This paper provides a useful insight into the design and fabrication of 3D nanostructured electrodes with low-cost and earth-abundant materials for potentially cost-effective and highly-efficient photocathode materials for water splitting and organic pollutant degradation.
