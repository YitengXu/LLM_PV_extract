, Accepted 2nd December 2013First published on 27th January 2014AbstractTwo simplified chemical processes, a co-precipitation and a reduction method, were developed to synthesize pure Cu2Se nanoparticles. The XRD results indicate that the co-precipitation method is a better way to synthesize high-purity Cu2Se in comparison to the reduction method, where a small amount of Cu2O and Cu are found. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that Cu2Se powder synthesized by the reduction method possesses a morphology dominated by irregular hexagonal nanoplates and spherical nanoparticles; however, only nanoplates are observed in powder prepared by the co-precipitation method. The effect of the two synthetic methods on the thermoelectric properties of Cu2Se, in the temperature range of 300–1000 K, was investigated. The results indicate that the co-precipitation method subsequently combined with a hot-press process, is an effective way to improve Cu2Se thermoelectric performance compared to the reduction method together with hot-pressing. The largest figure of merit, ZT, for Cu2Se fabricated by the co-precipitation method is 1.35, which is 40% larger than that of Cu2Se fabricated by the reduction method (ZTmax = 0.97) due to its good power factor at high temperatures.
Introduction
Thermoelectric materials can convert energies between heat and electricity.1,2 An urgent search is required to find efficient, environmentally-friendly and sustainable materials. To date, a great amount of work researching power generation has been focused on Pb and/or Te-based materials such as Bi2Te3,3 Bi2−xSbxTe3,4 PbTe, AgPbmSbTem+2,5,6 AgPbmSnnSbTe2+m+n,5 and NaPbmSbTe2+m.7 Clearly, Pb is not environmentally-friendly, and Te is not only rare in the Earth's crust, but also increasingly used in a number of other applications, such as steel metallurgy and solar cells. Exploration of Pb & Te-free high-performance thermoelectric materials is therefore vital for use in a wide range of applications. Of these materials, Cu2Se is attractive as it is reported to have the highest figure of merit; ZT = 1.5 at 1000 K.8
This novel thermoelectric material, Cu2Se, with an energy gap of 1.23 eV, has quite complex atomic arrangements8 and exhibits two phases; a low-temperature α-phase and a high-temperature β-phase. The high-temperature β-phase Cu2Se crystallizes in an Fmm type lattice with Se atoms in a simple face-centred cubic (fcc) structure, and Cu ions distributed on the different interstitial sites. Compared with the β-phase, the structure of the α-phase Cu2Se is much more complicated as it can crystallize in three possible ways: monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic.
Until now, reasonably high ZT values have been achieved in polycrystalline bulk ingots.8,9 L. D. Chen’s group has reported on Cu2−xSe bulk material fabricated by a melting method and a subsequent spark plasma sintering technique.8 Their results show that the material has power factors around 6–8 μW cm−1 K−2 for the α-phase and 7–12 μW cm−1 K−2 for the β-phase (420–1000 K). Due to the very low lattice thermal conductivity around 0.4–0.6 W m−1 K−1, at high temperatures, ZT reaches 1.5 at 1000 K for Cu2Se. Through ball milling and hot pressing techniques,9 Z. F. Ren’s group has demonstrated a large ZT of ∼1.6 at 700 °C for β-phase copper selenide (Cu2Se and Cu2Se1.01).
To the best of our knowledge, the TE performance of the products is usually dependent on the preparation method.10–13 For example, synthesized by a low-temperature hydrothermal method and hot pressing, a laminated nanostructured Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 with ZT ∼ 1.5 has been reported.10 Poudel et al. reported a series of p-type nanostructured bismuth antimony tellurium alloys with ZT ∼ 1.3, by combining ball milling and hot pressing techniques.11,12 More recently, p-type Bi2Te3 with a high ZT value of 1.4 has also been prepared for hot forged samples.13
Until now, many preparation methods such as the standard Schlenk line and glove box techniques, with the hot-injection method,14 a template free-solvothermal method,15 a green paraffin-acetate method,16 hydrothermal co-reduction methods,17 and electrodeposited methods18 have been reported to fabricate nanostructured Cu2Se materials. Chemical synthesis has the potential of producing nanoparticles with a smaller size and controlled shape, which can result in increased grain boundary scattering to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. However, as far as we know, there have been no reports on the thermoelectric properties of Cu2Se synthesized by a chemical method.
In this work, we prepared nanostructured Cu2Se using a low-temperature co-precipitation technique and a reduction method. We investigated the thermoelectric properties of the Cu2Se nanostructured bulk material in the temperature range of 300–1000 K.
Experimental
Synthesis of Cu2Se nanoparticles
Reduction method. To synthesize selenide with a nominal composition, 60 mmol CuCl (AR) and 30 mmol Se (5 N, Alfa Aesar) were added to a 1000 ml glass beaker containing 400 ml deionized water and ethylene glycol in a volume ratio of 7:3. 5 g NaOH and 5 g NaBH4 were then added sequentially into the beaker. The solution was stirred by a magnetic stirrer and a temperature of 100 °C was maintained during synthesis. After 3 hours, a large quantity of powders were precipitated.
Co-precipitation method. 30 mmol Se and 400 ml anhydrous ethylenediamine were added to a 1000 ml glass beaker. After mixing uniformly, 60 mmol CuCl was then added to the beaker. The solution was stirred by a magnetic stirrer at a speed of 1700 rpm and at a constant temperature of 150 °C, during synthesis. After about two hours, a large quantity of powders were precipitated.The precipitates were then collected, filtered and washed respectively with anhydrous ethanol and distilled water until a pH value close to 7 was obtained. They were then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for nearly 6 h.
Nanopowders of Cu2Se were hot-pressed into dense pellets under a pressure of 600 MPa at 400 °C for 1 h.

Characterization of the samples
The crystal phase of the samples was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu K-alpha radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) on an X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer over the 2θ range of 10–90°. The relative content of each component in the sample was determined by semi-quantitative analysis in X'Pert HighScore on the basis of RIR (=Reference Intensity Ratio) values (often called I/Ic values). The morphology was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Sirion 200). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2010 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Squares of 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm and bars of about 2 mm × 3 mm × 12 mm were cut and polished from the pressed disks for characterization of the thermoelectric properties. The electrical resistivity of the sample was measured by a four-point direct current (DC) current-switching technique, and the Seebeck coefficient was measured by a static DC method, using commercial equipment (ZEM-3(M10), Ulvac Riko, Inc.) in a low-pressure helium environment with temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 K. The thermal diffusivity, D, was measured using the laser flash method (Netzsch, LFA-457). The specific heat, Cp, was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (Netzsch DSC 404F3). The density, d, was measured by Archimedes' method. The resulting thermal conductivity was calculated from the measured thermal diffusivity D, specific heat Cp, and density d from the relationship κ = DdCP.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the nanopowder synthesized by the reduction method and the as-pressed bulk sample for Cu2Se. It can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that the main diffraction peaks are consistent with the standard JCPDS (88-2044) card for β-Cu2Se, with a cubic structure (crystal group Fmm) and a lattice parameter a of 5.722 Å. A small amount of the Cu2O and Cu contaminant phase is also observed, and their XRD pattern agrees with that given by the JCPDS codes 78-2076 and 65-9743, respectively. The relative amounts of Cu2Se, Cu2O and Cu phases are 84%, 9% and 7%, respectively. The peaks of the experimental XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1(a) are broadened, indicating that the Cu2Se particles are very small. Taking into account the line broadening caused by crystallite size (d), after deduction of the instrumental broadening, the mean size of the crystallites is 14.2 nm, estimated from the simulated XRD pattern. The XRD patterns of Cu2Se after hot-pressing are shown in Fig. 1(b). In spite of the existing Cu2O, α-Cu2Se with the standard JCPDS (19-0401) card and an orthorhombic structure is observed. The calculated lattice parameters for α-Cu2Se are 11.477 Å, 8.373 Å and 4.222 Å for a, b and c, respectively.

The XRD patterns of the nanopowder prepared by the co-precipitation method and the subsequent bulk sample of Cu2Se are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2(b) that β-Cu2Se (JCPDS no. 88-2044) and α-Cu2Se (JCPDS no. 19-0401), as shown in Fig. 2(a), coexist by the co-precipitation method. The relative amounts of α-Cu2Se and β-Cu2Se are 64% and 36%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(c), β-Cu2Se is almost undetectable after hot-pressing.

Fig. 3 displays representative SEM images of the Cu2Se nanopowder synthesized by the reduction method (shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c)) and the cross-sectional view of the as-pressed sample (as seen in Fig. 3(d)–(f)). Cu2Se powder has a morphology dominated by irregular hexagonal nanoplates and spherical nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3(a). The higher magnification SEM images (Fig. 3(b) and (c)) show that the spherical nanoparticles are up to about 100 nm in size and that the irregular hexagonal nanoplates, with a thickness ranging from about 30 nm to 100 nm and a side length of hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers, are stacked with several layers of nanosheets. The cleaved face microstructure of the sample after hot-pressing (Fig. 3(d)) shows that it is composed of plates and grains. The grains are typically within 200 nm (as shown in Fig. 3(e)). The size of the plates for Cu2Se (as shown in Fig. 3(f)) is up by about 100 nm in thickness. The thickness of the plates and size of the grains, as-pressed, are larger than those of the nanopowders due to nanosintering. SEM images of the Cu2Se nanopowder synthesized by co-precipitation, and the cross-sectional image of the as-pressed sample are shown in Fig. 4. The morphology of the Cu2Se powder is shown in Fig. 4(a). It can be seen that the powder has a nanoflower-like shape with a diameter of 150–500 nm, crosslinked by nanoplates of around 10 nm in thickness and 100 nm in diameter. However, the nanoflower-like structures and the nanoplates are not observed in the hot-pressed bulk material as shown in Fig. 4(b): the grains have grown substantially to be 200–500 nm in length, between which are embedded some nanopores with a size of 100–200 nm.

TEM images provide further insight into the microstructural detail of the berzelianite hexagonal nanoplates synthesized by the reduction method (SEM, Fig. 3(c)) as shown in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5(a) that the nanoplates are approximately hexagonal. A high-resolution image looking down onto the surface of a Cu2Se nanoplate is given in Fig. 5(b). The lattice spacing of about 2.05 Å corresponds to the (220) planes of the cubic phase berzelianite. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) taken from the edge of the nanoplates (Fig. 5(c)) shows several obvious dots, which are indexed to the (0), (0), (02), (220), (202) and (02) planes of the cubic crystalline structure of berzelianite, with the zone axes along the direction of (111), consistent with the schematic structure of the berzelianite lattice projected along the [111] shown in Fig. 5(d). All these results reveal that the as-synthesized hexagonal nanoplates are well-crystallized, single crystalline in nature, and free from dislocation and stacking faults. Fig. 5(e) is an EDS spectrum obtained from the nanoplates. Only Cu and Se peaks are observed (the nickel signal is from the substrate), suggesting that the nanoplates are composed mainly of Cu and Se. Quantitative EDS analysis shows that the atom ratio of Cu/Se is 1.85, indicating that the composition of the as-synthesized product is non-stoichiometric berzelianite.

Complex chemical reactions were involved in the synthesis of Cu2Se by both the reduction and the co-precipitation routes. The possible chemical reactions for the reduction method involved in the synthesis of Cu2Se could be listed as follows: 
2BH4− + 6Cu+ + 6OH− → 2H2BO3− + 6Cu + 4H2
(1) 
3Se + 6OH−  2Se2− + SeO32− + 3H2O
(2) 
SeO32− + BH4− → Seα+12− + H2BO3 + H2
(3) 
Seα+1  α:Se + Se2−
(4) 
2αCu + (α:Se) → αCu2Se
(5) 
2Cu+ + Se2− → Cu2Se
(6)
The disproportional reaction of Se can produce SeO32−. The SeO32− ions are then reduced to an Seα+12− colloid (α is an uncertain number) by BH4−, which consists of Se atoms and Se2− ions. The Seα+12− colloid can accelerate further reactions as it provides a kind of more active Se source relative to the Se precursor powders. Thus, the synthesis of Cu2Se nanoparticles involves two formation mechanisms: the atom reaction mechanism and the ion reaction mechanism.
In the chemical reaction processing of Cu2Se, by the co-precipitation route, ethylenediamine could slowly dissolve CuCl to form corresponding complexes at room temperature and reduce Cu+ to active atomic Cu. The newly formed atom was rather active; subsequently they combined with elemental selenium, which was dissolved in ethylenediamine and formed nanocrystalline Cu2Se. The whole process can be described by the following reactions:    
We will now briefly discuss the possible growth mechanisms involved in the two methods in the present study. Generally, formation of nanospheres and hexagonal nanoplates by a reduction method, as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), should involve two stages: an initial nucleating stage and a subsequent self-growth stage. There currently exists two concepts in particle growth: the Ostwald ripening mechanism19 vs. the oriented attachment mechanism,20 i.e., atom-by-atom addition growth vs. particle-by-particle growth. The oriented attachment mechanism is found to be responsible for the growth of Cu2Se hexagonal nanoplates. The stepwise formation process is described as follows: Cu2Se nuclei are formed in the initial stage and subsequently grow into nanocrystals. The nanocrystals then aggregate without sharing the same lattice plane. During the oriented attachment process, the adjacent aggregated nanocrystals are rotated to share a common crystallographic orientation and form bigger crystals, thus increasing the in-plane diameter. Finally, single crystal two-dimensional nanosheets and nanoplates are formed. In the case of the formation of the flower-like Cu2Se nanostructure by the co-precipitation method, as shown in Fig. 4(a), two stages should be involved: an initial nucleating stage and a subsequent self-growth stage. In the second stage, an Ostwald ripening process and geometric building blocks play key roles in the formation of the flower-like Cu2Se.
Fig. 6(a)–(c) provides the typical TEM images of the pressed Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method. Fig. 6(a) shows that the grains are typically around 100 nm. The SAED pattern (Fig. 6(b)) reveals the high crystalline feature of the product. Fig. 6(c) is a room temperature HRTEM image of a typical as-prepared bulk sample. It can be seen that the interplanar distance, 0.66 nm, corresponds to the lattice planes (111) in orthorhombic α-Cu2Se. Lattice fringes of 0.32 nm correspond to the (111) facets of cubic β-Cu2Se.

Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependencies of the thermoelectric properties of the hot-pressed nanopowder Cu2Se compounds prepared by the reduction method and the co-precipitation method. Electrical resistivity of the Cu2Se samples are shown in Fig. 7(I). The temperature dependence of ρ for the two samples is similar: it increases slightly with an increase in temperature from 400 to 850 K; however, with a further increase in temperature from 850 K to 1000 K, ρ increases steeply. When compared to Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method, ρ for Cu2Se prepared by the co-precipitation method is lower for the whole temperature range investigated. For instance, ρ at room temperature is 0.85 × 10−5 Ω m and 0.30 × 10−5 Ω m for Cu2Se prepared by the reduction method and the co-precipitation method, respectively. It is also observed that when T < 400 K, the electrical resistivity of Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method shows an anomalous behavior at about 380 K. According to the DSC measurements and ref. 8, this anomaly is due to the α–β phase transition. Seebeck coefficient S versus temperature for Cu2Se at a temperature range of 300–1000 K is depicted in Fig. 7(II). The Cu2Se compounds synthesized by the two methods possess a positive Seebeck coefficient, which means that the Cu2Se compounds have a p-type conduction. The Seebeck coefficient of the two samples increases with an increase in temperature except for the anomalous transition near 380 K owing to the α–β phase transition in Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method. Moreover, S for Cu2Se prepared by the co-precipitation method is lower than that of Cu2Se fabricated by the reduction method in the temperature range of 300–1000 K.

Temperature dependencies of electrical resistivity ρ (I), thermopower S (II), power factor (III) thermal conductivity κ, lattice thermal conductivity (IV) and figure-of-merit ZT (V) are shown. 
Room-temperature Hall coefficient measurements indicate that the carrier concentrations p for Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method and the co-precipitation method are 4.8 × 1019 cm−3 and 9.8 × 1019 cm−3, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The larger carrier concentration for Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method, compared with the concentration of Cu2Se fabricated by the reduction method, results in a lower electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient compared to Cu2Se prepared by the reduction method.

Based on the measured ρ and S, the calculated power factors (PF = S2/ρ) are shown in Fig. 7(III). A marked discontinuity is observed at the α–β transition near 380 K for the two samples, the PF increases with an increase in temperature from 400 K, and then decreases with a further increase in temperature, leaving a maximum value at about 850 K. The PF for Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method is larger than that of Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method in the temperature range of 300–670 K, however, above 670 K the PF for Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method surpasses that of Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method. The maximum PF reached 1.26 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2 for Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method at 860 K. Fig. 7(IV) shows the data of temperature dependent thermal conductivity, κ, and lattice thermal conductivity, κL, for Cu2Se synthesized by the two chemical methods. As well as the temperature range of the α–β transition from 300 to 420 K, the thermal conductivity for Cu2Se decreases gradually with increasing temperature. It can be seen that κ for Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method is much lower than that of Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method in the temperature range of 300–600 K. However, above 600 K the difference in κ between the two samples is small. The lattice thermal conductivity values, κL, for the two samples are around 0.4–0.6 W m−1 K−1 at high temperatures, which is quite consistent with that of Cu2Se synthesized by a solid state reaction,8 indicating that the low lattice thermal conductivity at high temperatures originates from the nature of the materials. The low κ and/or κL for Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method, in the temperature range of 300–600 K, as compared to Cu2Se prepared by the reduction method is due to the high density of interfaces, pores and grain boundaries present in the sample. Based on the data outlined above, the temperature dependence of ZT for Cu2Se compounds is shown in Fig. 7(V). The maximum ZT for Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method is 0.97; however, through the co-precipitation method the maximum ZT reached 1.35. The optimal figure of merit ZT can be determined by the thermoelectric quality factor B ∝ μm*3/2/κL, which is proportional to the density of states effective mass m*, the carriers mobility μ, and the reciprocal lattice thermal conductivity κL. The lower lattice thermal conductivity will lead to the higher ZT. The reduction sample was annealed at 523 K for 30 minutes. The electrical properties of Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method before and after annealing were included as ESI.† It can be seen that there is little difference between ρ and S for Cu2Se before and after annealing. That is to say, annealing has nearly no effect on the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient for Cu2Se synthesized by the reduction method. The reduction sample has a lower ZT value (ZTmax = 0.97) than the reported value (1.5),8 which may be attributed to the preparation process. In the reduction process, NaOH and NaBH4 were introduced to this chemical reaction. The removal of sodium ions is difficult work; in other words, sodium ions can't all be removed. The lower ZT value may be due to the existence of this kind of foreign ion damaging the thermoelectric performance of Cu2Se.
Conclusions
Two simple and low-temperature wet chemical methods, the reduction method and the co-precipitation method, were used to synthesize large-scale Cu2Se nanoparticles. The structures and morphologies of the samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDAX). The effect of the two synthetic methods on the thermoelectric properties of Cu2Se at a temperature range of 300–1000 K was explored. The maximum figure of merit ZTmax obtained here reached 1.35 for Cu2Se synthesized by the co-precipitation method which is 40% larger than that of Cu2Se fabricated by the reduction method (ZTmax = 0.97). The good thermoelectric properties of the sample, at high temperatures, resulted primarily from its low thermal conductivity and its high power factor. Our results indicate that the co-precipitation method is an efficient way to synthesize Cu2Se with a good thermoelectric performance.
