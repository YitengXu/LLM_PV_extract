    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 5th July 2021AbstractWe report three newly synthesized D-A-π-A metal-free organic sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as an internal acceptor (A) and N-substituted indolines fused with cyclopentane or cyclohexane as donor (D) building block. Optical and photovoltaic properties of the new MAX series dyes and solar cells based on them were considered in comparison with our previously-reported dye MAX114 and well-known dye WS-2. The effect of replacing the cyclopentane ring with a cyclohexane one, as well as a substituent at the nitrogen atom of the donor fragment (aromatic p-tolyl, non-aromatic benzyl and aliphatic 2-ethylhexyl) on the position of absorption maxima in UV/vis spectra, the EHOMO and ELUMO values of MAX series sensitizers and photocurrent density–voltage trends of the corresponding solar cells were studied. It was shown that the MAX157 dye with a 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-carbazole donor fragment has a shorter-wavelength absorption maximum in the intra-molecular charge transfer absorption band with the largest molar extinction coefficient in comparison with the other dyes studied. The same dye applied to the TiO2 surface showed broader optical absorption compared to other dyes in the MAX series. All dyes have a relatively narrow HOMO–LUMO gap (1.80–1.90 eV). Amongst the series, DSSCs based on MAX157 dye recorded the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.2%, which increased to 5.8% when co-sensitized with SQ2 dye. All MAX dyes reached PCEs varying between 4.4–5.2%, superior to the reference WS-2 dye (3.6%).

Design, System, Application
We have designed and newly synthesized the series of D-A-π-A organic sensitizers with N-substituted indolines fused with cyclopentane or cyclohexane as donor (D) building block. The influence of structural fragments of donor moieties of the dyes on the optical and photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been demonstrated. Comparison of donor N-substituted indolines fused with cyclopentane or cyclohexanes revealed that the introduction of only one additional CH2 group into the alicyclic fragment fused with indoline leads to hypsochromic shifts of the ICT absorption maximum and increasing of the molar extinction coefficient. At the same time, the replacement of N-aryl substituent to branch alkyl chain in indoline part increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) especially when the co-sensitization technique is using. It was demostrated that even a slight change in the structure of individual structural fragments of dyes has a significant effect on the optical and photovoltaic properties of DCCSs and deeper understanding the problem of the structure–property relationship was achieved.

1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the most promising complementary technologies to silicon and other inorganic solar energy converters due to their ease of manufacture, mechanical strength, light weight, flexibility, long service life and the ability to work even under reflected and artificial light.1–4 Organic photosensitizers play a key role in such devices, and substantially determine their performance.5,6 Modern organic dyes based on individual molecules employ various combinations of the main components: donors (D), acceptors (A), and π-bridges – each of which performs its own important function in finely tuning the photophysical parameters of a substance.7 Despite the rich variability of structures that can be built from these fragments, their successful use in DSSCs requires a “push–pull” structure, which is dictated by the need to provide intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) from a donor to an acceptor, which also acts as an anchor.8,9 Evolution from the simplest D–A type molecules to more complex combinations revealed the most highly-performing structure containing an additional internal acceptor and a π-bridge between the terminal acceptor and donor.10 The use of D-A-π-A molecules for DSSCs was first proposed by Zhu and co-authors in 2011.11 One of the most successful dyes described in this work, WS-2, was further modified by the authors6 in order to better understand the effect of individual structural fragments of sensitizers on the properties of final substances. While this work partially shed light on the structure–property relationship, it did not lead to significant improvement of the PCE of solar cells.
In pursuit of improving the photovoltaic characteristics, researchers have followed the path of complicating the chemical structure of dyes, although such complex and cumbersome synthetic sequences have often led to an improvement in PCE by only a fraction of a percent.12 Such complex dyes are normally obtained from rare and expensive starting compounds by multi-stage synthesis which consists of more than ten stages. As a result, the overall yield of the target substances is prohibitively low. Therefore, it is necessary to continue the search for molecules of the D-A-π-A type, with simpler synthetic schemes, yet providing high photovoltaic parameters.
We have previously established that even a slight change in the structure of the donor fragment has a significant effect on the photovoltaic properties of the final structures.13 The analogue of WS-2, which differs by only one CH2 group of the donor fragment, MAX114, showed a strong hypsochromic shift from 533 nm for WS-2 to 482 nm for MAX114, which confirmed a strong dependence of the ICT band on the donor structure. It is known that the donor fragment plays a significant role in the formation of the energy values of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and for the difference between the energies of the highest occupied and lowest vacant molecular orbital (ΔE or Egap).
Therefore, this work was based on varying the structure of the donor fragment of dyes similar to WS-2, using substituents at the nitrogen atom of the indoline ring, as well as the use of a cyclohexane fragment condensed with the latter. This addresses several design features: MAX140 and MAX157 with branched alkyl substituents will reduce the area of the dye on the TiO2 surface; MAX155 with a benzyl substituent at the indoline nitrogen atom instead of p-tolyl will probe whether a conjugated π-system is necessary to adjust the electron-donor properties of fragment D. Furthermore, it will be possible to avoid catalytic arylation of the indoline nitrogen atom, since the alkyl substituents can be introduced by direct N-alkylation, simplifying the synthetic scheme.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
It was previously shown that structures similar to WS-2, although capable of producing high values of current and voltage and, as a consequence, total PCE, suffer from excessive aggregation.3 In an attempt to avoid this, the authors used a hexyl-substituted π-bridge for the design of the WS-6 dye, which made it possible to increase the PCE compared to WS-2 from 5.07% to 6.85%.12 We have previously shown13 that replacing the five-membered fused ring in the donor fragment of the WS-2 sensitizer with a six-membered one also leads to a significant increase in JSC from 11.8 mA cm−2 to 14.75 mA cm−2, VOC from 0.59 mV to 0.64 mV, and, as a result, PCE from 5.07%11 to 5.86%, which is also a consequence of a decrease in aggregation due to the presence of a more bulky cyclohexyl substituent. We continued to study the effect of the introduction of bulky alkyl substituents into the donor part of molecules on the aggregation of dyes on TiO2 substrates. We chose benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as an internal acceptor, a thiophene ring as a π-bridge, and a cyanoacrylate residue played the role of a terminal acceptor and anchor. The molecular structures of the dyes are shown in Fig. 1. The general strategy for the synthesis of dyes with D-A-π-A motif follows a stepwise approach (Schemes 1 and 2).

Initially, the approach to key donor blocks 5 was planned to be carried out similarly to 7-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4-(p-tolyl)-1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]indole, which was used in the synthesis of the dye WS-2,14 replacing the catalytic arylation step of the indoline nitrogen atom with an alkylation step under nucleophilic substitution reaction conditions. However, it turned out that this approach is applicable only for benzyl derivative 3c, and 2-ethylhexyl substituted indolines 3a,b cannot be obtained by this method: alkylation with 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane led to the return of the starting compounds in the case of both indolines 1a,b. Apparently, the reason lies in the combination of two factors. On the one hand, the geometry of the indoline ring is such that the carbon ring annelated with it partially overlaps the nucleophilic center on the nitrogen atom, making it less capable of attacking sterically loaded substrates. On the other hand, the presence of branching in the immediate vicinity of the reaction center of the attacked bromide imposes an additional steric load and makes the approach of the nucleophile impossible.
We managed to get around this difficulty by changing the synthetic sequence. It turned out that indoles 1a,b annelated with alicyclic fragments are easily alkylated with sterically hindered 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane under the conditions of a nucleophilic substitution reaction, despite the reduced nucleophilicity of the conjugated nitrogen atom. The alkylated indoles 2a,b obtained in good yields are reduced under conditions analogous to unsubstituted indoles 1a,b. Bromination and subsequent replacement of the bromine atom with a protected boronic acid was carried out under the conditions described in the literature earlier (Scheme 1).14
Synthesis of the target dyes in the MAX and WS-2 series was carried out using two successive cross-coupling reactions of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole with donor boronic acids 5 and π-spacer 7. The first stage was carried out under conditions of Suzuki reactions catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 in the presence of aqueous K2CO3 in THF to obtain mono-adducts 6a–e in moderate yields. At the second stage, the conditions of the Stille reaction were used: catalysis by PdCl2(PPh3)2 in toluene followed by saponification with HCl to remove dioxolane protection. The resulting intermediate products were introduced into the Knoevenagel reaction with cyanoacetic acid tert-butyl ester without additional isolation and purification. The hydrolysis of esters 8 resulted in the final structures MAX and WS-2, which, after thorough chromatographic purification (Scheme 2), were used in solar cell device fabrication.
2.2. Optical properties
The UV-vis optical response of the MAX series was recorded in toluene/ethanol (7:3, v/v) at 1 × 10−5 M (Fig. 2(a)). The absorption peaks (λmax) and extinction coefficients (ε) are summarized in Table 1. The MAX dyes have two marked absorption regions. Short-wavelength absorption maxima in the 390–400 nm range correspond to a π/π* transition, while broad long-wavelength absorption bands in the 505–530 nm range indicate the presence of an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process between indoline donor fragments and acceptor groups. The π/π*-transition absorption peak occurs in a narrow range for all dyes studied (the maximum difference is 9 nm), including WS-2, which may indicate close values of the energy gap. At the same time, changes in the structure of donor fragments critically affect the intensity of the ICT absorption peaks. Dyes with six-membered annulated cycles MAX157 and MAX114 have absorption bands at shorter wavelengths (518 nm and 507 nm, correspondingly) than dyes with cyclopentaindole, and the molar extinction coefficient is almost 2–3 times higher (22.5 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for MAX157 and 20.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for MAX114 against 8.83 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for MAX140 and 12.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for MAX155). In this case, the nature of the substituent at the nitrogen atom does not significantly affect the position of the ICT absorption peaks; replacement of the p-tolyl substituent with an alkyl substituent leads to a slight red shift of the absorption maxima for cyclopentaindoline derivatives (from 533 nm for WS-2 to 541 nm for MAX140) and for cyclohexaindoline dyes (from 507 nm for MAX114 to 518 nm for MAX157). This may mean that there is no significant contribution of p-tolyl substituents of the WS-2 and MAX114 dyes to the general conjugation system; therefore, replacing aryl substituents with alkyl substituents will not worsen the optical properties of sensitizers.

The absorption spectra of all dyes including WS-2 loaded on TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2(b). The overall profiles differ from those in solution. All dyes show hypsochromic shifts, but the effect is negligible, resulting in an absorption profile that sits in the visible range. Nevertheless, the presence of a blue shift of the absorption peaks on TiO2 compared with that in solution proves the absorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface through the deprotonation of the carboxylic group and suggests the formation of H-aggregates characteristic of dyes, with good planarity and the possibility of parallel arrangement. MAX140 and MAX157 show broader optical absorption compared to MAX114 and MAX155, suggesting the higher light harvesting ability of these two dyes.

MAX157, which has the highest molecular extinction coefficient and broadest UV-vis absorption range, was co-sensitized with the squaraine SQ2 dye as in Fig. 2(c). The co-sensitized MAX157 + SQ2 clearly displays the spectrum closest to panchromatic in respect to the mono-sensitized films.
2.3. Electrochemical properties
To estimate the energy values of the frontier orbitals, the values of the peak potentials of the electrooxidation (EO) and electroreduction (ER) of the MAX compounds obtained by cyclic voltammetry were used. The studied compounds have similar peak potentials of ER and EO (Fig. 3). The first stages of their ER are reversible at the potential sweep rate v = 0.1 V s−1. The EO peaks become quasi-reversible with an increase in v ≥ 1 V s−1. The oxidation peak of MAX114 is irreversible up to v = 10 V s−1.

The energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) were estimated from the values of the formal reduction Ered = (Epc + Epa)/2 and oxidation Eox = (Epa + Epc)/2 potentials, respectively. The values of EredFc/Fc+ and EoxFc/Fc+ were calculated relative to the potential of the reversible ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox pair (Table 2), taking into account that the absolute oxidation potential of ferrocene is −5.1 eV.15,16 These values were used to calculate the values of the LUMO and HOMO using the formulas: EHOMO(eV) = −|e|(EoxFc/Fc+ + 5.1)(1) ELUMO(eV) = −|e|(EredFc/Fc+ + 5.1)(2)The obtained LUMO values of the compounds are higher than the TiO2 semiconductor energy level (−4.2 eV),17 and the HOMO values are lower than the I−/I3− (−5.2 eV) level.18 These parameters confirm the suitability of the MAX compounds as dye candidates in DSSCs. The relatively narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps of the MAX series, where MAX114 (1.91 eV) > MAX155 (1.88 eV) > MAX157 (1.84 eV) > MAX140 (1.80 eV), suggest that a higher current density could be achieved in the solar cell.19

2.4. DSSC performance

2.4.1. Photovoltaic performance of the MAX series. 
The novel dyes, MAX140, MAX155 and MAX157, were tested in DSSCs with the I−/I3− electrolyte under AM1.5G irradiation in comparison with the reference WS-2 dye and previously reported MAX114 dye. First of all, the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of one batch of all MAX dyes were recorded as in Fig. S1,† to confirm the validity of the IV tests hereon. Indeed, the simulated current density is shown to approximate the current density obtained from the IV measurements. The photovoltaic characteristics of the best devices obtained for each dye are summarized in Table 3, and the corresponding J–V curves are presented in Fig. 4. The statistics are shown in the ESI† (Table S1). Remarkably, all MAX dyes exhibited superior performance to the reference WS-2 dye (3.6%), reaching 4.94%, 5.15%, 4.38% and 5.20% for MAX114, MAX140, MAX155 and MAX157, respectively. The improvements are attributed to the increased current and voltage in the cells. Amongst the series, two dyes MAX140 and MAX157 with 2-ethylhexyl alkyl chain in the donor part present the highest PCEs over 5% and JSC values of 13.87 mA cm−2 and 12.02 mA cm−2, respectively. The higher performance of these dyes can be attributed to the broader optical absorption which will improve the light harvesting. The DSSCs based on MAX157 dye have a maximum VOC value, which may indicate more pronounced electron-recombination blocking of 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-carbazol-6-yl moiety in comparison with the other donors. Indeed, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S2†) reveals that the electron lifetime and recombination resistance are higher for MAX157 within the series. On the other hand, the low chemical capacitance for the MAX dyes compared to N719 leads to a shorter electron lifetime range, which explains the relatively low VOC range below 0.6 V.

 Fig. 4  Current density–voltage curves of the best DSSCs using the MAX dyes and WS-2 dye at AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 with 4 μm transparent TiO2 layer and CDCA additions. 
The full set of the MAX dyes were tested in DSSCs with a transparent TiO2 film thickness of 4 μm, since it was shown using the MAX140 dye as an example (see Table S2, Fig. S3 in ESI†) that an increase in the transparent layer thickness to 8 and 12 μm leads to a decrease in JSC (to 11.96 and 11.58 mA cm−2, respectively), VOC (up to 0.54 and 0.52 mV, respectively) and PCE (up to 4.71 and 4.15%, respectively) values, which is probably associated with the occurrence of dye aggregation due to increasing the dye loading amount. In addition, a thinner TiO2 layer minimizes charge-transport losses.20
To achieve the maximum photovoltaic parameters, the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) additive turned out to be beneficial, analogous to previous reports claiming that it prevents excessive dye aggregation. The DSSC performance based on MAX140 without any addition of CDCA (JSC = 7.17 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.51 mV, PCE = 2.68%, see Table S3, Fig. S4 in ESI†) is almost twice lower than with the addition of CDCA.
Thus, DSSCs based on the three dyes we prepared showed better results compared to the reference dye WS-2. To assess the possible use of the new dyes in practice, it is necessary to understand how stable the devices are under normal operating conditions. The most vulnerable link that can significantly shorten the lifespan of DSSCs is the dye, which can irreversibly degrade with prolonged exposure to sunlight. The change in photovoltaic characteristics with time when exposed to sunlight is direct evidence of the stability of the photosensitizer.
Using the MAX140 dye as an example, it was shown that during normal operation within five weeks there is a gradual decrease in photovoltaic parameters (Table S4, Fig. S5 in ESI†), and the PCE value decreases by almost 15%. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the basic parameters (JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE) of a MAX140 solar cell over time when kept under normal operating conditions (in the dark at night and under direct or scattered sunlight during the day). From the above dependences it can be seen that after ten weeks (a total of ca. 1680 h, which corresponds to 840 h under normal sunlight), there is only a slight decrease in the photocurrent value, fill factor and, as a consequence, PCE, which indicates that the whole the system reaches equilibrium and further changes are minor.

2.4.2. Co-sensitizing MAX157 with SQ2. 
Co-sensitization is a powerful technique to further broaden the absorption spectra of the original dye.21 In this regard, MAX157, the best performing dye in the MAX series, was co-sensitized with a well-known squaraine blue dye SQ2 (Fig. 7),22 absorbing in near-infrared region. The UV-vis absorption profile in Fig. 2(c) shows the complementary effect of both dyes in the co-sensitized cell, expanding the light-harvesting region. Thanks to the use of SQ2 as a co-sensitizer agent for MAX157, it was possible to effectively cover the region from 300 to 700 nm without reducing the absorbance during co-absorption on transparent TiO2 film.
As a result, a slight shift in current and a clear improvement in voltage were observed for MAX157 & SQ2-sensitized solar cells as shown in Table 4 and Fig. 6. The JSC value upon cosensitization with SQ2 was able to increase from 12.02 mA cm−2 to 12.38 mA cm−2, while the VOC value – from 0.58 mV to 0.62 mV, suggesting better blocking of recombination of electrons in the titania with the electrolyte. The overall efficiency for cosensitization was 10% higher, from 5.20% for the individual MAX157 dye to 5.80% when using the co-sensitized system.

Melting points are uncorrected and were obtained by a Kofler hot-stage apparatus. 1H NMR (300.1 MHz) and 13C NMR (75.5 MHz) spectra were obtained by a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer with TMS as the standard in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 solutions. The coupling constant (J) values are reported in Hertz (Hz). MS spectra were taken with a Finnigan MAT INCOS 50 instrument (EI, 70 eV). High-resolution MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF II instrument with ionization by electrospray (ESI†). The measurement was operated in a negative ion mode (3200 V) or in a positive ion mode (interface capillary voltage −4500 V); mass range: m/z 50–3000 Da; internal or external calibration was made with Electrospray Calibrant Solution (Fluka). For solutions in methanol, water, or acetonitrile a syringe injection was used (flow rate 3 mL·min−1). As a dry gas nitrogen was applied; interface temperature – 180 °C. IR spectra were recorded in KBr pellets on a Specord M-80 instrument.
3.3. General procedure for fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
Clean fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass substrates (7 Ω □−1, 2.2 mm-thick, TCO22-7/LI, Solaronix) were treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 30 min on a hotplate. Transparent and scattering TiO2 pastes (18NR-T and 18NR-AO, then Greatcell Solar, now Greatcell Solar Materials) were deposited on the treated substrates, one layer each, by screen printing. The TiO2 electrodes were annealed in a furnace at 325 °C for 5 °C min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min (ramp: 10 °C min−1), resulting in ∼8 μm-thick (4 μm + 4 μm) mesoporous TiO2 films. The films were treated for a second time in TiCl4 solution, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. The electrodes were immersed in the dye bath while still warm (∼80 °C). The dye baths consisted of 0.5 mM in ethanol with 5 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for MAX140 and MAX157, 0.5 mM in toluene/ethanol (7:3, v/v) with 5 mM CDCA for MAX114 and MAX155, 0.3 mM in acetonitrile and n-butanol (85:15, v/v) with 3 mM CDCA for SQ2, and 0.3 mM in chloroform with 20 mM CDCA for WS-2. A ‘dye-cocktail’ was prepared for the co-sensitization of MAX157 and SQ2, by mixing the aforementioned dye baths for each dye at a 1:1 ratio. The dye adsorption was performed overnight. For the counter electrodes, a platinum precursor paste (Platisol T, Solaronix) was doctor-bladed on clean FTO glass substrates and fired at 450 °C for 10 minutes. The anode and cathode were assembled with a 25 μm-thick thermoplastic gasket (Surlyn, DuPont), and the electrolyte was injected under vacuum through a predrilled hole in the cathode. The electrolyte in our study consisted of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M iodine and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in anhydrous acetonitrile.
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded on a potentiostat (Autolab, Metrohm) equipped with AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight as light source, generated by a class AAA solar simulator (SLB300A, Sciencetech). The intensity of the incident light was calibrated with a Si reference cell. The active area of the solar cell was fixed to 0.0625 cm2 by a black metal mask.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Bentham PVE300 EQE/IQE system in DC mode. The incident light was calibrated with a Si reference photodiode.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a similar setup to the J–V measurements. The signal was recorded with an Autolab potentiostat, where the AC voltage was set to an amplitude of 10 mV and the frequency was ranged from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The DSSCs were tested at VOC under AM1.5G illumination.
3.4. Optical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco V-670 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer controlled with SpectraManager software. The solution UV-vis samples were prepared as 1 × 10−5 M toluene/ethanol (7:3, v/v) solutions in a 1 cm quartz cell. Solid UV-vis samples were prepared by adsorbing the dyes onto 4 μm-thick transparent TiO2 films on FTO glass. The reference was blank FTO glass.
3.5. Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using an IPC-Pro potentiostat (Econix, Russia) according to a three-electron scheme. A 0.1 M solution of Bu4NBF4 in DMF was used as the background electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum electrode, the counter electrode was a platinum grid, and the reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode connected to the solution in the cell via a bridge filled with a background electrolyte. The potentials were determined relative to the reversible oxidation potential of ferrocene added to the solution after registering the curves of the studied compounds. The solution was purged with high-purity argon to remove dissolved oxygen. The curves were recorded at a potential sweep rate of 0.1–10.0 V s−1.

4. Conclusions
In summary, three novel organic D–A-π-A dyes were synthesized from which the DSSCs were constructed. N-substituted indolines fused with cyclopentane or cyclohexanes were considered as donor fragments, and the influence of individual structural fragments on the optical and photovoltaic properties of new dyes was established. It turned out that regardless of the structure of the donor part, all dyes have a relatively narrow energy gap, and the position of EHOMO and ELUMO is suitable for the effective use of these dyes in solar cells. Taking MAX140 as an example, DSSCs employing the MAX series were found to be relatively stable under normal operating conditions for 10 weeks. It was shown that, in the case of derivatives 2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-carbazole, replacement of the p-tolyl substituent at the N atom (dye MAX114) by 2-ethylhexyl (dye MAX157) leads to a short-wavelength shift of the absorption maximum in the ICT band and an increase in the molar extinction coefficient. Solar cells based on this dye showed a maximum efficiency of 5.2%, which was increased to 5.8% using the co-sensitization technique with SQ2 dye as co-sensitizer. Thus, we have shown that even a slight change in the structure of individual structural fragments of D–A-π-A dyes has a significant effect on the optical and photovoltaic properties, which is often impossible to predict based on existing theories.

Design, System, Application
We have designed and newly synthesized the series of D-A-π-A organic sensitizers with N-substituted indolines fused with cyclopentane or cyclohexane as donor (D) building block. The influence of structural fragments of donor moieties of the dyes on the optical and photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been demonstrated. Comparison of donor N-substituted indolines fused with cyclopentane or cyclohexanes revealed that the introduction of only one additional CH2 group into the alicyclic fragment fused with indoline leads to hypsochromic shifts of the ICT absorption maximum and increasing of the molar extinction coefficient. At the same time, the replacement of N-aryl substituent to branch alkyl chain in indoline part increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) especially when the co-sensitization technique is using. It was demostrated that even a slight change in the structure of individual structural fragments of dyes has a significant effect on the optical and photovoltaic properties of DCCSs and deeper understanding the problem of the structure–property relationship was achieved.
