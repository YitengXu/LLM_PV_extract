    , Accepted 14th August 2015First published on 17th August 2015AbstractTiO2 nanorods were synthesized by hydrothermal methods with ethanol–HCl and water–HCl solutions, respectively, and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells based on them were fabricated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the best solar cells based on TiO2 nanorods with water–HCl solution is higher than that with ethanol–HCl solution. The dimensions, morphology, optical properties, and photogenerated charge behavior of the two kinds of samples were investigated. The results indicate that the better performance of solar cells based on TiO2 nanorods with water–HCl solution than those with ethanol–HCl solution could be attributed to their special orientation, high conductivity, improved morphology, good optical properties, fast charge transfer and reduced charge recombination. A PCE of 11.8% was achieved using TiO2 nanorods with water–HCl solution, which is the highest among the reported TiO2 nanorod based cells.
Introduction
Since the first report of CH3NH3PbI3 based solid-state solar cells in 2012,1 organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable attention due to their special properties, such as large absorption coefficient, electron–hole diffusion length, and high charge carrier mobility.2–9 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has been over 20%.10 In general, perovskite solar cells are constructed with a perovskite layer sandwiched between an electron transfer material (ETM) layer and a hole transfer material (HTM) layer. Mesoporous TiO2 has been used as the ETM in most of the perovskite solar cells.11–14 However, the main issue is the difficulty in pore filling for the mesoporous structure.15 Compared with the mesoporous structure, the one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure has some advantages, such as easy pore filling of the active layer or HTM, better electron transfer and lower charge recombination.16,17
Rutile TiO2 nanorods (NRs) have been widely applied in perovskite solar cells.18–22 Among the synthesis methods of TiO2 NRs, hydrothermal synthesis has been usually adopted due to the low temperature and no requirement of expensive apparatus. For the hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 NRs, Ti precursors are dissolved in water–HCl solution in some reports,18–21 while in ethanol–HCl solution in others.22 However, the effect of solvents (ethanol and water) on the growth of TiO2 NRs and their perovskite solar cell performance is not clear.
Therefore, in the present study, we synthesized TiO2 NRs by both the methods. The dimensions of TiO2 NRs, including the length, diameter, and density, were controlled by adjusting the growth time. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) perovskite solar cells were fabricated using TiO2 NRs as an ETM layer. The characteristics of TiO2 NRs and their perovskite solar cell performance were investigated. The effect of solvents on the growth of TiO2 NRs and their perovskite solar cell performance was discussed. By optimizing the parameters, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.8% was achieved for perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 nanorods with water–HCl solution.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 NRs grown on FTO glass substrates. The diffraction peaks at 26.6°, 38.0°, and 51.6° were assigned to the (110), (200), and (211) planes of SnO2 (JCPDS card, 41-1445) on the FTO substrate, respectively. The diffraction peaks at 36.2° and 62.8° were assigned to the (101) and (002) planes of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS, 21-1276), respectively,23 which indicate that the TiO2 NR films have (101) and (002) planes. The peak intensity ratio of (002) and (101), I(002)/I(101), is 89.1 for TiO2 NRs (e), which suggests that crystallites grew preferentially along the (002) plane parallel to the substrate surface. While only the (101) peak appears in the XRD pattern of TiO2 NRs (w), which indicates almost all the crystals grew along the (101) plane parallel to the substrate surface.24

The dimensions of the TiO2 NRs, such as the length, diameter, and density, were changed by adjusting the growth time in the autoclave. MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells were fabricated using the as-made TiO2 NRs. The relationship between the photovoltaic performance of solar cells and the growth time was investigated. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) on the growth time. The PCE of solar cells increases firstly, and then decreases with the increase of growth time, which reaches the maximum at the growth times of 60 min and 120 min for TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w), respectively. The average PCEs of the solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w) with the optimal growth times are 7.5% and 10.5%, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of the best solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w). The short current (Jsc), open voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were obtained from J–V curves averaged with reverse and forward bias sweep. The PCEs of the best solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w) are 8.6% and 11.8%, respectively. Moreover, the Jsc, Voc, and FF of solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) are larger than those on TiO2 NRs (e). Fig. 4 shows the IPCE of perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) and TiO2 NRs (e). The integrated Jsc values calculated from IPCE data are 18.9 and 21.0 mA cm−2 for cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w), respectively. The IPCE in the entire wavelength range and the calculated Jsc of the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) are larger than those based on TiO2 NRs (e), which agree with the J–V measurements.

XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 display that the TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w) are highly ordered nanorods with (002) and (101) facets exposed on top, respectively. It was reported that the (101) facet of rutile TiO2 is a more reactive facet than other facets due to its low energy vacancy formation energy.25 The better performance of perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) than those based on TiO2 NRs (e) could be due to the reactive (101) facet.
To further get insights into this phenomenon, some investigations were performed. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were calculated from illuminated J–V curves converging to Voc and Jsc, respectively. A reduced Rs of 5.80 Ω cm2 of TiO2 NR (w) based cells was observed compared to TiO2 NR (e) based cells (8.65 Ω cm2), implying the superior charge transport ability of TiO2 NRs (w). Moreover, the shunt resistance (1.15 kΩ cm2) of TiO2 NR (w) based cells was larger than that of TiO2 NR (e) based cells (0.35 kΩ cm2), which indicates that carrier recombination could be more efficiently reduced for the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w).

Fig. 5a and c show the plane-view and cross-sectional SEM images of TiO2 NR (e) films for 60 min growth, and Fig. 5b and d show those of TiO2 NR (w) films for 120 min growth. The dimensions of the TiO2 NRs (e) were determined to be 53 ± 8 nm wide and 1.9 ± 0.1 μm long, and those of TiO2 NRs (w) were determined to be 32 ± 5 nm wide and 0.5 ± 0.05 μm long. It indicates that the growth rate of TiO2 NRs (e) is larger than that of TiO2 NRs (w). The TiO2 NRs (w) are homogeneous and vertically aligned on the substrate, while the TiO2 NRs (e) display a reduced degree of order and alignment. Fig. 5e and f show the cross-sectional SEM images of the best solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w), respectively. The top Au electrode is separated from the photoanode. The pores of the nanorods are filled by MAPbI3−xClx, on which a capping layer of perovskite was formed. The thickness of the capping layer of the cell based on TiO2 NRs (w) is uniform in the view, while that based on TiO2 NRs (e) is inhomogeneous, which could be due to the different dimensions of TiO2 NR films shown in Fig. 5a and b. The spiro-OMeTAD layer is well separated by the capping layer from nanorod films in the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w), compared with those based on TiO2 NRs (e). The possibility of the HTM layer to contact with the TiO2 NR (w) film directly is smaller than that with TiO2 NRs (e), which decreases the electron–hole recombination.

Fig. 6A shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx and TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx. The diffraction peaks at 14.2° and 28.6° are assigned to the (110) and (220) planes of MAPbI3−xClx, respectively.26 There is no difference in the crystal structure of the MAPbI3−xClx layer grown on these two kinds of TiO2 NRs. Fig. 6B shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx and TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx. It demonstrated that the perovskite MAPbI3−xClx presents a good light-harvesting capability over the visible to near-IR spectrum. The absorption intensity of TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx is larger than that of TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx in the 430–580 nm range which could be due to the effect of TiO2 NRs (Fig. 6B, inset). The absorption difference between TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w) could be due to the different properties, such as orientation, length, diameter, and density. Compared with TiO2 NRs (e), TiO2 NRs (w) appear as a loosely aligned array as shown in Fig. 5. In particular, for a loosely aligned array, the incident light can be multi-reflected between nanorods, promoting the absorption intensity of the film.25

To get some information on the charge dissociation and recombination processes, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed. Fig. 7A shows the normalized PL spectra of FTO/MAPbI3−xClx, FTO/TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx, and FTO/TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx. The photoluminescence peak at 780 nm is consistent with the previously reported emission from MAPbI3−xClx.27 From the PL intensity, there is a substantial quenching effect when the perovskite layer comes into contact with TiO2 nanorod films. The PL quenching with the TiO2 NRs (w) is more dramatic than that with TiO2 NRs (e), which indicates that TiO2 NRs (w) are more effective than TiO2 NRs (e) for electron extraction. Fig. 7B shows the TRPL of spectra of FTO/MAPbI3−xClx, FTO/TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx, and FTO/TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx. The TRPL curve was fitted to a biexponential function (eqn (1)), (1)

The detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. The fast decay (τ1) could have originated from the transportation of free carriers from the perovskite layer to the respective hole or electron contact. The slow decay (τ2) could be attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers before the charge collection.28–30 For the sample of FTO/MAPbI3−xClx, the slow decay time is 188.90 ns, which agrees with that reported in the literature.27,31 For the sample of FTO/TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx, the fast decay time is 40.03 ns with a fraction of 32.23%, and the slow decay time is 111.30 ns with a fraction of 67.77%. In contrast, for the sample of FTO/TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx, the fast decay time (28.47 ns) and slow decay time (103.50 ns) were both shortened, and the fraction of the fast decay process (41.20%) increased. This indicates that the charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the TiO2 nanorod film for the TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx junction is faster than that for the TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx junction, and the charge recombination of TiO2 NRs (w)/MAPbI3−xClx is more reduced than that of TiO2 NRs (e)/MAPbI3−xClx.

Based on the IPCE theory, IPCE = ηlh × ηe-inj × ηh-inj × ηcc, where ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency, ηe-inj is the electron injection efficiency, ηh-inj is the hole injection efficiency, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency. ηh-inj and ηcc are considered to be similar because the HTM layer and metal electrodes are identical. The UV-vis absorption indicates that ηlh of the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) is larger than those based on TiO2 NRs (e). The PL and TRPL suggest that ηe-inj of the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) is higher than those based on TiO2 NRs (e). Therefore, the higher photovoltaic performance of TiO2 NR (w) based cells is due to their larger light harvesting efficiency and electron injection efficiency.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique to evaluate the charge transfer behavior in solar cells.32 EIS of FTO/TiO2 NRs/MAPbI3−xClx/spiro-MeOTAD/Au solar cells was performed. Fig. 8A shows the Nyquist plots of the cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w), in which two RC arcs were observed. The data were fitted to a simple equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 8B. The high-frequency RC element is attributed to the contact resistance (Rco) at the interfaces, while the low-frequency element is ascribed to the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the system, and Rs is an additional contribution from series resistance.19,33 The values of fitting parameters are listed in Table 2. The contact resistance (Rco) and total series resistance (Rs + Rco) for the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) are smaller than those based on TiO2 NRs (e), while the recombination resistance (Rrec) of those based on TiO2 NRs (w) is larger than those based on TiO2 NRs (e), which indicates an enhanced charge transport ability and induced carrier recombination rate for the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w). This agrees well with the J–V measurements.

The stability of solar cells is an important parameter for their applications. Therefore, the air stability of the cells based on TiO2 NRs was investigated. Fig. 9 shows the air stability as a function of storage time under ambient conditions without encapsulation. Both the solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w) degraded gradually under these conditions, while the average degradation rate of TiO2 NR (w) based cells was slower than that of TiO2 NRs (e) based cells.
 Fig. 9  Normalized PCE as a function of storage time for the cells based on TiO2 NRs exposed to ambient air without encapsulation. 
By optimizing the parameters, we achieved the PCE as high as 11.8% for the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells based on the TiO2 NRs (w). In the reported perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 NRs, the highest PCE of the cells is 11.1%.34 The CH3NH3PbI3 was usually adopted as an active layer in most of the TiO2 NR based perovskite solar cells,18–20 while the MAPbI3−xClx was chosen as the absorber layer in the present study. The energy band diagrams of TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3−xClx, and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 10 according to the literature studies.1,35 The conduction band of MAPbI3−xClx is located at −3.75 eV relative to the absolute vacuum scale (AVS), which is higher than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV vs. AVS). The conduction band difference between MAPbI3−xClx and TiO2 is larger than that between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2, which is more beneficial for the electron injection from the perovskite material to the ETM layer.36,37 Therefore, the high PCE of the TiO2 NR (w) based MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells in this study could be due to the large conduction band difference between MAPbI3−xClx and TiO2 NRs (w).

Conclusion
In summary, TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w) were synthesized by hydrothermal methods with ethanol–HCl and water–HCl solutions, respectively. MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells were fabricated using the TiO2 NRs as an ETM. The performance of the solar cells was optimized by changing the growth time of TiO2 NRs. The PCEs of the best solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) are higher than those based on TiO2 NRs (e). To explain this phenomenon, some investigations were performed. SEM images display that TiO2 NRs (w) appear to have a higher degree of order and alignment than TiO2 NRs (e), and the thickness of the perovskite capping layer in the cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) is more uniform than those based on TiO2 NRs (e). UV-vis absorption spectra display that TiO2 NRs (w) have better optical properties than TiO2 NRs (e). PL, TRPL, and EIS spectra indicate that the charge transfer for TiO2 NRs (w) is faster than for TiO2 NRs (e), while the charge recombination for TiO2 NRs (w) is more reduced than for TiO2 NRs (e). A PCE as high as 11.8% was achieved for the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 NRs (w) by optimizing the parameters of TiO2 NRs.
Experimental
Materials preparation
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized using a previously reported method.26 Typically, an aqueous solution of hydroiodic acid (HI) (5 mL, 57 wt% in water, Aladdin reagent) was reacted with methylamine (CH3NH2) (12 mL, 33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Aladdin reagent) at 0 °C for 2 h with constant stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. Methylammonium was crystallized by removing the solvent with a rotary evaporator. The generated white powder was washed with diethyl ether three times and dried in a vacuum overnight at 60 °C. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CH3NH3I and lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 3:1 molar ratio at 60 °C.
The FTO-coated glass substrate (∼15 ohm sq−1, NPG, Japan) was patterned by etching with Zn metal powder and 2 M HCl diluted in deionized water, and cleaned by sonication for 15 min in detergent, acetone, 2-propanol, and ethanol, respectively. Oxygen plasma was subsequently used to treat the substrate for 20 min. A compact layer of TiO2 was formed on FTO by treating the substrate in a 0.2 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. TiO2 nanorods were grown on the compact layer by ethanol–HCl and water–HCl hydrothermal methods previously reported.19,22 In brief, 20 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid and 20 mL of ethanol or 20 mL of deionized water were mixed. Subsequently, 0.7 mL of titanium(IV) n-butoxide (99%, Aladdin reagent) was added. After stirring for 30 min, the mixed solution and a compact layer coated FTO substrate was sealed in a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner of 50 mL capacity. The sealed autoclave was placed inside an oven preheated to 170 °C for several hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the TiO2 nanorod film was rinsed with ethanol and deionized water, and annealed at 500 °C for 60 min. The TiO2 nanorod samples prepared with ethanol–HCl and water–HCl hydrothermal methods were denoted as TiO2 NRs (e) and TiO2 NRs (w), respectively.
Solar cell fabrication
The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the annealed TiO2 nanorod film at 2000 rpm for 60 s in an argon-filled glovebox. The sample was dried on a hotplate at 110 °C for 60 min. The hole-transport layer was deposited by spincoating a spiro-OMeTAD solution at 1500 rpm for 60 s. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide(Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Aladdin reagent) were added. Finally, a thin gold layer was thermally evaporated on top of the device.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a DX-2700 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation with λ = 0.1542 nm. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley 2440 Source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination from a Newport Oriel Solar Simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The active area was 0.1 cm2 as determined by a shadow mask. The J–V curves were obtained in air with a step size of 20 mV and a sampling delay time of 1000 ms. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined using a Qtest Station 500ADX (America). Morphologies and microstructures were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEM-7001F, JEOL). UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed with a FLS 980 E fluorometer (Edinburgh Photonics), using a pulsed diode laser as an excitation source. Electrochemical impedance measurements were performed under a forward bias of 0.6 V under 1 sun illumination conditions with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e, Shanghai CHI Co., Ltd) in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 300 kHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV.
