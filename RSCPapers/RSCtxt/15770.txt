    , Accepted 4th June 2013First published on 4th June 2013AbstractThe increasing global appetite for energy within the transportation sector will inevitably result in the combustion of more fossil fuel. A renewable-derived approach to carbon-neutral synthetic fuels is therefore needed to offset the negative impacts of this trend, which include climate change. In this communication we report the use of nonstoichiometric perovskite oxides in two-step, solar-thermochemical water or carbon dioxide splitting cycles. We find that LaAlO3 doped with Mn and Sr will efficiently split both gases. Moreover the H2 yields are 9× greater, and the CO yields 6× greater, than those produced by the current state-of-the-art material, ceria, when reduced at 1350 °C and re-oxidized at 1000 °C. The temperature at which O2 begins to evolve from the perovskite is fully 300 °C below that of ceria. The materials are also very robust, maintaining their redox activity over at least 80 CO2 splitting cycles. This discovery has profound implications for the development of concentrated solar fuel technologies.

Broader context
Efficiently storing solar energy in a chemical bond continues to be an engineering challenge. Many technologies indirectly convert solar energy to fuel, e.g., water electrolysis coupled to solar-electric power to produce H2. However, direct conversion of solar energy to chemical potential energy is preferred. One promising route to making solar H2 is a two-step thermochemical cycle operating at high temperature driven by concentrating solar power (CSP). Here, solar radiation in the form of process heat drives an endothermic water-splitting reaction that produces a H2 molecule. The conversion of heat to chemical energy is accomplished using non-volatile metal oxides as the working fluid in an oxidation/reduction cycle. CSP technologies for hydrogen production promise to be cost-competitive because of high conversion efficiency and simplicity of implementing the process. However, success is predicated upon discovering materials that operate more effectively than the current state of the art. In this communication, we demonstrate that perovskite-type oxides have the potential to revolutionize CSP fuel production because they exhibit high reaction extents at low reduction temperatures. And while we offer a single example of this superior activity, the amenability of the perovskite structure to modification heralds a vast composition space within which optimal materials can be designed.

Developing carbon-neutral, sustainable energy sources is necessary to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic carbon dioxide on global populations,1 especially as the demand for energy rises world-wide.2 One solution is to exploit solar energy, given its abundance and accessibility. The challenge, however, is to capture and store this relatively diffuse energy in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Currently, several technologies based on photosynthesis (artificial or natural) and photoelectrolysis are under consideration. These aim to produce H2 by water splitting (WS), CO by carbon dioxide splitting (CDS), or fungible fuels from biomass.3,4 An additional compelling approach rapidly gaining attention is the conversion of solar energy into fuel using solar-driven thermochemical processes.5,6
Thermochemical cycles rely on heat derived from concentrating solar power (CSP) to drive endothermic gas-splitting reactions, thereby converting solar energy directly into fuel.7 Consequently, these cycles have the potential to realize greater theoretical efficiency than methods based on photosynthesis, photoelectrolysis, or conventional electrolysis coupled to solar-electric.5,7,8 In addition, such processes are conceptually much simpler and require no input of electrical energy, semiconductor processing, separation membranes, genetic manipulation, or elaborate molecular self-assembly.3 An example of a WS cycle using cerium oxide is outlined in the following two reactions: (1) (2)where δ represents the extent of oxygen nonstoichiometry in the solid. In this two-step cycle, the oxide is first reduced (eqn (1)) on-sun at high temperature (T1 > 1500 °C). The oxidation reaction (eqn (2)) resupplies O atoms to the solid, liberates H2, and completes the cycle. The oxidation reaction occurs off-sun, typically at T2 < 1100 °C. Substituting CO2 for H2O, and CO for H2, in these equations yields the corresponding reactions for CDS.
A small number of non-volatile metal oxides have been proposed for this purpose and in general fall into three categories based on the type of solid state process that results in reduction: nonstoichiometric oxygen loss,9,10 solid solution decomposition,5,11,12 and displacement reaction.13,14 Undoped ceria (CeO2) is a prototypical nonstoichiometric oxide with fast redox kinetics. However, very high temperatures (T1 > 1500 °C) are necessary to achieve the extent of oxygen deficiency required for efficient fuel production. Conversely, ferrite solid solutions undergo deep reduction at 1400 °C, but the kinetics are slow15,16 and ferrites must be combined with an oxygen-conducting refractory ceramic to prevent sintering and maintain high redox magnitudes.12,17 Although reactive structures formed through nano-engineering methods can dramatically increase ferrite reaction rates, nanostructural instability above 700 °C limits their usefulness.18 Here, we describe the discovery of novel perovskite compounds that achieve much higher oxygen deficiencies than reduced ceria (CeO2−δ) at lower T1, exhibit WS and CDS kinetics similar to ceria, and do not deactivate during the course of 80 redox cycles.
Perovskite oxides (ABO3) are a diverse class of materials that are largely unexplored for solar fuel applications. We synthesized single-phase powders of SrxLa1−xMnyAl1−yO3−δ (labelled SLMA1-3, see Abbreviations for each of the three compositions) by a modified Pechini method (see ESI† for details). Our approach was to derive a redox-active structure from a perovskite that is stable under both oxidizing and reducing environments, such as LaAlO3, in which both cations maintain a single oxidation state. We sought to introduce redox activity and tolerance for oxygen nonstoichiometry by doping Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ on the B-site and Sr2+ on the A-site. Using a stagnation flow reactor (SFR)14,15,18 equipped with a 500 W near-infrared laser for rapid sample heating (refer to ESI†), we determined the oxidation rates of each material (SLMA1-3) and quantified their extent of reduction and cyclability.
A critical first assessment for material viability in solar fuel applications is to determine the extent of oxygen deficiency that can be achieved under conditions of rapid heating and constant oxygen activity. Presented in panel (a) of Fig. 1 is the oxygen uptake and release in SLMA3 and CeO2. Both samples are exposed to a constant 0.2 mbar O2 partial pressure in helium flow and heated at 16 °C s−1 to 1350 °C. A positive production rate indicates O2 released by the solid, and a negative rate indicates O2 incorporation. It is clear by the magnitude of the area under the SLMA3 curve (shown in parenthesis) that the perovskite is reduced to a larger extent than CeO2 under these conditions. Fully 8× more O2 is released and subsequently re-absorbed by SLMA3 than ceria. This depth of reduction directly equates to greater cycle capacity and hence potentially more efficient fuel production provided the re-oxidation reaction with water or carbon dioxide is sufficiently favoured. Moreover, the onset of O2 evolution in SLMA3 under a He ambient (O2 pressure < 10−3 mbar) occurs at temperatures 300 °C lower than CeO2, shown in panel (b) as ΔT1, which implies that this compound likely possesses a lower reduction enthalpy than CeO2. The data shown in panel (b) of Fig. 1 was acquired by heating the sample at 10 °C min−1 using a furnace. At the slower heating rate and uniform thermal environment, the powder sample is presumed to be equilibrated and therefore the lagging O2 onset temperature for CeO2 is likely not a kinetic limitation.
 Fig. 1  (a) Rate of O2 released and absorbed by SLMA3 and CeO2 as a function of time and temperature measured in a constant O2 partial pressure of 0.2 mbar. Samples heated at 16 °C s−1 between 850 and 1350 °C, then held at 1350 °C for 120 s. The total amount of O2 released in μmoles per g material is shown in parentheses. (b) Oxygen evolution at the onset of thermal reduction in 100 mbar He showing SLMA3 reduces at temperatures 300 °C below CeO2. 
Recently, the reduction enthalpy has been identified as an important metric for assessing the viability of candidate materials for use in CSP fuel production. In general, the magnitude of the reduction enthalpy establishes boundaries on temperature and pressure for which WS and CDS thermodynamic favourability is expected.19 Typical CSP conditions for CeO2 place this compound near the upper limit making it difficult to reduce but easy to re-oxidize. We find that the SLMA compounds trend in a better direction because a solar fuel production cycle using SLMA3 will operate at T1 temperatures well below those established for either ceria (1550 °C) or ferrite (1400 °C) without losing the ability to carry out reaction 2 at a reasonable T2 (800 °C). From a practical point of view this has important implications for reactor design and materials of construction.
The evolution of H2 (CO) when exposing the reduced SLMA formulations to H2O (CO2) at conditions typically used in CSP thermochemical cycles demonstrates that WS (CDS) is favourable. Shown in Fig. 2 are the H2 and CO production rates for SLMA1-3 and CeO2, measured during WS and CDS over previously reduced oxides. Nearly 9× more H2 and 6× more CO are produced by the SLMA compounds as compared to CeO2 when reduced at 1350 °C and oxidized at 1000 °C. We note that the SLMA compounds and CeO2 were re-oxidized under a constant flow of water or carbon dioxide that swept the product gas (H2 or CO) from the reactor. This created a condition that maximized the thermodynamic driving force for oxidation in the SFR because the ratio of H2O/H2 or CO2/CO was always greater than 100. We also note that the SLMA compounds produce more H2 and CO than CeO2 when ceria is reduced at 1500 °C, which is a more commonly reported reduction temperature (refer to ESI†).

SLMA1-3 and CeO2 thermally reduced at 1350 °C in He. The total amount of H2 or CO produced in μmoles per g material is shown in parentheses.

(La, Sr)MnO3−δ is widely used in O2 separation membranes or as a cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells. And the effect of oxygen activity on nonstoichiometry is documented.20 Therefore, we expected our SLMA compounds to exhibit redox activity. However, their ability to perform WS and CDS after thermal reduction is not well understood, nor are the effects of Al incorporation. WS activity after chemical reduction in methane was previously demonstrated using similar A-site compositions of (La, Sr)MnO3−δ and (La, Sr)FeO3−δ;21,22 also, a recent report of CDS activity over La0.65Sr0.35MnO3−δ has been published.23 However, to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of WS under thermochemical conditions, as well as a comparative assessment of the reaction kinetics.
Putting this discovery in perspective, prior efforts to improve the performance of ceria, which focused on destabilizing the crystal structure through doping and substitution, succeeded in increasing cycle capacity at a lower T1 of 1400 °C (notably for Zr:CeO2 solid solutions mixed with Y, La, or Gd).24 However, the reduction and oxidation reaction rates decreased significantly when compared to unmodified ceria. The enhanced H2 production also dropped 33% by the second cycle questioning the viability of this approach (data was presented for only 2 redox cycles making it difficult to assess long term trends). Moreover, the number of perovskite compounds that may exhibit WS and CDS activity is potentially many times larger than what can be explored by modifying the ceria fluorite structure.
Although decreasing T1 while increasing cycle capacity is significant, fast oxidation kinetics are equally important to solar fuel production because they directly influence solar conversion efficiency and ultimately govern reactor design.7,12 Therefore, we performed a detailed numerical analysis15 of the H2 and CO production rates for SLMA1-3 and CeO2 in order to compare the intrinsic WS and CDS kinetics (refer to ESI†). It is important to deconvolve the effects of dispersion, mixing, and detector time lag that are inherent to the SFR experiment from the observed H2 (CO) production rate transient in order to recover the WS (CDS) rate constant.15 Reaction rate constants (k0) for order-based processes derived from this analysis and the percentage of H2 (CO) attributed to them are presented in Table 1. The high quality of the fits to our data with these kinetic models is evident from the solid lines in Fig. 2. Unlike CeO2, the SLMA oxidation rates are governed by two mechanisms. The first is an order-based process (labelled F1 and F2 in Table 1) that explicitly refers to the exponent of (1 − α)n in the kinetic model where n = 1 or 2, respectively. This process accounts for roughly 75% of the H2 (CO) produced. The second is a diffusion process that generates the long tails seen in the product decay curves in Fig. 2 and is not listed in Table 1. Although it is beyond the scope of this communication to discuss why WS and CDS kinetic models differ between SLMA and CeO2, experiments suggest ceria does not manifest a diffusion limitation in our powdered samples. The WS and CDS rates for SLMA compounds are comparable to CeO2 at 1000 °C and 40 vol% oxidant concentration.

A final assessment of material viability for CSP fuel production is durability. Fig. 3 shows the results of a short-term durability study on SLMA2 undergoing CO2 splitting at T1 = 1350 °C, and T2 = 1000 °C. The constant level of CO produced during the course of this experiment is encouraging and indicates there are no fast material degradation mechanisms at play. X-ray diffraction patterns for the cycled material also indicate that SLMA2 retains the single-phase perovskite structure. This result is in contrast to a porous, monolithic ceria material that showed a rapid decrease in fuel production rate in the first 100 cycles,25 or the degradation after a single cycle seen in the modified Zr:CeO2 solid solutions explored by Le Gal and Abanades.24
 Fig. 3  Total amount of CO produced per a cycle for SLMA2. Material was reduced at 1350 °C in He (heated at 6 °C s−1), and oxidized in 40 vol% CO2 at 1000 °C. Dwell times for thermal reduction and oxidation were 15 min each resulting in a 30 min redox cycle. Note that this cycle time is 50% shorter than the cycle time used for the data presented in Fig. 2. 
Conclusions
In general, the WS and CDS rates for the three SLMA formulations we synthesized and characterized are comparable to CeO2, a material known for fast redox kinetics. In addition, these perovskites produce significantly more fuel than ceria at reduction temperatures well below 1550 °C and maintain constant activity for many cycles. This is key to market viability because materials must remain active for many thousands of redox cycles in order to avoid high costs associated with frequent replacement (e.g., assuming 5 min per cycle, 8 h per day, 300 days per year, 10 years material life equates to ∼300000 cycles). CSP materials must also have sufficient activity to achieve high process efficiency (solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency >20% on an annual average basis).8
Concern regarding process efficiency has been raised by Scheffe et al. in their recent work with (La, Sr)MnO3−δ.23 They claim that the LSM family of materials will likely lag ceria in terms of solar-to-fuel efficiency under most CSP conditions because they require lower oxidation temperatures (T2 = 127 °C) and large amounts of oxidant (H2O or CO2) to achieve favourable redox behaviour. This conclusion was based primarily on the need to heat LSM over a much larger temperature difference between T2 and T1, thus requiring more solar energy input per cycle than CeO2. However, assessing overall process efficiency is a complex proposition that must take into account the specific reactor design and method of operation.26 For example, it is not impractical to operate a solar thermochemical reactor using a large amount of excess steam, or even a large difference between T2 and T1, as long as the sensible heat can be recovered effectively. In addition, their assessment was based on analyzing a narrow composition space of hole-doped LaMnO3. In this study we have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve significant improvements in the redox thermodynamics, as well as a dramatic increase in the redox capacity, by tuning the perovskite composition (e.g., combining Mn and Al on the B-site). Further investigation into the structure–property relationship in this particular system may yield even higher performing compositions.
A tremendous challenge to advancing the use of thermochemical cycles for water and carbon dioxide splitting is the identification of viable materials. Commercial success is predicated upon materials composed of earth-abundant elements that can operate at lower reduction temperatures than current ferrite- or ceria-based systems. These materials must also have sufficient activity to achieve high process efficiency. The nonstoichiometric perovskite oxides described here are among the most promising thus far in this regard, exhibiting higher extents of reaction at significantly lower reduction temperatures than either ceria or metal-substituted ferrites such as NiFe2O4. We anticipate that the amenability of the perovskite structure to doping and substitution will open a vast composition space, within which even more effective materials can be designed that will accelerate realization of economical fuel production based on thermochemical cycles.
