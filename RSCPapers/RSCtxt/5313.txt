    , Accepted 10th July 2017First published on 24th July 2017AbstractThe fine nanostructure on the cicada wing of Cryptotympana atrata fabricius, which exhibits hydrophobicity and antireflectivity, is carefully examined. A promising strategy is proposed for facilely and successively replicating the natural functional nanostructure of the cicada wing onto polystyrene (PS) surfaces. First, a nickel replica with tapered nanopores is fabricated by combining electroless plating and subsequent electroplating with the natural cicada wing as an original template. Then, using microinjection compression molding, with the nickel replica as a template, the tapered nanopores are transcribed onto the PS surface, resulting in orderly and densely arranged nanopillars with a mean diameter of about 156 nm and a mean pitch of about 180 nm. The natural cicada wing and fabricated nickel replica are reusable. Interestingly, the PS replica surface exhibits a water contact angle of 143° ± 2° and a reflectance of about 4% in the wavelength range of 400–1000 nm. These results mean that the bionic PS replica not only inherits the nanostructure of the natural wing, but also its hydrophobic and antireflective properties. The mechanisms for the hydrophobic and antireflective properties are revealed via composite wetting interface and effective medium layer on the replica surface, respectively. The proposed fast and efficient replication strategy can be an excellent candidate for mimicking bio-inspired functional micro/nanostructures without complicated procedures and expensive materials.
1. Introduction
In nature, numerous creatures possess various excellent surface characteristics, resulting from the presence of almost perfect micro/nanostructures over a wide range.1 It stands to reason that the perfect surface is an ideal innovation source for novel materials, structures, methods, and tools. Examples include continuous water transport on the peristome surface of Nepenthes alata,2 structure-based color in butterfly wing scales,3 antifogging property of mosquito compound eyes,4 water-repellent legs of water striders,5 antireflective property of moth-eye and glasswing butterfly,6,7 self-cleaning of lotus leaves,8 and water pinning property on rose petals.9 Investigations on how to replicate these structures into new functional surfaces are coming to the forefront of research in the micro-nano manufacturing technologies. The artificial micro/nanostructures have an extensive application prospect, such as observing systems,10 solar cells,11 optical fibers,12 spectral conversion,13 droplets transport,14 and other promising applications.15–17 Great attention has been paid to mimic micro/nanostructures inspired by biological prototypes found in nature during the last few decades, such as compound eyes,18,19 antireflective hierarchical arrays,20 photonic crystal structures in butterfly wing scales,21 bionic nanopillar arrays,22 and honeycomb structured films.23
Cicada wings, as one of the typical biological prototypes in the field of bionics, possess remarkable properties, such as hydrophobicity, optical trapping, and bacterial killing.24–26 By virtue of an impedance matching mechanism, cicada has a camouflage ability associated with the antireflective function of the tapered nanostructure (TNS) on the wings to avoid itself to be captured. The TNS on the wings can be approximated as a set of multiple layers with a gradient refractive index between the substrate and ambience.27 In view of gradient refractive index of the multiple layers, light tends to bend progressively, and the reflection can be suppressed to a very low level when it hits the wing surface. Furthermore, the wing maintains a light weight state when the cicada lives in a humid environment because the TNS also endows the wing with a hydrophobic property. Zhang and co-authors used natural cicada wing as a bio-template and prepared an Au film28 and a PMMA film29 with cicada wing inspired nanostructures on film surfaces for the first time. Functional surfaces with cicada wing inspired tapered micro/nanostructures have been fabricated using various methods, e.g., hot embossing,30 soft-lithography,31 self-assembly,32 self-masked dry etching,33 and electrodeposition.34 The available studies mainly focus on the antireflective properties of the fabricated tapered micro/nanostructures. The mechanisms for the hydrophobicity and antireflectivity of cicada wings and fabricated surfaces with cicada wing inspired nanostructures, unfortunately, are still unclear. Moreover, either special equipment or complex control is required in the bionic replication processes, which limits the application of the bio-inspired micro/nanostructured surfaces with excellent functions. Therefore, successive and facile methods are needed to be proposed for replicating the subtle nanostructures from a bionic template.
To pursue facile preparation of the nanostructure with hydrophobicity and antireflectivity on a cicada wing, a strategy that combines electroless plating, electroplating, and microinjection compression molding (μ-ICM) is proposed herein. As a molding method that combines microinjection molding with imprinting lithography, μ-ICM is typically used in high-efficient, high-precise, low-cost, and large-scale production and is quite qualified for rapid fabrication.35–37 Using the proposed strategy, PS replicas with orderly and densely arranged nanopillars on their surfaces are prepared, which exhibit hydrophobic and antireflective properties that are inherited from the cicada wings.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation process
The overall process for fabricating the bio-inspired PS replica from the cicada wing consists of three steps: natural wing template pretreatment, nickel replica preparation (Fig. 1(1)), and PS replica preparation (Fig. 1(2)).

Step 1: Natural wing pretreatment. 
The wings of cicada Cryptotympana atrata fabricius living in the Henan Province in Eastern China were taken as the original wings. To ensure the efficiency and accuracy of replication, the natural wings were pretreated cautiously before using as templates. First, the wings were washed by ultrasonic oscillation for 20 min with deionized water to remove contaminants absorbed physically on their surfaces. They were then ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for 20 min to remove the stains, proteins, and fat that were stuck to the pillars.28 Finally, they were ultrasonically cleaned in deionized water again for 10 min to remove residual acetone, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 40 °C.
The cleaned natural wings were treated by sensitization and activation. The compositions and concentrations obtained during this are listed in Table 1. Specifically, the wings were first immersed in the sensitization solution for 10 min at 25 °C and then in the activation solution for 5 min at 25 °C. In the sensitization process, sodium dodecyl sulfonate (C12H25SO4Na) was used as a surfactant to improve the hydrophilicity of the wing surfaces. Therefore, the sensitization and activation solutions could fully penetrate into the gaps between the nanopillars on the wings, thus ensuring the nanopillars to be entirely covered by palladium chloride (PdCl2·H2O) in the activation solution. Then, the natural wings were dried naturally in air. The covered palladium catalytic nuclei on the wing could thus be used for the release of metal ions in the reduction reaction of subsequent electroless plating.

Step 2: Nickel replica preparation. 
To prepare the nickel replica, electroless plating and electroplating38–40 were used, as shown in Fig. 1(1). The compositions and concentrations in the used solutions are listed in Table 2. The aforementioned pretreated natural wing was fixed on a supporting glass-slide and then immersed into the electroless nickel plating solution with magnetic stirring at 150 rpm under 40 °C. The solution was adjusted to a pH value of 8.5 using ammonia water. Nickel sulfate (NiSO4·6H2O) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O) were used as main salt and reductant, respectively, in the electroless plating solution. After 10 min of electroless plating, the wing was taken out from the solution and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. A conductive nickel layer was deposited on the natural wing surface through the abovementioned electroless plating (Fig. 1(b)). Electroplating was subsequently performed with the conductive nickel-covered wing as a cathode and a Ni–S plate as an anode at 50 °C. A power supply (IT7000 DC Power Supply, ITECH Electronic Co. Ltd, USA) was used to provide a constant current density of 4 A dm−2 for the entire electroplating process. To guarantee the uniformity of the electrolyte solution, a magnetic stirring at 150 rpm was applied. After 120 min of the electroplating, a nickel layer (Fig. 1(c)) with approximately 400 μm thickness was deposited on the conductive nickel layer in the electroplating solution. After cleaning and drying, the nickel layer was peeled off the wing. At this point, a nickel replica (Fig. 1(d)) was fabricated.

Step 3: PS replica preparation. 
The bionic PS replicas were molded via the μ-ICM technology, as shown in Fig. 1(2). PS (grade N1841H, Hong Kong Petrochemical Co. Ltd) with a refractive index of 1.6 was used as the material for molding the replicas. The equipment used in the μ-ICM process comprised an 80 ton injection molding machine (KM80SP180CX, Krauss-Maffei, Germany) and a microinjection compression mold equipped with a temperature control apparatus. As a template, the previously prepared nickel replica was mounted on the mold cavity surface (Fig. 1(e)). In the μ-ICM process, the mold cavity was first partially filled with PS melt when the mold was partially closed (Fig. 1(f)). Then, the mold was compressed in the thickness direction to finish the melt filling (Fig. 1(g)). Finally, the melt was packed under the compression force and simultaneously cooled down.41 The molding parameters including the melt temperature (240 °C), injection rate (154 cm3 s−1), compression force (280 kN), and the mold temperature (100 °C) were kept constant. It should be highlighted here that the molding cycle of each replica was about 50 s. For comparison, PS counterparts with a smooth surface were molded under the same molding parameters without the nickel replica as the template.

2.2 Characterization
The nanostructures on the natural cicada wings and the prepared nickel replicas and PS replicas were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Nova NanoSEM 430, FEI Co., Netherlands) and atomic force microscopy (AFM; Multimode 8, Bruker Corporation, Germany). Prior to the SEM observation, the samples were coated with gold by ion sputtering. Quantitative analyses of the nanostructures on the used wings and the prepared nickel replica and PS replica surfaces were conducted using the Nanoscope analysis software (Version 1.6, Bruker Corporation, Germany). The element compositions of the nickel replicas were analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; Inca Penta FET x3, Oxford Instruments, UK) coupled with SEM. The stress–strain curve of the nickel replica was obtained using a universal testing machine (INSTRON 5566 UTM, INSTRON Corporation, USA).
The contact angles (CAs) and roll off angles (RAs) of droplets on the wing and replica surfaces were measured using an automatic CA testing apparatus (OCA 40, Data Physics Corporation, Germany). Both the CA and RA measurements were conducted at three different locations on the wings and the replica surfaces to obtain the average values.
The reflectance spectrum measurements for the wing and replica surfaces were performed using an UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer (UV3150, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment in a wavelength scope of 400–1000 nm.
2.3 Live subject statement
All the experiments involving live subjects were carried out under the guidance of the Laboratory Management Division of South China University of Technology and were approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. All the experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Nanostructure, wettability and antireflectivity on cicada wings
It has been confirmed that the nanostructure and its distribution on cicada wings are very important for their camouflage, antireflectivity, and wettability.24 The wings of the cicada Cryptotympana atrata fabricius used herein were carefully observed to reveal the correlation between their properties and nanostructure. Fig. 2(a) shows the digital picture of the used cicada that died of natural causes. The body length and spread of the wing are about 50 mm and 60 mm, respectively. As can be seen from the SEM image of the wing (Fig. 2(b)), orderly and densely arranged nanopillars appear on the wing surface. Detailed characteristics of the nanopillars on the wing can be found in the AFM image shown in Fig. 2(c). It is clear that the nanopillars, which have a mean diameter of about 160 nm and a mean pitch of about 180 nm, exhibit tapered structure, namely the TNS.
 Fig. 2  (a) Digital picture of natural cicada; (b) SEM and (c) AFM images, (d) wetting state of 4 μL droplet, and (e) reflectance spectrum on its wing surface. 
The aforementioned TNS on the cicada wing surface is closely correlated with its wettability and antireflectivity. Five droplets of about 5–8 μL dripped on the wing surface exhibit an evident hydrophobic wetting state (as shown in Fig. 2(a)), which helps the wing to maintain its light weight in a humid environment, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Quantitatively, a 4 μL droplet dropped on the wing surface exhibits a CA of 145° ± 2° and an RA of >90°, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The nanopillars were worn off the natural cicada wing, and the CA on its surface was then measured, which was 65° ± 2° (shown in Fig. S1†). It is because of the nanopillars on the natural wing that its wetting state is changed. This is one of the reasons why we chose the cicada wing for the research herein. Then, the antireflective property of the wing was measured using a spectrophotometer. It is found that the reflectance of the cicada wing is less than 2% in the wavelength range of 400–1000 nm that covers the visible wavelength (400–700 nm), as shown in Fig. 2(e). Apparently, this antireflective property helps the cicada to hide from its natural enemies in the visible wavelength range. This is another reason why we chose the wing as the bionic prototype.
3.2 Nanostructures of prepared nickel and PS replicas

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the typical SEM and AFM images of the prepared nickel replica. It can be found that tapered nanopores with a mean diameter of about 165 nm and a mean pitch of about 180 nm orderly distribute in dense rows throughout the nickel replica. That is, the nanostructure on the nickel replica is consistent with that on the natural wing surface shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). This indicates that the TNS on the natural wing is accurately replicated on the nickel replica with an inverse pattern by the electroless plating and electroplating. Moreover, by means of atom by atom depositing the nickel layer42 on the natural wing, the prepared nickel replica exhibits a smooth surface and sufficient strength. The EDS spectrum of the nickel replica (Fig. 3(c)) indicates that its main component is nickel (98.53%) and it also contains small amounts (1.47%) of phosphorus. The cicada wing is composed of chitin,25 whereas no carbon peak is exhibited in the EDS spectrum of the nickel replica, which demonstrates that the nickel replica does not contain natural wing residue and has high purity.
 Fig. 3  (a) SEM and (b) AFM images of nickel replica, and (c) its energy dispersive spectroscopy spectrum. 
The stress–strain curve of the prepared nickel replica is shown in Fig. S1.† The nickel replica has a tensile strength of about 215 MPa, which means that it can be repeatedly used. The nickel replica after ten cycles of molding was investigated for the further analysis of its durability. As can be seen in Fig. 4, no carbon peak appears at its EDS spectrum, which demonstrates that no PS residue exists on the repeatedly used nickel replica. Interestingly, oxidation occurs on the nickel replica surface during μ-ICM. The SEM image shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that the nanopores on the repeatedly used nickel replica still remain intact. Therefore, the nickel replica prepared herein is reusable.

The tapered nanopores in the nickel replica, which are inherited from the natural wing, are filled by the PS melt at a sufficient compression force in the μ-ICM process. Therefore, the nanopillars on the final PS replica are the inverse of the nanopores in the nickel replica. Fig. 5(a) is the SEM image of the PS replica at low magnification, which clearly indicates that the TNS on the natural wing is successfully transferred to the PS replica using μ-ICM with the nickel replica as the template. As can be seen from Fig. 5(b) and (c), the nanopillars on the PS replica possess a typical mean diameter of about 156 nm and a mean pitch of about 180 nm. To further characterize the inherited accuracy, the nanopillar heights on both natural wing and final PS replica surfaces were gathered from the AFM images (Fig. 2(c) and 5(c)), and the results are shown in Fig. 6. It is clear that the height histograms for the nanopillars on the PS replica and natural wing exhibit a similar profile, which demonstrates that the PS replica inherits the nanostructure on the natural wing with remarkable accuracy. From the above results, it can be observed that the nanopillars on the PS replica surface are consistent with those on the natural wing shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). Therefore, the nanostructure on the natural wing surface is replicated on the PS replica surface with a high fidelity by μ-ICM.

3.3 Hydrophobicity and antireflectivity of PS replica and relevant mechanism analysis
A 4 μL droplet dropped on the smooth surface of the PS counterpart exhibits a CA of 83° ± 2° and an RA of >90° (Fig. 7(a)). The nanostructured PS replica surface exhibits a CA of 143° ± 2° and an RA of >90° (Fig. 7(b)), which is very similar to those exhibited by the natural wing surface shown in Fig. 2(d). That is, the hydrophilicity on the PS counterpart surface is transformed to the hydrophobicity on the PS replica surface, which is apparently ascribed to the bionic TNS on the PS replica. The reflectance spectra of the PS counterpart and PS replica surfaces are shown in Fig. 7(c). In the wavelength scope of 400–1000 nm, the average reflectances of the PS counterpart and bionic PS replica are about 9% and 4%, respectively, which demonstrates that the bionic TNS on the PS replica surface plays a key role in its antireflective property. Thus, the bionic PS replica fabricated by μ-ICM not only inherits the nanopillars on the natural wing surface, but also its hydrophobic and antireflective properties.
 Fig. 7  Wetting state of 4 μL droplet on (a) PS counterpart and (b) PS replica surfaces, and (c) reflectance spectra of PS counterpart and PS replica surfaces. 
The mechanisms for the aforementioned hydrophobicity and antireflectivity on the PS replica are analyzed as follows. Fig. 8(a) schematically depicts the underlying mechanism for the surface wettability to a droplet. According to the Young's equation,43 the solid–liquid (γSL) and liquid–vapour (γLV) surface tensions attempt to make a droplet to shrink, whereas solid–vapour (γSV) tension attempts to spread out the droplet. For the smooth PS counterpart surface, γLV + γSV > γSL, due to the hydrophilic nature of PS, which means that it is energetically profitable for a droplet to spread on the surface rather than to shrink. Therefore, the PS counterpart surface exhibits a low CA (Fig. 7(a)). As for the PS replica, the upper portion of the nanopillars is easy to be impregnated by water, and air is trapped in the gaps between the nanopillars to form a stable air pocket that acts as an effective water barrier.44 Therefore, it is understandable that the PS replica exhibits an approximately super-hydrophobic wetting state (Fig. 7(b)). Moreover, the solid–liquid–vapour three-phase contact line drops in the gaps between the nanopillars, and hence a global solid–vapour composite interface on the PS replica surface is formed. The droplets are pinned on the tilted PS replica surface with a moderate surface adhesion force (F).36,45 Therefore, there is no doubt that a micro-droplet can be fixed on the PS replica surface because the F can overcome its gravity.
 Fig. 8  Schematics of underlying mechanisms for wettability and antireflectivity of (1) PS counterpart and (2) PS replica. 

Fig. 8(b) schematically depicts the mechanism for the antireflectivities of the PS counterpart and replica surfaces. When a light wave is incident on the PS counterpart surface, Fresnel reflection occurs because of the difference in the refractive index (n) between the PS (nPS) and air (nair).46 The n changes abruptly at their interface, resulting in a high reflectivity of the PS counterpart surface. The nanopillars on the PS replica surface can be approximated as a set of multiple effective medium layers having a gradient refractive index ranging from the nair to nPS. According to the effective medium theory,47,48 the effective refractive index (neff) for normal incidence passing through the nanopillars on the PS replica can be written as follows: neff2 = nair2f + nPS2(1 − f)(1)where f is the fill factor of the nanopillars, which is the volume percentage of the nanopillars on the PS replica surface herein. According to the definition, the value of f is considered as the area ratio from bearing analysis49,50 of the AFM image (Fig. 5(c)). The area ratios along the nanopillar height were obtained from the AFM image using the Nanoscope analysis software, and the result is shown in Fig. 9. Accordingly, the neff along the nanopillars on the PS replica was calculated using eqn (1), and its distribution curve is plotted in Fig. 8(b). It is clear that the neff changes gradually from 1.0 (nair) to 1.6 (nPS) along the nanopillars. Therefore, the PS replica surface exhibits an evidently low reflectivity than the PS counterpart surface (Fig. 7(c)).

4. Conclusions
The nanopillars on the natural cicada wing surface have a typical mean diameter of about 160 nm and a pitch of about 180 nm and play a key role in its hydrophobicity and antireflectivity. The orderly distributed tapered nanopores with a mean diameter of about 165 nm and a mean pitch of about 180 nm on the prepared nickel replica are the inverse pattern of the nanopillars on the natural wing. Applying μ-ICM, the nanopillars on the natural wing surface are accurately and efficiently transferred to the PS replica surface with the nickel replica as the template. The shape, dimensions, and distribution of the nanopillars on the PS replica surface are consistent with those on the natural wing surface. The PS replica surface exhibits a CA of 143° ± 2° and an average reflectance of about 4% in the wavelength range of 400–1000 nm; thus, both hydrophobicity and antireflectivity of the natural wing are well inherited by the bionic PS replica. Apparently, the composite water wetting interface and effective medium layer play a key role in the hydrophobicity and antireflectivity, respectively, of the bionic PS replica surface. The prepared nickel plate exhibits enough strength, and the nanopores on the repeatedly used nickel replica still remain intact. The proposed strategy provides a desirable, straightforward and facile nanofabrication route for mimicking bio-inspired functional micro/nanostructures.
