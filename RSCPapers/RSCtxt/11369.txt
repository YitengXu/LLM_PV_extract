    , Accepted 10th May 2023First published on 10th May 2023AbstractAlthough electrically conductive hydrogels based on conductive polymers hold promise for flexible and high-performance supercapacitors, it is still a challenge for such devices to maintain high capacitance with temperature change, especially under subzero conditions. Herein, conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) decorated with redox-active anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium (AQS) on the surface is homogeneously dispersed in a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) hydrogel, which reinforces the conductivity and the stretchability of the obtained AQS–PEDOT/PAA hydrogel electrode. Particularly, with the containing of the H2SO4 + KCl electrolyte, the hydrogel is temperature tolerant and endows the assembled supercapacitor with a wide working temperature of −30 to 90 °C. Due to the extra energy storage contribution of AQS, the device exhibits a high capacitance of 466.5 mF cm−2, a maximum energy density of 41.47 μW h cm−2 and an exceptional cyclic stability of 90% retention after 5000 cycles. Very interestingly, the AQS–PEDOT/PAA electrode shows a remarkable solar-thermal conversion, which significantly boosts the electrochemical performance of the device under subzero conditions. Under solar illumination, the device shows a capacitance enhancement of 39.6% at −30 °C as compared with the device in the dark. This work provides an innovative strategy to spur the sluggish performance of conductive polymer-based hydrogel supercapacitors for practical applications.
Introduction
In recent years, conductive hydrogel materials have attracted tremendous scientific attention because of their potential applications in flexible energy storage devices.1–3 The principal merits of conductive hydrogels include good electrical/ionic conductivity, structural flexibility, feasible chemical modification, high safety, and excellent adaptability to flexible electronic systems.1–6 Particularly, electrically conductive hydrogel materials can be directly used as flexible electrodes to fabricate flexible supercapacitors (SCs),7 which have achieved fully integrated multifunctional performance,4,8 with high stretchability,9 self-healing ability10–12 and simultaneous sensing capability.13,14 Within this context, to ensure the practical applications, it is important to produce wearable supercapacitors that maintain their high capacitance performance with changes in the operating environments, such as wide-temperature tolerance. However, the improvement of the energy storage capacity of hydrogel supercapacitors has always been a challenge so far.2,7,15 In addition, hydrogel supercapacitors are completely or partially incapacitated under harsh operating conditions especially at low temperatures,13,16–18 which largely restricts the application of hydrogel supercapacitors.
To enhance the capacitive performance of hydrogel supercapacitors, many efforts have been made in designing electrically conductive polymer hydrogels based on the conductive polymers (CPs), including polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).6,7,19 Such hydrogels possess the features of ease of handling, cost-effective synthesis routes and controllable conductivity, thus holding tremendous promise as high-performance electrodes. It is acceptable that the charge storage of CPs relies on the redox reactions, which is closely related to the anion doping/de-doping process on the interfaces.20 However, the conventional small anions (such as SO42−, Cl−, ClO4−, etc.) and the large organic ions (such as β-naphthalene sulfonate (NS−),21 phytic acid,22 porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives23,24) that spontaneously assemble onto the charged CP backbone upon polymerization are electrochemically inactive, which don’t contribute to the charge storage capacity but increase the dead weight of the whole electrode. To push the charge density limit of CP electrodes, an effective strategy is to utilize dopant counterions with redox functionalities in the preparation of CPs. For example, redox-active polyoxometalate25,26 and lignin polyanions27 have been applied to counterbalance the charge generated on CP chains and simultaneously function as electrochemically active species to replenish charge storage by faradaic reactions. Similarly, the small organic redox-active molecules, such as anthraquinone derivatives having special functional groups on the molecular skeleton can provide multi-electron redox reactions to modify the electrode materials for boosting the energy density of supercapacitors.28–30 Typically, the anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium (AQS) can dope with the conducting polymer chains through the –SO3− functional group, which can tune the morphology of conducting polymers during the polymerization reaction.31,32 This not only could promote the molecular-level hybridization of AQS and conducting polymers but also offer excellent hydrophilicity with aqueous electrolyte.29 Moreover, the immobilization of the AQS enabled by large steric hindrance molecules could form a permanent doping in the conducting polymer/AQS complex. The conductivity of conducting polymers in the composite electrode at the negative potential is weak, while the presence of anthraquinone will facilitate electron/ion transport at the negative potential, and the working voltage range of the composite electrode can be expanded.28,32 Despite some advances, so far, the boosting effect of the AQS on the electrochemical charge storage of the CP hydrogel electrodes and its contribution to the extra energy storage needs to be addressed.
On the other hand, for the hydrogel supercapacitors, it is worth paying attention to their environmental tolerance because the conductive hydrogels could dry out in scorching weather and freeze at sub-zero temperatures. Although the previous anti-freezing CP hydrogel electrodes can work under low temperatures,9,13,14 their capacitance performance severely attenuated due to sluggish ion and charge transport, which greatly limit practical applications. In this regard, it is critical to develop a cost-effective strategy to broaden the temperature tolerance range of the hydrogel supercapacitors. Solar energy is an inexhaustible natural resource that attracts the attention of the world. As a matter of fact, the incorporation of the PANI, PPy and PEDOT nanoaggregates into the polymeric hydrogels endow the material with excellent photothermal conversion.33–38 This will enhance the ion and charge transport in the hydrogel electrodes, and thus help in solving the problem of performance degradation at sub-zero temperatures. Therefore, developing CP-based hydrogel electrodes combining high capacitance performance with solar-thermal conversion can be a promising strategy for constructing anti-freezing energy-storage units.
Here, we reported a strategy to improve hydrogel supercapacitors by integrating redox AQS with PEDOT to form photothermal conversion hydrogel electrodes. The in situ growth AQS–PEDOT complex with excellent hydrophilicity enabled the complete mixing with acrylic acid (AA) monomer and the oxidant prior to polymerization. Consequently, a good AQS–PEDOT distribution in the PAA hydrogel scaffold was easily obtained. By regulating the molar ratio of AQS to PEDOT, the optimum AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 805 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2 due to the synergistic pseudocapacitance contribution of AQS and PEDOT. The assembled supercapacitor based on this conductive hydrogel not only can deliver an enhanced energy density of 41.47 μW h cm−2 and an exceptional capacitance retention of 90% after 5000 cycles, but also can work over a wide temperature range of −30 to 90 °C. Owing to the ability for photothermal conversion of the AQS–PEDOT conductive filler, the capacitance of the supercapacitor was greatly enhanced under sub-zero temperature conditions. More impressively, the device achieved an enhancement of 39.6% in capacitance at −30 °C compared with the device in the dark. This self-heating integration may provide new insights for constructing hydrogel electronic climate tolerance.
Experiment
Materials
Sodium anthraquinone-2-sulfonate monohydrate (AQS), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT, 99.5%), acrylic acid (AA), N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride (AIBA), ammonia persulfate (APS), potassium chloride (KCl), and iron chloride (FeCl3) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd (Shanghai, China). Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) was obtained from the Nanjing Chemical Plant.
Preparation of the AQS–PEDOT/PAA conductive hydrogels
The AQS–PEDOT conductive fillers with different molar ratio of AQS:EDOT were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization of EDOT monomer using ferric ions and ammonium persulfate as the redox initiator. Typically, for the sample with 1:5 molar ratio, 0.984 g of AQS and 2.13 g of EDOT were added to 140 mL of distilled water with magnetic stirring, then 0.128 g of FeCl3 and 4.24 g of APS were dissolved in 10 mL deionized water and then slowly added to the mixture and the polymerization was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 6 h. The product was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and dried at 50 °C for a further 10 hours to obtain 2.3 g of blue-black powder, and finally stored in a vacuum desiccator for further usage. The other samples with the AQS:EDOT molar ratio of 1:7, 1:3, and 1:2 were prepared using the same procedure, and the mass ratios of APS:FeCl3:EDOT were always kept at 2:0.06:1. Bare PEDOT without the AQS dopant was also prepared as a control.
Subsequently, 150 mg of various conductive fillers were added into a mixture solution containing 0.675 mL of AA, 1.75 mL of H2SO4 (1 M) and KCl (3 M) electrolyte, 1 mg of MBAA and 10 mg of AIBA, and then stirred for 2 h to uniformly disperse the components. Subsequently, the dispersion was transferred into a home-made mold and preserved at 60 °C on a hot plate for 2 h. The obtained hydrogel was called AQS–PEDOT/PAA hydrogel. For example, the resultant hydrogel with AQS–PEDOT (1:5) was called AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel, while the sample without the AQS redox additive was called PEDOT/PAA hydrogel. The sample without adding conductive fillers was referred to as the PAA hydrogel, which was used as the electrolyte layer in the supercapacitors.
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer Spectrum II spectrophotometer. A tensile test was performed on a UTM-4000 universal testing machine (Shenzhen Suns Technology Corporation, China). The hydrogel sample (25 × 3 × 1.2 mm3) was pulled by a 100 N load cell at a speed of 50 mm/min under room conditions (50% humidity). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out to analyse the anti-freezing behaviour of the hydrogel. DSC thermograms were obtained from a TA Q100 instrument heating from −50 to 20 °C with a gradient of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Netzsch STA449F3 thermo-analyzer heated from 30 to 800 °C with Ar atmosphere protection. The morphologies of the hydrogels were analysed under a HITACHI SU8100 field-emission scanning electron microscope. Samples were freeze fractured with liquid nitrogen and freeze dried. The fracture surface was coated with gold and finally observed at 3 kV. The conductivity of the prepared conductive hydrogel was estimated using a two-electrode method. The square hydrogel sample (1.0 × 1.0 × 0.12 cm3) was sandwiched between two platinum plate electrodes and measured on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. The conductivities were calculated according to the equation: σ = [d/(R × A)] × 100, where σ, d, R and A refer to the electrical conductivity (S m−1), the hydrogel length (cm), resistance (Ω) and area of the sample (cm2), respectively.
The light absorption of the conductive hydrogel was recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950. The photothermal conversion efficiency of hydrogel electrode was measured in open air with a xenon light source (PLS-FX300HU). The real-time temperature variation was measured using a flexible thermocouple (K-type 302K-2), and the infrared images was recorded simultaneously on a Fluke PTi120 infrared camera. The electrochemical performance of the devices at subzero conditions was obtained in a low temperature thermostatic bath in the dark and under the light illumination with 0.3 mW cm−2.
Fabrication and characterization of the supercapacitors
Flexible supercapacitors were fabricated by assembling two identical AQS–PEDOT/PAA electrodes (10 × 10 × 1.2 mm3) with a PAA hydrogel (10 × 10 × 0.5 mm3) into a sandwich configuration. Two carbon clothes as current collectors were pasted onto the end of electrodes. All electrochemical performance tests were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. The electrical conductivity was measured in a two-electrode system.39 For a three-electrode setup, a Pt plate was used as a counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode and 1.0 M H2SO4 + 3.0 M KCl aqueous solution as an electrolyte. The areal capacitance (mF cm−2) of the hydrogel electrode is calculated by the following equation: (1)where I, t, S and ΔV are the discharge current (mA), the discharge time (s), the electrode area (cm2) and the working potential (V) deducting the IR drop, respectively. The performance of the supercapacitor is characterized by the following equations: (2) (3) (4)where Ca, Ea and Pa are the areal specific capacitance (mF cm−2), energy density (in μW h cm−2) and power density (μW cm−2), respectively. And I, t and ΔV are the same as above mentioned, while S is the area of the single electrode.
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of the AQS–PEDOT/PAA hydrogel electrodes
As shown in Fig. 1, the oxidative polymerization in the presence of AQS using persulfate and Fe3+ readily afforded AQS–PEDOT complex in high yields, in which Fe3+ ions in small quantities first oxidize monomers to form polymers, and the couples of Fe2+/Fe3+ ions catalysed the decomposition of persulfate ions (S2O82−) into sulfate radicals (SO4˙−) that oxidize polymers together with Fe3+ ions.40 Typically, every third or fourth thiophene unit carries a positive charge41 that results in Coulomb interactions between PEDOT cations and negatively charged AQS and forms a stable AQS–PEDOT complex. Compared with the bare PEDOT, the AQS–PEDOT (1:5) complex exhibits high dispersion properties in aqueous solutions (Fig. S1, ESI†), which enables a good distribution in the forming hydrogel scaffold. The successful formation of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5) complex was confirmed by the FTIR spectrum and TGA characterization (Fig. S2 and S3 the detailed explanations are shown in the ESI†).

SEM characterization indicates that PEDOT without AQS doping presents irregular particles (Fig. S4, ESI†). In contrast, AQS–PEDOT composites consist of wrinkly flakes forming clusters with ridges, which is similar to the porous PEDOT prepared by utilizing a deep eutectic solvent of ferric chloride hexahydrate/acetamide to guide the polymerization.42 With the increase of the AQS dopant contents, compact clusters with larger size are observed while for the hydrogels, PAA electrolyte presented a typical porous structure with a smooth surface under high magnification (Fig. 2a and b). The PEDOT/PAA hydrogel has a disordered porous structure, and PEDOT aggregated in the hydrogel (Fig. S5, ESI†) while the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel exhibits a well-organized network without obvious agglomeration (Fig. 2c and d), confirming the good dispersibility of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5) composite. The pore size was reduced as compared with the PAA electrolyte, which could be caused by the AQS–PEDOT acting as a nucleating agent during the freezing process in the hydrogel.43 High magnification images show that the AQS–PEDOT nanofillers were firmly embedded in the pore wall (Fig. 2d). EDS mapping of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel (Fig. 2e, f and Fig. S6, ESI†) indicates the C, O, S atoms were uniformly distributed, confirming again that the conductive filler could form a percolated conductive network for electrical conductivity.

The AQS–PEDOT complex could act as reinforcing fillers and provide supplemental energy dissipation when under external force, thus enhancing the mechanical strength of the composite hydrogels (Fig. 3a). The PAA electrolyte shows the elongation-at-break of 764% at a strength of 91 kPa, while the PEDOT/PAA hydrogel exhibits a fracture strain of 1080% and a maximum stress of 60 kPa (Fig. 3b). The mechanical performance of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel was greatly improved with the tensile strength and elongation-at-break of reached 104 kPa and 1180%, respectively, meeting the requirement of flexible electronics. The better mechanical performance of AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA than that of the PEDOT/PAA hydrogel could be attributed to the homogeneous distribution of conductive fillers in the PAA matrix, since the aggregation of the PEDOT could lead to stress concentration and prevent load transfer to reinforce the polymer networks.44 The addition of the KCl electrolyte endows the hydrogel electrode with satisfactory anti-freezing properties (Fig. 3c), while the sample without the KCl was frozen at −30 °C. DSC curves indicate the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel has a freezing point as low as −35.7 °C (Fig. 3d), which will expend the electrode for anti-freezing applications. The conductivity (σ) of this hydrogel was initially indicated by the brightness of the LED indicator in a closed circuit. The LED was dimmed as the hydrogel was placed at −30 °C (Fig. 3e). Impressively, the conductivity of the AQS–PEDOT/PAA hydrogels is not only related to the feeding ratio of AQS:EDOT, but also varies with the temperature. As shown in Fig. 3f, the sample with AQS–PEDOT (1:5) fillers exhibits a higher conductivity of 0.71 ± 0.017 S m−1 than the other hydrogels, probably due to the better connectivity and a more ordered interchain packing structure. This conductivity was higher than that of similar conductive hydrogels, including the PEDOT/PVA hydrogel (∼0.95 S m−1),45 PEDOT/CMCS (4.68 ± 0.28) × 10−3 S cm−1,46 PPy-PAM/CS hydrogel (0.3 S m−1),47 (Ppy-PDA)/PAA hydrogels (0.39 S m−1),48 DA-PPy-GP hydrogel (0.07 S m−1),49 PVA-PPy hydrogel (only 0.06 S m−1),50 and PANI/αCD-PNIPAM (0.64 S m−1).37 However, the conductivity of this hydrogel was reduced to 0.022 ± 0.0025 S m−1 with the temperature decreased to −30 °C. A further drop to 0.0023 ± 0.0003 S m−1 was observed at −40°C due to freezing. The log(σ) exhibits a linear relationship with the 1000/T (Fig. S7, ESI†), demonstrating that the temperature dependence of ionic conductivity follows the Arrhenius behaviour with the activation energy value of 20.7 kJ mol−1.

Capacitance performance of the diverse AQS–PEDOT/PAA electrodes
A piece of our AQS–PEDOT/PAA hydrogel electrode (10 × 10 × 1.2 mm3) contained electroactive components up to ∼11.5 mg cm−2. Therefore, they are expected to show excellent electrochemical performance as flexible electrodes. Above all, the influence of the AQS:EDOT feeding molar ratio on the capacitance properties was systematically investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests in a three-electrode cell containing 1.0 M H2SO4 + 3.0 M KCl aqueous electrolyte. The corresponding results of the typical sample with a dopant ratio of 1:5 is presented in Fig. 4a and b, and the other samples with pristine PEDOT and 1:7, 1:3, 1:2 feeding ratios are given in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Comparative CV curves at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in Fig. 4c clearly reveal the shape evolution induced with the doping of AQS. In addition, the GCD curves at current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 presented in Fig. 4d show prominent voltage plateau stages in the potential range of −0.3 to 0 V, which confirms the significant contribution of the quinone redox reaction to the charge storage. Based on the discharge curves, the areal specific capacitance (Cs) of these electrodes was calculated and plotted as a function of current density (Fig. 4e). It can be seen that the Cs values increased upon the addition of AQS and the electrode with the feeding ratio 1:5 was found to have higher capacitance than the other samples. The maximum Cs value of 805 mF cm−2 was obtained at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4f), which is much larger than the state of the art.51–53 It maintains 495 mF cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, which is still 2.8 times larger than that of the PEDOT/PAA electrode (176 mF cm−2). The remarkable enhancement in electrochemical capacitance value could be related to the permanent doping state of AQS on the PEDOT chains due to its large size and steric hindrance (Fig. 4g). During the charge/discharge process, the AQS moieties can undergo fast two-proton (2e−, 2H) redox reactions between anthraquinone/anthrahydroquinone (AQ/AQH2),54 thus providing extra charge storage with redox sites. However, a pronounced downtrend in specific capacitance was observed when the feeding ratio of AQS–PEDOT increased over 1:5. This could be due to the poor conductivity of anthraquinone moieties,29 which has hindered the efficient charge transfer in the electrode depth; only the outer part of the electrode is active, leading to a capacitance loss. In the coming discussion, AQS–PEDOT/PAA electrode refers to the sample prepared from the feeding ratio 1:5 unless otherwise specified.

(g) Schematic illustration of impermanent doping with small anions (such as ions SO42− and Cl−) and permanent doping with immobile AQS. 
Subsequently, we fabricate an intrinsically stretchable supercapacitors based on the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA developed in this study. Two AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA electrodes and the PAA electrolyte were pressed together. Due to the self-adhesiveness of the PAA scaffolds, the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte is well combined (Fig. S9, ESI†). To reveal the AQS contribution to the capacitive performance, the PEDOT/PAA SC was also fabricated as a control. Fig. 5a and b show the CV and GCD curves of the PEDOT/PAA SC, respectively, which indicates the highest Ca of 210 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2. In contrast, the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC exhibits a much higher capacitance from the larger CV enclosed area and longer discharge time at various scan rates (Fig. 5c–e). The Ca value is calculated to be 466.5, 385, 350, 330, and 310 mF cm−2 at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mA cm−2, respectively. The capacitance retention rate is as high as 66.45%, which implies that this device has an outstanding rate capability. The extra energy storage contribution of AQS was investigated by directly comparing the specific capacitance of two devices. The capacitance of the PEDOT/PAA SC originates from the PEDOT in electrodes, while the extra capacitance of AQS (labeled by the diagonal line in Fig. 5f) could be estimated by deducting the contribution of PEDOT from the total capacitance of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC. The contribution proportion drops as the scan rate increases (Fig. 5g), which is predominantly correlated with the proton-exchange process. At a low scan rate, the protons have enough time to transfer between the electrolyte and electrode layers. Hence a higher degree of ionic intercalation occurs in the electrode material than at a high scan rate. Furthermore, the enhancement in capacitance at each current density is presented in Fig. 5h, which confirms the significant boosting effect of the incorporation of AQS into the device. Ragone plots of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC and the comparison with other reported supercapacitors based on PEDOT are presented in Fig. 5i. The highest energy density (Ea) is 41.47 μW h cm−2 at the power density (Pa) of 400 μW cm−2. When Pa reaches the highest 4000 μW cm−2, the Ea can also reach 27.56 μW h cm−2. The energy storage capacity of such a device is superior to many previously reported flexible hydrogel supercapacitors.14,55–62 A detailed comparison of the electrochemical performance AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC with the other reported advanced devices are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).

(f) Specific capacitance contributed by AQS at various current densities. (g) Contribution proportion of the PEDOT and AQS moieties in the device. (h) Enhancement in capacitance by AQS in the device. (i) Plots of energy density vs. power density. 
The cyclic stability of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC was further determined by continuous CV tests (Fig. 6a). It can be seen that the cycle stability curve declines slowly and finally remains at ∼90% after 5000 CV cycles. The reported activation process of the hydrogel electrodes that could induce a significant increasing trend at the beginning of the cyclic tests was not observed in our case, this could be attributed to the AQS–PEDOT equivalent to being immersed in the high concentration of the KCl + H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, these modified electrolytes make the SC operate well in a wide temperature range (Fig. 6b and c). Particularly, the SC even maintained good capacitive performances as the temperature declined as low as −30 °C the device preserved similar CV and GCD curves. Its specific capacitances retain at 222 mF cm−2 at −30 °C and 286 mF cm−2 at 0 °C, which are 48% and 61% of that measured at 30 °C, respectively. Impressively, the capacitance of this device was significantly enhanced as the temperature increased above room temperature. The maximum capacitance could rise to 766.5 mF cm−2 at 80 °C. The temperature-dependent capacitive performance was further confirmed by the EIS tests (Fig. 6e and f). It is explicit that all the Nyquist curves consist of a depressed semicircle in the high-frequency region, related to the charge transfer impedance, and a straight line in the low-frequency region, ascribed to the ion diffusion or transport in the electrolyte, also called the Warburg impedance. The intercept of the real axis represents the resistance of the electrolyte, which remains stable under various temperatures, except at −40 °C due to freezing up. Significantly, the slope of the spike decreases as the temperature decreases, revealing the ion diffusion was retarded gradually. However, the trend is reversed at 50–90 °C due to the unavoidable water loss of the device at high temperature conditions causing the ion diffusion sluggish again. Furthermore, the stability at sub-zero conditions was evaluated by cyclic CV tests, which shows an excellent temperature tolerance with a retention of ∼90.7% up to 2000 cycles at −30 °C. The performance of such a device was comparable or even superior to those of the flexible SCs reported previously in terms of temperature resistance and mechanical performance (Table S2, ESI†). Besides, the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC can withstand various compressing and bending deformations (Fig. 6h and i). The CV curves in each case were almost overlapped, which suggests the compressing and bending deformations bring almost no effect on the electrochemical properties of this device.

For practical applications, the performance of the hydrogel SC was tested in parallel and series connection by using CV and GCD measurements at 100 mV s−1 and 3.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7a and b), respectively. The single SC can only be used up to 0.8 V. When two or three SCs connected in series, the charge/discharge voltage window can be expanded to 1.6 and 2.4 V, respectively, with similar discharge times. While connecting in a parallel way, the output current and discharge time was increased by two or three times that of a single supercapacitor at the same current density, which could meet the high current requirement of electrical equipment. And Fig. 7c reveals the tandem device can activate a red LED light for almost 5 min. Significantly, one of the SC could be stretched up during the lightening up process (Fig. 7d). This demonstrates again the flexible AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC has stable electrochemical reliability for practical applications.

Boosting the capacitance performance under sub-zero conditions by photothermal effects
It has been reported that the incorporation of the conducting polymer nanoaggregates into the polymeric hydrogel enable the material possess the ability to absorb light and transform light to heat effectively.33–38 Therefore, it would be feasible that our PEDOT-based hydrogels could also exhibit photothermal properties. As indicated by the UV-vis-NIR spectrum (Fig. 8a), the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel has high absorbance from the UV to NIR region, thus endowing the hydrogel with high light-to-heat conversion. In assessing the photothermal performance, a fresh AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC was exposed under solar illumination in an ambient environment, and the temperature evolution was recorded simultaneously by thermocouple. It can be observed that the surface temperature of the SC increases dramatically which the exposure time (Fig. 8b), and reach a plateau at ∼37.7 °C (0.1 W cm−2), 48.4 °C (0.2 W cm−2), and 58.5 °C (0.3 W cm−2), respectively. Impressively, the cyclic illumination produces consistent and repeatable temperature rise (Fig. 8c), revealing the feasibility and reliability in photothermal conversion. The variation in the surface temperature of the supercapacitor during the irradiation process can also be visualized by infrared images, as shown in Fig. 8d. In addition, when conducting the measurement in a cold chamber at −30 °C, the temperature of the SC rapidly increases from −30 °C to −6 °C within ∼400 s irradiation and finally balances at −5 °C for a longer irradiation. Such an enhancement amplitude will improve the electronic/ionic conductivity, and thus enhancing electrochemical performance of the device (Fig. 8e).

(f) Schematic process of solar enhances the capacitance of the hydrogel device under sub-zero conditions. 
The electrochemical performance of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA SC at −30 °C cold chamber with and without solar illumination are showed in Fig. 9. It has been observed that CV curves under solar illumination are shuttle-like shape similar to those in the dark; however, they are much higher in current response (Fig. 9a and b), suggesting the same redox reactions but higher amounts the exchanged charge with solar light irradiation.63Fig. 9c compares the CV curves at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with that at 20 °C in an open air. Because of the significant photothermal effect, a much larger area with high current response was observed under solar illumination when compared to that at −30 °C in the dark, indicating the electrochemical performance is remarkably enhanced. Similar observations also could be found in GCD curves (Fig. 9d–f). Both charging and discharging time increase, corresponding to capacitance increase and internal resistance decrease. As mentioned above, the areal capacitance of the device was 466.5 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2 in the open air at 20 °C, while only 247 mF cm−2 (capacitance retention of only 53%) is obtained at −30 °C in the dark (Fig. 9g). However, the areal capacitance of the supercapacitor is clearly improved to 345 mF cm−2 at −30 °C with solar illumination, achieving an enhancement of 39.6% in capacitance compared with that in the dark. In addition, the capacitance retention is evidently increased to 74.0% of that at 20 °C in an open air. EIS analyses were conducted to further quantitatively evaluate the intrinsic resistance and relative pseudocapacitive performance under various conditions (Fig. 9h). Notably, under solar illumination, the device shows a smaller equivalent series resistance and charge transfer resistance than in the dark. Additionally, the more vertical line in the low frequency region indicates the much faster ionic diffusion because of the photothermal self-heating effect. The reduced internal resistance of the device under light illumination thus favours high-rate power delivery. The cycling stability of the device under these circumstances was investigated by CV tests at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The device shows a tiny decay in capacitance of ∼4% under solar illumination for 1000 cycles. In comparison, capacitance retention was reduced to 86% at −30 °C in the dark. Therefore, the photothermal conversion capability of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA electrode provides a simple and convenient route to elevate the electrochemical performance of the hydrogel supercapacitors at sub-zero conditions.

Conclusions
Redox active AQS molecules have been decorated on the PEDOT main chains to form a permanent doping structure. The AQS–PEDOT composite was imbedded in the PAA hydrogel scaffold to obtain a highly stretchable AQS–PEDOT/PAA hydrogel electrode. By regulating the molar ratio of AQS:PEDOT, the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA electrode can achieve an enhanced capacitance as high as 805 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2. With the containing antifreeze 1.0 M H2SO4 + 3.0 M KCl electrolyte, the assembled AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA supercapacitor can be operated reversibly in a wide temperature range of −30 to 90 °C and delivers a maximum energy density of 41.47 μW h cm−2 and a power density of 4000 μW cm−2 along with an excellent capacitance retention of 90% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, due to the photothermal effect of the AQS–PEDOT (1:5)/PAA hydrogel, the electrochemical performance of the hydrogel supercapacitor at −30 °C was significantly elevated under solar illumination as compared with that in the dark. This work affords a simple and convenient route to obtain hydrogel supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.
