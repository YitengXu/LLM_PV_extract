    , Accepted 3rd January 2013First published on 7th January 2013AbstractThe structural and interfacial design of TiO2 photoanodes plays an important role in improving the solar energy conversion performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, we report that a rutile nanowire (NW) array infiltrated with anatase nanoparticles (NPs) can combine the advantages of the one dimensional electron transportation and light scattering of a NW array and the large dye-loading capacity of NPs, due to the presence of a rutile–anatase heterojunction. The dye-sensitized NW–NP composite film (1.4 μm thick) with a roughness factor of ∼114.7 displays a significantly improved light harvesting ability than a NW array (roughness factor ∼28.2), as manifested by diffuse transmittance and reflection spectra, and even higher light harvesting than a NP film (1.5 μm thick) with a roughness of ∼414.7. Moreover, the dye-sensitized NW–NP composite film shows slower charge recombination kinetics than both the NW array and NP film, as measured by open-circuit photovoltage decay and transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the dye-sensitized TiO2 NW–NP composite photoanode exhibits 2.2 times and 1.5 times higher overall efficiency than NW array and NP film photoanodes, respectively, under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, demonstrating the synergistic effect of rutile NW and anatase NP for photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their potential low cost and high energy conversion efficiency, rendering them one of the most promising systems for solar-to-electrical conversion.1–6 To reach a high conversion efficiency of a DSSC, a key point to be resolved is the enhancement of the light harvesting efficiency of the nanostructured photoanode film. The conventional TiO2 mesoporous film photoelectrode can provide a large surface area for dye adsorption, however, because of the small size of the nanoparticles (NPs) used, the mesoporous TiO2 film exhibits high transparency and negligible scattering of visible light, resulting in a large portion of light shone on the cell being transmitted through the TiO2 film, instead of being fully harvested and utilized by the dye sensitizer.7 In order to better harvest the incident sunlight, many light-management strategies have been adopted recently, including employing a scattering layer8–10 and using photonic band-gap effects11–13 to augment the optical pathway in the TiO2 film, and consequently improve the DSSC performance. Besides maximizing light harvesting, another key issue is the improvement of charge collection efficiency by minimizing recombination pathways occurring at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface.14 Taking this point into account, photo-generated electrons injected into the TiO2 NP film meet with many grain boundaries and can easily be trapped during interparticle percolation because of the random network of TiO2 polycrystalline NPs, which will limit the cell performance.15 Alternatively, 1D nanostructures (e.g. nanowires (NWs), nanobelts, nanotubes) with high crystallinity are promising photoanode materials and are currently attracting widespread attention, since 1D nanostructures can offer a direct conduction pathway and fast electron transport along the 1D nanostructures, which can reduce the possibility of charge recombination and allow efficient charge collection.16–20 Unfortunately, 1D nanostructures with high crystallinity often display a much lower dye loading capacity than those of their NP counterparts, so the photocurrent output and energy conversion efficiency of simple 1D nanostructure-based solar cells are inferior to those of conventional TiO2 NP DSSCs. Considerable efforts have been made to extend the length of NWs to be comparable to the thickness of NP films, but the growth of long TiO2 NWs is usually limited by the current synthesis procedures.21 On the basis of the above consideration, the assembly of composite structures integrating NWs and NPs seems to be a promising strategy for the simultaneous increase of light harvesting efficiency and charge collection efficiency.22–25
In this paper, a rutile TiO2 NWs array–anatase NPs photoanode system is chosen and fabricated via a simple two-step synthesis process. The idea involved is to employ a rutile–anatase heterojunction, in which the conduction band minimum of rutile is lower than that of anatase,26 to combine the functions of anatase NPs for light harvesting and rutile NWs for fast electron transportation. Moreover, it is highly anticipated that a synergistic effect on suppressing charge recombination reactions at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface will be observed with the anatase and rutile composite structure, which is frequently observed in TiO2 photocatalysis as enhanced charge separation.27–29 Experimental results indeed show that the dye-sensitized NW–NP composite photoanode displays better light harvesting and slower charge recombination than both NW array and NP photoanodes. As a result, it exhibits 2.2 times and 1.5 times higher overall efficiency than its NW array and NPs counterparts, respectively, under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, demonstrating its potential uses in photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.
Experimental section
Tetrabutyl titanate (98%), titanium chloride (99%) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (36–37%) were obtained from Beijing Chemical Works. Hexachloroplatanic acid was obtained from Wako Chemicals. Anatase TiO2 sol (STS-01) was obtained from Ishihara Sangyo and was diluted to 0.43 g mL−1 with deionized water. N719 dye, chemical name cis-di(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium), was obtained from Solaronix. Anhydrous acetonitrile and valeronitrile were obtained from Acros. 1-Propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) were obtained from Heptachroma. 4-tert-butylpyridine was obtained from TCI. F-doped SnO2 transparent conducting glass substrates (FTO) were obtained from Nippon Sheet Glass (15 Ω □−1). The substrates were cleaned with detergent solution, rinsed with water and ethanol, and dried with N2 flow prior to film deposition.
TiO2 nanostructured electrode preparation
A rutile TiO2 NW array was grown on FTO substrates by the reported hydrothermal method16 with some modification. In a typical preparation, clean FTO substrates (1.25 × 2.5 cm2) were placed upright in autoclaves containing tetrabutyl titanate, concentrated hydrochloric acid and deionized water at a volume ratio of 1:40:40. The autoclaves were heated to 423 K and kept at a constant temperature for 8 h. After cooling down to room temperature in air, the FTO substrates were taken out of the autoclaves, rinsed with deionized water, dried in air, and annealed at 723 K for 20 min in order to remove any residual organics for the optimization of cell performance.
TiO2 NW–NP composite films were prepared by spin-coating the diluted anatase TiO2 sol onto the TiO2 NW array. At an appropriate concentration (0.043 g mL−1), TiO2 NPs (particle size ∼ 30 nm) could be infiltrated into the rutile NW array, driven by solvent evaporation without a change in film thickness. Afterwards, the NW–NP electrodes were treated with aqueous TiCl4 (40 mM) at 343 K for 30 min to improve the interconnectivity within the NW–NP composite films. Finally the composite films were annealed in air at 723 K for 20 min.
TiO2 NP films were also prepared on FTO glass substrates for reference by the spin-coating method. Polyethylene glycol (Mw = 20000, Wako) was added to the TiO2 sol at a concentration of 50 g L−1 in order to increase the viscosity of the sol. After spin-coating at 2000 rpm, the TiO2 films were annealed in air at 723 K for 20 min to remove the polymeric material, and treated with TiCl4 solution with the same conditions described above.
Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication
TiO2-coated electrodes were immersed overnight in a dry ethanolic solution (0.3 mM) of N719 dye at room temperature, and subsequently carefully rinsed with ethanol to remove unadsorbed dye. Counter electrodes were prepared by chemically depositing platinum from 0.05 M hexachloroplatinic acid in 2-propanol onto FTO substrates. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M GuSCN, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85:15). Sandwich cells were then prepared by clamping together the TiO2-coated electrode with the counter electrode. The electrolyte was then injected into the space between the two electrodes to complete the cell fabrication. In some experiments, sandwich cells were sealed with a transparent film of Surlyn 1472 polymer (Dupont Ltd.) at 383 K. The electrolyte was then introduced through holes drilled in the counter electrode, which were sealed immediately with epoxy resin to avoid leakage.
Characterizations
The morphology of the TiO2 nanostructured electrodes was observed with a FEI Quanta 250 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer. Raman spectra were collected with a Jobin-Yvon HR800 Raman microscope. Diffuse transmittance and reflection spectra of the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were collected on a Lambda UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Dye loading measurements were conducted by desorbing dye molecules from the TiO2 film in 0.05 M NaOH aqueous solution. The amount of dye molecules was determined by measuring the absorbance of the desorbed dye solution.

J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation from a Sun 2000 solar simulator (ABET Technology). The irradiated area of the solar cells was 0.13 cm2. Open-circuit photovoltage measurements were conducted with a PARSTAT 2273 advanced electrochemical system (Princeton Applied Research) and a high power white LED connected to a fast electric shutter. The cell was irradiated to a steady photovoltage under open-circuit conditions with the LED (50 mW cm−2), and the photovoltage decay was recorded once the irradiation was turned off. Transient absorption studies of the dye-sensitized nanostructured films were conducted with a LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer, in conjunction with a nanosecond tunable OPOLett 355II laser. The film covered with valeronitrile and a glass cover slide was excited at 575 nm, and the resulting photoinduced change was probed at 765 nm.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of TiO2 NWs grown on bare FTO. These NWs are tetragonal in shape with square top facets. The cross-sectional image shows that individual and uniform NWs are almost vertical to the FTO substrate, with average diameters of about 60 nm and lengths of 1.4 μm. The nanowires are single crystalline rutile with preferential growth along the (001) axis, as has been demonstrated in our previous research.30Fig. 1c and d are SEM images of the TiO2 NW–NP composite film prepared by spin-coating a diluted anatase TiO2 sol onto the TiO2 NW array. As shown, anatase NPs have penetrated into the root of NWs and fully filled the NW gaps, while the square top facets of NW are still visible on film surface, indicating that the film thickness remains the same as that of NW array.

The TiO2 NW and NW–NP films were further characterized by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The NW film displays an XRD pattern characteristic of the rutile phase (Fig. 2a). The enhanced (002) diffraction peak and diminished (110) peak indicate that these rutile NWs grow preferentially along the (001) direction. The NW–NP film, however, displays an XRD pattern indicative of mixed anatase and rutile phases. The peaks assigned to the anatase phase are broadened relative to those of the rutile NWs, due to the small size of the anatase NPs. Fig. 2b depicts the Raman spectra of the NW and NW–NP films. The spectrum of the NW film shows Raman active modes of rutile TiO2 (233, 448 and 612 cm−1) only, while the Raman modes of both rutile and anatase (145 cm−1) phases appear in the spectrum of the NW–NP film. Therefore, both XRD and Raman characterizations prove the formation of a rutile–anatase composite structure in the NW–NP film.

The loading capacity of N719 dye on the TiO2 NW and NW–NP films, as well as the NP film (1.5 μm thick, see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) were measured by dye desorption measurements after sensitization. The NW film adsorbs 2.9 nmol dye per cm2 of geometric film area, corresponding to a surface roughness of 28.2. Such a low level of dye loading seriously restricts the solar energy conversion efficiency of a TiO2 NW based DSSC. Infiltration of anatase NPs into the rutile NW structure significantly increases the dye loading to 11.9 nmol dye per cm2 of geometric film area, corresponding to a four-fold increase in surface roughness without a change in film thickness. The remarkable increase in dye adsorption results from the large dye-loading capacity of the anatase NPs, determined by their specific surface area and dye-adsorbed density. As a reference, the anatase NP film adsorbs 43.1 nmol dye per cm2 of geometric film area, corresponding to a surface roughness of 414.7.
We measured the sum of the diffuse transmittance and reflectance spectra of the dye-sensitized NW, NW–NP, and NP films in order to evaluate the light harvesting properties of these films. As shown in Fig. 3, the sum of transmittance and reflectance (T + R) is 37–78% for the dye-sensitized NW film in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 800 nm. The light loss around 800 nm is due to the strong light scattering of the TiO2 NWs, as neither the dye molecule nor TiO2 adsorbs light around this wavelength (see the spectra of bare TiO2 films in Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The light scattering characteristics of rutile NWs favor the harvesting of solar light by a dye monolayer by augmenting the light pathway. But because of its low dye-loading capacity, the light harvesting (1 − T − R) is still modest, approximately 46% at 520 nm. For comparison, the dye-sensitized anatase NP film shows a T + R of 32–89% in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, and a much higher light harvesting (∼65% at 520 nm) than the rutile NW film because of its 14 times higher dye loading capacity. Interestingly, the dye-sensitized NW–NP composite film exhibits the lowest T + R value, i.e. the highest light harvesting (∼66% at 520 nm) among the three films, although dye-loading on the NW–NP film is 3.6 times lower than on the NP film. This is attributed to the light scattering property of the rutile NWs in the composite structure, which can enhance the light harvesting by dye molecules. Therefore, we can conclude that the NW–NP composite structure improves sunlight harvesting by combining the light scattering ability of the rutile NW array and the large dye loading capacity of anatase NPs.

Fig. 4 depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) and power output characteristics of typical DSSCs fabricated from TiO2 NW, NW–NP, and NP films under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination. The cell parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 1. The NW device exhibits a modest overall efficiency (η) of 1.7%, lower than that of the NP reference cell (η = 2.4%). One of the reasons for the modest efficiency is the low short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of the NW device, which is only 4.4 mA cm−2, 80% of that of the NP device. However, if we consider that the dye-loading capacity of the NW film is only 7% of that of NP film, the Jsc as well as the η of the NW device is still remarkable. The NW–NP device, however, shows superior performance to both NW and NP devices. It exhibits a significantly enhanced Jsc, a higher Voc and FF than the NW device, and its η reaches 3.8%, which is about 2.2 times the efficiency obtained with the NW device and 1.5 times that obtained with the NP device.

The better cell performance of the NW–NP device is mainly attributed to the enhanced photocurrent output, which is about 1.9 times and 1.5 times that of the NW and NP devices, respectively. The improved light harvesting should be one reason for the enhanced photocurrent of the NW–NP device, especially when compared to the NW device. However, it is not the only reason, as the NP device displays comparable light harvesting to the NW–NP device but outputs a much lower photocurrent. In this regard, the NW–NP composite structure should also be beneficial for charge collection as well as light harvesting. In the NW–NP film, each rutile NW is surrounded by numerous anatase NPs. These NPs adsorb a major proportion of the dye sensitizer due to their large dye-loading capacity. Suppose rutile NWs can collect photoinjected electrons from anatase NPs, then the electrons in the NPs do not need to be transported a long way through the random NP network; instead they only have to travel a tens of times shorter distance to adjacent NWs and then pass through the single crystalline NW to the FTO electrode. Such a charge transport process is good for charge collection as it can both reduce the recombination loss during transport in the random network of anatase NPs and increase transport rate by taking advantage of the single crystalline NWs. Fortunately, rutile NWs and anatase NPs form a type II heterojunction at their interface, with the conduction band minimum of anatase being higher than that of rutile.26 The heterojunction therefore guarantees that the rutile NWs will collect photoinjected electrons from the anatase NPs, allowing the dye-sensitized anatase NPs to work like antennae to harvest sunlight, and the rutile NWs to work more like a charge collector.
We further investigated the charge recombination kinetics of the three kinds of DSSCs by open-circuit photovoltage decay, in order to better understand the effect of the rutile–anatase heterojunction. As a DSSC is illuminated under open-circuit conditions, electrons are injected from the dye sensitizers into the TiO2 film, and maintained at a stationary state which is determined by the balance between electron injection and electron back reaction at the TiO2 film–electrolyte interface.31,32 When the illumination is switched off, photo-injected electrons accumulated in the TiO2 photoanode will recombine with triiodide ions in the electrolyte, and as a result a Voc decay can be observed.33–35Fig. 5a shows the Voc decay curves of the three kinds of DSSCs as a function of elapsed time. The NW based device displays a slow Voc decay, and a substantial concentration of photoelectrons still remain in the cell even at an elapsed time of 240 s. The NP device displays a significantly faster Voc decay rate, which completes within 40 s. This observation is reasonable since the anatase NP film has much larger surface area and higher density of surface states, and therefore faster charge recombination occurs at the TiO2–electrolyte interface than in the rutile NW array. The NW–NP based DSSC, however, displays the slowest Voc decay, despite anatase NPs being involved. Fig. 5b illustrates the effective electron lifetime τn of the NW, NW–NP and NP devices as a function of Voc, which is determined by fitting the photovoltage decay plot according to eqn (1):34 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, e is the elementary charge and t is the elapsed time. At the same Voc, the τn value for NW–NP device could be 2 times and an order of magnitude longer than that of the NW and NP based solar cell, respectively, despite the fact that they have comparable scattering data distributions when Voc < 0.4 V, which is ascribed to the slow decay of Voc with the elapsed time.

The remarkable improvement in τn is a manifestation the positive effect of the rutile–anatase heterojunction on retarding the recombination reactions of electrons in the NW–NP film with triiodide in the electrolyte. One possible reason is that the heterojunction drives the movement of injected electrons from the anatase NPs to rutile NWs, which can effectively compete with the recombination process at the NP–electrolyte interface (path 1 in Fig. 6). Meanwhile, the electron-depleted anatase NPs occupy the surface of the rutile NWs, which also lowers the recombination rate at the NW–electrolyte interface (path 2 in Fig. 6). If the assumption is correct, the rutile–anatase heterojunction should also influence the recombination kinetics of dye molecules adsorbed on the anatase NPs. To clarify this point, we further recorded the transient absorption spectra of N719 dye on the NP and NW–NP film by monitoring the decay of the photoinduced absorption of dye cations (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). In the absence of a redox electrolyte, the decay can be assigned to charge recombination of the dye cations with electrons in trap/conduction band states of the TiO2 semiconductor (path 4 and 5 in Fig. 6).36,37 Again, the dye molecules on the NW–NP film, mostly on the NP surfaces, display much slower decay than those on the NP film, indicating the electron depletion in the anatase NPs by the rutile–anatase heterojunction.
 Fig. 6  Schematic configuration of our device showing the interfacial charge recombination processes occurring at the FTO–anatase NP–rutile NW–dye–electrolyte interfaces. 
It should be noted that the highly acidic conditions required for rutile NW growth may destroy the surface of the SnO2:F conductive layer and result in an unfavorable increase in the dark current of the NW device (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†), as a large proportion of the surface of the FTO substrate is not covered by rutile NWs. This may account for the usually lower FF value for the NW device than that of the NP device. The introduction of NPs into the free spaces of the NW array partly blocks the direct contact of FTO with the redox electrolyte, and therefore helps to reduce the recombination at the FTO–electrolyte interface (path 3 in Fig. 6). This, plus the reduced recombination at the TiO2–electrolyte interface, renders the NW–NP device with a higher FF and Voc than the NW device, besides the improvement in Jsc.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared a rutile NW–anatase NP composite film by spin-coating a colloidal anatase solution onto a rutile NW array. The presence of a rutile–anatase heterojunction at the interface helps the rutile NWa to efficiently collect photo-injected electrons from anatase NPs, reducing charge recombination at both the NP–electrolyte and NP–dye interfaces. These advantages, plus the improved light harvesting by combining the large dye-loading capacity of anatase NPs and the light scattering ability of the rutile NWs, render the rutile NW–anatase NP composite photoelectrode superior to both NW and NP photoelectrodes for use in DSSCs. As an example, a dye-sensitized TiO2 NW–NP composite photoanode, only 1.4 μm thick, exhibits a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.8% under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, which is 2.2 times and 1.5 times higher than that of the NW array and NP photoanodes, respectively, demonstrating the synergistic effect of rutile NWs and anatase NPs for photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.
