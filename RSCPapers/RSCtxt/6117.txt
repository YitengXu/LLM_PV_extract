1. Introduction
In recent years research efforts have focused on the investigation of unique size-dependent physical and chemical properties of the metallic nanoparticles (NPs) caused by NP–radiation interactions.1–117 The absorption of radiation energy by NPs, their heating, heat dissipation and exchange with an ambience, and the following thermal and accompanied phenomena induced by the laser–NP interaction have become increasingly important topics in nanotechnology.1–113 The advances in photo-thermal (PT) nanotechnology, based on the thermal effects and the processes induced by the laser–nanoparticle interaction, have demonstrated their immense potential.
PT nanotechnology is mainly based on the dynamics and the results of radiation–NP interaction and NP heating. There are numerous reasons for the interest including PT applications of NPs in different fields, such as absorption of radiation energy by NPs and light-to-heat conversion and applications in nanoenergy,1–63 laser nanomedicine, photothermolysis of single cells and photothermally activated drug delivery and release,64–77 PT chemistry and catalysis,78–88 laser processing of NPs (laser induced transformation of NP size, shape and structure),89–105 and PT imaging and sensing,106–113 etc. The prospects of NP applications in PT nanotechnology are strongly connected with recent achievements in chemistry and material sciences, laser physics, nonlinear optics, etc. Different materials (metals, semiconductors, dielectrics) were used for the synthesis of homogeneous NPs.114–117
Most of the mentioned processes and technologies rely on the position and the strength of the surface plasmon resonance on a nanosphere and the absorption of radiation energy.118–129 The plasmonic properties of nanoscale metal NPs depend on different parameters such as their dimensions, shapes, and the optical properties of the metal and the surrounding medium.118–127
The phenomenon of laser pulse heating of NPs is important for various applications. A theoretical description of the spatial and spatial–temporal behavior of the NP and medium temperature is crucial for the analysis of the experimental results, for the theoretical prediction of novel effects, and for successful applications of PT technologies. Computer and analytical modeling is widely used for the description of different processes. Analytical modeling has a few advantages over computer modeling because its results are much simpler and ready for concrete applications, and can be used for the description of different experiments. On the other hand, the accuracy and the areas of applicability of the analytical results should be estimated and grounded.
It is important to present the general picture of NP heating for pulse duration, tP, from femtoseconds to CW irradiation and the following cooling of NP for a wide range of NP parameters (materials, sizes, etc.) and other characteristics of the radiation and surrounding medium. The heating of NPs up to high temperature leads by necessity to taking into account the dependence of the optical and thermal properties of NP materials and their surrounding medium on their temperature. The processes of evaporation and size transformation of NPs, bubble and plasma formation under action of intensive laser pulses are out of the scope of this review.
This review analyses the results of theoretical and experimental investigations of the thermal processes of pulsed radiation interaction with single NPs and their assemblies for applications in PT and laser nanotechnology. Homogeneous metallic spherical NPs are considered. However, the main results are applicable for different homogeneous NPs from dielectrics, semiconductors, etc.
The interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with an electron–lattice system in metallic nanoparticles has been discussed. The absorption of pico- and femtosecond laser pulses by electrons in metallic NPs, electron–phonon coupling and the heating of an electron system up to ∼104 K and a lattice system up to ∼103 K and their cooling after the termination of the laser action usually has a nonlinear character. It is important to study the energy exchange between the electron gas and lattice, and electron–phonon coupling taking into account the dependencies of the electronic heat capacity and electron–phonon coupling factor on temperature.8–10
The analysis of different models of light-to-heat conversion and NP heating12–46 is presented. This review is restricted by investigation of the thermal processes of heat exchange and heat conduction under the heating of NPs and an ambient medium up to temperatures less than the evaporation temperatures of the NP material (metal) and medium, but includes possible NP melting. Here the results of the thermal process modeling of the laser–NP interaction are reviewed, taking into account the heating and melting of a single NP and its cooling after the termination of radiation, and the temperature dependencies of the parameters of the NPs and environments. The influence of the NP parameters (their radii, absorption efficiency factor, NP concentration), the characteristics of the radiation (wavelength, pulse duration, radiation beam radius), the surrounding medium (heat conduction coefficient, characteristic length of radiation extinction) on the efficiency of light-to-heat conversion is also discussed. The spatial–temporal dependencies of the NP temperature during NP heating, cooling and heat exchange with an ambient medium are presented.
A model of nanoparticle assembly heating by pulsed radiation and the results of analytical modeling of the light-to-heat conversion by a NP assembly under radiation action are presented. The investigation and the use of NPs assemblies as photo-thermal agents in light-to-heat conversion processes are fast growing areas of research and have applications in nanoenergy, nanomedicine and laser nanotechnology.
The heat localization within the NPs and NP assemblies during the determined time intervals practically without heat exchange and with an ambience (thermal confinement) is established and discussed. The redistribution of the thermal absorbed energy between NPs or NP assemblies and the surrounding medium during radiation heating and following cooling is considered. The proposed analytical results are verified and the areas of their applications and accuracy are determined on the basis of comparison with numerical calculations.
2. Light absorption by electrons and electron–phonon relaxation
2.1. Analysis of the theoretical model of electron–phonon relaxation
Free electrons are the first agents to interact with laser pulses acting on metallic NPs. In the case of the action of femtosecond and subpicosecond laser pulses with characteristic durations of about 10–100 fs, the electron gas oscillate under the action of the electric field, and electron–electron and electron–NP surface collisions lead to a quasi-equilibration of the hot electron system.1–3 The physical concepts related to the collective dynamics of plasmon excitations in metal nanocrystals that focus on the photogeneration of energetic carriers have been reviewed.2 The kinetic energy of hot carriers can be used to harvest solar energy or to create sensitive photodetectors and spectrometers. Photo-ejected charges can also be used to electrically dope two-dimensional materials.3
Due to the small heat capacity and the finite time for electron–phonon relaxation, a short laser pulse action can bring the metal to a state of strong electron–lattice nonequilibrium. The electron temperature can reach up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, while the lattice still remains cold. This is the case of thermal energy confinement in an electron gas during a very short period of time, t < 1 × 10−12 s. After establishing a thermal electronic system with a maximum temperature, Tem, the hot electrons cool down by transferring their energy to the lattice by electron–phonon coupling. This is the light-to-heat conversion in the electron–lattice system.
The temperature relaxation and electron–phonon coupling were investigated on the basis of a two-temperature model.1 This model includes two-coupled kinetic equations: the first equation describes the thermal transfer of electron gas energy to the lattice and the second describes the heating of the lattice. Together they describe the temporal evolution of the electron, Te, and lattice, Ti, temperatures: 
(2.1)Ce and Ci are the electronic and the lattice heat capacities, and G is the electron–phonon coupling factor. In general, the electron heat capacity, Ce, and the electron–phonon coupling factor, G, depend on the electron temperature. The lattice heat capacity, Ci, depends weakly on temperature, Ti, and it is usually assumed that Ci ≈ const.
The system of these equations was investigated by numerical and analytical methods.1–7,11 The dependence of Ce = γTe and G = const has been used in the numerical solution of (2.1)1,5 and in analytical solutions.3–6
2.2. Solutions for the nonlinear dependence of electron–phonon coupling on electron temperature
Experimental and theoretical results8–10 confirmed the different temperature dependencies for G(Te) in comparison to the constant value of G for some metals mentioned below. A significant increase of the electron–phonon coupling factor and the electron heat capacity for gold has been shown8,9 in the temperature range up to 2 × 104 K. On the other hand, the experiments with nickel and platinum10 showed a decrease in the strength of the electron–phonon coupling factor with temperature. Here we present the analytical temporal dependencies of Te and Ti,38 taking into account the dependencies G(Te).8–10
After thermal equilibration of an electron system, the temperature of the electrons has a maximum value Tem, and the lattice temperature is equal to the initial temperature T∞. For simplicity of the solution, we suppose that this moment is equal to t = 0 and the conditions for (2.1) are 
t = 0 Te = Tem, Ti = T∞
(2.2)for t → ∞, Te = Ti = Teq, where Teq is the final temperature of a thermalized electron–lattice system.
The real dependencies of G(Te) and Ce(Te) for noble metals (gold, silver, copper) and for tungsten8,9 can be approximated by linear dependencies: 
Ce(Te) ≈ γTe, G(Te) ≈ G0Te,
(2.3)
The solutions of (2.1) and (2.2) together with (2.3) have the form 
(2.4)Teq = −Ts + (Ts2 + Tem2 + 2TsT∞)1/2, where Ts = Ci/γ and is a metal dependent constant, and lattice temperature is determined by 
(2.5)
The electron temperature exponentially decays with a time characteristic of electron–phonon coupling, . Estimations of τeph for different Tem and different metals give τeph ∼ 1 × 10−11 to 1 × 10−12 s.
The real dependencies of G(Te) and Ce(Te) for nickel and platinum9,10 can be approximated by simple dependencies: 
G(Te) ≈ G0/Te, Ce(Te) ≈ γTe
(2.6)
The simple approximations (2.3) and (2.6) have relative deviations of about 10–30% from the dependencies8–10 for the temperature interval 3 × 103 to 2 × 104 K. The data of the parameters γ and G0 are presented.38 The solution of (2.1) and (2.2) with (2.6) has the form 
(2.7)
Electron temperature decays nonexponentially in this case.
A significant increase or decrease in the electron–phonon coupling and an increase of the electron heat capacity may lead to different sequences in the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond and subpicosecond laser–metal interactions. The faster energy transfer or its slow down from the hot electrons to the lattice can result in changes in time-scale and dependencies of the laser induced transformations. The analytical solutions (2.4), (2.5) and (2.7) determine the temporal dependencies, the final values of the electron and lattice temperatures, and the characteristic time τeph, and can be used for estimations and descriptions of different experimental situations involving the interaction of ultrashort pulses with metal NPs, taking into account the temperature dependencies of the parameters G(Te) and Ce(Te).
3. Analytical and computer modeling of the heating of a single nanoparticle by radiation pulses
3.1. Analysis of the theoretical models and results
A few theoretical models, analytical and numerical approaches, have been developed and applied to the description of NP heating by laser radiation, NP cooling and subsequent thermal processes. Numerical modeling of NP heating by laser radiation has been carried out.11–20 Among these publications the following are outstanding.
The two-temperature model for electron and lattice systems inside NPs has been taken into account together with heat exchange with ambience.11–13 But the processes in electron–lattice systems are complete by instant t ∼ 10−12 to 10−11 s,1–5 without a significant heat exchange with ambience and hydrodynamic processes. The investigation of electro-phonon coupling and macroscopic thermal processes can be divided in time and conducted separately.
The process of heating a spherical gold NP by nanosecond pulses with no mass transfer has been numerically modeled using the finite element method.15 Computational modeling of pulsed laser-induced heating of gold and silver NPs under the action of short laser pulses in the range 1 ns to 100 fs has been investigated numerically.16 The thermodynamics of gold nanoparticles immersed in water and illuminated by a femtosecond-pulsed laser have been investigated analytically and numerically.17–20 The spatiotemporal evolution of the temperature profile inside and outside has been computed. For temporal and spatial temperature dependencies, analytical formulas were used with empirical fitting parameters.21 However, in each experiment, these parameters are different and it is not a self-consistent procedure.
The analytical solutions are much simpler and useful for the description of thermal processes than the computer results; however, they do not possess high accuracy. First, analytical descriptions of heat flow in an infinite medium heated by a sphere have been carried out.22,23 This solution is presented in integro-differential form, which is very difficult to use in concrete situations. The limits of localized heating by electromagnetically excited nanoparticles have been investigated.24 Analytical solutions for the heating of NPs under the condition of a constant heat flux boundary were obtained and compared with the numerical calculation. The interface thermal conductance between the NP surface and the adjoining layer of the surrounding medium24 was treated as an adjustable parameter that could be determined from experiments. Analytical modeling of NP heating by laser radiation18–21,27 is actually based on a steady-state situation using only the energy conservation equation, when equality exists between the heat input into the NPs, by the conversion of energy absorbed by the NPs, and the outward heat flux by conduction at thermal equilibrium. This approach could be applied only for CW irradiation and pulses with long durations.
Two problems are worth discussing regarding radiation heating of NPs and their cooling. The first one is the applicability of the diffusive heat equation to nanoscale thermal processes, which requires a justification at the nanoscale.47–50 It has been noted that the diffusive equation is valid if the mean free paths of the heat carrier-electrons, phonons in the NPs and molecules, and phonons in the ambient medium are much smaller than the characteristic NP size. The mean free path of carriers (molecules) in amorphous surrounding solids and liquids is very short ∼0.1 nm, and this is much smaller than characteristic NP radii of r0 ∼ 10–100 nm. Consequently, the heat flow in NP surrounding liquids and amorphous solids can be well described by the diffusive heat equation when nanoscopic length scales are involved. A molecular dynamics simulation of heat transfer from small 3 nm gold nanoparticles to a water pool has been carried out51 with realistic potentials for the gold atoms and water molecules. The simulation result was significantly affected by the choice of water models, the interfacial wetting, and the boundary conditions.
The mean free path of molecules in gases at atmospheric pressure is about ∼5 × 10−6 cm, and the diffusive heat equation can be applied for heat exchange of NP with a surrounding gaseous medium for r0 > 100 nm. For NPs with r0 ∼ 10–100 nm, the methods of kinetic equations or molecular dynamics should be used.52 For gas pressures ∼ 100 atm and more the diffusive heat equation can be used for r0 ≥ 10 nm.
The second problem is the presence of a possible surface thermal resistivity at the surface of a NP immersed in a liquid or solid ambience.18,19,24,25,50 Thermal resistivity may occur because of the material discontinuity and surface nanoscale roughness and can play an important role in some cases such as the hydrophobic coating of the NP surface by some liquids or the poor contact of solid ambient materials with the NP surface.24 The negligible influence of the interface (Kapitsa) resistance in the case of good wetting has been studied.25 It should be taken into account for small nanoparticles when the value of the nanoparticle radius is smaller than the length of the free path in the surrounding medium. The nature and the regions of existence of interface thermal resistivity (conductance) should be cleared and confirmed by experiments or complicated computer modeling of the processes on real NP surfaces in different ambiences. The review50 provides critical insight into the mechanisms that govern thermal transport at three different types of nanoparticle interfaces, including: nanoparticle–substrate, nanoparticle–matrix and nanoparticle–nanoparticle interfaces. However, in many situations, the NP surface resistivity does not have any significant effect, and the condition of “ideal” heat contact between the NP surface and the ambient medium is used.
The efficiency of light energy conversion into thermal energy was studied.43–46 Size-dependent photothermal conversion efficiencies from 0.650 to 0.803 for plasmonic heated gold nanoparticles have been studied.43 The results indicate that the photothermal properties of gold nanoparticles are size-tunable, and the variation of efficiency can be correlated to the absorption/extinction ratios for different particle sizes. The method of calibration of the light for heat conversion in an aqueous fluid containing nanoparticles has been presented.46 The proposed method enables measurement of the temperature in the environment surrounding the nanoparticles, as a function of the exposure time to laser radiation. A method to measure the local temperature around a single gold nanoparticle in liquid, using white light scattering spectroscopy has been experimentally proposed.96 The localized heating effect was monitored through the plasmon peak shift using gold nanoparticles coated with a thermo-responsive polymer. Plasmonic nanostructures involving aggregated silver NPs can be heated effectively by many overlapping femtosecond laser pulses at very low fluence.103 The effectiveness of heating is such that the temperature of 50 nm Ag NPs can be raised to their melting point.
Theoretical modeling of the processes of laser–NP interaction and analytical nonlinear solutions for quasi-steady distributions of temperature, T, heat flux on a spherical NP with radius, r, and the temporal dependencies of NP temperature, T0, on time, t, has been investigated. The temperature dependencies of the thermo-physical parameters of NPs and their surrounding media were taken into account under NP heating, heat transfer and cooling after the termination of the laser pulse action. The basis, the application regions, and verification accuracy of this model were established. The results21–24,30,35–41 are used below.
3.2. Computer and analytical models of NP radiation heating
Thermal processes under action of laser pulses on NPs are described by the system of heat conduction equations for each component of our system:22,128 
(3.1)the i index denotes the ith component of the two-component system including NPs (i = 0) and the surrounding medium (i = 1); t is time; T is the general temperature; ci, ρi, and ki are heat capacity, density and thermal conductivity, respectively; and qi is the power density of heat sources.
The power density of energy generation in particle q0 due to radiation energy absorption can be generally non-uniform throughout the particle volume. The investigation of internal distributions of radiation intensity inside the NP volume has been undertaken.113 In our case, we use the approximation 2πr0/λ < 1, and it is assumed that q0 is virtually uniform throughout the NP volume. The pressure in the medium containing the NPs is usually assumed to be constant during radiation–NP interaction.
3.2.1. Computer model of NP radiation heating. The heat conduction eqn (3.1) describes the thermal processes of radiation–NP interaction for a spherical geometry22,128 
(3.2)r is the radius of the spherical coordinate system with the origin fixed at the NP centre; the NP parameters are determined for r ≤ r0 (i = 0) and the ambient medium parameters are determined for r > r0 (i = 1); T is the general temperature; qi is the power density of the heat sources (r ≤ r0 q0 = I0Kabsπr02/V0, I0 is the intensity of the radiation, Kabs(r0, λ, T0) is the efficiency absorption factor for radiation with wavelength λ by a spherical particle of radius r0,118 q1 = 0 for r > r0); and V0 = 4/3πr03 is the NP volume, with the initial condition: 
T(r, t = 0) = T∞
(3.3)T∞ is the initial temperature of the NP and medium. The optical properties of metallic spherical NPs (Kabs), placed in various media, have already been presented.118–126The process of melting is realized at the achievement of the melting temperature, TM, of the NP metal during heating under laser pulse action, and solidification during the cooling of the NPs after the termination of radiation action. The equation taking into account NP melting has the form 
(3.4)LM is the latent heat of melting, and δ(x) is the Dirac delta function, other notations are mentioned above.

3.2.2. Analytical model of NP radiation heating. The simple solution of eqn (3.2) in the case of an instant heat source inside a point like a NP (r0 → 0) in the spherical case is equal to30 
(3.5)χ1 = k1/c1ρ1, χ1 is the thermal diffusivity of the ambient medium. This equation allows estimation of the characteristic time, tT1, of the formation of a quasi-stationary temperature distribution in the space r > r0 for a distance of about r ∼ r0, tT1 ∼ r02/4χ1, where Qabs is the energy absorbed by the NP.The solution of (3.2) and (3.3) is given in ref. 24 for the condition of constant heat flux at the NP surface under continuous heating starting at time t = 0 in the region outside the NP volume  erfc is the error function.22
The analytical model of the thermal processes of radiation–NP interaction is based on two main assumptions: the first is the use of a uniform temperature inside the NP volume during heating and cooling of the NP. The characteristic time, tT0, required for the formation of a quasi-stationary uniform temperature profile inside a NP is estimated from the formula: tT0 ∼ r02/4χ0, χ0 is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity for the NP material and for t > tT0 this assumption is fulfilled, for a gold NP with r0 ∼ 25 nm, χ0 ∼ 1.27 × 10−2 cm2 s−1,128 tT0 ∼ 1.2 × 10−10 s.
Using this assumption and after integration over the NP volume for the spherically symmetric case, and the transition to a uniform temperature T0 over the NP volume the equation, which describes the heating of a NP and which results from the eqn (3.2), has the form:35 
(3.6)with the initial condition 
T0(t = 0) = T∞,
(3.7)S0 = 4πr02 is the surface area of a spherical NP of radius r0, I0 intensity of laser radiation, and Jε energy flux density from the NP.
The second assumption is the use of the quasi-stationary heat exchange of the NP with the surrounding medium (quasi-stationary dependence of T on r for r > r0), described by (3.2) with  and for tP > tT1 ∼ r02/4χ1 (r0 = 25 nm, χ1 = 1.43 × 10−3 cm2 s−1, water,128 tT1 ∼ 1 × 10−9 s) this condition should be fulfilled 
(3.8)
The condition of tP > tT1 means that the temperature distribution around the NP is tuned to the temporal dependence of NP temperature  so that for each time instant we can use the quasi-stationary dependence of T on r.
The quantity Jε near the particle surface is composed of energy losses due to heat conduction JC and radiation cooling JR (ref. 35) 
(3.9)
The value of JC is determined at the NP surface, the particle surface emissivity is equal to 1, and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, σ = 5.67 × 10−12 J cm−2 s−1 K−4.128 Estimations of JC and JR on the basis of (3.9) using the characteristic temperature value of T0 = 3 × 103 K gives: JR ∼ σT04 ∼ 4.6 × 102 W cm−2, JC ∼ 3 × 106 W cm−2 and JC ≫ JR for the temperature interval T∞ < T0 < 7 × 103 K, and JR will be neglected.
The dependence of the thermal conductivity coefficient k1 of the surrounding medium (liquid, dielectrics, etc.) on temperature T can be presented in the subsequent forms:38 
k1 = k∞(T/T∞)a (a) k1 = k∞exp[ε(T − T∞)] (b)
(3.10)k∞ = k1(T = T∞), with parameters a = const, ε = const (for example, for water under saturation pressure a ≈ 0.5 in the temperature range 273 < T < 473 K.127 The dependencies of Kabs on temperature can be presented in the subsequent forms 
Kabs = K∞(T0/T∞)b (a) Kabs = K∞exp[ε0(T0 − T∞)]
(3.11)K∞ = Kabs(T0 = T∞), and parameters b = const, ε0 = const. The dependencies (3.10) and (3.11) can be used for dielectrics and semiconductors, as NP materials and surrounding media.
For constant Kabs = K∞ = const, b = 0 (3.11) and the temperature dependence k1 = k∞(T/T∞)a (3.10) the next solutions can be obtained for the quasi-stationary temperature distribution around a NP in a spherical coordinate system with the origin at the NP center under the condition t > tT1 from (3.8) for r ≥ r0 
(3.12)
The solutions for JC at the NP surface r = r0 are obtained from eqn (3.9) and (3.12) 
(3.13)and for the temporal dependence T0(t) from eqn (3.6) and (3.13) for the period of time 0 ≤ t ≤ tP and for a = 0, 1:35 
(3.14)
The cooling of a NP can be described by an expression, which can be derived from (3.6) with use of (3.13) under I0 = 0, T(t = tP) = Tmax and t > tP: 
(3.15)Tmax is the maximum value of NP temperature at the end of the laser pulse t = tP. The characteristic times τ0 and τ1 determine the temporal dependencies of T0 during NP heating and cooling.
The solutions (3.14) and (3.15) for the temporal dependencies T0(t) during NP heating and cooling are based on the use of a quasi-stationary solution for (3.12) and (3.13) for the transient problem (eqn (3.6)) for tP > tT1. This fact is confirmed by the estimations tP > tT1 and by direct computer modeling, when analytical distributions for tP > 10−8 s are consistent to numerical ones.41
The interval of time, ΔtM, that should be spent for melting of NPs under radiation action can be obtained from (3.6) under dT0/dt = 0, T0 = TM, when the absorbed radiation energy should be spent for melting and heat exchange with ambience during ΔtM    
The interval of time, ΔtS, that should be spent for solidification of the NP during its cooling after the termination of radiation action can be obtained from (3.6), when the energy released because of solidification should be spent for heat exchange with ambience
ΔtSJCS0 = ρ0V0LM  
The solutions of eqn (3.6)–(3.8) are presented for the cases of Kabs = K∞(T0/T∞)b, k1 = k∞(T/T∞)a and for kabs = k∞exp[ε0(T0 − T∞)], k1 = k∞exp[ε(T − T∞)] ((3.10) and (3.11)).38

3.3. Computer and analytical modeling of nanoparticle heating by radiation pulses
Fig. 2 (left column) presents the temporal–spatial distributions of the temperature T inside and around spherical gold NP with r0 = 25 nm, placed in water, for different time instants under pulsed irradiation with the pulse durations tP = 1 × 10−2, 1 × 10−6, 1 × 10−8, and 1 × 10−12 s, values of normalized radiation intensity In = I0Kabs, based on the computer calculations of the eqn (3.2) and (3.3), and analytical dependencies (3.14) and (3.15). The maximum values of T(r = r0) for all variants are smaller than the boiling temperature of water Tb = 373 K (see Fig. 2),128 and the outer atmospheric pressure p = 1 atm. Pulsed radiation causes an intensive heating of the NP during its action. The temperature distributions for CW radiation practically coincide with the ones for tP = 1 × 10−2 s.
 Fig. 2  The computer (solid) and analytical (dashed) dependencies of the temperature T along the radius r for the time instants t/tP (left column) and temporal dependencies of Tmax(r = 0) on t/tP (right column) for a Au NP with r0 = 25 nm, placed in water: for tP = 1 × 10−2 s, In = 0.75 MW cm−2, t/tP = 1 × 10−6 (1), 1 × 10−4 (2), 0.1 (3), 0.5 (4), 1 (5), 1.00001 (6) (a); tP = 1 × 10−6 s, In = 0.78 MW cm−2, t/tP = 1 × 10−2 (1), 0.1 (2), 0.5 (3), 1.0 (4), 1.005 (5), 1.01 (6) (b); for tP = 1 × 10−8 s, In = 1.13 MW cm−2, t/tP = 0.1 (1), 0.5 (2), 1 (3), 2.0 (4), 5.0 (5), 10.0 (6) (c); for tP = 1 × 10−12 s, In = 0.67 GW cm−2, t/tP = 0.1 (1), 0.5 (2), 1 (3), 5 (4), 100 (5) 300 (6) (d). Vertical lines in the left column indicate the boundaries of the NP. 
The temperature inside the NP is virtually independent of the coordinate r, and T(r ≤ r0) ≈ const for different pulse durations tP, instants of time and values of radiation intensity, since the thermal diffusivity of metals is very high.128 A temperature drop is observed in the adjacent layer of the surrounding medium. The specific feature for pulsed irradiation for the range tP = 1 × 10−2 to 1 × 10−8 s is the presence of developed NP heat transfer to the surrounding medium during the radiation action. Analytical and numerical temperature distributions on r outside the NP for lines 1–3 (1–5) in Fig. 2 practically coincide with each other for a few time instants. This indicates the formation of stationary temperature profiles for pulsed irradiation with tP ∼ 1 × 10−2 to 1 × 10−6 s (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, the non-stationary character of NP heat exchange with the surrounding medium (water) is confirmed by the computer simulation for short laser pulses tP ∼ 1 × 10−8, 1 × 10−12 s. It indicates a practically absent or weak heat exchange of the NP with its surroundings, and heat localization of absorbed laser pulse energy in the NP leading to its considerable heating in excess of the surrounding medium.
The computer distributions confirm two main analytical assumptions for the construction of the presented analytical model: the first one is the approximate uniform temperature inside the NP volume depending on t during radiation action and cooling for wide interval values of tP (Fig. 2, left column); the second one is that the computer and quasi-stationary analytical distributions of T along the radius (r > r0) practically coincide each other for the range of pulse durations tP = 1 × 10−2 to 1 × 10−6 s (Fig. 2a–d).
The analytical temperature distributions differ from the computer ones for tP = 1 × 10−8 s because of the non-stationary character of the computer distributions of T(r) for r > r0. For tP = 1 × 10−12 s the internal computer and analytical distributions of T(r ≤ r0) during the pulse duration are close to each other, because the heat exchange with ambience is practically absent in this case and the temperature is determined by the heat source (absorption energy). However, the temperature distributions outside of the NP for r ≥ r0 differ significantly because of the non-stationary character of the computer distributions of T(r) and the quasi-stationary character of the analytical dependencies T(r).
Fig. 2 (right column) shows the temporal dependencies of the maximum temperature at the centre of the gold NP with Tmax(r = 0, t) on t/tP for different pulse durations determined on the basis of the computer calculations of (3.2) and (3.3) and the analytical dependencies (3.14) and (3.15). Immediately after irradiation commencement, the heating of the NP and its heat exchange with the surrounding water starts. The temporal dependencies of Tmax(r = 0) on t have significant features for different values of tP.
The heating of the NP up to the maximum temperature Tmax is realized for tP = 1 × 10−2 s very rapidly to the time instant t ∼ (0.01–0.1)tP. Next, the absorption of energy is compensated by heat losses because of the heat conduction and the analytical and computer dependencies coincide with each other. For tP = 1 × 10−6 s the computer calculated temperature T(r = 0) achieves the value of 0.9Tmax(r = 0) up to time instant t = 0.1tP and during the rest part of tP T(r = 0) slowly achieves the value of Tmax(r = 0). The analytical dependence T(r = 0) on t shows analogous behavior as for tP = 1 × 10−2 s. After the laser pulse with tP = 1 × 10−6 s is turned off, the NP gives energy to the medium for a time interval of about 1 × 10−8 s, and its temperature T0 moves down and becomes equal to the initial temperature T∞.
The NP is heated by shorter laser pulses with tP = 1 × 10−8, 1 × 10−12 s during the pulse action up to Tmax(r = 0) and cooling is carried out with the characteristic times 10 × 103t/tP (see Fig. 2). For the ultrashort pulse with tP = 10−12 s the analytical dependence T0(t) (dashed lines) describing the temporal cooling of the NP slowly decreases in comparison to the computer dependence. The analytical value of Tmax is bigger than the computer value of Tmax for the intermediate case with the pulse durations tP = 10−8 s, because non-stationary heat exchange of NP takes place during the laser pulse action.
The computer simulation confirms the possibility of using the analytical model for the description of the temporal dependence of NP temperature, T0, and the outward distributions, T(r), with sufficient accuracy for the range tP > 10−7 s for NP heating and cooling processes, for NP heating in the interval of pulse durations 10−12 ≤ tP ≤ 10−10 s and NP heating and cooling in the interval of pulse durations 1 × 10−10 < tP < 1 × 10−8 s with errors of ∼20–30%.
3.4. Thermal confinement of NPs
The pulse duration, tP, should be less than the characteristic times, τ0(τ1), of NP cooling to provide efficient heating of the NPs practically without heat loss.35,37,38 If the condition t < τ0 for time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ tP is obeyed, the expansion of the exponent in (3.14) gives the dependence T0 on t 
(3.16)
The fulfilment of thermal confinement means the achievement of the maximum value of NP temperature Tmax = T0(tP) practically without heat exchange with the ambience and heat localization within a NP volume (conserving own heat energy) during “short” pulse action with tP < τ0.
In the opposite case (“long” radiation pulses) for tP > τ0, the heat loss from the NP by heat conduction has to be taken into account during the period of time 0 ≤ t ≤ tP. The case tP > τ0 can be used for intensive heat exchange of NPs with ambience and its heating and the stationary value of T0 from (3.14) 
(3.17)
3.5. Conversion of NP thermal energy and heat transfer to the surrounding medium
Analysis of the integral energy parameters is of interest, because they characterize the interaction of laser radiation with a NP from the onset of irradiation t = 0 to the time considered t: the quantity of radiation energy Qabs absorbed by a NP, the quantities of heat spent for NP melting QM and removed from a NP by heat conduction QC, and also the thermal energy of a NP ET: 
(3.18)for I0 = const, Kabs = const, Qabs = πr02I0Kabst for t ≤ tP. Integration over the time t = 0 to t with regard to eqn (3.6) and the energies (3.18) will give the energy conservation law for a NP: 
Qabs + ET∞ = ET + QC + QM,
(3.19)ET∞ = ρ0c0V0T∞ is the initial thermal energy of a NP, energy QM = 0 for T0 < TM. Eqn (3.19) can be used for the control of the energy conservation law of the processes of laser action on a NP.
Energy QC can be analytically calculated using (3.18) and expressions for JC (3.13), T0 (3.14) and (3.15) taking into account Tmax = T(tmax = tP) under a = 0 for the period of time [0, tP]: 
(3.20)and for t > tP 
(3.21)
The correlation between the heat energy contained in a NP and transferred to surrounding medium at the current moment and in the course of time is essential for the initiation and realization of different physical–chemical processes inside a NP and in the medium.
We used the following parameters for estimation of the influence of different mechanisms of thermal processes for T0 < TM 
(3.22)
The parameter P1 is not determined here. It describes the correlation between absorption and scattering of radiation by NPs and it has been investigated for metallic NPs.124 The parameter P2 determines the correlation between the heat loss energy by NPs and the energy absorbed by a NP, and P3 characterizes the conversion efficiency of absorbed radiation energy to thermal energy taking into account the loss of NP thermal energy by heat conduction, and determines the correlation between the NP thermal energy and the absorbed energy during the heat exchange with ambience.
Parameters P2 and P3 are determined by analytical expressions for QC(t) (3.20) and (3.21) and have the forms (3.23) for 0 < t ≤ tP and (3.24) for t > tP: 
(3.23) 
(3.24)
Computer and analytical dependencies of the parameters P2, P3 on t/tP for Au NPs with the radius r0 = 25 nm placed in water are presented in Fig. 3. The computer and analytical dependencies almost completely coincide with each other for tP = 10−2 to 10−8 s. It indicates that analytical eqn (3.23) and (3.24) describe the computer dependencies with an appropriate accuracy for the mentioned range of tP = 10−10 to 10−12 s. Computer and analytical dependencies of the parameters P2, P3 on t/tP differ significantly for short pulse durations. It is interesting that for tP = 10−12 s the initial and final values of P2, P3 are equal each other.
 Fig. 3  Computer (solid) and analytical (dashed) dependencies of the parameters of P2 and P3 on t/tP for Au NPs with the radius r0 = 25 nm for tP = 1 × 10−2 s, In = 0.75 MW cm−2 (a), tP = 1 × 10−4 s, In = 0.75 MW cm−2 (b), tP = 1 × 10−6 s, In = 0.78 MW cm−2 (c), tP = 1 × 10−8 s, In = 1.13 MW cm−2 (d), tP = 1 × 10−10 s, In = 10.9 MW cm−2 (e), and tP = 1 × 10−12 s, In = 0.67 GW cm−2 (f). 
Fig. 4 presents the computer and analytical temporal–spatial distributions of the temperature T(t, r) inside and around a NP for the different time instants, t/tP, and temporal distributions of the temperature, Tmax(r = 0, t), for the spherical gold NP with r0 = 25 nm, placed in water with the outer pressure of about p ∼ 100–130 atm, for intensive pulsed irradiation with the pulse durations tP = 1 × 10−8, 1 × 10−10 s, 1 × 10−12 s. The water boiling temperature is approximately equal to ∼580–603 K129 for the outer pressure of about p ∼ 100–130 atm. The condition of high outer pressure p ∼ 100 atm was used for investigation in a wider interval of temperature of NPs, placed in water. This one allowed heating of NPs up to T0 ∼ 580–600 K, as it was achieved in experiments.97 The temporal–spatial distributions of the temperature T(r, t) and temporal dependencies of the temperature Tmax(r = 0, t) in this case are qualitatively close to the dependencies presented in Fig. 2, but they differ between the maximum values of Tmax.
 Fig. 4  Computer (solid) and analytical (dashed) dependencies of the temperature T along the radius r for the time instants t/tP (left column) and the temporal dependencies of Tmax (r = 0) on t/tP (right column) for a Au NP with r0 = 25 nm, placed in water: for pulsed irradiation tP = 1 × 10−8 s, In = 4.3 MW cm−2, t/tP = 0.1 (1), 0.5 (2), 1.0 (3), 5.0 (4), 20.0 (5) (a); tP = 1 × 10−10 s, In = 42 MW cm−2 t/tP = 0.1 (1), 0.5 (2), 1.0 (3), 5.0 (4), 100 (5) (b); for tP = 1 × 10−12 s, In = 2.5 GW cm−2, t/tP = 0.1 (1), 0.5 (2), 1.0 (3), 5.0 (4), 100.0 (5), 300.0 (6) (c). Vertical lines in the left column indicate the boundaries of the NP. 
Moreover, it should be noted that for short pulses with tP = 10−10 to 10−12 s, the threshold of water explosive evaporation (boiling) is approximately equal to 570–590 K (ref. 129) for the outer pressure p ∼ 1 atm because of the shortening of the laser pulse action, and these results (Fig. 4) can be also used for this case.
Numerous experimental investigations have been carried out for laser interaction with Ag NPs in glasses.90 Fig. 5 presents the temporal dependencies of Tmax(r = 0, t) on t/tP for a Ag NP with radius r0 = 25 nm placed in silica under the action of short laser pulses. The pulse duration, tP = 10−8 s, is comparable with the characteristic time, τ0 ,of heat exchange with the environment (glass), and the heat exchange of the NP determines the difference between the analytical (with quasi-stationary) and computer (with non-stationary) outer temperature distributions. After melting, the NP temperature continues to increase, and reaches a maximum; the maximum in analytical solutions is greater than in the computer solution. Upon termination of a pulse, the NP temperature quickly falls, and a solidification process takes place during NP cooling.
 Fig. 5  Computer (solid) and analytical (dashed) temporal dependencies of Tmax(r = 0) on t/tP for Ag NP with r0 = 25 nm, placed in silica, for pulsed irradiation with tP = 1 × 10−8 s, In = 37 MW cm−2, (a); tP = 1 × 10−10 s, In = 240 MW cm−2 (b); for tP = 1 × 10−12 s, In = 14 GW cm−2 (c and d). 
The maximum in the analytical solutions is greater than in the computer one for tP = 10−10 s < τ0 (Fig. 5b), and the heating and melting of the NP for the computer solution takes place more slowly, and solidification and cooling takes place faster than in the analytical description because of the non-stationary temperature gradient. The case of NP heating by a radiation pulse with tP = 10−12 s ≪ τ0 (Fig. 5c) leads to linear growth of NP temperature in time, practically without NP heat exchange, and the temperature dependencies are close to each other for the analytical and computer solutions. After pulse termination the non-stationary computer temperature gradient determines faster NP cooling than the analytical one.
The characteristic times tT1 and τT0 describe the formation of a quasi-steady spatial distribution of the temperature around the NP  (see (3.5)) and NP heating and cooling  (see (3.14) for a = 0). These characteristic times have quadratic dependencies on r0, but the time tT1 depends only on medium thermal parameters and τ0 depends on NP and medium parameters. Experimental data21 has confirmed a quadratic (parabolic) dependence of the characteristic time for energy dissipation versus NP radius τ0 ∼ r02.
The dependencies of τ0 on r0 are presented in Fig. 6 for gold NPs placed in surrounding water and silica. It is interesting to note that ρ0c0 = 2.49 for gold and 2.48 for silver and Fig. 6 can be approximately used for both metallic NPs simultaneously. The fulfilment of the condition tP < τ0 for the most interesting range of r0: r0 < 50 nm means that the value of tP will be in the range of the pulse durations: tP ≤ 3 × 10−9 s.

4. Heating of a nanoparticle assembly by radiation
Investigations of NP assembly heating by radiation pulses have been applied for increasing the efficiency of light-to-heat conversion,54–63 for applications in nanomedicine (thermal treatment of cancer,64–74 thermal release of drugs75,76), in photochemistry,78–88 etc. A few examples of NP assembly heating by radiation pulses are presented below. The efficiency of light-to-heat conversion, which turns out to be remarkably close to 1, was determined under photo-heating in a water droplet containing gold NPs.55 Two possible situation have been investigated: (1) a large concentration of NPs and a small laser intensity, and (2) a small NP concentration and intense laser irradiation. Metal NPs were utilized as heating elements within nanofibers.60 In the photothermal process, resonant light excites the surface plasmon of the NP and the absorbed energy is converted into heat due to electron–phonon collisions. This heating is efficient and strongly localized and it is generated from the nanometer-sized metal particles embedded within the polymer. A coupled solution of the radiative transfer equation and the energy equation for a nanofluid yields the temperature rise of the nanofluid as a result of absorbed radiation and the efficiency of a direct-absorption nanofluid-based energy collector.61–63 The results of such studies indicate the potential to “tune” the spectral radiative properties of nanofluids, as represented by the extinction coefficient, through appropriate choice of NP materials, shape, volume fraction. The results of ref. 22, 42, 54, 57 and 130 are used below.
4.1. Analysis of the model of NP assembly heating by radiation
The model of NP assembly heating by radiation is analyzed in the present part. A heterogeneous two-component system containing an assembly of NPs in surrounding solid or liquid medium was considered. For simplicity the spherical NPs, which absorb and scatter the radiation energy, are assumed to be monodispersed with characteristic radii of r0. The ordering of the NP assembly was investigated on the base of cell’s approximation with regular placement of NPs in the center of each computational cell with radius rC. Such a model represents a real heterogeneous system loaded by NPs with rather good accuracy.130
A simplified geometrical picture of coordinate systems is presented in Fig. 7. Two coordinate systems were introduced: the first one is the system of cylindrical coordinates R, and Z; the second one is the spherical coordinate system with radius r and with the origin fixed at the centre of each NP and cells. The R axis is directed along the radius of the radiation beam with characteristic radius RB, and the Z axis is directed along the direction of laser beam propagation.
 Fig. 7  Schematic presentation of the spherical coordinate system for a single NP (a), where r is the radius with the origin fixed at the centre of the NP, r0 is the radius of NP, rC is the radius of the cell; and for the NP assembly (b), the cylindrical coordinates are R, and Z, where Rb is the radius of radiation beam, the small solid circles represent NPs, dashed circles represent the boundaries of cells, and the Z axis is directed along the direction of radiation propagation presented by the dashed arrows. 
The one-dimensional Beer law can be used for the description of radiation transfer inside two-component system with NPs 
I(Z, R, t) = I(Z = 0, R, t)exp(−αextZ)
(4.1)αext is the coefficient of extinction (absorption and scattering) of radiation by the medium loaded with NPs, αext = αabs1 + αsca1 + αabs0 + αsca0, αabs1, αsca1 are the coefficients of absorption and scattering by pure surrounding medium; αabs0 = N0SSKabs, αsca0 = N0SSKsca are the coefficients of radiation absorption and scattering by NPs; SS = πr02 is the surface square of the transverse section of the NP sphere; and N0 is the concentration of NPs in the medium. The characteristic length, Zext, of the radiation extinction by a heterogeneous system is determined by the equation  αext0, αext1 are accordingly the coefficients of extinction of radiation by the NPs and the medium solely, and Ksca and Kext are the efficiency factors of the radiation scattering and extinction by a single NP.118
The thermal processes of radiation–NP interaction with a single NP and its heating, heat transfer into the medium and NP cooling after the termination of action are based on the heat conduction equation for spherical geometry (3.2). The heat transfer eqn (3.1) for cylindrical geometry for all volumes of medium under consideration22 
(4.2)q1 = αabs1I0 + N0S0JC is the density of thermal energy generation due to the absorption of laser energy by the medium and heat transfer from NPs, and T1 is the medium temperature. The pressure in the medium is uniform and constant.
The initial and boundary conditions for (3.2) and (4.2) are: 
(4.3)
Other notations are the same as in part 3. The general system of eqn (4.1), (3.2) and (4.2) involves the radiation transfer equation, Beer’s law (4.1), the equations of single NP heat balance (3.2) for spherical NPs, and eqn (4.2) for two-dimensional heat transfer for whole volume under consideration. The use of eqn (4.2) means that NPs are assumed to be point-like heat sources with identical temperature in a physically infinitesimal volume. This means that the volume, occupied by NPs, N0V0 = N04/3πr03 ≪ 1, and the volume, occupied by heat aureoles around them with characteristic radii r0r ∼ 10r0, N0V0r = N04/3πr0r3 ≪ 1, are much smaller than the volume of the surrounding medium in 1 cm−3 of system. For example, for r0 = 25 nm, N0 = 1 × 1012 cm−3, N0V0 = 6.5 × 10−5 cm−3 ≪ 1 cm−3 and volume N0V0r = 6.4 × 10−2 cm−3 ≪ 1 cm−3 and the conditions of the use of NPs as point-like sources are fulfilled.
The energy conservation laws for a NP and medium in 1 cm−3 are fulfilled for different time instants during the radiation action and after its termination: 
(4.4)E0T∞ = ρ0c0V0T∞, E1T∞ = ρ1c1T∞ and E0T = ρ0c0V0T0, E1T = ρ1c1T1 are the initial and current thermal energies of a NP and medium, Q1C is thermal energy transferred from heated volume of medium to ambience. The parameters  and  (3.20) are used here for the description of the processes of light-to-heat conversion for a single NP.
4.2. Analytical modeling
The processes of light-to-heat conversion under action of radiation pulses with a pulse duration tP on NP assembly are described by next characteristic times, connected with the thermal processes inside and around single NPs and inside the volume of a heterogeneous system illuminated by a radiation beam:42 
(4.5)χ0, χ1 are the thermal diffusivities of the NP material (metal) and medium respectively. The distance of 2rC between the centers of neighboring NPs is equal to 2rC ≈ N0−1/3 and the cell radius rC is equal to rC = 1/2N0−1/3 (see Fig. 8). The characteristic time of the overlapping of temperature fields between neighboring NPs is equal to  (see (4.5)). Two macroscopic dimensions, Rb and Zext, are used in this model.
 Fig. 8  Qualitative presentation of the space dependencies of temperature T on r inside the two neighboring cells for some time instant and for the cases of tT1 > tP > tT0 (a), tTR, tTZ, tTN > tP > tT1, tT0 (b), tTR, tTZ > tP > tTN, tT1, tT0 (c), tP > tTR, tTZ, tTN, tT1, tT0 (d). Vertical dashed lines denote the boundaries of spherical cells (−rC, rC), vertical dashed-dotted lines denote the centers of NPs and cells, horizontal dashed lines denote the level of the medium temperature (c and d), scale marks (−r0, r0) denote of the radii of NPs. 
The characteristic times tT0, tT1 (4.5) describe the formation of quasi-stationary temperature distributions inside and around the single spherical NP accordingly, tTN is the characteristic time of the formation of quasi-stationary temperature distribution in the medium, when the overlapping of temperature fields between neighboring spherical NPs has been realized. The parameters tTR, tTZ are the characteristic times describing development of quasi-stationary heat transfer from heated medium volume illuminated by a radiation beam to adjacent ambience along the R and Z coordinates.
Estimation of these characteristic times gives the next values for a gold spherical NP with r0 = 25 nm in water – tT0 ∼ 1.2 × 10−10 s and tT1 ∼ 1 × 10−9 s. The value of tTN depends on the NP concentration, N0, and can change in wide intervals. For a heterogeneous system with concentrations N0 = 1 × 109, 1 × 1012 cm−3tTN is equal to tTN ∼ 4.4 × 10−5, 4.4 × 10−7 s. Experimental works64–103 have used laser beams with characteristic beam radii of Rb ∼ 0.1 cm and smaller. The characteristic times for heat removal from a heated medium volume beyond beams with radii Rb ∼ 0.1 cm are equal, τTR ∼ 1.6 s. The characteristic length, Zext, for gold NPs with r0 = 25 nm and N0 = 1012 cm−3 has approximately a value of about 0.1 cm.
Approximate values of the presented characteristic times satisfy the inequalities: tR ∼ tZ ≫ tTN ≫ t1T ≫ t0T. The values of radiation action duration tP can change in a wide interval from very short pulses with tP ∼ 10−12 to 10−13 s up to CW action and a few characteristic time intervals can be separated for the realization of different thermal processes taking into account the mentioned inequalities. The description and investigation of the processes of light-to-heat conversion can be divided into four steps, to which we can apply different assumptions to simplify the system of equations to get analytical solutions.
Here, four characteristic cases of the radiation interaction with pulse duration tP with NP assembly in the medium can be distinguished: (a) the pulse duration, tP, is greater than time, tT0, and is smaller than the characteristic time. tT1; (b) the duration. tP is greater than times tT0, tT1 and simultaneously tP is smaller than tTN, tTR, tTZ; (c) the duration tP is greater than times tTN, tT0, tT1 and simultaneously tP is smaller than tTR, tTZ; (d) the duration tP is greater than characteristic times tTR, tTZ, tTN, tT1, tT0: 
(4.6)
The characteristic times (4.5) belong to very different time intervals that allow division and investigation of thermal processes severely one after another. The time intervals were estimated for the realization of the conditions (4.6a–d) for gold NP with the radius r0 = 25 nm placed in water: (a) 1 × 10−9 > tP > 1 × 10−12 s, (b) 4.4 × 10−7 > tP > 1 × 10−9 s, (c) 1.6 s > tP > 4 × 10−7 s, for N0 = 1 × 1012 cm−3, (d) tP > 1.6 s.
The fulfilment of the condition (4.6a) means that the formation of quasi-stationary temperature distributions inside a single spherical NP has been terminated but not around one. The fulfilment of the condition (4.6b) means that under illumination and heating of NPs, quasi-stationary temperature distributions (thermal aureoles), described by (3.12), are formed around single NPs without the formation of a general temperature distribution in the medium between the NPs. The fulfilment of the condition (4.6c) means that temperature distributions between NPs, described by (4.2), are formed without the initiation of the heat exchange of this illuminated volume with the surrounding ambience, placed out of the radiation beam volume. The fulfilment of the condition (4.6d) means that a temperature field has been formed inside and around the radiation beam volume and heat exchange with the outer medium has been developed.
4.2.1. Radiation heating of a NP assembly by single NP heat sources. The consideration of the heating of a NP assembly by a single NP heat source is based on the fulfilment of the conditions tT1 > tP > tT0 (4.6a) and tTR, tTZ, tTN > tP > tT0, tτT1 (4.6b) without the formation of the general temperature field in the illuminated volume of the system during radiation action.The action of radiation pulses under the conditions tT1 > tP > tT0 (4.6a) leads to the fulfilment the condition of thermal confinement for the single NP and eqn (3.16) describes the temporal dependence of T0(t). The action of radiation pulses under the conditions tTR, tTZ, tTN > tP > tT0, tτT1 (4.6b) leads to the formation of quasi-stationary heat exchange of the NP with ambient medium.
Fig. 8 presents qualitative space distributions (dependencies) of temperature, T, on r inside two neighboring cells for some time instant and for the cases of tT1 > tP > tT0 (4.6a), tTR, tTZ, tTN > tP > tT1, tT0 (4.6b), tTR, tTZ > tP > tTN, tT1, tT0 (4.6c), tP > tTR, tTZ, tTN, tT1, tT0 (4.6d). The red, yellow and blue colors denote the heating of the NPs and medium up to high, medium and low (∼initial) temperatures.
Fig. 9 presents the analytical temporal dependencies of the NP temperature, T0, and parameters P2, P3 on t for different NP radii, r0 = 5, 25, 100 nm, In = I0Kabs = 1 × 102, 1.6 × 102, 1.65 × 103 W cm−2, and tP = 1 × 10−9 s determined on the basis of the analytical dependencies (3.14), (3.15), (3.23) and (3.24). The values of tT1 for the presented values of the NP radii r0 = 5, 25, 100 nm are respectively equal to tT1 ≈ 4.4 × 10−11, 1.1 × 10−9, 1.8 × 10−8 s. Next, inequalities are respectively fulfilled for r0 = 5, 25, 100 nm tP = 1 × 10−9 s ≫ tT1 tP ∼ tT1, tP ≪ tT1. The temporal dependencies of T0 on t have significant features for different values of r0. For r0 = 5 nm the NP heating up to a maximum temperature, Tmax, is realized very rapidly till t ∼ 1 × 10−10 s, and after that the absorption of energy is compensated by heat losses because of heat conduction. For r0 = 25, 100 nm the temperature T0 achieves the value of Tmax exactly at time instant t = tP at the end of pulse action. After the radiation pulse is turned off, a NP gives up energy to medium for time interval of about τ0. Its temperature, T0, moves down and becomes equal to the initial temperature, T∞. The cooling of a NP with r0 = 5 nm is realized very quickly, and the cooling of a NP with r0 = 25, 100 nm is realized rather slowly.
 Fig. 9  The dependencies of NP temperature T0 (a) for r0 = 5 (solid, 1), 25 (dashed, 2), 100 (dashed-dotted, 3) and parameters P2 (b), P3 (c) on t for r0 = 5 (1), 25 (2), 100 (3) nm, In = 1 × 102 (1), 1.6 × 102 (2), 1.65 × 103 (3) W cm−2, tP = 1 × 10−9 s. 
It is interesting to note the different time intervals in which sharp increases of the values of P2 and decreases of P3 are realized. Some points of the curve are seen at the time instant tP = 1 × 10−9 s, when the radiation action is turned off.
The cooling of the NP assembly is accompanied by overlapping of thermal aureoles from neighboring NPs, and the heating of the surrounding medium: because of the heat exchange with the NPs, its temperature is increased.

4.2.2. Heating of the medium by heat exchange with an irradiated NP assembly. The thermal energy of the surrounding water at an initial temperature, T∞ = 273 K, is equal to E1T∞ ≈ 1.14 × 103 J cm−3, and it is much bigger than thermal the energy E0T∞ ≈ 4.2 × 10−2 J cm−3 of the NP assembly of gold NPs with r0 = 25 nm and with a high NP concentration N0 = 1012 cm−3. It leads to the heating of the NP assembly to a maximum medium temperature, T0M = 373 K, without water vapor bubble formation by “short” radiation pulse action. Its following cooling cannot heat the surrounding water to a noticeable value of temperature and medium heating is negligible. On the other hand, for the train of short pulses, a single pulse with a “long” pulse duration can be used for remarkable heating of medium, because of the developed heat exchange of the heated NPs with the medium during radiation action.Consideration of this case is based on the fulfilment of the condition (4.6c) tTR, tTZ > tP > tTN, tT0, tT1 and is presented below. The solution of eqn (3.8) with the boundary condition T(r → ∞, t) = T1(t), taking into account the heating of medium by exchange with hot NPs with increasing of the temperature T1(t) has the form 
(4.7)
The system of equations which describes these processes has the next form from (3.6) and (4.2) and (4.7), without taking into account heat conduction inside and outside the illuminated (heated) volume of the heterogeneous system for a = 0:42 
(4.8)with the initial condition: 
T0(t = 0) = T∞, T1(t = 0) = T∞
(4.9)
This is the two-temperature model for the NP and medium temperatures, which is somewhat analogous to the two-temperature model for electron and lattice temperatures under the action of short pulses on metals or metallic NPs (see (2.1)).
Fig. 8c presents the qualitative dependencies of temperature T on r inside the two neighboring cells for some time instant tP > t > 10−5 s and for the case of T1 > T∞, taking into account the heating of the medium by heat exchange with the irradiated NP assembly, and increasing of the medium temperature T1.
The solutions of (4.8) and (4.9) have the forms:   
(4.10)cρ = c1ρ1 + 4πr03c0ρ0N0/3 is the heat capacity of the heterogeneous system for 1 g, I0Kabsπr02tN0 = Qabs(t)N0. The characteristic time  determines the dependencies of temperatures T0 and T1 at time t. The value of τ01 will be equal to τ0, when N0 = 0. The estimation of the characteristic time  for a gold NP with radius r0 = 25 nm placed in water gives the values:  and up to extremely high values of NP concentrations N0 > 1015 cm−3 the influence of the NP assembly on τ01 is negligible and τ01 ≈ τ0.
Cooling of the NP after the pulse action is determined by the expressions for t > tP from (4.8), (4.9): 
(4.11)T0M and T1M are the values of the NP and medium temperatures at t = tP, for t → ∞; stationary values of NP and medium temperatures are equal to each other  
Energy, QC, can be analytically calculated using (3.20) and the expressions for JC (4.7), T (4.11) taking into account Tmax = T(t = tP), tmax = tP for the period of time [0, tP]: 
(4.12)for t > tP 
(4.13)for t = tP the values of QC(tP) (4.12) and (4.13) are equal to each other, for t → ∞ .
The parameters P2, P3 (3.20) for heat exchange between NPs and the medium are presented from (4.12), (4.13) 
(4.14)
Fig. 10 presents the temporal dependencies of the temperatures T0 of a gold NP assembly with r0 = 25 nm, N0 = 1 × 1012 cm−3, and T1 of surrounding water on t/tP for tP = 1 × 10−2 s, 1 × 10−4 s, 1 × 10−5 s, 1 × 10−6 s determined on the base of the analytical eqn (4.10) and (4.11). The intensity of radiation pulses has been chosen in a manner that allows heating of the NPs up to the temperature 373 K and to avoid the boiling of surrounding water.
 Fig. 10  The dependencies of NP T0 (dashed-dotted) and medium T1 (solid) temperatures on t/tP for r0 = 25 nm, N0 = 1 × 1012 cm−3 and tP = 1 × 10−2 s, In = 2.1 × 103 W cm−2 (a), tP = 1 × 10−4 s, In = 1.75 × 105 W cm−2 (b), tP = 1 × 10−5 s, In = 6.5 × 105 W cm−2 (c), tP = 1 × 10−6 s, In = 9.0 × 105 W cm−2 (d). 
The temporal dependencies of T0 on t have significant features for different values of tP. The heating of the NPs and their intensive heat exchange with the surrounding water start immediately after irradiation commencement for tP = 1 × 10−2, 1 × 10−4 s (see Fig. 10a and b). The energy release in the NPs and the heat exchange lead to a rapid increase of the temperatures T0 and T1 in time with small differences between them, for tP = 1 × 10−2, 1 × 10−4 s T0 − T1 is equal 2, 16 K respectively. The temperatures T0 and T1 achieve their own maximum values to the termination of radiation action t = tP. The action of radiation pulses with a pulse duration tP ≥ 10−4 s leads to significant heating of the medium by heat exchange with hot NPs during “long” pulse action and ΔT = T0 − T1 is small.
The action of radiation pulses with a pulse duration of tP = 1 × 10−5 s, 1 × 10−6 s leads to moderate heating of the medium because of shortening of the pulse duration and decreasing of NP heat exchange with the medium. The temperature T0 achieves the value of (0.7–0.9)Tmax up to time instant t ∼ 1 × 10−2tP. After that, the heat release in the NPs is approximately compensated by heat exchange with the surrounding medium and during the rest of tP T0 it slowly achieves Tmax at t = tP. Stationary overheating of the NP assembly in comparison with the medium is constant during radiation action.
For a pulse duration of tP < 10−7 to 10−8 s, the regime of heat exchange transforms into heating only the NPs without significant medium heating for the presented values of N0.
The NPs give up thermal energy to the medium for a time interval of about 1 × 10−8 s after the termination of the pulse with tP = 1 × 10−6 s and their temperature T0 moves down and equals some stationary temperature. The cooling process in the heterogeneous system after the termination of radiation action is carried out under formation of the general distribution of T1(R, Z, t) and the following heat exchange with the ambience.
If the condition tP ≫ τ01 is obeyed for “long” radiation action and the transfer of NP heat to ambient medium determines the values of temperatures, then: 
(4.15)
In this case temperatures T0 and T1 increase in time t and will have no stationary maximum values in the time interval 0 < t < tP. Stationary overheating of NPs in comparison with the medium T0 − T1 is constant during the radiation action:  
Thermal confinement for the irradiated volume of the heterogeneous system can be fulfilled if the condition tTN < tP < τ01 is obeyed for short pulses and a high concentration of NPs in medium. The expansion of the exponential function in (4.10) gives the values of T0 on t and T1: 
(4.16)
For “short” radiation pulses the heat exchange of the NPs with the surrounding medium can be practically ignored and T0 is proportional t and the medium temperature T1 ≈ T∞. The expression for T0 is equal to (3.18) for the heating of a single NP.

4.3. Heat exchange of the heated volume of a system with an ambience
The consideration of this case is based on the fulfilment of the condition (4.6d): tP > tR, tZ, tTN, tT0, tT1, with the formation of the temperature field in the medium and heat exchange of the heated volume of the system with the ambience. The stationary solution, when energy release in the NPs and medium in the irradiated volume of system is compensated by heat exchange with the surrounding,, and the temperatures of NPs and medium have stationary values T0S and T1S and NP overheating in comparison with medium is equal  
For the general description of the light-to-heat conversion processes in this case the system of eqn (3.2), (4.2) and (4.3) have numerically be solved with boundary and initial conditions (4.3).
5. Applications of light-to-heat conversion and nanoparticle heating in laser and photo-thermal nanotechnology
The processes of radiation absorption, light-to-heat conversion and heating of single NPs, their assemblies, and the surrounding medium under pulsed laser irradiation are of great interest for various applications in many fields and are the base for further thermal applications of single NPs and NPs assemblies.1–105
5.1. Light-to-heat conversion
Single NPs and NP assemblies are applied as active agents for energy conversion in different fields of nanotechnology. General aspects of NP heating, heat conduction and energy conversion have been presented.1–63 Photothermal characterization of nanogold under conditions of resonant excitation and energy transfer have been studied.44 The photothermal conversion efficiency of gold nanocrystals and dispersions has been investigated.45,58 Generating heat with metal NPs and investigations of gold NP assemblies as heaters and actuators including the melting and collective plasmon resonances have been carried out.54–56 The effect of NP heating has been investigated through light localization57 and localized heating of nanostructures by coherent laser pulses.59 There is significant value for light-to-heat conversion in NP assemblies in optofluidics for energy applications.61–63
5.2. Nanomedicine
Nanomedicine is now a rapidly growing area for application of the latest achievements in modern physics, chemistry, biology and other sciences. The role of physical technologies through discussion of several established and emerging treatments has been examined.131 Minimal access surgery, photonics, nanotechnology, ultrasound, and interventional MRI are being exploited. The fundamental physical principles involved in the application of each treatment to medical practice have also been presented.
The heating of single NPs and NP assemblies by pulsed and CW radiation reviewed in this article are successfully used in nanomedicine for different purposes.64–77,131–136 The most important area of applications of the results presented in this review is laser and photonic nanomedicine using NPs. The development of novel NPs and their use in biomedicine has received much attention in recent years. Significant advances have been made in the synthesis of NPs with controlled geometry (size and shape) and physicochemical properties.
Metallic (gold, silver, others) and core–shell NPs are readily synthesised structures that absorb light strongly at plasmonic wavelengths to generate thermal energy which induces photothermal destruction of malignant tissue. The selection of NPs for nanomedical thermal applications is carried out for more effective nanomedicine through particle design.70 Thermo-optical analysis and selection of the properties of absorbing NPs has been made for laser applications in cancer nanotechnology.71 Concordance should be reached with regard to the type, size and concentration of NPs, with the identification of a more consistent and reproducible irradiation regime. NPs measuring 1 to 100 nm in diameter are being developed as contrast optical and thermal agents, drug-delivery vehicles, and diagnostic devices, which are now being studied in clinical trials.
The targeted nanodelivery of drugs and their thermal release at their target is one of the important fields in laser nanomedicine.74–76 The delivery of molecules into cells using carbon NPs thermally activated by femtosecond laser pulses has been investigated.74 Reviews of the recent advances in targeted NP drug delivery to melanoma have been presented.75,76
The controlled injection of nanosized objects into living cells with light offers promising prospects for the development of novel molecular delivery strategies.77,104 The particles can be injected into the cells through a combination of plasmonic heating and optical force. The short exposure times are sufficient to perforate the cell membrane and inject the particles into cells with a survival rate of >70%.
In cancer diagnostics, NPs can be used for simultaneous profiling of tumour biomarkers and for detection of multiple genes using NPs conjugated to antibodies.132 Optically tunable nanoparticle contrast agents were applied for early cancer detection.64
Medical applications of NPs are a rapidly developing area of nanotechnology that raises new possibilities in the diagnosis and treatment of human cancers. NPs with particular antibody coatings attached to abnormal cells (cancerous or otherwise) are being researched as a noninvasive method for selectively killing cancer cells. NPs can be heated with visible/infrared laser pulses, heating the surrounding area of the cell to its point of death.
The results for single NP heating are applied in nanomedicine for selective cell targeting with light-absorbing NPs and nanophotothermolysis of cells by radiation pulses.37,65 The results for NP assembly heating are widely applied in nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy of cancer.66–69 They include a comparative study of heating for different particles types,66 investigations of near-infrared resonant nanoshells and gold NPs for photothermal cancer therapy.67,68 The comparative efficiencies of the photothermal destruction of malignant cells using antibody-coated Au nanostructures have been defined.69 Fig. 11 presents the results of laser pulse action on a single NP attached to the cell membrane (Fig. 11a, the results of heating of single NP, part 3) and on tissue site with the NP assembly (Fig. 11b, the results of heating of NP assembly, part 4). As the thermal results of laser pulse action on NPs consist of protein denaturation and irreversible damage of single cells, tumors are consequently targeted.

Combined photothermal therapy and diagnostics (theranostics) is a very interesting direction for nanomedicine. Near-infrared resonant nanoshells have been applied for combined optical imaging and photothermal cancer therapy.72 Gold hybrid NPs have been applied for targeted phototherapy and cancer imaging.73 Computer modeling of the optical properties and heating of spherical gold and silica–gold NPs have been investigated for laser combined imaging and photothermal treatment.107
The preliminary results of clinic trials for thermal cancer treatment with NPs have been presented.133–136 After decades of basic research, targeted nanotherapies that use NPs have now been developed that offer improved survival for patients with metastatic melanoma.133 Recent advances in the application of multifunctional nanocarriers are widely expected to change melanoma therapy and can be used for targeted drug delivery to melanoma, melanoma nanotheranostics, combination therapy, and melanoma clinical trials.
The focus of the review134 was to provide an overview of the NPs that have been devised for the detection and treatment of various types of cancer. Many efforts have resulted in improved NP biocompatibility and active targeting of tumor tissues, leading to the development of a diverse range of nanostructures that can recognize cancers, deliver anticancer drugs and destroy tumors by a variety of therapeutic techniques. The current state-of-the art of NPs for cancer diagnosis and treatment were presented and the emerging possibilities and future concepts of NPs were discussed for applications in anticancer therapy.
Thermo-chemotherapy has proved to be effective in optimizing the efficacies of cancer treatments.135 Some photothermal NPs responsive to visible and near infrared light provide new opportunities for simultaneous and targeted delivery of heat and chemotherapeutics to the tumor sites in pursuit of synergistic effects for efficacy enhancement. Recent studies using nanostructures for thermo-chemotherapy in cancer treatment have been carried out, guided by multimodal imaging. The combination of hyperthermia and chemotherapeutic agents has been investigated as a new approach for the treatment of malignant melanoma.
The review136 examines the efficacy, potential challenges and toxicity from in vitro and in vivo applications of different NPs in cancers. The application of gold NPs to in vivo studies with GI adenocarcinoma have demonstrated excellent therapeutic outcomes but photothermal irradiation regimes and types of NPs should be selected prior to cancer clinical trials. There is evidence of the translational potential of GNPs to be complimentary to surgery and feasible in the photothermal therapy of GI cancer. Gold NPs are one of the most potentially useful NPs. This is especially true in cancer therapeutics because of their plasmonic and photothermal properties. The application and efficacy of gold NPs in both the diagnosis and treatment of GI cancers are reviewed.
All studies conducting photothermal therapy with selected NPs showed cancer cell destruction and in vivo effects ranging from tumor volume regression to complete remission. Nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy has shown great potential to fulfil medical needs for treatment of tumors.
5.3. Photochemistry and thermal catalysis
Investigations of the properties of NPs for photochemistry and thermal catalysis have been carried out in many publications.78–88 A special interest is the radiation heating of NPs, and its application to catalysis. Heterogeneous catalysis mediated by plasmon heating has been applied.78 Some aspects of colloidal nanoparticle stability, catalytic activity, and recycling potential have been presented.79 Visible-light-enhanced catalytic oxidation reactions on plasmonic silver nanostructures have been investigated.80 The main problems of surface plasmon-mediated photothermal chemistry and applications of nanoplasmonics for chemistry have been studied.81,82 The optical and photocatalytic properties of bismuth nanospheres prepared by a facile thermolysis method have been investigated.83 Enhancing colloidal metallic nanocatalysis with sharp edges and corners for solid NPs and the cage effect for hollow ones86 and tunable plasmonic NPs with catalytically active “high-index facets”84 have been investigated. The use of the catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles has been presented.85,87
5.4. Laser processing
Laser processing is mainly based on the thermal processes of NP heating.89–105 Laser processing of NPs placed in solid dielectrics has been investigated.89–91 A method for investigating laser damage initiation by investigation of localized pulsed laser interaction with sub-micronic gold particles embedded in silica has been presented.89 A review of ultra-short pulsed laser engineered metal–glass nanocomposites has been presented.90 Reshaping of gold nanoparticles by ultrafast laser irradiation inside a silica-based glass, studied through optical properties, has been investigated.91 Fabrication of NP assemblies and complex nanostructures has been investigated in many publications. Laser-induced assemblies of gold nanoparticles have been fabricated into colloidal crystals.93 Tetragonal zirconia spheres fabricated by carbon-assisted selective laser heating in a liquid medium have been investigated.94
A set of processes of heating, melting, and reshaping have been investigated in experimental works.95–103 The photothermal reshaping of gold nanoparticles has been investigated in a plasmonic absorber,95 including the laser-induced shape transformation of gold nanoparticles below the melting point: the effect of surface melting. The results of the investigations of the nanoscale heating of laser irradiated single gold nanoparticles in a liquid,95 including a study of the laser-induced heating and melting of gold nanoparticles by time-resolved X-ray scattering96 have been presented. The mechanisms of the laser-induced size reduction of colloidal silver and gold NPs studied by laser pulse excitation have been presented.92,102 The particle heating–melting–evaporation model can be applied for understanding the mechanism of such complicated processes, such as particle-size reduction and submicrometer spherical particle growth, as well as other processes that occur when colloidal particles are irradiated by a pulsed laser.92 The structure diagram of gold nanoparticles in solution under irradiation of UV pulse laser has been investigated.101 Studies on the interaction of pulsed lasers with plasmonic gold nanoparticles toward light manipulation, heat management, and nanofabrication under action of high outer pressure up to 100 atm and more have been presented.97 The effect of the action of a single laser pulse on NPs has been studied,99,100 including the effect of a single femtosecond pulse on gold nanoparticles.99 Single laser pulse effects on suspended Au-nanoparticle size distributions and morphology have been investigated.100
5.5. Imaging and sensing
The applications of NP heating for imaging and sensing purposes are important for diagnostics in material sciences and medicine. For gold and silver nanoparticle sensing and imaging, the sensitivity of plasmon response to size, shape and metal composition has been applied.106 Plasmonic nanomaterials have been applied for biodiagnostics.109 Photothermal imaging of nanoparticles and cells using the nonlinear thermal effects of laser–NP interaction have been carried out.108 Plasmonic heat induction (by laser activation) leads to significant changes in the composition of the hard protein corona adsorbed on the gold nanostructures. These results may define new applications in vivo for NPs with hyperthermia capabilities, and better define the likely interactions of cells with NPs after plasmonic heating.112
Plasmonic nanoparticles can lead to extreme confinement of light and heat inside NPs.113 Optical trapping and manipulation of micrometer and nanometer particles has been investigated for the purposes of various applications.104,105
6. Conclusion
This review analyses the models and the results of light-to-heat conversion and heating of single NPs and NP assemblies placed in a medium, under laser action pulses, heat exchange and thermal conduction, and cooling after the termination of radiation action.
The absorption of short pico- and femtosecond laser pulses by electrons in metallic NPs, electron–phonon coupling and lattice heating is discussed on the basis of linear temperature dependence for electron–phonon coupling factor and linear (for gold, silver, copper, tungsten) and reverse (for nickel, platinum) temperature dependencies for electron heat capacity. Novel analytical solutions (part 2.2) determine the temporal changes of the electron and lattice temperatures, the characteristic time τeph, and can be used for estimations and descriptions of different experimental situations.
The heating of a single NP, heat transfer by thermal conduction to the surrounding medium and cooling after the termination of laser action are considered. The heating of a NP up to high temperature, in some cases higher than melting temperature of NP material, leads to the necessity to take into account the dependence of NP absorption and the thermal properties of the ambient medium on temperature. The temperature dependencies of the optical and thermo-physical parameters of NPs and their surrounding media have been taken into account under theoretical modeling of the processes of laser–NP interaction, absorption of laser radiation, NP heating, heat transfer and cooling after the termination of a laser pulse action; and they determine the nonlinear dynamics of NP heating and cooling.
The developed analytical model for the description of NP heating, heat dissipation and exchange, with an ambience, has been examined and its accuracy and the areas of its applicability have been estimated and established through comparison with the computer analysis and the analytical results. The comparison and definite coincidences of the analytical results with the computer results of heating of NPs by CW radiation and laser pulses validate the developed analytical model. The computer simulation confirms the possibility of using the analytical model for the description of the temporal dependence of NP temperature, T0, and the outward distributions, T(r), with sufficient accuracy for the range of pulse durations, tP > 10−7 s, for NP heating and cooling processes, for NP heating for the interval 10−12 ≤ tP ≤ 10−10 s with the errors <10% and NP heating and cooling in the interval of pulse durations 1 × 10−10 < tP < 1 × 10−8 s with errors of ∼20–30%.
The possibility of thermal confinement (saving thermal energy practically without heat exchange with the surroundings) has been established for a single NP (part 3.4) and for the irradiated volume of a medium with NP assemblies (part 4.3) for determined time intervals. The fulfilment of thermal confinement means the achievement of the maximum value of NP and medium temperatures and heat localization within the NP and irradiated medium volume during defined time intervals without heat exchange with the ambience.
The characteristic case of the radiation interaction with the pulse duration tP with a NP assembly in a medium were distinguished and four characteristic time intervals were separated for realization of different thermal processes (part 4.3). In cases (a) and (b) the heating of a NP assembly is considered as single NP heat sources without formation of the general temperature field in medium. The case (c) describes the heating of the medium by heat exchange with an irradiated NP assembly and with the formation of the general temperature field in the illuminated volume of medium. The case (d) describes the heat exchange of the heated volume of a heterogeneous system (NPs and medium) with an ambience and the formation of the temperature field out of the illuminated volume of a system. The radiation action of “long” pulses (case c) allows effective heating of the surrounding medium.
The results of the analytical description of the NP assembly heating under action of pulsed optical (laser) radiation and its cooling after the termination of radiation action are presented. The influence on the efficiency of the light-to-heat conversion of the following factors is discussed: NPs parameters (their radii, absorption efficiency factor, density and heat capacity of NP material, and concentration), the characteristics of the radiation (wavelength, pulse duration, and radiation beam radius), the medium (its density, heat capacity, heat conduction coefficient, and characteristic length of radiation extinction).
The analytical modeling has a few advantages in comparison with the computer modeling because its results are much simpler and convenient and can be used for the quantitative description of different experiments on the basis of simple equations. The comparison with the results of numerical modeling shows that the presented analytical model gives a quantitatively (in determined time intervals) and qualitatively correct description of the dynamics of heating and cooling of the surrounding medium and single NPs, NP assemblies, taking into account their melting and solidification. It is quite suitable for the modeling of the thermal processes of the radiation–NP interaction. The reviewed analytical models demonstrate the advantages and the novelty because of the possibility to describe entirely the processes of NPs and medium heating, heat exchange and cooling for light-to-heat conversion.
These models and results are crucial for understanding photo-thermal effects in NPs and for the description of the light-to-heat conversion processes under optical (laser) radiation heating of a single NP and a NP assembly. They can represent useful tools for different materials of NPs and surroundings and can be applied for the estimation and the interpretation of experimental results. These results present a theoretical platform for the description and the applications of the thermal processes of laser–nanoparticle interactions in photo-thermal nanotechnology, nanoenergy, laser processing of nanoparticles, laser nanomedicine, nonlinear optical diagnostics, etc.
