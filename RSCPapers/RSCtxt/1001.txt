    , Accepted 16th September 2021First published on 14th October 2021AbstractIn their comment, Nienhaus et al. propose an alternative interpretation for the origin of the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance increase observed in our work. However, in this reply we have clarified that the fundamental reason for the improved perovskite solar cell (PVSC) device performance is owing to the synergistic effects including the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) and additive passivation. The divergence over the cause of improved photovoltaic performance has led Nienhaus et al. to put forward another alternative interpretation, in which it is mainly ascribed to the rubrene-assisted defect passivation and hole extraction facilitation. Here, the control experiments are utilized to verify that the aforementioned synergistic effect is the reason for the device performance improvement.
We have demonstrated an original method in prolonging the near infrared (NIR) response of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), minimizing the sub-band-gap photon transmission loss, and eventually boosting the photovoltaic performance. Meanwhile, we are happy to see others in the field commenting on it and bursting out new ideas. Recently, Nienhaus et al. propose an alternative interpretation for the cause of the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance enhancement in our work. In their comment, Nienhaus et al. have put forward that the increased device efficiency can be attributed to the addition of rubrene during device fabrication rather than the triplet–triplet annihilation up-conversion (TTA-UC) effect. However, we would like to elucidate that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement of PVSCs is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects including TTA UC and rubrene-assisted defect passivation by cation-π interaction.
In response to the comment from the Nienhaus group, we have conducted the control experiments to emphasize that the TTA UC effect contributed to the improved PCE. From Fig. 1, it is evident that when both rubrene and dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) are incorporated into the PVSC device, the PCE improvement is the most significant. Furthermore, the separate addition of rubrene during device fabrication is also favorable to the PVSC performance compared with the reference. The corresponding parameters for PVSC devices are shown in Table 1. It is deduced that the coexistence of DBP and rubrene is the most conducive to the improved photovoltaic performance due to the synergistic effect. In the UC system investigated here, the NIR photons are first weakly absorbed by MAPbI3, following which the NIR light can be converted into visible light at 620 nm (emission wavelength of DBP) through the TTA UC mechanism and then reabsorbed by the MAPbI3 film again. In this way, the EQE value is raised dramatically above 600 nm. Hence, we believe that the multifunctional UC layer is beneficial for enhancing the PVSC photovoltaic performance. The TTA UC mechanism is also confirmed in some other research studies where a predicted promotion in the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells has been reported when the TTA UC effect is introduced.1,2

The scenario of “two steps back–one step forward” proposed by Nienhaus et al. seems inappropriate. Rather, the “backward is to go forward better” is a more reasonable explanation. The radiative limit presumes that all recombination processes within a solar cell are radiative and all emitted photons can escape from the cell.3 However, non-radiative recombination losses are ineluctable in PVSCs and the charge carriers cannot be extracted to electrodes completely. Herein, the re-emitted higher energy visible light can produce additional photocurrent. Therefore, the TTA UC mechanism provides a new avenue for the minimized sub-band-gap photon transmission loss and the enhanced PVSC photovoltaic performance.
