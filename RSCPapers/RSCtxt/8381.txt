    , Accepted 12th December 2021First published on 14th December 2021AbstractOrganic electronics have the advantages of low manufacturing cost, light weight, good flexibility, and good conformity to different surfaces. They are ideal for many emerging applications such as wearable electronics, sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT), e-paper, smart labels and tags, intelligent packaging, medical devices, smart windows, so on and so forth. As organic electronic products begin to enter the market, an issue has become increasingly prominent, that is, the lack of power supplies suitable for these devices. Since many organic electronic products are designed to operate off-grid frequently or continuously, batteries are usually used to power these devices. The existing batteries are cumbersome and need to be charged frequently with grid power, which is not only inconvenient, but also impractical for some applications. To meet this urgent need, self-rechargeable batteries that generate and store electrical energy in a single device have recently been extensively studied. These batteries can be self-recharged using ubiquitous clean and sustainable energy sources such as light, atmospheric oxygen, body movement, airflow, or wind. Furthermore, they can be integrated with other types of electronic devices to form an autonomous self-powered system. Some prototype self-rechargeable batteries have already shown promising performance in powering light-emitting diodes, sensors, LCD displays, etc. Certain types of organic electronics, such as organic piezoelectric generators, organic solar cells, organic batteries, and organic electrochromic devices, which can collect environmental energy and convert it into electrical energy or store electrical energy, have been playing a key role in the development of self-rechargeable batteries. This article reviews the latest developments in various types of self-rechargeable batteries enabled by or suitable for organic electronic products. The working mechanism, performance, challenges, and the future research directions of self-rechargeable batteries are discussed.

1. Introduction
Organic electronics enabled by organic electronic materials, including organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) or organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic resistors, organic batteries, etc. have received much attention in the past few decades.1–9 Compared with traditional electronic products based on inorganic materials, organic electronics are inexpensive, thin, light, nontoxic, and mechanically robust (flexible, bendable, stretchable, and foldable), so they are very suitable for flexible displays, mobile devices, smart packaging, artificial intelligence, flexible solar cells, and sensors.
With the rapid development and use of portable devices, wearable electronics, and ubiquitous sensors, it has become increasingly important to develop corresponding compact and steady power supplies to drive these electronic devices.10–12 However, conventional rechargeable batteries need to be charged using an external electrical power source. This is problematic for the aforementioned applications, because (1) these applications are often difficult to connect the grid power; (2) the number of IoT sensors is huge and many of them are located in inaccessible places, so it is impractical to charge these sensors regularly; (3) the battery charger is bulky, heavy and expensive. If the battery can use some ubiquitous energy sources in the surrounding environment (such as light, wind, human body movement, etc.) for self-charging, can be made compact, and can be integrated with the electronic appliances, it will greatly promote the widespread application of the afore-mentioned electronic products. In fact, a battery that can be recharged by itself, or a self-rechargeable battery, was proposed as early as the 1970's in some patents13,14 and first demonstrated by Orelc et al. in 2002.15 It should be noted that a self-rechargeable battery is an integrated entity of the power generation and storage units, analogous to an integrated circuit on a silicon wafer. The self-rechargeable battery here is obviously different from the self-charging system that simply assembles an independent power generation unit and a rechargeable battery unit, for example, the light rechargeable battery unit widely used in autonomous solar lamps consisting of silicon solar cells and rechargeable batteries. The latter does not have the advantages of light weight and compactness required by emerging wearable electronics, IoT sensors, etc.
The photo energy of sunlight and indoor light is readily available, so it is very convenient to use light as an energy source for self-rechargeable batteries. The first self-rechargeable photo battery demonstrated by Orelc et al. contains a WO3 layer behind the TiO2 layer of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which stores charge generated by the solar cell under illumination at the open circuit voltage and discharges when an external load is connected.15 In 2007, Dennler et al. successfully integrated an organic solar cell (OSC) and a lithium–polymer battery into a flexible 1 × 66 × 35 mm3 self-rechargeable battery with a nominal capacity of 100 mA h and an overall weight of only 3.3 g.16 In 2017, Ahmad et al. demonstrated a photo-rechargeable battery based on a perovskite solar cell (PSC).17 The perovskite layer can store energy, and once it is exhausted, it can be charged under illumination (∼420–650 nm), reaching a capacity of up to 100 mA h g−1.
Another type of easily available clean energy is mechanical energy generated by body movement, wind, etc., which can be converted to electricity via piezoelectric or triboelectric effect.18–24 In 2012, Wang et al. used a piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) film as the separator in a LIB.25 The mechanical strain of the PVDF film under a pressure generates a piezoelectric potential, which drives the migration of Li ions from the cathode to the anode, thereby charging the battery. In 2017, Yang et al. combined a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a solid state LIB into one entity.26 The device installed on the shoe can charge the battery and power LEDs by walking, proving the feasibility of using self-rechargeable batteries for wearable electronic products. The same group also fabricated a self-rechargeable battery by joining the cathodes of two flexible LIBs with a hexafluoropropene–tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (FEP) film.27 The wind-induced vibration of the FEP film causes the coupling between triboelectricity and electrostatic induction to charge the battery. The device has potential applications for outdoor sensor systems that can be self-powered by wind.
Oxygen in the air has a strong oxidizing power and can also be used as a clean energy source to charge batteries through redox reactions. Niu et al. developed a Zn-ion battery using a CaV6O16·3H2O cathode.28 The battery can be self-recharged by the redox reaction between the discharged cathode and oxygen in the ambient air, achieving a capacity of 239mA h g−1. Lou and Sun et al. fabricated an electrochemical cell using Prussian blue (PB) and Al as electrodes.29 The discharged cell can be spontaneously self-recharged by oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte.
Although self-rechargeable batteries are a relatively new interdisciplinary research topic that spans organic electronics and batteries, they have already demonstrated appealing potential in numerous applications. In order to further explore this technology and ultimately make it a commercial reality, it is important to understand the status quo, working mechanism and problems of various types of self-rechargeable batteries. In this review, we summarize the latest developments in self-rechargeable batteries according to energy sources: mechanical energy, light energy, and oxygen in the air (Fig. 1), introduce their device structures, materials, and working mechanisms, discuss their advantages and challenges, and put forward an outlook on the future development trend.

2. Research progress of various self-rechargeable batteries
2.1 Self-rechargeable batteries powered by mechanical energy
A typical rechargeable LIB is composed of a cathode material, a graphite (or other Li storage material) anode, and an electrolyte (Fig. 2). Commonly used cathode materials include lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP), lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2, LCO), lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4, LMO), lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNixMnyCozO2, NMC), and lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (LiNiCoAlO2, NCA). The freshly made LIBs are in the discharged state. When an appropriate electrical potential is applied between the cathode and anode current collectors, electrons enter the cathode and leave the anode. The cathode material is oxidized, and the released Li ions from the cathode move to the anode through the electrolyte, and are inserted into the graphite as elemental Li, thereby charging the battery. When the charged battery is connected to an external load (discharged), the electrons of elemental Li in the anode will spontaneously pass through the external load and enter the cathode due to the potential difference between the cathode and the anode. The nearby Li ions in the electrolyte are inserted into the cathode material to balance the charge, while new Li ions leave the anode, diffuse through the electrolyte, and are intercalated in the cathode. An electrical power supply is used to charge conventional LIBs.
 Fig. 2  Schematic structure and working mechanism of a typical Li-ion battery (LIB) based on LiCoO2 (LCO). 
Piezoelectricity is electricity generated by external pressure (mechanical stress) applied to certain materials. The piezoelectric effect is caused by the formation of net electric polarization due to deformation of the crystal structure or re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress. Although many inorganic materials show piezoelectric effects, polymeric piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)30 are more suitable for flexible devices because they have excellent mechanical properties and can withstand frequent mechanical stress changes for a long time.
Wang's group reported the first self-rechargeable LIB that combined the electrical generation and storage processes in one device based on piezoelectric effect, the so-called self-charging power cell (SCPC).25 In this battery, a PVDF film with piezoelectric properties was used to replace the polyethylene (PE) separator commonly used in the conventional LIBs (Fig. 3a). LCO, TiO2 nanotubes (NTs), and LiPF6 were used as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte, respectively. When a periodic compressive stress is applied on the cathode collector Al foil, a piezoelectric potential is induced in the PVDF film, which acts as a charge pump to continuously drive Li ions to migrate from the cathode to the anode. This corresponds to the battery charging process. Fig. 3b shows the dependence of the battery charging voltage on the mechanical force and frequency. The battery charging voltage increases with increasing mechanical force at a constant frequency or increasing frequency at a constant force. When the mechanical force and the frequency are kept constant, the charging voltage is relatively stable. As shown in the inset image of Fig. 3b, several batteries connected in series can drive a commercial calculator for more than 10 min.

(h) Left: A typical self-rechargeable profile comprising three regions: a compression region inducing self-charging over an initial 200 s when continuous mechanical compression of 282 mJ was applied at 1.0 Hz to the battery, a galvanostatic (0.01 mA) discharge region immediately following the self-charging, and an equilibrium region with no current input; Right: Two self-rechargeable cycles with different applied forces.

Xue et al. developed a similar integrated self-rechargeable battery using a CuO/PVDF nanocomposite piezo-anode (Fig. 3c).31Fig. 3d shows the self-recharging process under a periodic mechanical stress and the subsequent discharging process. It can be clearly seen from the right side of Fig. 3d that the charging voltage decreases as the mechanical force decreases at a constant frequency of 1.0 Hz. In addition, Xing et al. found that a mesoporous nanostructured PVDF separator can promote the transport of Li ions, resulting in higher energy conversion and storage efficiencies of the SCPC (Fig. 3e).32 As shown in Fig. 3f, the charging voltage is stable under a force of 34 N at a frequency of 1.8 Hz during 50 cycles, indicating the good cycle stability of the self-rechargeable battery.
Similarly, Kim et al. fabricated a β-phase-rich piezoelectric PVDF separator with a highly porous architecture and used it to assemble a self-rechargeable LIB.33 The charge/discharge performance of the as-prepared self-rechargeable battery is greatly enhanced compared to the battery with highly stretched non- or less porous PVDF films. Among the various crystal structures of PDVF, the β-phase structure with the all-trans chain conformation has the largest net polarization, so the piezoelectric effect is the strongest.30 Therefore, ZnO nanoparticles were incorporated into PVDF as a nucleating agent to increase the β-phase content of PVDF. Then pores were formed after acid etching of ZnO to enhance Li ion diffusion. The schematic diagram in Fig. 3g shows the structure of the self-rechargeable battery wetted by a carbonate-based 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte. As shown on the left side of Fig. 3h, the typical self-rechargeable profile for this battery consists of three stages: (i) a periodic compression region that shows a self-rechargeable profile without external current input; (ii) a galvanostatic discharge region; (iii) a subsequent equilibrium region at the open-circuit voltage (Voc). The graph on the right side of Fig. 3h shows two self-rechargeable cycles under different mechanical forces without the equilibrium region. This work suggests that the well-defined porous PVDF separator is very useful for transporting Li ions between the anode and cathode of the self-rechargeable battery. It can enhance the generation of piezoelectric potential due to more significant deformation, thereby promoting the efficiency of self-rechargeable LIBs.
He et al. reported the fabrication of a flexible all-solid-state self-rechargeable battery using a solid mesoporous PVDF–LiPF6 film as a piezo-electrolyte (Fig. 4a).34 The solid composite piezo-electrolyte was formed by soaking the mesoporous PDVF film in a LiPF6 solution to trap the liquid electrolyte. When a periodic compressive force of 30 N at a frequency of 1 Hz was applied onto the battery, the voltage increased quickly from 25 mV to 473 mV within 240 s, as shown in Fig. 4b. All-solid-state self-rechargeable batteries have some significant advantages, including high safety, high energy density, flexible geometry, and high energy conversion/storage efficiency. They are very suitable for powering various wearable electronic devices, such as electronic bracelets, smart watches, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

The self-rechargeable LIBs discussed above are based on the structure of a conventional LIB, comprising a cathode, an anode, a separator, and a liquid electrolyte. The major difference is that a polarized PVDF film with piezoelectric effect is used in the self-rechargeable LIBs to replace the PE separator commonly used in the conventional LIBs. As shown in Fig. 4c, when the PVDF film is subjected to external pressure, it will compressively intersect in the vertical direction, resulting in a piezoelectric field from the cathode to the anode. Under the action of this piezoelectric electric field, Li ions in the electrolyte move from the vicinity of the cathode to the vicinity of the anode. The movement of Li ions changes the distribution of Li ions in the electrolyte, breaks the balance of cathode and anode redox reactions, and realizes the self-charging of the battery. The electrochemical reactions of anode and cathode for the above LCO-based self-rechargeable batteries are essentially the same as those of a conventional LCO battery, as shown below. LiCoO2 → Li1−xCoO2 + xLi+ + xe−(1) yC + xLi+ + xe− → LixCy(2)
The triboelectric effect is the generation of electricity (triboelectricity) when two materials contact and then separate, which is a common phenomenon in daily life. For example, when two different fabrics rub against each other, electrostatic charges are accumulated due to the triboelectric effect. Yang's group reported a self-rechargeable battery that combines a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a LMO-based solid LIB for self-powered wearable electronics through scavenging vibration energy.26Fig. 5a illustrates the schematic diagram of the self-rechargeable battery with two separated layers. The periodic contact and separation between the anode (TiO2 nanotubes) and the triboelectric FEP (its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 5a) film induced triboelectric effect and electrostatic charges, delivering an output voltage of 188 V and an output current of 33.5 μA. It should be noted that the use of FEP film can increase the output voltage by 93 times compared with the device without the FEP film. Under a constant pressure, the device works as a normal battery. As shown in Fig. 5b, when switches S5 and S6 are open and switches S1–S4 are closed, the electric energy stored in the capacitor (C) can charge the LIB. The electrochemical reactions of the battery involved are as follows. LiMn2O4 → Li1−xMn2O4 + xLi+ + xe−(3) TiO2 + xLi+ + xe− → LixTiO2(4)

As shown in Fig. 5c, the charge and discharge capacities of the battery increase significantly with increasing applied pressure, reaching maximum values of 14.3 and 13.2 μA h, respectively. The charging and discharging performance of the battery was also evaluated under the pressure equivalent to the human body, simulating the application of the device in wearable electronic products. As shown in Fig. 5d, a stable charge–discharge cycle can be observed. Furthermore, the device can be installed on shoes to continuously power green LEDs. This work shows that this self-rechargeable LIB can use excess body motion energy to power various wearable electronic products such as sports bracelets, smart watches, LEDs, and pacemakers.
Sodium (Na)-ion batteries work through the movement of Na ions between the cathode and cathode, which is similar to the working principle of LIBs. During charging, Na ions are deintercalated from the cathode, transported through the electrolyte, and inserted into the anode, while the reverse process occurs during discharging.35–38 The mass and size of Na+ are larger than Li+, which usually results in lower capacity and charge–discharge efficiency of Na-ion batteries than LIBs. However, Na-ion batteries have the following advantages: (1) sodium is abundant and cheap; (2) Na dose not form an alloy with Al, so the anode can use Al foil as a current collector, which can further reduce the cost and the weight of the battery; (3) Na-ion batteries have no over-discharge issues, so they can be discharged to zero volt without damaging the battery. Therefore, Na-ion batteries are expected to replace traditional lead-acid batteries in large-scale energy storage.39–42
Zhou et al. developed a flexible self-rechargeable Na-ion battery by introducing an elastic piezoelectric film (piezo-film) (Fig. 6a).43 The device consists of four components: a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)@C cathode, a perforated elastic potassium sodium niobate (KNN)@styrene–ethylene–butylene–styrene (SEBS) piezo-film, a glass fiber membrane, and a Ni2P@PNC anode. As shown in Fig. 6b, the charging voltage of the battery increases with increasing force. The working mechanism is schematically presented in Fig. 6c. When a compressive force is applied to the cathode current collector (Al foil), the piezoelectric layer is polarized to generate an electric field. Then Na ions migrate to the anode under the action of the generated internal electric field to realize the charging process of the battery. When the force is removed, Na ions diffuse back to the cathode, realizing the discharge process of the battery. In this way, the battery can be charged and discharged repeatedly by applying and removing a compressive force. The charging and discharging process of the battery involves the following electrochemical reactions. Na3V2(PO4)3 → NaV2(PO4)3 + 2Na+ + 2e−(5) Ni2P + 3Na+ + 3e− → Na3P + 2Ni, Na3P → P + 3Na+ + 3e−(6)

In addition to applying pressure, the self-charging process can also be achieved by bending and vibrating the device.
Furthermore, Zhou et al. reported the fabrication of a flexible self-rechargeable Na-ion battery by placing a BaTiO3–P(VDF–HFP)–NaClO4 piezoelectric gel-electrolyte film onto a Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode and using a hard carbon anode as shown in Fig. 6d.44 This Na-ion battery can collect and store the mechanical energy generated by human body movement. Therefore, it can be used as a power supply for self-powered wearable electronic devices (Fig. 6e). The key component of this self-rechargeable battery is the flexible piezoelectric gel electrolyte, which integrates the functions of separator, electrolyte and piezoelectric medium. The preparation of the piezoelectric gel electrolyte is shown in Fig. 6f, in which the step to polarize the BaTiO3–P(VDF–HFP) film under an electric field of 3.5 kV mm−1 is critical for the successful preparation of the battery. The electrochemical reactions involved in the battery are as follows. Na3V2(PO4)3 → NaV2(PO4)3 + 2Na+ + 2e−(7) xC + 2Na+ + 2e− → Na2Cx(8)
Zhao et al. reported a triboelectrification-enabled flexible self-rechargeable LIB system that can scavenge the ambient wind energy.27 As shown in Fig. 7a, the device consists of two LMO-based LIBs with an energy scavenging unit in the middle, a transformer, a rectifier, and four switches. The transformer and the rectifier are used to obtain a DC output, and the switches control the connection between the rectifier and the two batteries. The energy scavenging unit has a multilayer structure, Cu(1)/PE/Al/PA/FEP/PA/Al/PE/Cu(2), where Cu(1) and Cu(2) are the anode current collectors of the top and bottom LIBs, respectively, PE is polyethylene (a dielectric) and PA is polyamide (a dielectric). The FEP film can vibrate between the two PA layers, creating the same number of negative and positive triboelectric charges on the surfaces of FEP and PA films, respectively, due to their different triboelectric polarities.

(b) Schematic diagram of self-rechargeable process of the LIB system without output, showing the flow of electrons in the circuit. (c and d) Self-charging and discharging curves of the top LIB, in which the enlarged curve is shown in (d) under a discharge current of 0.1 mA. (e) Measured charge/discharge voltage–time curves of a new LIB in 50 cycles without wind through the device in the first 20 cycles. (f) Charge/discharge capacities and Coulombic efficiencies of a new LIB in 50 cycles without wind through the device in the first 20 cycles. All panels reproduced with permission.27 Copyright 2017, Wiley-VCH. 
When the FEP film is connected to the top LIB-1 and switches S1 and S2 are kept closed, no output current signal was observed, as shown in Fig. 7a. When the FEP film approaches the bottom LIB-2, electrons flow from the bottom Cu electrode to the top Cu electrode (Fig. 7b). A rectified voltage is established between the two electrodes of the top battery through a transformer and a rectifier, which causes electrons to flow from the cathode to the anode, completing the charging of the top battery. The electrochemical reactions involved at the cathode and anode are as follows. LiMn2O4 ↔ Li1−xMn2O4 + xLi+ + xe−(9) 6C + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixC6(10)

Fig. 7c shows the charge–discharge cycling performance of the top LIB driven by the vibration of the FEP film caused by blowing air through the device at a speed of 10 m s−1, while switches S1 and S2 are kept closed. The top LIB can be charged from 1.5 V to 3.5 V in 3 min (Fig. 7d). Fig. 7e and f show the charging and discharging performance of the LIB in 50 consecutive cycles, first without wind (electrical charging) for 20 cycles, and then with wind (triboelectric charging) for 30 cycles. The LIB showed no obvious differences in the charging voltage and capacity with and without the vibration of the FEP film, indicating the efficient and stable electrochemical performance of the battery charged by blowing vibration. This study proves the feasibility of using self-rechargeable LIBs powered by wind energy to continuously drive mobile electronic devices and self-powered sensor systems.

Table 1 summarizes the composition, energy source, performance and potential applications of some representative mechanical energy-charged self-rechargeable batteries. It can be found that the electrical energy produced by mechanically charged self-rechargeable batteries mainly comes from the piezoelectric effect. This kind of mechanical energy can be produced by human motion, such as walking, vibration, bending, etc. Therefore, this self-rechargeable battery can be conveniently applied to wearable electronic devices.

2.2 Self-rechargeable batteries powered by light
Natural light and artificial light are ubiquitous and can be collected and converted into electrical energy by photovoltaic devices or solar cells. The self-rechargeable battery realized by the solar cell is very convenient to use. Compared to silicon-based solar cells, organic material-based solar cells, including dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC),45 perovskite solar cell (PSC),46 and organic solar cell (OSC),47 are potentially low cost, flexible, and lightweight, and have been extensive studied in the recent decades. They are also ideal for self-rechargeable batteries. Their typical structures are shown in Fig. 8. A DSSC is a photoelectrochemical device that consists of a photosensitive organic dye-coated nanostructured photoelectrode, an electrolyte, and a counter-electrode. A PSC has a photoactive layer made of a hybrid organic–inorganic semiconductor with a perovskite crystal structure. The photoactive layer of an OSC is typically a mixture of a polymer semiconductor donor and a small molecule semiconductor acceptor that form a bi-continuous nanophase-separated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure.

The first self-rechargeable photo-battery reported by Orelc et al. is based on a DSSC with an additional WO3 layer in the photocathode.15 The battery is composed of FTO/WO3(5 μm)/TiO2(25 μm)/LiI:I2/Pt/FTO, where FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) is a transparent conductor layer, the mesoporous TiO2 layer is sensitized by the cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N3) dye, LiI:I2 is a common electrolyte used in DSSCs, which contains 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 in propylene carbonate with 10 vol% of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and Pt/FTO is Pt-stained FTO conductive glass substrate. Upon illumination under simulated sunlight (1 sun, 1000 W m−2), the Voc reaches 0.5 V after 1 min and 0.6 V after 4 min. The battery is discharged after illumination for different amounts of time. It was found that a maximum amount of charge of 0.45C cm−2 was stored after 30 min illumination. By increasing the WO3 layer thickness from 5 μm to 50 μm, an amount of charge of 1.8C cm−2 was stored. It was considered that the WO3 layer functions as an anode to receive the photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 layer and Li+ ions in the electrolyte, forming LiWO3. I− ions in the electrolyte receive the photogenerated holes from the dye molecules, forming I3− species. So, the battery is charged. When the battery is discharged, I3− is reduced to I− and LiWO3 is oxidized to WO3 and releases Li+. Although the battery involves in the Li+ insertion, transport, and release, its energy storage mechanism is very different from the conventional LIBs.
Guo et al. developed a self-rechargeable power pack by integrating a DSSC and a LIB.48 The power pack has a structure of FTO/Pt/LiI:I2/TNTs/Ti/TNTs/LiPF6/LCO/Al. TNTs/Ti/TNTs is a double-sided TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs) grown on a Ti foil (Fig. 9a). The upper part, FTO/Pt/LiI:I2/TNTs/Ti, is a DSSC device, where the dye-sensitized TNTs are the photocathode to collect electrons, the Pt-stained FTO (FTO/Pt) is the anode to collect holes, and LiI:I2 is a liquid electrolyte containing LiI and I2. The bottom part, Ti/TNTs/LiPF6/LCO/Al, is a LIB, where the TNTs is the anode, LiPF6 is the liquid electrolyte, LCO (LiCoO2) is the cathode, and Al foil is the current collector. N719 or N749 dye (Fig. 9b) was used to sensitize the TNTs in the DSSC. When sunlight irradiates on the DSSC, the holes generated by the dye molecules are collected at the FTO/Pt electrode. The electrons generated by the dye molecules are collected by the TNTs and transported through the Ti foil to the TNTs anode of LIB, where TiO2 is reduced to LixTiO2. On the other hand, the LiCO2 cathode is oxidized to Li1−xCO2. So, the LIB is photo-charged. When the anode of the DSSC and the cathode of the LIB are connected to an external circuit, the battery is discharged.

An integrated power pack was made by connecting one DSSC sensitized with N719 dye and two DSSCs sensitized with N749 dye in order to obtain an enough charging voltage for the LIB part. Using N719 (400–550 nm) and N749 (600–800 nm) dyes with complementary absorption ranges can collect sunlight more efficiently. When the DSSCs in the integrated power pack are exposed to simulated sunlight, the voltage of the power pack is increased from 0.550 V to 2.996 V in 400 s. When the power pack was discharged to 0.750 V at 100 μA, a discharge capacity of 33.89 μA h was achieved. The total energy conversion and storage efficiency of the device is 0.82%. A commercial red LED was successfully powered by this power pack.
Paolella et al. reported a two-electrode self-rechargeable photo battery by combining a DSSC and a LIB.49 Compared with the in-series50,51 or three-electrode design,48 this two-electrode photo battery is much simpler. A photocathode was fabricated by depositing LFP NPs on a transparent conductive FTO glass substrate and sensitized by N719 dye. The device was assembled by using the FTO/LFP NPs/N719 photocathode, an electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC (3/7) + 2% VC, and a Li metal anode, where EC, DEC, and VC are ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and vinylene carbonate, respectively. Upon illumination with a solar simulator in a dry room, the battery was fully charged from an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 3.43 V to 3.62 V in ∼30 h. After discharging at C/24, a capacity of 104 mA h g−1 was achieved. The battery was then fully recharged by light for a total of 200 h. The second discharge achieved a comparable capacity of 99.3 mA h g−1. The longer time taken for the second charge might be due to the dissolution of the dye molecules in the electrolyte. To improve the stability of the photocathode, an ITO-coated PET substrate (PET/ITO) was used to replace FTO glass, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used to improve the conductivity and PVDF was used as a binder to improve film integrity. The battery using the PET/ITO/LFP:CNT:PVDF photocathode showed a faster photo-assisted charging process, and the battery was fully charged in less than 24h. Interestingly, the discharge capacity of the fully charged battery is at least twice the theoretical value of LFP (∼2 × 170 mA h g−1). It was found that the carbonate electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC + 2% VC) used is essential for realizing photocharging, because several other electrolytes showed slow or no photocharging. The presence of oxygen is also required because no photocharging occurs during the experiment in a glove box filled with argon. Based on the energy levels of N719, LiFePO4, FePO4, and Li as well as the analytical data (XRD, XPS, NMR, etc.) of the cathode and electrolyte compositions before and after photocharging, the authors proposed the working photocharging mechanism of this photo battery shown in Fig. 9c and d. The N719 dye molecules in the photocathode absorb photons to generate free holes and electrons in the HOMO and LUMO, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9c, the holes are injected to the HOMO (−5.2 eV) of LiFePO4, leading to delithiation and conversion of LiFePO4 to FePO4. On the other hand, the photo-generated electrons are unable to reduce Li+ ions into Li metal due to the insufficient OCV. Instead, the photo-generated electrons promote the photo-oxidation of the electrolyte in the presence of oxygen gas, forming an insoluble Li carbonate solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the of Li metal surface (Fig. 9d). The photo-generated electrons seem to be chemically stored in the SEI, which are released in the subsequent discharge when the SEI crystals decompose. This accounts for the high discharge capacity exceeding the theoretical value of LFP. Obviously, the Li metal electrode is consumed during the discharge process and cannot be recovered during the photocharging process, so strictly speaking, this kind of photo battery is not rechargeable. By using an anode material that has a lower operating voltage (∼0.7–1 V), a fully rechargeable photo battery may be realized.
Xu et al. demonstrated the use of PSC packs to enable photo-charging of a LIB.50Fig. 9e schematically shows the structure of the solar cell device and the working mechanism of the self-rechargeable battery. The self-rechargeable battery system consists of four CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs and a LIB with a LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode. The four PSCs in series achieved a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 4.82mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 3.84V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.68 and a PCE of 12.65%. The photovoltage is sufficient for photo-charging the LIB. When switch S1 is closed and switch S2 is opened, the LIB is charged through the solar cells under the illumination of a solar simulator. When switch S1 is opened and switch S2 is closed, the LIB is discharged through the external load. As shown in Fig. 9f, the discharge–charge curves are almost identical for the PSCs charged LIB and the power supply charged LIB. The blue and black lines represent that the battery is charged at 0.5C using PSC and galvanostatically discharged at 0.5C using power supply during the 1st–10th cycles, and red and black lines represent that the battery is both galvanostatically charged and discharged at 0.5C using power supply during the 11th–15th cycles. After 10 photo-charge and galvanostatic discharge cycles, the PSCs showed a slight decrease in PCE from 12.65% to 11.16% (Fig. 9g), while the specific capacity of LIB decreased from 140.4mA h g−1 to 111.6mA h g−1. As shown in Fig. 9h, the overall energy storage efficiency for the PSC-charged LIB is ∼60%, which is comparable to the energy storage efficiency of the power supply-charged LIB (∼66%). The results show that PSC-LIB-based self-rechargeable batteries have the potential to power various portable electronic products and even electric vehicles. Kim et al. fabricated a similar self-rechargeable LFP–LTO based LIB powered by four PSCs.52 They found that a PSC achieved a PCE of up to 12.95% when working alone. Four PSCs in the integrated circuit achieved a PCE of 12.28% and 12.00% during the 1st and 10th cycles of photo-charging and glavanostatic discharging, respectively, indicating that the cells are quite stable. This PSC-LIB device achieved a higher energy storage efficiency of 74.3% than the previous study (∼60%).50 The efficiency for the entire process including energy conversion and storage is 9.25%.
Ahmad et al. reported a PSC-based photo battery, which can simultaneously achieve energy collection, conversion and recharging by light.17 As shown in Fig. 10a, the battery has a structure of FTO/rGO/perovskite/separator/Li/ss/Al/glass, where the perovskite is an organic–inorganic hybrid compound (C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (CHPI), rGO is reduced graphene oxide blended in PVDF, separator is a Whatman borosilicate glass filter paper soaked with 1 M LiPF6 as electrolyte, and ss is a stainless steel disk. Unlike the PSC-LIB devices discussed above,50,52 the PSC and LIB in this study are stacked together on the same substrate. The photo battery was charged to 2.95 V by a white light source (420–650 nm; 100 mW cm−2) and then discharged to 2.0 V through an external load in dark for more than 10 cycles (Fig. 10b). No obvious drop in the photocharging potential was observed. The fresh battery can achieve a capacity of 100 mA h g−1. However, the capacity decreased rapidly over time. This may be due to the decomposition of CHPI during battery discharge. This type of photo battery shows the possibility of developing very compact self-powered electronic devices.

Hanzu et al. integrated a nonfullerene acceptor-based tandem OSC with an Na-ion battery.53 This hybrid energy device can be self-charged by solar energy, which is specially developed for isolated sensor systems. The tandem OSC consisting of glass/ITO (130–140 nm)/ZnO (30–40 nm)/PTB7-Th:O-IDTBR (70 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Al (3 nm)/PFN-Br (<5 nm)/PTB7-Th:O-IDTBR (120 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was fabricated to provide a high photovoltaic voltage for charging the Na-ion battery, as shown in Fig. 10c. The cell achieved a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.92 V and a power conversion efficiency of 6.79% in average (Fig. 10d). Carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP-C) and NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP-C) were used as the cathode and anode, respectively, to construct the Na-ion battery, which has a structure: Cu/NTP-C/NaFSI in EC:DEC 4:6/NVP-C/Al. The battery showed voltage plateaus at ∼1.2 V in discharge and ∼1.3 V in charge as shown in Fig. 10e. A photo-rechargeable Na-ion battery pack was fabricated by integrating the tandem OSC with the Na-ion battery.
Upon illumination of the OSC, the photogenerated electrons and holes are transported to the negative and positive electrodes of the solar cell, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10f. The overvoltage drives the electrons from the OSC to the negative electrode of the Na-ion battery through an external circuit, and at the same time, Na ions diffuse to the negative electrode through the electrolyte. The battery is thus charged. In the dark, Na ions in the charged battery diffuse to the positive electrode through the electrolyte, while electrons move to the positive electrode through the external circuit and generate more Na ions, thus the battery is discharged. After photocharging for about one hour, a specific capacity of 65 μA h cm−2 was reached, which is about one-half of the value (150 μA h cm−2) achieved by a nominal test battery (by normal electrical charging). The overall efficiency of the self-rechargeable Na-ion battery was evaluated by considering the PCE of the OSC, the efficiency during the battery charging process, and the efficiency during the discharge of the battery. The typical overall efficiency of this self-rechargeable Na-ion battery is between 0.4% and 0.6%. Fast degradation of the OSC was observed, which is common for OSCs. To make this technology practical, more stable OSCs are needed.
Volder's group proposed a photorechargeable LIB using a photocathode made of carbon fiber (CF)/rGO/poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)/V2O5 nanofibers and a Li metal anode, as shown in Fig. 11a and b.54 The first part of the device is equivalent to an organic solar cell (OSC) with P3HT as the photoactive layer, but it differs from the common OSCs where a mixture of donor and acceptor is used as the active layer (Fig. 8c). Fig. 11c and d show that the color of the photocathode changes as a function of the state of charge. The ex situ UV-vis absorption spectra of the photocathode in Fig. 11e indicate that the band gap increases when Li ions are inserted into V2O5, and decreases when Li ions are extracted from V2O5, which accounts for the color change with the state of charge. The photo battery reached a voltage of 2.82 V and a light conversion efficiency of 2.6% under the illumination of a light source with a wavelength of ∼455 nm and an intensity of ∼12 mW cm−2 for 5 h. Under one sun illumination, a light conversion efficiency of 0.22% was achieved.

Table 2 shows the composition, energy source, performance and potential applications of the representative light-charged self-rechargeable batteries discussed. From the perspective of energy source, the light-charged self-rechargeable battery is more suitable for outdoor applications with sufficient light, such as motor vehicles, hats, clothes, roofs, etc. In particular, light energy is sustainable, clean, and pollution-free, and fully meets the development requirements of green electronics.

2.3 Self-rechargeable batteries powered by oxygen in the air
Secondary aqueous Zn-ion/Zn–air batteries have broad application prospects in energy storage due to their advantages of high safety, easy assembly, high capacity, low cost, environmental friendliness, rich zinc resources, etc.55–58 Zn-ion batteries use Zn ions as the carriers, that is, energy storage/release is realized through the dissolution/deposition of Zn ions at the Zn anode and the electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of Zn ions at the cathode. Compared with traditional alkaline Zn-ion batteries, new Zn-ion batteries using neutral or weakly acidic electrolytes show superior charge and discharge properties and long-life cycle capability.59–61
Recently, a variety of vanadium (V)-based compounds have been reported as cathode materials for aqueous Zn-ion batteries.62–65 The discharged V-based cathode can be readily oxidized by oxygen in the surrounding environment, so that a self-rechargeable Zn-ion battery with both functions of energy conversion and storage can be realized. Zhi et al. demonstrated a 4.7-inch mobile phone size (6.7 cm × 13.81 cm) Zn–V battery (Fig. 12a), which can be fully charged by air.66 The battery has a structure of Pt–C-CFC/PANa/Zn/PAM/V2O5·xH2O-CFC, where Pt–C-CFC is Pt/C-modified carbon fiber cloth (CFC) air electrode, PANa is a sodium polyacrylate hydrogel electrolyte containing 0.2 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 6 M KOH, Zn is a zinc foil electrode, PAM is a polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte containing 2 M ZnSO4, and V2O5·xH2O-CFC is a V2O5·xH2O-modified CFC cathode. The Pt–C-CFC and V2O5·xH2O-CFC electrodes are connected, forming a “U”-shaped electrode. The Pt–C-CFC air electrode has a gas diffusion window. When the gas diffusion window is closed, the battery works as a normal Zn–V2O5 battery, undergoing the following redox reaction: yZn + V2O5·xH2O → ZnyV2O5·xH2O.67 The battery achieved a capacity of ∼1000 mA h at a current of 100 mA, as shown in Fig. 12b. The discharged battery can be easily recharged by oxygen in the air when the gas diffusion window is opened to the atmosphere. In this case, a reduction reaction of O2 + 4e → 4OH− occurs at the air electrode, while an oxidation reaction of Zn + 4OH− → Zn(OH)42− + 2e occurs at the Zn electrode, generating a voltage between the two electrodes. Since the Pt–C-CFC air electrode is connected to the V2O5·xH2O-CFC cathode, this potential difference generated can convert (oxidize) the discharged product, ZnyV2O5·xH2O, of the latter electrode back to V2O5·xH2O to charge the battery. The air-charged battery can reach a discharge capacity of ∼1000 mA h at 100 mA within one hour (Fig. 12c and d). This battery is very promising for portable electronics and wearable applications. It should be mentioned that the Zn metal electrode is consumed during both the discharging and air-charging processes. To recover the Zn metal, an external power supply is needed to charge the battery on two sides through reactions of (1) Zn(OH)42− + 2e → Zn + 4OH− on the PANa side and (2) Zn2+ + 2e → Zn on the PAM side. Therefore, the battery is not actually a self-rechargeable battery.

Zhang et al. developed a self-rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion battery with a CaV6O16·3H2O (CaVO) cathode.28 CaVO has a layered structure, in which V6O16 forms the framework, and hydrated calcium atoms form pillars, which play a role in fixing the layered structure (Fig. 13a). The crystal structure of CaVO is conducive to the insertion and extraction of Zn ions. After the first discharge, CaVO is converted to CaZn3.6VO by receiving 7.2 electrons from Zn. The discharge product CaZn3.6VO can be spontaneously oxidized by O2 dissolved in the electrolyte to form CaZn3.6−xVO (Fig. 13c and d). With the oxidation product CaZn3.6−xVO electrode as the cathode and Zn as the anode, the battery can discharge through an external load due to the significant chemical potential difference between CaZn3.6−xVO and Zn (Fig. 13b). The chemical reactions involved are as follows. CaZn3.6V6O16·3H2O → CaZn3.6−xV6O16·3H2O + xZn2+ + 2xe−(11) x/2O2 + 2xH+ + 2xe− → xH2O(12)

As shown in the above redox reaction, the water in the electrolyte is indispensable for the self-recharging process of the battery. An “open” coin-type Zn-ion battery was designed and fabricated, where the CaVO cathode cap was pre-perforated as a gas diffusion window to permit air diffuse into the aqueous electrolyte. With the gas diffusion window closed, the fresh battery discharges to form CaZn3.6VO at the cathode. Then the gas diffusion window is opened, and air enters the battery to realize the charging process. A liquid crystal display (LCD) was successfully self-powered by this battery (Fig. 13e).
Liao et al. developed a flexible aqueous Zn-ion fiber battery, which can also be self-charged by harvesting the energy of oxygen in the ambient air (Fig. 14a).68 The V6O13/aligned CNT cathode fiber (VCF) (Fig. 14b) can spontaneously form the discharged product Zn3.49V6O13, which can be recharged by O2 dissolved in the aqueous Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte to ∼60% of its full capacity. The fiber battery showed a high specific capacity of 371 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and good cycling stability with 91% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The redox reactions of the battery are as follows. V6O13 + 3.49Zn2+ + 6.98e− ↔ Zn3.49V6O13(13) 3.49Zn ↔ 3.49Zn2+ + 6.98e−(14) Z3.49V6O13 + x/2O2 + xH2O + (CF3SO3)2 → Zn3.49−xV6O13 + Znx+(CF3SO3)2y(OH)2x(15)

A VCF/Zn self-rechargeable fiber battery was integrated with a strain sensor. The integrated device can be worn on a fingertip (Fig. 14c). The sensor showed rapid response to repeated bending and stretching of the finger, proving the potential of this self-rechargeable Zn-ion fiber battery to power wearable electronic devices (Fig. 14d).
An electrochromic (EC) device contains two electrodes, at least one of which is transparent, and an electrolyte in between (Fig. 15). The reduction/oxidation state of the redox active electrode material can be adjusted by changing the voltage between the two electrodes. This leads to changes in the light absorption characteristics of this active material, which leads to changes in the color of the EC device. EC devices have many applications, including smart sunglasses, switchable windows, auto-dimming mirrors, and electrochromic displays.69 Converting an EC device into a self-rechargeable battery can potentially achieve self-powered EC products maintained by the ambient light.
 Fig. 15  Structures of transmission and reflection electrochromic devices. 
Zhang et al. designed and fabricated a self-powered electrochromic fluorescence display using a fast self-rechargeable battery through the redox reaction of Fe ions and Mg ions.70 The self-rechargeable battery is based on a very simple structure comprising a pair of Prussian Blue (PB)/Mg electrodes merged in an electrolyte containing 1 M KCl and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6), as shown in Fig. 16a. When two electrodes are connected to an external load, the battery discharged and PB (blue color) is reduced to Prussian White (PW) (transparent). When the two electrodes are disconnected, PW is oxidized by oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte to form PB, and the battery is self-recharged. However, it took 42.8 h to reach 82.7% of PB in the electrode. To accelerate the oxidation (charging) process, 0.025 M NaClO was introduced in the electrolyte. To reach 82.7% of PB, it took only 5.35 min. Therefore, both self-charging and coloration are significantly accelerated in the presence of NaClO. To make the electrochromic fluorescence device, a PB/Ru@SiO2/Nafion film is used to replace PB, where Ru@SiO2 is fluorescent [Ru(bpy)3]2+-doped silica nanoparticles. When the two electrodes are connected, Ru@SiO2 emit light at 649 nm (orange color), which can be absorbed by PB. Therefore, the color of the device can be adjusted by the PB/PW ratio in the electrode. The battery reached a current density of 7.85 mA cm−2 and a power density of 13.34 mW cm−2 at 1.70 V (Fig. 16b). After five cycles, the battery can still maintain 79% of the original power density (Fig. 16c).

Wang's group used p-toluenesulfonate doped polypyrrole (PPy) film electrodeposited on an ITO substrate as the cathode, Al sheet as the anode, and KCl solution as the electrolyte to fabricate a simple bi-functional electrochromic device, which exhibited self-rechargeable characteristics (Fig. 16d).71 The color of the as-prepared PPy/Al device in the charged state is black. When discharging by connecting the ITO and Al electrodes, the color of the device becomes transparent yellow. Once the two electrodes are disconnected, the color of the device is immediately recovered to black, indicating that the device is self-rechargeable. The self-charging mechanism of the PPy/Al device is illustrated in Fig. 16e. During discharge, the Al anode releases Al3+ ions through oxidation reaction. The p-doped PPy cathode is transformed into neutral PPy through reduction by receiving electrons through the external circuit and K+ ions in the electrolyte. When the neutral PPy film in the discharged battery reacts with the absorbed oxygen from surrounding, it changes to the oxidation state, thereby self-charging the battery.
Two PPy/Al devices were connected in series to supply a voltage of 1.88 V to turn on a red LED, as shown in Fig. 16f and g. The initial capacity of the PPy/Al device can reach 75.25 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in a potential range of 0–1.70 V. The device also showed good stability with 92% capacity retention after 50 cycles. The PPy/Al device may be used in self-powered electrochromic windows and other self-powered electronics.
Zhai et al. prepared a rechargeable “perpetual” battery composed of Fe/PB and PW/Pt couples and is used as color-tunable (nonemissive-red-yellow-green) self-driven electrochromic energy storage windows (EESWs) (Fig. 17a–c).72 The left compartment using Fe and PB as the electrodes is the discharge battery, and the right compartment using PW and Pt as the electrodes is the rechargeable battery. When PB (cathode) is connected with Fe (anode), PB is reduced to PW by receiving electrons from Fe via the external circuit (off state). When the formed PW (anode) and Pt (cathode) are connected, electrons flow from PW to Pt, and a catalytic reduction reaction of oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte occurs. At the same time, PW is converted to PB to realize self-charging. The chemical reactions in the charging process are as follows. Cathode: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O(16) Anode: K2Fe2+[Fe2+(CN)6](PW) – e− = KFe3+[Fe2+(CN)6](PB) + K+(17)

CdSe quantum dots (QDs) of different sizes are deposited on the PB electrode as fluorescent components to obtain red, yellow, and green fluorescence. PB is used as a color controller to adjust the fluorescence color of the device, because PB absorbs visible light above 500 nm. Fig. 17d exhibits the reversible fluorescence cycling of the self-rechargeable batteries with red, yellow, and green colors. Colors of the arrays with CdS QDs of different sizes during discharging/recharging under UV light are shown in Fig. 17e. It can be seen that the device shows no fluorescence (quenched) when PB is connected to Pt, while the device shows distinct red, yellow, and green fluorescence (not quenched) when PB is connected to the Fe electrode. This type of self-powered electrochromic device can be used for self-sustainable displays, windows, or variable-reflectance surfaces.
The composition, charging method, performance and demonstrated applications of some representative O2-charged self-rechargeable batteries discussed are summarized in Table 3. Since the O2-charged self-rechargeable battery requires the participation of oxygen during its operation, this battery needs an opening during the preparation process so that air can enter the battery and carry out the redox reaction. Therefore, an additional device is needed to open and close the window, which may become a challenge for some applications. It should be pointed out that the fabrication of these O2-charged self-rechargeable batteries is very simple, and the materials used are also very cheap, so they are one of the most promising rechargeable batteries for practical applications.

2.4 Self-rechargeable batteries powered by two energy sources
The self-rechargeable batteries discussed above use one ubiquitous energy source: mechanical energy, light, or air. However, the intermittent supply and slow charging of some of these energy sources may limit the application of self-rechargeable batteries powered by a single energy source. Therefore, research has recently been carried out to integrate two power conversion units capable of collecting two types of energy in a self-recharging battery in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues. Song's group designed and fabricated a flexible self-rechargeable battery that can harvest and store both light energy and mechanical energy.73 Three kinds of flexible devices, amorphous silicon (α-Si) solar cells, TENGs and LIBs, were integrated into a multilayer structure (Fig. 18a). The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-current (Isc), and transferred charges (Qsc) of a pair of TENG units with an area of 2.0 cm × 2.0 cm at different motion frequencies (0.5–4.0 Hz) are quite stable. The structure of the solar cell is showed in Fig. 18b. The integrated device can be attached to clothes (Fig. 18c). The equivalent circuit of the hybridized energy harvesting system is shown in Fig. 18d. When switch K1 is closed and switch K2 is opened, the LIB is charged by TENG. Conversely, this battery is charged by solar cells. Under the light with a power density of 25 mW cm−2, the solar cell can charge the LIB to 3.65 V within 6.5 s, and then TENG can continue to charge the battery from 3.65 V to 3.86 V. The discharge can last for 4.5 h at 0.4 mA. The design of the device uses less material for the electrodes, substrates and packaging to achieve two self-recharging modes.

Thakur et al. developed a self-rechargeable photo-powered battery using a piezoelectric and dielectric ZnO–PVDF film and a light-absorbing Eosin Y (EY)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film.74 The configuration and fabrication of this battery are illustrated schematically in Fig. 19a. The photoelectron generation and storage in the device are shown in Fig. 19b. When light penetrates the transparent FTO electrode and is absorbed by EY in the EY/PVA film, the excited electrons in the EY molecules flow to the Al electrode through the external circuit, while the FTO electrode collects holes. Therefore, a potential is established between the two electrodes, realizing the charging process of the battery. The photo battery showed Voc of 0.76 V, Jsc of 7.3 mA cm−2, FF of 0.518, and PCE of 2.61% under illumination with a tungsten light bulb of 110 mW cm−2. An energy density of 0.17 W h m−2 and a power density of 3.04 W m−2 were achieved. The battery can be fully charged to 0.76 V under illumination in 120 s. Then the battery was discharged at 0.4 mA cm−2 for 330 s. After the battery was charged and discharged 1 cycle per day for 56 days, the photovoltage only dropped by 2.6%, indicating good cycle stability of the battery. A commercial blue LED was successfully turned on using this self-rechargeable photo battery.

Xie et al. successfully fabricated an “all-in-one” fast self-rechargeable Zn–polymer battery, which can be charged by air and light (Fig. 19c).75 The key component of the battery is a cathode composed of a 3D integrated polyaniline nanorod array arranged on a carbon cloth (PANINA/CC) (Fig. 19d). This cathode has reversible redox capability, oxygen reduction activity and photothermal responsiveness, and can collect, convert, and store energy from air and light.
The battery can be charged by air to a capacity of 164.2 mA h g−1 in 120 min at 1 A g−1. In the presence of both air and light, a high capacity of 363.1 mA h g−1 is reached in only 20 min, which is very close to the capacity of 379.4 mA h g−1 achieved by normal electrical charging in 22 min. More importantly, the battery can maintain good operation during multiple self-charge/discharge cycles, indicating its excellent self-sustainability. Based on the ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the self-charging mechanism of the cathode in the presence of air and light was proposed (Fig. 19e). Self-charging is achieved by oxidizing the discharged PANINA in the presence of air and light, in a manner similar to that of a rechargeable Zn–PANI battery.77 After complete discharge, the reduction state of PANINA, –NH–, is dominant (87.3%), while the sum of the three oxidation states, –N, –NH+–, and –NH+, is 12.7%. Direct air-oxidation in the absence of light reduces the –NH– content to 66.1%, and increases the total content of oxidation states to 33.9%. Air-oxidation in the presence of light results in a further decrease of the –NH– content to 62.7% and an increase of the total content of the oxidation states to 37.3%. On the other hand, the battery fully charged by an external power supply (0.20–1.70 V vs. Zn) contains 62.2% of –NH– and 37.8% of oxidization states. The results show that the performance of the battery when self-charging with air and light is similar compared to charging with an electrical power source.
Chang et al. developed an EC battery composed of W18O49/polyaniline (PANI) hybrid film as the cathode, Al foil as the anode, and AlCl3 as the electrolyte, which integrates electrochromism, electricity generation and electricity storage in a single device (Fig. 19f).76 The electrochromic and capacitive behaviors of the battery depend on the reversible redox reactions of the active materials, W18O49 and PANI. The as-prepared battery has a discharge capacity of 32.25 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 19g). The battery can be self-charged when exposed to the air, reaching a specific capacity of 22.96 and 39.76 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 12 h and 24 h, respectively. Under real sunlight and exposure to air, the battery can be charged to 27.50 and 36.78 mA h g−1 in just 3 and 4 h, respectively, which indicates that sunlight can significantly accelerate the oxidation of AlxW18O49 and PANI in the discharged cathode.
The structure and properties of the self-rechargeable batteries powered by two energy sources are summarized in Table 4. The structure of this type of batteries is more complicated and the matching and balance of the energy conversion units and the energy storage units are more challenging. However, in principle, a self-recharging battery powered by multiple power sources can be a more stable and reliable power supply, save more materials, and make the self-powered system more compact. These examples have demonstrated the feasibility of developing this type of attractive self-recharging batteries.

3. Conclusion and outlook
In summary, self-rechargeable batteries are an innovative energy storage technology used to drive personal electronic products and self-powered systems.78–81 They can have a wide range of applications in mobile/wearable electronics, remote environmental monitoring devices, implanted electronics, and wireless sensor networks. The development of self-rechargeable batteries has been largely driven by the urgent need to power organic electronics since they are most suitable for the above applications. This review has summarized recent progress made in the development of self-rechargeable batteries charged by ubiquitous, abundant, sustainable, and clean energy sources, which include mechanical force, wind, light, light/air, and ambient oxygen, without the use of electric power source. The mechanisms of electricity generation mainly include piezoelectric and triboelectric effects, oxidation, photovoltaic effect and combinations of some of them. Various types of self-rechargeable batteries and the corresponding mechanisms for generating electricity discussed in this review are shown in Fig. 20. It has become clear that organic electronic materials (piezoelectric, triboelectric, photovoltaic, organic redox-active small molecules, polymers, etc.) and organic electronics (organic piezoelectrics, organic triboelectrics, organic photovoltaics, organic batteries, etc.) have also played a key role in the development of self-rechargeable batteries. Although still in its infancy, self-rechargeable batteries have been successfully connected or integrated with flexible electronics and demonstrated their great potential to enable wearable/portable electronics, medical devices, IoT sensors, etc.
 Fig. 20  Various types of self-rechargeable batteries and the corresponding mechanisms for generating electricity. 
Although numerous successes have been achieved in the development of self-rechargeable batteries, most of the current materials and devices are still far from satisfactory for practical applications. The following issues and challenges are recognized, which are mainly related to electronic materials. In order to make self-rechargeable batteries a commercial reality, these problems need to be addressed.
(1) Self-rechargeable batteries powered by mechanical forces are realized by the piezoelectric or triboelectric effect. The number of available materials is very limited, especially for piezoelectric materials, of which almost only PDVF is used. Another issue is the high and constant mechanical stress applied on these materials, which would result in the degradation of the performance and even damage of the materials and devices. Materials with stronger piezoelectric or triboelectric effects and superior mechanical properties are needed to further increase the energy conversion efficiency and improve the durability of the devices.
(2) For self-rechargeable batteries powered by light energy, organic polymer photovoltaic materials are most suitable in terms of mechanical robustness, light weight, nontoxicity, and ease of device fabrication. However, the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells is still inferior to that of silicon solar cells although studies showed that organic solar cells are more efficient under weak light intensity. Organic solar cells are also not very stable. Nonetheless, rapid progress has been made in recent years in improving the efficiency and stability of organic solar cells, which will propel the development of light-powered self-rechargeable batteries.
(3) Self-rechargeable batteries powered by ambient air reply on redox materials that are prone to oxidation by oxygen in the air. Unlike the batteries self-powered by mechanical force or light, the redox materials in the air-powered batteries are exposed to the ambient air. Some components in the ambient air such as carbon dioxide, moisture, dusts, etc. may be detrimental to battery performance. In addition, some air-powered batteries need to open or close a window on the battery to control the airflow into the battery. If the battery uses a liquid electrolyte, evaporation of solvent over time is also a concern. Therefore, improved material performance and device design are needed for practical applications of these batteries.
(4) It should be mentioned that some self-rechargeable energy storage devices are not fully sustainable in terms of power supply or active materials used, and are not included in this review. For example, self-rechargeable capacitors become exhausted quickly once discharged and need immediate recharging.82 Some self-rechargeable batteries undergo irreversible reactions of the redox active materials (e.g., Na, Zn, NaClO, and Na2S2O8).51,70,83,84 Similarly, self-rechargeable fuel cells need to be refilled with fuel.85 Nevertheless, these “quasi” self-charging energy storage devices can still find applications in some self-powered electronic products, and they are worthy of further exploration.
