    , Accepted 23rd November 2011First published on 10th January 2012AbstractA platinum nanoparticle/multi-wall carbon nanotube (PtNP/MWCNT) hybrid counter electrode (CE) based on a flexible substrate, Ti foil, was prepared for a high performance dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) via a facile fabricating route. This flexible nanohybrid CE was established by using a requisite homemade dispersant, consisting of poly(oxyethylene) segment and imide linkage functionalities. MWCNTs were well suspended in an ethanol/water solution in the presence of copolymer dispersant and PtNPs. The solution containing the PtNP/MWCNT (2/1 weight ratio) hybrid was further coated into a thin film on the Ti foil by the doctor blade technique, followed by annealing at 390 °C to obtain the flexible PtNP/MWCNT hybrid CE. The solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of a DSSC with the flexible PtNP/MWCNT hybrid CE gave a higher value of 9.04% in comparison to that of the cell with a conventional Pt CE (η = 7.47%). A rougher surface morphology of the nanohybrid film precisely controlled by the configuration of MWCNT was obtained, with reference to that of a Pt-sputtered film. The PtNP/MWCNT hybrid film was physically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, incident-photon-to-current efficiency, and electrochemical impedance spectra were examined for confirming the high electro-catalytic ability of this flexible PtNP/MWCNT hybrid CE.
Introduction
The development of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), first reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, has continuously attracted great interest due to its reasonable light-to-electricity conversion efficiency and cost effective fabrication.1–3 In a DSSC, the redox reactions occur at the interfaces of dye/electrolyte/counter electrode. On the surface of counter electrode, reduction of triiodide (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) occurs while iodide is oxidized by dye organics.4,5 High electrochemical activity of the counter electrode (CE) is essential for good DSSC performance. Conventionally, platinum (Pt) is coated on a conductive substrate as the CE's catalytic surface to minimize the voltage loss due to charge transfer overpotentials.6,7Pt was selected for use in the CE because of its excellent catalytic activity for reducing triiodide, high electric conductivity and high thermal/chemical stability.7,8 However, the conventional method of depositing a Pt layer through metal sputtering has the disadvantages of non-transparency and high material cost. The economic feasibility of future DSSC development relies on using less expensive materials as a Pt replacement, such as carbon materials,9–14 conducting polymers,15,16graphene/conducting polymer,17 conducting polymer/TiO2,18carbon/TiO2,19 and conducting polymer/CNT composites.20 Among these newly developed substitutes, the use of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is particularly mentioned for the material conductivity, specific surface area, and high stability. By adding CNT to the PtCl4 CE, Lee et al. obtained a larger CE surface area than that of the original.21 They showed that the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC with a CNT-CE was higher compared to that of the standard one because the CNT-CE has larger contact surface areas than the PtCl4 CE without added CNT.21 Umeyama et al. and Ahmad et al. reported that MWCNT can be utilized as a fast electron-transport material in a Pt/MWCNT network because of the coexistence of ballistic and diffusive transport as well as its tubular morphology.22 By the use of CNT, Thostenson et al. observed that the electro-catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions was enhanced to a certain extent.23 Therefore, it is generally believed that CNT can be considered as a suitable electron-transport material in constructing a Pt hybrid CE for DSSCs.
Similarly, the new development of fabricating flexible DSSCs has attracted considerable attention due to the potential low cost of roll-to-roll production.24,25 Plastic film coated on metal foils or conducting substrates has been proposed for use as working electrodes and counter electrodes. Grätzel reported an electrodeposited Pt on the indium-doped tin oxide layered poly(ethylene naphthalate) (ITO–PEN) that had achieved a flexible DSSC with the conversion efficiency of 7.2%.26 The preparation of plastic Pt CE by chemical reduction of H2PtCl6 in solution was also revealed by Kang et al.25 and Park et al.27
Here we report a homogeneous dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (PtNP/MWCNT) and the subsequent formation of nanohybrid composite film on flexible Ti foil. The requisite polymeric dispersant is comprised of poly(oxyethylene) segments and imide functionalities. The role of the dispersant is first to homogeneously disperse and de-bundle MWCNTs in organic medium and subsequently the metallic Pt nanoparticles. The coating on the flexible substrate afforded the nanohybrid film, which exhibited a high efficiency in CE performance. The surface analyses have shown that the roughness control of the PtNP/MWCNT nanohybrids on surface is responsible for the DSSC performance. The weight composition of PtNP/MWCNT in polymer dispersed water/ethanol medium was optimized by forming the film on Ti foil substrate and examined for the DSSC performance.
Experimental
Materials

Poly(oxyethylene)diamine or poly(oxypropylene–oxyethylene–oxypropylene) segmented polyether of bis(2-aminopropyl ether) with 2000 MW (POE2000) was a crystalline water-soluble compound (waxy solid, melting point 37–40 °C, amine content 0.95 meq g−1) with a formula of 39 oxyethylene and 6 oxypropylene units. Monomer 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA, 97% purified by sublimation), Ti(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, >98%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%), acetylacetone (99.5%), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6, 99.95%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar Company. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) was purchased from Showa. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 95%) and ethyl alcohol (99.5%) were purchased from Teida Chemicals. Lithium iodide (LiI, chemical grade), iodine (I2, chemical grade), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 20000 MW) were obtained from Merck Chemical Co. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) and tert-butanol (96%) were obtained from Acros Chemicals. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) and 2-methoxyethanol (99.95%) were obtained from Riedel-de Haën, Fluka, J. T. Backer, and Sigma–Aldrich Company, respectively.
The TiO2 colloidal solution was prepared by a sol–gel method according to the following conditions. Titanium tetra-iso-propoxide (TTIP) (69.1 g, 0.24 mol) was added to 430 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution with continuous stirring and heating at 85 °C for 8 h. When the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, the resultant colloid was transferred to an autoclave (PARR 4540), and the temperature maintained at 240 °C for 12 h under the closed system. The prepared TiO2 colloid was concentrated to 10 wt% and analyzed by SEM to be uniformed particles ca. 20 nm in diameter. Large-sized TiO2 (PT–501A, 99.74% purity, 15 m2 g−1 surface area, 100 nm diameter) was purchased from Ya Chung Industrial Co. Ltd., Taiwan for the use of scattering particles in the TiO2 photoanode.
Preparation of poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM) dispersant
The POEM polymer was synthesized from the reaction of POE2000 and ODPA at a molar ratio of 6:5, by the procedures described as follows: POE2000 (10.00 g, 0.005 mol) in THF (15 mL) was poured into a 100 mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen inlet–outlet lines, and a thermometer; a solution of ODPA (1.29 g, 0.004 mol) in THF (10 mL) was added to the reactor through a funnel in a drop-wise manner. During the addition, the mixture was stirred vigorously and the reactor was maintained at 150 °C for 3 h. The product mixtures were subjected to rotary evaporation under reduced pressure and recovered as a yellowish waxy solid. During the process, samples were taken (Scheme 1). The thermal properties of POEM were examined by TGA analysis. The typical traces for POEM are shown in Fig. 1, indicating that the polymer starts to loss its thermal stability at 200 °C.

Preparation of PtNP/MWCNT nanohybrid
The composition of PtNPs with MWCNT was accomplished by an in situreduction of di-hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6) in the presence of MWCNTs using the dispersant POEM in an aqueous medium. The MWCNTs (0.036 g) were first dispersed in 7.11 g of deionized water in a vial and agitated under a VCX 500 ultrasonicator at ambient temperature for 15 min. The resulting solution became dark-black with some solid precipitate at the bottom of the container, indicating a low degree of dispersion. In a separate glass container, POEM (1.0 g) and various weights of H2PtCl6 (0.05, 0.25, 0.1 and 1.0 g) were dissolved in 5.14 g of ethyl alcohol and added to the MWCNT/deionized water (7.11 g) solution. A homogenous suspension of MWCNT was obtained by mixing in the presence of POEM and H2PtCl6. PtNPs were then generated by the reduction of H2PtCl6 by slowly adding NaBH4 (0.7 wt% in water). This dispersion was further stirred for several hours at ambient temperature and monitored using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), evidencing the attachment of PtNP on MWCNT surfaces. The dispersion of PtNP/MWCNT with and without POEM solution was measured using UV-visible spectroscopy (UVmini-1240 Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer).
Different degrees of dispersions of PtNP/MWCNT without and with incorporating POEM were observed by using a UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer over a period of 72 h (Fig. S1, in ESI†). Large amounts of the suspension of PtNP/MWCNT had aggregated and precipitated after one week; however, a good dispersion of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM in the solution was obtained (Fig. S1a†). On the other hand, the nanohybrid materials exhibited a stable dispersion at room temperature, even after several weeks. The π-conjugated aromatic surface of the MWCNTs and the hybrid materials POEM interact between each other via π-stacking interacting force, while the hydrophilic surfaces of the MWCNTs maintain the dispersion of the construct in the solution. These observations show that the incorporation of POEM can significantly improve the dispersion of PtNP/MWCNT in ethanol. Fig. S1b† shows that PtNP/MWCNT is indeed well dispersed in the solution in the presence of POEM at a weight ratio of 2/1/20. The stability of the dispersion of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM in the ethanol was monitored by its optical absorbance (at 261 nm) over a period of 72 h. The absorbance of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM remained nearly constant after sonication. The dispersion was found to be stable for at least a few months. This result indicates that the dispersion of PtNP/MWCNT with POEM was higher than that of PtNP/MWCNT without POEM.
Preparation of PtNP/MWCNT-coated counter electrode
The above obtained PtNP/MWCNT solution was coated on a flexible Ti foil substrate and the formed film was annealed at 390 °C for about 20 min in air. Both PtNP/MWCNT-coated flexible Ti foil and sputtered Pt (s-Pt) film on Ti foil were used as the CE. The thermal properties of POEM were examined by TGA analysis. The polymer shows an excellent thermal stability: 91% weight loss at 390 °C.
Fabrication of DSSCs
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 7 Ω sq.−1, visible transmittance ≧ 80%, NSG America Inc., USA) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP (1.0 g, 0.0035 mol) in 2-methoxyethanol (3.0 g, 0.039 mol) to obtain a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the electrolyte. TiO2 pastes were coated onto the treated conducting glass by using the doctor blade technique. For each coating TiO2 layer, the dried TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. The TiO2 photoanodes of the DSSCs employed in the experiments were composed of a 14 μm thick transparent TiO2 layer and a scattering layer of 4.5 μm in thickness. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 film was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye at room temperature for 24 h. N719 (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was dissolved in ACN and tert-butanol (volume ratio of 1:1) as a standard dye solution. The thus prepared TiO2/dye electrode was placed on a Pt-sputtered conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 W sq.−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan), keeping the two electrodes separated by a 25 μm thick surlyn® (SX1170–25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). The two electrodes were then sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:1) was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillary.
Measurements and instruments
The surface of the DSSC was covered by a mask with a light-illuminated area of 0.16 cm2 and then illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (XES–301S, AM1.5G, SAN–EI Electric Co., Ltd.). Incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The organic content of POEM was analyzed by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA, Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1). The temperature was increased from 100 to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 in air. The plane and cross-sectional views of the PtNP/MWCNT nanohybrid film were observed in scanning electron microscopic images (SEM, NanoSEM 230, Nova™). The PtNP/MWCNT nanohybrid in the dispersion was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JOEL JEM–1230 electron microscope, operating at 100 kV and photographed with a Gatan DualVision CCD Camera). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instrument NS 3a controller with D3100 stage) was employed to estimate the roughness of the substrates using a probe in tapping mode. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC, between the CE and the FTO–TiO2–dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The catalytic ability of the CEs were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). CV was carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical system with s-Pt or PtNP/MWCNT as a working electrode, Pt foil as a CE and Ag/Ag+ electrode as a reference electrode dipped in ACN solution of 10 mM I−, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained at short-circuit condition. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC–L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined below, IPCE (λ) = 1240 (JSC/λφ)(1)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is short-circuit photocurrent (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
Results and discussion
The requisite polymeric dispersant, POEM, was prepared from poly(oxyethylene)diamine of 2000 g mol−1 molecular weight (POE2000) and a dianhydride, 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), at 6:5 molar ratio at 150 °C for several hours. The products are actually mixtures of oligomers containing polar POE (–CH2CH2O–)x segments, aromatic imide (–CONCO–), and amido acids (–CONH–COOH), which were characterized by FT-IR. The idealized structure is illustrated in Scheme 1, showing the characteristic IR absorption peaks. The oligomeric dispersant is soluble in common organic mediums and water. It was found that the dispersant in ethanol could disperse MWCNT well due to the high solvating ability through the presence of lone-pair electrons in POE and imide groups. The structure of aromatic imide groups may well enhance the π–π stacking interaction with the sp2 orbitals of MWCNT. The PtNP/MWCNT/POEM (weight ratio of 2/1/20) nanohybrid was subsequently prepared from the reduction of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution by the added NaBH4 in the presence of POEM dispersed MWCNT solution. Finally, the homogeneous dispersion was coated on flexible Ti foil and annealed at 390 °C for 20 min to afford a flexible panel as shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 3, the nanohybrid (PtNP/MWCNT) film after decomposing the organic POEM was analyzed. Compositions of 20/1 and 2/1 for Pt/MWCNT weight ratio demonstrated a larger number of Pt nanoparticles in tethering with MWCNT in the former sample. The TEM micrographs show the images of PtNP association with the surface of an individual MWCNT. The Pt nanoparticles, around 3.0 to 5.0 nm in diameter, were observed in the surrounding and on the surface of high aspect-ratio MWCNT. (Fig. 3 a, b).

Fig. 4 shows the fiber-like surface morphology of the PtNP/MWCNT/Ti foil CEs prepared with different concentrations of H2PtCl6·6H2O in solution by the in situ process of NaBH4 reduction. Fig. 4a–e show the SEM images for different Pt-loadings by varying the weight ratios of PtNP/MWCNT at 20/1, 10/1, 5/1, 2/1 and 1/1, respectively. At a 20/1 weight ratio (Fig. 4a), the PtNP/MWCNT film revealed a larger number of Pt nanoparticles tethered to MWCNT, leading to the reduction of the specific surface area for the nanohybrid film. When Pt loading is reduced, the specific surface area of the nanohybrid film is increased. The inset in Fig. 4d shows the cross-sectional view at 2/1 weight ratio (thickness 530 nm), which clearly indicated that the Pt nanoparticles have adhered on the MWCNT. Fig. 4f shows the top view of s-Pt on the Ti foil. According to the SEM images, the s-Pt layer up to this thickness (75 nm) is rather uniform and flat, like typical Pt-CE used in DSSCs. On the other hand, the surface morphology of the PtNP/MWCNT CE is nonuniform and very rough, as judged by both SEM and AFM, as will be discussed below.

          SEM images of PtNP/MWCNT films with various weight ratios (wt%) of (a) 20/1, (b) 10/1, (c) 5/1, (d) 2/1, (e) 1/1, observed from top view, and (f) the top view for the sputtered Pt (s–Pt). 

Fig. 5a and 5b show the AFM images of s-Pt and PtNP/MWCNT CEs on Ti foil, respectively. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of s-Pt is on the order of 9.3 nm and that of the PtNP/MWCNT (weight ratio of 2/1) film is 43.5 nm. Hence, the s-Pt surface is smoother than that of the PtNP/MWCNT. By adding MWCNT to the hybrid film, a larger surface area can be achieved. It is expected that the cell efficiency of the DSSC made with PtNP/MWCNT CE would be higher, compared to the DSSC made with the s-Pt CE.

Fig. 6a shows the photocurrent density–voltage curves of DSSCs with PtNP/MWCNT CE at various weight ratios. The photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding open-circuit potential (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and cell efficiency (η) are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the cell efficiency increases with a decrease in the weight ratio for PtNP/MWCNT down to 2/1. The conversion efficiency reaches a maximum at 2/1 weight ratio, at which the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the short-circuit current density (JSC), the fill factor (FF), and the overall conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC are 0.69 V, 18.6 mA cm−2, 0.70, and 9.04%, respectively. When the weight ratio of PtNP/MWCNT continues to decrease to 1/1, the cell efficiency decreased to 7.44%. Its VOC, JSC, and FF values were 0.64 V, 16.33 mA cm−2, and 0.71, respectively (the I–V curve was not shown here). The bare DSSC made with the s-Pt CE (75 nm thickness) only gave a cell efficiency of 7.47% under the same illumination conditions. Meanwhile, the cell performance of the DSSC using a s-Pt CE with a thinner Pt thickness of ca. 20 nm was also measured, and it reached a cell efficiency of 7.94% (Fig. S2†). These results show that MWCNT can serve as an electrochemical catalyst. The electrochemical activity of the MWCNT may be explained in terms of the size of its surface area as it is known that the large surface area of carbon materials is beneficial for its enhancement of electrochemical activity.28 For comparison, the I–V characteristics of the DSSCs using PtNP/MWCNT CEs prepared with two different weight ratios of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM at 2/1/10 and 2/1/30 were also measured, as shown in Fig. S3†. Their corresponding photovoltaic parameters were listed in Table S1†. It can be found from Table S1† that the DSSCs using PtNP/MWCNT CEs prepared with two different weight ratios of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM at 2/1/10 and 2/1/30 showed lower JSC values of 17.49 and 17.68 mA cm−2, respectively, than that of DSSC using PtNP/MWCNT CE prepared with the weight ratio of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM at 2/1/20. Therefore, the DSSC using PtNP/MWCNT CE prepared with the weight ratio of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM at 2/1/20 possessed better cell conversion efficiency (9.04%) than that of the other two conditions (8.67% for the condition of 2/1/10; 7.95% for the condition of 2/1/30). Furthermore, the I–V characteristics of the DSSCs using PtNP/MWCNT CEs with two different film thicknesses were also investigated, and the weight ratio of PtNP/MWCNT/POEM was fixed at 2/1/20 (Fig. S4†). From the cross-section SEM images (Fig. S5†), one of the PtNP/MWCNT film thickness was ca. 430 nm and another film thickness was ca. 1 μm. The DSSCs using PtNP/MWCNT CEs with film thicknesses of 380 nm (7.72%) and 1 μm (8.49%) showed lower cell conversion efficiency than that of DSSC with a film thickness of 530 nm (9.04%) due to their lower JSC values.

In addition, the IPCE was measured by monitoring the photocurrent at different wavelengths. Fig. 6b shows the IPCE of the DSSCs with s-Pt CE and PtNP/MWCNT CE (at 20/1 and 2/1 weight ratios); these results are consistent with the higher JSC value (18.60 mA cm−2) of the cell with PtNP/MWCNT CE (at 2/1 weight ratio) than that of the cell with s-Pt CE (15.14 mA cm−2). This higher IPCE value rendered a higher JSC (18.60 mA cm−2), as compared to that of the cell with other weight ratios of PtNP/MWCNT. These results indicate that the PtNP/MWCNT act as an electrocatalyst. In general, the electrochemical activity of the PtNP/MWCNT nanohybrid is related to its surface area and the Pt loading.11
Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was employed to analyze the interfacial resistances in the DSSCs. Fig. 7 shows the EIS spectra of the DSSCs with the configuration FTO/TiO2/dye/PtNP/MWCNT/Ti foil containing various weight ratios of PtNP/MWCNT. The equivalent circuit is shown as the inset of the figure. In general, the EIS spectrum of a DSSC shows three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The ohmic series resistance (Rs) can be determined from the high frequency of the impedance where the phase is zero. The first and second semicircles are assigned to the charge-transfer resistances at the CE (Rct1) and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct2), respectively. The Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Rdiff) is associated with the third semicircle. However, in this work the conventional diffusion resistance of the redox couple is apparently greatly overlapped by Rct2 due to a short length for I− ion diffusion available with the thin spacer used (25 μm thick), and owing to the low viscosity of the solvents used in the electrolyte (viscosities of ACN and MPN are 0.37 cP and 1.60 cP, respectively). As shown in Fig. 7, it is observed that size of the semicircle decreases with the reduction of Pt loading. Rct1 values of 1.28, 0.83, and 0.80 ohm were obtained for the bare s-Pt and PtNP/MWCNT CEs at weight ratios of 20/1 and 2/1, respectively. The origin of such a high electrocatalytic property in PtNP/MWCNT electrodes is still not very clear. Some reports claimed that a large surface area and defect-rich edge planes can enhance the electron-transfer kinetics.29,30

The electrocatalytic properties of the s-Pt and the PtNP/MWCNT CE with a weight ratio of 2/1 were also studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 8. The CV in Fig. 8 shows an anodic peak current density (Ipa) and a cathodic peak current density (Ipc), corresponding to the oxidation of I− ions and the reduction of I3− ions, respectively. The magnitude of the Ipc represents the catalytic ability of a CE for I3−reduction in a DSSC. It is clear that the value of Ipc for the PtNP/MWCNT CE (at 2/1 weight ratio) is larger than others, revealing its highest electrocatalytic ability among all, including both s-Pt and PtNP/MWCNT Pt CEs.

Conclusions
DSSCs with a flexible PtNP/MWCNT CE using Ti foil as the substrate are proposed. The nanohybrid CE was prepared by using synthesized polymer, POEM, as the dispersant. The best cell efficiency of 9.04% (under 100 mW cm−2) was obtained when the weight ratio of PtNP/MWCNT was maintained at 2/1, which is higher than that of the DSSC made with the conventional CE using s-Pt (η = 7.47%) or MWCNT (η = 3.66%) alone. Based on the surface morphology and the CV measurements of the CEs, the PtNP/MWCNT CE with a low Pt-loading has a rougher surface and consequently gives higher catalytic ability as compared to that of the s-Pt. We believe that this novel CE could be very useful for reducing the manufacturing cost of DSSCs and improving the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
