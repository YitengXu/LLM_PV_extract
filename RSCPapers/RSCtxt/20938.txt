1. Introduction
The IV–VI groups of semiconductors have been attracting much interest due to their potential application in optoelectronic devices and solar cells. Dittrich et al.1 have studied sulfosalts and emphasized their importance in the field of optoelectronics. In recent years, tin chalcogenide compounds such as SnS,2 SnS2 (ref. 3) and Sn2S3 (ref. 4) have a significant role to play in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices because of its favorable optical band gap energy, high optical transmittance, and optical absorption coefficient. These semiconductor thin films are made up of inexpensive, non-toxic and earth abundant constituents.4 The optoelectronic properties of Sn–S based compounds are suitable for building photovoltaic p–n or p–i–n structures with high conversion efficiency of the order of 25%.5 Among the tin chalcogenides, tin mono sulfide (SnS) is a very promising material for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices because of its favorable optical band gap energy of 1.35 eV, near optimum for photovoltaic solar energy conversion and high optical absorption coefficient > 104 cm−1.2 For p–n hetero junction devices using p-type SnS as the absorber layer with wide energy band gap transparent semiconductor as the n-type partner.6 SnO2, ZnO, CdS and ZnS are the best choice for n-type material with p-type SnS layer for hetero junction devices. In general, the physical properties of a material, particularly in thin film form depend on deposition parameters as well as on the film thickness. The performance of the hetero junction depends up on the thickness of n-type partner and various properties of deposited SnS films. SnS2 and Sn2S3 have been used for many applications such as window layers3 and near lattice-matched hetero junctions4 in thin film solar cells because of their suitable optical and electrical properties. SnS thin films have been prepared using different methods such as vacuum thermal evaporation,6 co-evaporation,7 radio frequency sputtering,8 electron beam evaporation,9 atomic layer deposition,10 pulse electro deposition,11 plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition,12 spray pyrolysis,13–15 chemical bath deposition16,17 and electrochemical deposition.18
In the present work, the SnS thin films has been deposited on soda lime glass substrates with different thicknesses from 170 nm to 915 nm by co-evaporation technique. The structural, surface morphological, electrical and optical properties of these films have been investigated as a function of the film thickness. The influence of thickness on photo conductivity, photo response, and decay time of the films is calculated and reported here. The optical properties such as refractive index n (λ), extinction coefficient k (λ), absorption coefficient (α) and band gap (Eg) of the deposited films studied and reported using the interference phenomena in transmission spectra data.
2. Experimental
Tin sulfide (SnS) thin films have been deposited on glass substrates in the thickness range of 170 nm to 915 nm using co-evaporation technique. Tin wire (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) and sulfur powder (Sigma-Aldrich) were taken as source materials. Tin wire evaporated from molybdenum boat by applying a constant power and sulfur powder was evaporated from a glass crucible kept in a tungsten basket. In this technique, the source to substrate distance was fixed at 22 cm. The evaporation was carried out in a high vacuum chamber with ultimate vacuum of the order of 3.5 × 10−6 Torr. After reaching the evaporation temperature of source materials, shutter over the boats was moved to sideways for the deposition of the SnS thin film on the glass substrates.19 The rate of deposition and thickness of the films was determined using SQM 160 quartz crystal thickness monitor. Prior to the deposition process, the glass slides were cleaned by cleaning procedure reported elsewhere.4 Finally, these cleaned substrates were loaded into the substrate holder of vacuum chamber. The substrates were further cleaned by ion-bombardment (HT) in vacuum chamber for ten minutes, prior to the deposition of the film. SnS thin films with different thicknesses have been deposited on glass substrates at a substrate temperature of 300 °C. A 1 kW heater with PID controller was used as the substrate heater.
The structural properties of the deposited films were investigated by RIGAKU ULTIMA III X-ray diffractometer. Raman spectroscopy (Horiba lab RAM HR evolution micro-Raman spectrometer) was carried out to identify the phases present in the SnS thin films. The morphology of the deposited layers was studied using Zeiss Ultra 55 FE-SEM. The elemental composition was analyzed using EDS spectra, recorded using Thermo Scientific ultra dry EDS detector attached to Hitachi 3000s SEM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM-Park NX10) was used to study the morphology and surface roughness of the film. The optical transmittance measurements were carried out using UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO V-670) in the wavelength range of 200–3000 nm. The photo current and photo response of as-deposited samples are characterized under AM 1.5 G spectrum at a constant applied bias 5 V using Keithley (6517A) by two probe method at room temperature. The temperature dependent resistance measurement of the deposited films was carried out in the temperature range of 320 to 425 K under a vacuum of 10−2 Torr. Hall effect measurement in van der pauw configuration (ECOPIA HMS-5000) was employed for understanding the type, carrier density and mobility.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of SnS thin films with various thicknesses. The diffraction peaks observed for the deposited samples are at 2θ values of 22.30°, 26.22°, 27.43°, 30.61°, 31.82°, 39.15°, 45.74°, 48.89°, 53.28°, 54.51° and 64.25°. These peaks can be assigned to (110), (021), (220), (101), (040), (041), (211), (160), (061) and (251) planes respectively. These values are in close agreement with the standard orthorhombic phase of the SnS (JCPDS 39-0354) with preferential orientation along (040) plane. It indicates that maximum number of crystallites have the growth orientation along (040) direction. Reddy et al. observed a similar (040) preferred orientation for SnS thin films using co-evaporation technique.7 A marginal shift has been observed for the major peak (040) at the lower thickness (170 nm). In addition to that small shift is observed for the peaks (120), (110) and (211) for all the deposited films. The observed marginal shift in the position of the peaks in the as-deposited films can be attributed to the presence of strain between a substrate and the deposited films. The intensity of (040) increases up to a thickness of 426 nm and then found to decrease slightly for the 915 nm film. The calculated d-spacing values are comparable with JCPDS data (39-0354). The lattice parameters corresponding to orthorhombic crystal structure were calculated using the relation 
(1)where d is the inter planar distance and (hkl) are the miller indices. The calculated lattice parameter values are tabulated in Table 1. These calculated lattice parameters of the as-deposited films are very close to the standard JCPDS of SnS (39-0354). From the table, it is observed that the change in the lattice parameters a, b and c of the deposited SnS thin films are marginal with the increase of film thickness. These small variations are probably due to the variation in strain. The presence of strain in the as-deposited films might be due to the defects, deviation in stoichiometry or mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and film. The structural parameters such as average crystallite size (D), micro strain (ε) and dislocation density (δ) of the films are calculated using the relations 
(2) 
(3) 
(4)where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (1.54 Å), θ is the Bragg angle and β is the full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of the (040) peak of SnS. The calculated structural parameters of the deposited films are tabulated in Table 2. From the table it is observed that the variation of average crystallite size is marginal with respect to film thickness. A similar trend in average crystallite size of the films at higher thickness has been observed for SnS20 and ZnS.21 From the table, it is observed that the variation of the micro strain and dislocation density in the films is proportional with the crystallite size and vary with the increase of film thickness. As mentioned earlier the presence of micro strain in films is responsible for the slight shift in the position of XRD peaks.

3.2 Raman analysis
The Raman spectroscopic analysis has been carried out to further understand the structural phases of as-deposited thin films in the range of 50–600 cm−1 at room temperature. The Fig. 2 shows Raman modes at 64 cm−1, 94 cm−1, 160 cm−1, 185 cm−1 and 214 cm−1, related to various optical phonons modes of SnS phase. Among the detected modes, peak presented at 185 cm−1 and 214 cm−1 are assigned to the longitudinal optical Ag (LO) mode, whereas the other mode at 94 cm−1 belongs to the transverse optical Ag (TO) mode. These Ag (LO) and Ag (TO) modes are very close to the Raman modes reported by Reddy et al.22 It is observed that the intensity of Raman mode at 94 cm−1, 185 cm−1 and 214 cm−1 increases with the increase of film thicknesses. The observed B2g optical Raman modes at 160 cm−1 is attribute to SnS phase, which is in close agreement with reported Raman data by Mathews et al.23 The modes at 64 cm−1 is assigned to the combination of Ag and B2g modes of the SnS phase. Similar Raman modes are reported by Reddy et al.22 From the Raman data it can be noticed that, no variation in Raman modes observed for the deposited films except the Raman mode at 214 cm−1 for 170 nm and 280 nm films, which is very marginal. This result confirms that the films grown at different thickness are pure SnS without any impurity phases like SnS2 and Sn2S3, which have their strongest Raman peaks at around 312 cm−1 and 308 cm−1 respectively. Thus Raman studies along with XRD confirm the formation of single phase SnS thin films by co-evaporation technique.

3.3 Composition analysis
The EDX analysis of SnS thin films shows that tin and sulfur composition in the layers vary with the increase of film thickness at a constant substrate temperature. The film compositions are tabulated in Table 3. From the table, it can be noticed that the Sn/S ratio decreases slightly with increase of film thickness. Devika et al.20 also observed a similar trend in sulfur variation of SnS thin films with increase of film thickness. In general, the evaporated tin and sulfur atoms might reach the substrate surface with different energies due to their different vapor pressures. At a lower thickness of 170 nm, it is observed a larger sulfur deficiency, which might be due to either a heat gradient between the substrate surface and deposited material or a lower sticking coefficient. This would enhance the scattering of sulfur atoms from the film surface. These effects are expected to reduce at the higher thickness, because the scattering loss comes down due to a reduction in heat gradient because of the formation of cluster of crystallites. Prathap et al.21 also observed an increase in sulfur content with increase of film thickness for ZnS thin film.

3.4 Morphological studies
The Fig. 3(a)–(d) depicts SEM micrographs of the SnS thin films deposited in the film thickness range of 170 nm to 915 nm. The surface morphology of the films shows interesting results with increase of film thicknesses. All deposited films exhibit poly crystalline nature and regular barley shape crystallite morphology. These crystallites are directed randomly on the surface of the films without any visible cracks and holes. A similar type of regular barley like morphology was observed in SnS thin films using thermal evaporation in an earlier report.20 Fig. 3(a–d) clearly shows that the average grain size increases with increase of film thickness and the layers became more densely packed with rough surface morphology. SnS thin films deposited at lower thickness exhibit uniformly distributed small grains across the substrate surface with regular shapes. The surface structure of the films deposited at higher thicknesses contained more or less uniform and tightly bonded barely crystallites shapes. The Fig. 4(a)–(d) depicts the cross-sectional view of all the deposited samples at a constant substrate temperature of 300 °C. The thicknesses of the deposited films on the substrate at different deposition time are estimated as 170 nm, 280 nm, 426 nm and 915 nm respectively.

The surface morphology and surface roughness of SnS thin films have been investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The Fig. 5(a)–(d) shows the 3D micrographs of SnS thin films are recorded with a scan area of 3 μm × 3 μm. These images clearly show that the dependence of average grain size as well as surface roughness on the film thickness. From 3D micrographs, it is observed that the average grain size and surface roughness increases with increase of the film thickness. The lower thickness films (170 nm) show smaller crystallites that are uniformly distributed over the surface. Further, increase of thickness these smaller crystallites becomes larger with an improvement in the grain size. The growth of crystallites at different thickness of the films can be understood from the following: at the initial stages of the film growth, there are many nucleation centers present on the substrate surface. For shorter deposition time interval the film with small crystallites are not able to grow into larger ones, hence the thinner films have small crystallites. As film thickness increases, coalescence of the small grains occurs to form bigger crystallites in the films. The average grain size increases form 140 nm to 350 nm with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. The average roughness of the film increases from 12 nm to 40 nm with increase of film thickness. A similar increase of roughness with increase of film thickness has been observed in ZnS,21 In2S3 (ref. 24) and In2O3 (ref. 25) thin films. The increase of surface roughness with thickness is associated with the increase of grain size of the films. As the thickness of the film increases, the density of grain boundaries decreases due to the growth of bigger grains, which leads to the large variation in the height of the grains on the film surface. Therefore, it is apparent that the grain sizes as well as the surface roughness vary with the thickness of the films.

3.5 Optical properties
Fig. 6 shows the optical transmittance spectra of the SnS thin films deposited at different thickness in the wavelength range of 200–3000 nm. The spectra of the films deposited above the film thickness of 170 nm exhibited interference patterns because the films thickness is greater than λ/2, where λ is the wavelength of incident light. The appearance of the interference fringes in the transmittance spectra is an indication of good surface homogeneity and uniformity of the deposited films. A sharp increase in the transmittance is observed for all films, which is related to the fundamental absorption edge or critical wavelength (λc). This sharp increase in transmittance of the films also can be attributed to the single phase and presence of the direct optical transition in the films. From the figure, it is observed that the fundamental absorption edge was shifted towards longer wavelength side, indicating a change in the energy band (Eg) and also decrease in transmittance with increases of film thickness. From these results it is expected that more and more photons are absorbed in the material as the thickness is increased. A similar continuous shift in the fundamental absorption edge towards longer wavelengths with increase of film thickness is observed in SnS26 and ZnS21 thin films. The absorption coefficient (α), calculated from the transmittance spectra shows that the absorption coefficients for all the films are more than 105 cm−1, which is higher than reported value (104 cm−1) by thermal evaporation.20 The absorption coefficient values for the deposited films increases with increase of film thickness at a wavelength of 1000 nm. Similar results have been observed in ZnS21 and CdS27 thin films reported by different methods.

3.5.1 Refractive index. The refractive index (n) of the samples in the spectral region of transparent and weak absorption can be estimated using method of envelop developed by Swanepoel28 based on the idea of Manifacier et al.29 
(5)where  where n0 is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (air), which is taken as 1 and ns is the refractive index of the glass substrate, which is taken as 1.51, TM is the transmittance maxima, Tm is the transmittance minima, λ and λc are incidental and critical wavelengths. The variation of refractive index of SnS thin films with wavelength is shown in Fig. 7. It is observed that the refractive indices of all the samples attains a sharp curve at a point of critical wave length (λc), which shifts towards higher wavelength with the increase of film thickness, beyond that it attains a marginal increase with increase of wavelength. Selim et al.6 noticed that the refractive index attains a peak in the absorption region, which is shifted towards higher wavelength with increase of film thickness. Similar variations of refractive index with wavelength have been observed in SnS15 and Sn2S3 (ref. 4) thin films. At lower thickness 170 nm the refractive index of the film could not be calculated due to the absence of interference peaks in the transmission spectra. The spectra of the films deposited above the thickness of 170 nm exhibited interference patterns. This kind of interference phenomena occurs only the films thickness is greater than λ/2, where λ is the wavelength of incident light. Devika et al.20 also observed that the absence of interference peaks in the transmission spectra for lower thickness up to 250 nm. Generally, the refractive index depends up on the preparation conditions, density of the voids and their volume fraction, which are related to the packing density of the materials. The refractive index varies from 2.99 to 2.11 with increase of film thickness from 280 nm to 915 nm. The small decrease of refractive index with increase of thickness might be due to the distribution of film grains. Prathap et al.21 have been observed that the thickness of ZnS films above 400 nm shows decrease in refractive index due to the size distribution effect of the grains.

3.5.2 Thickness of deposited thin films. The as-deposited thin film samples exhibit well defined interference fringes in the visible and near IR range of the transmittance spectrum. The thicknesses of the deposited thin films are calculated using two consecutive maxima or two minima as proposed by Swanepoel.28 
(6)where n1 and n2 are indices of refraction for two adjacent transmittance maxima or minima of the interference fringes and λ1, λ2 are corresponding wavelengths. The thickness of SnS thin films are estimated as 298 nm, 656 nm and 1270 nm respectively. These values are closer to the values obtained from cross sectional image of SEM.
3.5.3 Extinction coefficient. The extinction coefficients of the as-deposited films are calculated in the wave length range of 850–3000 nm from the interference free-transmission curves (Tα) of transmission spectra using envelop method28 
(7)Inset in Fig. 7 shows extinction coefficient of all SnS thin films at different substrate temperatures. The value of extinction coefficient is found to be of the order of 10−3. It can be seen that the extinction coefficient of all the samples increases with increase of wavelength above critical wavelength (λc). This value of λc is different for films deposited at different thickness.
The optical energy band gap (Eg) of the as-deposited thin films are evaluated using the following equation 
αhν = B(hν − Eg)n
(8)where α is absorption coefficient, B is a parameter that depends on the transition probability and Eg is the optical band gap. The exponent n depends on the nature of the transition n = 1/2, 2, 3/2 or 3 for allowed direct, allowed in-direct, forbidden direct or forbidden in-direct transitions respectively. The direct6,7,9,11,12,15,17 and indirect band gap8,18 of SnS thin films have been reported by various authors, depending on the preparation methods and conditions during the deposition. The Fig. 8(a)–(d) shows the optical band gap energy values of SnS films, estimated using Tauc plot between (αhν)2 vs. hν for all the samples. The plot of (αhν)2 vs. hν is a straight line and its energy axis intercept at (αhν) = 0 gives the energy band gap (Eg) of the material. In the present study n = 1/2 is found to have a linear fit of the Tauc plot, which shows the existence of a direct optical transition. In this case n = 2, Tauc plot does not show linear fit for the in the band edge region. This indicates that the indirect band gap transition is not a dominant case in the as-prepared SnS samples. The energy band gap of the films decreases from 1.51 eV to 1.24 eV with the increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. In general, the band gap of the thin films depends on different factors such as composition,4 crystallite size, residual strain, defects and change in preferred orientation.25 However, in the present study, the variation in residual strain and composition with respect to thickness is marginal. The decrease in band gap energy with film thickness is correlated to its average crystallite size. The crystallite size and the band gap energy are related by the following relationship.30,31 
(9)where r is the radius of the particle, μ is the effective mass of the system and Eg(bulk) is the band gap of the bulk SnS (1.24 eV). In other words, the band-gap is inversely proportional to the crystallite size. The band gap values are calculated from the experimental results follow a similar trend to the band gap values calculated using relation (9). In the present study, it is observed that the crystallite size increases with increases of film thickness and the band gap decreases with increase of film thickness or crystallite size. Jain et al.31 also observed that, decrease in band gap of the annealed SnS thin films with increase of film thickness or grain size.

3.6 Electrical properties
Electrical properties of the SnS thin films have been studied as a function of film thickness using Hall measurement technique at room temperature. The measured carrier concentration, resistivity and mobility of the as-deposited films are tabulated in Table 4. It is observed that all the films exhibit p-type behavior. Gao et al.17 also reported similar conductivity type for sprayed SnS thin films. The resistivity of the films decreases from 6.46 × 10−1 Ω cm to 1.09 × 10−1 Ω cm with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. The observed resistivity values are lower than the values (103 Ω cm) reported by thermal evaporated of SnS thin films.22 The decrease in the resistivity values with increase of film thickness have been reported earlier.4,20,21,24 Generally, the variation in the electrical resistivity of the deposited films depends on grain size, residual stress and lattice defects such as vacancies, interstitials and presence of binary phases of the films. In the present investigation the effect of stress on the electrical properties is marginal. The variation in electrical conductivity and resistivity of the films depends mainly on the grain size of the films. In this study, it is observed that the average grain size of the deposited films increases with increase of film thickness. Normally, the thinner film shows high resistivity due to the presence of higher number of lattice defects, poor crystallinity and availability of many inter-crystalline regions, which affect the growth of grains to a sufficiently large size. When the film thickness increases, the crystallinity is improved gradually, the structure becomes more uniform and grains are comparatively larger and allow the carriers to move freely in the lattice leading a reduction in resistivity.

The temperature dependent electrical resistivity of SnS thin films has been measured in the temperature range of 300–425 K under a vacuum of 10−3 Torr using four-probe method. The behavior of the resistivity with temperature of all the films have been performed for two cycles, it is observed that resistivity decreases with the increase of temperature. The activation energy of the charge carriers is calculated using the relation 
(10)where σ is the conductivity, σ0 is the proportionality constant, ΔE is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The Fig. 9(a)–(d) shows the plot of ln(σ) versus 1/T for four typical thickness of SnS thin films. The average activation energy of the charge carriers was evaluated from the slope of the two curves. The estimated activation energies of the films decrease from 0.17 eV to 0.11 eV with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. This marginal reduction is associated with the variation of the relative chemical composition. In general, the activation energy of the charge carriers is mainly influenced by the presence of excess tin atoms, which causes an increase of deep acceptor levels.9,12,20 The composition studies (Table 2) show the presence of excess tin in the as-prepared samples. A similar decrease of the activation energy with increase of film thickness has been reported earlier by different methods.20,24,32 Devika et al.20 also reported a reduction in activation energy of evaporated SnS films from 0.32–0.24 eV with increase of film thickness. This result is in agreement with the chemical composition measurements that indicate the existence of an excess of tin atoms compared to the sulfur atoms in the as-prepared samples.

3.7 Photoconductivity
SnS thin films are suitable absorber material in photovoltaic applications and hence it could exhibit better photo current response properties. Fig. 10(a) shows the structure of SnS thin film photo-sensor with Ag ohmic contacts. In general, the conditions for choosing the metal contacts for ohmic or non-rectifying junction are (a) the work function (φm) of the metal contact should be closer to the work function (φs) of SnS (b) the work function of metal should be greater than the electron affinity of SnS (χs). In this study, the silver has been selected as contacts, since it satisfy the above conditions. Devika et al.33 have studied non-rectifying behavior of M/SnS structures with different metal contacts (M = Al, In, Ag and Sn). The Fig. 10(b and c) shows the energy band diagram for the SnS/Ag semiconductor–metal junctions at equilibrium in dark and under illumination. The values of φs, χs, φm and barrier height (φB) are taken from the literature.33 The barrier height (φB) of the SnS/Ag junction is estimated using the equation φB = Eg − (φm − χs). The barrier height values of the SnS/Ag junction decreases from 0.35 eV to 0.08 eV with increase of SnS film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. The decrease of barrier height with increase of film thickness is due to the increase in grain size of the films. Since SnS is a p-type semiconductor with work function closer to the work function of Ag, the semiconductor bands will bend downward in order to align the Fermi level as shown in Fig. 10(b). At equilibrium conditions, the depletion layer is formed across the semiconductor–metal interface with negative charge on SnS side and positive charge on Ag side. Under illumination, electron–hole pairs are generated in the depletion region. The holes get attracted towards the negative charge of SnS side and the electrons get attracted towards the positive charge on Ag. Thus the SnS gets positively biased with respect to Ag. Since electrons are moving towards Ag, the Fermi level of Ag rises compared to SnS Fermi level as shown in Fig. 10(c). This separation of the Fermi levels leads to the development of photo voltage V as shown in Fig. 10(c). The photo conductivity of SnS films with different thicknesses is characterized under AM 1.5 G spectrum using two probe method. The silver electrodes are deposited on the film surface with an area of 0.03 cm2. The sample is connect to the experimental set up and maintained in dark under a constant applied bias of 5 V to stabilize the current. After the stabilization period, the current values are recorded in the following sequences: 20 s in dark and 20 s under illumination. Photo conductivity of the films measured from the current using the equation 
(11)where I is the measured current, d is the film thickness, V is the applied voltage and A is the device area. The photo sensitivity usually considered as a figure of merit while discussing the photoconductivity of films and is calculated using the equation 
(12)where σL and σD are the electrical conductivities of the films under dark and illumination. Normally, sensitivity is a measure of how much conduction increases in a sample with light intensity. The evaluated photo sensitivity values are tabulated in Table 5. These results show that the as-deposited films are photosensitive. From the table, it is observed that the sensitivity varies proportionately with the σL/σD ratio on increase of film thickness. The photoresponse parameters like photoresponsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D) have been calculated for the structure of glass/SnS/Ag with different thickness of SnS thin films from the I–V measurements. The photo responsivity (R) defined as the amount of photocurrent generated per unit area per unit illumination intensity, and calculated using the following relation.34,35 
(13)where Lλ is the incident illumination intensity of light source which is 100 mW cm−2 and S is the effective illumination area. The specific detectivity (D) is defined as a measure of the least detectable radiant power and calculated from the following relation34

The calculated values of photo responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D) are tabulated in Table 5. It is observed that the responsivity and specific detectivity of the films increase sharply up to 426 nm. There after only a small increase in their values for the 915 nm films. A similar trend of thickness dependence has been observed for the SnS thin films deposited by chemical bath deposition.36,37 Normally, the photoresponsivity depends on the σL − σD, intensity of light source and effective illumination area. From the Table 5, it can be noticed that σL − σD increases with increase of film thickness, which is due to increase in optical absorption coefficient of the films. In this work, the optical parameters like responsivity and specific detectivity have been studied with different thickness of the films at a constant intensity of light source (100 mW cm−2) and effective illumination area (0.03 cm2). In addition to this, as the film thickness increases the grain size is found to increase. The grain boundaries are barriers for the charge carriers, which affect the conductivity of the semiconductor. The height of the barrier decreases with increase of film thickness due to the increase of grain size. Hence the thicker films can absorb more number of photons and can generate more number of charge carriers. In thicker films, the generated charge carries can overcome the interface barrier more easily because of the lower barrier height compared to the lower thickness films. This enhanced conduction of photo generated carriers leads to the overall enhancement in the photoresponsivity as a function of thickness in SnS thin film. Moreover the electrical studies (Table 4) also indicate that the electrical resistivity decreases and carrier concentration increases with film thickness. Basu et al.38 observed a thickness dependent enhancement in photoresponsivity of the aluminum doped zinc oxide layer for ZnO:Al/Si heterostructures. Guo et al.39 observed that the responsivity of the photodetector ZnO/Pt/ZnO increases with increases of thickness of the top ZnO layer, due to the enhancement in absorption coefficient of the ZnO layer. Normally, the light generated current density (JL) depends on the film thickness and absorption coefficient. The value of (JL) sets the upper limit of the short circuit current density (Jsc), when a particular semiconductor thin film is used as the absorber element in a solar cell.37 When the Jsc closer to the JL, which gives the upper limit of light generated current density (JL,max). Nair et al.36,37 estimated the upper limit of light generated current density (JL) as a function of thickness of orthorhombic SnS thin films using chemical deposition method. The variation of JL is observed for the orthorhombic SnS films up to 1 μm. The value of JL increases up to a thickness of 250 nm, further increases marginally and then finally saturate with increase of film thickness. In the present study, from the Table 5, it can be noticed that, the responsivity and specific detectivity increases sharply with increase of film thickness up to 426 nm, further increases only marginally with increase of film thickness. This indicates saturation in responsivity and specific detectivity with film thickness.
In the present work, the visible light photo detector properties like photoresponsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D) of the device structure glass/SnS/Ag with different thickness of co-evaporated SnS thin film have been studied and reported for the first time. The properties of SnS thin films obtain from the present work is compared with different deposition methods and reported in Table 6. Fig. 11(a)–(d) shows the switching behavior of the photo-response versus time, when light source is on/off conditions, measured for four cycles with different thickness of SnS thin films. The dark, photo and ratio of photo (σL) to dark (σD) electrical conductivities of the SnS films are estimated and tabulated in Table 5. From the table it is observed that the dark conductivity increases from 3.03 × 10−11 (Ω cm)−1 to 2.65 × 10−9 (Ω cm)−1 with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. Nair et al.26 also observed that the dark conductivity increases with increases of film thickness. The photo conductivity increases from 5.58 × 10−11 (Ω cm)−1 to 3.50 × 10−9 (Ω cm)−1 with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. From the figure, it is observed that the dark and photo conductivity of the films increase by more than two orders with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. The increase in conductivity with increase of film thickness might be due to change in composition of the films. From the table, it can be concluded that the change in ratio of σL/σD of the all samples is correlated to the Sn/S ratio of the films. Gao et al.17 also observed that the ratio of photo to dark conductivity decreases with increase of S/Sn ratio of the SnS samples. Fig. 11(a)–(d) shows an initial rise in current during illumination and a rapid decay followed by a slow decay when the illumination is cut off. The rapid rise and decay of photo current is attributed to localized recombination mechanism. The Fig. 11(a) shows an initial increase in σL/σD ≈ 1.84 followed by a decline to σL/σD ≈ 1.62 after 10 seconds. Similarly, the Fig. 11(b) shows an initial increase in σL/σD ≈ 1.55 followed by a decline to σL/σD ≈ 1.45 after 10 seconds. A similar decline in photoconductivity of the SnS thin films have been observed by Johnson et al.40 Generally, the photo generated carriers reach an equilibrium concentration in a time that is the order of the life time of the electrons in the material. The carrier life time was calculated from the decay data fit to an exponential of the form 
I = I0exp(−t/τ)
(15)where I0 is the initial current and I is current at the instant t. It can be noticed that the decay of photo current depends on the two components, namely the fast decay and the slow decay. The as-deposited films exhibit a transient current in the dark after the illumination is cut off, indicating the emission of carriers from trap states. After the light source is cut off, the photo current decrease quickly at first due to the direct recombination between charge carrier pairs. This is the fast decay, which gives the surface life time. The trapped electrons and holes are de-trapped from the trapping centers via thermal excitation or tunneling effect. This is the slow decay, which gives the bulk carrier life time. Similar decays are observed for SnS41 and AgInSe2 (ref. 42) films. This two can be expressed by the relation. 
I(t) = I01exp(−τ/τs) + I02exp(−τ/τb)
(16)where τs and τb are surface and bulk carrier life time respectively. It is clear that the recombination process is more rapid than the trapping process. The evaluated surface carrier life times of the deposited films are 0.3, 0.45, 0.96 and 1.2 seconds respectively. The bulk carrier life time increases from 0.5 to 3.0 seconds with increase of film thickness from 170 nm to 915 nm. A similar result has been observed by Jiang et al.41 for SnS thin films grown by sulfurization of sputtered Sn precursor films.

4. Conclusion
SnS thin films have been successfully prepared on glass substrates using co-evaporation technique at a substrate temperature of 300 °C and varying the film thickness in the range of 170–915 nm. The influence of film thickness on the physical properties of SnS films has been investigated. The XRD patterns shows that all the as-deposited films were polycrystalline in nature with the (040) plane as the preferred orientation and exhibit orthorhombic structure. Raman studies confirmed the formation of single phase SnS. The optical constants such as refractive index (n), thickness (d) and extinction coefficient (k) are calculated from transmission spectra using envelop method. The band gap value is found to decreases from 1.51 eV to 1.24 eV with increase of film thickness. The photo response parameters like dark conductivity (σD), photo conductivity (σL), photoresponsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D) of the films increases with increase of film thickness. The Hall effect measurements showed that the films are p-type in nature. From Hall effect data, the electrical resistivity of the films decreases with the increase of film thickness and reached a minimum value of 1.09 × 10−1 Ω cm.
