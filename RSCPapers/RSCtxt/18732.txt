    , Accepted 18th April 2016First published on 18th April 2016AbstractThe development of efficient visible-light responsive macroscopic photocatalysts is crucial for the commercialization of photocatalysis due to the difficult recovery process of photocatalyst nanoparticles. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve macroscopic photocatalysts which cannot only be successfully recycled, but also possess admirable visible-light driven photocatalytic activity. Here we report a one-step cryodesiccation route to fabricate ultra-light and recyclable C3N4/graphene oxide (GO) aerogel. This simple and mild synthesis means that it can be carried out in various containers, which greatly extends the shape and size of C3N4/GO aerogel. The obtained aerogel exhibits both an excellent adsorption capacity for oil, organic solvents, and dyes, and an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of dyes and the oxidation of NO at a ppb level. The successful fabrication of such a fascinating multifunctional aerogel paves the way to integrate 2D lamellar powders into 3D macroscopic photocatalysts for commercial applications in photocatalysis as well as oil remediation.
Introduction
Over past years we have witnessed the rapid development of visible-light driven photocatalysis which is generally regarded as one of the ideal technologies for energy conversion, environmental remediation and organic synthesis.1–4 Despite the impressive progress, photocatalysts have not been widely commercialized, mainly due to the low photocatalytic efficiency and the difficulties in the recovery of the photocatalyst nanoparticles (NPs).5,6 Conventional photocatalyst NPs in powder form have a strong tendency to agglomerate and thus reduce the catalytic activity.7 Moreover, the separation and recovery of photocatalysts not only require miscellaneous and sophisticated operations but the quantitative loss of photocatalyst during the recycling process may also enter human or animal cells with toxic effects.8 The immobilization of powder photocatalysts on a proper support such as films,9,10 ceramic foam11 and reticular stainless steel12 has been widely considered. Nevertheless, immobilized photocatalysts usually reveal poor performance compared to their powder counterparts due to the great decrease in surface area and active sites. On the other hand, graphene aerogel (GA) and its derivative, graphene oxide aerogel (GOA), possess macroscopic 3D porous structures that have benefits such as being ultra-light and having a large specific surface area, good adsorption ability and easy recyclability.13–16 Therefore, hybrid macroscopic materials including TiO2/GA,17 AgBr/GA,18 and BiOBr/GOA19 have shown promising applications in photocatalysis, and can be simply extracted from the system with minimal mass loss using tools such as tweezers. Unfortunately, the majority of hitherto reported routes employ a hydrothermal method which limits the shape of the aerogel and requires elevated temperature and pressure.20 Moreover, the NPs (TiO2, AgBr, BiOBr)17–19 in the aerogel make it difficult to retain macroscopic structural integrity with specific size and shape, and increase the density of the aerogel dramatically. It is thus highly desirable to develop a novel strategy that not only maintains the merits of the aerogel but also reveals an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance.
For this purpose, 2D–2D nanohybrids named “van der Waals heterostructures”,21 which are typically composed of graphene or GO and other 2D materials, are very interesting due to the intimate interfacial contact and exposed reactive centers.22,23 We screened a variety of existing 2D materials and were particularly impressed by C3N4 with a graphite-like structure. Recently, C3N4 has been highlighted as a metal-free, visible-light responsive, nontoxic and stable photocatalyst.24–27 Coupling C3N4 with graphene or GO sheets could manipulate the synergistic effects and thus significantly enhance its catalytic performance.28,29 Inspired by these studies, we believe that a multifunctional aerogel, which exhibits efficient visible-light photocatalytic activity as well as oil adsorption capacity, could be achieved if powder C3N4 could be converted into a macroscopic aerogel.
In the present work, we demonstrate that macroscopic C3N4/GOA photocatalysts with various shapes and sizes can be readily fabricated by freeze casting C3N4 and GO in solution. The obtained macroscopic photocatalysts with ultra-light density (3–5 mg cm−3) exhibit a combination of enhanced visible-light driven photocatalytic activity, photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance and high adsorption capacity. This method can be easily used to fabricate other macroscopic 2D materials (MoS2, BN for example)/GOA photocatalysts and our work paves the way to develop macroscopic photocatalysts for future industrial applications in photocatalysis.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used without any further purification. Graphite powder (average lateral size of 500 μm) was purchased from Qingdao Jin Ri Lai Graphite Co., Ltd. H2SO4 (98 wt%). KMnO4, P2O5, H2O2 (30 wt%), K2S2O8, CH4N2S and ethanol were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd. High-purity milli-Q water was used in all experiments.
Synthesis of C3N4/GOA
The C3N4 used in this study was obtained using a thermal polycondensation method.30 10 g of thiourea powder was placed in an alumina crucible with a cover and then heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 15 °C min−1 in a pipe furnace for 2 h. After reaction, the alumina crucible was cooled to room temperature. The resultant C3N4 was collected and ground into powder. Afterwards, 0.5 g of the powder was put into an alumina crucible without a cover, and further reoxidized for 2 h at 500 °C. The GO was prepared following the previously reported method.14,31 C3N4/GOA was prepared as follows. 180 mg of the C3N4 powder was put into 60 mL distilled water and ultrasonicated for 5 h. Subsequently, 20 mL GO solution with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 was gradually added into the suspension with magnetic stirring and stirring was continued for another 1 h. After that, the homogeneous suspension was put into a culture vessel with a diameter of 15 cm and freeze-dried (−80 °C pre-cooling) for 48 h. To investigate the effect of the amount of C3N4 on the photocatalytic activity, different qualities (0%, 25%, 50%, 90%) of C3N4 were used and the same fabricating process followed. It is worth noting that we conducted these comparative photocatalytic experiments using C3N4 powders which were synthesised through the aforementioned process. MoS2/GOA and BN/GOA were prepared in the same way.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed with a PANalytical X'pert diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Ka radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 20 microscope operated at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) data were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer on samples embedded in KBr pellets. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Japan). Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of radicals spin-trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were recorded at room temperature on a JES FA200 spectrometer. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements were performed using nitrogen adsorption on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000 surface analyzer. PEC measurements were conducted in a three-electrode system on a CH660D electrochemical work station, using the sample films as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The experiment employed a 300 W xenon lamp with a visible light filter (>420 nm). The photocurrent–time dependent experiments on the sample films at open circuit potential (OCV) were performed in 1 M Na2S under chopped illumination with 50 s light on/off cycles. The working electrodes were prepared to be a size of 1 cm × 2 cm.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
Details of the reactor set-up have been reported previously.10 A 150 W metal halide lamp with a visible light filter (>420 nm) was employed to operate the experiment. The lamp was placed vertically 20 cm above the reactor. Powder C3N4 (200 mg) was coated onto two glass dishes with a diameter of 12.0 cm for activity measurements, whereas macroscopic C3N4/GOA with diameter of 12.0 cm was directly used for measurements without any pretreatment. The light intensity on the surface of the sample was 46.8 mW cm−2 determined using an optical power meter (THORLABS PM100D). NO gas was acquired from a compressed gas cylinder at a concentration of 100 ppm of NO (N2 balance) with a traceable National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard. The initial concentration of NO was diluted to 400 ppb using an air stream. The air stream and NO flow rates were controlled at 2.5 L min−1 and 10 mL min−1, respectively. After adsorption–desorption equilibrium, the lamp was turned on. The concentration of NO was measured using a NOx analyzer (Thermo Scientific, 42i-TL).
For photodegradation experiments, 20 mg of the sample was added to the surface of the dye with a concentration of 20 mg L−1, then the dyes were irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp with a visible light filter (>420 nm). The concentration of the dye was determined using a UV-5100 (Anhui Wanyi) spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Fabrication of C3N4/GOA macroscopic photocatalyst

Fig. 1a simply illustrates the formation of the C3N4/GOA photocatalyst. First of all, C3N4 powder with a light yellow color was prepared by the thermal polycondensation of sulfocarbamide (Fig. 1b).30 GO was prepared as a dark brown solution from the oxidation of graphite using Hummer's method (Fig. 1c).14,31 Then, the C3N4 powder was added into water and underwent ultrasonication for good dispersion. This suspension was then added into the GO solution with continuous stirring and ultrasonic treatment to form a uniform mixture (Fig. 1d). Finally, a deep beige C3N4/GOA composite was obtained through subsequent freeze drying to remove water from the system (Fig. 1e). To investigate the effects of the weight ratio of C3N4 on the photocatalytic performance of C3N4/GOA, C3N4/GOA with different weight ratios (0, 25%, 50% and 90%) of C3N4 were prepared for comparison. Without specific notation, C3N4/GOA here has a C3N4 weight ratio of 90%.

Morphology, structure and optical absorption
The obtained C3N4/GOA has a beige color and an ultra-light density of 3–5 mg cm−3 depending on the amount of C3N4, which is remarkably smaller than that of reported BiOBr/GOA (50 mg cm−3)19 and TiO2/GA (19 mg cm−3),17 and so it can easily rest on a ginkgo leaf (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, C3N4/GOA can steadily float in continuous flowing air (Movie S1†). Although the mechanical strength of C3N4/GOA and pristine GOA is not as good as graphene aerogel31 and the shapes of both cannot completely recover after unloading a 10 g counterweight, they can still maintain their macroscopic bulky shapes (Fig. S1†). Of particular interest is that C3N4/GOA can be easily prepared into the desired shape and size, as long as there is a suitable freeze-drying container or mold (Fig. 2b). This breaks the restriction that traditional GOA could only be molded in a cylinder hydrothermal autoclave17–19 and makes the shape of C3N4/GOA versatile which is of paramount importance to meet application requirements. A SEM image (Fig. 2d) of C3N4/GOA demonstrates its network structure composed of nano-sized ultrathin nanosheets, which is typical for GA or GOA. However, examination at a higher magnification shows that unlike pure GOA with a very clean and smooth surface (Fig. 2c), the surface of C3N4/GOA is uniformly covered with small fragments at a size of hundreds of nanometers, which could be attributed to the C3N4 layer on the GO sheet (Fig. 2e). A TEM image of C3N4/GOA further confirms this: both C3N4 and GOA can be clearly observed and C3N4 sheets have adhered onto the surface of the GO sheets, as presented in Fig. 2f.

The PXRD pattern of C3N4/GOA shows three diffraction peaks at 9.9°, 12.9° and 27.7° (Fig. 3a). A comparison between C3N4/GOA and its precursors C3N4 and GO clearly demonstrates that the PXRD pattern of C3N4/GOA is a superposition of that of C3N4 and GO. The peak at 9.9° comes from GO, with an interlayer spacing of 0.890 nm.31 Peaks at 12.9° and 27.7° result from C3N4: the former corresponds to a small tilt angularity in C3N4, which could be indexed as the (100) peak with a plane spacing calculated to be 0.701 nm; the latter corresponds to interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic segments, which is indexed as the (002) peak with a distance of 0.324 nm.24 In addition, the intensity of the diffraction peak of C3N4/GOA originating from GO is much weaker than those from C3N4, which is in accordance with the high weight ratio (90%) of C3N4 in C3N4/GOA. This is also the reason that the FT-IR spectrum of C3N4/GOA is nearly the same as that of C3N4 (Fig. 3b): the peak at 810 cm−1 is the characteristic stretching mode of the triazine units and peaks at 1253, 1327, 1418, 1574, and 1641 cm−1 correspond to the typical stretching modes of C–N heterocycles in C3N4.11,31 Signals relating to GO-like peaks at 1063, 1390 and 1619 cm−1 are covered due to the low content of GO, and only a broad peak at 3300–3500 cm−1 from the stretching mode of –OH could be vaguely related to GO in C3N4/GOA.28,32

XPS was further employed to analyze the elemental composition and binding environment of C3N4/GOA. An XPS survey confirms the presence of C, N and O in C3N4/GOA (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the curve in the high resolution spectrum of C 1s could be deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 284.8, 286.9 and 287.9 eV (Fig. 3d), which are related to sp2 C–C bonding, C–O bonding and sp2 N–CN bonding in the triazine units of C3N4, respectively.32,33 The curve of N 1s is mainly composed of two peaks centered at 398.2 and 400.1 eV (Fig. 3e), which originate from the sp2-bonded N involved in the triazine rings (CN–C) and the bridged nitrogen atoms N–(C)3.33 In addition, a small and wide peak at 403.5 eV could also be observed, which may be attributed to the –NH2 or =NH groups.28 The O 1s spectrum further confirmed the existence of –OH in C3N4/GOA (ESI Fig. S2†).
To be an effective photocatalyst, one prerequisite is that the catalyst must be responsive to visible light, which accounts for about 46% of the full solar spectrum. Therefore, we investigated the UV-vis DRS of C3N4/GOA (Fig. 3f). In contrast to powder C3N4, a more intense absorption throughout the test spectrum is observed for C3N4/GOA, which may originate from the broad and featureless absorption in the same region due to the GO component.34 More importantly, the band gap absorption edge of C3N4/GOA could be extended to about 481 nm, which is an obvious red-shift from that of powder C3N4 at about 453 nm; the band gaps of C3N4/GOA and C3N4 based on the Kubelka–Munk function are hence estimated to be 2.58 and 2.74 eV, respectively. The interaction of GO and C3N4 with the combination of the oxygen containing functional groups could enhance the discreteness of the levels in the vicinity of the Fermi level, and as a result, shifted the valence band edge and reduced the band gap.28,35 This phenomenon indicates that C3N4/GOA is not only a simple combination of C3N4 and GO: there is a synergetic effect between C3N4 and GO in the aerogel, which could largely enhance its response in the visible-light region and thus facilitate the subsequent photocatalytic process.
Photocatalytic performance and adsorption capacity
To evaluate the application of the obtained macroscopic C3N4/GOA for photocatalysis, we carried out photocatalytic experiments in both gaseous and aqueous systems. NO removal at an indoor air level (400 ppb) under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm) was set as the model gaseous photocatalytic reaction and details of the evaluation set-up are given in ESI Fig. S3.†36 All C3N4/GOA samples with C3N4 weight ratios from 0 to 90% exhibit some photocatalytic activity towards NO degradation (Fig. 4a). In particular, the photocatalytic activity of C3N4/GOA increases with increasing weight ratio of C3N4 in the aerogel until it reaches a maximum corresponding to a NO removal rate of 47%, which is achieved by C3N4/GOA with 90 wt% of C3N4. This could be attributed to the increased reaction sites relevant to C3N4. A drop from 47% to 37% in NO removal rate was observed after the replacement of C3N4/GOA by an equal amount of powder C3N4. This probably results from the damaged porosity and reduced surface area of the latter, which would reduce the number of active sites and hinder the diffusion of reactant or product in the system. This was confirmed from the BET test data (ESI Fig. S4†); the surface areas of C3N4/GOA and C3N4 were calculated to be 385.2 and 78.3 m2 g−1, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of reaction intermediate, NO2, in the photocatalytic system was also monitored (Fig. 4b). The proportion of NO2 in the system over C3N4/GOA with 90 wt% of C3N4 (about 22%) is much lower than that with powder C3N4 (about 37%). This indicates that C3N4/GOA has a stronger oxidation ability than powder C3N4: NO could be oxidized more completely into NO3− for the former, while the oxidation process of NO remains at NO2 for powder C3N4. For other samples, the concentration of NO2 is relatively low because of the low degradation rate of NO. It is worth noting that the macroscopic appearance of C3N4/GOA makes them very easy to recycle, and they can be simply managed by hand and prevented from blowing away under a continuous flow of air (ESI Fig. S3†). After running five photocatalytic cycles, a NO removal rate of 42% could still be achieved by C3N4/GOA (Fig. 4c), demonstrating its integrity during the photocatalytic process. The SEM observation after photocatalytic oxidation of NO indicated that C3N4/GOA did not undergo any morphology changes (Fig. S5†). Importantly, after storage in the laboratory environment for 3 months, C3N4/GOA still exhibits an effective and stable NO removal rate similar to that of the freshly prepared sample under visible light (Fig. 4d); this further proved the stability of the macroscopic C3N4/GOA photocatalyst.

(e) Visible light MO degradation activity over C3N4/GOA. (f) Adsorption capacity for different organic solvents and oils over C3N4/GOA. 
The photocatalytic activity of C3N4/GOA in aqueous solution was also evaluated. Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation was first carried out with C3N4/GOA. However, due to the excellent adsorption ability of C3N4/GOA, it is difficult to distinguish photocatalytic degradation from adsorption. In fact, within 1 h, nearly 85% of RhB had been adsorbed by C3N4/GOA in darkness, and the adsorption process continued after with the light on (ESI Fig. S6†). Methyl orange (MO) was finally chosen as the model organic contaminant and a net degradation percentage of 73% (which subtracts the contribution from adsorption) was yielded by C3N4/GOA within 5 h (Fig. 4e) without any assistance of external forces. This result is comparable to other reported related systems,33 and it proves that the present C3N4/GOA with its facile synthesis method could also be a good macroscopic photocatalyst in aqueous solution.
Interestingly, C3N4/GOA shows a good adsorption ability as well. Taking methylene blue (MB) for instance, it is evidently adsorbed by C3N4/GOA, and the degree of adsorption by C3N4/GOA is much greater than that by GOA or C3N4 (ESI Fig. S7†). Of particular interest is that adsorption capacities about 50 to 90 times the weight of C3N4/GOA can be achieved for other organic solvents and oils including phenixin, lube, toluene, n-hexane and alcohol (Fig. 4f), which is even higher than that of graphene–carbon nanotube aerogels (21–35 times).37 Therefore, such a multifunctional aerogel is extremely promising for oil spill remediation.8 First, it is metal-free and can float on water. Second, oil can be adsorbed on the surface of this aerogel. Finally, the adsorbed contaminants can be in situ photocatalytically degraded through the utilization of solar energy.
Based on the above description, we have integrated powder C3N4 into the GOA system with a facile and mild route. On the one hand, GO contains lots of functional groups on its basal planes and edges, such as OH, COOH, epoxy groups and so on.38 Although these groups could reduce the electrical conductivity of GO to some extent, they are important for the covalent interconnection of the GO sheets and the subsequent formation of aerogels.39 On the other hand, hydrophilic residual functional groups on the surface of C3N4 enable it to disperse well in water. Importantly, C3N4 and GO both contain large π-conjugated sheets with lots of functional groups; this structural similarity would largely enhance their interaction through π–π stacking and chemical bonding and facilitate their assembly process in water. This makes the formation of C3N4/GOA under facile conditions possible. Additionally, ultrasonication during the mixing process of GO and C3N4 further promotes C3N4 and the GO sheets to sufficiently contact with each other for a better interaction and should also be conducive for the synthesis of C3N4/GOA. It is worth mentioning that in addition to C3N4, there are some other materials which are structurally analogous to graphene or GO. Two typical representative materials are graphene-like MoS2 and BN (also called “white graphene”). We demonstrate that our method is also applicable for the preparation of GOA with these graphene-like materials as a result of the structure similarity (ESI Fig. S8†), and such new aerogel composites could have appropriate applications in many other fields.
Efficient photocatalysts are mainly determined by three processes: light absorption, charge separation and migration, and surface redox potential.40 Undoubtedly, C3N4/GOA exhibits an improved light absorption in the visible light region compared to powder C3N4 (Fig. 3f). PL spectroscopy as well as photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to understand the charge separation and migration process. The PL spectrum of C3N4/GOA reveals a much lower intensity than that of powder C3N4, indicating the inhibition of the radiative recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 5c).26 The photocurrent of C3N4/GOA is ca. 1.5 × 10−4 A cm−2, which is 2 times higher than that of powder C3N4 (7.5 × 10−5 A cm−2) (Fig. 5d). Meanwhile, the diameter of the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of C3N4/GOA is significantly smaller than that of powder C3N4 no matter if it is in the dark or under light irradiation (Fig. 5e). All of these results demonstrated an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and rapid interfacial charge transfer over C3N4/GOA.41 Moreover, after fitting the data using an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 5f), the resistances of the working electrode (R1) were determined to be ca. 2015 and 27 Ω for powder C3N4 and C3N4/GOA, respectively (details in Table S1†). Therefore, the conductivity of C3N4/GOA is improved by two orders of magnitude compared to pristine C3N4 due to the high conductivity of GO, which can facilitate kinetic charge transfer.2

(g) A schematic diagram to illustrate the photocatalysis process. 
It is generally accepted that ˙OH, ˙O2− and photogenerated h+ are the main reactive species in photocatalytic reactions, and are determined by the surface redox potential of the photocatalyst. The XPS valence band (VB) spectra of powder C3N4 and C3N4/GOA are shown in Fig. 6a. The VB maximum of C3N4/GOA is shifted from 1.57 to 1.97 eV compared to the pristine C3N4 powder, suggesting a stronger oxidative power of the photogenerated holes over C3N4/GOA. This explains the reason why C3N4/GOA can promote the oxidation intermediate NO2 to NO3− (Fig. 4b). Considering that the band gaps of C3N4/GOA and powder C3N4 are 2.58 and 2.74 eV (Fig. 3f), the conduction band (CB) minima could occur at −0.61 and −1.17 eV, respectively. Therefore, the band structures of C3N4/GOA and powder C3N4 are shown in Fig. 6b. The potential energy of the VB holes from both C3N4/GOA and powder C3N4 are lower than that of OH−/˙OH (1.99 eV), whereas the potential energy of the CB electrons is more negative than that of O2/˙O2− (−0.28 eV). Therefore, the holes cannot directly oxidize OH− into ˙OH but the electrons have enough energy to promote the formation of ˙O2−. In addition, the VB holes of C3N4/GOA and powder C3N4 can also directly oxidize NO as they are more positive than those of NO2/NO (1.03 eV), HNO2/NO (0.99 eV) and HNO3/NO (0.94 eV).11 Therefore, the main reactive species in the photocatalytic reactions for these samples are ˙O2− radicals and photogenerated holes. This was confirmed using ESR spin-trap measurements. No DMPO-˙OH signals were observed in either the dark or under light irradiation for both samples (Fig. 5b), whereas signals relating to DMPO-˙O2− emerge with light irradiation (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the formation rate of ˙O2− over C3N4/GOA is obviously higher than that of powder C3N4, benefiting from the high conductivity of GO.

On the basis of the above discussions, GO could not only play a key role in maintaining the macroscopic appearance, but also significantly improved the photocatalytic process (Fig. 5g). First of all, the interfacial interaction between GO and C3N4 can narrow the band gap of C3N4/GOA to improve the light absorption and result in a 0.4 eV downshift of the VB maximum. Secondly, due to the high conductivity of GO, C3N4/GOA reveals an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and rapid interfacial charge transfer. Finally, the photocatalytic reaction is mainly governed by ˙O2− radicals and photogenerated holes. In particular, C3N4/GOA can enhance both the photocatalytic activity and selectivity for the formation of NO3−.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we established a one-pot method for the fabrication of ultra-light macroscopic photocatalysts with various shapes and sizes through a cost-effective freeze-casting process. The macroscopic appearance of C3N4/GOA makes it very easy to recycle. Meanwhile, the obtained aerogel exhibits both an excellent adsorption capacity for oil, organic solvents, dyes, and an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance (activity and selectivity), which is mainly ascribed to the electronic interfacial interaction between C3N4 and GO as well as effective charge separation and transfer. In addition, our method is easily amenable to prepare macroscopic GOA with other graphene-like materials such as MoS2 and BN. This work opens opportunities for the fabrication of multifunctional macroscopic photocatalysts for commercial applications.
