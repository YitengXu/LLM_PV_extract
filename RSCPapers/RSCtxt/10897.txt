    , Accepted 10th June 2013First published on 11th June 2013AbstractIn this paper, uniform rice-shaped lanthanide doped BiPO4 upconversion submicron particles have been successfully synthesized via a facile room-temperature co-precipitation reaction and subsequent calcination route. The morphology, phase transformation and upconversion luminescent properties of synthesized submicron particles (SMPs) were characterized by using different analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra. The transformation from hexagonal phase to monoclinic phase is crucial for upconversion luminescent properties due to the loss of water molecules in the lattice of hexagonal phase. With different variety and concentration of the dopant Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) ions, the obtained samples present bright green, blue, and red upconversion emissions under a 980 nm continual wave laser diode excitation. Multicolor and bright white upconversion emissions have also been obtained by precisely adjusting the dopants concentration in the host lattice.
1. Introduction
Upconversion (UC) is a nonlinear optical process where long wavelength radiation can be converted to high-energy emission via the sequential absorption of two or more photons and energy transfer.1,2 Compared with the conventional luminescent materials, lanthanide doped UC materials have many attractive merits, including large anti-Stokes shifts, narrow band emissions, long lifetimes, tunable emission, superior photostability, low cytotoxicity and low excitation density derived from inexpensive continual wave laser diodes.3–9 In recent years, lanthanide doped UC materials have been widely investigated due to their potential applications in various fields such as solid-state lasers,10 three-dimensional displays,7 temperature sensors,11 solar cells,12 bio-sensors,13 photodynamic therapy14,15 and especially optical imaging.16–18 Among multifarious UC materials, multicolor and white UC materials have attracted increasing attention because of many potential applications in the fields of security labeling,19 backlight sources in color displays,20 multiplexed biological detection21 and multicolor imaging.22 It is well known that the realization of multicolor emissions requires the generation and intensity control of the three fundamental red, green and blue (RGB) colors. Three primary colors of R/G/B emissions can be obtained from Ho3+/Er3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+ co-doped phosphors respectively under the excitation of infrared light, which provides the possibility to produce multicolor and white light UC emissions. The UC emission colors can be precisely tuned by controlling the concentration of activator ions (Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+).23 By multi-doping different lanthanide ions with suitable concentrations into the host matrix, multicolor and white emissions can be obtained in phosphors under single wavelength excitation, which has recently been one of the most effective means of achieving colorful and white UC light.24–27 In addition, multicolor tuning through energy migration upconversion is also an important alternative.28,29
Since UC luminescent properties of UC materials are greatly determined by their hosts, it is important to select a suitable host matrix for the phosphors with high quantum efficiency and excellent optical properties. Up to now, there have been many reports on various host matrixes for UC luminescence, such as fluorides,30–32 oxyfluorides,25,33 oxides,20,34 and vanadates.35 Among these hosts, fluorides exhibit the most efficient UC luminescent properties owing to their low phonon frequencies which can minimize non-radiative losses and maximize the radiative emission intensity.36 However, these fluorides have posed some serious problems, such as the toxicity from fluorine species and relatively poor chemical, thermal and mechanical stabilities, which limit their application in the fields of life and industry. Compared with fluorides, phosphates avoiding the above weaknesses as promising UC host candidates have received more attention. So far, the metal ions of phosphate UC hosts are mainly from the rare earth elements.37–39 Nevertheless, obtaining large quantities of rare earth materials in a highly pure form requires much higher cost compared to the main group elements like bismuth, which can be easily purified in large quantities by techniques like zone refining.40 On account of these reasons, we consider that BiPO4 which is widely used in catalysis,41,42 ion sensing43 and radioactive ions separation44 may also be a low-cost, non-toxic, high-efficiency and stable host matrix for lanthanide doping UC materials. To the best of our knowledge, there are several reports in which lanthanide ions including Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ can be doped into BiPO4 for down-conversion luminescence40,45–50 but still no report on Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Yb3+ doped BiPO4 for UC luminescence.
Herein, we have successfully synthesized Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Yb3+ doped BiPO4 UC SMPs for the first time via a facile room-temperature co-precipitation method and subsequent calcination route. The phase transformations of obtained samples from hexagonal phase (HP) to low-temperature monoclinic phase (LTMP) and high-temperature monoclinic phase (HTMP) are discussed in detail. Red, green and blue UCL emissions were achieved when LTMP and HTMP BiPO4:Ln3+ SMPs were excited by a 980 nm light emitting diode at room temperature. Multicolor and bright white emissions were also obtained by controlling the concentration of Ho3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ ions. The pumping power dependence of the fluorescent intensity was investigated in detail to understand the fundamental UC mechanism. The color coordinates of prepared samples were also evaluated and analyzed using the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Analytical grade Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (99.9%), Er(NO3)3·5H2O (99.9%), Tm2O3 (99.99%) and Ho2O3 (99.99%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagents (Shanghai, China). Tm(NO3)3·6H2O and Ho(NO3)3·6H2O were prepared by dissolving the corresponding metal oxide in nitric acid at elevated temperature. NH4H2PO4, nitric acid, ethylene glycol and ethanol were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagents (Beijing, China). All of the reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout.
2.2. Synthesis
In a typical procedure, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1 mmol) was dissolved in 2.5 mL of ethylene glycol under ultrasonication. 32.5 mL of an aqueous solution containing 1 mmol NH4H2PO4 was added to the above solution under vigorous stirring. A homogeneous white suspension was formed immediately, which was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. The final product was dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight and calcined at 500–900 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The Ln3+ doped BiPO4 SMPs were prepared by the same procedure, except for adding additional relevant Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) into the ethylene glycol solution of Bi(NO3)3 at the initial stage.
2.3. Characterization
The crystal structures and phase purities of the samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with an operation voltage and current maintained at 40 kV and 40 mA. The size, general morphology and structure of the as-synthesized samples were characterized using a Hitachi S4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a FEI TECNAI G2 high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) measurements were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 over the temperature range of 20–1100 °C in air. The UCL spectra were obtained by using a 980 nm laser diode and recorded by a triple grating monochromator (Spectra Pro-2758, Acton Research Corporation, USA) equipped with a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase formation, chemical composition and morphology
TG-DSC of undoped and Yb3+, Er3+/Tm3+/Ho3+-doped BiPO4 SMPs obtained by the room-temperature co-precipitation method was carried out in order to find the presence of lattice water molecules and realize the phase transformations, as shown in Fig. 1. Undoped BiPO4 samples underwent a weight loss process in a wide temperature range from room temperature up to 500 °C corresponding to the loss of water molecules from the hydrated hexagonal BiPO4, which could be divided into two dominant steps, fast weight loss in the range of room temperature to 150 °C and slow weight loss in the range of 150–500 °C. When the temperature was beyond 500 °C, the sample mass became almost constant. The total weight loss of the sample was about 3.4 wt% and the formula of hydrated hexagonal BiPO4 can be concluded to be BiPO4·0.6H2O which is close to the previous report.51 Similar to undoped BiPO4, the weight loss processes of Ln3+ doped BiPO4 can also be divided into two steps, but the temperature changed. The fast weight loss process is increased to the range of room temperature to 250 °C and the slow weight loss process is increased to the range of 250–600 °C. The total weight losses of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+, BiPO4:20% Yb3+/0.5% Tm3+ and BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Ho3+ samples were measured to be ca. 5.3 wt%, 4.9 wt% and 5.1 wt% and the formulas of hydrated hexagonal BiPO4:Ln3+ can be evaluated as Bi0.78Yb0.2Er0.02PO4·0.92H2O, Bi0.795Yb0.2Tm0.005PO4·0.84H2O and Bi0.78Yb0.2Ho0.02PO4·0.88H2O respectively.
 Fig. 1  TG-DSC of the (A) undoped BiPO4, (B) BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+, (C) BiPO4:20% Yb3+/0.5% Tm3+ and (D) BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Ho3+ SMPs obtained at room temperature. 
The DSC curves can help us to understand the phase transformations of BiPO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) SMPs. For undoped BiPO4, the first endothermic peak at 105 °C may be associated with the loss of the absorbed water and a sharp exothermic peak centered at 580 °C might be attributed to the phase transformation of BiPO4.51 For BiPO4:Ln3+, the first endothermic peak remains at 105 °C but the second peak due to the phase transformation is increased to 670 °C, and this phenomenon probably due to lanthanide doping is in accordance with the previous reports on BiPO4:Eu3+ and pure BiPO4.47,51 The different phase transformation properties between undoped BiPO4 and BiPO4:Ln3+ obtained at different temperatures are further discussed in the following XRD patterns.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ SMPs prepared at room temperature (RT) and after calcination from 500 °C to 900 °C for 6 h. Before calcination, the patterns of the obtained sample match well with the standard hexagonal phase BiPO4 (JCPDS: 15-0766), while no other peaks from YbPO4, ErPO4 or other impurities can be detected, which indicates a pure phase after rare earth ions doping. After calcination at 500 °C, the hexagonal phase remained. When the calcination temperature was increased to 600 °C, the phase of the sample is indicated to be the mixed phase of HP, LTMP (JCPDS: 15-0767) and HTMP (JCPDS: 43-0637). But after our endeavor, the pure LTMP of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ can hardly be obtained independently, which is different from undoped BiPO4 having pure LTMP after the calcinations at 500 °C or 600 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). On further increasing the calcination temperature to 700 °C, the sample presents the mixed phase of LTMP and HTMP, and the HP disappeared. When the calcination temperature was raised to 800 °C, the pure HTMP sample of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ was obtained. These phenomena were roughly consistent with the TG-DSC data in Fig. 1. When the temperature was further increased to 900 °C, LTMP reappeared as indicated by the obvious diffraction peaks around 27.3° (200) and 29.1° (120), which is similar to the phase transformation process of pure BiPO4 (Fig. S1, ESI†). All these results demonstrated that the phase transformation of BiPO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) can be tuned to a certain extent by controlling the calcination temperature.

It is interestingly found that the diffraction peaks of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ SMPs exhibit an obvious shift to high angle compared to undoped BiPO4 no matter in which phase the samples are (Fig. 3). This result is caused by smaller ionic radii of Yb3+ (0.985 Å), Er3+ (1.004 Å), Tm3+ (0.994 Å) and Ho3+ (1.015 Å) than that of Bi3+ (1.17 Å) in 8-fold coordination.52 The lattice parameters and cell volumes of doped samples presented in Table 1 were calculated by cell refinement on the basis of XRD patterns. Compared with those of undoped BiPO4, the calculated lattice parameters and especially cell volumes of doped samples revealed a notable decrease. This is also due to the successful substitution of Bi3+ by smaller Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ ions in the host lattice, which is consistent with the XRD patterns shifting towards high angle.

The typical morphologies of the as-synthesized Ln3+ doped BiPO4 SMPs before and after calcination are shown in Fig. 4. A number of uniform rice-shaped SMPs with length around 500 nm and diameter around 200 nm are clearly observed before calcination, which is different from undoped BiPO4 with the morphology of micrometer-size rods (Fig. S2, ESI†). The big difference in morphology for doped and undoped BiPO4 might be due to the lanthanide doping, since the pure YbPO4 phase in the space group of I41/amd tends to form smaller spherical particles,37,53 and a similar phenomenon was also observed in fluorides.7 With the increasing of calcination temperature, the morphology started to change at 700 °C, which may be due to the phase transformation from hexagonal to monoclinic along with the removal of lattice water. When the sample was calcinated at 800 °C, the morphology of the pure HTMP sample transformed into a smaller particle with diameter around 300 nm. After calcination at 900 °C, the particles became larger polyhedrons with size about 900 nm. X-ray energy-dispersive (EDX) spectroscopy was used to confirm the chemical composition of the obtained samples (Fig. S3, ESI†). In the figure, Ln3+ doped SMPs show the presence of pattern peaks of Yb, Er, Tm and Ho, indicating that the Ln3+ ions are effectively built into the BiPO4 host lattice.

The morphologies and microstructure of the samples were further investigated by TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 5). The typical TEM images of the as-synthesized rice-shaped HP BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ SMPs and the HTMP BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ SMPs obtained at 800 °C are consistent with the SEM images. The HRTEM image (Fig. 5C) in the edge area of an individual HP BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ particle clearly shows that the interlayer spacing is about 0.34 nm, which is close to the distance between the (110) planes of HP BiPO4. The HRTEM image (Fig. 5F) of a single HTMP BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ particle exhibits well-resolved lattice fringes with a plane spacing of 0.46 nm corresponding to the lattice planes of (001) in HTMP BiPO4.

3.2. Upconversion luminescent property
Due to the presence of water molecules in the structure of HP BiPO4:Ln3+·xH2O, the UCL of this form was not observed, which is similar to the previous work on GdPO4.39 After phase transition from hexagonal to monoclinic, the UCL of Ln3+ doped BiPO4 samples can be observed clearly under the excitation of a 980 nm continual wave laser diode. The UCL spectra of Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped BiPO4 SMPs at different calcination temperatures are given in Fig. 6. BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ shows intense green emission at 523 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 544 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and red emission centered at 658 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2). The UCL spectrum of the BiPO4:20% Yb3+/0.5% Tm3+ exhibits three emission bands in both visible and near infrared (NIR) regions which can be assigned to the following 4f–4f transitions of 1G4 → 3H6 (475 nm), 1G4 → 3F4 (648 nm) and 3H4 → 3H6 (792 nm). In the spectrum of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Ho3+, intense red emission centered at 650 nm (5F5 → 5I8) and extremely weak green emission centered at 543 nm (5F4, 5S2 → 5I8) were observed. It is easy to find out that the UCL intensity is increased with elevating the calcination temperature.

To understand the UC mechanism, the pump power density dependent UCL intensity was measured and plotted in a logarithmic diagram (Fig. 7). As is well known, the UCL intensity (I) depends on the pump power density (P), according to the relation I ∝ Pn, where the number of pumping photons (n) required to populate the upper state can be determined from the slope of the UCL intensity versus the pump power density in a double logarithmic plot.54 As illustrated in Fig. 7, the fitted slopes of n values for the green and red UC bands of the Er3+ ion are 2.33 and 1.73, which indicate a two-photon process for the green and red UC emissions in the BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ SMPs. For BiPO4:20% Yb3+/0.5% Tm3+ SMPs, the n values are determined to be 2.69 and 2.67 for blue and red emissions, indicating a three-photon process. For the NIR emission around 792 nm, the two-photon process can be confirmed by the slope of 1.86. The slopes of the plots for green and red emissions of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Ho3+ SMPs are 2.09 and 2.12 corresponding to two-photon UC mechanisms.

The energy level diagrams of the Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ ions and the proposed UC mechanisms are shown in Fig. 8. For BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ SMPs, an Yb3+ ion transits to the 2F5/2 state by absorbing a photon, and then drops back to the ground state while transferring the energy to a nearby Er3+ ion, populating the 4I11/2 level. The 4F7/2 level of Er3+ ions can be populated by a second transferred photon from Yb3+, which non-radiatively relaxes to the green-emitting levels (2H11/2 and 4S3/2). The 4I11/2 level can also decay to the 4I13/2 level non-radiatively and then the 4F9/2 level can be populated after absorption of a transferred photon from Yb3+ ions. The red emission is accomplished by the transition of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+.55,56 The blue and red emissions of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/0.5% Tm3+ SMPs are realized by a three-photon process. The 1G4 level of Tm3+ can be populated by three step energy transfer from Yb3+via two bridge levels of 3F4 and 3H4. The blue red and NIR emissions of Tm3+ can be obtained from the transitions of 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4 and 3H4 → 3H6, respectively. For BiPO4:20% Yb3+/2% Ho3+ SMPs, the green emission is a direct two step UC process and the red emission involves 5I7 as a bridge level which is subsequently pumped to the 5F5 level by an energy transfer process.31

3.3. Tuning of multicolor and bright white UCL
Considering the above UCL spectra, RGB lights have been achieved in Yb3+ and Ho3+/Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped BiPO4 SMPs (Table 2, a–c). Based on the RGB emissions, it was feasible to obtain multicolor emissions, including white emission by appropriately adjusting the concentration of Ho3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ ions. The spectra and photographs of yellow, cyan, purple and white UCL emissions are shown in Fig. 9, which were acquired in samples d–g in Table 2, respectively. The resulting UCL emissions of multicolor and white were converted to the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates which are listed in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 10. The calculated chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of BiPO4:20% Yb3+/1% Er3+/0.5% Tm3+/0.15% Ho3+ are (0.318, 0.356), which fall in the white region (Fig. 10, point g) and are very close to the standard equal energy white light coordinates (0.333, 0.333) according to the 1931 CIE diagram. The multicolor and white light emissions endow this kind of material with potential applications in multiplexing detection and backlight sources.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, rice-shaped Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ doped BiPO4 UC SMPs were synthesized by a simple room-temperature co-precipitation method and subsequent calcination route. Bright UCL can be observed in monoclinic phase under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode. The phase transition, morphology, UC luminescent property and UC mechanism of BiPO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) SMPs were investigated in detail. By suitably controlling the RGB ratio via precisely adjusting the concentration of the lanthanide ions, multicolor and bright white light were obtained under 980 nm laser diode excitation. The chromaticity coordinates of the samples are calculated and drawn in the 1931 CIE diagram and the white UCL falls in the white region. Based on the wide spectroscopic luminescent colors from RGB to white, the BiPO4 based UC SMPs may be a promising candidate for applications in the fields of displays, lasers and detection technology.
