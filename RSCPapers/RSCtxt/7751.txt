    , Accepted 5th September 2016First published on 5th September 2016AbstractPhosphor converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) are an alternative choice for general lighting due to their superior features such as high efficiency, durability and reliability. However, most pc-WLEDs in the market suffer from problems resulting from the lack of red emission, which can be resolved by adding red-emitting phosphors. The currently dominant red-emitting phosphors are Eu2+-doped nitrides, but the requirement of elevated temperature during synthesis makes them costly, and moreover the over broad emission may result in loss of lumen efficiency. Recently, transition metal Mn4+ doped materials showing very narrow red emission have attracted tremendous interest for compositions based on abundant resources and mild production processes, resulting in a highly efficient way to obtain phosphors with favorable luminescence properties. In this work, we describe the recent progress on transition metal Mn4+-doped inorganic luminescent materials, including oxides (subdivision into alkaline-earth germanates, arsenates, aluminates, titanates, pyrosilicates, phosphates, zirconates, gallates, simple oxides and others), fluorides and nitrides. More specifically, the review focuses on Mn4+ activated red-emitting phosphors that can be effectively excited by NUV and blue LED chips. The excitation and emission spectra as well as the preparation process of some representative phosphors are given and discussed. Meanwhile, the merits and drawbacks of several kinds of matrix materials in applications for white LEDs, as well as some problems, development trends and application prospects in this field of Mn4+ doped phosphors are summarized.

1. Introduction
In the past few decades, rapid progress has been made in the fabrication and utilization of light emitting diodes (LEDs), especially white LEDs (WLEDs), which show superior features such as high efficiency, compactness, long operational lifetime, good material stability and environmental friendliness. The major WLEDs presently on the market are phosphor-converted LEDs (pc-LEDs) made of a blue-emitting chip (usually InGaN, the most practical chip with the lowest price) covered with a yellow-emitting phosphor [i.e. (Y,Gd)3(Al,Ga)5O12:Ce3+, abbreviated as YAG:Ce3+].1–4 However, the luminescence of the present WLEDs suffers from problems like cool white light and low colour rendering index (CRI), which result from the lack of red emission. In order to get warm white-light emission together with a high CRI, a red-emitting phosphor needs to be added into the system, where it plays a key role in solid-state lighting for artificial lighting applications. Generally, the phosphors applied in an LED device must fulfill the following main requirements:4 (1) be highly excitable in the UV-blue spectral range; (2) have high quantum efficiency and strong red emission intensity; (3) have high chemical and thermal stability (retaining their luminescence characteristics over long periods at 150 °C). Because of these ambitious prerequisites, designing a red-emitting phosphor according to the appropriate utilization in LEDs remains a major challenge. The main red-emitting phosphors dominating the current market are Eu2+-doped nitrides (Ca,Sr)AlSiN3:Eu2+, which are mostly synthesized by applying temperatures above 1800 °C and a high nitrogen gas pressure. Thus, the demand for a large amount of input energy combined with a scarcity of the nitride phosphor starting material makes them somewhat costly.2,3 In addition, a better compromise between high lumen efficiency and high colour rendering index can be obtained by very narrow red-emitting phosphors.5 It is therefore urgent to develop new red-emitting phosphors for the future WLEDs market.
Transition metal elements, in particular manganese, are widely used in the fabrication of green (divalent) and red (tetravalent and divalent) emitting phosphors. Manganese, an element with a rich oxidation state variation, where valence, local coordination and distribution in the host lattices determine its luminescence properties, is considered as an alternative to rare earth elements for the design of suitable phosphors. The crystal field dependences of the energy levels of transition metal ions are usually described using a Tanabe–Sugano diagram. Fig. 1 shows the Tanabe–Sugano diagram for Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions in octahedral symmetry. The Mn2+ ion, acting as an activator, has an emission consisting of a broad band ranging from green to deep red, the position of which strongly depends on the host lattice. The Mn2+ ion located in tetrahedral coordination with a weak crystal field, usually gives a green emission; while the Mn2+ ion situated in an octahedral symmetry environment with a strong crystal field, usually gives an orange to red emission. According to the Tanabe–Sugano diagram for Mn2+ with a d5 electron configuration (see Fig. 1(a)), the emission can be assigned to the 4T1 → 6A1 transition. Examples of the Mn2+ ion acting as an activator are BaAl12O19:Mn2+,6 ZnS:Mn2+,7 LiZnPO4:Mn2+,8 KAlSi2O6:Mn2+,9 Zn2SiO4:Mn2+.10–14 Zn2SiO4:Mn2+, which emits green light, is associated with the 4T1 → 6A1 transition of Mn2+.10–14 In this phosphor material, the doped Mn2+ is supposed to predominantly substitute at the Zn2+ site with a tetrahedral [MnO4] coordination.
 Fig. 1  The Tanabe–Sugano diagram for (a) the Mn2+ ion with a d5 electron configuration in octahedral symmetry;17 (b) the Mn3+ ion with a d4 electron configuration in octahedral symmetry17 and (c) the Mn4+ ion with a d3 electron configuration in octahedral symmetry.17 
Mn3+ ion seems to be an interesting candidate as an active laser center within this spectral region, on account of its emission covering the entire wavelength region between 550 and 1300 nm.15,16 The crystal field splitting of the Mn3+ energy levels is described by the Tanabe–Sugano diagram according to the d4 electron configuration (see Fig. 1(b)).17 Although a large number of energy levels exist in a d4 electron system, two of them are quintet states, named the 5E ground state and the 5T2 excited state. Many excited-state absorption transitions from the 5T2 into higher lying levels are expected, but all of these transitions are spin-forbidden, i.e., the excited-state absorption cross section is much smaller than the emission cross section of the 5T2 → 5E transition.
All Mn4+-doped materials exhibit both broadband excitation and sharp emission lines due to the distinct electronic structure of Mn4+. The Mn4+ ion belongs to the d3 electron configuration by no accident, the crystal field splitting of the Mn4+ ions energy levels is described by the Tanabe–Sugano diagram in an octahedral symmetry environment (see Fig. 1(c)).17 In an octahedral environment, the Mn-3d states are split into three- and two-fold degenerate t2g and eg states, respectively. The three Mn-3d electrons of Mn4+ exactly fill the majority-spin t2g states. The crystal field splitting creates a large gap between the t2g and eg states, stabilizing the 4+ oxidation state.18 Therefore, Mn4+ ions are usually found on the octahedral sites of solids. In addition, the optical properties of Mn4+ doped materials are strongly influenced by local crystal field environments. For example, the excitation and emission peaks of Mn4+ in oxide hosts usually appear at 300 and 660 nm, respectively. However, when Mn4+ ions are situated in fluoride hosts with octahedral coordination, they exhibit the most intense broadband excitation at 460 nm with a bandwidth of 50 nm and very sharp emission lines peaking at 630 nm as a result of the weaker crystal field for Mn4+ ions. These unique optical properties meet the spectral requirements for an ideal red-emitting phosphor, in addition to rather simple synthetic processes and abundant starting materials, enable Mn4+-doped compounds to be promising candidates as red-emitting phosphors for blue-chip excited warm white LEDs with high luminous efficiency of radiation. Fig. 2 displays the price development of rare earth europium oxide (Eu2O3) and manganese oxide (MnO2) over the years between 2011 and 2015, from which we can observe that the price of the rare earth (Eu) is significantly higher than that of the transition metal (Mn). Although the price of Eu2O3 dropped year by year, it is still many times higher than that of MnO2, with the maximum of about 550 times in 2011. The employment of manganese oxide as an activator raw material will make phosphors cheaper and more practical.

The available literature about different types of Mn4+-doped materials includes: (1) oxides, subdivided into (1.1) alkaline-earth germanates19–39 and arsenates;40–42 (1.2) aluminates;43–90 (1.3) titanates;91–105 (1.4) pyrosilicates;106–112 (1.5) phosphates;113–115 (1.6) zirconates;116,117 (1.7) gallate;118–129 (1.8) simple oxides130–141 and (1.9) other oxides;18,142–149 (2) fluorides150–219 and (3) nitrides,220–224 all of which are summarized in Fig. 3(a). The early research on Mn4+-doped materials was basically focused on germanate systems, until the end of the 20th century. The research emphasis gradually transferred to aluminate systems from 2000. Mn4+ activated fluoride phosphors have attracted considerable interest and became a research hotspot in 2008 due to their potential application as red-emitting phosphors in LED devices. However, the utilization of fluoride phosphors in high-power LEDs is largely impeded by their low stability. Additionally, the Mn4+ emission wavelengths of more chemically stable oxide phosphors are longer than those of fluorides. This is an important trend and can explain the higher 2Eg → 4A2g emission energies of Mn4+ in fluorides than in oxides by recognizing the weaker Mn–ligand hybridization in fluorides.

Fig. 4(a) shows the emission spectra of several commercial phosphors including BaSi2O2N2:Eu2+, (Sr,Ca)2SiO4:Eu2+, (Sr,Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+, and K2TiF6:Mn4+ under 460 nm stimulation, with the corresponding CIE chromaticity coordinates displayed in Fig. 4(b), where the insets are photographs of the corresponding phosphors in daylight. Obviously, the LED device constructed with Mn4+-doped fluorides as red-emitting phosphor combined with blue-emitting chips and oxynitrides blue-green-emitting (or silicates green-emitting) phosphor shows a wide colour gamut as compared to the use of (Sr,Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ as a red-emitting phosphor, which is important for backlighting applications.

The first synthesis of Mn4+-doped luminescent materials was reported in 1947;19 since then the research on this topic has never been interrupted. Especially over the last 10 years, the number of publications in this field has massively increased (see Fig. 3(b)), reflecting their promising capability for optical applications. In order to obtain a better understanding, this review, for the first time, offers a complete overview of more than 200 references published in this field, with highlights of different Mn4+-doped inorganic compounds and their luminescence characteristics.
2. Mn4+-doped phosphors and their luminescence properties
With the same electronic structure (3d3 electron configuration) of the incompletely filled shell as Cr3+,17 the electrons of the Mn4+ ion are located in an outer orbital, due to which its optical properties can be heavily affected by the matrix. The Mn4+ ion with three d electrons has a ground level of 4A2. Thus, the optical absorption will, in good approximation, occur only to the spin-quartet level (2S + 1 = 4) in view of the spin selection rule.225 In other words, the red-emitting wavelengths consisting of several associated vibronic sidebands are highly dependent on the covalency and coordination symmetry of the “Mn4+–ligand” bonding, which is due to the spin-forbidden transition of Mn4+: 2Eg → 4A2g. As a result, the host lattice plays a crucial role in the optical properties of Mn4+-doped compounds.
2.1 Mn4+-doped alkaline-earth germanates and arsenate systems
The first report on Mn4+ activated germanate luminescent materials was dated in 1947.19 This work investigated magnesium oxide in detail with respect to the luminescence efficiency. The phosphor prepared according to the formula 4MgO·GeO2:0.01Mn (Mg4GeO6:Mn4+) has five times higher efficiency than 2MgO·GeO2:0.01Mn (Mg2GeO4:Mn4+), while 3MgO·GeO2:0.01Mn and 5MgO·GeO2:0.01Mn have about 75% of the efficiency of the optimum composition. Subsequently, a typical example of Mn4+ doped germanate phosphors is 3.5MgO·0.5MgF2·GeO2:Mn4+ (Mg28Ge10O48:Mn4+), which was derived by replacing part of MgO in 4MgO·GeO2 with a fluxing agent MgF2. The part substitution of O by F can give significant rise to the sample's luminescence intensity.21 The deep red emission associated with the 2E2 → 4A2 transition in octahedra is attributed to Mn4+. In the Mg28Ge10O48 host lattice, Mg2+ ions occupy octahedral sites, while two-thirds of the Ge4+ ions are tetrahedrally coordinated. Mn4+ ions may enter the Ge4+ or the Mg2+ ion sites. Shamshurin et al.27 suggested that Mn4+ enters the Ge4+ lattice with a similar radius and the same charge, but Blasse226 speculated that Mn4+ ions probably occupy octahedral Mg2+ sites, though Mn4+ has the same ionic radius as Ge4+. The commercialization of 3.5MgO·0.5MgF2·GeO2:Mn4+ red emitting materials was realized in the 1960s. These phosphors have been applied as colour correction phosphors in high pressure Hg lamps, plant growth fluorescent lamps, red light phototherapy equipment, and many energy-saving fluorescent lights.25
Furthermore, Okamoto S.29 found that the emission intensity of 3.5MgO·0.5MgF2·GeO2:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors can be enhanced by adding a certain amount of alkaline earth fluoride instead of MgF2 [(3.5 − x)MgO·0.5MgF2·xAF2·GeO2:Mn4+ (A = Ca, Sr, Mg, Ba)]. The optimal alkaline earth fluoride is SrF2. In this case, the Mg2+ ions occupy the center of the octahedral coordination sites by six oxygen atoms with two different Mg2+–O2− bond distances. And Mn4+ ions were suggested to occupy Mg2+ sites in the center octahedral symmetry. Yuan, et al.38 investigated the effect of adding Al2O3, and observed a blue-shift with the increase of Al2O3 addition. The reason can be attributed to the crystal field strength Dq of the Mg2+ octahedral lattice sites, which could be changed by an Al3+ additive due to the variation of the Mn4+–O2− bond length. According to the Tanabe–Sugano energy diagram of d3 coordination in Fig. 1(c), the excitation energy between the ground state 4A2 and the excited state 4T1–4T2 is strongly related to the crystal field strength, and their relationship can be expressed as: (1)where Dq is the crystal field strength for octahedral symmetry, R is the distance between the central ion and its ligand, Z is the charge or valence of the anion, e is the charge of the electron, and r is the radius of the d-wave function. The increased crystal field strength from shortened Mn4+–O2− bond distance in the six-fold coordination causes the shifts of 4T1 and 4T2 energy levels of Mn4+, resulting in the observed blue-shift of the 4A2–4T1 excitation band. In addition, the same situation was also found in 2MgO·GeO2:Mn4+ and 2MgO·GeO2·MgF2:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors by A. V. Shamshurin.27
Besides, Ba2GeO4:Mn4+,33 Li2MgGeO4:Mn4+,34 LiAlGe2O6:Mn4+,35 LiGdGe2O6:Mn4+,35 Sr2GeO4:Mn4+,36 LiNaGe4O9:Mn4+,39 Li2Ge4O9:Mn4+,39 were also investigated. For LiNaGe4O9:Mn4+,39 the internal quantum yield (QY) is 61%, the emission peaks are located at 660–670 nm in the red region with high colour purity, and the chromaticity coordinates are x = 0.698, y = 0.272, which is close to the border. The optimal nominal composition is 10Li2O–10Na2O–80GeO2–0.1MnO2.
In addition to alkaline-earth germanates and fluorogermanate, arsenates also have been reported in the literature.40–42 For example, magnesium arsenate xMgO·yAs2O5:Mn4+ phosphor was synthesized by Travniçek.40 and different MgO ratios were investigated. According to the results, the 6MgO·As2O5:Mn4+ arsenate has the strongest luminescent efficiency, with a band-like red emission consisting of five narrow peaks at 620 nm, 630 nm, 640 nm, 650 nm and 658 nm, respectively. The structure analysis indicated that the matrix has a composition of Mg8.5As3O16, which is based upon a cubic close-packed oxygen array with charge balance achieved in 6MgO·As2O5 through partial occupancy of a unique Mg site occurring in an As-substituted MgO-type layer.41,42
2.2 Mn4+-doped aluminate system
Aluminates are the most intensively investigated host lattices for Mn4+ ions, among which, CaAl12O19:Mn4+,43,48 is the most reported phosphor. The main reason probably is that this phosphor could exhibit strong red emission under UV and blue excitation, which is suitable for LED applications. Murata T. et al.48 found that CaAl12O19:Mn4+ phosphor can be excited by 400 nm wavelength near UV light excitation, and CaF2 and MgF2 can improve the relative luminescence intensity of CaAl12O19:Mn4+, which should be a consequence of the synergetic effect caused by the flux and charge compensation of CaF2 and MgF2, respectively. CaF2 would accelerate the crystal growth of CaAl12O19:Mn4+ and Mg2+ ions would compensate the local charge balance surrounding Mn4+ ions instead of Mn2+. Moreover, as recently reported, a remarkable enhancement of the luminescence intensity of the CaAl12O19:Mn4+ phosphor has been achieved by composition modification through mixing with MgO,57,58 GeO2,61 and Li+, Na+ and K+ ions.68 However, its counterpart, BaAl12O19:Mn4+,52 does not efficiently emit under UV excitation. The luminescence properties of Ba-containing compounds are related to different co-ordinations of the activator ions, which makes them deviate from other aluminate compounds (i.e. CaAl12O19:Mn4+).
Besides CaAl12O19:Mn4+, other aluminates, e.g., Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+,59 CaAl4O7:Mn4+,60,70 SrAl4O7:Mn4+,88 SrAl2O4:Mn4+,78 CaAl2O4:Mn4+,78 Sr4Al14O25:Mn4+,71,75,79,80,89 CaMg2Al16O27:Mn4+,85 CaYAlO4:Mn4+,86 and SrMgAl10O17:Mn4+,52,77,82 have been also investigated and reported. Table 1 lists a series of Mn4+ doped aluminate phosphors and the corresponding emission peak positions. The quantum efficiency (QE) of Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+ phosphor is about 80%, which is higher than that of the Eu2+-doped nitride red-emitting phosphor Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ (64%) and CaAl12O19:Mn4+ (63%).59Fig. 5(a) shows the photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra of Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+ and CaAl12O19:Mn4+. These excitation spectra suggest that Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+ and CaAl12O19:Mn4+ phosphors can be excited by UV (310–380 nm), near UV (380–420 nm) and blue-emitting (420–480 nm) LED chips. Moreover, a WLED lamp was fabricated by using blended phosphor Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+ and green-emitting phosphor (Sr,Ba)2SiO4:Eu2+ pumped with a 397 nm near UV LED chip (3.8 V, 16 mW). The generated white light has CIE chromaticity coordinates at (x = 0.3314, y = 0.3211), a Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) of 5545 K and a CRI of 62.2. The results indicate that the WLED can be obtained under a 397 nm near UV LED excitation by appropriately tuning the ratio of Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+and (Sr,Ba)2SiO4:Eu2+.59

 Fig. 5  (a) Excitation and emission spectra of CaAl12O19:Mn4+ and Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+ phosphors.59 The inset: photographs of Sr2MgAl22O36:Mn4+ phosphor under daylight lamp (left) and 365 nm UV lamp (right). (b) Excitation and emission spectra of CaAl2O4:Mn4+, CaAl4O7:Mn4+ and SrAl2O4:Mn4+ phosphors.78 The inset: photographs of CaAl2O4:Mn4+ phosphor under a 365 nm UV lamp. 
As for the phosphors CaAl4O7:Mn4+, SrAl2O4:Mn4+ and CaAl2O4:Mn4+, their excitation spectral bands span from 220 to 550 nm, and their emission spectral bands cover from 600 to 720 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(b).78 Red shifts have been found for both excitation and emission spectra due to the increase of the crystal field. In an octahedral field, the crystal field may result in the doublet state showing the lowest energy in the excited state when it is strong enough, which will lead to a red colour luminescence. And their CIE chromaticity coordinates under excitation UV light are (0.718, 0.282), (0.720, 0.280) and (0.718, 0.281), respectively.
For Sr4Al14O25:Mn4+ phosphor, the internal quantum efficiencies turn out to be 38% and 35% for excitation wavelengths at 380 nm and 470 nm, respectively. The Sr4Al14O25:Mn4+ phosphor was dispersed into silicon resin and mixed with YAG:Ce3+, then coated onto blue-emitting InGaN LED chips which were packed by a surface mount technology, the devices are depicted in Fig. 6.89 The emission spectrum of each device is listed at the bottom of each figure accordingly. The CCT, CRI and luminescence efficiency were measured at a distance of 0.316 m under a current of 20 mA and a bias voltage of 5 V. It is quite clear that the lamp with the blue-emitting LED and the Sr4Al14O25:Mn4+ phosphor exhibits a bright pink light and a luminous efficacy of 6.61 lm W−1, (see Fig. 6(b)). With the inclusion of 1.5 g of Sr4Al14O25:Mn4+ phosphor, emission with a warm perception was achieved with CCT = 3846 K, while the efficiency dropped from 126 lm W−1 to 69 lm W−1 (see Fig. 6(c)–(f)).

The emission spectrum of each device is listed at the bottom of each figure accordingly. The CCT, CRI and luminescence efficacy was measured at a distance of 0.316 m under a current of 20 mA and a bias voltage of 5 V.89 
Bo Wang et al.85 reported the luminescence properties of CaMg2Al16O27:Mn4+ (CMA:Mn4+) for a white LED in detail. They incorporated CMA:Mn4+ and YAG:Ce3+ phosphors into a glass host via a “phosphor-in-glass (PiG)” approach, through which warm white-light was achieved in the assembled high powered WLED device; the measured photometric and chromaticity parameters are listed in Table 2.85 Obviously, with increasing CMA:Mn4+ contents, the emission spectra show an almost linear increase in the Mn4+ red emissive component. Accordingly, the appearance of the emitted white light evolves gradually from cool to warm, see Fig. 7.85 It is proposed that the developed CMA:Mn4+ phosphors and the related PiGs would have desirable potential for applications in high powered warm WLEDs.

In addition to the above mentioned aluminates, a novel Ca14Al10Zn6O35:Mn4+81,83,84 phosphor showed emissions in the wavelength range from 650 to 750 nm at room temperature with the maximum value located at 715 nm when excited at 460 nm. In the crystal lattice of Ca14Al10Zn6O35, with a cubic structure with the space group F23, four of the five independent positions that are occupied by Al3+ and Zn2+ are in tetrahedral coordination, and the fifth independent position is in octahedral coordination. In addition, the Ca2+ cation has three different coordination environments. Two of them are six-coordinated in octahedra. The third independent Ca cation is in a seven-coordinated polyhedron. It can be seen that AlO4 and ZnO4 tetrahedra (partial disorder) share vertices to form a three-dimensional framework and additional Al3+ and Ca2+ are in octahedral voids. It is commonly accepted that Mn4+ ions are preferentially accommodated at the Al3+ sites in the lattice with an octahedral coordination. In the field of WLED with warm white light and artificial lighting as well as LED plant growth light, this phosphor has potential application prospect. This is because the application of artificial lighting in plant cultivation usually requires for red light covering the spectral region of 650–750 nm, since the absorbance of chlorophyll is close to maximum under red lights thus plants grown better than those grown under daylight fluorescent lamps.
2.3 Mn4+-doped titanate system
Titanate compounds are well known for their excellent stability and, thus, are considered as a kind of suitable host material for luminescent phosphors such as Ca0.8Zn0.2TiO3:Pr3+,227 Ca2Zn4Ti16O38:Pr3+,228 CaTiO3:Eu3+,229 and Mg2TiO4:Eu3+.230 One remarkable example of an Mn4+-doped titanate is Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ synthesized by a sol–gel route, which efficiently emits red light with a wavelength centered at 655 nm.102 Mg2TiO4 has an inverse spinel structure, in which the Ti ions occupy octahedral sites and the Mg ions occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The ionic radius of Mn4+ for six-coordination is 0.53 Å, close to that of six-coordination Ti4+ (0.605 Å).231 In addition, the same oxidation state indicates that charge compensation is not necessary for the substitution of Mn4+ for Ti4+. Therefore, the substitution of Mn4+ for Ti4+ in Mg2TiO4 is highly feasible. The results of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy investigations confirmed the octahedral coordination and the tetravalent state of the doped Mn ions in the Mg2TiO4 material. Moreover, a decrease in lattice parameter was observed with the increase of Mn4+ content in Mg2TiO4, further confirming the replacement of Ti4+ ions by smaller Mn4+ ions in the host lattice. Fig. 8(a) shows the excitation spectrum of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+.102 The strong excitation band at 475 nm is assigned to the 4A2 → 4T2 transition of the Mn4+ ion, whereas an even stronger broad excitation band at 325 nm arises from the 4A2 → 4T1 transition. Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ shows emissions in the wavelength range between 600 and 775 nm at room temperature with the maximum value located at 655 nm in the visible light region. Fig. 8(b) shows the emission spectra of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ phosphors prepared through sol–gel and solid-state reaction methods under the same excitation at 475 nm. The main peaks from 640 to 680 nm correspond to the 2E2(t23) → 4A2(t23) transition of the Mn4+ ion. Obviously, the emission intensity of the Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ phosphors prepared through the sol–gel route is approximately 1.5 times higher than that of the solid-state reaction methods. Moreover, the photoluminescence performance of the sol–gel Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ sample was also compared with that of the commercial red-emitting phosphor CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ purchased from Intematix. For both Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+, the emission bands peak at approximately 650 nm, and the integrated emission intensity of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ is comparable to that of CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ under the same 460 nm light excitation. However, the measured external quantum efficiency of the sample Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ is around 38.3% and lower than that of the commercial CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ red-emitting phosphor. It is believed that the observed low external quantum efficiency of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ may be further improved by process optimization.

The excitation wavelength is 460 nm.102 
In order to further enhance the emission intensity of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors, Qiu, et al.106 investigated the effect of adding various ions. Their results indicated that the incorporation of Zn2+ and Sn4+ ions can enhance the emission intensity of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+, but not as effectively as the addition of Bi3+ ions. Meanwhile, doping with Li+ ions, which act as charge compensation agents, can further enhance the emission intensity of Mg2TiO4:Mn4+, with the optimal composition of Mg1.990Ti0.999O4:0.001Mn4+,0.005Bi3+,0.005Li+. The as-prepared luminescent ceramic synthesized by pressing the starting powder mixture into pellets followed by calcining, can exhibit a more than 2.5 times increase of the emission intensity as x = 0.8% (see Fig. 9(a)).106 The possible mechanism of the sensitization of the increased blue excitation by the addition of Bi3+ can be ascribed to the following two points: one is the addition of Bi3+ ions to Mg2TiO4:Mn4+, leading to more intensive absorption in both the near ultraviolet and at visible light regions, as shown in Fig. 9(b);106 the other is mainly attributed to the perturbation of the symmetry and lattice vibration due to larger Bi3+ ions (CN = 6, r = 1.03 Å) replacing the smaller Mg2+ (CN = 6, r = 0.72 Å) ions as well as some crystal defects formed during the high temperature process.

Several Mn4+ doped titanates, such as Li2TiO3:Mn4+,91,101 Gd2MgTiO6:Mn4+,94 La2MgTiO6:Mn4+,95 La2ZnTiO6:Mn4+,95 SrTiO3:Mn4+,96 PbTiO3:Mn4+,93 BaTiO3:Mn4+,92,99 BaMg6Ti6O19:Mn4+103 and so on have also been reported in recent years. For instance, Li2TiO3:Mn4+ exhibits emission spectra with narrow and sharp peaks at 680 nm assigned to the 2E → 4A2 transition of Mn4+. The relative luminescence intensity of the Li2TiO3:Mn4+ phosphor compared with that of YAG:Ce3+ (P46) was approximately 70% when excited at 460 nm.101 These results indicate that the Li2TiO3:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor is a promising candidate for white LEDs. For Gd2MgTiO6:Mn4+,94 a sharp zero-phonon line at 681 nm was observed at 10 K, and is assigned to the electronic 2E → 4A2 transition of the Mn4+ ion. In addition, it is reported that a kind of novel red luminescence phosphor Mg2GeO4:Mn4+ can be obtained by Ge4+ ions substituting for the octahedrally coordinated Ti4+ ions in the Mg2TiO4:Mn4+ host matrix.105
2.4 Mn4+-doped pyrosilicate system
For Mn4+-activated pyrosilicates, Esra Öztürk. et al.107–112 have synthesized a series of Mn4+-doped and Gd3+,107 Lu3+,107 Eu3+,108 Yb3+,108 Pr3+,109 Nd3+,109 Tb3+,110 Er3+110 Tm3+,111 Dy3+,111 Sm3+,112 Ho3+,112 co-doped MgAl2Si2O8-based phosphors. The luminescence mechanisms of these phosphors, which showed broad red emission bands in the range of 610–715 nm with different maximum intensities when activated by UV illumination, were discussed. Table 3 shows the decay times, excitation and emission wavelengths of Mn4+-doped and rare earth ion co-doped MgAl2Si2O8-based phosphors. MgAl2Si2O8:Mn4+,Gd3+ and MgAl2Si2O8:Mn4+,Lu3+ are taken as examples to illustrate the luminescence mechanisms. The excitation and emission spectra of Mg0.88Al2Si2O8:0.10Mn4+,0.02Gd3+, the MgAl2Si2O8 host, and MgAl2Si2O8:0.10Mn4+,0.02Lu3+ phosphors are shown in Fig. 10(a)–(c). The strong excitation band with the maximum intensity located at about 258 nm is ascribed to the host lattice absorption. The emission in the wavelength ranging from 600 to 800 nm with the three maxima located at 617, 710 and 720 nm is assigned to the recombination of an electron on a donor with a hole on an acceptor. The recombination is caused by crystal defects which occurred in the un-doped MgAl2Si2O8 during the solid state synthesis. According to Fig. 10,107 it is speculated that the luminescence mechanism of Mn4+, Lu3+ and Gd3+ ion co-doped MgAl2Si2O8-based phosphors can be explained by an energy transfer from the MgAl2Si2O8 host crystal to the Mn4+ and Gd3+ ions, but no energy transfer from the MgAl2Si2O8 host crystal to Lu3+ ions. However, Fig. 10(a) shows that the emission band at 710 nm from the MgAl2Si2O8 host lattice can still be observed in the emission spectrum MgAl2Si2O8:Mn4+,Gd3+. Therefore, the energy transfer from the MgAl2Si2O8 host crystal to Mn4+ and Gd3+ ions is not complete. The energy transfer from the MgAl2Si2O8 host crystal to Pr3+, Sm3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Tm3+, Yb3+, Er3+, is also confirmed, according to the same method. Nevertheless, there is no energy transfer from the MgAl2Si2O8 host crystal to rare earth ions Nd3+, Dy3+, Eu3+.

2.5 Mn4+-doped phosphate, zirconate and gallate systems
Phosphates, zirconates and gallates have also been investigated as suitable host lattices for Mn4+ doped phosphors. Ming, C. et al.114 investigated the behavior of the photoluminescence of Mn4+ doped phosphate glasses (80P2O5–20Li2O). Under 408 nm wavelength light excitation, the luminescence wavelengths of the samples are located in the 600–700 nm range. With increasing Mn4+ ion concentration, the emission peak wavelength red shifts gradually, the emission intensity increases gradually and the luminescence lifetime changes from a few microseconds to one millisecond. According to the fluorescence lifetime analysis, the following conclusions can be obtained: (a) at low Mn4+ ion concentration, the fluorescence comes from the 2T1 → 4A2 transition of Mn4+ ion, whose fluorescence lifetime is several microseconds; (b) at high Mn4+ ion concentration, the emission originates from the 2E → 4A2 transition of Mn4+ ion, whose lifetime is about one millisecond. The sample doped with Mn4+ with a concentration of 2.4 mol% shows the strongest emission intensity. Another Mn4+-doped phosphate α-Zn2P2O7:Mn4+ was also investigated by Gupta, S. K. et al.115 In this work, both Mn2+ and Mn4+ were presented in the α-Zn2P2O7 host. EPR spectroscopy study confirmed the presence of Mn2+ and Mn4+ in 6-coordinated and distorted 5-coordinated Zn2+ sites, respectively. In the emission spectra, two bands were observed: one is green emission with maximum intensity centered at 500 nm, which should be attributed to the 4T1(4G)–6A1(6S) transition of Mn2+; the other is red emission centered at 686 nm, which results from the electronic transition between 2E and 4A2 of Mn4+ accompanied with vibronic transitions. The photoluminescence properties of Mn4+-doped zirconate CaZrO3:Mn4+ were discussed by G. Blasse, et al.116 in 1981. The CaZrO3:Mn4+ shows an efficient red luminescence ranging from 650 to 750 nm with the maximum emission peak located at 690 nm. However, only luminescence spectra at liquid nitrogen temperature were measured.
For gallate-based compounds doped with Mn4+ ions, typical examples are Gd3Ga5O12:Mn4+,119,122–124 ZnGa2O4:Mn4+ and LiGa5O8:Mn4+.120,121,125,127 The luminescence emission spectrum of Gd3Ga5O12:Mn4+ measured at room temperature exhibits characteristic emission bands in the range of 650–700 nm with the maximum value at 682 nm. Earlier studies have indicated that the divalent manganese (Mn2+) ions in the tetrahedral (A) sites of several AB2O4 spinel compounds including ZnGa2O4, MgGa2O4, ZnAl2O4, MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4, behave as an activator for green fluorescence. But in the work of Yu, C. et al.,121 both Mn2+ and Mn4+ were presented in ZnGa2O4 host as shown by their typical emissions under different excited wavelengths. The Mn2+ and Mn4+ ions seated at the tetrahedral (A) sites and octahedral (B) sites, respectively. The red emission spectrum, excited at 325 nm, shows a peak centered at 666 nm. The other is green emission centered at 508 nm. However, the emission intensities of these phosphors are relatively low.
2.6 Mn4+-doped simple oxide and other material systems
Simple oxides can also be utilized as the host lattices for Mn4+ doped phosphors. Sharp emission lines situated at 14866 cm−1 and 14786 cm−1 have been reported for Mn4+-doped α-Al2O3 by Geschwind, S. et al.130 The Mn4+ valence state was stabilized by charge compensation by Mg2+ ions. The main objective of the work of Jovanić, B. R.132 was to explore the effect of high pressure (up to 10 GPa) on the emission spectrum of α-Al2O3:Mn4+. Besides, other Mn4+-doped oxides, for example, MgO,137 TiO2,136,138 and MnO2139 have been reported. However, only the zero-field splitting and the first excited state splitting and EPR parameters of the compound were investigated.
In addition to the above mentioned simple oxide systems, other more complex Mn4+-activated oxide materials systems have attracted attention in recent years, such as Ba2LaNbO6:Mn4+,146 NaLaMgTeO6:Mn4+,147 La2LiTaO6:Mn4+,18 and Mg7Ga2GeO12:Mn4+.149 La2LiTaO6:Mn4+18 shows a broad deep red emission ranging from 670 to 730 nm with the main peak located at 709 nm under the excitation of 495 nm. The novel deep red-emitting Mg7Ga2GeO12:Mn4+149 phosphor shows bright emission in the 600–750 nm region combined with efficient broad excitation at around 420 nm. Mg6.965Ga2GeO12:0.5mol%Mn4+, Mg7Ga1.990GeO12:0.5mol%Mn4+ and Mg7Ga2Ge0.995O12:0.5mol%Mn4+ phosphors have been prepared and their emission spectra were measured. It was found that the Mg7Ga1.990GeO12:0.5 mol%Mn4+ sample, in which the Mn4+ ions are assumed to enter into the Ga3+ sites, shows much higher emission intensity than the other two samples. This result confirms that Mn4+ should replace the Ga3+ site in GaO6 octahedra, leading to efficient deep red emission of Mn4+ ions. The phosphor also displays a good thermal stability (78% of the initial intensity remained at 250 °C) and therefore, Mg7Ga2GeO12:Mn4+ is considered to be a potential red emitting phosphor for application in WLEDs.
2.7 Mn4+-doped fluoride systems
Mn4+-activated fluorides are well known for their excellent luminescence properties and fluorides are considered to be a kind of suitable host lattices for luminescent materials like A2XF6:Mn4+ (A = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; X = Ti, Si, Ge, Zr, Sn).150–219 Especially K2SiF6:Mn4+, Na2SiF6:Mn4+ and K2TiF6:Mn4+, are promising candidates for WLEDs as red-emitting phosphors under blue-chip excitation. Sadao Adachi et al.170 first reported a K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor that was directly synthesized by wet chemical etching of Si wafers in a HF/KMnO4 mixed solution [see Fig. 11(A)]. Shortly afterwards, the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor was directly synthesized by wet chemical etching of crushed quartz schist173 and silica glasses174 in a HF/KMnO4 mixed solution, as schematically shown in Fig. 11(B). The overall chemical reactions can be written as follows: Si + 4KMnO4 + 12HF → K2SiF6 + K2MnF6 + 3MnO2 + 6H2O + 2O2↑(2) SiO2 + 4KMnO4 + 12HF → K2SiF6 + K2MnF6 + 3MnO2 + 6H2O + 3O2↑(3)

Chenxing Liao et al.188 proposed a facile method to prepare the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor (see Fig. 12) and demonstrated its promising application in warm-white LEDs. Fig. 12 schematically shows the synthesis process of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor. In this work, SiO2 powders were used as the Si source to synthesise K2SiF6:Mn4+ through a redox reaction in HF/KMnO4 solution, and H2O2 was used to effectively reduce Mn7+ to Mn4+, which not only dramatically shortens the reaction time but also simplifies the recovery of the product. Table 4 shows the yields of K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors with and without H2O2 for different periods of time.188 The reaction was greatly shortened with the presence of H2O2. The overall chemical reaction can be represented by the equation given below: (2 − 2x)SiO2 + 4KMnO4 + (20 − 4x)HF + (4 − 2x)H2O2 → 2K2Si1−xF6:xMn4+ + (4 − 2x)MnF2 + (14 − 4x)H2O + (7 − 2x)O2↑(4)

In addition, its internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was measured to be 74%, and the authors constructed a warm-white LED device with a high luminous efficiency of about 82 lm W−1 and a high CRI of about 91 at 3510 K using the combination of the YAG:Ce yellow-emitting phosphor and the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor. Table 5 shows the photoelectric parameters of WLEDs with various K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor amounts under a working current of 20 mA.188 Obviously, with the further increase of the red-emitting phosphor amount, the luminous efficacy was reduced due to the relative decrease of the YAG:Ce phosphor content, but was still larger than 80 lm W−1. These prominent optical properties together with its low cost and highly efficient fabrication approach endow the as-synthesized K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors with great potential for commercial applications in warm-white LEDs.

According to the research of Lv L. et al.,195 the emission intensity of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor can be enhanced by using KF as the potassium source rather than KMnO4 to produce K2SiF6 since contamination with manganese oxides from the KMnO4-rich solution can be avoided. Moreover, a warm-white LED (with a CRI of 89.9, and an efficacy of 116 lm W−1 at a of 3390 K) has been obtained by mixing K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors and a YAG:Ce yellow-emitting phosphor on a blue LED chip driven at 20 mA and 3 V. However, there are some reports indicating that the thermal stability and thermal quenching properties of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor were not good.182,183Fig. 13(a)195 shows the thermal stability of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor as investigated by Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The weight remains unchanged up to about 365 °C, but a rapid decrease in weight occurs above this temperature accompanied by a strong endothermic peak which represents the beginning of the decomposition of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ crystal lattice. Fig. 13(b)213 shows the emission intensity of K2SiF6:Mn4+ as a function of the sample temperature. The emission intensity remains constant until about 400 K, which is within the 400–450 K operating temperature of LED chips. But at 450 K, the emission intensity drops to 16% of the initial emission intensity. In addition, heat treatment at 473 K in air of the phosphor powder left the luminescence properties intact, while heat treatment performed at 673 K caused a colour change of the powder from light-yellow to brown and almost entirely destroyed the luminescence, with a remaining quantum efficiency of less than 1%. In order to improve the performance of the phosphor in high power LEDs with elevated operating temperatures, a remote-phosphor approach can be used. By extending the distance between the exciting LED and the phosphor, both thermal quenching and saturation due to the long, ms range, decay time of K2SiF6:Mn4+ can be relieved.

There are two shortcomings based on the preceding preparation methods: the first is the need to use highly aggressive HF as a starting chemical; the other is low product yield because of the wet chemical etching of Si or SiO2 in a HF/KMnO4 mixed solution synthesis approach, thus hindering the improvement of industrial production. Zhu, H et al.200 proposed a general but convenient strategy based on an efficient cation exchange reaction, which had been originally regarded to be only effective in synthesizing nano-sized materials before, for the synthesis of Mn4+-activated fluoride microcrystals such as K2SiF6:Mn4+, Na2SiF6:Mn4+, K2TiF6:Mn4+, NaYF4:Mn4+ and NaGaF4:Mn4+. The preparation was carried out by simply mixing the K2TiF6 host with a small volume of HF solution in which K2MnF6 powders were suspended. K2MnF6 powders were synthesized by Hansbode, H. J.'s method.150 After mixing of the K2TiF6 host with the K2MnF6 suspension, the chemicals were stirred for 20 min to form a muddy mixture, which was dried and then heated at 70 °C for 3 h, yielding the final product of the K2TiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor. The as-synthesized K2TiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor shows an extremely high PL quantum yield (QY) up to 98%, which is superior to those of rare-earth (oxy)nitride red-emitting phosphors such as Ca–a-SiAlON:Eu2+ (QY = 70.5%) and CaAlSiN3:Ce3+(QY = 80%).
As shown in Fig. 14(a), there are three intense excitation bands of K2TiF6:Mn4+ (0.72 at%) in the range of 200–550 nm. The 255, 362 and 468 nm excitation bands originated from the charge transfer between the F− and Mn4+ ions, and spin-allowed 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2 transitions, respectively. More importantly, the spectral overlap between the excitation of K2TiF6:Mn4+ and the emission of YAG:Ce3+ is negligibly small. Hence, serious re-absorption that often occurs between (oxy)nitride red-emitting phosphors and yellow (or green) -emitting phosphors in warm white LEDs can be avoided. The red emission is composed of several sharp lines distributed in the spectral range of 610–650 nm with the strongest peak at 631.5 nm due to the spin-forbidden 2Eg → 4A2 transition. To evaluate the device performance for the synthesized K2TiF6:Mn4+ phosphor, a series of white LEDs with various CCT were fabricated by combining blue-emitting chips (455 nm), yellow-emitting YAG:Ce3+ (YAG04, Intematix) or green-emitting aluminate phosphors (GAL535, Intematix), and K2TiF6:Mn4+ as the red-emitting phosphor.200 Photographs of the as-fabricated LEDs and three lit ones are shown in Fig. 14(b)–(e). The electroluminescence spectra of the three LEDs under 60 mA drive current (Fig. 14(f)) and LED 1 under different drive currents (Fig. 14(g)), indicate the sharp emission lines of Mn4+ in the K2TiF6 phosphor and a more red emitting component for lower CCT (Fig. 14(f)) as well as very small colour fluctuation with increasing drive current (Fig. 14(g)). Important photoelectric parameters for three typical LEDs with different CCT are summarized in Table 6. Obviously, by adding the K2TiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor into the devices, warm white LEDs with CRI > 80 and CCT < 4000 K can be obtained for application in indoor lighting (LEDs 1 and 2, Table 6). Specifically, all the R9 values are positive, which suggest good rendition of the strong red colour. Typically, for LED 3, in which the phosphor blend is composed of green-emitting aluminates and K2TiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors, cool white light (CCT = 5954 K) with an ultrahigh CRI (CRI = 95) can be generated.

2.8 Mn4+-doped nitride systems
For nitride-based compounds doped with Mn4+ ions, one typical example is Mn4+-doped GaN semiconductors, which have been extensively investigated previously because of their scientific importance, technological applications and ferromagnetism.222,223 This system has been reported to be a ferromagnetic semiconductor with a high Curie temperature due to large p–d hybridization and small spin–orbit coupling. The ferromagnetic properties of GaN:Mn depend strongly on the electronic configuration of the Mn4+ ions.223 Mn-doped and Mn–Mg co-doped GaN were grown by metal–organic vapor phase epitaxy.222 Photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopic investigations indicate that a series of sharp emission lines at 1.0 eV (1240 nm) are observed in Mn–Mg co-doped GaN and attributed to the spin-allowed intra d-shell transition 4T2(F)–4T1(F) of Mn4+ ions. According to the Tanabe–Sugano diagram of a d3 ion (Mn4+) in a tetrahedral crystal field (GaN), PLE peaks observed at 1.79 and 2.33 eV, which is a normal characteristic of the intra center transition, are attributed to the spin allowed intra-d-shell transitions from the 4T1(F) ground state to the 4T1(P) and 4A2(F) excited state, respectively. The intra d-shell excitation processes can be explained as follows: when the pump energy is tuned resonantly with one of its excited states, the Mn4+ ion is excited from the ground state to the corresponding excited state; the excited Mn4+ ion subsequently relaxes non-radiatively to the first excited 4T2(F) state before the 4T2(F)–4T1(F) PL transition at 1.0 eV.
3 Outlook and future prospects
This review highlights the development of Mn4+-activated optical materials. Mn4+-doped alkaline aluminates show promise in white LEDs but the weak UV-blue absorption and low efficiency of their luminescence requires further improvement. K2XF6 (X = Si, Ti) -based materials doped with Mn4+ ions, exhibit the most intense excitation band located at around 460 nm and very sharp red emission lines peaking at about 630 nm. However, their thermal stability seems to be a problem and should be further improved; moreover, in the synthesis process, the required toxic HF solution is very harmful to environment. In contrast, oxide compounds show much higher chemical stability with an eco-friendly preparation procedure, but the blue excitation band cannot meet the needs right now.
As described above, in the search for suitable phosphors, significant effort has been made to develop highly efficient LED devices with good colour rendering properties. Fig. 15 gives the developed scheme of phosphors for WLEDs. The insets are photographs of phosphors under irradiation of a day-light lamp. Table 7 shows the colour of the corresponding phosphors under irradiation of a day-light lamp and a 460 nm blue chip. In recent years, several highly luminous white LEDs have been fabricated based on the combination of a blue LED with YAG:Ce3+ (yellow-emitting) or silicate-based phosphors such as (Sr,Ba)2SiO4:Eu2+ (green-, yellow-emitting), and (Sr,Ba)3SiO5:Eu2+ (orange-emitting), but all of them have a low colour-rendering index and strong thermal quenching. Nitride-based red emitting phosphors such as (Sr,Ca)2Si5N8:Eu2+ and (Sr,Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ showing better thermal stability and luminescence intensity than CaS:Eu2+ and (oxy)nitride BaSi2O2N2:Eu2+ blue-green-emitting phosphors have weaker thermal quenching, but they all exhibit rather poor luminescence efficiency. Although K2TiF6:Mn4+ and K2SiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphors have better luminescence efficiency and color purity, their chemical stability is not very good. The combination of the Ga-YAG:Ce3+ yellow-green-emitting phosphor and the K2TiF6:Mn4+ red-emitting phosphor was recently proposed as the optimal mixture for application in ultrahigh CRI (CRI = 95) and high efficiency cool white light (CCT = 5954 K) LEDs. More studies will be performed to illustrate the luminescence mechanism and the distribution of the Mn element in the near future. Briefly, considerable efforts will be devoted to the further improvement of Mn4+-activated phosphors for application in WLEDs, including surface modification by coating and host-lattice modification by ion-doping.
