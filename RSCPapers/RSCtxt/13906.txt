    , Accepted 14th July 2011First published on 29th July 2011AbstractInsoluble CuMePc nanocrystals were incorporated into P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells to increase the carrier mobility and photon harvesting. The P1C1-based (weight ratio of P3HT:CuMePc = 1:1) OPV cell exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with a JSC of 16.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.58 V, FF of 0.56 and PCE of 5.3%.
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are receiving a surge of interest due to the need to develop low-cost, flexible, large-area and renewable energy sources, with their implementation as sub-components in flexible electronic products.1–4 The process of converting light to an electric current in an OPV cell is accomplished by various factors that include the generation and diffusion of excitons followed by exciton dissociation to the collection of free charge carriers at the electrodes. These factors can be improved through many approaches, such as tandem5 and doping technology.6,7 It is of paramount importance to develop stable organic semiconductors exhibiting broad solar spectral coverage to enhance the generation of excitons (ηA) and better charge carrier transport properties. Regioregular poly(3-hexythiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are one of the most promising candidates for realizing practical high power conversion efficiency (PCE) polymer photovoltaic applications.8–10 However, the limited absorption profile of the conducting polymer component, especially as light wavelengths above 600 nm are not usually harvested, reduces the overall device efficiency. Therefore, there is a limitation to the significant improvement of the short-circuit current density (JSC) for P3HT:PCBM solar cells. The incorporation of a photosensitizer in a polymer matrix can enhance the spectral absorption and allow its conversion to current.11–13 However, in most cases, the introduction of a soluble dye has rarely improved, but rather degraded the device performance. This is due to the formation of dye aggregations in blend films, which would reduce the absorption efficiency or the charge mobility of the active layer.14–16 Although incorporating insoluble nanocrystals into the polymer matrix to enhance the performance of thin film transistors (TFTs) and OPVs has been demonstrated,17–19 most of the reports are focused on inorganic/organic hybrids and nanocrystals are incorporated to enhance the carrier mobility of the polymer or to replace the PCBM as the electron acceptor.
Herein, we report the synthesis of insoluble tetramethyl-substituted copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuMePc) nanocrystals and the photovoltaic properties of BHJ ternary solar cells based on P3HT:PCBM incorporated with CuMePc nanocrystals. We employed CuMePc nanocrystals with different weight ratios in P3HT polymer to examine the respective OPV performance. The formation of an organic/organic composite has many advantages, which include energy level matching and a simple solution process technique for device fabrication.
The chemical structures of OPV materials are depicted in Fig. 1a. The synthesis of CuMePc nanocrystals and the fabrication of OPV cells (Fig. 1b) are depicted in the electronic supplementary information (ESI†). The energy level diagram of OPV materials is shown in Fig. 1c. The energy levels of CuMePc were extracted from the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-Vis absorption measurement (Fig. 1S, ESI†). The energy levels of P3HT, PCBM, ITO and Al are taken from the literature.7

Fig. 2S (ESI†) depicts the TEM image and SAED pattern of the CuMePc nanocrystals. The CuMePc nanocrystals revealed a rod-like structure with a length of ∼500–1000 nm and a width of ∼50–100 nm (Fig 2Sa, ESI†). The electron diffraction of CuMePc nanocrystals (Fig. 2Sb, ESI†) showed a single crystal diffraction pattern, in which a reflection equivalent to a d spacing of ∼3.5 Å was observed. This value represents the intermolecular face-to-face π–π stacking interactions of phthalocyanine rings.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of thin film samples of the spin-coated CuMePc nanocrystals, P3HT and P3HT:CuMePc composites are depicted in Fig. 3S (ESI†). The spin-coated film of the CuMePc nanocrystals exhibited two broad absorption peaks at 617 and 708 nm, which is quite different from its solution counterpart. The optical properties of phthalocyanine solids are closely related to the relative orientation and separation of adjacent molecules,20 which are specific to particular crystal structures. The increased splitting of the UV-Vis spectrum for the solid state is derived from the enhanced intermolecular hopping, which is advantageous for applications, such as solar cells. The P3HT film showed the highest absorption peaks at 525 and 554 nm, with a red shoulder at ∼600 nm, which is assigned to the strongest interplane interactions. With an increasing amount of CuMePc nanocrystals in P3HT, the composites showed an increase in the absorption range from 600 to 800 nm. The P1C1 composite film (1:1 weight ratio of P3HT:CuMePc) exhibited a broader absorption (400–800 nm) than that of the pristine P3HT polymer. For the P1C1 composite film, the strong absorption peaks at 600 nm and 708 nm revealed a higher degree of P3HT and CuMePc structure ordering in the composite film, showing a self-organization of P3HT and CuMePc in the blend.
The crystallinity of the CuMePc, P3HT and P3HT:CuMePc composite films was also examined by GIXRD measurement (Fig. 4S, ESI†). The film sample showed one strong diffraction peak, with a 2θ value of 6.30° for CuMePc, corresponding to interplanar distance of 14 Å, which is consistent with the SAED pattern of the CuMePc nanocrystals (Fig. 2Sb, ESI†). This interplanar distance matches the estimated length of a CuMePc molecule, revealing the crystallinity of the spin-coated film. The P3HT film showed a diffraction peak with a 2θ value of 5.30°, indicating that P3HT forms an intraplane structure, with lamellae oriented normal to the substrate. In general, doping of soluble phthalocyanine disturbed the crystallinity of P3HT, even at low concentrations (∼20%).21 All of the P3HT:CuMePc composites with different weight ratios resulted in a different signal intensity at 2θ values of 5.30° and 6.30°, which revealed that both P3HT and CuMePc show intraplane stacking features and a crystalline structure.

Fig. 2 depicts the SEM images of the spin-coated films of the CuMePc and P1C1 composite, respectively. The spin-coated CuMePc film revealed nanorods that are randomly crossed and loosely packed (Fig. 2a). Due to the high viscosity of the P3HT polymer, the composite film exhibited an aligned structure with tightly packed bundles (Fig. 2b). This tightly packed film structure could reduce the trap density, ultimately enhancing the charge transport property.

For photovoltaic application, charge carrier mobility is an important parameter to ensure efficient charge extraction. The charge carrier mobilities of the CuMePc, P3HT and P3HT:CuMePc composites were investigated by bottom-contact TFT structure. The results are shown in Fig. 5S (ESI†). The OTFT devices made from P3HT or aggregated CuMePc nanocrystals film have a hole mobility of 7.3 × 10−3 and 2.9 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Doping 15 wt% of CuMePc nanocrystal into the P3HT lead to a decrease in the mobility (2.2 × 10−3 cm2V−1s−1). Increasing the doping concentration to 25 wt%, the mobility of the P3C1 composite increased to 6.5 × 10−3 cm2V−1s−1, which is still lower than that of the pristine P3HT polymer. This shows that the CuMePc nanocrystals behave like traps or impurities at low doping concentrations. The as-deposited film of the P1C1 composite has the highest hole mobility of up to 2.5 × 10−2 cm2V−1s−1. A further increase in the concentration of CuMePc nanocrystals in the composite film (P1C3) exhibited a low mobility of 1.9 × 10−2 cm2V−1s−1 compared with P1C1. CuPc crystals with an intrinsic mobility higher than 0.1 cm2V−1s−1 have been widely reported.22–24 It is well-known that the charge transport would be likely confined along the π–π stacking direction and stronger π–π interactions lead to a higher mobility.25,26 The nanocrystals of CuMePc exhibited a stronger π–π interaction (3.5 Å, Fig. 2Sb, ESI†) than that of the previously reported CuPc polycrystalline film (3.8 Å)27 and this was found to be similar to that of the reported single crystal nanowire of CuPc (3.4 Å).24 Therefore, we suggest that the CuMePc nanocrystals possess an intrinsic hole mobility that is higher than that of CuPc polycrystalline film (0.02 cm2V−1s−1),27 which could be as high as CuPc single crystal nanowire (0.2 cm2V−1s−1).24UV-Vis and GIXRD measurements have proved that the incorporation of CuMePc nanocrystals in P3HT did not disturb the molecular stacking features of P3HT and CuMePc (Figs 3S and 4S, ESI†). Therefore, the enhanced mobility of the P1C1 composite is attributed to the effect of the reduced density of traps in the P3HT polymer.17 In addition, doping of high carrier mobility CuMePc nanocrystals in P3HT provides tightly packed CuMePc nanocrystals in the composite film (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the incorporation of CuMePc nanocrystals enhanced the hole mobility of the whole composite film with the proper weight ratio.

Fig. 3 shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the as fabricated photovoltaic cells and the data are summarized in Table 1S (ESI†). The higher charge carrier mobility of TFT will enhance the diffusion of excitons to a donor–acceptor (DA) interface and their dissociation at the DA interface and lower the series resistance (Rs: derived from the slope of the J–V characteristic curve at around 1 V under dark conditions,28 Fig. 6S, ESI†) of the photovoltaic cells, eventually leading to a higher JSC and fill factor (FF).4 Under illumination, the standard P3HT-based OPV cell exhibited Rs of 8.3 Ω cm−2, JSC of 10.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.61 V, FF of 0.5 and PCE of 3.2%, which is consistent with a previous report.29 The aggregated CuMePc nanocrystals-based OPV cell exhibited a higher Rs, lower JSC, FF and PCE. The smaller VOC of 0.54 V for the CuMePc nanocrystals-based device can be attributed to the smaller offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor,30 which can be derived from Fig. 1c (0.8 eV for P3HT–PCBM and 0.5 eV for CuMePc–PCBM). After incorporating 25 wt% CuMePc nanocrystals into P3HT, the VOC of the P3C1-based OPV cell decreased to 0.58 V compared to the P3HT based device. The RS increased to 12.9 Ω cm−2 and FF decreased to 0.47, which can be attributed to the low mobility of the P3C1 composite. However, the P3C1 composite-based OPV cell showed a higher JSC (12.1 mA cm−2) than that of the P3HT-based device, which led to a PCE of 3.3%. It is evident that the incorporation of CuMePc nanocrystals increases the photon absorption, leading to more exciton generation of the P3C1 composite. With a further increase in the CuMePc nanocrystals in the composite, the P1C1-based OPV cell exhibited the best photovoltaic performance, with a JSC of 16.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.58 V, FF of 0.56, and PCE of 5.3%. The enhancement in the photovoltaic performance is attributed to the highest carrier mobility of 2.5 × 10−2 cm2V−1s−1 and a broad absorption property of the P1C1 composite (Fig. 3S, ESI†).

In summary, we have studied the role of tetramethyl copper(II) phtholocyanine (CuMePc) nanocrystals in P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells. The most obvious effect of incorporating CuMePc nanocrystals in P3HT is the enhancement of the carrier mobility and photon harvesting. The OPV cell fabricated with a P3HT:CuMePc:PCBM (1:1:2) composite via a solution process exhibited the best photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 5.3%. This enhancement is attributed to the highest mobility and wider range absorption of the visible solar spectrum of the composite.
