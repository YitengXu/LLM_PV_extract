    , Accepted 23rd January 2023First published on 23rd January 2023AbstractThe nanoscale Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4/MnO2 composite was successfully prepared via a two-step method. Firstly, by the preparation of MnO2 nanoparticles through an oxidation-reduction reaction; secondly, by synthesizing Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 using an EDTA-assisted sol–gel method; finally, the two nanoparticles mixed together by hand milling to form the nanocomposite. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using several techniques. The nanocomposite presents a well-developed orthorhombic crystal structure with a Pmn21 space group, although there are small impurities of MnO and Li2SiO3. The BET surface area measurements indicate that all the prepared materials are mesoporous. The effect of nanoscale MnO2 on the electrochemical properties of the Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 nanomaterials was evaluated. The composite (denoted as (LMNS/M2) exhibited a specific capacity of 962.4 C g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1. Furthermore, a hybrid device using this composite as a cathode and commercial activated carbon (AC) as an anode was fabricated to examine the practical aspects of the novel electrode, which conducted a specific energy of 38.1 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 938.4 W kg−1. It preserved a capacity of 84% after 2000 cycles. Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4/MnO2 is a promising candidate for high-efficiency energy storage electrode materials for supercapacitor applications because of its superior performance and ease of preparation. The obtained results confirm the excellent electrochemical performance of the electrode as a promising electrode for energy storage applications.
1. Introduction
Currently, energy-related topics, such as storage and conversion, are receiving a lot of research interest globally.1 Climate change and environmental factors, such as an increase in many forms of pollution, especially from the combustion of fossil fuels by vehicles, which releases CO2, are significant issues.2 Clean and renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and wind power, are intrinsically intermittent. Since these energy sources cannot be activated on demand and may not be available when needed, they must rely on energy storage devices to achieve full-time availability.3 Energy storage is crucial in fulfilling the increasing global energy demand with long-term sustainability for modern electronic devices.4
On the other hand, due to the rapid growth of portable electronic devices and new energy vehicles, there is a severe problem with energy shortage on a global scale.5 The introduction of energy storage technologies that have a high power storage capacity, small form factors, affordable prices, and environmental friendliness is crucial. Energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and rechargeable batteries, have attracted the attention of researchers and engineers striving to promote a clean environment.6 Due to their quick charging and discharging rates, long-term cyclability, and broad working temperature range, supercapacitors (SCs), a late-model energy storage technology, are frequently employed in electric vehicles, smart grid systems, and new energy power production equipment.7 SCs are classified according to their storage mechanism as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or pseudocapacitors, or battery type capacitors, based on their charge storage mechanism. The adsorption of electrolyte ions at the electrode and electrolyte interface accumulates charges in EDLC materials,8 including carbon, graphene, and graphene oxide. Pseudocapacitors and battery-type materials, on the other hand, store the charges by electrochemical faradaic electrochemical reactions.9 Battery-type materials, such as transition metal compounds hydroxides,10 oxides,11 and sulfides,12,13 have better energy capabilities than pseudocapacitive materials due to their high electrochemical conductivity, diverse oxidation states, rapidly reversible electrochemical reactions, and relatively high potential including RuO2,14 MnO2,15 and conductive polymers.16,17
Active components are essential to the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. To fulfill the demands of emerging applications, like electric vehicles, greater attention has recently been paid to the development of SC electrode materials, which is a critical component that dictates the performance of the SCs.5
The advantages of the transition metal silicate compounds, Li2MSiO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni), including their high thermal stability, high capacity (330 mA h g−1), low cost, and non-toxicity, have garnered significant attention in recent years. The Li2MnSiO4 molecule in this silicate family provides the opportunity to produce the largest reversible capacity within a suitable voltage-stability window. However, its applicability is restricted by low intrinsic electronic conductivity and poor cycling stability. Many approaches have been devised to solve these issues, including ion doping, particle size reduction, and carbon coating.18 The crystal lattice of Li2MnSiO4 collapsed as a result of the valence state of the Mn ion changing from +2 to +3 during the charging process and the Mn–O polyhedron changing from a [MnO4] tetrahedron to a [MnO6] octahedron, which caused the discharge capacity of Li2MnSiO4 to fade quickly with an increase in cycle numbers.19
Many studies have also noted that replacing the Mn ion in Li2MnSiO4 with aliovalent ions can increase the unit cell volume of the material by altering its crystalline grains, which enhances its electrochemical performance. For instance, using a sol–gel process, Choi et al. created Li2MnSiO4 nanoparticles doped with various trivalent ions, including Ga3+, Al3+, and Mg2+.20 Although Mn has been replaced with Fe, Mg, Al, Ni, Co, and other elements in Li2MnSiO4 recently, which has somewhat enhanced the electrochemical performance of the material, the structural stability issue with Li2MnSiO4 has not been completely resolved.21 Metal oxide coatings such as MoO2,22 TiO2,23 and V2O5,24 which have been used as coating materials on Li2MnSiO4, show an improvement in the structural stability. Therefore, in our work, we demonstrate how the electrochemical performance of the Li2MnSiO4 nanomaterial can be changed by partially replacing the Mn2+ ion with the Ni2+ ion and coating its surface with MnO2, which serves as a protective layer. We chose MnO2 because of its high theoretical specific capacitance of 1370 F g−1, low cost, environmental compatibility, and abundant availability.25
Based on the above considerations, we aimed to prepare the Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4/MnO2, denoted as (LMNS/M2), nanocomposite material via two steps. The MnO2 nanomaterial was prepared by a redox reaction, and Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 was prepared by an EDTA-assisted sol–gel method. In the final step, the separate materials were mixed by hand milling. Various techniques were used to characterize the nanocomposite and its components. The LMNS/M2 nanocomposite presents a well-developed orthorhombic crystal structure with a Pmn21 space group, although there are small impurities of MnO and Li2SiO3. The BET surface area measurements also indicate that all the prepared materials are mesoporous. In order to assess the actual capability of the LMNS/M2 composite electrode, a hybrid device was constructed, employing commercial AC as the negative electrode. The LMNS/M2 composite electrode acted as a positive electrode and was evaluated in an aqueous 6 M KOH solution. The LMNS/M2 composite electrode has a high specific capacity of 962.4 C g−1 at 2 A g−1. The hybrid device demonstrated excellent cycling stability by maintaining 84% of the original specific capacitance after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, and the coulombic efficiency was elevated from 86.6% before the cycling to approach 96% during the process.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH·H2O, 99%) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Manganese nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, 98%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), anhydrous manganese sulphate (MnSO4), and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O 98%) were obtained from Alfa-Aesar, USA). Tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OCH2CH3)4, TEOS, 98%), absolute ethanol, and ethylenediamine were obtained from Merck. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of materials

2.2.1. Synthesis of MnO2 nanomaterial. 
In brief, 3.55 g of MnSO4 and 1.85 g of KMnO4 were dissolved separately in 100 ml of distilled water. Continuously KMnO4 solution was added dropwise into the MnSO4 solution under continuous stirring at room temperature for 20 h. The dark brown resultant solution was precipitated and washed several times using distilled water and absolute ethanol and was dried at 45 °C for 14 h, then annealed at 400 °C for 6 h. The resultant bright black powder was used for further characterization and was denoted as (M2).


2.2.2. Synthesis of Li2MnSiO4 and Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 nanomaterials. 
Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4, denoted as LMNS, was prepared by an EDTA-assisted sol–gel method followed by calcining in an argon atmosphere. A stoichiometric amount of each chemical was used (the molar ratio of Li:Mn:Ni:Si:EDTA is (2:0.8:0.2:1:4), where EDTA was used as a chelating agent. Firstly, all chemicals were dissolved separately in bi-distilled water. Next, the solutions were mixed together by adding them to a solution of EDTA (the solubility of which was enhanced by adding 10 ml of ethylene diamine). At last, TEOS was added dropwise into the previously mixed solution. Then the temperature was raised slowly to 150 °C. The solution was kept under heating and was magnetically stirred until the gel was formed. The gel was dried at 100 °C then ground with a pestle and agate mortar. Then the product was transferred to a tube furnace and was calcined at 800 °C for 6 h under Ar atmosphere.


2.2.3. Synthesis of Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4/MnO2 nanocomposite. 
To prepare the Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4/MnO2 nanocomposite, denoted as LMNS/M2, a weight ratio of 5:95 was taken from MnO2 and Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 respectively and then mixed by a hand milling technique using an agate mortar and pestle for 30 min, then dried in an oven at 100 °C for one hour.

2.3. Characterization
The crystalline structures of the synthesized M2, LMNS, and LMNS/M2 were monitored using X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a high-resolution PAN analytical diffractometer. The scans were recorded by employing Cu Kα radiation at a voltage of 40 kV in 2θ angles from 10° to 80°. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were evaluated via a single beam Thermo scientific Nicolet10 instrument. The measurements were recorded within the 4000-400 cm−1 region. The surface morphology and elemental mapping analysis were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss) operated at 5 kV connected with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-1400). The surface area and pore size diameter were determined using the N2 adsorption isotherm technique measured at 77 K by a conventional volumetric apparatus (Quantachrome NOVA automated).
2.4. Supercapacitor electrode measurements

Three-electrode measurements. 
A three-electrode configuration was employed to explore the electrochemical aspects of the as-prepared composite electrode using it as a working electrode (WE), a platinum wire was used as a counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. A 6 M KOH solution was employed as the electrolyte where the WE was left for about 3 h to properly ensure penetration of the electrolyte ions into the pathways of the electrode material. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were surveyed utilizing an electrochemical testing station (Voltalab 40 PGZ 301, Radiometer Analytical, France) at room temperature.


Preparation of the hybrid device. 
For assembling a hybrid device (LMNS/M2 electrode//AC), the LMNS/M2 composite electrode acted as a positive electrode, and the activated carbon (AC) electrode was a negative electrode during the hybrid cell processing. Hence, the required weight of the negative electrode was controlled during its preparation through a drop-casting method. The following mass balance equation was utilized to calculate the required mass of the negative electrode. (1)where m+ and m− are the masses (g) of the positive and negative electrodes, Cs+ is the capacity of the positive electrode, Csp− are the specific capacitances of the negative electrodes, and ΔV– are the potential windows of the negative electrodes. Using the as-prepared electrode, filter paper as a separator, and 6 M KOH solution as an electrolyte, the full cell was assembled and was kept at room temperature for 24 h until complete saturation of the electrodes and the separator by the electrolyte solutions. Then the exact measurements were performed as in the case of the three-electrode configuration.


Calculations. 
For both the three-electrode system and the two-electrode system, the specific capacity (C g−1) and specific capacitance can be calculated from the GCD data using the following equations:-26,27 (2) (3)where (I) is the applied current (A), (m) is the electrode weight (g), (dt) is the discharging time (s), (V) is the applied potential window (V), and  is the integral area of voltage vs. discharge time of the corresponding GCD discharge curve.
Also, the capacity can be calculated from the CV curves using the following equation:-28 (4)where (I) is the response current (A), (m) is the electrode weight (g), (dV) is the applied potential window, u is the scan rate (V s−1), and  is the integral area of the current vs. voltage of the corresponding CV curves.
For a two-electrode system, the specific power (Pd) and specific energy (Ed) can be calculated using the following equations, respectively.29,30 (5) (6)

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials
The crystallinity studies were conducted by XRD (Fig. 1). The XRD pattern of the M2 powdered sample demonstrates peaks at 2θ of 28.8°, 37.5°, 43.1°, 56.8°, and 65.0°, corresponding to the (110), (101), (111), (211), and (002) planes, which are indexed to tetragonal β- MnO2 (JCPDS card No 24-0735) with the space group P42/mnm (136) in a primitive lattice. The diffraction pattern exhibits characteristic peaks having a tetragonal phase of β- MnO2 with lattice constants a = 4.3743 Å and c = 2.8573 Å, which are in good agreement with the reported data (a = 4.3999 Å and c = 2.8739 Å).31 The broad diffraction peaks may be due to the nanosized effects on the products. The calculated average crystallite size was 16.8 nm using Scherrer's formula. D = Kλ/βcosθ(7)where K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, β is the full-width half maxima, and θ is Bragg's angle.5
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns for the M2 and LMNS nanomaterials, and the LMNS/M2 nanocomposite, respectively, with some impurity Li2SiO3 (*) and MnO (♦). 
In the XRD pattern of the LMNS material at a 2θ range of 10°–80°, the sharp peaks, which were positioned at 2θ values of 16.47°, 24.31°, 28.22°, 33.02°, 36.14°, 37.66°, 46.73°, 47.93°, 49.47°, 58.66°, 59.19°, and 65.71°, matching to the (010), (110), (011), (210), (002), (202), (221), (212), (400), (230), (213), and (230) planes, indicate the good crystallinity of the synthesized material with an orthorhombic Pmn21 phase structure (JCPDS card No 01-057-7861).32 Some impurities, such as Li2SiO3 and MnO, were observed. These impurities are often reported to coexist with the Li2MnSiO4 due to the preparation of pure-phase Li2MnSiO4 being very challenging18
Despite the extensive polymorphism of Li2MnSiO4, orthorhombic Pmn21 is the most frequently observed. Li-ion transfer inside the host material will be quick due to the lower migration energy barrier and symmetrical equivalency of the Li sites in the unit cell, especially in the case of materials with nano-dimensions. These findings are consistent with the literature.33 The average crystallite size for all prepared materials was calculated from the Bragg peak using Scherrer's formula, shown in Table 1.

The diffraction pattern of the LMNS/M2 composite is the same as that of the LMNS nanomaterial, shown in Fig. 1, indicating that the existence of MnO2 nanoparticles has not affected the crystal structure of Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4. The diffraction pattern of the MnO2 nanoparticles does not appear in the pattern of the nanocomposites, which may be because the diffraction intensity of the nanoscale MnO2 with a concentration of 5.0 wt% is too low compared with the intensity of the composite.24

Fig. 2 displays the FTIR spectrum of the M2 nanomaterials, where the Mn-O–Mn and Mn–O bonds can be attributed to the absorption peaks at 510 cm−1, 450 cm−1, and 670 cm−1. The Mn–O stretching mode in the MnO2 nanomaterial was assigned to the high absorption peak at 670 cm−1.34 For LMNS, the Li–O bending vibration of the LiO4 tetrahedra corresponds to the characteristic vibrational peak at 420 cm−1. The Si–O bending vibrations are represented by the vibrational peaks at the 480–590 cm−1 band, whereas the stretching vibrations of the Si–O bonds in the SiO4 tetrahedra are represented by the vibrational peaks at the 860–927 cm−1 band.35 The peaks above 1000 cm−1 may suggest the presence of an impure phase in the material formed. All these frequency bands are marked in the figure for easy identification. A Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 powder sample may indicate the presence of impurity phases; the presence of carbon can be noticed from the C–O vibrational modes near the wavenumber value of 1500 cm−1. The use of a muffle furnace might be the reason behind the presence of some carbon content. As for the spectrum, LMNS/M2 exhibits the same spectrum as LMNS. There is no peak observed for MnO2 in the spectrum of the nanocomposites; this may be due to the small quantity of MnO2 (5%) compared to LMNS.

Fig. 3a shows SEM images of the M2 sample, demonstrating the successful fabrication of nanorod crystals with homogeneous lengths (2–3 μm) and widths (30–50 nm).36Fig. 3b shows SEM images of the LMNS nanomaterial. The sample powder comprises aggregated nanoparticles and has a more homogenous particle distribution. The major particle diameter of LMNS ranges from 15 to 30 nm.37Fig. 3c shows the SEM image of the LMNS/M2 nanocomposite mixed from the constituent materials accompanied by a significant decrease in the particle size,37 showing that the MnO2 nanorods are distributed on the surface of the particles of LMNS. The small particle size would be beneficial to the permeation of the electrolyte between the particles and to reduce the diffusion length of the ions in the solid phase, which results in fast reaction and diffusion kinetics and improves the electrochemical properties of the material, especially the electrochemical properties during charging and discharging.38

In Fig. 4, EDS was utilized to determine the elemental composition of the nanoparticles, as evidenced by the study. The findings of the EDS analysis (Fig. 4a) show that the weight percentage of Mn is 52.52% and O is 47.48%, and made up the majority of the nano-MnO2 sample, which was extremely near to the theoretical Mn:O = 55:32 ratio.36 It is clear that there is no other peak related to any impurity has been detected in the EDS.39Fig. 4b and c shows the EDS spectrum of the LMNS and LMNS/M2 nanoparticles, respectively. All expected elements in all investigated nanomaterials were observed, as shown in Table 2.

The morphological features of the M2, LMNS, and LMNS/M2 samples were explored by TEM and are displayed in Fig. 5. MnO2 crystals can reach lengths of up to several micrometers, as seen in Fig. 5a. They are composed primarily of aggregated rod-like structures with minor amounts of spherical particles as seen in high magnification Fig. 5d. According to a closer look, these nanorods have a diameter of 8.5 nm.40 This result is in good agreement with the XRD and SEM results. Fig. 5b and e displays a TEM image at low and high magnification for LMNS; the sample was made up of numerous different types of nanoparticles that range in size from 40 to 100 nm, showing clear signs of aggregation.41 The TEM images shown in Fig. 5c and f show low and high magnification of LMNS/M2, the average sizes of LMNS/M2 nanoparticles in the composite are about 20 nm and show that nanorod crystals of MnO2 are dispersed on the surface of LMNS, indicating a successful preparation of the nanocomposite and the introduction of MnO2 to the LMNS will enhance a decreasing of the particle size. These results agree with the XRD and SEM data discussed before.

To test the surface area of the investigated samples, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were taken, and the result obtained is displayed in Fig. 6. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of M2 is illustrated in Fig. 6a. According to the IUPC classification, the hysteresis loop of M2 is a typical type IV isotherm, indicating the existence of a mesoporous structure. The BET surface area of the sample is 70.745 m2 g−1, which is significantly more than the earlier report.42 As shown by BJH analysis (inset in Fig. 6a), two peaks can be seen in the pore size distributions of the material at 2.40 nm and 35.23 nm, respectively. It has been shown that the mesoporous feature could significantly increase the accessibility of the material to electrolyte ions and the diffusion of electrons by offering a reliable transport path and additional adsorption sites inside the sample. Fig. 6b and c illustrate the adsorption and desorption isotherms of LMNS and the LMNS/M2 nanocomposite, which appear as a typical IV-type curve with a hysteresis loop in the range of 0.6–1.0 P/P0.35 The results obtained were summarized in Table 1, showing that the specific surface area of the studied samples increases in the order: LMNS/M2 > LMNS > M2. The increasing BET is probably due to the smaller particle size, whereas the pore size diameter increases according to M2> LMNS/M2 > LMNS. It can be concluded that the LMNS/M2 nanocomposite possesses a high specific surface area and a large pore diameter. Due to shorter electronic and ion diffusion distances during electrochemical testing, porous materials with many mesopores, high specific surface area, and numerous pores typically perform better electrochemically.13

3.2. Electrochemical performance
According to the material studies and analyses that were done, it is anticipated that the prepared LMNS/M2 composite will have remarkable electrochemical properties because it integrates the effects of the MnO2 nano-rods, which are evenly distributed on the LMNS to enhance their properties and gain from the storage ability and stability, in addition to its structure. The easy passage of ions in the electrochemical pathway is caused by the nanostructure as rods, which is expected to give the low electrochemical resistance of LMNS. In addition, high porosity is predicted based on the BET data, which is predicted to increase their electrochemical behavior. As a result, we will investigate it and assess if using it as an active component in the supercapacitor electrode is advantageous.
To thoroughly understand the viability of combining the two materials and their impact on each other's electrochemical properties, we will first examine the LMNS/M2 composite and its components individually at the beginning of this study. To assess the electrochemical performance of the composite and the conductivity improvement, this investigation will start with a three-electrode setup and a 6 M KOH solution. The LMNS/M2 composite showed a higher current than its components using CV measurements at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at a potential window from −0.7 to 0.6 V vs. SCE, as Shown in Fig. 7a. Due to the nanorod structure, it is also recognized that the MnO2 electrode has a higher performance than the LMNS electrode. The redox couple within the CV curves results from overlapping the redox peaks of the different metallic components within the composite, such as Mn and Ni.
 Fig. 7  (a) CV curves at a scan rate 100 mV s−1. (b) GCD curves at current density 2 A g−1 for the LMNS/M2, MnO2, and LMNS electrodes, (c) GCD curves at different current densities for the LMNS/M2 electrode, and (d) specific capacity as a function of the current density for the LMNS/M2, MnO2, and LMNS electrodes. 
As expected, Fig. 7b reveals the GCD results for the three electrodes at a current density of 2 A g−1 in a potential window from −0.7 to 0.37 V vs. SCE, which is highly consistent with the CV results, where the LMNS/M2 composite exhibits a specific capacity of 962.4 C g−1. At the same time, the MnO2 electrode has a capacity of 320.4 C g−1, and LMNS shows a specific capacity of 184 C g−1. This performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two materials. Fig. 7c reveals the GCD curves at different current densities for the LMNS/M2 composite; the specific capacity at different current densities calculated based on the GCD curves of the LMNS/M2, MnO2, and LMNS electrodes were calculated and are listed in Table 3 and are plotted in Fig. 7d, ensuring the efficiency of combining the MnO2 and LMNS to gain the mutual benefit of the two materials.

For further investigation of the two individual components of the composite, Fig. 8a and b demonstrate CV curves at different scan rates and GCD curves at different current densities for the LMNS electrodes, respectively. Also, Fig. 8c and d shows CV curves at different scan rates and GCD curves at different current densities for MnO2. The CV and GCD curves of all electrodes demonstrate the battery-type behavior of the tested materials.

The electrochemical characteristics of the LMNS/M2 electrode were then thoroughly investigated. The oxidation and reduction peaks corresponding to the redox reaction are clearly visible on the MnO2 and LMNS electrode CV curves in Fig. 9a at varied scan rates between 100 and 20 mV s−1. Both redox peaks drifted away from the center with the increase in sweep rate, and the oxidation peaks in the CV curves had a somewhat larger current than the reduction peaks. The polarizing of the electrodes and the quasi-reversible faradaic reactions are responsible for this phenomenon,43,44

(d) Plot of 1/q vs. v1/2, (e) plot of q vs. v−1/2. (f) Bar graph of surface and non-surface contributions at different scan rates of the LMNS/M2 electrode. 
The linear relationship between peak current density (I) and scan rate illustrated in Fig. 8b supports the claim made by the Randles–Sevcik equation that the LMNS/M2 composite electrode behaves like a battery-type electrode.
Using the equation by Dunn et al.,45 which can be condensed to the notation i (V) = avb, the linear relationship between log(I) and log(v) is shown in Fig. 9c, where the b value for the cathodic current and anodic current, respectively, was calculated to be 0.55 and 0.57. These values, which indicate that the process is diffusion-controlled and demonstrate the battery-like electrochemical activity of the electrode, are close to 0.5.
The method outlined by Trasatti et al.,46,47 was used to analyze the surface and non-surface current responses to the total charge stored (Qtotal) within the LMNS/M2 composite electrode. If the scan rate is low enough, the plot of 1/q vs. v−1/2 can determine the total charge. The outer charge (Qouter), which is depicted by the intercept of the 1/q vs. v1/2 plot, is the charge stored (q) at an infinite scan rate. Fig. 9d and e demonstrates that the electrode has a 360 C g−1 overall capacity and an outer charge of 164 C g−1. According to this performance, the non-diffusion-controlled response dominates by 45.5% of the total charge, which is consistent with earlier findings for a diffusion-controlled electrochemical reaction. Using the outer charge and specific capacity at various scan rates (Table 4), it was found that diffusion-controlled faradaic processes made a significant contribution in each case (Fig. 9f). Due to the scan rate-dependent behavior, the portion of capacity from a diffusion-controlled process steadily dropped with a rising scan rate. An identical process was reported in the additional investigations48,49

A hybrid device was constructed, employing commercial AC as the negative electrode, and was evaluated in an aqueous 6 M KOH solution in order to assess the actual capability of the LMNS/M2 composite electrode. The charge was balanced between both electrodes using the mass balance equation (eqn (1)). The voltage window of the device attained 1.6 V to avoid oxygen evolution. Fig. 10a illustrates the CV curves of the hybrid device for sweep rates between 200 mV s−1 and 25 mV s−1, demonstrating the remarkable reversibility of the device. Additionally, it illustrates the beneficial interaction between the battery-like LMNS/M2 composite and the AC electrode, which serves as an EDLC material. Also, the device shows remarkable results in the GCD tests. Fig. 10b presents GCD curves within a voltage window of 1.6 V at different current densities ranging from 1 to 5 A g−1. Fig. 10c illustrates the capacitance retention of the electrode at these current densities, which is an acceptable behavior.

Notably, the hybrid device demonstrated excellent cycling stability by maintaining 84% of the original specific capacitance after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The coulombic efficiency was elevated from 86.6% before the cycling to approach 96% during the process (Fig. 10d).
As seen in the EIS data before and after cycling, Fig. 10e, the value of the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the hybrid device is somewhat higher after 2000 charge/discharge cycles (13 Ω to 25 Ω), which is in line with the capacitance loss of the device of 16% at that point. The equivalent circuit with the fitted data is demonstrated in Fig. 10f. The R1 element represents the ESR, and R2 signifies the charge transfer resistance, which is related to the charge transfer process between the electrode and electrolyte. The CFE indicates the constant phase element, which is used in a model in place of a capacitor to compensate for non-homogeneity in the system. W0 denotes the Warburg diffusion resistance that appeared in the low-frequency region.
The energy, power, and capacitance at each current density are presented in Table 5 based on the GCD data. The Ragone plot in Fig. 10g displays energy and power densities, where the hybrid device may hold an impressive position as a supercapacitor device.

Additionally, the low-frequency portion of the straight line following the 2000 charge/discharge cycles exhibits a considerably shorter vertical line than it did before the 2000 charge/discharge cycles, reflecting a slight rise in the ion diffusion resistance. Accordingly, since it is the first time of reporting the application of Li2Mn0.8Ni0.2SiO4 on supercapacitor electrodes, we compared it with the results of Li2Mn0.96Zn0.04SiO4 and Li2MnSiO4, and its composites (Table 6). This comparison demonstrates the superiority of our obtained results compared to the related published works.

4. Conclusions
Nanocomposite LMNS/M2 was synthesized in the present work via two steps, firstly by preparation of pure LMNS via a sol–gel method followed by the synthesis of M2. XRD analysis confirmed that M2 was crystallized in a tetragonal β-MnO2 phase, and LMNS and LMNS/M2 have an excellent crystallinity of the synthesized material with an orthorhombic Pmn21 phase structure. The morphology of the particles was seen in the SEM and TEM images, which showed that nanorod crystals of MnO2 are dispersed on the surface of LMNS, indicating successful preparation of the nanocomposite. The introduction of MnO2 to the LMNS enhanced a decreasing of the particle size. In addition, high porosity was found based on the BET data, which led to an increase in the electrochemical behavior. The LMNS/M2 nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacity of 962.4 C g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. Furthermore, a hybrid device using this composite as a cathode and commercial AC as an anode was fabricated to examine the practical aspects of the novel electrode, which conducted a specific energy of 38.1 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 938.4 W kg−1. It preserved a capacity of 84% after 2000 cycles. These results confirm the superior electrochemical performance of the electrode as a promising electrode for energy storage applications.
