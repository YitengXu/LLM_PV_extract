    , Accepted 20th April 2018First published on 20th April 2018AbstractA series of g-C3N4-based visible light active photocatalysts was prepared by using melamine as a precursor and MgO as a dopant. The composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the degradation of 4-nitrophenol and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in aqueous media under a low-power visible LED light source. The composites oxidized benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes with better selectivity and conversion efficiency in mild acidic conditions (pH 5–6) than in neutral conditions. When compared to pure g-C3N4, the as-synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 composites showed about five-fold enhancement in photocatalytic activity. EPR spectroscopy results revealed identical EPR signals from both g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 composites, thus confirming the presence of unpaired electrons with C2p character. Introduction of MgO into g-C3N4 resulted in an increased number of electrons trapped in the C2p states of g-C3N4, which manifested as an enhancement in the EPR signal intensity. The difference in the light and dark EPR spectral signal intensities verified the efficient charge separation in the as-synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts. Moreover, the double integral values of the visible and dark EPR spectral signal difference intensities matched well with the 4-nitrophenol degradation rate constants. This further confirms the importance of trapped electrons in C2p states responsible for the observed higher photocatalytic activities. Radical scavenging experiments evidenced electrons as the dominant active species responsible for 4-nitrophenol degradation, whereas both electrons and holes were observed to participate in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Furthermore, the scavenging experiments ruled out the possibility of either hydroxyl or singlet oxygen radicals influencing the rate of oxidation. This study demonstrates MgO/g-C3N4 as a viable photoactive material for applications related to environmental pollution abatement. The photoactive nature of the catalysts in aqueous media under a low-power visible LED light source further signifies their economic and ecological aspects, which can be exploited for other applications as well.
Introduction
Photocatalysis is a facsimile procedure of natural photosynthesis wherein semiconductors are used as photoactive materials for various applications, viz. purification of water and air, hydrogen evolution, solar cells, anti-bacterial and self-cleaning materials, and synthesis of fine chemicals. Many such visible light active photocatalysts explored so far include metal, non-metal and sensitizer modified inorganic and polymeric semiconductors.1 g-C3N4 is a two-dimensional (2D) polymeric semiconductor, which has widely been used as a visible light active photocatalyst towards degradation of waste and toxic products for environmental pollution abatement purposes, selective organic transformations, and production of renewable energy either by water splitting or by CO2-to-fuel conversion.2 However, both the low surface area and the fast recombination rates of the photogenerated charge carriers greatly hinder the photocatalytic activity of pristine g-C3N4. In order to minimize the recombination rate of the charge carriers, g-C3N4 has been doped with metals, non-metals and sensitizers.3 The real purpose is to create a heterojunction which can reduce the recombination rate of the charge carriers and transport them across the interfaces.3 Such kinds of heterojunctions have been formed by introducing many semiconducting materials, viz. TiO2, NiO, ZnO, SiO2 and Al2O3, onto g-C3N4 supports.4a–e With the advancements in many low-dimensional carbonaceous materials, viz. graphene, carbon nanotubes, transition metal chalcogenides and carbon dots, efforts have been made to exploit many of their unique physical properties to produce hybrid g-C3N4 with similar applications towards water splitting and efficient fuel conversion from CO2.5 The availability of free electrons in metals and localized surface plasmons in noble metals assists the modified g-C3N4 to exploit visible light assisted plasmon induced hot electron transfer to alter its charge carrier pathways. However, expensive noble metals created a hindrance towards large-scale production of noble metal modified g-C3N4 catalysts. In an attempt to overcome the high cost of the noble metal co-catalysts, a low-cost noble metal free approach led to the use of transition metal phosphides (TMPs), viz. Ni2P, Ni12P5, and Co2P, as cocatalysts to modify g-C3N4.6–8
Of recent interest is the use of alkaline metal oxides to dope g-C3N4 to create hybrid materials to achieve the same desired properties, i.e., to enhance the rate of photocatalytic activities. The introduction of alkaline metal oxides, e.g. CaO into TiO2 and g-C3N4, has resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activities with applications towards dye-sensitized solar cells and CO2 sorbents.9a–d However, studies related to alkaline metal oxide doped g-C3N4 are either scant or scarce and as such demand both their applications and underlying mechanisms to be extensively explored as well. In this study, we have chosen MgO, one such alkaline metal oxide, to dope g-C3N4 to create a set of hybrid catalysts. We have explored their photocatalytic properties and the underlying mechanisms as well. We show that introduction of MgO enhances the separation of charge carriers in MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalysts, thereby acting as an excellent photoactive material towards the degradation of 4-nitrophenol which is a stable toxic chemical often found in several pesticides, dyes and drugs. This chemical has been categorized as hazardous, affecting the human liver, kidneys and the central nervous system.10a Recently, g-C3N4-based hybrid catalysts have been employed to degrade various toxic chemicals, namely, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, polybromo diphenyl ethers, 4-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol.10b–e Few studies have reported on the partial degradation of 4-nitrophenol by using strong acid modified g-C3N4, In2O3/g-C3N4 and rGO-doped g-C3N4. No complete degradation was achieved even at a low concentration of 4-nitrophenol (<10 ppm).10f–h
As another example, we selected benzyl alcohol as a model system for its oxidation to benzaldehydes over MgO/g-C3N4 composites. Aldehydes are important in many respects, particularly in fine chemical synthesis, agricultural products and pharmaceutical drugs. Normal aldehyde synthesis methods include the conventional oxidation of alcohols using permanganate, dichromate, H2O2, and MnO2. One of the disadvantages of such a method is the use of these toxic, corrosive and oxidizing agents which are expensive and liberate heavy metals as side products. To make this process more eco-friendly, molecular oxygen is sometimes used as an oxidant. More recently, by using mpg-C3N4, CdS/g-C3N4, Ru–g-C3N4 and BiVO4/g-C3N4 catalysts, researchers have demonstrated benzyl alcohol conversion to benzaldehydes.11a–g However, the use of expensive organic solvents, toxic metals and abnormal reaction conditions demands the need of more eco-friendly catalyst systems.
As we shall show in this study, MgO/g-C3N4 photocatalysts help overcome many of the as-stated demerits of the conventional methods of 4-nitrophenol degradation. In a set of experiments, we synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 composites using a simple mixing and calcination procedure by using melamine as a precursor. Compared to pure g-C3N4, the MgO/g-C3N4 composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with both good conversion efficiency and selectivity. We followed a greener route by using molecular oxygen, water and visible light using an LED light source. Furthermore, we illustrated the exact role of MgO/g-C3N4 composites in such environmentally friendly chemical reactions. By using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we unravelled the working mechanisms behind the photoactive nature of the MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid catalysts. We also performed radical scavenging and EPR spin trapping experiments to know the exact nature of the active species present in the as-synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid catalysts.
Results and discussion
XRD, TGA, UV-vis DRS, BET, and FT-IR results
The XRD patterns of g-C3N4 as well as MgO/g-C3N4 composites synthesized by thermal polycondensation of melamine are illustrated in Fig. 1. The characteristic peaks associated with g-C3N4 and MgO can be identified. Diffraction peaks at 36.93°, 42.90° and 62.25° are attributed to MgO contribution. The strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 27.5° corresponds to the (002) plane, which is usually ascribed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems as in graphitic material.12a The peak at 2θ = 12.9° is attributed to the (100) plane, related to the in-plane tri-s-triazine structural building units of g-C3N4.12a The intensity of the (100) peak is too weak in MgO/g-C3N4 (1:3) and MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) composite samples, so we tried to analyse the (100) peak appearing in MgO/g-C3N4 (1:7) and MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10) composite samples. The calculated in-plane spacing, that is, the hole-to-hole distance in the two-dimensional periodic network of the as-synthesized pristine g-C3N4, is 6.87 Å. This in-plane lattice constant varies from 6.71 to 7.1 Å.12b,c As can be seen, the introduction of an alkaline metal oxide (MgO) on g-C3N4 creates an impact on the interplanar structure of the catalyst samples at high nitride contents. Upon immobilization with MgO, the peak at 12.9° becomes wider and shifts to lower 2θ values with increasing MgO content. The (100) peak shifts from 6.87 Å in pristine g-C3N4 to 7.01 Å in the MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10) catalyst. This indicates an increase in the distance between the repeating tri-s-triazine units with the introduction of MgO. Significantly, the (002) peak corresponding to the interlayer spacing also shifts from 27.51° in pristine g-C3N4 to 27.36° in the MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10) catalyst, corresponding to an increase in the interlayer stacking distance from 3.24 to 3.26 Å. This feature is an indication of the disturbance of the graphitic structure due to the introduction of MgO on g-C3N4. Such changes in the interlayer stacking distance have been reported on oxygen-doped g-C3N4 and are observed to influence the band gap energy of g-C3N4.12c,d We also observe the change in band gap energy values (from 2.72 eV to 2.68 eV) upon introduction of MgO. Such experimental evidence suggests the dependence of band gap energies on the layer separation in g-C3N4, which is a topic of immense interest in tuning the band gap of g-C3N4 by structural means.12c

TGA measurements performed on MgO/g-C3N4 (1:3), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:7) and MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10) composites provided MgO concentration values in the as-synthesized composites, which were 49%, 36.7%, 17.6% and 15.5%, respectively (Fig. S1†). The optical absorbance of g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 composites with different g-C3N4 loading amounts was measured using UV-vis DRS. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the sharp absorption edge of g-C3N4 occurs at around 458 nm which is due to the excitation of electrons from the valence to the conduction band. This corresponds to its band gap energy value at around 2.72 eV.12a Upon introduction of MgO, the absorption edge displayed little change in the MgO/g-C3N4 composites. The band gap energy values calculated thus varied from 2.72 to 2.68 eV in the MgO/g-C3N4 composites. As mentioned earlier, such changes in band gap energy values result from the variation in the g-C3N4 interlayer stacking distance.12c Both g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 composites exhibited type IV adsorption isotherms which is characteristic of mesoporous structures according to the IUPAC classification.13 The specific surface areas (BET) of the composites were calculated to be 20.7, 11.3, 11.5 and 10.3 m2 g−1 for MgO/g-C3N4 (1:3), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:7) and MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10), respectively, which are higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (7.5 m2 g−1) (Fig. S2†). Such low changes in specific surface areas thus cannot account for the observed enhanced photocatalytic activities of MgO/g-C3N4 composites.

The FT-IR spectra (Fig. S3†) of g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 composites exhibit a broad peak at ∼3192 cm−1, corresponding to the –N–H stretching vibrations present in primary and secondary amines.14a The peak at 2160 cm−1 is due to the cyano group (–CN) or cumulative double bond groups (–NCN–) present in g-C3N4. With an increase in MgO concentration, this peak both increases in intensity and shifts towards higher wavenumbers (2167–2187 cm−1). A series of bands in the range of 1600–1200 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching mode of aromatic CN heterocycles. The bands at around 808.1–806.1 cm−1 relate to the characteristic breathing mode of CN heterocycles of triazine units.14b Both the peaks at 2160 and 806 cm−1 are sensitive to the changes in the external chemical environment of g-C3N4, which is also consistent with earlier published reports.14c
XPS results
XPS analyses were performed on the g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 composites to reveal the surface chemical properties and oxidation state. The C1s spectrum exhibits two characteristic peaks at 284.8 eV and 288 eV, corresponding to C–C and C–N–C, respectively, in both g-C3N4 and the MgO/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 3A). The N1s spectrum in both g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 composites can be deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 398.4, 400.1, 401.4, and 404.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 3B). The peak at 398.4 eV indicates the formation of the sp2 hybridized aromatic nitrogen in C–N–C. The peak at 400.1 eV corresponds to the sp3 hybridized tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3, whereas the peak at 401.4 eV represents amino functional groups (C–N–H) present in the composites. The weak peak at 404.2 eV is due to the π electrons delocalized in g-C3N4 heterocyclic units.15a,b The Mg1s photoelectron peak in MgO/g-C3N4 composites occurs at 1304 eV, which is normally observed in doping or alloy formation with MgO.15c–e It can be observed that with an increase in g-C3N4 concentration, the Mg1s peak shows a positive shift (∼0.2 eV) towards the higher binding energy side (Fig. 3C).

This positive shift evidences the interaction with g-C3N4 during calcination. This is also well observed in the O1s spectra. The O1s spectra can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 531, 532 and 533.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 3D). The peaks at 531 and 533.4 eV, separated apart by ∼2.4 eV, are the characteristic peaks for MgO surfaces.15f,g The peak at 532 eV is normally attributed to N–C–O, presumably due to calcination in air with g-C3N4.15b
Photoluminescence studies
Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy measurements were performed in order to understand the recombination behaviour of the photogenerated charge carriers. The PL spectra of g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid composites are depicted in Fig. S5.† Emission spectra were recorded in the range between 400 and 600 nm under the excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The PL intensity of the MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid composites were observed to vary with g-C3N4 concentration. It is well-known that the recombination of electron–hole pairs within the semiconductor can emit energy in the form of PL emission.16 In general, a lower PL intensity indicates lower recombination of charge carriers and thus could lead to higher photocatalytic activities.16 g-C3N4 exhibits a strong emission peak at around 460 nm, which is consistent with the UV-vis results in Fig. 2 and with literature reported values as well.12a g-C3N4 shows the highest PL intensity, followed by MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:7), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) and MgO/g-C3N4 (1:3), respectively. This shows the g-C3N4 concentration dependent behaviour of PL intensity in the MgO/g-C3N4 composites. The degree of structural imperfection could also induce non-radiative recombination.
Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis
The electronic band structure of the semiconductor and the photogenerated charge carriers dictates the photocatalytic performance of the composite materials. EPR is a sensitive technique to investigate the role of unpaired electrons and holes participating in photocatalytic activities. We performed room temperature X-band EPR measurements on the as-synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts, both in the presence and in the absence of visible light illumination. Fig. 4A shows the X-band EPR spectra of the samples recorded in the dark. In all cases, an isotropic single-line EPR spectrum near g = 2.0034 with a symmetric Lorentzian shape could be observed. This corresponds to the π-state unpaired electrons present in g-C3N4 with a dominant C2p character.17 MgO exhibits a typical manganese sextet originating from the traces of Mn2+ ions in the bulk (denoted by * in Fig. 4A). The characteristic Mn2+ peaks can still be observed in all MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts. Enhancement in the EPR signal intensity was observed for both pure g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts upon exposure to external light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) for five minutes. This is due to the generation of photoexcited electrons upon absorption of incident photons, which thus verifies the photoactive nature of the MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts. Fig. 4B shows the EPR difference spectra of g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts acquired upon light illumination and in the dark, respectively. The EPR inactive nature of MgO originates due to its wide band gap (∼7.8 eV) and thereby lack of any unpaired electrons. g-C3N4, on the other hand, displays an isotropic EPR signal with its intensity becoming enhanced upon exposure to light illumination. This characteristic signal did not show any changes, either in position or in lineshape, in MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts. This suggests that the photoexcited electrons are trapped in the C2p states of g-C3N4. The magnitude of the EPR signal intensity enhancement under visible light irradiation followed the order MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) > MgO/g-C3N4 (1:7) > MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10) > MgO/g-C3N4 (1:3) > g-C3N4. This result confirms the charge separation process in MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid composites upon visible light illumination, thereby leading to higher photocatalytic activities.

Summarizing, XRD results reveal the presence of both MgO and g-C3N4 in the hybrid composites, with MgO disturbing the interlayer stacking structure of g-C3N4. TGA yields the exact concentration values of MgO and g-C3N4 in the composites. UV-vis-DRS measurements demonstrated small changes in the band gap energy (2.72–2.68 eV) in the composites, which could be due to the change in the interlayer stacking distances. XPS measurements showed a positive upshift (∼0.2 eV) in the Mg 1s binding energy position with the increase in g-C3N4 contents, thus indicating the presence of a chemical interaction. It further unveiled the chemical states and functional groups associated with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen present in the MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts. The sensitive nature of the g-C3N4 cyano functional groups and CN heterocyclic units to changes in MgO contents evidenced further the chemical interaction between MgO and g-C3N4 in the hybrid catalysts. More importantly, EPR showed the enhanced charge separation process in the MgO/g-C3N4 composites.
Photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol
The photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts was evaluated by the extent of 4-nitrophenol degradation under sunlight irradiation. Controlled experiments carried out in the absence of the catalyst material yielded negligible degradation rates. This result confirms the very stable nature of 4-nitrophenol under sunlight irradiation. However, in the presence of MgO/g-C3N4 composites, degradation of 4-nitrophenol was observed under sunlight irradiation. This evidences the photoactive nature of MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid composites. The degradation rates varied with varied composition in MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts. For instance, MgO/g-C3N4 (1:3), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5), MgO/g-C3N4 (1:7) and MgO/g-C3N4 (1:10) yielded degradation rates of 69%, 99%, 96%, and 81%, respectively. In contrast, g-C3N4 yielded a degradation rate of 70% only. Furthermore, some specific composition ratios yielded better degradation rates than others. In particular, the MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) composite exhibited higher photocatalytic activities. The degradation rates of 4-nitrophenol over MgO/g-C3N4 composites were well fitted into pseudo first-order kinetics: −ln(C/C0) = kt, where k is the kinetic rate constant.

Fig. 5A depicts the kinetic rate constants of MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) and g-C3N4 towards degradation of 4-nitrophenol under sunlight irradiation. MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) exhibited a relatively five times higher kinetic rate constant (0.0287 min−1) over g-C3N4 (0.00578 min−1). Compared to earlier reports, the MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) catalyst showed a significantly higher performance towards 4-nitrophenol degradation and significantly under sunlight irradiation with 100 mg (MgO/g-C3N4 or g-C3N4) composite and 100 ml of 4-nitrophenol solution (20 ppm). The active species generated during the photodegradation of 4-nitrophenol over MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts were revealed by electron and hole trapping experiments. EDTA-2Na and AgNO3 were used as the hole (h+) and electron (e−) scavengers, respectively. Addition of 0.1 mM EDTA (hole scavenger) reduced the degradation rate from 99% to 70.5% (Table 1, entry 2). On the other hand, the degradation rate of 4-nitrophenol was highly suppressed from 99% to 11.2% upon the addition of 0.1 mM AgNO3, thus demonstrating e− to be the major reactive species towards the degradation of 4-nitrophenol (Table 1, entry 3). The recyclability of MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts was also tested. Fig. S6† shows the recyclability of MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) towards photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol. Based on the experimental data, the catalyst was stable up to two runs and was observed to lose 10% activity in the third run.

Mechanism behind 4-nitrophenol degradation by MgO/g-C3N4
Based on the experimental results (Fig. 4B and 5B), a mechanism behind the enhanced photocatalytic degradation ability of MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts can be proposed. g-C3N4 is the light-harvesting component of the MgO/g-C3N4 composite. EPR data indicated that visible light generated unpaired electrons remain trapped in the C2p state of g-C3N4 and give no evidence for electron transfer from g-C3N4 to MgO. Thus, the usual mechanism proposed for the enhanced photoactivities in type II heterostructures, wherein relative band alignment stimulates directional charge carrier transfer across interfaces, depressing recombination rate, is not applicable to the case of MgO/g-C3N4. Instead, a working model that is consistent with the experimental evidence invokes the use of C2p states of g-C3N4 as the source for charge carrier self-trapping following photoexcitation. Integration of MgO on g-C3N4 would enhance the C2p character in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital near MgO, as revealed by DFT computation on the CaO/g-C3N4 composite. Persistent storage of photogenerated electrons into these traps would lead to spatial separation of electrons and holes and consequently the enhanced C2p EPR signals for MgO incorporated g-C3N4 (Fig. 4B). A time-resolved EPR tracking experiment (Fig. S7†) supports this self-trapping mechanism for enhanced charge carrier separation, which showed that more electrons survived on MgO/g-C3N4 than on g-C3N4 after the illuminating light was turned off. Two possible explanations are suggested over the MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) catalyst, which shows the highest EPR signal and degradation rate among all catalysts. The first explanation is that while MgO helps g-C3N4 to self-trap the photogenerated electrons in the C2p state, excessive MgO also undesirably prevents light from reaching the g-C3N4 component for photoexcitation. The second explanation comes from an earlier reported DFT study on CaO/g-C3N4,9a which suggests that incorporation of MgO on g-C3N4 would also disrupt the N2p π-conjugation of g-C3N4. As a result, the efficacy of photogenerated exciton dissociation is limited because the orbital overlap for electron transfer between N2p in the valence band and C2p in the conduction band is reduced. A delicate balance between favorable increases in C2p and unfavorable decreases in N2p or a light shielding effect, which occur concurrently upon MgO incorporation, must be maintained for optimal performance of the catalyst. We believe that this synergistic effect also plays a key role in the performance of other heterostructured g-C3N4.
Significantly, the photocatalytic degradation rate patterns of MgO/g-C3N4 composites at different g-C3N4 ratios accord well with their corresponding EPR double-integrated light minus dark signal intensities (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the main driving force of the 4-nitrophenol degradation is the photoexcited electrons trapped in the C2p state of g-C3N4, which is further confirmed by radical trapping measurements (Table 1). The photocatalytic degradation rates of MB using MgO/g-C3N4 composites also followed the same trend (Fig. S8†). EPR spin-trapping with DMPO demonstrates that the dominant radical photogenerated on MgO/g-C3N4 (1:5) is the superoxide anion radical (Fig. S9†). On the basis of these data and an earlier report,18 the mechanism for electron initiated photodegradation of 4-nitrophenol is outlined in Scheme 1. The photodegradation of 4-nitrophenol with hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals produces hydroquinone and benzoquinone which further undergo subsequent oxidation processes to produce intermediates like 3-hydroxy-hexa-2,4-dienedioic acid, 4-hydroxy-pent-2-enedioic acid, and tartaric acid. These intermediates will finally be oxidized into CO2.

In the next set of experiments, we used MgO/g-C3N4 composites to oxidize benzyl alcohol in an aqueous medium. Table 2 shows a comparison of the selectivity and conversion rates of the catalysts towards benzyl alcohol oxidation carried out in both acidic and neutral media. The reaction did not occur either in the absence of light or in the absence of MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts (Table 2, entry 1). Upon exposure to visible light, benzyl alcohol oxidized to form benzaldehyde, albeit with a low conversion efficiency and poor selectivity (pH 7; Table 2, entries 2–6). All the catalysts were tried and compared to check their optimum conversion and selectivity rates. It was observed that both the conversion and the selectivity rates were lower in neutral medium than in mild acidic medium (pH 5–6; Table 2, entries 2–6). This might be due to the formation of Mg(OH)2 in neutral medium. Composites were observed to enhance the conversion efficiency by ∼3 times in acidic medium than in neutral aqueous medium. Similarly, the selectivity rate increased by two-fold in acidic medium (Table 2, entry 4). It is pertinent to mention that both the conversion efficiency and the selectivity rates reported in this study are on a par with or better than many previous reported values (Table 3). Use of a low-power visible LED source, molecular O2 as an oxidant, and water as a solvent to carry out such selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol furthers its advantages of being facile and economical. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of MgO/g-C3N4 composites towards such selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol could be due to the synergistic contribution from both MgO and g-C3N4 and efficient charge carrier separation. In addition to benzyl alcohol oxidation, MgO/g-C3N4composites also showed high conversion rates in the selective oxidation of substituted benzylic alcohols (Table 3, entries 9 and 10).

The conversion rates of formation of benzaldehydes from benzyl alcohol in the presence of various scavengers are tabulated in Table 4. Addition of AgNO3 (1 mM) and p-BQ (1 mM) as electron and superoxide anion radical scavengers, respectively, decreased the conversion rate from 72% to 35.7% and 50.4%, respectively (Table 4, entries 2 and 3). In addition, the presence of AO (1 mM) as a hole scavenger also decreased the conversion rate from 72% to 41.5% (Table 4, entry 5). These indicate that both electrons (e−) and holes (h+) participate in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Addition of t-BuOH (1 mM) and NaN3 (1 mM) as hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen scavenger, respectively, did not show any appreciable influence in the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (Table 4, entries 6 and 7).

Based on the role of the scavengers, the mechanism for benzyl alcohol oxidation by heterogeneous MgO/g-C3N4 composites can be due to e−/−O2˙ initiated O–H cleavage (case I) and h+ initiated C–H cleavage (case II). In case I, O2 traps the photogenerated electrons and forms superoxide radical anion (−O2˙). The superoxide radical anion then abstracts a proton from benzyl alcohol to form an alkoxide anion and a peroxide radical (HOO˙). The hole reacts with the alkoxide anion to form alkoxide radical. Finally, the alkoxide radical reacts with HOO˙ to form benzaldehyde and H2O2 (case I, Scheme 2). In case II, the hole abstracts a hydrogen atom from benzylic C–H to form carbon radical and proton. Photogenerated electrons react with O2 to form superoxide radical anion (−O2˙). This superoxide radical anion abstracts a proton from the O–H of carbon radical to form benzaldehyde and HOO−. HOO− reacts with h+ to form H2O2 (Scheme 2). This mechanism is consistent with previously reported results.11f

Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 composites with variable g-C3N4 concentrations. The as-synthesized composites were characterized by various analytical tools, viz. XRD, XPS, FT-IR, UV-vis DRS, TGA, N2-BET and EPR. The as-synthesized composites showed superior photocatalytic activities towards selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and degradation of 4-nitrophenol. The mechanisms behind such enhanced photocatalytic activities were revealed by EPR spectroscopy analysis and radical scavenging experiments, respectively. MgO promotes the separation of charge carriers efficiently by trapping the photogenerated electrons in the C2p states of g-C3N4, thus suppressing the rate of recombination of the charge carriers. This was well evidenced by EPR vis−dark spectral analysis. EPR analyses were corroborated further by the double integral of their signal intensities, which accorded well with the rate constants. Thus, the creation of more trapping sites in the C2p states in MgO/g-C3N4 composites was responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol and methylene blue dye. Experiments also revealed that holes, electrons and superoxide anion radicals were responsible for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In all cases, it was observed that MgO in combination with g-C3N4 always yielded better conversion rates and photocatalytic efficiencies compared to pure g-C3N4. Both the yield and the conversion rates toward benzyl alcohol oxidation and 4-nitrophenol degradation reported in this study are higher than those in previous reports. The use of a low-power LED source and the mild reaction conditions in this study signify the facile and environmentally benign nature of MgO/g-C3N4 composites. This approach could generate new avenues for novel photocatalytic materials and applications.
Experimental
Synthesis of g-C3N4 and MgO/g-C3N4 hybrid composites
Polycondensation of melamine was employed to obtain pristine g-C3N4. Typically, melamine (5 g) was placed in a semi-closed crucible and calcined at 520 °C for 6 h at a selected temperature ramp of 4 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace. The resulting samples exhibited a yellowish appearance. The samples were then ground into powder to obtain g-C3N4. Synthesis of MgO/g-C3N4 composites was performed using a similar calcination process as described here. First, MgO (0.25 g) was mixed with 3, 5, 7 and 10 equivalents of melamine (0.75, 1.25, 1.75 and 2.5 g) to obtain the composites. The composites were then placed in a semi-closed crucible and calcined in air at 520 °C for 4 h. The temperature ramp selected was 4 °C min−1. The samples were collected, ground and labelled as MgO/g-C3N4 (1, 3, 1:5, 1:7 and 1:10).
Photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol
Photocatalytic activities were evaluated by the decomposition of 4-nitrophenol under sunlight irradiation in the month of June from 11 AM to 2 PM. MgO/g-C3N4 (100 mg) was added to 4-nitrophenol (100 mL, 20 mg L−1) in an aqueous solution with an adjusted pH of 3–4. The solution was stirred in the dark for 30 min to attain an adsorption–desorption equilibrium condition. At regular time intervals, 3 mL aliquots were sampled and centrifuged. The filtrates were analysed by recording the maximum absorption peak (318 nm for 4-nitrophenol) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The apparent rate constants were deduced from the ln(C/C0) versus reaction time plots by linear fitting. The active species generated during photocatalysis were detected by using trapping agents, viz. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) and silver nitrate (AgNO3). To further evaluate the stability of the as-synthesized catalysts, the catalysts were recycled and reused three times to check the photocatalytic degradation rates under the same reaction conditions. After each photocatalytic reaction, the solution was centrifuged to recycle the catalyst materials. The used catalysts were washed with DI water and ethanol and finally dried at 100 °C for subsequent tests. Though the composites were stable and did not dissolve during photocatalysis, loss of the original amount was inevitable during the recycling process. Therefore, the relative ratios between pollutants and composites were carefully calibrated during every test.
Photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA)
Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol experiments were carried out in an aqueous solution. MgO/g-C3N4 (30 mg) was dispersed in 30 ml aqueous solution containing 1 mM benzyl alcohol. The solution was sonicated for 1 min and stirred in the dark for 30 min to attain an adsorption–desorption equilibrium condition. Then the solution was exposed to a visible light source employing an LED lamp (irrad. power 15 mW cm−2, λmax ∼550 nm) for 24 h under continuous stirring under ambient conditions. Samples were withdrawn, centrifuged and filtered using a 0.45 μm PVDF filter and subsequently injected into a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The conversion and selectivity rates were analysed from the HPLC spectra. The presence of the active species was detected by using silver nitrate (AgNO3), ammonium oxalate (AO), sodium azide (NaN3), tert-butanol (t-BuOH) and p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) as electron, hole, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radical scavengers, respectively. The concentration of the radical scavengers was 1 mM in all cases.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction measurements were performed in a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer employing CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Diffuse reflectance spectra of the catalyst samples were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as an internal standard. The absorption spectra of methylene blue (MB) and 4-nitrophenol solutions were recorded on a Shimadzu (UV-2550) UV-visible spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Kα system employing monochromatic AlKα radiation and a charge neutralizer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded at 325 nm using a Perkin Elmer LS 45 fluorescence spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed using a TGA Q50 V20.13 Build 39 instrument, from room temperature to 900 °C under ambient conditions. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized MgO/g-C3N4 catalysts were taken with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One spectrometer in the wavenumber range 400–4000 cm−1. The samples for the FT-IR studies were prepared by using the usual KBr pellet preparation technique. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption (BET) analysis of all the composites was performed using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1 analyzer at 77 K.
EPR spectra at X-band were acquired using a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with a Bruker TE102 cavity. The microwave frequency was measured using a Hewlett-Packard 5246 L electronic counter. Double integration of the experimental EPR spectra was done on the C2p electron signal. An Oriel 1000 W xenon lamp (λmean ∼550 nm) was used as an external light irradiation source during EPR measurements. Samples were irradiated for 5–10 min by guiding the light beam from the source to the EPR TE102 cavity through an optical fiber. The concentrations of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde were determined from high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis using a Waters 2070 instrument equipped with an auto sampler, a solvent delivery pump (600), an X-bridge reverse column C18 5 μm (4.6 mm × 250 mm) and employing a diode array detector (2489). An isocratic method was set in the temperature-controlled program. The analyses were performed on the sample mobile phase volume ratio of 90:10 (acetonitrile (ACN):water (H2O)). The flow rate was 1 mL min−1 run for ten minutes.
