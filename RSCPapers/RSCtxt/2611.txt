    , Accepted 21st September 2017First published on 21st September 2017AbstractAmong the variety of approaches, such as current density–voltage (J–V) measurements with different voltage scan directions and rates, steady-state efficiency measurements, and maximum power point tracking (MPPT), MPPT is the most reliable method for characterizing the efficiency of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells with strong hysteretic behavior. However, MPPT based on the commonly used simple perturb-and-observe (P&O) algorithm can still significantly underestimate the true maximum power point if the hysteresis is severe and a relatively small dwell time at each bias step is used. Here, we present a predictive P&O algorithm to model the current data which allows the prediction of the steady-state current density for each bias set point. As a result, our predictive MPPT speeds up the tracking process and measures the true maximum power point, regardless of the degree of hysteresis, suggesting a useful approach for characterizing the performance of hysteretic solar cells.
Introduction
Over the past seven years, metal halide perovskites (ABX3: A = Cs or 1+ organic ions, B = Sn, Pb and X = I, Br, Cl) have gained much attention from the photovoltaic community. Methylammonium lead tri-iodide (CH3NH3PbI3)-based perovskite absorbers, in particular, have led the way to the rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 to over 22% in 2016.1–14 The astonishing increase in laboratory efficiency of these devices is mainly due to the superior photovoltaic properties of the metal halide perovskite absorbers, such as a high optical absorption coefficient,15 long carrier diffusion length,16,17 unique defect tolerance,18,19 and ease of fabrication by low-temperature solution processes.6–13,20–26
Despite the rapid increase in PCE, perovskite solar cells are still facing challenges, one of which is the notorious current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis, which refers to the differences found in J–V sweeps based on scan speed, scan direction, step size, dwell time, beginning bias, and amount of light on the device and impedance of the sourcemeter before starting the scan.27–31 Before perovskite solar cells were widely studied, the issue of hysteresis was more or less unknown by the photovoltaic community. Only small degrees of J–V hysteresis have been reported in other solar cell types (e.g. cadmium telluride, amorphous silicon, copper indium gallium selenide) in literature.32–35 Though the exact mechanisms causing the J–V hysteresis are still under debate, it is now generally accepted that interface trap states, ion migration, and interface capacitance are the possible causes.36–39
Because of the hysteretic behavior, the J–V measurements, that have been commonly used to characterize the performance and PCE of solar cells, are now no longer capable to always provide reliable and accurate characterization of the PCE of hysteretic organic–inorganic metal halide solar cells. As mentioned previously, the results can greatly depend on the scan conditions. Some reported PCEs extracted from J–V measurements in literature may have significantly overestimated the performance. Up to now, three approaches have been proposed and used to avoid reporting artificial PCEs for perovskite solar cells: (1) J–V measurements with various voltage scan directions, rates and dwell times;27,29,40 (2) steady-state efficiency (SSE);41–48 and (3) maximum power point tracking (MPPT).37,49–52 These approaches have been widely accepted and used by the perovskite solar cell community thus far.
In this paper, we show that these three widely used methods can still lead to PCEs that are not representative of the true maximum power point (MPP) of hysteretic perovskite solar cells if inappropriate procedures or parameters are used. We further report a predictive perturb-and-observe (P&O) algorithm to avoid potential issues of the conventional MPPT method. The algorithm enables the prediction of the steady-state current density instead of determining it by holding the bias and waiting for quasi-steady-state conditions. Therefore, the predictive MPPT is capable of speeding up the tracking process while measuring the true MPPT, regardless of the degree of hysteresis. This approach can also measure the true MPP even with solar cells experiencing degradation caused by illumination and/or ambient conditions. Additionally, the predictive MPPT requires no specific parameters, simplifying the measurement procedure. Our predictive MPPT approach can be used to effectively track the true MPP of all solar cells, and offers particular advantages for perovskite solar cells with severe hysteresis.
Experimental
Perovskite thin film preparation
The perovskite thin films were deposited using a similar one-step process described in our earlier work.23,24,26,37,40 Lead iodide (PbI2, Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, Dyesol), formamidinium iodide (FAI, Dyesol), lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) were purchased and used without further purification. The perovskite precursor was prepared using a Lewis acid–base adduct approach with the mixture of MAI, FAI, PbI2, DMSO, and Pb(SCN)2 in DMF, where the molar ratio of DMSO and PbI2 is 1:1. A 45% by weight precursor solution of MAPbI3 was prepared with PbI2, MAI and DMSO (molar ratio = 1:1:1) in DMF. A 3% Pb(SCN)2 with respect to the weight of PbI2 is also added in the solution, which was then stirred for 12 hours on a 60 °C hot plate before deposition. The FAPbI3 precursor solution was made in the same process. The MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 precursor was prepared by mixing the two different solutions with the molar ratio of MAI and FAI to be 7:3. The as-resulted precursor solution was stirred for one hour on a 60 °C hotplate and then purified using a 0.45 μm filter before use. The perovskite precursor solutions were spin-coated on the substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s with 750 μL diethyl ether (Alfa Aesar, 99%) dripped simultaneously during the spinning. The as-deposited film was annealed at 65 °C for 2 min and then 100 °C for 10 min. The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a perovskite film is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Solar cell fabrication
The perovskite solar cells were fabricated with a regular device structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/C60-SAM/MA0.7FA0.3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au as shown by the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S2, ESI†). FTO glass (Pilkington, NSG TEC-15) was used as the substrates. C60-SAM is a fullerene self-assembled monolayer and serves as an interface passivation layer. MA is CH3NH3 and FA is HC(NH2)2. Spiro-OMeTAD is 2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-bis(p-methoxy-phenyl)amino)-9,90-spirobifluorene, serving as a hole selective layer (HSL). No electron selective layers (ESLs) were used in this work to intentionally increase the current density–voltage hysteresis. The C60-SAM was deposited following our previous report.24,40,53 The HSLs were prepared by spin coating a Spiro-OMeTAD solution at 2500 rpm for 60 s. The HSL solution was prepared by dissolving 68 mmol spiro-OMeTAD (Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 99.0%), 26 mmol Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) (Sigma, 99.95%), and 55 mmol 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Sigma, 96%) in 1 ml mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and acetonitrile (Sigma, 99.8%) with a volume ratio of 10:1. Finally 80 nm Au was thermally evaporated through a metal mask on the HSLs. The active area of the finished devices was 0.08 cm2.
Characterizations
The SEM images were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 High Resolution microscope. The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley2400 sourcemeter at different scan rates, with the samples under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination (PV Measurements Inc.). All device characterizations were performed in the ambient air (25 °C, 50% humidity).
Results and discussion
We first briefly discuss the limitations of the three commonly used approaches for measuring the MPP of hysteretic perovskite solar cells. The J–V measurement method with various voltage scan conditions such as different voltage scan directions, rates, and dwell times reports an average PCE over those extracted from all J–V curves. For a perovskite solar cell with a severe hysteretic behavior, the J–V curves depend strongly on the scan conditions. Since various degrees of hysteresis react differently to a set of sweep parameters, it is nearly impossible to find the sweep parameters that will reflect the true MPP because there are many possible sweep parameters. Fig. 1(a) shows the J–V curves of a hysteretic perovskite solar cell using various sweep parameters. This perovskite solar cell has no ESL, since it is intentionally left out in order to study hysteretic perovskite solar cells here. It is seen that dependence of J–V curves on the sweep parameters is clearly evident. Therefore, PCE calculations obtained from a finite number of J–V curves can be rather different from the true MPP of the solar cell, making it possible to overestimate or underestimate the PCE. Though this approach is still valid for solar cells with small degrees of hysteresis, caution is needed when using this approach.

(b) PCE monitored at three bias voltages, 0.9 V, 0.8 V, and 0.7 V for the same perovskite solar cell. 
The SSE approach monitors current density at the MPP bias which is typically estimated from the J–V curves. As long as the estimated bias is close to the actual one, the SSE should be very close to the maximum PCE of the device. However, there can be some complications to estimate the MPP bias, because different J–V curves give different MPP biases. For instance, is it certain that the bias chosen, from J–V measurements, for a SSE measurement is close to the true MPP bias? What if the true MPP bias changes simply from illumination or from current flow? How will degradation of unstable cells affect the MPP bias? Fig. 1(b) shows the PCE curves monitored at three bias voltages, 0.9 V, 0.8 V, and 0.7 V obtained from three J–V curves shown in Fig. 1(a). It is seen that three different SSE's are obtained because of the use of different bias points. It is worth noting that the higher bias does not necessarily give a higher SSE.
To overcome the aforementioned issues of J–V and SSE measurements, MPPT is commonly used. MPPT has been widely used to track the MPP of solar panel arrays to ensure the maximum power output of a photovoltaic system. However, only recently MPPT has attracted attention of the solar cell community as a method to characterize laboratory solar cells. A most commonly used algorithm for a conventional MPPT is the so-called P&O algorithm54–57 because of its ease to implement. In this algorithm, the operating bias of the PV module or system is perturbed by a small increment or decrement, and the resulting change in current density, ΔJ, therefore, the change in power, ΔP, is observed. If ΔP is positive, then it is confirmed that the bias perturbation moved the power output closer to the MPP and then, further bias perturbations in the same direction are applied. If ΔP is negative, then it is confirmed that the bias perturbation moved the power output away from the MPP, then further bias perturbations in the opposite direction is proceeded so that the power output can be moved back toward the MPP. The P&O algorithm is simple and easy to implement.
While an MPPT algorithm, using the described simple P&O algorithm, can effectively track the MPP of conventional solar cells and systems, it cannot be simply adopted to track the MPP of perovskite solar cells, particularly those with high levels of J–V hysteresis. For the simple MPPT to work correctly, the observed ΔJ, or consequently ΔP, must be at a steady-state condition after each perturbation. Because conventional solar cells and systems exhibit little to no hysteretic behavior, the ΔJ or ΔP achieves a steady state immediately after the bias perturbation. However, this is not the case for hysteretic perovskite solar cells, in which the current may take seconds or even up to hundreds of seconds to reach a steady state after each bias perturbation. Fig. 2(a) shows the manual tracking profile of the hysteretic cell used for Fig. 1. It is seen that it takes more than 10 seconds to reach a steady-state current for some bias steps. It would take hundreds of seconds to do manual MPPT tracking (i.e. the perturbations are performed by a person). This is not practical for routine PCE measurements. More importantly, hysteretic perovskite solar cells may be unstable. The perovskite solar cells may degrade significantly during the long tracking time needed to converge to the MPP. On the other hand, if one does not use a long enough dwell time, i.e., the waiting time until the next bias step, the current may not stabilize, and the simple tracking algorithm can under/overestimate the maximum power output at that bias. The dwell time can be defined by the number of bias steps per second (sps), for example 0.1 sps is equivalent to a 10 second dwell time. To accurately track the MPP of a hysteretic solar cell, an appropriate dwell time for each bias step must be used. To solve this issue, we first modify the conventional P&O algorithm by setting a dwell time for each bias step that waits for the magnitude of the rate of change in the electrical current to drop below a threshold, for example, 0.1% s−1, where the percentage is in relation to the presently measured electrical current value. During this dwell time, the sourcemeter continuously monitors the current and calculates the rate of change in the current. When the rate of change is below the threshold value, all transients caused by the bias perturbation are nearly fully relaxed, and the current becomes close enough to the steady state for an accurate calculation of the output power. The result should nearly be equivalent to a manual tracking procedure, but it is measured automatically. Fig. 2(b) shows the MPPT profile of the perovskite solar cell used for Fig. 1 using the modified P&O algorithm. The result is indeed very similar to the manual MPPT results shown in Fig. 2(a). However, the automatic MPPT takes the same time as the manual MPPT.

To accurately track the MPP and reduce the tracking time, we introduce a predictive P&O algorithm that has the same elements of the simple algorithm as described previously. The key difference is that instead of waiting for the current to reach the steady state, a predictive algorithm fits a double exponential decay model to the current versus time data to predict the steady-state current after each bias perturbation. Fig. 3 shows a representative current change of a hysteretic perovskite solar cell after a new bias step. In this case, the current increases with time. The change is not linear and can only be described by the combination of multiple exponential functions.

The measured true, steady-state current is shown as the black dashed line. The difference between the predicted value (ΔJ(t)) and the measured current density is shown on the right side of the plot. The solid, colored lines correspond to the predictive algorithm's fitting process, whereas the dashed horizontal lines correspond to what the simple algorithm would measure at the same time. 
To accurately predict the final, steady-state current of the curves shown in Fig. 3, many exponential functions are preferred to fit the curve. However, this will significantly limit the fitting speed, which is also the tracking speed. We find that using more than two exponential decay factors in the model has a high cost on computing time for the fitting process and is far more prone to erroneous fit results (large number of local minima traps). A double exponential decay model can fit the current curves reasonably well and does not noticeably slow down the tracking speed. With a double exponential decay model, the current density after a new bias step can be described as follows: (1)
Here, J0 is the steady-state current after a bias step, J0 = J(t → ∞). Because the sourcemeter continuously monitors the current, at a time t after each new bias step, there should be a set of current points that can be fitted by eqn (1). The fitting will give a predicted steady-state current, Jp0(t). The difference between the measured current J(t) and the predicted Jp0(t), is ΔJ(t). As shown in Fig. 3, the absolute value of ΔJ(t) decreases as t increases. When the rate of change of Jp0(t) is smaller than a preset threshold, the predicted Jp0(t) can be used as the estimated steady-state J0, instead of taking the time to wait and measure the true J0 for each bias step. Therefore, the predictive algorithm significantly saves measuring time and speeds up the tracking process. It is worth noting that the predictive MPPT algorithm does not depend on the cell configuration and performance, making it suitable for tracking the maximum power of all types of solar cells regardless of the degree of J–V hysteresis.

Fig. 4(a) shows the MPPT profile of the same perovskite solar cell used for manual and automatic MPPT (Fig. 2). The manual and automatic MPPT take more than 100 seconds to observe the stabilized PCE, but the predictive MPPT takes less than 10 seconds to observe a similar PCE. Our results demonstrate that the predictive MPPT is an adaptive and fast method for accurately tracking the MPP of perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the predictive nature enables the method to effectively track the MPP during a degradation test. Fig. 4(b) shows the MPP profile of the same perovskite solar cell measured for Fig. 4(a), but the solar cell was heated by a blow dryer at t = 70 seconds. The heating rapidly degraded the perovskite solar cell and the degradation process was nicely captured by the predictive MPPT. The predictive MPPT monitors both the bias (green profile) and current density (blue profile) as a function of time, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The profiles show an interesting degradation behavior, i.e., the heating causes a rapid decrease on current density, but only a minor reduction on bias. This reveals the capability of predictive MPPT for helping study the degradation mechanism of perovskite solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a predictive P&O algorithm to model the current data which allows the prediction of the steady-state current for each bias set. The predictive MPPT speeds up the tracking process and measures the true MPP, regardless of the degree of hysteresis. This approach can also measure the true MPP even with solar cells experiencing degradation caused by illumination and/or ambient conditions. Additionally, the predictive MPPT requires no specific parameters, which simplifies the measurement procedure. Our predictive MPPT approach offers particular advantages for perovskite solar cells with severe hysteresis.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) J–V curves measured under the AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination at reverse and forward voltage scans with different scan rates for an FTO/C60-SAM/MA0.7FA0.3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au perovskite solar cell. (b) PCE monitored at three bias voltages, 0.9 V, 0.8 V, and 0.7 V for the same perovskite solar cell.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Manual and (b) automatic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) profiles of an FTO/C60-SAM/MA0.7FA0.3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au perovskite solar cell.	 

 	Fig. 3  A representative plot of current density as a function of time after a bias perturbation set for a hysteretic perovskite-based solar cell device. The measured true, steady-state current is shown as the black dashed line. The difference between the predicted value (ΔJ(t)) and the measured current density is shown on the right side of the plot. The solid, colored lines correspond to the predictive algorithm's fitting process, whereas the dashed horizontal lines correspond to what the simple algorithm would measure at the same time.
