    , Accepted 1st February 2013First published on 1st February 2013AbstractCharge transport is one of the five main steps in the operation of organic photovoltaics, but achieving balanced hole and electron transport with high mobility has been challenging in devices. Here, we report improved charge transport in organic photovoltaics via incorporation of nanostructured inorganic electron transport materials into the active layers of devices. Co-depositing TiO2 nanowires with the organic active layer solution embeds the nanowires directly within active layers of the solar cell. The ability of these nanowires to transport electrons is compared with neat P3HT:PCBM active layers and also devices containing TiO2 nanotube aggregates. Incorporation of TiO2 nanowires yields a six-fold increase in the electron mobility relative to unmodified devices, leading to a 19% improvement in the power conversion efficiency. Lower energetic disorder of the film and more balanced charge transport are also observed upon incorporating TiO2 nanowires. These advantageous effects correlate with the TiO2 nanowire length.
1. Introduction
The potential of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) as a low-cost and low-carbon renewable energy source has generated great interest in this field over the last decade.1–3 To obtain OPVs with higher efficiency,4 efforts have been devoted to improving the properties of the active layer materials (the conjugated polymers and n-type materials),5–9 improving the fabrication processes,10–16 and understanding the many operating mechanisms.17–21 Besides the intrinsic material properties, the morphology of the active layer has also been found to dramatically affect the performance of OPVs. Due to strong Coulombic attraction, light absorption generates strongly bound electron–hole pairs instead of free electrons and holes. These excitons can only diffuse about 10 nm before decaying.22,23 However, they can be separated into free charges if a donor (conjugated polymer) and acceptor interface with a LUMO–LUMO energy difference of at least 0.3 eV (LUMO: lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) exists within their diffusion path.23,24 As a result, a large interfacial area between donor and acceptor domains in the active layer, and hence small domain volumes, is necessary for efficient exciton dissociation. After dissociation, however, free electrons and holes can only be collected if they can be transported to their corresponding contact electrodes (cathode and anode, respectively), which require both the donor and acceptor phases to be continuous throughout the thickness of the active layer. Methods such as thermal annealing,12,25,26 solvent annealing,10,27,28 and solvent additives29–31 have been developed to produce well-mixed donor and acceptor phases with dimensions on the order of 20 nm. The final tortuous phase shapes combine with the low intrinsic charge mobilities of the organic materials to yield poor charge transport at the device level.
Introducing inorganics into OPVs, in an attempt to take advantage of the high mobility and excellent chemical and physical stability of inorganic materials, has also been proposed to improve organic device efficiencies and has been widely studied in the literature.32–35 For example, OPVs have been fabricated by infiltrating the active layer solution into highly ordered, vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes.32,36 The high mobility and controllable size of TiO2 arrays improve the exciton separation and charge collection in such devices. However, complete infiltration of the active layer solution into the inorganic matrix is problematic due to the very different surface energies of the organic materials and TiO2.32,37 Additionally, including ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays within the device architecture increases the difficulty of fabrication and jeopardizes the use of flexible substrates. Another way to access the advantages of nanostructured inorganic materials in organic devices is to co-deposit inorganic nanocrystals with conjugated polymers by spin coating mixed solutions.34,35 In such cases, the nanocrystals have acted as the exclusive electron acceptors, as there were no n-type organic materials included in the blend.38–41 Although preparation is facile, these devices are often less efficient than devices prepared from the same conjugated polymer but using an n-type organic material instead. These deficiencies are caused by inefficient exciton separation within the active layer due to the limited interfacial area between the inorganic nanocrystals and conjugated polymer domains.
Here, we describe a general method for improving the performance of OPVs by incorporating nanostructured inorganic materials into active layer blends of a conjugated polymer and an n-type organic material. Introduction of the inorganic material is focused on providing better electron transport pathways within the device. In addition to the comparatively high electron mobilities of these inorganics, they can be prepared with sizes sufficiently large to bridge the domains in the active layer in order to provide more continuous, high-mobility pathways for electrons to move across the device, essentially acting as electron conduits. This method combines the advantages of simple fabrication processes with the benefits of incorporating inorganic materials into the blend, without sacrificing the exciton dissociation efficiencies of optimized OPV devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
TiO2 nanowires (TiO2-NWs) were grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (TEC 15, Hartford Glass Co.) by hydrothermal synthesis according to a modified literature procedure.42 Titanium isopropoxide (0.15 g) was added to 10 mL of a 1:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water. After stirring for several minutes, the colorless solution was decanted into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave (45 mL, Parr Instrument Co.). Two FTO slides were placed at an angle inside the vessel with the conductive side facing downwards. The nanowires were grown at 150 °C for 1.5, 3, 7.5 and 15 h to achieve 500 nm, 1 μm, 3 μm and 7 μm in length, respectively. Then, the TiO2-NWs were scratched off the glass substrate and sonicated in ethanol for at least 3 h. After sonication, the ethanol with TiO2-NWs was drop cast on another glass substrate. SEM images were taken to check the separation of TiO2-NWs. If the TiO2-NWs were well separated, they were scratched off again and weighed on a balance to obtain the desired amount. The TiO2 nanotube aggregates were treated with the same procedure before being added into the active layer solution, and their synthesis is described in detail in our previous study.43
2.2 Device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω m−2) were cleaned in a series of ultrasonic baths with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Substrates were then taken out and dried under N2 flow followed by air plasma treatment for 15 min. A hole-transport layer of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxylene thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO surface from its aqueous solution (40 nm thick). The films were baked at 140 °C for 10 min before being transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. A chlorobenzene solution containing 25 mg mL−1 P3HT (Rieke Metal, Sepiolid P100) and 15 mg mL−1 PCBM (American Dye Source Inc., ADS61BFB) was stirred inside the glovebox for at least 3 h at 60 °C. The active layers of the control devices were prepared by spin-coating this P3HT:PCBM solution to form a 140 nm thick layer. For devices with TiO2, the TiO2 nanoaggregates (TiO2-NAs) or TiO2-NWs were added into the chlorobenzene solution, which was taken out of the glovebox to sonicate for 30 min. This solution was stirred before it was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS to achieve the same thickness of the active layer as the control group. Subsequently, all the devices were transferred into a deposition chamber inside the glovebox and 100 nm of Al was thermally evaporated in a vacuum of 5 × 10−7 Torr. Finally, the devices were completed by annealing under nitrogen at 150 °C for varying times.
2.3 Device characterization
The J–V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were tested using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and an Oriel Xenon lamp (450 W) coupled with an AM 1.5 filter. The light intensity was determined using a calibrated standard silicon photovoltaic cell with KG5 filter traceable to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. A light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used in all of the measurements in this study. Device parameters were obtained by taking the average of at least 20 samples for each processing condition. The series resistance (Rseries) and the shunt resistance (Rshunt) were calculated from the inverse of the slope of the J–V curve at 1 V and 0 V, respectively. The space charge limited current (SCLC) devices were fabricated according to the above procedure but with different device configurations. These were ITO/Al (100 nm)/active layer (140 nm)/Al (100 nm) for electron-only SCLC devices and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (140 nm)/Pd (50 nm) for hole-only devices. The dark current of the SCLC devices was measured under ambient conditions using an Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC with field dependent mobility, which is described as:  where J is the current density, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, γ is the field activation factor, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer. In simulations, εr was assumed to be 3, which is a typical value for organic materials. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vrs) (due to the substrate's Rseries) from the applied voltage (Vappl), V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi. The thickness of the film (L) was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Device characterization
Previously, we reported that by adding TiO2-NAs into the active layer of P3HT and PCBM OPVs,43 the electron mobility was improved, which led to increases in both the fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of our devices. However, by adding TiO2-NAs, unfavorable decreases in both active layer light absorption and shunt resistance were observed. The decrease in shunt resistance indicated an increase in the leakage current in the devices with TiO2-NAs. Herein, we advance this device fabrication methodology by replacing TiO2-NAs with TiO2-NWs in order to eliminate these insufficiencies.
The TiO2-NWs were prepared with controlled size and length (150 nm in diameter and 1 μm in length (Fig. S1, ESI†)) through an established hydrothermal synthesis method.42,44 We hypothesized that these nanowires would be better than TiO2-NAs for several reasons. First, the TiO2-NWs have better electron conductivity than the TiO2-NAs because there are fewer grain boundaries and defects within each wire.45–47 Also, with smaller diameters than the micron-sized TiO2-NAs, the vertical size match between the TiO2-NWs and the thickness of the P3HT:PCBM active layer will be improved.
Films and devices containing TiO2-NWs were fabricated using spin coating active layer solutions containing nanowires. In an attempt to prevent nanowire aggregation, TiO2-NWs were sonicated to disperse the nanowires within the active layer solution before it was used for spin coating. Both the spin coating speed and thermal annealing time were varied to optimize the devices with TiO2-NWs or TiO2-NAs. The optimal processing condition for devices with TiO2-NWs or TiO2-NAs was found to have the same spin speed but a shorter annealing time (5 min) compared to the neat P3HT:PCBM devices (annealed for 10 min), consistent with the experimental observations made in our previous study.43
Through the J–V characterization of these devices (Fig. 1), cells with TiO2-NWs and TiO2-NAs showed significantly reduced Rseries and improved performance compared to the control devices (Table 1). By gradually reducing the amount of TiO2-NWs added, from 6 wt% to 1 wt%, the PCE of devices with TiO2-NWs increased from 3.7% to 4.1%. These values represent an 8% increase when compared to optimized devices with TiO2-NAs and a 14% increase when compared with the control. During the study, even greater degrees of improvement (25%) in PCE were observed by adding TiO2-NWs in devices with a thicker active layer (240 nm). However, as the 240 nm devices performed less efficiently than the 140 nm devices, the results were not included in the manuscript.

Additionally, in order to ensure that the observed improvements were in fact caused by the presence of the TiO2 NWs, and not because we had unintentionally altered the processing conditions during the introduction of TiO2 into the system, an extra set of devices (P3HT:PCBM, Table 1) was fabricated as an additional control. These devices were made using the same active layer solution, except that TiO2-NWs were filtered out just before spin coating. The fact that these devices show similar device parameters to the ones made from the pure P3HT:PCBM solution confirms that the incorporation of TiO2-NW causes the observed improvement in performance.
Films with TiO2-NWs had Rseries as low as 1.4 Ω cm2 for 1 wt% and 3 wt% nanowire additions, which are smaller than devices with TiO2-NAs (1.6 Ω cm2) and neat P3HT:PCBM films (2.3 Ω cm2), indicating that by incorporating TiO2-NWs, both the series resistance of the active layer and the ohmic loss in the entire device were successfully reduced. Meanwhile, Rshunt values that were previously shown to decrease in the presence of TiO2-NA (600 Ω cm2, compared to 660 Ω cm2 for the control) actually increased in devices with TiO2-NWs. OPVs with 1 wt% TiO2-NWs had Rshunt = 1400 Ω cm2. Because a larger Rshunt represents a lower current leakage, the leakage current in the devices with TiO2-NWs was significantly smaller than in both the control devices and devices with TiO2-NAs. In contrast to TiO2-NAs, which protrude from the film surface in microns, well-separated TiO2-NWs were found to have a negligible influence on the active layer morphology. Only a slight increase in the root mean square surface roughness from 0.9 nm to 1.2 nm was observed (Fig. S2, ESI†) upon introduction of the TiO2-NWs. This supports our hypothesis that because TiO2-NWs have a better size match with the active layer thickness (140 nm), they will not project beyond the surface of the active layer and therefore should not interfere with the electrode–active layer interface.
Increasing the TiO2-NW loading from 1 wt% to 6 wt% decreases Rshunt from 1400 to 880 Ω cm2, while Rseries increases from 1.4 to 1.9 Ω cm2. We attribute these phenomena to the fact that TiO2-NW aggregates are more prevalent in films with higher weight percentages of TiO2-NWs, which was confirmed using optical microscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†). These nanowire aggregates, which were found to be 0.1 μm to 0.4 μm in height, would protrude from the film surface and interfere with the contact between the top electrode and the active layer, and are more likely to trap charges compared to well separated TiO2-NWs.47–49
3.2 Charge transport in devices
To gain greater insight into the improved device performance, dark J–V characterization was carried out for the optimized devices with a device configuration designed to conduct only electrons or holes (Fig. 2). The zero-field electron and hole mobilities of the active layers in each device were subtracted through space charge limited current (SCLC) fitting and are summarized in Table 2. The fitting voltage ranges were chosen such that the current density (J) and film thickness (L) held a relationship where J ∝ L−3 (Fig. S4, ESI†). From this analysis, we can see that devices with both TiO2-NAs and TiO2-NWs have higher electron mobilities than the control devices. The devices with 1 wt% TiO2-NWs have the highest electron mobility (8.1 × 10−9 m2 V−1 s−1), which is about 3 times the value of the control devices (2.6 × 10−9 m2 V−1 s−1) and 2.5 times the value of devices with 1 wt% TiO2-NAs (3.3 × 10−9 m2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, with the addition of TiO2-NWs, the field activation factor of the active layer was reduced from 5.4 × 10−4 (m V−1)1/2 (in pure P3HT:PCBM devices) to 2.1 × 10−4 (m V−1)1/2. It has been demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations that the stretched exponential field dependence of the empirical mobility depends on the positional and energetic disorder of a film.50,51 Therefore, incorporating TiO2-NWs successfully reduced the energetic disorder of the active layer, which means a lower hopping barrier and smaller inter-hopping site spacing for electron transport indicating the creation of better electron transport pathways within the active layer.51–54

In addition to better electron mobility, better balance between electron and hole transport was also found in devices with TiO2-NAs and TiO2-NWs. The charge mobility ratios (μh/μe) are 8.5, 7.0, and 3.0 for the control devices, the devices with TiO2-NAs, and the devices with TiO2-NWs, respectively (Table 2). Because the balance between electron and hole transport inside the active layers of OPVs has a large effect on performance, balanced charge transport (μh/μe close to 1) is preferred because it reduces the current leakage and yields an increased FF.55,56 The better electron mobility and better charge-transport balance in devices with TiO2-NAs and TiO2-NWs are consistent with the trend seen in device performance found previously by the J–V characterization under AM 1.5 illumination. For devices containing TiO2-NAs, the reduction in film quality brought about by the protrusion of aggregates counteracted this benefit; an improvement in shunt resistance was not observed in these devices.
3.3 Effect of TiO2-NW length on performance
The vertical size of the incorporated material was reduced when TiO2-NWs were substituted for TiO2-NAs. This change yielded a positive effect on the performance of the final devices. We also investigated whether the lateral size (length) of the incorporated nanostructures has any impact on device performance. TiO2-NWs with similar diameters but four different lengths (500 nm, 1 μm, 3 μm, and 7 μm) were prepared by controlling the growth time. After they were separated but before they were added into the active layer solution, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken to check their size and separation (Fig. 3). After sonication, the lengths ranged from 200 nm to 700 nm in the “500 nm” TiO2-NW sample, from 800 nm to 3 μm in the “1 μm” TiO2-NW sample, from 1 μm to 4 μm in the “3 μm” TiO2-NW sample, and from 6 μm to –8 μm in the “7 μm” TiO2-NW sample. These length distributions are likely due to slight variations in nanowire growth rates and to nanowire breakage during sonication.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of (a) 500 nm, (b) 1 μm, (c) 3 μm and (d) 7 μm TiO2-NWs after separation but before being added into the P3HT:PCBM active layer solution. 
All TiO2-NWs were incorporated into P3HT:PCBM active layers at a concentration of 1 wt%. As seen previously, the FF and PCE of devices containing TiO2-NWs were higher than control devices (Fig. 4). Additionally, with increasing NW length, Rshunt also increased (Table 3). This trend suggests that with longer TiO2-NWs, more electrons are extracted from the active layers at their maximum power. Devices with 500 nm TiO2-NWs (PCE = 4.0%) were the only ones that showed a lower PCE than the devices with 1 μm TiO2-NWs (PCE = 4.1%), due to their lower Jsc (Table 3). The SEM images showed greater aggregation in the 500 nm TiO2-NWs (Fig. 3) than in the other three NW samples. The vertical size of these aggregates was much larger than the diameter of the actual wire. With these aggregated TiO2-NWs inside the active layer, the final devices likely suffer from problems similar to those observed in devices with higher weight percentages of TiO2-NWs or TiO2-NAs, as mentioned earlier.

The devices with 3 μm TiO2-NWs were very similar to those with 1 μm NWs (Table 3). This similarity can be attributed to the overlapping size range of these two NW samples (Fig. 4b and c). The best performing devices were achieved by incorporating the longest nanowires into the active layer. The PCE reached 4.3%, corresponding to a 19% improvement over the control devices (3.6%), and the FF reached an impressive 70% (Table 3). The superior performance of the devices with 7 μm TiO2-NWs can be attributed to two factors. First, the resistance of nanowires increases with decreasing size due to the increased surface to volume ratio, limiting both the mobility and availability of free carriers.57–59 As a result, the 7 μm TiO2-NWs should have the best electron mobility. Second, the disorder of the active layer with 7 μm nanowires was the lowest. Additional SCLC characterization of films with different TiO2-NW lengths (Fig. 5) shows that films with 7 μm nanowires had the highest electron mobility value of 1.5 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 and the lowest field activation factor of 5.2 × 10−5 (m V−1)1/2. In addition to the lower resistivity (when compared to shorter nanowires), another reason the 7 μm nanowires performed as the best electron transport pathway in OPVs may be because the longer nanowires have the potential to connect more individual PCBM phases within the active layer yielding a more continuous n-type network. Moreover, the free charge transport inside films with 7 μm TiO2-NWs was the most balanced, with a charge mobility ratio μh/μe = 1.6.

To test whether this method would work for other active layer systems, a new polymer:PCBM active layer system (PSiF-BT:PCBM) was also tested. The molecular structure of PSiF-BT is shown in Fig. 6. With no further processing optimization, 7 μm TiO2-NWs were incorporated into the PSiF-BT:PCBM active layer under the same conditions as for the P3HT:PCBM active layer. Again, device performance was improved with addition of TiO2-NWs; films without nanowires had Voc = 0.86 V, Jsc = 8.8 mA cm−2, FF = 56%, and PCE = 4.2% compared to Voc = 0.87 V, Jsc = 8.8 mA cm−2, FF = 60%, and PCE = 4.6% for films with TiO2-NWs (Fig. 6).

4. Conclusions
In summary, the incorporation of TiO2-NWs improves the performance of OPVs by providing improved pathways for electron transport. Compared to TiO2-NAs, TiO2-NWs perform better as electron transport pathways due to the presence of fewer defects and grain boundaries, as well as better size matching with the thickness of the device active layer. As a result, devices with TiO2-NWs show higher electron mobility, more balanced free charge transport, and a larger number of charges extracted at the maximum power. The electron mobilities and fill factors increase with increasing nanowire length. For devices with 7 μm TiO2-NWs, FFs reached an impressive 70%. By incorporating 7 μm TiO2-NWs into PSiF-BT:PCBM OPVs, similar device behavior and improvements were also observed, indicating this method is generally applicable to OPVs with active layers other than P3HT:PCBM. This co-deposition strategy thus successfully introduces the attractive electron transport properties of inorganic nanowires to OPV devices without compromising the equally attractive device processing and performance characteristics of the OPV devices themselves.
