    , Accepted 1st March 2013First published on 4th March 2013AbstractA novel organometal halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI2Br) is synthesized and used as a visible light absorber to sensitize one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanowire arrays (NWAs) for all-solid-state hybrid solar cells. It achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.87% and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V, both higher than those of its analogue CH3NH3PbI3.
All-solid-state hybrid photovoltaics based on mesoscopic inorganic semiconductor nanostructures and organic conducting materials have been considered as promising next generation solar cells, as they integrate the desirable advantages of nanofabrication and organic electronics.1,2 In this hybrid system, extremely thin absorber (ETA) layers, such as molecular dyes1,3 or semiconductor quantum dots,4–7 are typically introduced to the interface between the inorganic electron transport materials (ETMs) and the organic hole transport materials (HTMs), to enhance the light harvesting efficiency. Upon light excitation, the ETA injects electrons into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor and holes into the HTMs, allowing the separation of photogenerated charges, which then diffuse to the corresponding electrodes. Such charge separation and transport occurring at the ETA–ETM and ETA–HTM interfaces play a crucial role to the device performance.2,3,8 In this vein, it is very important to tune the optical and electronic properties of the ETA layers by varying the band gaps of the semiconductor quantum dots through quantum confinement9,10 or by employing organic dyes with different highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO–LOMO)11,12 to optimize the energy level alignment and light absorption in the hybrid system. However, applying these ETA materials to the conventional mesoscopic particulate films could encounter obstacles such as inefficient electron transport in the nanocrystalline films and incomplete filling of organic HTMs in the mesopores of the films.13,14 Our strategy in this work is to develop a hybrid photovoltaic cell by fabricating ordered nanostructures for ETMs, and meanwhile, establishing a simple process to tune the optical and electronic properties of ETAs, so as to tune the energy band alignment between ETAs and ETMs, eventually improving the charge transfer and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device.
One-dimensional (1D) nanowire arrays (NWAs) provide a direct path for the photogenerated electron transport.15,16 Of note is that the straight channels among the nanowires could benefit the filling of the HTMs, thus enhancing the hole transport efficiency.17,18 Between the 1D structure and the HTM lies an ETA layer of organometal halide perovskite sensitizers. As an ETA, perovskite sensitizers have demonstrated photovoltaic potential in hybrid cells constructed with mesoporous films,19–21 but the extension to 1D-based cells is yet to be studied. By a single halogen substitution, we have synthesized a novel sensitizer (CH3NH3PbI2Br) with higher absorption coefficients and a higher CB edge, which are auspicious for the 1D-based devices. The resulting hybrid photovoltaic cells, fabricated by combining TiO2 NWAs as the ETM, CH3NH3PbI2Br as the ETA and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as the HTM, have achieved a 4.87% PCE with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V, and both the PCE and Voc are significantly improved over those of CH3NH3PbI3.
The 1D TiO2 NWAs were grown on seeded fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates via a hydrothermal process reported previously with some modifications (see ESI† for details).22 The morphologies of the TiO2 NWAs were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Fig. 1a shows a typical cross-sectional SEM image of the as-synthesized TiO2 NWA film. The NWAs film is about 1.5 μm thick and most nanowires grow approximately vertical to the FTO substrate. Viewing from the top as in Fig. 1b, the diameters of most nanowires are 50–150 nm. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S1, ESI†), the nanowires take a tetragonal rutile structure (JCPDS: 00-021-1276). Advanced microstructures of the nanowires were determined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (Fig. S2a, ESI†) reveals a (110) interplanar distance of 0.326 nm and a (001) interplanar distance of 0.297 nm, both of which agree with the relevant interplanar distances of rutile TiO2, suggesting the [001] growth direction of the nanowires. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S2b, ESI†) demonstrates that the nanowires have a single crystalline rutile structure, in accordance with the XRD analysis above.

For solar cell studies, the as-synthesized TiO2 NWAs were coated with the organometal halide perovskite sensitizers (CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI2Br) (see ESI† for details). From the SEM images shown in Fig. 1c and d, it can be seen clearly that a perovskite sensitizer layer composed of 10–20 nm nanoparticles has been formed on the surface of the TiO2 NWAs. These perovskite sensitized TiO2 NWAs were spin coated with a HTM layer (spiro-MeOTAD), followed by thermal evaporation of a Au layer as the counter electrode. The cross-sectional SEM image of the photovoltaic cell, shown in Fig. 1e, portrays the whole device structure, which conforms well to the layout of the hybrid inorganic–organic FTO/TiO2 NWAs/perovskite sensitizer/spiro-MeOTAD/Au unit in Fig. 1f. The distribution of perovskite sensitizers within the photoanodes was estimated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†). The weight percentages of Br, I and Pb in the CH3NH3PbI2Br sensitized photoanode are 2.55%, 7.97% and 6.33%, respectively, translating to the expected 1:2:1 atomic ratio (Fig. S4a, ESI†), while those of I and Pb with CH3NH3PbI3 are 17.23% and 9.31%, respectively, resulting in a 3:1 atomic ratio that correlates with the formula unit (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The formation of the perovskite ETA layers has been further confirmed by XRD analysis. The XRD patterns for CH3NH3PbI2Br and CH3NH3PbI3 coated on TiO2 NWAs (Fig. 2a) and FTO (Fig. 2b) indicate that both materials have a similar crystalline structure assignable to the perovskite system.23,24 The CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized film gives diffraction peaks at 14.05, 28.45, 31.87, 40.45 and 43.13°, which can be assigned to the (110), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure with a = 8.872 Å and c = 12.637 Å, while CH3NH3PbI2Br shows peaks at 14.40, 29.06 and 32.60° corresponding to the (110), (220) and (310) planes, respectively, of a tetragonal perovskite structure with a = 8.681 Å, b = 8.692 Å and c = 12.268 Å. Compared to CH3NH3PbI3, the diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI2Br are shifted uniformly to high angles, which can be rationalized by the shrunken crystalline lattice wholly caused by the single-atom replacement of I with Br. Those atomic to structural changes in the ETA layer cast important variations in its optical and electronic properties, thereby offering a handle to modulate the photovoltaic operation of the hybrid devices.

Fig. 3a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the two organometal halide perovskites spin-coated on TiO2 NWAs and the corresponding absorption spectra (inset) converted according to the Kubelka–Munk relation (optical absorption coefficients ∝ F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R). While CH3NH3PbI3 absorbs light in a relatively longer wavelength region up to ∼800 nm, the appreciable absorption of CH3NH3PbI2Br is mainly at <700 nm; note that the absorption coefficients of the latter at 400–650 nm are substantially higher than those of CH3NH3PbI3 (inset of Fig. 3a). The different absorption ranges can be easily ascribed to the variation of the energy band gaps (Eg) of those two semiconductor sensitizers arising from the Br-replacement induced structural modifications. Eg for the perovskite sensitizers can be estimated using the conventional Tauc equation [F(R)hν]n = A(hν − Eg) (A is an empirical constant, n = 2 for the direct band gap semiconductor) by extrapolation of the linear part of the [F(R)hν]nvs. hν plots (Fig. 3b). We found that the Eg value for CH3NH3PbI3 is 1.57 eV, which is in good agreement with those reported elsewhere,20,23 while it is 1.78 eV for CH3NH3PbI2Br, which is >0.2 eV larger, mainly caused by the hybridization of the Br (4p) orbitals with the I (5p) and Pb (6s) orbitals. Furthermore, such introduction of the Br (4p) orbitals could give rise to the variation of the valence band (VB) edge of the perovskite sensitizers. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to investigate the VB edge positions of these two sensitizers. Shown in Fig. 3c–e are the corresponding UPS spectra with respect to the He I photon energy (21.22 eV). The VB edge energy (EVB) values, with reference to the vacuum level, are calculated to be −5.43 and −5.40 eV for CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI2Br, respectively. The CB edge energies (ECB) can then be determined from the Eg and EVB values, yielding −3.62 eV for CH3NH3PbI2Br that is substantially higher than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.86 eV). On the basis of the results, Fig. 4 sketches the band alignment scheme for the hybrid photovoltaic cells. Apparently, the higher CB edge of CH3NH3PbI2Br elicits a larger driving force for the photogenerated electrons to transfer from the sensitizer to the TiO2 NWAs, which could lead to an enhanced photogenerated electron injection efficiency from the CH3NH3PbI2Br sensitizer to the TiO2 NWAs,10,25 compared to the CH3NH3PbI3-based device. Indeed, the CH3NH3PbI2Br-based photovoltaic cell gives higher incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values at 400–650 nm than those of CH3NH3PbI3 as can be seen from Fig. 5a, which, although mainly caused by the higher optical absorption coefficients at 400–650 nm (inset of Fig. 3a), could also benefit from the enhanced electron injection from the CH3NH3PbI2Br sensitizer to the TiO2 NWAs. The resulting short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.12 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5b and Table 1) is comparable to that of the CH3NH3PbI3-based device in spite of the much narrower absorption of CH3NH3PbI2Br (Fig. 3a).

Contrasting the high IPCEs at 400–650 nm, there is a smaller dark current of the photovoltaic cell based on CH3NH3PbI2Br compared to that of the CH3NH3PbI3-based device (Fig. 5b), meaning that the solar cell featuring the TiO2 NWAs/CH3NH3PbI2Br sensitizer/spiro-MeOTAD/Au junction can better restrain the recombination of the photogenerated electrons injected into the TiO2 NWAs and the holes extracted into spiro-MeOTAD. Since the Voc and fill factor (FF) are closely related to the recombination rate of the photogenerated charges, the larger Voc (0.82 V) and FF (0.59) of the CH3NH3PbI2Br-based cell are thus expected (Fig. 5b and Table 1). Altogether, it is because of the improvements in IPCE (at 400–650 nm), FF and Voc that the CH3NH3PbI2Br cells could achieve an overall PCE of 4.87%, almost 20% higher than that based on the CH3NH3PbI3 sensitizer (4.29%) (Table 1).
Of note is that the 1D TiO2 NWAs/CH3NH3PbI2Br/spiro-MeOTAD device performs best when the length of the 1D NWAs, or the film thickness, is ∼1.5 μm (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). This is contrary to the hybrid perovskite photovoltaic cells based on mesoporous films, the thickness of which is restricted to the submicron scale due partly to the limitations of electron transport in nanocrystalline films and the pore filling of polymer HTMs.19,20 This result indicates that the 1D NWAs-based device offers the promise of employing thicker films with larger surface areas without sacrificing the charge transport efficiency. Besides the film thickness, other morphology parameters of the 1D NWAs, such as the density and diameter, can also influence the device performance significantly. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, although the diameter of most nanowires is below 100 nm, there are still lots of nanowires with a diameter larger than 150 nm grown on the substrate. Such thick nanowires thin down the surface area of the 1D NWAs film, resulting in a decline of the device performance. Thus, synthesis of 1D NWAs with a high density and a uniformly small diameter is a sought-after goal for the development of hybrid solar cells. By precisely controlling the film morphology, such hybrid photovoltaics with higher PCEs might be achieved.
In conclusion, a solution processed all-solid-state hybrid solar cell based on a new organometal halide perovskite sensitizer and 1D TiO2 NWA with a PCE of ∼5% has been demonstrated. Our results show that higher Voc and PCE can be achieved by Br-substitution in the perovskite sensitizer CH3NH3PbI3. The significantly improved Voc and efficiency achieved here highlight the superior electronic and optical properties of the 1D TiO2 NWAs and CH3NH3PbI2Br sensitizer, opening up new avenues for advancing the development of hybrid photovoltaic cells.
