    , Accepted 6th June 2013First published on 10th June 2013AbstractOxasmaragdyrin boron complexes were prepared and applied in DSSCs. The HOMO–LUMO energy gap analyses and theoretical calculations revealed that these expanded porphyrins are ideal sensitizers for DSSCs. A device containing oxasmaragdyrin–BF2 as the sensitizer achieves an energy conversion efficiency of 5.7%.
Dye-sensitized solar cells1 (DSSCs) have emerged as promising candidates amongst the green energy sources due to their advantages such as low cost, high performance, and easy processing.2 Although a lot of factors determine the efficiency of DSSCs, the light-harvesting properties of a photosensitizer remain utmost importance. Recently, Yella et al. reported a Zn(II) porphyrin with the D–π–A push–pull structure showing a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 12.3% when incorporated with an organic dye into the [Co(bipy)3]2+/3+-based electrolyte under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight.3 It is projected that the accessibility of high efficiency near-infrared (NIR) and panchromatic dyes might further improve the efficiency of DSSCs. From the spectroscopic point of view, the expanded porphyrins offer a broad range of compounds with absorption energies down to infrared regions.4 Expanded porphyrins with more than four pyrrole subunits in the porphyrinic macrocycle have been widely used in a variety of applications including anion and metal sensors,5 NIR sensing dyes,6 two-photon absorption (TPA) materials,7 and photodynamic therapy8 due to their increased cavity sizes and unique properties in association with extended π-conjugation. Although enormous literature is available on porphyrin-sensitized solar cells9 and red-shifted absorption bands of expanded porphyrins match well with the demands for a low energy sensitizer, surprisingly an expanded porphyrin has never been used as the sensitizer for DSSCs. To uncover the potential of applying expanded porphyrins to DSSC studies, herein we report the syntheses and photophysical and photovoltaic properties of boron chelated oxasmaragdyrins, a class of aromatic core-modified expanded porphyrin with a 22 π-electron conjugation. The oxasmaragdyrin boron complexes 4a–4e with structures depicted in Scheme 1 demonstrate panchromatic incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs), high short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), and moderate-to-good overall efficiencies revealing an opportunity to develop expanded porphyrin-based highly efficient sensitizers for DSSCs.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of boryl oxasmaragdyrins 4a–4e. 
The desired oxasmaragdyrin complexes 4a–4e were prepared in four steps in decent yields under mild reaction conditions. Oxasmaragdyrin 1 was prepared from 3+2 condensation of meso-(4-methoxyphenyl)dipyrromethane and 16-oxatripyrrane in the presence of TFA as the acid catalyst.10 The BF2 chelated complex 2 was prepared by treating 1 with triethylamine and BF3·OEt2 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature. The treatment of oxasmaragdyrin–BF2 complex 2 with an excess amount of the corresponding alcohol in the presence of AlCl3 at refluxing temperature for 10 min yielded dialkoxyboranyl chelated 3b–3e.11 The final oxasmaragdyrins 4a–4e were isolated in moderate yields by hydrolysis of the precursors 2 and 3b–3e with aqueous KOH in THF under reflux conditions (Scheme 1). In our design, alkoxy groups with long chains from C2 to C10 were introduced to shield oxasmaragdyrins from aggregation and to increase their solubility.
The absorption spectra of oxasmaragdyrins 4a–4e display split Soret bands in the 400–500 nm region and Q-bands in the 550–750 nm region as shown in Fig. 1. Markedly, the split Soret band covers a broader range of absorption wavelengths than regular porphyrins. Additionally, the Q-bands, which are more intense than those for typical zinc or free base porphyrins and are mainly contributed from the HOMO to LUMO transition (Table S-1, ESI†), give the highest extinction coefficient (ε) at 710 nm, a shift of almost 100 nm in the NIR region compared to Zn(TPP).
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of oxasmaragdyrins 4a–4e: (a) in THF (inset: expansion of Q-bands) and (b) adsorbed on TiO2. 
The quantum-chemical calculations of structural optimization were performed for compounds 4a–4e using the density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G basis set. The results show planar structures for all studied dyes (see Fig. S-16, ESI†). Two alkoxide long chains lie on opposite sides of the oxasmaragdyrin plane and extend over to shield the furan ring. The calculations indicate that in the HOMO and HOMO − 1 orbitals, the majority of the electron density localizes on the macrocyclic π-system of the oxasmaragdyrin ring whereas in the LUMO and LUMO + 2 orbitals, electron densities delocalized further to the meso-carboxyphenyl anchoring group. The effective electron density redistribution should facilitate efficient electron injection from the excited state of oxasmaragdyrin to the conduction band of TiO2. Significantly, theoretical calculations also revealed a higher molecular dipole moment (8.60 D) for the BF2 chelated 4a than an average of 7.86 D for B(OR)2 chelated oxasmaragdyrins. The higher polarizability is beneficial to facilitate intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of all oxasmaragdyrins 4a–4e showed two reversible oxidation and one reversible reduction couples (Fig. S-15, ESI†). The static potentials and currents under multiple scans suggest high stability and reversibility of these compounds. The data in Table 1 show that the oxidation potentials of oxasmaragdyrins 4b–4e shifted towards less positive by 140 to 170 mV resulting in elevated HOMO levels compared to oxasmaragdyrin–BF24a. The reduction potentials of 4b–4e shifted toward more negative by approximately 120 mV than that of the oxasmaragdyrin–BF2 complex. Based on E(0,0) obtained from absorption and emission spectra and the first oxidation potential obtained from CV, the ground state oxidation potentials (Eox) and excited state oxidation potentials (Eox*) were calculated as listed in Table 1. For all of the oxasmaragdyrin boryl complexes, Eox* are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 electrode while the Eox are more positive than the redox potential of I−/I3−. Although the red-shift in the absorption band of oxasmaragdyrins indicated a smaller band gap between HOMO and LUMO levels, the electrochemical data confirm the high driving force for both electron injection and dye regeneration.

The BF2 and B(OR)2 chelated oxasmaragdyrins 4a–4e were fabricated into the solar cell devices in the presence of CDCA as a co-adsorbent as detailed in the ESI.†12Fig. 2a shows the current–voltage plots of the devices measured under standard AM 1.5G simulated solar conditions; the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The DSSCs sensitized with oxasmaragdyrin–BF2 complex 4a exhibited the best performance with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc/mA cm−2) of 13.71, an open-circuit voltage (Voc/V) of 0.591, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.703, corresponding to an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.70%. The oxasmaragdyrin derivatives 4b–4e all had efficiencies lower than that of the BF2 complex 4a, with a typical trend of an improved device performance upon increasing the length of alkoxy chains. The trend of Jsc in this series can be understood from the variation of IPCE action spectra shown in Fig. 2b. The lower efficiencies of devices 4b and 4c can be partly attributed to the lower dye-loading (DL) as shown in Table 2. We noted that the IPCE values corresponding to the absorption region of the Soret band of device 4a reached 60%, and those of the Q band were around 50%. Also the dip between 500 and 600 nm was much higher (around 40%) for device 4a compared to the devices 4b–4e. To understand the key factors accounting for the IPCE values observed herein, we carried out transient photoelectric and charge-extraction (CE) measurements for the five devices under investigation.

The charge densities (Ne) of the devices under a certain bias light irradiation and open-circuit conditions were determined via CE measurements when the circuit of the system was switched to the short-circuit conditions.13 The CE results show that the extracted charge densities were much smaller than those of highly efficient devices reported elsewhere,13 indicating that either less electrons were injected into the conduction band of TiO2, or the system involved a serious problem in expediting the charge recombination at the dye/TiO2 interface. As a result, transient photovoltage decay (ΔVocvs. time) was performed using the small-amplitude approach based on seven white-light intensities (power densities in the range 7–102 mW cm−2) as bias irradiation under open-circuit conditions.13 Decay curves of ΔVocvs. time for the five devices were fitted according to a single exponential function to determine time coefficients for charge recombination (τR). Fig. 3a and b show the plots of τRvs. Ne and Vocvs. Ne, respectively. The plots of Vocvs. Ne show that the potentials were down-shifted upon increasing the length of the alkoxyl chains, and this trend is against the variation of Voc showing the opposite trend (Table 2). On the other hand, we found that the values of τR in this series are much smaller than those reported for highly efficient dyes,13 confirming that the relatively poor device performances of these porphyrins are due to the effect of rapid charge recombination. This effect causes significant reduction of the charge densities in the conduction band of TiO2, and thus leads to a decrease in the performance for both Jsc and Voc. The plots of τRvs. Ne shown in Fig. 3a display a systematic trend of τR for B(OR)2 complexes with 4e > 4c > 4d > 4b, consistent with the variation of Voc in this series. These results indicate that the two alkoxyl chains attached to the boron center could help in retarding the charge recombination. Typically, a longer alkoxyl chain would have a better retardation effect to repel the approach of triiodide anion species toward the surface of TiO2 for a larger τR and a higher Voc, but an exception for the 4d complex with heptoxyl chains was observed. Interestingly, we observed that the τR values of 4e were significantly greater than those of 4a, which cannot explain the fact that Voc of 4a was slightly larger than that of 4e. We expect that the electron injection efficiency of the 4a device should be greater than that of the 4e device so as to generate more injected electrons in the CB of TiO2 to give a larger Fermi level for the observed higher Voc for the former than for the latter. The effect of electron injection can also be applied to rationalize the observed trend of Jsc, which is higher for 4a than for 4e.14

In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that boron complexes of oxasmaragdyrin, a class of core-modified expanded porphyrin, can be applied as efficient photosensitizers for DSSC. In contrast to the relatively low efficiencies of the devices using BODIPY derivatives as the sensitizers,15 boron chelated oxasmaragdyrins provide desired redox potentials, high absorption coefficients, high stability, and higher power conversion efficiencies suitable for an effective sensitizer in DSSCs. More importantly, broad absorption spreading over the entire visible region and its lower energy Q band covering part of the NIR region make this class of compound an optimistic candidate for being one of the future selections of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells.
