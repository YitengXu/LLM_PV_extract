Broader context
With increasing environmental pollution and energy shortages, a major scientific and societal challenge is the conversion from a fossil fuel-based energy economy to a sustainable and clean one. Clean energy, such as solar, has a much lower environmental impact than conventional energies and will not run out, which is rapidly becoming a global issue. Different kinds of technologies have been used to convert and store energy from clean energy, such as hydrogen fuel cells, Li-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells and so on. At the same time, various materials have been optimized to increase energy storage and conversion efficiency. MOFs, with high yield and low cost, are promising candidates for application to clean energy based on their high surface area, adjusted pore sizes, controllable structures, low densities and so on. In this review, we present a survey on the research progresses for MOFs as platforms in hydrogen storage, fuel cells, Li-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells.

1 Introduction
Today, an important and urgent global problem for us is the wide use of fossil fuels and consequent lack of fuel and environmental pollution (green house effect etc.). This world is at an energy crossroads. Thus, the development of clean energy has been the subject of recent attention. Various energy storage and conversion systems are being developed aimed at utilization of different clean energy sources. Some reasonable and constructive plans have been considered. Free solar energy is a clean, safe, and renewable source of energy, which can be converted to electric energy and stored in a rechargeable battery, and can produce hydrogen from water by photocatalysis and so on.1–3 Hydrogen is one of the most promising candidates to replace non-renewable fuel sources used nowadays because it is high in energy, and can react with oxygen to generate electric energy in fuel cells without producing pollution.4–10 Although different kinds of materials have been employed in this field,11–15 it is still a huge challenge to effectively store and convert hydrogen for use when needed with the highest efficiency and near zero carbon emission.
Emerging as a new class of porous crystalline materials, MOFs,16–20 assembled by two main components of inorganic vertices (metal ions or clusters) and organic linkers, have become a rapidly developing research area and have attracted tremendous attention in the last two decades. As a sub-branch of coordination polymers,21 one of the advantages of MOFs is that their structures can be designed according to targeted properties by careful selection of metal centers and different functional linkers.22–33 A key structural feature in MOFs is the high porosity as well as high surface area, which plays a crucial role in the functional properties, typically in gas storage and separation,34–41 hosting guest molecules or nanoparticles (NPs) or as nanoreactors,42 thin films,43–46 sensing or recognition,47–49 proton conduction50–52 and drug delivery.53,54 In addition, MOFs display versatile excellent properties in magnetism,55 fluorescence,56–58 catalysis,59–62 electrochemistry63 and so on.64,65 As a kind of multifunctional material, MOFs can be obtained in high yield by using cheap starting materials, combined with a low framework density and high thermal stability, which make them a candidate for applications related to clean energy.66
The topic of this review is on MOFs as platforms for clean energy. We aim to present the progress investigation, discussion and challenges related to the applications of MOFs in the fields of hydrogen energy (hydrogen sorption, nanoconfinement of chemical hydrides, hydrogen generation), fuel cells, Li-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells according to MOF's roles (Scheme 1). We sincerely hope that this will inspire the interest of readers in clean energy investigation, who are advised to further read the cited articles and reviews.

2 MOFs for hydrogen energy
Hydrogen is an attractive option because it has a high energy content (120 MJ kg−1 compared to 44 MJ kg−1 for gasoline) and produces a clean exhaust product (water vapor without CO2 or NOx), which is one of the most promising candidates as a renewable, environmentally friendly energy carrier. Much attention has been paid to hydrogen energy by researchers and governments. In September 2011, the US Department of Energy (DOE) set the new targets for developing and verifying on-board hydrogen storage systems: 5.5 wt% in gravimetric capacity and 0.040 kg L−1 volumetric capacity at mild conditions (−40 to 60 °C) by 2017,67 which are for a complete system, including tank, material, valves, regulators, piping, mounting brackets, insulation, added cooling capacity, and/or other balance-of-plant components. With the merits of high crystallinity, purity, adjustable high porosity and controllable structural characteristics, MOFs have been proven to be excellent candidates in the field of hydrogen storage.
2.1 MOFs as absorbents for hydrogen
The most direct method of hydrogen storage is to use hydrogen sorption materials. Since the first investigation on MOF (4.5 wt% at 77 K and 1 atm for MOF-5, Zn4O(BDC)3, H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) for hydrogen storage was reported by Yaghi and co-workers in 2003,68 MOFs have attracted worldwide attention in the area of hydrogen storage. In just a few years, there have been numerous articles published on hydrogen sorption in MOFs, which evaluate MOFs as physi-sorbents for hydrogen storage applications and show superior performances compared to other porous materials. It is an important foundation for the development of hydrogen storage from experimental and theoretical research. Lots of important research methods and results have been reviewed by some independent groups,69–77 and therefore we shall not describe here in detail. Some factors, which influence hydrogen sorption in MOFs, have been summarized, such as exposed metal sites, surface areas and pore volumes, topological structures (interpenetration or not), properties of linkers, chemical doping for MOFs, spillover, weak interaction between hydrogen and frameworks and so on. Constantly updated test and calculation methods, adsorption mechanisms and so on, and the corresponding strategies have also been suggested, which promote the fast development of this field. Up to now, the highest excess H2 storage capacity reported is 99.5 mg g−1 at 56 bar and 77 K in NU-100 (NU = Northwestern University, Cu3(TCEPEB)(H2O)3, TCEPEB = 1,3,5-tris[(1,3-carboxylic acid-5-(4-(ethynyl)phenyl))ethynyl]-benzene) with a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 6143 m2 g−1, which has a total capacity of 164 mg g−1 at 77 K and 70 bar.78 The highest total H2 storage capacity reported is 176 mg g−1 (excess 86 mg g−1) in MOF-210 (Zn4O(bte)4/3(bpdc), H3bte = 4,4′,4′′-[benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tris(ethyne-2,1-diyl)]tribenzoic acid and H2bpdc = biphenyldicarboxylic acid, and BET surface area of 6240 m2 g−1) at 77 K and 80 bar.79 Based on the weak intermolecular force (van der Waals), hydrogen storage in MOFs by physisorption is necessary to apply low temperature to achieve a sufficient adsorbed amount, and the release of hydrogen molecules is fast. A huge challenge is how to reach the DOE targets by use of MOFs at convenient temperatures, which inspire researchers to find effective strategies for hydrogen storage. A possible solution might be to optimize various factors that affect hydrogen storage in MOFs (categories of metals, characteristics of linkers, large enough surface area and pore volume, modification of MOFs and so on) and combine them.
2.2 Nanoconfinement of chemical hydrides in MOFs for chemical hydrogen storage
Chemical hydrogen storage, which involves the storing of hydrogen in the form of chemical bonds, is one of the safe and efficient alternatives to physical hydrogen storage. Over the past decade, solid-state hydrogen storage materials have received considerable attention as promising chemical hydrogen storage materials due to their attractive features, such as high hydrogen density, relative stability, safe storability and so on.80–82 Small inorganic molecules, such as ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) with a hydrogen capacity of 19.6 wt%, exceeding that of gasoline,83–85 anhydrous hydrazine (H2NNH2) with that of 12.5 wt%86,87 and so on, are attractive candidates for chemical hydrogen-storage applications.88–95 Metal borohydrides M(BH4)n are promising hydrogen storage materials, with theoretical hydrogen capacities of 18.3 wt%, and 121 kg m−3 for lithium borohydride (LiBH4).96 Lightweight metal hydrides (MgH2, NaH and NaAlH4) are also considered as hydrogen storage media.97,98
Nanoconfinement is of increasing interest and may lead to significantly enhanced kinetics, higher degree of stability and/or more favourable thermodynamic properties,92 which are employed in different types of hydrogen storage materials.99–102 MOFs have a cavity size that varies from microporous (smaller than 2 nm) to mesoporous (between 2 and 50 nm), which is regarded as bridging the gap between zeolites and mesoporous silica, and are very suitable as host matrices to support guest molecules.103–106 MOFs offer an attractive alternative to traditional scaffolds because their nanoscale pores and ordered crystalline lattice provides a highly controlled and inherently understandable environment. Chemical hydrides have been incorporated into MOFs through liquid impregnation and vapor phase infiltration methods to form chemical hydride@MOF composites, in which the appropriate dimensional pores in MOFs not only accommodate the chemical hydrides but also, more importantly, nanoconfine the chemical hydrides in them (Table 1).

JUC-32-Y,107 (Y(BTC)(H2O)·DMF (H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarbocylic acid, DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide)) is used for the first successful synthesis of a MOF-confined AB (ammonia borane) system (denoted as AB@JUC-32-Y) with approximately 8 wt% AB introduced by the infusion method in anhydrous methanol solvent.108 In this case, MOF as the host material can improve the thermal hydrogen release of AB. The coordinately unsaturated metal Y3+ sites of JUC-32-Y interacted with AB to completely prevent the formation of ammonia. Neat AB has a two-step decomposition near its melting point (112 °C) and ∼150 °C.109 For AB@JUC-32-Y, as shown in Fig. 1, AB could release 8.0 wt% hydrogen within 10 min at even a low temperature of 85 °C, where the decomposition temperature of AB decreases ∼30 °C. More importantly, no volatile products (e.g., borazine, ammonia, and diborane) were found during the decomposition process. In this case, MOF acts as both the host and catalyst, and hydrogen generation is promoted by a synergistic effect of nanoconfinement of the MOF pores and catalysis by the metal centers.

Additionally, some classic MOFs (MIL-101,110 MIL: Materials of Institute Lavoisier, M3F(H2O)2O(BDC)3·nH2O, M = Cr or Fe; Mg-MOF-74,111,112 Mg2(DOBDC), DOBDC = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; Zn-MOF-74,113 Zn2(DOBDC) and zeolitic-imidazolate-framework ZIF-8,114 [Zn(MeIm)2], MeIm = 2-methylimidazolate) have been employed for nanoconfinement of AB and its derivatives.115–119
With the specific one-dimensional hexagonal pore structure, Mg-MOF-74 facilitates AB loading in methanol with a large mass fraction up to approximately 26 wt%, which corresponds to an AB/Mg molar ratio of 1:1.115 Different amounts of AB can be confined in the pores of MOFs. The H2 release temperature and kinetics are dependent on the amount of AB encapsulated. AB@Mg-MOF-74 can release 10–12 wt% of clean H2 in 20 min slightly above 100 °C, and 9 wt% within 25, 90 and 420 min at 95, 85 and 75 °C, respectively. In addition, the authors also demonstrated that Ni-MOF-74 and HKUST-1116 (Cu3(TMA)2(H2O)3, TMA = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) are not suitable for the nanoconfinement of AB molecules, showing that metal centers play a significant role in this case. Recently, Srinivas et al. employed Zn-MOF-74 to confine AB molecules with AB/Zn ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 as 1AB@Zn-MOF-74 and 2AB@Zn-MOF-74, respectively.117 During the hydrogen generation by pyrolysis, no ammonia, borazine and diborane were observed for 1AB@Zn-MOF-74, while 2AB@Zn-MOF-74 shows trace amounts of byproducts. Thus, the metal center is important for nanoconfinement of AB molecules based on the above two cases.
In 2011, Si et al. synthesized a series of nanocomposites of MIL-101 and Ni@MIL-101 (prepared by immersing MIL-101 in a NiCl2 solution) with different amounts of AB.118 For pyrolysis of AB, MIL-101 and Ni@MIL-101 doped with AB samples start to evolve H2 at about 50 °C and give broad desorption peaks centered at 85 and 75 °C, respectively, which are lower than other AB nanocomposite systems. More importantly, it (75 °C) is lower than the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell working temperature (80 °C). Thus, MOFs are effective host materials to improve the thermal decomposition of AB and the introduction of a catalyst into the nanocomposites is a feasible method for improving both thermodynamics and kinetics.
When confining both a chemical hydride and metal nanoparticle catalyst in the MOF pores, metal nanoparticles may provide an additional catalytic effect to the nanoconfinement. Recently, we reported the pyrolysis of AB from the AB/Pt@MIL-101 composite, which showed the first and second H2 evolution peaks at about 88 and 130 °C, respectively, and ∼30 °C lower than those for the pristine AB. The effective depression of volatile byproducts and the absence of material foaming observed for AB/Pt@MIL-101 clearly demonstrate the synergetic effect of the Pt NP catalysis and nanoconfinement of the MIL-101 framework during the pyrolysis process.119
Fischer and co-workers employed a vapor phase infiltration method to confine dimethylamine borane (DMAB = H3B·NMe2H) in the pores of ZIF-8.120 Interestingly, DMAB@ZIF-8 can change to (H2B·NMe2)2@ZIF-8 through dehydrocoupling reaction at room temperature.
In 2009, Allendorf and co-workers loaded NaAlH4 to HKUST-1 in THF, and on average there are eight THF molecules and eight formula units of NaAlH4 per large pore.121 For the pyrolysis of nanoscale hydrides in MOF, it can start desorbing H2 at 70 °C and desorb ∼80% of the total H2 at 155 °C, during which MOF is not decomposed (Fig. 2). However, bulk NaAlH4 shows the onset dehydrogen temperature of 150 °C and 70% of the total H2 is desorbed at 250 °C. Then, they prepared the NaAlH4@HKUST-1 with NaAlH4 cluster size of 1 nm, and quantitatively investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of H2 desorption. The results show that the size of NaAlH4 clusters exerts a greater influence on the thermodynamics and reaction rates than other factors, such as interactions between NaAlH4 and pore walls and so on.122 When confining both hydrogen storage materials and catalysts in pores of MOFs, the sample of Ti-doped nano-NaAlH4@MOF-74 exhibits an onset temperature for hydrogen desorption of ∼50 °C and releases 3.6 wt% in 2.5 h at 150 °C, which is similar to that of undoped nano-NaAlH4@MOF-74 (4.5 wt%) at 200 °C. Although the presence of titanium is not necessary for this increase in desorption kinetics, it enables rehydriding to be fully reversible, where it displays minimal capacity loss (from 4.1 to 3.6 wt% for hydrogen generation) in four dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation cycles under H2 pressure.123

In another report, Yu, Guo and co-workers also used dehydrated HKUST-1 as host for loading LiBH4 in ether solution.124 The dehydrogenation of LiBH4@HKUST-1 started from around 60 °C, which is lower than that for the pristine LiBH4 (380 °C). After heating up to 200 °C, a total gas release of 4.8 mmol g−1 was observed for the LiBH4@HKUST-1 sample, indicating a partial decomposition of loaded LiBH4 below this temperature (7 mmol g−1 for a complete decomposition of the confined LiBH4 to H2). However, boric acid, the oxidative product, is produced during the process of LiBH4 decomposition. Interestingly, when loading LiBH4 into hydrated HKUST-1, the coordinated water molecules in HKUST-1 can react with LiBH4 to release H2 during the loading process at room temperature.
Nanoconfinement of chemical hydrides and their interaction with the active metal centers in MOFs are important. Compared with neat chemical hydrides, nanoconfined hydride@MOF materials show advantages for the improvement of hydrogen release thermodynamics and kinetics, lower operational temperature, and high purity of released hydrogen during pyrolysis. Up to now, the corresponding reports about hydride@MOFs are still scarce, which may be due to requirements for MOFs. For solid-state chemical hydride@MOF systems, the MOFs should have appropriate pore sizes, active metal sites, and especially thermal and chemical stability, which is the most important for application of MOFs in this field.
2.3 MOFs as catalysts, catalyst supports or precursors of catalysts for hydrogen generation from chemical hydrides
MOFs may prove to be very useful in catalysis, which can be divided into three aspects: (i) MOFs act as host materials for supporting catalysts;125–127 (ii) the framework itself acts as a catalyst, where its activity may be from metal centers, organic or pseudo-organic linkers and other functional groups from post-synthetic modification; and (iii) MOFs act as precursors of catalysts by framework decomposition.128–130
Chemical hydrides can release H2 rapidly in the presence of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts immobilized to MOFs.131–133 In 2011, we reported bimetallic Au–Pd NPs immobilized in mesoporous MIL-101 as efficient catalysts for the decomposition of formic acid for hydrogen generation.134 MIL-101 was chosen as a support because of its large pore sizes (2.9–3.4 nm), window sizes (1.2–1.4 nm) and its hybrid pore surface, which facilitates the encapsulation of metal NPs and the adsorption of the substrate formic acid inside the pores. We grafted the electron-rich functional group ethylenediamine (ED) into MIL-101 (ED-MIL-101) for improving the interactions between the metal precursors and the MIL-101 support. By using a simple liquid impregnation method, the resulting bimetallic Au–Pd NPs immobilized in the MIL-101 and ED-MIL-101 (Au–Pd/MIL-101 and Au–Pd/ED-MIL-101) represent the first highly active MOF-immobilized metal catalysts for the complete conversion of formic acid to hydrogen at a convenient temperature.
Then, our group reported highly dispersed Ni NPs (∼2.7 nm) immobilized by the framework of ZIF-8 by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical liquid deposition (CLD) approaches, followed by hydrogen reduction, to obtain CVD-Ni@ZIF-8 and CLD-Ni@ZIF-8, respectively.135 For CLD-Ni@ZIF-8, the hydrolysis of the AB reaction can be completed with the release of hydrogen of H2/AB = 3.0 in 19 min (Ni/AB = 0.019), corresponding to a TOF value of 8.4 min−1. The sample prepared by using CVD approach showed a higher activity, for which the reaction can be completed (H2/AB = 3.0) in 13 min (Ni/AB = 0.016), giving a TOF value of 14.2 min−1.
In order to avoid NP aggregation on the external surface of the MOF, we recently reported the use of a “double solvents” method, which is based on a hydrophilic solvent (water) and a hydrophobic solvent (hexane), the former containing the metal precursor with a volume set equal to or less than the pore volume of the adsorbent (MIL-101), which can be absorbed within the hydrophilic adsorbent pores, and the latter, in a large amount, playing an important role to suspend the adsorbent and facilitate the impregnation process (Scheme 2).119 Based on this efficient method, the Pt precursor was introduced into the MIL-101 pores, followed by hydrogen reduction. TEM and electron tomographic measurements clearly demonstrated the uniform three dimensional distribution of the ultrafine Pt NPs throughout the interior cavities of MIL-101 (Fig. 3). For the H2 generation by hydrolysis of aqueous AB (ammonia borane) at room temperature in the presence of 2 wt% Pt@MIL-101 catalysts (Pt/AB = 0.0029 in molar ratio), the reaction is completed within 2.5 min, corresponding to a catalytic activity 2 times higher than that of 2 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3, the most active Pt catalyst for this reaction reported so far. Pt@MIL-101 retains high catalytic activity after five runs.

The wide range of adjustable metal centers and their surrounding environments as well as a variety of organic or pseudo-organic linkers provide multiple opportunities to create various MOFs with different catalytic properties. A considerable number of catalytic reactions over MOFs have been reported,136,137 and here we only give some selected recent progress on the framework itself as a catalyst in hydrogen generation.
Li and Kim used ZIF-9 (ref. 138) (Co(PhIm)2·(DMF)·(H2O), PhIm = benzimidazolate) as a catalyst in NaBH4 hydrolysis for hydrogen generation for the first time.139 The initial hydrogen generation rate for the ZIF-9 catalyst is relatively slow due to the gradual formation of CoB active centers, and then it increases rapidly after the formation of CoB. The hydrogen generation rate at 40 °C can reach 3641.69 mL min−1 g−1 (Co). After five cycles, ZIF-9 maintains its basic structure and crystallinity, but the long range order of ZIF-9 was destroyed to a certain extent during the operation. In this case, metal centers (Co) form CoB active centers firstly, which can promote the NaBH4 hydrolysis. Thus, ZIF-9 plays two roles: a catalyst and a precursor for preparing the catalyst.
Very recently, ZIF-8 was employed as a catalyst for the pyrolysis of AB through solid-state mixing instead of confinement.140 AB/ZIF-8 shows a lower dehydrogenation temperature than that of neat AB, even if the content of AB increases to 90 wt%. Compared with the results of a nanoconfined sample of AB@ZIF-8-MeOH (immersing the AB in ZIF-8), it demonstrates that ZIF-8 acts as a catalyst. PXRD patterns of AB/ZIF-8 after dehydrogenation show no major changes in the ZIF-8 framework, indicating that ZIF-8 is stable during dehydrogenation and potentially reusable as a catalyst.
By efficient and mild in situ reduction using AB as a reducing agent141 in methanol, Li and co-workers prepared Ni NPs using a Ni-based MOF ([Ni(4,4′-bipy)(HBTC)], 4,4′-bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine) as a precursor.128 With the high reaction rate and low activation energy, the catalyst showed a high catalytic activity, with which the H2 release was completed within 5 min from aqueous AB solution (0.32 M) at room temperature. Furthermore, the catalyst can be recycled by centrifugal separation and reused for up to 20 cycles without obvious loss of activity. Then, by the in situ reduction with AB in methanol (MOF/AB = 0.02), two catalysts were obtained from MOF precursors [Ni(pyz)][Ni(CN)4] (pyz = pyrazine) and Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2.129 With three Ni0-based catalysts (1.0 mol%) from the precursors of the above-mentioned MOFs, the thermal decomposition of AB shows a significantly lower reaction onset temperature, a decreased activation energy and remarkably accelerated kinetics. At 80 °C, AB with MOF-based catalyst (prepared from [Ni(4,4′-bipy)(HBTC)]) released 7.5 wt% H2 in 2 h without any induction period. At 90 °C, 6.0 wt% H2 can be released from AB with the catalyst prepared from [Ni(pyz)][Ni(CN)4] within only 20 min. Recently, this group also prepared a highly active Co(0) catalyst by the same in situ reduction reaction using reducing agent NaBH4 by introducing the aqueous solution of AB from MOF precursor Co2(BDC)2(dabco) (dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).130 It is interesting that the active Co(0) sites, generated by reduction in the micropores and channels, are surrounded by the organic linkers and stabilized in the residue of the framework. The hydrogen generation from aqueous AB solution (0.32 M) was completed within 1.4 min (MOF/NaBH4/AB = 0.057:0.08:1) at room temperature.
2.4 MOFs for photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photochemical reduction of water into hydrogen molecules using a photocatalyst is not dependent on fossil fuels, and is therefore an ideal method for producing clean energy. Beside being active photocatalysts for the degradation of organic molecules and dye molecules,142 MOFs are also useful photocatalysts for the reduction of water into hydrogen molecules.143
In 2009, Mori and co-workers employed Ru-MOFs ([Ru2(p-BDC)2]n, Ru2(CH3COO)4BF4 and [Ru2II,III(p-BDC)2BF4]n) as hydrogen production catalysts (HPCs), which showed catalytic activity for the photochemical reduction of water into hydrogen molecules in the presence of light harvesting systems (LHSs) with photosensitizer (PS) Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), electron relay (ER) MV2+ (methyl viologen) and sacrificial donors EDTA-2Na (EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) under visible light irradiation (Scheme 3).144 The initial slopes of H2 evolution for the three photocatalysts (0.01 mmol) were measured to be 16.1 μmol h−1 for [Ru2(p-BDC)2]n, 1.58 μmol h−1 for Ru2(CH3COO)4BF4, and 7.33 μmol h−1 for [Ru2II,III(p-BDC)2BF4]n. After 4 h irradiation, 41 μmol H2 was produced by using [Ru2(p-BDC)2]n with the turnover number (TON) of 8.16, and the apparent quantum yield is 4.82% at 450 nm. Comparing the three catalysts, the evolution rate of H2 increased as follows: non-porous Ru2(CH3COO)4BF4 < porous [Ru2II,III(p-BDC)2BF4]n < porous [Ru2(p-BDC)2]n, indicating that a porous MOF is favorable for improving the activity of the photochemical water reduction.

Following this research result, another investigation of Ru-MOFs ([Ru2(p-BDC)2X]n, X = Cl, Br and BF4) by modification with different counter-ions as catalysts showed that the order of observed catalytic activity was as follows: Ru–Br > Ru–BF4 > Ru–Cl.145 The initial slopes of H2 evolution for Ru–Cl, Ru–Br and Ru–BF4 (0.005 mmol) were measured to be 5.55, 15.2 and 7.33 μmol, respectively. Prolonged irradiation led to an increase in H2 production. The most active catalyst [Ru2(p-BDC)2Br]n, showed the highest catalytic activity with 46.7 μmol H2 evolution and a TON of 18.7 after 4 h of irradiation. After the catalytic reaction, the Cl− and BF4− counter-ions disappeared and were substituted with EDTA, and only the Ru–Br catalyst maintained the coordination geometry between Ru and Br− counter-ions, implying that the catalytic activity of MOF with counter-ions altered noticeably when the counter-ions were manipulated by molecular catalysts, and the design of MOF catalysts required an adequate examination of counter-ions for the purpose of reaction.
In 2010, two Rh-MOFs ([Rh2(p-BDC)2]n and [Rh2(C6H5COO)4]) were used as hydrogen production catalysts for photochemical reduction of water under visible light irradiation in the presence of the above-mentioned multicomponent system containing Ru(bpy)32+, MV2+, and EDTA-2Na.146 After 10 h irradiation, prolonged irradiation led to increased H2 production; the total amount of hydrogen production reached 62.2 and 22.1 μmol based on [Rh2(p-BDC)2]n and [Rh2(C6H5COO)4] (0.005 mmol), respectively, which indicated that MOFs involving Rh2 active sites obviously have an advantage.
An interesting three-dimensional interpenetrated bimetallic MOF [Zn{Pd(INA)4}]n (INA = isonicotinate) was also used as a HPC in the same LHS. The initial slope of the H2 evolution for the HPC (0.005 mmol) was determined to be 37.3 μmol h−1 with a TOF of 14.9 h−1, and 70.6 μmol H2 gas was observed after 4 h irradiation. It exhibits a higher catalytic activity than that of the reference sample [PdII(H-INA)2(INA)2].147 Recently, Miyazaki et al. used another bimetallic MOF [Zn2(H2O)3{PdCl2(pydc)2}]n (H2pydc = 3,5-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid) based on the building unit of trans-[PdCl2(H2pydc)2], and 50.6 μmol H2 gas was observed after 4 h irradiation based on this catalyst (0.005 mmol). Its catalytic activity is higher than that of the corresponding building unit.148
Llabrés i Xamena and co-workers applied two notably water-stable Zr-containing MOFs (UiO-66: [Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)12] and UiO-66(NH2): [Zr6O4(OH)4(ATA)12]; ATA = 2-aminoterephthalate) as photocatalysts for H2 generation in methanol or water/methanol upon irradiation.149 The apparent quantum yield for H2 generation using monochromatic light at 370 nm in water–methanol (3:1) was 3.5% for UiO-66(NH2). When using the mixtures of platinum nanoparticles and Zr-containing MOFs as catalysts, maximum amounts of 2.4 and 2.8 mL of H2 generation were obtained after 3 h of irradiation over UiO-66 and UiO-66 (NH2) (45 mg), respectively. Although the apparent quantum yield is still low in this case, the finding triggers a new research line aimed at exploiting MOFs as semiconductors, particularly for water splitting.
In 2012, two non-interpenetrated water-stable porphyrin-based MOFs, Al-PMOF (H2TCPP[AlOH]2(DMF3(H2O)2, H2TCPP = meso-tetra(4-carboxyl-phenyl) porphyrin)) and Al/Zn-PMOF (Zn0.986(12)TCPP[AlOH]2), from post-synthetic chemical modification by porphyrin metalation of Al-PMOF were used for visible-light driven hydrogen generation from water.150 In two different hydrogen generation systems, MOF/MV2+/EDTA/Pt and MOF/EDTA/Pt (Fig. 4), H2 production at rates of 100 and 200 μmol g−1 h−1 for Al/Zn-PMOF and Al-PMOF (3.5 mg) was observed after an induction period of about 3 h, respectively. Repeated reactions with the same catalysts showed good reproducibility.

Another important investigation was made by Lin's group. Two stable, porous and phosphorescent MOFs (Zr6O4(OH)4(bpdc)5.94(L1)0.06 and Zr6O4(OH)4(L2)6·64DMF) (H2bpdc = biphenyldicarboxylic acid, L1 = IrIII(ppy)2(dcbpy), L2 = IrIII(ppy)2(dbzpy), ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, dcbpy = (2,2′-bipyridine)-5,5′-dicarboxylate, dbzpy = (2,2′-bipyridine)-5,5′-dibenzoate) were built from two [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+-derived (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) dicarboxylate ligands with short dcbpy and long dbzpy, and Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(carboxylate)12 secondary building units.151 Then, Pt nanoparticles of 2–3 and 5–6 nm diameter, respectively, were loaded into the two MOFs via MOF-mediated photoreduction of K2PtCl4 in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran/triethylamine/H2O (20:1:1 v/v/v) by ultraviolet light. The resulting Pt@MOF assemblies serve as effective photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution by synergistic photoexcitation of the frameworks and electron injection into the Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 5). Comparing the different ratios of K2PtCl4/Ir added in the reaction solution, the optimized Pt/Ir ratios in the MOF sample were 18.6 and 17.8 for the two Pt@MOFs, respectively (Fig. 5c). The two Pt@MOFs (based on 0.04–0.05 μmol of the Ir-MOF) gave the Ir-TONs (Ir-TON = n(1/2H2)/n(Ir)) of 730 and 1621 for the first cycle after 6 h using a 450 W Xe-lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter. Pt@MOF by the dbzpy ligand gave an Ir-TON of 7000 (Fig. 5d), approximately five times the value afforded by the homogeneous control [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]Cl/K2PtCl4 under their respective conditions, and could be readily recycled and reused. MOFs thus provide a versatile and tunable platform to hierarchically integrate different functional components for solar energy utilization.

Matsuoka and co-workers prepared a Ti-MOF-NH2 based on 2-aminobenzenedicarboxylic acid,152 which showed the isostructure with MIL-125.153 Then, Pt nanoparticles as co-catalysts were deposited onto Ti-MOF-NH2via a photodeposition process (Pt/Ti-MOF-NH2). When using 0.01 M triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor, the total evolution of hydrogen after 9 h visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) reached 33 μmol based on the catalyst of Pt/Ti-MOF-NH2 (10 mg) at room temperature.
Recently, Lin and co-workers developed a novel MOF-templated approach to synthesize a mixed metal oxide nanocomposite material by first creating core–shell particles and calcining to decompose the core.154 As shown in Scheme 4, this facile method produces crystalline octahedral nanoshells composed of hematite Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in anatase TiO2 with some Fe doping. With triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial reducing agent, the photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3@TiO2 material (0.5 mg: 5.0 μmol Fe and 1.25 μmol Ti) in combination with K2PtCl4 (3.70 μmol) for photoinduced hydrogen production from water show that the amount of H2 produced increases linearly during this entire time period, with a total of 30.0 μmol H2 per mg of material produced after 48 h. As a heterogeneous catalyst, Fe2O3@TiO2 can be recovered from a reaction mixture and reused with a fresh solution. This composite material has interesting photophysical properties as it enables photocatalytic hydrogen production from water using visible light, which shows more excellent properties than that in each component. In this case, MOF plays two roles. One is a template and the another is a precursor for Fe2O3. Combining multifunctional properties of MOFs in one reaction is thus an efficient way to kill two birds with one stone.

Polyoxometalates (POMs),155,156 a large family of soluble anionic metal oxide clusters of d-block transition metals in high oxidation states, constitute ideal building blocks as alternaives to metal ions for targeting new multifunctional POM-based MOF (POMOF) materials due to their redox and catalytic properties. One example is to use POMs instead of simple metal centers to obtain a POM-based MOF [H[{Ce(H2O)5}2{Ce(pdc)2(H2O)4}{Ce(pdc)3}(PW12O40)]·2H2O (pdc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate)], which is constructed from 2D cationic [{Ce(H2O)5}2{Ce(pdc)2(H2O)4}{Ce(pdc)3}]2+ layers pillared by α-Keggin [PW12O40]3− anions. The POM-based MOF, with a loading of 1.2 wt% Pt by in situ photoreduction using H2PtCl6 solution, shows photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution with an average rate of 3.4 μmol h−1 from 100 mL of 20% methanol solution with 0.1 g catalyst.157 Recently, Wang and co-workers employed an ionothermal method in the synthesis of POM-based porous material to obtain a 3D (TBA)2[CuII(BBTZ)2(α-Mo8O26) (TBA = tetrabutylammonium cation, BBTZ = 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene),158 which shows photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution with an average rate of 0.78 μmol h−1 under UV radiations in 100 mL 20% methanol solution by using 0.1 g POM-MOF as a catalyst and Pt NPs as co-catalyst.
2.5 Conclusions
MOFs are emerging as one of the most promising platforms for hydrogen storage and generation due to their adjustable pore size, and wide variety of selective metal centers and changeable linkers. However, there are still challenges in these fields: (i) how to improve the hydrogen adsorption at convenient temperatures; (ii) how to synthesize more MOFs with high thermal stability to nanoconfine chemical hydrides for pyrolysis to generate hydrogen; (iii) how to increase catalytic activity of MOFs for hydrogen production; and (iv) how to develop other methods for hydrogen production, such as an interesting electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction reported recently with electrodes fabricated using 3D POMOFs159 ((TBA)3[PMo8VMo4VIO36(OH)4Zn4][C6H3(COO)3]4/3·6H2O = ε(trim4/3)), which showed an activity higher than platinum. While there are some hurdles to overcome, more and more investigations show the advantages of MOFs in this field.
3 MOFs for fuel cells
A fuel cell is an electrochemical conversion device that has a continuous supply of fuel such as hydrogen, natural gas, or methanol and an oxidant such as oxygen, air, or hydrogen peroxide.160 Each fuel cell consists of an anode (negative side), a cathode (positive side) and an electrolyte that allows charges to move between the two sides of the fuel cell (Fig. 6),161,162 which offers a highly efficient way to use diverse energy sources and, as a result, has demonstrated lower energy use and emissions when compared with conventional technologies. The key technical objectives of the DOE are to develop a fuel cell system for portable power (<250 W) with an energy density of 900 W h L−1 by 2015, and to achieve a direct hydrogen fuel cell power system for transportation with a peak-efficiency of 60%, 5000 h durability and mass-produced cost of $30 kW−1 by 2017.163 There are remaining challenges aimed at achieving high efficiency and durability along with low material and manufacturing costs, which encourage improving the capacities of hydrogen storage and generation, electrode catalysis, proton conductivity of polymer electrolyte membrane, and so on. With uncoordinated metal sites, larger surface areas and higher pore volumes, MOFs exhibit various properties of redox, proton conduction, catalysis and so on. More importantly, MOFs can be prepared with high yields and from relatively cheap precursors, which make it possible to use MOFs as electrolytes and electrode catalysts for fuel cells.

3.1 MOFs as electrolytes for fuel cells
The PEM fuel cell is believed to be the most promising for transportation applications. Its operating temperature is near 100 °C with ultra low or zero emissions of environmental pollutants. The high proton conductivity is one of the important factors for evaluating a PEM. MOFs exhibit proton conductivity by the framework itself or by including protonic charge carriers (water, acids, heterocycles and so on) in their pores164 (Table 2).

Kitagawa, Nagao and co-workers, for the first time, employed dithiooxamide derivatives with Cu ions to synthesize a series of 2D MOFs, which can encapsulate different concentrations of guest water molecules and exhibit proton conductions from 10−6 to 1.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 27 °C with high relative humidity (RH > 75%).165–169 Then, Kitagawa and co-workers selected another 2D oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework [Zn2(ox)3]∞2− (ox = oxalate) as a host and introduced NH4+ into the pores as counter cations and adipic acid (adp) molecules to provide additional protons.170 This is the first example of a MOF ((NH4)2(adp)[Zn2(ox)3]·3H2O) to exhibit a super proton conductivity of 8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C and 98% RH. Encouraged by the results, they expanded to a series of oxalate-bridged bimetallic complexes {NH(prol)3}[MIICrIII(ox)3] (MII = MnII, FeII and CoII) with hydrophilic tri(3-hydroxypropyl)ammonium (NH(prol)3+).171 The frameworks show proton conduction from 1.2 × 10−10 to 4.4 × 10−10 S cm−1 under 40% RH and ∼1 × 10−4 S cm−1 under 75% RH and 25 °C. In 2011, another anionic oxalate-bridged bimetallic MOF [MnIICrIII(ox)3]4+ was reported by Train, Verdaguer and co-workers, which hosts ammonium cations and water molecules in functionalized channels and exhibits a proton conductivity of 1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature due to the guest molecules.172 A continuity of the work by Okawa, Kitagawa and co-workers was to investigate the influence of the hydrophilicity of the cationic ions with different substitutes on the proton conductivity of the 2D oxalate-bridged bimetallic complexes {NR3(CH2COOH)}[MCr(ox)3]·nH2O (R = Me (methyl), Et (ethyl), or Bu (n-butyl), and M = Mn or Fe; Me-FeCr, Et-MnCr, Bu-MnCr, and Bu-FeCr).173 The proton conductivity of the MOFs increased with increasing hydrophilicity of the cationic ions {NMe3(CH2COOH)}+ > {NEt3(CH2COOH)}+ > {NBu3(CH2COOH)}+. So the most hydrophilic complex (Me-FeCr) shows a high proton conductivity of ∼10−4 S cm−1 even at a low humidity of 65% RH and ambient temperature. Then, the isostructural Et-MOFs (Et-MnCr·2H2O, Et-FeCr·2H2O, Et-FeFe·2H2O) and Bu-MOFs (Bu-MnCr, Bu-FeCr, and Bu-FeFe) have been investigated by the same group.174 At 25 °C, the Et-MOFs and Bu-MOFs have similar conductivities of 3 × 10−11 and 1 × 10−11 S cm−1, respectively, at 45% RH. With increasing RH, the conductivities of the Et-MOFs increase sharply to ∼1 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 65% RH, and that of the Bu-MOFs increases less sharply to ∼1 × 10−7 S cm−1 near 85% RH, which also may be due to the influence of the hydrophilicity of the cations. Very recently, Horike and Kitagawa synthesized a 2D layer MOF ([Zn(H2PO4)2(Tz)2]n, Tz = triazole), in which partial deprotonated (H2PO4)− anions as terminal ligands coordinate to the Zn ion from both sides of the (Zn(Tz)2)n2+ layer and extend hydrogen bonds in the layers.175 This anhydrous MOF shows a proton conductivity of >10−4 S cm−1 at 150 °C without any guest supports and the proton transport occurs mainly in the ab plane, which demonstrates intrinsic proton conduction by the MOF itself. This important result offers promising prospects for creating proton conductors by framework itself of MOF as well as investigating the proton-hopping mechanism.
Very recently, Zhu and co-workers synthesized a chiral two-dimensional MOF, {[Ca(D-Hpmpc)(H2O)2]·2HO0.5}n (D-H3pmpc = D-1-(phosphonomethyl)piperidine-3-carboxylic acid), which possesses protonated tertiary amines as proton carriers and hydrogen-bonding chains serving as proton-conducting pathways.176 When fabricating a MOF–polymer composite (MOF–PVP-x, x = the percentage of MOF) by assembling polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with different contents of MOFs, MOF-PVP-50 (50% MOF in the sample) shows a proton conductivity at 25 °C ranging from 2.8 × 10−5 S cm−1 at ∼53% RH to 5.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 at ∼65% RH.
Some 3D porous MOFs based on sulfonate and phosphonate ligands are used as the preferred hosts to encapsulate guest molecules. In 2009, two important investigations were made by some independent groups. Shimizu and co-workers reported a proton-conducting MOF (PCMOF2, Na3(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate), α-PCMOF2: a lower temperature phase, and β-PCMOF2: a higher temperature phase) with triazole, which resulted in a significant enhancement of both the proton conductivity and the maximum operating temperature.50,51 They were also able to control the quantity of guest molecules within the channels, which enabled modulation of the conductivity and led to an optimal conductivity value of approximately 5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 150 °C in anhydrous H2 for the first time—higher than the conductivity of either pure PCMOF2 or pure triazole (Fig. 7). In addition, the partially loaded MOF (β-PCMOF2(Tz)0.45) was also incorporated into a H2/air membrane electrode assembly. The resulting membrane proved to be gas tight, and gave an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100 °C. Then they investigated a phosphonate PCMOF-3 (Zn3(L)(H2O)2·2H2O, L = [1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonate]6−), in which free water molecules arranged ordered chains.177 The proton conductivity is 3.5 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C and 98% RH, and the activation energy for proton transfer is as low as 0.17 eV. Very recently, they partially replaced Na3(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate) in the β-PCMOF2 with isomorphous 1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonate by making a pellet of α-PCMOF2 and pressing onto it a pellet of Na3H3(1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonate) at a proper temperature and humidity.178 When replacing one-third Na3(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate), PCMOF21/2 (Na3(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate)2/3(1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonate)1/3) was obtained, which showed a high conductivity of 2.1 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 85 °C and 90% RH. When changing 1,2,4,5-tetrakisphosphonomethylbenzene as a ligand, a new water-stable 3D La-based PCMOF-5 exhibited a proton conductivity of 4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 98% RH and 62 °C.179

Recently, Cabeza and co-workers employed flexible tetraphosphonates (hexamethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid) and octamethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid)) to construct La-based and Mg-based MOFs, which show a proton conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature and high RH,180,181 higher than that of zirconium tetraphosphonate.182 When they used a carboxyphosphonate instead of tetraphosphonate, a family of lanthanide MOFs were obtained, among which Gd-carboxyphosphonate material has a proton conductivity of 3.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 98% RH and 21 °C.183
Another impressive example of hybridized proton conductors under anhydrous conditions is encapsulation of a proton-carrier molecule—imidazole (Im)184 by sublimation based on host–guest interaction using aluminium compounds [Al(μ2-OH)(1,4-NDC)]n (1,4-NDC = 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate) and MIL-53(Al) (Al(OH)(BDC)(H2O)).52 The results show that the different values of conductivity of imidazole in two MOFs (Im@[Al(μ2-OH)(1,4-NDC)]n: 2.2 × 10−5 S cm−1, and Im@MIL-53(Al): 1.0 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 120 °C) are consistent with the dynamic properties of imidazole adsorbed in the pores, which is due to the properties (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) of pores and the interactions of pores and guest molecules (Fig. 8). The same group reported a further study, in which they selected histamine instead of imidazole as a proton conductor by immersion into hosts of [Al(μ2-OH)(1,4-NDC)]n.185 The proportion between guest molecules and metal ions of hosts in histamine@[Al(μ2-OH)(1,4-NDC)]n is twice as large as the proton carrier in Im@[Al(μ2-OH)(1,4-NDC)]n (mol/mol), which results in a remarkable improvement of conductivity of over 10−3 S cm−1 at 150 °C under anhydrous conditions. This material is regarded as a superionic conductor and the porous MOF supports are promising for the creation of hybrid conducting materials.

Recently, histamine molecules were introduced in the pores of Zn-MOF-74 by immersing and refluxing the mixture of dehydrated Zn-MOF-74 and histamine.186 The low proton conductivity of 4.3 × 10−9 S cm−1 at 146 °C for histamine@Zn-MOF-74 may be caused by the low mobility of histamine in the framework, limiting the proton hopping between imidazole rings.
The proton conductivities of a series of isostructural MIL-53(M) (M = Al or Fe; Al(OH)(BDC)(H2O), Al(OH)(BDC–NH2)(H2O), Al(OH)(BDC–OH)(H2O)1.5, and Fe(OH)(BDC–(COOH)2)(H2O)) with different substitutions of amino, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups in organic linkers were discussed by Kitagawa and co-workers.187 As shown in Fig. 9, the order of proton conductivities observed for the substituted MIL-53 derivatives (–NH2 < –H < –OH < –COOH) and those of the activation energies (–NH2, –H > –OH > –COOH) correlate well with the order of the pKa values of meta-substituted benzoic acids (R = –NH2, –H, –OH, and –COOH: 4.74, 4.19, 4.08, and 3.62), respectively. This is the first example in which proton conductivity has been widely controlled by the substitution of ligand functional groups in an isostructural series of MOFs.

In 2012, Farha, Hupp and co-workers discussed the influences of node-coordinated molecules and pore-filling solvents in MOFs on proton conductivities.188 The post-synthesis modification of HKUST-1 via coordination of H2O at open CuII (node) sites led to a large (∼75-fold) enhancement in proton conductivity relative to a version containing nodes modified by acetonitrile once the material's channels were infused with MeOH. Then, the conductivity became almost immeasurably small when methanol was replaced by hexane as the pore-filling solvent (Fig. 10).

For MIL-101, the (1 − x)CsHSO4−x@Cr-MIL-101 nanocomposite system, assembling proton conductors of CsHSO4 in pores of MOF, has a proton conductivity of 10−7 to 10−2 S cm−1 over the temperature range 50–200 °C and a chemical stability up to 190 °C.189 The unusual behavior of CsHSO4 in the nanospace of Cr-MIL-101 deals with the appreciable interface interaction and disordered state of the salt in the nanospace of the mesoporous Cr-MIL-101, which causes the conductivity increase. Very recently, Ponomareva et al. reported the proton conductivities of H2SO4@MIL-101 and H3PO4@MIL-101 by the impregnation of MIL-101 in non-volatile acids H2SO4 and H3PO4.190 The conductivities at T = 150 °C are 1 × 10−2 S cm−1 for H2SO4@MIL-101 and 3 × 10−3 S cm−1 for H3PO4@MIL-101 with RH of 0.13%, respectively, which are greater than those of any other MOF-based compounds and could be compared with the best proton conductors, such as Nafion. By a post-synthetic functionalization method, the framework of MIL-53(Al) was sulfated up to 50% by reaction with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and H2SO4 in nitromethane as solvent at room temperature.191 At 20 °C and 100% RH, the sulphated MIL-53(Al) material shows a proton conductivity of ca. 0.3 S m−1.
Besides these classic MOFs, some new porous MOFs have been reported as hosts for proton conductivities. Banerjee and co-workers investigated the influence of hydrogen bonds between halogen atoms and hydrogen atoms from water molecules in the 1D channels on proton conductivity of four homochiral MOF isomers, [Zn(l-LCl)(Cl)](H2O)2, [Zn(l-LBr)(Br)](H2O)2, [Zn(d-LCl)(Cl)](H2O)2, and [Zn(d-LBr)(Br)](H2O)2 (L = 3-methyl-2-(pyridin-4-ylmethylamino)butanoic acid).192 MOFs [Zn(l-LCl)(Cl)](H2O)2 and [Zn(d-LCl)(Cl)](H2O)2 show proton conductivities of 4.45 × 10−5 and 4.42 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively, higher than the other two MOFs, which is attributed to the fact that [Zn(l-LCl)(Cl)](H2O)2 has a higher water holding capacity than [Zn(l-LBr)(Br)](H2O)2. Another porous MOF [{(Zn0.25)8(O)}Zn6(L)12(H2O)29(DMF)69(NO3)2]n (H2L = 1,3-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)imidazolium) based on Zn8O clusters and imidazolium-based ligands has been synthesized by Kitagawa, Bharadwaj and co-workers.193 Its proton conductivity increases with an increase of humidity and reaches 2.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at ambient temperature and 95% relative humidity.
In addition, it has been found that some 1D coordination polymers can also exhibit proton conductivity.194–198
3.2 MOFs as electrode catalysts for fuel cells
Today, a large challenge in the fuel cell field is to find high efficient non-platinum group metal (NPGM) catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) at the cathode instead of platinum-based catalysts with high costs and limited reserves, and corresponding catalysts used at the anode.199–202
The water-stable Cu-based MOF (copper(II)-2,2′-bipyridinebenzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) as a NPGM catalyst for ORR shows a couple of well-defined redox peaks at ca. −0.15 V in a phosphate buffer (pH 6.0).203 The presence of O2 in the buffer clearly increases the reduction peak current, while it decreases the reversed oxidation peak current of the redox wave. With the positive shift of the potential for ORR at the MOF-modified electrode compared with that at the bare graphene carbon electrode, this demonstrates the electrocatalytic activity of the Cu-bipy-BTC MOF towards ORR through an almost four-electron reduction pathway.
A graphene–metalloporphyrin MOF ((G-dye–FeP)n) has been synthesized by the use of pyridine-functionalized graphene (G-dye) as a building block with iron–porphyrin (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyl)-Fe–porphyrin)204,205 in the assembly of a MOF, because iron porphyrins play a vital role in oxygen transport and reduction reactions.206 The addition of G-dye changes the crystallization process of iron–porphyrin in the MOF, increases its porosity, and enhances the electrochemical charge transfer rate of iron–porphyrin, and (G-dye–FeP)n exhibits interesting catalytic activity towards the ORR in alkaline medium with a facile four-electron ORR pathway.
The first and important example of the utilization of a noble-metal-free MOF material, N,N′-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dithiooxamidatocopper(II), as an electrocatalyst for ethanol electrooxidation reactions was demonstrated by Kitagawa's group.207 This MOF was coated on a glassy-carbon electrode, and cyclic voltammetry showed one redox peak centered at 0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl and ascribed to CuI/CuII in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (Fig. 11). With an increasing ethanol concentration, the current density increased continuously. Electrolysis with controlled potential (0.39 V) combined with gas chromatography analysis shows the oxidation of acetaldehyde (2 electron oxidation).

3.3 MOFs as precursors of catalysts for fuel cells
In 2011, Liu and co-workers reported the experimental demonstration of porous MOF as a new class of precursors for preparing NPGM electrode ORR catalysts.208 The reported 3D MOF of [Co(Im)2·0.5DMA]∞ (ref. 209) (DMA = N,N-dimethylaniline) was employed as a precursor with the potential to produce a uniformly distributed catalytic center Co–N4 (M–Nx was suggested to be the active ORR sites210,211) and high active-site density. The MOF was active for the preparation of NPGM catalysts through pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere at 750 °C, with an onset potential of 0.83 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode and the electron transfer mechanism characterized by 3.2–3.5 electrons per O2 molecule, which is comparable to the best cobalt-based NPGM catalysts. Lefèvre, Dodelet and co-workers reported that the ZIF serves as a microporous host for phenanthroline and ferrous acetate to form a Fe-based catalyst precursor, which was ball milled, pyrolyzed twice, first in argon at 1050 °C, then in ammonia at 950 °C, to form a nitrogenated microporous carbon structure hosting FeNx active sites.212 A cathode made with the optimized Fe/N/C electrocatalyst, tested in H2–O2, has a power density of 0.75 W cm−2 at 0.6 V. The unprecedented catalytic activity and power density of these new Fe-based catalysts bolster the prospect of a viable alternative to Pt-based cathode catalysts in PEMFCs. Another work is the use of 3D [Fe3(Im)6(ImH)2]x (FeIM)213 as a precursor to prepare electrocatalysts by pyrolysis, acid-washing, pyrolysis again under a flowing NH3 atmosphere to give the final products FeIM700, FeIM800 and FeIM900 based on the pyrolysis temperature (700, 800 and 900 °C), respectively.214 To study the effect of ZIF-8, the catalyst named FeIM/ZIF-8 was prepared by ball-milling the FeIM and ZIF-8 mixture with different ratios between them followed by using the above-mentioned pyrolysis conditions.212 The catalytic property of FeIM/ZIF-8 as the cathode is better than that of the FeIM system, which shows an onset potential of 0.977 V and a measured volumetric current density of 12 A cm−3 at 0.8 V in a single cell test.
3.4 Conclusions
Fuel cells, working without polluting the environment, are clean and green cells, which are recognized as a clean energy technology. However, there are still some significant challenges, such as increasing efficiency, energy and power densities, improving reliability, and reducing cost. MOFs, with low cost and various properties, can act as electrolytes, electrode catalysts and catalyst precursors by adjusting the structures to obtain the optimized materials for fuel cells.
4 MOFs for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries
A lithium-ion battery (Li-ion battery or LIB)215–217 is a rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge, and back when charging, where it uses an intercalated lithium compound as the positive electrode material. The three primary functional components of a lithium-ion battery are the negative electrode (anode)218,219 positive electrode (cathode)220 and the electrolyte221,222 that conducts lithium ions. LIBs are used in all sorts of mobile devices (mobile phones, notebook PCs, electric vehicles and so on) because a small, lightweight battery can deliver lots of power. As of 2011, LIBs account for 66% of all portable secondary battery sales in Japan.223 Based on their excellent properties, MOFs have been investigated as electrode and electrolyte materials in LIBs.
4.1 MOFs as materials for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries
Based on their porous structure, uncoordinated sites and functional organic linkers, MOFs have been employed as LIB electrode materials based on reversible Li-ion insertion/extraction reaction.224,225 The MOFs with different metals investigated in LIBs so far can be classified into two types: non-Li-MOF and Li-MOF.
Non-Li MOFs can be used as electrode and electrolyte materials according to their structural properties. In 2007, Férey et al. first reported FeIII(OH)0.8F0.2(BDC)·H2O (MIL-53(Fe)),226 a MOF with higher oxidation state metal, as a rechargeable intercalation electrode successfully. The MOF mixed with 15 wt% carbon served as the positive electrode, and Li-foil was used as the negative electrode.227 A maximum capacity of Li insertion in the cathode reached x = 0.6 for LixFeIII(OH)0.8F0.2(BDC)·H2O during discharge, which gives a gravimetric capacity of 75 mA h g−1. The results of Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis showed that only the FeII and FeIII ratio in the material varied with the Li uptake. The composition was identified as mixed-valence Li0.5Fe0.45IIFe0.55III at x = 0.5 and the process is reversible as demonstrated by in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS).228 However, the cyclability was limited at high energy density due to the poor electronic conductivity of the MOF, which was rationalized in terms of interactions between Fe3+ and Fe2+ sites without any electronic delocalization.229 Density functional theory (DFT) study of the detailed mechanism of Li-insertion in the same material showed four different sites for Li insertion in the framework based on the amount of Li uptake.230,231 In order to enhance the electrochemical capacity of MIL-53(Fe), Tarascon and co-workers introduced a guest organic electroactive molecule such as 1,4-benzoquinone within its framework, but the extra capacity, unfortunately, faded rapidly upon cycling.232 In addition, redox active organic linkers were also selected to construct MOFs for positive electrodes of LIBs, but the desired result was not achieved.233
In 2011, Tarascon employed mesoporous chromium trimesate MIL-100(Cr) (Cr3O(H2O)F(BTC)2)234 as a host of cathode material in Li–S batteries.235 The 48% S was impregnated within the pores of MIL-100 by melt-diffusion at 155 °C to obtain MIL-100(Cr)/S@155, which was ball-milled with different amounts of carbon to form cathode materials. Among them, the MIL-100(Cr)/S@155 with 50% carbon additive (MIL-100(Cr)/S@155 + 50% C) shows a relatively high initial capacity and capacity retention after 60 cycles. Comparing with different host materials with various pore sizes and shapes, mesoporous carbon/S@155 composite and SBA-15/S−1@155 + 50% C (SBA-15 mesoporous silica) show a higher initial capacity than MIL-100(Cr)/S@155 + 50% C. However, mesoporous carbon/S@155 exhibits the lowest capacity after 32 cycles and the capacity decay of MIL-100(Cr)/S@155 + 50% C is relatively slower than the other two, as shown in Fig. 12. This is caused by the small size of the pore windows in MIL-100, which can confine more polysulphides in the pores of MIL-100 than the other hosts. It is worth noting that the confinement effect caused by the use of a nanoporous self-supporting S matrix is very important in Li–S batteries. Therefore, the structural flexibility and adjustable pore size of MOFs provides more space for battery performance improvement.

Non-Li-MOFs were also tested as anode materials. MOF-177 (Zn4O(BTB)2, BTB3− = 1,3,5-benzenetribenzoate) was applied in reversible lithium storage, but the result exhibited a relatively high irreversible capacity in the first discharge process and a much lower reversible discharge–charge capacity in the following electrochemical cycles, which proved the decomposition of MOF-177.236 In 2010, a series of diamondoid MOFs (Zn3(HCOO)6, Co3(HCOO)6 and Zn1.5Co1.5(HCOO)6) were employed for the Li storage using conversion reaction at low potential. Among them, the anode material of Zn3(HCOO)6 shows an invariable capacity of 560 mA h g−1 (9.6 moles of Li) for up to 60 cycles with a 60 mA g−1 charging rate within the voltage range 0.005–3.0 V.237 With ex situ PXRD, FTIR and TEM studies, the electrochemical cycling suggests that metal formate frameworks react reversibly with Li through conversion reaction, according to reactions (1) and (2): Zn3(HCOO)6 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 3Zn + 6HCOOLi(1) 3Zn + 3Li+ + 3e− ↔ 3LiZn(2)
During the charge, MOFs react with Li+ to form Zn nanoparticles, and then Li–Zn alloy, which plays a vital role in attaining the superior Li storage performance. During the discharge, MOFs are regenerated by alloy slipping back to metal nanoparticles which in turn form zinc formate MOFs. The materials based on Co3(HCOO)6 and Zn1.5Co1.5(HCOO)6 show capacities of 410 and 510 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles, respectively, without the formation of alloy. This work demonstrates that robust, thermally stable MOFs are a prospective class of electrode materials for LIBs. Another anode material ZTO/ZIF-8, formed by ZIF-8 coating on the surface of Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) nanoparticles, was prepared by Wei's group. They added as-prepared ZTO nanoparticles in the methanol solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate with 2-methyl imidazole to obtain ZTO/ZIF8-10, ZTO/ZIF8-20 and ZTO/ZIF8-30 by controlling the growth time.238 The capacities of ZTO, ZIF8-10, ZIF8-20 and ZIF8-30 are 109.6, 349.2, 265.7 and 177.8 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles, respectively, which indicates the conductivity of electrode material can be greatly increased after the surface of ZTO nanoparticles was coated by ZIF-8. Copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu3(Fe(CN)6)2) shows the excellent electrode performance, which can be cycled for over 40000 charge/discharge cycles at 17C rate and retain 83% of the initial capacity (52.2 mA h g−1). Even at a very high cycling rate of 83C, two thirds of its maximum discharge capacity is observed.239,240
For non-Li-MOFs as electrolyte materials, it is found that MOFs can display a high conductivity. In 2011, Long and co-workers evaluated the conductivity of MOF-177,241 Cu–BTTri (H3BTTri = 1,3,5-tris(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)benzene),242 and Mg-MOF-74 soaked in a 1 M solution of LiBF4 in a 1:1 volume mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC), and the impregnated frameworks showed conductivities with an order of 10−9 to 10−6 S cm−1.243 The most promising material is Mg-MOF-74 functionalized with lithium alkoxide (LiOPr: Li isopropoxide, LiOMe: Li methoxide or LiOEt: Li ethoxide), where coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+ cations bonded by alkoxide anions make Li ions move freely. The uptake of LiOiPr in Mg-MOF-74 followed by soaking in a typical electrolyte solution (in a 1 M solution of LiBF4 in a 1:1 mixture of EC and DEC) leads to the optimized solid lithium electrolyte Mg2(DOBDC)·0.35LiOiPr·0.25LiBF4·EC·DEC (Fig. 13), which shows a high conductivity of 3.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at ambient temperatures. The foregoing results demonstrate a promising new approach for creating solid lithium electrolyte materials244 by using MOFs.

Li-based MOFs are considered as a good candidate for electrode materials. Tetrahydroxybenzoquinone, including electrochemically active CO functionalities, shows equilibrium between carbonyls and enolates. Dolhem, Poizot and co-workers used the Li salt of tetrahydroxybenzoquinone (Li2+xC6O6) as a cathode material, showing a high capacity of 580 mA h g−1 for x = 0, which demonstrated the feasibility of sustainable LIBs with MOFs as electrode materials.245 Then they also investigated Li4C6O6, which can be both reduced to Li2C6O6 and oxidized to Li6C6O6.246 The results show the electrochemical performances vs. Li with a sustained reversibility of 200 mA h g−1 at an average potential of 1.8 V, which can construct a LIB with the cycles between Li2C6O6 and Li6C6O6. Because of no crystal structures of Li2+xC6O6, Goddard, Kang and co-workers predicted the Li ion sites in Li4C6O6 as an organic cathode material through first-principles multi-level computational methods, which is beneficial to the design of the electrode materials with high capacities.247 Encouraged by these results, systematic lithiated electrode materials based on benzoquinone, 2,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione, 1,5-dihydroxy anthraquinone and their derivatives were investigated in detail.248–251 However, the reported crystal structures of Li-based MOFs as electrode materials are still scarce.252–254 In 2008, Sun and co-workers confirmed the crystal structure of [Li2(C6H2O4)·2H2O] based on the linker of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone.255 The anhydrous Li2(C6H2O4) was used as an electrode material and showed an initial discharge capacity of 176 mA h g−1 with a columbic efficiency of 93.18% in the first cycle, and 137 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles. In 2009, Tarascon and co-workers prepared Li-based MOFs by the reaction of conjugated dicarboxylic acid and LiOH or Li2CO3 in ethanol–water medium (terephthalic acid: Li2C8H4O4 or Li2TPA, and muconic acid: Li2C6H4O4).256 For Li2TPA,257 each Li ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from different ligands to extend to a 3D MOF.258 By ball-milling powders of Li2C8O4H4 and Li2C6O4H4 with 30 wt% carbon black as electrodes, they have overall uptake capacities of 2.3 and 1.2 Li per formula unit at potentials of 0.8 and 1.4 V, and show reversible capacities of about 300 and 170 mA h g−1, which slowly decay to values of about 234 and 125 mA h g−1, respectively. The first-principles calculations for Li2TPA show that the storage of Li in the organic salts is different from traditional battery materials by utilizing multiple valences of the organic groups, which involves breaking the aromatic p-bond in the benzenoid ring and regrouping the electrons into a set of new p-bonds with a low Li diffusion barrier. (Li2(OBA) (H2OBA = 4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid)),259 [Li6(PDA)3]·2EtOH (H2PDA = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate),260 (Li2TDC) (H2TDC = 4,4′-tolane-dicarboxylate),261 LiO2C(CH = CH)nCO2Li (n = 1, 2, 3 and 4),262 pyromellitic diimide dilithium salt263 and so on, based on conjugated carboxylate acid ligands and their derivatives (different substituents, the length of conjugated chains, conformations etc.), have shown capacities of 100–200 mA h g−1. The corresponding investigations have also been extended to sodium ion batteries.264–267
4.2 MOFs as precursors of materials for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries
Transition metal oxides, which can react with Li reversibly via the conversion reaction (eqn (3)), exhibit high reversible capacities at a relatively low potential as anode materials.268,269 MOFs can act as precursors for preparing metal oxides, microporous carbon materials and metal-oxide carbon composites. MxOy + 2yLi+ + 2ye− ↔ xM + yLi2O(3)In 2010, we, for the first time, developed a MOF route for synthesizing agglomerated Co3O4 nanoparticles, with a diameter of around 250 nm, consisting of smaller nanoparticles with a size of about 25 nm, by converting cobalt oxide subunits in a cobalt-MOF (Co3(2,6-NDC)3(DMF)4) via pyrolysis method in air (600 °C) (Fig. 14).270 An electrode was formed by mixing 85 wt% Co3O4 nanoparticles, 5 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which exhibited a reversible capacity of 965 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. This agglomerated Co3O4 favors the enhanced capacity, improved rate capability and prolonged cycle life as an electrode material for LIB. By controlling the agglomerated structures with varied primary and secondary particle sizes, the Co3O4 electrode performance for LIB can be further improved. Li et al. reported porous Co3O4 nanowires by pyrolysis (450 °C) of Co(NA)H (NA = nitrilotriacetic acid), which exhibits a reversible capacity of 810 mA h g−1 and stable cyclic retention until the 30th cycle.271 The porous nanostructure of Co3O4 provides pathways for easy accessibility of electrolytes and fast transportation of lithium ions.

Recently, spindle-like porous α-Fe2O3 was prepared from the precursor of MIL-88-Fe (Fe3O(H2O)2Cl(BDC)3·nH2O)272 by Cho's group, where MIL-88-Fe was first heated at 500 °C in N2 gas to obtain black FeOx–C composite, then calcinated at 380 °C in air to get the final dark red α-Fe2O3 (removal of carbon residue).273 As shown in Fig. 15, the spindle-like porous α-Fe2O3, consisting of clustered Fe2O3 nanoparticles with sizes of <20 nm, shows the dimensions of length and width of 0.8 and 0.4 μm, respectively. This material was mixed with 10 wt% Ketjen Black and 10 wt% PVDF to form an electrode, which showed a capacity of 911 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C. Even at a rate of 10 C, a comparable capacity of 424 mA h g−1 could be reached. Then a higher capacity of 950 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 was reported by Lou's group.274 By utilizing the simultaneous oxidative decomposition of Prussian blue microcubes (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3) and crystal growth of iron oxide shells, they prepared Fe2O3 microbox anisotropic hollow structures with various shell architectures. As an anode material for LIBs, it shows an excellent cycling performance besides the high specific capacity.

Very recently, hierarchical CuO butterfly sheet-like nanostructures and hollow CuO nanotubes were obtained by thermal treatment of the precursors, which basically preserved the morphology of the precursors: butterfly-like Cu(C6H4NO2)2(H2O)4 nanosheets and [Cu(C6H4NO2)(OH)]H2O nanorods (C6H5NO2 = isonicotinic acid).275 Compared with commercial CuO, the initial discharge capacities of CuO nanosheets and 1D nanostructures were calculated to be 813 and 933 mA h g−1, respectively (337 mA h g−1 for commercial CuO), and the discharge capacities retain 555 and 688 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 30 cycles (182 mA h g−1 for commercial CuO). The results show that the discharge capacity of the CuO samples would be affected by the morphology of the samples. Thus, preparing metal oxide materials from MOFs is an effective method for LIBs application.
On the other hand, a combination of mixed-metal oxides, showing a good capacity, is regarded as anode materials in Li-recyclability.276 Courtel et al. prepared a series of mixed-metal oxide AMn2O4 (A = Co, Ni, and Zn) by calcining the precursors generated from oxalic acid, transition metal acetate and manganese(II) acetate.277 Among them, ZnMn2O4, showing better performance compared to its single metal oxides, Mn2O3 or ZnO, is regarded as a potential high-performance anode material because of its low cost, environmental benignancy, low operating voltages and high energy density. Recently, Yang, Li, and co-workers developed a two-step process to prepare flower-like ZnMn2O4 by thermal transformation of nanoscale mixed metal–organic frameworks (MMOFs) as precursors.278 MMOFs were firstly synthesized by hydrothermal reaction with two kinds of metal acetates, NaOH and ptcda (perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride), and then spinel ZnMn2O4 was obtained by treating MMOFs in air at 450 °C. By mixing 75 wt% active ZnMn2O4, 15 wt% acetylene carbon black and 10 wt% PVDF as electrode, the overall capacities for the first discharge and charge are as high as 1277 and 730 mA h g−1, respectively, an irreversible capacity of 547 mA h g−1, and a retained capacity of 502 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles, which might be caused by the unique architecture of assemblies of nanoplates consisting of well-crystallized agglomerated nanoparticles. Based on the above results, mixed-metal oxides, obtained by calcination, show a porous structure which can enhance the electrolyte/ZnMn2O4 contact area, shorten the Li+ ion diffusion length, and accommodate the strain induced by the volume change during the charge and discharge cycles.
4.3 Conclusions
Now, LIBs are commonplace. Although rapid developments have been made for LIBs, there are still some challenges, such as electrode materials with a fairly good structural stability and minimal volume change over the entire operational Li insertion/extraction voltage range, electrode integrity over many discharge–recharge cycles, improved capacity, good cell cycle life, electrolyte with fully compatible with lithium metal, more environmentally sustainable materials and so on. MOFs have shown feasibility and great potential in LIB applications either as electrode materials or electrolytes. Integrating the advantages of MOF materials into traditional battery materials would be beneficial for battery research and development. The corresponding investigation is still ongoing.
5 MOFs as platforms for supercapacitors
Different from fuel cells and batteries, an electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC), also called a supercapacitor, is a device that stores electrical energy in the electrical double layer that forms at the interface between an electrolytic solution and an electronic conductor.279 It consists of electrodes (mostly activated carbon with a very high surface area), an electrolyte (aqueous, organic solution or ionic liquid), and the separator, which prevents facing electrodes from contacting each other. The properties of the electrode materials280 are important factors for the supercapacitors, where the excellent electrode materials show high conductivity, high surface-area range, good corrosion resistance, high temperature stability, controlled pore structure, processability and compatibility in composite materials, and relatively low cost.281–284 Inheriting some of the above-mentioned properties from MOFs or their derivatives, by using MOFs as precursors, suggests that MOFs are excellent candidates for the electrode materials for supercapacitors.
5.1 MOFs as electrode materials
Recently, two research groups employed as-synthesized MOFs as electrode materials. Co8-MOF-5 (Zn3.68Co0.32O(BDC)3(DEF)0.75) has been used as an electrode material (Co8-MOF-5/carbon black/polytetrafluoroethylene with 75:15:10 wt%) in an electrolyte composed of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile. However, the capacitance values are low (0.49 F g−1 at 25 mV s−1 from cyclic voltammetries, and 0.30 F g−1 at 10 mA g−1 from charge/discharge curves when referred to total mass of the electrode).285 Almost at the same time, another Co-MOF composed of Co2+ and terephtalic ligands was ground with polyethylene glycol (PEG), ethanol and deionized water, and the blended semi-liquid paste was doctor-bladed on an indium tin oxide conducting glass substrate.286 The doctor-bladed film was annealed at 250 °C to decompose the PEG used as an organic binder in the film, and the resultant material showed a specific capacitance of 206.76 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 in 1 M LiOH electrolyte. These two results show that the as-synthesized MOFs are feasible to apply as electrode materials for supercapacitors, and metal ions, ligands, structures and other factors may work together to influence the capacitance of the devices.
5.2 MOFs as templates and/or precursors for electrode materials
MOFs can be employed as templates and/or precursors for preparing porous carbons and metal oxides, which have been used as the electrode materials of supercapacitors with high performances.
In 2008, we, for the first time, employed a MOF as a template to prepare nanoporous carbon (NPC), where a MOF-5 framework was used as template and furfuryl alcohol (FA) as carbon precursor.287 Firstly, as shown in Fig. 16, FA molecules were introduced in a three-dimensional intersecting channel system of MOF-5 through vapour deposition, where FA molecules were polymerized. Then we obtained different carbon materials by pyrolysis at different temperatures in argon. The carbon material obtained at 1000 °C showed BET surface area as high as 2872 m2 g−1. During the carbonization process, the MOF-5 framework decomposed, behaving as a self-sacrificed template and precursor and resulting in the formation of the nanoporous carbon with a large pore volume and high specific surface area. When using the as-synthesized nanoporous carbon as an electrode material (electrolyte, 1.0 M H2SO4) for EDLC, it showed a capacitance of 204 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1, which is higher than that of carbon materials synthesized from SBA-15.288 The specific capacitance was maintained as high as 258 F g−1 even at a current density of 250 mA g−1 (Table 3). Thus, the nanoporous carbon materials from MOFs have excellent electrochemical properties as electrode materials for EDLC.289 We also introduced the carbon precursor FA into the pores of MOF-5 by employing the incipient wetness technique instead of vapour deposition.290 The BET surface areas for samples obtained by carbonizing at temperatures from 530 to 1000 °C (NPC530, NPC650, NPC800, NPC900 and NPC1000) fall into the range from 1141 to 3040 m2 g−1 and the dependence of BET surface areas on carbonization temperatures shows a “V” shape. All the samples have a pore size distribution centered at about 3.9 nm. The highest specific capacitances are observed for the carbon obtained at 650 °C with a value as high as 167 and 222 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 and a current density of 50 mA g−1 (electrolyte, 1.0 M H2SO4), respectively. The corresponding decomposition mechanism of MOF-5 has been demonstrated by Zhang and Hu.291 Hu et al. prepared porous carbon materials (MC, MPC and MAC) through the direct thermolysis of MOF-5 without or with phenolic resin or carbon tetrachloride and ethylenediamine as the additional carbon sources, and then these carbon materials were activated by KOH to further tune the pore structures and textures (MC-A, MPC-A and MAC-A).292 The results show that only porous carbon materials from additional carbon sources (carbon tetrachloride and ethylenediamine) have an increasing BET surface area after KOH activation (before: 384 m2 g−1; and after: 2222 m2 g−1), which also shows the largest capacitances of 274 and 168 F g−1 at a current density of 250 mA g−1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. Recently, Zhan and co-workers synthesized 3D hierarchical porous carbons with different surface areas from pyrolysis of MOF-5 using glucose as the additional carbon sources by changing the reaction time.293 When the reaction time was 5 h, the pore size of the carbon was mainly centered at 0.8 and 1.5 nm. However, the pore size of the resultant carbon increased, and mesopores with sizes of 2–10 nm and macropores exceeding 50 nm could also be observed with the increase in reaction time (7, 15 and 20 h). The BET surface areas also changed from 823 to 1224 m2 g−1, and the highest initial specific capacity was 175 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 in 1 M NEt4BF4/propylene carbonate electrolyte. Another example is that a series of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) are synthesized from MOFs as a precursor and glycerol as a carbon source, and the pore size distribution and BET surface area can be modulated by adding different amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O.294,295 These HPC materials show electrochemical properties with the specific capacitance from 185 to 241 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in aqueous solution of 6 mol L−1 KOH.

In 2011, we prepared nanoporous carbon material (C800 and C1000) from highly porous ZIF-8 as both a precursor and a template and furfuryl alcohol as the second carbon source.296 By changing the calcination temperature (800 and 1000 °C), the surface areas (2169 and 3405 m2 g−1) of the resultant carbon materials can be tuned simply. As shown in Fig. 17, the specific capacitance is 200 F g−1 at a current density of 250 mA g−1 (electrolyte, 1.0 M H2SO4). It was also revealed that direct calcination of ZIF-8 at 1000 °C resulted in the formation of carbon with a surface area as high as 3184 m2 g−1.296 After chemical activation using KOH with a carbon/KOH weight ratio of 1:4 at 700 °C for 1 h, ZIF-templated carbons undergo enhancement of their porosity, and a sample carbonized at 900 °C has the highest increase with BET surface area from 933 to 3188 m2 g−1.297 Recently, Banerjee and co-workers also demonstrated that carbon materials from pyrolysis of isoreticular ZIFs (ZIF-68, ZIF-69 and ZIF-70) with furfuryl alcohol carbon sources showed the increasing BET surface areas compared with the corresponding ZIF precursors.298 Yamauchi, Ariga and co-workers reported a series of nanoporous carbons (Z-700, Z-800, Z-900 and Z1000) with different BET surface areas (520–1110 m2 g−1) through direct carbonization of a commercially available ZIF-8 without additional carbon sources by adjusted calcination temperature (700–1000 °C).299 Three of them show the capacitances from 112 to 130 F g−1 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (electrolyte, 0.5 M H2SO4).

Al-based MOF is an excellent candidate as a template and/or precursor for preparation of porous carbon materials.300–302 Yamauchi and co-workers introduced FA into pores of Al-based MOF (Al(OH)(1,4-NDC)·2H2O)303 as precursors, which were carbonized under an inert atmosphere to prepare microporous carbon fibers with an increase in the BET surface area (178–513 m2 g−1) upon increasing the loading amount of FA.301 The same group applied the direct carbonization of Al(OH)(1,4-NDC)·2H2O under protection of an inert gas from 500 to 800 °C. The samples were washed with a HF solution to remove the Al component, and showed a highest surface area of 5500 m2 g−1.302
Beside these well-known MOFs, other MOFs have also been used as templates and/or precursors for porous carbon materials.304–306 In 2010, Zhou and co-workers prepared two mesoporous carbons (MgC and BaC) by simple pyrolysis of commercial magnesium or barium citrate and tested as electrode materials with specific capacitances of 180 and 171 F g−1 in an ionic liquid (EMImBF4 = 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) electrolyte, and 173 and 169 F g−1 in aqueous electrolyte at 500 mA g−1.304 Recently, mesoporous graphitic carbon nanodisks (C-S700, C-S900, C-C1700 and C-C1900) were fabricated via catalytic carbonization (700 and 900 °C) of Fe-based MOFs constructed by 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and different iron salts.305 Then the carbonization products were washed in an acid solution and showed the special capacitance of 70–182 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte.
As mentioned above, many factors, such as structures, pore sizes, stability of MOFs, additional carbon sources, calcination temperature and so on play fundamental roles in the formation of the final carbon materials. These factors work together and have a significant effect on the morphology, particle sizes, pore types and properties as electrode materials for supercapacitors. It is a feasible method to preparing pore carbon materials as electrode materials based on MOFs.
Apart from porous carbons, porous metal oxides can also be prepared from MOFs. Nano/micro Co3O4, with the particle size between 30 and 50 nm, were prepared from solid-state annealing of MOF precursor (Co(BDC)2H2)n at 450 °C in air, which shows a BET surface area of 21.5 cm2 g−1, and an average pore size of 28.8 nm.307 The porosity of Co3O4 nano/micro superstructures is beneficial for the rapid contact of electrolyte ions to the large surfaces of the electroactive Co3O4 materials. By using as an electrode material of supercapacitors, it exhibited a specific capacitance of 208 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and a specific capacitance retention of 97% after 1000 continuous charge–discharge cycles in 6.0 M aqueous KOH solution.
5.3 Conclusions
With improving the properties of electrode materials, supercapacitors have been widely used in various fields as a renewable energy storage device. As the shortcomings, such as power only being available for a short duration, low capacity, low energy density and so on, limit the promotion of supercapacitors, it is still a challenge to develop the electrode materials with high specific surface areas, suitable pores, low internal electrical resistances, good cycling performances and low costs, for which MOFs, as demonstrated above, are promising platforms.
6 MOFs as platforms for solar cells
Sunlight is free, and solar energy conversion represents a promising route to green and renewable energy generation. Solar cells are a photoelectric conversion device.3,308 Among them, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC),309,310 a photoelectrochemical system based on a semiconductor formed between a photo-sensitized anode and an electrolyte (Fig. 18), has attracted great interest as a potential candidate of “low-cost solar cells” toward the solution of global energy demand with a new record power-conversion efficiency of 12.3%.311 Semiconducting materials are important compositions in solar cells. Lots of results on the use of MOFs as semiconductors have been reported from theoretical calculations and experiments, such as Zn4O(2,6-NDC)3-(DMF)1.5(H2O)0.5·4DMF·7.5H2O (UTSA-38, 2,6-NDC = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate)142 and so on.312–314 These results have demonstrated that the band gaps of MOF itself as a semiconductor can be adjusted by changing metal types, the sizes of metal oxide clusters, coordinating atoms from linkers and so on.315–323 Combining with the photoresponse of MOFs,324 the advantages of MOFs make it possible to use them in solar cells.

In 2007, a device using as-synthesized MOF-5 as the active material was prepared by Garcia and co-workers, which was deposited onto a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode with a layer area and thickness of 1 × 1 cm and 50 μm, respectively, and its performance was tested in a rudimentary photovoltaic cell without sensitizing dyes and electrolyte. The results show voltage at open circuit VOC = 0.33 V, current ISC = 0.7 μA, and fill factor FF = 44%, which demonstrates MOF-5 as an active component in photovoltaic cell.325 Then they also used Al2(BDC)3 as a semiconductor to build photovoltaic cells and demonstrated that Al2(BDC)3 including 1,4-dimethoxybenzene with the lowest thickness (2.7 μm) showed the better efficiency (VOC = 0.36 V, current density JSC = 36 μA cm−2, and FF = 40%) than that without guest molecules.326
In 2011, Li et al., for the first time, used ZIF-8 to coat TiO2 with different thicknesses for use as electrode materials in DSSC by immersing TiO2 in a fresh methanol solution containing 1 mM Zn(NO3)2 and 2 mM 2-methyl imidazole from 0 to 40 min.327 Among them, the thickness of thin ZIF-8 film coated on TiO2 is about 2 nm after a growth time of 30 min. Then TiO2/ZIF-8 was immersed in 0.3 mM ethanol solution of various dyes for 3 h to sensitize the electrode material. The open circuit voltage of DSSC was enhanced with increasing the thickness of the ZIF-8 coating layer. As shown in Fig. 19, the value of VOC increased from 29 to 66 mV for the D205 (2-((E)-5-(1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydro-4-(4-(2,2-diphenylyingyl)phenyl) cyclopenta[b]indole-7-yl)methyl)-3-octyl-5-(3-carboxymethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)rhodanine), black dye ([RuL(NCS)3]·3TBA, L = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl-4,4′,4′′-tri-carboxylic acid and TBA = tetra-n-butylammonium), C101 (2-ethylhexanoic acid cobalt(II) salt), N719 (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)) and D131 ((E)-2-cyano-3-(4-(4-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)phenyl)-1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-7-yl)acrylic acid), respectively, which was not caused by the change in the conduction band edge of TiO2 due to its possible coordination with 2-methyl imidazole, as demonstrated by Mott–Schottky measurements. However, the short circuit current decreased with the introduction of ZIF-8 shell material; with a significant increase in the adsorbed dyes on the TiO2/ZIF-8 electrode, the core/shell structure inhibited the injection of electrons from dyes into the conduction band edge of TiO2. Recently, Sahoo, Banerjee and co-workers calcined two Zn-based homochiral MOFs (based on valine) with different halogen anions at 800 °C in air or N2 to obtain rod-shaped, hexagonal column-shaped, and elliptical aggregation of ZnO morphologies, which were used to prepare ZnO films with a thickness of 12 μm by the doctor-blade method, annealing at 450 °C and coating with sensitizer (N719 dye).328 The DSSC activity measurements showed power conversion efficiencies as low as 0.15 and 0.14% for ZnO derived from the two MOFs in air, and no DSSC activity was detected for that prepared in N2 due to poor conductivity and crystallinity of the carbon present in as-synthesized ZnO samples.

The quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC)329–331 is considered to be a simple analogue of a DSSC. The difference is the replacement of the organometallic or organic dyes with QD sensitizers. A MOF is treated as a light-sensitive semiconductor, and the second building unit of the metal oxide cluster can be considered as a discrete QD analogue, which is stabilized and interconnected by the conjugated organic linkers acting as the photon antenna.
In 2004, Bordiga et al. testified that the Zn4O13 cluster in MOF-5 behaves as a ZnO quantum dot (QD) by UV-Vis DRS and photoluminescence spectroscopy, combined with excitation selective Raman spectroscopy.332 The organic part acts as a photon antenna able to efficiently transfer the energy to the inorganic ZnO-like QD part, where an intense emission at 525 nm occurs. Inspired by this result, studies about MOFs as QDs and as hosts for encapsulating different QDs in the pores have been carried out.333–337
In 2011, Falcaro et al. used highly luminescent CdSe–CdS–ZnS QDs to modify nanostructured poly-hydrate zinc phosphate microparticles, which acted as nucleation seeds for growing MOF-5.334 Recently, another luminescent multishell CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs within MOF-5 was achieved through a one-pot method. The QDs were dispersed into the DMF and DEF solvents by two-step solvent exchanges, and then were added in the mother batch of MOF-5 precursors for growing QD@MOF-5, in which it retained the framework's highly crystalline morphology although the QD size is noticeably bigger than the MOF-5 cavities.325 By Fisher's group, ZIF-8 was employed as a host to confine quantum dots gallium nitride and zinc oxide in its pores by annealing ZIF-8 including metal precursors, which were introduced by chemical vapor deposition.336,337
Very recently, Wiederrecht, Hupp and co-workers reported two porphyrin-based MOFs: F-MOF ([5,15-dipyridyl-10,20-bis(pentafluorophenyl)porphinato]zinc(II)) and DA-MOF ([5,15-bis[4-(pyridyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II)).338 Fluorescence quenching experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the photogenerated exciton migrates over a net distance of up to ∼45 porphyrin struts within its lifetime in DA-MOF (but only ∼3 in F-MOF), with a high anisotropy along a specific direction. The long distance and directional energy migration in DA-MOF suggests many promising applications of this compound or related compounds in solar energy conversion schemes as an efficient light-harvesting and energy-transport component. Then they modified the exterior surfaces of two porphyrin-based MOFs with CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs by chemical bonds for the enhancement of light harvesting via energy transfer from the QDs to the MOFs.339 The photoexcitation of the QDs is followed by energy transfer to the MOFs with efficiencies of 84% by tuning the size of the QDs. This sensitization approach can result in a >50% increase in the number of photons harvested by a single monolayer MOF structure with a monolayer of QDs on the surface of the MOF.
As one of the most viable clean energies, the research of solar cells develops rapidly, although it started relatively late compared with other energy applications. MOFs, with the photoresponse, semiconductor, and quantum dot properties, have been tried for use in solar cells. These results show that MOFs, as multi-functional materials, are beneficial for applications in solar cells. Because the application of MOFs to solar cells is in its infancy, there is a long way to go for us to optimize the excellent properties of MOFs to enhance the efficiency and performance of solar cells.
7 Conclusions and perspective
Today, there is a growing concern related to clean energy, which will become our most important energy source in the future, because of the serious issues arising from the use of large amounts of fossil fuels and consequent non-renewable energy depletion and environmental pollution. MOFs can show various properties by adjusting their structural characteristics through carefully selecting metal ions or metal clusters and multi-functional linkers. MOFs show their own merits in each of the above-mentioned fields, such as low costs, simple synthesis methods, controllable structures and versatile properties and functions. Here, we reviewed MOFs as platforms for clean and renewable energy. For hydrogen energy, MOFs show high hydrogen sorption capacities, whereas it is still quite difficult to store hydrogen by physisorption in porous materials at convenient temperatures. While chemical hydrogen storage with MOFs is another efficient way, the stability of MOFs needs to be considered during hydrogen generation (pyrolysis and hydrolysis). For fuel cell, Li-ion renewable battery and supercapacitor applications, MOFs as hosts, catalysts and catalyst precursors have been widely reported with the corresponding proton conductivity, catalysis, redox properties and so on, however, there is still a long way to go towards their industrialization in these three fields. The investigation into MOF applications for solar cells started lately and the corresponding reports are still scarce.
A large number of MOF-based materials with high chemical and thermal stabilities, and excellent properties have been reported. How best to apply the existing MOF-based materials to clean energy is one of our major aims, while another target is how to synthesize new MOFs by optimizing metal ions or clusters, organic linkers, synthesis conditions and so on to provide more excellent MOF candidates for the clean energy applications. Presently, the investigation of MOFs as platforms for clean energy is still in its infancy. Further efforts in this field will certainly contribute to the development and practical applications of future clean and renewable energy. Especially, the applications of MOFs in solar cells will be one of the research focuses in the future. It will be exciting to watch the rapid development of such new materials in the years to come.
We have tried to present an up-to-date overview of such a rapidly growing field, while the subject is very active and many papers are contributed each year (even during the writing of this article) from chemists, energy, environmental and materials scientists, etc. Therefore, it is hard to take into account all publications in this field in limited pages. We apologize here if some significant contributions were left out.

Broader context
With increasing environmental pollution and energy shortages, a major scientific and societal challenge is the conversion from a fossil fuel-based energy economy to a sustainable and clean one. Clean energy, such as solar, has a much lower environmental impact than conventional energies and will not run out, which is rapidly becoming a global issue. Different kinds of technologies have been used to convert and store energy from clean energy, such as hydrogen fuel cells, Li-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells and so on. At the same time, various materials have been optimized to increase energy storage and conversion efficiency. MOFs, with high yield and low cost, are promising candidates for application to clean energy based on their high surface area, adjusted pore sizes, controllable structures, low densities and so on. In this review, we present a survey on the research progresses for MOFs as platforms in hydrogen storage, fuel cells, Li-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells.
