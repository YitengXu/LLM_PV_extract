    , Accepted 1st December 2017First published on 1st December 2017AbstractThiophene-bridged and thiazole-bridged diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymers for near-infrared (near-IR) photovoltaic applications have been investigated via density functional theory (DFT) and Marcus charge transfer theory. Compared with thiophene-bridged DPP polymers, thiazole-bridged polymers have higher ionization potentials (IPs) but poorer optical absorption and worse charge transport capability. Different beneficial substituents replaced the hydrogen atoms (H) on the thiazole rings for the sake of reversing the disadvantages of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers and making these compounds better near-infrared absorbing materials. In order to gain deep insight into the impact of π-bridge modification on the photoelectronic properties of DPP polymers, their electronic structures, absorption capabilities, intramolecular charge transfer properties and charge transport performances have been analyzed. The calculated results reveal that π-bridge modification is a feasible way to improve the light-absorbing capability, electron excitation properties and charge transport performance of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers. It is expected that π-bridge modification can also work for other polymers containing π-bridge units. We hope that our research efforts will be helpful in the designing of new near-IR absorbing materials and could motivate further improvement of organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered as a next-generation green technology1 because of their environmental friendliness, lightweight, flexibility, low-cost and solution processability.2–5 In the past few decades, benefitting from the joint efforts of synthetic chemists and theoretical chemists, the performances of OSCs have been significantly improved.5–7 Recently, the best photovoltaic devices that utilize medium band gap polymers have achieved an efficiency of up to 12.05%,8 which is close to the threshold for commercial application.9 Though such devices have already achieved tremendous success, their optical absorption usually does not extend to the near-infrared region.10,11 Taking full advantage of that unused part of the solar spectrum may be conducive to the further improvement of photovoltaic device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for use in industrial production, and this calls for designing new ultra-small band gap materials that possess strong spectral responses in the near-infrared region.11 The materials meeting the requirements are rare, and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymers are an outstanding species among them owing to their high charge carrier mobilities and less complex synthesis and other advantages.12 Generally, DPP polymers consist of the following three principal building blocks: a DPP core, a π-bridge unit and a donor moiety (see Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Basic structure of DPP polymers. 
The strong electron-donating capability of thiophene can provide DPP polymers with absorption onsets in the near-IR region, so thiophene-bridged DPP polymers are quite common in the near-IR OSC field.11,13,14 For example, through copolymerization of thiophene-bridged DPP with dithienopyrrole (DTP), Koen H. Hendriks and coworkers synthesized PDPPTDTPT (P1)10 in 2014, which coupled with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]-PCBM) provided a PCE of 3.8% and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 50% at 1000 nm. However, thiophene-bridged DPP polymers have low ionization potentials and small optical band gaps (Eg), which led to large energy losses (Eloss) and small open-circuit voltages (Voc), and hence small PCEs, for the resulting photovoltaic devices. The development of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers has solved this problem. In 2015, Weiwei Li and coworkers using thiazole as a π-bridge synthesized PDPP2Tz-DTP (P2),15 which offered a PCE of 5.6% with a high Voc of 0.69 V but a smallest Eloss of 0.59 eV. Such a brilliant performance convincingly indicates that thiazole-bridged DPP polymers are a promising near-IR absorbing material.
However, this kind of material is not flawless. In comparison to the analog with thiophene as a π-bridge (that is, P1), thiazole-bridged DPP polymers (P2) have poorer optical absorption and charge carrier transport capability, which is associated with the difference of their π-bridge units;10,15 in addition, the matched acceptor PCBM has relatively weak absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and limited tunability of its electronic and optical properties,16 the drawbacks which constrain the performances of these devices. Hence, modulating the orbital energy levels of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers to make these polymers better match other excellent acceptors is imperative. Substituting the donor moiety in the polymer backbone, which is the most common approach to designing new donor or acceptor material molecules,17–19 can do that, but such a replacement would bring a lot of uncertain factors into the morphologies of blends. Particularly, in view of the favorable morphological features exhibited by the blends containing P2, the effect of the adjustment method on the morphological characteristics should be minimized.
With these concerns, we decided to choose the method of π-bridge modification, which is substituting the remaining hydrogen atoms (H) on thiazole rings with the electron-donating group, methyl (Me), or the electron-accepting fluorine atom (F), in this work, to regulate the intrinsic properties of the thiazole-bridged DPP polymers and make these polymers better near-IR absorbing materials (see Fig. 2). Both Me and F have been reported not to impose much steric hindrance on the intermolecular packing.20–23 Moreover, their opposite electronic effects could help us to have a closer examination of π-bridge modification's capability of energy level regulation. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no precedent research about how chemical modification on the π-bridge units would affect the photovoltaic performances of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers. We intend to explore this subject in our work via quantum chemistry calculations, an economical and accurate tool which is widely used in the field of materials science,24 thereby establishing the structure–property relationships of DPP polymers and elucidating the role and characteristics of π-bridge modification. We expect that the study of this method can also shed some light on the fundamental research of all polymers containing π-bridges and help in the development of near-IR OSCs.

2. Computational details
To find the most suitable functional and model to describe the system of interest, we used four representative functionals to tentatively optimize the ground-state geometry of the experimental molecule P1 based on both the monomer and the dimer model. A planar equilibrium geometry has been tacitly admitted. Alkyl side chains are added for the purpose of increasing the solubility of polymers, and their lengths have little effect on the electronic structures of polymers, so we substitute all the flexible side chains with methyl groups to save computational cost. The results are obtained and the HOMO levels are given in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen from Table S1 (ESI†) that the HOMO energy levels predicted by the B3LYP,25,26 PBE027 and M0628 functionals are much higher than that derived in the experiment, whether based on the monomer model or the dimer model. And the HOMO energy level of P1 predicted using the BMK functional with the dimer model is basically the same as the experimental value (−5.20 eV and −5.26 eV). Thus, we applied the dimer model to the geometric optimization of all the compounds in this work at the BMK/6-31G(d) level. Vibration analysis indicates that the optimized geometries have no imaginary frequency, being the local minimum structures.
On the basis of the optimized ground-state geometry, we used different functionals and basis sets to calculate the vertical excitation energies of P1 for precisely simulating its absorption spectrum. The obtained results are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). It can be seen from Table S3 (ESI†) that the absorption spectra predicted by TDDFT-TPSSH29 show a maximum absorption wavelength most similar to the experimental results, and also exhibit a consistent peak shape with the reported plot, so we invoke this method in the absorption spectral simulation below.
The band gap of the polymer could be reasonably approximated as the first singlet excitation energy,30 then the LUMO energy level was obtained from the equation,31–33ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,TD. However, getting the accurate transition energy is not easy. It is generally accepted that extrapolating the linear fit of the HOMO–LUMO gap against the reciprocal of the number of monomer units (1/n) provides a prediction of the band gap for the corresponding polymer, but fails to take into account the saturation of optical transition energies with increasing chain length. In this work, the band gaps were extrapolated at the polymer limit from the oligomer values (i.e., from dimer to tetramer) by W. Kuhn's expression34,35 for more accurate prediction, and the energies of the electronic levels thereof are thus expected to be in the small error region. All of the above calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 software package.36
At room temperature, hopping is the dominant mechanism for charge carrier mobility in organic semiconductor materials. In order to assess the charge transport capacities of materials, the semi-classical Marcus charge-transfer theory was used to estimate the charge hopping rate in films. The charge hopping rate (k) between two molecules can be expressed as:37,38 (1)where ℏ is the Dirac constant (reduced Planck constant, h/2π), V represents the electronic coupling, λ denotes the reorganization energy, KB indicates the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin (298.15 K). The reorganization energy is defined as the energy difference between the charged and neutral systems at the two optimized geometries. The electronic coupling (V) that goes into the Marcus theory can be calculated from the Marcus–Hush model; it is defined as:39–41 (2)where ε, S and J are the site energies, the spatial overlap and the charge transfer integral, respectively. The calculation of the reorganization energy is slightly complicated. The reorganization energy can be divided into two parts, the inner sphere contribution (λint) and the outer sphere contribution (λext).42,43
Under normal circumstances, we ignore the external reorganization energy to focus on the internal reorganization energy. Generally, the reorganization energy is composed of internal and external contributions. The internal reorganization energy can be defined as follows:44,45 λ± = λ1 + λ2 = E±(M0) − E±(M±) + E0(M±) − E0(M0)(3)where λ± represents the hole reorganization energy or the electron reorganization energy, E±(M0) represents the energy of the charged molecule in its optimized neutral geometry, E0(M±) is the energy of the neutral molecule in its optimized charged geometry, E±(M±) is the energy of the charged molecule in its optimized charged geometry and E0(M0) is the energy of the neutral molecule in its optimized neutral geometry.
With the charge hopping rate (k), we could calculate the charge mobility (μ) via the Einstein equation. The Einstein relation is expressed as:46,47 (4)where D is the key parameter, the charge diffusion coefficient, which can be approximately evaluated as:48,49 (5)where d represents the spatial dimensionality and is taken as three, i denotes a specific charge transfer pathway, ri is the charge hopping centroid to the centroid distance and pi indicates the hopping probability  for the corresponding transfer pathway i. In this work, we only calculate the mobility of one dimer extracted from the crystal, so that eqn (5) can be further simplified to:50,51 (6)Thus, combined with eqn (4), the charge mobility (μ) can be expressed as:52,53 (7)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic structure
As for π-conjugated polymers, the delocalized frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) go hand in hand with the charge carrier transport properties. Generally, the more the delocalized FMO, the faster the charge carrier transport. This is because delocalization can reduce the intramolecular reorganization energy and increase the electronic coupling of adjacent molecules.54 As shown in Fig. 3, all the polymers shared analogous FMO (including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) distribution diagrams: the HOMOs are spread on the whole molecule (over the DTP, DPP and adjacent bridge units), while LUMOs are mainly localized on the DPP and the adjacent bridge units. Compared with the distributions of LUMOs, the HOMOs are more delocalized for all the studied polymers, which denotes that FMO delocalization is more favorable for the hole transport than the electron transport.54 Overall, the substituent groups on the thiazole rings had no obvious influence on the distributions of FMOs, but did cause some minor changes. The electron-donating capacity of the Me group made the HOMO wave function of P3 have larger values on the thiazole rings, while the F atoms were directly involved in the formation of the HOMO of P4; both of them are in favor of polymers possessing more delocalized HOMOs.
 Fig. 3  Spatial distributions of FMOs for all polymers. 
As prerequisites for ideal near-IR absorbing donors, suitable FMO energy levels are crucial to guarantee a strong photo-response in the near-IR solar spectrum and the occurrence of a photo-induced electron transfer process.10 Therefore, appropriate chemical modification must possess the ability to precisely manipulate the orbital energy levels of material molecules to let them absorb solar radiation at longer wavelengths or adapt to different acceptors. We visualized the FMO energy levels of all the polymers through their images to directly observe their energy level arrangement and the impact of π-bridge modification. The HOMO levels, LUMO levels and band gaps of all the polymers are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Energy diagram. 
As shown in Fig. 4, the calculated frontier molecular orbital energy levels and band gaps of P1 and P2 are just a little different from the experimental data, which enables us to believe that the computational methods we used can accurately predict the electronic structures of the newly designed polymers P3 and P4. Because the electron-donating methyl group could reduce the ionization potential and the electron affinity (EA) of the polymer, both the HOMO and LUMO levels of P3 are increased in comparison to those of P2. Moreover, the HOMO level is increased more than the LUMO level (the HOMO level increases by 0.1 eV and the LUMO level increases by 0.07 eV), which means compound P3 has a smaller band gap so that it can absorb the solar radiation at longer wavelengths. As for P4, since the LUMO is mainly localized on the DPP unit and the adjacent bridge units, the substitution of F would have a greater effect on the LUMO. Thus, the HOMO slightly decreased by 0.04 eV, while the LUMO drastically decreased by 0.1 eV, causing P4 also to have a smaller band gap than P2. The results of FMO analysis suggest that π-bridge modification can effectively fine-tune the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers and make them better match to those of different acceptor materials.
3.2 Absorption properties
Among the three parameters that determine the performance of solar cells, the short-circuit current density (JSC) is most affected by the material's absorption properties. JSC has a simple functional relationship with light-harvesting efficiency, internal quantum efficiency, and spectral illuminance of incident light:55 (8)among them, the light-harvesting efficiency can be expressed as56,57η = 1–10−f, and f is the oscillator strength. The better the absorption properties of the material molecules, the greater the JSC will be. Polymer P2 has a lower JSC than polymer P1, and we know that this is directly related to its poor absorption properties. Consequently, we wish to specifically enhance thiazole-bridged polymers' absorption properties by means of π-bridge modification. The results of our modification were predicted via the TD-DFT method, pending detailed discussion. We collected the main parameters in Table 1.

As exemplified in Table 1, the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) for P1 (885 nm) and P2 (916 nm) are broadly similar to the experimental results. This suggests that using the TDDFT-TPSSH method to stimulate the molecular spectra of the investigated compounds has certain rationality. The maximum absorption peaks of all polymers correspond to the transitions originated from the ground state (S0) to the first excited state (S1). And because all the dominant compositions of the transitions are H → L, which take up over 95% (P1: 99%, P2: 96%, P3: 98% and P4: 97%), this kind of transition can be entirely attributed to the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO. The maximum absorption peak of P1 has the largest oscillator strength, so it has the highest light-harvesting efficiency (0.9985); that of P2 has the smallest oscillator strength, so its light-harvesting efficiency (η) is also the lowest (0.9936). Additionally, P3 and P4 have approximately equal oscillator strengths, which are slightly lower than that of P1 and higher than that of P2, therefore the light-harvesting efficiencies are 0.9968, somewhere in the middle. Strikingly, compared with the extrapolated results the band gaps provided by the dimeric model alone are farther from the real values (i.e., P1: 1.23 eV, P2: 1.28 eV), upon assuming the same tendency. Such a decreasing trend is opposite to the variation trend of their maximum absorption wavelengths, which means the absorption spectra of P3 and P4 would have a remarkable red-shift.
The simulated absorption spectra of all studied polymers are depicted in Fig. 5 to facilitate the visual comparison of absorption capability. As shown in Fig. 5, the extinction coefficients of maximum absorption peaks are in the order of P1 > P4 > P3 > P2, which is the same as the sequence of the oscillator strengths (P1: 2.8373 > P4: 2.4962 > P3: 2.4925 > P2: 2.1939) shown in Table 1. In addition, compared with the absorption spectrum of P2, those of P3 and P4 are broader. This can be verified by the parameter of normalized integrated area (S) in the absorption spectrum with the integrated spectrum area of P2 as a reference. According to S listed in Table 1, the integrated spectral absorption areas of all compounds are in the order of P4: 1.33 > P3: 1.09 > P1: 1.03 > P2: 1, so the modified compounds of P3 and P4 showed more broader absorption spectra. In general, the polymer having a broad absorption coverage within the solar spectrum with high absorption intensity could provide a high JSC.58 These results indicate that after modifications, thiazole-bridged DPP polymers can absorb the solar radiation in the near-IR well. The gap in the light-harvesting performances of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers and their thiophene-bridged analogs has been bridged to some extent by means of the reasonable modification in the molecular π-bridge units.

3.3 Intramolecular charge transfer properties
From the previous spectrum analysis, we can see that the maximum absorption transition of all investigated polymers is from S0 to S1. Because of the donor–acceptor alternating connection in the polymer backbones, this kind of transition often has obvious charge transfer characteristics. During the excitation in the polymers, more electrons are transferred in the molecule, and correspondingly, more excitons are produced, which obviously contributes to the improvement of the short-circuit current density. The charge transfer distance is also an important factor, which is closely related to the dissociation of intramolecular excitons.24 In order to gain a more in-depth insight into the electronic transition and excitation properties of these polymers, we investigated the charge transfer (CT) process through the electron density difference plots of the excitation from the ground state to the first excited state.59 The two pivotal parameters described above are listed here to evaluate the degrees of charge transfer of these processes. All data are tabulated in Table 2.

Two different colors in the electron density difference plots denote the changes in electron density during the transition. Cyan represents the decrease, while purple represents the increase. From the four graphs in Table 2, we could see that all the polymers have similar charge transfer characteristics: electrons are transferred from the electron-rich moieties – DTPs to the adjacent electron-deficient moieties – DPPs. Moreover, since the interested transition is dominated by the HOMO and LUMO, an increased portion of the electrons must fall in the regions where the LUMO is distributed. This is consistent with the observed phenomenon in the electron density difference plots that the donor units—DTP—at the right end of the polymers almost have no purple distribution. Otherwise, we analyzed the crucial data. From the view of the charge transfer distance (ΔD), our modification has some flaws. Although P4 has the largest ΔD among all polymers, ΔD of P3 is smaller than that of P2. And the greater distance is more conducive to the dissociation of excitons. But from the perspective of the amount of transferred charge (Δq), our modification is considerably successful, because the sequence of the transferred charges is P1 (0.7963 e−) < P2 (0.8128 e−) < P3 (0.8171 e−) <P4 (0.8544 e−). The more the charges are transferred, the more the excitons will migrate to the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) interface for dissociating into free charges. As a whole, our modification is not perfect, but authentically beneficial to the charge transfer of DPP-based conjugated polymers.
3.4 Charge transport properties
Charge carrier mobility is a key parameter to assess the charge transfer process,31,42 which plays a vital role in the charge photogeneration process of OSCs. Generally, the higher the charge transfer efficiency the greater the charge carrier mobility. Fast charge transfer promotes a high short-circuit current density, a large fill factor (FF) and a high PCE. In order to quantitatively evaluate the charge transport performances of materials, the charge carrier mobilities were predicted. Previous studies have shown that the inherent triangular pyramid configuration of a nitrogen atom can lead to large intermolecular distances.60,61 This adverse effect on the morphology in conjunction with the poor optical absorption led P2 to have a low JSC and FF. However, due to the small difference between P1 and P2 with regard to the side chains on the DTP units, we cannot directly see the effect of the thiazole π-bridge on their morphology (the nitrogen atoms of P2 may give rise to an increase in intermolecular distances). Thus, consistent alkyl side chains are introduced into all studied compounds to eliminate any complication of the side chain effect on the transport properties.22,62,63 In this way, we could also explore the effect of π-bridge modification on the morphology.
As both the observed blends of P1 and P2 in the experiments contain fibrous crystal structures according to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images,10,15 we calculated all the mobilities in the crystals. The method of predicting the crystal structure was confirmed by Hui-xue Li and coworkers64 and was used by other research teams,42,65 and it was also applied in this work. We used Materials Studio66 to calculate the crystal structures of all compounds. In the first place, a single molecule was optimized in the Dmol3 module using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Furthermore, the crystal structure was established in the Polymorph Predictor module using the Dreiding force field, which is considered to be the most reliable force field for molecular crystal prediction. Without prior knowledge of the crystal symmetry, we ran the calculations for the ten most common space groups, namely P21/C, P1, P212121, C2/C, P21, PBCA, PNA21, CC, PBCN and C2. The obtained crystal structures were ranked by their total energies and those with the lowest energies were selected to calculate the hole mobilities. It is worth mentioning that the theoretical models we used to represent the studied compounds are based on some sound approximations and simplifications, so the predicted crystal structures may deviate from the true ones. Hence, the main purpose of this work is not the precise description of charge transport, but to reveal the structure–property relationship between these compounds, and thereby elucidate the effect of π-bridge modification on the morphology. On the basis of the predicted packing motif, we chose a molecule as a carrier donor and regarded its adjacent molecules as paired elements so that we could center the dimer selections with respect to a fixed molecule (see Fig. 6). Such a procedure would be beneficial, as is well-known that some dimers are equivalent because of the periodic nature of the molecular crystal. And so we should identify the different types of dimers to find all of the charge transfer pathways in the center molecule without duplication. Central molecules with different charge transfer paths and center-of-mass distances r (Å) are shown in Table S5 (ESI†).

The average hole mobility () and related physical quantities of the main hopping pathways are listed in Table 3. Owing to their negligible effect on the charge mobility, the electronic couplings that were extremely small were ignored, so were the charge hopping pathways. However, it is notable that the final result (μ) is the average mobility of all different paths.

The first column data presented in Table 3 are the internal reorganization energies of all the polymers, which reflect the degree of molecular geometrical changes in the electron transfer process. The stronger the rigidity of the compound, the smaller the reorganization energy. And the increase in rigidity may be due to the enhancement of the molecular conjugation. In conjunction with the results of the FMO analysis, we can speculate that the sequence of reorganization energies of the polymers P1 to P4 is P1 < P4 < P3 < P2. This is consistent with our calculated results (P1: 0.374 eV, P4: 0.375 eV, P3: 0.393 eV and P2: 0.420 eV). As can be clearly seen from eqn (1), decreasing the reorganization energies can favor the increase of the charge transfer rate. Thus, the π-bridge modification gives the polymers stronger conjugations and charge transport properties.
Other physical quantities in the table, such as r, V, k and μ, are related to specific hopping pathways and are not easy to compare directly, so we could only say in general terms that P2, P3 and P4 have more dominant charge transfer paths (μ > 10−6 cm2 (V S)−1) than P1, which may lead to larger μ. And the average charge carrier mobilities (μ) are in the order of P1 < P4 < P3 < P2 (P1: 2.34 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 S−1, P2: 4.45 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, P3: 4.50 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, P4: 8.91 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1). The charge carrier mobilities of P2 and P3 are not significantly different. Hence, methyl groups did not impose considerable steric hindrance on the new polymer, but maintained a good morphology analogous to that of P2. However, the substitution of methyl groups assuredly reduced the molecular reorganization energy, which is reflected in the slight increase of P3's charge carrier mobility when compared to P2. As for P4, it has an average charge mobility two times that of P2 because of prevalently shorter charge transfer distances, universally greater electronic couplings and charge transfer rates. The phenomenon demonstrates that the substitution of a fluorine atom could shorten the π–π stacking distances and strengthen the electronic couplings. It also corroborates the previous studies20–22 that the substitution of the fluorine atom could augment hole mobilities. In any case, the charge transfer performance of the polymers modified with a π-bridge has been improved more or less. This makes us convinced that other π-bridge modifications, as long as appropriate, can reduce the charge recombination and contribute to the π–π stacking and electronic couplings between the adjacent units, and ultimately give rise to the improvement in the performance of organic photovoltaic materials.
4. Conclusions
In this contribution, based on past experimental molecules, we designed two new high-performance polymers P3 and P4via π-bridge modification. They have higher ionization potentials, and thus can provide larger open circuit voltages; they have excellent charge transfer performances, which is an essential feature for excellent solar cell semiconductors. In addition, they have stronger and broader absorption spectra in the near-infrared region. We consider the exploration of such polymers crucial for further improvement in the efficiencies of OSCs. There is no doubt that P3 and P4 are promising candidates for near-IR organic solar cells. What's more, we theoretically calculated the electronic structure, optical properties, intramolecular charge transfer properties and charge transport properties of P1, P2, P3 and P4 using DFT and Marcus theory, thereby summarizing the role and characteristics of π-bridge modification, which is itemized as follows:
(1) π-Bridge modification is an effective method to regulate the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers, and has some predictability. For example, the use of electron-donating groups would cause the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymers to increase, especially the HOMO energy levels; the use of electron-accepting groups would result in a decrease of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymers, particularly the LUMO energy levels.
(2) π-Bridge modification could modulate the optical absorption properties of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers. In this work, it made polymers P3 and P4 have wider and stronger absorption spectra, which is conducive to improving short-circuit current density.
(3) π-Bridge modification altered the intramolecular charge transfer properties of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers. The substitution of a fluorine atom enhanced the ICT properties of P4, thus resulting in improved charge transfer and longer charger transfer distance.
(4) π-Bridge modification could affect the charge transport capabilities of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers. It could reduce the internal reorganization energy or enhance the intermolecular coupling strength, resulting in better charge transport performance.
(5) Last but not least, the π-bridge modification is not just a replacement for the polymer building blocks, but a kind of subtle modification on the bridged units. π-Bridge modification is proposed for further improvement of device performance on the basis of replacement; in other words, it is the follow-up of replacement.
In summary, we have enlarged upon the photovoltaic performances of four D–π–A–π type DPP polymers to confirm the feasibility of the π-bridge modification method. Accurate reproduction of the experimental data ensures the reliability of our predicted results. We have reasons to believe that π-bridge modification is an effective way for adjusting the photoelectric properties of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers and even all polymers containing π-bridges. And we do hope that this research could provide some theoretical guidelines for further improving the performance of OSCs.
