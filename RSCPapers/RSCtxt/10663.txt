    , Accepted 27th March 2013First published on 28th March 2013AbstractThe influence of adding 0–5 mol% zirconia (ZrO2) to a series of melt-quenched alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses designed in the gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7)–akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) system has been investigated for their potential application as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The work was implemented with a dual aim of improving the sintering ability of the glass system under consideration and gaining insight into the structural changes induced by ZrO2 additions in the glasses consequentially leading to their enhanced long-term thermal stability. That the degree of condensation of SiO4 tetrahedra increased with increasing amounts of zirconia was confirmed by 29Si magic-angle (MAS) NMR. 1D 27Al, 11B MAS as well as two-dimensional (2D) 11B MQMAS/STMAS NMR experiments gave structural insight into the number and nature of aluminum and boron sites found in the glass and glass–ceramic (GC) samples. Irrespective of the heat treatment time, increasing the zirconia content in glasses suppressed their tendency towards devitrification, while the glasses exhibited good sintering behavior resulting in mechanically strong GCs with higher amounts of residual glassy phase making them suitable for self-healing during SOFC operation. All the GCs exhibited low total electrical conductivity; appropriate coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), good joining and minimal reactivity with SOFC metallic components at the fuel cell operating temperature, thus, qualifying them for further appraisal in SOFC stacks.
1 Introduction
The efficient production of electricity is a fundamental requirement for the modern world. Various energy technologies, such as wind, nuclear, solar photovoltaic, geothermal and fuel cells, are in utilization to fulfill this requirement. However, among the various technologies, fuel cells represent the most electrically efficient one with 45–65% efficiency (total system efficiency ∼85%, including the thermal component – unheard of by any other technology) in the conversion of chemical energy to electricity. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are particularly capable of operating with various fuels, e.g. natural gas, gasoline, hydrogen and bio-fuels. Furthermore, the low cost and environmentally friendly nature (e.g., low emissions of NOx [<0.5 ppm]) of SOFCs makes them suitable for a “highly efficient future technology”. It is due to these reasons that last decade has witnessed a tremendous increase in research and development in this area, especially through specific programs supported by various government and private agencies across the world, solely dedicated towards finding feasible solutions to various technical challenges which acted as major roadblocks for the commercialization of SOFC technology. Although, significant achievements have been made which resulted in huge impact on the development of this technology, for example, lowering of operating temperatures (700–800 °C), increased power density (0.2–0.5 W cm2), development of metallic interconnects, to name a few, one major hurdle that still proves to be an arduous task for the researchers worldwide is the development of a hermetic high temperature sealing which can prevent the leakage and mixing of fuel and oxidant from the gaps between the components of planar SOFCs (p-SOFCs) at the operating temperatures.1–8
Numerous reviews2,9,10 have proposed that glass and glass–ceramic materials are the most promising sealants for the SOFCs, enabling the desired requirements to be more easily achieved. Many compositions of glass and glass–ceramic (GC) sealants for p-SOFCs have been developed and their thermal and chemical properties have been extensively studied.11–19 However, there is no specific sealant which can offer a great promise for the various p-SOFC applications. The desired requirements for a p-SOFC sealant material include optimum viscosity, good sintering ability, wettability, chemical inertness, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion matching with adjacent SOFC components. Fulfilling all these requirements in a glass–GC seal stands as the main goal towards developing more efficient p-SOFCs.
The glass compositions investigated in our previous study were designed in the primary crystallization field of akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7)–gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) type melilite glasses within the system of CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 owing to their high chemical resistance and appropriate CTE.19,20 Materials from this system, in particular MB-0 (in mol% 44.01CaO–11.02MgO–33SiO2–11Al2O3–0.97La2O3–0Bi2O3)11 and MB-1 (in mol% 43.95CaO–10.99MgO–32.96SiO2–10.99Al2O3–0.98La2O3–0.14Bi2O3) glasses, were revealed to be potential candidates for SOFC seals. As shown in our previous studies,21 good sintering ability is crucial for a sealing glass. Regarding this aspect, the MB-0 and MB-1 glasses were not completely satisfactory due to their insufficient sintering ability and the resulting porosity left after sintering. Furthermore, structural and chemical stability and mechanical reliability of these GCs after the long term operation are still to be disclosed.
The literature survey evidenced that (i) the introduction of SrO in the silicate glass network might enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of glasses and GCs and (ii) B2O3 along with rare-earth oxides tailor the viscosity and flow behavior of glasses.21–27 Thus, substitution of Ca for Sr and Al for B was attempted in MB-1 glass and the resulting composition was considered as the parent glass (Zr-0) in the present work.19 Furthermore, the substitution of Mg for Zr was performed in this parent Zr-0 glass, resulting in new ZrO2-containing compositions, Zr-1, Zr-2, Zr-3 and Zr-4. The high valence Zr4+ cations enhance the reticulation degree of the glass network and thus increase the thermal characteristics of glasses.28 Margha et al.29 reported that mechanical properties of ZrO2 containing borosilicate glasses improved with the time of heat treatment. Coillot et al.28 added 7 mol% of ZrO2 to the alkali borosilicate glasses to improve their thermal stability; Peng et al.30 added 1.6 mol% of ZrO2 to BaO–B2O3–SiO2 based sealants to improve their chemical compatibility. However, the influence of ZrO2 on structural variations and crystalline phase evolution in GCs during long term heat treatment has not been reported so far and is the focus of the present report. Multinuclear solid-state NMR (ssNMR) techniques along with XRD were used to obtain information on the chemical environment and coordination mode of silicon, aluminum and boron species present in the studied glass and GC samples at different sintering times. The effect of increasing zirconium loadings was monitored through ssNMR.
2 Experimental
The chemical compositions of the experimental glasses Zr-0, Zr-1, Zr-2, Zr-3 and Zr-4 are presented in Table 1. The detailed glass synthesis procedure and more experimental procedures are provided in the ESI.† Rectangular bars with dimensions of 4 mm × 5 mm × 50 mm were prepared by uniaxial pressing (80 MPa). In order to study the mechanical strength and crystalline phase assemblages in GC sealants and their stability during long term heat treatment, the bars were sintered at 850 °C for 1 h at 5 K min−1 and further heat treated at 800 °C for 500 h. The amorphous nature of glasses, qualitative and quantitative analyses of crystalline phases in the GCs (crushed to particle size <45 μm) was confirmed by XRD analysis using a conventional Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (Philips PW 3710, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with Ni-filtered Cu–K radiation. The quantitative phase analysis of GCs was carried out by using the combined Rietveld-R.I.R (reference intensity ratio) method. 10 wt% corundum (NIST SRM 676a) was added to all the GC samples as an internal standard, as reported elsewhere.19,20,25

29Si, 27Al, and 11B 1D magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded for all the glasses and GCs. The spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a B0 field of 9.4 T with 29Si, 27Al and 11B Larmor frequencies of 79.5, 104.3 and 128.4 MHz, respectively. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded using a 7 mm probe employing a rotation speed of 5 kHz, using a 4.5 μs radio-frequency excitation pulse length with a radio-frequency field strength of 56 kHz (90° flip angle) and 60 s recycle delay. 27Al and 11B MAS NMR spectra were recorded using a 4 mm probe at a spinning rate of 14 kHz, 1 s recycle delay, 0.5 μs radio-frequency excitation pulse (equivalent to a π/18 flip angle) for 27Al and 0.9 μs (equivalent to a π/12 flip angle) for 11B. The flip angle pulses used for 27Al and 11B were optimized using an aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3 and H3BO3.

11B MAS NMR spectra were also recorded at a MAS rate of 14 kHz using a Hahn-echo with a 90° and a 180° soft pulse of 12 μs and 24 μs, respectively employing an echo delay synchronized with 1 rotor period of 66.6 μs. This sequence was used to remove the 11B probe background, which is present in most of the commercial probe heads.

11B MQMAS (Multiple-Quantum MAS) NMR experiments were performed using a split-t1 z-filter pulse sequence31 employing radio-frequency pulse lengths of 2.8 μs and 0.8 μs for the first two hard pulses and a 5 μs 90° soft pulse. Radio-frequency field strengths of 150 and 20 kHz were employed for the hard and soft pulses, respectively. 48 t1 points were acquired during the indirect dimension with 768 scans each using a recycle delay of 1 s.

11B 2D STMAS (Satellite-Transition MAS) experiments were performed using a split-t1 version of the double-quantum (DQ) STMAS32,33 employing radio-frequency pulse lengths of 2.0 μs and 2.2 μs for the first and third hard pulses, and 42 μs and 21 μs for the second (180°) and fourth (90°) soft pulses. Radio-frequency field strengths of 125 and 13.5 kHz were employed for the hard and soft pulses, respectively. 64 t1 points were acquired during the indirect dimension with 160 scans each using a recycle delay of 1 s.
The States-TPPI detection scheme and rotor-synchronization in the t1 domain were employed in both MQMAS and STMAS experiments with a MAS rate of 15 kHz. Chemical shifts are quoted in ppm from Q8M8 (−109.68 ppm, for the farthest downfield frequency peak), aqueous solutions of Al(NO3)3 (0 ppm) and 0.1 M aqueous solution of H3BO3 (19.6 ppm) for 29Si, 27Al and 11B, respectively.
To investigate the adhesion and chemical interactions of the glasses with SOFC components, wetting experiments between glasses and interconnects (Sanergy HT–Crofer 22 APU) were carried out. The glass powders, 40 wt% solid content mixed with 5 vol% solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) prepared by dissolution of PVA in warm water, were deposited on Crofer 22 APU by slurry coating. The diffusion couples Crofer 22 APU–glass were heated to 850 °C with a relatively slow heating rate of 2 K min−1, kept at that temperature for 1 h and further heat treated at 800 °C for 500 h.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; SU-70, Hitachi) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; Bruker Quantax, Germany) was used to study the distribution of elements along the GC–interconnect diffusion couples. The equipment and experimental procedures used for testing of electrical properties were described elsewhere.14,34 The total conductivity (σ) was determined by AC impedance spectroscopy using HP4284A and Gamry PCI4/750 instruments; the measurements were performed as a function of temperature and time at 600–800 °C in air, flowing dry argon, humidified argon with the water vapor partial pressure of approximately 0.03 atm, and a 10% H2–90% N2 gas mixture.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Sintering and crystallization behaviors: DTA and HSM

Fig. 1 shows variations in the relative area and heat flow with respect to temperature, as obtained respectively from HSM and DTA measurements performed at the heating rate (β) of 5 K min−1. Table 2 summarizes the values of the first shrinkage temperature (TFS), maximum shrinkage temperature (TMS), and ratio of the final area/initial area of the glass powder compacts (A/A0), as obtained from the HSM data at TMS (Fig. 1), along with the onset of crystallization temperature (Tc), and peak temperature of crystallization (Tp), as received from DTA of the glasses. The data obtained from DTA and HSM (β = 5 K min−1) allow the following trends to be observed:

(i) In comparison to MB-1,19 the temperatures of Zr-0 glass, TFS (starting shrinkage) and TMS (maximum shrinkage before softening point), decreased from 800 °C to 763 °C and from 870 to 842 °C, respectively. TFS increased from 763 to 789 °C with the first ZrO2 increments (Zr-1, Zr-2), whilst decreased to ∼720 °C with further ZrO2 additions (Zr-3, Zr-4).
(ii) Fig. 1a and b reveal two-stage sintering processes for the Zr-0 and Zr-1 glasses with the first and second sintering stages being accomplished at TMS1 and TMS2, respectively. This two-stage sintering might be due to the glass-in-glass phase separation observed in Zr-0 and Zr-1 glasses. In the Zr-0 glass, TMS1 is slightly higher than Tc (onset of crystallization temperature), while in Zr-1, TMS1 is slightly lower than Tc. This last feature brought by the addition of ZrO2 will favor the achievement of well sintered and mechanically strong glass powder compacts. Further adding ZrO2 to the parent glass resulted in a single-stage sintering behavior with TMS < Tc (Fig. 1c and d). This demonstrates that sintering precedes crystallization in all the ZrO2-containing glasses and, therefore, well sintered and mechanically strong glass powder compacts should be expected.
(iii) The parameter Sc (=TC − TMS) is a measure of the sintering ability vs. crystallization: the greater this difference, the more independent are the kinetics of both processes. The values of sintering ability Sc varied in the interval 6–112 °C and are considerably higher compared to that of ZrO2-free parent glass (Sc = −2 °C) and Bi2O3-containing melilite glasses19 (Sc = 6 °C) suggesting that sintering ability is improved with increasing ZrO2 concentrations.
(iv) The DTA thermographs of the Zr-0, Zr-1 and Zr-2 glasses exhibited two distinct exothermal crystallization curves designated as TP1 and TP2 (Fig. S1†) whilst a single exothermic peak was observed for both Zr-3 and Zr-4 glasses. Moreover, the characteristic temperatures Tc, TP1 and TP2 demonstrated a clear tendency to shift to a higher temperature region with increasing ZrO2 amounts in the glasses.
(v) The A/A0 values ranged from 0.68 to 0.71 (Table 2) implying towards good densification levels (95–98%).34
It can be said that an insufficient amount of the residual glass phase left after crystallization might originate some porosity because of the density difference between the glassy and crystalline phases.35 The addition of ZrO2 enhanced considerably the Sc parameters by delaying the nucleation and crystallization processes, thus enlarging the processing window for attaining maximum densification, making the glasses suitable for SOFC applications.
3.2 Crystalline phase evolution along with isothermal heat treatments: XRD
Besides the above referred to excellent densification achieved upon sintering, the type and amounts of crystalline phases developed under service at high temperature is also of paramount importance for qualifying the GCs as sealants. Fig. 2a presents X-ray diffractograms of the glass powder compacts sintered at 850 °C for 1 h. Crystalline phases developed in all compositions except in Zr-4 glass, suggesting that this heat treatment schedule is not kinetically sufficient to promote devitrification. The quantitative XRD analysis adjoined with the Rietveld-R.I.R technique19 reported in Table 3 revealed that dicalcium silicate (Ca2SiO4) crystallized as the primary phase in all the GCs followed by gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) and lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3) as secondary in Zr-0 and Zr-1, Zr-2, and Zr-4 respectively. However, increasing the zirconium content in glasses retarded their tendency towards devitrification as is evident from Table 3. The standard diffraction patterns of Ca2SiO4, LaAlO3, and Ca2Al2SiO7, are also included in Fig. 2a for comparison purposes.

Fig. 2(b and c) present X-ray diffractograms of the GCs heat treated at 800 °C for 100 h and 500 h for all Zr-containing glasses. Their quantitative phase analysis is also reported in Table 3, while Fig. S1† shows an example of small differences between observed and calculated curves from the Rietveld refinement for the Zr-1 GC. There were significant phase changes along the time at 800 °C due to devitrification, in comparison to the sample sintered at 850 °C for 1 h (Table 3). The amount of Ca2SiO4 increased up to 100 h and then underwent a gradual dissolution/conversion into other phases, while LaAlO3 faded and completely disappeared after 500 h in all investigated GCs. This fading trend was compensated by the growth of new and more thermally stable gehlenite and akermanite phases. Gehlenite became the major phase after 500 h at 800 °C in all GCs except Zr-2 in which akermanite predominates. Besides that, akermanite (lower ZrO2 contents) and dicalcium silicate (higher ZrO2 contents) were formed as secondary crystalline phases. For all heat treatment time periods, increasing ZrO2 content enhanced the amount of glassy phase in the resulting GCs, making them suitable for self-healing during SOFC operation.
3.3 Structural transformations upon long-term SOFC operation: solid state NMR


29Si MAS NMR. 

Fig. 3a(i and ii) show the 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the initial glasses. Zr-0 and Zr-4 display single broad resonance Q site distributions typical for glassy systems36–38 centered at −75.7 and −77.8 ppm, respectively. This 29Si chemical shift indicates an increasing condensation degree of SiO4 tetrahedra (Qn where n = 0–4), as expected from the increase of the network formers (Table 1) and the concomitant replacement of Mg2+ for Zr4+cations.39
 Fig. 3  (a) (left) 29Si MAS and (right) 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the (i, ii, vii and viii) glasses and (iii–vi, ix–xii) GCs without (Zr-0) and with (Zr-4) Zr loading (Table 1) sintered at 850 °C for 100 and 500 h. Spectral deconvolutions of the 29Si MAS spectra of GCs sintered for 500 h at distinct Zr loadings: (b) Zr-2 and (c) Zr-4. The quantification of the deconvoluted silicon components is shown in Table S2.† Global simulation and its components are shown in blue and red lines, respectively. 
The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of Zr-4 GCs heat treated for 100 h shown in Fig. 3a(iii) is almost identical to its corresponding glass analogue, Fig. 3a(i). Conversely, the Zr-0 GC spectrum in Fig. 3a(iv) displays a sharp resonance centered at −73 ppm, associated with Ca2SiO4, consistent with the phase assemblage listed in Table 3. The sample series heat treated for 100 h show a mixture of at least three silicate phases. However, discrimination between these phases is difficult from the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum because the Si nucleus in Ca2MgSi2O7, Ca2Al2SiO7 and Ca2SiO4 resonates at similar frequencies (−71 to −75 ppm).39–42 The presence of a higher amount of glassy phase also enhances line broadening. Therefore, the resonance centered at ca. −73 ppm is due to contributions from all the phases present.
The spectra for materials heat treated for 500 h are shown in Fig. 3a(v and vi). Zr-0 GC shows a single resonance, not too dissimilar to its 100 h analogue. Zr-4 GC exhibits multiple resonances within −77.0 to −88.2 ppm, thus covering the chemical shift range of Q1–Q3. Spectral deconvolution (Fig. 3b), peak integration and full width at half maximum obtained from the 29Si NMR spectra of Zr-2 and Zr-4 GCs are given in Table S2.† The quantification of the silicon components ‘a–f’ is also shown in Table S2.† The percentage of crystalline phases determined from the 29Si resonance areas corroborates those obtained from XRD analysis. The component ‘a’ present in the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3b and c) corresponds to the Ca2MgSi2O7 and Ca2Al2SiO7 phases. This assignment may be confirmed by comparing the semi-quantitative XRD analysis (Table 3) and the deconvoluted 29Si NMR spectra. The transformation of the component ‘a’ in the different formed phases (components ‘b–f’) can be quantitatively described for the distinct Zr loadings through 29Si NMR spectra of GCs. For example, NMR indicates that the component ‘a’ accounts for ∼100%, 74.2% and 49.8% of the total phases for Zr-0, Zr-2 and Zr-4, respectively, in agreement with XRD analysis.



27Al MAS NMR. 
The 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the Zr-series, Fig. 3(vii–xii), display broad and asymmetric line shapes typical of 27Al sites in disordered materials.43–45 The line shapes are centered at 58.7 ppm, corresponding to tetrahedral Al environments and tails towards negative chemical shifts. All 27Al MAS NMR spectra show approximately the same profile regardless of the Zr-loading. However, the spectra of the 100 h and 500 h GCs show an emerging resonance at ca. −13.3 ppm, typical of the AlO6 environment. It is worth mentioning that these 6-coordinated Al species are favored at low Zr loadings for shorter heat treatments (100 h) but predominant for higher Zr loadings at 500 h. The 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectra of all Zr-0 to Zr-4 glasses and GC samples analyzed are shown in Fig. S2† for completeness.



11B MAS NMR. 

Fig. 4a(i) shows the 11B Hahn-echo NMR spectra for the Zr-glasses. The spectra display broad and overlapping resonances due to BO3 ([3]B) and BO4 ([4]B) environments. The main site is assigned to asymmetric [3]B units giving rise to the typical second-order quadrupolar lineshapes ranging from 20 to −5 ppm, whereas the less intense [4]B unit yields a Gaussian shape at ca. 0 ppm for a magnetic field of 9.4 T. It is difficult to speculate from the 1D Hahn-echo spectra about the number of 11B trigonal and tetrahedral sites due to possible resonance overlap involving distinct 11B resonances. Therefore, high-resolution techniques are employed to narrow the 11B line shapes. For this purpose, 11B STMAS and 3Q MAS experiments were conducted on selected materials, where the 1D 11B MAS NMR spectra showed suspicious singularities for both glasses and GC samples (Fig. 4b and c and S3†). The 11B STMAS NMR spectrum of Zr-4 glass is given in Fig. S3,† which confirms that only two 11B sites are present corresponding to [3]B and [4]B environments.

Fig. 4a(iii) shows the 11B Hahn-echo NMR spectra for the GC Zr-series heat treated for 500 h. The GCs display completely different line shapes to their glass analogues; the [4]B environments are strongly pronounced with a lower intensity left handed [3]B shoulder. 11B 3QMAS NMR spectra were recorded on the Zr-0 and Zr-4 GCs heat treated for 500 h. The spectrum of the former reveals two distinct BO3 sites ([3]B-a and [3]B-b) whereas the Zr-4 spectrum shows a single [3]B site. Therefore, knowing the number of 11B sites identified from the 2D 3QMAS spectrum, adequate lineshape simulations of the 1D 11B MAS NMR spectra were possible and are given in Fig. 4d and e along with the extracted NMR parameters in Table 4 [the isotropic chemical shift (δiso), quadrupolar constant (CQ) and quadrupolar asymmetry parameter (η)]. However, we could not accurately simulate the Zr-4 spectrum using just one [3]B component as apparently shown from the 11B 3QMAS spectrum (Fig. 4c). We believe that the Zr-4 material contains two [3]B sites but due to an increase in amorphous phase within the system, the distinct 11B environments present chemical shift and quadrupolar distribution along the glass network and consequently the two sites converge and overlap in the 11B 3QMAS spectrum (Fig. 4c). The [3]B sites present CQs of ca. 2.0–2.7 MHz, well within the range of other reported glasses. The spectral deconvolution of the 1D 11B MAS NMR spectra corresponding to the Zr-0 and Zr-4 GCs (500 h) shows that the ratio [4]B/[3]B is constant, which means that increasing Zr loadings does not affect the amount of [4]B groups formed after long heat treatment times. The observed trigonal sites, [3]B-a and [3]B-b, can be attributed to [3]B in the boroxol ring or nonring components.46

It is clear from the XRD patterns and broadening in both the 11B and 29Si MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 4a and S2) that increasing zirconium loading inhibits crystallisation resulting in higher contents of the amorphous phase, probably due to viscosity variations.
The 11B Hahn-echo MAS NMR spectra of the Zr–GC series heat treated for 100 h are given in Fig. 4a(ii), which show a slightly more complex trend. Zr-0 and Zr-1 GCs show line shapes similar to the 500 h heat treated materials, whereas Zr-2 to Zr-4 GCs display glass like features. The latter spectra can be explained in terms of the effect of zirconium on the viscosity of glass and network reticulation. The enhanced viscosity with increasing Zr loadings hinders the [3]B to [4]B units rearrangement, especially for ZrO2 ≥ 2 wt% (Fig. 4a(ii)). Conversely, when the same systems are heat treated for longer periods (500 h) kinetic factors outweigh viscosity effects and thus reticulation occurs independently of Zr loading as deduced from the similarity among the 11B MAS NMR spectra displayed in Fig. 4a(iii). Overall, 11B NMR spectra suggest a linkage between the formation of [4]B species and the reticulation degree induced by higher Zr loadings, probably at the expense of nonbridging oxygens.47[4]B sites are, however, not formed at high Zr loadings when the short heat treatment times do not allow sufficient atom diffusion for network rearrangement (Fig. 4a(ii)).

3.4 Mechanical strength and CTE
Highly dense and mechanically strong GCs are usually obtained when sintering of glassy powder compacts precedes crystallization. Table 2 presents the mechanical strength results of GCs after sintering at 850 °C for 1 h and heat treatment at 800 °C for 500 h. It can be seen that the mechanical strength of GCs decreased with increasing ZrO2, a trend that may be due to the formation of higher amounts of residual glassy phase (Table 3). Accordingly, maximum (110 MPa) and minimum (99 MPa) mechanical strength values were measured for the Zr-0 and Zr-4 GCs, respectively. The mechanical strength was further enhanced under prolonged heat treatment at 800 °C for 500 h (Table 2). This is consistent with the result reported by Margha et al.,29 who found improved mechanical strength for heat treated ZrO2-containing borosilicate glasses. The obtained mechanical strength values for all the GCs being within the limits (22–150 MPa) required for SOFC sealants make them suitable for this specific application.
When the CTE of SOFC components is higher than that for glass seal, tensile/compressive stresses will occur at the interface of the glass–GC sealant and components upon heating–cooling cycles. Thus, a close match of the CTEs of all components is essential for the mechanical integrity and hermeticity of the join between metal–ceramic or ceramic–ceramic components of SOFC.2,7,10 The CTE values of the GCs sintered at 850 °C for 1 h and 500 h are presented in Table 2. Zr-0 GCs exhibit the highest CTE (11.2 × 10−6 K−1) among GCs sintered at 850 °C for 1 h. No significant changes were observed upon long heat treatment.
The amount and the type of crystalline phases, and the relative density and porosity of specimens are the main factors affecting the mechanical strength and CTE of GCs. The high shrinkage/density values (Table S3†) and the predominance of crystalline phases in GCs heat treated at 800 °C for 500 h are the responsible factors for their higher mechanical strength in comparison to GCs sintered at 850 °C for 1 h. This is in good agreement with the increased formation of BO4 structural units with increasing heat treatment time as revealed by 11B MAS NMR, thus enhancing the glass network connectivity. Minimizing thermal stresses that are responsible for the crack production during cell operation requires that differences in CTEs of bonded materials should not exceed 1 × 10−6 K−1.48 Considering the CTE values of metallic interconnects (Crofer 22 APU, Sanergy HT) ((11–12) × 10−6 K−1) and ceramic electrolytes (i.e. 8YSZ) ((10–12) × 10−6 K−1), it becomes clear that all glass compositions are suitable for rigid glass–GC seals.
3.5 Interaction studies
Anode-supported planar SOFCs using thin ceramic electrolytes (e.g. 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia – YSZ) could operate at temperatures (<800 °C) lower than other SOFC types, thus allowing the use of lower-cost ferritic stainless steel interconnects, rather than the costly chromite interconnects required for higher-temperature SOFCs. Fig. 5a shows a Crofer 22 APU–GC interface for Zr-2 glass heat treated in air at 850 °C for 500 h. Elemental concentration profiles for Cr, Mn, Fe, Si, Al and Ca from the Crofer 22 APU–Zr-1, Crofer 22 APU–Zr-2 and Crofer 22 APU–Zr-4 couples are shown in Fig. 5e–g, respectively. Except for Cr and Mn that preferentially concentrate at the interface, the concentration profiles are S shaped with two diffusion tails: one at the high concentration end and the other at the low concentration end.49 This means that elemental inter-diffusion from Crofer 22 APU alloy and the Zr containing melilite glass occurs across the interface. The interfacial hump behaviors of Cr and Mn indicate that the Crofer 22 APU–GC interface layer was enriched in these elements. Elemental mapping analysis for the Crofer 22 APU–Zr-1–GC joint was performed for the better assessment of Cr, Fe, and Mn elemental distributions across the interface (Fig. 5b–d). The interface enrichment in Cr and Mn suggests the formation of the Mn–Cr-spinel at the Crofer 22 APU–GCs interfaces. The diffusion thicknesses for Cr and Mn into the glasses measured from the inflection point of S shape profiles are about ∼3 μm. Such thickness values are 3−25 times thinner than those reported for the chemical interaction between barium calcium borosilicate glass and Crofer 22 APU after heat treatment in air at 750 °C for 200 h.35,50
 Fig. 5  (a–d) SEM image and EDS elemental mappings for Cr, Fe, and Mn, at the interface between Zr-2 and Crofer 22 APU after heat treatment at 800 °C for 500 h. Elemental concentration profiles at the interface between (e) Zr-1–Crofer 22 APU, (f) Zr-2–Crofer 22 APU and (g) Zr-4–Crofer 22 APU after heat treatment at 800 °C for 500 h. 
Non-porous, smooth and adherent crack free interfaces were observed between GCs and Crofer 22 APU after the 500 h prolonged heat treatment suggesting long term stability of ZrO2 containing glass seals. Furthermore, the investigated interfaces showed a homogeneous microstructure over the entire cross-section without joint gaps. The formation of the Mn and Cr-rich oxide layer on the steel surface is expected to bring the following benefits: (i) the Mn and Cr-rich oxide layer limits chromium and iron diffusion rates under the prospective operating conditions, since the Mn and Cr-rich oxide layer is less reactive and more stable than chromia;2,51 (ii) the CTE of the Mn and Cr-rich oxide layer (10.7 × 10−6 K−1)52 is closer to those of electrodes, electrolytes, and seals (Table 2) and thus the thermal stress can be reduced and the durability of the cell can be improved.
3.6 Electrical conductivity
The impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that all the studied GCs exhibit excellent insulating properties. For example, the total conductivity at 800 °C in atmospheric air varies in the range (2–5) × 10−7 S m−1, Fig. 6a. These values are much lower than the threshold of 10−5 S cm−1, critical for the SOFC applications. Increasing the Zr4+ concentration decreased conductivity, whilst the activation energy (Ea) calculated by the standard Arrhenius equation increased from 191 to 229 kJ mol−1. Note that Ea exhibits a linear correlation with the molar volume (Table S1†) suggesting an essentially ionic character of the conductivity (inset in Fig. 6a), as for other silicate-based GCs (e.g., see ref. 14 and 25 and references therein). The same conclusion was drawn from analysis of the impedance spectra comprising significant electrode signals. Consequently, the increase in the molar volume is associated with lowering of the energetic barriers for ionic charge-carrier jumps, leading to lower activation energies. In oxidizing and neutral atmospheres, the electrical conductivity is time-independent; moderate variations of the oxygen and water vapor partial pressures did not affect the electrical properties (Fig. 6b). This behavior unambiguously shows that water incorporation into the GC bulk and protonic contribution to the conductivity can be neglected. Non-negligible changes were observed, however, in the flowing 10% H2–90% N2 gas mixture when the conductivity starts to increase. Most likely, such a trend originates from partial reduction of bismuth in the surface layers of the GCs and higher electronic transport; previous results19 showed that these processes do not result in substantial compositional changes and microstructural alterations. Although this decrease in the electrical resistivity cannot be neglected, no deteriorating influence on the SOFC performance may be expected as the resultant conductivity values remain very low, <2 × 10−6 S cm−1 after stabilization for 50–100 h.

The inset shows relationships between the activation energy and molar volume. (b) Electrical conductivity of the GC materials in various atmospheres at 800 °C. 
Considering all the relevant characteristics of the starting glasses and the corresponding GCs (Table 3 and S3†), the Zr-0 to Zr-2 glass–GC compositions are very promising materials for SOFC applications. The good adhesion to Sanergy HT–GC and Crofer 22 APU–GC for ZrO2-free and ZrO2-containing glasses and the absence of detrimental phases at the interfaces of the diffusion couples support this conclusion. The more positive feature of these GCs is that they contain gehlenite and akermanite as the only crystalline phases which possess high CTE, ∼9 × 10−6 K−1 and ∼10 × 10−6 K−1, respectively, and do not exhibit polymorphism during long term heat treatments, a drawback that is usually reported for BaO–Al2O3–SiO-based glass seals (hexacelsian to celsian).53 Also, the absence of BaO from the glasses will ensure a minimal interfacial reaction with the metallic interconnects.
4 Conclusions
1. In all investigated ZrO2-containing glasses, sintering precedes crystallization and well sintered and mechanically strong GCs are obtained. The two-stage sintering behavior attributed to glass-in-glass phase separation tends to disappear with the ZrO2 additions, while the densification was considerably enhanced. Gehlenite and akermanite became the major phases in all GCs after 500 h of heat treatment at 800 °C implying towards enhanced thermal stability.
2. Increasing zirconia additions favored the condensation of SiO4 tetrahedra, suppressed the tendency of glasses for devitrification, thus favoring higher contents of residual glassy phase essential for self-healing.
3. There is a good correlation between the crystalline phase contents in GCs determined by XRD analysis and from the 29Si MAS NMR spectral peak areas. The Zr-loadings did not influence the coordination of Al species for glasses. However, 6-coordinated Al species were formed after heat treatment for 100 h (lower Zr loadings) and for 500 h (higher Zr loadings).
4. 11B STMAS and 3QMAS NMR spectra confirm the presence of only two 11B sites corresponding to BO3 and BO4 environments, the first one, [3]B, predominating in glass, and an enrichment of [4]B groups in GCs, probably due to enhanced reticulation at the expense of nonbridging oxygens.
5. The impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that all investigated GCs exhibit good insulating properties. Non-porous, smooth and adherent crack free interfaces were observed between GCs and Crofer 22 APU after the 500 h prolonged heat treatment suggesting long term stability of ZrO2 containing glass seals.
