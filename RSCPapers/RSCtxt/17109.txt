    , Accepted 14th January 2021First published on 14th January 2021AbstractLow-temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) use carbon-neutral ammonia as a fuel, which has attracted increasing attention recently due to ammonia's low source-to-tank energy cost, easy transport and storage, and wide availability. However, current DAFC technologies are greatly limited by the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) at the anode. Herein, we report an AOR catalyst, in which ternary PtIrZn nanoparticles with an average size of 2.3 ± 0.2 nm were highly dispersed on a binary composite support comprising cerium oxide (CeO2) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)-derived carbon (PtIrZn/CeO2-ZIF-8) through a sonochemical-assisted synthesis method. The PtIrZn alloy, with the aid of abundant OHad provided by CeO2 and uniform particle dispersibility contributed by porous ZIF-8 carbon (surface area: ∼600 m2 g−1), has shown highly efficient catalytic activity for the AOR in alkaline media, superior to that of commercial PtIr/C. The rotating disk electrode (RDE) results indicate a lower onset potential (0.35 vs. 0.43 V), relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode at room temperature, and a decreased activation energy (∼36.7 vs. 50.8 kJ mol−1) relative to the PtIr/C catalyst. Notably, the PtIrZn/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst was assembled with a high-performance hydroxide anion-exchange membrane to fabricate an alkaline DAFC, reaching a peak power density of 91 mW cm−2. Unlike in aqueous electrolytes, supports play a critical role in improving uniform ionomer distribution and mass transport in the anode. PtIrZn nanoparticles on silicon dioxide (SiO2) integrated with carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT–COOH) were further studied as the anode in a DAFC. A significantly enhanced peak power density of 314 mW cm−2 was achieved. Density functional theory calculations elucidated that Zn atoms in the PtIr alloy can reduce the theoretical limiting potential of *NH2 dehydrogenation to *NH by ∼0.1 V, which can be attributed to a Zn-modulated upshift of the Pt–Ir d-band that facilitates the N–H bond breakage.

Broader context
The development of clean hydrogen fuel cells is crucial for energy and environment sustainability, but we still face grand challenges in terms of difficulties of hydrogen production, transportation, distribution, and storage. Alternatively, ammonia, a carbon-neutral fuel, is an ideal hydrogen carrier, which can be readily transported and stored using existing infrastructures, and then directly utilized for energy applications through a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC). However, the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) in DAFCs requires substantial precious metal catalysts (e.g., Pt and Ir), leading to prohibitively high cost. This research is dedicated to reducing the cost of DAFCs by developing advanced AOR catalysts with reduced precious metal loadings and improved catalytic performance. High-performance DAFCs in the future can provide power sources without CO2 emission for a variety of applications, including electric vehicles, portable electronics, and stationary residencies.

1. Introduction
Hydrogen is a promising and sustainable fuel since it only produces water when consumed by a fuel cell. It can be produced through water-splitting by utilizing renewable and clean solar and wind electricity.1,2 However, the advent of the hydrogen economy cannot be realized until technical barriers related to hydrogen transportation, distribution, and storage are overcome. Alternatively, the concept of an ammonia (NH3) economy has recently gained eminence due to the following reasons.3–6 First, ammonia as a cost-effective hydrogen carrier and carbon-free fuel is in a liquid state at near ambient conditions, and it enables a complete cycle of synthesis and consumption that would not produce greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the infrastructure and supply chain for ammonia as a transport fuel is already in existence or can be easily modified. Third, dissociating ammonia for hydrogen generation and then using the hydrogen in a fuel cell or a direct ammonia input to a fuel cell can be realized for electricity generation as a power source with high energy density for transportation applications.1,7,8 In particular, low-temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) can directly utilize ammonia at the anode, which has great promise for vehicle applications, because of its fast start-up superiority in comparison to high-temperature DAFCs (e.g., ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs, and protonic ceramic fuel cells, PCFCs).7,9,10 Nevertheless, the development of DAFCs is at an earlier stage when compared with hydrogen fuel cells. This is mainly due to the more complex and sluggish anodic ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) than the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).11
Earlier research indicated that Pt, Ir, and their alloys can catalyze the AOR in alkaline media at low temperature.12,13 The standard potential of the AOR is −0.77 V vs. SHE (0.056 V vs. RHE), very close to that of the hydrogen oxidation reaction at −0.83 V (0 V vs. RHE) in alkaline media at 25 °C. However, the overpotential on Pt-based catalysts at room temperature is larger than 0.40 V, which significantly reduces the energy conversion efficiency for DAFC applications.13,14 Accordingly, it is anticipated that the AOR could commence in the hydrogen zone (0 to 0.40 V vs. RHE) if a more efficient catalyst was used. The modulation of the *H oxidation potential is a way to design an efficient AOR catalyst. It was reported that the hydrogen adsorption could be suppressed by incorporating Pt with high hydrogen-overpotential metals (e.g., Zn).15,16 Therefore, the knowledge gained from Pt–Zn alloys provides a guide in this work to explore ternary Pt–Ir–Zn alloys for the AOR. Also, our density functional theory calculations predicted that Zn atoms in the PtIr alloy could reduce the theoretical limiting potential of *NH2 dehydrogenation to *NH because a Zn-modulated upshift of the Pt–Ir d-band facilitates the N–H bond breakage. Driven by the theoretical understanding, we synthesized a new PtIrZn ternary catalyst for the AOR.
Besides, catalyst supports play a critical role in uniformly dispersing metal nanoparticles, improving catalyst utilization, and offering a unique metal–support interaction for intrinsic activity enhancement. Our previous report has demonstrated that silicon dioxide (SiO2) and carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT–COOH) as a composite support can be used for effective Pt alloy nanoparticle deposition.13 The interfaces between SiO2 and Pt alloys facilitate the AOR activity because SiO2 could supply abundant OHad to the nearby metallic catalytic sites.17 However, the nanoparticle dispersion on this composite support is not very uniform.13 Therefore, improving the nanoparticle dispersion has allured us to develop a novel composite support in this work. In light of this, cerium oxide (CeO2) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)-derived carbon were newly explored for the PtIrZn nanoparticle catalyst. CeO2 is widely used to support metal nanoparticles because the Ce3+ in CeO2 can work as a Lewis base to modify the reactants' adsorption properties and intermediates.18 Thus, the CeO2–Pt alloy interfaces can facilitate the AOR.13,19 However, CeO2 generally possesses a low surface area (<50 m2 g−1), which is not sufficient for high-loading nanoparticle deposition and effective mass transfer. In contrast, the ZIF-8 derived carbon typically exhibits a large surface area and dominant porosity, ideal for Pt-based alloy nanoparticle deposition.20–22
Morphology characterization results have demonstrated that the ternary PtIrZn nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on the CeO2-ZIF-8 support. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of these two different composite supports, we also used the SiO2–CNT–COOH composite support for depositing PtIrZn nanoparticles. Both catalysts were further evaluated in DAFCs by using a high-performance anion-exchange membrane.7,23 Electrochemical results displayed a similar intrinsic AOR activity (onset potential) on both CeO2-ZIF-8 and SiO2–CNT–COOH composite supports. The DAFC tests demonstrated that the PtIrZn/SiO2–CNT–COOH could greatly enhance the electrical conductivity and mass transfer in the anode, yielding a remarkable power density of 314 mW cm−2. We believe that the new knowledge for ammonia oxidation combined with the design and synthesis of advanced electrocatalyst alloys and supports in this work would advance the DAFC technology for possible transportation and other applications.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization
A facile synthetic route for ternary PtIrZn nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on a binary composite support (e.g., CeO2/ZIF-8-derived carbon and SiO2/CNT–COOH) was developed by reducing the metal precursors via sodium borohydride under an ultrasonic environment (Fig. 1). In the case of the CeO2/ZIF-8 carbon support, diluted alkaline-treated CeO2 acts as not only a support for metal NPs,24 but also a reservoir for adsorbing OH species.25 ZIF-8 derived carbon with unique micropores shows a large surface area (∼600 m2 g−1, Fig. S1, ESI†),18 and is an effective metal precursor (i.e., PtCl42−, IrCl62−, and Zn2+) for adsorption during synthesis. Also, the dominant N dopants in ZIF-8 derived-carbon provide sufficient defects to assist the dispersion of Pt-based nanoparticles due to the electron-donation from nitrogen defects to Pt.18,26,27 ZIF-8 derived carbon shows an average particle size of 200 ± 12.7 nm, as can be seen from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). Crystal structures of ZIF-8 precursors are converted into the carbon phase during a typically thermal activation process at 1100 °C for one hour under an Ar atmosphere, verified by analyzing their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S2c and d, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration for the synthesis of CeO2 and ZIF-8 supported ternary PtIrZn nanoparticles. 
During the synthesis, deionized water and ethanol were used to disperse the composite support and then adsorb the metal precursors in the support. Simultaneously, acoustic cavitation28 was employed to control the nucleation and growth of PtIrZn ternary NPs with uniform size and distribution. Additionally, compared to platinum-group-metal (PGM) precursors (PtCl42− and IrCl62−) for the PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Fig. S3, ESI†), the smaller Zn2+ is easily adsorbed onto the pyrolytic ZIF-8 carbon support and interacts with the PGM ones. In doing so, the uniformly dispersed ternary PtIrZn alloy NPs were uniformly dispersed on the composite support consisting of CeO2 (∼100 ± 8.9 nm) and ZIF-8 derived carbon (Fig. S4, ESI†). The PGM (Pt or Pt–Ir) loadings for all the synthesized catalysts are 10 wt% vs. the support unless otherwise noted. Molar ratios of Pt:Ir:Zn in the PtIrZn/CeO2-ZIF-8 are varied at 1:1:0.2 (PtIrZn1), 1:1:0.6 (PtIrZn2), and 1:1:1 (PtIrZn3). Other control samples, such as PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 and PtZn/CeO2-ZIF-8 in a molar ratio of Pt:Ir and Pt:Zn = 1:1, as well as PtIrNi2/CeO2-ZIF-8 and PtIrCu2/CeO2-ZIF-8 in a molar ratio of Pt:Ir:Ni and Pt:Ir:Cu = 1:1:0.6, were synthesized via an identical procedure and the corresponding metal precursors.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the PtIr NPs have an average size of 7.1 ± 0.3 nm (Fig. S3c and d, ESI†). An interplanar spacing of 0.225 nm measured with these PtIr NPs in Fig. S5a and c (ESI†) suggests a lattice contraction compared to that of the pure Pt (ca. 0.227 nm).29 Typically, PtIr alloys have a lattice parameter of ca. 2.25 Å in the (111) plane (Fig. S5b and d, ESI†), which agrees with the PtIr NPs on the composite support.30 The electron diffraction (ED) pattern in Fig. S5f (ESI†) shows that the indices (e.g., 111 and 200) are in good agreement with the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of PtIr NPs.31 The high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the corresponding elemental maps show that the Pt and Ir atoms are well dispersed throughout the PtIr NPs on the composite support (Fig. S5g, ESI†).
Unlike the PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 sample, a more uniform Pt alloy NP dispersion is found for PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S6, ESI†). This is likely due to it being much easier for the ZIF-8 derived carbon and OH− abundant CeO2 to trap the smaller Zn2+ that could assist the adsorption and distribution of Pt and Ir precursors (i.e., PtCl42− and IrCl62−) via electrostatic effects.32–34 The diameter of the PtIrZn NPs was estimated to be 2.3 ± 0.2 nm, smaller than that of commercial PtIr/C (Fig. S7, ESI,† PtIr particle size: 2.7 ± 0.3 nm). The strong metal–support interactions between PtIrZn and the CeO2 support (Fig. 2b) could be due to the semiconductor properties of CeO2 for reducing PtIrZn alloy NPs.24 The unique PtIrZn/CeO2 interfaces could strengthen the interactions for metal-to-oxide and metal-to-metal bonds, thus restraining phase separation.18,24 The lattice spacing of d = 0.312 nm is consistent with the (111) plane of fluorite-phase CeO2 (Fig. 2b).18,35 Different from the PtIrZn NPs deposited on the CeO2 support, a higher loading of PtIrZn is observed on the ZIF-8 derived carbon support (Fig. 2c), which can be attributed to its high surface area (∼600 m2 g−1) and porosity. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 2d) and FFT pattern (Fig. 2e) display the interplanar spacing of 0.223 nm corresponding to d111 of fcc-PtIrZn alloy, illuminating a lattice contraction that occurs in PtIrZn NPs in contrast with that of the PtIr NPs (ca. 0.225 nm) from commercial PtIr/C (Fig. S7, ESI†) and PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The ED pattern in Fig. 2f shows that the indices (e.g., 002, 111, and 200) are in accordance with the ZIF-8 derived carbon and fcc lattice of PtIrZn NPs. Also, the uniformly distributed PtIrZn NPs on the composite support can be further confirmed by the elemental mappings using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. 2(g–k)). Some Zn atoms can also be observed in the carbon support due to the incomplete thermal removal of Zn from the ZIF-8-derived carbon.36

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to identify the crystal structure of these prepared catalysts. As shown in Fig. S8a (ESI†), the peak at ∼26° of the Pt/ZIF-8 sample is attributed to the C (002) of the ZIF-8 derived carbon.37 Other diffraction peaks at 2θ = 39.6, 47.4, 67.1, 81.2 and 83.6° correspond to the Miller indices of (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) of fcc Pt for all the prepared Pt-based catalysts (Fig. S8, ESI†).26 XRD peaks at 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3°, 59.1°, 69.4°, 79.1°, and 88.4° in the CeO2-involved catalysts can be ascribed to the Miller indices (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), and (420) of the cubic lattice of CeO2 (JCPDS No. 81-0792, fluorite structural type), respectively (Fig. 3a and Fig. S8, S9, ESI†).19

After introducing Ir, Zn, and IrZn into the Pt base, XRD patterns verify the bimetallic PtIr and PtZn and ternary PtIrZn alloys with the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure (Fig. 3a, b and Fig. S9, ESI†). Furthermore, fcc Pt peaks in these alloys shift toward higher angles, suggesting a reduced d space due to the alloying. Precisely, the d spaces in PtIrZn1, PtIrZn2, and PtIrZn3 were calculated to be 0.2237, 0.2226, and 0.2223 nm, respectively, smaller than that of PtIr alloys (0.2252 nm). The contraction can be explained by the replacement of Pt by the smaller Ir and Zn atoms, leading to the decreased lattice spacing. Raman spectra (Fig. S10a, ESI†) have shown the identical D and G bands of the ZIF-8 derived carbon, as well as the CeO2 peak.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for several Pt-based catalysts (Fig. 3c and Fig. S10–S13, ESI†) are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) concerning their chemical states and surface species. The atomic concentrations of Pt and Ir in the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 are determined to be 9.2 at% and 7.3 at%, respectively, which are higher than other catalysts, suggesting a stronger interaction between the binary support and Pt alloys.
In addition to pyridinic-, graphitic-, and oxidized-N,38,39 the N 1s XPS peak at 399.7 eV could be ascribed to N species bonded to M sites,40–42 likely Pt–N or Ir–N in the catalyst (Fig. S11, ESI†). The existence of pyridinic N can act as anchor sites for Pt and Ir atoms,26,40 thereby increasing the average binding energy of N 1s. In Fig. 3c, the high-resolution Pt 4f spectra of all tested samples except for the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 can be deconvoluted into two doublets assigned to metallic Pt0 and oxidized Pt(II).41 Differently, two peaks with binding energies of 71.34 and 74.70 eV are observed in the Pt 4f XPS spectrum of PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8, indicating the dominant metallic Pt species. Introducing metals (e.g., Ir and Zn) with smaller electronegativity into Pt could result in a negative shift of binding energies for Pt in its alloys,19 as can be demonstrated by the binding energy shifts of Pt 4f5/2 (0.24 and 0.42 eV) and Pt 4f7/2 (0.30 and 0.48 eV) for the PtIr/C and PtIrZn2/XC-72, respectively, when compared to the Pt/C catalyst (Table S2, ESI†). It should be noticed that the binding energy shifts of Pt 4f5/2 (0.60 eV) and Pt 4f7/2 (0.70 eV) for the PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 are significantly larger than those of the PtIr/C catalyst, indicating the intense electron interactions between Pt and the CeO2 support, as well as the coordinated N, which would be beneficial for electrocatalytic properties.20,38
2.2 Catalyst activity for the AOR
The AOR activity of all catalysts was assessed using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in 1.0 M KOH + 0.1 M NH3 electrolyte. The synergy between CeO2 and ZIF-8 was confirmed by a noticeable AOR activity enhancement when Pt nanoparticles were deposited on various supports (Fig. S14a, ESI†). In alkaline electrolytes, CeO2 is a reservoir for OH adsorption. The adsorbed OH groups at the catalyst surface could participate in the AOR,17,25 leading to an enhanced AOR activity. Several commonly used carbon materials, including carbon black (XC-72), carboxyl-functionalized CNTs (CNT–COOH), and ZIF-8 derived carbon, were integrated with CeO2 for Pt nanoparticle deposition as AOR catalysts. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results (Fig. S14b, ESI†) demonstrate that these studied supports display different charge transfer resistance. Overall, the CNT-containing support presents the smallest resistance, while the ZIF-8 carbon based support shows the largest resistance, which is likely due to their electrical conductivity. However, the ZIF-8 carbon displayed the highest AOR activity (Fig. S14a, ESI†). This is because of its large surface area (Fig. S1, ESI†) and sufficient defects in the ZIF-8-derived carbon benefitting the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles. Additionally, the optimization of the carbon content in the composite support was investigated, and it was found that 33.3 wt% ZIF-8 derived carbon in the support led to the highest AOR activity (Fig. S14c, ESI†). This composition was then used for all further experiments. The chronoamperogram (CA) results, i.e., i–t curves (Fig. S15, ESI†), of all Pt catalysts, are consistent with their corresponding AOR activity determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a sufficiently low scanning rate. Accordingly, the best-performing composite support of CeO2 and ZIF-8 was used for further studies.
To enhance the catalytic activity of Pt catalysts, either Ir or Zn was alloyed with Pt at a molar ratio of 1:1. The improved AOR activities of both PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 and PtZn/CeO2-ZIF-8 were demonstrated in terms of the increased current density at 0.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4a, b and Table S3, ESI†).13,43 A dramatically reduced onset potential (0.417 V vs. RHE) for PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 compared to that of Pt/CeO2-ZIF-8 (0.504 V) is attributed to favorable NH3 adsorption and dehydrogenation.44,45 Also, a reduced onset potential (0.468 V) for PtZn/CeO2-ZIF-8 is likely because alloying Zn could inhibit the competitive hydrogen adsorption.46,47 Furthermore, Ir and Zn were then simultaneously alloyed with Pt to prepare a ternary catalyst. Compared to the binary PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 (peak current density, Jp: 15.7 A g−1, onset potential, Eonset: 0.417 V) and PtZn/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalysts (19.9 A g−1 and 0.468 V), the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst demonstrated a significantly improved AOR activity (Fig. 4a) in terms of both the increased Jp (31.8 A g−1) and the reduced Eonset (0.345 V). The AOR activity is significantly superior to that of the commercial PtIr/C catalyst (25.1 A g−1 and 0.428 V). Note that the PGM loading is used to quantify the current for all studied catalysts.

(b) AOR activity comparison for various catalysts in (a) at 0.5 V vs. RHE. (c) CV curves of the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst in the presence and absence of NH3. (d) Chronoamperograms (CA) of the Pt/CeO2-ZIF-8, commercial PtIr/C, PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8, and PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 in Ar-saturated 1.0 M KOH with 0.1 M NH3 at 900 rpm at 0.65 V vs. RHE under ambient conditions. 
Zn has a high overpotential for hydrogen evolution.15 Therefore, the introduction of Zn into Pt or PtIr could suppress the hydrogen adsorption, as evidenced in the CV curves recorded in Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions for various catalysts, including Pt/CeO2-ZIF-8, PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8, PtZn/CeO2-ZIF-8, and PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Fig. S16, ESI†). The hydrogen adsorption/desorption occurs over 0 to 0.40 V vs. RHE, where the adsorption of ammonia would compete against the hydrogen adsorption. The addition of Zn might inhibit the competitive hydrogen adsorption (Table S4, ESI†), leading to a decrease in onset potentials for the AOR (Fig. 4a).
In general, the amount of introduced third metal (e.g., Zn or Ni13) in the ternary alloys will result in effects on their electronic structure, therefore affecting NH3 adsorption and N–H bond activation differently. Although the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst performs the best, other studied Zn contents in PtIrZn catalysts (e.g., PtIrZn1/CeO2-ZIF-8 and PtIrZn3/CeO2-ZIF-8) do not exhibit enhanced activity compared to the PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst (Fig. 4a, b and Table S3, ESI†). Because only Pt or Ir sites can adsorb NH3 for subsequent dehydrogenation at room temperature, energy factors relating to bond cleavage and geometric factors are sensitive to the Zn content. An appropriate amount of Zn added into the PtIr system is needed to maintain Pt–Ir sites' density for N–H bond activation and breaking. Considering both the Jp and the Eonset (Table S3, ESI†), the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 (molar ratio of Pt/Ir/Zn = 1:1:0.6) was regarded as the optimal ternary PtIrZn AOR catalyst, which was further studied in the next sections.
The synergy between CeO2 and ZIF-8 was further confirmed by the enhanced AOR activity of PtIrZn2 nanoparticles supported on CeO2-ZIF-8 (current density: 15.7 A g−1 at 0.5 V) when compared to the individual CeO2 (current density: 3.6 A g−1 at 0.5 V), and ZIF-8-derived carbon (current density: 10.9 A g−1 at 0.5 V vs. RHE) supports (Table S5, ESI†). The higher AOR activity of the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst is attributed to fast scavenging of the *NH species adsorbed on Pt alloy sites by reaction with OH adsorbed on adjacent CeO2 sites at lower oxidation potential.13,25 More significantly, the optimal PtIrZn catalyst supported on the CeO2-ZIF-8 binary support shows much better AOR activity relative to the commercial XC-72 support (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†). Thus, the interfaces between the active metal sites (i.e., PtIrZn) and advanced support (i.e., CeO2-ZIF-8) are the critical factors for the enhanced AOR activity. Likewise, another composite support consisting of SiO2–CNT–COOH yields enhanced AOR activity.13 The PtIrZn nanoparticles (e.g., Fig. 2b) directly attached to the CeO2 may have enhanced intrinsic AOR activity because the supplied OH groups from CeO2 readily accept a proton and facilitate the critical NH3 dehydrogenation (e.g., NH3,ad + OH− → NH2,ad + H2O + e−). Meanwhile, the ZIF-8-derived carbon typically exhibits a large surface area and porosity, maximizing the Pt alloy utilization and enriching CeO2 and PtIrZn NP interfaces.

Fig. 4c presents typical CV curves for the optimal PtIrZn catalyst in 0.1 M KOH in the presence and absence of NH3, showing an NH3 oxidation peak in the potential range of 0.30–0.95 V. A small pre-peak at around 0.22 V before the AOR peak is likely attributed to the chemical adsorption of NH3.48,49 The deactivation at higher potential ranges (0.64–0.92 V) is due to the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (e.g., *N and *NO) that block the active Pt alloy surface.13,43 CA results (Fig. 4d and Fig. S17, ESI†) further determine that the optimal PtIrZn catalyst has the highest current density (e.g., 3.9 A g−1 after 500 s) at 0.65 V, superior to PtIr/CeO2-ZIF-8 (1.2 A g−1) and commercial PtIr/C (2.2 A g−1) catalysts. It should be pointed out that these CAs show a rapid drop of the current until attaining a steady-state. At the beginning of the reaction, the active sites (i.e., Pt or PtIr) are likely free for adsorbing NH3 molecules. The initial activity drop is due to the reduction of Pt site density caused by the poisoning with *N or *NOx species as the reaction proceeds.13,50
To further determine the superiority of ternary PtIrZn, the most studied Ni and Cu were selected as the third metals alloying with PtIr. As discussed above, Zn's optimal addition into PtIr can suppress the hydrogen adsorption, playing a critical role to facilitate the AOR (Fig. S16 and Table S4, ESI†). In contrast, Ni and Cu's addition to PtIr affects the hydrogen adsorption–desorption behaviors differently (Fig. S18a, ESI†). As a result, the AOR activity for these three ternary alloys is in the order of PtIrZn > PtIrNi > PtIrCu, with the corresponding onset potentials of 0.345, 0.414, and 0.418 V (Fig. S18b and Table S5, ESI†). This activity order was further demonstrated by their current densities (i.e., 15.7, 7.7, and 6.3 A g−1) at 0.5 V (Fig. S18c, ESI†) from CVs and their corresponding CA results (Fig. S18d, ESI†).
Overall, the AOR activity of the best-performing PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst (molar ratio of Pt/Ir = 1:1, Eonset: 0.345 V vs. RHE, Jp: 31.8 A g−1) is superior or comparable to those of many reported catalysts, such as PtZn nanocubes/C catalyst (Eonset: ∼0.5 V vs. RHE, Jp: 405 A g−1),46 PtIr/N-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (molar ratio of Pt/Ir = 1:3, Eonset: ∼0.37 V vs. RHE),51 PtIrNi/SiO2–CNT–COOH (molar ratio of Pt/Ir = 9:1, Eonset: ∼0.399 V vs. RHE, Jp: 124.0 A g−1),13 PtIrNi/CeO2–CNT–COOH (molar ratio of Pt/Ir = 9:1, Eonset: ∼0.465 V vs. RHE, Jp: 34.0 A g−1),13 CuPtRh nanowires (mass ratio of Pt/Ru = 7:1, Eonset: ∼0.49 V),52 and Ir and Ni(OH)2-decorated Pt nanocubes (mass ratio of Pt/Ir = 98:2, Eonset: ∼0.51 V).50 Detailed comparisons of the aforementioned AOR catalysts in terms of Eonset and/or Jp are provided in Table S5 (ESI†).
The PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst also shows good stability for the AOR. Continuous CV cycling over the potential range of 0.05–0.7 V at 500 mV s−1 was conducted in Ar-saturated 1.0 M KOH solutions to evaluate the catalyst's degradation. After 2000 cycles, the PtIr/C benchmark rapidly lost 65% of its initial electrochemically active surface area (ECSA).13 In contrast, the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst exhibited much better cycling stability, retaining more than ∼85% of the initial ECSA (Fig. S19a, ESI†). The ECSA reduction of these two catalysts is in good agreement with their AOR activity losses (Fig. S19a, ESI†). The PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst showed only a 32 mV positive shift of peak potential and a loss of ∼3.0% peak current density, whereas the PtIr/C benchmark displayed ∼46 mV positive shift of peak potential and a loss of 51% peak current density.13 Therefore, both the chronoamperometric durability (Fig. 4d) and the cycling stability (Fig. S19, ESI†) of PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 have exceeded the PtIr/C catalyst.
2.3 Critical factors of AOR rates
In addition to the catalyst, AOR can be affected by critical reaction conditions, such as the operating temperature, NH3 concentration, and KOH concentration.43,53 The effect of operating temperature was investigated on the best-performing PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst and the commercial PtIr/C reference (Fig. 5a). The oxidation peak current densities of both catalysts rise rapidly with the temperature elevating up to 80 °C, attributable to the improved kinetics of NH3 oxidation.53 Strikingly, the AOR onset potential of the PtIrZn catalyst shifts from 0.33 V at 25 °C to 0.25 V at 80 °C, and its Jp increases from 38 to 418 A g−1. The CV curves (Fig. 5a) also exhibit a 102 mV negative shift of the peak potential from 25 to 80 °C. With an increase of temperature, the *N intermediate can form less positive potential, allowing a higher reaction rate at a lower overpotential.13 The N–N dimerization reactions become more accessible at higher temperatures.43,44 Steady-state CA results of the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Fig. S20a, ESI†) at different temperatures are consistent with its CV results, further confirming the advantage of the elevated temperatures for the AOR. Fig. 6b shows the Arrhenius plots for the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 and the commercial PtIr/C catalysts at 0.5 V. Good linear relationships are achieved by plotting log(J) and 1/T, indicating that the reaction mechanism is not changed with increasing temperature.53 According to the Arrhenius law, their activation energy can be calculated using the equation.53,54 The activation energies at 0.5 V were calculated to be 36.7 and 50.8 kJ mol−1 for the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 and commercial PtIr/C catalysts, respectively (Fig. 5b). The lower activation energy of the PtIrZn catalyst unveils its higher intrinsic activity, faster charge transfer process, and less energy-consumption in the reaction.53

AOR activity of the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst is increased with the NH3 concentration (Fig. 5c). The current density was increased from 9.4 to 17.6 A g−1 when the concentrations of NH3 are from 0.05 to 1.0 M at 0.5 V (Fig. 5d). Higher NH3 concentrations lead to faster current attenuation (Fig. S20b, ESI†), which can be attested by a lower remaining current density at 1.0 M NH3 (4.8 A g−1) than 0.5 M NH3 (5.1 A g−1) after 500 s. These results indicate that more poisonous adsorbates could be accumulated in an electrolyte with a higher NH3 concentration during the AOR.
Given a constant NH3 concentration and under room temperature, the OH− concentration in the electrolytes can substantially influence the AOR rates. Fig. 5d and Fig. S20c (ESI†). CA tests show the effect of KOH concentration on the AOR activity of the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst. Higher OH− concentration can lower the AOR onset potential. It also increases the peak current density (Fig. 5e). When the OH− concentrations are increased from 1.0 to 5.0 M, the onset potentials are reduced from 0.345 to 0.314 V, and the peak current densities are increased from 31.8 to 65.1 A g−1. The improved AOR activity at higher OH− concentration is likely due to smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct = 16.6, 19.8, and 60.4 Ω for 5.0, 3.0, and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, Fig. 5f).7,55
2.4 Theoretical studies of the AOR
To understand Zn's role in the ternary PtIrZn catalyst for the AOR, we performed DFT calculations for appropriate reaction steps on three models, including bimetallic Pt2Ir2 and Pt2Ir2 systems with a relatively low and medium Zn content (Pt2Ir2–Znlc and Pt2Ir2–Znmc). All models were simulated in the fcc phase. The (100)-termination was chosen because of its unique structure toward N–N coupling, a crucial step for ammonia oxidation.56 Because of Zn's strong oxophility and the abundance of OHad from the CeO2 support, the surface bridge sites are pre-covered with 1/4 ML *OH species. The limiting potential of *NH2 to *NH with the hydrogen bonding interaction with OH is a useful indicator for capturing the onset potential of the AOR on Pt(100) and its alloys.13,56 *NH–*NH dimerization is the dominant pathway toward N2 formation. Fig. 6 shows the free energy diagram of the initial steps of NH3 oxidization at 0 V. Compared to the Pt–Ir bridge site on Pt2Ir2(100), a low concentration of Zn (preferred at the surface because of strong interaction with *OH) stabilizes the *NH2 and *NH intermediates only slightly with a reduction of the limiting potential <0.03 V. The Zn atom has a weaker d–d coupling to the Pt–Ir group d-orbitals, which will shift up the d-band and facilitate the hydrogenation of *NH2 species. Fortunately, the sp-electron transfer from the electron-rich Zn atoms to the Pt–Ir site has an opposite effect. As the Zn concentration increases in the Pt2Ir2–Znmc model, the stabilization of *NH is 0.1 eV more than the *NH2 species, which leads to a 0.1 V reduced onset potential of the PtIrZn catalyst as observed experimentally. We attributed this effect to Zn-induced electronic structure change as the average of the d-band center is increased from −0.7 eV in the Pt2Ir2 to −0.52 eV in the Pt2Ir2–Znmc. Another effect is the competitive adsorption between *H and *NH3. At Pt(100), the adsorption/desorption of *H occurs at the potential of 0.2–0.4 V, which overlaps with the operating potential of AOR at ∼0.3 V. The strongly binding *H might block the active Pt–Ir site for the NH3 adsorption. The free energy of *NH3 adsorption at the Pt–Ir site is 0.6 eV stronger than Pt(100). Although Zn stabilizes both intermediates on PtIrZn catalysts, it becomes more favorable for *H removal with *NH3 adsorption, resulting in a less positive potential of *H oxidation. This result is impressive since it is generally believed that Zn destabilizes the *H, prohibiting the HER. Our DFT calculations suggest that incorporating Zn into PtIr leads to a stronger *NH3 adsorption than *H adsorption, which is kinetically favorable for the AOR.
2.5 Low-temperature direct ammonia fuel cell performance
The typical set-up for a DAFC is illustrated in Fig. 7a. NH3 reacts with OH− and is oxidized at the anode to provide electrons and generate N2 (2NH3 + 6OH− = N2 + 6H2O + 6e−, E0 = −0.77 V vs. SHE). O2 consumes electrons and generates OH− (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− = 4OH−, E0 = 0.401 V vs. SHE) at the cathode.11 In theory, the overall reaction can generate a cell voltage up to 1.17 V, which is only slightly lower than an H2–O2 fuel cell.

(b) AOR activity comparison of PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Pt–Ir, 10 wt%), commercial PtIr/C (Pt–Ir, 40 wt%), PtIr/SiO2–CNT–COOH (Pt–Ir, 10 wt%), and PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH (Pt–Ir, 20 wt%) in 1.0 M KOH + 0.1 M NH3 at 5 mV s−1 and 900 rpm under ambient conditions. (c) Polarization curves and power density curves of DAFCs with PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8, PtIr/C, PtIr/SiO2–CNT–COOH, and PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH anodes. The ORR cathode catalyst is a Fe-based commercial Acta 4020. The anode contains 1.0 mgPGM cm−2 with 10 wt% PAP-TP (terphenyl-based) ionomer. The cathode contains 2.0 mg cm−2 of Acta 4020 with 20 wt% PAP-TP ionomer. The hydroxide exchange membrane (HEM) is PAP-TP (81 μm thickness). Testing conditions: cell temperature of 95 °C, 7.0 M NH3 in 1.25 M KOH aqueous solution (5.0 mL min−1) at 1.0 bar backpressure; O2 (500 mL min−1) at 2.0 bar backpressures. 
Unlike in aqueous electrolytes, high-performance OH−-exchange membranes and ionomers developed at the University of Delaware were integrated with these studied PtIrZn catalysts for fabricating membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for DAFC studies.7,57 The cathode is an Acta 4020 catalyst (i.e., 3.5 wt% transition iron metal on carbon support) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). During the DAFC studies, we selected four PtIr-based catalysts concerning the variations of supports (i.e., CeO2/ZIF-8-carbon, SiO2/CNT–COOH, and commercial XC-72) and metal nanoparticles (i.e., PtIr and PtIrZn2, 1.0 mgPGM cm−2). RDE measurements (Fig. 7b) indicate that their AOR activities in an aqueous electrolyte (KOH + NH3) follow the order: PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH > PtIr/SiO2–CNT–COOH > PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 > commercial PtIr/C, as evidenced by their current densities of 32.4, 24.7, 15.7, and 10.4 A g−1 at 0.5 V, respectively.
The polarization curves of DAFCs at 95 °C by using different anode catalysts were recorded as shown in Fig. 7c. The open-circuit voltages (OCVs) with these studied PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8, PtIr/SiO2–CNT–COOH, and PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH anodes are 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70 V, respectively, comparable to that of the commercial PtIr/C (0.69 V). The MEA testing results show a different trend to their AOR onset potentials evaluated by RDE (Fig. 7b). A similar phenomenon was found on the peak power densities, showing 91 mW cm−2 for the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8, 241 mW cm−2 for the PtIr/C, 282 mW cm−2 for the PtIr/SiO2-CNT-COOH, and 314 mW cm−2 for the PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH. From the high-frequency resistance (HFR) result recorded by the EIS module of the fuel cell test station, the HFR of MEA with the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 catalyst is 110 mΩ cm−2, which is much larger than those of MEAs with PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH and PtIr/SiO2–CNT–COOH, which are 65 mΩ cm−2 for both. The HFR of MEA with commercial PtIr/C is 50 mΩ cm−2. The resistance comparison of MEAs is inconsistent with Nyquist plots recorded by using RDE (Fig. S21, ESI†).
Nevertheless, the improved cell performance of the PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH relative to the PtIr/SiO2–CNT–COOH further determines the significance of introducing Zn into PtIr alloys. The higher power density of DAFCs with the catalysts supported on the SiO2/CNT–COOH support also justifies the critical role of the supports in boosting charge and mass transport within electrodes (Fig. 7c). The relatively poor DAFC performance with the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 anode may be due to the high resistance caused by non-uniform ionomer distribution and less efficient mass transport caused by dominant micropores in the ZIF-8-derived carbon. In contrast, the SiO2–CNT–COOH composite support can provide more efficient charge and mass transport, which is critical for enhanced MEA performance.58
Compared to previous DAFC performance in the literature, the PtIrZn2/SiO2–CNT–COOH anode has the best performance (Table S6, ESI†). Notably, given the significant activity difference between the PtIrZn/SiO2–CNT–COOH and the commercial PtIr/C (Fig. 7b), we should expect further improved DAFC performance with continuously studying MEA design and fabrication. It should be noted that, apart from intrinsic activity, the catalyst morphology and structures are essential for MEA performance. It is often challenging to directly transfer high RDE activity in aqueous electrolytes to solid-state electrolyte-based MEA performance because of the complicated triple-phase interfaces for charge and mass transports in thick and porous electrodes.59 Based on the obtained knowledge on H2–O2 and direct methanol fuel cells,60–62 DAFC performance can be improved by increasing the PGM loading on the supports, optimizing the interaction between PtIrZn alloy NPs and the support, engineering the interfaces of the catalyst and the ionomer for OH− transfer within the electrode, and improving electrode structures with better ammonia permeability.7,9,63
3. Conclusions
In summary, inspired by theoretical understanding, we designed and synthesized PtIrZn ternary alloy catalysts supported on various composite supports for the AOR in DAFCs. In particular, well-defined PtIrZn alloy nanoparticles can be uniformly dispersed on a composite support consisting of CeO2, and ZIF-8 derived carbon, with an average diameter of 2.3 ± 0.2 nm. In principle, CeO2 can serve as a Lewis base and provide OH for facilitating the AOR. The high surface area, dominant porosity, and N dopant in the ZIF-8-derived carbon can be favorable for generating fine alloy nanoparticles during the synthesis. The combination of CeO2 and ZIF-8 carbon can enrich the CeO2–Pt alloy interfaces, thus enhancing the AOR activity. Similarly, we further employed the SiO2–CNT–COOH composite support for preparing the ternary PtIrZn catalyst. Unlike CeO2, SiO2 possesses a high surface area and plays a similar role in facilitating the AOR by providing OH groups. It should be noted that the combination of CeO2 and CNTs was explored as well, but both have low surface areas and cannot achieve uniform metal NP dispersion.
RDE results indicate that the optimal PtIrZn catalyst at a molar ratio of 1:1:0.6 shows superior AOR activity and stability in alkaline media relative to the commercial PtIr/C. DFT calculations suggest that Zn atoms' addition into the PtIr alloy modulates the electronic structure of Pt–Ir active ensembles on the (100) surface for facilitating dehydrogenation steps of adsorbed NH3. Similar to Zn's role in enhancing AOR activity, Ni or Cu were also introduced into the PtIr baseline. Their AOR activities are in the order of PtIrZn > PtIrNi > PtIrCu. The kinetics of AOR is strongly dependent on the operation temperature, NH3 concentration, and KOH concentration in aqueous electrolytes. The increasing temperature results in a significantly increased current density and reduced overpotentials. The AOR activity is also enhanced with NH3 concentration, but a higher concentration of NH3 may accelerate the catalyst deactivation. Higher OH− concentration lowers the AOR onset potential and increases the peak current density, likely due to the fast AOR kinetics and smaller charge transfer resistances.
Multiple studied PtIrZn catalysts and the commercial PtIr/C were further evaluated in DAFCs by using OH− exchange membranes and ionomers. At first, the PtIrZn2/CeO2-ZIF-8 (Pt–Ir, 10 wt%) anode catalyst does not present encouraging DAFC performance and only exhibited a moderate peak power density of 91 mW cm−2 due to a large charge transfer resistance and low mass transport. When PtIrZn alloy NPs were deposited on an alternative composite support consisting of high-surface-area SiO2 and highly electrically conductive CNT–COOH, the PtIrZn/SiO2–CNT–COOH anode catalyst achieved a compelling peak power density of 314 mW cm−2, much higher than PtIr/SiO2-CNT-COOH (282 mW cm−2) and PtIr/C (241 mW cm−2) controls. The enhanced DAFC performance further justifies the importance of innovative supports and PtIrZn catalysts for the AOR in actual MEAs. Further engineering electrode structures and MEA fabrication concerning advanced catalyst and support designs, catalyst/ionomer interfaces, and porosity for NH3 permeability could dramatically improve DAFC performance for promising transportation and other applications.

Broader context
The development of clean hydrogen fuel cells is crucial for energy and environment sustainability, but we still face grand challenges in terms of difficulties of hydrogen production, transportation, distribution, and storage. Alternatively, ammonia, a carbon-neutral fuel, is an ideal hydrogen carrier, which can be readily transported and stored using existing infrastructures, and then directly utilized for energy applications through a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC). However, the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) in DAFCs requires substantial precious metal catalysts (e.g., Pt and Ir), leading to prohibitively high cost. This research is dedicated to reducing the cost of DAFCs by developing advanced AOR catalysts with reduced precious metal loadings and improved catalytic performance. High-performance DAFCs in the future can provide power sources without CO2 emission for a variety of applications, including electric vehicles, portable electronics, and stationary residencies.
