    , Accepted 26th July 2013First published on 29th July 2013AbstractA TiO2 nanotubes array film with nanowires directly formed on top (denoted as TiO2 NTWs) was prepared by an anodization method (potentiostatic anodization growth). Bi2S3 QDs were sensitized on the CdS/TiO2 NTWs array by a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (S-SILAR). A short-circuit photocurrent density of 2.16 mA cm−2 was obtained under an illumination of AM 1.5 G. The data of the photoelectrochemical performance test show that Bi2S3/CdS co-modification can boost the photocurrent density of the bare TiO2 NTWs by up to 308%. The photocatalytic activity was tested by treating rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) solutions, which were degraded completely after 240 min and 210 min, respectively. The present study shows the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs array can be applied in photocatalytic devices, and the greatest advantages are low-cost, easy reuse and recyclability.
1. Introduction
The global energy crisis and environmental pollution are two serious problems faced by humans now. Photoelectrochemistry and photocatalysis are two potential approaches to solve worldwide energy-related environmental issues because solar energy is considered as a clean and inexhaustible energy source.1 Thus, solar-to-electric energy conversion is an important method in solar applications. Among various oxide semiconductors, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been employed widely, in for example tissue engineering scaffolds,2,3 generation of hydrogen by water photoelectrolysis,4,5 self-cleaning photocatalytic surfaces and devices,6–9 and dye sensitized solar cells.10,11 One-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures, particularly TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs), have received great attention because of their superior photocatalytic and photoelectronic performance over TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs).12–14 Compared with simple TiO2 NT, TiO2 nanotubes with nanowires directly formed on top (denoted as TiO2 NTWs) have enlarged surface areas and can provide a direct pathway for photogenerated electron transfer, which accordingly leads to the enhancement of light harvesting and charge separation. Thus they are widely used as photocatalysts in dye degradation.15,16
TiO2 in all its crystal forms is a wide-band gap semiconductor (Eg ≈ 3.2 eV). However, the wide-band gap limits its absorption to the ultraviolet region which takes only about 3–5% of the solar spectrum. Various attempts have been made to sensitize TiO2 with guest materials such as organic dye and narrow band gap semiconductors to further increase the efficiency and widen its photoelectrochemical activity in the visible light region,17 respectively. In examples of the latter, Grimes et al. investigated CdS/TiO2 and PbS/TiO2 NTAs prepared by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method (SILAR) and electrodeposition,18,19 Lin et al. used a simple sequence chemical bath deposition technique to prepare stable and uniform nanostructured ZnS/CdS/TiO2 electrodes in an alcohol solution system,20 Lee et al. have shown that multilayered semiconductor (CdS/CdSe/ZnS) layers were prepared by SILAR on the surface of TiO2 mesoporous films.21
Here, we report the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs array as a new photoactive composite, and the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties were studied in detail. There are three reasons for this strategy: firstly, Bi2S3 and CdS have attracted significant interest because of their superior properties such as high absorption co-efficient, direct band gap energy, high figure of merit, and good chemical stability.22,23 Secondly, the conduction band of Bi2S3 is less anodic than the conduction band of TiO2 and CdS, and the valence band of this sensitizer is more cathodic than the valence band of TiO2 and CdS.24,25 This proper band structure is good for charge separation and transfer efficiency.26,27 Finally, compared with powder catalysts, the photocatalyst of the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs array is low-cost, easy reusable and recyclable.
From a method perspective, a variety of deposition techniques have been used to grow Bi2S3 thin films, such as gas solution interface,28 electrode-position,29 thermal evaporation,30 chemical bath deposition,31 and SILAR.32 Due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, SILAR has proved to be a versatile solution growth technique for growing nanostructured thin films.13,26,33 However, deposition on CdS/TiO2 NTWs arrays with Bi2S3 QDs by this simple SILAR technique has been scarcely reported. Initially, many trials were made to optimize the concentration of solution, the time of reaction, and the temperature of anneal so that good properties resulted. Also, the S-SILAR method of Bi2S3 QDs sensitized CdS/TiO2 NTWs was carried out a number of times and confirmed the reproducibility. Therefore, we controlled one cycle as the best cycle of Bi2S3 for Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs array to reduce the time, simplify the steps, and save the costs. In addition, we do not need to add any other chemical reagents to adjust the pH of the cationic and anionic solutions. In this article, our results show that the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 heterostructured NTWs exhibit substantially higher visible-light-driven photoactivity in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) solution. This work not only demonstrates a simple method to prepare Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs with high photoactivity, but also provides important insights into the design and fabrication of high-performance photoanodes and photocatalysts. A detailed synthesis process, characterization, and photoactivity of this sample are discussed in this article.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of self-organized TiO2 NTWs array
Pure Ti foil (4 cm × 3 cm, 0.4 mm thick, 99.9% purity) before anodization was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, isopropanol and ethanol, followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying in a flow of N2. The anodization was performed in a two-electrode configuration with titanium foil as the working electrode and graphite plate as the counter electrode under constant potential at room temperature. A direct current (dc) stabilized voltage and current power supply (WYJ60V3A, Pingguo instrumentation Co. Ltd. China) were employed as the voltage source to drive the anodization, and the distance between the two electrodes was 4 cm. Electrochemical anodization was performed at 40 V for 1 h in an electrolyte mixture containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 5.0 vol% deionized H2O dissolved in the ethylene glycol. To induce crystallinity the initially amorphous as-anodized films were subjected to a 2 h anneal in air at 450 °C.
2.2. Preparation of QDs sensitized TiO2 NTWs array films
QDs were assembled onto TiO2 by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The SILAR method is based on sequential reaction on the substrate surface by successive immersion of the substrate into separate cationic and anionic precursor solutions at room temperature. A two beaker SILAR system is used for deposition of CdS/TiO2 NTWs. Firstly, the TiO2 NTWs films were soaked in ethanol solution which contains 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2·4H2O for 10 min; following immersion, the films were rinsed with pure ethanol and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. Secondly, it was immersed into a 0.5 M Na2S·9H2O aqueous solution for another 10 min, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. The entire procedure was termed as one cycle. Then, the samples were annealed at 300 °C for 1 h.
The main points of Bi2S3 modification are as follows: to begin with, the cationic precursor consists of 4 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dissolved in 100 ml of acetone. Similarly, the anionic precursor was prepared by mixing 0.26 M Na2S·9H2O and 100 ml deionized water. Then, the deposition of one cycle consists of four steps: (i) immersing the sample of CdS/TiO2 NTWs in the cationic precursor solution for 10 min for the complex adsorption; (ii) rinsing the sample in acetone to remove the loosely bounded ions, and drying at 150 °C for 10 min; (iii) immersing the sample in the anionic precursor for 10 min for the adsorption of sulfur ions to react with pre-adsorbed bismuth ions; and (iv) rinsing the sample again in deionized water to remove the loosely bound ions. Eventually, the samples were annealed at 240 °C for 4 h.
2.3. Characterization
A model JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used to characterize the morphologies of the samples. HRTEM images were obtained with a JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission microscope operating at 200 kV. The crystal structure of the as-prepared films were characterized by a Rigaku D/max-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Optical characterization of the films was performed using a UV-3150 double-beam spectrophotometer.
2.4. Photovoltaic measurements
The photoelectrochemical properties were investigated using the conventional three-electrode system, which is made of a quartz cell linked with the electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, model CHI601C). As-prepared film electrodes were used as the working electrode, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was composed of 0.25 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. The CHI electrochemical workstation was used to measure dark and illuminated current at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Sunlight was simulated with a 500 W xenon lamp (Spectra Physics). The light intensity was calibrated by using a laser powermeter (BG26M92C, Midwest Group), equivalent to AM 1.5 G light at 100 mW cm−2.
2.5. Photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B and methyl orange
RhB and MO were considered as two model contaminants in the purification of dye wastewater. The reaction was conducted in a 250 mL beaker, with an aluminum foil cover to prevent the ambient light from penetrating through the beaker. The fabricated TiO2 NTWs, CdS/TiO2 NTWs, Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs were cut to the same size of 1.0 cm × 2.0 cm, and were vertically placed in the center of the beaker for photocatalytic degradation experiments. The beaker contained 100 mL of RhB (10−5 M) or MO (10−5 M) in aqueous solution. Subsequently, a 100 mW Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) was positioned in the center of the beaker. The entire apparatus was carefully set to prevent the ambient light from disturbing the photoreaction, which was carried out for a total of 250 min. During light irradiation, 10 mL of the solution was sampled every 30 min. The concentration of this sample solution was measured by UV-vis spectroscopy at 464 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sample characterization
The morphology and structural characteristic of the films were obtained from SEM analysis. Fig. 1 shows the micrographs representing the bare TiO2 NTWs, CdS/TiO2 NTWs and Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs. Fig. 1A shows a typical SEM image of TiO2 NTWs. The nanowires are so loosely arranged that some bare pore openings are exposed. The formation of nanowires on the top of the nanotubes can be attributed to the etching effects of the fluoride containing electrolyte, which leads to thinning and collapse of TiO2 nanotubes. Therefore, the NTWs structure would inherit the advantages of both the nanotube and nanowire in charge separation, electronic transport, and light harvesting.34,14Fig. 1B shows cross-section FESEM images of the resulting samples. The bare TiO2 NTWs array are uniformly formed with tube lengths of 2.6–2.8 μm and diameters of ∼110 nm. Fig. 1C and D show top and side views of the TiO2 NTWs after being coated with CdS (4 cycles). We can find that the TiO2/CdS NTWs have rougher surfaces. An early report35 by Wassell and Embery found the surface of TiO2 to be negatively charged. So, electropositive atoms can be combined with TiO2. Hence, it is reasonable to infer that when the TiO2 NTW arrays are dipped into the ethanol solution containing Cd2+, the following interaction of the TiO2 film with Cd(NO3)2 solution is the adsorption of Cd2+ after the ethanol solution has penetrated into the space of the TiO2 NTW arrays. And it is reasonable to deduce that CdS QDs can be absorbed onto the surface of TiO2 after dipping the film into S2− aqueous solution for another 10 min. After deposition of Bi2S3 (1 cycle) by the same mechanism, the surfaces of TiO2/CdS NTWs become much rougher by the S-SILAR method, as shown in Fig. 1E and F.

A typical TEM image of a TiO2 NTWs array deposited with CdS/Bi2S3 for 4 cycles/1 cycles is shown in Fig. 2A, where we can observe that the inner and outer surface areas of the TiO2 NTWs array have been uniformly covered with nanoparticles. As we can see in the HR-TEM image of TiO2 NTWs/CdS (4 cycles)/Bi2S3 (1 cycle) in the inset of Fig. 2A, the nanoparticles sizes are about 5 to 10 nm. Fig. 2B provides a high-resolution TEM image of TiO2/CdS, which shows that a crystalline CdS quantum dot with a size of ∼5 nm is grown on the TiO2 NTWs. The lattice distances shown in Fig. 2B correspond well with the (103) plane of anatase TiO2 [JCPDS no. 86-1157] and (101) plane of hexagonal CdS [JCPDS no. 80-0006]. In Fig. 2C, we can see that the (221) and (141) planes, respectively, of the orthorhombic phase Bi2S3 [JCPDS no. 6-333] are stacked on the (103) planes of TiO2 with different angles. In contrast to the two interfacial structures, there is a decreased density of trap states that act as recombination centers and leads to faster electron transport at the interface of TiO2/CdS than TiO2/Bi2S3, which explains the higher electron injection efficiency in TiO2/CdS. The larger crystallite appearing in the under region of Fig. 2D is identified to be TiO2. The lattice spacing measured for this crystalline plane is 0.197 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of anatase TiO2. Around the TiO2 crystallite, fine crystallites with various orientations and lattice spacing are observed. By carefully measuring the lattice parameters and comparing with the data in JCPDS, the crystallites connecting to the TiO2 are CdS, and Bi2S3 is located outside by the CdS (Fig. 2D). STEM images and corresponding STEM-EDX elemental mapping of the sample (TiO2 NTWs/CdS (4 cycles)/Bi2S3 (1 cycle)) display that Cd, S, and Bi elements are over the whole TiO2 NTWs. Therefore, TEM and EDX images clearly reveal that CdS and Bi2S3 nanocrystals have been successfully grown on the surface of the TiO2 NTWs.

The phase composition and phase structure of the samples were examined by X-ray diffractometry and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer respectively. Fig. 3A shows the XRD patterns for bare TiO2 NTWs arrays, CdS sensitized TiO2 NTWs arrays and Bi2S3/CdS cosensitized TiO2 NTWs arrays. The bare TiO2 NTW arrays were readily crystallized in anatase and rutile phases after annealing in air at 450 °C for 2 h as shown in Fig. 3A. After the sensitization of CdS nanocrystals (middle pattern Fig. 3A), no fresh evident diffraction peaks are observed for the little amount of CdS QDs and their high dispersion on the TiO2 surface. In the XRD upper patterns it can be observed that the peaks of anatase TiO2 at 25.18° are evidently broadened which is ascribed to the new peak at 25.22° derived from the {310} crystal planes of orthorhombic Bi2S3. At the same time, we performed energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis to determine the existence in Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 (Fig. 3B). Cd, Bi and S elements are found to be present.

To study the optical absorption properties of the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 heterostructure, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra in the range of 300–800 nm were investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the maximum peak of the TiO2 NTWs film occurs at around 370 nm, and no significant absorbance for visible light can be seen because of its large energy gap (3.2 eV). As known from the quantum-confinement effect, when the particle size is reduced to the quantum size, the number of atoms in a particle will enormously decrease and a larger interval between the energy level will emerge. Therefore, the energy level will change from quasi-continuous phase to split phase, and the energy gap will become so wide that the blue-shift in the absorption occurs. It is thus thought that the growth of CdS particles may be responsible for the red-shift of the absorption edge. It is also noteworthy that the absorption edges are ca. 540 nm for CdS/TiO2 while the corresponding band gap is 2.3 eV, which is higher than that reported for bulk CdS (2.2 eV). And, the sizes of the Bi2S3 (less than 10 nm) on the CdS/TiO2 NTWs array films in our work are still within the scale of QDs. The absorption edges are ca. 580 nm for Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 while the corresponding band gap is 2.1 eV, which is higher than that reported for bulk Bi2S3 (1.3 eV).36

3.2. Photoelectrochemical behaviors
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests were carried out to demonstrate the enhancement of electron transfer characteristics in the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 ternary hybrid system. The effect of S-SILAR cycles on the device performance had been carefully studied and for the concentrations used here, the optimum number of cycles was found to be four for CdS and one for Bi2S3.

Fig. 5A provides the photocurrent responses of the TiO2 NTWs under a 0 V bias vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The bare TiO2 NTWs show very low photocurrent density under visible irradiation, and Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs exhibit much higher photocurrent density than that of TiO2 NTWs. Meanwhile, Fig. 5B shows the typical photocurrent density (J) versus potential (V) curves with three different NTWs samples: TiO2, CdS/TiO2, and Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2. The observed dark current density for both the TiO2 and the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 electrodes are negligible. For the photocatalyst based on the bare TiO2 NTWs array, the photocurrent density is 0.53 mA cm−2, while the photocurrent density of the as-prepared CdS (4 cycles)/TiO2 electrode is significantly increased to 1.69 mA cm−2. Finally, when the Bi2S3 and CdS cosensitized TiO2 NTWs array, the photocurrent density of 2.16 mA cm−2 is attained. These results indicate that the cascaded positioning of CBs in the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 hybrid induced better charge separation and efficient electron transfer.37

The active area was strictly kept within 1 cm2, and the photoelectrodes were measured versus saturated Ag/AgCl electrode under simulated sunlight with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in 0.25 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. 
3.3. Photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B and methyl orange

Fig. 6A shows the photodecomposition behavior of RhB dye by TiO2, CdS/TiO2, and Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs under visible irradiation. The concentration of RhB decreases with irradiation time because of the photodegradation.8 The ratio of RhB concentration C/C0 could be calculated as follows where C0 and C are the concentration of RhB at irradiation time 0 and t. RhB degraded by the photocatalysts was irradiated for 250 min under a Xe lamp. After 240 min of visible irradiation, 100% of RhB was decomposed by Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs, whereas 44.0 and 3.0% of RhB was decomposed by CdS/TiO2 NTWs and bare TiO2 NTWs, respectively. To test the repeatability of RhB degradation on the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs, we carried out the degradation experiment repeatedly three times. As shown in Fig. 6B, the RhB is degraded after every injection of the RhB solution, and the photocatalyst is stable under repeated application with nearly constant photodecomposition rate, showing that the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs were not deactivated during the photocatalytic oxidation of the pollutant molecules. Besides RhB, MO has been widely used in various fields, leading to an increased problem of its disposal and treatment. In order to determine the repeatability of MO degradation on the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs, we carried out the degradation experiment repeatedly three times. The result is shown in Fig. 6C. MO removal efficiency under the Xe lamp is 100%, 100% and 96% on Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs, secondary Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs and third Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs, respectively. It is clear that there is no obvious loss of photocatalytic activity in the succeeding runs. This indicates that the photocatalyst is stable during the photocatalytic reaction. These results are direct evidence of the existence of heterojunctions in the prepared Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs photocatalysts, which retard the electron–hole recombination and hence increase the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the Bi2S3 and CdS have grown on the TiO2 NTWs by the S-SILAR technique, and they cannot fall off easily from the TiO2 NTWs array to avoid secondary pollution. At the same time, this sample is low-cost, and easily reused and recycled.

3.4. Mechanism discussion
The physical mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 nanostructures decorated with two kinds of low band gap semiconductors has been investigated. Our device configuration is depicted in Scheme 1. It can be observed that the potentials of conduction bands (CBs) of Bi2S3 and CdS are more negative than bare TiO2. The stepwise band-edge structure indicates that photogenerated electrons in Bi2S3 efficiently transfer to TiO2 through the CB of CdS and would trigger a higher resistance to transport excited electrons back to the electrolyte, leading to enhancement of photoelectrochemical properties of the cosensitized electrode.

However, the chemical mechanism of enhanced photocatalysis is somewhat different than the physical mechanism. The tubular and crystal structure of TiO2 is useful for separating and transferring generated electrons to the collector electrode (Ti substrate foil), which contributed to the increasing photocurrent density. However, in the case of photocatalysis, the accumulated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 can be transferred to oxygen to form H2O2 (eqn (4) and (5)), which could be further reduced to hydroxyl radicals (eqn (6)). The formed hydroxyl radicals could further degrade or mineralize organic dye RhB or MO to end products (H2O and CO2) (eqn (7)). Furthermore, the holes accumulated in the valence band of CdS could be consumed by participating in reactions with RhB/MO molecules directly to form intermediates or mineralized products (eqn (8)). As can be seen from Fig. 5, the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs exhibit much higher photocurrent density and photocatalytic efficiency than TiO2 NTWs under visible illumination. As analyzed from SEM and TEM (Fig. 1 and 2), Bi2S3 QDs sensitized TiO2/CdS NTWs prepared through the S-SILAR approach led to a uniform and intimate coating of Bi2S3 QDs inside TiO2/CdS NTWs. Once CdS and Bi2S3 are loaded onto the surface of TiO2 NTWs, the heterojunction structure may form, which not only improves the separation of electrons and holes, but also inhibits the recombination of the photogenerated hole–electron pairs effectively and prolongs the life of the photogenerated charge carriers.38,39 Furthermore, UV results show that the visible light absorption capability of TiO2 NTWs sensitized with CdS and Bi2S3 can be significantly improved compared with TiO2 NTWs.40,41 These factors contribute to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs. Bi2S3 + hν → Bi2S3(e + h)(1) Bi2S3(e) + CdS → Bi2S3 + CdS(e)(2) CdS(e) + TiO2 → CdS + TiO2(e)(3) TiO2(e) + O2 → TiO2 + O2˙−(4) O2˙− + TiO2(e) + H+ → H2O2(5) H2O2 + O2˙− → OH˙ + OH− + O2(6) OH˙ + RhB/MO → degraded or mineralized products(7) Bi2S3(h) + RhB/MO → degraded or mineralized products(8)
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the ternary hybrid Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 has been fabricated by S-SILAR deposition as a model hybrid system and tested for photocatalytic and PEC activities. The best performance of the ternary hybrid was cosensitized 4 cycles of CdS plus 1 cycle of Bi2S3 on TiO2 NTWs. The S-SILAR technique compared with a conventional SILAR approach has many advantages, including reducing the time, simplifying the steps, and saving costs. Then, the ternary hybrid showed significant enhancement in both the photocatalytic activity and PEC activity compared with bare TiO2 NTWs array. The cascaded CB positioning of Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 generates a built-in potential gradient. This architecture leads to enhanced light absorption, creates an efficient charge-carrier transfer channel and would trigger a high resistance to transport of excited electrons. In addition, the NTWs array structure provides a direct electron pathway to the Ti substrate over a large surface area. Due to these advantages, the materials result in a large photogenerated photocurrent of 2.16 mA cm−2, and the RhB and MO solutions were degraded completely after 240 min and 210 min, respectively. The measurements of PEC and photocatalytic activity also confirmed that the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 ternary hybrid has a lower charge-transfer resistance compared with the binary hybrids and bare TiO2 electrodes. Moreover, the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 NTWs catalyst is low-cost, reusable and recyclable. On the basis of our results, it is certain that the Bi2S3/CdS/TiO2 ternary hybrid having a proper band gap has proved itself as a promising material for photocatalytic devices.
