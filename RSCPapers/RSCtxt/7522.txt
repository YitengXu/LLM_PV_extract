    , Accepted 19th September 2019First published on 20th September 2019AbstractAn outmost selenophene-functionalized electron-rich central core (indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene) and a new non-halogenated A–D–A architecture non-fullerene small molecular acceptor (NF-SMA) (TSeTIC) based on indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene as the central unit and thiophene-fused IC as a terminal group was designed and synthesized for high performance organic solar cells. In contrast to the similar NF-SMA (TTTIC) with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit, TSeTIC exhibited a stronger and red-shifted absorption spectrum, higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, and enhanced electron mobility in neat thin films. Furthermore, a TSeTIC/PM6-based device presented higher hole/electron mobility, better phase separation features with favorable morphology, and higher charge dissociation and collection efficiency than a TTTIC/PM6-based device, resulting in remarkably improved Jsc and FF without sacrificing the Voc. Therefore, compared to the best PCE of 12.05% with an energy loss (Eloss) of 0.64 eV for the PM6/TTTIC device, the optimized PM6/TSeTIC device yields a significantly higher PCE of 13.71% with a higher FF of 75.9% and decreased Eloss of 0.60 eV. It is worth noting that the excellent PCE of 13.71% is the highest recorded for A–D–A structural NF-SMAs with thiophene-containing terminal groups for binary organic solar cells. These results demonstrate that the synergistic strategy of using an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene core unit and thiophene-containing IC end group is a promising avenue to enhance the PCE of non-halogenated NF-SMAs with high Voc and FF as well as low Eloss.
Introduction
Owing to their advantages, such as light weight, flexible large-area fabrication, transparency, and potential low cost, bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) blended with p-type conjugated polymers and n-type organic semiconductors have received considerable attention in the past decade.1–5 Recently, various emerging non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) have significantly promoted the rapid development of high performance BHJ-OSCs to their enhanced solar photon harvesting ability, their synthetic accessibility, and their tuneable energy levels.6–14 Among these achievements, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture NF-SMAs, where an electron-rich fused-ring core is flanked by two 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) molecules or derivatives, have received considerable attention in the field of BHJ-OSCs.15–18 Thus, a large number of A–D–A NF-SMAs have been developed based on this molecular design strategy, including extending the conjugation length of the rigid aromatic core, changing the side-chain of the fused ring, and modifying the end-capped groups with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents.19–41 Benefitting from molecular design and device and morphology optimization, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ-OSCs with NF-SMAs have currently reached over 15% for binary component single junctions and 17% for tandem devices.1,42–46
Despite the great progress made in NF-SMA-based devices, the trade-off among the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and high fill factor (FF) is still a challenge which limits further improvement of the performance of these devices. In fact, modification of the central core with various electron-rich units tends to improve the Jsc by enhancing the ICT strength.47–55 However, this type of NF-SMA is often accompanied with decreasing LUMO energy levels and increasing HOMO energy levels, which causes a mismatch with popular donors and results in relatively low Voc and undesired PCE.56 Moreover, halogenation phenyl IC units can decrease the bandgaps of NF-SMAs and improve the morphology of blend films, resulting in high FF, high Jsc and PCE.57–66 However, dihalogenated phenyl IC-based NF-SMAs usually show downshifted LUMO levels, leading to decreased Voc in the corresponding devices. In contrast, adopting end groups of nonhalogenated aromatic heterocyclic units with medium electron-withdrawing properties is an alternative strategy to achieve decent Voc and better PCE due to the improved morphology in comparison with that of the corresponding phenyl-IC functionalized NF-SMAs.67–77 However, nonhalogenated aromatic heterocyclic-based ICs always result in inferior Jsc in comparison with that of dihalogenated IC functionalized NF-SMAs due to relatively weak ICT effects. Meanwhile, the overall performance of nonhalogenated aromatic heterocyclic IC-based NF-SMAs still lags behind that of halogenated NF-SMAs. To address the trade-off between Jsc, Voc and FF, it is necessary to design new high performance nonhalogenated aromatic heterocyclic IC-based NF-SMAs with enhanced ICT effects using appropriate electron-rich central units.
On the other hand, compared to thiophene-based molecules, selenophene-based molecules have stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects and improved charge carrier mobilities due to the much richer, larger, and more easily polarized electron clouds of selenophene and intermolecular Se–Se interactions. Replacing thiophenes in conjugated heterocycles with selenophenes may also enhance the planarity and rigidity of the π-conjugated backbones by interactions such as non-covalent interactions of Se and O, which is attributed to the larger propensity of Se atom than of S atom to adapt a pseudo-hypervalent state. Thus, replacing sulfur in conjugated heterocycles with selenium often results in materials with higher charge mobilities, improved exciton dissociations and decreased optical band gaps.8,78–83 Recently, single selenophene unit-containing one-dimensional conjugated central core-based A–D–A architecture NF-SMAs have attracted attention.53,58,84–88 For example, Liao et al. developed a selenophene-based A–D–A NF-SMA which showed the best PCE of 8.6% without any additives.84 Subsequently, prof. Geng's group and prof. Liu's group independently reported a family of NF-SMAs with a selenophene unit as a π bridge to extend the conjugation length; these exhibited high Jsc and a PCE of ca. 11% in binary OSCs.53,85 Recently, prof. Sun's group reported two asymmetric single selenophene-modified NF-SMAs with different backbone conjugation lengths which delivered high a PCE of 12.2% with a high FF of ca. 76%.86 Our group developed a pair of fused selenophene-incorporated NF-SMAs with a PCE of 13.3% to study the effects of introducing dichlorine atoms into the end groups.58 Despite the high potential of single selenophene-based NF-SMAs in OSCs, most of them show relatively medium PCEs, and their raw materials are expensive. Moreover, very few systematic investigations of the effects and advantages of replacing thiophene rings with selenophene rings on the linear one-dimensional conjugated backbones of similar NF-SMAs have been thoroughly carried out, especially from the standpoint of achieving highly efficient (>13%) NF-SMAs. Obviously, further systematic studies of both selenophene and thiophene-based nonhalogenated NF-SMAs are an ideal strategy to obtain direct and detailed evidence of their structure–performance correlations and thus further improve the PCEs of selenophene-based nonhalogenated NF-SMAs.
In this contribution, we synthesized a pair of A–D–A NF-SMAs with thiophene-fused IC as the terminal group, TTTIC and TSeTIC, which comprise fused-ring indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene (IDTSe) as their core units, respectively. Replacement of the outermost thiophene of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene with selenophene creates a larger and looser electronic cloud and stronger electron-rich features, which are beneficial to increase the intramolecular charge transfer ability when they are used in A–D–A structures. Indeed, compared with its indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based counterpart (TTTIC, also named ITCPTC70), TSeTIC exhibited redshifted and stronger absorption and higher electron mobility in neat thin films. Moreover, the introduction of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene in TSeTIC improves the molecular packing order and the half-molecular dipole moment relative to TTTIC. Additionally, the morphology of TTTIC or TSeTIC blended with the polymer donor PM6 and their photovoltaic performance are comprehensively compared. More balanced carrier mobilities and more favorable morphologies were achieved for TSeTIC:PM6 blend films in comparison with TTTIC:PM6 blend films, as shown by their AFM and TEM images and GIXD patterns. Eventually, the optimal PM6:TSeTIC-based device delivered a notable PCE of 13.71% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 19.42 mA cm−2, and an excellent FF of 75.9%, which is a ca. 13% enhancement of PCE compared to the optimal PM6:TTTIC-based device (12.05%). Moreover, the TSeTIC/PM6 device showed an energy loss (Eloss) of 0.60 eV, which is smaller than that of the TTTIC-based device (0.64 eV). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 13.71% is the best result among selenophene-based NF-SMAs in binary organic solar cells and is also the highest value of binary organic solar cells based on A–D–A structural NF-SMAs with thiophene-containing terminal groups. These results demonstrate that combination of the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene electron-rich core unit and thiophene-containing IC terminal group is a successful synergistic strategy to obtain high performance NF-SMAs with the best trade-off of Jsc, Voc and FF.

TTTIC was synthesized in our laboratory using a previously reported procedure.67,73Scheme 1 depicts the synthetic routes to the selenophene-containing core IDTSe and desired TSeTIC. Compound 1 was prepared in 91% yield by reacting selenopheno[3,2-b]thiophene-5-carboxylate81 with N-bromobutanimide in chloroform and acetic acid under reflux conditions. Compound 1 was hydrolyzed by LiOH in a THF/H2O mixture followed by acidification to obtain the corresponding acid 2. Then, 2 was decarboxylated with copper in quinoline to afford 2-bromoselenopheno[3,2-b]thiophene (3) in 84% yield. The Suzuki coupling reaction between diboronic ester 488 and monobromide 3 afforded the diester 5 with the selenopheno[3,2-b]thiophene unit in 65% yield. Then, 5 was reacted with (4-hexylphenyl)lithium by a nucleophilic addition reaction followed by acid-catalyzed Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization to achieve the central core IDTSe in 71% yield. Then, the dialdehyde IDTSe-CHO was prepared using the Vilsmeier reaction of the core IDTSe with DMF and POCl3. The final product TSeTIC was obtained by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between IDTSe-CHO and 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile67,73 with 90% isolated yield. All compounds were purified by flash column chromatography or recrystallization. Their chemical structures and the purities of the new compounds were verified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high resolution ESI-MS/MALDI-TOF-mass spectroscopy. The thermal stability of TSeTIC was studied using thermogravimetric experiments under N2, and the results are provided in Fig. S1a.†TSeTIC shows the decomposition temperature with 5% weight-loss at ca. 364 °C, which indicates that TSeTIC exhibited better thermal stability than TTTIC.70 Meanwhile, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S1b,† ESI†) was used to measure the solid phase transition properties. We found that TTTIC and TSeTIC showed weaker but quite different phase transitions in the heating process within the ranges of 220 °C to 240 °C for TTTIC and 254 °C to 267 °C for TSeTIC, respectively.89

The absorption data of TTTIC and TSeTIC in diluted chloroform solution and in thin films are shown in Table 1. As presented in Fig. S2,† the solution of TSeTIC exhibits a strong, broad absorption band between 550 and 800 nm with an absorption maximum at 710 nm, which redshifted ca. 20 nm compared with that of TTTIC. Furthermore, the extinction coefficient slightly increased for TSeTIC in comparison with that of TTTIC due to the enhanced intramolecular push–pull effect in TSeTIC. Moreover, TTTIC and TSeTIC in the thin films exhibited redshifted and broadened absorption spectra relative to the species in solution, with maximum absorption peaks of 717 nm and 733 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b). A greater redshift in the absorption spectrum of TSeTIC from solution to thin film was observed, suggesting that much stronger intermolecular interactions can occur in the TSeTIC thin film. These results can be ascribed to the more electron-rich IDTSe core and better molecular packing. The optical bandgap of the TSeTIC thin film is 1.53 eV by calculation from the absorption onset at 810 nm, which is obviously narrower than that of the TTTIC thin film (1.58 eV). Moreover, relative to TTTIC, the redshifted absorption spectrum of TSeTIC is a better match with the absorption range of the wide bandgap donor PM6 (see Fig. 1b). Thus, this delicate structural change in TSeTIC benefits the utilization of low-energy photons, which is desirable for increasing the Jsc of related devices.

As shown in Fig. S3,† cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves were carried out to estimate the energy levels of TTTIC and TSeTIC in the thin films. The corresponding LUMO and HOMO energy levels of TTTIC and TSeTIC in the thin films were calculated from the onset calibrated oxidation and reduction potentials versus the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of TTTIC and TSeTIC were −5.69 eV/−3.90 eV and −5.65 eV/–3.91 eV, respectively. Obviously, TSeTIC shows slightly higher HOMO and lower LUMO energy levels than TTTIC due to the stronger electron-donating properties of selenophene. Moreover, the HOMO energy offsets of our NFAs and donor PM6 provide enough driving force for exciton dissociation and transfer (Fig. 1c).
To investigate the planarity of the backbone and the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of TTTIC and TSeTIC, the geometries of these NFAs were determined by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level of theory. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the optimized molecular geometries of TTTIC and TSeTIC are in the “cis” conformation due to the possible existence of O⋯S and O⋯Se noncovalent interactions, respectively, which is consistent with previous results.53 The side-view of TSeTIC exhibits a less planar geometry, with a larger dihedral angle of 0.26° between the planar core unit and end-capping group in comparison with that of TTTIC (0.07°); this may be due to the slightly larger size of the outermost selenophene unit compared to the thiophene unit. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels by DFT were −5.51/−3.43 eV for TTTIC and −5.47/−3.43 eV for TSeTIC, which agree well with the trend of the CV results (Fig. 2a). Moreover, it is reported that large dipole moments of NFAs always result in enhanced strength of intramolecular interactions and decreased charge recombination processes in devices.66 Thus, we also calculated the half intramolecular dipole moments of TTTIC and TSeTIC using the DFT method due to their symmetrical structural features. As shown in Fig. 2b, the half intramolecular dipole moment of TSeTIC is 8.81 Debye, which is slightly higher than of TTTIC (8.67 Debye). The enhanced dipole moment may increase the intramolecular charge transfer strength in TSeTIC due to the outmost selenophene unit, which is consistent with the trend of the optical absorption results.

The performance of devices based on TTTIC and TSeTIC as electron acceptor components was evaluated in a conventional PSCs device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/acceptor:PM6/poly[(9,9-bis(3′((N,N-dimethyl) N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] dibromide (PNDIT-F3N–Br)/Al. The active layer was spin-casted from a mixture of chlorobenzene and DIO (99.5:0.5 v/v) solution with an optimized PM6/TTTIC or TSeTIC weight ratio of 1:1. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, the device based on TTTIC/PM6 exhibited a PCE of 10.51% with a Jsc of 17.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.95 V, and a FF of 0.634. Meanwhile, the TSeTIC/PM6-based device exhibited a slightly higher FF, a slightly lower Voc (0.94 V) and higher Jsc (18.25 mA cm−2) due to the deeper LUMO energy level and red-shifted absorption band of TSeTIC; thus, a higher PCE of 11.19% was achieved. As shown in Table 2, after thermal annealing for 5 min, the PCE of the TTTIC/PM6 blend was enhanced to 12.05%, with an improved Jsc of 18.29 mA cm−2, a higher FF of 70.1%, and a Voc of 0.94 V, which is comparable to reported results.57 Remarkably, for the TSeTIC/PM6 device with TA treatment, an outstanding PCE of 13.71% was achieved, which is ca. 23% higher than that obtained from the as-cast device. This higher PCE is accompanied by a significantly improved FF of 75.9% and an obviously enhanced Jsc of 19.42 mA cm−2. Moreover, the energy loss (Eloss) of the TSeTIC/PM6 device is 0.60 eV, which is slightly smaller than that of TTTIC (0.64 eV). It is worth noting that the PCE of 13.71% is the best result in selenophene-based A–D–A NF-SMAs for binary organic solar cells53,58,84–88 and also is the highest value of binary organic solar cells based on A–D–A structural NF-SMAs with thiophene-containing terminal groups (see Table S1†).35,39,57,63,66–78

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the as-cast and TA-treated devices are shown in Fig. 3b. All the EQE values were over 70% from the wavelength range of 500 to 750 nm. Compared with the as-cast blend films, TA treatment promoted larger EQE values from 350 to 800 nm with the maximum value of 78.7% at 618 nm for the TTTIC/PM6-based device and 78.9% at 640 nm for the TSeTIC/PM6-based device, indicating that the charge recombination is weak in both devices. Moreover, the EQE response of the TSeTIC/PM6-based device with TA treatment is obviously wider and slightly stronger than that of the TTTIC/PM6-based device with TA treatment, which can be attributed to the red-shifted absorption profiles of the TSeTIC/PM6 blend films. The corresponding integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are 18.13 mA cm−2 and 19.11 mA cm−2 for the TTTIC/PM6-based device and TSeTIC/PM6-based device with TA treatment, respectively, which match well with these obtained from the J–V curves (the errors are all within 2%).
To clarify the effects of the different core units on the charge-transport properties of the PSCs, the electron mobilities (μe) and hole mobilities (μh) of the neat TTTIC and TSeTIC films and the blend films based on TTTIC/PM6 and TSeTIC/PM6 were investigated through the space charge-limited current method (Fig. S5† and Table 2). The electron mobility of the neat TSeTIC film is 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of the neat TTTIC film (3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results indicate that the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene core in TSeTIC is beneficial to enhance the intermolecular interactions, resulting in higher mobility in comparison with that of the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based NF-SMA. Furthermore, the μh and μe of the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film after TA annealing are 5.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and both are obviously higher than those of the TTTIC/PM6 blend film (4.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film showed similar μh/μe to the TTTIC/PM6 blend film after thermal annealing. Thus, the highest charge carrier mobilities for the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film after annealing in the related blend films was beneficial to efficient charge transport and less charge recombination, thus contributing to its highest FF (ca. 0.76) and Jsc in the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 devices.
To understand the exciton/charge bimolecular or monomolecular recombination dynamics, the correlation between Jsc/Voc and the light intensity (P) was investigated to explore the reason for the obvious enhancement of the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 devices. The data were fitted to the power-law equation of Jsc ∝ Pα, where the factor α indicates the possibility of bimolecular recombination. As α approaches 1, the devices show weaker bimolecular recombination.90 As shown in Fig. S6,† the α values for the as-cast and TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 blends are 0.984 and 0.997, which are slightly increased in comparison with those of TTTIC/PM6 (0.975/0.992), respectively. These results indicate that the bimolecular recombination is obviously suppressed and the corresponding charge extraction is promoted in the TSeTIC/PM6-based device in comparison with the TTTIC/PM6-based device, resulting in a higher FF (ca. 76%) in the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 devices. We also investigated the trap-assisted monomolecular recombination by the correlation of Voc and light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot. As shown in Fig. 3c, slopes of 1.16 kBT/q and 1.26 kBT/q were observed for the devices of TSeTIC and TTTIC after thermal annealing, respectively. As we know, when the slope approaches kBT/q, these devices exhibit stronger bimolecular recombination and weaker trap-assisted monomolecular recombination.23 Thus, the IDTSe core-based NFA was beneficial for suppressing trap-assisted monomolecular recombination. In contrast, both devices based on TTTIC/PM6 or TSeTIC/PM6 before TA annealing gave higher slopes (1.38 kBT/q and 1.32 kBT/q). The decreased slopes in the TA-treated devices indicate that the trap-assisted monomolecular recombination is suppressed by the annealing treatment, leading to improved Jsc in the TA-treated devices in comparison with the as-cast devices. In addition, to gain further insight into the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes, the photocurrent densities (Jph) against the effective voltage (Veff) of these devices before and after thermal annealing were measured. When Veff arrived at a high voltage, the Jph value could reach saturation (Jsat), indicating that the charge was almost collected by the electrode. As shown in Fig. 3d, under short circuit conditions, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) of the TSeTIC/PM6-based device before and after annealing were calculated as 0.92 and 0.95, which are slightly higher than those of the TTTIC/PM6-based device before and after TA annealing (0.91 and 0.94), respectively. These results indicate that the device based on the NFA with an IDTSe core unit and TA annealing treatment possesses more efficient exciton separation and charge transport processes, which may contribute to the higher photocurrent and FF in the TSeTIC/PM6-based device.
To study the influence of the different core units on the molecular miscibility, detailed surface and bulk morphology characterizations of the TTTIC and TSeTIC-based blend films after thermal annealing were conducted using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4, all the blend films exhibited smooth and relatively uniform surfaces and relatively low root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses. The as-cast and TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 blend films showed slightly larger aggregations, with larger RMS roughnesses of 1.41/1.43 nm than the TTTIC/PM6 blend films (1.32/1.37 nm), respectively. The corresponding phase images also exhibit the improved fibrous structure and phase separation in the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film, particularly the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 blend film, which is attributed to the larger crystallization tendency of TSeTIC after TA treatment. Thus, the TA treatment may contribute to the reasonable nanoscale blending of the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film. Moreover, the TEM images of these blend films before thermal annealing showed weak phase-separated features; however, the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film showed a much more uniform and homogeneous morphology. After thermal annealing, better nanoscale fibril structures and well-distributed interpenetration networks were seen in these blend films, especially for the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film, which may favour charge separation and enhanced efficiency of OSCs (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the outmost selenophene functionalized core unit is beneficial for improved miscibility of NFAs with PM6; this results in improved FF and Jsc in the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film.

To better understand the effects of the outmost selenophene instead of thiophene in the core unit on the molecular packing behavior and crystallinity orientation in the TSeTIC/PM6 and TTTIC/PM6 blend films and corresponding neat films, the two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) technique was used. As shown in Fig. S7,† the neat donor polymer PM6 showed a pronounced (010) diffraction peak at 1.68 Å−1 (d = 3.74 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a sharp (100) diffraction peak at 0.31 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction with a lamellar spacing of 20.6 Å, suggesting the predominant face-on orientation of PM6. Although the TSeTIC and TTTIC films both exhibited a face-on orientation relative to the substrate as their predominate packing modes, the neat TSeTIC film exhibited stronger (100) lamellar packing at ca. 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction and a more prominent π–π stacking peak at ca. 1.68 Å−1 in comparison with that of the neat TTTIC film due to the greater crystallization tendency of IDTSe core-based NF-SMAs. The GIXD of the blend films and corresponding line-cuts in the IP/OOP directions for the TTTIC/PM6 and TSeTIC/PM6 blend films are presented in Fig. 6b. Both the as-cast TTTIC/PM6 and TSeTIC/PM6 blend films showed that the π–π stacking peaks were most concentrated at ca. 1.74 Å−1 in the OOP direction, and the lamellar diffraction peaks were at ca. 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction (Fig. 6a), corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of ca. 3.61 Å and the lamellar stacking distance of ca. 20.9 Å. However, the crystal coherence lengths of PM6/TSeTIC in the lamellar stacking and π–π stacking directions were calculated to be 103.4 Å and 16.8 Å, which are obviously larger than those of TTTIC/PM6 (69.2/14.5 Å), respectively; this indicates enhancement of the molecular stacking and crystallization in the TSeTIC/PM6 blend film. Moreover, for the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 and TTTIC/PM6 blend films, the π–π stacking (010) peaks were more concentrated in the OOP direction and the intensity of the lamellar diffraction peaks slightly increased in comparison with the corresponding as-cast blend films, indicating more efficient molecular stacking in the TA blend films. Moreover, compared to the as-cast blend films, the crystal coherence lengths of π–π stacking and lamellar stacking in the TSeTIC/PM6 and TTTIC/PM6 blend films increased slightly. For example, the coherence lengths in the π–π stacking direction of the TA-treated TTTIC/PM6 and TSeTIC/PM6 blend films increased to 16.3 Å and 18.6 Å, respectively, indicating that the face-on orientation and molecule packing order were improved and crystallization defects were decreased in the TA-treated blend films. These features are beneficial to obtain higher charge transport ability and weaker charge recombination in the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 device; thus, it achieved a higher FF and PCE.

Conclusions
In summary, we firstly synthesized a new moderate electron-rich central core, named indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene (IDTSe), which replaced the outermost thiophene of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene with selenophene. Then, we obtained a new non-halogenated A–D–A structural NF-SMA (TSeTIC) by a synergistic strategy using thiophene-fused IC as the terminal group and IDTSe as the core unit to enhance high performance organic solar cells. Compared to its indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based counterpart (TTTIC), the incorporation of the outermost selenophene ring in TSeTIC not only results in a narrow optical bandgap (1.54 eV) and up-shifted HOMO energy level, but also improves the molecular packing and charge mobility. Moreover, the TA-treated TSeTIC/PM6 blend film exhibited better phase separation with favorable molecular packing and miscibility for exciton dissociation, more balanced carrier mobility and weaker charge recombination for charge transportation than the TTTIC/PM6-based blend film. Consequently, the TA-treated PM6:TSeTIC-based device produced a higher FF of 75.9% and an impressive PCE of 13.71% with a lower Eloss (0.60 eV) than the best device based on PM6:TTTIC (12.05% with Eloss of 0.64 eV). More excitingly, the outstanding PCE of 13.71% is the highest value obtained for A–D–A structural NF-SMAs with thiophene-containing terminal groups for binary organic solar cells. Our systematical investigation provides an opportunity to overcome the limitation of the problematic trade-off between Jsc, Voc and FF and show the great potential of the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene core unit and thiophene-based IC as synergistic building blocks in achieving outstanding photovoltaic performance NF-SMAs with low Eloss and high FF.
