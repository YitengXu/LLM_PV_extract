    , Accepted 4th October 2019First published on 7th October 2019AbstractThree porphyrin dyes comprising 4-(10-ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline as an extended π-conjugated donor integrated with systematically varied acceptor groups, i.e., 2-cyano-3-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (LG19), 2-cyano-3-(5-(7-methylbenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl) thiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (LG20), and 2-cyano-3-(4-(7-methyl benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl) phenyl)acrylic acid (LG21), have been synthesized and implemented in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). All these sensitizers were characterized by various spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The absorption maxima of LG20 significantly red-shifted to 707 nm, when compared to those of the LG19 and LG21 sensitizers. Optical, electrochemical and theoretical studies suggest that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of LG20 and LG21 are very close to the TiO2 conduction band, when compared to that of LG19. The IPCE values of LG20 and LG21 were found to be 81% at 486 nm and 83% at 482 nm, respectively, and the onset wavelengths were shifted up to 900–980 nm. With favourable red shifted absorption of the LG20 sensitizer, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.0% has been observed for the fabricated DSSC, which was higher than those of the DSSCs fabricated from LG19 (PCE = 8.51%) and LG21 (PCE = 9.04%). Therefore, the effect of the extended π-conjugated donor, anchoring group, benzothiadiazole auxiliary acceptor and presence of dodecyloxy groups significantly contributed to enhancing the efficiency of the device using a liquid redox electrolyte. Finally, we have used intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy and nanosecond transient studies to explain the design and efficiency relationship of these sensitizers.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been at the centre of attention in the last couple of decades due to their extraordinary features, such as inexpensiveness, ease of fabrication, high power conversion efficiency and a great variety of dyes to choose from. Essentially, the search for very efficient sensitizing dyes has never stopped.1–8 For this reason, a great variety of sensitizers have been designed with Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, metal-free organic dyes and pigment-based dyes for high efficiency and stable DSSCs.9–16 In this regard, porphyrins and their derivatives are found to be alternative sensitizers not only because of their role in the photosynthetic process to convert sunlight into chemical energy, but also their ease of structural modification. Porphyrins show an intense Soret band at 400–450 nm and two/four less intense Q bands in 500–700 nm regions.17 With the intention of further enhancing the efficiency of porphyrin sensitizers, one has to broaden the absorption spectra for improving the current density (JSC) as well as to conceal the unfavourable charge recombination for achieving better open-circuit potential (VOC). For this reason, a great variety of porphyrin sensitizers have been designed for DSSC applications. For instance, Grätzelet al. have designed and developed a porphyrin containing β-pyrrole-linked malonic acid with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1%.18 But, when compared to Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes the PCE is low. Grätzel and several other groups have introduced various structural modifications at the meso position of the porphyrin macrocycle by adopting the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) approach and showed PCEs as high as 13% using the Co(II/III) redox couple.19–24 In general, the donor group is an organic molecule which shows absorption in the UV region, which is connected to the meso position of a porphyrin macrocycle either directly or through an ethynyl bridge, with porphyrin as a π-spacer and an anchoring group, either carboxylic acid or cyanoacrylic acid, through auxiliary acceptors like benzothiadiazole (BTD) etc. Porphyrins tend to aggregate on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 due to planarity. To reduce the aggregation of porphyrins, Grätzel et al. introduced octyloxy chains on the meso-phenyl position of the porphyrin.19 In addition, these alkyl chains enhance the solubility of the porphyrin macrocyle as well as minimize the unwanted recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with oxidized sensitizers. By this approach, Grätzel reported a landmark sensitizer SM315 with PCE of 13% using a Co(II/III) redox couple.19 Our group has also been involved in designing D–π–A approach-based porphyrin sensitizers for the past couple of years. We have introduced a butterfly shaped 3-ethynyl-10-octyl-10H phenothiazine donor through an ethynyl bridge to the meso position of a porphyrin with systematic variation of auxiliary acceptors and attained a PCE of 10.2% using the I−/I3− redox couple.25 Later, we replaced the donor phenothaizine with bulky phenanthroimidazole and unveiled a PCE of 7.45% and upon co-sensitization with an organic dye have reached a PCE of 8.27%.26 Very recently, we have introduced a non-planar triphenyl imidazole moiety as a donor to further minimize the aggregation of the porphyrin macrocycle. The sensitizer with a 4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzothiadiazole auxiliary acceptor and cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group (LG18) has reached a PCE of 10.51%.27
During the course of our intensive efforts towards the design and development of efficient porphyrin-based sensitizers for DSSC applications, we further realized that sensitizers having broad absorption and a push–pull (or donor–acceptor) structure may enhance the device efficiency. For this reason, we designed a donor with extended π-conjugation in which a triphenylamine group connected to an anthracene moiety through C–C coupling may lead to enhanced absorption in the UV and blue regions. Porphyrins with extended π-conjugated donors at their meso-phenyl position and auxiliary acceptors such as benzothiadizole instigate enhancement of molar extinction coefficient and bathochromic shift of the absorption. This approach avoids the co-sensitization concept and inspired researchers to develop a wide variety of porphyrin molecules. Thus, to promote the PCE of porphyrin sensitizer based DSSCs, the incorporation of the extended π-conjugated donor concept and increased alky chain length from octyloxy to dodecyloxy chains not only leads to bathochromic shift of the absorption but also enhances the solubility of the sensitizer. For example, Zhao et al. have reported dichromophoric porphyrin sensitizers which have double donors of either carbazole-triphenylamine chromospheres (yellow Y) or carbazole fused thiophene-thiophene chromospheres (orange O). But, the PCE of these sensitizers has shown ∼3.5% only.28 In another study, Wang et al. have introduced 10-enthynyl-N,N-diphenylanthracene as a donor and benzothiadiazole as an auxiliary acceptor, which resulted in DSSCs with PCE of 10.3% using a Co(II/III) redox couple.24 The absorption maxima of the sensitizer have shifted to the 700 nm region. In order to further enhance the efficiency of the device one has to push the absorption maxima of the porphyrin sensitizers further towards the red region of the absorption spectrum. On the other hand a few reports on triphenylamine tethered with anthracene-based sensitizers for DSSC applications were reported in the literature and their efficiency is not up to the mark.29,30
Here in the present manuscript, we have used the extended π-conjugated donor concept by using a commendable donating group i.e., 4-(10-ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline on one meso position of the porphyrin and other the meso position was incorporated with various auxiliary acceptors (Chart 1). In this design, high efficiencies of DSSCs are achieved by enlightening the VOC and short circuit current JSC. 4-(10-Ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline is a nonplanar extended π-conjugated donor with good electron donating properties, attached through an ethynyl bridge at the meso position of the porphyrin. The influence of the extended π-conjugated donor with an ethynyl bridge enhances the absorption of the sensitizer towards the red region. To evaluate the light harvesting ability of these sensitizers, we have integrated with 2-cyano-3-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (LG19), 2-cyano-3-(5-(7-methylbenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl) thiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (LG20), 2-cyano-3-(4-(7-methyl benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid (LG21).

Methods and instrumentation

1H NMR spectra were obtained either at 300 or 500 MHz using a Brucker Avance NMR spectrometer running X-WIN NMR software. The elemental analyses were done using an Elemental, Vario MICRO CUBE analyzer. A Shimadzu Biotech Axima Performance 2.9.3.20110624: Mode Reflectron-HiRes, Power: 85 was used to get MALDI-TOF spectra of the investigated compounds. A CH instruments model CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer was used to perform cyclic voltammetric measurements. The experiments were carried out using 1 mM sample solution in THF solvent at 100 mV s−1 scan rate using 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as supporting electrolyte. The spectroelectrochemical studies were also carried out using the same instrument at 25 °C. Pt gauge was the working electrode and Pt wire was the counter electrode. A SCE reference electrode separated from the bulk of the solution by a double bridge was used. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e instrument was used for the thermogravimetric measurements at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with 10 mg of sample.
Ground state geometry optimization of the structures of the sensitizers LG19–LG21 in the gas phase was carried out with DFT studies and the B3LYP method using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set by the Gaussian 09 software on a personal computer.33–35 TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) was employed for estimation of ground state to excited state transitions using B3LYP and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The geometries were used to obtain the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and were also subjected to single-point TDDFT studies to obtain the UV-Vis spectra of the sensitizers. The integral equation formalism polarisable continuum model (PCM) within the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) theory was used in the TDDFT calculations to describe the solvation of the dyes in tetrahedrofuran.36,37 The software GaussSum 2.2.5 was employed to simulate the major portions of the absorption spectra and to interpret the nature of transitions.38,39

The processes for the preparation of the TiO2 electrode and fabrication of the photovoltaic device were adopted from our previous procedures.25–27 Briefly, nanocrystalline TiO2 films of 8 μm thickness were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (sheet resistance 10 Ω per square and transmission >85%) by screen-printing with an active cell area of 0.25 cm2. Afterwards, an additional scattering layer made of anatase TiO2 particles of 5 μm thickness (∼400 nm in diameter) was screen printed on the active transparent layer to improve the device performance. These films were sintered at 500 °C for 1 h in the presence of oxygen. Dye solutions were prepared at the concentration of 0.2 mM in 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol. The TiO2 films were soaked in the dye solution and then kept at room temperature for 15 h to adsorb onto the TiO2 films. The photoelectrode was dipped into the dye solution while it was still hot, i.e. its temperature was ca. 80 °C to remove the moisture in the pores of TiO2. After complete adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface the photo electrode was removed from the solution, and the non-adsorbed dye was removed by washing with acetonitrile under a stream of dry air or argon. The dye-coated photoanode and counter electrode were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer at 100 °C. The redox electrolyte was introduced into the cell through a pre-drilled hole of the counter electrode, which was later closed by a cover glass to avoid the leakage of the electrolyte solution, which consisted of a mixture of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.1–0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. A black metal mask with an area of 0.25 cm2 under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan) was used to measure the current–voltage characteristics. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki).
Dyes LG19–LG21 were desorbed from the nanocrystalline TiO2 film by dipping the TiO2 film in a 0.1 M TBAOH solution of a 1:1 mixture of H2O and ethanol. The amount of dye uptake was estimated from the absorption peak of each resulting solution.
Transient absorption studies, CEM and IMVS measurements
The photovoltaic response induced by the modulated light was studied using intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). A potentiostat (Solartron1287) equipped with a frequency response analyser (Solartron1255B) at an open-circuit condition, based on monochromatic illumination (420 nm) controlled by a Lab view system was used to measure the IMVS. The modulated light was driven with a 10% AC perturbation current superimposed on a DC current in a frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz. The charge extraction method (CEM) was performed with the same monochromatic light source. The solar cell was illuminated at an open-circuit condition for 5 s to attain a steady state and then the light source was switched off when the device was simultaneously switched to a short-circuit condition to extract the charges generated at that light intensity.
Results and discussion
Synthesis

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of new porphyrin dyes LG19–LG21. Compound 1 was synthesized by reaction of Suzuki coupling between (4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)boronic acid, and 9,10-dibromoanthracene followed by reaction with TMSA in the presence of Pd(PPh3)Cl2 to get the compound 2. The porphyrin intermediate 3 was synthesized as per the methods reported in the literature.25–27 The sensitizers LG19, LG20, and LG21 were synthesized by deprotection of TIPS-acetylene 4 with the corresponding bromo aromatic acid by using AsPh3 and Pd2(dba)3 reagents. Finally the desired sensitizers were obtained by silica gel column chromatography purification. All these sensitizers were fully characterized by elemental analyses, various spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods including spectroelectrochemical studies. The elemental analyses of all four sensitizers are found to be satisfactory (see Experimental section). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of LG19 showed a peak at m/z = 1907.55 (C124H140N6O6SZn), LG20 at m/z = 2042.6 (C130H142N8O6S2Zn), and LG21 at m/z = 2036.05 (C132H144N8O6SZn), which was ascribable to their corresponding molecular ion peaks (Fig. S8, S10 and S12, ESI†). 1H NMR spectra of LG19–LG21 sensitizers are shown in Fig. S7, S9 and S11 (ESI†).

Optical properties
The solution (THF) processed absorption spectrum for the LG20 is depicted in Fig. 1 and their analogous absorption maxima (λmax) and logarithmic molar extinction coefficients (logε) are presented in Table 1. In all these sensitizers, the absorption peaks in the 300–450 nm region are due to the presence of the used extended π-conjugated donor i.e., triphenylamine and anthrancene and peaks appeared due to the Soret band at 476 nm and Q band at 686 nm. We discussed in our earlier reports that the absorption has lot of implementation by the incorporation of the 2,1,3-bezonthiadiazole (BTD) acceptor.25–27 The absorption spectrum featured by the LG19 is due to the 4-(10-ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline donor and 2-cyano-3-(5-ethynylthiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid. Here, in the case of LG20 and LG21, the intense absorption maxima are because 2-cyano-3-(5-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid and 2-cyano-3-(4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid were incorporated, which reveals significant intensive Soret bands at 486 nm, 484 nm, respectively. The expressive red shift in the lowest energy Q band is observed at 707 nm, and 694 nm, respectively (see Fig. S13, ESI†). In addition to that, the absorption valley between the Soret band and Q band is also enhanced in LG20 and LG21. Similar spectra changes are also observed in previously reported BTD linked porphyrin sensitizers.42–44 The BTD linked porphyrins show that the extended π-conjugation causes the symmetry loss, thereby broadening its absorption with enhanced ε values.25–27,40,41 All these strongly represent the electronic transition between the donor and π-spacer porphyrin macrocycle. Along with the experimental absorption spectrum, the spectrum generated by means of the TD-DFT calculations is also replicated (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the absorption properties were also studied by adsorbing LG19–LG21 sensitizers on the surface of the 6 μm thick TiO2 films (Fig. 2) and the absorption spectra are similar to that of the solution spectra but exhibit a small redshift with broadening. The THF processed emission measurements were performed for LG19–LG21 sensitizers at room temperature, which show strong emissions at 701 nm, 730 nm and 713 nm, respectively, and representative emission spectra are presented in Fig. 1. Due to the BTD auxiliary acceptor in LG20 and LG21, emission maxima were found to be more redshifted when compared to that of LG19. The consistent emission maxima and quantum yields are presented in Table 1. The quantum yields of all porphyrins were enriched in appraisal with the reference compound 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl zinc porphyrin (ZnTPP).44 No emission spectra were observed, when sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 and this may be due to electron transfer from the excited singlet state of the sensitizer to the conduction band of TiO2. The singlet excited state lifetimes were analysed in THF solvent (Fig. S16, ESI†), and they are found in the range of ∼1.24 ns (Fig. S16, ESI†), and all three were quenched when they were adsorbed on the TiO2. The singlet state energies (bandgap, E0–0), were estimated from excitation and emission spectra, which were in the range of 1.72–1.78 eV. In addition to the light-harvesting ability, to calculate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2, electrochemical properties of all newly investigated sensitizers were characterized by the cyclic voltammetry method (Fig. 3 and Fig. S17, ESI†) and the corresponding data are shown in Table 1. These properties are essential to evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) levels of the LG19–LG21 sensitizers.

Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies
The cyclicvoltammetric and differential pulse voltammetric experiments were carried out using 0.1 M TBAPF6 in THF solvent as supporting electrolyte with an internal reference of Fc/Fc+ at room temperature. The ground state oxidation potentials (EOX) of LG19–LG21 were quasi-reversible, with −5.73, −5.74 and −5.79 eV, respectively. The ionization potential (IP) (equivalent to ground state oxidation potential) values of LG19–LG21 anchored to TiO2 film were also measured using a photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-3E), and the results are summarized in Table 2 (Fig. S17–S20, ESI†). An expression EOX* = IP − E0–0 is used to evaluate excited state oxidation potential (EOX*) levels of LG19–LG21, which were estimated to be −3.85, −3.89, and −3.92 eV, respectively. Compared with LG19, the BTD incorporated dyes i.e., LG20 and LG21 displayed a decrease in the E0–0 energy gaps, resulting in a red shift of the absorption bands, and relatively positive EOX* levels. The excited state oxidation potentials for all dyes are more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−4.2 eV) providing the possibility of efficient electron injection.45 Apparently, the ground state oxidation potentials were more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (−5.2 eV), assuring efficient dye regeneration (Fig. 4).

Subsequently, spectroelectrochemical studies were performed on LG19–LG21 dyes to get an in depth insight into the electronic properties of the oxidized species of the porphyrin sensitizers. During the controlled potential oxidation of LG20 at +0.87 V vs. SCE (Fig. 5), the absorption of the Q band at 707 nm and Soret band at 482 nm decreases in intensity, but the formation of a new band at 434 nm with an increase in intensity is observed. In contrast, the spectral region corresponds to the donor 4-(10-ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline with increase in intensity. During this process, isosbestic points were observed at 446 nm, 547 nm, and 625 nm. These results clearly designate the oxidation of a single product and are found to be the characteristic changes of the porphyrin and the donor triphenylamine cation radical.46,47 Additionally, the generated porphyrin cation radical at +0.87 V did not fully recover to its neutral form when the applied potential changed to +0.15 V. This explains that due to the prolonged time-scale of the spectroelectrochemical study, LG20 got partially degraded. The recovered LG20 sensitizer after removal of the applied voltage in the spectroelectrochemical study shows the almost similar characteristic of porphyrin; this is likely due to some chemical changes in the substituent groups of the porphyrin macrocycle. From these results, it is anticipated that the LG20 sensitizer exhibits reasonably good oxidative stability during spectroelectrochemical studies. Similar type of spectral changes are also observed in other porphyrin sensitizers LG19 and LG21 (Fig. S21, ESI†).

Theoretical studies
To get qualitative in depth information on the structural, electronic, and optical properties of LG19–LG21 sensitizers, theoretical DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed with a functional basis set of the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Fig. S22 (ESI†) explains the ground state optimized structures of the LG19–LG21 sensitizers; from this we can determine the arrangement of donor and acceptor moieties with respect to the porphyrin plane. With respect to the donor, all the sensitizers are nonplanar and the aggregation was found to be reduced both in solvent as well as on the TiO2 surface. The incorporation of the BTD moieties as auxiliary acceptors not only extends the π-conjugation but also minimizes the aggregation of the sensitizer as it is not in the plane of the porphyrin macrocycle.
Moreover, Fig. S22 (ESI†) also suggests that the dodecyloxy groups in these dyes were wrapping the porphyrin macrocycle, which minimizes recombination of the oxidized sensitizer with electrons in the TiO2 conduction band in addition to improving the solubility. The frontier orbitals between the three compounds highlighted the effect of π-conjugated auxiliary acceptors in the investigation of the HOMO and LUMO positions in the electronic structures of LG19–LG21 (Fig. 6a). Among all the dyes, the HOMO levels are delocalized on the anthracene part of the 4-(10-ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline donor and porphyrin macrocycle, while the LUMO lies mainly on the auxiliary acceptors and anchoring groups, which would have a favourable effect to facilitate more intramolecular interactions between the donor and acceptor. While the HOMO−1 electron cloud exists only on the triphenylamine part of the donor, the LUMO+1 lies on the donor, and partially on the porphyrin ring and auxiliary groups. In the case of the HOMO−2 and LUMO+2, the electron clouds are present on the porphyrin macrocycle and acceptor groups, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that incorporating the BTD auxiliary acceptor units adjacent to the 2-cyano-3-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (LG20) and 2-cyano-3-phenylacrylic acid (LG21) is more advantageous to delocalize the LUMO of the sensitizer and promote the electron movement to the acceptor; thereby it facilities the enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency and photogenerated current. The HOMO–LUMO gaps were found to be in the order of LG19 > LG21 > LG20. All the HOMO, LUMO, HOMO–LUMO gap energies and ground state dipole moments in Debye units are depicted in Table 2. In the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps (Fig. 6b), for all sensitizers, the positive electrostatic pontential was at the donor and ethynyl bridge connected to the meso position of the porphyrin macrocycle, while the negative potential was concentrated at the auxiliary acceptor BTD group and anchoring cyanoacrylic acid group.

Furthermore, TD-DFT studies were carried out to understand the excited-state transitions with the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM) in tetrahydrofuran as a solvent with the M06-2X function using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. The obtained results were found to be in judicious agreement with the experimental results. Table S2 (ESI†) depicts the calculated vertical excitation energies for a singlet together with calculated oscillator strengths.
Photovoltaic studies
Photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs fabricated with LG19–LG21 were evaluated. Fig. 7a and b depict the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) and current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic graphs for the LG19–LG21-based DSSCs and the corresponding parameters are illustrated in Table 3. In the case of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1) there is a large gap between the Soret and the Q bands, but in the IPCE spectrum this feature is not apparent as the influence of light scattering by TiO2 nanoparticles raises the photocurrents for the weak absorption region. The absorption maxima of all the porphyrin dyes almost merged in all sensitizers with broad spectral responses. The IPCE is maximum for the LG21-based DSSC (83% at 486 nm) and those of LG19 and LG20 were observed as 80% at 466 nm and 81% at 482 nm, respectively. The onset wavelengths were extended up to 900–980 nm. Subsequently, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for LG19–LG21 were measured under standard global AM 1.5 G solar conditions (100 mW cm−2). Of all these fabricated DSSCs, LG20 showed the highest PCE (η = 10.00%) compared to LG19 (η = 8.51%) and LG21 (η = 9.04%). Even though LG21 exhibits high IPCE (83%), it exhibits less efficiency (9.04%) due to the suppressed JSC and VOC values (19.35 mA cm−2 and 0.67 V) than LG20 (21.50 mA cm−2 and 0.66 V), respectively. This low JSC value is due to the poorer light harvesting efficiency of LG21 than that of LG20 at wavelength range 750–900 nm. The low efficiency of LG19 (η = 8.51%) is due to the lack of BTD auxiliary acceptors in its molecular structure. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 7a that there is a dip in the IPCE spectrum of LG19 at 550 nm, when compared to those of LG20 and LG21 sensitizers. From the above results we can conclude that sensitizers with BTD linked heteroaromatic substituents with cyano acrylic acid groups show higher PCE. Hence, the photovoltaic performance is in the order of LG20 > LG21 > LG19. These results indicate that the efficient porphyrin sensitizer should have a highly effective donor with extended π-conjugation and auxiliary acceptors like benzothiadiazole (BTD) with an anchoring cyano acrylic acid group. It is known in the literature that the concentration of TBP in liquid redox electrolyte increases when there is a shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2 and thereby enhances VOC.25–27 Fig. S20 (ESI†) illustrates the IPCE of all three sensitizers using 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 M concentration of TBP and the corresponding data are presented in Table 3. As the concentration of TBP increases it shows a negative effect on IPCE in all three sensitizers. A similar effect was also observed in the J–V curves (Fig. S24, ESI†). As the concentration of TBP increases the VOC values are found to be increased, whereas the Jsc values are reduced in all three sensitizers (Table 3). In each case, the efficiency of the device is reproducible for instance as in the case of LG20 sensitizer using 0.1 TBP concentration (see Fig. S25 and Table S3, ESI†).

CEM and IMVS studies
The electron lifetime (τ) is strongly linked to the VOC of the DSSCs. To comprehend the distinctions of the VOC values for the DSSCs fabricated with LG19–LG21 dyes, the relative conduction band positions and electron lifetimes in the DSSC devices were examined. We measured the relative conduction band position of TiO2 by means of the charge extraction method (CEM). DSSCs sensitized with LG19, LG20 and LG21 dyes exhibit a similar linear increase in electron density as a function of VOC, indicating that DSSCs fabricated with these dyes ensure similar conduction band edge of TiO2 regardless of the types of the dye (Fig. 8a). To further investigate the reason for the differences between the VOC values of the respective DSSCs, we measured the τ of the DSSCs fabricated by LG19, LG20 and LG21 dyes. Fig. 8(b) shows the τ of the DSSCs as a function of VOC. It is clear that at a static VOC, the lifetime escalates as LG20 < LG21 < LG19, which is in accord with the order of increasing VOC observed in the DSSCs.

Kinetic study
Using transient absorption spectroscopy, the strength of the anchoring system of LG19–LG21 dyes (π*-orbitals) to overlap with the TiO2 surface (titanium 3d-orbitals) can be well investigated through the study of the charge transfer kinetics undergone between the dye and TiO2 surface. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis has become an ideal tool for investigating DSSC interfacial kinetics, considered to be one of the crucial steps for the DSSC performance.48–50 We have used the Edinburg LP920 system to investigate and corroborate the transient kinetics of dye regeneration by electrolyte, among all the dyes.
It should be noted here that we used a high enough laser intensity to record suitable transient absorbance signals. This should not cause any significant change in the decay rate as has been also observed by the Gratzel group.51 Instead of measuring the bleached ground state of the dye sensitizer for which we measured very poor signals, we measured transient optical signals (see Fig. 9) representing the concentration of oxidized dye sensitizer (positive ΔOD) (both have the same decay lifetime), following electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The absorption decays in the presence of electrolyte (Fig. 9) in acetonitrile show half-times (τ1/2) of 2.46, 1.05, and 2.50 μs, implying fast dye regeneration dynamics by the electrolyte redox systems of the above LG19–LG21 dyes. These measured decay lifetimes are within the order of rates mentioned by Booschloo et al. and thus prove efficient dye regeneration by electrolyte redox systems of the above porphyrin dyes.50 Usually, a fast dye regeneration implies a high current density collected at the photoanode. These three different dye regenerations do happen at almost the same time decays, τ1/2, within the error bars. Their little differences shown in their short currents collected are originated mostly from the overall total covered IPCE spectra (Fig. 7). LG20 covers a larger spectrum than LG19 and LG21. In addition, based on the energy-level diagram of LG19–LG21 porphyrins in Fig. 4, all the respective dyes present driving forces higher than 0.25 V relative to the redox potential of I−/I3− which is −0.35 V versus NHE. Daeneke et al. have established that quantitative dye regeneration (theoretical regeneration yield 99.9%) can be achieved with a driving force of 20–25 kJ mol−1 (ΔE ≈ 0.20–0.25 V).52 Thus, a much higher driving force (more than 0.25 V versus vacuum) would not necessarily make a difference since after 0.25 V the dye regeneration process is diffusion controlled. Thus, in light of this information, dye regeneration times recorded in the presence of electrolyte do corroborate with the driving forces and with measured respective Jsc values.

Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermal stability of the sensitizer is one of the key factors for the durability of the DSSC device. We have carried out thermogravimetric analyses of the present three porphyrin sensitizers (LG19–LG21). As reported, the tetraphenyl porphyrin and its metallo derivatives are stable up to 400 °C.53 The thermal behaviour of LG20 is exemplified in Fig. 10 and it is clear that the sensitizer is stable up to 150 °C. An initial weight loss up to 150 °C (∼15%) is due to the removal of cyanoacrylic acid groups. Similar thermal behaviour was also observed for the other two sensitizers (Fig. S26, ESI†).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed three new porphyrin sensitizers using the D–π–A approach in which an extended π-conjugated donor i.e., 4-(10-ethynylanthracen-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline is tethered to the meso position of a porphyrin macrocycle with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring or acceptor group. The incorporation of auxiliary acceptor groups alters the electronic properties of the porphyrin sensitizers. This results in redshift of both the Soret and Q bands with absorption onset extending up to 800 nm. Theoretical studies suggested that the HOMO spreads over the donor and porphyrin π-spacer, the LUMO spreads over the π-spacer, and the anchoring carboxylic acid groups are suitable for dye-sensitized solar cell applications. Finally, all new sensitizers were tested in DSSC using a liquid redox electrolyte. The sensitizer with the benzothiadiazole thiophene auxiliary acceptor (LG20) results in great device performance, i.e., IPCE of 81% at both 500 and 700 nm, open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.66 V, short-circuit current density JSC of 21.50 mA cm−2, fill factor of 0.70 and a power conversion efficiency of 10.00% under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The efficiency and molecular design of the sensitizers were explained using intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy and nanosecond transient spectoscopy. The thermal studies indicate that these dyes were stable up to 150 °C.
