    , Accepted 7th March 2020First published on 9th March 2020AbstractWe have grown Zn1−xCdxO (ZnCdO) thin films by molecular beam epitaxy on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates across the full composition range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The wurtzite phase is observed in the composition x ≤ 0.44 whereas the rocksalt phase is observed for x ≥ 0.58. Within the composition region of 0.44 < x < 0.58, both wurtzite and rocksalt phases co-exist. At the phase transition to RS at x ∼ 0.55, the optical gap increases drastically to >3.0 eV. A large optical gap of 3.0 eV (an intrinsic gap of ∼2.7 eV) is achieved for RS-ZnCdO alloys at x ∼ 0.6. The stability of the RS phase with a low Cd content can be attributed to the low temperature MBE process. The upward shift of the band gap energy is observed in the mixed phase region due to the phase transition, and the largest band gap energy is obtained as 3.27 eV in the WZ (x = 0) and 3.0 eV in RS (x = 0.6) phase. RS-ZnCdO thin films exhibit a low resistivity of 5 × 10−4 Ω cm with a maximum mobility of ∼90 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a high carrier concentration of 4 × 1020 cm−3.
1. Introduction
Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are one of the key components of a solar cell and collect charge carriers from the illuminated side of the cell. In order to increase the conversion efficiency of solar cells, it is required to utilize a wide range of photons in the solar spectrum, and therefore, design and material issues on full spectrum solar cells including multi-junction solar cells (MJSCs),1–3 intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs),4–6 and so on have been extensively investigated. At present, a very high efficiency of >40% has been already achieved in MJSCs based on III–V semiconductors on a Ge bottom cell.3 However, in those MJSCs, a TCO layer has not been used because of a lack of TCOs with a high transmittance in a wide spectral region from ultra-violet to infrared (IR) (∼ from 300 to 1600 nm). The transmittance of widely used TCOs such as In2O3:Sn (ITO),7 In2O3:Ga (IGO), and ZnO:Al (AZO)8 have limited transmittance in the IR region (>1000 nm) because of their high electron concentration (>1021 cm−3) and low mobility (<40 cm2 V−1 s−1) which give rise to strong free carrier absorption (FCA) and plasma reflection.9–11 Hence TCO materials with a high transmittance extending into the IR region (>1500 nm)12 are essential for full solar spectrum photovoltaics.
Among the various TCO materials, CdO has the highest reported mobility value of 200 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an electron concentration of >1021 cm−3,13 and thus has been considered as a promising candidate for full spectrum solar cell applications.9,14–18 Because of its high mobility, CdO is expected to realize a low resistive thin film with a low carrier concentration which can extend the FCA and plasma reflection effects to a much longer wavelength region (λ > 2000 nm). Hence it can be used as transparent conductors on devices in which transparency in the long wavelength infrared region is required.9,14 Although the band gap (2.3 eV) of CdO is small for a transparent conductor application, it can be increased by alloying with a larger gap oxide such as ZnO which has a band gap of ∼3.3 eV. However, because ZnO has a wurtzite (WZ) structure (α = 3.25 Å, c = 5.21 Å) whereas CdO a rocksalt (RS) structure (α = 4.70 Å), the crystal structure of Zn1−xCdxO (ZnCdO) is expected to change at a certain Cd composition.
So far, there are several reports on the synthesis of ZnCdO.14,19–21 Detert et al. deposited ZnCdO films on soda lime glass substrates using a pulsed filtered cathodic arc deposition method and reported that the phase transition occurred at x ∼ 0.7 and the largest band gap of RS-ZnCdO with x ∼ 0.7 is 2.8 eV.14 On the other hand, the band gap of WZ-ZnCdO decreased with increasing Cd down to a value of ∼1.7 eV at the phase transition point of x ∼ 0.7. Using an non-equilibrium growth technique such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),22 which can grow high-quality thin films at low temperature, the RS to WZ phase transition may be extended to a lower Cd composition, leading to a further increase of the band energy. Here, we report the growth of ZnCdO thin films with a wide range of Cd compositions on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates by MBE. The phase transition and corresponding optical and electrical properties of ZnCdO thin films are investigated in detail.
2. Experimental
ZnCdO thin films were grown on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates using a conventional MBE system with a radio frequency (RF) radical cell. The background pressure of the growth chamber is less than 6 × 10−8 Pa. Zn (7N) and Cd (6N) were used as source materials. The α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in organic solvents. The flow rate of oxygen was kept constant at 0.3 sccm, and the RF power was set to 300 W. After introducing α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates into the growth chamber, firstly, the substrate temperature was changed from 100 to 250 °C with the Cd flux ratio fCd (= [Cd]/([Zn] + [Cd])) = 0.90 to find out the suitable growth temperature for ZnCdO thin films. After optimizing the growth temperature, the Cd flux ratio fCd was varied between 0.85 and 1 to grow the full range of Cd compositions at a 250 °C substrate temperature.
During the growth, a reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) pattern was recorded to monitor the film structure. After the growth, the film thickness was measured using a surface step profiler. The composition of ZnCdO was measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) using a 3.04 MeV He++ beam. The crystal structures of the films were examined by conventional θ–2θ X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Cu Kα radiation. The transmittance and reflectance were measured using a double-beam spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200∼2000 nm. The band gap energy of the films was determined by a square plot of the absorption coefficient (α) obtained from the transmittance and reflectance. The electrical properties were measured by Hall effect measurement using the Van Der Pauw configuration with In as an ohmic contact at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effects of substrate temperature

Fig. 1 shows the photographs of Zn1−xCxdO thin films grown with fCd = 0.9 in the temperature range of 100∼250 °C. Relatively thick black films with thicknesses over 1 μm were obtained when the substrate temperature was lower than 200 °C. However, at a substrate temperature of 250 °C, a yellowish thin film with about 60 nm thickness was obtained. This result suggests that at a growth temperature lower than 250 °C, the substrate does not provide sufficient thermal energy for the metal atoms to react with O.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of ZnCdO thin films grown on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates at different substrate temperatures. When grown with a substrate temperature lower than 200 °C, broad diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Cd at 32°, 34.8° and 38.2° with low intensity are observed, indicating the presence of unreacted Cd and that these films are amorphous or nanocrystalline. With increasing substrate temperature, the intensity of the diffraction peak between 33 and 34° increased. This peak is located in between the diffraction peaks from RS-CdO (111) and WZ-ZnO (0002), and can be assigned as WZ-ZnCdO (0002) as discussed later. A strong ZnCdO peak is detected from the film grown at 250 °C, indicating that with a high substrate temperature of 250 °C, ZnCdO films with good crystallinity are obtained. The effects of the substrate temperature on the crystallinity have also been reported for sputtered ZnCdO films23 and the reported results are consistent with our present work by MBE growth. The average grain size of the film grown at 250 °C can be estimated to be ∼16 nm from the width of the diffraction peak. Note also that as the substrate temperature increases, the WZ-ZnCdO peak shifted gradually to a higher angle. Since the ionic radius of Cd2+ (109 pm) is significantly larger than that of Zn2+ (88 pm), this suggest that less Cd is incorporated in the alloy at a higher growth temperature. These results suggest that with our MBE growth conditions, in order to grow crystalline ZnCdO thin films, they were grown at 250 °C at different Cd flux ratios to investigate the effect of Cd flux ratio on the properties of ZnCdO films.

3.2 Effects of Cd flux ratio on the properties of ZnCdO films

Fig. 3 shows the Cd content determined by EDX analyses in ZnCdO thin films on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates at different Cd flux ratios. The Cd content in the film is below the detection limit of EDX (<1%), and we consider that the film is pure ZnO with x = 0. As the fCd increases, the Cd content x in Zn1−xCxdO thin films increases gradually up to 1. Thus, ZnCdO films with different compositions can be grown by controlling the Cd ratio.
 Fig. 3  Cd content x in ZnCdO thin films grown on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates at various Cd flux ratios as measured by EDX. 

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of ZnCdO films grown at 250 °C with the different Cd contents x. All the films are polycrystalline with a thickness of around 60 nm. In the ZnO film with x = 0 grown at fCd = 0.85, only the peak at 34.4° corresponding to WZ-ZnO (0002) diffraction is observed. With increasing Cd content, this diffraction peak shifted to a lower angle suggesting a larger lattice parameter. This is consistent with the incorporation of more Cd with a larger ionic radius in the Zn sublattice in WZ-ZnCdO.24 On the other hand, at the Cd content x = 1, only the RS-CdO (111) diffraction peak at 33° is observed. With decreasing Cd content from 1 to 0.75, this RS (111) diffraction peak shifts toward a higher 2θ due to the replacement of Cd by Zn. In ZnCdO films deposited on soda-lime glass substrates, a RS-ZnCdO (200) peak was also observed at around 38∼39° (ref. 14 and 24) although it was not detected clearly in this study. Since α-Al2O3 (0001) was used as a substrate in this study, RS-ZnCdO is expected to have a (111) preferred orientation. Note that for samples with Cd contents x = 0.51 and 0.62, the diffraction peak becomes very weak and broad. It has been reported previously that the composition region where both RS and WZ phases co-exist depends on the growth method and lies in the range of x ∼ 0.4 to 0.7.14,24,32 Therefore, the broad weak diffraction for ZnCdO films with 0.51 < x < 0.62 may correspond to samples with a mixed phase of WZ and RS. At the Cd content x = 0.51, mixed peaks from RS-ZnCdO (x = 0.61) and WZ-ZnCdO (x = 0.06) are observed by 2 peak fitting as red-dashed lines. This will be discussed later.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of ZnCdO thin films grown on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates at various Cd flux ratios. 
In order to investigate the optical properties of ZnCdO thin films, the transmittance and reflectance spectra of ZnCdO thin films were measured using a double-beam spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200∼2000 nm, and the absorption coefficients were calculated using the Beer–Lambert law. The absorption spectra for x ≤ 0.5 and x ≥ 0.58 are plotted separately in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively.
 Fig. 5  Optical absorption spectra of ZnCdO with (a) x ≤ 0.5 and (b) x ≥ 0.58. 
In Fig. 5(a), the absorption edge energy gradually decreased from 3.27 to 2.35 eV with the increase of Cd content x from 0 to 0.44, corresponding to the change of the band gap energy in the WZ-phase. With a further increase in the Cd content to x = 0.50, however, the absorption edge energy shows a drastic increase to ∼3.0 eV. This can be attributed to a phase transition from the low gap WZ phase to a high gap RS phase.14 However, because the increase of the absorption coefficient near the absorption edge is not very steep as compared to other RS samples, we suppose that this sample has a mixed phase. On the other hand, ZnCdO with x ≥ 0.58 shows a steep increase of absorption coefficients above the absorption edge energy, and the absorption edge energy gradually decreases again with increasing Cd content. Therefore, this region is considered as a pure RS phase region.
The results of the Hall effect measurement are shown in Fig. 6. All the ZnCdO films showed n-type conductivity. The resistivity decreased gradually with increasing Cd content x from 0 to 0.58, then it becomes saturated at a very low resistivity of around 5 × 10−4 Ω cm in the RS phase. The electron concentration is in the range between 4 × 1019 cm−3 and 1 × 1020 cm−3 in the RS phase. The mobility of WZ-ZnCdO was very low and less than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, for RS phase alloys, the mobility increased to ∼90 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such a high mobility is consistent with other reports for RS-ZnCdO.14
 Fig. 6  Resistivity, electron concentration and mobility of ZnCdO thin films on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates measured by Hall effect measurement. 
The optical band gap of the films was determined by applying the Tauc model25 or the Davis–Mott model26 in the high absorbance region: αhν = D(hν − Eg)n(1)where D is a constant and n is the power index for direct-allowed transition as n = 1/2 was found to be more suitable for ZnCdO, giving the best linear approximation of the band-edge.27 Consequently, n = 1/2 is employed for fitting of experimental data, and the obtained optical band gaps are presented in Fig. 7 as a function of Cd content x by black circles with error-bars.

When the Cd content x is zero, an optical band gap energy of 3.27 eV was obtained, which agrees well with the reported band gap energy of WZ-ZnO.14 The optical band gap energy decreases gradually with increasing Cd content x in the WZ region. When the Cd content exceeds around 0.5, the optical band gap energy rapidly increased as mentioned above. In the RS region, the optical band gap energy decreases again with the increase of Cd content.
According to the theoretical calculation,28–31 it is reported that WZ-ZnO (WZ-CdO) has a higher direct band gap than RS-ZnO (RS-CdO) because, in the WZ structure, the valence band maxima (VBM) are pushed up due to p–d repulsion resulting from the hybridization of the O 2p state and metal d state, reducing the fundamental direct gap. In the RS structure, the respective states do not hybridize and the p–d repulsion and the corresponding gap shrinkage do not occur at the zone center (Γ) because of its symmetry forbiddance. This is the main reason for the rapid increase of the optical band gap energy by the phase transition from WZ to RS. However, it is also reported that, in the RS structure, in other regions of the Brillouin-zone, the bands are subject to the p–d repulsion and thereby increased at points away from Γ, leading the material to the indirect gap semiconductor. In our optical absorption spectra for RS-ZnCdO, the indirect absorption was not clearly observed, probably due to very weak absorption for the indirect transition.
It should be noted that the higher optical band gap energies are observed for RS-ZnCdO alloys (∼3.0 eV for x ∼ 0.6) as compared to other reports,9,14,24 which is consistent with the phase transition composition with a lower x than other reports. The stability of the RS phase at such a low Cd content may be attributed to the non-equilibrium MBE growth at a relatively low temperature of 250 °C. Also, in the mixed phase sample of ZnCdO with x ∼ 0.5, the optical band gap is determined by the RS-ZnCdO phase with a smaller band gap energy. Therefore, the obtained band gap is close to those for RS-ZnCdO with x ∼ 0.6.
The obtained optical band gap energies for the RS phase alloys are larger than the reported intrinsic energies,9,14,32–35 as shown by blue and green dashed lines in Fig. 7. This arises from free carrier effects in these alloys, namely the Burstein–Moss shift, and band renormalization, since the electron concentration is higher than 1020 cm−3 for the RS-ZnCdO alloys.
The intrinsic band gaps of ZnCdO were calculated for all thin films by considering free carrier effects using similar procedures as reported in ref. 12 and 14, and are shown by red circles with error-bars in Fig. 7. The intrinsic band gap of ZnCdO thin films on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates by MBE agrees well with previous reports.14,16

Fig. 8 compares the transmittance spectra of RS-ZnCdO and AZO thin films with a similar carrier concentration. It can be seen that RS-ZnCdO thin films has a higher transmittance around 80∼95% in the wavelength region from 500 nm to 2000 nm as compared to AZO. In particular, the IR transmission of RS-ZnCdO is much higher than that of AZO. This is because of the lower electron effective mass, higher static dielectric constant and higher high frequency permittivity of RS-ZnCdO, which can be expected from RS-CdO ( = 0.21m0,36ε = 21.9, ε∞ = 5.3 (ref. 37)) than WZ-ZnO ( = 0.29m0,38ε = 8.75, ε∞ = 3.75 (ref. 39)), leading to the decrease of FCA by a higher mobility and a longer plasma wavelength.9
 Fig. 8  Typical transmittance spectra of RS-ZnCdO and AZO thin films with a similar electron concentration. 
Also, RS-ZnCdO in this study shows around a 20% higher transmittance overall than the reported transmittance of RS-ZnCdO.40 However, due to the lower intrinsic gap of ∼2.5 eV, the transmittance in the UV region is limited to <400 nm as compared with that of AZO and further improvement is required. For example, for RS-ZnCdO with x ∼ 0.6, the intrinsic gap is ∼2.7 eV and with extrinsic doping to a high electron concentration of 1021 cm−3, its absorption edge can be increased to >3.5 eV (or <350 nm). Also, the RS phase may be extended to a smaller Cd region by growing on a cubic substrate, widely used for MJSCs, instead of hexagonal α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates. The desirable properties of larger band gap energy, low resistivity, high mobility and high transmittance in a wide spectral range make the RS-ZnCdO thin films promising candidates as TCOs for devices requiring a high conductivity and a wide transparency window, such as MJSCs.
4. Conclusion
ZnCdO thin films were grown on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy with various Cd contents. The phase transition from wurtzite to rocksalt is found to take place at the Cd content x ∼ 0.5 to 0.6. Within the composition region of x ∼ 0.5 to 0.6, both RS and WZ crystals co-exist. A transmittance above 80∼95% in the visible range is observed for both WZ and RS alloys. The optical gap of the WZ alloys decreases from 3.27 eV for ZnO to ∼2.35 eV (x ∼ 0.44). At the phase transition to RS at x ∼ 0.55, the optical gap increases drastically to >3.0 eV and a large optical gap of 3.0 eV (an intrinsic gap of ∼2.7 eV) is achieved for RS-alloys at x ∼ 0.6. RS-ZnCdO thin films exhibit a low resistivity of 5 × 10−4 Ω cm with a maximum mobility of ∼90 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a high carrier concentration 4 × 1020 cm−3. These properties make RS-ZnCdO potentially useful TCO materials for full spectrum solar cells.
