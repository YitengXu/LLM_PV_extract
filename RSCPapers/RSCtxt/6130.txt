, Accepted 1st June 2016First published on 8th June 2016AbstractThe incorporation of Co(OAc)2 into ascorbic acid-coated TiO2 nanoparticles easily provided a new heterogeneous visible-light active titania-based photocatalyst (TiO2/AA/Co) which was characterized by different techniques such as FT-IR, XPS, ICP-AES, TGA and TEM. A red-shift of the band-edge and a significant reduction of the band-gap (2.8 eV) were demonstrated by UV-DRS. The as-prepared TiO2/AA/Co nanoparticles possess excellent photocatalytic properties under visible light for the aerobic benzylic C–H oxidation of a structurally diverse set of benzylic alcohols and benzylic hydrocarbons in ethyl acetate as a safe solvent. The spectral results and leaching experiments revealed that the structural integrity of the solid catalyst is well preserved after being reused many times.
1. Introduction
In recent years, much attention has been devoted to different kinds of photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting,1–3 CO2 reduction to “solar fuels”,4 and organic syntheses that use photocatalytic and photochemical reactions for “valorization” of petroleum feedstocks and biomass.5 In this regard, among various photocatalytic materials, most studies have been focused on TiO2, because of its strong oxidizing power, high chemical inertness, high catalytic activity, long-term stability, low solubility in water, low toxicity, and low cost.6 However, recombination of photogenerated electron/hole pairs and the inability to respond to visible light, restrict its use only to the narrow range of UV light (<5% of total sunlight).7 To overcome this limitations, traditional easily realizable methods such as nanosizing,8–10 metal-ion and anion doping,11–13 noble metal loading,14–16 and dye sensitization,17,18 have been developed. Further developments in this line are self-assembly,19,20 biotemplating21,22 and surfactant templating.23 The sensitization by surface adsorbates (including biomolecules) that do not absorb visible light by themselves, is a less investigated method for visible light activation of wide band gap semiconductors.24,25 For example, titanium dioxide nanoparticles modified with folic acid26,27 may be selectively accumulated at the surface of human cancer cells as a result of binding by folate receptors, often over expressed at the surface of this type of cells.28 The photosensitization and surface modification of TiO2 films with L (+)-ascorbic acid (AA) shifts the onset of the photoresponse of TiO2 up to 600 nm.29,30
The urgent need for more sustainable chemical processes has prompted the development of mild and selective oxidation methods based on the use of green reagents and solvents. In this context, the direct use of oxygen as an oxidizing reagent is a very desirable feature for modern synthetic methods.31–34
Transition metal-based systems have been successfully used for the aerobic C–H oxidation to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. In this regard, several challenges exist, as the need of low pressures of O2 especially in flammable organic solvents, mild reaction conditions, low catalyst loadings, and avoidance of costly or toxic additives. Another main issue is the functional group tolerance and the chemoselectivity for the desired transformation when other groups susceptible to oxidation are present.35 As far as heterogeneous catalyst is concerned, only a few limited reports on Co-based C–H oxidation, mostly involving Schiff base complexes, have been presented by different research groups,36,37 including us.38,39
In this work, a novel heterogeneous titania-based photocatalyst has been prepared by simple incorporating of Co(OAc)2 to ascorbic acid-coated TiO2 nanoparticles (Scheme 1). Its visible-light photocatalytic activity promoted significantly benzylic C–H oxidation of alcohols and hydrocarbons in ethyl acetate as a safe solvent through a synergistic effect of titania with Co ascorbic acid complex (Scheme 2). The UV-vis and FT-IR spectra along with ICP analysis confirmed that TiO2/AA/Co catalyst maintain its structural integrity under the photocatalytic oxidation conditions.

2. Experimental
2.1. General remarks
All chemicals were purchased from Merck or Fluka. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed on a Bruker D8-advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54178 Å) radiation. FTIR spectra were recorded on a NICOLET spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of powders was performed in air by Shimadzu 50. TEM images were obtained with a 906 E instrument (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Samples for TEM experiment were prepared by dispersion in ethanol, sonicating for 30 min, and evaporating one drop of the solution onto a 200 mesh formbar-coated copper grid. XP spectra were recorded using a BESTEC GMBH (10−10 mw) with Al anode. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded using an Avantes spectrometer (Avaspec-2048-TEC model). Progress of each reactions was monitored by TLC using silica-gel SIL G/UV 254 plates and also by GC on a Shimadzu GC-16A instrument using a 25 m CBP1-M25 (0.32 mm ID, 0.5 μm coating) capillary column. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance DPX 250 and 400 MHz instruments.
2.2. Fabrication of TiO2 nanoparticles
To a solution of TiCl3 (0.05 mol) in a mixture of double-distilled water and absolute ethanol (1:1) was added citric acid (0.15 mol) and ethylene glycol (0.15 mol) subsequently. The resulting mixture was dissolved at 45 °C under ultrasound for 15 min to give a clear violet solution. The solution was refluxed at 120 °C for 8 h which turned into a metal–citrate homogeneous complex with a little color change from clear violet to black-violet. After cooling down, in order to bring about the required chemical reactions for the development of polymerization and evaporation of the solvent, the sol was further slowly heated at 90 °C for 6 h in an open bath until a beige wet gel was obtained. During continuous heating at this temperature, the polymerization between citric acid, ethylene glycol and complexes is developed and ultimately sol became more viscous as a wet gel. In the final step of sol–gel process, the wet gel was fully dried by direct heating on the hot plate at 150 °C for 6 h leading to a black powder. Then the calcination was done at 600 °C for 3 h with heating rate 5 °C min−1. Finally, TiO2 nanoparticles with a white color were obtained.40
2.3. Preparation of TiO2/AA nanohybrid
To 1.0 g TiO2 particles was gradually added 10.0 mL of 0.01 M ascorbic acid in water over a period of 20 min at room temperature under ultrasonic agitation. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. Afterwards, the product was centrifuged and washed by distilled water. Finally, TiO2/AA nanohybrid was obtained after drying for 4 h at 100 °C.
2.4. Preparation of TiO2/AA/Co nanohybrid
To 0.2 g of TiO2/AA nanohybrid was gradually added 1.0 mmol Co(OAc)2 dissolved in ethanol over a period of 20 min at room temperature under ultrasonic agitation. Then, the as-obtained mixture was refluxed for 12 h. Afterwards, the product was centrifuged and washed by ethanol. Finally, TiO2/AA/Co nanohybrid was obtained after drying for 12 h at 100 °C.
2.5. General procedure for aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols
To a mixture of benzyl alcohols (1 mmol) and TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst (0.06 mol%, 0.003 g) in ethyl acetate (1 mL) was added NHPI (N-hydroxyphthalimide) (15 mol%, 0.024 g) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C under air, ultrasonic agitation and visible light for the required time. The reaction progress was monitored by GC, and the yields of the products were determined by GC and NMR analysis.
2.6. General procedure for aerobic oxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons
To a mixture of benzylic hydrocarbons (1 mmol) and TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst (0.12 mol%, 0.006 g) in ethyl acetate (1 mL) was added NHPI (10 mol%, 0.016 g) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C under air, ultrasonic agitation and visible light for the required time. The reaction progress was monitored by GC, and the yields of the products were determined by GC and NMR analysis.
2.7. Reusability of catalyst
To a mixture of 1-phenylethanol (1 mmol) and TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst (0.06 mol%, 0.003 g) in ethyl acetate (1 mL) was added NHPI (15 mol%, 0.024 g) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C under air, ultrasonic agitation and visible light for 25 min. After completion of the reaction, TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst was separated by centrifuging followed by decantation (3 × 5 mL ethanol). The isolated solid phase (TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst) was dried under reduced pressure and reused for next runs. Catalyst recovery was also investigated in the aerobic oxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons in ethyl acetate according to the above mentioned procedure.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of catalyst
At the first step of this investigation, TiO2 nanoparticles of approximately 18–20 nm diameters were prepared by the PC sol–gel method.40 The particles were subsequently coated with ascorbic acid layer followed by complexation with easily available Co(OAc)2 to yield the corresponding supported nanocatalyst (Scheme 1) containing 1.3 wt% Co according to ICP-AES analysis. Therefore, each gram of heterogeneous catalyst contains 0.22 mmol Co or Co ascorbic acid complex.
The XRD pattern of TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited two different phases of TiO2 including anatase (tetragonal, a = b = 3.782 Å, c = 9.502 Å) and rutile (tetragonal, a = b = 4.584 Å, c = 2.953 Å).41,42
Fig. 1a shows the FTIR spectrum of TiO2 nanoparticles. The presence of major bands at 450–775 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of Ti–O groups. Broad peaks at 3400 and 1638 cm−1, correspond to the surface adsorbed water and hydroxyl groups.43,44 Fig. 1b confirms the successful fabrication of TiO2/AA composite. Vicinal hydroxyl groups of furan ring of AA act as bidentate ligand forming a chelate-type coordination bond with Ti atoms.45 C–O stretching vibration of Ti–O–C is appeared in the range of 927 and 1010 cm−1.46 The strong peak at 1320 cm−1 assigned to the O–H enediol of free acid disappeared in the spectra of the complex indicating the coordination of the OC3 and OC2 atoms to the Ti centers.47

Fig. 1c demonstrates significant spectral changes in the FT-IR spectra of TiO2/AA/Co compared with those of TiO2 and TiO2/AA (Fig. 1a and b). The appearance of a weak band at 665 cm−1 rationalized to stretching vibrations of the Co–O bond confirming the complexation of Co with AA coated TiO2. Major bands at 500–750 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of Ti–O groups (Fig. 1c).
XPS was applied to detect elements containing nanocomposite and their oxidation states. The binding energies of the particles were calibrated by taking the C 1s peak as reference (285 eV). The respective peaks for Ti 2p and Co 2p and O 1s confirms the presence of these elements in the nanocatalyst (Fig. 2a). The high resolution narrow-scan XPS spectra of Ti 2p and Co 2p and O 1s peaks of the sample are shown in Fig. 2b–d, respectively. Two signals positioned at 458 and 464 eV represent the Ti 2P3/2 and Ti 2P1/2. Also the peak of Co 2P3/2 located at ∼782.89 eV and that of Co 2P1/2 at ∼799 eV, confirms that Cobalt is present mainly as Co(II).48–50 The binding energy at 531 eV is attributed to the contribution of oxygen (O 1s).48–51

3.2. Catalytic activity
Catalytic experiments were initiated with the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol (1 mmol) under air in the presence of NHPI, knowing that the catalyst-free condition has not ability to trigger the reaction under any conditions. Different factors were screened to find the optimum reaction conditions, with respect to the conversion and selectivity of the 1-phenylethanol oxidation.
A systematic examination of the solvent nature was performed in various solvents, such as acetonitrile, acetic acid, dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), ethanol, water, water/EtOAc and EtOH/EtOAc using 0.06 mol% of TiO2/AA/Co in the presence of NHPI (15 mol%) at different temperatures under air (Fig. 5) and visible light. The best efficiency was obtained in EtOAc at 70 °C (Fig. 5ii). The reaction was further optimized with respect to amount of NHPI and catalyst (Fig. 5iii).

Inspection of the results in Fig. 5iii revealed that the efficiency of oxidation was dependent on the NHPI amount, so that the reaction did not proceed in the absence of NHPI under any conditions. NHPI has been reported to act as a free radical oxidation catalyst.52,53 Therefore, a radical mechanism may be suggested for title oxidation system using air similar to previous reports in the presence of cobalt complexes.36,54–59 This was further supported by retarded oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of radical scavengers such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol under the same conditions.
The oxidizing potential of other common oxidants such as O2, H2O2, TBHP, UHP, Oxone® and tetra-n-butylammonium Oxone® (TBAOX) was evaluated under optimized conditions (Fig. 6). The same oxidation efficiency was observed by continuous stream of oxygen instead of air, albeit, air is superior from economic stand point. It should be noted that, the high oxidation performance was observed under ultrasonic agitation with an open flask (Fig. 7). Under the optimized conditions using 0.06 mol% TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst and 15 mol% NHPI under air, visible light and ultrasonic agitation at 70 °C, 1-phenylethanol converted completely to the acetophenone within 25 min.

To establish the general applicability of the method, various benzylic alcohols were subjected to the catalytic oxidation protocol (Table 1). Structurally and electronically diverse benzylic alcohols were generally excellent substrates for this system. No overoxidation of secondary and primary benzylic alcohols to the related ester and carboxylic acids was observed, respectively.

The chemoselectivity of the procedure was prominent. While, the primary benzylic alcohol containing sulfide group, oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde (84% yield at 60 min), sulfide group remained completely intact (Table 1, entry 14). It should be noted that a modest yield was observed in the oxidation of 2-adamantanol (entry 15, 26%), while, no reactivity toward linear aliphatic and allylic alcohols was observed under different conditions.
The promising results obtained in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols prompted us to apply this catalytic system for oxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons. Initially, optimized conditions used for oxidation of 1-phenyl ethanol (Table 1, entry 10) was applied for the oxidation of ethyl benzene which led to 65% acetophenone after 1 h. This result induced us to find a new optimization conditions for efficient oxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons. Ethyl benzene was oxidized completely after 1 h, when 0.12 mol% TiO2/AA/Co and 10 mol% NHPI was employed in ethyl acetate at 60 °C under air, visible light and ultrasonic agitation (Table 2, entry 1). The good/high yields (60–98%) and excellent selectivity (>99%) of ketones were achieved in the oxidation of other benzylic hydrocarbons (Table 2). The reaction also proceeded smoothly with less reactive 4-nitroethylbenzene (entry 3), and 66% of the corresponding ketone was formed as a sole product within 4 h. The method possesses novelty regarding the chemoselectivity. 2-Phenyl ethanol oxidized selectively to 2-hydroxy acetophenone while, hydroxyl group was tolerated in the reaction (Table 2, entry 8). Moreover, adamantane (entry 9) gave only 2-adamantanone with 39% conversion.

3.3. Investigation of photocatalytic properties
The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/AA/Co nanoparticles on the oxidation performance of title system was explored when it was replaced by another nanometal oxides (Fig. 8). Actually, no oxidation activity was observed in the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol using MoO3,40 m-ZrO2,60 Fe3O4 and TiO2 and their nanocomposites such as TiO2/AA, TiO2/Co, AA/Co, Fe3O4/AA, Fe3O4/AA/Co, MoO3/AA, MoO3/AA/Co and ZrO2/AA/Co under the same conditions.

To support this claim, oxidation of 1-phenylethanol under UV light, visible light as well as in dark was investigated (Table 3). Accelerated reactions under light radiation particularly UV light demonstrated the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 core on the oxidation efficiency of TiO2/AA/Co nanohybrid (Table 3, entry 3).

To verify this important issue, band gap energy values of as-prepared TiO2, TiO2/AA and TiO2/AA/Co were assayed. The UV-vis-DR spectra of different samples along with tangent drawn for band gap calculation are presented in Fig. 9. The absorption threshold of pure titania at ∼400 nm indicates the major light absorption in the UV region. Nevertheless, a red-shift of the band-edge of TiO2/AA/Co to wavelengths higher than 400 nm demonstrates higher visible light absorption than those of TiO2, and TiO2/AA samples, making it more favorable for photocatalytic applications under visible light radiation. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis using the Kubelka–Munk formula and Tauc plot,61 revealed significant reduction of the band-gap of TiO2/AA/Co nanoparticles (2.8 eV) compared with those of TiO2/AA (3.1 eV) and especially TiO2 nanoparticles (3.2 eV). Accordingly, a synergistic effect of cobalt ascorbic acid complex and TiO2 nanoparticles can be considered for visible-light photocatalytic activity modification of title nanocatalyst.

3.4. The catalyst reuse and stability
Recovery of TiO2/AA/Co nanocatalyst was easy, efficient and practical. The catalyst was recovered by centrifuging and decantation of the reaction mixture. It was then washed with ethanol as safe solvents, dried under vacuum, and used directly for next round of reaction without further purification. The catalyst proved to be reusable over at least five times in the oxidation of ethylbenzene and 1-phenylethanol without noticeable loss of activity (Fig. 10). Co and Ti were not detected in the reaction solutions according to ICP-AES analysis using hot filtration method. When, the solid-free filtrates were then stirred continuously under standard reaction conditions for the above mentioned substrates, the yields of acetophenone were less than 5% after 12 h. More evidences for stability of catalyst were achieved by comparison of FT-IR and UV-vis spectra of used TiO2/AA/Co with fresh one. These results clearly showed that the structure of the catalyst remained almost intact after five times recovering (Fig. 11).

Table 4 shows the merit of this operationally simple catalytic protocol in comparison with those previously reported methods, in terms of oxygen source, conversion rate, catalyst loading and especially, conditions used in the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol as model substrate. For example full oxidation of 1-phenylethanol to acetophenone took only 25 min, under air in EtOAc as a safe solvent and using a low catalyst loading of 0.06 mol%.

Therefore, the title methodology is environmentally benign because of using air as an oxygen source, visible light as energy source, ethyl acetate as a safe reaction media, reusing of an active catalyst with very low catalyst loading, easy isolation of organic products, and finally, no need for toxic reagents, or solvents.
These advantages make the method amenable to scalability readily. As an example, under a semi-scaled up procedure (20.0 mmol) acetophenone was secured in 89% yield in the oxidation of 1-phenyl ethanol in the presence of TiO2/AA/Co within 25 min.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface modified with cobalt ascorbic acid complex under ultrasonic agitation produced a novel low band-gap photocatalyst (TiO2/AA/Co) with size ranging between 10 and 15 nm. The band gap energy of TiO2 decreased significantly (0.4 eV) after coating with cobalt ascorbic acid complex, according to DRS analysis. Enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity was observed towards aerobic benzylic C–H oxidation of benzylic alcohols and benzylic hydrocarbons. The efficiency, selectivity and oxidative stability of catalyst well documented. A synergistic effect of cobalt ascorbic acid complex and TiO2 nanoparticles on the visible-light photocatalytic activity well demonstrated. The use of air as oxygen source, visible light as energy source, ethyl acetate as a safe reaction media as well as reusing of catalyst with very low catalyst loading providing the scalability of the methods are the strengths of the presented work. Thus, our methods are cost effective which enable the industrially important reactions to be carried out efficiently under aerobic and practically attainable conditions.
