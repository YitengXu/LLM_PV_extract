Broader context
The growth of energy consumption and the limited nonrenewable energy resources have triggered interest in renewable energies. Solar energy is the most hopeful and sustainable energy resource among the renewable alternatives. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are very promising next-generation solar cells for their relatively high light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies and low production cost. As a central component of DSCs, the electrolyte takes an important role in charge transfer and dye regeneration. Before 2010, studies on the electrolyte mainly focused on the iodide/triiodide electrolyte, which has the disadvantages of corrosion of silver-based current collectors, strong visible light absorption and a more or less fixed redox potential. Iodine/iodide-free redox shuttles have received renewed attention recently. The number of articles on new redox shuttles in 2010 and 2011 is more than the sum of all those published earlier. Iodine/iodide-free redox shuttles have had a breakthrough recently, and a record efficiency of 12.3% has been reached. This promising result has inspired scientists to make more research effort in this field. In this review, the development of and recent progress in iodine/iodide-free redox shuttles is highlighted, and strategies for improving efficiencies are provided.

1. Introduction
Because of the growth of energy consumption and limited nonrenewable energy resources, renewable energy will become one of the most important issues for global energy policy. Solar energy is the most promising and sustainable energy resource among the renewable alternatives.1 Solar cells can be used to convert solar energy directly to electricity. Since they were significantly improved by Grätzel and O'Regan in 1991,2 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have displayed an important development and have been regarded as one of the most promising technologies for the next generation of solar cells.
As the central component of a DSC, the electrolyte performs the function of charge transfer and dye regeneration. As the most widely used couple, I−/I3− has a favorable penetration ability into the porous semiconductor film, fast dye regeneration and relatively slow recombination with injected photoelectrons.3 Moreover, I−/I3− is the only redox couple which has been proven to have long term stability. However, several disadvantages limit its industrial application: (a) the corrosion of copper/silver lines, which are used to collect the electrons in large scale modules, makes the production of long-term stable modules much more difficult; (b) the I3− and other possible polyiodides formed in the electrolyte (such as I5−, I7− and I9−) absorb a considerable part of the visible light, downgrading the efficiencies of DSCs;4 (c) the complex redox chemistry in the electrolyte causes great energy loss;5 (4) the redox potential of I−/I3− limits the photovoltage. To avoid these disadvantages, new kinds of redox couples have been designed and applied in DSCs.
Before 2010, studies on the electrolyte mainly focused on the traditional iodine/iodide electrolyte. The development of new redox systems falls far behind that of the sensitizing dyes and other materials for the DSC components. The field, however, has received renewed attention recently. The number of articles on new redox shuttles in 2010 and 2011 was more than the sum of all those published earlier.6
In 2011, the Grätzel group published a DSC efficiency of 12.3% by using a new Co-complex-based electrolyte in combination with sensitizers designed to retard the otherwise often encountered and problematic recombination loss reactions. This is, so far, is the highest reported DSC conversion efficiency. These promising results have inspired scientists to make more efforts in the field of redox system improvement.
2. Principle function of DSCs and the design of redox systems
A typical DSC has three central components; these are the working electrode, the electrolyte and the counter electrode. The working electrode is typically made from a mesoporous metal oxide deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) film on a suitable substrate. This porous electrode is subsequently sensitized by dyes. Usually, semiconductor TiO2 nanoparticles are sintered to form the mesoporous metal oxide film, and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is used as TCO. Electrolyte systems are normally divided into liquid, quasi-solid and solid electrolytes. The distinction between quasi-solid and solid electrolytes is that quasi-solid electrolytes still contain a molecular redox system, but the liquid has been solidified using a gel, polymer or likewise. The purely solid electrolytes are based on molecular or polymeric hole-conductors, thus requiring no extra redox system to be present. Molecular redox shuttles perform the main function in the electrolyte to transfer charge and to regenerate (reduce) the sensitizing dye. The counter electrode is also made from a conducting substrate and often with a catalyst deposited on the surface in order to facilitate charge transfer upon reduction of the electrolyte redox system. The most common catalysts are nanoparticles of platinum or large surface area carbon materials.7
When illuminated by light, the electron of the sensitizing dye will be excited from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) or other unoccupied molecular orbitals, and the dye is transferred to an excited state. The photogenerated excited electron is then injected into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor, and is subsequently transported to the TCO layer of the working electrode and then through the external load to the counter electrode. Upon injection of the photoelectron the dye turns into a dye cation. In the electrolyte, the oxidized component of the redox pair retrieves an electron from the counter electrode surface thus transforming into the reducing component of the pair. The reduced component of the redox system then migrates through the electrolyte and eventually transfers the electron to the HOMO of the dye cation. The dye cation is thereby transferred to a neutral ground state by regeneration.8 Of course, among the vast number of sensitizing molecules investigated in the literature, other charges of the dye may also exist. However, it is always transferred between a reduced and an oxidized state in the photoinitiated processes. The electron transfer processes are shown in Fig. 1 by arrows. Unfortunately, the DSC device also exhibits some undesirable processes. The injected electrons in the TiO2 CB can recombine with both the dye molecules and the redox couples, and the exited dyes may relax back to the ground state without injection. These processes are shown in Fig. 1 using dotted arrows.
 Fig. 1  Schematic description of the DSC principle. 
The efficiency of a DSC device is determined by its short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), its open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and its fill factor (ff).9 All of the three parameters will be significantly affected by the electrolyte in DSCs, and by the interaction of the electrolyte with the electrode interfaces. For instance, Jsc can be affected by the transport of the redox-pair components in the electrolyte. The ff can be affected by the catalyzing ability to transfer an electron to the oxidized component of the redox shuttle by the catalyst deposited on the counter electrode. The Voc can be significantly affected by the redox potential of the electrolyte. Voc can be described by eqn (1).10 (1)In eqn (1), n is the number of photoelectrons in the TiO2, NCB is the effective density of states of the TiO2 conduction band, Eredox is the redox potential of the electrolyte redox couple, and q is the unit charge. Thus, at open-circuit conditions, the number of electrons in the TiO2, n, is determined by the balance between electron injection and charge recombination.11 Therefore, from eqn (1), we can conclude that the Voc is determined by a selection of processes, such as the irradiation level, the properties of the semiconductor conduction band, the injection efficiency of the dye, the recombination loss rate of photoelectrons and the redox potential of the electrolyte redox couple. Generally, n is considerably lower than NCB, and the maximum Voc is therefore determined by the difference between the ECB of TiO2 and the Eredox of the electrolyte.4,12 Therefore, the redox potential of the redox system plays an important role in the Voc obtained in a DSC. For the I−/I3− redox couple, the possibilities to increase the Voc are limited. Of course, some modifications can be achieved by changing the concentrations and relative ratio of iodide and iodine, but nevertheless the redox potential of the redox system is more or less fixed.
Otherwise, in the conventional I−/I3−-based electrolyte, the mechanisms are more complicated. The regeneration is a multicharge-transfer process. The exact mechanism for the regeneration is still debated, but a two-step process is generally accepted.4,13 In the first step of the dye-regeneration process, the oxidized dye and iodide lead to the formation of a diiodide radical (I2−˙).14–16 The second step follows when the formed I2−˙ disproportionates into I3− and I−. This leads to a large loss in potential equal to the difference between the I−/I2−˙ and the I−/I3− redox potentials (approximately 0.4 eV in acetonitrile).17 The processes are shown in Fig. 2. D+ + 2I− → D + I2−˙(2) 2I2−˙ → I3− + I−(3)

The dye regeneration is most probably the largest single source for loss of potential in the device.5 Single electron redox couples offer a less energetic, direct way to regeneration, which can save the energy to obtain higher efficiencies. Therefore, the design of new redox shuttles is necessary for more efficient DSCs exhibiting higher Vocs.
The new redox system must also meet the requirement that the redox potential must be more negative (on the NHE, Normal Hydrogen Electrode, scale) than the HOMO of the sensitizing dye. Otherwise, regeneration of the dye will become highly inefficient with low conversion efficiencies (low photocurrents) as a result. Therefore, the design of an efficient redox system and the combination with appropriate sensitizing dyes is a pivotal challenge for highly efficient DSCs.
3. Metal complex redox shuttles
3.1 Cobalt-complex redox shuttles
As we know, CoII-complexes are commonly in the high spin state, and CoIII-complexes are in the low spin state (see Fig. 3). Therefore, CoII-complexes are more reactive than CoIII-complexes. CoII in the electrolyte performs the function of regenerating the sensitizer in the photoanode because of its higher reactivity. At the counter electrode, CoIII is catalyzed to obtain an electron, and converted to CoII. The CoIII is comparatively stable, and therefore, the catalytic activity of the catalyst is important to CoII/III redox.

In 2001, Grätzel's group first reported on the charge-transfer dynamics of a Co-complex redox system (Co(dbbip)22+/3+, Fig. 4) in DSCs. With this new one-electron redox couple, DSCs sensitized by the ruthenium dye (Z316) achieved an overall electrical power conversion efficiency of 2.2% under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2).18 (The structures of the mentioned dyes can be found in Table 8.) After two years, a series of cobalt complexes used as redox shuttles in electrolytes of DSCs were reported by the same group. Co(dbbip)22+/3+ displayed the highest efficiency of 4.2% together with a ruthenium-based dye, Z907.19 The electrochemical properties were also well studied in subsequent work.20 In 2002, Bignozzi and his co-workers studied a series of substituted polypyridine complexes of cobalt.21 DSCs based on the electrolyte containing Co(dtb-bpy)32+/3+ showed the best efficiency. The sensitizer used was the ruthenium-based dye N3.

The Co-based complex redox shuttles have the advantage of a tunable redox potential obtained through modification of the ligands. However, the efficiency obtained was typically much lower than for DSCs based on the iodine/iodide electrolyte. In order to determine the fundamental problem of the Co-based redox systems, Yanagida's group studied the charge recombination between Co-complex redox pairs and TiO2 in detail.22 Due to the slow charge-transfer kinetics and cationic nature of the Co-complex redox couples, as compared to I−/I3−, Co complexes are more likely to experience recombination with photoelectrons from the TiO2. Using Li+ as an electrolyte additive shows an increase in the electron lifetime for a specific CoII/CoIII electrolyte. The results are claimed to be correlated with the decrease in local concentration of CoIII at the photoelectrode surface. Results also show that TBP (tert-butyl pyridine) facilitates the charge transfer from CoII to the dye cation, with the association of the change of the reorganization energy between CoII and CoIII. A thin Al2O3 blocking layer over the mesoporous TiO2 surface has also been used to minimize the recombination between photoinjected electrons and the CoIII species in the electrolyte.23 The conversion efficiency more than the doubles, passing from 0.9% to 2.5% under 30 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination in their system. Further investigation of cobalt-bipyridyl redox shuttles proceeded with Al2O3 coated TiO2 films by Klahr and Hamann.24 With the dye Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-dicarboxy-bpy)](PF6)2, cobalt redox couples showed better dye regeneration abilities compared to triiodide/iodide, and this is an advantage of Co-complex redoxes. A significant discrepancy in performance was still found between DSCs containing the different cobalt redox shuttles. The differences in the photoelectron lifetimes (recombination kinetics) of DSCs were determined. The lifetimes at a given electrode potential were found to decrease in the order of [Co(dtb-bpy)3]2+/3+ > [Co(dm-bpy)3]2+/3+ > [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, and the recombination rate constants decrease in the reverse order. These results show that the structures of the Co complexes used as redox shuttles are also very important to the DSCs. The tert-butyl groups of the ligands in the compound can act as spacers, and thus decrease the electronic coupling by a factor of ∼20 as compared to methyl-substituted ones.25 The same authors also found that the Co(dm-bpy)32+/3+ redox couple can produce comparable external quantum yields to Co(dtb-bpy)32+/3+, when employed as redox shuttles in DSCs. However, the photovoltaic performance of both systems is constrained by mass-transport limitations of the oxidized species. Elliott and his co-workers studied the diffusion of Co complexes inside the bulk layer and dyed porous TiO2 film, and found that the effective diffusion coefficient of Co(dtb-bpy)32+/3+ through typical TiO2 films in DSCs is about one order of magnitude slower than that of I3−, after accounting for viscosity differences.26 This difference may be attributed to the greater size and slower bulk diffusion of Co(dtb-bpy)32+/3+, greater viscosity of cobalt complex solutions, and a possible electrostatic surface interaction of Co(dtb-bpy)32+/3+ within the TiO2 film.
Although both the recombination loss problem and the mass-transport limitation problem of Co complexes are well studied, the problems have not yet been resolved. In 2009, the research group of Sun reported a new strategy of organic dye design by adding multiple alkoxyl chains to the donor part of D–π–A (Donor–π spacer–Acceptor) dyes.27 The most efficient dye, D35, containing four insulating butoxy chains appears to efficiently prevent photoelectrons in TiO2 from recombining with redox species in the electrolyte. In 2010, Hagfeldt and his co-workers introduced the dye D35 to the Co-complex redox system, and achieved an amazing result.28 The key feature in their strategy to reduce the recombination losses was to place the blocking hydrophobic groups on the sensitizing dyes, rather than, as in previous studies, on the Co complexes. This approach allows the use of non-substituted Co complexes with higher diffusion constants. The strategy thus successfully reduces both the recombination losses and, at least partly, the mass-transport limitations. It should be noted that the TiO2 film used was slightly diluted in order to increase the porosity. Organic dyes typically have higher extinction coefficients than the standard ruthenium sensitizers, which makes it possible to use thinner TiO2 films in the DSC devices. The use of a thinner TiO2 film is advantageous, since it decreases both the effects of mass transport problems and the risk of recombination losses. The cobalt redox system with the highest diffusion coefficients and more suitable redox potentials improved the photocurrent and photovoltage of the device. An overall conversion efficiency of 6.7% was obtained with open-circuit potentials of more than 0.9 V under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 G illumination using the combination of dye D35 and a Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox system. An excellent performance was also found under low light intensity, indoor conditions.
Different sensitizers have been designed and synthesized by the new strategy. Wang and his co-workers reported a new metal-free D–π–A photosensitizer featuring the 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene conjugated spacer.29 The new kind of sensitizing dye not only contains two hexyloxy chains in the donor part, but also has two long carbon chains in the spacer part. The redox shuttle of Co(phen)32+/3+ was used to fit the energy level of the dyes. The combination of the dye C218 and Co(phen)32+/3+ gave a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% determined at 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 conditions. A similar dye, C229, with the 2,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene unit as spacer provided an efficiency of 9.4% together with the same Co-complex redox system.30 Another dye, C233, with two 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b']dithiophene conjugated spacers and two acceptors achieved an efficiency of 7.7% with the same electrolyte.31 Grätzel's group also reported a new organic dye offering DSCs with high efficiencies.32 The new dye Y123 contains four alkoxy chains in the donor part, which is very similar to the structure of the donor in the sensitizer D35. The spacer unit contains two further hexyl chains. The complex system Co(bpy)32+/3+ was used as the redox couple. The new combination gave DSCs with an efficiency of 9.6%.
Gathering all known developments and exploiting co-sensitization based on one zinc-complex dye and the Y123 organic dye, Grätzel's group later published an extraordinary article with a new world record efficiency of 12.3%.33 The newly designed zinc-based dye YD2-o-C8 contains two alkyl chains and four alkoxy chains on the ligand of the complex. The specific molecular design greatly retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the TiO2 film to the oxidized cobalt-based mediator. The redox potential of the system Co(bpy)32+/3+ offered strikingly high photovoltages, approaching 1 volt. Co-sensitization of YD2-o-C8 with Y123 further enhanced the performance of the device, leading to the record power conversion efficiency of 12.3% under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 illumination.
Although scientists have paid much attention to the dye design, the fundamental studies on recombination reactions and mass transport processes of Co-complex-based redox never stopped. Bignozzi and his co-workers studied mass transport and change transfer at different temperatures in DSCs.34 The study pointed out that, at room temperature, both the electron transfer rate k = 1.24 × 10−4 cm s−1 and the diffusion coefficient D = 5.85 × 10−7 cm s−1 of the redox system Co(dtb-bpy)32+/3+ in the electrolyte solvent methoxypropionitrile (MPN) are rather low. Raising the temperature has a beneficial effect, increasing the rate constant of electron transfer more than 6 times and the ionic diffusion coefficient more than 3 times at 80 °C. However, for all temperatures studied, the slow mass transport of the CoII/CoIII species still remains the rate-determining, and thus efficiency-limiting, step in the DSCs. Viscosity measurements have demonstrated that the ionic mass transport in MPN follows Stokes' law and that the Walden product is constant in the temperature range investigated.
The effects of driving forces for recombination and regeneration on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs based on D35 have been studied by Hagfeldt and his co-workers.35 By using a series of cobalt complexes with different redox potentials, the dependence of the driving force for recombination and dye regeneration on the photovoltaic performance was examined. The photovoltages of the devices were found to increase and the photocurrent to decrease with increasing (i.e. more positive voltages with respect to the NHE) redox potential of the complexes. The halflife for regeneration of the oxidized dye by Co(bpy)32+/3+ was observed to be similar to that of the traditional iodide/triiodide redox couple, whereas the regeneration kinetics was noted to become slower for systems containing cobalt complexes with less driving force (lower over-potential) for regeneration. A driving force for dye regeneration of 390 mV for Co(Cl-phen)32+/3+ was found to be sufficient to regenerate more than 80% of the D35 dye molecules, resulting in a conversion efficiency of incident photons to an electric current of above 80%. However, the driving force of Co(NO2-phen)32+/3+ (260 mV) was found to be not so sufficient, as it can only regenerate 60% of the dye molecules.
Different TiO2 films are also used to suppress recombination and improve redox transport. Park and his co-workers increased the porosity of the mesoporous TiO2 film from 0.52 to 0.59 in order to improve the mass transport of the cobalt complex.36 The photocurrent density was improved by nearly a factor of two despite a decrease of 23% in dye loading. Sung and his co-workers enhanced the photovoltaic properties of DSCs containing the cobalt bipyridyl redox system by employing vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube electrodes.37 As compared to the 11 μm thick nanoparticle electrode, the 35 μm thick nanotube electrode exhibited an efficiency 1.5 times higher together with a Jsc 2.5 times higher in spite of having a similar amount of adsorbed dye molecules. The mass transports as well as contact between the cobalt redox electrolyte and the TiO2 electrode were greatly improved by using a nanotube electrode. The electron lifetime and electron diffusion length were also noted to be longer within the nanotube electrode. These superior photovoltaic properties may be attributed to the large pore size and vertically oriented structures of the nanotube electrodes.
In order to improve the efficiency, various carbon-based counter electrodes have been applied in DSCs based on cobalt-complex redox electrolytes. In 2010, Bignozzi and his co-workers first reported a new kind of screen-printed carbon counter electrodes suitable for electrolytes based on cobalt complexes.38 The conversion efficiencies of DSCs based on the new cathode/cobalt-complex system were 30% lower than those recorded with Pt/iodide. In 2011, Grätzel's group reported a counter electrode based on thin semitransparent film graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs).39 Both the charge-transfer resistance and stability were found to be better than for the traditional platinum-based electrode under prolonged potential cycling. The sensitizing dye Y123 and the electrolyte redox system Co(bpy)32+/3+ were used in the DSC devices. DSCs with GNP cathodes were found to be superior to those containing platinum-based cathodes at higher illumination intensities. The conversion efficiency of DSCs containing a GNP cathode and a platinum-based cathode were reported to be 9.4% and 8.2%, respectively, under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. However, under 9.5 mW cm−2 illumination, the DSCs containing a GNP cathode gave an efficiency of 9.3%, which was less than DSCs containing a platinum cathode showing an efficiency of 9.5%. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was also used as a catalyst on the counter electrode showing much lower charge transfer resistances for cobalt-complex redox couples.40 An excellent power conversion efficiency of 10.3% was achieved with dye Y123, the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple and PEDOT as counter electrode. A new redox system consisting of Co(bpy-pz)22+/3+ was used to fit the dye redox characteristics of the dye Y123 better.41,42 A conversion efficiency of 9.3% was reported under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and the same phenomenon with respect to higher efficiency at higher illumination intensity was found. The results show that GNP and PEDOT as counter-electrode materials represent a very promising alternative to the noble metal platinum.
Co-complex redox shuttles have also been applied to NiO-based, p-type DSCs.43 A series of polypyridyl cobalt complexes containing different substituents were applied as redox mediators in NiO-based, p-type DSCs, which were sensitized using a perylenemonoimide naphthalenediimide (PMI-NDI) dye. The steric factors of the cobalt complexes used were found to be the determining factor for the photocurrents and photovoltages obtained, rather than their redox potentials. Bulky substituents were found to retard the recombination reactions between holes in the mesoporous NiO film and the reduced form of the redox couple.
Right now, Co-complex shuttles are the most efficient redox couples for DSCs. By tuning the redox potentials of the Co-complex systems and the energy level of the sensitizing dyes, we are likely to very soon read about further advancements of DSC conversion efficiency.
The structures of various cobalt complex structures used as redox shuttles in DSCs are shown in Fig. 4. The redox potentials are collected in Table 1.

3.2 Fe-complex redox shuttles
Ferrocene(Fc)/ferrocenium has many advantages as a redox system with respect to electrochemical properties. However, DSCs assembled containing this redox system did not provide high conversion efficiencies in attempts before 2010.44 The basic problem is the rapid and ‘efficient’ interfacial recombination loss of photoinjected electrons to the oxidized component of the redox couple, which eliminates the photovoltaic effect. In 2001, Fields and his co-workers introduced two methods for passivating the interfaces to decrease the recombination loss rates. The methods make it possible to use kinetically fast (both ways) couples in DSCs for the first time.44 Hagfeldt and his co-workers passivated TiO2 films by a trichloromethylsilane reaction in order to decrease the fast recombination rates with the ferrocene redox couple.45 The formation and binding of poly(methylsiloxane) on the dye-sensitized TiO2 surface decreased the recombination rate of the photoinjected electrons with ferrocenium and thereby improved the efficiency of the DSC. Also a blocking layer was introduced on the FTO substrates and TiO2 nanoparticle surface in order to decrease the recombination.46,47 The modified TiO2 electrodes enable the ferrocene/ferrocenium system to be used as a shuttle. The result showed the addition of a blocking layer can dramatically improve the photovoltaic performance. These counteractions show some good effects on the DSC efficiency, but the resulting devices did not show high efficiencies (η < 0.4%).
In 2011, a novel, metal-free organic D–π–A sensitizer (Carbz-PAHTDTT) was designed and synthesized by Daeneke and his co-workers.48 The DSCs with Carbz-PAHTDTT allowed energy conversion efficiencies of 7.5% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination. The dye is special for its large donor unit and long spacer unit. The ingenious design efficiently prevented photoelectrons in the TiO2 film from recombining with the redox system, revealing the great potential of ferrocene-based electrolytes if used together with well-designed dyes in DSC devices.
Moreover, the exclusion of oxygen during electrolyte preparation and cell construction was also very important to achieve improved and reproducible device performances. The ferrocenium is unstable in the presence of oxygen, and can easily decompose to Fe3+, Fe2O3 and other species.49,50 When the ferrocene/ferrocenium electrolyte was exposed to the atmosphere, the electrolyte with the ferrocene/Fe3+ couple was obtained. Therefore, some previous experiments deemed to be a failure may lead to different results, by using well protected ferrocene/ferrocenium couple.
Recently, Daeneke and his co-workers reported a series of ferrocene derivatives covering a redox potential range of 0.09 to 0.94 V vs. NHE51 (see Table 2). Similar solar conversion efficiencies (4.3–5.2%) were achieved when using Et2Fc, EtFc and Fc. The alkylated redox mediators had lower efficiencies and open circuit voltages for their more negative redox potentials. The halogen ferrocene derivatives, BrFc and Br2Fc, showed lower efficiencies than Et2Fc, EtFc and Fc despite their more favorable redox potentials. Transient absorption measurements revealed that Et2Fc, EtFc and Fc, which provide driving forces of 35–46 kJ mol−1, promote fast dye regeneration by rapidly reacting with the photo-oxidized dye, whereas this is not the case for BrFc and Br2Fc for which the driving forces are ≤ 18 kJ mol−1. The study identified that the ideal driving force for dye regeneration lies between 18 and 35 kJ mol−1 (the redox potential differences between the dye and the mediator, ΔE, are from 0.19 to 0.36 V). Concluding from these results, to increase the efficiency of ferrocene-based DSCs, the ferrocene derivatives should be matched to dyes with appropriate energy levels, such that ΔE ≈ 0.36 V.

The Fe-containing complexes with bigger ligands have also been studied in a mixture with Co-containing complexes (Fig. 5).52 In combination with a ruthenium-based dye, the charge-collection efficiency was improved by efficient dye regeneration and retarded recombination losses. The efficiency of the regeneration cascade was also critically dependent upon the ability of the CoII complex used to intercept the FeIII centers in this system. In general, hybrid systems, if designed adequately, may constitute a useful route to new redox systems. Our group has newly invented a hybrid electrolyte with S2−/Sx2− and I−.55 The new hybrid system was demonstrated to outperform the well-known I−/I3− redox system in DSCs. An efficiency of 9.1% was achieved in our lab under AM1.5 10 illumination using the dye N719, considerably higher than the efficiency of 8.0% of the I−/I3−-based electrolyte.

Aqueous ferricyanide electrolytes were applied in quantum dot sensitized solar cells previously,56 and a similar redox couple K4NiII[FeII(CN)6]/K3NiII[FeIII(CN)6] was also used in solid state DSCs.53 Recently, the classical Fe(CN)64−/3− redox couple was used in DSCs with an aqueous electrolyte by Daeneke and his co-workers.54 A conversion efficiency of over 4% could be achieved by applying the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox couple. The results show a possible method for new redox shuttle design.
3.3 Cu-complex redox shuttles
In 2005, Fukuzumi and his co-workers introduced blue copper model complexes ([Cu(SP)(mmt)]0/−, [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ and [Cu(phen)2]2+/+) to DSCs as redox systems (Table 3).57 The electron self-exchange rate constant was found to increase in the order: [Cu(phen)2]2+/+ < [Cu(SP)(mmt)]0/− < [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+, in agreement with the order of the smaller structural change between the copper(II) and copper(I) complexes due to the distorted tetragonal geometry. Under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination the conversion efficiencies of DSCs containing [Cu(phen)2]2+/+, [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+, and [Cu(SP)(mmt)]0/− were recorded as 0.1%, 1.4%, and 1.3%, respectively (Fig. 6). In 2011, Wang's group combined the Cu-complex redox couple [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ and the sensitizing dye C218 to DSC systems. A conversion efficiency of 7.0% was achieved under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination.58 The dye C218 also contains alkoxy and alkyl chains thought to block recombination loss reactions. There are only a few studies on Cu-complex redox couples used in DSCs. The more precise design of the dye and redox system with proper energy levels can definitely offer more efficient DSCs. This is a very promising field for new and efficient redox systems .

3.4 Ni-complex redox shuttles
In 2010, a novel Ni-complex-based redox shuttle, Ni(carbollide)2−/0, was reported by Hupp and his co-workers, showing to be a fast and non-corrosive redox shuttle.59 In addition to its non-corrosive nature, the Ni(carbollide)2−/0 system also has many favorable properties as compared to metallocene systems, including fast mass transport, fast dye regeneration, and attractive electron transfer kinetics. DSCs containing this redox system exhibited power conversion efficiency at best at 0.9%; tert-butylpyridine and TMABF4 were used as electrolyte additives. Furthermore, Mirkin and co-workers reported a promising new class of non-corrosive B(9)/(B12)-modified NiIII/NiIV bis(dicarbollide) complexes derived from the systematic functionalization of the NiIII/NiIV bis(dicarbollide) framework with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups.60 Ni(carbollide)2−/0 showed a better conversion efficiency than other species (Fig. 7). Improved device power conversion efficiencies ranging from 0.7% to 2.0% were achieved using the Ni(carbollide)2−/0 shuttles. Therefore, the properties of these complexes can be studied in the context of next-generation DSCs. Although the entire scope is not yet explored, the new design offers an avenue to create diverse DSC redox shuttles (Table 4).

4. Organic redox shuttles
4.1 TEMPO-based redox shuttles
2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is a kind of non-toxic, stable organic radical which is widely employed as an antioxidant and light stabilizer.63 TEMPO materials have also been used as charge-storage components for organic-radical-based secondary batteries.64–66 In 2008, Grätzel's group used the organic radical TEMPO as the redox system in DSCs.61 The solar cell sensitized by the dye D149 together with an electrolyte based on the TEMPO redox system gave an efficiency of 5.4% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination, which was the record for organic redox systems at that time. In 2010, Nishide and his co-workers studied the electrochemically reversible redox properties of a series of 4-substituted TEMPO redox shuttles (OH-TEMPO, NHCOCH3-TEMPO and CN-TEMPO; Fig. 8 and Table 5).62 The substitutions enhanced the photovoltages of the DSCs. However, the most efficient redox shuttle is still non-substituted TEMPO offering an efficiency of 2.4%. A new type of additive based on benzimidazole derivatives (xBI) used in combination with the TEMPO electrolytes was examined, and the addition of xBIs increased the open-circuit voltage (Voc) by a band-edge shift upwards.67

4.2 Disulfide/thiourea and disulfide/thiolate based redox shuttles
S2−/S22− and S2−/Sn2− are possible redox couples for dye-sensitized solar cells. However, because of their poor solubility in organic solvents, they are always used for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells in aqueous electrolytes.68,69 Organic disulfide can be dissolved better in organic solvent. Therefore, they were investigated for use as redox couples in DSCs.
In 2010, Meng and his co-workers reported a colorless electrolyte containing an organic redox couple.70 The redox couple tetramethylthiourea (TMTU) and its oxidized dimer, the tetramethylformaminium disulfide dication ([TMFDS]2+), was applied to DSCs. The structure of TMTU and [TMFDS]2+ are shown in Fig. 9. The low cost, non-corrosive redox system works better in combination with carbon-based counter electrodes. A conversion efficiency of 3.1% was achieved using the sensitizing dye N3 under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination. The redox system was later applied to DSCs containing a different sensitizer by Wang and his co-workers.71 A metal-free, indoline-based sensitizer (D131) was found to outperform the ruthenium-based sensitizers (e.g. Z907). The overall light-to-electric power conversion efficiency under AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination amounted to 3.9%.
 Fig. 9  The structures of TMTU and [TMFDS](TFSI)2. 
Also in 2010, Grätzel's group reported a disulfide/thiolate based organic redox couple.72 The new redox system shows negligible absorption in the visible spectral range. Sensitized by dye Z907, DSCs containing this redox system gave an unprecedented efficiency of 6.4% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The novel redox couple offers a viable pathway for the development of stable and efficient DSCs. Zou and his co-workers introduced graphite as the counter electrode material in order to more efficiently catalyze the new redox system.73 Results show that graphite can catalyze the T2/T− system more efficiently than the I3−/I− system. However, the catalytic ability of the combination graphite/(T2/T−) is not as good as the traditional combination platinum/(I3−/I−) with respect to charge-transfer resistance. Although the catalysis of T2/T− on the counter electrode surface is excellent, new materials could significantly improve the system with higher efficiencies as a result.
Sun's group developed another disulfide/thiolate-based organic redox couple.74 2-Mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole (McMT) derivatives have been intensely studied owing to their special electrochemical behavior.75–77 The new organic redox couple for DSCs contains the thiolate form (McMT−) and the disulfide dimer (BMT) derived from McMT. Based on a metal-free organic dye, TH305, an efficiency of 4.0% was achieved under AM1.5 one sun illumination. A higher photocurrent was obtained as compared to I−/I3− owing to lower light absorption in the visible spectral region. The McMT−/BMT redox couple significantly decreases the electron recombination rate between TiO2 and the electrolyte, but the catalysis on a counter electrode based on the traditional platinized TCO surface is not very efficient and is manifested by a low fill factor. Further work introducing an organic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) material as catalyst on the counter electrode showed better performance.78 Together with the sensitizing dye TH305 and the counter-electrode catalyst PEDOT, DSCs showed a conversion efficiency of 6.0% under AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination. A series of different disulfide/thiolate based organic redox couples, McMO−/BMO, McPO−/BPO, McBT−/BBT, McBO−/BBO, have also been investigated (Table 6). The results obtained showed that McMT−/BMT still outperforms the new systems.

Our group reported a new organic redox couple L-cysteine/L-cystine (DMPIC/DMPIDC) recently.79 The molecular structures of the redox couple can be found in Fig. 10. Although the mechanism of this redox couple is not very clear, DSCs employing the new redox couple achieved comparable efficiencies of 7.7%. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopic study revealed that the charge recombination between the conduction band of the TiO2 film and the redox couple is efficiently restrained.

Recently, Grätzel's group compared conventional platinum, CoS and PEDOT with the organic disulfide/thiolate electrolyte (T2/T−).80 Results showed that the three catalysts are in the order of PEDOT > Pt > CoS. The stabilities of DSCs with the three different counter electrodes were tested. Although the long-term stability of T2/T− was not very good, DSCs with PEDOT counter electrodes showed a much better stability than those with a conventional Pt-based one. Finally, an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 7.9% was achieved under 1 sun illumination with the T2/T− redox couple and PEDOT counter electrode, which represents the highest efficiency that has so far been reported for an organic redox couple.
4.3 Tetrathiafulvalene-based redox shuttles
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) has been extensively investigated as an electron-donating unit in charge-transfer complexes.81–83 TTF possesses two steps of oxidation to TTF2+, the redox potentials of both steps may be suitable for DSCs (Fig. 11). Zhang studied TTF as an organic, iodine-free redox mediator in DSCs in conjunction with a ruthenium-based dye in his doctoral thesis in 2008.84 In 2012, Kloo and his co-workers further investigated TTF in combination with the organic sensitizing dye D35.85 The problem of recombination losses, mass transport limitations and inefficient catalysis on the counter electrode are found to limit performance. Moreover, the light absorption of TTF-based electrolytes is stronger than that of the I−/I3− system. Thus, DSCs with TTF-based electrolytes show worse photovoltaic performances than those containing I−/I3−-based electrolytes (Table 7).

4.4 Other organic redox shuttles
There are many other organic redox couples that can potentially be used in DSCs. Some studies on the electron transfer between sensitized TiO2 and organic redox systems, such as quinone/hydroquinone,86 phenothiazines,87 and triarylamine,88 have been reported. However, so far the efficiencies reported are not very high.
5. Br−/Br3−, interhalogen and pseudohalide redox shuttles
5.1 Br−/Br3− redox shuttles
Bromine and iodine are both halogen elements, and some of the chemical properties of the two elements and their compounds are similar. The redox potential of the Br−/Br3− system is more positive than that of the I−/I3− couple. Most dyes used in DSCs are designed for the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple, and consequently the HOMOs of dyes are typically too high in energy for the Br−/Br3− system under common conditions. In 2005, Sugihara and his co-workers reported that Eosin Y-sensitized solar cells are suitable for the Br−/Br3−-based electrolyte.89 The LUMO (−0.92 V) of the dye Eosin Y is more negative than the ECB (−0.5 V)90 of TiO2, and the HOMO (1.15 V) is more positive than E0(Br−/Br3−) (1.09 V). Consequently, this meets the thermo-dynamic requirements for both efficient electron injection and efficient dye regeneration. Under AM1.5 one sun illumination, an Eosin Y-sensitized solar cell in combination with a Br−/Br3−-based electrolyte showed a conversion efficiency of 2.6%, more than that of a DSC containing the corresponding I−/I3−-based electrolyte (1.7%) under the same conditions. The better efficiency obtained is mainly caused by the high Voc of 0.81 V in the Br−/Br3−-based DSCs as compared to 0.45 V for DSCs based on the I−/I3− system. The significant gain in Voc can be attributed to the larger energy level difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2.
In 2009, our group designed two novel carbazole dyes (TC301 and TC306) for the Br−/Br3− redox system; a Voc of 1.16 V and an efficiency of 3.7% and a Voc of 0.94 V and an efficiency of 5.2% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination was obtained, respectively.91 The dyes TC301 and TC306 both display more positive HOMO levels (1.59 and 1.38 V vs. NHE) than the redox potential of the Br−/Br3− redox system, which provides sufficient driving force for the regeneration of the dyes. Under similar conditions with the I−/I3− system, DSCs sensitized by the dyes TC301 and TC306 produced a Voc of 0.70 V and an efficiency of 2.4% and a Voc of 0.62 V and an efficiency of 4.1%, respectively. Further studies were carried out using a series of new, metal-free dyes TC301–TC310 in 2010.92 The effects on the photoelectrochemical properties of the dyes and the performance of the DSCs including the effects of Li+ ion concentration were studied. A large increase in Voc was found to be a result of not only the larger energy gap between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2, but also a result of suppressed electron recombination rate.
Electrolytes containing the Br−/Br3− redox system can greatly improve the photovoltage of DSC devices if used together with well-designed dyes. However, a major limitation caused by the restrictions of the Br−/Br3− redox potential in combination with the TiO2 conduction band energy, is that absorption bands of, from an energy level point of view, suitable dyes cannot be very wide. However Br−/Br3−-based electrolytes may have great potential in UV–Vis responsive top cells of two-cell stacking tandem DSCs.
Interhalogen redox systems based on the IBr2− and the I2Br− anions have been studied in various electrolyte solvents in combination with ruthenium-based sensitizing dyes.93 Conversion efficiencies up to 6.4% were achieved under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination. The systems are difficult to fully characterize because of complex equilibria between various interhalogen anions in the electrolyte solution.
5.2 Pseudohalogen redox shuttles
Two pseudohalogen redox couples, SeCN−/(SeCN)3− and SCN−/(SCN)3−, have been investigated as redox shuttles for DSCs by Oskam et al.94 in 2001. The redox potentials of the two redox couples are 0.19 and 0.43 V more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple, respectively. The performance was found not to be very exciting. The main cause is the inefficient dye regeneration by the SeCN− or SCN− redox-system component. In 2004, Grätzel's group reported an ionic liquid-based electrolyte containing the SeCN−-based redox couple.95 A conversion efficiency of 7.5% was achieved in combination with the dye N3. Meyer and co-workers applied the SeCN−/(SeCN)3− and SCN−/(SCN)3− to SnO2-based DSCs.96 The authors found that the IPCE and Voc were comparable for the redox systems SeCN−/(SeCN)3− and I−/I3− using different ruthenium sensitizers. Although pseudohalogen redox can reach a high efficiency, the poor stability97 limited the development of the redox couple. By solving the stability problem, pseudohalogen redox will be very promising in the future.
6. Conclusions
The field of iodine/iodide-free electrolytes is a very promising arena for achieving highly efficient DSCs. One reason is that the redox potential can be modified in a flexible way. Another advantage may be non-corrosive properties that make the alternatives attractive for commercial use. The most efficient redox couples and corresponding dyes from different year are collected in Table 8. Although many new high performing redox couples were invented, the stability still needs to improve. We should focus on the stability, while improving performance. Most redox shuttles are known to display problems of high recombination losses and mass-transport limitations. In order to resolve these problems, the design of suitable dyes adapted to specific redox systems is a very important prerequisite. The adaptation of proper energy levels in combination with a bulky structure containing multiple alkoxy and alkyl chains is necessary. The redox systems based on metal complexes are preferred for future DSCs because of the smaller structural change upon redox reactions (lower reorganization energies). Nevertheless, it is clear that any advance in redox system development will have to go hand in hand with adapted design of new sensitizing dyes.

Broader context
The growth of energy consumption and the limited nonrenewable energy resources have triggered interest in renewable energies. Solar energy is the most hopeful and sustainable energy resource among the renewable alternatives. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are very promising next-generation solar cells for their relatively high light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies and low production cost. As a central component of DSCs, the electrolyte takes an important role in charge transfer and dye regeneration. Before 2010, studies on the electrolyte mainly focused on the iodide/triiodide electrolyte, which has the disadvantages of corrosion of silver-based current collectors, strong visible light absorption and a more or less fixed redox potential. Iodine/iodide-free redox shuttles have received renewed attention recently. The number of articles on new redox shuttles in 2010 and 2011 is more than the sum of all those published earlier. Iodine/iodide-free redox shuttles have had a breakthrough recently, and a record efficiency of 12.3% has been reached. This promising result has inspired scientists to make more research effort in this field. In this review, the development of and recent progress in iodine/iodide-free redox shuttles is highlighted, and strategies for improving efficiencies are provided.
