1. Introduction
In the current low carbon society, energy storage and energy conversion are two key technologies to cope with the energy crisis as well as environmental pollution. Developing high performance rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is one of the most promising solutions to address the drastic increase in the global demand for energy.1 At present, commercial LIBs using graphite as an anode material have been widely employed in portable electronic devices. However, because of their low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1 and low rate performance,2 they cannot meet the requirements for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles which need LIBs with a combination of high energy density, high power density and high safety. Therefore, it is imperative to explore new anode materials and novel designs for fabricating LIBs with higher energy density, higher rate performance, lower cost, flexibility, non-toxicity, and better cycling stability.3
Carbon nano-onions (CNOs), as one of the carbon allotropes, are composed of multilayered concentric graphitic shells. The size of CNOs usually distributed in the range of 3–100 nm (ref. 4) depending on the synthesis method used. CNOs can be classified into two types, including hollow CNOs and core–shell structured CNOs. Hollow CNOs are spherical or polyhedral in shape. Generally speaking, the innermost layer of the spherical hollow CNO is a C60 cage. The inner space of the polyhedral CNO is usually much larger than a C60 cage in volume though sometimes they are similar. A core–shell structured CNO, in which transition metal oxides (TMOs),5 transition metal (TM),6 alloy nanoparticles,6 or nanodiamonds (NDs)7 are the core encapsulated by an onion-like carbon shell, is usually quasi-spherical in shape. Because of their small size and unique onion-like carbon structure, CNOs display fascinating physicochemical properties, such as a large specific surface area (SSA),8,9 high electrical conductivity9 and outstanding mechanical and electrochemical performances.10,11 The integrated features imply that they have broad prospects in applications such as in electrode material for energy storage and energy conversion devices, such as LIBs,12,13 electrochemical capacitors,14 hydrogen (H2) storage devices,6,15 fuel cells,16 and dye-sensitized solar cells.17,18 Thus, an upsurge of research interest and research activity on the application of CNOs as electrode materials in energy fields has been generated recently.
Recent research indicates that electrodes composed of CNOs display excellent performance as anodes in LIBs.12,13,19 Compared to graphite, the advantages of using spherical CNOs as anodes for LIBs can be summarized as: (i) a CNO has an isotropic surface because of its quasi-spherical structure in conjunction with a large SSA (300–600 m2 g−1) resulting in a much greater contact area between the active material and the electrolyte, which contributes to the fast accessibility of the lithium (Li) ions through the electrolyte from all directions,20 (ii) CNOs possess a high electricity conductivity that facilitates fast transport of Li ions and electrons,20 (iii) the spherical nanostructures are more structurally stable than sheet-like nanostructures.21,22 Thus, spherical CNOs should be more stable when compared to layered graphite, and could accommodate a much greater volume expansion as well as lowering the mechanical strain during Li ion insertion, thus slowing down the pulverization of the nanostructure.23 However, there are still many issues and challenges to overcome: (i) most of the methods for preparing CNOs are of low yield. Nevertheless, achieving the macro preparation of CNOs is the key to promoting their industrialization as an electrode material. (ii) High performance carbon-based anode materials for LIBs should have characteristics such as a large SSA, porous structure and high degree of graphitization. However, CNOs suffer severe agglomeration because of their nano-scale grain size, leading to a decreased SSA. In addition, CNOs have a lack of porous structure because of their closed, concentric graphite shells and CNOs prepared by most of methods possess a low degree of graphitization. In this review, the macro fabrication methods of CNOs are discussed first, and this includes traditional and emerging methods developed in recent years. The size, structure, degree of graphitization, and defects of CNOs, which play vital roles in determining the performance of CNOs and CNO-based hybrid anodes for LIBs, are associated with not only synthesis methods but also synthesis parameters. Therefore, the properties of CNOs prepared by traditional large-scale synthesis methods under different synthesis parameters are reviewed in detail. The characteristics of emerging methods for fabricating CNOs are also evaluated briefly. Compared to the pristine carbonaceous materials, such as carbon nano-tubes (CNTs), carbon fibers, spherical carbon and graphene, functionalized carbonaceous materials demonstrate improved electrode performance,2,24–27 because of one or more of the following reasons, i.e., enhanced SSA, introduction of porous structure, increased electrical conductivity and so on. To obtain improved electrochemical performance of CNOs or CNO-based composite materials as an anode for LIBs, the functionalization of CNOs is essential. Thus, the functionalization of CNOs, involving physical/chemical activation and heteroatom-doping, is introduced later in this review. This review is also devoted to giving an overview of the application of CNOs and CNO-based hybrid structure anodes as anode materials for LIBs. Finally, the perspectives for future research on large-scale preparation are outlined and two directions for research on the design of high performance anodes based on CNOs for LIBs are proposed.
2. Large-scale preparation of CNOs
Since they were first discovered by Ugarte in 1992,28 many techniques have been used to prepare CNOs, including arc discharge,29 arc discharge under water,30,31 electron-beam radiation,32 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),33 mechanical milling,34 carbon ion implantation,35 ND annealing in a vacuum36 or inert gases,7 laser irradiation,37,38 direct plasma treatment of coal,39 heating carbon in a liquid alcohol,40 microwave irradiation,41 and thermolysis.42 Most of the previously mentioned methods require high energy input, and sometimes a number of undesired by-products are produced simultaneously. The low yield is another obstacle which needs to be overcome urgently to satisfy ever-growing demands in the areas of research and application. In this review, traditional and emerging methods for massive synthesis of CNOs are discussed. The characteristics of CNOs synthesized with these methods are summarized systematically.
2.1 Arc discharge in water (ADIW-CNOs)
Arc discharge is a traditional method for synthesizing fullerenes in bulk. CNOs could also be prepared in the same way. However, CNOs obtained from arc discharge inevitably contain a number of carbonaceous impurities such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, amorphous carbon, graphitic debris, CNTs, and CNT-like structures.43 Carbonaceous impurities originate mainly for two reasons. One is because of the uncontrolled formation of other nanostructures in the plasma and the other is because of the incomplete vaporization of graphitic particles dislodged from the graphite rods.43 Thus, it is necessary to implement a time consuming and costly purification process in order to obtain high purity CNOs for practical application. In 2001, Sano et al. reported a preparation method of CNOs (3 mg min−1) using an arc discharge in deionized water.30 Afterwards, they proposed the formation mechanism, as is shown in Fig. 1. A plasma zone forms between two graphitic electrodes and is surrounded by a gas bubble (Fig. 1a) resulting from vaporization of the surrounding liquid because the arc temperature reaches nearly 4000 K (Fig. 1d). The cold zone of the gas bubble could be categorized into two parts (Fig. 1b). Zone I possesses an ion current but zone II does not (Fig. 1c). Elongated structures such as CNTs tend to be produced in zone I because of their epitaxial growth in the carbon ion current. However, three-dimensional isotropic growth of CNOs is preferable because of the absence of an axis of symmetry for the carbon source in zone II (Fig. 1b). Compared with the conventional gas arc method, liquid arc discharge is more economical because it does not require expensive vacuum equipment and additional purification steps. ADIW-CNOs could float on the surface of water and tend to segregate from by-products naturally. Remarkably, ADIW-CNOs have a high degree of graphitization in combination with a large SSA reaching up to 984 m2 g−1,44 which indicates a superior electric conductivity and adsorption ability. These characteristics of ADIW-CNOs are helpful for the fast transport of electrons and Li ions by lowing the transfer resistance.

(a) Relative electric field strength, shown by arrows, between a rod anode (17 V) and a flat cathode (ground) in a gas bubble surrounded by water. (b) Direction of thermal expansion from plasma to the water interface. (c) Qualitative ion density distribution. (d) Temperature gradient – the formation of elongated nanoparticles in zone (I) and onions in zone (II) is also shown schematically.44 
The structure and properties of ADIW-CNOs could be affected by the grade of graphitic anode, types of arc discharge, the applied arc power and so on. ADIW-CNOs, prepared with a low grade graphite anode which could generate an unstable plasma region, possess lots of structure defects.45 Compared to direct current arc discharge, a pulsed arc discharge displays more advantages in synthesizing CNOs, such as a higher production rate, better purity and better dispersibility.46 The ADIW-CNOs prepared at a low arc power contain highly disordered amorphous carbon impurities whereas graphite impurities appear at a high arc power.43 Thus, it is important to optimize arc power for synthesizing ADIW-CNOs with fewer impurities and a narrower size distribution. CNOs with different structures, such as spherical,44 polyhedral 47and core–shell structured, could be made using arc discharge in a liquid arc.48 Core–shell structured CNOs, the core of which are transition metals, could be converted to TMOs encapsulated in onion-like carbon shells by oxidation in air, and these have demonstrated great potential as high performance anode materials for LIBs.5,49
2.2 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD-CNOs)
CVD is a simple, inexpensive, and controlled method for synthesizing CNOs in large quantities. The yield rate is up to 16.7 mg min−1.50 In the CVD process, hydrocarbons, such as methane (CH4)51–54 and acetylene (C2H2),55–57 are usually utilized as carbon sources. CNOs are synthesized via a catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon with the aid of catalysts with a temperature ranging from 400 °C to 850 °C. There are two kinds of CNOs prepared using CVD, core–shell structured CNOs and hollow CNOs. The growth mechanisms of vapor–solid (VS) and vapor–liquid (VL) are responsible for producing core–shell structured CNOs and hollow CNOs, respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 2.58
 Fig. 2  Illustration of growth processes of the carbon onion. (a) VS mechanism for nickel (Ni) encapsulated CNOs. (b) VL mechanism for hollow CNOs.58 
The structure and morphology of CNOs can be tuned using many different means, including reaction temperature, growth time, carrier gas and type of catalyst. At a low temperature, the catalytic activity of catalysts is rather low. As a result, amorphous carbon is the main product accompanying the generation of a small part of core–shell structured CNOs with TM as cores at a low synthesis temperature. The rate of production of TM encapsulated CNOs increases whereas the amount of amorphous carbon decreases at a higher temperature for enhanced catalytic activity of catalysts. By further increasing the reaction temperature, high purity and highly crystallized CNOs with a hollow core could be obtained with the evaporation of the catalyst from the interior of CNOs.54 CNTs are formed preferentially at a much higher temperature.33,54,59,60 The rate of production is also associated with growth time. In the initial stage (1–1.5 h), the yield of CNOs increases rapidly but increases slowly afterwards (1.5–3 h) and this is caused by the decreased catalytic activity of the catalyst.47 The gas carrier also plays an important role in fabricating CNOs. Nitrogen (N2)52,53,61 H2 (ref. 54) and argon (Ar)55,57 are the conventional gases used for transferring carbon resource. With the help of N2, CNOs could be synthesized more easily because it can reduce the strain energy required for the production of the spherical graphitic layers of CNOs and thus decreases the activation energy for the nucleation of the graphitic layers on the catalyst surface as well as the structural evolution of CNOs during growth.61 However, the yield of CNOs becomes lower when using H2 as carrier gas54 because H2 has some erosive effects on the formation of the graphite layers.62 Catalysts can be categorized into floating catalysts and supported catalysts.63 It could generate CNT impurities when using a floating catalyst for synthesizing CNOs with CVD.64 A supported catalyst, which is usually loaded on a substrate (catalyst support) to facilitate the dispersed production of CNOs and to minimize the formation of amorphous carbon,33 is a more appropriate choice for preparing CNOs. Generally speaking, an extra purification procedure is essential to separate CNOs from the catalyst support in order to obtain pure CNOs. In order to simplify the fabrication process, Yang et al.63 successfully prepared CNOs using CVD with an iron (Fe) catalyst supported on sodium chloride (NaCl). Soluble NaCl could be removed by just a washing process. In addition, Zhang et al.33 reported an efficient synthesis of CNOs using CVD with an unsupported Ni–Fe alloy catalyst. Supported catalysts involve TMs (cobalt (Co), Fe, Ni, and so on) and bimetallic alloy (Ni–Fe,6 Ni–aluminium,58,65 and so on). The type of supported catalyst used plays a vital role in controlling the structure and properties of CNOs in CVD synthesis. It is reported that Fe is favorable for the synthesis of high quality CNOs whereas Fe0.64Ni0.36 alloy is preferable for preparing pure CNOs, and the thickness of CNOs fabricated using Ni as a catalyst could be adjusted by altering the catalyst content.6
2.3 ND annealing in a vacuum or in inert gases (ND-CNOs)
Kuznetsov first reported the fabrication of CNOs by annealing NDs in a vacuum and described the corresponding growth mechanism.66 This method has lots of advantages for the production of CNOs, such as high yield, high purity, narrow size distribution and it is easy to control. Detonation NDs with an average size of 5 nm are usually used as the raw material. The transformation process from NDs to CNOs can be described as follows.67 Discontinuous graphite fragments are first formed on the surface of the NDs, and then they link together to eliminate the dangling bonds resulting from the formation of the closed graphite shells. The inner diamond core sustained the initial shape which gradually diminishes in the course of further graphitization. Finally, CNOs composed of concentric graphitic layers are evolved and these are similar to the original NDs in shape (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of CNOs synthesized by ND annealing in an Ar atmosphere.67 
Temperature, holding time, annealing atmosphere, and the size of the NDs are critical factors that determine the structure and properties of CNOs prepared using annealing of NDs. The onset temperature for graphitization is typically in the range between 700 and 1100 °C, but this varies as a function of atmospheres used, heating rates, and type of ND material.68 At elevated temperatures for a short time, the products are mainly composed of bucky-diamonds with a nanoscale diamond core encapsulated in graphite shells. Spherical CNOs could be obtained at temperatures higher than 1600 °C when annealing in a vacuum.69,70 At higher temperatures, usually more than 1900 °C, polyhedral CNOs are formed.69 Spherical CNOs could also be formed at a temperature lower than 1600 °C by prolonging the holding time because there was an enhanced degree of graphitization with increasing holding time. As well as annealing in vacuum, Ar,7,71 helium (He),72 and N2 (ref. 73) are commonly used as annealing atmospheres for preparing CNOs. The phase-transition temperatures of NDs → bucky diamonds → spherical CNOs → polyhedral CNOs in an inert atmosphere are much lower than those of annealing in a vacuum. For example, the temperature for synthesizing polyhedral CNOs in an Ar atmosphere is about 1600 °C (ref. 71) which is decreased by 300 °C when compared to the synthesis of polyhedral CNOs in a vacuum. The reason for this could be that different synthesis atmospheres may also differ in the amount of gases containing reactive oxygen (O2) from the atmosphere or desorbed from the precursor.68 Oxygen containing active gases are helpful in accelerating the onset of graphitization and increase the graphitization rate. It is remarkable that ribbon-like nanographite and layered graphite usually appear as the by-products or the main products at high temperatures in an Ar atmosphere because of the carbon redistribution processes with the aid of H- and O-containing gases.74,75 The graphitization temperature of NDs with a small size is reduced when compared to that of large ones arising from both a higher surface free energy and much more absorbed active gases on the surface of small-sized NDs.76 Thus, CNOs derived from annealing small NDs could be fabricated at a milder temperature in the same annealing atmosphere compared to using large NDs as precursors.
2.4 Emerging synthesis methods for fabricating CNOs in a large quantity
In addition to traditional methods mentioned previously, some new synthesis methods have been proposed for massive synthesis of CNOs in recent years. A general review of these methods is given in chronological order, next.
Hou et al.77 reported a synthesis method for high purity CNOs in counterflow diffusion flames. High yield CNOs could be acquired by altering the oxygen content in the lower flow and the fuel content in the upper flow. The product is affected by many factors, including oxygen content, and types and proportions of fuel. It is complicated to control the bulk synthesis of CNOs with high purity using this method. Bystrzejewski et al.42 demonstrated a thermolysis route using a sodium azide (NaN3)–divinyl acetylene (C6Cl6) mixture as a precursor for fabricating gram-scale CNOs (30–100 nm in diameter). Although the preparation process was free of catalyst, the products were composed of undesirable by-products, such as amorphous carbon nanoparticles and NaCl. As a result, additional purification processes were necessary to obtain pure CNOs. Han et al.12 prepared CNOs in bulk using a simple, effective and economical method via the reaction between calcium carbide (CaC2) and copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O) at 600 °C. The CNOs obtained were of quasi-spherical structure, with a high purity, and a uniform size of about 30 nm and a SSA of 101 m2 g−1. However, this approach requires a long preparation period up to 10 h and the products have a large average grain size of 35 nm. Choucair and Stride78 fabricated pure and defective CNOs with an average grain size of 50 nm in a large quantity by combustion of naphthalene. This required a two-step synthesis, which led to much inconvenience. Additionally, Dubey et al.79 presented a simple method for gram-scale synthesis of CNOs by burning common carbon rich sources such as camphor and polystyrene foam. These carbon resources being a plant product or a solid waste, respectively, could be readily obtained. The CNOs obtained had a size distribution of 5–20 nm and had a low degree of graphitization as well as large numbers of structural defects. Fig. 4 shows high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CNOs synthesized by the previously mentioned new methods.

3. Functionalization of CNOs
The SSA, porous structure, and degree of graphitization are crucial to the performance of CNOs and CNO-based anodes. Thus, surface modification or/and structure modification using functionalization involving physical activation, chemical activation and heteroatom-doping is/are necessary for fabricating high performance anodes for LIBs. In the following section, the recent progress on related research will be discussed.
3.1 Physical/chemical activation
Physical activation by oxidation in active gases [air,80 carbon dioxide (CO2)72 or ozone81], as well as chemical activation in acid or alkali are commonly used methods to modify the surface of CNOs. From Table 1, it can be seen that the SSA of CNOs increases with increasing holding time (No. 1, 2 and 3). The largest SSA could reach up to 642 m2 g−1, corresponding to a growth rate of 88.9%, for CNOs after oxidation at 570 °C for 1 h in air. Meanwhile, the pore volume of No. 3 in Table 1 increased by 36.4%, from 1.1 cm3 g−1 to 1.5 cm3 g−1, when compared to the pristine CNOs.76 In contrast to oxidation in air at 450 °C for 1 h, CNO oxidation in CO2 for the same time even at a high temperature (750 °C) showed a much lower SSA (581 and 399 m2 g−1 for No. 4 and No. 5 in Table 1, respectively), indicating that the air atmosphere has a much stronger activity for oxidizing CNOs. It is worth noting that both the D band and the G band in the Raman spectra decrease or the ratio of the D band and the G band (ID/IG) decreases (No. 3 and No. 6 in Table 1, respectively) after oxidation in air, implying an enhanced degree of graphitization. The increased SSA and improved degree of graphitization result from removing the amorphous carbon from the necks between the CNO particles and a few outer shells of the CNOs. Additionally, the pore volume of the CNOs could also increase after oxidation in air. In other words, the SSA, degree of graphitization, and pore volume were enhanced after physical activation by oxidation in active gases, which is crucial for preparing high performance CNO anodes for LIBs.

Chemical activation of CNOs by oxidizing reagents [nitric acid (HNO3),79,83 HNO3 and sulfuric acid (H2SO4)84] could introduce oxygen containing groups on the surface of the CNOs. The agglomeration of the CNOs could be alleviated by the introduction of polar surface groups, resulting in an increased SSA. The oxygen content of CNOs derived from ND annealing in Ar is very low, only 0.3 at%, but this could increase to 16.4 at% after oxidation in mixed acid (H2SO4/HNO3, 3:1 v/v) according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis.84 The increased oxygen content could be attributed to the introduction of surface oxygen containing groups, such as carboxyl groups (COOR), hydroxyl groups (C–O), and carbonyl groups (CO), which are created by oxidation in mixed acid. As a result, both SSA (changing from 384 to 578 m2 g−1, corresponding to a growth rate of 50.5%) and pore volume of oxidized CNOs increases. Compared with acid and mixed acid, potassium hydroxide (KOH) shows a stronger activity for CNOs. After activation using 6 mol L−1 KOH solution, the SSA of CNOs increases from 450 to 804 m2 g−1, corresponding to a growth rate of 78.7%. Additionally, the pore volume of CNOs also increases by 60% (from 0.80 to 1.28 cm3 g−1).14 The increased number of pores, including both micropores and mesopores, and the SSA of micropore has the maximum value of 200 m2 g−1 when 6 mol L−1 KOH was used to activate the CNOs. In addition, surface hydrophilicity of CNOs also improves after activation using KOH. Palkar et al.83 found that small N–CNOs are much easier to oxidize compared to large CNOs obtained from arc discharge because of more defects and a smaller size for the former.
3.2 Doping
Heteroatom doping is an effective way to tune intrinsic electronic characteristics, and surface and local chemical features of CNOs, such as introducing more defective sites, enhancing electric conductivity and introducing surface functional groups, which are helpful for improving the performances of CNO anodes for LIBs. Doping content of the heteroatom in CNOs is related to doping methods, doping source, and temperature. Post doping treatment and in situ doping are typical methods adopted for heteroatom doping. Compared to post doping, in situ doping is simpler because heteroatom doped CNOs could be obtained by a one-pot synthesis whereas post doping is a multiple step process. Nitrogen atoms16,85–90 are easy to insert inside CNOs because of their similar size to the carbon atom. Kim et al.89 presented a one-step synthesis of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) CNOs using a plasma discharge in the presence of ammonia and found that the nitrogen content was enhanced with an increase in ammonia concentration, reaching up to 1.7 at% when 5 M ammonia was used as nitrogen source. N-doped magnetic CNOs with a nitrogen content of 4.5 wt% could be synthesized in situ by pyrolyzing a hexamethylenediamine–Me (Me: Co and Fe) complex.16 Lin et al.86 fabricated N-doped CNOs with a post doping method with heat treatment using oxidized CNOs, and ammonia (NH3) as raw material and nitrogen source, respectively. The N content increased with increasing annealing temperature, achieving 3.95 at% at 550 °C. Further enhancement of the annealing temperature to 750 °C resulted in a decreased content of only 2.06 at%.86 It is worth noting that if N-doped CNOs were fabricated using post-treatment in an NH3 atmosphere with pristine CNOs without preoxidation, the degree of N-doping was lower than that using preoxidized CNOs in HNO3 as the raw material. The result indicates that the nitrogen sources may react with some oxygen species by a series of chemical reactions to form nitrogen species during the synthetic process, such as nucleophilic addition.87
Boron atoms are another commonly used heteroatom that could be incorporated into CNOs because they have a comparable atomic size and three valence electrons for binding with carbon atoms.91 The B–C bond formed is longer than the C–C bond, leading to the chemical disorder of graphite layers, and p-type doped carbon materials are obtained.92 In the existing reports, boron-doped (B-doped) CNOs are all in situ synthesized by annealing a mixture of NDs and boric acid (H3BO3).91,93,94 The boron content reduced from 1.0 at% to 0.63 at% with an increasing annealing temperature between 1500 °C and 2400 °C using boron sources containing the same amount (5 wt%).91 However, the boron content increased with increase in the content of the boron source in the range of 5–30 wt%, reaching the maximum value of 5.52 at% when the amount of the boron source was 30 wt%.94 Electrical conductivity of B-doped CNOs improved compared to the pristine ones and could reach its maximum value when the boron source content was 10 wt%. Further increasing the amount of the boron source to 20 wt% resulted in the degradation of electrical conductivity because of the increased structural defects caused by the high doping level.91 In contrast to boron doped CNTs, boron could be doped in CNOs much easier because the CNOs possess a much less well ordered surface structure.93 The pore size distribution and pore volume cannot be changed after boron doping.94 It seems that B-doped CNO anodes for LIBs may display a larger specific capacity, enhanced cycling stability and rate performance compared to undoped CNOs because of the introduction of structural defects and improved electrical conductivity.
4. Application as anode materials for LIBs
4.1 Hollow CNOs used as anode materials for LIBs
Generally speaking, the anode fabricated with low graphitized CNOs have a large number of defects, displaying a specific capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 at a low discharge current (0.1C) which is a little larger than the theoretical specific capacity of graphite (Fig. 5a and b). The enhanced specific capacity could be attributed to defects (such as discontinuous graphite shells), amorphous carbon and cavities, nanopores.12,13 However, the specific capacity degraded rapidly, delivering a specific capacity of about 150 mA h g−1 at a rate of 2C (Fig. 5b). This could be attributed to a larger electrode polarization at a higher charge/discharge current. In contrast to defective CNOs, perfect CNOs with a low defect density, especially when lacking a porous structure in onion-like carbon shells, show an inferior specific capacity but an enhanced rate capacity (Fig. 5c). It is worth noting that graphitized hollow CNOs with a porous structure demonstrate simultaneously a large specific capacity, good cycling stability (470 mA h g−1 after 430 cycles at a discharge of 200 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 5e) and rate performance (Fig. 5d). Their porous structure, high degree of graphitization and hollow structure could lower diffusion resistance of Li ions, lower transfer resistance of electrons and decrease the diffusion path of Li ions, respectively, contributing to a better rate performance. The hollow structure could accommodate more volume change resulting in a higher cycling stability.95 The increased specific capacity could be attributed to the porous structure which can give many more Li-ion storage sites.95 Table 2 shows the specific capacities of porous CNOs and other porous carbonaceous material.

4.2 CNO-based hybrid materials and core–shell structured CNOs used as an anode for LIBs
Compared to carbonaceous material, TMOs have much higher theoretical specific capacities, ranging between 600 and 1200 mA h g−1, as can be seen in Fig. 6. However, their low electrical conductivity and severe volume change during lithiation/delithiation processes results in degraded rate capability and poor cycling performance, which hamper their application as high performance LIBs.
 Fig. 6  The theoretical capacities of different TMOs. 
To circumvent the previously mentioned problems, CNO-based hybrid anodes and core–shell structured CNOs have been developed. One way is to fabricate nano-structured TMO supported on CNOs (TMO/CNOs) hybrid anode. The other strategy is to construct core–shell structured CNOs anodes, in which a nano-structured TMO is encapsulated in the shells of CNOs (TMO@CNOs).
Compared to the nano-structured TMO, the TMO/CNOs hybrid anode possesses better conductivity and could alleviative the volume change of TMO during the charge/discharge processes resulting from the buffer action of CNOs. In addition to acting as the buffer layer for the TMO, CNOs are also one part of the active material that could contribute to increase the specific capacity. It can be seen that both cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4)/CNOs and manganese dioxide (MnO2)/CNOs show larger specific capacities, about 3–4 times more than that of pristine Co3O4 and MnO2 at the same discharge current, respectively, (Fig. 7c and e). This could be attributed to a high loading of the electrochemically active TMOs and an enhanced SSA of TMO/CNOs compared to pristine nano-structured TMOs. In order to achieve a large specific capacity, a high loading of the electrochemically active TMO is necessary. Thus, CNOs should possess a large SSA. The size and morphology of TMO supported on CNOs are key factors that could determine the total SSA of the TMO/CNO composite material. The large SSA of TMO/CNO is another key reason which contributes to the enhanced specific capacity of the TMO/CNO anode which is obtained. With the aid of the CNOs, the cycling stability and rate performance of the TMO/CNOs are obviously improved in contrast to the pristine nano-structured TMOs (Fig. 7c–f).

(c) Cyclic performance of the Co3O4/CNO, pristine Co3O4, Co3O4 and CNOs physical mixture electrodes at a current density of 200 mA g−1.

(f) Rate capabilities of the pure MnO2, pure CNO, and MnO2/CNO electrodes.3,20 
In the same way as TMO/CNO, core–shell structured TMO@CNO anodes also demonstrate an enhanced reversible capacity, cycling stability and rate performance because of their unique structure. As can be seen in Table 3, in the TMO@CNO anodes, nano-structured TMOs act as the main active material. The carbon shells of CNOs serve four main roles: (i) acting as the secondary active material, the carbon shells could contribute to the total capacity of the composite structure; (ii) serving as the structural stabilizer, CNO carbon shells could maintain the integrity of the electrode during the lithiation/delithiation processes by alleviating the large volume change, suppressing the aggregation, and avoiding the pulverization of TMO; (iii) used as the interfacial stabilizer, the carbon shells could prevent the direct exposure of TMO nanoparticles to the electrolyte, and thus form a stable electrode–electrolyte interphase; (iv) the carbon shells with a porous structure provide fast and efficient transport of Li ions, and thus significantly enhance the rate capability.

In addition to TMO@CNOs, core–shell structured CNOs using transition metal dichaldogenides (TMDs), tin (Sn)-based intermetallic alloy, Sn or tin dioxide (SnO2) as cores also display excellent electrode performances as anodes for LIBs, as are also shown in Table 3.
It is worth mentioning the work of He et al.,19 who fabricated onion-like carbon-encapsulated iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles embedded in two-dimensional (2D) porous graphitic carbon nanosheets (Fe3O4@CNO@PGC) using a simple and scalable in situ synthesis method with the aid of the surface of water-soluble NaCl particles (Fig. 8a). In this unique hybrid nanostructure, the thin onion-like carbon shells can inhibit the direct exposure of encapsulated Fe3O4 to the electrolyte resulting in the structural and interfacial stabilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Simultaneously, the mechanical stress induced by the volume variation of embedded Fe3O4@CNO nanoparticles could be adjusted by the flexible and conductive PGC nanosheets, and the aggregation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles could also be avoided. As a result, the structural and electrical integrity of the Fe3O4@CNO@PGC electrode were preserved during the charge/discharge processes. This Fe3O4@CNO@PGC electrode delivered super high rate capability and outstanding cycling performance at high rates (Fig. 8b), which is the best one ever reported for a Fe3O4-based electrode for LIBs including diverse nano-structured Fe3O4 anode materials, composite electrodes, and so on.

5. Conclusions and future outlook
In summary, high yield synthesis methods of CNOs are introduced, including traditional methods and methods newly developed in recent years. The effect of various process parameters on the CNOs synthesized via traditional preparation methods is summarized in detail. The characteristics of CNOs prepared by the newly developed methods are described briefly. Although many efforts have been devoted to synthesizing CNOs, achieving large-scale synthesis of CNOs with high purity, low power output, controlled size and structure is still a challenge.
Physical/chemical activation could increase the SSA of CNOs, improve the degree of graphitization, and introduce a porous structure, which would contribute to an enhanced electrochemical performance of the CNO anode for LIBs. Heteroatom-doping could elevate the electrical conductivity and introduce a certain number of defects, which are also beneficial for improving the performance of the CNOs anode for LIBs. Unfortunately, the research on functionalized CNOs as anodes for LIBs are lacking at present.
Hollow CNOs exhibit a comparable, or an even larger specific capacity at a low discharge current in comparison with commercialized graphite. However, the capacity cannot be improved because of their low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1. In order to fabricate high performance anodes for LIBs, two main research directions need to be developed:
(i) Fabrication of highly graphitized and doped hollow CNOs with porous structure as anodes for LIBs.
(ii) Design of an CNO-based hybrid structured electrode, such as TMO/CNO and core–shell structured CNO in which the core should possess a high theoretical capacity.
Many challenges remain, such as achieving large-scale synthesis of CNOs and CNO-based hybrid materials using a simple method, designing new types of CNO-based anodes, and exploring new electrolytes which are appropriate for charging/discharging at a high current density. However, there is no doubt that CNOs and CNO-based hybrid anodes will be one of the best candidates for high performance LIBs.
