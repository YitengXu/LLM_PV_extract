    , Accepted 19th November 2019First published on 20th November 2019AbstractNovel 2D porous MnIn2Se4 nanosheet photocatalysts have been synthesized for the first time via a simple hydrothermal method, which exhibit promising activity for photocatalytic water splitting without any sacrificial agent due to their large specific surface area, 2D layered morphology, porous structure and suitable energy gap.
Hydrogen, one of the most important clean and renewable energy sources, has been a hot research issue related to the efforts of sustainably powering the globe.1,2 Photocatalytic water splitting by using solar energy is one of the most promising ways to obtain the resource. Despite considerable progress in photocatalytic research in recent years, the reported photocatalysts still have relatively low optical conversion efficiency, which is far below the practical application.3 Moreover, most of the photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions require the presence of sacrificial agents, but the consumption of sacrificial agents is also a major obstacle to the practical application of photocatalysis, and it is difficult to clearly explain the mechanism of sacrificial agents.4,5 In other words, H2 evolution occurs at the expense of the consumption of electron sacrificial agents.6 Consequently, it is imminent to develop some new photocatalysts with higher separation and transport efficiency of charge carriers, so that they can be highly active in photocatalytic water splitting without electronic sacrificial agents.
Since graphene was reported in 2004, 2D materials have become the focus in the research of nanomaterials because of their scientific and engineering significance.7 In recent years, 2D materials have been extensively studied and used in various proof-of-concept devices due to their interesting surface and electronic properties.8 In particular with the advantages of high specific surface area, immensely exposed active surface sites and shorter diffusion length of charge carriers, 2D layered materials are considered as new stars in the field of catalysis for the H2 evolution reaction materials. For example, metal chalcogenides with 2D geometric structures are of great significance in promoting photocatalytic water splitting as photocatalysts (such as In2Se3,9 ZnSe,10 ZnIn2S4,11–13 and CdIn2S414). Furthermore, transition-metal chalcogenides (TMDs) possess rich chemistry and numerous strategies that allow tuning their electronic properties, which make these materials very attractive for understanding the basic principles of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.8,15 These also provide particularly interesting research for developing highly efficient, renewable, and affordable photocatalysts for large-scale production of H2.
In general, the presence of a transition metal, chalcogen, and the 2D feature as an integral part of the photocatalysts can enable highly efficient catalysis. In this aspect, the ternary transition metal chalcogenide with a formula of MnIn2Se4 is a good candidate, which possesses a layered structure with weak van der Waals forces between the layers. MnIn2Se4 is a direct band gap semiconductor with energy gap Eg between 1.55 and 1.85 eV at room temperature.16,17 Despite its suitable band gap, MnIn2Se4 has received less attention mainly due to the lack of an effective synthetic pathway, which subsequently limits its application in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.
Herein, for the first time, we prepared novel 2D transition metal chalcogenide MnIn2Se4 nanosheets with porous structure by a simple hydrothermal method (Fig. S1, ESI†). Interestingly, the synthesized porous nanosheets are demonstrated to be used in unassisted photocatalysis for H2 generation in pure water without any sacrificial agent under the irradiation of a Xe lamp. In this experiment, the intrinsic property of the hitherto unexplored MnIn2Se4 for photocatalytic water splitting was clearly studied. The satisfactory performance of MnIn2Se4 is tightly connected with the 2D layered porous structure, which leads to a larger specific surface area, more exposed active sites, and shorter migration distances of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, CoSeO3 was firstly used as a cocatalyst to further improve the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets. Being the first experimental report on the catalytic property of MnIn2Se4 with a facile synthesis method, our finding could serve as an important cornerstone in pursuit of performance enhancement and further exploration of other 2D TMD materials in this emerging family.
Typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MnIn2Se4 based on the obtained sample powder are indexed to PDF#80-1859 (Fig. 1a). The crystal structure of MnIn2Se4 shows that the correct space group is R3m with hexagonal lattice parameters a = 0.4051 nm and c = 3.946 nm as shown in Fig. 1b. The centrosymmetric unit cell is built up from twelve nearly closed-packed selenium layers (large circles). The cation sites are in the tetrahedral and octahedral voids between these layers.

Furthermore, the surface chemical states of the synthesized MnIn2Se4 were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 1c shows the typical XPS survey scan of MnIn2Se4, indicating the presence of Mn, In, and Se and the signals of carbon and oxygen as well. The Se 3d spectrum (Fig. 1d) of the MnIn2Se4 nanosheet exhibits two peaks at 54.0 and 54.9 eV, which correspond to the binding states of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 with a peak separation of 0.9 eV. This is a typical value for metal selenides.18 As displayed in Fig. 1e, the Mn 2p3/2 spectrum features of the MnIn2Se4 samples with two main spin–orbit lines are observed at 641.1 eV and 642.6 eV, which are separately regarded as the characteristics of Mn2+ and Mn3+ cations, respectively.19 The In 3d spectrum of the MnIn2Se4 sample in Fig. 1f presents two strong peaks at 444.7 and 452.3 eV, which are attributed to the binding states of In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 with a spin–orbit split separation of 7.6 eV, assigned to the In–Se bond.20
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2a) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2b and c) show that MnIn2Se4 mainly consists of well-shaped 2D nanosheets with porous structures. As seen from atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis, the thickness of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets is measured to be about 50 nm (Fig. 2g). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are used to further study the morphology and crystallographic information. Fig. 2d displays the HRTEM image of MnIn2Se4, which demonstrates a legible crystal fringe with a lattice spacing of 0.324 nm, corresponding to (104) crystal planes. A clear pore structure can be observed in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2d), which is also demonstrated in Fig. 2e. The pores are randomly distributed in the nanosheets and the sizes of the pores vary from 5 to 100 nm, which is consistent with the result of BET. The corresponding SAED pattern is shown in Fig. 2f where the visible diffraction spots are clear confirming the existence of the characteristic plane for hexagonal MnIn2Se4 (PDF#80-1859). Furthermore, Fig. 2h exhibits the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX)-elemental analysis of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets, which unequivocally reveals the uniform distribution of the components in MnIn2Se4. In addition, TEM images of MnIn2Se4 with different reaction times are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It can be clearly observed that when the reaction time is 60 min, a layered structure has been formed, and the porous structure gradually forms with the increase of reaction time. When the reaction time reached 20 h, uniform porous MnIn2Se4 nanosheets were formed. Moreover, the formation of porous structures is closely related to the volume of hydrazine hydrate added in the synthesis process (Fig. S3, ESI†).

In order to understand the light-harvesting capability of the as-prepared sample, we studied its optical properties by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra. The Tauc plot shows that the bandgap of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets is about 1.99 eV (Fig. 3a), which is consistent with the reported research.16 Furthermore, for determining the specific energy levels, the absolute position of the VB is obtained by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The VB levels of MnIn2Se4 can be calculated by subtracting the width of He I UPS spectra from the system excitation energy of 21.22 eV. The VB level of MnIn2Se4 was observed at 0.97 versus normal H2 electrode (NHE) (−5.41 eV vs. vacuum, Fig. 3a). According to the formula ECB = Eg − EVB: the CB energy level of MnIn2Se4 can directly be calculated using the Eg value as −1.02 versus NHE. Additionally, Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were recorded as a supplement to the above energy level calculations, which can also provide information about the type of semiconductor. As displayed in Fig. 3c, the positive tangent slope of M–S indicates that MnIn2Se4 is an n-type semiconductor, which is consistent with previous literature.21 From the result of M–S plots, it can be observed that the flat band potential of MnIn2Se4 is −0.73 V versus NHE. It is generally believed that the conduction band potential (ECB) of an n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than the flat band potential.22 Therefore, it is obvious that the result obtained from the M–S plots is very close to the results calculated from UV-vis and UPS analysis. Fig. 3d exhibits the schematic diagram of the CB and VB position of MnIn2Se4, which meets the thermodynamic requirements of water reduction and oxidation, respectively.

Considering that MnIn2Se4 has a relatively appropriate CB level that was able to convert H+ into H2 gas in the photocatalytic H2 production, we used the prepared MnIn2Se4 nanosheets to drive the catalysis of water splitting. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the H2 evolution rate of MnIn2Se4 in pure water is about 35 μmol g−1 h−1, while that in the presence of sacrificial agents reaches 484 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). This may be due to the fact that the sacrificial agent can consume the photogenerated holes in time, while the photogenerated holes oxidize the adsorbed water molecules to hydroxyl radicals at a relatively slow rate. The photocatalytic stability of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets was further studied and is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). There are negligible drops in the rates of H2 evolution during the continuous test with accumulatively 30 hours, which suggests the excellent stability of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets. Unfortunately, we failed to obtain oxygen content with stoichiometric H2 and O2 (2:1), the possibility is that the photogenerated holes oxidize the adsorbed water molecules to hydroxyl radicals on the catalyst surface, but not completely oxidized to oxygen. In order to understand the photocatalytic mechanism and analyze the oxidation products of water splitting in the system, the electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) technique is conducted to trace surface hydroxyl radicals.6 ESR spectra in Fig. 4g exhibit the characteristic signals of hydroxyl radicals in both MnIn2Se4 and 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 photocatalysts under the illumination of Xe light, which indicates the oxidation of water to produce hydroxyl radicals through one-electron transfer.23 This discovery confirms that the photogenerated holes oxidize the water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts to hydroxyl radicals. This may be due to the lack of sufficient active sites to promote the formation of kinetically sluggish O–O covalent bonds in the oxygen evolution reaction, and the schematics of water splitting of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 4h.24–26

(h) Schematics of water splitting to H2 gas and radical intermediates of oxide moieties revealing that the OER route is incomplete. 
Furthermore, the excellent H2 evolution of MnIn2Se4 is tightly relate to the 2D porous morphology, which can be further demonstrated by the comparison with MnIn2Se4 samples prepared by adding polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) in the synthesis process (the samples are denoted as MnIn2Se4-PVP). The porous structure of MnIn2Se4-PVP samples is relatively insignificant compared to that of MnIn2Se4 (Fig. S6, ESI†). It may be related to the acidity of PVP in ethanol solution, which results in the change in the pH value of the reaction system. The results of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis also confirm this (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†). MnIn2Se4 with obvious porous structures exhibits the best photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution (Fig. S8, ESI†). This is due to the highly porous structure, which gives rise to affluent mass transfer channels and abundant active sites, and shortens the transport distance of carriers (Fig. S9, please find more details in the ESI†).
Moreover, we used CoSeO3 as a cocatalyst for further improving H2 evolution performance. The XRD pattern (Fig. S10, ESI†) of the obtained sample can be well indexed to CoSeO3·2H2O (JCPDS 25-0125). The XRD pattern and TEM and HRTEM images of 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 are shown in Fig. S11–S14 (ESI†). It is apparent from Fig. 4a and b that the distinctly improved H2 evolution rate can be observed in the presence of CoSeO3 as a cocatalyst.
The mechanism of the promoted H2 evolution performance over MnIn2Se4 nanosheets with CoSeO3 as a cocatalyst was further investigated. Firstly, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 4c) display the range of light absorption for 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 which is wider than that of MnIn2Se4, meaning that the absorption of visible light is broader. Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra exhibit that the 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 sample possesses the weakest PL emission compared to MnIn2Se4 nanosheets and other samples (Fig. 4f), indicating the slowest recombination of photogenerated charges in MnIn2Se4 nanosheets with 5 wt% CoSeO3 as a cocatalyst.27 In addition, the photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out to reveal the separation and transportation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
As shown in Fig. 4d, 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 nanosheets exhibit the highest photocurrent, which is remarkably improved compared to that of MnIn2Se4 nanosheets.28 This result further indicates the significantly enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers over 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 nanosheets. Furthermore, the EIS spectrum (Fig. 4e) shows that 5 wt% CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance, corresponding to the rapid separation and transmission of photogenerated charge carriers.22 As shown in Fig. S15d–i (ESI†), it is observed that illumination can effectively motivate the migration of internal electrons and holes. Therefore, all the results show that CoSeO3 as a cocatalyst was effective in strengthening the light absorption, separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, thus resulting in high-efficiency photocatalytic water reduction. (the corresponding mechanism could be found in Fig. S16, ESI†). Moreover, CoSeO3–MnIn2Se4 (Fig. S17, ESI†) exhibits good stability after the photocatalytic process.29,30
In summary, we have designed novel 2D porous MnIn2Se4 nanosheets for H2 evolution from pure water without any sacrificial agents, and the CB and VB levels were firstly detected. Moreover, CoSeO3 was firstly used as a cocatalyst and the H2 evolution rate of MnIn2Se4 was improved to 319 μmol g−1 h−1 by loading 5 wt% CoSeO3 and the corresponding apparent quantum efficiency was 3.77%. Furthermore, MnIn2Se4 nanosheets as photocatalysts can be further studied for overall water splitting. This work could facilitate the follow-up experiments in the emerging family of 2D materials to seek breakthroughs in water splitting catalysis and other optoelectronic devices.
