    , Accepted 2nd July 2018First published on 9th July 2018AbstractRecently, AgBiS2 has been demonstrated to be a promising non-toxic, earth-abundant absorber material for solar energy application. In this work, a novel route to deposit AgBiS2 thin films from single molecular precursor ink is presented. It is found that the amount of thiourea has a crucial impact on the formulation of a stable molecular ink. Understanding the coordination chemistry of the molecular precursor ink is important for getting better control over the thin film processing. With the assistance of Raman spectroscopy, possible complexation mechanisms and general coordination states within the molecular ink are studied. In addition, the influence of ink composition as well as the annealing temperature on the structure and morphology of resulting AgBiS2 films is systematically investigated. It is found that the crystallinity and particle size increase with higher annealing temperature. The obtained AgBiS2 thin films show a cubic structure with a preferred orientation in [111] direction. Optical and electrical measurements demonstrate that the obtained AgBiS2 is an indirect band gap material, which features two transition mechanisms with an indirect band gap of around 0.87 eV and a direct one of around 1.21 eV. The high absorption coefficient, low Urbach energy and fast transient photoconductivity confirm its potential as an absorber for photovoltaic applications.
1. Introduction
Exploring efficient, low-cost and stable new absorber materials is one of the major tasks in future solar energy utilization. Recently, metal halide perovskite harvesters have been intensively investigated and remarkable progress in terms of the conversion efficiency has been achieved. However, the presence of Pb and the intrinsic instability against humidity are two main issues which hinder the mass production of perovskite solar cells. Another kind of light absorbing material is based on Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe),1,2 which is considered as an alternative to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 light harvester. The record efficiency of CZTSSe-based solar cells is 12.6%,1 reported by David B. Mitzi's group in 2013. However, there is no further improvement regarding the cell efficiency in recent years due to the complicated structural and optoelectronic properties of CZTSSe. Moreover, a high temperature2,3 (generally over 500 °C) annealing step is required to obtain high-quality CZTSSe thin film absorbers, indicating higher energy consumption during thin film processing. Therefore, searching for a new absorbing material that can provide high efficiency while processed at lower temperature is still an ongoing task. AgBiS2 belongs to I–III–VI2 material class, it has a suitable bandgap,4,5 exhibits a high absorption coefficient (103 to 105 cm−1 in the visible region),4,6 consists of non-toxic elements and can be processed at lower temperature, which positively impacts fabrication costs. All these features show the potential of AgBiS2 to be utilized as an absorber in solar cells.
In recent years, several groups have already tried to apply AgBiS2 as an active layer in solar cells. For instance, a two-stage sequential ionic adsorption reaction (SILAR) process was reported to grow AgBiS2 nanoparticles on nanoporous TiO2, and corresponding solar cells reached an efficiency of 0.76%.6 In 2016, Konstantatos's group4 reported the synthesis of AgBiS2 colloidal nanoparticles by hot injection method and demonstrated a compelling 6.3% efficiency. Due to limited transport properties, the absorber thickness was just 35 nm. Lately, Huang et al.7 produced 4.3% solar cell with 65 nm thick AgBiS2 absorber based on nanoparticle ink. They developed amine-based synthesis to improve the quality of AgBiS2 nanoparticles, thus enhancing semiconducting properties and cell performance. Simonov et al.8 used spray coating method to fabricate the AgBiS2 absorber and achieved 3.5% efficiency of a solar cell of similar structure.
Different approaches have been applied to synthesize AgBiS2. Apart from high temperature solid state synthesis of AgBiS2 single crystals,9 many low temperature approaches have been explored to fabricate AgBiS2 nanomaterials, such as AgBiS2 nanostructured flowers by solvent thermal method,10 AgBiS2 dendritic crystals by microwave irradiation synthesis,11 AgBiS2 nanoparticles via hot injection,4,7 and sequential ionic layer adsorption reaction.6 All these methods can be classified as a nanoparticle synthesis approach. The general problem of nanoparticle synthesis approach is the batch-to-batch stability of the final composition, and also the need for good passivation methods.4 Meanwhile, it is also challenging to disperse the particles in a certain solvent to form a stable ink used for thin film deposition. Therefore, to avoid the complicated process of nanoparticle approach, an alternative route based on molecular ink is preferred.4 The molecular ink can be formed by mixing metal salts with certain solvent(s). The intermixing of precursors on a molecular level can ensure a good compositional control of the resulting films and can be straightforwardly transferred to printing and coating processing.12 It is reported that certain metal salts can be dissolved in environmentally friendly solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) forming stable molecular inks, which can be used as precursors for the deposition thin films by printing.12–18 For example, H. W. Hillhouse group achieved 11.8% efficiency of a CZTSSe solar cell and 14.7% efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cells based on the corresponding DMSO molecular inks.12
Therefore, in this work, we investigated a single molecular precursor ink route to deposit AgBiS2 thin films with a low temperature (T ≤ 300 °C) process. The molecular ink can be simply formulated by mixing AgNO3, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, thiourea (TU) directly with DMSO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the formation of AgBiS2 thin films using a molecular precursor route. The complexation mechanism among the metal nitrates, thiourea and DMSO is systematically investigated with Raman spectroscopy measurements. The influence of the TU to metal ratio (TU/M) as well as the annealing temperature on the structural and morphological properties are studied. Besides, basic optical and electrical properties are also described.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and ink synthesis
A homogeneous AgBiS2 precursor solution was prepared via a simple Ag–Bi–TU complex synthesis in organic solvent DMSO. Silver nitrate AgNO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9995%), bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Aldrich, 99.999%) and thiourea NH2CSNH2 (Aldrich, ≥99%) were chosen as starting chemicals. Dimethyl sulfoxide (CH3)2SO (Aldrich, ≥99.9%) was used as an organic solvent. To investigate the coordination chemistry, we designed reference solutions, such as pure DMSO, DMSO with 3TU (1TU stands for the concentration of thiourea is 0.13 M), DMSO with AgNO3 or Bi(NO3)3·5H2O. Besides, we also prepared solutions with different concentration of TU. Briefly, AgNO3 (0.26 mmol), Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.26 mmol) and thiourea (various moles from 0 to 2.6 mmol) were dissolved in 2 mL DMSO. The solutions were kept stirring at room temperature inside a glovebox filled with N2 for at least 2 hours and filtered with 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filter before using. Unless stated otherwise, all materials were used as received.
2.2 Preparation of AgBiS2 thin films

Scheme 1 describes the fabrication process of AgBiS2 thin films via Ag–Bi–TU–DMSO molecular ink. Glass substrates were subsequently cleaned with toluene, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonication bath for 10 min each. AgBiS2 thin films were spin coated (6000 rpm, 60 s) onto glass or Si substrate. The spin-coated film was annealed on a hot plate for 5 min per layer. To achieve the desired thickness, the spin-coating and annealing procedures were repeated several times. A final annealing step of 40 min in nitrogen inert atmosphere finished the thin film deposition process. This final annealing enhanced the crystallinity of the AgBiS2 thin film. Briefly, the thickness of final films was controlled by varying the spin coating cycles as well as the ink concentration, while the crystallinity was adjusted via the thermal annealing temperature and time. All solutions and samples were prepared in a glove box filled with N2. Samples prepared on indium tin oxide (ITO) or Si substrates were used for morphology and composition measurements. For electrical measurements, special interdigitated ITO electrodes with an electrode distance of 20 μm were used.

2.3 Characterization
Confocal Raman scattering gives detailed chemical information at different positions to identify the functional groups and characteristic bonds in the sample. Here Raman measurements were performed with a WITec alpha 500 RA confocal Raman microscope with a 10× microscope lens (NA: 0.25) and a fibre coupled spectrometer in a backscattering confocal configuration at room temperature. For excitation, a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser operated at 532 nm was used. The scattered light was spectrally dispersed by a 1800 l mm−1 grating blazed at 500 nm. To avoid contamination from air and water, all samples were prepared and sealed in a vial under nitrogen atmosphere and were measured by directly focusing through the vial. The microscope lens was focused to maximize the C–S symmetric stretch vibration of DMSO at 670 cm−1. The excitation intensity was 8 mW, and the integration time was 1 s with 5 accumulations.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed by classical ex situ Bragg–Brentano geometry using a P analytical X’pert powder diffractometer with filtered Cu-Kα radiation and an X’Celerator solid-state stripe detector operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, with a step size of 0.013°, 400 s per step, from 10° to 70°. Incident beam optics: divergence slit: 1/8, mask: 10 mm, soller slit: 0.04 rad, antiscatter slit: 1/2; detector: PIXcel3D detector (a unique 2D solid-state hybrid pixel detector). All samples were measured under identical conditions.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (JEOL, JSM 7610F) at 3 kV accelerating voltage. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were recorded with the scanning electron microscope equipped with an analytical standard EDX detector (X-Max Extreme, Oxford Instruments).
The transmission and reflection spectra of films were measured by a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer with an integrating sphere, equipped with a photomultiplier and an InGaAs detector (Lambda 950, from Perkin Elmer). For transmittance and reflectance measurements, samples were mounted in front or at the back of the integrating sphere respectively. The measurement range is from 350 nm to 1600 nm, with a step of 2 nm.
The Fourier Transform Photocurrent Spectroscopy (FTPS) measurements were performed with a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer operated in the fast-scan mode, equipped with a tungsten lamp and a quartz beam-splitter. A low noise transimpedance amplifier (Femto DLPCA-200) was used to amplify the photocurrent generated upon illumination by the modulated light from the FTIR. The output voltage of the amplifier was fed back to the external detector input. For measurement, we directly deposited AgBiS2 film ([Ag] = [Bi] = 0.26 M, TU/M = 1.5 precursor, 10 cycles, annealed at 300 °C for 40 min in N2) on top of interdigitated ITO electrodes with an electrode distance of 20 μm.
For the transient photoconductivity measurements, the same sample as for FTPS measurement was used. A function generator (Agilent 33500B) was utilized for driving a 780 nm red laser diode. The output power of the laser diode was 20 mW modulated at 40 Hz. The time resolution of the measurement was ∼2 μs. The photo-current was measured with a transimpedance amplifier (Femto DHPCA-100) with a gain of 105, which also applied a bias of 0.1 V to the sample. The transient signal was monitored with a Tektronix DPO 3034 oscilloscope.
All measurements were conducted at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, AgNO3, BiNO3·5H2O and TU were mixed in DMSO to produce an Ag–Bi–TU–DMSO complex precursor ink. DMSO is a non-toxic, dipolar solvent and exhibits good solvation capabilities.12 DMSO molecule can form bonds with metal ions (Mn+) via the oxygen atom,12,19 and usually DMSO hexa-coordinate to trivalent metal ions.19 Thiourea (CH4N2S) is an organic material owing high crystallographic symmetry and can form extensive hydrogen bonding networks due to its large dipole moment, thus often used as inorganic matrix modifier.20,21 Thiourea molecules can coordinate with metal ions to form stable coordinated complexes. Metal complexes of thiourea are commonly called semi-organics, and benefit from both the advantageous properties of the organic and the inorganic part of complexes.21 It is reported that the bonding in metal–TU complexes may be either through bonding to the nitrogen or through sulphur of the thiourea, but more often between the sulphur and metal atoms.20,22–24Fig. 1a shows a photo digital graph of the Ag–Bi–TU–DMSO inks with different amount of TU. Solution without TU is clear (Fig. 1a-1). When we added 1 TU (1TU means mole concentration of TU is 0.13 M, equal to that of Ag or Bi) inside, the colour of the solution became dark brown and visible particles can be found, as shown in Fig. 1a-2 and Fig. S1-a (ESI†). Interestingly, the solution gradually becomes colourless and visually transparent as more TU (up to 3 TU) was added in (Fig. 1a-3–a-5). Moreover, the colour of the solutions changed to light yellow when the amount of TU was increased to 4 times (Fig. 1a-6). When more TU is added, the yellow colour becomes darker, as shown in Fig. 1a-7 and a-8. For all samples, the concentration of Ag and Bi was constant, while the amount of TU varied. The colour change of the solution indicates that the amount of TU has a dominant influence on the coordination states among different components.

For all precursors, the molar concentration of Ag equals to that of Bi, is 0.13 M, only the concentration of TU varies. Here 1TU stands for the concentration of thiourea is 0.13 M, and the TU/M is 0.5. From a-1 to a-8, the TU/M ratio is 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 5.

To understand the coordination chemistry of Ag–Bi–TU–DMSO solutions, confocal Raman spectroscopy was used to analyse the molecular vibrational modes and functional groups of those designed different TU amount solutions and reference solutions. The change of complexes’ internal bonding, geometry and crystalline states induce characteristic shifts and changes in the vibrational spectra.19 As reference, Raman spectrum of the pure DMSO solvent was measured, as shown in Fig. 1b (black line). The peaks located at 382 cm−1, 670 cm−1 and 697 cm−1 were attributed to C–SO in-plane rock, C–S symmetric stretch and C–S anti-symmetric stretch of DMSO, respectively.12,25 It should be noted that these three peaks were found in all precursor inks. Extra broad peaks at around 488 cm−1 and 747 cm−1 were detected when we simply added TU in DMSO (Fig. 1b and c). Raman spectrum of pure solid thiourea demonstrates that the symmetric CS stretching vibration mode gives the strongest Raman band intensity (734,26 735,24 74021 cm−1), followed by the symmetric N–C–N bending mode (481 cm−124). Therefore, these two broad peaks can be assigned to N–C–N and asymmetric CS vibrations of TU. Here the CS stretching and N–C–N bending modes observed shift to higher wavenumber with respect to pure thiourea, which could be caused by the perturbation of the solvent, different force constants or different bond lengths.24 Note that the amount of metal nitrates keeps constant for all Ag–Bi–nTU–DMSO (n is relative amount of TU) solutions. Only the concentration of TU was increased here. When n is ≤ 3, no characteristic peaks of TU were observed, as TU is consumed to form precipitates or complex with metal ions inside the solution. Besides, it can be noticed that normalized Raman spectrum (Fig. 1b) of Ag–Bi–1TU–DMSO solution is much noisier compared to others. This can be attributed to the reduced effective component inside the solution and the formation of the precipitates at the bottom. XRD patterns of the precipitates are rather unspecific (Fig. S1b, ESI†), as the signals were quite broad, but indicating there might be AgBiS2, Ag2S, and Bi2S3 phases. EDX mapping results confirm the existence of Ag, Bi and S elements inside (Fig. S1c, ESI†). However, TU characteristic bands appear gradually when excess amount of TU (n ≥ 4) was added, revealing the formation of metal–TU complexes is completed. Moreover, larger n results in a darker yellow solution and Raman modes shift to higher wave number of C–S symmetric stretch (670 cm−1) and C–S anti-symmetric (697 cm−1) stretch of DMSO. No extra peak or peak shift with respect to pure DMSO solution was observed when only AgNO3 was added (Fig. 1b and Fig. S4, ESI†) to the DMSO.
Enlarged C–S stretch Raman spectra (Fig. 1c) clearly reveal the shift of the bonding energy. There is no shift of the C–S symmetric stretch (670 cm−1) and C–S anti-symmetric (697 cm−1) stretch of DMSO when we add the TU or AgNO3 inside DMSO. However, adding Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in DMSO results in a C–S anti-symmetric (697 cm−1) stretch shifts to 699 cm−1 with extra shoulders at around 680 cm−1 and 718 cm−1 (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, a weak band at around 429 cm−1 was found. The shift to higher wavenumber, appearance of shoulders and extra peaks were observed for all Bi(NO3)3·5H2O containing samples (Fig. 1b and c), evidencing the formation of Bi3+–DMSO complexes. Besides, the transparent Bi3+–DMSO solution changes to yellow upon the addition of TU (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†), which indicates the formation of a new soluble complex between TU and Bi3+–DMSO. Moreover, both the symmetric stretch (670 cm−1) and C–S anti-symmetric (697 cm−1) stretch of DMSO slightly shift to higher wavenumber when more TU was added into Ag–Bi–DMSO system (Fig. 1c and Fig. S4, ESI†). The slight shift to higher wavenumber in these bands results from the coordination between TU and metal ions as well as by changes of chemical bond length of corresponding complexes. Generally, the stronger the M–S bond is, the more energetic and higher the M–S stretching frequencies and the corresponding force constants become.
Besides, we found TU amount has a crucial impact on forming a stable molecular ink. The importance of TU's coordination ability is exemplified in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†) where designed references are depicted. It shows that the TU–AgNO3–DMSO solution is dark brown when the ratio of TU/Ag is ≤1 due to the formation of Ag2S precipitate (Fig. S2d, ESI†). In contrast, coordination with 2TU can stabilize the Ag+ in a soluble complex, giving a colourless and transparent solution (Fig. S2d, ESI†). Furthermore, Raman measurements show that no characteristic peak corresponding to TU was detected in the solution with TU/Ag ≤ 2 due to the consumption of TU either by the formation of Ag2S (in the case of TU/Ag ≤ 1) or the formation of [Ag(TU)2]·NO3 complex (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, when the TU/Ag ratio is increased to or above 3, the TU character peak at around 488 cm−1 and 747 cm−1 appeared (Fig. S4, ESI†). These results reveal that 2TU is enough to form stable Ag–TU complex, which is in agreement with the previous report.20 The significance of TU is further evidenced by Fig. S3 (ESI†), adding excess TU can turn black Ag–Bi–1TU–DMSO suspension into clear yellow solution.
In conclusion, there are bonds formed between Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, DMSO and TU, and bonds between TU and AgNO3. Possible complexation mechanisms are summarized in Fig. S2, S3 and corresponding discussion in the ESI.† Based on the results and discussions above, we propose general coordination states under sufficient TU concentration,27,28 as shown below:Bi(NO3)3 + 6DMSO → [Bi(DMSO)6](NO3)3[Bi(DMSO)6](NO3)3 + TU → [Bi(DMSO)6](NO3)3–TU complexAgNO3 + 2TU → [Ag(TU)2]·NO3
To further understand the influence of TU/M on films’ microstructures and properties, we fabricated films on glass substrates by spin coating the precursor with different TU/M ratio ([Ag] = [Bi] = 0.13 M, 8 layers, all annealed at 300 °C for 40 min in N2). Fig. 2 shows room temperature XRD patterns of films obtained from different TU/M inks. The thin film obtained from ink with TU/M ratio of 0.5 has an amorphous character while the thin film obtained from ink with TU/M ratio of 0.75 shows broad characteristic peaks of cubic structure AgBiS2. When TU/M ratios are further increased, the crystallinity becomes better and peaks located at 27.45°, 31.75°, 45.53°, 53.93°, 56.62° and 66.28° are clearly observed, which correspond to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), and (400) planes of cubic AgBiS2 (PDF number: 00-021-1178), respectively. In addition, all the films show a preferential growth along the [111] direction. The scattering domain size D (crystallite size) of the AgBiS2 thin films was estimated by fitting the width (FWHM = full width at half maximum) of the first five reflections. Reflection 400 is omitted, because of its too weak intensity. The crystallite sizes were estimated by a size-strain plot to be around 67(±2) nm, 67(±5) nm, 60(±2) nm and 56(±1) nm corresponding to thin films fabricated from TU/M ratio of 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 solutions respectively, as shown in Fig. 2b. Based on XRD results, we conclude that TU/M = 1 and 1.5 samples can give films with better crystallinity under the same processing condition.
The morphologies and elemental compositions of the resulting films were analysed via SEM and EDX measurements. Fig. 2c–f shows the surface morphologies of different samples. When the TU/M ratio is 1, the film shows some big particles, but the size distribution is not homogeneous (Fig. 2c). By increasing the TU/M ratio to 1.5, compact and homogeneous films with large grains can be achieved (Fig. 2d). However, when the TU/M ratio was further increased, lots of pinholes were observed on the surface of the resulting films (Fig. 2e and f). Particularly in the samples from TU/M = 3, there are some agglomerated big particles, exposing bare ITO substrate. This could be explained by thermal decomposition of excess TU, releasing some gaseous side products12,29 (CS2, HNCS and NH3) out of the film during annealing. Table 1 summarizes the elemental atomic ratio of different films derived from varying TU/M ratio inks. As shown in the Table 1, the increasing thiourea content in the ink did not result in higher sulphur content in the final films, which agrees with our speculation that the excessive TU decomposed during annealing process and distorted the morphology of the film. The atomic ratio of Ag/Bi/S (TU/M = 1.5) was measured to be 8.45/7.98/15.68, which is very close to the AgBiS2 stoichiometric value of 1:1:2. A certain excess of sulphur source is necessary to compensate the loss of sulphur during pyrolysis as it is common in the case of CZTS and CIGS.12,15,30,31 Based on these and XRD results, we chose the TU/M = 1.5 precursor as the ink for further film fabrication, to study of the influence of annealing temperature on the structural and morphological properties of resulting thin films.

A study of the influence of annealing temperature on the films’ properties has also been undertaken to find out the best synthesis condition. Here we used TU/M ratio = 1.5 precursor to fabricate all our films on glass ([Ag] = [Bi] = 0.26 M, 10 layers). Konstantatos et al.4 reported that AgBiS2 nanoparticles can be successfully synthesised at 100 °C using hot injection approach. Temperature higher than 300 °C will degrade the quality of ITO substrates. Here we chose temperature from 100 °C to 300 °C with a step size of 50 °C. XRD patterns of films obtained at different annealing temperatures are shown in Fig. 3a. The film annealed at 100 °C shows an amorphous character. When the temperature was increased above 150 °C, cubic AgBiS2 phase (PDF number: 00-021-1178) was obtained. The patterns show that the AgBiS2 films grow preferentially along the [111] direction, independent from the annealing temperature. Here we applied the same fitting process to estimate the crystallite size as for samples with different TU/M ratios. Generally, the crystallite size becomes larger as the annealing temperature is increased (Fig. 3b), which is consistent with the evolution of FWHM trend shown in Table 2. The increase in the crystallite size with increasing temperature can be correlated with the enhancement of crystallinity of the AgBiS2 films.

Fig. 4a–d show the surface morphologies of those samples measured by SEM. Particle sizes of 150 °C and 200 °C samples are quite small, and their surface is not so dense. As the temperature goes up to 250 °C, the film quality becomes better. Sample annealed at 300 °C (Fig. 4d) has the largest particle size with a mean value of around 105 nm (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The cross-sectional graph is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the lower magnification picture demonstrates that the obtained film is uniform. As seen from the inserted high magnification picture, a clear AgBiS2 layer can be distinguished from the ITO substrate with a total thickness of around 200 nm. Fig. 4e shows the surface atomic force micrograph of the sample annealed at 300 °C. The statistical particle size distribution is shown in Fig. S6b (ESI†), and the average particle size is around 112 nm, which is in accordance with the results obtained from SEM (Fig. 4d). The root mean square (RMS) roughness is estimated to be ∼8 nm from the AFM measurement (Fig. 4e). The phase image in Fig. 4f practically visualizes the first derivative of the surface topography and confirms the formation of homogeneous thin film. Table 2 gives composition information of films annealed at different temperatures, the measured atomic ratios of Ag/Bi/S are very close to the stoichiometric value of 1:1:2, independent of annealing temperature.

It is reported that the DMSO in spin casted films starts to evaporate at around 100 °C, and the decomposition of TU is between 180 to 230 °C, accompanied by releasing side products of CS2, HNCS, and NH3.12,29 When the wetting films were subjected to 300 °C, we propose the general formation mechanism as below.n[Ag(TU)2]·NO3 + n[Bi(DMSO)6](NO3)3–TU → (AgBiS2)n + CS2 + HNCS + NH3(AgBiS2)n → n(AgBiS2)
To further confirm the films’ phase information, we performed related Rietveld fitting, and found no other secondary phase (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). The results of texture fitting (Fig. S9, ESI†) also confirmed that the obtained AgBiS2 thin film is a pure cubic AgBiS2 phase.

Fig. 5a shows reflectance, transmittance and absorptance spectra (A% = 1 − T% − R%) of the AgBiS2 film (grown from TU/M = 1.5 precursor, post annealed at 300 °C). The optical band gap values of the thin film were determined using the relation:32,33 αhν = A(hν − Eg)n(1)where Eg is the optical band gap, α is the absorption coefficient at a frequency ν, h is the Plank constant, and A is a constant, respectively. The parameter n is a number associated with different types of electronic transitions: n = 1/2, 2, 3/2 or 3 for direct allowed, indirect allowed, direct-forbidden and indirect-forbidden transitions, respectively.34 The optical absorption coefficient α of the AgBiS2 thin films was calculated from the transmittance (%T) and reflectance (%R) spectra measurements, using the equation (2)where d is the thickness of the sample. Note that this approximation does not consider the light reflected at the backside of the sample and neglects the thin film interference. The thicknesses d of the thin film was ∼200 nm, as seen from the cross-section shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The calculated absorption coefficient, shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), exhibits high values from 105 to 103 within the 350 to 1400 nm wavelength range, comparable to that of CIGS.4,8 By plotting (αhν)1/nversus hν, Eg can be estimated from the intersection of the tangent and the x-axis. So far, the bandgap values and transition types of AgBiS2 exhibit large variations among the published studies. Biswas et al.35,36 adopted a solid-state reaction to synthesis cubic bulk AgBiS2 material and reported a band gap of around 0.8 eV. They also prepared AgBiS2 nanoparticles through bottom-up soft chemical synthesis, showing a band gap of around 1.0 eV, and speculated that the blue shift is due to the quantum confinement. Qian et al.37 reported their as-prepared AgBiS2 nanocrystals are direct transitions, and the band gap of 2.78 eV (2.8–2.9,27 direct 2.67 eV36). Konstantatos et al.4 only compared the absorption coefficients of AgBiS2 with MAPbI3 and CIGS, while they didn’t clarify the transition type. To sum up, most of the reports claim that AgBiS2 is a direct bandgap material, although there was no decent photoluminescence data reported. Very recently, Simonov et al.8 stated their spray coated AgBiS2 is an indirect allowed transition, close to 1.25 eV. Here, the estimated value of Eg is around 1.21 eV by assuming direct band gap (via plotting (αhν)2vs. (hν), as shown in Fig. 5b). While assuming an indirect semiconductor, we demonstrate a value of around 0.87 eV (by plotting (αhν)0.5vs. (hν), as shown in Fig. 5c). This value is consistent with the reports from Ayhan et al.,38 claiming an indirect bandgap of 0.83 eV. To give further insights, we performed photo-conductivity spectroscopy in a lateral geometry utilizing a FTIR spectrometer (see Experimental section for the details). As seen in Fig. 5d, the spectrally resolved photocurrent in a Tauc presentation for an indirect semiconductor estimates a band-gap of 0.83 eV. This result is in excellent agreement with Fig. 5c. We conclude that the obtained AgBiS2 material is an indirect semiconductor and features two optical transition mechanisms, with an indirect bandgap of 0.87 eV and lager direct band gap of 1.21 eV, similarly to Si and Ge.39 In a semilogarithmic presentation of Fig. 5d, a linear fitting of the onset is used to calculate the Urbach energy,40,41 shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Due to the indirect nature of the material, there appears a shoulder. Below the shoulder, there is a linear part at the lower photon energy region. The inverse of the slope is the Urbach energy.40,41 Here the calculated value is 55.55 meV, which is close to the reported 50 meV for InAs/GaAs quantum dots solar cell,42 48 meV for 40% Sn-based CH3NH3(Sn40, Pb60)I3 perovskite material43 and 40–45 meV value for amorphous Si41,44 at room temperature.

(b) Direct band gap Tauc plot of the AgBiS2 film yields an estimated band gap of ∼1.21 eV, (c) indirect Tauc plot yields a smaller band gap of around 0.87 eV, (d) Tauc plot of the AgBiS2 thin film FTPS spectrum. 
The presence of photoconductivity is a prerequisite for a material to be evaluated as a potential candidate for application in the field of photovoltaics. Fig. 6 demonstrates the photocurrent of AgBiS2 film annealed at 300 °C. Here transient photo-current was recorded utilizing a fast transimpedance amplifier (gain 105) and a digital storage oscilloscope. The photocurrent (Iph) to dark current (Idark) ratio (Iph/Idark) is 3.63 (2.07/0.57). The rise and fall times are similar, which shows that this measurement is limited by the time resolution of the setup. The absence of long current transients after switching off the laser diode, indicating the short life-time of the photo-generated charge-carries, but also the absence of deep trap states. These indicate that the obtained AgBiS2 is a potential absorber for photovoltaic applications.

4. Conclusion
We have presented a novel molecular precursor ink route for the fabrication of AgBiS2 thin films. The molecular ink can be simply formulated by mixing the readily available metal nitrates and thiourea in DMSO solvent. We studied the complexation mechanism among the metal nitrates, thiourea and DMSO with the assistance of Raman spectroscopy. It is found that the TU/M ratio plays a crucial role for the formulation of a stable Ag–Bi–TU–DMSO ink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a systematic study of the formation mechanism of this AgBiS2 molecular ink. The influence of the TU/M ratio and annealing temperature on the structural and morphological properties of the resulting AgBiS2 films are examined. AgBiS2 thin films fabricated from TU/M = 1.5 precursor ink and post annealed at 300 °C give the largest crystalline domains combined with a compact film formation. Besides, we demonstrate that the obtained AgBiS2 features a lower energy indirect band gap of 0.87 eV and a direct band gap of around 1.21 eV. The high absorption coefficient in visible range, low Urbach energy and the fast-transient photo-conductivity response underpins its feasibility as absorber in solar-cell applications.
