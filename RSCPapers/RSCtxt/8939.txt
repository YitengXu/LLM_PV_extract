    , Accepted 25th August 2020First published on 25th August 2020AbstractImprovement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSC) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) upon modifications of mesoporous titania layers has been studied. For PSC with triple cation perovskite (FA0.76 MA0.19 Cs0.05 Pb (I0.81 Br0.19)3) about 40% higher photocurrent (up to ∼24 mA cm−2) was found for more homogenous, made of larger particles (30 nm) and thinner (150–200 nm) titania layer. For DSSC (both with liquid cobalt-based electrolyte as well as with solid state hole transporter – spiro-OMeTAD), a greater dye loading, rise in photovoltage, and the enhancement in relative photocurrent were observed for the cells prepared from the diluted titania paste (2:1 w/w ratio) with respect to those prepared from undiluted one. The impact of these improvements in titania layers on charge transfer dynamics in the complete solar cells as well as in pristine TiO2 layers was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption. Shorter photocarriers lifetime in perovskite material observed in better PSC, indicated that faster electron transfer at the titania interface was responsible for the higher photocurrent. Moreover, the photoinduced changes close to TiO2 interface were revealed in better PSC, which may indicate that in the efficient devices halide segregation takes place in perovskite material. In liquid DSSC, the fast component of unwanted recombination was slower in the samples with the diluted titania paste than in those made with undiluted ones. In solid state DSSC, hole injection from MK2 dye to spiro-OMeTAD takes place on the very fast ps time scale (comparable to that of electron injection) and the evidence of better penetration of spiro-OMeTAD into thinner and more porous titania layers was provided.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) belong to the very promising and potentially cheap emerging photovoltaic technologies. PSCs have been developed really rapidly in the latest few years, reaching the highest sunlight power conversion efficiency of 25%,1 very close to the theoretical limit for single bandgap active material. The best efficiency of DSSC is about 14% achieved when using cobalt-based electrolyte,2,3 but this environmentally friendly technology has been recently re-discovered as the best suited for indoor applications.4 It is because the efficiency of DSSC under low light intensity is greater than any of other common photovoltaic devices.5 Despite a large number of papers devoted to PSC (> 15000 papers so far) and DSSC (> 24000 publications up to now), the fundamental studies of charge transfer processes using time-resolved laser spectroscopies have been relatively rare, especially for the complete solar cell as samples.6
A very important element present in the most efficient PSCs and DSSCs is the mesoporous titania layer that accepts electrons from active materials and transfers them to the transparent conductive glass electrode.7,8 In DSSC, titania nanoparticles form a layer of a few microns in thickness (typically up to 10 μm). Sensitizing dyes are attached to such a scaffold and, after photoexcitation, inject electrons to TiO2 conduction band in the very fast process (typically on fs and ps time scale), which is the primary charge separation step in DSSC operation. The regeneration of the dye (transfer of the electron to the oxidized form of the dye obtained after electron injection) in the cells with liquid electrolyte takes place on the time scale much longer than that of electron injection, typically from several hundreds of nanoseconds to single microseconds.6,8 However, if the electrolyte is substituted by solid state hole transporting material (e.g. the most popular spiro-OMeTAD) to enhance the stability of the cell, then the regeneration can occur much faster, even on the time scale comparable to that of electron injection (due to the hole hopping and higher density of charge conductive centers in the polymeric structure instead of redox pair diffusion in the electrolyte).9–11 Solid state DSSC still suffers from low efficiencies with respect to the cell with liquid electrolyte, mainly due to the problem of sufficient contact between all dyes and hole transporting materials.8,12,13 It should be noted that one of the most promising recent findings is the solidification of copper-based electrolytes (instead of the use of spiro-OMeTAD),5 which lead to record efficiency close to 12% for solid state DSSC.14
In PSC, the architecture is more similar to that of thin film solar cells where the active perovskite materials is placed between the charge selective layers of electron- and hole- transporting materials.15 However, in the most efficient devices, the titania mesoporous layer is still present (providing a base on which the perovskite crystalizes),16 although its thickness is much smaller (a few hundreds of nm) than that in DSSC. The optimization of the thickness and porosity of titania layers in PSC and DSSC is necessary for achieving high total power conversion efficiency. However, often it is unclear whether upon such optimization the fastest charge dynamics is changed and the efficiency of the primary charge separation step (the electron transfer at the interface between active material and titania) is improved.
Therefore, in the present work, we have constructed PSC and DSSC devices using the most efficient compounds and with different mesoporous titania layers to study the fully operating solar cell samples using the femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. For PSC, triple cation perovskite (containing methylammonium, formamidinium and cesium) was the active material17 and spiro-OMeTAD was the hole transporting layer, while titania layers of different thickness and porosity were tested. For DSSC, the efficient commercial carbazole dye MK218 and cobalt-based liquid electrolytes19–21 were used to check the effect of dilution of popular commercial titania paste. Furthermore, also a solid state DSSC with spiro-OMeTAD and three types of titania layers were investigated. Our studies were aimed to establish whether the use of better titania layers (improving the sunlight conversion efficiency) correlates or not with the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and holes. Such information should be important for better understanding and further optimization of PSC and DSSC.
2. Experimental
Substrates for transparent electrodes for the cells were cut out from FTO glass sheet (Sigma-Aldrich, 2.2 mm thickness, 13 Ω sq−1). At first the glass plates were cleaned by sonication in a solution of commercially available dishwashing detergent (TRILLUX) mixed with distilled water, pure distilled water and ethanol, with each cleaning procedure lasting for 15 min. After drying by air flow, a UV ozone cleaner was used.
For PSC, spin-coating deposition was used in all steps of preparation. Electron transporting material (ETM) consisting of compact and mesoporous TiO2 layers was deposited at first. A solution of titanium isopropoxide and ethanol was prepared in proportion of 1:9, respectively. Compact layer of TiO2 was obtained by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 1 minute and then dried at 100 °C on a hot plate for 5 minutes. Next, the samples were gradually heated in the oven and kept at 450 °C for 30 min to form a compact TiO2 layer. Two different mesoporous layers were used. The first one was prepared from TiO2 paste for screen-printing of 18–20 nm-sized particle (DN-GPS-18TS, Dyenamo), dissolved in ethanol at the ratio of 1:6 (w:w). The second mesoporous layer was prepared from another TiO2 paste of larger average particle size of 30 nm (GreatCell Solar, 30NR-D), similarly dissolved in ethanol at the ratio of 1:6 (w/w). The mixtures were preliminarily stirred continuously for 1 day. Mesoporous layers were spin coated at 2000 rpm for 10 s and then dried at 120 °C on the hot plate. Again, the substrates with titania layers were gradually heated in the oven and kept at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The abbreviations of the titania layers studied in this work refer to the deposition method, particles size and the possible use of dilution (see Table S1 in the ESI†). Thus, the two above paste are abbreviated as SC18dil and SC30dil.
Then, triple cation perovskite layer (FA0.76 MA0.19 Cs0.05 Pb (I0.81 Br0.19)3, where MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium) was deposited by spin coating from 1.5 M precursor solution in DMF:DMSO (4:1 by volume, 10 s, 2000 rpm, then 20 s, 4000 rpm). Chlorobenzene (as anti-solvent) was applied 10 s before the end of the spinning. Subsequently, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 40 minutes. The hole transporting material (HTM) layer was obtained by spin-coating (4000 rpm, 30 s) from a solution consisting of 72.3 mg mL−1 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluoren (spiro-OMeTAD, Sigma-Aldrich), 28.8 μL mL−1 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Aldrich), and 17.5 μL mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI, 520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich), all dissolved in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich). The precursor solutions were prepared in oxygen free glovebox at a humidity RH = 6–7%, while the deposition of perovskite, annealing and deposition of HTM took place in another glovebox with oxygen presence at a humidity RH = 6–7%. Finally, gold electrodes were deposited on the top of HTM by sputtering technique for 60 s or 120 s, giving 25–50 or 50–100 nm layer thicknesses, respectively. The electrode sizes were of 0.05 or 0.20 cm2 (0.125 cm2 with the mask).
For DSSC studies, liquid cells (L-DSSC) with cobalt-based electrolyte and solid-state cells (S-DSSC) were constructed. At first, the blocking TiO2 layer was formed on FTO electrodes by submerging them in 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, followed by rinsing with water, and heating at 150 °C for 5 min, 300 °C for 5 min, then at 450 °C for 30 min. At the next step, the two types of mesoporous titania layer were formed using the screen printing technique and nanoparticle paste of TiO2 (DN-GPS-30TS, Dyenamo with 28–31 nm particles). The first one was made from the undiluted paste (abbreviated as SP30), The second, diluted-paste based mesoporous (SP30dil) layer, was prepared by mixing the above commercial paste with solution (6 g cellulose, 4 mL ethanol, 15 mL alpha-terpineol) at the ratio 2:1. After screen-printing of either diluted or undiluted pastes, the glass plates with mesoporous titania were gradually heated at 150 °C for 5 min, 300 °C for 5 min, and 450 °C for 60 min. After that, the glass plates were submerged in 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 (and treated in the same way as the blocking layer). For photoanode sensitization, the hot plates with TiO2 layers were immersed in MK2 dye solutions in toluene for about 16 h to enable efficient adsorption of the dye. For MK2 sensitization we used either the solution of 0.2 mM dye and 0.1 mM of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as co-adsorbent or the solution of 0.2 mM dye without co-adsorbent.
Counter electrodes for L-DSSC were prepared from the same FTO glass plates and using the same cleaning procedure as that of photoanodes. Afterwards, they were dried in air and one layer of activated platinum (Platisol T, Solaronix) was deposited by paintbrush. Finally, the plates were heated at 450 °C for 30 min in order to remove any organic contamination. The photoanodes and counter electrode were bonded together by a polymer seal (25 μm Surlyn, Meltronix, Solaronix SA) with the conducting surfaces facing inwards. At the next step, the devices were filled with electrolyte through the 1 mm holes in the counter electrode and sealed with the cover glass on the top. We used the cobalt-bipyridine (bpy) or cobalt-phenanthroline (phen) complexes in acetonitrile solutions as the electrolytes for L-DSSC. The electrodes with MK2 and CDCA were used with the electrolyte consisting of 0.25 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2, 0.035 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.5 M TBP, and this configuration is abbreviated as CBpy. The electrodes without CDCA were used with the electrolyte consisting of 0.13 M [Co(phen)3](TFSI)2, 0.035 M [Co(phen)3](TFSI)3, 0.1 M of LiTFSI, and 0.5 M TBP, and this configuration is abbreviated as Phen. For S-DSSC, we used MK2 without CDCA for sensitization, and SC30dil, SP30dil or SP30 titania layers. Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM and gold electrodes were deposited as described above for PSC.
A UV-VIS-NIR JASCO V-770 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere (LN-925) was used to measure the stationary absorption spectra in the UV-VIS range. The samples were mounted in front of the integrating sphere in order to detect both transmitted and scattered light. The cross section images were recorded by Jeol 7001 TTLS field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) working at the acceleration voltage varying from 5 to 15 kV. Current–voltage measurements and IPCE (incident photon to current efficiency) spectra for the studied solar cells were recorded using a potentiostat (model M101, Autolab) coupled to a photoelectric spectrometer, equipped with a solar simulator (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland). A Xe lamp with AM 1.5G spectral filter and irradiance adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using a calibrated cell (15151, ABET) mimicked the sunlight conditions. The same complete solar cells as those for current–voltage measurements were used for the transient absorption studies. Transient absorption system has been described recently in more details (Helios spectrometer, Ultrafast Systems, and Spectra Physics laser system).22 The laser pulses were set to 310, 355 or 500 nm and the IRF (pump–probe cross correlation function) duration was from 150 to 300 fs (FWHM). The transient absorption measurements were analyzed using the Surface Explorer software (Ultrafast Systems), including the global analysis. The program allowed fitting a multi-exponential function (convoluted with IRF) to the kinetic vectors of a selected number of singular values. Finally, the characteristic time constants and the wavelength-dependent amplitudes associated with them were obtained (they are also called the decay associated spectra or pre-exponential factor spectra). The fit quality was examined by the comparison of the multi-exponential fitted functions to the kinetic vectors.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and stationary absorption
In order to determine the thickness of individual layers in solar cells SEM cross section images were carefully analyzed. The examples are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1A shows the cross section of SP30dil titania layer, while that of SP30 layer is presented in Fig. S1A (ESI†). The estimated thickness of SP30dil layer is 1.3–1.5 μm, while that of SP30 is 2.5–3 μm. Therefore, the use of diluted paste results in about twice smaller thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film. Moreover, the SP30dil structure has a higher porosity than that of SP30 one, as indicated by the previous studies with different ethyl cellulose content in the titania paste.23 The cross section of PVSK solar cell made with a SC30dil thin titania layer is shown in Fig. 1B. The total thickness of the cell is about 850 nm, and the following layers deposited on the FTO glass substrate can be recognized: 150–200 nm of SC30dil (including very thin compact TiO2 layer which is hard to be distinguished), 450–500 nm of pure triple cation PVSK, 100–150 nm of spiro-OMeTAD and 50–100 nm of Au electrode. The average thickness of the solar cells made with a SC18dil layer is 1000 nm (Fig. S1B, ESI†), which indicates that the thickness of SC18dil layer is about twice higher than that of SC30dil one. Moreover, the homogeneity of the SC18dil is also worse with much higher variance in its thickness at different spots. It also agrees with the eye observation of the electrodes (before perovskite deposition): those made with SC18dil are much more opaque, suggesting the presence of more scattering grains in SC18dil than in SC30dil layer. The differences in the thicknesses of the studied mesoporous layers are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
 Fig. 1  SEM cross sections of SP30dil titania layer (A) and PSC made using SC30dil layer (B). 
The differences in the thickness of SP30dilvs.SP30 and SC30dilvs.SC18dil layers were also confirmed by stationary absorption measurements of the electrodes (Fig. S2, ESI†). The absorbance values below 400 nm (where TiO2 absorbs) are higher for SP30 than SP30dil and higher for SC18dil than SC30dil. However, the exact thickness ratio of different titania layers is hard to estimate in this way, because the absorbance is also affected by the scattering contribution, which results in the baseline signal increasing for shorter wavelength (and observed already at wavelength longer than 400 nm). Moreover, the absorption baseline is also affected by the oscillations appearing due to the light interference at the layers of sub μm sizes24 present on the electrodes.
The stationary absorption measurements were also used to determine the absorption spectrum of active layers (dyes or perovskite) after the subtraction of titania layers contribution. The examples are shown in Fig. 2. These data are important to estimate the numbers of absorbed photons from 1 Sun irradiation (Nph), which are necessary to calculate and compare the relative photocurrent of different cells (in the next section).

The contribution of titania has been subtracted in both figures. The inset in (A) presents the spectra with enlarged absorbance scale. 
3.2. Photovoltaic parameters

Table 1 shows the photovoltaic parameters of the best cells prepared using different titania layers. The absorbance of the active material at selected wavelength and the number of absorbed photons (Nph) from 1 Sun irradiation are given along with the standard photovoltaic parameters: open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and sunlight power conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, Table 1 presents also the calculated parameter total APCE (APCE – absorbed photon to current efficiency), describing the relative photocurrent of the cells per the number of absorbed photons. It is defined as the total APCE = JSC/e Nph, where e is elementary charge. This parameter allows us to compare the efficiency of charge separation between the cells with different amounts of adsorbed dyes, as we did in many of our previous studies.25–28 The average values of the photovoltaic parameters with errors based on the measurement of several cells of the same type are collected in Table S2 (ESI†).

At first, the DSSC samples with the liquid electrolyte (L-DSSC) will be described. The cells sensitized with popular carbazole dye called MK2 were studied in two configurations: without co-adsorbent in Co-phenanthroline electrolyte (Phen), and with CDCA in Co-bipyridine electrolyte (CBpy), using both SP30dil and SP30 layers (Table 1A). The absorbance of MK2 (and thus the total amount of MK2 dyes on titania layer) is, as expected, smaller in the samples with the co-adsorption of CDCA. However, for both the cells with and without CDCA, the amount of dyes in SP30dil layers is as high as about 75% of that in the corresponding SP30 layers. Having in mind that the thickness of SP30 is about twice that of SP30dil, it means that the dye loading per layer thickness is significantly higher for the cells prepared with the diluted paste. It can be probably explained by higher porosity of the SP30dil titania layer. Furthermore, Table 1A shows that the photocurrent (JSC) of the fresh cells is only slightly smaller for SP30dil cells, while IPCE spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicate that it originates mainly from higher absorption on the rising, long-wavelength part of MK2 absorption band. Small difference in JSC results in the higher relative photocurrent (total APCE) for SP30dil cells than SP30 ones. Finally, L-DSSC from diluted titania paste exhibits higher VOC (by about 0.04 V) indicating slightly smaller recombination losses in SP30dil cells. Our observations of the above improvements upon dilution of titania paste are consistent with previous reports.23,29 The layers with higher porosity permit a more effective transport of large redox shuttles like cobalt complexes. However, the studies of the impact of titania modifications on ultrafast charge transfer process, which we present in the next sections, has not been addressed so far.
It should be noted that the same trends in the differences between SP30dil and SP30 cells (higher VOC and total APCE, better dye loading) were confirmed in our preliminary studies of L-DSSC with other dyes (indoline dye D20530,31 and the 2:1 mixture of MK2:D205 in Co-phenanthroline electrolyte). After 20 days, the parameters of L-DSSC were quite stable and most of them even improved, increasing the total efficiency of the cell (Table 1B). The best efficiency of about 4.5% was reached for the cells made with diluted paste. It is not very high comparing this value to that of the best L-DSSC (efficiencies 12–14%);2,3 however, it should be noted that our result was achieved on the very thin (1.3–1.5 μm) and transparent titania layer only.
PSC with triple cation perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD as hole transporting layer, and SC18dil or SC30dil titania layers as electron transporting material, were studied. Their photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1C. As can be seen, all parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) are better for the cells prepared on SC30dil than SC18dil, which confirms that more the homogenous thinner, and made of larger particles mesoporous titania layer is advantageous for the performance of this kind of cells. Better photovoltaic parameters obtained for larger nanoparticles and thinner TiO2 layers are consistent with the previous reports.7 For example, the efficiency of PCS made of MAPbI3 was 14.34% for 400 nm layer thickness of 25 nm particles, while it improved to 18.72% for 150 nm layer thickness with 41 nm particles.7 The improvement observed for larger particles was assigned to higher porosity and mean pore diameter of the resultant layer. However, according to our knowledge, the charge transfer dynamics (presented in the next sections) has not been compared so far.
The photovoltage (VOC close to 1.1 V) and photocurrent (JSC above 24 mA cm−2) of our best PSC with SC30dil layer are close to the top efficiencies reported for PSC. The very high value of the relative photocurrent (close to 100%) indicates almost no charge recombination at low voltages. The constructed perovskite solar cells exhibit relatively small hysteresis with the hysteresis index of 0.03–0.05 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Our best PSC efficiency is about 18%, and the parameter which mainly limits our efficiency and which is significantly lower with respect to the best PSC devices, is the fill factor. The obtained values of FF below 0.7 in PSC are probably due to the sputtering method of gold electrode depositions used for our cells, instead of typically employed thermal evaporation technique. It is confirmed and explained in ESI† (Table S3 and the short discussion below, ESI†). However, it should be emphasized that low FF values of our PSC (and also our solid state DSSC described below) do not change the main conclusions following from our studies since we are mainly focused on the photocurrents and all samples compared are affected by gold sputtering in the similar way.
The solid state DSSC (S-DSSC) were prepared using SC30dil (the same as for PSC), SP30dil or SP30 (the same as for L-DSSC) titania layers sensitized with MK2 dyes (without co-adsorbent). The electrodes were then covered with spiro-OMeTAD and gold electrodes. The photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1C. Although JSC increases for thicker titania layers due to more adsorbed dyes, the other parameters (VOC, FF and total APCE) significantly decrease when going from samples with SC30dil (thickness 150–200 nm) to SP30dil (1.3–1.5 μm) and further to SP30 (2.5–3 μm). The common problem with S-DSSC is the penetration of spiro-OMeTAD to deeper titania layers sensitized with the dye,8 which is confirmed in our results. The best efficiency of about 0.8% is obtained for the cell with SP30dil layer. Fill factor values improve in both PSC and S-DSSC samples for more porous and thinner titania layer due to better pore filling by the precursor solution and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively.
The composition and deposition method of spiro-OMeTAD were optimized for PSC and it is probably one of the reasons why the parameters and efficiencies of our S-DSSC are rather poor, comparing to other reports of S-DSSC with MK2 dye (∼3%).32,33 Despite preferable match of HOMO levels of the dye (0.92 eV vs. NHE)34 and the HTM (0.75 eV vs. NHE),35 TiO2 layer is not fully covered by the dyes as it is covered by the perovskite layer in PSC, allowing unwanted direct charge recombination at HTM/ETM interface. However, the total APCE values in our S-DSSC (from 0.52 to 0.38, compared to 0.60–0.80 for L-DSSC) indicate that still about half of the photoinduced charges are successfully separated at low voltages, therefore the findings from transient absorption studies presented in the next sections are still informative for the operation of S-DSSC.
3.3. Transient absorption of titania layers
We will begin with presentation of the transient absorption results obtained for isolated electrodes with titania layers excited at 310 or 355 nm. Such excitation leads to the direct absorption of light by TiO2 and creation of electron–hole pairs. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the exemplary transient spectra for SC30dil in UV-VIS and NIR ranges at selected time delays between pump and probe pulses. The results of global three-exponential analysis of the same sample are presented in Fig. 3A and B. Initially, the negative bleach signal in the spectral range of TiO2 stationary absorption can be observed below 380 nm. At longer wavelength in the VIS range the positive signal from holes and trapped electrons can be observed, while the positive signals in NIR range are dominated by free and shallowly trapped electrons.36 After 1 ns the majority of signals decay due to charge recombination, but below 400 nm a positive, a long-lasting band appears, which we assign to the thermal artifact – broadening of the titania absorption band upon local sample heating. Indeed, our stationary absorption measurements showed that TiO2 electrodes increase their absorption in the range from 340 to 400 nm upon heating, with approximately 0.0008 change in absorption per 1 Celsius degree at 340 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). This artifact, being responsible for the existence of transient absorption signal, even when no excited state population is present, has been reported recently for some metal oxide semiconductors: BiVO4,37 hematite, LaFeO3 or LaMnO3.38 However, according to our knowledge, this effect has not been reported for TiO2 as yet.
 Fig. 3  Examples of the global analysis of transient absorption data using a three-exponential function with a constant offset for SC30dil electrode: in UV-VIS (A) and NIR ranges (B). The normalized kinetics at 600 nm for the indicated samples at fluences from 0.5 to 4 mJ cm−2, together with mixed first and second order functions fitted (dotted lines) for SC30dil samples (C). The scaling factors for the initial photoexcited charge concentration (n0) are also given. The normalized kinetics at 1100 nm for different titania samples measured at the same fluence (D). The amplitudes of SC30dil and SC18dil were multiplied by 1.85 in (D) to have the same value as those of SP30 and SP30dil samples. 
The multi-exponential global analysis reveals that the majority of free electrons decays occur with the time constant of about 1 ps (amplitudes of τ1 component in Fig. 3B, increasing for longer wavelength in the infrared range)36,39 and that the signals of trapped electrons and holes do not decay in the single exponential way (components τ1 and τ2 in Fig. 3A). Fig. 3C and D present the kinetics at 600 nm (dominated by holes) and 1100 nm (dominated by electrons). As can be seen, the dynamics of hole decay is similar for SC30dil, SP30dil and SP30 layers (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the decay of electrons is significantly slower for SP30dil and SP30 layers than for SC30dil and SC18dil ones (Fig. 3D), indicating the difference in the distribution of trapped states below the titania conduction band. The decay of holes at 600 nm was analyzed at different excitation fluence (Fig. 3C). The higher the initial amplitude (and thus the population of the charges), the faster the decay. It can be justified by the contribution of second order process (hole-electron radiative recombination). Indeed, the mixed first and second order fit (see SI for the function definition) reveals trap-assisted first order rate constants k1 = 1 ns−1 and second order rate constant k2 = 3.4 ns−1 (mΔA)−1 (absorbance signal is used instead of charge concentration, because of difficult estimation of the latter). The fit is not perfect (Fig. 3C), which is probably due to the effect of the diffusion of charges in the sample of a certain thickness (therefore, the initial density of charges changes in time). The contribution of the second order process in the measured range of excitation fluence at 310 nm (0.5–4 mJ cm−2) varies from 81% to 98%.
3.4. Transient absorption of L-DSSC
Next, the transient absorption results for solar cell samples with different titania layers are presented and compared. L-DSSC, PSC and S-DSSC were excited at 500 nm, at which the light is absorbed by the active materials (MK2 dye or triple cation perovskite) and not by TiO2. The measurements for L-DSSC refer to a 20 days old cell, whose parameters were slightly improved with respect to the as-obtained one (Table 1B). The pump pulse was directed from the titania side and excitation fluence for L-DSSC was 100 μJ cm−2. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the exemplary spectra of CBpy/SP30dil sample at selected time delays between the pump and probe pulses, while representative pseudo-color 2D spectra of transient absorption data are presented in Fig. 4A and B.
 Fig. 4  Pseudo-color 2D spectra of original transient absorption data for L-DSSC with SP30dil and SP30 titania layers (A and B). Examples of the global analysis of transient absorption data using a two-exponential function with a constant offset for L-DSSC samples (C–F). The graphs present pre-exponential factor spectra associated to the indicated time constants. The pump fluence was 100 μJ cm−2 and IRF was 0.3 ps. 
The transient absorption spectra and their evolution are analogous to those reported by us earlier for L-DSSC with MK2 dye.25,26,40,41 Similarly, global analysis assuming a two-exponential function and constant offset was employed to extract the characteristic time constants. The representative results are presented in Fig. 4C–F. The constant offset component with a bleach band below 650 nm (corresponding to stationary absorption of MK2 dye – compare with Fig. 2A) and a positive band with a maximum at 750 nm is assigned to the oxidized dye. Thus, its amplitude with respect to the initial one is proportional to the number of successfully separated charge carriers. The relative amplitude of the positive band is higher for the cells with CDCA (CBpy, Fig. 4C and D) than for those without co-adsorbent (Phen, Fig. 4E and F). It agrees with the higher total APCE values for the former than for the latter samples (Table 1B), and is in line with our previous findings.25
The pre-exponential factor spectra of the second, longer component (τ2 in the range from 130 to 180 ps, slightly faster for Phen than CBpy cells) have the shape similar to that of the constant offset spectra. Therefore, the second component is assigned to the recombination of injected electron from titania to MK2 dye, decreasing the population of the oxidized dye. Finally, the fastest extracted component (τ1 of several ps) is the only one for which the small but systematic differences between SP30dil and SP30 samples can be observed. This component should be ascribed to the fast part of electron recombination (that occurs over many time scales), but it is also influenced by the electron injection; therefore, its pre-exponential factor spectra are different than those of τ2 and constant offset components. In particular, the electron injection is accompanied with the decay of the S1 state of the dye, and e.g. the indentation in the spectra in 600–750 nm range is due to the stimulated emission (Fig. 4C–F).26 It is more visible in CBpy than Phen samples because, as we analyzed in more details earlier, the electron injection is slower for MK2 with CDCA than without CDCA.25 Nevertheless, the electron injection times are below 1 ps in both cases, so the differences in values of τ1 are mainly due to electron recombination. Thus, the fast component of recombination is slightly slower in the samples with the diluted titania phase (τ1 of about 6 ps with respect to 4 ps for undiluted samples, Fig. 4C–F), which is beneficial for charge separation. It might be explained by a closer distance between the dyes on titania nanoparticle surface in SP30 than SP30dil layer, which enhance fast recombination.25,41 Although dye loading is higher in SP30dil cells than SP30 ones, it is the loading per the layer thickness that we consider, and due to higher porosity of SP30dil than SP30 layer, the average distance between adjacent dyes might be even larger in SP30dil than SP30. It should be also noted that the charge transfer processes observed on the time scales up to few nanoseconds are only related to the interaction between dye molecules and single TiO2 nanoparticle. Different titania thickness in DSSC samples can affect the kinetics on much longer time scales (e.g. electron transport through the titania nanoparticles net or titania-redox couple recombination).
3.5. Transient absorption of PSC
We will discuss now the transient absorption results obtained for as-obtained PSC. Fig. S8 (ESI†) presents the exemplary spectra at different time delays between the pump and probe pulses while representative pseudo-color 2D spectra of transient absorption data are shown in Fig. 5A and B. They are similar to many previous reports on standard MAPbI3 perovskites,42–50 including our studies,28,51,52 as well as to our recent studies of the same triple cation perovskite compositions prepared under drybox or ambient air conditions.53 The initial changes at times below 1 ps are due to the charge carrier relaxation.43,45,46,54 After that, the signals are dominated by the strong and sharp negative bleach close to the absorption edge, appearing due to the band filling mechanism and being proportional to the population of the excited carriers.42,46,47 The decay of this signal is due to the charge recombination, charge diffusion and charge transfer to contact layers (electron injection into TiO2 and hole injection into spiro-OMeTAD).44,49,52,55
 Fig. 5  Pseudo-color 2D spectra of original transient absorption data (A and B). Examples of the global analysis of transient absorption data using three-exponential function for PSC samples. The graphs present pre-exponential factor spectra associated to the indicated time constants. The pump fluence was 30 μJ cm−2 and IRF was 0.3 ps. 
To compare the charge dynamics in PSC with SC30dil and SC18dil layers, the global multi-exponential analysis was employed, similarly as in our previous studies.28,51,52 As we have discussed,52 the exponential functions (being the solution of the first order kinetic equations) do not strictly follow the kinetics of charge population, which include e.g. second order radiative recombination and charge diffusion.47,48,56 However, the fitted time constants of exponential components and the associated pre-exponential factor spectra can be used to identify the occurring processes and compare their characteristic, average times. Fig. 5C–F shows the results of 3-exponential global analysis of the data obtained with the excitation fluence 30 μJ cm−2 from both ETM (TiO2) and HTM (spiro-OMeTAD) sides.
Due to the high absorbance of the samples at the excitation wavelength (A > 3 at 500 nm, see Fig. 2B), the initial excitation of perovskite is localized close to the contact layers, therefore the excitations from different sides of PSC probe more selectively the charge transfer to one, particular layer (ETM or HTM). The first, sub picosecond component has a shape characteristic of the band-edge shift, which is due to charge cooling and/or exciton dissociation.43,45,46 Its value of τ1 = 0.3 ps is the same for the samples with SC30dil and SC18dil titania layers. In contrast, the next two time components (having the amplitude spectra dominated by the bleach signal and showing the charge population decay) are always shorter for SC30dil than SC18dil layers, which indicates that the electron transfer to titania is faster for SC30dil cells with a higher photocurrent. The spectrum of the second component (τ2, from 100 to 300 ps in Fig. 5C–F) is usually blue-shifted with respect to that of the third one (τ3, in the nanosecond range) because the charges filling the bands of higher energy depopulate faster.52 It should be noted that the fitted time constant are only partly related to the charge injection times, because they are strongly affected by the second order charge recombination within the perovskite, as evidenced e.g. by the higher values of τ2 and τ3 at lower excitation fluence (10 μJ cm−2, see Fig. S9, ESI†).
To simplify the comparison between SC30dil and SC18dil layers, we have also performed 2-exponential global analysis,51 in which the second component reflects the average charge population decay (despite poor fit quality, at least for the excitation fluence 30 μJ cm−2). The obtained mean values are the following: τAVG (SC30dil, ETM side) = 1.9 ns, τAVG (SC30dil, HTM side) = 2.5 ns, τAVG (SC18dil, ETM side) = 3.3 ns and τAVG (SC18dil, HTM side) = 3.3 ns, all with the error ± 0.1 ns based on standard deviation from 4-7 measurements.
As can be seen, the charge decay is faster for SC30dil than SC18dil samples, which is also visualized by the comparison of kinetics at bleach maximum presented in Fig. 6A or the pseudo-color 2D spectra in Fig. 5A and B. Moreover, the difference is higher for the excitation at ETM side where the contribution of electron injection to titania is higher than that at HTM side. Therefore, it confirms that the faster electron injection from the perovskite to TiO2 is responsible for the observed faster bleach recovery dynamics in the SC30dil samples, because all other parameters that might influence the population decay (excitation fluence, perovskite layer thickness, HTM material) are the same in both samples. However, it should be noted that the magnitude of lifetime shortening do not directly represent the values of intrinsic electron injection times, which might be much shorter than nanoseconds due to the occurrence of charge diffusion process. For example, it was shown that the half-decay of the bleach signal of the perovskite layer studied (of 80 nm in thickness) can decrease from 4 ns to 2 ns when the intrinsic electron transfer time is shortened from 50 ps to 10 ps.47
 Fig. 6  Normalized kinetics for PSC measured from ETM side at the maximum of the bleach signal for SC18dil and SC30dil layers (A). Transient absorption spectra for PSC with SC30dil layer measured at 100 ps for different consecutive cycles at ETM (B) and HTM (C) sides. The pump fluence was 30 μJ cm−2 in A–C. Normalized kinetics for L-DSSC and S-DSSC measured at 750 nm (D). 
Finally, we would also like to address another important issue related to the interface between triple-cation perovskite and the titania layer. In our recent contribution we have reported the differences in morphology (PbI2 content) and spectra between the perovskite close to ETM and that near HTM interface.53 In particular, the transient bleach band showed additional red-shifted spectral features of perovskite close to ETM side. One of the proposed explanations was the ion segregation leading to different ratios of bromide/iodide close to the TiO2 that could modify the bandgap.57 This effect can be enhanced by irradiation.58 In the study presented here we provide more evidence for this mechanism by comparing the changes in transient absorption spectra during the following cycles in the femtosecond experiment (each cycle lasted about 3 minutes). As can be seen in Fig. 6, upon increasing irradiation time, some clear changes (with isosbestic point) of bleach spectrum at 100 ps are observed at ETM side (Fig. 6B), while no such changes are visible at HTM side (Fig. 6C). This result was obtained for the PSC/SC30dil sample showing high photocurrent. On the contrary, for worse performing PSC/SC18dil cell the changes on ETM side were much smaller (Fig. S10A, ESI†). We have also passivated SC30dil layer by sensitization with MK2 dye (before perovskite deposition). For such test PSC the photocurrent was very small (total APCE = 0.61) and the changes on ETM side were also hardly observed (Fig. S10B, ESI†). Therefore, the photoinduced bleach changes near TiO2 (due to probable ion segregation in mixed halide perovskite) occur efficiently only for the cells with high photocurrent. It is consistent with the recent supposition that ion segregation is enhanced by hole accumulation at the interface where electrons were efficiently injected.58
3.6. Transient absorption of S-DSSC
In the last section we will present the transient absorption data measured for the as-obtained S-DSSC. Similarly as in the previous sections, the representative spectra at selected time delays are shown in ESI† (Fig. S11), while representative pseudo-color 2D spectra of transient absorption data are shown in Fig. 7A. Fig. 7B–D presents the results of the global fit using the same model as for L-DSSC (two-exponential function with constant offset). The results for solid state cells should be compared with those of liquid solar cell made with the same dye (Fig. 4C–F).
 Fig. 7  Pseudo-color 2D spectra of original transient absorption data for S-DSSC with SP30dil titania layer (A). Examples of the global analysis of transient absorption data using two-exponential function with constant offset for S-DSSC samples with the indicated titania layers: SC30dil (B), SP30dil (C) and SP30 (D). The graphs present pre-exponential factor spectra associated to the indicated time constants. The pump fluence was 100 μJ cm−2, IRF was 0.3 ps and the excitation was from HTM side. 
The most important differences are the smaller contribution of the constant offset component and the shorter times τ1 and τ2 for S-DSSC (Fig. 7B–D) with respect to those of L-DSSC (Fig. 4C–F). The time constants obtained from the global fit are about three times shorter for S-DSSC than those for L-DSSC. The difference can be also clearly visualized by comparing the kinetics at the maximum of the oxidized dye band (750 nm), which are presented in Fig. 6D. Therefore, the additional quenching of the oxidized dye is observed for S-DSSC, which should be explained by fast regeneration of the dye by spiro-OMeTAD. In our systems, such a hole transfer occurs on the time scale of single and tens of ps. In the cells with liquid electrolyte the dye regeneration by redox couple (e.g. cobalt complex or iodide/iodine pair) occurs on the time scale of μs, but the hole injection from solid HTM can occur much faster, even competing with electron injection. Such a fast dye regeneration has been reported for several systems,6 however, according to our knowledge, we show it for the first time for the popular carbazole dyes and spiro-OMeTAD.
In principle, the observed quenching of the oxidized MK2 dye in S-DSSC could be also explained by greatly enhanced electron recombination.33 However, the decrease in the total APCE of S-DSSC is not more than half with respect to that of L-DSSC (Table 1), so we could expect not more than twice decrease in the residual signal in transient absorption.25 The drop in the residual amplitude for S-DSSC is much larger than that, therefore, the quenching must be dominated by the fast hole transfer. Moreover, we can observe a clear correlation of the relative amplitude of constant offset component and lifetimes with the thickness of the mesoporous layer (Fig. 7B–D). The residual signal is the smallest and the time constants τ1 and τ2 are the shortest for SC30dil sample (thickness 150–200 nm). For SP30dil sample (1.3–1.5 μm) the values are intermediate, while for the thickest SP30 layer (2.5–3 μm) the residual signal is the strongest and the time constants are the longest. As mentioned before, the problem in S-DSSC is the penetration of spiro-OMeTAD to deep parts of the mesoporous layer for the thickness above 1 μm. The limited penetration of HTM into titania can thus explain the trends we observe for SC30dil, SP30dil and SP30: spiro-OMeTAD is probably not in contact with all dyes for SP30dil and especially for SP30, so their regeneration is slowed down. The observed differences in the quenching yield of oxidized MK2 by HTM correlates with the relative photocurrent (total APCE) of the cells: the highest for SC30dil and the lowest for SP30 layers (Table 1C). It is in agreement with the previous reports about higher photocurrent in S-DSSC for better spiro-OMeTAD penetration and higher hole transfer yield.59–61
Finally, another confirmation of poor pore filling in SP30 samples comes from the analysis of the decomposition of the samples during transient absorption measurements (Table S4, ESI†). When the cell with SP30 layer is excited from ETM side (which is hard to be reached by spiro-OMeTAD) a significant decrease (more than 12%) in the transient absorption signal for the consecutive cycles of the experiment is found. For the same SP30 sample excited from HTM side, and for SC30dil and SC30dil samples excited at both sides, the changes in the signals are much smaller and probably random. The fast photodegradation under femtosecond pulse excitation occurs when the dyes are not in contact with regenerating medium (e.g. in the isolated sensitized electrodes) because the lifetime of the reactive oxidized state is very long.6
To summarize the transient absorption parts, the results prove that efficient charge transfer from perovskite to TiO2 is responsible for improved performance in PSCs utilizing larger particle size. For DSSC utilizing liquid electrolyte a weaker electron recombination in TiO2 films prepared with diluted TiO2 is observed. For solid HTM based DSSC higher regeneration rates are observed for spin coated TiO2 films whereas slower regeneration rates in screen printed films is found.
4. Conclusions
Improvement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSC) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) upon modifications of mesoporous titania layers has been studied. Its impact on the charge transfer dynamics in the complete solar cells as well as in pristine TiO2 layers have been investigated by femtosecond transient absorption.
For PSC with triple cation perovskite (FA0.76 MA0.19 Cs0.05 Pb (I0.81 Br0.19)3) the best efficiency of ∼18% and photocurrent of ∼24 mA cm−2 were obtained for homogenous TiO2 mesoporous layer made of 30 nm nanoparticles and with the thickness 150–200 nm. For about twice thicker, less homogenous and made of smaller particles (diameter 18 nm) titania layer, the best efficiency of only ∼11% and photocurrent of ∼17 mA cm−2 were found. Shorter photocarriers lifetime in perovskite material was observed for the more efficient cells with respect to those with a worse TiO2 layer (e.g. the average lifetime 1.9 ns vs. 3.3 ns when excited from TiO2 side by 30 μJ cm−2 pulse at 500 nm). It indicates that faster electron transfer from perovskite to the optimized TiO2 is responsible for the higher photocurrent in these triple-cation PSC. Moreover, for better TiO2 layer the photoinduced changes (appearance of red-shifted feature) in transient bleach signal were revealed, which may indicate the occurrence of halide segregation in perovskite close to TiO2 interface.
For DSSC, the effect of dilution of the commercial titania paste has been explored for popular MK2 dye and liquid cobalt-based electrolyte or solid state hole transporter (spiro-OMeTAD). The rise in the photovoltage (up to ∼0.9 V), higher dye loading per layer thickness and the improvement in relative photocurrent were observed for the liquid cells prepared from the diluted paste (2:1 w/w ratio) with respect to those obtained for the cells prepared from undiluted one. The best efficiency of ∼4.5% was obtained for DSSC having the titania mesoporous layer of thickness as small as 1.3–1.5 μm and in the absence of scattering layer. The dynamics of electron injection and recombination was similar in the cells with both diluted and undiluted titania pastes. However, the fast component of unwanted recombination was slightly slower (by about 30%) in the samples with the diluted titania phase than in those made with undiluted ones.
For solid state DSSC, the use of diluted paste results in higher voltage and better relative photocurrent, similar to those of liquid DSSC. The transient absorption studies reveal that the hole injection from MK2 dye to spiro-OMeTAD takes place on the very fast ps time scale (comparable to that of electron injection) and the evidence of the deeper penetration of spiro-OMeTAD into the mesoporous titania is presented.
Moreover, all titania layers (for PSC and DSSC) have been also studied separately in other transient absorption experiments by direct excitation in UV range and observation of electron and hole dynamics. The transient signals of different species have been identified in distinct spectral regions and compared between the samples of different layers: free and trapped electrons from 800 to 1500 nm, trapped holes around 600 nm and thermal artifacts below 400 nm. The decay of free electrons was observed to occur mainly with the time constants <1 ps, and the recombination of holes and electrons took place in the combined first and second order processes. The decay of trapped electrons was slower in the thicker titania layers used for DSSC than in the thinner layers in PSC.
