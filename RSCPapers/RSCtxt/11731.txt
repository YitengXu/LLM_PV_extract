    , Accepted 12th August 2022First published on 16th August 2022AbstractRenewable energies from solar and wind power are playing an ever increasing role in meeting the tremendous global energy demand with substantially reduced carbon emissions; however, their intermittent nature poses a critical challenge for sustainability and practical applications. The capability of solid oxide cells (SOCs) to operate in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes makes them one of the most important candidates for efficient storage and regeneration of renewable energies. Here we present a critical review and prospects on the development of key fabrication techniques, e.g. wet infiltration, exsolution and direct assembly, for nanostructured electrodes, one of the most critical issues affecting the performance and stability of SOC technologies. The traits and challenges of these techniques are thoroughly discussed, with an aim to provide a critical guide for future design and development of more refined, high-performing nanostructured electrodes for SOCs.
The increasing demand for energy, depletion of fossil fuels and global necessity for mitigating carbon emissions make it urgent to search for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. However, the intermittent feature of renewable energy poses a significant challenge to meet the demand of consumers, and therefore it is vital to develop effective and reliable energy storage and regeneration technologies. Solid oxide cells (SOCs) are such an electrochemical device that can reversibly operate in the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode to store renewable electricity in fuels such as hydrogen and in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode to regenerate the electricity using the stored fuel wherever and whenever needed. Fig. 1 shows the operating principles of SOCs based on oxide-ion and proton conducting electrolytes, denoted as O-SOCs and H-SOCs, respectively. The main difference between O-SOCs and H-SOCs is that, in the case of H-SOCs, the ions migrating through the proton conducting electrolyte are protons rather than oxygen ions. Thus, water is introduced or produced at the oxygen/air electrode side, rather than at the hydrogen/fuel electrode side, as in the case of an oxide-ion conducting electrolyte. SOCs are known for their highest energy conversion efficiency among the fuel cell families, and their electrolysis efficiency is also higher than other water electrolysis technologies such as alkaline electrolysers and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.1,2

The output performance of SOCs is critically dependent on the electrocatalytic activity for the reactions at the electrodes. The state-of-the-art materials for SOCs include yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, Ni-based cermet hydrogen electrodes such as Ni-YSZ composites, and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+δ (LSM)-YSZ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF) air electrodes. The representative reactions at the SOC electrodes based on an oxide-ion conducting electrolyte are as follows: Air electrode: O2 + 4e− ⇔ 2O2−(1) Hydrogen electrode: H2 + O2− ⇔ H2O + 2e−(2)
As electrons, oxygen ions and gases are involved in the reactions, continuous ionic, electronic and gas pathways are required for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) at the air electrode and the hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) at the hydrogen electrode. LSM is a predominantly electronic conductor and YSZ is an ionic conductor, and therefore the ORR/OER at the LSM-based electrodes mainly occurs at the three-phase boundaries (TPBs) between LSM, YSZ and O2. Similarly, the TPBs between Ni, YSZ and H2 at the Ni-YSZ hydrogen electrode provide the major sites for the HER/HOR. Therefore, the creation of sufficient TPBs is vital to gain a highly active SOC electrode. However, the conventional electrode fabrication processes involve a high-temperature sintering step (900–1350 °C), which leads to drastic microstructure coarsening and a loss of active sites for the electrochemical reactions.
A variety of strategies have been undertaken to design and fabricate nanostructured electrodes so as to maximize the reaction sites and the length of TPBs. Initially this was realized by lowering the sintering temperature to as low as 750–850 °C, and the key to enhance the sinterability of electrodes was either by reducing the particle size of the starting powder or by adding a sintering aid to the electrodes.3–7 A much more popular approach to rationally design a nanostructured electrode is to incorporate nanoparticles into a pre-sintered scaffold via solution infiltration, followed by heat-treatment at a moderate temperature of 600–900 °C.8–16 For example, the infiltration of undoped and doped ceria nanoparticles has been extensively shown to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity and operational stability of hydrogen and air electrodes against the attack by various impurities.17–22 Also, an in situ exsolution approach has been proven effective in producing uniformly dispersed electrocatalytic nanoparticles on the surface of oxide electrodes.23–27 A recently developed direct assembly approach offers a facile means for the fabrication of nanostructured electrodes without the conventional high-temperature sintering processes, retaining the ultrafine microstructure of the as-synthesized powder.28 Other advanced fabrication techniques such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) and sputtering have also been explored for the development of advanced electrodes of SOCs.29–33 Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of commercial viability and industrial applications, the potential availability of fabrication techniques for nanostructured electrodes critically depends on the fabrication cost and ease of scalability.
The current article focuses on the brief review of the development of several extensively investigated fabrication techniques for nanostructured electrodes including wet infiltration, exsolution and direct assembly, and particular attention is placed on discussing the capability and prospects of these techniques for the development of future SOC technologies.
Nano-scale fabrication techniques
For an electrode in SOCs, it is desirable to decrease the size of the anode/cathode particles down to the nanoscale, as a smaller particle size generally shows better catalytic activity due to a larger surface area. Therefore, the performance of SOCs can be significantly enhanced by constructing a nanostructured electrode architecture. Typically, nano-scale electrodes can be fabricated by either lowering the electrode calcination temperature or introducing nano-catalysts in situ/ex situ (internally/externally) to the electrode backbone. So far, wet impregnation or infiltration, in situ exsolution and direct assembly are the most important and investigated nano-scale electrode fabrication techniques in SOCs.
Wet infiltration has been popular in the SOC community for more than two decades due to its effectiveness in boosting the performance of electrodes.11 As the name suggests, infiltration, or so-called impregnation, is a technique that introduces an external phase (nanocatalyst) into the SOC electrode backbone, followed by low temperature sintering to preserve its nanosize. Prior to infiltration, the electrode backbone is pre-sintered on the electrolyte with sufficient porosity. The precursor solution of the functional phase is then infiltrated into the backbone by a syringe, with precisely controlled loading. The infiltration is often repeated several times to achieve the desired loading. Following low temperature sintering, the nanocatalysts form and attach to the electrode backbone. Fig. 2 shows the flowchart of the entire infiltration process.

One distinct advantage of the infiltration method is that the functional nanocatalyst introduced can be highly diverse and flexible, depending on the needs of the application. Usually, the nanocatalysts impart additional or reinforced properties to the backbones, e.g. improved electrocatalytic activity, alleviated stability issues, better tolerance to coking and sulfur poisoning, etc.12,34 For example, in order to improve the anode performance and robustness in hydrocarbon and sulfur containing fuels, Luo et al. deposited functional phases into the Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (BZCYYb) anode.35 By taking advantage of the hydrophilic nature of BZCYYb, the infiltrated PrBaMn2O5+δ (PBM) water solution got attracted and held strongly to the BZCYYb. This led to the formation of PBM double perovskite nanoaggregates which fully encapsulated the BZCYYb grains, while Ni grains were left uncovered, as shown in Fig. 3b. Without such a unique feature, more PBM must be infiltrated into the anode to completely cover BZCYYb, which either was practically infeasible or severely impeded the mass transfer in the anode. Following a similar protocol, 1.5 wt.% Ni4Co was infiltrated into the anode as well (see Fig. 3a). Eventually, the infiltrated protonic fuel cell showed a peak power density (PPD) of 2.1 W cm−2 in H2 and 1.25 W cm−2 in CH4–CO2 (50:50) at 700 °C (see Fig. 3c). In 50 ppm H2S-containing CH4–CO2 under a constant current density of 1 A cm−2, the cell showed a stable power output for 36 h, giving a power density of ≈ 810 mW cm−2 and yielding highly concentrated syngas in the exhaust (>95%). The selective deposition of electrocatalysts and the building of bifunctional nanoarchitectures provided an effective way to efficiently power SOFCs. Moreover, Liu et al. managed to boost the performance and durability of ammonia PCFCs by simply infiltrating a small amount of Fe nanoparticles into the Ni-BZCYYb anode. With a loading of 0.36 mg cm−2, the Fe infiltrated Ni-BZCYYb|BZCYYb|PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cell achieved a dramatically enhanced performance, with a peak power density (PPD) of 1.25 W cm−2 at 650 °C in ammonia. The cell demonstrated excellent durability when operated at 0.5 A cm−2 and 650 °C for 100 h in ammonia. The superior activity and durability of the Fe infiltrated Ni/BZCYYb anode were attributed to the alternation of NH3 adsorption strength and N2 desorption barrier heights.

Since the infiltrated phase intends to reduce the porosity of the pre-sintered backbones, the loading of the functional nanocatalysts is generally limited to ∼5 wt%. Nevertheless, with proper optimization of the backbone porosity and other infiltration conditions, the loading can be increased notably. Instead of infiltrating additional nanocatalysts into the electrode, Chen et al. managed to infiltrate a significant amount of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM), roughly ∼1.7 mg cm−2, into a porous YSZ backbone.36 The YSZ backbone layer was sintered at 1200 °C to ensure good porosity and had a thickness of 20–25 μm. According to the SEM analysis, the infiltrated LSM particles (∼70 nm, calcined at 900 °C) distributed uniformly in the YSZ backbone, without blocking the gas pathway (see Fig. 4). The infiltrated LSM-YSZ electrodes exhibited an electrode polarization resistance as low as 0.21 Ω cm2 at 800 °C and were relatively stable during electrolysis operation at 500 mA cm−2 for 100 h. Similarly, in order to fabricate an SOFC anode with excellent performance, Irvine et al. infiltrated ∼45 wt% La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) into a porous YSZ backbone (∼65% porosity).37 The infiltrated LSCM formed a uniform film over the YSZ backbone, and the LSCM-YSZ composite anode was found to possess a long TPB length due to the film cracking after being exposed to reducing conditions. The LSCM infiltrated cell showed a high PPD of ∼900 mW cm−2 at 800 °C in humidified H2. The capability of infiltrating a relatively large amount of nanocatalysts (e.g. 4–10 wt%) provides a feasible alternative to fabricate composite electrodes. Compared to the conventional composite electrode preparation (i.e. mechanically mixing electrode and electrolyte particles), infiltrating electrode nanoparticles into the electrolyte scaffold not only bypasses the high temperature calcination procedure, but also preserves the nanostructure of the electrode particles. In addition, the pre-sintered electrolyte scaffold can form a much better connected ion-conducting network, thus improving the ionic diffusion. Nevertheless, the loading of the infiltrated phase is difficult to reach 30–40 wt% as required by conventional composite electrodes due to the limitation posed by the available pore space (i.e., porosity) of the scaffold.

The most evident issue of infiltration is that the infiltrated particles tend to agglomerate with time and thus degrade the SOC performance. Since the infiltrated nanoparticles are not sintered at high temperatures, they cannot form stable and strong bonding with the backbone. Therefore, during the long-term SOC operation (∼700–900 °C), the infiltrated nanoparticles tend to migrate and agglomerate with each other. The coalescence of the electrode nanoparticles would eventually lead to the performance degradation of the cell. For example, Wang et al. studied the stability of 40 wt.% La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) infiltrated YSZ composite cathodes at 700 °C and, for the LSF-YSZ cathodes calcined at 850 °C, the ASR was found to increase linearly with time, from 0.13 to 0.55 Ω cm2, after 2500 h at 700 °C.38 It was suggested that the deactivation of the composite cathode was associated with a decrease in the LSF surface area and the formation of a dense LSF layer over YSZ due to the sintering of LSF. For the Pd nanoparticle infiltrated YSZ scaffold cathode, we observed the agglomeration and grain growth of Pd nanoparticles after SOFC testing at 750 °C for 30 h.39 As shown in Fig. 5, the formation of continuous and dense Pd films on the YSZ scaffold surface led to an increase in the polarization loss due to the loss of active sites and blocking of the oxygen diffusion path.

Another notable issue of infiltration is that the fabrication process is very time-consuming. Generally, to achieve a good amount of nanoparticle loading and uniform distribution, the infiltration process needs to be repeated several times. Such repetitive infiltration/annealing operations not only consume a great deal of time, but also add up to the fabrication cost. Moreover, although the application of infiltration in large and practical planar cells (∼100 cm2) has been reported,40,41 it is still challenging to have the infiltrated nanoparticles dispersed evenly. Precise control of infiltration conditions, e.g. precursor solution concentration, surfactant, loading, the number of repetitions and annealing conditions, therefore becomes essential to acquire the desired electrode nanostructure with well-dispersed nanocatalysts.
Thus, despite the multi-step nature associated with the infiltration technique, nanoscale engineering of electrode architectures via infiltration is probably the most effective pathway to develop highly active and advanced electrode nanostructures for SOCs. However, for further optimization of the technique, one needs to address the critical issue of a weak particle–scaffold interface to suppress the agglomeration of the introduced nanocatalysts and to substantially increase the structural stability of the infiltrated nanocatalysts.
Exsolution refers to a method in which catalytically active metals, predominantly transitional metals (Ni, Fe, Co, etc.), are doped into the crystal lattice of a parent oxide, forming a single-phase solid solution under oxidizing conditions (such as in air), and released as nanoclusters or nanoparticles on the surface of the oxide following extrinsic reduction, such as exposure to a H2 atmosphere or application of a cathodic potential.42Fig. 6 shows the structural evolution through exsolution and an example of the surface microstructure of La0.8Ce0.1Ni0.4Ti0.6O3 after exsolution.43,44 Exsolution is typically employed in materials with the ABO3 perovskite structure, which is well known for its flexibility in accommodating various dopants and, consequently, versatility in modifying the structures, properties and functionalities of materials. The exsolved nanoparticles are highly active, and since they feature a socketed interface structure with the backbone material, the nanoparticles are also resistant to agglomeration and carbon deposition.45,46

The exsolution-derived nanostructure has been utilized for a wide range of applications including SOCs. Although the exsolution concept was first illustrated in a Pd-doped perovskite system in 2002,47 the flourishing of its application has occurred after a systematic exsolution study reported in 2013.42 Since then, the application of exsolved materials in SOCs has been increasing exponentially. The exsolution can be tuned by factors such as the stoichiometry, surface characteristics of the parent material, oxygen partial pressure, electrochemical bias, etc. In 2013, Tsekouras et al. examined the performance of Ni exsolved La0.4Sr0.4Ni0.06Ti0.94O3−δ (LSNT) as the cathode for SOEC steam electrolysis and found that Ni exsolution led to step-changes in steam electrolysis performance, with a current density (j) of 0.19 A cm−2 at 1.6 V and 900 °C in 47% H2O/53% N2. In 2015, Sun et al. prepared A-site deficient Ni-doped (La0.7Sr0.3)CrO3 (LSCNi) for SOFC anodes, and the exsolution of abundant Ni nanoparticles remarkably increased the conductivity and catalytic activity of the materials.48 The PPD of the exsolved cell was 460 mW cm−2 in 5000 ppm H2S–H2, substantially higher than 135 mW cm−2 obtained on the cell with no Ni nanoparticle exsolution on a stoichiometric LSCNi electrode. These early reported SOC performances are still not satisfactory, mainly due to the low activity of the fuel electrode materials themselves as well as the thick electrolyte support. Continuous efforts have been devoted to the material design and cell structure optimization to improve the performance of the SOCs. In 2016, Myung et al. innovatively applied a high electrolysis voltage (∼2 V) to the titanate fuel electrode and found that the exsolution of a large number of fine Ni nanoparticles was triggered instantly (within approximately a couple of minutes).49 The voltage-driven Ni exsolution/reduction was found to be much more effective as compared to the lengthy chemical reduction process (approximately tens of hours). The SOC performance was ‘switched on’ drastically, achieving a PPD of ∼2 W cm−2 at 900 °C in 3% H2O/H2 in the SOFC mode and a j of 2.75 A cm−2 at 1.3 V and 900 °C in 50% H2O/H2 in the SOEC mode.
Apart from sole metal exsolution, alloy nanoparticle exsolution can impart additional functionalities to the exsolved materials. For example, it has been suggested that Fe doping in (La0.7Sr0.3)(Cr0.85Ni0.15–xFex)O3−δ (LSCNi-Fe, x = 0.0375) not only altered the reduction behavior of the material but also increased the amount of oxygen vacancies.50 The exsolved bimetallic Ni–Fe nanoparticles promoted the SOFC performance in 5000 ppm H2S–H2 fuel, exhibiting a PPD of ∼600 mW cm−2 at 800 °C (compared to ∼500 mW cm−2 for LSCNi). Ni–Fe alloy exsolution is also instrumental in improving the SOEC performance. Liu et al. investigated the activity of an Fe–Ni exsolved La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (LSFN) cathode for CO2 electrolysis.51 The results indicate that Fe-Ni exsolution significantly improved the cathode kinetics for CO2 electrolysis, with a high j of 1.78 A cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 98.8% at 1.6 V and 850 °C. The exsolved cathode material also displayed superior tolerance to carbon deposition. Moreover, in some studies the exsolved Co–Fe alloy particles were found to be capable of redissolving into and regenerating from the substrate lattice under specific conditions. Lai et al. presented a perovskite SOFC anode material, La0.3Sr0.7Cr0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3−δ (LSCrFeCo), which allowed exsolution (upon reduction) and dissolution (upon oxidation) of Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles at 700 °C. The Co–Fe nanocatalysts improved the PPD of the LSCrFeCo-GDC composite anode more than 75% in comparison to that of the cobalt-free counterpart; the self-regenerated anode (i.e. dissolving and regenerating Co–Fe nanoparticles) can drive away carbon deposition in propane fuel and facilitate catalytic reactivation by the redox cycles.52
Exsolution of alloy nanoparticles can also be fulfilled by combining infiltration and in situ exsolution techniques. An interesting study published by Guntae et al. reported a smart selective exsolution process to produce Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles through topotactic ion exchange (see Fig. 7), where infiltrated Fe guest cations exchanged with the Co host cations in PrBaMn1.7Co0.3O5+δ (PBMCo).53 Such a process yields the host PrBaMn1.7Fe0.3O5+δ (PBMF), liberating all the Co cations from the host lattice, thus leading to an increase in the number of exsolved nanoparticles. According to the DFT calculation, the topotactic cation exchange between Co and Fe occurred spontaneously due to the favorable incorporation energy (−0.41 eV) and exchange energy (−0.34 eV) for the infiltration of the guest material Fe on the host material PBMCo. The PPD of the PBMCo-Fe cell reached as high as 1.83 W cm−2 in humidified H2 (3% H2O) at 800 °C, as displayed in Fig. 7c.

The exsolution of nano-phases can be used in air electrodes and in oxidative environments as well. Han et al.54 constructed low polarization resistance heterostructures by exsolving (Ni,Fe) nanoparticles from the Sr0.95Ti0.3Fe0.6Ni0.1O3−δ backbone in a reducing atmosphere, which were subsequently re-oxidized as (Ni,Fe)Ox decorated cathodes. The constructed heterostructure effectively facilitated the oxygen reduction reaction and reduced the polarization resistance by about 50%. In addition, Chen et al. also found that the polarization can effectively induce exsolution and the polarization-induced exsolution of Pd/PdO nanoparticles from the (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1)0.95Pd0.05O3−δ (LSCFNPd) air electrode contributes to the evident enhancement of electrocatalytic activity.55
However, although the exsolution technique can offer many outstanding properties to the base material, the metal species that can be exsolved are often limited to reducible cations, such as Ni, Fe, Co and other transition metals. The limited number of nano-catalyst species, regardless of singular or alloyed, may restrict the electrode materials for applications with varying requirements from selective production of chemicals through high activity for gas reforming or cracking to high tolerance for contaminants in the feed gas. In addition, the size and population of exsolved nanoparticles are sensitive to many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as the stoichiometry and particle size of the electrode, reduction conditions and electrical bias. Therefore, the properties of the exsolved material, even with the same composition, may differ significantly between different research groups. This poses evident challenges to the quality control and reproducibility of the electrode nanostructure, and further complicates the fundamental understanding of the structure–property relationship originating from the exsolution. The additional reduction step also increases the cost of SOC fabrication processes.
For future design of the exsolution-derived electrode nanostructure, it is important to improve the diversity of the exsolved species to cope with varying application requirements. This could be achieved by binary/ternary alloy exsolution, metal oxide and metal co-exsolution (e.g. CeO2–Ni), combining infiltration with exsolution, etc. Equally important is the fundamental investigation of the exsolution driving forces, in-depth nanoparticle generation processes and determining factors, which will be a key to control and reproduce the exsoluted nanostructure.
Direct assembly is developed in order to overcome the limitations of low loading of wet infiltration and low selectivity of the active phase of exsolution techniques based on the polarization induced electrode/electrolyte interface phenomena.56 In this technique, electrode materials (mainly air electrodes) are directly applied to the electrolyte without subsequent high temperature calcination (e.g., >1000 °C) and therefore retain their nano-size and a strong electrode/electrolyte interface is established by in situ electrochemical polarization at cell operation temperatures (600–900 °C).57
Conventionally, the employment of a cobaltite based perovskite (CBP) air electrode on YSZ electrolyte requires coating an additional barrier layer (e.g. GDC film) sandwiched in between to prevent detrimental reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, at the cost of repeated coating–sintering processes during fabrication (see Fig. 8a). In comparison, the apparent advantage of the direct assembly technique, which does not need high temperature electrode sintering, is that highly active but reactive cobaltite electrodes can be used onto the barrier layer-free YSZ electrolyte without forming resistive phases (see Fig. 8b).58 As the electrode particles are not calcined, they remain in the nano-size form and thus show promising potential as highly active electrodes for the ORR/OER of SOCs.

The direct assembly technique is essentially related to the electrode/electrolyte interface formation under the influence of cathodic polarization. The polarization induced electrode/electrolyte interfaces have been found to be very much similar or comparable to those of high temperature sintered ones. For LSM and LSCF electrodes prepared on YSZ and GDC electrolytes using the conventional sintering process at 1100–1150 °C,56 the formation of a strong interface is evident by observation of convex contact rings on the electrolyte surface (see Fig. 9a). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis showed that a semi-coherent interface is formed between the sintered LSM electrode and electrolyte. As a comparison, the polarization induced LSM/YSZ interface at 750–800 °C is characterized by the formation of particle-shaped contact marks and clusters of 50–100 nm diameter (see Fig. 9b). Likewise, the interface of directly assembled LSCF/YSZ can also be established by cathodic polarization. It has been found that a strong LSCF/YSZ interface can be formed after 1 h polarization at 750 °C and 1000 mA cm−2, but prolonged polarization (∼100 h) leads to the segregation of SrO and formation of a resistive SrZrO3 phase.59

The polarization is also effective in constructing directly assembled composite electrode nanostructures. We have reported that the LSM-Er0.4Bi1.6O3 (ESB) electrodes directly assembled on YSZ electrolyte achieved remarkable performance and operating stability.60 After the test, a strong interface is formed with a dense interfacial layer (∼290 nm thick), where the LSM particles are surrounded by an ESB network. The ESB network with a high ionic conductivity not only facilitates rapid ion migration at the interface, but also enhances the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode. In another study, the directly assembled ESB-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3−δ (LSCFN) composite electrode has exhibited outstanding ORR performance and stability.61 It was revealed that cathodic polarization induced the generation of a thin ESB layer at the interface after the stability test, as shown in Fig. 10. This is probably due to the redistribution and migration of the ESB phase in the electrode to the electrolyte by cathodic polarization. The resultant ESB interfacial layer not only prevents physical contact and chemical reaction between surface segregated SrO on the LSCFN electrode and YSZ electrolyte, but also enhances the oxygen migration/diffusion at the interface, leading to a decrease of the activation energy for the ORR and dramatic performance enhancement.

Most recently, we constructed a nanostructured multi-phase air electrode via a facile combination of GDC decorated PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+δ (PBCC) and the direct assembly approach.62 The highly flexible decoration process and the in situ formation of multi-phases led to the formation of intertwined core–shell type nanostructures with a strong interface structure (see Fig. 11). Furthermore, by changing the calcination temperature during synthesis, the PBCC-GDC sintered at 750 °C showed an ultrafine microstructure and multi-phases composed of PBCC, GDC, PrCoO3−δ (PCO) and BaCoO3−δ (BCO), which became PBCC and GDC dual-phases as the calcination temperature increased to 850 °C and higher. The PBCC-GDC-750 cell achieved an outstanding peak power density of 2.08 W cm−2 at 750 °C in the SOFC operation mode and an electrolysis current of 1.77 A cm−2 at 1.3 V and 750 °C. The cell also showed excellent stability upon reversible operation of SOCs. The high electrocatalytic performance and good durability of the cell with PBCC-GDC-750 cathodes were mainly attributed to the in situ generation of a strong cathode/electrolyte interface induced by polarization and the retention of the ultrafine microstructure.63

Further studies show that the direct assembly method can also be used to fabricate hydrogen/fuel electrodes for SOCs. For example, in comparison to the conventional sintering temperature of ∼1400 °C, the interface between the Ni hydrogen electrode and YSZ electrolyte can be induced by anodic polarization at a low temperature of ∼800 °C.64 The electrocatalytic activity and operational stability of the directly assembled Ni hydrogen electrode are remarkably enhanced by the anodic polarization at 0.25 A cm−2, due to the established strong Ni/YSZ interface. The strong interfacial bonding is effective in suppressing the Ni electrode coarsening.
In brief, direct assembly is an effective and efficient nano-electrode fabrication technique, and it suits almost any electrode material used in SOCs. The distinct advantage of direct assembly is that replacing the conventional high temperature electrode sintering by cathodic polarization greatly simplifies the SOC fabrication processes, without sacrificing the strong electrode/electrolyte interface structure. The key for further expanding the application of the direct assembly technique may rely on the intricate design of a multi-phased composite electrode. The cathodic polarization employed by the technique can not only tune the nanostructure of the composite electrode, but also promote strong particle-to-particle bonding.
Conclusions and prospects
The development of nanostructured electrodes by solution infiltration, exsolution and direct assembly approaches has been critically reviewed in this article. Each technique has its own advantages and shortcomings, as illustrated in Fig. 12. Solution infiltration is one of the most versatile and popular fabrication approaches for nanostructured electrodes, but its practical application is limited by the requirement of multiple infiltration/annealing cycles and thermally unstable infiltrated nanoparticles. In situ exsolution is capable of enhancing the thermal stability of electrocatalytic nanoparticles by anchoring them on the parent oxide electrodes; however, the dependence of exsolution of nanoparticles on reducible metallic ions limits the types and selection of electroactive species. The direct assembly approach significantly simplifies the fabrication procedures of nanostructured hydrogen and air electrodes, and the excellent operational stability of the nanostructured electrodes can be gained by tuning the interaction between the multi-phases in the assembled electrode powders; however, there is a lack of open reports regarding the availability of directly assembled electrodes for large size cells. The formation of effective and high-performing nano-scale composite electrodes by direct assembly may also be an issue.

One of the most important issues in the development of nanostructured electrodes is the stability of the microstructure of the nano-scale electrodes, which critically depends on the interface between the formed nanoparticles or species and the scaffold supports. The nanostructured electrodes formed by exsolution offer the most stable interface between the exsoluted nanoparticles and the host electrode due to the formation of a socketed interface, which leads to high resistance of the nanoparticles to agglomeration.45,46 In the case of infiltration and direct assembly techniques, the interface between the nanoparticles and electrode and electrolyte supports is weak due to the significantly reduced heat-treatment temperature, despite their versatility and easy operation. Continuous efforts are required to explore the developed nano-scale fabrication techniques with high versatility, high microstructural stability and low operating cost for the development of nanostructured electrodes for practical and commercial size cells and stacks.
