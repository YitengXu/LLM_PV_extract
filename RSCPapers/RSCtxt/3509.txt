The possibility of achieving high-energy, long-life storage batteries has tremendous scientific and technological significance. Among available electrochemical energy storage systems, rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) represent the state-of-the-art technology and remain the best solution for many applications.1 However, the highest energy storage possible for LIB is insufficient for the long-term needs of society, for instance, solar- or wind-based renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs). Therefore, it is critical to develop rechargeable batteries with high safety, improved specific energy and specific power, long-lasting rechargeability, and reduced cost.2 Rechargeable Li–S batteries, of which cathode materials are based on conversion reactions instead of intercalation/deintercalation processes, have received ever-increasing attention in recent decade due to their high theoretical specific energy density. The theoretical capacity of sulfur cathode materials is as high as 1672 mA h g−1, which is 3 to 5 times higher than that of LIBs based on intercalation reactions. In addition, sulfur, as one of the most abundant elements, is cheap, and environmentally friendly.3,4
Despite the considerable advantages of Li–S batteries, several inherent problems remain great obstacles to realize high energy density and cyclic durability. Firstly, sulfur is insulator (5 × 10−30 S cm−1), resulting a high internal resistance and electrochemical inactivity. Secondly, the intermediate products—long chain polysulfides are soluble in the electrolyte, accompanied by a phenomenon called shuttle effect,5–7 which is the main reason for rapid capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, insoluble and insulating Li2S2 and Li2S precipitates deposit on the surface of cathode materials, retarding the further electrochemical reactions. Finally, volume change of the active material during the charge/discharge process leads to cathode pulverization and active mass loss.8
Recently, researchers have achieved great progress. For example, passivating Li anode by forming LixNOy coating via LiNO3 additive into the electrolyte could diminish the shuttle effect.5,9,10 More researches are devoted to modify the cathode materials, such as sulfur/carbon,2,11–18 sulfur/polymer,19–21 sulfur/carbon/polymer,22,23 and sulfur/mental oxide composites,24,25 to improve electronic conductivity and immobilize polysulfides. Carbonaceous materials and conjugating polymers are extensively used in batteries to enhance electrochemical contact within the electrodes, thereby improve the utilization of active material. The combination of polymers (e.g., polyethylene, polyaniline) and sulfur, which provide a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of polysulfides out of the electrodes, has been noticed to further improve the electrochemical performance. J. L. Wang et al.26 reported that polyacrylonitrile/graphene composite demonstrated an excellent reversible capacity of ∼1500 mA h g−1 and superior rate capability. A. Manthiram et al.20,27 found that coating polypyrrole on sulfur was an effective approach to facilitate fast electron transport enabling the materials with superior electrochemical stability and cyclability. Z. Y. Wen et al.28 synthesized tubular polypyrrole–sulfur composites containing 30% sulfur and a stable capacity of ∼650 mA h g−1 was achieved for over 80 cycles. L. F. Xiao et al.29 found that the polyaniline nanotube enhanced the cycle life of Li–S battery. L. F. Nazar et al.2 developed a polyethylene glycol-decorated mesoporous carbon/sulfur–interwoven nanocomposite as cathode and demonstrated effective retarding the polysulfide dissolution.
Fabricating hollow spherical structures for electrode materials have been demonstrated to be an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance.11,12,30,31 Besides, polypyrrole attracts special interest because of its high conductivity, ease in preparation, chemical and thermal stability, and good mechanical properties. However, it remains a challenge to develop a facile method for fabricating S@polypyrrole composite with both high specific energy and high specific power. In this study, we report a facile and cost-effective strategy to improve the Li–S cells. Hollow polypyrrole (H-PPy) synthesized by silica sphere template method were used as the sulfur carrier. Sulfur@hollow polypyrrole (S@H-PPy) composites with homogeneous distribution of sulfur were prepared by heating the mixture of sulfur and hollow polypyrrole. Li–S cells with high capacity as well as high rate capability and improved cycle properties were obtained. Details of the structure and electrochemical performance of the S@H-PPy composites were investigated.
Uniform hollow spheres with diameter of ∼700 nm were synthesized successfully using SiO2 spheres as template (Fig. S1†). The morphology of H-PPy was observed by SEM and TEM as given in Fig. S2.† From the TEM image and some broken spheres in the SEM image, the shell's thickness of the H-PPy spheres is measured to be ∼170 nm. The surface of the H-PPy appears to be rough, with some hemispheric particles protruding from the surface (Fig. S2c†). The as-prepared H-PPy was mixed with elemental sulfur by grind and followed by heat treatment at 160 °C. The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1 reveal that the H-PPy keeps its morphology after sulfur infiltration.

XRD patterns of elemental sulfur, the neat H-PPy, and S@H-PPy composite are shown in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of elemental sulfur shows some sharp and strong peaks, indicating a well-defined crystal structure (JCPDS: #08-0247). The neat H-PPy exhibits a broad diffraction peak around 26°, suggesting a typical amorphous structure. For the S@H-PPy composite, although the intensities become distinctly lower, the peaks of S@H-PPy match well with elemental sulfur except a slight uplift around 26°, which comes from polypyrrole. To figure out the element distribution of composites, elemental maps of S@H-PPy was analyzed. As shown in the Fig. 3, signals from C–K and S–K reveal the homogeneous distribution of carbon and sulfur, with no significant fraction of sulfur on the external surface of the H-PPy sphere. The loading content of sulfur was determined using a thermal analyser (Fig. S3†).

Fig. 4a shows the first three cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the S@H-PPy composite. Two reduction peaks are observed at 2.36 V for the reduction of S8 to polysulphide (Li2Sn, 2 < n ≤ 8), and at 2.02 V for the further reduction to Li2S2 and Li2S. The multiple reactions of sulfur with lithium ion are assumed as following equations:4–6,32 S8 + 2Li → Li2S8(1) Li2S8 + 2Li → 2Li2S4(2) Li2S4 + 2Li → 2Li2S2(3) Li2S2 + 2Li → 2Li2S(4)

Because of the low solubility and the slow kinetics of Li2S2 in the electrolyte, further reaction to Li2S (eqn (4)) may not complete. As for the oxidation process, there is a main peak centered at ∼2.43 V with a shoulder at 2.52 V. The oxidation peak at 2.43 V is associated with the transformation of Li2S2 and Li2S into the polysulfides. The shoulder may correspond to the further oxidation of polysulfides to elemental sulfur S8.33 This step may not complete due to the kinetic limitations. Similar phenomenon is also observed in the previous reports.13,29 With the cycle number in the CV scans, the significant coincidence of the first three CV curves certifies the excellent electrochemical stability of the S@H-PPy composite.

Fig. 4b presents typical discharge/charge voltage profiles for S@H-PPy-0.48 cathode. It is found that the charge/discharge plateaus exactly resemble the redox peaks observed in the CV scans. No obvious plateaus corresponding to PPy is found. The contribution of PPy is negligible due to its low capacity (50–90 mA h g−1) comparing with sulfur.34 Three stage processes of the discharge profiles are found: regions I, II and III, as denoted in Fig. 4b. Region I is corresponding to the conversion of solid sulfur to soluble polysulfides; II conversion of polysulfides to solid Li2S2; and III the reduction of solid Li2S2 to solid Li2S.35
The cycle stability of the S@H-PPy cathodes at 0.5 C rate is shown in Fig. 5a. The S@H-PPy-0.48 and S@H-PPy-0.65 cathodes exhibit initial capacities of 1426 mA h g−1 and 1120 mA h g−1, respectively. After 100 cycles, the S@H-PPy-0.48 cathode still retains about 620 mA h g−1, however, the S@H-PPy-0.65 only remains 350 mA h g−1. It is believed that increased sulfur content would reduce the conductivity of the composites and decrease the utilization of activating sulfur. Coulombic efficiencies of 89% and 98% are observed for S@H-PPy-0.48 and S@H-PPy-0.65 after 100 cycles, respectively. The capacity of S@H-PPy-0.65 cathode has a comparable capacity with core–shell structured S-PPy materials with approximate loading mass of sulfur as recently reported.27

Rate capability is one of the essential parameters for high-energy batteries especially in the applications of electric vehicles. Fig. 5b shows the rate capability of S@H-PPy-0.48. The battery charged/discharged at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 C and back to 0.2 C rates in turns. The capacity is found to stabilize at ∼600 mA h g−1 and ∼400 mA h g−1 at 1 and 2 C rates, respectively. When the C-rate is switched abruptly from 2 to 0.2 C again, the original capacity is recovered to 720 mA h g−1, indicating good stability of the cathode material.
The excellent cycling performance and rate capability of the as-prepared S@H-PPy composites can be attributed to structure and synergistic factors. On one hand, sulfur is homogeneously dispersed into the hollow PPy spheres with good chemical compatibility. The good electrochemical stability is attributed to the confinement of sulfur in the matrix of PPy. Interior void space of the hollow structure minimizes loss of lithium polysulfides to the electrolyte and suppresses shuttle effect. On the other hand, highly flexible and conductive PPy provides mechanical stability to accommodate the volume variation of the active materials and allows good transport of electrons from/to the insulating and insoluble species, i.e., Li2S, Li2S2 and elemental sulfur.
In summary, we have developed a scalable method for synthesizing S@H-PPy nanocomposites, in which sulfur is homogeneously dispersed in hollow polypyrrole spheres. Stabilized cycling performance with a high Coulombic efficiency was observed at practical loadings of sulfur. The host H-PPy provide conductive and flexible matrix with large space to accommodate the active mass volume variation during cycling, leading to an excellent multi-rates capability. The unique hollow structure is also benefit to immobilize the polysulfides and hence to suppress the shuttle effect. In addition, the easy tunability of the H-PPy in diameter, shell thickness, and surface modification offers much promise in further advances of Li–S energy storage systems with high energy density, power density and excellent efficiency.
