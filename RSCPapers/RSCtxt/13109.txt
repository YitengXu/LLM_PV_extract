    , Accepted 17th March 2018First published on 20th March 2018AbstractNonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with a fused-ring backbone usually tend to form large aggregations in the active layer when blended with polymer donors. One solution is to increase the steric hindrance by introducing bulky side chains onto the planar backbone; however, the enlarged intermolecular distance hampers the effective transport of electrons. Here, we provide a ternary-blend strategy to suppress the aggregation of NFAs but preserve their close π–π stacking in the nanophase. Using this method, a fused pentacyclic electron acceptor IDT-2O, which has fewer fused rings and a simpler synthetic route than commonly used heptacyclic and nonacyclic acceptors, can surprisingly demonstrate a high power conversion efficiency of 10.67%, higher than those of the corresponding binary devices. In such ternary-blend devices, PC71BM was selected as the third component to improve the film morphology and enhance the charge transport ability. As a result, increased short-circuit current and fill factors were achieved in these ternary-blend solar cells, giving rise to boosted photoelectric conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted lots of research attention due to their potential advantages to make light-weight, low-cost, flexible, and large-area products through roll-to-roll printing.1–4 However, PSCs employing the commonly used fullerene derivatives as acceptors hit the bottleneck of further improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) due to their weak absorption in the long wavelength region and deep LUMO energy level.5 Recently, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have emerged as a potential candidate to fabricate high efficiency PSCs without the limitations of fullerene acceptors.6,7 FREAs usually comprise a planar core to extend the absorption spectrum and to facilitate the charge transport. In addition, side chains attached to the planar core are used to improve the solubility and to prevent the molecules from forming large aggregations in the blend films.8–15 Currently, FREAs with fused heptacyclic or nonacyclic rings as the planar core have demonstrated PCEs larger than 10% in nonfullerene PSCs.12,16–20 However, complicated synthetic routes are usually adopted to obtain large fused heptacyclic and nonacyclic rings which will increase the material cost. Thus, it is desirable to develop high-performance PSCs based on FREAs with fewer fused rings. It is worth noting that most PSCs using smaller fused ring acceptors demonstrate an inferior PCE with a value not surpassing 10% in single active layer devices.21–24
One main reason for this dilemma is that side chains with a large steric hindrance such as alkylphenyl groups25 were usually attached to the planar core of FREAs to afford the acceptor with sufficient solubility.10 Such side chains will interfere the compact stacking of acceptor molecules, which is disadvantageous to charge transport. By replacing the bulky and rigid side chains with flexible aliphatic groups, a close packing of molecules can be expected but the material's solubility will deteriorate, resulting in large aggregates existing in the active layer, which is harmful to the device performance. In our previous work, we have synthesized a fused pentacyclic electron acceptor (IDT-2O) with four alkyl side chains attached to the planar core.26 This compound displays a strong crystallinity with obvious melting and recrystallization peaks in the DSC curves due to the weak steric hindrance of flexible alkyl side chains. If the large aggregation of this compound can be suppressed, a good photovoltaic performance can be expected since its closely packed molecules are beneficial to charge transport. Given that the ternary blend strategy is a useful strategy to tune the film morphology of the active layer,27–34 here we introduce phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the third component to construct ternary PSCs due to its good electron-transporting ability and weak crystallinity. After the introduction of PC71BM, the formation of large aggregates by IDT-2O in the active layer is suppressed and good nanoscale phase separation can be achieved. As a result, the optimal ternary blend device (PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM = 1:0.8:0.2, where PBDB-T is the polymer donor) shows high hole/electron mobilities of 2.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and more balanced charge mobility, which provides excellent charge transport properties with reduced recombination compared to binary blends. Accordingly, a maximum PCE of 10.67% can be obtained for this kind of ternary device, which is one of the highest reported values for single active layer PSCs mainly based on few-cyclic (<7 rings) electron acceptors without any additive and annealing treatment.
Optical properties

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the acceptors (IDT-2O and PC71BM) and the polymer donor PBDB-T. As shown in Fig. 1b, the energy levels show a cascade-like structure, which will facilitate charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interfaces.31 The UV-vis absorption spectra of their chloroform solutions and thin films are demonstrated in Fig. 1c and d. In solution, IDT-2O exhibits a similar spectral shape to the ternary blend (PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM = 1:0.8:0.2) with a main peak at ∼668 nm except for a relatively weak intensity at the shoulder (615 nm). PBDB-T has a complementary absorption with IDT-2O, so it was employed as the polymer donor for fabricating PSCs to achieve high photocurrent in the corresponding devices.

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/MoO3 (8.5 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (99.5%, 1.00 g) and 2-aminoethanol (98%, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (98%, 10.0 mL) under stirring for 8 h for hydrolysis reaction and aging. The active layer consisted of PBDB-T:IDT-2O (binary), PBDB-T:PC71BM (binary), or PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM (ternary). A series of conditions such as polymer concentrations, solvents, active layer compositions (donor:acceptor weight ratios), and spin-coating rates were systematically investigated. The optimized conditions for fabricating devices is using a solution of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) (polymer concentration: 4 mg mL−1), a donor/acceptor ratio of 1:1 (w/w), and a spin-coating rate of 1200 rpm. For ternary devices, by changing the ratios of the two acceptors, the optimal device performance can be obtained when the ratio of IDT-2O to PC71BM is 80:20. The device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves (measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are displayed in Fig. 2 and S5.†

 Fig. 2  (a) J–V and (b) EQE curves of devices based on the PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM blend with IDT-2O:PC71BM ratios of 100:0, 80:20, and 0:100. 
PBDB-T:PC71BM based devices demonstrate a maximum PCE of 7.47% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 13.25 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.6% which are similar to the previously reported values.35 In comparison to the PBDB-T:PC71BM devices, PBDB-T:IDT-2O based devices showed a better performance with a remarkably higher Jsc of 15.77 mA cm−2 and a larger FF of 71.6%, thus resulting in a higher PCE of 9.65%. The increased Jsc can be ascribed to the extended light absorption in the long-wavelength region and the enhanced FF arises from more balanced electron/hole transport (vide infra). As for the ternary system, the devices showed enhanced Jsc and FF relative to the binary ones in the case of using IDT-2O as the dominant acceptor. Especially, when IDT-2O:PC71BM is 80:20 in the acceptor, a maximum PCE of 10.67% can be achieved for the ternary blend PSCs with a Jsc of 16.80 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and a high FF value of 73.1%.
As shown in the EQE curves (Fig. 2b), IDT-2O could significantly expand the light absorption in the long-wavelength range for PSCs. Although the PBDB-T:PC71BM binary device has an obviously narrower spectral response, it has a higher maximum EQE value (79%) than that based on PBDB-T:IDT-2O. The EQE curve of the ternary-blend device (IDT-2O:PC71BM = 80:20) also exhibits a wide response range from 300 to 800 nm together with promoting the intensity in the region of 410 to 675 nm relative to the PBDB-T:IDT-2O binary device, thus resulting in an increase in Jsc. The maximum EQE value of the ternary blend based device reached 78%, which is higher than that of binary-blend devices (74.5%) for PBDB-T:IDT-2O, indicating that the photo-electron conversion process is more efficient in the ternary based device. The EQE curve of the PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM ternary device almost has a similar profile to that of PBDB-T:IDT-2O, demonstrating that the photocurrent of the ternary device was mostly derived from PBDB-T and IDT-2O.31 As a result, in the ternary-blend devices, IDT-2O could extend the light absorption and enhance the Jsc of devices; whereas PC71BM could prevent IDT-2O from forming large aggregates and enlarge the donor–acceptor interfacial area to facilitate the charge separation. Therefore, Jsc and FF were increased and PCE was boosted in IDT-2O dominated ternary devices.
Morphology characterization
To further understand the influence of the third component PC71BM on device performance, the film morphology of the active layer based on binary and ternary blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The total donor/acceptor weight ratio was kept at 1:1 in the active layer. As shown in Fig. 3 and S6,† larger aggregates were observed in the spin-coated PBDB-T:IDT-2O binary films with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (Rq) of 5.47 nm. After introducing 20% PC71BM, the large domains of IDT-2O disappeared. Such a ternary blend film showed a suitable nanoscale phase separation with well-distributed thick nanofibrils of polymer donors surrounded by a continuous and uniform acceptor phase. The RMS roughness value was decreased to 1.70 nm, which is much smaller than that of the PBDB-T:IDT-2O binary blend. The improved film morphology for the ternary blend films can well explain its increased Jsc and FF values mentioned above. As for the PBDB-T:PC71BM binary film, the RMS roughness is reduced to 0.9 nm due to the formation of more tenuous polymer fibrils in the binary blend surrounded by the PC71BM phase. As can be verified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. S2a†), a diffraction peak located at 2θ of 26.38°, which corresponds to the π–π stacking of IDT-2O molecules with a distance of 3.38 Å, can still be clearly observed in the ternary blend film. Combined with the TEM images, we can infer that after introducing PC71BM into the active layer, the formation of large IDT-2O domains is obviously suppressed. That is the unique role played by PC71BM as the third component in enhancing the device performance. It was reported that active layers with evident aggregations (or polycrystallinity) tend to increase the voltage loss relative to those with an amorphous morphology.36 As a result, we infer that in the PBDB-T:PC71BM blend film the uniform morphology favours the reduction of voltage loss, leading to Vocs in the two binary systems being similar despite their different ΔEDA (ELUMO, acceptor − EHOMO, donor) values. Also, in the ternary blends, suppressing the formation of large IDT-2O aggregates elevates Voc relative to the PBDB-T:IDT-2O binary system. Consequently, their Voc values are slightly improved compared to both the binary blends. Although the formation of large aggregates by FREAs can also be suppressed via introducing bulky side chains into the planar backbone, the π–π stacking distance among molecules is enlarged as a drawback of hampering electron transport. To make a comparison, we select IDT-2B as a control sample, which has the same molecular backbone as IDT-2O but bears bulky alkylphenyl side chains (Fig. S1†).26 As seen from the XRD patterns (Fig. S2†), a diffraction peak at 2θ of 25.49° is observed for IDT-2B corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.49 Å (larger than 3.38 Å of IDT-2O). With such an enlarged intermolecular distance, IDT-2B doesn't form obvious aggregations when blended with PBDB-T (see the TEM image in Fig. S3†), where only nanofibrils of the polymer are observed. Furthermore, in the PBDB-T:IDT-2B:PC71BM ternary blend film, different from IDT-2O, the characteristic diffraction peak corresponding to the π–π stacking of IDT-2B molecules disappeared (Fig. S2b, ESI†), which means that IDT-2B molecules lack an orderly microphase for electron transport due to their larger intermolecular distance, thus resulting in an inferior charge mobility (Table S2, ESI†). As a result, the PCE values of PBDB-T:IDT-2B based binary devices are low (see Table S1†). Also for the same reason, the IDT-2B based ternary devices do not show improvement in PCE values relative to PBDB-T:PC71BM based binary devices (Table S1†). To investigate the charge transfer behaviour in the active layer, electron and hole mobilities of the binary and ternary blend films were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.37,38 Electron-only and hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/active layer (100 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/Au (100 nm) were fabricated, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities of PBDB-T:PC71BM based devices are estimated to be 2.95 × 10−4/6.27 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 4.7. By contrast, PBDB-T:IDT-2O (1:1) based devices exhibit hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities of 1.88 × 10−4/9.85 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.91. When PC71BM was introduced as the third component, devices based on the ternary blend (PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM = 1:0.8:0.2) display not only rather higher μh/μe values of 2.21 × 10−4/1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, but also more balanced charge mobilities with a μh/μe ratio of 1.23. The enhanced and more balanced charge transport ability in the ternary blend device can reduce the possibility of charge recombination in the active layer, which is beneficial to the increase of Jsc and FF. As can be seen from the TEM images of the blend films (Fig. 3 and S4†), the donor polymer nanofibrils exist both in the binary and the ternary films which are beneficial to the hole transport in devices. In addition, the large domain size (>200 nm) of IDT-2O aggregates in the binary film (Fig. S4a†) indicates they may run through the whole depth of the active layer to facilitate electron transport in the PBDB-T:IDT-2O film. Consequently, the binary (PBDB-T:IDT-2O) and ternary devices do not exhibit a significant difference in the FF value and their performance difference (9.65% vs. 10.67%) mainly comes from the variation of Jsc values due to the changed donor–acceptor interfacial contact areas.

Conclusions
In conclusion, fused pentacyclic molecule IDT-2O and PC71BM were employed as electron acceptors in ternary blend PSCs to demonstrate an enhanced power conversion efficiency relative to the binary devices. The use of few-cyclic acceptors, which can achieve high-efficiency PSCs, will be beneficial to reduce the material cost. The optimized binary blend devices show PCEs of 9.65% and 7.47% for PBDB-T:IDT-2O and PBDB-T:PC71BM, respectively. In comparison, the ternary devices demonstrate obviously boosted PCEs larger than 10% when IDT-2O is the dominant acceptor. Especially, when the PBDB-T:IDT-2O:PC71BM ratio is 1:0.8:0.2, the maximum PCE of 10.67% can be achieved, which is the highest value for single-active-layer PSCs based on the fused few-cyclic acceptor without any additive and annealing processing. Such an increase in the PCE of ternary blend PSCs mainly arises from the improvement of the film morphology and charge transport of the active layer after introducing PC71BM. Consequently, increased donor/acceptor interfaces and balanced electron/hole transport are achieved in the ternary blend active layer to give improved Jsc and FF values. By contrast, although IDT-2B, which is an analogue of IDT-2O but bears bulky alkylphenyl side chains, shows weak aggregations in the binary blend film, its ternary blend instead demonstrates inferior PCE values relative to the PC71BM based binary one because its enlarged intermolecular π–π stacking distance hampers the effective transport of electrons. Our results have demonstrated that the ternary blend strategy is simple and effective in enhancing the performance of polymer solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials and Instruments
PBDB-T and IDT-2O were synthesized following the methods in our previous work. The ZnO solution was used to make the cathode buffer layers. PC71BM was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. Unless otherwise stated, all the chemicals were commercially available products and were used as received. UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer UV-vis spectrometer model Lambda 750. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a Digital Instruments Multimode Nanoscope IIIA in the tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a FEI Technai TF20 (Philip) transmission electron microscope. The thickness of the blend films was determined using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer.
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The device architecture was ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/MoO3 (85 Å)/Ag (100 nm) for solar cells. Precleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. A thin layer of ZnO was spin-coated on top of the precleaned ITO substrates at 3500 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 200 °C for 20 min on a hotplate before being transferred into a glovebox. The binary and ternary blend films keep the same optimal donor/receptor weight ratio of 1:1 (the two acceptors were mixed with different ratios to fabricate the ternary PSCs) with a polymer concentration of 4 mg mL−1 in the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution (without any additives), and then spin-coated at 1200 rpm for 50 s to obtain a film thickness of 100 nm on the top of the ITO/ZnO layer. Finally, to complete the devices, the top electrode was thermally evaporated with an 8.5 nm MoO3 layer and followed by a 100 nm Ag film at a vacuum pressure below 10−7 Torr. Cells were fabricated on the substrate with an effective area of 0.04 cm2. The measurement of the devices was conducted in a glovebox without encapsulation. The temperature while measuring the J–V curves was approximately 25 °C. The characteristics of the solar cells were statistically analysed by testing over 10 cells. Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves agreed well with those obtained from J–V tests (within 5% mismatch). The J–V curves were measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an class AAA solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) calibrated with a standard photovoltaic cell equipped with a KG5 filter (certified by the National Institute of Metrology) and a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The EQE data were obtained using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QER3011, Enli Technology Co. Ltd), and the intensity was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
