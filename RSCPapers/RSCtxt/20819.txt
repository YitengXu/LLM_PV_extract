    , Accepted 19th March 2020First published on 25th March 2020AbstractIntroducing intramolecular noncovalent interactions is an effective method for enlarging the conjugated area of the donor core in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) to improve the photovoltaic performance. In this study, a novel NFA (NTO-4F) based on a para-substituted naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene core with alkoxy side chains was designed and synthesized, which has a featured oxygen atom at the side chains to facilitate an intramolecular noncovalent S–O interaction with thiophene at the core. NTO-4F exhibits strong absorption in the 600 to 800 nm region with a narrow optical band gap of 1.55 eV, suitable energy levels with a high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −3.88 eV, and appropriate crystallinity. As a result, when NTO-4F is blended with the wide bandgap polymer, PM6, as the active layer, the optimized polymer solar cells (PSCs) achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.5% with simultaneously high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.1 mA cm−2, attributing to the low energy loss of 0.56 eV. Furthermore, PM6:NTO-4F-based devices exhibit excellent tolerance to thermal annealing (TA) treatment with over 10% PCEs for all devices under TA treatment from 140 to 200 °C and over 80% of the initial PCE after thermal treatment at 180 °C for 45 min.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture in the active layer have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of light weight, low cost, and easy to fabricate for roll-to-roll production.1–6 In the recent two decades, considerable efforts have been made toward developing high-performance PSCs. Recently, with the considerable advances in material synthesis, interfacial engineering, and morphology regulation of the active layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved has been over 16% for single-junction PSCs.7–11 The development of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) that consist of a bulky electron-donating core and two electron-deficient moieties is one of the main reasons for the significant progress of PSCs.12–15
In A–D–A type NFAs, fused ring blocks have been widely used as the central donor unit, because their planar rigid backbone enlarges the conjugated area, facilitates π-electron delocalization, and strengthens intermolecular π-orbital interactions.16–18 Since Zhan et al. reported fused-ring based NFAs (ITIC),19 a series of A–D–A type acceptors with different sized fused-ring cores have been developed for high-performance PSCs.20–24 It has been widely demonstrated that extending the conjugation of the fused-ring core is effective at facilitating molecular packing and intermolecular interactions, hence effectively tuning their energy levels and absorption and electron-transport properties.25,26
Generally, two effective methods are used to extend the fused-ring conjugation area of NFAs for a high photovoltaic performance. One is to increase the number of fused rings. For example, by replacing benzene in IDTT with thienothiophene (TT), Zhan et al. reported an eight-ring NFA, named FOIC, which exhibited a PCE of up to 12.0% compared to the IDTT-based seven-ring NFA, ITIC3 (8.09%), by matching with PTB7-Th.21 The Zhan and Wang research groups developed NFAs with an eight-ring (IOIC2) and a ten-ring (IDCIC) core, respectively, based on naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene.24,27 Both these exhibited outstanding photovoltaic performance compared to naphthalene-based NFAs with a fused six-ring core. However, certain difficulties, such as poor solubility, tedious synthesis and purification steps, impose constraints on the further development of fused-ring-based NFAs. The second method is to introduce intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the donor unit of NFAs. In previous studies, various noncovalent interactions, including S⋯X (X = halogen), S⋯O, S⋯S, and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the neighboring rings, have been developed.28–32 Most of these types of NFAs are based on heteroatom-modified π-bridges, which facilitate noncovalent interactions with thiophene units at the core. However, NFAs with noncovalent interactions between the modified side chains and fused-ring backbone have been rarely investigated.
Previous works indicate that incorporating naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the fused core to construct NFAs is effective in achieving high photovoltaic performance.24,27,33–35 Hence, in this study, we designed and synthesized a novel NFA (NTO-4F), containing a para-substituted naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene core with alkoxy side-chains and two cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) units to form an eight fused-ring donor unit (Scheme 1a). The oxygen atoms in the para-position side chains facilitate an intramolecular noncovalent S⋯O interaction with thiophene at the core, resulting in an enlarged conjugated area of the donor unit. NTO-4F exhibited strong absorption in the region of 600–800 nm with a bandgap of 1.55 eV, suitable energy levels, and appropriate crystallinity. To harvest more light and realize a more efficient photo-electron conversion, PM6 with complementary absorption and well-matched energy levels was selected as the polymer donor material.36–38 As a result, the PM6:NTO-4F-based devices exhibited a PCE of 11.5% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.1 mA cm−2, and a fill-factor (FF) of 0.61. Notably, a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2 is among the highest values for reported PSCs with similar Voc. The energy loss (Eloss) was calculated to be as low as 0.56 eV, which is responsible for the high Jsc and Voc simultaneously. Moreover, the PM6:NTO-4F-based devices showed good tolerance to temperature upon thermal annealing (TA) treatment, and over 10% efficiency was achieved even when the temperature of TA treatment reached 200 °C.

2. Results and discussion
Materials’ synthesis and theoretical calculation
The synthetic routes for NTO-4F are shown in Scheme 1, and the synthetic details are presented in the ESI.† (4,9-Bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (compound 1) was prepared according to the literature.39 Then, the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed Stille-coupling reaction between compound 1 and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate (compound 2) afforded intermediate compound 3. A coupling reaction between compound 3 and 4-hexylphenyl-1-magnesium bromide followed by intramolecular cyclization resulted in compound 4. The intermediate product further reacted with phosphorus oxychloride to generate compound 5. Finally, a Knoevenagel condensation between compound 5 and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) afforded the final product of NTO-4F in a 74% yield. The chemical structures of intermediates and NTO-4F were confirmed by NMR and mass spectra. NTO-4F has good solubility in general organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform at room temperature. The thermal properties of NTO-4F were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of NTO-4F was found to be 360 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that it possesses excellent thermal stability.
The molecular geometries and electronic properties of NTO-4F were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Fig. 1a demonstrates that NTO-4F possesses a planar geometry, which would benefit the intermolecular π–π interactions. Moreover, the O⋯S distance between the alkoxy chains and the thiophene rings in the backbone was calculated to be 2.69 Å, which is remarkably shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sulfur and oxygen (3.25 Å).40 This indicates that NTO-4F exhibits strong O⋯S noncovalent interactions. The calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of NTO-4F were −5.38 eV and −3.34 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the distribution of the HOMO extends into the alkoxy side chains, indicating an enlarged conjugated area due to O⋯S noncovalent interactions. DFT calculations were further carried out for the analogue (NT-4F) to prove the noncovalent interactions in NTO-4F. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the distribution of the HOMO in NT-4F cannot delocalize to the alkyl side chains. Besides, the improved HOMO and LUMO levels and the red-shift absorption of NTO-4F as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) may account for the enhanced conjugated effect of alkoxy side chains. Therefore, NTO-4F possesses the enlarged conjugation, which corresponds to the O⋯S noncovalent interactions.

Optical, electrochemical, and crystallization properties
The normalized optical absorption spectra of NTO-4F in chloroform solution and the thin film were investigated, as shown in Fig. 1b. NTO-4F in solution exhibits a strong absorption at 570–775 nm with a maximum molar extinction coefficient of 2.19 × 105 cm−1 M−1 at an absorption peak at 731 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). In the thin film, NTO-4F shows a broader absorption with a distinctly red-shifted absorption edge at 800 nm and a maximum absorption peak at 739 nm. Notably, compared to solution, an obvious shoulder peak was observed at 670 nm, indicating that a strong intermolecular π–π stacking interaction exists in the film. Additionally, the wide band gap polymer donor, PM6, with its absorption edge at ∼690 nm, is beneficial for perfectly complementary absorption with NTO-4F, which is desirable to efficiently capture photons for a higher Jsc of PSCs. The absorption spectra of the PM6:NTO-4F-based blend films are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). As shown, the combination of donors and acceptors provides a rather complementary absorption, which covers the range from 300 to 800 nm. The energy levels of NTO-4F and PM6 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for NTO-4F and PM6, estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, are −5.61/−3.88 eV and −5.55/−3.61 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. The relatively high LUMO level of NTO-4F is beneficial for achieving a high Voc.
To investigate the molecular packing properties of the acceptor, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out.41 As the two-dimensional (2D) pattern (Fig. 1d) shows NTO-4F exhibits a lamellar diffraction peak (100) along the in-plane (IP) direction and an obvious π–π stacking diffraction peak (010) along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating its preferred face-on orientation. Fig. 1e presents one-dimensional (1D) profiles extracted along the IP and OOP directions. As shown, the (010) peak of NTO-4F is located at 1.72 Å−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.65 Å, which is on the order typical of π–π stacking distances. The (100) peak along the IP direction for NTO-4F is located at 0.39 Å−1 with an interchain distance of 16.11 Å. Additionally, the coherence length (Lc) for the NTO-4F film was estimated using the Scherrer equation to be 1.32 and 5.65 nm in the (010) and (100) directions, respectively. This result demonstrates a much-ordered molecular packing in NTO-4F.
Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performances of the PSCs based on PM6:NTO-4F were evaluated using the conventional device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)) (PFN-Br)/Al. The detailed device optimization parameters, such as the donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio, TA temperature and time, are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S7, S8 and S9; Tables S1, S2 and S3). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the PSCs based on the as-cast and optimized (TA treatment at 180 °C for 5 min) PM6:NTO-4F blends are shown in Fig. 2a. Additionally, the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown, the as-cast PSC based on PM6:NTO-4F at an optimal D/A weight ratio of 1.25:1 has a poor PCE of 6.1% with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.40. When the blended film was treated at 180 °C for 5 min, the PCE dramatically increased to 11.5% with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.61. Excitingly, a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2 is among the highest values for PSCs with similar Voc reported in the literature to date (Fig. 2c). Besides, a PCE of 11.5% is also among the highest values for PSCs with a Voc of around 1.0 V (Fig. S10, ESI†). Additionally, along with the temperature change, the PCE of PM6:NTO-4F-based devices exhibits no obvious fluctuation, as shown in Fig. 2d. Over 10% efficiency was achieved for all the PSCs with TA treatment at 140–200 °C. In order to further investigate the thermal stability of PM6:NTO-4F-based devices, the PCE of devices versus TA treatment time at 180 °C has been tested as shown in Fig. S11 and Table S3 (ESI†). Notably, the PM6:NTO-4F-based devices possess good tolerance to TA treatment and over 80% of the initial efficiency is achieved after 45 min.

The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the as-cast devices and with TA treatment are presented in Fig. 2b. As shown, the high and broad EQEs over the entire range from 300 to 800 nm indicate that the donor and acceptor materials make a considerable and complementary contribution to the overall Jsc values. Compared to the as-cast device, the EQE values of devices that underwent TA treatment significantly increased in the entire wavelength range. The Jsc values of the NTO-4F-based devices calculated from the EQE spectra were 14.7 and 18.7 mA cm−2 for the as-cast and optimized films, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values measured from J–V curves (with an error of <5%).
In order to explain the simultaneous high Voc and Jsc, the Eloss, which is determined by the difference between the optical bandgap of the organic semiconductor with a smaller bandgap and qVoc, was investigated.42 Minimizing the Eloss provides an effective way to overcome the trade-off between Jsc and Voc. The Eg of NTO-4F calculated from the absorption edge is 1.55 eV, and thus the Eloss of PM6:NTO-4F-based devices was evaluated to be 0.56 eV, which is among the lowest values reported to date.43 The origins of Eloss were further investigated. According to the detailed balance theory, the Eloss in PSCs can be attributed to three sources shown in the following equation:44Eloss = qΔV = Eg − qVoc= (Eg − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc)= ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3where VSQoc is the maximum voltage using the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, and Vradoc is the open-circuit voltage when there is only radiative recombination. For PM6:NTO-4F-based devices, the VSQoc and Vradoc were calculated to be 1.27 and 1.21 V, respectively. The detailed calculations are shown in the ESI.† Therefore, the ΔE1, which is due to radiative recombination originating from the absorption above the bandgap, is evaluated to be 0.28 eV. The second part ΔE2, which is attributed to the additional radiative recombination loss from the absorption below the bandgap, is negligible with a value of 0.06 eV. And the third part ΔE3 is due to the non-radiative recombination. The PM6:NTO-4F-based PSC gave a small ΔE3 of 0.22 eV, calculated from the difference between qVradoc and qVoc. Hence, the negligible loss of ΔE2 and the relatively small values of ΔE1 and ΔE3 account for the low Eloss of PM6:NTO-4F-based PSCs.
Exciton dissociation, charge recombination and transport
Plots of the photocurrent (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff) for the PM6:NTO-4F-based devices without (as-cast) and with TA treatment were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge carrier dynamics in the PSCs. As shown in Fig. 3a, when Veff reached ∼2 V, Jph values for both devices reached saturation (Jsat), indicating that charge recombination was minimized, all excitons dissociated, and photogenerated charge carriers were completely collected by the electrodes. The charge dissociation and charge collection probability (P(E,T)) of the devices could be evaluated from Jph/Jsat.45 Under maximal power output and short-circuit conditions, the (P(E,T)) values for the as-cast and optimized devices were 52.3/86.0% and 68.9/95.8%, respectively. These results indicate that TA treatment is beneficial for PM6:NTO-4F-based devices to achieve higher exciton dissociation and efficient charge collection.
 Fig. 3  (a) Jphversus Veff, (b) Voc and (c) Jscversus light intensity of the as-cast and optimized devices based on PM6:NTO-4F. 
To study the charge recombination mechanism in PSCs, the relationship of Voc with light intensity (Plight) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 3b. Voc and Plight follow the relationship of Voc ∝ ln(Plight).46 The slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) at kBT/q suggests that there is only bimolecular recombination in the device, while the slope of 2kBT/q means that trap-assisted recombination dominates. The slopes for PM6:NTO-4F-based PSCs without and with TA treatment were 1.14 and 1.11kBT/q, respectively, suggesting that the device processed by TA treatment has fewer trap-assisted recombination events.
To further probe the charge recombination behavior of the devices, the variations of Jsc as a function of Plight were carried out. A power-law dependence of Jsc on Plight was determined: Jsc ∝ PSlight, where S is an exponential constant. In principle, the fitted slope (S) values close to 1 suggest the ignorable bimolecular recombination.47 As displayed in Fig. 3c, the S values for the as-cast and TA-treated devices were 0.87 and 0.96, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular recombination in the PM6:NTO-4F-based devices reduced significantly after TA treatment, which is quite consistent with the higher Jsc and FF of optimized devices.
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency of the PM6:NTO-4F blend compared to its pure films was also determined for the exciton dissociation (Fig. S12, ESI†). Compared to the emission spectra of pure PM6 and NTO-4F, the PM6:NTO-4F blends with TA treatment showed a significant PL quenching of 89.0% and 95.8%, respectively, which are higher than those of the as-cast blends (84.4% and 95.2%). The results indicate that PM6:NTO-4F-based blended films with TA treatment exhibit more efficient exciton dissociation than the as-cast films, which is in agreement with the higher EQE and PCE values of related devices.
The hole and electron mobilities were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al, respectively (Fig. S13, ESI†). The hole and electron mobilities for the as-cast and optimized devices were calculated to be 1.78 × 10−3/2.27 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.85 × 10−3/3.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved charge mobilities after TA treatment are beneficial for improving Jsc.48 However, the relatively higher hole mobilities compared with electron mobilities lead to the unbalanced charge mobilities, which may be responsible for a low FF of 0.61 in PM6:NTO-4F-based PSCs.
Morphology studies
The morphologies of the as-cast and TA-treated films based on PM6:NTO-4F were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4, compared to the as-cast film with a root-mean square roughness (Rq) of 1.33 nm, the TA-treated film had a higher Rq value of 2.35 nm, which could be attributed to the increased crystallinity. In the TEM images, the blend treated with TA displayed a suitable phase separation of donors and acceptors with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network, which benefited the exciton dissociation and charge transport.

The molecular packing patterns of the blended films were characterized using GIWAXS measurements. The 2D diffraction images and 1D plots are shown in Fig. 5. Compared to the as-cast film of PM6:NTO-4F, all the diffraction peaks became sharper and stronger after TA treatment. In the TA-treated film, the (100) peak at 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction and the (010) peak at 1.72 Å−1 in the OOP direction were observed with Lc values of 11.31 and 2.47 nm, respectively. In contrast, the as-cast film exhibited suppressed crystallinity with smaller Lc values of 7.07 and 1.77 nm for the (100) peak in the IP direction and for the (010) peak in the OOP direction, respectively. The increased crystallinity of the PM6:NTO-4F-based film after TA treatment was in good agreement with the AFM results, leading to improved charge mobilities. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was used to reveal the average composition variations (relative domain purity) via the integrated scattering intensity (ISI, ), as shown in Fig. 5c.49 The relative domain purities of the PM6:NTO-4F-based films without and with TA treatment were calculated to be 0.89 and 1, respectively. The higher domain purity of the TA-treated films was responsible for the reduced bimolecular recombination, resulting in greater Jsc and FF values of the corresponding PSCs.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized a novel NFA (NTO-4F) based on para-substituted naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene with alkoxy side chains. NTO-4F exhibits a strong absorption in the 600–800 nm region with a narrow optical bandgap of 1.55 eV, suitable energy levels, and appropriate crystallinity. In combination with a wide bandgap polymer donor, PM6, the optimized device exhibits a high PCE of 11.5% with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2, and an Eloss of 0.56 eV. Notably, a Jsc value of 19.1 mA cm−2 is among the highest values for reported PSCs with a similar Voc. Moreover, the PM6:NTO-4F-based device exhibits excellent tolerance to the temperature during thermal annealing (TA) treatment with no obvious fluctuations in the PCE of devices upon TA treatment from 140 to 200 °C.
