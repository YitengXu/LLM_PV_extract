While a number of lead-free antimony-/bismuth-based compounds have been proposed, they have typically exhibited limited charge extraction efficiency, which has prompted the widespread adoption of a mesoporous device architecture. With a focus on compact films of Rb3Sb2I9—an emerging lead-free two-dimensional perovskite derivative—this study presents two strategies to enhance their microstructure: one relying on the reduction of the supersaturation level during the annealing step, and the other involving high-temperature annealing in an SbI3 atmosphere. Both strategies lead to a considerable improvement in film morphology and microstructure, with a twofold increase in apparent grain size. Such high-quality compact films deliver a pronounced rise in external quantum efficiency, as well as in short-circuit photocurrent under solar illumination—all this without the aid of a mesoporous architecture for charge extraction. Hall effect and photocurrent-power characterization show that this performance improvement results from an increase in charge carrier mobility and a reduction in the number of recombination centers. The microstructural improvement, photoconversion efficiency boost, and mechanistic insight provide valuable indications on the status and prospects of Rb3Sb2I9 and related derivatives—as relevant to the future exploration of these compounds for lead-free top-cells in tandem photovoltaics, indoor photovoltaics, and other optoelectronic application domains.
Introduction
In recent years lead-halide perovskites have emerged as a class of semiconductors with outstanding optoelectronic properties.1–7 Importantly, they are particularly attractive for low-cost and high-performance photovoltaics,8–10 in view of their power conversion efficiency (PCE) in single-cell devices now exceeding 25% (ref. 11) and due to their facile solution processability.12–14 The toxicity of lead, however, is a major obstacle to their large-scale commercialization.15–17 This has prompted the search for materials that are chemically, crystallographically or electronically similar to lead-halide perovskites while being lead-free.18,19 This search is relevant to the identification of alternatives not only for single-cell devices for solar harvesting, but also for multi-junction photovoltaics, indoor photovoltaics, photocathodes for water splitting, and other optoelectronic application domains such as photodetection.20–26 Insight from studies on lead-based perovskites suggests that other potentially promising halide perovskites should rely on a large highly-polarizable metal cation featuring ns outer orbitals that can hybridize with halogen p orbitals.18,27 An emerging approach to lead replacement involves antimony, which yields Sb3+ cations that, like Pb2+, have stable valence s2 electrons and comparable ionic radii. This has led investigators to consider a number of ternary antimony-iodide perovskite derivatives (ASbIs), i.e., materials of general formula A3Sb2I9, with A being a monovalent cation.28,29 Structurally, ASbIs come in two forms: as zero-dimensional (0D) derivatives (e.g., A = CH3NH3+ or Cs+), featuring isolated face-sharing [Sb2X9]3− bioctahedra; and as two-dimensional (2D) derivatives (e.g., A = K+, Rb+, or Cs+), featuring planes of corner-sharing [SbI6]3− octahedra.30 A 2D structure has been regarded as more promising for ASbI photovoltaics, because charge transport is expected to be facilitated within the planes of [SbI6]3− octahedra. While Cs3Sb2I9 may form a 2D structure,31 it can only do so through dedicated processing protocols.32–34 By contrast, K3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9 intrinsically adopt a stable 2D structure.35 Finally, in addition to its favorable and stable 2D structure, it has been shown that Rb3Sb2I9 is the only ASbI with a direct bandgap, and it is also the ASbI with the smallest exciton binding energy (≈100 meV).35,36
Material considerations suggest that Rb3Sb2I9 has considerable photovoltaic potential, especially in regard to its use for top-cells in tandem photovoltaics and for indoor photovoltaics. Interestingly, this compound has received little attention to date. The first study on the synthesis and photovoltaic application of this material reported a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.66%, along with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29% (at short circuit).36 Adopting similar deposition processes, Correa-Baena et al. later reported a champion PCE of 0.76%,35 while most recently Weber et al. achieved a PCE of 1.37%.37 Interestingly, the more-than-twofold increase in PCE of the latter work came with a slightly lower EQE (26%).37 It is noteworthy that all of these studies adopted a device architecture in which Rb3Sb2I9 was grown on (and partly embedded in) a mesoporous electron transport layer. In fact, the adoption of a mesoporous device architecture has been mainstream in works on antimony-halide and bismuth-halide perovskite derivatives to date, typically in view of the presumed limitation in charge-extraction efficiency of such compounds. Indeed, a mesoporous architecture has been demonstrated to improve the photoconversion efficiency (hence, the EQE and short-circuit photocurrent) of absorbers that otherwise suffer from limited charge-extraction efficiency in compact thin-film form.38,39
In the broader perovskite photovoltaics research landscape, it has generally been observed that the morphology of a polycrystalline perovskite layer has considerable impact on its optoelectronic/photovoltaic properties.40,41 Importantly, larger grain sizes have been found to lead to larger carrier mobilities and lifetimes, both of which boost the photoconversion efficiency by synergistically extending carrier drift/diffusion length.42–46 In fact, the highest performance of lead-based-perovskite solar cells has been attained with films featuring a grain size in the region of 1 μm or larger.1,2 As a term of comparison, the maximum apparent grain size of the Rb3Sb2I9 films in the literature to date is in the region of 200 nm.36
In this study we harness compact films of Rb3Sb2I9 towards enhanced optoelectronic performance and provide fresh insight into its photoconversion and photovoltaic potential as a promising lead-free perovskite. We achieve this by firstly developing deposition strategies that lead to compact polycrystalline Rb3Sb2I9 thin films with considerable improvement in microstructure. In order to assess the inherent optoelectronic potential of Rb3Sb2I9, we then characterize these high-quality films as compact photoactive layers within a planar device structure. Doing without the aid of a mesoporous transport layer for charge extraction, we are thus able to unravel how the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of high-quality polycrystalline Rb3Sb2I9 films impact their photoconversion and photovoltaic performance. Additionally, through photocurrent-power characterization and Hall effect measurements, we are able to rationalize the observed device performance, and identify the future potential of Rb3Sb2I9 as a lead-free optoelectronic and photovoltaic material.
Results and discussion
With the aim of gaining insight into the impact of morphology on the intrinsic optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of Rb3Sb2I9, we investigated several strategies to deposit high-quality compact Rb3Sb2I9 films on a planar substrate. As a first step, we evaluated the conventional process (CP) previously adopted in the literature for the deposition of Rb3Sb2I9 on a mesoporous substrate. While based on the mainstream antisolvent method, CP differs insofar as the antisolvent (toluene) incorporates a small amount of SbI3 to compensate for iodine deficiency in the film being formed (Fig. 1a). In CP, spin coating is followed by a straightforward hotplate annealing step at 120 °C (see the Experimental section and Fig. S1† for further details).

During the formation of a perovskite film via solution-based methods, grain growth dynamically competes with nucleation to determine the final grain size in the dry film. This competition is controlled by the local supersaturation level, with higher values leading to faster nucleation and smaller grain size (Fig. S2†). Following this lead, we investigated the possibility of promoting grain growth in compact Rb3Sb2I9 films by controlling the supersaturation level during annealing. We thus adopted a method, which we refer to as Reduced Supersaturation Annealing (RSA), that involves limiting the solvent evaporation rate during the annealing step. As shown in Fig. 1a, a salient aspect of this method is that the hotplate annealing step is carried out with the as-spun Rb3Sb2I9 films turned over onto a glass slide. Capping the substrate reduces the solvent evaporation rate, and, in turn, the supersaturation level in the Rb3Sb2I9 film being formed. In contrast to classic vapor annealing,14,47 RSA involves an extremely low (i.e., residual) amount of solvent, thus preventing the perovskite film from being significantly re-dissolved and altered (see the Experimental section and Fig. S3† for further details).
Apart from the supersaturation level, the annealing temperature can also have a profound impact on the final morphology of a perovskite film. In this regard, it is noteworthy that a number of reports from the broader perovskite research landscape evidence that annealing temperatures >200–250 °C may lead to films with particularly large grain size.48,49 We found, however, that a straightforward annealing step at such high temperatures is not practicable for Rb3Sb2I9, as it leads to its decomposition (Fig. S4†). To the end of investigating the effect of high-temperature annealing without having the Rb3Sb2I9 films undergo decomposition, we thus developed a modified high-temperature (>200 °C) annealing scheme. This involves carrying out the annealing step while the sample is placed in a closed container saturated with SbI3 vapor (see Fig. 1a). In particular, the SbI3 vapor source in this process consists of SbI3 powder placed in the vicinity of the Rb3Sb2I9 samples (see the Experimental section and Fig. S5† for details). The SbI3 powder is in a dry form, as we found that the additional presence of any solvent vapors negatively impacts the reproducibility of the process. We refer to this process as High-Temperature Vapor Annealing (HTVA). HTVA processing of Rb3Sb2I9 films is enabled by the comparatively low melting point of SbI3 (170 °C at atmospheric pressure) and by its appreciable vapor pressure at temperatures in excess of 200 °C.50,51 As a result, the SbI3 in the gas phase prevents the loss of SbI3 from the as-spun Rb3Sb2I9 film even at temperatures in excess of 200 °C. Evidence of this mechanism is provided by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) measurements, which indicate that Rb3Sb2I9 films annealed at temperatures above 200 °C maintain their Sb/I ratio at the expected stoichiometric level (Fig. S6 and Table S1†). This is in addition to the fact that high-temperature annealing in an atmosphere saturated with SbI3 vapor also allows the films to preserve their overall substrate coverage and their crystallographic, electronic, and optical absorption properties (vide infra). Consequently, HTVA enables the optimization of the annealing process at temperatures higher than it would be otherwise possible, which may potentially have a favorable impact on the film microstructure.

Fig. 1b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Rb3Sb2I9 films processed on planar substrates through the different deposition processes (CP, RSA, and HTVA) we have investigated. Unless otherwise noted, the planar substrates consist of TiO2|FTO|glass (FTO: fluorine-doped tin-oxide). Our CP films present an average apparent grain size of 130 nm, as per SEM (Fig. 1b and c), similar to earlier reports of CP films on mesoporous substrates.36 In contrast, RSA films exhibit a dramatic improvement in apparent grain size, up to 1 μm in lateral dimensions (Fig. 1b and c). This shows that grain growth in Rb3Sb2I9 films deposited on a planar substrate can be controlled during the annealing step by reducing the solvent evaporation rate, which in turn determines the supersaturation level. Running the annealing step at the highest solvent evaporation rate possible (for a given annealing temperature), as in CP, enhances nucleation over grain growth, leading to small apparent grain size (Fig. S2†). On the contrary, curbing the evaporation rate shifts the balance towards grain growth (Fig. S2†), thus allowing the dramatic apparent grain size improvement observed in RSA samples. Further evidence of this mechanistic picture is provided by the fact that, while leading to particularly large apparent grain size, RSA in the basic form described so far also yields large pinholes (Fig. S3†). This denotes that grain growth in basic RSA runs at a particularly low supersaturation level (i.e., with a comparatively large amount of solvent), which determines a pronounced imbalance between the grain growth rate and the nucleation rate. Thus, we devised a modified RSA scheme, in which a straightforward pre-annealing step at the moderate temperature of 50 °C is conducted prior to RSA proper (see the Experimental section and Fig. S3† for details). This enables a controlled reduction of the residual amount of solvent in the sample prior to RSA, in turn allowing RSA to run at a slightly higher supersaturation level. Indeed, the modified RSA scheme successfully delivers films with apparent grain size of 360 nm on average and up to 1 μm, while achieving a significantly lower pinhole count (see Fig. 1b). Interestingly, modified RSA on planar FTO results in Rb3Sb2I9 films that, while also presenting a maximum apparent grain size of 1 μm, manifest a significantly lower pinhole count and smaller pinhole size (Fig. S7†)—denoting a slight sensitivity of RSA to the details of the substrate surface.
HTVA also delivers a dramatic apparent grain size enhancement. When HTVA is conducted at around 180 °C, the apparent grain size increases up to 400 nm (Fig. S8†) (average at ≈200 nm; compare with the average of 130 nm in CP films), while at temperatures approaching 225 °C it becomes as large as ≈1 μm (average at ≈410 nm) (Fig. 1b and c). Considering that the SbI3 vapor in HTVA serves as a means of preventing the loss of SbI3 from the Rb3Sb2I9 films, the domain growth attained with HTVA (Fig. 1b) can be related to the kinetic enhancement resulting from the high temperature used in this process. Further, inspection of Fig. 1b reveals that HTVA produces the same qualitative outcome as RSA. However, the quantitative comparison (Fig. 1c) based on the apparent grain size distributions reveals that HTVA in fact leads to films with slightly larger apparent grain size. While it could be extrapolated that higher temperatures would lead to even bigger grains, however, we found that HTVA-processed Rb3Sb2I9 films become optically transparent for annealing temperatures higher than 250 °C (Fig. S9†). This is likely due to the exhaustion of the SbI3 source—due the complete evaporation of the initial amount of SbI3 powder, which condenses and recrystallizes on the upper half of the container inner surface.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all Rb3Sb2I9 film types (i.e., CP-, RSA-, and HTVA-processed) present peaks (Fig. 2a) that conform to the 2D perovskite structure (Fig. 2b) reported in the literature.36 The grain size estimated using the Scherrer method52 (assuming 0.9 as the value of the shape factor due to the cubic shape of the domains imaged via SEM,53 and taking into account the instrumental broadening) is significantly smaller than the size of the grain-like domains observed from SEM. It is therefore clear that the grain-like domains imaged via SEM consist of several smaller crystallites. Owing to the high complexity of the diffraction pattern of Rb3Sb2I9 (see reference pattern54 in Fig. 2a), each of the measured peaks in the XRD patterns is in fact composed of several diffraction peaks (see Fig. S10†). Therefore, we were not able to reliably obtain further details, such as the trend in the crystallite size. Nonetheless, these XRD measurements are insightful insofar as they reveal that the SEM-derived domains consist of several smaller crystallites.

(c) Optical absorption spectra of Rb3Sb2I9 films processed via CP, RSA, and HTVA. Inset: Tauc plots of a CP sample. 

Fig. 2c illustrates the absorbance spectra of Rb3Sb2I9 films (200 nm thick) deposited via CP, RSA, and HTVA, as derived from UV-visible spectrophotometry. The apparent in-band absorption coefficient of all films is in the region of 1 × 105 cm−1 (i.e., comparable to that of mainstream lead-halide perovskites) (see Fig. S11†). This indicates that 200–300 nm thick films can absorb >90% of the in-band photons when embedded within a sandwich-type device structure. All films give an absorption onset of approximately 600 nm, which suggests potential for top-cells in tandem photovoltaics and indoor photovoltaics. For instance, in the Shockley–Queisser limit, a semiconductor with a bandgap such as Rb3Sb2I9 could deliver a power conversion efficiency in the region of 30% in combination with crystalline silicon.55,56 In the broader optoelectronics domain, the absorption properties of our Rb3Sb2I9 films are suitable for green-blue photodetection.57–59 Additionally, an absorption onset of around 600 nm indicates an excellent match with indoor light sources, therefore pointing to the significant potential of Rb3Sb2I9 for indoor light harvesting.24 The direct and indirect optical gap values extracted from the corresponding Tauc plots are 2.24 eV and 2.1 eV, respectively (inset of Fig. 2c) (these values are independent from the adopted deposition process; see Fig. S11†). The two types of transition are particularly close in energy, consistent with the literature.35,36
The ionization energy of CP Rb3Sb2I9 films determined from Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) is at 5.56 eV with respect to vacuum, while the Fermi level lies at 4.41 eV (Fig. S12†). Similar values are obtained from HTVA and RSA films (Fig. S12†). Taking the minimum gap value inferred from the Tauc plots as a good approximation of the electronic gap of Rb3Sb2I9 (in fact, excitonic effects would introduce only a minor correction), we thus estimate that the conduction band minimum is at 3.4 eV below the vacuum level. These key energy levels are in agreement with prior literature.36 In particular, the Fermi level is close to midgap, which suggests that our Rb3Sb2I9 films are potentially well-suited for integration into p–i–n/n–i–p sandwich-type devices.60
For the purpose of assessing their photoconversion potential, we integrated our Rb3Sb2I9 films into devices featuring a planar device stack: FTO|c-TiO2|Rb3Sb2I9|Poly-TPD|Au (c-TiO2, compact titania; Poly-TPD, poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine) (Fig. 3a). The specific choice of hole and electron transport layers follows from energetic considerations. As a standard means of evaluating their photoconversion capability, we characterized the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of our CP, RSA, and HTVA devices under simulated solar illumination (AM1.5G). We stress that such measurements were carried out as they allow a direct comparison with prior relevant literature on Rb3Sb2I9, while, in the optoelectronic domain, Rb3Sb2I9 is most promising for top-cells in tandem photovoltaics, indoor photovoltaics, and blue-green photodetection. The corresponding current density–voltage characteristics are shown in Fig. 3b, while key performance parameters are listed in Table 1. CP-deposited Rb3Sb2I9 films deliver a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.72 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.38%, which are lower than earlier reports utilizing the same (i.e., CP) deposition method but featuring a mesoporous device architecture (Table 2, ref. 36 and 37).

This suggests that compact Rb3Sb2I9 films with small grains inherently suffer from poor photovoltaic performance, hence they benefit from the mesoporous photogeneration/charge collection aid (in the form of mesoporous TiO2) employed in all prior works (Table 2, ref. 35, 36 and 37). Devices comprising RSA and HTVA films deliver significantly higher PCE values, up to 1.11% and 1.35%, respectively—a more-than-threefold improvement on the CP case. This boost primarily results from a threefold rise in Jsc (5.50 mA cm−2 and 5.54 mA cm−2 in RSA and HTVA samples, respectively). It is noteworthy that in some instances HTVA devices deliver a Jsc as large as 6.35 mA cm−2 (Fig. S13†). Furthermore, while all methods deliver J–V characteristics under AM1.5G illumination with only minor hysteresis (Fig. S14†), the latter is in fact smallest in HTVA samples (see hysteresis index values in Fig. 3b). Finally, the distribution of the key photovoltaic parameters of CP, HTVA, and RSA devices is provided in Fig. S15.†
These results enable a fresh assessment of the photoconversion and photovoltaic potential of Rb3Sb2I9: films with improved microstructure (e.g., HTVA-processed) deliver not only state-of-the-art PCE, but also the highest Jsc of all Rb3Sb2I9 devices under AM1.5G illumination reported to date (Table 2). Importantly, this is achieved while relying on the inherent charge photogeneration and transport properties of Rb3Sb2I9, i.e., without the use of a mesoporous TiO2 layer serving as a photogeneration/collection aid—as explored in earlier reports (Table 2). To put this in context, the maximum possible theoretical photocurrent density36 for a semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.24 eV (as Rb3Sb2I9) is ∼10 mA cm−2. By reaching up to ∼65% of this theoretical limit (Fig. S13†), high-quality Rb3Sb2I9 films enable a significant leap forward toward their optimum photocurrent performance. Additionally, the considerable photocurrent increase with respect to the prior state of the art (relying on a mesoporous architecture) indicates that efficient photogeneration in Rb3Sb2I9 does not require a distributed interface with TiO2, notwithstanding that the primary photoexcitations at the absorption edge in Rb3Sb2I9 expectedly have an excitonic character.
An inner view of the photoconversion process in the three Rb3Sb2I9 film types is offered by their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3c). All of them manifest an onset at around 600 nm and show good agreement with the absorption data. In particular, HTVA and RSA films deliver a maximum EQE of 65.4% and 61.9%, ≈2.5 times higher than that of CP films (maximum EQE of 25.2%). In fact, to the best of our knowledge, HTVA Rb3Sb2I9 films achieve the highest EQE reported to date not only for Sb-halide perovskite derivatives, but also for all electronically and structurally akin Bi-halide perovskite derivatives—i.e., for all compounds with formula A3M2X9, A+: organic/inorganic cation, M: Sb3+/Bi3+, and X−: halide anion (Tables 2 and S2†). As a consistency check, the calculated current densities under AM1.5G illumination derived from the EQE spectra of HTVA and RSA films (Fig. 3c) amount to 5.05 mA cm−2 and 4.64 mA cm−2, respectively, showing a close match with the experimental Jsc values (≈5.5 mA cm−2).
The remarkable boost in photoconversion efficiency is obviously associated with the improved film quality of HTVA- and RSA-processed Rb3Sb2I9 over the CP-processed counterpart. In fact, the observed PCE/EQE trend qualitatively reflects the same trend in apparent grain size. Notwithstanding the obvious role of microstructure, the photoconversion efficiency is in fact a direct manifestation of the capability of photogenerated charges to reach the respective electrodes prior to recombination. Microscopic insight into the observed performance boost can thus be gained by ascertaining the impact of the microstructure on the microscopic optoelectronic properties such as recombination and charge transport. Photocurrent-optical power (Iph − Popt) characteristics—which we measured on HTVA and CP devices under pulsed illumination (Fig. 4a)—provide valuable insight into the recombination behavior of different types of Rb3Sb2I9 films (in view of the similar photoconversion efficiencies of HTVA- and RSA-processed Rb3Sb2I9, in the following we shall only refer to the former when discussing high-quality films and corresponding devices). These characteristics conform to a linear trend at low and at high optical power densities (up to levels comparable to AM1.5G illumination), while at intermediate power values a sublinear trend emerges.
 Fig. 4  (a) Photocurrent–optical power (Iph − Popt) characterization under pulsed illumination at λ = 505 nm and in short-circuit conditions acquired from CP and HTVA devices. (b) Schematic depiction of the one-center model rationalizing the observed Iph − Popt dependence. 
Within the classic framework originally developed by A. Rose61 and further elaborated upon by R. H. Bube,62 the observed behavior is consistent with one-center recombination through defect states of the same class (i.e., with similar electron and hole capture cross-sections) yet located at different energies in the forbidden gap (Fig. 4b) (e.g., see Sections 2.2.6 and 2.2.8 of ref. 61 and pp. 336–337 and Fig. 11.3-1a of ref. 62). This is not to be confused with the two-center model also reported by the same authors, which involves defect states of significantly different capture cross-sections and corresponds to a superlinear photocurrent-power dependence (Iph ∝ Pqopt, q > 1)—hence, having no relationship with our experimentally observed trend. Consistently with the one-center model, in our system at low optical power only some of the defect states (i.e., approximately the ones embraced within the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels) act as recombination centers. Therefore, a constant photosensitivity ensues (Iph ∝ Pqopt, q = 1) (Fig. 4a and b). As the optical power increases, the quasi-Fermi levels move closer to the band edges, eventually embracing further defect states, which turn into additional recombination centers. The resulting increase in the number of recombination centers causes the photosensitivity to drop with optical power, i.e., Iph ∝ Pqopt with q < 1 (sublinear region) (Fig. 4a and b). Finally, at sufficiently high power, all defect states fall within the quasi-Fermi levels, hence the photosensitivity is again a constant, i.e., Iph ∝ Pqopt with q = 1 (Fig. 4a and b). In view of the consistency of this model with our findings, the photosensitivity reduction in the sublinear region (see arrows in Iph − Popt plot, Fig. 4a) expectedly relates to the number of corresponding defect states that turn into recombination centers. Additionally, we infer that these states are located around the same energy within the forbidden gap in both HTVA and CP films, considering that the sublinear region in both occurs over the same Popt values (Fig. 4a). As the photosensitivity reduction is more pronounced in the CP case (Fig. 4a), we thus conclude that HTVA samples present a significantly smaller concentration of such recombination centers.
The photoconversion efficiency of Rb3Sb2I9 also relates to its charge transport capabilities. We thus investigated the carrier mobility of our Rb3Sb2I9 films via Hall effect characterization (Fig. 5). We conducted this investigation on samples with van der Pauw structure, incorporating the same Rb3Sb2I9 films that we employed in our sandwich-type devices discussed earlier. In view of the large resistivity we experimentally measured from the van der Pauw samples, we specifically resorted to a Hall effect characterization methodology that involves applying a sinusoidally modulated (AC) magnetic field and concurrently sensing the Hall voltage via a lock-in amplifier. This has been known in the specialized Hall effect literature to overcome the challenges associated with the Hall effect characterization of high-resistivity samples, which can lead to measurement artifacts due to geometric non-idealities and thermoelectric effects.63 In fact, AC-magnetic-field Hall effect characterization has been successful in characterizing semiconductors with Hall mobility values well below 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.63–65 AC-magnetic-field Hall characterization was conducted on our samples under a magnetic field of 0.42 T modulated at 100 mHz. The near-invariance of the extracted Hall mobility with respect to the excitation current indicates that such samples conform to the basic Hall effect model (Fig. 5a). In particular, from such measurements we obtained that HTVA films give an average Hall mobility of 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1, while in CP films this amounts to 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1. The large mobility difference between CP and HTVA films can be attributed to their different microstructure. Indeed, CP films consist of domains with average lateral size approximately equal to 130 nm, while the same dimension is of the order of 400 nm in HTVA films. Therefore, CP films have a higher density of domain boundaries. As domain boundaries are expected to pose a limitation on charge transport, the significantly lower density of domain boundaries in HTVA films is consistent with their much higher experimental charge carrier mobility.

Our experimental photocurrent-power characteristics and Hall effect measurements jointly allow us to qualitatively explain the performance improvement attained with our high-quality Rb3Sb2I9 films. Indeed, we have found that HTVA films feature a smaller density of recombination centers (as derived from the experimental photocurrent-optical power characteristics) and larger carrier mobility (as derived from Hall effect measurements). In turn, the photoconversion efficiency is expected to improve with carrier mobility and with a reduction in the concentration of recombination centers. Indeed, the photocurrent scales with the mobility-lifetime product μτ (e.g., Jph ∝ μτ according to a basic model formulation66–68). At a quantitative level, the specific EQE/photocurrent figures may result from the convolution of effects such as: the specifics of the carrier photocurrent-voltage dependence beyond the basic model Jph ∝ μτ; the dependence of carrier mobility and lifetime on crystalline orientation and on optical power; electric field non-uniformities in the photoactive layer; difference in optical losses in the films. Overall, however, our findings are consistent with the fact that the microstructural improvement in our HTVA films has a favorable impact on their charge transport and photoconversion efficiency.
Conclusion
Our study presents strategies that improve the thin-film microstructure of Rb3Sb2I9—an emerging lead-free perovskite derivative—and evaluates the impact of such improvement in terms of optoelectronic properties and device behavior. To the end of enhancing the film quality, we develop deposition strategies based on the control of the supersaturation level and on the high-temperature annealing in excess precursor vapor. These strategies enable an appreciable increase in the apparent grain size of compact Rb3Sb2I9 films. Embedded into sandwich-type devices with a planar architecture, these films demonstrate high photoconversion efficiency. For instance, they deliver a peak EQE of 65.4%, the highest reported to date for antimony-halide perovskite derivatives and bismuth-halide homologs (i.e., compounds with formula A3M2X9, A+: organic/inorganic cation, M: Sb3+/Bi3+, and X−: halide anion). Additionally, such high-quality films give a short-circuit photocurrent under AM1.5G illumination up to within 35% of the radiative limit. The merit of such performance improvement achieved with our high-quality Rb3Sb2I9 films is particularly evident if one considers that it has been attained with a planar device architecture—i.e., doing without a mesoporous transport layer to aid charge extraction, as generally adopted with lead-free antimony-/bismuth-based perovskite derivatives in view of their alleged charge extraction limitations. In perspective, our findings show that Rb3Sb2I9 has approached photoconversion efficiency figures that motivate the exploration of this material for use in top-cells for tandem photovoltaics, indoor photovoltaics, and photodetection.
Building on the observed performance improvement, we also present an optoelectronic characterization so as to provide insight into the capabilities and potential of our high-quality Rb3Sb2I9 films. Hall effect and photocurrent-power characteristics allow us to establish that the microstructural improvement leads to a considerable increase in charge carrier mobility and a reduction in the number of recombination centers, which thus rationalize the associated photovoltaic performance boost. Therefore, it can be envisaged that the processing strategies we have developed for the microstructural and optoelectronic improvement of Rb3Sb2I9 could be also pursued with other emerging antimony-/bismuth-based perovskite derivatives, potentially leading to the enhancement of their optoelectronic properties and device performance.
By demonstrating a considerable improvement in microstructure and photoconversion efficiency of Rb3Sb2I9 in compact thin-film form, and by providing fresh insight into its photoconversion and photovoltaic properties, this work constitutes an important step for the advancement of lead-free antimony-halide perovskite derivatives and related compounds for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.
Experimental section
Materials
RbI (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), SbI3 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.8%, J&K), toluene (99.5%, Yonghua Chemistry), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich), [N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bisphenylbenzidine] (Poly-TPD) (MW = 6000–20000, Lumtec), chlorobenzene (99.8%, J&K).
Perovskite film deposition
All steps of the perovskite film deposition (including solution preparation and annealing) were carried out in an N2 filled glove box. 79.6 mg of RbI powder and 125.6 mg of SbI3 powder (3:2 molar ratio) were dissolved in 0.5 mL of DMF (target solution concentration of 0.25 M). The solution was heated at 75 °C for more than 2 h and subsequently filtered (PTFE filter, pore size 0.22 μm). In regard to CP and HTVA samples, the solution was deposited as reported by Harikesh et al.36 In regard to RSA samples, the solution was spin coated as reported by Harikesh et al.36 except for the final toluene washing step, which was performed after annealing the samples at 120 °C. In particular, after depositing the perovskite films, HTVA samples were treated as follows: four substrates (13.3 × 15.3 mm2) were placed in a closed glass container (250 mL in volume) together with 50 mg of SbI3 powder; the container was placed on a hotplate at 225 °C for 10 min; the temperature was then lowered to 150 °C and maintained at this level for 10 min; finally, the substrates were taken out of the container and allowed to cool down. In particular, after depositing the perovskite films, RSA samples were treated as follows: a substrate coated with an as-deposited film (without washing with toluene) was placed on a hotplate at 50 °C for 1 min; the substrate was then turned over onto a clean glass substrate placed on a hotplate at 120 °C (10 min); the substrate was then spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s while dispensing 100 μL of toluene so as to remove excess SbI3; the substrate was finally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min.
Thin film characterization
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were acquired with a ZEISS SUPRA 55 field-emission electron microscope under high vacuum (electron energy = 5 keV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured with an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with monochromatic 4 Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength = 1.5406 Å). UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer UV-vis spectrophotometer. UPS spectra were acquired with a Kratos Analytical Himadzu X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were acquired with a ZEISS SUPRA 55 field-emission electron microscope under high vacuum (electron energy = 15 keV).
Device fabrication
Glass substrates with pre-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes (Liaoning Youxuan New Energy Technology Co.) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone, and ethyl alcohol (10 min each). After drying with N2 gas, they were treated with O2 plasma (15 min). The substrates were then coated with a compact TiO2 layer: the precursor solution was prepared (in an N2 filled glove box) according to a procedure reported in the literature;69 the solution (40 μL per substrate) was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (in an N2 filled glove box); samples were then annealed at 450 °C for 40 min (in air). Subsequently, perovskite films were deposited according to the procedures detailed earlier. 10 mg of Poly-TPD powder was dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene; the solution (40 μL per substrate) was then spin coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s (in an N2 filled glove box). Finally, 40 nm-thick gold electrodes were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask defining an active area of 0.0725 cm2.
Device and optoelectronic characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V), PCE, and EQE measurements were measured with a source-meter unit (Keithley 2400). The illumination source for EQE measurements was a monochromated broadband light source (Zolix Omni-λ200i), while PCE measurements relied on a simulated AM1.5G source (100 mW cm−2, Xenon lamp, Newport). The Hall-effect characterization was conducted with an electromagnet-based system (Lakeshore 8404) at room temperature, in air, and in the dark. Samples in the van der Pauw configuration were subjected to an AC magnetic field of 0.42 T (modulated at 100 mHz) and an excitation current in the 100–500 pA range. Transient photocurrent measurements were conducted with an LED source (OSRAM LV CK7P), the device photocurrent being acquired with a current amplifier (DHPCA-100) and an oscilloscope (Pico5444B).
