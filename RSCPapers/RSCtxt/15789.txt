In the last two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been extensively studied for photovoltaic applications because of their low cost and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1 Since light-harvesting is the key process in the DSC device, much effort has been devoted to increasing the absorptivity of the dyes.2 Ruthenium polypyridine dyes have remarkable performance originating from their strong absorption in the visible region and long-lived charge-separated states such as N3- and N719-sensitized solar cells.3 Progress in optimizing the ruthenium based sensitizers for DSCs has been focused primarily on enhancing the light-harvesting ability and even exhibiting panchromatic light-harvesting bands.4 Some research groups have achieved this goal by extending the conjugated lengths of the anchoring and/or ancillary ligands of ruthenium dyes,5 although it is still not very clear why the beneficial chromophores will improve the light-harvesting capability of complex dyes.
A few organic light-harvesting chromophores, such as thiophene and carbazole, have been employed for the synthesis of ruthenium dyes to enhance their PCEs,6 because they possess the common donor–π–acceptor structural arrangements and can act as the electron donors and π linkers.7 However, to our knowledge, there is only one report on two ruthenium dyes having bpy/thiophene/carbazole based ancillary ligands with one tert-C4H9 or n-C7H15 chain at the 9 position of the carbazole ring.8 In our previous reports, a series of 3,8 and 5,6 substituted 1,10-phenanthroline heterocyclic aromatic compounds have been synthesized and their photoresponsive properties investigated.9 Herein we report the design and syntheses of two new isomeric ruthenium dyes (BM1 and BM2 depicted in Scheme 1) containing 2-thiophenimidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (TIP) based ancillary ligands with an electron-donating 9-phenylcarbazole tail at the α or β position of the thiophene unit, where four types of heterocycles (1,10-phenanthroline, imidazole, thiophene and 9-phenylcarbazole) are incorporated into one molecule. A pair of isomeric ancillary ligands 3 and 4 was used to further reveal the influence of ligand conjugation on the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer by comparing their photovoltaic performance on DSCs.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for two isomeric ruthenium sensitizers BM1 and BM2 together with two organic ones OM1 and OM2. 
Unlike the traditional one-pot synthetic approach, a stepwise method is used to synthesize the ruthenium complexes where every intermediate is isolated and characterized including two single crystals of 1 and 2 (Fig. 1a and b). The reaction of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 with the ancillary ligands 3 and 4 in a 1:2 stoichiometry in dry methanol resulted in the formation of mononuclear Ru(II) complexes 5 and 6. After the chromatographic column purification, a DMF solution of the anchoring ligand dcbpy (4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine) was then added, together with excess ammonium thiocyanate, to produce the desired ruthenium sensitizers BM1 and BM2, respectively.

In addition, another pair of organic isomers (OM1 and OM2), having similar extended 9-phenylcarbazole moieties at the α or β position of the thiophene ring, has been prepared10 and used for the determination of PCE for comparison. By checking the latest version of CCDC databases (ConQuest Version 1.14 (Build RC5), CSD Version 5.34 updated to November 2013), it is found that there are only two examples on thiophene substituted 2-cyano-acrylic acid derivatives in the literature.11 Hence, OM1 is structurally characterized in this work, as shown in Fig. 1c.
X-ray single-crystal structural analyses for compounds 1, 2 and DMF solvate of OM1 reveal that the carbazole and thiophene rings are essentially coplanar with the dihedral angles between them being 14.5(1)° in 1, 20.2(1)° in 2 and 14.6(2)° in OM1·DMF. In contrast, the dihedral angles between carbazole and phenyl rings are much larger, as 79.3(2)° in 1, 54.8(1)° in 2 and 52.8(2)° in OM1·DMF.
The electronic absorption spectra of three dyes and N3 measured in DMF are displayed in Fig. 2, and their optical data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of the BM1 shows a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) peak centered at 525 nm (band I), which is a little blue-shifted in comparison with that of N3. However, the absorption centered at 385 nm (band II), which is assigned as the ancillary ligand localized transition, is much stronger than that of N3 because of incorporating the 9-phenylcarbazole substituted thiophene moiety at the α position in the ancillary ligand. Actually, band II of BM1 is stronger than those reported for the bpy/thiophene/carbazole system,8 and the molar extinction coefficient (ε) can reach as high as 5.09 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 385 nm. In contrast, band II of BM2 is much weaker since the 9-phenylcarbazole substitution at the β position of the thiophene ring in the ancillary ligand. Instead, BM2 exhibits a very strong absorption peak at 296 nm (band III) with a high ε value of 1.05 × 103 M−1 cm−1), which is similar to a previously reported two ruthenium dyes containing phenothiazine or the N,N-diphenylamino substituted group at the β position of the thiophene unit.6a The alteration of UV-vis spectra on absorption bands II and III in the cases of BM1 and BM2 is suggested to be a reflection of their different π conjugation systems, which means that the α 9-phenylcarbazole substituted TIP has a much better delocalized π electron system than the corresponding β substituted one. In addition, similar variations on the absorption bands II and III for OM1 and OM2 can be observed.

The electrochemical data in Table 1 show that BM1 and BM2 have the same oxidation potential, and the energy levels of the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) for two sensitizers are almost the same since they have close absorption onsets (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is suggested that the driving force for electron injection from the excited dye into the TiO2 conduction band for two sensitizers is similar.
With regard to two pairs of isomeric compounds BM1/BM2 and OM1/OM2, considering the great discrepancy of their UV-vis absorptions, a distinguishable photovoltaic performance on DSCs could be expected. So we have carried out the corresponding DSC determination. The DSCs in our experiments consist of a transparent FTO conducting glass electrode, a Pt count electrode and a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte is composed of 0.6 M 1,2-dimetyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide, 0.5 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.05 M iodine in acetonitrile.
The photocurrent density–voltage curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSCs based on these dyes and N3 under the AM1.5 sunlight illumination are shown in Fig. 3. It is noted that the DSC based on BM1 reaches a PCE value of 7.33%, which is 21% higher than that of the N3-sensitized solar cell (6.07%) under the same cell fabrication and efficiency measuring procedures. The efficiency of BM2 based cell (5.33%) is lower than that of the cell based on BM1, which is consistent with the results of their UV-vis absorption and IPCE spectra. The efficiency of the OM1 sensitized solar cell (2.40%) is much lower than BM1, and the OM2 sensitized solar cell (0.34%) is also much lower than OM1 mainly originating from their different UV-vis absorptions. That means we must find a way to alter the PCEs of traditional ruthenium and organic dyes by introducing the same electron donors and π linkers into the ancillary ligands at different substituted positions.

(b) IPCE spectra of the photovoltaic devices with different photosensitizers. 
It is known that the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of dye molecules play important roles in the electron-transfer processes in DSC cells. To further reveal the characteristics of π-conjugated dyes, the optimized molecular structures for BM1 and BM2, as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of their calculated highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and LUMO energy levels are shown in Fig. 4. All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program.13 The resulting HOMO–LUMO gaps for TIP-incorporated ligands 3 and 4 are 3.52 and 3.81 eV, respectively, while those for complexes BM1 and BM2 are much smaller at 2.49 and 2.50 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with their UV-vis absorptions. The LUMOs of BM1 and BM2 are delocalized homogeneously on the anchoring ligand as expected. However, different from BM2, the HOMO of BM1 is populated among Ru-t2g, NCS− and π orbital of the ancillary ligand. That means the ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition may preferentially occur between the ancillary ligand and the ruthenium center in BM1, which makes the electron transfer and injection process to the anchoring ligand and even TiO2 more effective, and finally gives rise to the improvement of its PCE.

In summary, we have prepared two new ruthenium based dyes (BM1 and BM2) in which a 9-phenylcarbazole tail was introduced at the α or β position of the thiophene unit in the TIP skeleton, respectively, forming two isomeric ancillary ligands with four heterocycles (1,10-phenanthroline, imidazole, thiophene and 9-phenylcarbazole). A distinguishable photovoltaic performance on DSCs has been achieved with the PCEs of 7.33% and 5.33% for BM1 and BM2 in comparison with 6.07% for the standard N3-dye, which is believed to originate from their π conjugated structures of isomeric ancillary ligands evidenced by their different UV-vis absorption spectra. Analogous phenomena can also be found for another pair of organic isomers (OM1 and OM2) having a similar extended 9-phenylcarbazole moiety at the α or β position of the thiophene ring. We believe BM1 and BM2 are good model molecules for investigations on the DSC performance of ancillary ligands in ruthenium sensitizers. The current comparative study not only reports a ruthenium complex (BM1) with high performance on DSCs, but also demonstrates an effective approach to improve the PCEs for ruthenium dyes merely by introducing the same electron donors and π linkers into the ancillary ligands at different substituted positions.
