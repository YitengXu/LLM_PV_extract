    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 1st June 2020AbstractMolybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is one of the promising electrochemical energy storage materials among the recently explored 2D materials beyond the extensively studied graphene sheets. However, MoS2 in the form of quantum sheets (QSs) has not yet been examined for use in energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). Here, we demonstrate the superior electrochemical charge-storage properties of exfoliated MoS2 QSs (with lateral size in the range of 5 to 10 nm) for the first time. A salt-assisted ball milling process was used to prepare MoS2 QSs in gram scale that leads to size confinement in both lateral and vertical orientations. The electrochemical analysis of MoS2 QSs indicated their superior capacitive properties compared to the bulk MoS2, which originates from the combination of quantum capacitance and electrochemical capacitance. The device specific properties of MoS2 QSs were studied by constructing a flexible symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) that demonstrated a high device capacitance (162 F g−1), energy density (14.4 Wh kg−1), good rate capability, and long cycle life. The energy storage performance metrics of MoS2 QSs based SSC device were superior compared to the state-of-art MoS2 based supercapacitors. Furthermore, a solar-driven wireless charging power system comprising the fabricated MoS2 QSs-based SSC as an energy storage device is illustrated in the view of expanding its utility towards practical applications.
1. Introduction
In this modern era, energy storage devices such as batteries and ultra-capacitors have received great attention in day-to-day life because of their versatile applications in the field of portable and wearable energy storage systems.1 Remarkably, supercapacitors are well recognized for their specific-power and extraordinary cycle life compared to those of conventional Li-ion batteries.1 However, supercapacitors have the drawback of low energy density which is a major challenge that needs to be overcome for future development towards commercialization.2 Furthermore, the development of ideal energy storage materials with high energy density is of imperative demand in our advanced society to control the energy crisis.2 Concerning the increase in energy demand and detrimental environmental pollution, researchers have been comprehensively focusing on the development of novel materials (graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), MXenes, siloxene) as energy storage materials.3 Among 2D materials, MoS2 is the most anticipated material following graphene sheets because of their unique size dependent physico-chemical properties, high theoretical capacity, and high surface area.4 Usually, MoS2 occurs as four major polymorphs such as the metastable tetragonal phase (1T), thermodynamically stable hexagonal phases (1H and 2H), and the rhombohedral phase (3R).5 Here, the 1T phase of MoS2 displays a metallic nature whereas 2H and 3R phases of MoS2 exhibit semiconducting properties with a bandgap from 1.3–1.9 eV.6 The distinct electrical and electrochemical properties of MoS2 make them a highly promising material in various fields including batteries and supercapacitors.5,7 In addition, MoS2 being a layered material containing S–Mo–S stacked layers attached via Van der Waals forces with multiple oxidation states of Mo element (from +2 to +6) facilitates enhanced charge storage via ion intercalation and reversible redox process during electrochemical reactions.8 To explore the size dependent physical and electrochemical properties of MoS2, researchers have employed to date various strategies to synthesize different architectures of MoS2 such as nano/microsheets,9 spherical structures7,10 flower-like structures,11,12 nanoribbons,13,14 nanotubular6 and flake-like morphologies.15 2D materials with further reduction in dimensions to the quantum scale can result in the formation of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum sheets (QSs), which are nanostructures that have emerged recently with immense potential in electrochemical energy storage-devices.16–19
The electrochemical performances of materials in the form of QSs are not yet completely understood.20 Recently, Zhang et al. reported a novel synthesis strategy for the preparation of MoS2 and WS2 2D QSs from their bulk counterparts via using salt/silica-assisted mechanical milling followed by a liquid-phase delamination process. In their study, the prepared MoS2 and WS2 QSs possessed a lateral size of approximately <10 nm that results in distinct physico-chemical characteristics due to the quantum confinement effect and edge effects.21,22 The supercapacitive properties of TMCs in the form of QSs have not yet been studied whereas some studies reported the use of graphene QSs in the hydrogen evolution reaction.23 It is reported that the supercapacitive performance of MoS2 sheets could be improved by reducing the morphology, layer thickness, and lateral dimensions.24,25 Here, we expected that the quantum confinement effect in MoS2 might also lead to enhanced electrochemical properties. Therefore, in this work, we investigated the charge-storage properties of 2D MoS2 QSs prepared via a salt-assisted ball milling method as a novel electrode for solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs).
2. Results and discussion
This work employs a top down approach based on a salt assisted mechanical milling method for conversion of bulk MoS2 to MoS2 QSs for next generation flexible supercapacitors. Fig. 1 shows the schematic illustration of the salt assisted ball milling followed by ultrasound-assisted exfoliation used for the preparation of MoS2 QSs. Compared to the conventional wet milling process for the production of MoS2 nanosheets, the salt assisted milling produced a further reduction in size and the number of layers, which is due to the shear stress induced by the sodium chloride crystals on the bulk MoS2 during the milling process.21

The structural elucidation of the bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs was carried out using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) as given in Fig. 2(A–L). The HR-TEM micrographs of the bulk MoS2 (Fig. 2(A–D)) obtained at various magnification scales indicated that the lateral size of bulk MoS2 ranged from 500 to 1000 nm. The SAED pattern (inset given in Fig. 2(D)) shows a continuous ring-like structure suggesting the presence of more number of stacked layers in the bulk MoS2.26 The interlayer spacing of bulk MoS2 sheets is found to be 0.576 nm from Fig. 2(D). Fig. 2(E–J) depict the HR-TEM micrographs of the prepared MoS2 QSs obtained at various magnification scales which clearly show a significant reduction in the lateral size of MoS2 sheets. The salt-assisted ball milling strategy resulted in the formation of MoS2 QSs with lateral size in the range of 5 to 10 nm. In addition to confinement in lateral dimensions, Fig. 2(J) reveals the interlayer spacing of MoS2 QSs is also increased to 0.79 nm (in comparison with bulk MoS2). Fig. 2(K) presents the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of MoS2 QSs which clearly reveals the presence of a hexagonal lattice structure.26 The decrease in lateral dimension with expanded interlayer spacing in the MoS2 QSs is due to the intercalation of Na+ into the layers of bulk MoS2 sheets during the milling process. Fig. 2(L) depicts the corresponding SAED pattern of MoS2 QSs which clearly indicated the presence of few-layered QSs.26Fig. 3(A and B) present the AFM 2D and 3D topographs of the MoS2 QSs which shows the presence of nanometric size MoS2 sheets in the dimension of 5 to 15 nm (from Fig. 3(A)) with height or thickness up to a maximum of 1.8 nm (from Fig. 3(B)) suggesting the presence of bi- or tri-layered MoS2 QSs. Additionally, section analysis was also performed at specific regions to map the thickness of the MoS2 QSs as shown in Fig. 3(C and D). The section analysis (Fig. 3(C and D)) indicated that the thickness of the 2D MoS2 QSs is about 1.8 nm, i.e., equivalent to two layers of MoS2.27 This finding is in good agreement with the previous work by Y. Zhang et al.21 Furthermore, the AFM findings indicate the presence of two/three layers, in good agreement with the analysis based on the SAED pattern (Fig. 2(L)).

Fig. 4(A) presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of bulk MoS2 which is closely matched with the typical diffraction pattern of the 2H-phase of MoS2. In comparison with bulk MoS2, the XRD pattern of MoS2 QSs showed significant changes such as (i) the peak observed at 2θ = 14.2° (corresponding to the (002) plane) is preserved with little sign of broadening, and (ii) the remaining peaks found in bulk MoS2 were diminished in the XRD pattern. This might be due to the exfoliation and decrease in the lateral dimension as well as layer number of bulk MoS2via the ball milling process. To investigate the optical and quantum structural properties of as-prepared MoS2 QSs, UV-vis spectroscopy was performed as shown in Fig. 4(B). Fig. S1, ESI† presents the digital photograph of an aqueous dispersion containing bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs in DI water which shows significant colour change compared to bulk MoS2. The UV-vis spectrum of bulk MoS2 (Fig. 4(B)) shows absorption bands at 410, 480, 635, and 690 nm indicating the typical characteristic nature of bulk MoS2.19 Similarly, the UV-vis spectrum of MoS2 QSs contains four characteristic absorption bands with an additional band observed at 270 nm, which could be ascribed to the excitonic feature of quantum scale MoS2 sheets (Fig. 4(B)).18,28,29 The absorption bands observed at ∼688 nm (A) and ∼631 nm (B) are attributed to the “K point” of the Brillouin zone.29,30 The strong blue shift observed in the A and B bands of MoS2 QSs in comparison with bulk MoS2 is attributed to a reduction in the lateral size of MoS2. The bands observed at ∼458 nm (C) and ∼403 nm (D) could be assigned to the direct transition of an electron from the deep valence band to the conduction band of layered MoS2.29,30 The UV-vis analysis evidenced that the salt-assisted preparation of MoS2 QSs exhibits quantum confinement along with the edge effect.21,30 Fig. S2, ESI† shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of MoS2 QSs indicating the presence of chemical states such as molybdenum (Mo), sulphur (S), carbon (C), and oxygen (O), respectively. No peaks related to the presence of Na and Cl elements were observed in the XPS spectrum suggesting that NaCl is completely removed during the washing process. The occurrence of O and C signals in the survey spectrum of MoS2 QSs is due to the H2O and CO2 impurities during XPS measurement.31 The deconvoluted XPS core-level spectrum of Mo 3d is provided in Fig. 4(C), which shows two major peaks corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 (228.8 eV) and Mo 3d3/2 (231.5 eV) states, respectively and a minor peak due to the S 2s (225.6 eV) state.25 The deconvolution of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 states suggested the presence of the 1T-MoS2 phase (with minimal 2H phase) in the MoS2 sheets. The prepared MoS2 QSs possess nearly 68% of 1T phase based on the quantification method reported by Acerce et al.25Fig. 4(D) shows the deconvoluted XPS core-level spectrum of S 2p indicating the occurrence of two major peaks corresponding to S 2p1/2 (161.1 eV) and S 2p3/2 (162.2 eV) states of MoS2 QSs.32

Raman spectroscopy is one of the versatile probing techniques used for identifying the vibrational states, bonding nature and determining the number of layers present in 2D materials.33,34 The comparative Raman spectra of bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs are provided in Fig. 5(A). The Raman spectrum of the bulk MoS2 revealed the occurrence of two major vibration bands at 383.5 and 408.8 cm−1 that belong to E12g and A1g modes of MoS2 respectively.24 MoS2 QSs show a red-shift in both the Raman bands from 383.5 to 378.5 cm−1 in E12g mode and 408.5 to 404.5 cm−1 in A1g modes as compared to bulk MoS2. The observed shift in the positions of the Raman bands (E12g and A1g modes) towards lower wavenumbers indicated the reduced layer numbers in MoS2 after the mechanical milling process.35–39 Fig. S3, ESI† shows the Raman spectrum of the single-layer MoS2 QSs (measured on different spots of the prepared sample) which indicated the presence of characteristic J1, J2, and J3 peaks at 156, 226, and 333 cm−1 in addition to the E12g, and A1g modes seen in few-layered sheets.25,40 However, most of the sheets prepared by this method are few-layered sheets, therefore only E12g and A1g modes were observed in the Raman spectrum measured at most of the spots. Laser Raman mapping analysis has been performed to understand the spatial distribution of the MoS2 QSs over an area of −5 × 5 μm2 and the corresponding 3D overlay map is given in Fig. 5(B). Generally, the peak position of E12g and A1g modes, and the associated intensity ratio (E12g/A1g) can be used for determining the number of layers present in MoS2.41Fig. 5(C and D) represent the intensity maps of A1g and E12g modes of MoS2 QSs, and Fig. 5(E) shows the intensity ratio maps of E12g/A1g modes respectively. The intensity ratio map of E12g/A1g shows that the intensity ratio lies in the range of 0.45 to 0.6 over the mapped area, which indicates the presence of bi-/tri-layered MoS2 QSs.42,43 The formation of few-layered MoS2 is due to the mechanical shear stress-induced exfoliation of bulk MoS2 during the ball milling process. The Raman mapping analysis (Fig. 5(B–E)) depicts the existence of few-layered MoS2 QSs, which is concurrent with the SAED pattern of MoS2 QSs.

The presence of quantum confinement effects in the MoS2 QSs has been confirmed using the spectroscopic characterizations discussed above, whereas their effect on the nature of electrochemical charge-storage has not been studied so far. Here, we examined the charge-storage properties of MoS2 QSs (in comparison with bulk MoS2) via a three-electrode (3E) configuration test using 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 6(A) presents the comparative CV profiles of bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs recorded using an applied scan rate of 100 mV s−1 over the potential regime from −0.3 to +0.5 V. Interestingly, the current ranges in the MoS2 QSs electrode were higher compared to that of the bulk MoS2 electrode indicating the superior charge-storage properties compared to bulk MoS2. The shape of the CV profiles of MoS2 QSs electrode was quasi-rectangular in addition to the presence of a minor redox peak. Fig. 6(B) shows that the specific capacitance of the MoS2 QSs electrode is almost 20-fold higher than that of the bulk MoS2 electrode. The mechanism of charge storage at the MoS2 QSs electrode involves the combination of proton intercalation/de-intercalation during the redox reaction and adsorption/desorption of protons at the surface of MoS2,44–46 which can be explained using the following equations: MoS2 + H+ + e− ⇌ MoS–SH+(1) MoS2 + H+ + e− ⇌ MoS2–H(2)

These reactions usually occur in exfoliated MoS2 in which the surface adsorption/desorption process is predominant at high scan rates whereas proton intercalation/de-intercalation is higher at low scan rates. Thus, the capacitance due to these two electrochemical reactions leads to the overall electrochemical capacitance (CE).44 A sole explanation based on the electrochemical capacitance (CE) cannot provide meaningful information about the improved capacitance in MoS2 QSs electrodes. Here, the origin of improved capacitance in the MoS2 QSs electrode can be explained based on two factors: (i) reduction in lateral size (from few μm to <10 nm) and (ii) reduction in stack or layer numbers (less than 5 layers) of the MoS2 QSs as shown in Fig. 6(C). The first factor relies on the lateral size of the MoS2 sheets in which the bulk sheets (see Fig. 6(C)) possess limited ion transport channels due to the large lateral size leading to ionic traffic at the outermost surface of the stack.47 The few-layered MoS2 QSs with ultra-small lateral size result in the opening of numerous ion transport pathways or channels that are not available in the bulk MoS2. The second factor relies on the stack number present in the bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs that result in distinct changes in the crystallographic nature, interlayer spacing, and electron density of these materials when the thickness is reduced to mono- or few layers. The change from bulk to MoS2 QSs results in an increase in interlayer spacing (from 0.57 to 0.79 nm), which in turn can provide sufficient space for the ion transportation inside the cavities of the MoS2 QSs. Furthermore, the reduction in thickness from bulk to MoS2 QSs results in thinning of layers (3 to 5 layers) and phase transformation of semiconducting 2H (bulk) phase into metallic 1T phase MoS2. The associated changes in the electron density on transformation of the 2H phase with paired electrons into 1T phase QSs with two unpaired electrons48 might result in the additional capacitance, i.e., quantum capacitance (CQ). Therefore, the total capacitance (CT) of the MoS2 QSs electrode is due to the combination of electrochemical capacitance (CE) and quantum capacitance (CQ) connected in series as described using the relationship CT = (CE × CQ)/CE + CQ.49 Previous studies revealed the presence of quantum capacitance in reduced graphene oxide sheets (rGO) in comparison with graphene oxide (GO) due to the changes in electron density at the surface of rGO sheets.50
In order to examine the changes in the conductivity and surface charge which might contribute to the quantum capacitance of MoS2 QSs, we have used zeta potential measurements of bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs in the aqueous media (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The zeta potential of the bulk MoS2 and MoS2 QSs is found to be −23.3 and −30.7 mV, which highlights the superior stability and high surface charge of the MoS2 QSs compared to their bulk counterparts.51 The zeta potential of 2D MoS2 QSs indicates that they possess a negatively charged surface, thus it can expedite the cation intercalation reaction.25,52 Furthermore, the conductivity of the 2D MoS2 QSs solution is about 0.970 mS cm−1, which is almost five-fold higher compared to that of the conductivity of the bulk MoS2 (0.183 mS cm−1) solution as evident from Fig. S4, ESI.† Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is used to probe the enhanced charge-storage properties of the MoS2 QSs electrodes over those of the bulk. The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. S5(A), ESI† of the bulk and MoS2 QSs electrodes revealed significant differences as follows: (i) the solution resistance (Rs) of MoS2 QSs electrodes i about 0.9 Ω, which is lower compared to that of the bulk MoS2 electrode (with Rs of 1.8 Ω), (ii) the presence of a quasi-semicircle region is observed in the MoS2 QSs electrode as a result of a minor charge-transfer resistance which occurred due to the intercalation of protons to the MoS2 interlayers, (iii) the magnitude of the Warburg line is lower in the MoS2 QSs electrode compared to that of the bulk MoS2 electrode, and (iv) the Warburg line is closer to the imaginary axis of impedance for the MoS2 QSs electrode compared to that of the bulk MoS2 electrode, thus suggesting the better capacitive nature of the MoS2 QSs.45 Fig. S5(B), ESI† shows the Bode modulus plot (plot of electrochemical impedance vs. applied frequency) which showed that the MoS2 QSs electrode possesses low impedance compared to that of the bulk MoS2 electrode. The obtained low impedance of MoS2 QSs electrodes arises as a result of their excellent conductivity and electrochemical activity compared to the bulk MoS2 sheets.53 Collectively, the findings from zeta potential and EIS analysis indicated that the superior charge-storage properties of the MoS2 QSs electrode might have originated from the ultra-small lateral size and low thickness of the individual MoS2 QS with increased conductivity and surface charge.
To evaluate the energy storage performance of the prepared MoS2 QSs, we fabricated a flexible symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) (Fig. 7(A)) using MoS2 QSs coated carbon cloth electrodes and PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte. Fig. 7(B) represents the cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves of the MoS2 SSC over an operating voltage window of 0.0 to 0.8 V recorded using various scan rates. The CV curve obtained at a low scan rate (5 mV s−1) revealed the presence of quasi-rectangular shaped CV curves as an indication of the ideal capacitive nature of the MoS2 QSs electrode.3 The increase in scan rate (5 to 100 mV s−1) leads to a change of shape from quasi rectangular to parallelogram-like CV curves, which is due to incomplete utilization of the electroactive MoS2 QSs by the electrolyte ions at higher scan rates.45 The charge-storage mechanism of the MoS2 SSC involves the combination of electrochemical capacitance (surface and ion intercalation) and quantum capacitance in the MoS2 QSs. Fig. 7(C) represents the device capacitance of the MoS2 SSC as a function of the applied scan rate. It shows that the MoS2 SSC possesses a maximum specific capacitance of 140 F g−1 (at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1) and the capacitance decreases with an increase in scan rate, which might be due to the limitation in mass transport of the electrolyte ions at higher scan rates. It is noteworthy that the MoS2 SSC exhibited high specific device capacitance compared to the reported MoS2 based SSCs such as MoS2–Ni foam (38.9 F g−1),54 flower-like MoS2 (∼45 F g−1),12 VSL-MoS2 (34.1 F g−1),55 MoS2/rGO/MoS2@Mo (53.33 F g−1),56 s-MoS2/CNS (108 F g−1),57 and f-MoS2 (96 F g−1).57 This better electrochemical performance of the MoS2 SSC could have arisen from the reduction in lateral size and layer numbers of the MoS2 QSs that enables more electroactive ion transport pathways. The Nyquist plot of the MoS2 SSC (given in Fig. 7(D) and the inset shows the enlarged portion of the high-frequency region) revealed the presence of a small semi-circle (at higher frequency regime) followed by a straight line or Warburg impedance (at the low-frequency regime) that was almost parallel to the imaginary axis. Fig. S6, ESI† shows the equivalent circuit model used for the description of EIS analysis, which comprises solution resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), two constant phase elements (CPE1 and CPE2) and Warburg impedance (W). The X-axis intercept obtained at the high-frequency region is about 3.8 Ω, which corresponds to the solution resistance (Rs) or equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the MoS2 SSC.3 The diameter of the semicircle observed at the high-frequency range is around 3.02 Ω, which can be related to charge transfer resistance (Rct).58 The incorporation of two constant phase elements in the equivalent circuit corresponds to the surface capacitance and intercalation pseudocapacitance, which occurred at the MoS2 QSs electrodes in the SSC device, respectively.59,60 The presence of the Warburg element in the model circuit is related to the frequency dependent ion diffusion kinetics that occurred at the electroactive MoS2 QS surface. The Bode phase angle plot of the MoS2 SSC (given in Fig. S7, ESI†) shows that the phase angle is about −67.4° which indicated that the device lies between a capacitor and a battery, i.e., it has a pseudocapacitive nature.59

(E) Galvanostatic charge–discharge profile of the MoS2 SSC measured at various currents (1.0–10.0 mA). (F) Effect of applied current on the specific capacitance of the MoS2 SSC. 
The charge–discharge (CD) profiles of the MoS2 SSC measured at various current ranges (from 1.00 to 10.0 mA) are provided in Fig. 7(E). They exhibited almost a symmetric triangular shape for all the current ranges, thus suggesting their better capacitive property. Fig. S8 (ESI†) presents the continuous CD profiles of the MoS2 SSC recorded at a constant current density of 5.0 mA. The variation in device capacitance of the MoS2 SSC with respect to the applied current is provided in Fig. 7(F). A high device capacitance of 160 F g−1 for the MoS2 SSC was obtained from the CD profile measured at a constant discharge current of 1.00 mA. With the increase in current to 10.0 mA (ten-fold), the MoS2 SSC still possesses a device capacitance of 68 F g−1 suggesting the better rate capability. Table S1, ESI† shows the rate capability metrics of the MoS2 QSs based SSC, which indicates that their metrics are comparable to those of the recently reported SSCs using MoS2, WS2, and siloxene electrodes. The coulombic efficiency (ratio of discharging time to charging time) of the MoS2 SSC is provided in Fig. S9, ESI,† which shows that the coulombic efficiency is above 90% for all the tested current densities, suggesting their better reversibility. The energy and power densities are crucial factors which determine the real-time applications of the SSC.61 Fig. S10, ESI† displays the Ragone plot of the MoS2 SSC which shows a high energy density of 14.46 W h kg−1 (power density of 200 W kg−1) obtained at a constant current of 1.00 mA. With a ten-fold increase in the current range, the MoS2 SSC still possesses an energy density of 6 W h kg−1 whereas the power density increases up to 2000 W kg−1 suggesting the good rate capability of the MoS2 SSC. Fig. 8(A) and Table S2, ESI† show the performance superiority of the MoS2 SSC to the recently reported MoS2 based SSCs and commercial supercapacitors. The specific energy density of the MoS2 SSC was reasonably higher compared to the reported MoS2 based SSCs such as MoS2–Ni foam (5.4 W h kg−1),54 2H-MoS2 (0.16 W h kg−1),6 1T-MoS2 (5 W h kg−1),6 VSL-MoS2 (4.7 W h kg−1),55 MoS2/rGO/MoS2@Mo (6.22 W h kg−1),56 s-MoS2/CNS (7.4 W h kg−1),57 and MoS2 nanospheres (5.42 W h kg−1),62 respectively.

In addition, to evaluate the practical application of the MoS2 SSC for their flexibility, we performed the electrochemical analysis under different bending states as shown in Fig. 8(B and C). The CV and CD profiles of the MoS2 SSC measured at both normal and bent states (under different conditions from 0 to 180°) show no noticeable change in the charge storage performance. A capacitance retention of 98% has been observed for the MoS2 SSC device even after bending at an angle of 180° suggesting their promising use as a flexible energy storage device. These values are comparable to those of recent studies on graphene-, MXene-, and MoS2-based flexible SSCs as evidenced from Table S3, ESI,† which highlights the use of the MoS2 SSC towards flexible energy storage applications. Fig. 8(D) shows the cycle stability tests of the MoS2 SSC measured over 5000 continuous CD cycles at a constant current of 7.50 mA. The MoS2 SSC device shows capacitance retention of about 84% after 5000 cycles, which is high compared to the other reported SSC devices.12,54
Despite their excellent electrochemical energy storage performances and flexible nature, the real-time applications of the MoS2 SSC were also examined. Here, we demonstrate a novel wireless self-charging system via integration of a commercial solar cell to charge the MoS2 SSC device focusing on their application in low power wearable electronics as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9(A) illustrates the solar-driven wireless charging system composed of a commercial solar cell (0.5 W, connecting two devices in parallel), transmitter/receiver system and MoS2 SSC devices. The wireless power transmission will occur via electromagnetic induction mode powered by the solar cell to efficiently charge the MoS2 SSC. The circuit diagram for wireless power transmission has been provided in Fig. S11, ESI.† Fig. S12, ESI† shows the CV profiles of a single MoS2 SSC (Fig. S12(A), ESI†) and two MoS2 SSCs (Fig. S12(B), ESI†) connected in series. Fig. 9(B) shows the real-time image of solar-driven wireless charging of a MoS2 SSC. Fig. 9(C) shows CD profiles of a single MoS2 SSC device using solar driven wireless charging mode, capable of charging efficiently up to 0.8 V within 106 seconds. To meet the energy or power requirements of low power wearable electronic devices we connected two MoS2 SSC devices in series combination, capable of charging up to 1.2 V within 180 seconds successfully. These studies demonstrated the use of the fabricated MoS2 SSCs as a self-powered energy storage system for functional applications.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have prepared MoS2 QSs via a salt-assisted ball milling method and applied them as a supercapacitor electrode for the first time. Interestingly, the MoS2 QSs showed better capacitive properties than the bulk material because of the (i) reduction in lateral size, (ii) reduced stacking numbers, (iii) increase in ion-transport channels (quantum channels), and (iv) presence of the metallic 1T phase in the MoS2 QSs. A symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using MoS2 QSs electrodes showed an excellent energy density of 14.4 Wh kg−1, which is superior to those of the symmetric supercapacitors fabricated using MoS2 reported in the literature. Finally, we have demonstrated the use of the MoS2 QSs based supercapacitor as an ideal energy storage device in the development of wireless driven solar-charging power systems. The important findings of this work validated the use of MoS2 QSs as an exceptional electrode for supercapacitors that can provide new insights on the use of quantum sheets for next-generation energy storage devices.
