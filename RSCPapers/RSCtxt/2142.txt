The assembled nanostructures and consequent properties of PBI aggregates can be tuned by the use of different peptide sequences with improved yield of radical anions and enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency.
Perylene bisimide (PBI), one of the most valuable functional dyes with stable chemical and optical properties, has been applied widely in electronic devices, photonic devices, solar cells etc.1 In particular, PBI radical anions have a strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is called the “biological window” as most biological tissues are highly transparent in this region from 780 to 1300 nm with a low degree of absorption.2 Therefore, such a NIR system has promising bio-applications especially in photothermal therapy and light-triggered drug release.3 However, hydrophobic PBI aromatic cores as well as derived radical anions are inclined to aggregate in aqueous media causing luminescence quenching and a loss of free radical yield, which leads to low photothermal conversion relative to the total input of light energy.4 Several studies have been conducted to overcome the issue via tuning the assembly behaviour of PBI in aqueous media via various ingenious strategies.5 For instance, Würthner and co-workers covalently introduced a bulky substituent onto the bay regions of PBI cores leading to an improvement in PBI radical anion yield in non-aqueous solvents.5b Zhang and co-workers used a host–guest supramolecular strategy to prevent aggregation of PBI aromatic cores and promote the formation of aromatic radical anions in aqueous solution, which improved the photothermal conversion efficiency significantly.5c Nevertheless, tuning the self-assembly behaviour of PBI in aqueous media along with their formed supramolecular structure with enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency in a facile way is still challenging.
Supramolecular self-assembly of sequence-dependent peptide building blocks has become an increasingly attractive strategy to create functional nano-architectures for applications in drug delivery, optoelectronic devices, cell scaffolds, nanofabrication and tumour therapy.6 For instance, the self-assembly of aromatic short peptides which are composed of aromatic groups at the N-terminus and short peptide sequences with only two amino acids is governed by aromatic π-stacking, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions enhancing the recognition between molecules and the sequence of peptide chains.3,7 PBI could be used as an aromatic ligand in peptide building blocks forming nanostructures with photothermal properties. The use of different peptide sequences could easily organize PBI precisely and tune the self-assembled morphologies and consequent physiochemical properties of PBI aggregates, which may enhance the yield of radical anions and photothermal conversion efficiency.8
In this work, we demonstrated that the self-assembly behaviour of PBI in aqueous solution can be regulated by using different di-peptide sequences (glycine–tyrosine, GY, and glycine–aspartic acid, GD) conjugated to PBI cores, which leads to different nanostructures like nanofibers and nanospheres via tunable molecular interactions (as shown in Scheme 1). The obtained nanostructures are highly dependent on the peptide sequences and showed clearly different radical yields and photothermal conversion efficiencies after irradiation by a NIR laser.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures and the self-assembly process of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 and cartoon of radical anions generated by chemical reduction leading to different NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies. 
PBI derivatives conjugated with bola-di-peptides were synthesized by introducing GY or GD at both ends of the perylene moiety (denoted as PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2, respectively; see the ESI† for details). To determine the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 in PBS buffer solution, UV-Vis spectra of the PBI derivatives at different concentrations were recorded. As shown in Fig. S1a and b (ESI†), the maximum absorptions of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 were located at 505 and 502 nm, respectively. The absorption continuously increased from 2 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−4 M with the same spectral shape, indicating no change of aggregate type. By plotting and fitting the maximum absorbance to the concentration (Fig. S1a and b, inset ESI†), the CAC of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 in PBS buffer was calculated to be 0.016 and 0.019 mM, respectively. By changing one amino acid of the di-peptide sequences from tyrosine to aspartic acid, which afforded extra COOH groups and much stronger electrostatic repulsion, the CAC of PBI-[GD]2 compared with PBI-[GY]2 increased. It was also expected that an enhanced hydrophilicity of the side chains of PBI-[GD]2 could influence the consequent fluorescence performance. The fluorescence spectra of PBI-[GY]2 (Fig. S1c, ESI†) showed that a hypsochromic shift occurred from 612 to 594 nm when the concentration of PBI-[GY]2 decreased, suggesting molecules of J-aggregation type.9 In addition, with the decrease of concentrations, the fluorescence intensity strengthened firstly and then weakened due to the dis-assembly of aggregates and dilution of single molecules. In contrast, the emission peak of PBI-[GD]2 was split into two peaks located at 549 and 592 nm with a similar hypsochromic shift and an increasing intensity ratio between the two peaks due to the overlap of emission and absorption spectra when the concentration was decreased (Fig. S1d, ESI†). We reasonably believe that the extra electrostatic repulsion from deprotonated COOH groups caused the reduction of interactions among the hydrophobic PBI moieties, resulting in different fluorescence emission performances.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the self-assembled morphologies of both molecules. Fig. 1(a and b) shows the formation of nanofibers of PBI-[GY]2 with a diameter of around 20 nm and a length up to micrometers in PBS buffer solution, while the nanostructures of PBI-[GD]2 tuned to spherical aggregates with an average diameter of around 50 nm. The difference of molecular interactions between the PBI cores and peptide side chains may cause distinct supramolecular arrangements and self-assembled nanostructures.10 To understand the influence of terminal amino acids on the assembly behaviour, self-assembly processes of both PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 were simulated (see the ESI† for details). Each system contained 24 PBI–peptide solutes, 20000 water molecules and sodium ions equal to the amount of carboxylic groups in the system. All the carboxylic groups are deprotonated due to the aqueous media at pH 8. The simulation results clearly showed that both of these two monomers assembled into nanostructures, in which 18 of PBI-[GY]2 molecules assembled into a nanofiber consistent with the experiment (Fig. 1c), while the PBI-[GD]2 molecules arranged into disordered oligomeric aggregates, as shown in Fig. 1d.
 Fig. 1  (aand b) TEM images of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 assembled in PBS buffer solution, respectively, and (c and d) the corresponding molecular dynamics simulation. 
In the two systems, the stacking distance between two aggregated molecules is 0.323 nm for both systems with a deviance smaller than 0.010 nm statistically (Fig. S2a, ESI†), indicating that the distance is mostly determined by the interactions between the PBI moieties rather than those of terminal amino acids. Besides, the slipped-parallel stacking pattern of PBI moieties results from the larger electron density of the π-surface than that of the edges of the molecules, as revealed by the electrostatic potential map (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Moreover, the angles between two PBI moieties are distributed over 0–40° for PBI-[GY]2, while a maximum distribution at 23° on average is observed for PBI-[GD]2 (Fig. S2c and d, ESI†). This is because the charged aspartic acid based peptide sequences form more intermolecular electrostatic interactions resulting in oligomers. However, the use of protonated tyrosine instead of aspartic acid forms long-range hydrogen bonds. The terminal amino acids also have decisive effects on the assembled structures according to energy differences between the start and end states. At the start state, the solutes randomly disperse in a water box which can be regarded as an aqueous solution. At the end of the simulation, the solutes assemble into nanostructures. The energy difference between the start and end (ΔE) states is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The energy contributions of PBI (including the interactions of PBI–PBI, PBI–water and PBI-ions) are 10.4 and −2.2 kJ mol−1 for the two molecules, respectively. Compared with the typical hydrogen bond energy in the range of 8–40 kJ mol−1, the contributions of PBI are quite small. In contrast, the contributions of the terminal amino acids are significant. The energy contribution of tyrosine is 19.4 kJ mol−1, indicating an energy-disfavoring process, whereas the energy contribution of aspartic acid is −83.8 kJ mol−1 (Table S1, ESI†), indicating a strong energy-favoring process. As shown in Fig. 1d, the aggregated oligomers form dynamic COO−–water–Na+ clusters and COO−–Na+ ion pairs which counterbalance the strong Coulomb repulsive interactions between carboxylic groups and shorten the distance to neighboring oligomer aggregates as the role of charge screening. This seems to indicate an assembling tendency towards an eventual nanosphere.
Then sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) was selected as a reducing agent to produce PBI radical anions. The PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 solutions were constantly bubbled for 30 min with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen in PBS buffer and subsequently injected with freshly prepared Na2S2O4 solution. The colour of the solution changed from red to purplish red immediately, suggesting the formation of PBI radical anions. The UV-Vis data proved the formation of radical anions in PBS buffer as indicated by the decrease of PBI absorption between 400 and 600 nm and the concomitant increase of new absorption bands between 700 and 900 nm. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption bands of the PBI-[GY]2 radical anions appeared at 729 and 813 nm, while those of PBI-[GD]2 radical anions appeared at 726 and 810 nm. Titration experiments with different ratios between PBI derivatives and Na2S2O4 were performed to optimize the yield of radical anions. Fig. 2b shows the characteristic absorption bands of PBI radical anions after reduction, which revealed that the nanostructures of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 reached the maximum yield of PBI radical anions at the ratios (PBI derivatives:Na2S2O4) of 1:0.35 and 1:0.6, respectively. Excess reducing agent is disadvantageous for the production of radical anions with an absorption in the NIR region, as depicted in Fig. 2c. The stronger electrostatic repulsion of charged PBI-[GD]2 causing dissociation of aggregates provided more radical anions, in contrast, the stronger π-stacking interactions of PBI-[GY]2 were predominant and led the molecules to remain in the ground states. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed to provide the direct evidence of the formation of PBI radical anions.5b Both of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 solutions gave typical EPR signals, certifying the existence of free radicals. As displayed in Fig. 2d, intense resonance with a g-factor of 2.0038 can be detected with no hyperfine coupling to the carbon or nitrogen nuclei of the aromatic core, which was consistent with previous observation.5b This also indicated that nanostructures derived from PBI-[GD]2 have more high yield efficiency of PBI radical anions than that of PBI-[GY]2 under the same conditions. Meanwhile, the UV data also indicated that the formed PBI radical anions from PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 could stand for at least 20 min under our experimental conditions (Fig. S3, ESI†), which is stable enough for the following photothermal conversion performance.

PBI radical anions have an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency under the irradiation of a near-infrared (NIR) laser. Herein, PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 aggregates were exposed to a 808 nm NIR laser with a power of 1.0 W cm−2 at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a, both PBI radical anions from PBI-[GY]2 (left) and PBI-[GD]2 (right) could convert NIR light to heat effectively. The temperature elevation was enhanced when the concentration was increased for both PBI derivatives; however, the photothermal conversion efficiency of PBI-[GD]2 radical anions was much higher than that of PBI-[GY]2 radical anions as shown in Table 1 (for the method to calculate η, see the ESI,† Fig. S4). For instance, the temperature of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 solutions with a concentration of 10 mM was improved by 27.7 and 34.1 °C in 15 min, respectively. In contrast, the temperature of the PBS buffer solution as a control only increased by less than 2 °C under the same conditions. The photothermal conversion efficiency of PBI-[GY]2 radical anions was 49.1% and for PBI-[GD]2 it reached 59.5%, which can be explained by the higher yield of radical anions after the reduction of PBI-[GD]2 compared with that of PBI-[GY]2. The inserted photos show the gel formation of PBI-[GY]2 only when the concentration was above 10 mM due to the contribution of tyrosine forming a long arrangement of hydrogen bonds.

The reusability and stability of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 solutions were crucial for the application in photothermal conversion. Fig. 3b shows 6 cycles of temperature evolution of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 solutions after reduction under NIR laser irradiation. It was observed that the temperature evolution of PBI-[GY]2 and PBI-[GD]2 solutions has no obvious change, which demonstrates the good reusability and stability. Meanwhile, the size of the nanostructures of PBI-[GY]2 decreased from the micro- to the nano-scale due to the electrostatic repulsion after the reduction, which broke the long fiber into short ones, whereas that of PBI-[GD]2 retained their original structure and size as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
In conclusion, we demonstrate the use of different peptide sequences to conjugate and organise PBI moieties precisely, which assemble into tunable nanostructures with enhanced yield of radical anions and photothermal conversion efficiency. By changing the end amino acid from tyrosine to aspartic acid, the assembled morphologies show distinct formation of nanofibers and nanospheres, respectively. The stronger electrostatic repulsion of charged PBI-[GD]2 causing dissociation of aggregates provides more radical anions, in contrast, the stronger π-stacking interactions of PBI-[GY]2 are predominant and lead the PBI molecules to remain in ground states. The photothermal conversion experiment demonstrates that more radical anions of PBI-[GD]2 are generated by the irradiation of NIR with much higher efficiency compared with PBI-[GY]2. The tunable self-assembly behaviour and enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency may potentially provide tools to facilitate the design and applications of controllable drug delivery and release and photothermal therapy.
