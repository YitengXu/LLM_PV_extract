    , Accepted 5th August 2015First published on 7th August 2015AbstractNovel light scattering polymer composites with high transmittance and high haze have been developed by using cross-linked copolymer (CM-SMC) microspheres as light scattering fillers. By using these novel light scattering polymer composite materials, compared to the conventional materials, 20% of the illumination energy can be saved when used for LEDs.
The rising global energy demand and the environmental impact of traditional energy resources pose serious challenges to human health, energy security, and environmental protection.1–3 Surprisingly enough, around 25% of the world's power energy consumption is used for lighting, in which a large amount of energy is converted into waste heat. One promising solution to save energy and reduce CO2 emission is the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for lighting and displays.4,5 LEDs directly convert electricity into light emission by injecting electrons and holes from electrodes into a p–n junction to combine with photons.4 The colour of the light emitted can be tuned by changing the band gap energy of the materials forming the p–n junction.5 This lighting technology currently receives intensive research and development focus because of its high energy conversion efficiency, ease with which full color tuning can be achieved, good environmental adoptability, long lifetime, and virtually no waste heat or pollution. As the press release for the Nobel Prize of Physics in 2014 says: “Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century; the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps”.6 However, currently available LED lamps emit extremely high luminance with a point light source, which produces an uncomfortable glare to human eyes. Therefore, light-scattering materials are needed to convert the point light source to a surface light source for LED lighting and displays.7,8 Traditionally, silicone resin, polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylate, or certain inorganic particles have been used as the scattering fillers.9–11 Without exception the use of conventional light scattering fillers increases the haze of transparent polymers but also compromises transmittance, and hence significantly reduces the emitted light and energy saving for LED lighting and displays (Fig. S1†). Therefore, it is highly desirable to identify alternative light scattering materials that are readily available, cost effective, and can simultaneously enhance the haze and transmittance of transparent polymers for LED lighting and displays. However, there is no such light-scattering filler reported in the literature. In this study, we developed a new class of cross-linked α-methyl styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer (CM-SMC) microspheres with a narrow particle size distribution (Fig. 1, Experimental section (see the ESI†)) as the scattering fillers for modifying the transparent polycarbonate (PC). Despite the challenge to synthesize monodispersed polymer microspheres with a controllable particle size,12 Yang and co-workers have reported an elegant self-stable precipitation polymerization method for preparing polymer microspheres of controllable sizes.13–15 Building on our previous work,13–16 we have successfully synthesized in this study, crosslinked microspheres of α-methyl styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers with various diameters of 400, 800 and 1200 nm (designated as: 400CM-SMC, 800CM-SMC, and 1200CM-SMC, respectively). Fig. 1B shows the SEM images for 400CM-SMC, 800CM-SMC and 1200CM-SMC while detailed descriptions of their syntheses can be found in the Experimental section. For comparison, non-crosslinked microspheres of the α-methyl styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer (NCM-SMC) were also prepared according to the same procedure described above, but without the addition of DVB. Fig. 1C shows an SEM image for 800 nm non-crosslinked microspheres. To form the microspheres of a controlled size, we performed a stabilizer-free precipitation polymerization starting with a homogeneous reaction mixture at the initial stage of the polymerization process. As the copolymerization of AMS and MAH took place in the solution for a certain period of time to form polymer chains of a critical length, they precipitated out from the solution as tiny nuclei and grew into particles of a desirable size via the deposition of polymer chains formed in the solution phase to the particle surface. The size of the CM-SMC microspheres thus formed could be tuned by adjusting monomer concentration and polymerization time, which was found to increase with the increasing monomer concentration and polymerization time. In a typical experiment, maleic anhydride (MAH, 83.40 g) and α-methyl styrene (AMS, 100.35 g) monomers, divinylbenzene (DVB, 25.50 g) crosslinking reagent, and AIBN (0.4935 g) initiator were dissolved in 589.50 g of N2-purged (for 20 min) in solvent acetate in a 1000 mL flask placed in an oil bath at 70 °C. After polymerization for 6 h without agitation, crosslinked microspheres were obtained by centrifugation, followed by thoroughly washing with methanol to remove the monomer and initiator residues prior to vacuum drying (20 Torr) at 50 °C overnight.

(E) Transmittance of pure PC and PC composites with 0.05 wt% CM-SMC microspheres of different sizes. 

Fig. 1D and E show the haze and transmittance of PC before and after blending with 0.05 wt% CM-SMC microspheres of different sizes. Surprisingly, it was found that the haze and transmittance of PC increased simultaneously by blending with the CM-SMC microspheres, which is in stark contrast to Fig. S1† that shows about 50% loss in transmittance (equivalent to ca. 50% energy loss; Fig. S1(B)†) by using the conventional DC light-scattering filler. The haze of PC increased monotonously with increasing the microsphere size (Fig. 1D) while the transmittance of PC showed a size-dependent enhancement (Fig. 1E); significantly increased transmittance over the entire visible wavelengths upon the addition of 400CM-SMC or 800CM-SMC microspheres, but a marginally increased transmittance for 1200CM-SMC. As can be seen in Fig. 1D and E, the PC composite with 800CM-SMC showed the highest transmittance and a reasonably high haze among all the samples investigated in this study, though its haze reached only to a moderate level (ca. 40%) and could be increased up to 96% by incorporating a small amount of conventional light scattering fillers (e.g., ca. 0.3 wt% DC) with high transmittance and additional cost advantages (Table S3†). Thus, we will focus on the PC composite with 800CM-SMC for the subsequent study to gain a better fundamental understanding of the filler-induced simultaneous increase in haze and transmittance, a phenomenon which has not been observed in any composites and is not allowed by existing theories.
In addition to the influence of the CM-SMC microsphere size described above, we further investigated the possible effect of the 800CM-SMC content on haze and transmittance of the PC composites. As can be seen in Table 1, both transmittance and haze for all of the PC composites with different amounts of 800CM-SMC fillers covered by this study are higher than those of the pure PC starting material. The observed increase in haze, more than 40% with increasing the CM-SMC content up to 2.00% can be attributed to the scattering induced by the addition of CM-SMC microspheres, as is the case for the conventional scattering fillers.17 As mentioned earlier, however, it is completely out of our expectation to see the transmittance increased from 85.43% for the pure PC up to 90.16% for the PC composite containing 1.00 wt% 800CM-SMC fillers (Table 1). Hence, the origins of the abnormal transmittance increase are of great interest for further study.

As shown in Fig. 2A, the use of conventional light-scattering fillers (e.g., DC) could significantly increase the reflectance of PC. In contrast, the addition of 800CM-SMC into the PC reduced its reflectance. The reflectance of the PC composite was continuously reduced with increasing the CM-SMC content, especially over the wavelength from 400 to 500 nm (Fig. 2A). Given that the addition of a low content of CM-SMC (≤2.00 wt%) would not cause an obvious change in the optical absorption of PC (cf. Fig. 3C), the observed reflectance drop could be responsible for the transmittance increase in the PC and CM-SMC composites as the total intensity of the transmitting beam and reflecting beam should be a constant if the optical absorption and the incident light intensity are kept un-changed. Clearly, therefore, one of the important questions that need to be addressed is why the addition of 800CM-SMC reduced the reflectance of PC, as opposed to the conventional filler (Fig. 2A). A literature survey shows that the most effective way to reduce the reflectance is to form the “moth eye” structure on a polymer surface.18–21 In 1962, Bernhard and Miller22 discovered that there are many sub-micron structures on the moth eyes to reduce the reflectance for hiding from predators. These sub-micron structures are composed of protuberances with about 200 nm in height (h), and the pitch of the protuberances is about 300 nm. Later, it was found that the pitch must be narrower than the wavelength (λ) of light for reducing the reflectance, which then depends also on the ratio of h and λ with the minimum reflectance at h/λ ≈ 0.4. Based on these considerations, Mundo and co-workers have recently developed a transparent polymer surface with the bio-inspired “moth eye” sub-microstructures to significantly reduce its surface reflectance from 11% to 0.5%.23 These studies prompted us to examine the presence of possible “moth eye” sub-microstructures on the surface of our PC and CM-SMC composites.

(B) The fluorescence spectra of 800CM-SMC and 800NCM-SMC at λex = 410 nm. (C) The optical absorbance of pure PC and PC composites. 

Fig. 2B–D show the SEM and AFM images of the surface of a PC composite with 1.00 wt% 800CM-SMC microspheres. It can be seen that microspheres are distributed over the composite surface to form a concave–convex structure at the micron scale. The AFM section analysis reveals that the width of the bottom of the groove is approximately 400 nm (Fig. 2D), which is smaller than the wavelength of visible light to satisfy the basic conditions for generating the “moth eye” effect. Fig. 2D also shows that the height of the protuberance (h) is about 170 nm, and hence the most obvious drop of reflectance should be at 425 nm where h/λ ≈ 0.4.22 Indeed, our experimental results given in Fig. 2A show the most obvious reflectance drop at about 425 nm. Therefore, the observed reflectance reduction for our PC and CM-SMC composites is indeed due to the “moth eye” effect.22–24 For the PC and CM-SMC composites, therefore, the reflectance reduction seems to be responsible for the observed transmittance increase, along with the increase in haze. However, Fig. 3A shows that the transmittance increase does not match the reduction in reflectance, particularly over 400–450 nm. More specifically, the transmittance increase is far less than the reflectance reduction at wavelengths of 400–450 nm while the transmittance increase is more than the reflectance reduction over 500–800 nm. Clearly, therefore, an unknown yet decisive factor, in addition to the reflectance reduction associated with the “moth eye” effect, is also responsible for the observed transmittance increase.
To further investigate the underlying principle for the observed transmittance increase, we performed a test to see if CM-SMC microspheres are fluorescent. Fig. 3B is the fluorescence spectra (λex = 410 nm) of the crosslinked 800CM-SMC and its non-crosslinked counterpart (i.e., 800NCM-SMC), showing fluorescence emissions with two peaks centered at 520 and 620 nm for both the samples with the crosslinked one being the stronger fluorescent chromophore. Due to the fluorescent nature of the CM-SMC, the net light loss over 400–450 nm shown in Fig. 3A is, most likely, because the PC and 800CM-SMC composites absorbed more light at low wavelengths, as confirmed by Fig. 3C, and emitted more light at high wavelengths over 500 nm than the pure PC. Therefore, it is the combination of the reflectance reduction induced by the “moth eye” effect and the fluorescent nature of the CM-SMC microspheres that makes the PC and CM-CMS composites to show a higher transmittance than that of pure PC to visible light (cf. Fig. 1E).
Finally, how can the CM-SMC and NCM-SMC microspheres be fluorescent? In fact, Yan and co-workers have previously found that fluorescent multiblock polymers could be synthesized from nonfluorescent monomers through the π–π interaction between the phenyl units and the neighbouring carbonyl units.25 In view of the similarity in the molecular structures of our NCM-SMC (Fig. 1A) and polymers studied by Yan et al. (Fig. S2†), we believe that the observed photoluminescence could also arise from the π–π interaction between the phenyl units and the neighbouring carbonyl units in both the CM-SMC and NCM-SMC microspheres. The formation of cross-linked microspheres could bring the phenyl moieties in the α-methyl styrene units more closely towards the carbonyl groups in the maleic anhydride units within the CM-SMC copolymer to enhance the π–π interaction,25–27 and hence the enhanced fluorescence emission for the CM-SMC with respect to its NCM-SMC counterpart (Fig. 3B).
In summary, we have developed the first polymer composites with a higher haze and a higher transmittance than those of the pure polymer matrix by blending crosslinked microspheres of the α-methyl styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer (CM-SMC) with the pure transparent polycarbonate (PC). Unlike conventional light-scattering fillers (e.g., silicone resin, polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylate, or certain inorganic particles) that could increase the haze at the cost of transmittance, the CM-SMC microspheres can increase the haze and transmittance simultaneously. The increase in transmittance by the addition of CM-SMC microspheres into PC was demonstrated to result from the reflectance reduction induced by the “moth eye” effect, in conjunction with the fluorescent nature of the CM-CMS microspheres this leads to absorption of the reduced reflecting light at low wavelengths and emits more light at high wavelengths over 500 nm than the pure PC. Therefore, the newly-developed CM-SMC microspheres could be ideal light-scattering fillers for polymer composites to achieve both high haze and high transmittance for LED lighting and displays, which could significantly save energy and cost (Fig. S3 and 4 and Table S1–3†). The methodology developed in this study can also be applied to the development of many other high-performance polymer composites for various optoelectronic applications, ranging from solar cells to optical sensors, for further enhancing the environmental and energy impact.
