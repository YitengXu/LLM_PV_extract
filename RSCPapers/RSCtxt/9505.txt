    , Accepted 13th May 2015First published on 13th May 2015AbstractSodium-ion batteries offer a potential alternative or complementary system to lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in many applications. For this purpose, layered O3-type NaCrO2 for use as a cathode material in sodium-ion batteries was synthesized via an emulsion-drying method. The produced NaCrO2 was modified using pitch as a carbon source and the products were tested in half and full cells using a NaPF6-based non-aqueous electrolyte solution. The carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode material exhibits excellent capacity retention with superior rate capability up to a rate of 150 C (99 mA h (g oxide)−1), which corresponds to full discharge during 27 s. The surface conducting carbon layer plays a critically important role in the excellent performance of this cathode material. We confirmed the reaction process with sodium using X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Thermal analysis using time-resolved X-ray diffraction also demonstrated the structural stability of carbon-coated Na0.5CrO2. Due to the excellent performance of the cathode material described herein, this study has the potential to promote the accelerated development of sodium-ion batteries for a large number of applications.

Broader context
The impressive technological success of Li-ion batteries has opened the door to the use of other active metal elements in rechargeable batteries. It is highly important to develop energy storage devices based on the most abundant elements. Consequently, R&D of rechargeable sodium batteries has become highly important in recent years and is currently attracting the most prominent research groups working in electrochemical and materials science. Recent discoveries of promising sodium intercalation electrode materials indicate that sodium-ion batteries may be able to compete with lithium-ion batteries, especially in applications of load-levelling and large-scale energy storage. While lithium resources are limited and the production of Li compounds is relatively expensive, sodium is one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust. In this paper, we report on the successful synthesis of a layered O3-type carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode material for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. This carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode material exhibits excellent capacity retention with superior rate capability up to a rate of 150 C (full discharge during 27 s). Thermal analysis using time-resolved X-ray diffraction demonstrated impressive structural stability of carbon-coated de-sodiated Na0.5CrO2 electrodes. This work is going to promote the development of high-rate rechargeable sodium-ion batteries with very good safety features.

Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) have attracted a great deal of attention as an alternative source of energy and power to fossil fuels (in internal combustion engines) for ground-based transportation, due to their high energy density and good cyclability at moderate rates.1–3 By virtue of these advantages, as the market for electric vehicles (EVs), portable devices and other devices using LIBs expands, the demand for large-scale energy storage devices is also gradually increasing. However, the percentage by mass of lithium in the earth's crust is only 0.006%.4 Indeed, the cost of lithium and lithium compounds may increase and Li sources may become depleted when the use of EVs expands in the near future, which may cause a monopoly of lithium resources. Also, we anticipate an increasing demand for large energy storage devices, in order to use more and more sustainable energy (e.g. from solar and wind sources). LIBs will not be able to meet the demand for load-leveling applications. For these reasons, many research groups throughout the world are trying to address this problem by developing new sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as substitute or complementary systems to LIBs. Sodium, which is an abundant element (its Clarke's number is 2.644), and sodium compounds offer an alternative to expensive and less abundant lithium and Li compounds in batteries, due to the low redox potential of sodium and the ability of sodiated transition metal oxides to act as effective sodium intercalation electrode materials.5,6 Competitive cost, cyclability, and rate capability are necessary for the use of SIBs in large-scale energy storage systems.6 Hence, there is a strong incentive to explore and develop effective and novel SIB systems.
Recently, several groups have investigated layer-structured sodium intercalation compounds for applications in low-cost and large-scale energy storage.7–22 In 1982, Hagenmuller et al.23 confirmed the feasibility of using NaCrO2 as a Na+ extraction/insertion electrode. Recently, Komaba et al.7 revisited O3-type layer-structured NaCrO2, in which Na ions could be inserted into/extracted from the host structure due to its larger inter-slab distance compared to LiCrO2 material, which is electrochemically inactive in Li-based electrolyte solutions.24 Furthermore, certain remarkable advantages of NaCrO2 have been reported, including a high theoretical capacity of about 250 mA h g−1, although its practical reversible capacity is approximately 110 mA h g−1 (Na1−xCrO2, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5), of which the voltage profile flattens at 3 V. Dahn et al.8 also reported that de-sodiated Na0.5CrO2 exhibits good thermal stability in Na-based non-aqueous electrolytes. A citric acid-assisted carbon coating also provided a slight improvement in the cycling stability of NaCrO2 electrodes but was not successful in achieving high rate capability.9 Summarizing these reports, we can simply state that the NaCrO2 electrodes that were described delivered an initial discharge capacity of about 100–110 mA h g−1, supported by Cr3+/4+ redox activity via an O3 to P3 phase transition, and exhibited fast capacity fading (ca. 80% at the 50th cycle) and a disappointing rate capability. Although the thermal stability reported was relatively good, the overall impression from all the previous work on NaCrO2 was not very encouraging.
Despite this, we decided to attempt to improve this cathode material by applying new synthetic routes. Our approach led to NaCrO2 cathodes with excellent capacity retention, impressive rate capability and feasibility in full cells, which were suitable for advanced energy storage and conversion. In order to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, we synthesized NaCrO2via a water-in-oil type emulsion-drying method, which can intermix cations homogeneously at the atomic level, and then subsequently modified the surfaces of the products using pitch (Scheme 1). This pioneering work led to NaCrO2 cathodes of unprecedentedly high performance, which was achieved by optimizing the synthetic methods, including modification of the surface with electrically conductive carbon, which enabled a great increase in electrical conductivity to 0.47 S cm−1 from 8 × 10−5 S cm−1 for bare NaCrO2. Before the work described in this paper, nobody had attempted to synthesize NaCrO2 by methods other than the solid-state approach or had suggested the possibility of demonstrating full sodium-ion batteries based on NaCrO2 cathodes coupled with hard carbon anodes (hereafter referred to as C-NaCrO2). Our work allows us to state with a high degree of confidence that the carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode is eminently suitable for use in high-rate Na-ion batteries for energy storage applications.

Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, preparation of the emulsion may produce oily particles in water. Although an emulsion is easily separated into water and oil phases, the addition of an emulsifying agent prevents this separation and stabilizes the emulsion. Heating the oily precipitates at 400 °C in air almost completely removes the organic components contained in the emulsion, resulting in solid powders that exhibit low crystallinity, although the product is crystallized in an O3-type layer structure (Fig. S1, ESI†). The crystallinity improves with increasing calcination temperature in an Ar atmosphere. As a result, highly crystalline NaCrO2, which has an olive-green color (inset of Fig. 1a), is produced by calcination at 900 °C for 10 h in Ar (Fig. 1a). Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was carried out assuming a rhombohedral Rm space group and excluding the possibility of site exchange between Na+ and Cr3+ due to the great difference in their ionic radii. The observed pattern is almost identical to the simulated pattern, which indicates that the material was well synthesized (Fig. 1a) with a Rwp value of 11.1%. The TEM image illustrates that the emulsion-derived NaCrO2 exhibits hexagonal plate-like particles with smoothly developed edges (Fig. 1b).

The as-synthesized NaCrO2 heated with pitch in Ar, which contained approximately 3.4 wt% carbon residue as analysed by a CHN analyser, was also a highly crystalline black product (Fig. 1c). There were no significant changes in the particle morphology of NaCrO2 before and after coating with carbon, except a change in colour (Fig. S2, ESI†). Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern indicates that the carbon coating did not alter the crystal structure as there were no changes in peak intensity and impurities, as further confirmed by the lattice parameter results (Table S1, ESI†). A further increase in the carbon content did not reduce the peak intensity (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the resulting lattice parameters remained constant for all the samples (Table S1, ESI†). The TEM image clearly shows the presence of a foreign layer, carbon, on the surface of NaCrO2 (Fig. 1d). Increasing the carbon content resulted in gradual growth of the carbon layers to approximately 30 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The Raman spectrum of this material provides further evidence that carbon layers reside on the surface of the NaCrO2 particles (Fig. 2a). Only the background signal is observed for bare NaCrO2 due to the absence of carbon on the compound. In contrast, the D-band and G-band, which give clear evidence of carbon, appear at 1350 and 1600 cm−1, respectively, for C-NaCrO2. In particular, the intense G-band peak relative to the broad D-band means that the carbon layer is quite crystalline due to the carbonization of pitch in the Ar atmosphere. As a result, the presence of a crystalline carbon coating dramatically increased the electrical conductivity of NaCrO2, although the carbon content was low (1.4 wt%) (4.4 × 10−3 S cm−1), then the conductivity increased almost linearly to 4.7 × 10−1 S cm−1 (at 14.6 wt%) with increasing carbon content (Fig. 2b).

A serious problem with sodiated cathode materials is the immediate absorption of water, which occurs within 2 h after exposure to ambient air. This leads to the formation of NaOH and Na2CO3 on the surface of bare NaCrO2 (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†), as evidenced by the increase in weight measured by TGA (Fig. 2c) and ToF-SIMS (Fig. S4b, ESI†). As sodium diffuses to the surface, electrochemically inactive areas are formed inside the particles. Even more seriously, the formed NaOH and Na2CO3 are electrical insulators; this, in turn, increases the resistance of the active mass. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the carbon coating layer suppressed the uptake of moisture due to its hydrophobic characteristics. Therefore, the crystal structure did not change even after exposure to air for 48 h, whereas bare NaCrO2 underwent phase separation into Na-deficient NaxCrO2 and NaOH (Fig. S4a, ESI†) after even a brief exposure to air.
The electrochemical performances of bare and C-NaCrO2 were measured by applying a constant charge–discharge rate of 20 mA g−1 in the voltage range from 2.0 to 3.6 V at 25 °C. The first charge–discharge curves of bare and C-NaCrO2 (3.4 wt%) are identical to each other except for their capacities, which are 112 mA h g−1 and 121 mA h g−1, respectively, on discharge (Fig. 3a). It is obvious that the carbon coating enabled the delivery of more capacity above 3.07 V on charging, which seems to be related to the phase transformation from an O3 to a P3 layer structure, as mentioned below, and was reversible upon discharge. Despite the severe capacity fading observed for bare NaCrO2, C-NaCrO2 electrodes displayed excellent cycling performance, with capacity retention above 96% after the 50th cycle for carbon-coated electrodes with carbon contents of 1.4–14.2 wt%. In particular, the 3.4 wt% C-NaCrO2 electrode, which exhibited the best performance among the electrodes (Fig. 3b), displayed a surprising capacity retention upon cycling of approximately 90% at the 300th cycle (Fig. 3c and d) and showed a coulombic efficiency approaching 100%, apart from in the first cycle. The rate performance results for C-NaCrO2 electrodes were surprising (Fig. 3e and f). The delivered capacity was only 3 mA h g−1 for bare NaCrO2 at a rate of 50 C. In contrast, 3.4 and 7.3 wt% C-NaCrO2 electrodes delivered unexpectedly high capacities (106 mA h g−1) at a rate of 50 C (5.5 A g−1) and retained 87% of the capacity obtained at a rate of 0.5 C (55 mA g−1). The superior rate capacity was further evidenced up to a rate of 150 C (16.5 A g−1), which corresponds to a 27 s discharge (Fig. 3f), in which the delivered capacity (99 mA h g−1) is solely associated with the Na+ insertion reaction as is obvious from the flat discharge curve. The original capacity (119 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.5 C) was easily recovered after any operation at high rates. It is most likely that this excellent rate property was due to the presence of crystalline carbon layers, which assists the immediate migration of electrons so that sodium ions can be inserted or extracted at ultrafast rates. The residual carbon content was also equalized for both bare and C-NaCrO2 to observe the effect of the carbon coating (Fig. S6, ESI†). However, the resulting electrochemical performance was disappointing for bare NaCrO2. A previous report by Ding et al.9 suggests that a citric acid-derived carbon coating improves the cycling stability. In our results, the carbon coating contributes not only to the cycling performance, but also to a very high rate performance, which has not been reported previously. In order to increase the stability of the cells, we tested solutions containing FEC as an important active additive that improves passivation of electrodes. We proved that the excellent performance of this cathode material is intrinsic and does not relate to the solution used. Its excellent rate capability was also demonstrated in FEC-free solutions (Fig. S7, ESI†).

The structures of the electrode were investigated using ex situ XRD in order to clarify the mechanism of the charge and discharge processes. Fig. 4a shows the voltage profile of the first cycle for C-NaCrO2 (3.4 wt%) plotted as a function of the Na+ content δ in Na1−δCrO2. As anticipated, a phase transition from O3 to other phases is evident from the data. The original hexagonal O3 phase (NaCrO2; S.G. = Rm, JCPDS card #88-0720) was retained at δ = 0.17 in Na1−δCrO2 (Fig. 4b), after which a monoclinic O3 phase (Na0.74CrO2; S.G. = C2/m, JCPDS card #38-1204) appeared at δ = 0.42 in Na1−δCrO2, accompanied by the occurrence of new 2θ peaks at 32.7°, 35.7°, 36.7° and overlapped 42.1°. Above δ = 0.33 in Na1−δCrO2, a newly formed monoclinic P3 phase (Na0.52CrO2; S.G. = R3m, JCPDS card #38-1205) was dominant until the end of charging. The difference in capacity of about 10 mA h g−1 above 3.07 V relates to the region of the phase transformation from monoclinic O3 to monoclinic P3. It seems that this phase transformation took place more readily for carbon-coated NaCrO2, probably due to its high electrical conductivity, so that higher capacity can be delivered. This series of phase transitions occurs based on the gliding mechanism of a transition metal layer slab, which was suggested by Delmas et al.25 Chemical diffusion of Na+ at the end of charging for Na0.5CrO2 with a monoclinic P3 structure (∼10−9 S cm−1) was much faster than that for Na0.92CrO2 with a hexagonal O3 structure (∼10−13 S cm−1), which is due to the large interlayer distance. From these results, we confirmed that the phase transition progresses in the sequence hexagonal O3 → monoclinic O3 → monoclinic P3 on charging and vice versa on discharging, which coincides with prior results in the literature.10,20,26

(b) Ex situ XRD patterns obtained during charging and discharging. The impurity peaks α and β are graphite and Al foil, respectively. Cr K-edge XANES spectra obtained during (c) charging and (d) discharging. 
Cr K-edge XANES was employed to monitor the change in oxidation states during charging and discharging. In the charge process (Fig. 4c), the white-line peak shows a positive shift to higher energy as the extent of de-sodiation increases. Moreover, the pre-edge peak at 5990 eV gradually broadens during de-sodiation and finally splits into two broad peaks (5990 eV and 5992 eV) at the end of charging, δ = 0.51 in Na1−δCrO2. This is due to the 1s to 3d transition characteristics of the oxidation of Cr. Therefore, the observed increase in the pre-edge peak at 5992 eV indicates the oxidation of Cr, presumably to Cr4+. A further increase in the peak at 5992 eV indicates the formation of Cr6+. However, this behaviour was not observed in the present study. During discharging, the chemical shift returns toward lower energy with a relative decrease in the pre-edge peak (Fig. 4d), which indicates that oxidized Cr was reduced to Cr3+. This variation in oxidation state was highly reversible and the unit cell parameters also recovered to nearly the same value as in pristine carbon-coated NaCrO2. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Cr3+/4+ redox couple was reversibly available, as NaCrO2 delivered a reversible capacity of approximately 121 mA h g−1 with excellent cyclability (90% for 300 cycles, Fig. 3c and d).
The structural stabilities of both bare and C-NaCrO2 electrodes were examined by XRD after extensive cycling tests (Fig. 5). For bare NaCrO2, the resulting XRD pattern shows a broadening of the diffraction peaks due to the coexistence of hexagonal O3 NaCrO2 with a monoclinic O3 phase, which is the intermediate product appearing in the range δ = 0.25–0.42 in Na1−δCrO2 (Fig. 4b). The differentiation curves suggest gradual capacity fading in the voltage plateau at 2.94–2.99 V upon discharging, in particular, where the region with the monoclinic O3 structure is dominant (Fig. S5, ESI†). Hence, the poor cycling performance can be understood (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the phase recovery to hexagonal O3 seemed to occur smoothly, so that the original hexagonal O3 structure was retained up to the 300th cycle for C-NaCrO2. It is interesting that the only difference between the two types of electrodes is the presence of a carbon coating layer. We assume that the series of phase transformations may induce stress in the oxide lattice because large Na+ ions (1.02 Å) diffuse into and out of the structure. Nevertheless, the highly electrically conductive crystalline carbon layer on NaxCrO2 particles enables facile migration of Na+ ions in the structure, which is confirmed by complete recovery of the original structure of the active mass even after 300 cycles. This is well demonstrated by the excellent capacity retention of this cathode material (90% after 300 cycles, Fig. 3c and d). The highly conductive surface of the particles facilitates Na+ extraction and insertion, which promotes fast electron transfer to the Cr3+/4+ redox couple.

Full sodium-ion cells using NaCrO2 as cathode material and hard carbon as anode material were fabricated (pouch cell configuration), as illustrated in Fig. 6a. After the cell formation process, the initial charge and discharge profiles of cells containing bare and C-NaCrO2 were compared in the voltage range of 1.8–3.4 V (Fig. 6b). The initial capacities were approximately 97 and 102 mA h g−1 for bare and C-NaCrO2 cathodes, respectively. The cycling performance and rate capability of cells with bare NaCrO2 cathodes were disappointing (70% at the 100th cycle). In contrast, the capacity retention of cells with C-NaCrO2 cathodes was approximately 90% after 300 cycles, displaying a coulombic efficiency approaching 100% (Fig. 6c). Also, a superior rate capability was observed even at a rate of 100 C (10 A g−1) for full cells containing C-NaCrO2 cathodes (Fig. 6d and Fig. S8, ESI†). We compared the electrochemical properties of several O3- and P2-type layered cathode materials to confirm the novelty of the C-NaCrO2 cathodes developed in the present work (Table S2, ESI†). This comparison demonstrates the competitiveness of the C-NaCrO2 material in terms of capacity retention during prolonged cycling and high rate capability, which have not been achieved previously in rechargeable Na battery systems. These data indicate that the Cr3+/4+ redox reaction can be successfully utilized leading to high performance in O3-type layer compounds when coated by appropriate electrically conductive carbon layers.

Thermal stability is another important parameter that should be investigated before these electrode materials are considered for use in practical power sources. A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and in situ high-temperature XRD (HT-XRD) provided important information on the thermal behaviour of these cathode materials. TGA and HT-XRD studies help with better interpretation of the more complicated differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements. For thermal studies, cathodes comprising coated and bare NaCrO2 were electrochemically de-sodiated to form Na0.5CrO2. The observed weight loss in TGA measurements, which is mainly ascribed to evolution of oxygen from the parent oxide, varied among the samples (Fig. 7c). Bare Na0.5CrO2 exhibited progressive weight loss comprising three steps up to 400 °C: a first step from 25 °C to 140 °C (0.9 wt% loss), a second step from 140 °C to 280 °C with substantial weight loss (3.9 wt%), and a third step from 280 °C to 400 °C (3.3 wt%). From HT-XRD measurements it is clear that the distorted monoclinic P3 phase Na0.5CrO2 was stable up to 140 °C, which relates to the first step with a weight loss of 0.9 wt% (Fig. 7a and c). As oxygen was further evolved from the parent structure up to 280 °C, the monoclinic P3 phase was relaxed into a hexagonal P3 phase at 150 °C, which accounts for the (201)Mon. and (11-2)Mon. peaks at 45° (2θ) merging into the (105)Hex. peak in the second step. The hexagonal P3 phase was retained as a single phase up to 280 °C. Above this temperature, a new P3 phase with a short interlayer distance appeared and was found to be P3 CrO2.8 The CrO2 phase developed further as the temperature was increased even more. Interestingly, a hexagonal O3 NaCrO2 phase also appeared as P3 CrO2 appeared above 290 °C for bare NaxCrO2 material. As a result, heating de-sodiated Na0.5CrO2 induced the evolution of oxygen from the oxide lattice and this simultaneously resulted in the phase segregation of Na0.5CrO2 and CrO2.

In contrast, the variation in weight for C-Na0.5CrO2 (Fig. 7c) was significantly lower and took place in three steps: a first step from 25 °C to 170 °C (0.4 wt% loss), a second step from 170 °C to 320 °C with gradual weight loss (1.5 wt%), and a third step from 320 °C to 400 °C (1.0 wt%). The phase transition from monoclinic P3 to hexagonal P3 was delayed to 170 °C, above which the hexagonal phase was predominantly present in the temperature range of 170–320 °C (Fig. 7b and c). Above 320 °C, the appearance of P3 CrO2 can be seen, whereas that of O3 hexagonal NaCrO2 is not observed in the XRD pattern up to 400 °C. However, the diffraction intensity is low and broad for P3 CrO2 formed by the thermal treatment of C-Na0.5CrO2 (Fig. 7b) compared to the behaviour of the bare cathode material. On comparing the evolution of oxygen for both samples, we found that C-Na0.5CrO2 exhibited a weight loss of only 2.9 wt% up to 400 °C, which is lower than that of bare Na0.5CrO2 (8.1 wt%). The lower evolution of oxygen from the crystal structure is likely to retard phase segregation. Another interesting feature is that de-sodiated Na0.5CrO2 does not produce a cubic spinel phase such as that formed by de-lithiated transition metal oxides27 even after release of oxygen from the parent oxide.
Based on these experimental results, the DSC behaviour of these electrodes can be understood (Fig. 7d). For the bare sample, the small evolution of heat in the temperature range of 150–270 °C is due to the phase transition from the monoclinic P3 to the hexagonal P3 phase. As oxygen was further evolved from the crystal structure, the hexagonal P3 phase underwent phase segregation, with Na-rich Na0.5CrO2 and Na-deficient CrO2 accompanying the exothermic reaction in the temperature range of 270–360 °C. For C-Na0.5CrO2, phase transformation took place over a wide temperature range of 170–320 °C. In addition, the observed exothermic heat produced from the phase separation process was also greatly reduced because of the slow evolution of oxygen from the crystal structure. The difference in oxygen content could be related to the amount of heat generated during the exothermic reaction. Even after the exothermic reaction was complete, the weight loss was smaller for C-Na0.5CrO2 material up to 400 °C. This is attributed to the presence of the carbon coating layer on the surface of Na0.5CrO2 particles, which prevents thermal damage to the crystal structure. Therefore, it is evident that the carbon coating retards the exothermic decomposition reaction at higher temperatures with less generation of heat (Scheme 2).

Conclusion
Layered O3-type NaCrO2 was successfully synthesized by an emulsion-drying method, which seems to be a better synthetic route than previously reported syntheses of such materials. The surfaces of NaCrO2 particles were modified by carbon to endow them with high electrical conductivity of approximately 10−1 S cm−1. C-NaCrO2 cathodes exhibited excellent cyclability and ultrafast rate capability up to a rate of 150 C. It is clear that their high electrical conductivity successfully promotes the reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions, accompanied by a facile complementary redox reaction of the Cr4+/Cr3+ couple. Excellent electrochemical performance of these cathodes was demonstrated in both half and full sodium-ion cells. In addition, the generation of heat from de-sodiated C-NaxCrO2 is relatively small due to the suppression of the evolution of oxygen during the exothermic reaction as a result of the presence of the carbon coating layer. All these findings demonstrate the potential importance of C-NaCrO2 cathodes in advanced sodium-ion batteries for many applications, including large-scale energy storage devices.
Experimental
NaCrO2 powders were synthesized by an emulsion-drying method (Scheme 1). The starting materials used for the synthesis of NaCrO2 were sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and chromium nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O) using kerosene as oil solution and Tween #85 as surfactant. Preparation of the emulsion and the emulsion-drying process have been described in our prior work.28,29 The obtained powders were initially annealed at 400 °C for 4 h in air and then calcined at 900 °C for 10 h in an Ar atmosphere. The produced NaCrO2 powders were rapidly moved into an Ar-filled glove box to avoid contamination with moisture, which causes the formation of NaOH on the surface of NaCrO2. As-synthesized NaCrO2 powders were mixed with an appropriate amount of pitch (1–20 wt% versus NaCrO2) as a carbon source to produce C-NaCrO2 by heating at 750 °C for 5 hours in an Ar atmosphere.
Phase identification of the calcined products was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rint-2000, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation. XRD data were obtained with a step size of 0.03° and a count time of 3 s. The presence of carbon was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-3010, JEOL) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw InVia Raman microscope). DC electrical conductivity was measured by a direct volt-ampere method (CMT-SR1000, AIT), in which disc samples were contacted with a four-point probe. An elemental analyzer (EA110, CE Instruments, Italy) was employed to determine the amount of carbon in the final products. XAS measurements were performed on the 1D beamline at the 2.5 GeV Pohang Light Source (ring current of 120–160 mA), which is a third-generation synchrotron radiation source. Cr K-edge XAS data were obtained in total electron yield mode and the sample current was recorded. Ion chamber detectors filled with high-purity N2 were used to record X-ray absorption spectra. Electrochemically de-lithiated powders were subjected to TGA (loaded sample amount: 10 mg, DTG-60, Shimadzu, Japan). The thermal properties were analyzed up to 400 °C by time-resolved XRD (TR-XRD, R-AXIS IV++, Rigaku). The obtained powder samples were sealed completely and mounted on the thermal stage of the TR-XRD system. Mo Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.7107 Å, which was converted to the value of the Cu Kα wavelength (1.5418 Å) for convenience, was used in the X-ray diffractometry system at KIST.
For the fabrication of electrodes, synthesized bare NaCrO2 and carbon-coated samples were separately mixed with KS-6 and Super-P (1:1 in weight) as conducting materials and polyvinylidene fluoride (85:7.5:7.5 in weight) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The obtained slurry was coated onto Al foils and roll-pressed. The electrodes were vacuum-dried overnight at 110 °C prior to use. A typical amount of loaded active material was approximately 3.5 mg cm−2. Charge–discharge tests were performed using R2032 type coin cells for the half cell (Na metal anode) and pouch-type full cells (hard carbon anode). Galvanostatic electrochemical charge and discharge tests were carried out in 0.5 M NaPF6 in PC:FEC30 (98:2 v/v mixture) solutions at room temperature. The presence of a small amount of FEC in PC solutions was important for maintaining very good electrode passivation.30

Broader context
The impressive technological success of Li-ion batteries has opened the door to the use of other active metal elements in rechargeable batteries. It is highly important to develop energy storage devices based on the most abundant elements. Consequently, R&D of rechargeable sodium batteries has become highly important in recent years and is currently attracting the most prominent research groups working in electrochemical and materials science. Recent discoveries of promising sodium intercalation electrode materials indicate that sodium-ion batteries may be able to compete with lithium-ion batteries, especially in applications of load-levelling and large-scale energy storage. While lithium resources are limited and the production of Li compounds is relatively expensive, sodium is one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust. In this paper, we report on the successful synthesis of a layered O3-type carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode material for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. This carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode material exhibits excellent capacity retention with superior rate capability up to a rate of 150 C (full discharge during 27 s). Thermal analysis using time-resolved X-ray diffraction demonstrated impressive structural stability of carbon-coated de-sodiated Na0.5CrO2 electrodes. This work is going to promote the development of high-rate rechargeable sodium-ion batteries with very good safety features.
