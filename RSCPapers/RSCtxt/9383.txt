UL-AuNPs, which have gold nanothorns on their surface, enhance light accumulation by acting as light-trapping materials. This is due to the enhanced electric field and light scattering attributed to the nanothorns on the surface of the nanoparticles. UL-AuNPs were incorporated into a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin-film layer of organic thin-film solar cells (OSCs). UV-vis spectra, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, current density versus voltage properties, and the impedance spectra of the fabricated devices were recorded at various concentrations of UL-AuNPs. We found that the efficiency of the OSCs with UL-AuNPs was not only higher than that of a reference cell without nanoparticles but also higher than that of OSCs with spherical AuNPs. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation indicated that the electric field around the UL-AuNPs increased due to the presence of nanothorns.
1. Introduction
Organic thin-film solar cells (OSCs) have been widely explored due to their potential applications in inexpensive and flexible photovoltaic cells based on organic materials.1,2 However, one issue with OSCs is their relatively low efficiency, which is not as high as that of silicon-based solar cells.3 Because organic materials exhibit a relatively high resistance, their photoelectric conversion layers are typically 100–200 nm thick, resulting in low absorption of photons.4,5 An important challenge in the advancement of OSCs is enhancing light absorption in organic layers while maintaining their thickness. Many researchers have tried to improve light absorption in OSCs, for example, by tuning the bandgap of conjugated polymers for a broad range of light absorption by chemical synthesis,6–8 adding an anti-reflection structure on OSCs to reduce light reflection via an imprinting technique,9–12 and using the plasmonic properties of gold or silver nanoparticles as light amplifiers by blending them with OSCs.13–16
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be easily dispersed in water and are stable in a redoxoxidation/reduction environment.17 AuNPs have been widely used in multiple research fields such as in sensors,18–20 solar cells,21–24 and medicine25–27 because of their plasmonic properties. In the field of OSCs, AuNPs are blended with a hole transport layer (HTL) or an active layer, which can improve the efficiency of devices.28,29 Due to an enhanced electric field resulting from localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and light scattering known as Mie scattering, strong light absorption can be obtained in OSCs with AuNPs.13 Therefore, AuNPs are desirable for use as light-trapping materials in OSCs.30
Urchin-like gold nanoparticles (UL-AuNPs) are a type of multi-pod gold nanostructures that possess gold nanothorns on the surface. UL-AuNPs display a wide range of light absorption and scattering properties compared with spherical gold nanoparticles of similar size.31–33 The application of these structures in the fabrication of gold nanostars and spike-shaped gold nanostructures has been studied, and improvement in the efficiency of OSCs was observed.34,35 In this study, we used UL-AuNPs, which were synthesized by a wet chemical process, for the application of OSCs. Our results demonstrate that blending UL-AuNPs with the HTL plays an important role in improving the power conversion efficiency by enhancing the electric field and light scattering of OSCs. Furthermore, to understand the experimental results, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed by assuming the structures of the UL-AuNPs and spherical AuNPs in OSCs. FDTD simulations indicate an increased electric field distribution around gold nanothorns, which correlates well with the experimental results.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Synthesis of UL-AuNPs
UL-AuNPs were synthesized without a stabilizer via a one-pot technique using H2O2 as a reducing agent. 3 mL of 9 M H2O2 (Merck) and 25 μM of AgNO3 (Merck) were added to a test tube containing 3 μL of 0.5 M HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 150 μL of spherical gold nanoseeds (OD = 1, average size = ∼20 nm, Sigma-Aldrich). The yellow HAuCl4 solution transformed into a blue-green solution immediately following the addition of UL-AuNPs. The final concentration of the solution was 0.5 mM.
2.2 Fabrication of OSCs containing UL-AuNPs

Fig. 1 depicts a schematic of the fabricated UL-AuNP-enhanced bulk-heterojunction OSCs. To introduce UL-AuNPs into OSCs, UL-AuNPs were diluted to a preferred concentration in deionized water. Subsequently, the UL-AuNP solution was mixed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios, Heraeus Co.) (1:6 v/v) and blended for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath. PEDOT:PSS, containing UL-AuNPs, was deposited on indium tin oxide substrates (FINE brand, Furuuchi Co. Ltd, 10 Ω cm−2), as an HTL, by spin coating at 1000 rpm for 1 min. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS films was approximately 100 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). The deposited PEDOT:PSS film was annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Sigma-Aldrich) blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Sigma-Aldrich), which were dissolved in dichlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) with a P3HT:PCBM mass ratio of 1:0.8, was coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer as an active layer by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The P3HT:PCBM film thickness was approximately 100 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The deposited films were annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The top aluminum electrode (thickness = ∼150 nm) of OSCs was deposited on the P3HT:PCBM layer using a vacuum evaporation technique. Finally, the fabricated OSCs were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in a vacuum chamber.

2.3 Characterization of the fabricated devices
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PEDOT:PSS and UL-AuNP-loaded PEDOT:PSS films were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (V-650, Jasco). The morphology of the UL-AuNP dispersions on the surface of PEDOT:PSS films was investigated using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (SPM-9600, Shimadzu). Photovoltaic parameters and the impedance spectra of OSCs, with and without UL-AuNPs, were studied following irradiation under a solar simulator (HAL-C100, 100 W compact xenon light source, Asahi Spectra) equipped with a precision source-meter unit (B2901A, Agilent) and a potentiostat (PARSTAT 4000, Princeton Applied Research).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of UL-AuNPs on UV-vis absorption
UL-AuNPs display a broad range of light absorption due to plasmonic coupling between the gold nanospheres and nanothorn structures.31–33 In our study, UL-AuNPs were synthesized via the chemical reaction of H2O2 using silver ions (Ag+) for inducing nanothorn structures. The reduction of gold nanoparticles to gold ions by H2O2 has been reported in several studies.36,37 The anisotropic growth of gold nanothorns on the surface of UL-AuNPs was induced by adding a small amount of Ag+.31–33 The average size of UL-AuNPs was approximately 60–80 nm, and the maximum wavelength of absorption was 730 nm, as shown in Fig. 2. UL-AuNPs can be easily dispersed in water-soluble PEDOT:PSS. However, UL-AuNPs did not blend well within the P3HT:PCBM active layer and were not substantially deposited onto the active layer.

When UL-AuNPs were blended with the P3HT:PCBM layer, a rough surface morphology was observed (Fig. S3, ESI†), which could result from the aggregation of UL-AuNPs in P3HT:PCBM, which is dissolved in an organic solvent. Hence, the performance of OSCs decreased when UL-AuNPs were blended with the active layer. These results are further highlighted in the ESI† (Fig. S4). We studied the effect of UL-AuNPs dispersed in PEDOT:PSS films. The UV-vis absorption of PEDOT:PSS films, after blending with UL-AuNPs, was measured at various concentrations of UL-AuNPs (Fig. 3). The UV-vis spectrum shows that the absorption of PEDOT:PSS films is clearly dependent on the concentration of UL-AuNPs. The absorption of PEDOT:PSS films in the wavelength range 500–800 nm increased when PEDOT:PSS films were blended with UL-AuNPs. Moreover, the baseline spectrum of PEDOT:PSS films was shifted when UL-AuNPs were incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS layer. The increase in absorption depends on the effect of UL-AuNP LSPR and Mie scattering.13

However, when the concentration of UL-AuNPs was increased to 0.07 mM, absorption began to decrease, indicating that certain aspects of UL-AuNPs disappear from the film. To study this phenomenon, we evaluated the AFM images of the films (Fig. 4). The AFM images reveal a smooth surface and the presence of a small amount of UL-AuNPs on the PEDOT:PSS film at both 0.01 mM and 0.05 mM, indicating that UL-AuNPs are well dispersed in the PEDOS:PSS films. However, when the concentration was increased to 0.07 mM, UL-AuNPs aggregate and clusters were observed on the PEDOT:PSS films. Typically, nanoparticles without a stabilizer or a capping agent tend to aggregate and precipitate to reduce the surface energy of the system.38

3.2 Effect of UL-AuNPs in OSCs
The current density versus voltage (J–V) properties and photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated OSCs, with and without UL-AuNPs in PEDOT:PSS films, are given in Fig. 5 and Table 1, respectively. The standard deviation was obtained by measuring three different devices of the same structure. To study the effect of UL-AuNPs, the concentration of UL-AuNPs in the PEDOT:PSS films was increased from 0.01 mM to 0.09 mM. The reference cells without UL-AuNPs (UL-AuNPs at 0 mM) exhibit a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 6.2 ± 0.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.622 ± 0.005 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.60 ± 0.01, and a solar cell efficiency (η %) of 3.07 ± 0.06%. The JSC values of OSCs with 0.01 mM and 0.05 mM UL-AuNPs increased to 6.41 ± 0.08 mA and 6.9 ± 0.1 mA, respectively, in comparison to the reference cell. In contrast, VOC was not significantly altered. The results indicate that the UL-AuNPs increased the number of photocarriers through increased light trapping at these concentrations but did not affect the energy diagram of P3HT:PCBM layers. Hence, an enhancement of approximately 12.21% in JSC and approximately 5.86% in η was obtained in the case of 0.05 mM concentration. However, OSCs with 0.07 mM and 0.09 mM UL-AuNPs exhibited a decrease in JSC and η compared to the reference cell.

Furthermore, with 0.09 mM UL-AuNPs, an obvious decrease in the VOC and J–V curves was observed (Fig. 5). This can be explained by the following reasons. (1) The large aggregation of UL-AuNPs in PEDOT:PSS films shown in the AFM image (Fig. 4e) causes a connection between the anode and the active layer, resulting in a short circuit in the system. Indeed, a decrease of shunt resistance (Rsh), originating from the leak current, was observed at 0.09 mM UL-AuNPs (Fig. S5, ESI†). Although the reason for an increase of Rsh at 0.07 mM is not yet clear, this indicates that there is no current leakage at this concentration. (2) There is contact between the UL-AuNP aggregates in the PEDOT:PSS layer and P3HT:PCBM layers, which interferes with electron or hole transport. Such a contact is possible because gold aggregates can act as a recombination center.39–41 To investigate the decay of η (%) with UL-AuNPs at high concentrations, we measured the interfacial properties of the OSCs by impedance spectroscopy.
3.3 Impedance spectroscopy of OSCs
Impedance spectroscopy is a useful technique to investigate the interfacial properties of solar cells, such as electron transport and recombination.42,43 To identify the difference in the interfacial properties of these photovoltaic cells, impedance spectra were acquired at an open-circuit voltage in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz, an alternate current amplitude of 15 mV, and under solar light irradiation at 75 mW cm−2. The Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra at various concentrations of UL-AuNPs in OSCs are shown in Fig. 6. Single semicircular curves were observed at all concentrations. The Z′ value (approximately 9 Ω) on the left-hand side of the semicircle is equivalent to the series resistance of the circuit, which is similar to the values obtained from extrapolating J–V curves. The diameter of the semicircle at this frequency is related to the bulk resistance of the circuit.44–46 As seen from the figure, the diameter of the semicircle decreases with increasing UL-AuNP concentration up to 0.05 mM, which also indicates a decrease in bulk resistance. This is reasonable because a small amount of metallic nanoparticles in the PEDOT:PSS film should decrease the resistance of the film.47 However, when the concentration of the UL-AuNPs is increased to 0.07 mM the diameter of the semicircle tends to increase; moreover, at 0.09 mM, the diameter of the semicircle is greater than that of the reference OSCs without UL-AuNPs. This indicates that the bulk resistance is higher than that of the reference OSCs. The observed trend correlates well with the efficiency η of OSCs.
 Fig. 6  Nyquist plots of OSCs show the effect of UL-AuNP concentration on OSCs blended with PEDOT:PSS and a comparison with reference OSCs (UL-AuNPs at 0 mM). 
To explore the effect of UL-AuNPs on the carrier transport and recombination in OSCs, the Bode phase plots were investigated (Fig. S6, ESI†). Generally, the single characteristic frequency peak (fmax) correlates with the photoinduced carrier lifetime (τ) in the nanocomposite electrodes, which relates to the efficiency of OSCs, as explained by the following equation:40,41 τ = 1/(2πfmax)(1) The probability of carrier recombination increases when the carrier lifetime decreases. The table inserted in Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows that the carrier lifetime is slightly decreased by adding 0.01 and 0.05 mM UL-AuNPs, which could be due to an increase in the number of photocarriers, resulting in an increase in electron–hole recombination (Fig. S6, inset table, ESI†). This indicates that the increase in the number of photocarriers enhances the photocurrent even with an increase in recombination probability.
Normally, AuNPs act as recombination centers and decrease the carrier lifetime of the device to some extent.39,40 However, the lifetime of the electrons is then increased to a value similar to that of the reference cell (UL-AuNPs at 0 mM) by adding UL-AuNPs at concentrations of 0.07 and 0.09 mM. However, in this study, the lifetime (τ) at higher concentration is still not longer than that of the reference cell without UL-AuNPs. Therefore, the decreased efficiency of OSCs with 0.07 and 0.09 mM UL-AuNPs is probably not due to the increase in the number of recombination centers but due to the leak current originating from the large aggregation of UL-AuNPs.
3.4 Comparison of OSC properties with UL-AuNPs and with AuNPs
To further study the effect of nanothorn structures on UL-AuNPs, we compared the properties of OSCs with spherical AuNPs of the same size (Fig. S7, ESI†) and concentration (0.05 mM for both UL-AuNPs and spherical AuNPs). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the fabricated OSCs is shown in Fig. 7a. OSCs with both UL-AuNPs and AuNPs exhibited a higher IPCE as compared to the reference OSCs over a broad wavelength range. The increase in η for OSCs with UL-AuNPs and spherical AuNPs was approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, as compared to that of the reference cell (Fig. S8, ESI†). Furthermore, we observed that OSCs with UL-AuNPs exhibited a higher efficiency than those with spherical AuNPs.
 Fig. 7  (a) Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and (b) enhancement factor (E.F.) versus UV-vis spectra showing the effect of particle shape between AuNPs and UL-AuNPs on OSCs. 
To conclusively show the effects of UL-AuNPs and spherical AuNPs, the enhancement factor (E.F.), which is the ratio of the IPCE of UL-AuNPs or spherical AuNPs to that of the reference OSCs without AuNPs, was determined (Fig. 7b). UV-vis absorption spectra of UL-AuNPs and spherical AuNPs were also similarly compared to that of the reference OSCs (Fig. 7b). In the case of OSCs with spherical AuNPs, the IPCE was enhanced in the 400–620 nm range as compared to that of the reference OSCs. This is reasonable because the spherical AuNPs exhibit LSPR at approximately 500 nm to 600 nm.47–50 In contrast, the IPCE of OSCs with UL-AuNPs was enhanced over a broad wavelength range because UL-AuNPs have a broad LSPR peak as compared to the spherical AuNPs of the same particle size (Fig. 7b). At lower wavelengths (<500 nm), the enhanced IPCE could be attributed to the enhanced light scattering from the AuNPs because there is no LSPR peak in this wavelength region. Even in the 400–500 nm wavelength region, the IPCE of OSCs with UL-AuNPs was higher than that of OSCs with spherical AuNPs. This could be due to the large light scattering originating from the gold nanothorn structures on the particle surface.31–33
To evaluate the enhanced electric field from the nanothorn structures, FDTD simulations (FDTD solutions, Lumerical solutions, Inc. Canada) were performed. It has been reported that the increase in the electric field around the AuNPs corresponds to the enhancement of absorption and light scattering in the layer.13 As shown in Fig. 8, UL-AuNPs show an enhanced electric field at 700 nm, located near each nanothorn. This result corresponds to the enhanced efficiency of OSCs in the longer wavelength region (Fig. 7b). In the case of spherical AuNPs, the electric field enhancement is still observed at 700 nm. The reason for the decrease in the efficiency of OSCs in this wavelength region for spherical AuNPs remains unclear. However, the FDTD simulations indicate that the UL-AuNPs exhibited higher electric field enhancements in comparison to spherical AuNPs. At 560 nm, spherical AuNPs show a higher electric field enhancement in comparison to UL-AuNPs, corresponding to the LSPR absorption spectra shown in Fig. 7b. At this wavelength, the IPCE of OSCs with UL-AuNPs is higher than that of OSCs with spherical AuNPs, although both OSCs were better than the reference OSCs. One possibility for this is that each of the nanothorns enhances light scattering more than the spherical AuNPs. At 450 nm, the electric field intensity for both UL-AuNP and spherical AuNPs is slightly enhanced, which corresponds to the IPCE results. Hence, we believe that the improvement of OSCs with UL-AuNPs should be due to the plasmonic electric field enhancement/scattering effect.

4. Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated the use of unique UL-AuNPs for OSC applications. UL-AuNPs in PEDOT:PSS films play an important role in improving the power conversion efficiency through an enhanced electric field and light scattering within OSCs. We observed that the efficiency of OSCs with UL-AuNPs was not only higher than that of a reference cell without nanoparticles but also higher than that of OSCs with spherical AuNPs. Furthermore, to understand the experimental results, FDTD simulations were performed by assuming the UL-AuNP structure in OSCs. FDTD simulations indicate an increased electric field distribution around gold nanothorns, which is in agreement with the experimental results. Based on our results, we conclude that the use of UL-AuNPs offers new opportunities toward a remarkable increase in the efficiency of OSCs.
