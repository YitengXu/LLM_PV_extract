    , Accepted 9th December 2018First published on 10th December 2018AbstractAn advantage of colloidal quantum dots, particularly perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), as photoactive components is that they easily form complexes with functional organic molecules, which results in hybrids with enriched photophysical properties. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of stable ground state complexes of CsPbBr3 PQD with two widely used molecular electron acceptors, fullerene (C60) and anthraquinone, (AQ) which contain carboxylic anchor groups. Dynamics of the photo-induced electron transfer in the hybrids were compared. The use of carboxylic groups for binding results in stable complex formation and their photophysical properties depend on the ratio of components but not the absolute concentrations (up to micromolar concentrations). Time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy shows that in both cases, a charge separated (CS) state is formed. Data analysis was aimed to evaluate the CS time constant in ideal one-to-one complexes and was found to be in the range of 30–190 ps. The CS state of PQD–AQ complexes recombines directly to the ground state in roughly one microsecond. Recombination of the CS state of PQD–C60 is more complex and points to strong inhomogeneity of these complexes. Majority of the CS states relax by first forming the C60 triplet state.
Introduction
Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), particularly metal chalcogenide QDs have been extensively studied owing to their various attractive properties, including size-tunable optical properties, high fluorescence quantum yields, excellent photostability and functionality.1–7 These properties render them applicable in versatile devices, such as light emitting diodes, biological sensors and solar cells.8–15 Recently, organic–inorganic lead halide-based perovskite materials (MPbX3: M = CH3NH3, HC (NH3)2, Cs; X = Cl, Br, I) have also been investigated because of their excellent solar cell performances, even with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20% (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell).16–25 However, the widely used organic–inorganic perovskites, such as methylammonium lead halide, were found to be thermally unstable beyond a certain temperature.26 Recently, inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3), more specifically cesium lead halide-based nanocrystals, have gained increasing attention as an alternative owing to their higher thermal stability, unique optical properties, and high quantum yields of emission.27–34 Extended functionality of nano-systems can be achieved by combining QDs with organic molecules. This motivates the investigation of the fundamental photophysical properties of perovskite nanocrystals in combination with organic dyes as a way to design multicomponent systems for further applications of such nanocrystal composites in light-harvesting and light-emitting devices as well as those beyond the traditional QD applications. In the last few years, some groups have explored charge transfer (CT) in perovskite nanocrystals coupled with organic molecules. For example, Ponseca et al. reported the time scale and mechanism of electron transfer from MAPbI3 perovskite to the organic acceptor PCBM.35 Biju et al. showed the channeling of exciton migration into electron transfer to fullerene in a fullerene-doped formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystal film.36 Furthermore, few reports are available on the CT process in solutions of PQDs and organic molecules (e.g., benzoquinone, phenothiazine, 4,5-dibromofluorescein, aminopyrene and perylenetetracarboxylic diimide), where the concentration of the organic molecules is high enough (typically in millimolar range) to ensure diffusion-controlled interaction between the excited PQDs and organic molecules or to provide suitable conditions for equilibrium-type organic molecules-PQDs complex formation and dissociation.37–41 Although these types of excited state interactions demonstrate principle possibility of the excited state interactions in the hybrid systems, it is strongly desired to develop stable ground state complexes which have desired photophysical properties that are independent of the diffusion rate and compound concentrations.
In this study, we investigated the photoinduced CT process in CsPbBr3 PQDs in presence of two electron acceptor molecules, namely, AQ and C60 (molecular structures are shown in insets of Fig. 1). Both molecules are equipped with binding carboxylic groups, which can form stable ground state PQD–AQ/C60 complexes and thus allow the photoinduced CT process to work at micromolar concentrations of the compounds. Electrochemical study of the compounds implies that electron transfer from PQD to both acceptors, AQ and C60, is thermodynamically feasible. The CT was confirmed by employing time resolved spectroscopy techniques, which revealed the formation of new TA bands corresponding to AQ and C60 radical anions at 640 and 1040 nm, respectively. The analysis of spectroscopy data is complicated due to the statistical nature of complex formation. Therefore, the analysis was specifically designed to evaluate the CS time constant in ideal one-to-one complexes. In PQD–AQ complex, the electron transfer takes place with a time constant of 30 ps, followed by charge recombination with a time constant of roughly 1 μs. In the case of PQD–C60, the electron transfer (ET) in one-to-one complex occurs from PQD to C60 with a time constant of 190 ps; majority of the CS states then relax by yielding the C60 triplet state.

Results and discussion
Details of materials, experiment and methods are given in the ESI.† Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed to determine the valence band (VB), conductance band (CB) energy of PQD as well as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), particularly the LUMO energy of AQ and C60. The DPV curves of PQD, AQ and C60 are given in ESI Fig. S1.† The estimated VB and CB energy of PQD relative to the vacuum level are −5.50 and −3.0 eV, respectively. The LUMO energies of AQ and C60 are −3.46 and −3.64 eV relative to the vacuum level, respectively (see ESI† for details of calculations). From the thermodynamic standpoint, electron transfer from PQD to AQ and C60 is highly expected upon excitation of PQD, as suggested by the relatively large driving force of 0.4–0.6 eV.
Steady state absorption and emission spectra of PQD and different PQD:acceptor ratios of PQD–AQ and PQD–C60 hybrids are depicted in Fig. 1. The lowest energy absorption peak of PQD is hidden by the higher energy bands, but its position can be roughly estimated to be at 500 nm, i.e., the bandgap of the PQD is approx. 2.5 eV. The absorption spectra of PQD and PQD–AQ/C60 hybrids are almost similar because the absorption intensities of AQ and C60 are much lower than that of PQD in the studied wavelength range and at concentrations of AQ and C60 used (typically 2–6 μM). It is to be noted that the PQD absorption spectra remains intact even after complex formation with AQ or C60. Steady state emission spectra show that the emission intensity of PQD is quenched upon addition of AQ or C60. Emission quenching is more than 50% for 1:1 molar ratio of PQD to acceptor. A remarkable fluorescence quenching of PQD is observed after the addition of a very small amount of the acceptors although AQ and C60 are poorly soluble in toluene. This is an indication of complex formation between PQD and AQ/C60 through the carboxylic acid binding groups, although the geometry of these complexes, e.g., side or edge attachment of the acceptor to PQD, cannot be determined. The quenching efficiency increases with the increase in acceptor concentration as expected.
Emission decays of PQD at different ratios of PQD:acceptor hybrids are shown in ESI Fig. S2.† The decays could be fitted to the tri-exponential model and the fitting parameters are given in ESI Tables S1 and S2.† The average emission lifetime of PQD decreases with the increase in the ratio of AQ/C60, which is in agreement with the steady state quenching trend (ESI Fig. S3C and D†). The relationship between relative emission intensity and lifetime quenching was quantitatively evaluated by employing Poisson statistics on ground state complex formation (see ESI and Fig. S3† for details). The fitted results showed only a 5% mismatch between the experimental and model sample concentration ratios for PQD–AQ samples, which is well within the experimental accuracy. For PQD–C60, the mismatch is somewhat large (20%), and it is probably attributed to the poorer solubility of C60 than that of AQ, thus incurring higher loss of compound on sample preparation. An indirect confirmation of this hypothesis is indicated by the larger deviation of the relative quenching values for a series of PQD–C60 samples as compared with those of the PQD–AQ samples. Nevertheless, we believe that 20% deviation is acceptable for samples at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, these results suggest efficient ground state complex formation for both types of hybrids. To investigate the effect of the binding of COOH group to PQDs surface on the emission intensity, a control experiment was performed by adding decanoic acid to a dispersion of PQDs. No noticeable changes were observed in the steady state emission and lifetime of PQDs (see ESI Fig. S4†). Therefore, it can be concluded that the COOH group of acceptors has no influence on the photophysical properties of PQDs.
The plausible mechanisms for the emission quenching of PQDs are energy transfer, charge transfer or both energy and charge transfer simultaneously from PQD to AQ or C60. Here, the energy transfer process may be ruled out because the overlap between the absorption spectra of AQ or C60 and emission spectra of PQD is negligible (ESI Fig. S5†). The only other possible mechanism for quenching is through the electron transfer from PQD to AQ or C60 since the energy levels of PQD and AQ/C60 are thermodynamically feasible for this process.
To confirm the electron transfer from PQD to AQ or C60 and to investigate the charge transfer relaxation mechanism, time-resolved TA measurements were performed (see ESI† for the description of experimental set up and study of the effect of excitation density on TA response of the PQDs, Fig. S6†). The strongest transient absorption response of PQDs was observed at 504 nm, which corresponds to the bleaching of the lowest energy absorption band of PQDs. At this wavelength, the responses of the samples (PQD, PQD–AQ and PQD–C60) were clearly different, as presented in Fig. 2. In addition, the TA responses of PQD–AQ and PQD–C60 samples deviated strongly from the emission decays. To identify the processes responsible for this difference, the TA spectra of the samples were measured and analyzed. Fig. 3A shows the TA spectra of PQD alone when excited at 470 nm. The transient responses at all wavelengths decrease simultaneously except for the very short delay time of <1 ps, which was mostly observed at the red edge of the PQD absorption band (Fig. 3A, positive peaks close to 500 nm) and can be attributed to the hot carrier thermalization.39,42–44 The decay at >1 ps delay is non-exponential, but can be fitted globally reasonably well using a decay model employing Poisson statistics to account for quenchers, which will be referred to as the Poisson model in short (see ESI†).45–47 The global fit provided the lifetime of defect-free PQDs as roughly 30 ns, while relative concentration of the defects was 0.23 ± 0.01 and the quenching time constant was 155 ± 6 ps. The resulting decay-associated component spectra are presented in ESI Fig. S7.†

The time-resolved differential absorption spectra of PQD–AQ hybrid with ratio of 1:3 at different delay times are depicted in Fig. 3B. The IR part of the spectrum is featureless similarly to the pure PQD sample, but the red part of the spectrum shows a band shaping up at delay time >10 ps. Comparison of the TA spectra of the PQD–AQ hybrid and pure PQD reveals a new band centered at 640 nm in the former. This band can be assigned to the AQ radical anion,48–50 thus confirming photoinduced electron transfer from PQD to AQ. A three-component fit was used to obtain a reasonable data approximation in the visible wavelength region. The resulting decay component spectra are shown in Fig. 4A. The first component is the fast component with a time constant of 0.2 ps is attributed to the thermal relaxation, similar to the PQD sample. The second component follows the Poisson model, which is associated with some recovery of ground state bleaching at around 504 nm and anion band formation in the red region of the spectrum. The best fit values for PQD quenching are as follows: relative quencher concentration is 2.0 ± 0.4 and quenching time constant (for ideal one-to-one complex) is 30 ± 3 ps. The third component is the spectrum of the state, which does not decay in the nanosecond time scale and is seen as a time-resolved spectrum at delays >100 ps. Transient absorption decays of PQD–AQ at three characteristic wavelengths are presented in Fig. 4B along with model decay curves (solid lines) obtained from the global fit. The spectrum of excited PQD plateaus in a fraction of picosecond. The effect of charge separation can be seen in the time domain of 10–100 ps at all the three wavelengths; at 636 nm, it can be observed as the rise of absorption, but at the other two wavelengths, it is seen as the relaxation of the initial signal associated with the excited state of PQD. At a delay time close to 100 ps, bleaching at 504 nm is roughly at 60% level relative to the maximum bleaching level and does not change till the end of the pump–probe time window at 5.5 ns. In sharp contrast, a smooth emission decay of the same sample is observed with an average time constant of 0.31 ns (see ESI Fig. S2 and Table S1†). This indicates that the bleaching at >100 ps is not due to the excited state of PQD but rather due to positively charged PQDs, which will be discussed later.

(B) Transient absorption decay profiles of PQD–AQ at three selected wavelengths (indicated on the plot). Symbols indicate measured data and solid lines represent global fits. Decay at 504 nm is multiplied by 0.02 to fit the scale. Time scale is logarithmic. 
The CS state recombines at a time scale much longer than the maximum scan range of the pump–probe instrument (6 ns), which is denoted in Fig. 4A as “long”. To find out the recombination time of the PQD–AQ hybrid, decay of PQD–AQ hybrid was measured by flash photolysis at the excitation wavelength of 470 nm and monitored in the wavelength range of 550–950 nm. Global fitting of all the decays resulted in two components, and the spectral shape of the component with time constant 688 ns matches well that of the “long” component measured using the pump–probe (see ESI Fig. S8†). Thus, the CS state recombines in the time scale of 1 μs.
In the case of PQD–C60 hybrids, the TA spectral features were much different from those of PQD and the PQD–AQ hybrid. The TA and decay component spectra of PQD–C60 hybrid at 1:3 ratio are shown in Fig. 5. On a qualitative level, the TA spectrum of PQD–C60 at short delays (e.g. 2 ps in Fig. 5A) is essentially the same as those of PQD and PQD–AQ samples, which can be attributed to the excited PQD. At longer delays (100 ps in Fig. 5A) the decay of signal in the visible part is accompanied by reshaping of the spectrum in the NIR range, forming a band near 1040 nm. This band is still visible even at 500 ps delay time, but a new reshaping trend can be seen in the red region, resulting in a formation of a broad absorption in the 680–750 nm range. In the TA spectrum, at maximum delay time (5500 ps, Fig. 5A), very minor absorption can be seen at 504 and 1040 nm, but a relatively strong and broad absorption band is formed at around 720 nm. These rather complex spectral perturbations require at least four components for a successful global fit. The fitting model comprised fast exponent, Poission decay, stretched-exponential and long-lived components, and the resulting decay-associated component spectra are shown in Fig. 5B. The fast component (0.2 ps) is attributed to thermal relaxation similar to that observed in PQD and PQD–AQ. The Poission component is associated with some recovery of bleaching at 504 nm and spectrum reshaping in the NIR region. The band at 1040 nm can be attributed to the fullerene radical anion.10,51–53 The quenching parameters of the Poission component are as follows: quencher relative concentration is 3 ± 1 and the quenching time constant is 190 ± 60 ps, which is the ET time constant in an ideal one-to-one PQD–C60 complex. This band decays non-exponentially but can be fitted by a single stretched-exponential with the average time constant of 540 ± 20 ps and stretching parameter β = 0.72 ± 0.2. Two interesting spectral features associated with this component are the broad band at around 720 nm and the nearly complete recovery of PQD ground state bleaching (at 504 nm). The spectrum of the “long” component represents the TA of the sample at long delay time (>3 ns). The band at 720 nm cannot be attributed to an intermediate state involving PQD since it appears as the result of fullerene anion decay. A more reasonable assignment of the band is to the triplet state of fullerene.54,55 An indirect conformation of this hypothesis would be the very minor bleaching of PQD ground state absorption (decay kinetics of PQD with and without C60 at 504 nm are given in Fig. 2) associated with the long-lived component, which shows the highest intensity of the 720 nm band (Fig. 5B) for the same component. For comparison, transient absorption decays at three characteristic wavelengths (504 nm, 720 nm and 1036 nm) are presented and discussed in ESI Fig. S9† together with model decay curves (solid lines) obtained from the global fit.

The time constant of the long-lived component (Fig. 5B) is beyond the resolution of our pump–probe instrument. The long-lived component is not accurate, but is rather an indication that there could be intermediate state(s) with lifetime (much) longer than 6 ns. To clarify this, decays of PQD–C60 hybrid were measured by nanosecond flash photolysis at the excitation wavelength of 470 nm and monitoring in the wavelength range of 550–1050 nm. After global fitting of all the decay curves, a component was obtained with a time constant of 14 μs and spectrum that matched well with the long-lived component measured using the pump–probe (see ESI Fig. S10†). Thus, it was confirmed that the absorption band at 720 nm is due to the formation of the triplet state of C60. We can also consider energy transfer from PQD to C60, which then decays to the triplet state of C60. This can be ruled out because of two reasons. First, the time constant of the inter-system crossing for C60 is 1.4 ns,56 which was not observed in this study. Second, the inter-system crossing should not affect the absorption of PQD, but the 540 ps component has a strong appearance at 504 nm. Thus, the simplest interpretation of these results is a linear chain of reactions as mentioned below:PQD*–C60 → PQD+–C60− → PQD–C60T
The spectra of intermediate state can be calculated from the fit result of Fig. 5A, as presented in ESI Fig. S11.† Though the triplet state spectrum (PQD–C60T) cannot be separated from that of the CS state based on the results from pump–probe measurements, it is shown as a superposition of the two intermediate states PQD–C60T + PQD+–C60−. However, it is interesting to observe that for both CS states, PQD+–AQ− and PQD+–C60−, the bleaching at 504 nm recovers only partially (by roughly 40%). This suggests that the PQD cation retains a strong bleaching at the lowest energy band (504 nm in our case).
The electron transfer properties are typically estimated by considering the energies of the states involved. A simplified energy diagram based on the electrochemical and steady state spectroscopy measurements is presented in Fig. 6, which shows the lowest conduction band (CB) of PQD, the first excited singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states of the acceptors C60 and AQ, and the charge separated (CS) states corrected to account for the Coulomb interaction (evaluated assuming donor–acceptor distance of 4.3 nm). The relative positions of the singlet and triplet states are reasonably accurate on this diagram as they are obtained from the same set of measurements and agree well with literature data.54,57 The relative position of PQD CB is less accurate as the reduction of PQD is not completely reversible and there is a discrepancy between the optical and electrochemical band gaps. In any case, the energy of PQD is sufficiently high to allow efficient electron transfer from the CB of PQD to LUMO of C60 or AQ. Interestingly, although the ET driving force is almost 0.2 eV higher for C60 than AQ, the time constant of the electron transfer in ideal one-to-one complexes is shorter for AQ (30 vs. 190 ps). This can be explained by a large distance of C60 from the PQD surface due to a longer and more flexible linker. It can also be noted that the so-called edge-to-edge distance in both these complexes is rather small, within the range of 2–5 Å. At this distance the ET in molecular donor–acceptor systems, e.g., porphyrin-fullerene, porphyrin-AQ, phthalocyanine-fullerene dyads, takes place in a few picoseconds or faster.58–63 However, in PQD–AQ and PQD–C60 the ET takes around hundred picoseconds. Formally, this can be attributed to a huge difference in the center-to-center distance, which is 4–5 nm for PQD complexes and closer to 2 nm in the case of molecular dyads mentioned above.
 Fig. 6  Energy diagram based on the electrochemical and steady state measurements. 
Ways to measure the donor–acceptor distance in these different systems are still unclear. However, from the view point of the electron transfer theory, we can refer to electronic coupling that depends on the overlap of electronic wave functions of the initial state (electron localized on the CB of PQD in our case) and the final state (electron localized on the acceptor LUMO). Definitely, the electronic wave function of PQD is spread over a much larger volume than that of a molecular donor (e.g. porphyrin). Thus, it will have lower intensity in the overlap area and result in a smaller value for electronic coupling. Considering this, it is not surprising that the ET is rather slow in PQD complexes even when their edge-to-edge distance is close to minimum. A rough estimation of electronic coupling based on the ET time constant and complex geometry (see ESI† for details) suggests that it is not larger than 1 meV (or <10 cm−1). A relatively long lifetime of the CS state is also reasonable since the free energy of the state is high (close to 2 eV) and the reorganization energy is small (less than 0.2 eV). The overall conclusion is that relatively slow charge separation and recombination occurs in PQD complexes due to weaker overlap of the electronic wave functions and the resulting low value of the overlap integral.
The surprising finding, however, is different relaxation mechanisms, i.e., via the triplet state for C60 and directly to the ground state for PQD–AQ. For both acceptors, the triplet state is located relatively close to the lowest excited singlet state. However, no experimental evidence suggesting that triplet state may be involved in the relaxation of PQD–AQ was observed, whereas the band at 720 nm clearly indicates the formation of the C60 triplet state in PQD–C60. We can notice a non-intense C60 anion band at 1040 nm, which co-exists with the 720 nm band. This indicates that the PQD–C60 complexes may have different arrangements, which might result in a very different relaxation time of the CS state. Nevertheless, there are no experimental results to quantify the difference between the mechanisms and understand the reasons leading to the triplet state-mediated charge recombination.
Conclusions
In summary, PQDs are reasonably good electron donors when coupled with acceptors such as quinone or fullerene. The main advantage of PQDs (and any other QDs for that matter) is probably that they are much better light harvesters than any molecular dye. Herein, we demonstrated efficient photo-induced electron transfer from PQD to two molecular acceptors, fullerene C60 and anthraquinone. The time constant of ET in ideal one-to-one complexes was evaluated to be in the range of 30–190 ps. This is not a fast ET compared with that of numerous molecular donor–acceptor systems, but it produces a CS state with lifetime extended to microseconds. Another advantage of such hybrid systems is the ease of complex formation and the ability to accommodate more than one acceptor per dot, which makes them promising for complex multi-component systems.
