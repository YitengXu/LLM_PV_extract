    , Accepted 12th February 2020First published on 12th February 2020AbstractThe use of processing additives to optimize the active layer morphology in organic solar cells (OSCs) is a simple and impactful way to improve photovoltaic performance. However, the retention of high boiling point liquid additives affects the stability and lifetime of OSCs, necessitating the development of volatilizable additives that can improve efficiency at no cost of the long-term device stability. In this study, three novel volatilizable solid additives, INB-1F, INB-3F, and INB-5F, with different degrees of fluorination, are rationally designed, synthesized and added into photovoltaic solutions to fabricate OSCs. These additives evaporate upon moderate thermal annealing and exhibit higher volatility as the number of fluorine atoms increases. Our device studies show that these additives can enhance the efficiency of PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F binary cells from 15.2% to 16.5%, and that of PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F from 12.1% to 13.4%. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal attractive interactions between these additives and the non-fullerene acceptor BTP-4F, leading to enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking among BTP-4Fs, which is a favorable morphological change that we attribute to the origin of the enhanced performance and long-term stability. Our work presents a novel strategy to design new solid additives to replace liquid additives toward efficient and stable OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered a promising technology for the realization of renewable solar energy conversion for their attractive advantages, e.g. lightweight, low-cost and the feasibility of manufacturing large-area devices on mechanically flexible substrates using solution casting methods.1–5 Besides, semitransparent or fully transparent OSCs can also be integrated with buildings to extend their applications.6,7 New donor and acceptor materials, especially non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFAs) like BTP-4F (also known as Y6), drive the steady progress of OSCs.8–10 The employment of these new semiconductors,11–13 morphology control,14,15 interfacial engineering16,17 and device architecture design18,19 have improved the maximum achievable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to over 16% in single-junction OSCs and over 17% in tandem OSCs.8,20–24 However, the majority of OSCs achieving over 16% PCEs necessarily employ a ternary strategy (i.e. with more than one donor/acceptor pairs in the photoactive layer) to achieve complementary light absorption and superior optoelectronic properties.23–28
Morphology control steps,14 such as thermal annealing,29,30 vapor annealing,31,32 hot-substrate casting15,33 and solvent additive modulation,34–37 have been shown to be effective and crucial to realize the maximum achievable PCEs. Among these approaches, solvent additives can effectively regulate the molecular packing and orientation of electron donors and acceptors from the solution state through to vitrified solid films, and tune the phase-separated domain size, purity and connectivity, which ultimately determine the device PCE.38 The selection of solvent additives for non-fullerene OSCs has largely relied on the results obtained for fullerene-based OSCs, which traditionally use high boiling point additives like 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),39 diphenyl ether (DPE)40 and 1-chloro-naphthalene (1CN).41 These additives have been found to reside longer than the primary solvents in the dried films and undergo preferential interaction with PCBM to manipulate its packing and aggregation. Although these additives appear to be effective, they tend to reside in the photoactive layer of OSCs unless they are deliberately removed via further treatments. The presence of such additives can lead to instability of the nano-morphology and reduced device efficiency.42,43 When using additives with non-fullerene OSCs, it has been found that they may not help to improve device efficiency at all.44 Recently, novel aromatic solid additives have emerged and have been investigated. For example, Hou et al. reported the design and application of volatile solid additives to improve the efficiency of non-fullerene OSCs.45,46 However, with the exception of these reports, new volatile additives are still rare in the literature, and a variety of solid additives are of high interest to effectively regulate the morphology and efficiency of non-fullerene OSCs.
Here, we explore three volatilizable organic solid additives with different degrees of fluorination, namely INB-1F (2-(4-fluorobenzylidene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione), INB-3F (2-(2,4,6-trifluorobenzylidene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione), and INB-5F (2-((perfluorophenyl)methylene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione). These materials were designed, synthesized and utilized in two typical non-fullerene OSCs, PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F and PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F to investigate their role in controlling morphology and PCE. These additives evaporate upon thermal annealing at a temperature of 110 °C for 10 minutes, and show increasing volatility as the number of fluorine atoms increases. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal attractive interactions between these additives and the non-fullerene acceptor BTP-4F, leading to enhanced π–π stacking among BTP-4Fs that is supported by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments. In comparison to binary OSCs processed without additives, the maximum achievable PCE was enhanced from 12.1% to 13.4%, and from 15.2% to 16.5% for PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F and PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F OSCs, respectively. Our work demonstrates that such volatilizable yet solid additives can be used to manipulate molecular packing and morphology and thereby enhance device efficiency and stability, and present a new impetus to design solid additives to replace high boiling point liquid additives.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PBDB-T-2F, BTP-4F, and IT-4F, and additives INB-1F, INB-3F, and INB-5F designed in this work, are shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain good miscibility of additives with NFAs, we started with the typical terminal group 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione of NFAs, and attached benzaldehyde moieties with different number of fluorine atoms to obtain the target solid additives through the classic Knoevenagel condensation reaction (Scheme S1, ESI†). Compared to the solid additives reported by Hou's group,45,46 the fluorine atoms on the benzaldehyde unit of additives in this work increase the electron delocalization on the benzene ring, and can potentially lead to different interactions with non-fullerene acceptors. All these additives demonstrate good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), INB-1F, INB-3F, and INB-5F dissolved in chloroform have absorption peaks at 347, 330 and 327 nm, respectively. As the number of fluorine atoms on the benzaldehyde unit increases, the absorption spectrum of the additive gradually blue-shifts. The absorption peaks all red shift and broaden for thin films. These additives are solid after synthesis, but are volatile and can be sublimed by heating thin films to modest temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the spin-coated additive films virtually disappear after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. To further confirm their volatility, the changes in the thickness of pure INB-1F, INB-3F, INB-5F films (determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry) subject to increasing temperature or time are shown in Fig. 2(c and d). By either increasing the annealing temperature with a fixed annealing time, or prolonging the annealing time under a fixed temperature, INB-1F, 3F, and 5F molecules evaporate gradually. For example, by annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, the thickness of all pure additive films reduces to less than 20% of their initial thickness and the intensity of the UV-Vis spectrum reduces to nearly zero (see Fig. S1†), demonstrating significant volatility. Additionally, as the number of fluorine atoms increases, the additive becomes more volatile.

The content of the additives and the annealing temperature were firstly optimized using INB-1F as an example with PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F OSCs, having a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F/MoO3/Ag. INB-1F was added at various concentrations with respect to the NFA at mole ratios of 1:0, 1:0.2, 1:0.5 and 1:1. The device J–V curves are plotted in Fig. S2† and the device metrics are summarized in Table S1,† from which we identify that the optimal additive content is BTP-4F:INB-1F = 1:0.5, and the optimal annealing temperature is 110 °C for 10 min. Upon annealing under this condition, the thickness of the active layer is typically reduced from 140 nm for the as-cast films containing additives, to 120 nm (which is an optimized thickness of the photoactive layer and is consistent with previous work10). This process results in increased film optical absorption as a result of densification and morphological changes which we will discuss below. The UV-Vis spectra of BTP-4F neat films processed with and without additives, in an as-cast state and after thermal annealing, are plotted in Fig. 3(a). Compared with the pure BTP-4F film, the absorption spectra of films processed with additives red-shift around 13 nm with increased intensity, which could be ascribed to the enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions among BTP-4F molecules. The characteristic absorption peaks of INB-1F, 3F, and 5F in the range of 300–400 nm disappear after thermal annealing, but the intensity of the primary absorption peak of BTP-4F further increases and red-shifts, with the INB-5F additive being the most effective. The absorbance of PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F binary films processed with INB-1F, INB-3F, and INB-5F at a fixed molar ratio (half that of BTP-4F) and further treated with/without thermal annealing is shown in Fig. 3(b). A similar phenomenon can be observed in the PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F-based blend film. The pure PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F film without the presence of any additives and annealing exhibits three main and broad absorption peaks at ca. 313, 622 and 802 nm. After processing with INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F, the absorption increases in all cases and is strongest for the INB-5F additive. When these films were further processed by annealing, the peak at 300–400 nm vanishes due to the evaporation of these additives and the characteristic peak of BTP-4F is obviously red shifted with an enhanced absorption coefficient, which confirm again that additives have good volatility and they play an obvious role in enhancing the inter-molecular π–π stacking of electron acceptors. We note here that the peak located at 622 nm, which is mainly attributed to the donor PBDB-T, has not been shifted, suggesting the limited effect of these additives on regulating the structural order of PBDB-T.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PBDB-T-2F:BDP-4F OSCs are plotted in Fig. 3(c) and the corresponding device metrics are summarized in Table 1. For the reference device without any additives, a maximum PCE of 15.2% with an average Voc of 0.82 ± 0.00 V, Jsc of 26.2 ± 0.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.1 ± 1.3% were obtained. When the films were treated with these additives, the Jsc and FF both improved (although Voc of the device decreased slightly from 0.82 to 0.81 V), leading to an increase in the maximum PCEs of 15.8%, 15.9% and 16.5% for the additives INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of such OSCs is shown in Fig. 3(d); here we observe a broad response over the wavelength range 300 to 950 nm. When the device was processed using INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F, the spectral response increased, particularly over the spectral region from 400 to 850 nm; a result consistent with the enhanced Jsc of the device. The Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE spectra are 26.5, 26.7 and 27.1 mA cm−2 for devices processed with INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F, respectively. These values are only ca. 5% less than the Jsc values obtained from the J–V test, and confirm the validity of our J–V measurements.

To determine whether the effect of these solid additives generalizes to other non-fullerene OSC systems, PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F devices were also investigated. Fig. S3† shows the absorbance, J–V characteristics and EQE spectra of a reference PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F device and those of the device processed with INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F. Table S2† summarizes specific device metrics. INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F additives are also found to increase the maximum PCE of PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F devices to 13.0%, 13.1% and 13.4% for each of the three additives, from a reference of 12.2%. This demonstrates that the benefits of these additives are not limited to one specific material system but can actually enhance device performance in many non-fullerene OSCs.
To further understand how these solid additives can enhance device performance, we return to the champion system PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F. Firstly, a space charge-limited current (SCLC) method47,48 was used to characterize the charge mobility of PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F from dark J–V curves of hole-only and electron-only devices (see Fig. S4 and Table S3†). The electron and hole mobilities of the reference PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F device are 5.9 × 10−4 and 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively, leading to a μe/μh ratio of 3.7. When the PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F layer was processed with solid additives, both μe and μh increased but the μe/μh ratio became more balanced. In agreement with the observed enhancements in device efficiency, INB-5F increases μe and μh to a maximum value of 7.9 × 10−4 and 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This corresponds to the lowest μe/μh ratio of 2.5. To gain insights into the charge recombination mechanisms in the active layers, Voc and Jsc of the devices illuminated under different light intensity (Plight) were measured. As we can see from Fig. S5,† the slopes of Vocversus ln(Plight) plots are 1.55, 1.19, 1.12 and 1.03 for the reference cell and those processed with INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F, respectively, which confirm that devices treated with additives have reduced trap-assisted recombination compared with the reference device, and bimolecular recombination has become the main reason for charge loss. Besides, the slope value of log(Jsc) versus log(Plight) of the device processed with INB-5F is more close to 1 compared to others, associating with the weakest bimolecular recombination.49,50
The surface morphology of the PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F films probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is shown in Fig. S6.† We found that the surfaces exhibit a very similar morphology, with the absence of excessive clusters or holes on the film surface due to the evaporation of these solid additives. The average root-mean-square (RMS) roughness increased slightly from ca. 1 nm to 2 nm after processing with these three solid additives, demonstrating a negligible impact on the interface with the top electrode. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were used to characterise the changes in molecular packing in the PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F thin films. The 1D profiles along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction were extracted from the 2D GIWAXS patterns (see Fig. 4(a–d)) and are shown in Fig. 4(i). Literature reports9,10 indicate that pure PBDB-T-2F exhibits a (010) π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.66 Å−1 in the OOP direction, and a (100) scattering peak at qxy = 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction that is associated with lamellar stacking. BTP-4F exhibits a π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.76 Å−1 and lamellar stacking around qxy = 0.29 and 0.42 Å−1. The scattering rings at qxy = 0.30 Å−1 in Fig. 4(a–d) can be attributed to (100) of PBDB-T-2F or BTP-4F, whilst the crescent at qz = 1.76 Å−1 can be assigned to the π–π stacking of BTP-4F. When the blend film was processed using three different additives, scattering from the π–π stacking at qz = 1.76 Å−1 became more intense, especially in films processed using INB-3F and INB-5F (see Fig. 4(c and d) and in comparison with Fig. 4(i)), illustrating significantly enhanced face-on π–π stacking of the BTP-4F electron acceptor. This favorable “face-on” oriented molecular packing leads to improved electron mobility. It is notable that the (100) ring is also enhanced (see Fig. 4(c and d)), showing the same trend with the π–π stacking changes.

Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were conducted to gain information on the phase-separated domain size within various PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F blend films (see Fig. 4(e–h)). The 1D GISAXS profiles of various blend films along the IP direction are presented in Fig. 4(j) and are fitted with a universal model using the software SasView. The solid lines in Fig. 4(j) are fitted curves and the best fitting parameters are listed in Table 2. In the table, ξ, η, D, and 2Rg represent the average correlation length of the BTP-4F dispersed PBDB-T-2F phase, the correlation length of acceptors, the fractal dimension of acceptors and the size of the aggregated acceptor domain.51 As we can see from the results, the average correlation length of the BTP-4F dispersed PBDB-T-2F phase reduces whilst the domain size of acceptors increases when the films were processed using the solid additives. This suggests that these additives facilitate the migration of BTP-4F molecules from the PBDB-T-2F phase (which reduces the correlation length of the donor phase) and then form larger aggregates (which increases the correlation length of the acceptor phase). This observation is consistent with our GIWAXS characterization that the BTP-4F π–π stacking becomes stronger after treatment with the additives. Among all these additives, we find INB-5F to be the most effective at increasing the π–π stacking and correlation length of BTP-4F. Although the increase of the correlation length does not facilitate exciton dissociation (as it will reduce the density of heterojunction interfaces), it does improve charge transport as demonstrated above.

In order to understand the interactions of our additives with the electron acceptor BTP-4F, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations. The geometry configurations of additives INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F are simulated and illustrated in Fig. 5(a–c). The dihedral angles between the 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione and benzene units of INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F are 3.6°, 50.1°, 48.4° respectively. Increasing the number of fluorine atoms in the benzene ring results in a substantial twist of the two molecular units and destroys the planarity of the molecule. Fig. 5(d–f) show the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of these additives. The ESP concentration is relatively neutral in the center of INB-1F. Negative ESP gradually concentrates from the indanone to the fluorobenzene unit in INB-3F and INB-5F due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine atoms, leaving the indanone unit positively charged. We for the first time determined the interactions between the electron acceptor BTP-4F and additives. Fig. 5(g–i) show the optimal configuration of the adsorption of one INB-1F, INB-3F, INB-5F molecule onto one BTP-4F, respectively. We observed that the additive molecule prefers to stack on the central “D–A–D” unit rather than on the two terminating “A” units of BTP-4F. The adsorption energy of additives on BTP-4F (EBTP-4F/additive) is summarized in Table S4.† When the adsorption energy is smaller, the adsorption capacity will be stronger. We determined that all additives tend to adsorb on BTP-4F molecules, amongst which INB-5F shows the strongest adsorption capacity with the lowest adsorption energy of −38.5 kcal mol−1. This is associated with the smallest stacking distance between the indanone unit of the additive and the “D–A–D” unit of BTP-4F (see Table S4†). Fig. 5(j–m) shows the molecular aggregation states of four BTP-4F molecules with/without the presence of two additive molecules. As summarized in Table S5,† the average distance between two BTP-4F molecules reduces from ca. 3.6 Å of the system without the presence of any additive to 3.4 Å when the additives are added. The adsorption energies of three BTP-4F molecules on a BTP-4F surface processed with the presence of two INB-1F, INB-3F or INB-5F molecules are all below −200 kcal mol−1. These values are much lower than the absorption energy of −152.1 kcal mol−1 without any additive, implicating that the presence of these additives promotes the π–π stacking tendency of BTP-4F molecules. Our molecular dynamics simulations therefore support that these additives have attractive interactions with BTP-4F via π–π stacking, and their presence reduces the adsorption energy between BTP-4F molecules to improve the structural order. These effects are most pronounced with the additive INB-5F, which has five fluorine atoms on the fluorobenzene unit. All these observations are consistent with our morphology and device performance studies presented in the earlier sections.

Finally, the shelf-stability of the encapsulated PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F OSC devices was investigated. Such devices were tested daily and stored under ambient conditions (at an average temperature of 25 °C and humidity around 70%) when they were not being tested. Device metrics are plotted as a function of time for a total period of 30 days in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the Voc values of all devices are quite stable and remain largely unchanged after 30 days of storage in air. The Jsc and FF of the reference device however drop to below 90% of their initial values, resulting in a PCE of about 80% of the starting value. For the devices processed with additives, the Jsc values reduce as the storage time increases but at a much lower rate compared to the reference device. Here the INB-5F processed device exhibits superior shelf stability than either the INB-3F or INB-1F processed devices. The FF degradation rates of these additive processed devices are also improved to a similar level. The PCE degradation rates of these additives processed OSCs are largely a reflection of Jsc changes, as the FF and Voc of these devices change at a similar rate. Around 90% of the initial PCE is retained after ambient storage for 30 days, with the INB-5F processed OSCs demonstrating the best stability. We believe that the densely packed photoactive layer processed with these fluorinated additives is the origin of such enhanced stability.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, three volatilizable organic solid additives with different degrees of fluorination were designed and synthesized, and have been demonstrated to be effective for regulating the morphology of non-fullerene OSCs, leading to improved device efficiency and stability. These additives evaporate upon moderate thermal annealing and exhibit increased volatility as the number of fluorine atoms increases. When processed using these additives during solution casting, PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F non-fullerene OSCs undergo an improvement in efficiency from 15.2% to 16.5%, whilst that of PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F improves from 12.1% to 13.4%. Grazing-incidence X-ray studies show that the fluorinated additives, especially INB-5F, can significantly enhance the π–π stacking among electron acceptors, leading to a slightly larger acceptor domain size that improves electron mobility. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the additives have attractive interactions with BTP-4F via π–π stacking, and that their presence reduces the adsorption energy among BTP-4F molecules to promote the structural order. The additive processed devices also exhibit enhanced long-term storage stability. Our work demonstrates a promising strategy to design new solid additives to effectively improve the device performance of non-fullerene organic solar cells.
