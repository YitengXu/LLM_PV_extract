    , Accepted 3rd October 2015First published on 5th October 2015AbstractUpconversion/semiconductor submicron hollow spheres composed of inner NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er shell and outer TiO2 shell (denoted NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2) were, for the first time, crafted by exploiting colloidal carbon spheres as the scaffold. The hollow spheres were then incorporated into the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode to yield dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with improved performance. The implementation of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres in DSSCs imparted the light trapping due to the light scattering from submicron hollow spheres, and the harvesting of near infrared solar photons by the upconversion material (i.e., dual functionalities), thereby resulting in an increased short-circuit current density Jsc, and thus an improved power conversion efficiency PCE. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed to scrutinize the interfacial charge transfer characteristics of DSSCs. The measurements revealed that when NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres without the deposition of TiO2 shell were integrated in the photoanode, a high charge transfer resistance was found. In stark contrast, the judicious decoration of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres with a thin layer of TiO2 shell markedly improved the contact between the resulting NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres and the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode, leading to a much decreased charge transfer resistance. Taken together, compared to the PCE of 6.81% for the pristine device, the DSSC assembled with the introduction of 8 wt% NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres in the photoanode exhibited an optimal PCE of 7.58% and a maximum short-circuit current density Jsc of 18.72 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G one sun illumination, corresponding to 11.31% performance enhancement. As such, the implementation of upconversion submicron hollow materials in photoanode may stand out as an intriguing strategy to improve the device performance of DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have garnered much attention due to their advantageous characteristics, such as low cost, environmental benignity and high power conversion efficiency.1 The working principle of DSSCs is the absorption of sunlight by dyes and the injection of electrons from excited dyes to photoanode. However, the dye absorption range is relatively limited. For example, N719 dye absorbs primarily the sunlight from 300 nm to 800 nm, and the infrared region of sunlight accounting for approximately 48.3% of solar irradiation spectrum is not harvested. In this context, recently, upconversion nanomaterials of different shapes, including nanoparticles,2 nanorods,3 and nanoplates,4 have been exploited in DSSCs to improve the light harvesting and thus the device performance of DSSCs.5,6
Upconversion materials have been widely implemented in medicine,7 biology,8 photocatalysis,9 and energy applications.10 A variety of matrix materials such as oxides, fluorides and oxysulfides have been applied in the synthesis of upconversion materials. Among matrix materials, fluorides carry many advantages due to their very low phonon frequencies of crystal lattices.11 The doping of rare earth ions in the fluoride host matrix leads to the long life times of their excited states and high luminescence quantum yields under the IR emitting.12 The quenching of excited states of rare earth ions is minimized in the fluoride host matrix.12 For example, NaGdF4, as a fluoride-based host matrix, is often chosen to dope with the conventional upconversion ionic pair (i.e., Yb3+/Er3+), which converts the low-energy infrared light to high-energy visible light. The emission peaks of NaGdF4:Yb3+/Er3+ are located at 530 nm and 660 nm under the 980 nm irradiation with a diode laser,12,13 which matches well with the absorption spectrum of N719.
It is worth noting that the introduction of hollow micro- or submicron semiconducting spheres (TiO2 or SnO2) as the scattering layer can lead to a largely improved device performance in DSSCs.14,15 Surprisingly, fluorine-based (F-based) upconversion hollow spheres were, however, rarely reported. Although hollow cubic phase NaYF4 nanoparticles was prepared by a solution-phase synthesis using a controlled ion exchange process from cubic phase Y2O3 nanospheres,16 a hazardous chemical hydrofluoric acid (HF) was employed in order to form NaYF4 nanoparticles, making it difficult to extend this approach for practical applications. Recently, upconverter-doped TiO2 hollow spheres prepared by hydrothermal method were found to enable a largely enhanced power conversion efficiency of DSSCs.14 However, there is no report on semiconductor-decorated F-based upconversion hollow spheres incorporated in the photoanode for DSSCs.
Herein, we report on a facile, HF-free strategy to craft semiconductor TiO2-decorated upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er submicron hollow spheres (i.e., NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres) as dual-functional materials for integrating in the photoanode for DSSCs with improved efficiency. The F-based upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er submicron hollow spheres with a large specific surface area were first successfully synthesized by the ion exchange of hollow Gd2O3:Yb/Er spheres using NaF and NH4F as F resources, thereby avoiding the use of corrosive and toxic HF. Subsequently, the TiO2 shell was coated on hollow NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er sphere by a sol–gel approach. Notably, the NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres with the average diameter of 430 nm acted effectively as the scattering center and rendered the increased absorption of sunlight. In comparison to the power conversion efficiency PCE of 6.81% for a pristine device applying conventional TiO2 nanoparticle film as photoanode, the DSSC assembled with the incorporation of 8 wt% dual-functional NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 submicron hollow spheres in the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode yielded an improved PCE of 7.58% and an increased short-circuit current density Jsc of 18.72 mA cm−2. Such improvement can be attributed to dual functionalities of upconversion/semiconductor hollow spheres, that is, the light trapping by the submicron hollow spheres and the near-infrared light harvesting by the upconverting NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er (converting the near-infrared photons into green photons, which facilitated the absorption of visible photons by N719 dyes used in DSSCs), together with the favorable contact between NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres and the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode (i.e., corresponding to a low charge transfer resistance) compared to the case where pristine NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres was in contact with the TiO2 photoanode (i.e., a high charge transfer resistance).
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the formation carbon spheres with an average diameter of approximately 450 nm by hydrothermal reaction of glucose (upper central panel in Scheme 1; see Experimental section). Subsequently, a layer of Gd(OH)CO3:Yb/Er was formed on carbon spheres by hydrolysis of precursors of GdCl3·6H2O, YbCl3·6H2O and ErCl3·6H2O (upper right panel in Scheme 1). Clearly, the surface of carbon spheres became much rougher, and the size of carbon spheres after the coating of Gd(OH)CO3:Yb/Er was increased to about 540 nm (Fig. 1b). The corresponding reaction was presented in eqn (1). After sintering at 800 °C for 2 h to remove carbons, the size of original spheres reduced significantly, forming Gd2O3:Yb/Er hollow spheres with an average diameter of about 350 nm, as clearly evidenced in Fig. 1c and d (TEM image, in which the center of spheres appeared brighter than their shell). An ion exchange of Gd2O3:Yb/Er hollow spheres by employing NaF and NH4F as F resources successfully yielded the F-based upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres (Fig. 1e), while retaining their hollow structures despite the emergence of a very few nanorod-like structures on the surface of hollow spheres (see, for example, central left region in Fig. 1e). The F ion exchange with NaF and NH4F avoided the use of corrosive and toxic HF. The nanorods on the hollow sphere surface possessed a hexagonal crystalline structure.17 It has been demonstrated that NaGdF4 was much easier to form a hexagonal crystalline structure than that of NaYF4, and such structure was more stable than that of cubic phase.17 The EDS analysis showed that the ratio of Gd, Yb, Er, F and O in the nanorod (Fig. S1a and b†) was similar to that in hollow spheres (Fig. S1c and d†). Gd3+ + Yb3+ + Er3+ + (NH2)CO + H2O → NH3 + CO32− + Gd(OH)CO3:Yb/Er(1)

In order to modify the electrochemical properties of commonly used TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode in DSSCs, a thin layer of amorphous TiO2 was deposited on the surface of NaGdFxOy:Yb/Er hollow spheres by the hydrolysis of TBOT (see Experimental section; that is, forming NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres) to facilitate the contact between them. It is clearly evident in Fig. 1f, the hollow spheres became rougher and more aggregated after introducing the amorphous TiO2 shell. The TEM measurement further revealed the formation of a noticeable flocculent TiO2 layer with a thickness of roughly 35 nm (Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, as noted above, a very few nanorods on the surface of hollow spheres were also coated by amorphous TiO2. The average diameter of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow sphere was approximately 430 nm (Fig. 1f and g). Such a thin layer of amorphous TiO2 coating on the hollow sphere surface effectively modified the electrochemical properties of photoanode in DSSCs,2,5 thereby improving the device performance, as discussed later.
As an upconversion material, NaGdF4:Yb/Er (Gd:Yb:Er = 78:20:2 by weight) emits green light under the 980 nm diode laser irradiation.12,13,18 In comparison to Gd2O3, NaGdF4 possesses a lower matrix phonon energy, thereby creating a higher luminescent efficiency.19 On the other hand, N719 dye shows an absorption maximum between 500 nm and 600 nm (Fig. S2†), suggesting that N719 dye can readily absorb much green photons. In the present study, in order to enhance the green emission of upconversion Gd2O3:Yb/Er hollow spheres, the F ion exchange was performed. As described above, instead of choosing HF as the F source for preparing hollow spheres,16 the excess amount of NH4F was used. Obviously, after reacting at 110 °C for 3 h (i.e., the F ion exchange), the emission was transformed from red (Gd2O3:Yb/Er; Fig. 2a) to green (i.e., yielding green-emitting NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er; Fig. 2b). Moreover, the EDS results showed that a good amount of F ions were present in NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres, substantiating that a large number of O ions were replaced by F ions during the hydrothermal reaction (i.e., ion-exchanged) (Fig. S1†).

(c) The energy level diagram for the upconversion emission from NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er under the 980 nm NIR irradiation. (d) The emission spectra of Gd2O3:Yb(20%)/Er(2%) and NaxGdFyOz:Yb(20%)/Er(2%) exposed to a 980 nm NIR diode laser operating at 2 W. 
When the 980 nm diode laser irradiates the upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres, as the sensitizer Yb3+ ions possess a larger absorption cross section than Er3+ ions, the Yb3+ ions are preferentially excited, transfer energy to the activator Er3+ ions, and return to the ground state. The activator Er3+ ions are thus excited from the ground state (4I15/2) to the excited state (4I11/2). Subsequently, the Er3+ ions are excited to an even higher excited state (for example, 2H11/2) through a second energy transfer from the excited Yb3+ ions to Er3+ ions. The nonradiative decays of Er3+ ions to 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels are responsible for the predominant red and green emissions, that is, 4S3/2/2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (green emission) and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red emission) (Fig. 2c). Before the F ion exchange, the red emission dominated when excited by the 980 nm near infrared (NIR) irradiation as the fluorescence spectrum of Gd2O3:Yb/Er hollow spheres showed that the emission maximum at λ = 668 nm (red emission) was more intense than that at λ = 539 nm (green emission). It has been reported that the existence of O increases the multiphonon relaxation rates between the metastable states, thereby decreasing the visible emission intensity and enhancing the ratio of red to green emission.20,21 The emission of rare-earth ions in upconversion (UC) materials originates primarily from the electron transitions within the 4f shell, and depends heavily on the structure and composition of the host materials. In order to minimize the nonradiative loss, the materials with lower phonon energy are often used as the host as the fluorescent transitions of rare-earth ions are initiated from an excited level with a small energy gap.21 It has been widely recognized that the O-based systems often possess large phonon energy due to the stretching vibrations of the host molecules. Upon the exchange of O with F ions, the ratio of green to red emission was enhanced (Fig. 2d; the 520 nm peak (green emission) was stronger than that of the 656 nm peak (red emission)). Clearly, the resulting NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres emitted green fluorescence under the 980 nm NIR irradiation, which perfectly matched the absorption range of the N719 dyes (Fig. S2†). This is not surprising because the F-based systems carry the advantageous attribute as the fluorescent host materials owing to their low vibrational energy, together with the subsequent minimization of the excited state quenching of rare-earth ions.
To examine the light scattering effect of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres that were incorporated to the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode in DSSCs, their diffuse reflectance spectrum was measured. Fig. 3 compares the reflectance spectra of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow sphere film and the TiO2 nanoparticle film. The reflectance of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres was higher than that of TiO2 nanoparticles. This signified that the hollow spheres can work as scatter centers in the visible region, thereby expanding the light path-length inside the photoanode. Consequently, the photoanode was enabled with a better light-harvesting ability to improve the Jsc, and thus the PCE after the incorporation of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres, as discussed later.
 Fig. 3  Diffuse reflectance spectra of the NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres and the TiO2 nanoparticle film (no adsorption of N719 dyes). 
As shown in Table 1, the amount of N719 dyes adsorbed on NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres was lower than that of TiO2 nanoparticles, indicating that the TiO2 photoanode after incorporating NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 would decrease the amount of dye adsorption. Meanwhile, due to the presence of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres, the amount of dye adsorption on the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode alone is expected to relatively decrease, as compared to the pristine TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode. This may lead to a decrease in the device performance of the resulting DSSCs that employ more NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 in the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode.

The DSSCs were assembled by mixing different amount of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres into the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode to scrutinize the effect of semiconductor-decorated upconversion hollow spheres on the device performance. In order to reduce the contact resistance between the NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres and the TiO2 nanoparticle film, a layer of amorphous TiO2 was coated on the surface of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres to produce the shell/shell hollow spherical materials. It is worth noting that the resulting NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres still exhibited the green emission. The elemental mapping of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres revealed that all elements were uniformly distributed in the material, including F ions, indicating that the F ions were successfully introduced into the hollow sphere after the hydrothermal treatment despite that there was still much oxygen in the material (Fig. S3†). The Ti element was found to be evenly coated on the surface of the NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres (Fig. S3†). The device without the addition of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres was also prepared and served as control. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were shown in Fig. 4, and the device performance was summarized in Table 2.

It is clear that the short circuit current, Jsc was increased from 17.40 mA cm−2 in pristine device (i.e., without the incorporation of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres) to 18.72 mA cm−2 when approximately 8 wt% NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres were added to the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode, while the open circuit voltage remained unchanged (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The device performance was improved from PCE = 6.81% to PCE = 7.58% after the addition of 8 wt% NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres into the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode. However, when the content of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 was increased to 16 wt%, the PCE was decreased to 7.00%. This can be ascribed to the relatively decreased amount of dye adsorptions on the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode with incorporating more NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres.
To gain the insight into the interfacial characteristics of photoanodes before and after the incorporations of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres for DSSCs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. Fig. 5a compares the typical EIS spectra (i.e., Nyquist plots) of DSSCs without (i.e., pristine TiO2 nanoparticle film) and with the addition of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er and NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres, respectively. A frequency scan from 100 mHz to 100 kHz under one-sun illumination was chosen. The first semicircle in the high-frequency range reflects the charge transfer resistance (R1) and the constant phase-angle element (CPE1) at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The second semicircle in the intermediate frequency range represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance (R2) and the constant element (CPE2) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The values of R1, CPE1, R2, and CPE2 obtained by fitting the spectra in Fig. 5a with an EIS spectrum analyzer are summarized in Table 3. The R2 of pristine TiO2 nanoparticle film, the TiO2 nanoparticle film incorporating NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 and NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er are 68.80 Ω, 57.07 Ω, and 85.10 Ω, respectively. Clearly, this suggested that the coating of a layer of TiO2 shell by hydrolysis of TBOT (see Experimental section) on the surface of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres rendered an improved contact between the pristine TiO2 nanoparticle film and hollow spheres, and thus effectively decreased the ohmic polarization of photoanode, and imparted a better interfacial charge transfer. In contrast, when pure NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres without the TiO2 shell coating were mixed with the TiO2 nanoparticles, it led to an increase in Ohmic polarization in the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode due to the nonconductive nature of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er and the lack of favorable contact (through the TiO2 shell) with TiO2 nanoparticles.2 The EIS measurement on DSSCs employing the NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres solely as photoanode was shown in Fig. 5b, indicating that the NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres photoanode had a high resistance under the same testing conditions. It is noteworthy that the upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres exhibited a dual function, that is, acting as scattering centers that increased the light travel path in the photoanode, and upconverting the NIR photons into visible photons (primarily green emission). This increased the light harvesting yield of the adsorbed N719 dyes,9 and thus higher Jsc and PCE.

Compared to the devices under AM 1.5G one sun illumination, it is not surprising that the performances of DSSCs utilizing the pristine TiO2 nanoparticles and the TiO2 nanoparticles containing 8 wt% NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres as photoanodes under the NIR illumination were much lower (Fig. 6 and Table 4). On the basis of these results, the performance of DSSC employing the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode containing NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres slightly outperformed pristine TiO2 nanoparticle-based device (Table 4).

3. Conclusion
In summary, dual-functional semiconductor-decorated upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 submicron hollow spheres were crafted by capitalizing on a facile, HF-free strategy based on colloidal carbon spheres as the scaffold. These hollow spheres were then incorporated into the TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode in DSSCs. The unique advantages of such submicron upconversion/semiconductor NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres lie in two aspects: acted effectively as scattering centers for enhanced light trapping in DSSCs, and converted the NIR photons into green-emitting light that perfectly matched the absorption range of the N719 dyes, thereby leading to a largely improved harvesting and utilization of the NIR light. The judiciously coating TiO2 shell on NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow sphere surface (i.e., yielding NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres) contrast sharply with the pristine NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres as the former rendered the favorable contact between the hollow spheres and the TiO2 photoanode, thereby leading to a low charge transfer resistance as revealed by the EIS measurement. Taken together, compared to the PCE of 6.81% for the pristine device, the device assembled with the addition of 8 wt% NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres exhibited a PCE of 7.58%. The semiconductor-decorated upconversion hollow structures may represent an emerging class of multifunctional materials that underpin future advances in solar energy conversion.
4. Experimental section
Preparation of carbon spheres
Colloidal carbon spheres were prepared as follows: 3.5 g glucose was dissolved in 30 ml deionized water to form a clear solution. The solution was then sealed in a 45 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 200 °C for 2 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The brown precipitates were washed with acetone and distilled water for several times, and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight (upper central panel in Scheme 1).
Synthesis of Gd2O3:Yb/Er hollow spheres
Synthesis of Gd2O3:Yb/Er hollow spheres were modified from a previously reported approach.22 Briefly, 0.39 mmol (78% by weight) GdCl3·6H2O, 0.1 mmol (20% by weight) YbCl3·6H2O and 0.01 mmol (2% by weight) ErCl3·6H2O were dissolved in 10 ml ethanol and 10 ml deionized water in a 100 ml round-bottom flask. Subsequently, 1 g urea was dissolved in the above mentioned solution to form a clear solution with vigorous stirring. After that, as-prepared carbon spheres (0.1 g) noted above were added in the solution and well-dispersed by ultrasonication in an ice-water bath for 20 min. The flask containing the above mixture was then placed in an oil bath at 90 °C with vigorous stirring for 6 h prior to the collection of product by centrifugation. The dark brown precipitates were washed by distilled water and ethanol for several times, and dried at 60 °C in air. Hollow Gd2O3:Yb/Er spheres were then obtained by annealing at 800 °C for 2 h in air (lower right panel in Scheme 1).
Preparation of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres
Hollow Gd2O3:Yb/Er spheres (0.04 mmol) were mixed with NaF (0.4 mmol) and NH4F (1.2 mmol), and dispersed in 27 ml deionized water under ultrasonication for 10 min, followed by vigorously stirring for 10 min. The mixture was then transferred to a 45 ml autoclave to react at 110 °C for 3 h. The white precipitates NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres were centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times and dried in air at 60 °C for 24 h (lower central panel in Scheme 1).
Preparation of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres
0.04 mmol hollow NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er was dispersed into the mixture of isopropanol alcohol (15 ml) and deionized water (0.1 ml) by ultrasonication for 2 h. Subsequently, a moderate amount of tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBOT, 0.02 ml) was dissolved into the above solution and vigorously stirred for 12 h to yield NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow spheres. Finally, such amorphous TiO2-decorated upconversion NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres were washed with isopropanol alcohol and acetone for several times, and collected by centrifugation (lower left panel in Scheme 1).
Preparation of TiO2 NPs
TiO2 NPs were prepared by a simple solvothermal method. They were used as the photoanode in DSSCs. First, 0.5 ml acetic acid, 1 ml distilled water, 1 ml hydrochloric acid and 5 ml tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) were sequentially added into a 20 ml anhydrous alcohol. The mixture was stirred in a glass breaker for 24 h to form a yellow solution. The solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C in a furnace for 24 h to form a pale yellow slurry sample. The slurry was repeatedly washed by ethanol and water, centrifuged, filtered and dried. Finally, white powders were obtained and annealed at 400 °C in air for 2 h to yield pure anatase TiO2.
Fabrication of DSSCs
NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 submicron hollow spheres were mixed with the TiO2 nanoparticles prepared as noted above to produce NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2-incorporated TiO2 nanoparticle film as the photoanode for DSSCs. The films were fabricated by the doctor-blade method according to our previous report.23 The films were then sintered at 500 °C for 2 h (i.e., converting the amorphous TiO2 shell on NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres into the anatase form), immersed into 0.2 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min, and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min again. Subsequently, the films were immersed into the 0.5 mM N719 dye ethanol solution at room temperature for 24 h for the dye adsorption. The liquid electrolyte composed of 0.60 M BMIM-I, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, 0.1 M GTC in acetonitrile/valeronitrile 85/15 (v/v) (purchased from IoLiTec Inc) was used. The Pt counter electrode was sintered at 400 °C for 20 min after dipping the isopropanol solution of H2PtCl6 on the transparent FTO glass.
Measurements and characterizations
Current–voltage curves (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs were measured by a Keithley source meter under a simulated sunlight (a SoLux Solar Simulator). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, operated at 15 kV in high vacuum) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were preformed to examine the morphologies of hollow spheres at different sample preparation stages. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) was further conducted to analyze the elements of samples. The emission study was carried out using a 980 nm diode laser operating at 2 W. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on each single DSSC using electrochemical workstation with the frequency scan from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. The spectra were fitted using ZsimpWin software.
