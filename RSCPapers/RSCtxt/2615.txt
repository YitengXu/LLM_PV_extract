1. Introduction
Printed electronics is one of the fastest growing technologies in the world. The production of electronic devices has increased progressively, over the past several decades.1 The area of printing continued to flourish from printed text on paper to printed electronics on numerous materials such as textiles and polymer foils etc. Devices such as integrated circuits,2 sensors,3,4 batteries,5 displays,6 radio frequency identification tags (RFIDs),7,8 thin film transistors (TFTs)9 and lighting systems10 comprise a tremendous fraction of current technology and are essential for industrial, social and scientific endeavours. According to a survey, the market of flexible organic and printed electronics may reach to a whopping rise to over $300 billion to the materials and chemicals industry by 2028.11 Therefore, the printing processes and the resultant devices are of vital interest to industries.
Research into the reduction of materials or manufacturing costs, as well as the development of novel platforms for display applications, is an area attracting well-deserved interest. No other technology enables as many innovative applications as printed electronics, although additive manufacturing12 is on the rise in market and industries. Since inkjet printing is a topic of paramount importance because of its variety of applications, many research groups are involved in academia in developing the technology based on this related to several aspects. Thus, several other review articles have appeared covering this topic or certain aspects of it. Perelaer et al.13 focused on the use of metal- and metal oxide-containing ink precursors in the preparation of contacts and inter-connects including the involved sintering methods. Kamyshny et al.14 discussed the preparation of ink containing metal NPs, complex and metal–organic compounds and their printing followed by sintering methods for obtaining the conductive patterns with their applications in printed electronics. Chen et al. focused on the recent developments in materials selection and printability issues for fabrication of conducting tracks via inkjet printing technology.15 Schubert et al. discussed all the important sintering techniques with mechanisms and compatibility with high-throughput manufacturing processes and the applicability in details for the production of flexible electronic devices.16 Recent developments in printing technologies are the aim of this review article comprising numerous fabrication methods for printing inorganic nanoparticles/materials onto flexible materials such as plastic or paper owing to different aspects and subsequent application of the inorganic patterns, films etc. obtained after printing (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Different components of inkjet printing: theory, design and characteristics with applications. 
Techniques like vacuum deposition,17,18 subtractive technologies19 and lithography20etc. involve multiple steps, high processing temperatures and high costs which lead to the generation of a large amount of toxic waste. In contrast, printing processes are the attractive alternatives to the conventional patterning techniques because of fast, simple, inexpensive and low temperature processability.21–23 Fabrication using printing techniques involves several features such as thin films, coatings, etc. that perform electrical functions (conducting, semiconducting, insulating, magnetic and optical etc.) very much similar to silicon electronics. Printing in the context of electronics, irrespective of the technique, generally involves deposition of functional precursor inks in the form of certain specific patterns. They are applied in a continuous process on numerous substrates such as glass, silicon, paper and polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polypropylene etc. These polymer foils have relatively low glass transition temperatures (Tg), which often restrict the choice to more expensive polymers such as polyimide (PI). Solution based materials are printed on the above mentioned substrates to create both (sub)micro and macroelectronic patterns. The as-printed patterns require sintering at optimum temperatures depending on the limitations of the substrates. After the removal or decomposition of organic materials from the substrate, the sintered materials establish direct physical contact, which results in a continuous and conductive network throughout the printed feature. Ink can be metallic, semiconducting, or insulating in nature from the electronic point of view, irrespective of the addition of further necessary components to obtain the desired printing pattern. For increasingly complex printed devices, more and different materials are required, necessitating the establishment of ink libraries applicable to different substrates and underlying layers under different processing conditions. For surface patterning with metals both metal–organic decomposition (MOD) and metallic nanoparticle (NP) inks are used for the printing process.14,24 Each type of precursor ink has advantages and disadvantages irrespective of the quality of the printed pattern. MOD inks reduce nozzle clogging and do not need colloidal stabilizers. In contrast, NP inks are associated with high metal loading, which have low contact resistances25,26 and are available commercially.
Organic conductors are lighter, more flexible and less expensive compared to inorganic conductors. In view of this, organic conductors are suitable alternatives in applications, where high performance is not essential27,28 or where different properties have to be exploited, such as negative capacitance29 or negative supercapacitance.30 However, conductive organics are not as fast or efficient as inorganic materials such as silicon or copper, etc. There is increasing work on printed inorganics as people/organizations struggle with the performance of printed organics in many aspects. After an initial rapid progress, the device mobility achieved with completely solution processed or printed organic semiconductors has stalled around 0.1–0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.31,32 Printed electronics fabricated from metal NPs possess better direct current conductivity (∼104–105 S cm−1) than conductive polymers (∼10–102 S cm−1).33 Many inorganic semiconductors exhibit high carrier mobility and excellent stability.34 This is the reason why the printed inorganic electronics play a vital role in the industrial applications. In view of this, conductors with better conductance, for the best printed batteries and for transistor semiconductors with excellent mobility, look to the new inorganics. Inorganic printed materials/electronics is now recognized as an area of tremendous commercial, potential and technical progress.
2. Types of printing
The oldest movable type printing was invented by J. Gutenberg around 1450 in Germany, which leads to multiple production of alphabet communications.35 Nowadays, all movable printing is derived from Gutenberg's printing, where mechanical transfer processes played the major role compared to chemical processes. Four conventional mass-printing techniques exist, namely, flexographic printing, gravure printing, offset printing and screen printing, which are referred as contact printing techniques.36 The conventional printing techniques exert pressure on the substrate during ink transfer. In contrast, in digital printing processes such as inkjet and aerosol jet, ink is ejected from a nozzle in the form of droplets onto the substrate to form a digital image. In digital printing techniques, no pressure is applied to the substrate which is why they are called non-impact techniques. In view of this, inkjet printing is a non-contact printing technique. This review focuses on various aspects of inkjet printing. Other contact printing based methods are summarized in other reviews.37–40
2.1. Non-contact printing techniques
Non-contact techniques can be used on arbitrary substrates without applying mechanical pressure or damaging the pre-patterned component. Here, the substrate is in contact with the ink only, which is responsible for making up the printed features. This non-impact printing technique reduces the risks of damage and contamination which is the major problem in contact printing techniques arising from the contact between the printing tool and the substrate. Inkjet printing also allows proper alignment with different patterns over the substrate, which is highly essential to pattern multilayered devices with high accuracy and resolution. In contrast, contact printing techniques are not suitable for multilayer devices.

2.1.1. Inkjet printing. 
Inkjet printing is one of the fast emerging techniques for direct patterning of solution based materials called the precursor or ink. In this technique,21 a fixed amount of ink is ejected in the form of droplets from the reservoir through a nozzle-head. The released ink droplets fall onto the substrate (foil) under the force of gravity to make a feature. The solidification of the printed ink occurs by several processes such as solvent evaporation, crystallization etc. In most cases, post-processing treatments such as thermal annealing or sintering are carried out to remove the solvents and other additives by heating to an elevated temperature.21,41 Inkjet printing is an efficient technique because of its accurate deposition and minimal waste generation. Important parameters such as ink viscosity, surface tension and nozzle diameter are optimized before printing. Using this technique, it is possible to deposit picoliter volumes of solutions in the form of well-defined patterns, which is attained by computer controlled translation stages and ink dispensers, which promotes the production of different complex patterns. This direct writing ability of inkjet printer discards the use of physical masks or templates. Thus, there is significant cost savings, efficient utilization of materials and waste elimination, which make the inkjet printing technique interesting for many industrial and scientific applications.
Normally, inkjet printers operate in two different functional modes: continuous or drop-on-demand (DOD).


2.2.2. Continuous inkjet printing. 
In the continuous inkjet printing process, ink is transferred through a chamber from which it emerges through a nozzle, which leads to the formation of a liquid jet. The stream of liquid emerging from the liquid jet is unstable and tends to break up into droplets under the influence of surface tension, which is known as Plateau–Rayleigh instability.41 Each drop crosses an electrostatic field after its formation and thus acquires electrostatic charge while leaving the stream. Then, the charged drops hit the substrate directed by an electrostatic detection field. The uncharged drops pass into a gutter for recycling as shown in Fig. 2. The term ‘continuous’ pertains to generation of droplets without interruption followed by navigation along the trajectories, which is altered by the quantity of electric charge applied. By deflecting the drops and moving the substrate appropriately, a pattern is formed onto the substrate. This technique is mainly employed in high-speed graphical applications such as textile printing22 and labelling etc.

2.2.3. Drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printing. 
In DOD inkjet printing generally, two types of actuators are used to create a pulse such as a thermal transducer and a piezoelectric transducer. In a thermal DOD inkjet printer, ink is heated by a heating element located in the ink cavity close to the nozzle. A bubble of vapour is created which drives out an ink droplet.22,41 Since the thermal DOD involves vaporization of a small volume of ink, the material that can be jetted by this method should be relatively volatile or at least have a volatile component. In view of this, a thermal DOD inkjet printer normally uses water as solvent. In piezoelectric DOD inkjet printing, ink droplets are released by mechanical deformation of the piezoelectric transducer under the influence of the electric field. When a certain voltage is applied to the piezoelectric actuator, a pressure wave is formed as a result of volume change.42 When a positive pressure wave approaches the nozzle, ink is pushed outwards, as a result of which a droplet is ejected as shown in Fig. 3. Piezoelectric DOD inkjet printing is normally based on the deformation/fluctuation of the piezoelectric material to cause a sudden change in volume and thus is suitable for a variety of solvents. Therefore, DOD inkjet printing is normally the method of choice, due to its smaller drop size and higher placement accuracy. The droplet size and speed, with which a droplet leaves the print-head, can be regulated in piezoelectric DOD print-heads by varying the driving voltage.42

Based on the principle of DOD inkjet printing, where a small volume of ink is ejected from the nozzle by applying a pressure pulse to the liquid ink in the channel, Chiolerio et al.43 described two different printing techniques. One is the drop-on-position (DOP) technique and another is the print-on-fly (POF) technique. The DOP technique involves the jetting performed drop-wise onto a desired region, where the user has the complete control over the number of drops and the exact location, where the printing has to be done. In contrast, in the POF method, the pattern is printed on the sample in a continuous manner until the set pattern is complete. The major difference between the two methods of printing is that during DOP printing, both the printhead and the stage are stationary at the time of jetting. In contrary, POF involves the movement of the stage continuously with the ejection of the microdroplet at each array element. It was found from studies that the generation of drops is higher in the POF method than in the DOP technique, which leads to different properties/activities of the patterns printed.43


2.2.4. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet printing. 
Although inkjet printing is applied for patterning, its resolution is highly restricted due to its solution based properties. The direct inkjet printing techniques used for printing nanomaterials solutions developed issues such as nozzle clogging, coffee stain effect, unclear edge sharpness, and limitations on minimum line width (typically >50 μm), because the process and features strongly depend on solution properties such as viscosity and surface tension etc.44–46 Also printing processes using micro-volumes of droplets lead to slower working speed, which results in lower throughputs. Thus, EHD jet printing is developed as an alternative to these inkjet printing devices by exploiting different means to generate droplets.47 In thermal and piezoelectric printers, it is difficult to eject liquids from small nozzles due to the extremely high levels of pressure required to overcome the capillary forces.48 In contrast, it is easy to pull the liquids from the nozzle tip by use of an applied electric field.49
For EHD jet printing, an applied voltage/potential is generated between a conducting nozzle and the substrate. A voltage applied to the nozzle tip causes mobile ions in the ink (supplied from a pre-mounted reservoir) to accumulate near the surface at the tip of the nozzle (inner diameter ∼100 nm). The mutual coulombic repulsion between the ions introduces a tangential stress on the liquid surface, which along with the electrostatic attraction to the substrate deforms the meniscus into a conical shape, known as a Taylor cone.47,50 At sufficiently high electric fields, droplets eject from the cone as the electrostatic stresses overcome the surface tension and the ejected drops are typically smaller than the nozzle diameter. Printing is possible even with liquids of low electrical conductivities (10−13 to 10−3 S m−1).51 The simultaneous coordination of the position of the substrate and the ejection of the droplets enables patterned deposition of the ink materials. Three aspects of EHD jet printing allows high resolution operation: (i) inner diameters of the nozzles are smaller than those used in inkjet printing, (ii) electrohydrodynamics generates droplets that can be significantly smaller than this diameter, (iii) focusing due to the distribution of the electric field lines minimizes lateral variations in the droplet placement.48
This technique has been successfully utilized in fabricating many electronic devices47,52 and in biological systems.53 EHD printing is gaining momentum in the past few years as a viable printing technique, especially in the micro- and nano-scale range.54–56 The patterning of wide ranging classes of inks in diverse geometries as well as printed examples of functional circuits and sensors, demonstrating various examples/applications of EHD printing are available47 implying microcapillary nozzles to create devices in the micro-/nano-scale range.


2.2.5. Magnetic printing. 
In earlier days, magnetic printing has been used as an effective method to duplicate digital information, such as servo signals embedded lithographically on a master disk in the form of soft patterns onto recording media.57,58 Magnetic field microgradients established the use of virtual modulators as templates to assemble both non-magnetic and magnetic particles used in many studies.59 These templates with special patterns are made of high-magnetic permeability materials (HMPMs such as iron) and low-magnetic permeability materials (LMPMs, such as aluminum, air and polymer etc.).60,61 When the modulator is placed in a uniform magnetic field, the magnetic indication flux tends to go through HMPMs and bypass LMPMs, thereby leading to a non-uniform magnetic field. Moreover, the magnetic flux density increases above HMPMs and decreases above LMPMs, when the directions of the magnetic indication flux and magnetic field are vertical. Thus, if paramagnetic particles are jetted onto the modulator surface in the magnetic field, the particles would be attracted onto the HMPM regions.62
In the inkjet printing era, it was a prolonged task to do fully magnetic printing of the magnetic fluids to break up into droplets, when the fluids are being pulled from the nozzle by the magnetic field.63 It seems difficult to form droplets of magnetic fluids by applying a magnetic field primarily because magnetic fluids always form a long liquid bridge connecting the drop with the nozzle.64 Therefore, the jetting of the magnetic fluid is considered as an obstacle for the realization of fully magnetic DOD. On the other hand, in contrast to other DOD technologies designed to print droplets only in the gaseous environments, magnetic DOD technologies endorse printing magnetic droplets inside any gaseous or liquid media, which makes the technology attractive.65 Recently, interest in printing magnetic materials was revived by the method to control the alignment of magnetic particles on the target.66 Magnetically patterned samples show significantly increased high frequency permeability along with decreased hysteresis losses as compared to the test samples that were not magnetically aligned.66 In view of this, printing of magnetic materials opens up opportunities in manufacturing magnetic composite materials, inductors, and antennae etc.
Vekselman et al.65 followed the magnetic printing method to print magnetic particles by demonstrating that droplets can be pulled out from the reservoir by the applied magnetic field without any need for a hydrodynamic push or any other mechanical agitation of the liquid surface. Vekselman et al. delivered magnetic fluid drops to a tungsten wire, which was used as the droplet holder. A coil gun made of a copper wire with an iron core was used to generate a non-uniform magnetic field, some distance away from the coil edge. Thus, on its way to the target, the drop is accelerated and breaks the liquid bridge connecting it to the droplet holder. This magnetic printing method designed by Vekselman et al. for DOD generation in air and under water leads to reliable, controllable and predictable generation of drops in various dimensions and composition.65

3. Choice of materials for printing
Many factors in printing processes such as ink properties, jetting stability and thermal treatment, etc. are essential to fabricate suitable coatings/patterns with required line width and conductivity. Many groups have fabricated suitable conductive features considering these factors using numerous precursor inks, including both inorganic NPs67–71 and MOD inks.13,72–74 In this regard, the choice of materials is essential for conducting features. Printable conductors obtained from organics like conductive polymers (PEDOT/PSS),75,76 polyanilines,77 polypyrroles,78 conductive composites (such as polyanilines blended with carbon nanotubes,79 polyanilines blended with graphene80) and conductive carbon pastes81 and hybrids, which constitute a combination of an organic polymer matrix and an inorganic metal nanoparticle filler82 are usually low conductive materials (<3 S cm−1). But, these printable organic conductors are associated with chemical, electrical and thermal instability complications. In contrast, metals acquire high electrical conductivity (∼105 S cm−1) and operational stability. For this reason, many studies have been performed on printing metals such as copper, silver, gold and aluminum. Copper is a good conducting metal (resistivity of copper at 20 °C, 1.72 × 10−8 Ω m), which is cost-effective and acquires good electrical properties.83,84 Although copper is a highly abundant metal, it has limitations for use in printed conductive features, because of its quick/easy oxidation in air and tendency for agglomeration.85,86 Aluminum (2.82 × 10−8 Ω m) is one of the widely used metals, and some studies have been reported on it.87 However, its electrical conductivity is only 60% of the conductivity of copper. Silver (pure silver at 20 °C, 1.59 × 10−8 Ω m) is used as a conductive material due to its high conductivity and resistance to oxidation. Gold is a conductive metal with a bulk resistivity value of 2.44 × 10−8 Ω m. Apart from aluminum and copper, other metals are costly and less abundant. Because of the lowest resistivity among all metals, silver has been most reported, despite its rising costs.
There are various general ways to deposit metals. High temperature/vacuum deposition techniques are costly. Tate et al.88 used electroless plating of silver for micro-contact patterning in order to fabricate TFT electrodes, but this method is complex for a practical purpose. Furthermore, conductive silver pastes show low conductivity even at high annealing temperatures (>200 °C), whereas printed silver NPs show high conductivity at higher temperatures (>300 °C). A similar phenomenon is found with gold. Therefore inkjet printing is superior with respect to not only cost saving but also the quality of the fabricated devices (Table 1).

4. Adhesion between the substrate and printed pattern
In order to obtain a good conducting pattern, adhesion between the pattern and substrate must be good enough for achieving optimum performance and reliability in printed conductors. Adhesion also depends on both morphological and chemical nature of the interface. Modifying the surface of the substrates by means of physical and chemical treatments improves adhesion by transforming the chemical nature of the surface. In this regard, the adhesion of electroplated and sputtered thin films deposited on different substrates was improved with many physical and chemical processes, such as sputtered nickel/chromium or titanium layers and oxygen reactive ion beam irradiation,89 high energy plasma treatment90,91 and silane modification.92,93 In contrast, conductor fabrication by inkjet printing does not require the above reported processes, because the shape and line width of the patterns are controlled by the correlation between the substrate and ink and adhesion promoters can be added directly to the ink to improve the contact.94,95 Jang et al.96 promoted the adhesion of a printed silver pattern on a glass substrate by using a nano-sized glass frit. But this technique has the limitation of thermal treatment for sintering the pattern, because the high temperature used for sintering is sufficient enough to melt the glass frit during sintering. The poor adhesion of copper electrodes to substrates like glass makes it inconvenient for application in electronic devices. In view of this, adhesion promoters are added to inks and pastes for high throughput processing without introduction of additional adhesion layers. Accordingly, Choi et al.97 fabricated copper electrodes by printing copper formate precursor ink on a glass substrate. Ethyl cellulose dissolved in 1-methyl 2-pyrrolidone was added as an adhesive agent to improve the adhesion of copper electrode coating to the glass substrate. Lee et al.98 enhanced the adhesion of the copper patterns by adding a silane coupling agent as an adhesion promoter to the copper precursor ink. Silane coupling agents possess two types of reactivity which are both inorganic and organic in nature in the same molecule. Thus, they are capable of providing a hybrid link between organic and inorganic materials, thereby improving the adhesion. A substrate with high temperature resistance and good mechanical strength like polyimide possesses poor adhesion with copper due to minimum interfacial reactivity. In this regard, silane coupling agents upon mixing directly with synthesized copper ink increase the adhesion between the two. Fig. 4 represents the inkjet printed rectangular form of a copper pattern (3 × 8) cm2 on a polyimide substrate using copper complex ion ink with 1 wt% 3-amino propyl trimethoxy silane (APS) and a complex line with a pattern width of 100 μm.98 The patterns formed from copper complex ion ink with APS reduced to highly conductive copper patterns, which adhered well to the polyimide substrate at an annealing temperature of 200 °C (Fig. 4). Although an increase in APS content degraded the film resistivity, the adhesive strength was found to improve up to an optimum 3 wt% of APS.98

5. Thermal sintering processes after printing
One of the general problems is that the materials do not conduct after printing. For attaining conductivity, they require sintering. Sintering processes transform the printed metallic precursor ink into an electrically conductive structure. In the case of metal–organic decomposition (MOD) ink, heat is used to precipitate the metal followed by burn off of the organic components. In the case of NPs, heat decomposes the organic stabilizer in NP inks, thus leaving the bare NP to form a conductive feature. The high temperature applied during conventional sintering processes is not compatible with all the substrates needed for flexible electronics. The sintering temperature of the printed ink must be determined on the basis of thermal stability of different substrates. A glass panel is used as a substrate for display applications, so the sintering temperature must not be more than 400 °C. Polymer based substrates are used in printed circuit board (PCB) applications and the sintering temperature must be less than the glass transition temperature of the substrate (<300 °C).99 High performance polymer substrates like polyimide can resist high temperature thermal sintering. Polymer substrates like PET and PEN possess low glass transition temperatures below 150 °C and can be destroyed at high temperatures. Similar things happen while using plane paper as the substrate. The sintering temperature must also be set at a low value in order to control the dimensional instability of the substrate because of its thermal expansion and contraction. Thus, the type of ink and its formulation depends strongly on the type of substrate onto which the material is deposited.
5.1. Printing metal–organics with subsequent sintering
Metal–organic compounds dissolve in organic solvents such as toluene, ethanol or butanol etc. to form conductive inks. In general, inks consist of metal–organic compounds with one or multiple reacting agents responsible for the decomposition and conversion of the compound. The use of metal–organic inks does not have the risk of agglomeration and nozzle clogging issues during printing. After deposition, annealing/heating is required in order to decompose the metal–organic compound. In this process, gaseous by-products leave the system after decomposition, which leads to metallic films/patterns. Inks of this kind are attractive due to their simple formulation and achievable conductivities. However, the resulting patterns/films are often chemically impure which may cause deterioration of other adjacent materials. Although metal–organic compounds decompose at relatively low temperatures of ∼150–200 °C100 and have better ability of curing due to the absence of surfactants,101 the metallic solid content is generally restricted by both the solubility of the organometallic compound in a solvent and the molecular fraction of the metal in the compound itself. In addition, metal–organic inks are usually associated with low viscosity and mass loading, which results in films/patterns which are often too thin or mechanically unstable. Lee et al.86 synthesized AlH3[O(C4H9)2] as a metal–organic precursor to produce aluminum features of less than ∼60 nm thickness on flexible substrates such as paper at 110 °C and the measured sheet resistance was less than 2 Ω cm−2. Among different paper substrates, inkjet printing paper was found to be suitable with high and stable electrical conductivity under repeated bending, due to its unique fibrous structure. Thus, the solution based process involving aluminum precursor ink is suitable for producing aluminum features with excellent electrical and mechanical properties on paper substrates for low cost flexible electronics such as electrical circuit boards and RFID tags for single use disposable products and electrodes for energy conversion and storage devices. Lee et al.102 prepared copper ink by mixing copper(II) neodecanoate and copper hydroxide nanopowder for screen printing onto a glass substrate. The copper coatings/patterns made from copper(II) neodecanoate display good sintering and low resistivity. Since the low metal content of the copper neodecanoate ink leads to the formation of a thin copper film after annealing, its conductivity is decreased. The low viscosity of the ink also causes complications in the printing process. Therefore, synthesized nanopowder Cu(OH)2 is added to copper(II) neodecanoate, to improve the metal content and viscosity, which is suitable for printing.102 Magdassi et al. synthesized a chemically stable and low viscous metal organic copper complex based ink which is suitable for inkjet printing of conductive patterns on plastic substrates.103 The ink consists in hydrous copper formate complexed with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (CuF–AMP), which undergoes pyrolysis to generate copper metallic patterns at low temperatures, enabling printing on heat sensitive plastic substrates such as PET and PEN, because of its low decomposition temperature. After printing, heating at a temperature of 140 °C leads to the formation of large and connected copper grains, thereby yielding a resistivity of 10.5 μΩ cm (conductivity of ∼16% of bulk copper). Decomposition of CuF–AMP leads to the formation of copper metal, due to the reducing counter ion in the complex (formate). The self-reduction reaction by the formate leads to the release of hydrogen gas, which contributes to the reducing atmosphere, thereby preventing the oxidation of formed copper. Furthermore, Magdassi et al. found that among other ligands, AMP is suitable, because of the decrease in the decomposition temperature and the achievement of the best conductivity using the complex.103 The presence of tertiary carbon in the AMP ligand contributes to the formation of small volatile by-products, unlike other amino hydroxyl ligands, which enable reactions between the formed carbon dioxide and other organic by-products.103 Chun et al.104 prepared silver metal–organic precursors using a mixture of silver(I) oxide particles and silver salt of tertiary fatty acids (silver neoalkanoates) in α-terpineol to produce silver conducting patterns on flexible polymer substrates by sintering at a temperature of 150 °C. They optimized the range of linear chain length of silver neoalkanoates to be 5–9 in the formation of pastes. Silver patterns were produced from the pastes using R2R printing on a PET substrate and thermally cured at 150 °C for 30 min. The conductivity of the silver pattern was found to depend on the linear chain length of the used silver neoalkanoates.104 For a chain length of 9, the conductivity was found to be ∼4.0 × 104 S cm−1 (bulk silver: ∼6.3 × 105 S cm−1). Schubert et al.101 printed silver tracks onto glass slides using a silver salt solution containing 20 wt% of silver in methanol/anisole (Ink Tec, Korea) and then sintered at different times and temperatures as shown in Fig. 5. The inset of the figure represents a three-dimensional feature of a printed and non-sintered single line of silver. A significantly low value of resistivity was obtained when the sample was heated to 130 °C and above. The resistivity reduced to 6.8 μΩ cm at 130 °C after 60 min, which is almost four times the value of bulk silver (1.59 μΩ cm). The sintering time was found to influence the resistivity. Although the sintering time has less effect on the final resistivity at a temperature of 150 °C, the resistivity was found to be 4.7–8.0 μΩ cm after 5 minutes, which is three-five times the resistivity of bulk silver. Schubert et al.101 found that the sintering mechanism at low temperature does not match with that at high temperature. The solvent evaporation plays a major role at low temperatures, which causes precipitation of the silver salt without its decomposition. Solvent evaporation is stimulated at higher temperatures to prevent line bleeding. The printed samples persisted for 5 min at higher temperatures, leading to a resistivity of nearly eight times the bulk silver value. Longer prevailing times or higher temperatures resulted in lower resistivity of three times the bulk silver value, though these temperatures are not suitable for use in common polymer foils with a fairly low glass transition temperature.

Dearden et al.100 formulated silver-organic inks using silver neodecanoate in xylene. The rate of mass loss was found to be rapid above 150 °C, as studied from thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The as-printed tracks on glass substrates were treated at different curing temperatures of 125–200 °C. Excellent conductivity values were obtained at curing temperatures greater than 140 °C, which were in the range of 3.0–4.8 × 10−8 Ω m (2 to 3 times the resistivity of bulk silver: 1.6 × 10−8 Ω m).100 Chang et al.105 synthesized silver-organic conductive ink using a cost effective approach. Silver carbonate was used as the silver precursor, glycol as the solvent and reducing agent, isopropyl amine (NH2C3H7) as the ligand to form a dissoluble complex [Ag2(CO3)(NH2C3H7)4]. Upon sintering, the formed dissoluble complex decomposed to Ag2O first and then reduced to silver by glycol. The results of the sintering mechanism indicated that silver oxide plays an important role in the reduction process rather than free silver ions, a fact that has been observed for copper printing as stated above from the work of Lee et al.102 The lowest resistivity was found to be 4.4 μΩ cm upon annealing at 320 °C. Chen et al.106 developed conductive silver thin films by inkjet printing on PET sheets at lower sintering temperature directly using Ag2O in ammonium hydroxide solution. The resistivity of the printed silver films as calculated from the resistance and cross sectional area of the printed tracks was found to be 6 μΩ cm (∼4 times of pure silver). This silver ink is also useful in printing conductive tracks for many applications such as printed circuit boards, micro-electromechanical systems and RFID tags.
Lang et al. reported a liquid gold precursor [Au(O2CCH2(OCH2CH2)2OCH3)(nBu3P)] for jet printing gold.107 After thermal decomposition at 280 °C in the absence of light using toluene as a solvent at 25 °C, the resulting printed features exhibit a conductivity of 1.9 × 107 S m−1 on glass (∼43% of bulk gold). In some reports, metal–organic inks show superior conductivity compared to NP inks as ligand free formation of the NPs occurs in situ on the substrate.42,100 In contrast to MOD the suspension of NPs requires addition of a surfactant to prevent the particles from agglomerating in the ink. After printing ink, the surfactant needs to be detached and the particles need sintering.
5.2. Printing NP inks
The need for using capping agents to coat the surface of NPs is related to their thermodynamic instability. Therefore, these ligands are essential for the synthesis of NPs though they are insignificant in electrical contact or conductive patterns. These capping molecules have to be eliminated to obtain good conductivity.108 The components of the metal NP ink must be tuned to attain the anticipated resolution, adhesion and electronic properties of the conducting patterns. How to make colloidal NPs is reviewed in a large number of reviews and is not within the scope of this review.109–111 Numerous components such as binders, dispersants and adhesion promoters are incorporated into the ink, based on the quality of the precursors and the specific purpose for which the feature/pattern is required.112 However, stability of the colloids is one of the issues, which affects the printing process and roughness of the patterns due to particle agglomeration or crystallization, and also the probability of mismatch with the expected material.108 This leads to imperfect contact behavior in conducting patterns. In addition, NP inks contain isolated particles encapsulated with a surfactant and are dissolved in an organic solvent or water. The function of this surfactant involves prevention of particle agglomeration and improvement of the solubility in the used solvent etc.108 Normally, all the encapsulant materials are not eliminated during sintering, which leads to imperfect contact between the particles.

5.2.1. The effects of thermal sintering. 
Generally, small particles are better than large particles, because the suspensions composed of small particles withstand sedimentation and nozzle clogging. Particles smaller than 1/10 to 1/50 of the nozzle diameter are preferred for avoiding the blockage. Unlike microparticles, NPs do not clog a typical 30 μm inkjet orifice, which facilitates the production of high-resolution components. Another advantage is that because of the small particle size, the high surface to volume ratio causes the lowering of the sintering temperature. This has been investigated in an early work by Buffat et al.113 on examining melting points of gold NPs, who observed that below 5.0 nm (50 Å), the melting temperature of a particle drops continuously as shown in Fig. 6. Because of small sizes, the NPs may exhibit melting temperatures of about 700 °C below their bulk counterpart.113 The lowering in melting point is due to the high surface area to volume ratio, which allows soldering between neighbouring NPs at a relatively low temperature. While gold for example exhibits a melting point of 1064 °C for the bulk material, NPs as small as 3 nm which have approximately as many atoms at the surface as in the bulk have a melting point of about 250 °C (neglecting ligand effects). Therefore, NPs can be sintered at temperatures of about 300 °C to form a material that is almost indistinguishable from the bulk. The drawback is that the amount of stabilizing organic ligands of the NPs in comparison to the metal content is rising with decreasing particle size thus possibly increasing the carbon content after sintering.114 However, one may design the ink by considering the adsorption energy of the stabilizing ligand at the NP metal surface and the decomposition temperature of the organic ligand molecule itself. Choosing ligands with relatively low desorption/decomposition temperatures are particularly advantageous for applications needing low sintering temperatures as subsequent Ostwald-ripening type agglomeration processes may occur as driving forces after ligand desorption. Thus, the interaction with the metal core must be strong enough to avoid agglomeration within the ink before printing, but on the other hand may be weak enough so that the ligand desorbs or decomposes below the sintering temperature. A chemical way to modify ligands will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.2. Therefore, a compromise has to be found depending on the application.

Taking all these factors into consideration, extensive work is done by many groups for development of NP inks with achievable electrical properties, oxidation resistance and low sintering temperatures, etc. for printable electrical conductors. It is noted that several silver NP inks are available in the market commercially suitable in some cases for sintering even at plastic compatible temperatures. Conductivities obtained after sintering those inks are even higher than 50% of bulk silver depending on the temperature resistivity of the substrates.115 Both Fuller et al. and Yeates et al. separately sintered inks based on silver NPs of ∼5–50 nm in size to form coatings of high electrical conductivity at temperatures of 150 °C, on polymer substrates.116,117 According to Fuller et al.,116 printed silver was found to have a resistivity value of ∼3 μΩ cm upon sintering, which is approximately twice the resistivity of bulk silver (1.6 μΩ cm). Jung et al.99 used commercially available inks with silver content of 20 wt% (size of NPs: 30–50 nm) and 60 wt% (size of NPs: 5–10 nm) for patterning silver. The printed patterns were sintered at 150 to 250 °C for different time intervals. The maximum resistivity obtained at 250 °C is 4.2 μΩ cm, which is about 2.6 times the resistivity of bulk silver. Metal NPs like gold and copper have also been successfully printed in this way.118 Wu et al.119 used alkanethiol stabilized precursors for fabricating electrical conducting gold features for thin film transistors on modified SiO2 substrates. Thermal annealing was performed at a relatively low temperature of about 140–200 °C after printing, for transforming the insulating gold NP features to electrically conducting gold elements. The conductivity of the printed conducting features was comparable to those obtained by vacuum evaporation or bulk gold conductivity (105 S cm−1). The mild annealing conditions facilitate this method for applications in printed transistor circuits, especially on plastic substrates for flexible electronics. However, the formulation and printing procedure of thiol-stabilized silver or gold NPs in organic solvent is not environment friendly and not used on the large scale by commercial printers.
Conductive inks in which solvent cures to form a binder without evaporation gives low conductivity values. Sometimes this is desirable; one example is the use of carbon nanotubes in polymer matrices for in situ fabrication of electrical resistors.120 Generally speaking, lowering the sintering temperature maximizes the range of possible substrates for use in printing. Even printing on paper becomes possible as demonstrated in Fig. 7.184 It is noted that a color change after sintering is related to the fact that gold NPs exhibit different colors than the sintered bulk material.

Dodecanethiol-protected gold NPs were synthesized and dispersed in xylene for inkjet printing. IR sintering for 10–15 s changed the color of the printed electrodes to golden and the patterns became conductive. Optically the most homogeneous surface was achieved with the intermediate drop spacing value of 30 μm. Reprinted with permission from ref. 184, Copyright 2012, the American Chemical Society.184 
One of the drawbacks of printing NPs is, according to Jung et al.,121 the high surface area to volume ratio which leads to particle agglomeration and trapping gases on the surface and thus hinders printing of metal NP based ink on flexible substrates. In addition, at low temperature and moderate pressure, elimination of void between NPs by sintering is very impractical. Therefore, directly printing NPs/microparticles results in porous structures, which lowers the conductivity and mechanical stability compared to electrochemical and physical vapor deposited patterns. This is shown in Fig. 8 exhibiting a systematic study by Wolf et al.8 Wolf et al. used Agfa-Gevaert N. V. (Motsel, Belgium) ink containing 14–17 wt% of silver NPs of 20–30 nm size and jet printed on a glass substrate at room temperature. The lowest resistivity of 4.0 × 10−8 Ω m was achieved by thermal sintering for 15 min at 200 °C, which is 40% of the conductivity of bulk silver. The top view cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the printed lines at different times and sintering temperatures were analysed (Fig. 8). It was observed that at 100 °C, the NPs are densified. At a sintering temperature of 150 °C, neck formation among the NPs is observed. At 200 °C, porous structures appear, which confirm the low resistivity value after 60 min of sintering, but the large pores limit the final conductivity to smaller values (40%) than that of bulk silver. From the microscopic images it can be seen that more elevated sintering temperatures and longer times reduce the amount of grain boundaries within the obtained material, but produce larger pores (Fig. 8).

In view of this, Lee et al. printed patterns on flexible substrates using silver nanoplatelet based ink without surfactants for particle dispersion.122 The nanoplatelet based patterns sintered at 200 °C showed a resistivity of 7.4 μΩ cm (bulk silver: 1.59 μΩ cm), which is much less than the resistivity of NP based patterns (30 μΩ cm). Therefore, the electrical resistivity is functionally related to the microstructure pattern, because the nanoplatelets allow a percolation path for electricity after sintering, thus attaining better conductivity. According to Lee et al.,122 nanoplatelet conductive patterns are also stable against external repetitive bending stress, because of their resistance to cracking compared to NP based patterns. This improvement in electrical resistivity and mechanical stability is attributed to the dense microstructure of the nanoplatelet based conductive materials.
How to empirically proceed in order to find the appropriate formulation of a NP ink for a specific substrate is best described with the following practical example. Salmeron et al.7 characterized the size of different silver patterns printed by inkjet and screen printing for RFID antennas on PET, PI and PEI substrates as shown in Fig. 9. DGP ink (commercial) on PEI substrates resulted in a minimum DC resistivity value of 8.6 ± 0.8 μΩ cm, compared to the other specimens analyzed.

The best performance in terms of resolution and thickness per single layer was provided by Sun Tronic Ink (commercial) on PEI substrate, for which the DC resistivity was 24.4 ± 1.1 μΩ cm. A higher resistivity was obtained for thinner patterns because of the dominant contribution of grain boundary scattering. For screen printing, the minimum resistivity was 39 ± 4 μΩ cm on PI and PET substrates. Inkjet and screen printed co-planer waveguides were fabricated to study the RF performance of different printed lines. Salmeron et al. also correlated the geometrical characteristics with the measured DC electrical conductivity for designing coplanar waveguide transmission lines to evaluate and compare the RF performances of different studies.7 A comparison of results revealed that RF loss behavior was similar for inkjet and screen printed transmission lines; PEI is the best substrate followed by PI and PET. Based on these optimum results, high frequency inductors were manufactured for their use in RFID tags.
Ramella et al. demonstrated inkjet printed silver NP microstrip lines on an alumina substrate, using commercial conductive polymer based nanocomposite ink featuring an organic matrix and silver NPs for RF power modules.123 Among the two types of inks selected/used for printing of silver NP, the polymer based nanocomposite ink was found to be suitable because of its better conductivity and performance due to the presence of the polymeric network. After sintering at a rather low temperature of 300 °C for 30 min, this produces a polymer matrix nanocomposite track; with conductivity suitable for RF and microwave low Q-applications. For designing the power module, a suitable microstrip line model was fitted considering the metal thickness, conductivity, roughness, substrate thickness, dielectric permittivity and conductor loss as parameters. The values obtained from the fitting of measured data indicate that not only is the average conductivity much lower than that of bulk silver, but additional dielectric losses also arise, which is related to the composite nature of the sintered conductor. In order to test the feasibility and repeatability of complex geometries (as a line-stub-line junction) and to validate the microstrip model, a first text structure consisting of a 50 Ω matched low-pass filter with line-stub topology was realized and further measurements showed that the simulations were in good agreement with the measurements and thus satisfactory repeatability in results was obtained. For the inclusion of lumped components (such as capacitors and resistors) in the inkjet printed tracks, lead solder paste (m.p. ∼170 °C) was used. Finally, the suitability of the printed silver lines to the realization of RF active circuits was demonstrated by design, fabrication and characterization of a wide-band RF power amplifier (0.7–1 GHz). It was found from measurements and testing that the power behavior of the module confirmed the capability of the printed silver lines to handle the signals with power level up to a few watts. The promising results obtained from the preliminary test structures together with the encouraging performances exhibited by the power amplifier indicate the potential of the presented technology for both low- and medium-power applications at RF and pave the way to higher frequency (microwave) applications.123


5.2.2. Chemically assisted sintering. 
Some of the ligands capping the NP contain carboxyl,124–126 alcohol127 or amine132 end groups which are responsible for chemical adsorption onto the surface of the NPs. Capping ligand modification may comprise reduction, addition and/or exchange of ligands. With this the sintering temperature of NPs can be reduced by adding appropriate chemical agents and may even enable the contact among NPs despite the capping layer.129,130,199 Many groups have worked on percolation transformation and studied the relationship between the curing temperature and the loss of ligands.25,33,128 Kim et al.131 and Jung et al.132 compared the adsorption energy of different ligands utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and predicted the reaction pathway of ligand modification. Jung et al. synthesized ligand-reduced silver NPs by acetic acid immersion treatment and observed superior electrical performance at a low temperature of 100–150 °C as shown in Fig. 10.132 The acetic acid immersion treatment leads to ligand reduction as well as ligand exchange from the originally used thermally stable ligand oleyl amine (OA) (boiling point: ∼350 °C) to the acetate ion, a less stable ion with a shorter chain, as confirmed from FTIR and XPS analyses. Therefore, the thermal elimination of the ligand occurs easily in the ligand-reduced and ligand-exchanged silver NPs. Thus, ligand exchange as a result of acetic acid immersion treatment reduces the curing time and temperature, which leads to improvement in electrical properties. The ligand exchange was also elucidated by the difference in adsorption energy of the two ligands, as determined from the DFT calculation. Thus, Jung et al.132 reported the improvement in electrical properties by ligand modification and the use of ligand-reduced silver ink pertaining to the curing temperature, which is relevant to plastic substrates.

Magdassi et al. explained several chemical sintering methods occurring under ambient conditions by inclusion of sintering agents, such as the cationic polymer or an electrolyte solution with a view to bring about the desorption of the stabilizing compound including spontaneous coalescence of silver NPs.136,137 Later, Magdassi et al. followed a cost effective double printing method for achieving high conductivity.138 In order to attain high conductivity of plastic electronics, Magdassi et al. followed an approach by combining a sequential printing and chemical sintering process and obtained a pattern with a conductivity value of 31% of bulk silver, by heating the PET substrate at a low temperature of 60 °C. They printed layers of silver NPs and on top of it layers of sodium chloride (NaCl) ink, by altering the numbers of each layer (Fig. 11). The mechanism is explained by the fact that when a smaller moiety of chloride ions replaces the elongated polymer on the surface of the particles, it diminishes the electrostatic repulsion between the particles. Thus, it facilitates the close contact, which leads to the formation of necks due to the attractive forces between the NPs.136,139 It is found that, the sequential printing of NaCl ink enhances adhesion to the PET substrate. The lowest resistivity (∼2.5 times of bulk silver) was achieved at 4 and 5 layers of silver NPs with an equal number of layers of the sintering agent. This finding by Magdassi et al.138 is very useful for printing plastic and paper devices such as flexible solar cells and electroluminescent devices.

Polavarapu et al.133 fabricated conductive silver patterns by inkjet printing on PET substrates at room temperature under mild annealing conditions (50 °C). They reduced silver nitrate with sodium borohydride in the presence of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizer in formulating silver NP ink. The NPs prepared by Polavarapu et al.133 were capped with PVP through co-ordination with the nitrogen atom. PVP binds weakly to the surface of the silver NPs due to the steric effect, compared to other ligands such as primary amines. The weakly adsorbed PVP desorbs quickly from the surface of the NPs and collapses after solvent evaporation. The silver NPs form conductive films on plastic substrates because of self-aggregation. The conductive films fabricated on PET substrates are highly flexible and very small changes in the conductivity are observed by deformation of the substrate. The low conductivity (∼0.7 × 105 S cm−1, which is ∼9 times lower than that of bulk silver, ∼6.3 × 105 S cm−1) obtained by this solution processed method is expected to be due to the presence of void space in the silver film which is formed during self-aggregation of the silver NPs, which have potential applications in low-cost printable solar cells and flexible plastic electronics.
A similar approach was also used by Cui et al.,135 who produced conductive patterns using water based gold NP ink. The well dispersed NP ink was formulated using concentrated gold colloids, which were protected by two overlapped adsorbed layers of PVP and acrylic resin for use in commercial printer ink due to its low viscosity. The printed ink was annealed at 500 °C to eliminate the organic additives. The measured conductivity of the 50-layer printed and sintered metallic micropattern (8.0 × 104 S cm−1) is similar to the value of bulk gold (1.0 × 105 S cm−1). In this method, the density of metal NPs and conductivity of the patterns are controlled by the number of printing layers and the sintering conditions.
Adding an extra ligand to the precursor may lead to the removal of the original ligand from the precursor compound. Ligand exchange reactions on metal NPs have been studied for example through the removal of the original ligands via the self-assembly of thiols.140,141 A silver film prepared by Anto et al.134 using thiol capped silver NP ink behaved like an insulator after solvent evaporation and the film was conductive after annealing at 200 °C. However, as mentioned above, thiol has toxicity issues such as stated above.

5.3. Plasma and photonic sintering methods
As the drawback of thermal sintering is mainly based on the thermal stability of the substrate, there are also sintering methods of interest which do not involve bulk heating. Further alternative sintering methods developed by other groups83 include particle bombardment (i.e. plasmas),142 radiative methods such as microwave radiation,143,146 focused laser beam143–145,149 and light flashing147 as well as electrical sintering.148
In plasma sintering processes, a plasma inherent excited species is used to eliminate the stabilizing agents from the particles. In contrast, low pressure plasma (1 mbar) sintering processes involve positioning/placing the printed structure in a vacuum plasma chamber, which is purged with argon.142 Excited species like ions and radicals and UV irradiation generated on the plasma chamber start chain reactions which lead to decomposition of the stabilizing agents, thereby facilitate the direct contact of the metal particles with each other. Because of the energy delivered by the excited species, grain boundary diffusion and densification occur, producing a dense network of the conducting material.142 Magdassi et al. followed an approach by applying non-thermal plasma treatment to printed patterns of CuF–AMP complex on heat-sensitive plastic substrates such as PEN to form metallic copper without heating at high temperatures.150 By exposing the printed CuF–AMP complex ink to 160 W plasma for 8 min yielded a resistivity value of 7.3 ± 0.2 μΩ cm, which corresponds to 23% of bulk copper conductivity. Thus, it was inferred that plasma treatment results in decomposition of the metal–organic ink without heating at high temperature.150 One example of the influence of plasma power and sintering time on the resistivity is given in Fig. 12, which includes scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the microscopic structures obtained for two different sintering times.8

Bromberg et al. printed silver lines on a glass substrate using silver nitrate ink.151 A conductive layer of silver was obtained upon plasma treatment with a resistivity lower than that of bulk silver. The lines treated at 900 W for 5 minutes yielded a resistivity of 1.7 × 108 Ω m. This is a relevant technique for rapid and low cost fabrication of metallic conducting patterns of electronic circuits for use in electronic devices. Wolf et al. used rapid low-pressure plasma sintering of the jet printed silver NPs over PET substrates and found a conductivity value of ∼40% of bulk silver.8 After manufacturing the antenna structure by both inkjet and screen printing, the functionality of the RFID antennas was found to be quite good upon testing. Since the inkjet printed samples were substantially thinner than the screen printed samples and generated adequate conductivity for the RFID tags, it was inferred that inkjet printing has a great preference over screen printing.
Microwave sintering is a rapid flash sintering method by exposing the printed features to microwave radiation of 1 W with a frequency of 13.56 MHz for a time of 1 s, which requires less initial conductivity.152 Flash microwave sintering depends on the total area of the pattern to be sintered, the pre-curing time and the geometry of the line.152 The presence of initial conductivity unambiguously promotes NP sintering in the pre-cured ink lines.
Sintering using focused laser beam involves exposing the printed tracks to the focused beam of light at a tuned wavelength, which can be adjusted to the required absorption of the ink. Numerous lasers covering the whole range of infrared to ultraviolet are available for sintering etc.145,153–156 Chiolerio et al. jet printed silver tracks on a Kapton substrate and sintered with a low cost low power diode pumped solid state laser system with a maximum pumping power of 45 W at a wavelength of 808 nm.145 The laser annealing process was attained by fixing the laser beam at a dimension of 52 μm and increasing the power density up to 2.83 kW cm−2 and silver lines were formed without any damage to the kapton substrate.
Recent work focuses on very fast sintering methods, such as photonic sintering for implementation of roll-to-roll (R2R) production,157 which utilizes intense pulsed light and rapid electrical sintering by the application of DC current.148 Wang et al. fabricated copper patterns by inkjet printing on a polyimide substrate, which were sintered using intensive pulsed light as a function of pulsed light energy.158 Superb electrical properties with resistivity values in the range of 3.21 to 5.27 μΩ cm were obtained at pulsed light energy in the range of 40 to 60 J cm−2.
Araki et al. synthesized copper complex precursor ink and printed copper lines on a glass substrate.159 They followed photonic sintering using high intensity pulsed light using a Pulse Forge 3300 (Novacentrix Corp.) in ambient air without precursor drying. The pulsed light is set at 230 V with 1400 μs exposure time, resulting in an irradiation energy of 2.69 J cm−2. The carbon content in the ink affected the sintering conditions and wire properties after photonic sintering. Large amounts of carbon damaged the wire surfaces and disrupted the conductive path of the wire lines by carbon evaporation in the photo-sintering process. The resistivity of the copper wires formed was found to be 5.6 × 10−5 Ω cm. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the carbon content from the ink, while printing several features.
Chung et al. formulated gold ink using 2–4 nm sized gold NPs in toluene and printed fine lines on a glass substrate.149 Using laser beam radiation for sintering, the gold NPs are fully melted to form a pore-less layer. The resulting resistance per length is calculated to be 1.26–1.52 Ω mm−1.
A nice practical application is demonstrated by Hösel et al.160 Printing electrodes directly on the barrier foil to avoid indium tin oxide (ITO) on a thicker PET substrate with its vacuum based production can significantly reduce the energy consumption and time in photovoltaic devices. In order to overcome this, Hösel et al.160 used high throughput R2R flexo printing of silver NP inks to form full layer electrodes directly on a thin barrier foil. Photonic sintering of the printed layers was performed with an additional R2R Xenon flash lamp system and significant improvement in conductivity was achieved.
6. Inkjet printing combined with electroless deposition
Non-noble metal NPs such as copper is oxidized significantly in air, whereas inert metals like gold remain unaffected.14,161,162 Therefore, inert or reducing atmospheres are utilized to minimize or avoid the oxidation of such non-noble metals. Thus, processes that avoid the inert gas thermal treatments are preferably followed for manufacturing on the large scale. In this regard, there is an approach for a non-conductive and chemically active deposit (such as a catalyst or reducing agent), which is based on secondary treatment in a low temperature electroless plating bath, for depositing non-noble metals like copper or nickel. The printing process leads to the formation of a template for the subsequent plating process bath and determines the area to be coated. This method achieves good conductivity at low processing temperature, which finds utility in many applications. Also, a combination of electroless plating with a dual channel drop-on-demand method has been applied for both metal salt inks and NPs.
Zhang et al. fabricated high resolution copper patterns with good conductivity using jet printing followed by the electroless deposition technique.2 A stabilized palladium solution in water–glycerol as the catalyst was printed on photopaper followed by electroless deposition of copper metal on it, leading to strong copper adhesion. The conductivity of the copper pattern was found to be 3.9 × 107 S m−1 (65% of bulk copper). The high conductivity is due to the abundance of metal ions in the electroless copper plating bath, generating a dense uniform copper layer (∼350 nm) with good conductivity. Various deformation tests such as inward or outward bending showed little impact on the conductivity of the copper pattern. Zhang et al. manufactured flexible integrated circuits utilizing his own method as shown in Fig. 13.2 Cook et al. demonstrated the same process for developing copper-based passive microwave components on flexible recyclable (Teslin) paper.165 They printed a homogeneous solution of palladium(II) chloride catalyst onto the Teslin paper followed by copper electroless deposition to form copper films with the inkjet derived pattern.165 The resulting copper films acquired the required thicknesses and sheet resistances. Teslin paper was used as a substrate to design a 2.4 GHz monopole antenna to analyse the microwave performance of the patterned copper films.
 Fig. 13  Here, copper patterns were inkjetted on photopaper using a stabilized palladium(II) solution in water–glycerol, which enables strong chemical bond between the quaternary ammonium groups on the photopaper and the palladium ions, leading to strong copper adhesion. (a) Microscope images of the final copper patterns inkjetted on photopaper using a stabilized palladium(II) solution in water–glycerol of the highest resolution (left) and inductive micro-coil (right).

It was found that the antennas generated using both the electroless deposition of copper and jet printing of silver NP ink showed similar performances obtained from the measurements of insertion losses and radiation patterns. This copper patterning process is a suitable approach for other flexible, low temperature substrates, which can be used to fabricate a variety of patterned RF devices. Liao et al. fabricated copper films on plastic sheets (PET or PI) following this method.164 They printed silver nitrate ink on PET or PI sheets as an activating agent. The printed samples were subjected to electroless plating to create highly conductive copper thin films on printed patterns. The conductivity of the fabricated copper thin films were found to be 83% of bulk copper and attained good adhesion on PET or PI substrates.
Besides homogeneous metal salts NPs may also act as catalysts for the electroless deposition step. One example is printing of silver NP ink as a seed layer, followed by electroless plating of nickel.163 Instead of a catalyst, reducing agents can also be printed followed by the metal salt for plating or vice versa. Metal formation occurs in situ because of the redox reaction between the reducing agent and the metal salt. This method was implemented by Bidoki et al. to form silver conductive patterns by printing ascorbic acid followed by silver nitrate solution.166
Kao et al. followed a dual drop on demand method to print patterns on a glass substrate using formaldehyde and silver ammonia solution by inkjet printing.167 After cleaning and drying at room temperature and then in a vacuum oven at 150 °C, the resistivity of the printed lines was enhanced to 12 μΩ cm (7.5 times of bulk silver).
7. Printing on stretchable conductors by inkjet printing
Ideal stretchable conductors are associated with high electrical conductivity, which pattern easily to the elastomer surface and are robust to large mechanical stretch. Robinson et al. proposed a comprehensive method for forming a network of microcracks in a uniform and conducting film on silicone in order to produce highly elastic films of electronic device materials.168 They printed silver and gold metallic inks onto a hydrophobic silicone substrate. The printed conductors attained a high conductivity value of 11000 S cm−1 and resisted large cyclic mechanical deformation. This method is applicable in stretchable interconnects for stretchable circuits, compliant electrodes in transistors and tunable antennas etc. For such applications the properties of the stretchable support are crucial. Not only is its elasticity important, but its microsurface structure as well in order to obtain defined microcrack densities.
Hildreth et al. demonstrated a process to connect separate chips by printing free-standing stretchable interconnects based on newer spiral designs.169 They synthesized silver ink by dissolving silver acetate in ammonium hydroxide followed by addition of drops of formic acid with stirring. The spiral was printed using a DOD printer with 500 passes of 10:1 EtOH:Ag ink to ensure adequate mechanical strength. Spiral interconnects were fabricated spanning 10 mm and cycled 1000 times to stretch ratios of 160 and 180% with less than 2.5% variation in measured resistance. Thirty layers of triangular pads were printed at the interface between the copper bonding pads and the spiral to increase its robustness at this critical interface. The sheet resistance of the printed (7 × 7) mm2 sample with 10 layers was found to be 5.8 mΩ mm−2 with a thickness of 3.4 μm. The stretchability of the electrical interconnect was tested by mounting the sample on a mechanical strainer and measuring the electrical resistance with a digital multimeter. The elongation was cyclic from 0 to 140 or 160% and then back to 0% with an elongation/shortening rate of ∼16 mm s−1. The resistance variation was less than 2.5% for both tests of 1000 cycles. These results show that the spiral stretchable electrical interconnect has little or no degradation in electrical properties after thousands of cycles at large stretch ratios. These printed stretchable interconnects can be used to connect different types of functional units, which are on isolated islands, such as CPU, memory, A/D converter, regulator and Bluetooth devices.169
Furthermore, one of the crucial points to obtain high quality products is to minimize the change in resistance of the stretchable conductors under external applied stress for better electrical operations. An ideal surface for systematic studies on these points is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). It is associated with low modulus, high elastic behavior up to large strains and high physical toughness. Of specific interest is its tailorable surface chemistry which makes PDMS distinct from other substrates for use in stretchable electronics. Jeong et al. deposited a stretchable, low resistive silver electrode on a roughened PDMS substrate and analyzed the surface crack evolution under tensile stress.172 From simulation, Jeong et al. found that film stress can be reduced drastically because of the large steps created by the surface roughness developed in the PDMS substrate during deposition.
In view of this, the development in stretching characteristics of the electrode was elucidated by monitoring changes in the stress distribution when surface roughness is introduced on the PDMS substrate. Jeong et al. concluded that the rough surface plays two prominent roles.172 It releases the film stress of the thick silver electrode during the deposition process and uniformly distributes the stressed spots in the electrode, which deteriorates readily under tensile strain. Similarly, Chung et al. reported a high performance stretchable silver electrode under lateral tensile strain stress using inkjet printing on a PDMS substrate.170 They formulated silver ink by dispersing silver NPs in a polar solvent like triethylene glycol monoethyl ether and printing on a rough PDMS substrate activated with an aluminium mold followed by sintering at 100 °C. Ultraviolet (UV) ozone treatment and the roughened surface of PDMS improved adhesion between the conducting silver NPs and PDMS surface. The wavy structure of PDMS provided good stretching performance for the printed silver electrodes and good stability in the 1000 time cycling test under fast strain stress (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  Optical images of initial and laterally stretched inkjet-printed silver electrodes on two types of substrate. (a) Bare PDMS (up: initial, middle: 5%, down: 10% tensile strain), (b) rough PDMS (up: initial, middle: 10%, down: 20% tensile strain).

Noh et al. used silver NP based ink (DGP 40LT-15C, ANP Co. Ltd, South Korea) and followed DOD printing to produce narrow (40–90 μm) silver microelectrodes on a PDMS substrate.173 They studied different printing parameters such as drop spacing, sintering temperature and time, platen temperature and nozzle temperature, etc. as well as the stability of the silver lines under both thermal expansion and mechanical bending effects using two different substrates: a thick (2 mm) PDMS layer and a thin (200 μm) PDMS layer coated on soda lime glass. No wrinkle was found after sintering on the thin PDMS – coated sodalime glass, since the PDMS was confined by the glass substrate. Buckling (compressive stress) and cracking were formed in the silver lines printed on thick PDMS substrates sintered at 180 °C for 15 min, due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch and mechanical bending with subsequent recovery of the buckled silver lines after resintering at 180 °C for further 15 minutes. For demonstrating the utility of the printed silver microelectrodes, Noh et al. fabricated both quadruple and castellated electrodes and utilized them to conduct dielectrophoretic (DEP) manipulation of microbeads.173
Kim et al. fabricated and characterized multiaxial stretchable interconnects using room temperature liquid-alloy-filled elastomeric microchannels.171 The microchannel interconnect consists of three PDMS layers. PDMS microchannels deposited at the base with a gold wetting layer were used as reservoirs filled with room temperature liquid alloy using a microfluidic injection technique. Kim et al. achieved a stretchability of 100% using a biaxial diamond shaped interconnect with 0.24 Ω resistance deviation.171 An active surface mount device such as an LED was tested for stretching, bending and twisting without failure.
Thus, direct inkjet printing on PDMS opens a path to create microelectrodes on stretchable PDMS devices for numerous applications in MEMS, microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip communities.
8. Applications of printed inorganic materials
8.1. RFID tags
As an example for a practical application RFID tag fabrication will be discussed. Such tags use electromagnetic fields for wireless identification and tracking of objects such as an automobile during the production process, pharmaceuticals in warehouses, livestock or pets. They may have sizes of a rice corn and may operate hundreds of meters away from the object. For antenna fabrication in RFID tags, conductive inks of metallic microscopic (∼2–40 μm)174,175 or nanoscopic particles such as copper, silver or gold are required8,176–178 or precursor inks are used.106,151 Putting a magnetic NP-based inkjet printed core inside the inkjet printed antenna increases the antenna impedance.179 Antennas are directly fabricated in digital format by inkjet or screen printing techniques and facilitate high volume production at room temperature using R2R printing techniques in industries. After printing the metal NP ink, annealing is performed to obtain the continuous conducting feature. Geometrical and electrical characteristics of printed patterns control the radio frequency behavior of antennas and conducting tracks for RFID applications. Varieties of stable silver and gold inks have been used in this field for a long time.7,106,151 The reactive electrode must acquire the opposite properties; it has to be oxidizable and a fast diffuser in ionic form. Generally, silver and copper are used for this role in conventional manufacturing. The electrolytes allow diffusion of reactive material ions. In view of this, the diffusivity and solubility of used ions must not be large enough to make the formed filaments less stable and negatively affect data retention.
The cost of any electronic equipment covers the combination of different factors. Some of the key components consist of the cost of the used substrate and the processing. Reducing the cost of various components must influence the overall cost of the final product. With regard to the size and purity, a silicon wafer used in electronics processing may cost several dollars per square inch. In contrast, plastic substrates like PET or PEN may cost less than single cents per square inch. In view of this, the above mentioned substrates will exploit the processing temperature restrictions due to plastic deterioration (150 and 200 °C for PET and PEN, respectively). This restriction on temperature limits compatibility of the material. However, it also directs the processing away from more costly high temperature processing steps.
8.2. Sensors and further applications
Although printing technology has been utilized in functional materials, application like sensing is a continuously emerging field.45,180–182 Because of the absence of direct contact between the print-head and substrate, inkjet printing is suitable for printing on contact sensitive substrates, such as membranes.4 Paper-based electrochemical devices (PEDs) have found attention in developing inexpensive and adaptable techniques for the quick analysis of multiple-target or complex-matrix samples.3 Flexible and porous substrates such as paper are essential for printing vastly integrated self-designed electrode arrays for electrochemical gas sensing because of the proper physical attachment between the detection arrays and the paper channels.4 Hu et al. established a strategy for the large scale production of nanoporous gold electrode arrays on porous cellulose membranes using inkjet printing.4 The produced paper-based gold electrode arrays (PGEAs) were found to have many distinctive features such as superb conductivity, good flexibility, simple components and low cost, etc. for the development of thin film electrochemical gas sensors. The average electrical resistivity of six gold strips (0.5 mm × 17.5 mm) with seven printing cycles and eight growth cycles was found to be 2.37 × 10−7 Ω m, which is about 1/10th of the resistivity of bulk gold (2.40 × 10−8 Ω m). This method is used to manufacture conducting lines of 0.3 mm thickness in an interval of 0.25 mm. The application of ionic liquids as electrolytes for PGEAs produced a paper-based solid-state electrochemical oxygen sensor, which acquired better analytical performance than previous ionic liquid-based electrochemical oxygen sensors.4
Chiolerio et al. produced customizable low impedance array of electrodes for testing high density surface ElectroMyoGraphy (HD-sEMG) by inkjet printing a commercial silver based NP ink (InkA-C100, Politronica Inkjet Printing) on a flexible kapton substrate.180 The fabricated device results in 8 × 8 electrode grid with 8 mm intra-electrode-distance. A syringe was used to deposit the masking agent (Chemask LF-Lead Free-Chemtronics) directly on the parts to protect pitches and connection zones. Insulating silicone based liquid was used to avoid problems due to cracks. After fabrication of the electrode array, the sEMG sensors were connected to the brachioradialis fore arm muscle and signal was detected. The developed electrodes performed similar to the commercial ones and were found to be extremely suitable for low pressure high frequency sEMG recordings.180 From these results, it is inferred that the manufactured inkjet printed grids can be applied to bio-potential recording applications and robotic structures etc.
Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful sensing technique, where the high efficiency is because of the amplification of the Raman signal yielded by molecules either adsorbed on or close to noble metal NPs.183 Novara et al. inkjet printed synthesized silver NP inks for development of efficient SERS substrates.182 Two different solvent mixtures (water/ethanol 1:1 and water/dimethyl sulphoxide 3:1 + ethanol 10% volume) were used to prepare ink at variable concentrations of silver nitrate. The synthesized inks were printed on a mesoporous silicon substrate at room temperature and at 65 °C. By optimizing the nanostructure morphology in terms of densely packed silver NPs, huge Raman enhancements (external amplified Raman frequency >108) are obtained exploiting hot spots located in between the NPs. Also, the printed plasmonic patterns show good uniformity and reproducibility, which shows that the fabrication technique is suitable to develop active sensing platforms for multiplexed label free biodetection.182
Maattanen et al. synthesized gold NP ink and jet printed on a paper substrate to form conductive gold electrodes.184 The gold electrode patterns were sintered using an IR drier. The resistivity of the fabricated gold electrode was 1.6 × 10−7 Ω m, which is comparable to the reported values of printed gold electrodes on glass substrates.185 It was further concluded that both the surface roughness and the organic residue remaining after IR sintering have negligible effect on the resistance of the printed gold films/electrodes. The use of flexible copper substrates and R2R compatible printing together with fast sintering methods facilitate the mass production of gold electrodes for large volume and area applications (Fig. 15). The performance of the printed gold NP electrode on paper was tested by droping electrolyte HEPES–EDTA buffer solution (20 μL) on the electrode area. A hydrophobic and transparent PDMS based ink layer was jet printed around the perimeter of the two joined hemi-circular electrodes to confine the electrolyte drop in the closed circuit (Fig. 15a). The stabilized resistance was found to be around 2.9 MΩ (Fig. 15b). This test reveals the possibility of printed gold electrodes for use in paper-based electrochemical applications.

9. Outlook and conclusion
Among different types of printing techniques, inkjet printing is very significant because of its full digital nonimpact printability, which creates patterns without using any mask. Numerous studies establish different aspects related to the fabrication of metal inks. The findings of these studies are expected to bring remarkable changes in various industries including semi-conductors, electronics and photovoltaics etc. The review discusses about various aspects of formulating NP inks and metal–organic based inks using different precursors including adhesion and sintering problems with main emphasis on flexible materials such as plastics and paper.
Although metal–organic precursors100,101,104,105 decompose at a relatively low temperature, the metallic solid content is restricted by both the solubility of the metal–organic compound in a solvent and the molecular fraction of the metal in the compound itself. In addition, metal–organic inks possess less viscosity and mass loading, which results in films/patterns which are too thin or mechanically unstable. Most of the work in printed NP inks is focused on silver using silver containing solutions or suspension of silver NPs, because it is more resistant than copper in air and cheaper than gold.
The sintering process after printing is a very significant step which should be followed depending upon the material and substrate used. The NP inks are encapsulated with surfactants which are not necessarily removed during the sintering process, resulting in imperfect contact between the particles. Lowering the sintering temperature leads to the use of more possible substrates such as polymers for printing. Small particles are favored compared to the large particles; because of the small particle size, a high surface to volume ratio leads to lowering in sintering temperature.113 The sintering temperature must be determined on the basis of thermal stability of the substrate in order to prevent the thermal expansion and contraction. For glass substrates, the sintering temperature can be up to 400 °C. For PCB applications, temperatures must be much lower as polymer based plastic substrates are used and the sintering temperature may not exceed the glass transition temperature of the substrate. Besides thermal sintering microwave, plasma or optical assisted methods are discussed.
In order to facilitate high conductivity and low temperature processable ink for use in plastic substrates, capping ligand modification is a further promising way.132,133,135 Ligands coating the surfaces of the NPs are needed to avoid agglomeration of the otherwise thermodynamically unstable NPs. Chemical exchange or reactions of ligands may be used to modify the capping layer and thus lower sintering temperatures. The sintering temperature can also be decreased by adding appropriate chemicals to facilitate the contact with each other despite the capping layer.132
In order to avoid the oxidation of relatively inexpensive non-noble metals such as copper and nickel, inkjet printing is followed by electroless plating.138,167 The plating time can be altered to control the thickness of the metal deposit, which is a way to attain good conductivity at low processing temperature, which is advantageous for many applications. Dual printing accompanied by an electroless plating method leads to higher conductivity138 on substrates such as plastic and paper.
Vast synthetic routes for fabricating printed metallic patterns with dimensions ranging from micrometers to centimeters open a new avenue for potential applications in various fields such as solar cells,188 transistors,189 sensors,4,45,180–182 paper electronics,190 semiconductors,118,148 RFID tags,176–178 dielectrics,200 piezoelectric materials,191,192 catalysts,193etc. For example, conducting inks of metallic microscopic (∼2–40 μm) or nanoscopic particles such as copper, silver or gold are needed for antenna fabrication for use in RFID tags.176–178 Antennas can be directly fabricated in digital format by use of inkjet or screen printing techniques facilitating high volume production under ambient conditions by using R2R printing techniques in industry. Geometrical and electrical characteristics of printed patterns determine the radio frequency behavior of antennas and the conducting tracks for RFID applications. Furthermore, silver NPs are tested for further electronic devices including transistors and solar cells on different substrates. In spite of the excellent conductivity attained with silver NPs, it is not suitable for many applications because of its reactivity. Oxidation of silver electrodes gives rise to complications in polymer solar cells.194 Moreover, silver is susceptible to diffuse into the active material causing short-circuiting malfunctions.195,196 Therefore, for certain applications, conductive gold features have also been fabricated using printing techniques on different substrates.149,185,187,196–198 The low sintering temperature of gold NPs compared to bulk gold reduces the processing temperature when applied on different substrates.
There are many applications apart from electrodes and circuit board electrode structures which can be facilitated from the fabrication of printed conductive features. For example, chip based electrical or electrochemical detection of bio-molecules on paper is one of such promising applications. The manufacturing of devices by printing techniques for on-site diagnostics opens an arena of printed conducting functional materials. In this regard, substitution of silver by inexpensive metal such as copper or aluminum in precursor inks as well as further improvement of alternative and fast sintering steps towards R2R compatible technologies is the focus of current research in the bio-field of printed materials.4,187
Researchers have made very few attempts so far to deposit/print sequential or simultaneous droplets of different materials and to overcome the challenges involved in it using the inkjet printing technique, which is required to design complex 3D features from multiple materials.53 Careful control of the surface energy and wettability are the two most important characteristics to solve this problem.
To summarize, techniques such as inkjet printing, non-vacuum deposition and screen printing etc. have emerged as promising trends to develop flexible electronics and devices. Among all the printing techniques, inkjet printing has achieved tremendous attention in recent years because of its low cost, non-contact, least material consumption, maskless and digital controlled printing procedure.

 	Fig. 7  Photographs of (a) unsintered inkjet printed gold electrodes on paper, (b) IR-sintered printed gold electrodes on paper. Dodecanethiol-protected gold NPs were synthesized and dispersed in xylene for inkjet printing. IR sintering for 10–15 s changed the color of the printed electrodes to golden and the patterns became conductive. Optically the most homogeneous surface was achieved with the intermediate drop spacing value of 30 μm. Reprinted with permission from ref. 184, Copyright 2012, the American Chemical Society.184
