    , Accepted 28th July 2016First published on 28th July 2016AbstractWe synthesized a wide-bandgap conjugated polymer (named PTZ1) based on thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene as the donor unit and thiazolothiazole as the acceptor unit for photovoltaic applications. The polymer exhibits a desirable broad bandgap of 1.97 eV with the maximum absorption edge of 630 nm, a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.31 eV and a relatively high hole mobility of 3.86 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Consequently, single junction PSCs based on PTZ1 exhibit outstanding performance with a PCE of 7.7% and a high Voc of 0.94 V, which are among the highest values for PSCs based on conjugated polymers with a broad bandgap near to 2.0 eV. The excellent performance is attributed to the high polymer crystallinity, favorable backbone orientation and continuous interpenetrating network in blend films. The tandem PSCs based on PTZ1 as the donor material in the front cell exhibited a high PCE of 10.3% with a Voc of 1.65 V.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention with promising properties such as low cost, lightweight and the capability to manufacture flexible large-area devices.1–4 The photoactive layer of BHJ PSCs is usually composed of conjugated polymers as the donor and fullerene derivatives as the acceptor, which plays a critical role in determining device performance.5,6 Recently, significant progresses have been achieved in this field with the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%.7–10 However, inherent disadvantages of conjugated polymers such as narrow absorption bandwidth and low charge mobility limit the use of the full solar spectrum at the thickness of the photoactive layer (∼100 nm) in the PSCs, and thus limit the device performance.11–13 Hence, the tandem PSCs, stacked multiple photoactive layers with complementary absorption spectra in series, are considered as a promising alternative for realizing high PCEs.14
Generally, a typical double-junction cell consists of a front cell with a wide-bandgap material, an interconnecting layer (ICL), and a rear cell comprising a low-bandgap material.15–19 The overlap of absorption between the front cell and the rear cell must be minimized; then more incident photons can be absorbed, resulting in great energy conversion efficiencies.20 Considering that the short-circuit current (Jsc) of tandem PSCs is governed by the smallest value of the corresponding sub-cells, it is essential to obtain balanced Jsc between the sub-cells.21,22 Therefore, the wide-bandgap polymers with excellent performance play a critical role as important as high performance low-bandgap polymers. In general, in order to be efficiently used for tandem PSCs, there are several requirements for an ideal wide-bandgap polymer. Firstly, a broad bandgap (>1.9 eV) is critical to minimize the overlap of absorption spectra between the front and rear cells.23,24 Secondly, a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is essential to obtain a high open-circuit voltage (Voc).25–27 Thirdly, a high charge carrier mobility and fine blend morphology are necessary to achieve a high Jsc and fill factor (FF) in the single-junction devices.28 However, the exploration of wide-bandgap polymers for tandem PSCs is rare in comparison with the great efforts made to develop low-bandgap polymers.18,23,29 So far, P3HT and PCDTBT have been the predominantly used conjugated polymers in the front cells of tandem PSCs for utilizing the shorter wavelength visible photons.30–36 Although outstanding performance with record PCEs over 11% for tandem PSCs have been achieved, the subcells based on wide-bandgap polymers only give a maximum PCE of ∼6% at the layer thickness used in the tandem devices. Hence, it is urgent to develop highly efficient wide-bandgap materials for tandem PSCs.
Among various donor units, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been one of the most promising units due to its excellent symmetry and planarity.37 In particular, two-dimensional conjugated BDT with thiophene conjugated side chain (BDTT) based conjugated polymers exhibited superior photovoltaic performance with PCEs over 10%.38 The electron deficient thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) unit has also attracted much interest in the construction of high-performance polymers for applications in OPV because of its high oxidative stability, rigid and planar structure and straightforward synthesis.39 A number of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers based on TTz as the acceptor have been reported in the literature, showing high charge carrier mobilities and PCEs over 7%.40
Based on the above considerations, in this work, we designed and synthesized a wide-bandgap conjugated polymer, PTZ1, based on BDTT as the donor unit and TTz as the acceptor unit as shown in Scheme 1. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties, the molecular packing pattern and the morphology of the blend films were investigated. PTZ1 exhibits a desirable broad bandgap of 1.97 eV with the maximum absorption edge of 630 nm, which is beneficial for the absorption in the short wavelength. Furthermore, PTZ1 shows a deep HOMO energy level of −5.31 eV and a relatively high hole mobility of 3.86 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Consequently, single junction PSCs based on PTZ1 exhibit outstanding performance with a PCE of 7.7% and a high Voc of 0.94 V, which are among the highest values for PSCs based on conjugated polymers with a broad bandgap near to 2.0 eV. The tandem PSCs based on PTZ1 as the donor material in the front cell exhibited a high PCE of 10.3% with a Voc of 1.65 V.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of PTZ1
The synthetic route of PTZ1 is shown in Scheme 1, which was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction. The polymer exhibits good solubility in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), thus offering good solution-processing conditions for a high quality film. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PTZ1 are 24.6 kg mol−1 and 1.9, respectively, which were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the eluent at 160 °C. PTZ1 shows good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 439 °C (Fig. S1a in the ESI†). From the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of PTZ1 (Fig. S1b in the ESI†), no obvious exotherms or endotherms were observed from 50 to 250 °C.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PTZ1 in dilute solution and a thin film spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution are shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption maximum of the polymer is located at 523 nm in the solution. Compared with the absorption spectrum in solution, obvious bathochromic shifts with an absorption maximum of 592 nm and a strong shoulder peak at 546 nm in the film are observed, which should be attributed to the strong aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The absorption edge (λedge) of the polymer film is at ca. 630 nm, which corresponds to a broad optical bandgap (Eoptg) of ca. 1.97 eV. The absorption coefficients of PTZ1 in o-dichlorobenzene solution (10−5 M) and the thin film are 6.28 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 9.01 × 104 cm−1, respectively, which are higher than those of many other broad bandgap polymers (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).41 Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the HOMO level of the polymer.42 As shown in Fig. 1b, the onset oxidation potential (ϕox) is 0.60 V versus Ag/Ag+, corresponding to a HOMO level of −5.31 eV, which was calculated according to the equation: HOMO = −e(ϕox + 4.71) (eV). The deep HOMO value is beneficial for a high Voc in PSCs.

Photovoltaic performances and film morphologies in single junction PSCs
Single junction PSCs based on the blend of PTZ1 and PC71BM were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTZ1:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The optimized PTZ1:PC71BM blend ratio was found to be 1:1.25 (w/w), and a PCE of 7.0% was obtained with a high Voc of 1.01 V (Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI†). Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the solar cells based on the PTZ1:PC71BM (1:1.25, w/w) blend spin-coated under different processing conditions. The photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the devices processed without an additive, the devices processed with 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) exhibited a higher Jsc and FF, slightly lower Voc, and thus the enhanced PCE was achieved. When 1% DIO was used, the device exhibited a PCE of 7.2%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 11.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67%. In order to further optimize the device performance, the blend films processed with 1% DIO were annealed at different temperatures and the corresponding device results are shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2 in the ESI.† When the blend film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, the device showed the best performance with a high PCE of 7.7%, which is among the highest values obtained for the single BHJ PSCs based on thiazolothiazole-based polymers, resulting from the deep HOMO level and good planarity of the polymer. As shown in Fig. 2b, EQE was obviously enhanced for the solar cells that were fabricated with the post-treatments. When 1% DIO was added and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, the quantum efficiency of the device significantly increased in the wavelength range of 350–600 nm, which means more efficient photo-electron conversion in this range and hence benefits for the improvement of Jsc. The quantum efficiency values higher than 70% were observed at 450–550 nm and a maximum EQE of 75% at 530 nm was recorded. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are consistent with the observed Jsc values in the J–V measurement, and the deviation is within 5%.

Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD) was used to gain insight into the nanostructure of the polymer in pure and blend films. Fig. 3 shows the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) GIXD profiles of the samples, including the thin films of the pure PTZ1 film and PTZ1:PC71BM blend (1:1.25, w/w) films, which were processed under different conditions. For the neat polymer film, the OOP profile shows broad (100) diffraction peaks at ∼0.30 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 20.9 Å, while the IP profile exhibits pronounced (100) and weak (200) diffraction peaks at ∼0.30 Å−1 and ∼0.60 Å−1, respectively. In addition, the OOP profile shows one sharp and intensive peak at ∼1.73 Å−1, which corresponds to the (010) π–π stacking with a d-spacing of ∼3.63 Å. These results indicate that the neat polymer film exhibits a face-on predominated molecular orientation with respect to the substrate. When blended with PC71BM, the OOP (100) peak was distinctly enhanced, whereas the IP (100) peak became weak. Meanwhile, the π–π stacking of the polymer in the blend films was completely disrupted. The broad peak at q ∼ 1.33 Å−1 is attributed to PC71BM aggregation. When DIO was used as an additive, the IP (100) peak and π–π stacking diffraction significantly increased. After further thermal annealing, the lamellar stacking continued increasing, and the π–π stacking remained almost unchanged. Furthermore, the coherence length (L100) was investigated, deduced from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of IP (100) peaks using the Scherrer equation.43 The values of 12.9 nm, 17.9 nm, and 22.6 nm for without, with 1% DIO or with DIO and thermal annealing were obtained, which means that the overall crystallinity of the polymer was enhanced with the post-treatments. In addition, as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S3 in the ESI,† the polymer in the pure film exhibited a relatively high hole mobility of 3.86 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than the average hole mobility (∼3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the polymers using the same acceptor unit for photovoltaic application,39 resulting from the well-ordered molecular orientation and packing. For the blend films, the higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities were achieved under the synergistic effect of the additive and thermal annealing, which coincides with the variation of the nanostructure of the blend films and favorable for the transport and collection of charge carriers in the device.

To investigate the bulk morphology of the active layer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out. Compared with polymer donors, the higher electron density of fullerene derivatives causes electrons to be scattered more efficiently from the TEM beam. Thus, the dark areas in the TEM images are attributed to the PC71BM-rich domains and the bright regions to the polymer-rich domains.44 TEM images of PTZ1:PC71BM films spin-coated under different processing conditions are shown in Fig. 4. When cast from o-DCB, the blend film showed a poor phase separation. When 1% DIO was added, the phase separation could be seen more clearly, with the emergence of a fibrous PTZ1 nanostructure. When the blend film was further thermally annealed, the defined polymer fibrils and continuous interpenetrating network were formed, which is beneficial for diffusion and separation of photo-generated excitons and the transport and collection of charge carries,45–47 finally enabling enhanced photovoltaic performance.

Photovoltaic performances of inverted tandem PSCs
In order to estimate the potential of PTZ1 for the application in tandem PSCs, the double-junction devices were fabricated with PTZ1 and PBDTTT-C-T48 as donor materials in the front and rear cells, respectively. The chemical structure of PBDTTT-C-T and the device structure of the tandem PSCs are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The thicknesses of the two active layers used in the tandem cell are consistent with those used in the single junction cells. The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are provided in Fig. 5a and Table 2. It shows that the Voc of the tandem cell is 1.65 V, which is approximately equal to the sum of the front and rear sub-cells. A Jsc of 9.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65% were also achieved, resulting in a high PCE of 10.3%. The EQE of the front and rear cells was measured by using 750 and 550 nm light bias, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5b. Both the front and rear cells show an EQE close to 60%, and the integrated Jsc values are 8.15 and 9.80 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well with that in the J–V measurement. These results indicate that PTZ1 is a promising material for making the front cells in tandem PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, a wide-bandgap conjugated polymer, PTZ1, was designed and synthesized for photovoltaic applications. The polymer exhibited a broad bandgap of 1.97 eV, a deep HOMO level of −5.31 eV and a relatively high hole mobility of 3.86 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The single junction PSCs based on the blend of PTZ1:PC71BM with 1% DIO as the additive and thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min exhibited the best performance with a high Voc of 0.94 V and a PCE of 7.7%, which is among the highest values of the PSCs based on the donor materials with a bandgap near to 2.0 eV. The tandem PSCs based on PTZ1 as the donor material in the front cell exhibited outstanding performance with a high PCE of 10.3% and a Voc of 1.65 V. Therefore, PTZ1 is a promising polymer donor with great potential applications in tandem PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
The chemical raw materials were purchased from Aldrich, TCI Chemical, J&K and Alfa Aesar, respectively, and are reagent grades and used without further purification. PC71BM was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. 1,8-Diiodoctane (DIO) was purchased from TCI Chemicals. The (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) and 2,5-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole were purchased from Suna Tech Inc.
Synthesis of the polymer
In a 50 mL double-neck round bottom flask, (4, 8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (0.3 mmol) and 2,5-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (0.3 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL toluene. After being purged with argon for 20 min, 16 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the flask as the catalyst, and then the reaction mixture was purged with argon for another 30 min. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to reflux for 12 h under an argon atmosphere. When the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated by addition of 100 mL methanol, collected by filtration and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform in the end. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by precipitation from methanol. The solid was dried under vacuum. The yield was 78%. GPC: Mw = 46.83 K; Mn = 24.55 K; PDI = 1.91.

Device fabrication and characterization

Solution preparation. 
The ZnO precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (1 g) and ethanolamine (0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 12 h for hydrolysis in air. PFN was mixed into methanol with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1, and a small volume (0.25% by volume) of acetic acid was injected into the turbid liquid to dissolve PFN. The PFN solution is stable for use in a few weeks.


Single junction solar cells. 
Polymer solar cell devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTZ1:PC71BM/MoO3/Al were fabricated under conditions as follows: ZnO electron transport layers were prepared onto the cleaned ITO glass through spin coating at 5000 rpm from a ZnO precursor solution. Then the ZnO substrates were immediately baked in air at 200 °C for 1 h. A solution of PTZ1:PC71BM in o-DCB with different weight ratios and DIO concentrations (the concentration of PTZ1 is fixed at 12 mg mL−1) was spin-cast atop the ZnO layers to form the active layer inside a controlled atmosphere of a nitrogen box containing less than 5 ppm oxygen and moisture. The thickness of the active layer was measured using a KLA-Tencor D-100 profilometer. Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and 80 nm Al were sequentially deposited on top of the active layers through a shadow mask in a vacuum of less than 2 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of the devices was 0.04 cm2.


Tandem solar cells. 
The front subcell was prepared as described above using ZnO as an electron transport layer. After PTZ1:PC71BM solution was spin-coated, 10 nm MoO3 and 0.5 nm ultra-thin Ag were evaporated on the active layer under high vacuum. Then, the PFN solution was spin-coated on top of Ag. Subsequently, the solution of PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM was spin-coated to get an approximate 95 nm thick film. Finally, MoO3 and Al were sequentially deposited on top of the rear layer using the same method used in single-junction devices. The active area of the devices was 0.04 cm2.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2450 Precision Source/Measure unit. The power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells were measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5G (air mass 1.5 global) (100 mW cm−2) using a SS-F5-3A (Enli Technology CO., Ltd.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 50 mm × 50 mm photo-beam size). A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-00019) was purchased from Enli Technology CO., Ltd. The EQE was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technology CO., Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

Instruments and measurements
Absorption spectra were acquired using a Carry 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer by Agilent Technologies. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was measured on Polymer Laboratories PL-GPC220 at 160 °C using 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Zahner Ennium Electrochemical Workstation with a glassy carbon disk, Pt wire, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. The GIXRD measurements were acquired at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS).49 Samples were prepared on a Si substrate under the same conditions as those used for device fabrication. The 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.11–0.15°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the samples. TEM measurements were performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN instrument at 200 kV accelerating voltage.
Mobility measurements
The mobility was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method by a hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al or an electron-only device with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al and estimated through the Mott–Gurney equation. For the hole-only devices, SCLC is described by  where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the characteristic field, J is the current density, L is the thickness of the blended film, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode. For the electron-only devices, SCLC is described by J = (9/8)εrε0μeV2/L3, where J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, L is the thickness of the blend film, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode.
