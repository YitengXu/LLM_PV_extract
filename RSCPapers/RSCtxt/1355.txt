    , Accepted 8th February 2018First published on 10th February 2018AbstractLuminescence concentration quenching significantly limits the upconversion (UC) performance of lanthanide-doped luminescent materials. Efficient confinement of the excitation energy in a lanthanide activator can alleviate the concentration quenching caused by cross-relaxation and energy migration to surface defects. In this work, a series of new energy trapping centers with varied migrating energy levels (2F5/2 of Yb3+, 3H5 of Tm3+, 5I6 of Ho3+, 7F6 of Eu3+, and 3F3 of Pr3+etc.) are introduced into NaErF4@NaYF4 nanoparticles. The results show that a great enhancement in Er3+ UC processes of converting multi-band NIR photons into visible emissions is achieved in NaErF4@NaYF4 after adding energy trapping centers. The energy level compatibility between Er3+ activators and the energy trapping centers determines the excitation energy confinement, energy-back-transfer efficiency and luminescence output. By incorporating the energy trapping center doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the TiO2 photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the photon–electron conversion efficiency of DSSCs increases from 6.82% to 7.86% due to the improved multi-band NIR photon harvest of the TiO2 photoanode with NaErF4: 10% Yb@NaYF4.
Introduction
Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have extensive applications in advanced bioimaging,1–5 bio-detection,6–10 photoinduced therapy,11–13 optical data storage,14 solid-state lasers,15 and solar energy conversion.16–18 However, the brightness/efficiency of upconversion (UC) luminescence is limited severely by the concentration quenching,19 which can be attributed to the cross-relaxation quenching and the energy migration loss.19–23 The cross-relaxation quenching occurs due to the increased interaction between two neighboring activators as shown in Fig. 1a. The energy migration loss occurs as the excitation energy migrates from bulk activators to surface defects or other quenching sites (Fig. 1a). To suppress the cross-relaxation quenching, the ultra-high excitation irradiance (∼106 W cm−2) has been employed and a significant increase in activator doping concentration up to ∼20% Er3+ or ∼8% Tm3+ has been achieved.24–27 NIR organic dye cascade-sensitized UCNPs have also shown reduced cross-relaxation quenching under low excitation power and the Nd3+ doping concentration can be increased from 2% to 20%.28 To reduce the energy migration loss, an inert shell has been coated on the surfaces of UCNPs (Fig. 1b).29 The inert shell (>6 nm, NaLuF4, NaYF4et al.) isolates spatially the inner activators and surface quenching sites, allowing a high concentration quenching threshold of Er3+ (up to 100 at%).19,23 In addition, temperature modulation30 and construction of the new structure31–33 are also employed to suppress concentration quenching. Despite the fact that the aforementioned strategies can suppress the concentration quenching, they fail to mitigate simultaneously the cross-relaxation quenching and energy migration loss. Recently, Liu's group reported that, as shown in Fig. 1c, the Tm3+ ions doped into NaErF4@NaYF4 confine effectively the excitation energy in Er3+ activators, and are called energy trapping centers.34Fig. 1d–f illustrates the estimated proportion of the upconversion process, cross-relaxation quenching and energy migration loss in the NaErF4 bare core, the NaErF4@NaYF4 core–shell and NaErF4:Ln@NaYF4 core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) with energy trapping centers, respectively.

(d–f) General proportion of the upconversion process, cross-relaxation quenching and energy migration loss in the NaErF4 bare core, the NaErF4@NaYF4 core–shell and NaErF4:Ln@NaYF4 core–shell nanoparticles with energy trapping centers, respectively. 
Involving Tm3+ ions in NaErF4@NaYF4 as energy trapping centers only gives the output of red luminescence. Whether other types of ions can serve as energy trapping centers and whether they can tailor the UC luminescence are still unknown. Herein, a series of rare-earth ions (Yb3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Ce3+, Eu3+, and Tm3+) were introduced into NaErF4@NaYF4 for new candidates of energy trapping centers. These rare-earth ions with different types of trapping levels enable transient confinement of excitation energy, simultaneously alleviating the interaction between the Er3+ ion pair and energy migration to the surface (Fig. 1c). The confined energy can transfer back to Er3+ activators. The energy trapping level compatibility between Er3+ activators and the energy trapping centers plays a decisive role in the excitation energy confinement, energy-back-transfer efficiency and luminescence output. The designed NaErF4@NaYF4 core–shell UCNPs with energy trapping centers can convert the unutilized sub-bandgap NIR photons in a multi-band range, including 1532, 980 and 808 nm, into useful above-bandgap visible photons for DSSCs. Doping UCNPs into the TiO2 photoanode results in a 15.25% improvement in the overall DSSC efficiency.
Results and discussion
NaYF4 doped with Er3+ ion concentrations varying from 10 to 100 at%, NaErF4 doped with different Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+, Tm3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, and Ce3+) and NaErF4:Ln3+@NaYF4 core–shell NPs were synthesized using a modified high-temperature co-precipitation method according to the previous literature.14 The details of the synthetic procedure are given in the ESI.† Fig. S1a–e (ESI†) show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the NaYF4 NPs doped with 10, 20, 50, 70, and 100 at% Er3+, respectively. The morphology and the size of the as-prepared nanoparticles change little with the increasing Er3+ content. However, a rapid decline in luminescence emissions was observed due to Er3+ concentration quenching as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The TEM images in Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S3a, e, i (ESI†) show that the bare NaErF4 NPs and NaErF4 NPs doped with different Ln3+ ions exhibit a monodispersed spherical shape with a diameter of ∼15.6 ± 0.5 nm, indicating that the NaErF4 nanocrystalline structure is not affected by trapping center ions. The XRD patterns in Fig. S4 (ESI†) show that the diffraction peaks of the un-doped and doped NaErF4 samples match well with the standard hexagonal NaErF4 (JCPDF 27-0689), demonstrating that the dopants occupy the position of Er3+ without changing the lattice structure. The diffraction rings of the SAED pattern from NaErF4 and NaErF4@NaYF4 in Fig. 2e and j can be assigned to the (111), (110), (101), (100), (200), (201) and (210) planes of the standard hexagonal NaErF4 structure. As shown in Fig. 2f and h, the diameters of core/shell nanoparticles are 18.7 ± 1.4 nm when NaYF4 shells were coated onto NaErF4 cores, indicating a shell thickness of 1.5 nm. A bright core region and a slight-dark shell layer are observed by high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images, confirming the formation of core/shell NaErF4@NaYF4 structures. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) in Fig. 2b and g shows two lattices spacing of 0.52 and 0.519 nm, which agrees well with the (100) lattice planes of hexagonal NaErF4 (JCPDF 27-0689) and NaYF4 (JCPDF 16-0334), respectively, further implying the formation of the NaErF4:Ln3+@NaYF4 core/shell structure.

To verify the importance of energy trapping centers with various migration levels for preventing concentration quenching in NaErF4@NaYF4 NPs, the UC luminescence spectra of NaErF4@NaYF4, NaErF4: 10% Yb3+@NaYF4, NaErF4: 0.5% Tm3+@NaYF4 and NaErF4: 2% Eu3+@NaYF4 were measured under the excitation of 980 nm. To allow an accurate comparison of the UC emitting performance, the contents of three typical types of trapping centers were optimized in NaErF4:Ln3+@NaYF4 core/shell NPs. The optimal doping concentrations of Yb3+, Tm3+ and Eu3+ were determined to be about 10 at%, 0.5 at% and 2 at%, respectively as shown in Fig. S5–S7 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a, two characteristic emission peaks of green and red centered at 525/540 and 660 nm were observed in all four samples, which are assigned to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 2I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. However, the UC luminescence spectra of the NaErF4@NaYF4 NPs are reinforced by about 31.1 times, 28.4 times and 10.6 times after separately introducing the trapping centers of 10 at% Yb3+, 0.5 at% Tm3+ and 2 at% Eu3+. The enhancement can be ascribed to their effective excitation energy confinement, including two aspects: (i) serving as temporary storage of energy to alleviate the energy migration to surface defects and allow energy return to Er3+ activators. (ii) Implanting energy-trapping ions into the NaErF4 lattice increases the distance between Er3+ ions, leading to reduced cross-relaxation. The resulting UC luminescence color varies with changing the types of trapping centers. Indeed, the red/green (R/G) ratio changes from 28.24 (Tm3+) to 6.42 (Yb3+) and then to 0.36 (Eu3+) as shown in Fig. 3c. The result is also illustrated by the inset photographic images of Fig. 3a. To eliminate the luminescence interference of Yb3+ when excited by the 980 nm laser, the 1532 nm laser was employed to excite the four samples. The luminescence intensity indicates a similar trend induced by trapping centers. The luminescence color also transforms from red to green along with the variation of the R/G ratio (the inset Fig. 3b and d). This is because the modulation of characteristic migrating levels from the trapping centers to excitation energy plays a crucial role. For instance, the energy value of the 3H5 (Tm3+) state is slightly lower than that of 4I11/2 (Er3+), resulting in an easy energy transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+ (4I11/2 (Er3+) → 3H5 (Tm3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+)) (Fig. 3g). The population inversion between 4I11/2 (Er3+) and 4I13/2 (Er3+) was also tuned by the doped Tm3+ trapping center, leading to a huge enhancement in red UC emission at 654 nm (Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2). However, the tuning process is accompanied by non-radiation loss. The emission peak at 695 nm assigned to the 3F3 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions was generated through the energy transfer from Er3+ to Tm3+, this implies an inefficient preservation of excitation energy. As for the Yb3+ trapping center, the 2F5/2 level is almost at the same level with the 4I11/2 state of Er3+, which is able to serve as a more efficient energy trapping center through the 4I11/2 (Er3+) → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) → 4I11/2 (Er3+) process, producing an isometric enhancement in red and green UC emissions (Fig. 3f). Apart from Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions, the Eu3+ ion possessing contiguous energy levels lower than 4I13/2 (Er3+), which is inclined to depopulation of 4I13/2 (Er3+) and 4F9/2 (Er3+) with non-radiation processes, then emitting a relatively weak red emission and strong green light. To verify the regulatory mechanism of introducing characteristic migrating trapping levels, a comparison between the lower 5I6(Ho3+) level and 4I11/2 (Er3+), as well as 3F3(Pr3+) and 4I13/2 (Ce3+) states with lower energy than 4I13/2 (Er3+) were also put into the NaErF4@NaYF4 lattice at a dopant concentration of 0.25–2 at% (Fig. S8, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the 5I6(Ho3+), 3F3(Pr3+) and 4I13/2 (Ce3+) energy trapping centers enhance the emissions of red and green luminescence in NaErF4@NaYF4 NPs, respectively. These results confirm that the types of trapping levels can manipulate the excitation energy confinement of NaErF4@NaYF4 NPs. It should be noted that choosing suitable energy trapping centers with an optimal doping concentration increases the confining efficiency of the excitation energy, and restrains the negative effect of doping ions due to the increased non-radiative relaxation of Er3+ caused by the interaction between Er3+ and doping ions.35,36

(e–h) Proposed upconversion mechanisms for excitation energy confined Er3+-based host sensitization core–shell nanocrystals when introducing various energy trapping centers (Yb3+, Tm3+, Eu3+, et al.) under 980 nm excitation. The insets show the core–shell structure and visible upconversion emission of these nanocrystals. 
To confirm our proposed mechanism, the laser power density dependent luminescence spectra for NaErF4@NaYF4, NaErF4: 10 at% Yb3+@NaYF4, NaErF4: 0.5 at% Tm3+@NaYF4 and NaErF4: 2 at% Eu3+@NaYF4 were measured, as shown in Fig. 4a. The addition of Tm3+ or Yb3+ trapping centers to the NaErF4 lattice leads to an obvious decrease in the number of photon processes. This is mainly attributed to the efficient energy back transfer process from the trapping centers to the 4I13/2 state of Er3+, and the suppression of cross-relaxation quenching between Er3+ ions. As a result, assisted by the Tm3+(3H5) or Yb3+ (2F5/2) energy trapping center, more photons were populated in the 4F9/2 state of Er3+ activators. Compared with NaErF4@NaYF4 NPs, the decay lifetimes of Er3+ emission at the 4F9/2 state decreases from 291 μs to 252 μs and 256 μs, respectively, resulting in an increased rate of energy radiations from the 4F9/2 state to the 4I15/2 state (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the number of photon processes of the red emitting peak diminishes upon introducing the migrating energy level (7F6) of Eu3+, which is harmful to confining more excitation energy in the 4F9/2 state of Er3+ from the 4I13/2 state of Er3+ ions. Consequently, the decay lifetimes of Er3+ emission at the 4F9/2 state decreases from 291 μs to 241 μs, as shown in Fig. 4b.

(b) Luminescence decay of Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition (∼650 nm) in the four core–shell nanostructures under 980 nm excitation. 
In addition, the regulated phenomenon was confirmed by introducing Pr3+, Ho3+, and Ce3+ ions in NaErF4@NaYF4 NPs (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). The calculated chromaticity coordinates in Fig. S10 (ESI†) show the same trend of UC luminescence color in the NaErF4@NaYF4 system, indicating that the control of energy trapping centers in the NaErF4@NaYF4 system can manipulate UC luminescence emissions. The possible adjustment mechanisms are given in Fig. S11 (ESI†). However, the emission intensity enhancement was inconspicuous due to the limited energy back transfer. We thus conclude that the introduction of appropriate migrating energy trapping centers into the NaErF4@NaYF4 system minimizes the energy loss of cross-relaxation and energy migration to the surface, and finally produces high-efficiency UC emission.
Theoretical studies have demonstrated that photon upconversion provides a promising avenue to promote the contribution of infrared fluorescence to solar cells by converting unutilized sub-bandgap infrared photons into useful above-bandgap visible photons under the concentrated solar power.37,38 Experimental studies have also shown that the UC process improves the infrared response of solar cells to sunlight.39,40 Typically, the incorporation of UCNPs significantly reduces the non-absorption photon loss in dye-sensitized solar cells, where incident photons matching well with the absorption range of organic dyes (N719) are effectively harvested by a dye-sensitized TiO2 layer, whilst incident NIR photons are converted into absorbable visible light (Fig. S12, ESI†).41 The exploited UCNPs with energy trapping centers show a strong and simultaneous harvest of 1532, 980 and 808 nm NIR lights, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The harvested photonic energy of NIR multi-band lights can then be efficiently transferred to the N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode. To examine this feature, we prepared five DSSCs. The first one is a regular DSSC device without UCNPs (control cell), the second one is a DSSC with NaYF4@NaYF4 UCNPs (control cell), the third one is a DSSC with NaErF4@NaYF4 UCNPs (control cell), and the others are DSSCs incorporated with NaErF4: 10 at% Yb3+@NaYF4 and NaErF4: 0.5 at% Tm3+@NaYF4 UCNPs, respectively. The cell preparation process is schematically shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). The UCNPs had been successfully deposited into the TiO2 photoanode, as indicated by the change of surface morphology due to the addition of UCNPs in FESEM images (Fig. S14, ESI†). Subsequently, we investigated the photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of these five cells under direct AM1.5 G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2), and the results are shown in Fig. 5a with photovoltaic parameters summarized in its inset. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases from 13.119 mA cm−2 (control DSSC) to 14.069 mA cm−2, then to 14.481 mA cm−2 and finally to 15.106 mA cm−2 upon separately coupling NaErF4@NaYF4, NaErF4: 0.5 at% Tm@NaYF4 and NaErF4: 10 at% Yb@NaYF4 with TiO2 membranes, suggesting that the designed UCNPs are beneficial for harvesting NIR sunlight and operating DSSC. For comparison, the NaYF4@NaYF4 nanoparticles without any dopants were introduced into DSSC, achieving a Jsc of 13.556 mA cm−2 and η of 7.048%. This result confirms that a 3.34% efficiency enhancement is contributed by the scattering effect. It is worth noting that the largest efficiency enhancement was obtained by employing the NaErF4: 10 at% Yb@NaYF4 as the NIR absorption layer, producing a 15.25% efficiency enhancement. Notably, compared with the pure TiO2 photoanode, these TiO2 photoanodes doped with different UCNPs show the same lifetime of electrons, as shown in Fig. 5b and c. The result indicates that doping UCNPs did not affect the transmission of photons/electrons in the TiO2 layer, and the designed UCNPs with trapping center ions play an important role in the enhancement of harvesting NIR multi-band lights.

Conclusions
In summary, our investigations illustrate that the Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+, Tm3+, Eu3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, and Ho3+) energy trapping centers suppress simultaneously the cross-relaxation quenching and energy migration loss through confining efficiently the excitation energy of Er3+ activators in NaErF4:Ln3+ coated with a thin inert NaYF4 shell (∼1.5 nm). By varying the energy trapping centers in NaErF4:Ln3+@NaYF4 NPs, the luminescence brightness and color of the UCNPs can be tuned upon 1532 or 980 nm excitation. The Tm3+ or Ho3+ energy trapping center is beneficial for photon population in the 4F9/2 state of Er3+ ions for red emission. In contrast, Eu3+ or Pr3+ accelerates the depopulation of photons in the F9/2 state, and thus induces strong green light. In particular, the Yb3+ trapping center simultaneously enhances red and green emissions by efficiently confining excitation energy and transfer-back to Er3+ activators. The incorporation of NaErF4: 10 at% Yb3+@NaYF4 NPs into DSSCs shows a 15.25% enhancement in photoelectron conversion efficiency. Our work provides a facile strategy to tailor the upconversion luminescence and facilitates the development of high-efficient upconversion luminescence devices.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The cross-relaxation and energy migration quenching processes in a NaErF4 bare core. (b) A typical strategy to hinder energy migration to surface quenching sites through inert-shell coating. (c) The approach of simultaneously preventing cross-relaxation and energy migration quenching processes through introducing Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Ce3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, etc.) energy trapping centers. Note that the light blue area in (c) represents the confined excitation energy domain. (d–f) General proportion of the upconversion process, cross-relaxation quenching and energy migration loss in the NaErF4 bare core, the NaErF4@NaYF4 core–shell and NaErF4:Ln@NaYF4 core–shell nanoparticles with energy trapping centers, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a and d) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, (b and g) high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, (c and h) nanoparticle size distribution, (d and i) high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images, (e and j) Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of NaErF4 (a, b, c, d, e) and NaErF4@NaYF4 (a, b, c, d, e) nanoparticles, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Visible upconversion emission spectra, integrated intensity and red/green (R/G) ratios of NaErF4@NaYF4, NaErF4: 2 at% Eu@NaYF4, NaErF4: 0.5 at% Tm@NaYF4 and NaErF4: 10 at% Yb@NaYF4 core–thin shell (∼1.5 nm) nanoparticles dispersed in cyclohexane solution under an excitation of (a and c) 980 nm (0.6 W) and (b and d) 1532 nm (1.5 W) diode laser, respectively. (e–h) Proposed upconversion mechanisms for excitation energy confined Er3+-based host sensitization core–shell nanocrystals when introducing various energy trapping centers (Yb3+, Tm3+, Eu3+, et al.) under 980 nm excitation. The insets show the core–shell structure and visible upconversion emission of these nanocrystals.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Power density dependence of Er3+ emission at 650 nm, indicating a two-photon population process for red emission in the NaErF4@NaYF4, NaErF4: 2 at% Eu@NaYF4, NaErF4: 0.5 at% Tm@NaYF4 and NaErF4: 10 at% Yb@NaYF4 core–inert shell (∼1.5 nm) nanoparticles/nanocrystals under excitation of a 980 nm diode laser. (b) Luminescence decay of Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition (∼650 nm) in the four core–shell nanostructures under 980 nm excitation.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and (b) Bode phase plots of DSSC, DSSC with NaYF4@NaYF4, DSSC with NaErF4@NaYF4, DSSC with NaErF4: 0.5 at% Tm@NaYF4 and DSSC with NaErF4: 10 at% Yb@NaYF4 under AM1.5 G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
