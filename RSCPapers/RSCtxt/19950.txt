Introduction
Bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) based on a blend of conjugated polymer/fullerene systems offer promise for the realization of a low-cost, printable, portable and flexible renewable energy source. Currently, BHJSCs achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 8.3%1 and further improvements in efficiency are required for commercialization. The most common materials that have been studied in BHJSCs are regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rrP3HT) and its derivatives, with important progress having been made in understanding the device science and the associated improvements in device efficiency.2 A key challenge for the design of efficient BHJSCs is the ability to achieve high-yield and long-lived charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface whilst ensuring good electrical connection between the domains to facilitate charge carrier transport and collection at the device electrodes.3 Typically, to achieve high charge separation yields and efficient charge transport in the BHJ the donor and acceptor must self-assemble into domains with dimensions of the order of the exciton diffusion length (10 nm).4 Control of the morphology of the active layer in BHJ by using different solvents,5annealing treatment,6,7 and processing additives8 significantly improves the nanoscale phase separation and further enhances the device performance. In recent years, block copolymers have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the photovoltaic properties of BHJSCs, because of their ability to self-assemble and form stable nanostructures in the range comparable to the exciton diffusion length. These copolymers have been explored in the fabrication of solar cells along two directions. First, rod coil block copolymers have been proposed as compatibilizers for blends of P3HT/PC61BM. In these systems, the confinement of block copolymer joints at domain interfaces reduces interfacial tension and suppresses coalescence, limiting domain sizes and improving morphological stability.9 Second, conjugated diblock copolymers, that have been investigated as the active layer in BHJ, resulted in some of the highest power conversion efficiencies (3–4%).10,11 The synthesis of all conjugated block copolymers remains arduous, and there have been only a few recent reports on their synthesis, via Suzuki-type cross-coupling12 or Grignard metathesis polymerization.13GRIM polymerization, which was initially developed for poly(alkyl-thiophene), has been recently extended and shown to be a versatile and powerful tool to elaborate a large variety of random and all-conjugated block copolymers. Historically, McCullough and co-workers were the first to report on the one-pot synthesis of a fully conjugated diblock conjugated polymer using GRIM.14 Following this breakthrough, research on the synthesis of rod–rod conjugated polymers using GRIM developed rapidly. In 2008, Hashimoto and co-workers reported on a one-pot synthesis of a fully conjugated diblock conjugated polymer by using controlled chain-growth condensation; 3-alkylthiophene monomers bearing hexyl and ethylhexyl side chains respectively were polymerized by sequential addition of the monomers.15 Block poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(3-phenoxymethylthiophene) with a high molecular weight and low polydispersity index was synthesized by sequential addition of monomers.16 The combination of crystalline regioregular P3HT and amorphous poly(3-phenoxymethylthiophene) induced a phase separation, and the polymer, blended with PC61BM, provided efficient photovoltaic devices with conversion efficiencies of 2.8%. Jenekhe et al.10 reported on the photovoltaic properties, charge transport, and morphology of a series of crystalline/crystalline all-conjugated diblock copolymer, poly(3-butylthiophene)-b-poly(3-octylthiophene), with power conversion efficiencies as high as 3.0%. Lin and co-workers11 have demonstrated that poly(3-butylthiophene)-b-poly(3-hexylthiophene) is a promising material for use in BHJSCs, with a greatly enhanced PCE of 4.02%, which reflected the synergy between a finer phase separation of diblock copolymer and PC71BM and the formation of respective percolation networks of donor and acceptor. The nanoscale morphology and overall performance of P3HT:PC61BM solar cells were improved by using P3HT-b-poly(3-(4′-(3′′,7′′-dimethyloctyloxy)-3′-pyridinyl)thiophene) as additive.17
There have been several reports on the synthesis of rod–rod block copolymers that contain a P3HT block and observations of the microphase separation. However, the synthesis of all block copolymers reported so far involved first the polymerization of 3-hexylthiophene, followed by P3HT chain extension with polythiophene substituted with alkyl chains of different length or nature.10,11,16,17 The resulting block copolymers usually show completely different properties and stacking of polymer chains from their homopolymer counterparts.
Here, we report on the synthesis of amphiphilic block copolymers with fixed hydrophobic block length by GRIM polymerization. The photovoltaic properties and morphologies of blends of amphiphilic diblock conjugated with PC61BM are investigated, as a function of block composition. Imaging the copolymers/PC61BM blends by atomic force microscopy revealed finer nano-phase separation and self-assembly into an interpenetrating network with 10–20 nm crystalline polymer domains. These morphological characteristics are also correlated with the performance of the photovoltaic devices.
Results and discussion

Copolymer design and synthesis

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic steps for the preparation of block and random copolymer materials. The method starts with the synthesis of a novel carboxy-functionalized thiophene, 5-(2-(thiophen-3-yl)ethoxy)pentanoic acid. The starting material was prepared by Williamson reaction of 3-thiophene ethanol and 5-bromovaleric acid, the carboxylic acid was then protected as ester, followed by its electrophilic dibromination with NBS, in 30% overall yield. To control the ability of 2,5-dibromo-3-ethyl-ethoxy-pentanoatethiophene to undergo GRIM polymerization, we first optimized its reaction with isopropylmagnesium bromide (iPrMgBr). Under optimized conditions, the bromine–magnesium exchange was complete after 1 h in THF at −50 °C, and afforded the Grignard reagent with high regioselectivity, as shown by 1H NMR and GC mass analysis. These observations are in accordance with recent results showing that the quasi-living GRIM polymerization tolerates esters, hence providing a new route to the regio-regular polythiophenes with carboxylic acid side chains.18

The key to the success of this step lies in the fact that the Grignard reagents bearing sensitive functional groups can be prepared viaBr/Mg exchange at low temperature.19 Hence, random and block copolymers could be synthesized from ester-protected 2,5-dibromo-3-(6-ethyl-ethoxy-pentanoate) thiophene and 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiopheneviamixing or sequential polymerization procedure, respectively (Scheme 1). The random copolymer, poly([3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl]-co-[3-(6-ethyl-ethoxy-pentanoate) thiophene-2,5-diyl]), denoted P3HT-cococo-P3EtPT, was prepared by mixing the Grignard derivative of monomer 2 with 2-bromo-5-chloro-magnesium-3-hexylthiophene, at a molar ratio of 1:2. The polymerization was initiated by the addition of a catalytic amount (0.5% molar) of Ni(dppp)Cl2 ([monomers]/[Ni(dppp)Cl2] = 200). The resulting copolymer was purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction using methanol, ether, and chloroform, respectively. The GPC analysis of the chloroform fraction showed a monomodal peak at Mn = 16600 g mol−1 with a narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI = 1.12). The 1H NMR spectrum of P3HT-cococo-P3EtPT (Fig. 1) confirms the structure and the composition of the copolymer. The peak located at 2.34 ppm, which corresponds to the methylene group adjacent to the ester carbonyl, confirms that the ester group survived exposure to the Grignard reagent. The peaks at 2.80, 3.09, 3.50, 3.71 and 4.01 arise from P3HT and 2 segments, respectively.

The composition was calculated from the integral ratio between the triplet at 2.80 ppm assigned to methylene protons of the hexyl group and the triplet at 3.09 of oxyethylene protons next to the thiophene ring in monomer 2. P3HT-cococo-P3EtPT consists of 64 mol% of 3-hexyl-thiophene and 36 mol% of thiophene unit substituted with ester groups. The actual composition is very close to the feed ratio (66–33%) of the monomers. A block copolymer, P3HT-bbb-P3EtPT, was synthesized following the procedure reported by McCullough and co-workers.14 The first block was prepared by GRIM polymerization of monomer 2, using Ni(dppp)Cl2 to give a polymer with a living chain-end, which was chain-extended into the diblock structure by addition of 2-bromo-5-bromomagnesium-3-hexylthiophene. The resulting block copolymer was purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction. The GPC analysis showed a monomodal peak with PDI = 1.16 and Mn = 17000 g mol−1. Fig. 2 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of P3HT-bbb-P3EtPT, the signals at 2.80 and 3.08 ppm are assigned to the protons of the α-methylene units in the α position of the thiophene ring of the P3HT segment and the oxyethylene protons of the P3EtPT segment, respectively. The molar ratio of the segment units (n:m) for P3EtPT:P3HT is 37:63, as determined by the integration of the signal of methylene protons of the hexyl and oxyethylene of 2. The measured composition is very close to the feed molar ratio (33:66).

Interestingly, in the aromatic region, the random copolymer shows four singlets at 6.98, 7.02, 7.04 and 7.07 ppm (Fig. 3). The peak at 6.98 is assigned to the HT–HT triad of P3HT. That at 7.07 has the same shift as the aromatic proton in the HT–HT triad of homopolymer obtained from monomer 2. The peaks at 7.02 and 7.04 arise from the other two triads resulting from coupling of 3-hexylthiophene and monomer 2. This confirms the statistical distribution of the monomers in the chain. In contrast, the block copolymer shows two singlets in the aromatic region at 6.98 and 7.07 ppm corresponding to each block.

The saponification of the ester group in both copolymers was accomplished in a NaOH solution in THF and afforded a dark red solid, which was insoluble in both organic and inorganic solvents. The lack of solubility is not entirely unexpected, because the solubility of rigid polyelectrolytes has been shown to be driven by the hydrophilic–lipophilic balance and electrostatic interactions.20 To overcome solubility problems associated with lipophilicity, we reasoned that shortening the hydrophilic block would increase the solubility in organic solvents. Hence, the diblock copolymer with shorter polar block length was performed through GRIM and post-polymerization functionalization.21 This method involved the synthesis of 3,2-(5-bromopentyl)oxyethyl-thiophene, and its quantitative dibromination with NBS, see Scheme 2. To prepare the block copolymer, the 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene was reacted with i-PrMgBr and treated with catalyst to initiate the polymerization. In a separate vessel, the bromo-alkyl-substituted thiophene monomers were reacted and added to the polymerization reaction after the 3-hexylthiophene monomer was consumed. The resulting copolymer (P3HT-bb-P3BrPT) was purified by Soxhlet extraction as described before. The P3HT-bb-P3BrPTdiblock copolymer was characterized by GPC and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1†). The molecular weight and polydispersity index were found to be 15000 g mol−1 and 1.37, respectively. The integration of the signals of the methylene proton at α of thiophene for the 3-hexyl moiety and of the methylene protons at 3.39 ppm for BrCH2 gives the relative block lengths and ratio of the copolymer. The latter was estimated to be 95:5. The bromide groups in P3HT-bb-P3BrPT were transformed into oxazoline-protected carboxylic functions by treating the chloroform-soluble fraction with excess of lithiated 2,4,4-trimethyloxazoline at low temperature. The conversion was confirmed by the appearance of a new resonance at δ = 2.22 ppm and disappearance of the triplet at δ = 3.38 ppm assigned to the terminal methylene group α of bromine. An acidic hydrolysis of the protecting group afforded the soluble amphiphilic diblock copolymer, P3HT-bb-P3AcidHT. The reaction was clean, with almost quantitative conversion in each step.

Photovoltaic properties
Before investigating the photovoltaic and self-assembly properties, the photophysical characteristics and absorption spectra of the copolymers were examined in solution and solid state to compare the degree of π conjugation of the rod–rod block with that of the P3HT homopolymer. The hydrophilic pendant groups do not appear to significantly affect the photophysical properties of the copolymers, since they are both similar to P3HT in terms of solution and solid state absorption and emission spectra. Briefly, the absorption spectrum of a dilute CHCl3 solution of both the random and block copolymer showed an absorption maximum (λmax) at 444 nm, while a thin film spin coated from a CHCl3 solution had λmax at 516 nm, with an optical band gap of 1.9 eV (Fig. S2†).
The photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated with a conventional device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al, where poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and lithium fluoride were used to ease hole and electron extraction, respectively. The active area of the devices was 0.26 cm2, three devices of each composition were fabricated and their short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated from J–V curves. The active layers were spin-coated from ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solutions of polymer and PC61BM. A control device ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al was also fabricated and tested, in order to minimize variation in the results that might arise due to different processing conditions. The rrP3HT was purchased from Aldrich, electronic grade quality. Both sets of BHJ devices (control and copolymers:PC61BM) were fabricated and characterized during the same batch processing. Details on device fabrication and characterization are provided in the Experimental section.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics of the polymer solar cells under the AM 1.5 spectrum at 1000 W m−2. Table 1 summarizes the device performance data. All the copolymers show excellent photovoltaic properties with an overall power conversion efficiency over 4%. Both random and block copolymers exhibited an open circuit voltage (0.6–0.7 V) comparable to those of P3HT (0.6 V), which is consistent with their relative HOMO levels (Fig. S3†).

Among all the amphiphilic copolymers, P3HT-bb-P3AcidHT showed the best performance with a PCE of 4.2%, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.0 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.60, while its analogous random copolymer only exhibited a PCE of 1.3% with a Voc of 0.66 V, Jsc of 4.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.44. The control device exhibited a Voc of 0.62 V, a Jsc of 12.66 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.45, and a PCE of 3.24%. As a result, the efficiency of the best performing device showed a 30% improvement compared to the control device. To study the effects of the composition of the photoactive material on the photovoltaic parameters, two blends of P3HT-b-P3AcidHT:PC61BM with different compositions (1:1 and 1:2 weight/weight) were investigated. The thickness of the active layer film was approximately 100 nm for all the blends. The 1:1 ratio was found to give the best performance. Also the thickness of the active layer was systematically varied between 100 and 260 nm by adjusting the spin rate during the coating process, while keeping the same P3HT-b-P3AcidHT:PC61BM ratio (1:1). Despite some spreading in the data, a clear trend is observed: the performance gradually decreases while increasing the film thickness, mainly as a result of lowered current densities.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses were carried out to investigate the self-assembly and film morphology of the blended system. As shown in Fig. 5, the surface of the P3HT-b-P3AcidHT:PC61BM blend film on the ITO/PEDOT, substrate annealed at 120 °C, is quite smooth, with a root-mean-square roughness of 0.7 nm. One can clearly observe well-defined interfaces where the phase separation within the P3HT-b-P3AcidHT:PC61BM appears as bright and dark regions, which are attributed to copolymer-rich and PC61BM-rich domains, respectively. The average domain size is estimated to be 11 nm, close to the exciton diffusion length.4 The fine phase separation confirms the intimate mixing of P3HT-bb-P3AcidHT and PC6161BM at the nanoscale. Nevertheless, the surface of the random copolymer, P3HT-co-P3EtPT:PC61BM blend, is much rougher, with an rms roughness of 7.4 nm (Fig. S4†). The large domains (larger than 100 nm) on the surface of the film indicate a non-optimal morphology, which is not favorable for charge separation and thus limits the efficiency of the resulting devices.

The reduced domain size and finer nanoscale morphology of P3HT-b-P3AcidHT:PC61BM suggest a stronger interchain interaction between the P3HT-bb-P3AcidHT and PC6161BM chains, which is primarily due to the presence of polyacid blocks in the copolymer that are capable of forming hydrogen bonds between the carboxy-alkyl chains and the ester groups of PC61BM. Evidence for hydrogen bonds in BHJ of regioregular poly(3-(carboxyalkyl)thiophene):PC61BM has been recently discussed and investigated through infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.22 In this case, the polymer domain size was estimated to be 10 nm.
Conclusions
We have developed a straightforward and simple method to introduce carboxy-terminated chains into highly regioregular copolymers of 3-hexylthiophene, by GRIM reaction, and synthesized a series of random and diblock copolymers on 3-hexylthiophene and a new thiophene derivative (propyl-5-(2-(thiophen-3-yl)ethoxy) pentanoate), bearing an acidic function protected as propyl ester.
The corresponding acids were easily prepared by saponification in THF. An alternative synthetic strategy, based on the post-functionalization of a copolymer (P3HT-bb-P3BrPT), obtained from a bromo-terminated alkyl-thiophene, was also explored. All the copolymers, blended with PC61BM, were tested in photovoltaic devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al). Among the amphiphilic copolymers, P3HT-bb-P3AcidHT showed the best performance with a PCE of 4.2%, open-circuit voltage of 0.60 V, short-circuit current density of 13.0 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 0.60. This higher performance can be rationalised in terms of an improved interaction between the acid functions of P3HT-bb-P3AcidHT and PC6161BM, thanks to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carboxy-alkyl chains and the ester group of PC61BM.
Experimental
Materials

          2,5-Dibromo-3-hexythiophene was prepared as described in the literature. 3-Thiophene ethanol, 5-bromovaleric acid, [1,3-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)propane]dichloro-nickel(II), (Ni(dppp)Cl2), and isopropyl magnesium bromide were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out with oven-dried glassware, in dry solvents and under argon atmosphere, unless otherwise stated. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (400 MHz) spectrometer; chemical shifts (δ) are given relative to residual solvent peaks. UV-visible absorption spectra were collected with a Cary-Varian spectrophotometer. Molecular weights (Mws) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) were measured by GPC on a Model Dionex UltiMate 3000, equipped with a pump, an absorbance detector (UV, λ = 254 nm), a pre-column filter and polystyrene gel columns based on a conventional calibration curve using polystyrene standards. THF was used as a carrier solvent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at room temperature.
Monomer and copolymers synthesis

Synthesis of 5-(2-(thiophen-3-yl)ethoxy)pentanoic acid. 
To a solution of 5-bromovaleric acid (8.5 g, 47 mmol) in 100 mL of freshly distilled THF cooled to −78 °C under argon in a 500 mL three-necked flame-dried round-bottom flask was slowly added sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil, 1.9 g, 47 mmol) with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred at −78 °C until completion of H2 emission. In a separate flask, to a solution of 3-thiophene-ethanol (5 g, 39 mmol) in 150 mL of freshly distilled THF under argon was slowly added sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil, 2.8 g, 70 mmol) with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature until completion of H2 emission. The solution of sodium 5-bromovalerate was then slowly added to the solution of sodium 3-thiopheneethanolate and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and for 15 h at 80 °C under argon.

Device fabrication and characterization
All the bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells were prepared using the same preparation procedures and device fabrication procedure referring to as follows: the glass-indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (obtained from Xinyan Technologies (inf. 20 Ω sq−1)) were first patterned by acid etching. Before processing, the patterned ITO glass was cleaned by sonification, first in a microelectronic detergent, then in de-ionized water for 45 minutes, and finally rinsed by acetone and isopropyl alcohol. After drying by blowing nitrogen gas, substrates were irradiated in the UV–ozone chamber for 15 minutes. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron 4083) was filtered through a 0.4.μm filter before being deposited on ITO with a thickness of around 40 nm by spin coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s in the nitrogen atmosphere, and dried at 108 °C for 2 min inside a glovebox. Then, for an active layer, the copolymer:PC61BM in an ODCB blend of 2.2 weight% was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at a speed rate of 1000 rpm for 45 s on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The films were annealed at 4 desired temperatures for 1 min in a glovebox. The solar cell devices were completed by thermal evaporation of LiF (1.2 nm) and Al (100 nm) under <10−6 Torr pressure. The deposition rates of LiF and Al were 0.1 and 2.5 Å s−1, respectively. The active area of the device is 0.28 cm2. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the polymer photovoltaic cells was conducted by a computer-controlled Keithley 2635 source measurement unit (SMU) with a solar simulator (SolarCell Test 575 from KHS) under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were carried out with a dimension 3000 microscope from Digital Instruments.
