    , Accepted 12th July 2018First published on 13th July 2018AbstractTantalum nitride (Ta3N5) based photoanodes were overlaid with magnesium-doped gallium nitride (Mg:GaN) thin films by using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PCVD) technique, and subjected to photoelectrochemical activity tests, aiming for a negative shift of onset potential for O2 evolution. A remarkable negative shift of the onset potential was observed after annealing Mg:GaN in N2 gas, reaching 0 V vs. RHE, despite a lower photocurrent than that on bare Ta3N5. Mg:GaN annealed in NH3 exhibited an improvement of the photocurrent. A detailed study of the photoelectrochemical performance for various samples and a thorough characterization have revealed the effects of N2/NH3 post annealing on Mg activation/Ta3N5 damage recovery, controlling the onset potential shift and the current density improvement. N2 post annealing shifted the onset potential to 0 V vs. RHE but decreased the current density. On the other hand, NH3 post annealing slightly shifted the onset potential and increased the current density largely. Despite the current density loss, this onset potential shift unlocks the prospect of unassisted photoelectrochemical water splitting on Ta3N5.
Introduction
Solar energy conversion into chemical energy represents a potentially sustainable means of answering the challenge of global energy security and environmental concerns.1–4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting on semiconductor electrodes offers an attractive solution to convert solar energy into hydrogen in the most eloquent ways in terms of chemical robustness, high durability, and technological design for large scale application.1–4 The challenge lies in finding a suitable material for semiconductor electrodes (photoanode and photocathode), which has to fulfill stringent requirements at once: suitable energy band positions, absorption of long wavelength light, efficient charge separation and high catalytic activity.1–4
Numerous materials have been explored as a suitable photoanode candidate. Among them, Ta3N5 has emerged as one of the most attractive materials due to its low band gap energy (2.1 eV) and suitable band positions.5–16 Indeed an optimum PEC performance of Ta3N5 with a current density of 12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE approaching its predicted maximum theoretical current density has been realized.17 However, Ta3N5 suffers from poor stability and high onset potential hindering its practical application.17–22 Removing the oxide layer by chemical treatment (i.e. highly acidic etching) or adding a new surface oxide layer has been found to be an effective way to improve the stability.18,21 Very recently, surface passivation with GaN improved the stability of Ta3N5 for PEC water splitting up to more than 12 hours.19
On the other hand, shifting the onset potential remains a great challenge. Given that the flat-band potential of Ta3N5 predicted by DFT calculation and proven by experiment is more negative than the water reduction potential (ca. 0 vs. NHE), the reported onset potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE is excessively positive.6,8,15,19–22 Despite numerous efforts being made to overcome this issue, the onset potential reported to date is 0.35 V vs. RHE or more positive.20 Additionally, the origin of this improvement is still unclear and the underlying mechanism is not well understood.
In this work, we report the improvement of the onset potential of a Ta3N5 photoanode by Mg:GaN deposition utilizing a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PCVD) method. The highly stable GaN-passivated Ta3N5, mentioned above, was prepared by the electron beam evaporation of Ga oxide and nitridation with NH3. It has been demonstrated that GaN on the Ta3N5 surface acts as a passivation layer, improving the PEC performance and stability.19 However, although the current density is high, the onset potential is still as high as 0.6 V vs. RHE.19 It is suggested that a buried-junction of p-Mg:GaN/n-Ta3N5 would improve the onset potential and durability. Compared to Ga oxide layer nitridation, the PCVD method offers easier control of Mg incorporation as well as the lower temperature of Mg:GaN deposition.
Additionally, another work on the improved current density of the Ta3N5 particulate photoanode with GaN back contact was reported very recently.22 The GaN back contact was deposited by the PCVD method followed by a particle transfer process onto Ti. Henceforward we took a different approach. Mg-doped GaN was deposited on the surface of the Ta3N5 photoanode instead of the back contact, followed by post annealing treatment. The Mg-dopant modified the band positions of GaN, enabling hole transfer from Ta3N5 to GaN and more efficient electron transfer from GaN to Ta3N5. Although the current density decreased, the Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 sample exhibited 0 V vs. RHE or more negative, one of the best ever reported onset potentials on the Ta3N5 photoanode.
Experimental
Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 fabrication
Ta3N5 thin films were prepared by reactive RF magnetron sputtering (ES-250L, Eiko Co.) of TaOδ followed by the nitridation process, as previously reported.19 The Ta metal (10 × 10 × 0.3 mm, 99.95%, Nilaco Co., mirror polished) was used as the substrate and the sputtering target was a Ta metal disk (99.9%, High Purity Chemicals Co.). Prior to the sputtering process, the Ta target was pre-sputtered in Ar for 5 min to remove the surface oxide layer. The TaOδ precursor was fabricated by first evacuating the sputtering chamber to <10−6 Pa and then feeding O2 gas into the chamber to increase the pressure to 5 × 10−3 Pa. Following this, the chamber was evacuated to 10−6 Pa prior to starting the sputtering process and applying the sputtering conditions consisting of a 30 sccm (=standard (i.e., at 0.103 MPa and 298 K) cm3 min−1) Ar flow at an RF power of 70 W for 2.5 h. The pressure inside the chamber during sputtering was carefully maintained at 4 Pa by adjusting the opening of the valve between the chamber and the vacuum pump. The thickness of each sputtered TaOδ film was measured using a stylus film thickness profiler (Alpha-Step D100, KLA Tencor Co.). Finally, the TaOδ/Ta film was nitrided at 1073 K for 1 h in NH3 (200 sccm) with a temperature ramp of 10 K min−1.
Mg:GaN was deposited on the surface of Ta3N5 by using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PCVD) apparatus (Arios, Inc., Japan). Trimethylgallium (TMG; > 99.999% Ube Industries, Ltd.) at −10 °C as the Ga source and bis(cyclopentadienyl)magnesium(II) (MgCp2) as the Mg source were carried into the deposition chamber with N2 flow (5 mL min−1). Radio frequency plasma was conducted at 1000 W with the additional N2 flow (20 mL min−1). The substrate temperature was set at 600 °C. The Mg:GaN thickness was varied by changing the deposition time (ca. 5–24 min) while the Mg concentration was adjusted by changing the MgCp2 temperature, which is typically in the range of 90–120 °C. The Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 sample was then subjected to N2 or NH3 post annealing treatment. N2 post annealing was conducted at different temperatures from 600–800 °C for 30 min in the presence of 200 mL min−1 N2 flow while NH3 post annealing was done from 800–1000 °C for 1 h in the presence of 200 mL min−1 NH3 flow.
The Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 photoanode was fabricated by simply connecting the backside Ta substrate of the sample to a copper wire with indium solder and covered the unnecessary part with epoxy resin. The GaN/Al2O3 and Mg:GaN/Al2O3 were fabricated by directly connecting the copper wire to the GaN or Mg:GaN film with indium solder and covered the unnecessary part with epoxy resin.
The deposition of CoPi on Ta3N5 and Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 photoanodes was performed in a 0.1 M potassium phosphate (KPi) solution containing 0.5 mM Co(NO3)3 at pH 7 by chronoamperometry with a current density of 15 μA cm−2 for 6 min.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku, MiniFlex300) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 nm) at 30 kV and 10 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi SU-8020.
XPS studies were performed using Al anodes and a Kα-excitation X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operated at 14.6 kV and 4.5 A. During the experiments, the pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained at ∼2 × 10−7 Pa. A prominent peak of C 1s from the adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV was used to calibrate the spectra. The magnesium oxide (MgO) powder and depth profiling of Mg metal spectra were used as standard for Mg 1s and Mg 2p spectra while the gallium oxide (Ga2O3) powder and Ga metal, and GaN Al2O3 (10 min sputtered with Ar) were used as Ga 2p standard for all the samples. Depth profiling was done by Ar bombardment for a sequential time starting from 5 min to 4 × 5 min.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were observed using a JEOL JEM-2800. STEM-EDS was performed using an X-MAX 100TLE SDD detector (Oxford Instruments).
Band diagram assessment
The band gap energy of Mg:GaN/Al2O3 was estimated by extrapolation to zero on the X axis of the Tauc's plot. The Tauc's plot was obtained from the values of transmittance and reflectance in the range of 200–800 nm, measured by an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (JASCO V-670) at room temperature. Photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) was utilized to estimate the valence band (EVB) of the samples. Polycrystalline Au EVB was estimated using a similar apparatus in order to check the accuracy of our measurement. For the sake of comparison, the EVB of commercially available n-GaN/sapphire (Si-doped, Suzhou Nanowin Science and Technology Co.,Ltd.) and p-GaN/sapphire (Mg-doped, Suzhou Nanowin Science and Technology Co.,Ltd.) were also measured. The thickness of the Si:GaN/sapphire sample is 4.5 μm with a dopant density of 1 × 1018 cm−3 and a resistivity of 0.05 Ω cm while the Mg:GaN/sapphire has 4.5 μm thickness, 6 × 1016 cm−3 donor density, and 1 × 102 V s mobility.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to estimate the flat-band potential of the prepared samples. The electrolyte used for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic investigations was a 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH = 13). The measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode single electrochemical cell. An Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt wire were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Impedance spectra were recorded between 500 Hz and 2 kHz, and the amplitude of the superimposed sinusoidal potential signal was 20 mV for each of the 30 steps in the potential window starting from 1 to −0.4 V vs. RHE. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots will only depict the potential window in which the faradaic current remains negligible in accordance with cyclic voltammetry (−0.2 to 1 V vs. RHE).
PEC and IPCE measurements
PEC measurements were conducted using a three-electrode system potentiostat (HSV-120, Hokuto). The Mg:GaN/Ta3N5/Ta photoanode, an Ag/AgCl electrode (in saturated KCl), and a Pt wire were used as working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, all the working electrodes used for PEC measurements were coated with the CoPi cocatalyst. The electrolyte used for the measurements is 100 mL of 0.5 M K2HPO4 solution at pH 13 (KOH adjusted). All the measurements were conducted under Ar gas flow. The potential against the reference electrode (EAg/AgCl) was converted into a potential with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (ERHE) by using an equation shown below: ERHE = EAg AgCl + 0.197V + 0.0592 × pH(1)
The photocurrent was recorded using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 10 mV S−1 under the full-light irradiation of an AM 1.5G solar simulator (San-EI Electric, XES-40S) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, unless otherwise stated.
The wavelength dependence of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by chronoamperometry (CA) measurement at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 0.5 V vs. RHE and 0.2 V vs. RHE under monochromatic light irradiation. The Xe lamp (Xe 302) equipped with bandpass filters was used as the light source and the intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode. The IPCE at a given wavelength was estimated on the basis of the following equation: IPCE = [(1240/λ) × (Jlight − Jdark)/Plight] × 100%(2)
Results and discussion
Characterization
The morphology and elemental composition of Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 before and after post annealing are compared in Fig. 1 and Table S1,† respectively. The SEM image shows that Mg:GaN is uniformly deposited on the surface of Ta3N5 with a particle size of ca. 70 nm. Similar uniform Mg:GaN distribution and particle size was kept upon N2 post annealing, whereas it significantly changed after NH3 post annealing. NH3 post annealing at 1000 °C resulted in bigger and agglomerated particles with some new pinholes through the Mg:GaN layer on the surface of Ta3N5.
 Fig. 1  SEM image of Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 (a) as-prepared, (b) N2 post annealed at 800 °C (c) NH3 post-annealed at 800 °C, (d) NH3 post-annealed at 900 °C, and (e) NH3 post-annealed at 1000 °C. The scale bars correspond to 500 nm. 
A closer look on the SEM images of the NH3 post annealed sample at different temperatures (Fig. 1c–e) reveals a clear development of particle size and agglomeration which started from 900 °C. Similarly, the elemental composition of the sample did not change with N2 post annealing. On the other hand, after NH3 post annealing, Mg and O were significantly reduced to more than half of their initial amounts (Table S1†).
The XRD patterns of Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 were recorded for different Mg:GaN thicknesses, from 50 to 500 nm (see ESI, Fig. S1a.†). It is clearly seen that the Ta3N5 pattern matches monoclinic Ta3N5 (PDF card – 01-089-5200) and the Ta3N5 phase was maintained after Mg:GaN deposition. The GaN peaks were absent for the sample with a Mg:GaN thickness of 50–100 nm and a new additional peak at 2θ = 34.5° started to appear for the sample with the Mg:GaN thickness more than 300 nm. This new additional peak is thus assigned to wurtzite GaN with (0 0 2) orientation (PDF card – 01-070-2544). To compare the XRD patterns of the samples with different Mg concentrations, the direct observation of Mg:GaN diffraction peaks on Ta3N5 is difficult due to overlapping of some peaks. Hence, we compare the peak at 2θ = 34.5° of the XRD pattern of Mg:GaN deposited on Pyrex glass (Fig. S1b†). With increasing Mg concentration, the peak shifts to a lower angle indicating the lattice expansion induced by increased average ionic radius (0.136 nm for Mg and 0.126 nm for Ga). The crystallinity of the samples declined judged from the peak intensity reduction as more Mg was added.

Fig. 2a and b compare the XRD patterns of 100 nm Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 subjected to post annealing at different temperatures under N2 and NH3 flow, respectively. Similarly, there was no change in the Ta3N5 phase and no GaN peak was observed for the 100 nm sample after N2 post annealing, in good agreement with the SEM image. In the case of NH3 post annealing, a pronounced [0 0 2] GaN peak at 2θ = 34.5° appeared after post annealing at 1000 °C, consistent with its larger particle size evidenced from SEM images.

The chemical states and distribution of the elements in the Mg:GaN layer on Ta3N5 were also extensively examined by XPS (ESI, Fig. S2 and S3†). The Ga 2p3/2 peaks are positioned at 1117.5 eV of the binding energy, close to that of typical GaN films grown by thermal CVD.23 All Mg:GaN Ta3N5 samples exhibited the XPS O 1s signal and Mg 1s signal shifted to lower binding energy, indicating the existence of MgO or Mg2+ and O2− homogeneously distributed in GaN. For the NH3-post annealed samples, a weak Ta 4f signal was observed, corresponding to the pinholes seen in the microscopic images. Ar-bombardment-aided XPS depth profiling was performed on a N2-post annealed sample. Within the GaN layer, Mg, Ga, N and O were homogeneously distributed along the depth direction.
STEM observation and EDS elemental mapping were utilized to investigate the crystal structure and the elemental composition throughout Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 before and after post annealing. Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional STEM images and elemental mapping of the N2 post annealed sample (see ESI Fig. S4† for the as-prepared one). The Mg:GaN layer was successfully deposited on and firmly attached to the Ta3N5 surface with a uniform thickness of 120 nm. No alteration was noted after N2-post annealing. Similarly, 120 nm Mg:GaN remains firmly attached to the Ta3N5 surface, in accordance with their SEM images and XRD results. The EDS Ga signal was detected constantly above the upper part and the Ta signal is confined to the lower part. A closer look into the EDS line scan (ESI, Fig. S5†) shows that the Ga signal gradually decreased from 80 nm within the span of the interface roughness. A Mg concentration of 1.3 wt% (ESI, Table S1†) was detected by averaging all the mapped signals in the Mg:GaN region. The strong O signal on the EDS line scan and elemental mapping suggests that Mg:GaN is partially oxidized in accordance with the low N signal in this region. For N2-annealed 100 nm Mg:GaN/Ta3N5, highly crystalline Mg:GaN grains were discerned by HRTEM near the interface with Ta3N5. (ESI, Fig. S6†).

Band diagram assessment
To elucidate the effect of Mg:GaN deposition on Ta3N5, the band diagram of Mg:GaN and Ta3N5 before and after N2/NH3 post annealing was assessed by means of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA), and Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis. First, the band gaps of the samples are estimated from the Tauc's plot by plotting the transmittance values against reflectance values of the sample. The band gap energy of Mg:GaN/Al2O3 for different Mg concentrations and 3 wt% Mg:GaN/Al2O3 before and after post annealing treatment were obtained (ESI, Fig. S7†). No significant difference was observed for the various Mg doping levels nor for post annealing treatment. The band gap energy for all samples is in the range of 3.2–3.4 eV, in good agreement with the reported value of Mg:GaN.19,25–27
Next, the top of the valence band (EVB) for each sample was estimated by PESA (ESI, Fig. S8†). To check the accuracy of our instrument, we initially did work function measurement of polycrystalline Au. The PESA spectrum shows the threshold energy of 4.91 eV for Au work function, in good agreement with the reported value.28,29 The PESA spectrum of Ta3N5 with EVB of 6.1 eV fairly agrees with the previous reports (5.9 eV).5,30 This value is also in accordance with the reported EVB measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).5 The threshold value of undoped GaN/Al2O3 shows EVB of 6.40 and shifts to 6.05 eV on 3 wt% Mg doping. Increasing the Mg concentration to 5 wt% resulted in further EVB shift up to 5.76 eV. Our measurement on highly crystalline epitaxed GaN/sapphire also shows that the EVB position changes according to the dopant type. Si-doped GaN/sapphire shows the EVB of 6.33 eV and shifts to 6.02 eV with the Mg dopant. The PESA spectra of Mg:GaN/Al2O3 before and after post annealing show that the EVB slightly shifts to a lower energy of 5.9 eV upon N2 post annealing, whereas it shifts to a higher energy of 6.24 eV after NH3 post annealing.
The Efb values of the prepared samples were estimated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The M–S plots of Ta3N5, GaN/Al2O3, and Mg:GaN/Al2O3 (before and after N2 or NH3 treatment) were recorded at frequencies in the range of 0.5–2 kHz (ESI, Fig. S9a–e†). Ta3N5 shows the Efb value of −0.03 V vs. RHE, in a fairly good agreement with those reported in the literature.3,5,15,30 The as-prepared Mg:GaN/Al2O3 shows the Efb value of −0.06 V vs. RHE and shifted to a more negative value upon N2 post annealing (−0.16 V vs. RHE) and NH3 post annealing (ca. −0.33 V vs. RHE). In general, the Efb of nitride materials follows the Nernst's equation.14,23,27,30,31 It is thus acceptable to regard the Efb obtained in these measurements as 0 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 0. On the basis of all band properties obtained from UV-Vis, PESA, and EIS measurements, the band diagram for all the samples is illustrated in Fig. 4. It is clearly seen that in Mg-doped GaN, the Efb position is more positive than that of GaN, closer to the maximum of the valence band. This behavior has been previously reported in the case of p-type Mg-doped GaN in relation to the activation energy of the Mg acceptor.24–26 Although the p-type characteristic was not observed in the M–S plot of our samples, the Mg insertion indeed introduced a new energy level observed as a new Efb. Additionally, in regard with the fact that the dopant in our case is not Mg but Mg–O, a different effect may be thus anticipated.32 Similar to almost all the characterizations presented earlier, no significant alteration was observed after N2 post annealing. The GaN band gap energy was maintained at 3.4 eV, whereas the EVB and the Efb slightly shifted.

It has been reported in the literature that the energy differences of the EVB and EF (i.e. Efb in our measurement) of GaN and Mg:GaN before and after surface cleaning are in the range of 2.4–3 eV and 1.1–1.84 eV, respectively.25 A similar tendency was observed in our samples. GaN (Mg 0 wt%) exhibited EVB − Efb of 2.48 eV while the Mg:GaN samples before and after N2 post annealing showed EVB − Efb of 1.66 eV.
PEC and IPCE measurements
The PEC performance of CoPi/Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 (with 100 nm Mg:GaN thickness) with N2 or NH3 post annealing was investigated for the O2 evolution current. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans in Fig. 5 show that upon N2 post annealing, the onset potential shifted drastically toward 0 vs. RHE. However, the current density decreased more than 20 fold. There was no negative onset potential shift upon NH3 post annealing. However, the current density increased, reaching the original current density of Ta3N5. By magnifying the negative potential region for all three photoanodes (ESI, Fig. S10†), the photocurrent for N2-post annealed Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 definitely maintains a positive value, whereas the others reach the background level in the vicinity of 0.2 V vs. RHE.
 Fig. 5  (a) LSV of Ta3N5 and Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 after N2 and NH3 post annealing, (b) Magnification of N2 post annealed Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 LSV in (a)and (c) IPCE of N2 and NH3 post annealed-Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, (d) IPCE of N2 and NH3 post annealed. 
In order to verify whether the current density measured in LSV is due to the Ta3N5 excitation rather than Mg:GaN or GaN, a control PEC measurement was performed on Si:GaN/sapphire (Al2O3), Mg:GaN/sapphire, and Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 by solar simulator irradiation (ESI, Fig. S11†). Si:GaN or Mg:GaN alone exhibited minute current density compared to those on the Ta3N5 substrate. This is due to the small ultraviolet portion of the incident light that can excite GaN. Also on Mg:GaN/Ta3N5, the application of a UV-cut filter (λ > 420 nm) in front of the solar simulator just slightly weakened the Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 photocurrent. It is confirmed that the visible-light response in the negative potential region is exclusive for the Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 structure. The thin GaN layer alone is not driving the photocurrent in the visible region.
The IPCE at 1.23 V vs. RHE of the N2 post annealed sample is 10 fold lower than those of NH3 post annealed samples in all regions (Fig. 5c). However, it is almost comparable at 0.5 vs. RHE (Fig. 5d). Remarkably, the N2 post-annealed sample still had detectable IPCE values of 0.12% (420 nm) and 0.02% (540 nm) at 0.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5d). Note that the IPCE values for both the samples in all applied potentials coincide with Ta3N5 absorption which further confirms that the PEC performance is due to Ta3N5 excitation.
The effects of PCVD synthetic conditions and post annealing treatment were assessed by varying the Mg:GaN thickness, Mg concentration, and post annealing temperature (Fig. S12†). In the case of the N2 post annealed sample, increasing Mg concentration and Mg:GaN thickness essentially causes a negative onset potential shift (Fig. S12b†). However, more severe current density decline is also observed. The optimum condition is obtained for 2.8 wt% Mg concentration with 100 nm Mg:GaN thickness, and the post annealing condition of 800 °C for 1 h.
For NH3 post annealing, a higher temperature of 1000 °C for 30 min was found to be the optimum condition. With increasing Mg concentration and Mg:GaN thickness, the onset potential shifted to 0.35 V vs. RHE while the current density decreased to 1.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.
The trend of current density decrease after Mg:GaN deposition is probably due to two-fold reasons; the Ta3N5 phase change upon plasma exposure under N2 flow at high temperature, and highly resistive Mg:GaN. Although the XRD pattern did not show any traces of Ta3N5 phase change, alteration on the buried Ta3N5 surface presumably occurs. Ta3N5 generally undergoes phase change to subnitrides such as TaN, Ta2N, or Ta4N6 at high temperature under vacuum or inert gas flow (N2 or Ar).13,16,33 Indeed, the PEC measurement of bare Ta3N5 treated in a similar condition in the PCVD chamber but without flowing Mg and Ga precursors (Fig. S13†) exhibited more than two fold current density decrease. Further N2 post annealing aggravated the surface phase change and led to a severe loss of current density (0.4 V mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE). In these methods, high temperature treatment in general damages Ta3N5 from the surface.
This complication of LSV performance arises probably because the N2 post annealing process is critical in order to activate Mg. It is suggested that Mg:GaN synthesized by the metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method, which is almost similar to our process, is highly resistive unless followed by post annealing treatment.34–39 N2 or O2 post annealing treatment is an effective method to activate Mg:GaN by breaking the highly resistive Mg–H complex.33–35 The presence of Mg–H is typically characterized by its Raman or photoluminescence spectra.24,34–39 Due to the presence of Ta3N5, it is rather difficult to trace the presence of the Mg–H complex in our synthesized samples.
Upon N2 post annealing treatment, the Efb shifted to a more negative value of −0.16 V vs. NHE. These conditions are favorable for the negative onset potential shift of Mg:GaN/Ta3N5. The Efb of Mg:GaN, higher by 0.1 V than the Efb of Ta3N5, facilitates effective electron transfer from Mg:GaN to Ta3N5. Additionally, Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 possesses an EVB higher by 0.25 V than that of Ta3N5. This favors faster hole transfer from Ta3N5 to Mg:GaN.
Furthermore, since the STEM/EDS analysis indicates that Mg is in the GaN layer in contact with the Ta3N5 layer, one might assume that the onset potential shift is due to the Mg-doped Ta3N5. However, our control experiment on only Mg/Ta3N5 (i.e. 2.5 wt% Mg, deposited directly onto Ta3N5 by PCVD) showed that the photocurrent was depleted and the onset potential was 0.4 V vs. RHE or more positive (ESI, Fig. S11a†). Hence, we conclude that the drastic onset potential shift is due to the synergetic effects of Mg:GaN and Ta3N5. The current density of Mg-free GaN/Ta3N5 decreased more than 20 fold which is most likely due to the Ta3N5 surface damage while the onset potential is slightly shifted as the effect of the EVB and Efb differences.
NH3 post annealing was demonstrated to increase the current density of the sample without onset potential shift, which is probably due to accumulated effects evidenced from its distinct characterization results. First, the surface damage of Ta3N5 is recovered and the new pinhole appeared on the surface of Mg:GaN thus the PEC performance is solely coming from Ta3N5. The shift of EVB to a more positive value seems to be an effect of the loss of Mg concentration, resembling undoped GaN.
To validate the mechanisms of Mg activation with N2 post annealing and Ta3N5 damage recovery with NH3 post annealing, N2-post annealed samples were subjected to NH3 treatment, or vice versa. Interestingly, the PEC performance of the first-N2-then-NH3 samples was identical to that of just-NH3 samples (ESI, Fig. S14†). Also, the PEC performance of the first-NH3-then-N2 samples is identical to that of just N2 samples. The final treatment exclusively controls whether the Mg activation or Ta3N5 damage recovery, overcoming the effects of foregoing treatment. Knowing the importance of Mg activation without altering the Ta3N5, another approach is attempted by post annealing treatment in static N2 using rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in the IR furnace at 600–700 °C.40 The PEC performance of the NH3–N2 post annealed sample (N2 post annealing in conventional tubular furnace) and the NH3-RTA post annealed sample was compared at different temperatures (Fig. S15†). The best PEC performance was observed after RTA treatment at 600 °C, which realized a current density of 1.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and an onset potential shift of up to 0.3 V vs. RHE. Higher temperatures were found to further decrease the current density without the onset potential shift. The stability of the synthesized samples was investigated at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The results are displayed in Fig. 6. Compared to bare Ta3N5, all Mg:GaN modified samples exhibited slower decay of photocurrent. The current density on bare Ta3N5 drastically decreased and diminished in less than 5 min irradiation while those of the Mg:GaN modified samples maintained 50% of their initial current density even after 60 min of irradiation. The current density of the N2 post annealed sample gradually decreased in first 10 min and reached a stable performance of 0.1 mA cm−2 (i.e. 50% its initial value) in more than 60 min. In the case of the NH3 post annealed sample, the first 10 min shows a relatively faster current density decrease until it reached a stable performance of 1.5 mA cm−2 (i.e. 40% its initial value).

Comparing with GaN/Ta3N5 previously reported by our group,19 the present Mg:GaN/Ta3N5 was less stable although covered with GaN. The discrepancy may come from the different method used for GaN deposition which resulted in different GaN (or Mg:GaN) properties. However, with the excellently negative onset potential, this approach of Mg:GaN deposition is promising. The realization of 0 V vs. RHE onset potential while maintaining the high current density of Ta3N5 PEC water splitting will lead to a breakthrough in the field. The next challenge lies on more controllable Mg:GaN deposition and activation without altering the Ta3N5 phase.
Conclusions
In summary, a negative shift of the onset potential has been realized on Mg:GaN modified-Ta3N5. Detailed studies revealed the correlation of the PEC performance with the results of structural and chemical characterizations. N2 post annealing treatment is a crucial step for further improvement of the onset potential reaching 0 vs. RHE by the Mg activation mechanism. The Mg dopant modified the band positions of the GaN, allowing more favorable hole transfer from Ta3N5 to Mg:GaN, and more efficient electron transfer from Mg:GaN to Ta3N5. The trade-off between the low onset potential and current density decrease is due to the thermally induced damage on Ta3N5 near the surface during the process. The improvement and recovery of the Ta3N5 photocurrent was realized by NH3 post annealing, however, without negative shift of the onset potential.
The negative limit of O2 evolution onset potential that was found this time is below 0 V vs. RHE, which can be predicted from the Ta3N5 electronic band alignment (Fig. 4). Then it will not be in vain to look for a high photocurrent density near 0 V vs. RHE by raising the electronic conductivity, reducing the lattice defects in Ta3N5, or constructing hetero-junctions with Ta3N5 similar to the present case, to promote photo-excited charge separation. The high photocurrent generated by Ta3N5 will be fully utilized for stand-alone sunlight driven water splitting by this approach.
