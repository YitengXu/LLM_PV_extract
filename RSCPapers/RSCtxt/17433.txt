    , Accepted 25th May 2012First published on 30th May 2012AbstractA hierarchical ZnO structure assembled by nanosheets was prepared through a low temperature chemical bath deposition and a growing-melting mechanism was proposed to elucidate the shape evolution. Afterwards, a poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) assisted hydrothermal method was adopted to decorate TiO2 particles onto the ZnO structure. When used in dye-sensitized solar cells, the device employing the hybrid ZnO/TiO2 photoanode exhibited improved short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and filling factor (FF), which resulted in a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.60% in comparison to 1.96% from the pure ZnO cell. Based on the investigation of UV-vis absorption and diffuse-reflection spectra, Mott-Schottky analysis, electronic impedance spectra (EIS) and incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), the effect of TiO2 modification on the photovoltage performances of the ZnO sheet-based hierarchical structures was studied in detail.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) were considered to be a new generation of photovoltage devices for harnessing abundant and green solar energy and many research efforts were devoted to develop such low cost, high efficiency and portable photovoltage devices.1 Heretofore, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼11% has been achieved in TiO2 based DSSC.2–5 In addition to TiO2, a series of transition oxides such as SnO2, Nb2O5 and ZnO were also applied as photoanode materials. Due to the intrinsic incompatibility with the ruthenium-based dyes, the best reported PCE for SnO2 and Nb2O5 merely reached ∼3% and ∼6%, respectively.6,7 Among these candidates, ZnO was regarded as a promising alternative photoanode material. Except the priority of sophisticated crystal engineering strategies, ZnO has a similar band gap but smaller electron mass weight, which leads to over two orders of magnitude higher electron mobility than that of anatase TiO2 in their bulk single-crystal materials.8–10 Therefore, many schemes were adopted to fabricate ZnO structures, such as nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1-D) and hierarchical structures, as the photoanode materials for faster electron transport.
In a nanoparticle photoanode, the photoinduced electrons were injected from the excited dye molecules into the semiconductor and diffuse through the sintered film and finally collected at the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. During this process, the interparticle boundaries are likely to slow down the hopping-mediated electron transport, which inevitably promotes the recombination between the photoinduced electrons and oxidized dyes or the redox species in the electrolyte.11,12Therefore, 1D ZnO rods or tubes arrays, which could significantly reduce the grain boundaries, were adopted to enhance the electron mobility and suppress the surface recombination. However, these 1D structures usually possess a small surface area which causes poor dye loading amounts and low short-circuit current density.13–15
Most recently, different ZnO hierarchical structures were developed to mediate the competition between surface area and electron transport rate. Cao's group has made great progress in the ZnO-based DSSC by using submicro-sized mesoporous spheres as photoanode materials. These hierarchical spheres are comprised of interconnected primary particles with diameters around 18 nm, which could both reduce the crystal boundaries and provide a high surface area for sufficient dye loading. Moreover, the submicro-sized diameter also triggers a scattering effect to improve the harvest of incident light. Therefore, due to these structural advantages, the PCE was promoted to 5.4%.16–19 Moreover, ZnO nanosheet based hierarchical structures were also utilized as the frameworks for photoanode.20,21 Recently, based on these hierarchical structures, the PCE of the ZnO based DSSC were improved to ∼7.5%.22–24 However compared with the TiO2, the ZnO-based photoanode should be further optimized for higher PCE.
ZnO-based materials suffer from intrinsic instability in the acid dye solution and electrolytes, which resulted in low injection efficiencies and a high recombination rate.25–27 Therefore, building oxide barrier layers, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2, were generally used to improve the stability of ZnO structures.28–31 Previously, an Atom Layer Deposition (ALD) technique was applied to fabricate TiO2 shells with different thicknesses on the ZnO array. It was found that the TiO2 coating could greatly improve the Voc and FF of the device. However, a TiO2 layer with low conductivity could hinder the electron transport from the activated dyes to the inner ZnO core. Therefore, the Jsc was reduced when the TiO2 shell became thicker.29 Moreover, an ALD method was also utilized to fabricate ultrathin the TiO2 layer onto the hierarchical ZnO mesoporous spheres, which led to a significant PCE enhancement. It was found that the improvement mainly resulted from the increased Voc, but the Jsc remained almost unchanged.31 Therefore, a ZnO frame structure with TiO2 protecting layer could not only improve the stability of the photoanode but also leads to rapid electron transfer, which makes it a promising hybrid material for high efficiency DSSC. Although ALD method is attractive in precisely controlling the shell thickness, it has many disadvantages including harsh synthetic requirements, intricate procedures and high cost. Therefore, many other techniques such as sol–gel and ultrasonic irradiation assisted dip-coating methods were applied to fabricate ZnO/TiO2 heterostructures to improve their performance in DSSC.32,33
In this study, ZnO sheet-based hierarchical structures were firstly fabricated via a simple chemical bath deposition method and the growth mechanism was investigated. Moreover, a facile hydrothermal method was applied to deposit TiO2 particles on the sheet-based ZnO hierarchical structures. With the synergy effect of the enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF, a conversion efficiency of 3.60% was achieved on the ZnO/TiO2 cell demonstrating ∼80% improvement than the pure ZnO cell, indicating this method could serve as a robust surface treatment to improve the performance of ZnO photoanode. Moreover, the mechanism of PCE enhancement was intensively investigated in terms of light harvest, band edge shift and electron life time of the hybrid photoanode. The enhanced Jsc was found to associate with the TiO2 modification which could both increase the dye loading amount and suppress the surface recombination. While the Voc improvement resulted from the upward shift of the quasi-Fermi level of the hybrid film.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of ZnO hierarchical structure
Nanosheet-based ZnO hierarchical structures were fabricated in low temperature aqueous solution. Briefly, 4.5 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 4.8 g NaOH were respectively dissolved into 75 mL and 50 mL distilled water to form clear solutions A and B. Then, solution B was added dropwise into solution A under magnetic stirring and the as-formed transparent solution was incubated in 50 °C water bath for 3 h. Afterwards, the white precipitation was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 2 h.
In the temperature controlled experiments, the reaction time was adjusted to generate high quality products. For the room temperature (∼15 °C), 30 °C and 40 °C reactions, the durations were respectively prolonged to 24 h, 12 and 6 h. For the 60 °C reaction, the reaction time remained at 3 h.
2.2 Preparation of the ZnO/TiO2 heterostructures
To prepare ZnO/TiO2 heterostructures, 0.1 mL titanium n-butoxide (TBT) was diluted into 49.9 mL absolute ethanol and 15 g L−1 poly(vinylpyrrolidone) PVP aqueous solution was also prepared and stocked for later use. To prepare ZnO with low TBT dosage (ZT-1), 0.05 g of ZnO hierarchical structures were dispersed into 25.5 mL ethanol by ultrasonic irradiation. Then 2 mL 15 g L−1 PVP aqueous solution was added and the mixture was immersed in a 0 °C water bath and stirred for about 30 min. Afterwards, 2.5 mL TBT ethanol solution (containing 5 μL TBT) was slowly added into the suspension under stirring and the temperature was still kept at 0 °C to inhibit the hydrolysis of Ti precursor. After another 30 min stirring, the suspension was sealed in 40 mL autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 3 h. The white precipitation was collected via centrifugation and washed several times with distilled water and ethanol. Finally, the product was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 2 h. To prepare ZnO with high TBT dosage (ZT-2), the ZnO was firstly dispersed into the mixture of 23 mL ethanol and the TBT dosage was changed to 5 mL (containing 10 μL TBT). The other experimental parameters were kept unchanged.
2.3 Fabrication of the DSSC
A traditional doctor blade method was used to fabricate the photoanodes. To prepare the slurry, hydroxypropyl cellulose was firstly mixed with diethylene glycol with a concentration of ∼10 wt%. Then, the ZnO/TiO2 products were added into the mixture with a ratio of ∼40 wt% and the suspension was stirred until homogenous and a sticky slurry was yielded. Next, the slurry was spread onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (TEC-8, LOF) with adhesive tape to provide an uncoated area. After being dried in air, the films were sintered at 450 °C for 40 min. These as-prepared photoanode films are all ∼15 μm in thickness. After being cooled to 80 °C, the films were sensitized in 0.3 mM cis-bis (isothiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719) ethanol solution for different durations (40 min for ZnO, 60 min for ZT-1 and ZT-2). The films were then sandwiched together with a platinized FTO counter electrode and the electrolyte was then injected into the cell from the edges by capillarity (active area is 4 mm × 4 mm). The content of electrolyte was 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M 4-terbutylpyridine and 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodiode (PMII) in 3-mathoxyproprionitrile.
2.4 Measurement of the DSSC
Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements of the DSSC were performed on Keithley 4200 sourcemeter using simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 (one sun light intensity) produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). Mott-Schottky plots were measured with a three-electrode system, using the as-prepared semiconductor film as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode, and Saturated calomel electrodes (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 3 M KCl. Mott-Schottky spectra were obtained with Frequency Response Detector (FRD 100) and Potentiostat/Galvanostat Model 283 System (Princeton Applied Research). The potential was systematically varied between +1.00 and −1.00 V with the frequency of 1000 Hz by choosing Mott-Schottky technique template. Incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 sourcemeter under the irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out under open-circuit condition using a potentiostat (EG&G, M283) equipped with a frequency response detector (EG&G, FRD100). The spectra were scanned in a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 10 mHz at room temperature. The alternating voltage amplitude was set at 10 mV.
2.5 Characterizations
The morphologies and structures of the samples were characterized by scanning electronic microscope (SEM, JSM-7401F, JEOL) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford, INCA MICSF+), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai F30) and X-ray powder diffraction (Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542 nm, 40 kV, 100 mA). The UV-vis absorption and the diffuse-reflection spectra were measured by UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-4100).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure, growth mechanism and morphology control
The SEM image displayed in Fig. 1a shows the sheet-based hierarchical ZnO structure are about 1–2 μm in diameter. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the structures are assembled by sheet-like sub-unit which are about 10–20 nm in thickness and intersected with each other. Fig. 1c shows the TEM image of an individual hierarchical structure. The rod-like patterns reveal the thickness of the sheets (“d” area, corresponding to the side view of the sheet), while the semitransparent patterns are the sheets with horizontal position (“e” area, corresponding to the top view of the sheet). The HRTEM characterizations of “d” and “e” area are shown in Fig. 1d and 1e. From the side view, the interplanar spacing could be measured as 0.28 nm which is in accordance with the lateral growth direction of wurtzite structured ZnO. On the other hand, the top view shows the interplanar spacing is 0.26 nm, indicating the sheet is single crystal, stretching along the C-axis and exposing a large percentage of nonpolar facets. According to the previous literature, the ZnO sheet with single crystalline structure may help to benefit the electron transport due to the diminished crystal boundaries.34 Based on the EDX analysis of the ZnO hierarchical structures, except the Si characteristic peak deriving from the substrate, no impurity element is detected indicating the high purity of the sample (Fig. S1, ESI†). Moreover, the XRD diffraction peaks of the ZnO hierarchical structure match well with the standard values (JCPDS card No. 36-1451, space group P63mc), suggesting the product is of high quality and wurtzite structure (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Many schemes have been used to prepare metal oxides with hierarchical structures. However, intricacy fabricating process, toxic reaction medium or organic directing regent is generally used to achieve the assembling of the primary units.35–38 In our case, the ZnO hierarchical structure was prepared via a simple chemical bath deposition without using any organic additive. The growth mechanism of the nanosheet-based hierarchical ZnO structures was investigated through a series of time dependent trails. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the intermediate samples collected at different reaction times. As shown in Fig. 2a, after 30 min, ZnO rods and sheets-like structures are observed. Some of them are aggregated into flower-like structures and the overall diameter of the aggregates is less than 1 μm. When the reaction time was carried out to 1 h, sheet-based aggregates are formed. Meanwhile, it is interesting to find many secondary rod-like structures emerge on the ZnO sheets (highlighted with white arrows in Fig. 2b). As time reached the 2 h mark, the majority of secondary rods had melted together to form sheet-like patterns, and complicated hierarchical structures with interlaced nanosheets are formed (Fig. 2c). At this stage, ZnO rods could still be detected and experience obvious growth both in length and diameter. When the reaction reached 2.5 h, nanosheets with zigzag edges are observed as the building units for the hierarchical ZnO structures (Fig. 2d). Until the reaction reached 3 h, the nanosheet-based hierarchical ZnO structures were finally obtained. Zn(NO3)2 + NaOH → Zn(OH)2−4(1) (2) (3)

Based on these observations, a growing–melting mechanism was proposed and illustrated in Fig. 2e. At the initial stage, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH were mixed to generate a transparent Zn(OH)2−4 precursor in aqueous solution (eqn (1)).39 Afterwards, the slow decomposition of the precursor generated numerous ZnO nuclei (eqn (2)). Subsequently, the first formed ZnO nuclei aggregated together, and the anisotropic growth of wurtzite ZnO led to the formation of rod arrays. As time proceeded, the ZnO rods taking a growth direction along the C-axis grew both in diameter and length, which finally linked them together. To reduce the overall surface, the as-linked rod arrays were likely to melt together and the corner and edge at the boundaries were gradually abraded. Finally ZnO nanosheets were formed with single crystal structures, which possessed the most ordered structure and lowest free energy. During the melting process, secondary rod-arrays also formed using the lateral planes of the melting rods as substrates. Subsequently, the secondary rods would melt again and trigger the next round of growth. The growing–melting process repeated several times to finally shape the hierarchical ZnO structures assembled by interlaced nanosheets. In a word, the growing–melting mechanism is a downhill process, during which the thermal unstable Zn(OH)2−4 precursor was transformed into the hierarchical ZnO structures assembled by single crystal nanosheets.
It was also found that the reaction temperature have crucial importance over the formation of this hierarchical ZnO structure. As displayed in Fig. 3a, when the temperature was reduced to room temperature (∼15 °C), orthorhombic Zn(OH)2 (JCPDS card No.76-1778) octahedrons with a diameter of ∼30 μm are formed (Fig. S3, ESI†). At room temperature, the Zn(OH)2−4 precursor cannot be fully decomposed to generate the ZnO, and lead to the formation of Zn(OH)2, which concurs with our early results (eqn (3)).40 If the bath temperature was set at 30 °C, as-displayed in Fig. 3b, large ZnO rods, ∼10 μm in length and ∼500 nm in diameter, are generated. The inset shows the rod has a rectangular cross section and flat tips, which probably derives from the fact that low temperature dismisses the priority of anisotropic growth along the C-axis and the growth over the lateral facets is relatively promoted.41 Moreover, when the temperature is slightly increased to 40 °C, flower-like structures with diameter of ∼5 μm are observed (Fig. 3c). From the inset magnified image, the ZnO rods all have sharp tips, which result from the rapid growth of the (0001) facet, indicating the anisotropic growth habit is recovered. The temperature was further elevated to 60 °C, similar sheet-based hierarchical structures are formed (Fig. 3d). However, from the magnified image, the sheets are thinner and some parts of the sheet are etched to form many holes, suggesting that the melting effect becomes more remarkable under higher temperatures.

3.2 Decoration with TiO2 particles
ZnO sheet-based three-dimensional structures were previously prepared through different methods.42–45 However, except several examples, they were seldom used in DSSC.20,46–48In our work, the as-prepared hierarchical ZnO structures were used as photoanode material in DSSC. In order to improve the performance, a facile method was adopted to decorate TiO2 particles on the ZnO surface. In the reaction system, due to the strong coordination bond arising from the partial donation of the lone pair of electrons of the O/N atoms to the vacant orbit of the Zn atoms, the PVP could selectively adhere to the ZnO surface.49–51 After the TBT was introduced, the Ti species were enriched on the ZnO surface through the coordination effect of PVP. Moreover, the low temperature (0 °C) could inhibit the hydrolysis of Ti precursor. When the temperature was elevated to 180 °C, the TiO2 particles were generated on the ZnO surface. Moreover, according to Lou's work, the space hindrances of these as-adsorbed PVP molecules may also function as a template to form a porous TiO2 layer.49

Fig. 4 depicts the TEM images of the TiO2 decorated ZnO sheets prepared with low (ZT-1) and high (ZT-2) TBT dosage. Fig. 4a shows the sheet-based hierarchical structures are well preserved after TiO2 modification. Fig. 4b displays a sheet observed from the side view. The rough surface indicates the sheet is coated with small particles. While Fig. 4c gives a top view of the sheet, which clearly reveals many small particles are formed and closely linked to the sheet. The HRTEM image displayed in Fig. 4d indicates the as-generated particles have a diameter of ∼5 nm. Moreover, the interplanar spacing is measured as 0.32 nm, suggesting the particles are anatase TiO2. Fig. 4e and f respectively show the side and top view images of ZT-2 prepared with high TBT dosage. The side view indicates the surface of the ZnO sheet is partially etched and deformed during the modification process. While the top view reveals many large TiO2 particles were generated on the ZnO surface and aggregated together leaving a large area of ZnO surface uncovered. Because of the evaluated Ti precursor concentration, the hydrolysis became more rapid, which sabotaged the directing function of PVP and finally generated large TiO2 particles. Owing to the low TBT dosage of the two samples, no obvious diffraction peaks belonging to TiO2 were detected in the XRD patterns for ZT-1 and ZT-2 (Fig. S2 ESI†).31 However, based on the EDX analysis, Ti characteristic peaks could be clearly detected for ZT-1 and ZT-2, which further confirms the existence of the TiO2 particles (Fig S1, ESI†).

3.3 Photovoltage performances
The as-prepared pure ZnO hierarchical structure, ZT-1 and ZT-2 were assembled as DSSC to test their conversion performances. The morphology of ZT-1 film is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. S4a† depicts the cross-section of the film, and the thickness is measured as ∼15 μm. Moreover, the surface of the film is displayed in Fig. S4b, no obviously crack is observed. The inset image indicates the hierarchical structures are well-preserved after ultrasonic irradiation, vigorous stirring and high temperature calcination involved in the fabricating process.
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves measured under one sun are displayed in Fig. 5a, and the detailed performances are listed in Table. 1. When a pure ZnO hierarchical structure is used as the photoanode material, the cell has a low Jsc of 7.8 mA cm−2 and Voc of 598 mV. Therefore, the overall PCE merely reaches 1.96%. After decoration with a layer of TiO2 particles, the Jsc of ZT-1 is increased to 10.79 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the Voc is also enhanced to 642 mV and the PCE rises up to 3.6%. However, for ZT-2, the Jsc and Voc are reduced to a level even lower than the pure ZnO cell. However, the filling factor (FF) is improved from 42.0% to 51.2%. Therefore, the overall PCE of ZT-2 increases to 2.15%. The back current curves were used to evaluate the surface recombination rate of DSSC. As depicted in Fig. 5b, it is obvious that the emerging of the back current in curve ZT-1 is shifted to the high voltage range, indicating the surface recombination is suppressed which results in a higher Voc of ZT-1 than pure ZnO. However, the negative shift of the curve ZT-2 suggests the recombination is promoted. The hydrolysis of TBT could generate H+ into the reaction system, which could impact the surface integrity of the ZnO sheets. Therefore, more surface defects were formed under high TBT dosage, which could serve as the recombination centres and finally decrease the Voc of ZT-2.

Generally, the Voc of DSSC is determined by the offset between the quasi-Fermi level (Ef) and the redox level of electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6a, the UV-vis absorption spectrum is used to investigate the band gap variation of the as-papered samples. Compared with pure ZnO, the absorption edge of ZT-1 exhibits a slight blue shift, indicating a broadening of the band gap. The H+ ions released from the hydrolyzing of TBT may slightly reduce the thickness of ZnO sheets and thereby result in the extending of the band gap due to the size effect. On the contrary, for ZT-2, the greater amounts of H+ lead to a rapid surface etching and bring forth more defects in the ZnO lattice, which partially jeopardizes the crystal integrity. Therefore the absorption experiences a red shift, suggesting the narrowing of the band gap. The band gap variation is generally associated with the shift of conduction band edge (Ecb). Moreover, according to the equation of Ef = Ecb + kbTln(nc/Nc) (where Ecb is the conduction band edge, kbT is the thermal energy, nc is the free electrons density in the conduction band and Nc is the effective density of the conduction band states), the negatively shifted Ecb results in increased Ef.46 Therefore, for ZT-1, the enlarged band gap ascribes to the upward shift of the conduction band edge energy level (Ecb). Because of the lower conductivity of the TiO2, the ZnO core has a higher electron concentration. Under this condition, a build-in potential was induced due to the electron concentration gradient. Therefore, this potential at the ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction could effectively confine the outwards diffusion of the photoinduced electrons, which could further increase the population of free electrons in the conduction band of ZnO.30 Considering, the enhanced states density of free electrons (nc) and the negatively shifted Ecb, the quasi-Fermi level of the hybrid ZnO/TiO2 film is elevated under illumination. Moreover, the Mott-Schottky analysis is a powerful method to determine the flat potential of semiconductor film and to predict the Ef shift. As shown in Fig. 6b, plot ZT-1 is shifted to the negative potential range, suggesting the TiO2 modification could elevate the Ef of the hybrid film. On the contrary, plot ZT-2 is shifted to the positive potential indicating a downward shift of Ef. Therefore, the Mott-Schottky analysis further confirms the elevation of the Ef for ZT-1. Considering the redox level of electrolyte remains unchanged, the Voc of corresponding DSSC was thus increased, which is in accordance with the I–V test.

The reason for Jsc variation is rather multi-folded, which may associate with different factors such as dye loading amount, incident light harvest, and injection/collection efficiencies. Fig. 7a shows the diffuse-reflection spectra of the photoanodes. ZnO and ZT-1 have similar reflectance, indicating that they possess similar film structures. Generally, the reflectance of nanoparticle film experiences drastically decline in the visible region especially in 600–800 nm.52 It is interesting to find a strong reflection peak emerges at 500–700 nm, which may attribute to the unique scattering properties of these hierarchical structures. However, for ZT-2, the reflectance is slightly reduced, because the ZnO framework of ZT-2 is partially deformed in the coating process. The UV-vis absorption spectra of these dye loaded photoanodes are displayed in Fig. 7b. The pure ZnO photoanode has the poorest absorption peak, which results from the low dye loading amount due to the smooth surface. For ZT-1, the surface roughness is enhanced, which gives more anchoring sites for dye molecules. Therefore the absorption peak intensity for ZT-1 is increased. On the other hand, the absorption peak of ZT-2 is enhanced more than ZT-1, indicating more dye molecules are loaded because more TiO2 particles are formed with high TBT dosage. The variation of dye loading amount of the films was further confirmed by the dye desorption experiments, in which the photoanodes loaded with N719 was immersed in 0.1 M NaOH for 20 min and the dye loading amount was evaluated by monitoring the absorbance of the solution. As depicted in Table 1, the dye loading capacity for ZnO is 2.8 × 10−7 mol cm−2. After decoration with TiO2 particles, the value increases to 3.7 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which experiences 39.3% enhancement. For ZT-2, the value further enhances to 4.1 × 10−7 mol cm−2, suggesting that although the high TBT dosage may lead to the formation of larger TiO2 particles, it could finally offer more sites for dye absorption.

However, the greater dye loading amount of ZT-2 did not finally lead to a higher Jsc. Electronic impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the electron recombination of these as-prepared DSSC. The bode plots of the as-obtained EIS data are shown in Fig. 8a, the recombination life time (τe) could be estimated from the following equation: τe = 1/ωmax = 1/2πfmax (where fmax is the maximum frequency of the intermediate frequency peak).53 The fmax value for ZnO and ZT-2 are all located at 13.73 Hz and for ZT-1 is at 4.52 Hz. The as-calculated τe for ZT-1 is 35.2 ms which triples the value of ZnO and ZT-2 (11.5 ms). The result suggests that the recombination is suppressed in ZT-1 and more photoinduced electrons could be collected at the substrate. Therefore, a higher Jsc was achieved. The incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is shown in Fig. 8b, which could provide a straightforward evidence for the Jsc variation. Due to the unique scattering effect of the hierarchical ZnO frameworks, small IPCE peaks are observed in the region of 600–700 nm for all the curves. For ZT-1, the homogeneously decoration of TiO2 particles could both improve the dye loading amount and act as a protection layer to suppress the surface recombination. With this synergy effect, ZT-1 achieves the highest IPCE value over the whole spectrum, which indicates a higher Jsc compared with the other two cells. However, for ZT-2, although the TiO2 aggregates could improve the dye loading amount, the large particles cannot protect the ZnO surface and bring forth more surface defects in the coating process. Therefore, the IPCE curve of ZT-2 is reduced, indicating a low Jsc.

4. Conclusions
Nanosheet-based hierarchical ZnO structures were prepared in low temperature aqueous solution, and a growing–melting mechanism was proposed to elucidate the shape evolution. Afterwards, a facile hydrothermal method was applied to decorate the ZnO sheets with TiO2 particles to enhance the stability and the surface roughness of the hybrid material. Therefore, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of the ZnO/TiO2 based DSSC are greatly improved. Based on the optical and electronic investigations, the Voc improvement was found to attribute to the upward shift of the quasi-Fermi level of the hybrid film and the enhanced Jsc was believed to associate with the double-function TiO2 particles which could both provide a greater surface area for sufficient dye loading and suppress the surface recombination. Moreover, this coating technique is of low cost, simple synthetic procedures, and easy for scaling up, which could be possibly applied for various ZnO structures to improve their DSSC performance.
