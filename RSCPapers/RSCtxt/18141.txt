    , Accepted 20th December 2020First published on 22nd December 2020AbstractThe present investigation deals with Pd NPs casted over Fe2O3 support in formulating Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst with a complete non-Pt and non-carbon approach toward accomplishing the electrocatalysis of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) at the anode and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode in alkaline media for low-temperature fuel cell. The high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for Pd/Fe2O3 with smart intervention of Fe2O3 directly/indirectly in EOR and ORR sequences makes this distinct catalyst a highly preferred choice in direct ethanol fuel cell with respect to reduced polarization loss, substantial current density output, and greater stability compared to the usual Pt or Pd nano-catalysts supported over carbon. Studies involved morphology, which was determined through electron microscopy and electrochemical characterization with the help of potentiodynamic polarization and RDE-RRDE techniques. The catalytic pre-eminence of the nanostructured Pd/Fe2O3 was manifested by the facile electrode kinetics at the anode and the cathode, low yield of H2O2 in ORR, and appreciable power density output of 36.01 mW cm−2 of the complete cell bearing enormous mass activity for both EOR and ORR. This novel attempt of introducing the same robust catalyst at both ends ensures better catalyst utilization, imparts affordability, and avoids carbon corrosion in the fuel cell environment.
1. Introduction
Amongst the promising fuel cell technologies, the direct alcohol fuel cell has emerged as one of the viable energy devices that directly convert the chemical energy of small organic molecules to electrical energy with high power density, appreciable energy efficiency, and low/zero harmful emissions. In particular, the direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) is at present accepted as one of the competitors of the conventional internal combustion engines as well as the typical portable batteries and off-grid power supplies.1–5 Despite such promise, several challenges still exist due to factors such as insufficient durability and the cost involving precious electrocatalysts and membranes. Currently in DEFC, commonly used catalysts are supported on graphitic carbon, which are porous conductive materials with high specific surface area. However, the corrosion of carbon support materials may cause catalyst failure in ambient conditions and consequently dissolution, sintering, and agglomeration of the supported catalyst nano-particles (NPs), thus substantially diminishing the redox kinetics of the fuel cell reactions. Oxidation of the carbon support generates CO2, which results in the exfoliation of the metal NPs from the graphite substrate and the catalyst become electronically isolated. The low utilization of the catalysts therefore reduces overall cell efficiencies and affordability of the device.6–8 In order to mitigate these problems, it is necessary to explore stable alternatives in terms of replacing the carbon support as well as avoiding precious metallic materials as the catalyst component. Rigorous efforts are being made to formulate pluri-metallic NPs involving cheaper and particularly non-Pt catalyst materials as the anode component in ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). In this respect Pd, Ir, Ru alloys and their composites have shown promising candidature for replacing Pt, particularly in alkaline medium.9,10 It may be noted that besides the temperature and pH environment of the fuel cell, the metal–support combination is believed to be a critical factor in order to achieve durability/stability of the device and also to acquire catalytic assistance from the carbon-free supports during the anodic and cathodic reactions. Different categories of materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),11 ceramic oxides (TiO2, CeO2, ZrO2),12–14 transition metal oxide (TMO) such as MoO3,15 WO3,16 MnO2,17 and polymer composites (polyaniline, polypyrrole, poly-N-vinyl-carbazole)18–20 are being tried to find ways to make them preferred catalyst supports, depending on their compatibility with the electrolytic media used. In our earlier studies, MnO2 and polymer composites with MoO3 and V2O5 have been reported as excellent support materials, with positive intervention in the EOR catalysis.20–22 Transition metal carbides, especially W2C and Mo2C, possess superior electrical conductivity and ultrahigh chemical and thermal stabilities, and have been considered as promising support materials in EOR.23,24 Another analogue of graphene, MoS2 has also been explored as a suitable electrode component in alcohol oxidation.25 The outer-layered sulfur atoms usually serve as the active parts of MoS2 that can easily anchor metal-based NPs, thus increasing the catalytic sites. Furthermore, MXene has emerged as an effective 2D material that can be used as a catalyst support as it exhibits desired functional properties and has recently been applied in EOR catalysis.26 The typical formula of MXene is Mn+1XnTx, where M denotes transition metals such as Mo, V, Nb, Ti, or Ta, X represents C or N, and Tx refers to the functional groups on the surface such as –O, –OH, and –F. In addition, 2D metal hydroxides such as porous Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes and NiCoFe layered double hydroxide have also shown interesting results in fuel cells studies due to their high electrical conductivity and abundant active sites offered during the respective electrochemical reactions.27,28
On the other hand, considering the fuel cell cathode side for the reduction reaction studied so far, carbon-supported Pt-based NPs have been the most widely-used catalysts for driving the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the limited availability and high cost of Pt make it urgent to identify suitable replacement of Pt-based catalysts for ORR. Some Pt-free components such as Pd, Ru, Au-based alloys with Ni, W, Mo oxides and cheaper metals such as Ag, Co, Ni, and Sn have been recently gaining importance as Pt alternatives owing to their similarity in electronic structures and chemical properties.29–34 In dealing with alcohols as fuels, Pd-based catalysts have been reported to offer better methanol tolerance in the cathode compartment of direct methanol fuel cells when compared with Pt-based catalysts.35 However, the ORR activity on carbon-supported Pd catalyst (Pd/C) is significantly lower than that on Pt/C since Pd surfaces tend to be oxidized at less positive potentials due to the higher d band center as compared to Pt.36
In the above context, the present investigation deals with the incorporation of Pd NPs onto the transition metal oxide and formulating Pd/Fe2O3 as the catalyst–support combination for use in both the anode and cathode in DEFC. This is in fact a novel attempt taken by the authors to explore the versatile functional character of the newly-synthesized electrocatalyst catering toward the anode and cathode reactions simultaneously in a fuel cell system.
In general, Fe is abundant in nature and is a component of the transition element group, exhibits several common oxidation states, and has the privilege of using its valence electrons to combine with other elements. The polymorphous (alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon) phases of Fe2O3 are well established.37 The polymorph structure of alpha-hematite has a rhombohedral/hexagonal prototype corundum structure38 and gamma-maghemite with cubic spinel structure has a profound existence in nature and can offer reasonably high surface area and interstitial spaces. Hematite has strong anti-ferromagnetic properties. Maghemite plays an important role in different healthcare applications39 while the semiconductor properties of hematite are extremely useful in solar energy conversion, photocatalytic water splitting, etc.40,41 Hematite-Fe2O3 also bears important physicochemical properties such as electronic conductivity, corrosion resistivity, mechanical strength, thermal and hydrothermal stabilities, and methanol tolerance.42 Iron oxide has been extensively investigated in heterogeneous catalysis for CO oxidation,43,44 water-gas shift reaction,45 and application in super capacitors.46 Pd supported on different iron oxides has been reported to serve as a catalyst in the reactions such as the aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol,47 selective dichlorination,48 and denitrification of water.49 R. N. d'Alnoncourta et al. reported on “strong metal–support interactions” in the Pd/Fe2O3 system and found that while O2 is adsorbed on the support, the reaction takes place at the metal/support perimeter.50
Hematite-Fe2O3 is therefore a suitable support material as it provides uniform dispersion of the catalyst NPs on its surface and involves effective metal–support interactions. To the best of our knowledge, Pd NPs embedded on Fe2O3 has not yet been reported as a prospective catalyst in DEFC reactions. This investigation involves the understanding of the structure and morphology of the unique catalyst material Pd/Fe2O3 and evaluating the electrode kinetics for the first time, both in EOR and ORR electrocatalysis in the alkaline medium using potentiodynamic polarization and RDE-RRDE techniques in the respective cases.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the catalysts
Fe2O3-supported Pd (Pd/Fe2O3) catalyst was synthesized by the ethylene glycol reduction method while carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C) and Pd (Pd/C) catalysts were also prepared for the sake of comparison with the new catalysts. Palladium chloride (PdCl2·2H2O) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) solutions of appropriate strength were used as the precursors in respective cases, whereas commercially available mesoporous carbon (Vulcan XC-72) was used as the support material for fabricating the Pt/C and Pd/C electrodes. Iron oxide was produced in the laboratory from ferrous sulphate by decomposition, heat soaking, removal of water, washing and filtration, drying and grinding in successive stages. The suspensions were kept at room temperature; the solid was washed with distilled water, filtered, and dried in an oven. Subsequently, Pd NPs were casted over the synthesized Fe2O3. The catalyst–support combination was maintained at ∼40:60 weight% ratio for the carbon support, as reported in our earlier studies,51 while the catalyst loading was further reduced over Fe2O3 to 25:75 weight% ratio. The procedure for the synthesis has been further elaborated in the ESI file.†
2.2 Materials characterization
X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of the electrocatalysts were obtained through an SEIFERT-2000 diffractometer operating with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1540 nm) generated at 35 kV and 30 mA. Scans were done at 1° min−1 for 2θ values between 20 to 90 degrees. The Debye–Scherrer equation, L = 0.9λ/Bcosθ, was used to estimate the particle size. The elemental ratio of the catalyst was derived from EDX analysis using Link ISIS EDX detector (Oxford Instruments, U.K.) attached with a scanning electron microscope. In order to determine the morphology and average particle size of the catalyst, the synthesized material was subjected to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using JEOL JEM-2010 operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Specimens for the analysis were prepared by ultrasonically suspending the particles in alcohol. A drop of the suspension was deposited onto a standard carbon-coated Cu grid (GCU300, ProSciTech, Australia) and allowed to dry before being inserted into the microscope. Surface compositional analysis was conducted by the help of an Omicron Nanotechnology Instrument (Serial No. 0571) using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique.
2.3 Electrochemical characterization
In the course of preparing the working electrode for EOR studies, graphite block was used as the substrate. The Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst inks were prepared using 5 wt% Nafion solution and isopropanol and were allowed to impregnate on the exposed surface area of the substrate to fabricate the working electrode (0.65 cm2), followed by drying. The catalyst loading was maintained at 0.769 mg cm−2 for Pt/C and Pd/C and 0.480 mg cm−2 for Pd/Fe2O3. The working solutions were purged with nitrogen gas (XL grade, BOC India Ltd.) for 30 min before starting each of the electrochemical experiments. The experiments were carried out at room temperature in a glass cell using a conventional three electrode set up consisting of the Hg–HgO (MMO) reference electrode with 1 M NaOH as the internal/filling solution (−0.14 V vs. SHE), a bright Pt-foil (10 mm × 10 mm) counter electrode, and the fabricated catalysts as the working electrode. Unless otherwise stated, the potential was expressed relative to the same MMO during all the electrochemical measurements. Voltammetric studies were carried out in the working solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.0 M ethanol (AR grade, Merck, Germany) by using a computer-controlled PG STAT 12 (potentiostat/galvanostat) coupled with FRA modules (Metrohm A.G., Switzerlands). The chronoamperograms (CA) of the catalysts were recorded at the potential of −0.3 V for 3 hours in a similar electrolytic solution.
ORR investigations were conducted in the cathodic potential window from 0.1 V to −0.6 V, deploying the RDE-RRDE technique using the almost similar cell set up as mentioned above, except that the working electrodes were fabricated by loading the synthesized catalyst ink on glassy carbon (GC) rotating disc electrode (RDE) with an area of 0.2470 cm2. The catalyst loading was maintained at 20.5 μg cm−2 for Pt/C and Pd/C while it was 12.8 μg cm−2 for Pd/Fe2O3. For ORR analysis, the electrolyte containing 0.5 M NaOH was purged with oxygen gas (XL grade, BOC India Ltd.) at 1 bar pressure for 25–30 min before starting each experiment. All the test solutions were prepared using Milli-Q water and the electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature.
2.4 Estimation of reaction products
An ion chromatography system (Metrohm's Advanced Modular Ion Chromatography), consisting of an L-7100 pump (Metrohm Ltd.), a conductivity detector, and Metrosep A Supp 5-250 and Metrosep A Supp 4-550 organic acid columns, was employed to quantify the yields of acetate and carbonate ions produced during electrolysis by taking aliquots from the working electrolyte after polarization at a constant potential of −300 mV for 1 hour at room temperature.
2.5 Performance study of DEFC
Complete cell testing was done using an in-house fabricated cell consisting of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of 1 cm2 exposed area constructed with anion (alkaline) exchange membrane (AEM, A-006) from Tokuyama, Japan and the synthesized material, Pd/Fe2O3 as the cathode and anode catalyst on either side of the membrane. In case of carbon-supported Pt and Pd catalyst, the cathode component was taken to be commercial Pt/C during full cell testing. The catalyst loading during a single cell testing was maintained at 1.0 mg cm−2 for Pt/C and Pd/C at the anode and 1.0 mg cm−2 for the commercial Pt/C catalyst (40% Vulcan XC-72 supported Pt, Arora Mathey Ltd), while for the validation of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst at both ends, i.e., anode and cathode, similar loading was taken, i.e., 1.0 mg cm−2. Performance testing of all the catalysts was done at 40 °C with the help of a Fuel Cell Test Station (Fuel Cell Technologies, Inc, USA). Oxygen was fed into the cathode chamber at a flow rate of 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) while alkaline ethanol solution was fed into the anode maintaining a flow rate at 1.0 mL min−1.
3. Results & discussion
3.1 Surface morphology of the catalyst NPs
The synthesized Fe2O3 exhibits a crystalline structure in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1), which is characterized with peaks attributed to Fe2O3 (104), Fe2O3 (110), Fe2O3 (113), Fe2O3 (024), Fe2O3 (116), and Fe2O3 (300), indicating the presence of α-Fe2O3 (hematite), as identified through the JCPDS no. 330664. Comparative analysis of the XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3 enables us to understand the effect of Fe2O3 as a support material in place of conventional carbon materials.

The entire regime of the catalyst NPs was found to bear face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. The 2θ value of the (111) peak for Pt/C appears at 39.71, having the original peak positions corresponding to the fcc metallic states, while the 2θ values of the (111) peak for Pd/C and Pd/Fe2O3 are found at 39.91 and 40.24, respectively. The (111) peaks of Pd/C and Pd/Fe2O3 are shifted toward higher angles compared to that of Pt/C (Fig. 1b) and the shift can be credited to the difference in the atomic size (Pd < Pt). In a similar way the (111), (220), (200), and (311) peaks of Pd/Fe2O3 are shifted towards higher 2θ values compared to Pd/C. In fact, the apparent size of the supported catalyst NPs is a reflection of the combined effect of the support structure, interaction of the support–catalyst NPs, and the overall thermodynamic stability of the crystal structure. The crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer formula (L = 0.9λ/βcosθ, where L = particle size, β = FWHM for a particular 2θ value obtained from XRD) and the lattice parameters are summarized in Table 1. Eventually, the particle size of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst is found to be much bigger than that of Pd/C and this is attributed to the influence of α-Fe2O3, which ensures the profound existence of vacant spaces where the Pd NPs are embedded with the well-dispersed morphology. Moreover, we have calculated the dislocation density (δ = 1/L2, L = crystallite size in nm) and lattice strain (ε = βcotθ/4; where β = FWHM for a particular 2θ value obtained from XRD) for various planes of Pd/Fe2O3. The values correspond to δ (111) = 0.03/nm2, δ (220) = 0.077/nm2, δ (200) = 0.045/nm2, δ (311) = 0.039/nm2, and ε(111) = 0.018, ε(220) = 0.026, ε(200) = 0.013, and ε(311) = 0.010, which account for the shift that we observed in the XRD profile.

The TEM images (Fig. 2a) show that the metal particles grow with a spherical geometry, having particle size in the range of 4–6 nm size for Pd/Fe2O3. The size parameters are in good agreement with those obtained from the XRD data. Particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 2(b). The selected area diffraction patterns (SADP) in Fig. 2(c) are featured with typical rings, indicating the characteristic fcc crystallite structure of Pd. Fig. 2(d)–(f) shows the clear image of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst plane and the fringe patterns. The lattice spacing corresponding to (111), (200), and (222) for Pd NPs-decorated Fe2O3 was obtained to be 0.224 nm, 0.194 nm, and 0.135, respectively, and the value for the Fe (110) plane corresponding to Fe2O3 was found to be 0.252 nm.

The elemental composition of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst was investigated through EDX analysis. Fig. 3(a) represents the EDX spectrum while the corresponding atomic orbital lines are shown in Fig. 3(b) and the composition is summarized in the inset of Fig. 3(a). In order to understand the electronic structure of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst, XPS analysis was carried out and Fig. 4 shows the XPS profiles of Pd/Fe2O3 with the individual peaks of Pd, Fe, and oxygen. The spectral pattern of Pd 3d (Fig. 4a) consists of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 with respective peaks at 335.39 eV and 340.60 eV, which are very similar in nature, thus confirming the presence of Pd in zero oxidation state. Low intensity shoulders at 337.48 eV and 342.96 eV correspond to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd with +2 oxidation state. The respective peaks at 712.80 eV and 725.51 eV indicate the existence of the FeOOH species and the Fe(III) state in the spectra, and are ascribed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4b).52 The additional low intensity Fe 2p peaks at 710.19 eV and 724.29 eV account for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, and are indicative of a small amount of Fe(II) in the matrix. It is evident that besides the major appearance of Pd(0) and Fe(III) in the spectra, Pd(II) and Fe(II) also exist in the catalyst matrix. The O 1s peak (Fig. 4c) at 529.88 eV corresponds to the Fe–O–Fe linkage of Fe2O3 while the peak at about 531.31 eV is assigned to the hydrous (M–OH, M = Fe) linkage of Fe2O3. The peak at 533.50 eV suggests the presence of residual water (H–O–H bond) in the composite matrix.52,53

3.2 Electrocatalytic studies of the catalysts

Fig. 5 demonstrates the typical cyclic voltammograms recorded in the potential region between −1.0 and 0.8 V for different catalysts including bare Fe2O3 in 0.5 M NaOH at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Periodic cycling was carried out for 30 times until a reproducible voltammogram was obtained for each of the catalysts used. The observation in Fig. 5 is of vital importance, which accounts for the outstanding surface activity displayed by the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst. It may be noted that bare Fe2O3 shows small but prominent hydrogen desorption region (inset of Fig. 5), which reflects a surface change54 from Fe2O3 to FeOOH at −0.3 V.
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts recorded in 0.5 M NaOH at room temperature, sweep rate: 50 mV s−1, inset: CV of bare Fe2O3 in 0.5 M NaOH. 
In Fig. 5, the shaded regions represent the typical electrochemical surface area (ECSA), which corresponds to the regions of hydrogen adsorption–desorption (HAD), oxide formation, and adsorbed oxide reduction (AOR), and are compared for the Pd/C and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts. Further, the apparently compressed double layer charging region reflects the early onset of oxidation in the anodic sweep. Distinct peaks cover a wide potential span in the HAD region for the synthesized (Pd/Fe2O3) catalyst. The ECSA values of the catalysts were derived from the voltammograms by integrating the charge in the HAD and AOR regions, and the values are summarized in Table 1. Amongst all the catalysts, Pd/Fe2O3 possesses considerably large electrochemical surface area, as quantified by the HAD and AOR region. In case of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst, the HAD region is ∼4 times and the AOR region is ∼1.5 times higher than that for Pd/C (Fig. 6). This is attributed to the superior dispersion of Pd on the TMO support structure compared to that on carbon surface and at the same time, the Pd NPs can efficiently occupy the huge vacant space available within the bulky Fe2O3 crystal structure and get studded on the crystal surface. The high charge associated with the HAD and AOR peaks for the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst translate to the extensive generation of active reaction sites compared to those of Pt/C and Pd/C. Similar area calculations were done for Pt/C and Pd/C and the ECSA values follows the order Pd/Fe2O3 ≫ Pd/C ≈ Pt/C.

(b) EOR on bare Fe2O3. (c) Onset potential of the catalysts at 3 mA cm−2 current density output. Inset: bar plot of the peak current density of EOR. 

3.2.1 EOR catalysis. 

Fig. 6(a) demonstrates the cyclic voltammograms of EOR recorded in alkaline solution containing 1 M ethanol and 0.5 M NaOH for the catalysts under study at 50 mV s−1 scan rate. The voltammograms are characterized by well-defined oxidation peaks in the anodic sweep and a renewed oxidation peak in the cathodic sweep. However, the only support Fe2O3 does not show any EOR feature within the working potential window (Fig. 6b). The EOR peak current density ∼ 110 mA cm−2 on the Pd/Fe2O3 electrode is found to be almost double that on Pd/C (∼61 mA cm−2) and 1.5 times that obtained for Pt/C (∼76 mA cm−2), as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 6(c).
This observation is in accordance with the onset potential values (considered to be 3 mA cm−2), which substantially reduced for Pd/Fe2O3 compared to those for carbon-supported Pt and Pd catalysts (Fig. 6c). In fact, the oxophilicity of Fe promotes easy transition within the Fe(II)/Fe(III) moieties, thereby facilitating ethanol anchoring on the reaction sites. Furthermore, the transition metal oxide, Fe2O3, possessing a large 3D configuration, can provide ample vacant space within its structure and allows Pd NPs to be dispersed on the surface, generating more active sites for attracting the reactant molecules (as shown for a single unit). O–Fe–O–Fe–O + CH3CH2OH → (CH3CH2O)ads–Fe–O–Fe–O + (OH)ads(1)
The site coverage by reactant molecules eventually promotes the EOR mechanism, as manifested in the catalytic pre-eminence of the Fe2O3-supported metal NPs when compared to the other support materials.


3.2.2 Probable reaction mechanism of EOR. 
Based on our previous reports,21,55 the mechanism of EOR over Pd NPs in alkaline medium can be described by the following sequences including water activation at a relatively low potential on Fe2O3 and assisted by the rigorous involvement of OHads. Pd(NPs) + CH3CH2OH → Pd–(CH3CH2OH)ads(2) Pd–(CH3CH2OH)ads + 3OH− → Pd–(CH3CO)ads + 3H2O + 3e−(3) Pd–(H2O)ads → Pd–OHads + H+ + e−(4) Pd–(CH3CO)ads + OH− → Pd–CH3COOH + e−(5) CH3COOH + 3OH− → (CH3O)ads + CO2 + 2H2O + 3e−(6) Pd–(CH3O)ads + 3OH− → Pd–(CO)ads + 3H2O + 3e−(7) Pd–(CO)ads + (OH)ads + 3OH− → Pd(NPs) + CO32− + 2H2O + e−(8)
It is well known that the carbonaceous intermediates, especially CH3COads, frequently block the active sites and the electrode is destined toward poisoning until the EOR is promoted by stringent catalysis, whereby these species are removed from the surface. It is also known that Pd begins to adsorb OH− at comparatively higher potential, particularly in alkaline medium where the surface is covered with weakly adsorbed water. H2Oads → OHads + H+ + e−(9)
Notably, there is the added advantage in the presence of Fe2O3 that the OH− species are adsorbed on the Pd sites at much lower potentials due to the presence of Fe(III). Interestingly, the –OH-studded Pd/Fe2O3 matrix is found to abate poisoning by the oxidative removal of (CO)ads at early potential, thus maintaining the propagation of EOR. Therefore, in addition to Pd NPs, Fe oxide can also intervene in the electrode kinetics by indirectly assisting in oxygen coordination and promoting oxidation of the strongly bound intermediates (CO)ads for the ultimate CO2/CO32− production. Pd–COads + 2Fe2O3–(OH)ads → CO2 + H2O + Pd + 2Fe2O3(10)


3.2.3 Chronoamperometric studies and estimation of the reaction products. 

Fig. 7 shows the typical current density–time responses of Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts at a constant potential of −0.3 V for EOR. All the catalysts exhibit a gradual current decay before steady state current is attained. The initial fall in the current is due to activation loss, which represents the intrinsic catalytic behavior of the materials during polarization. This polarization deficiency is found to be efficiently controlled using the Fe2O3 support. During the propagation of the reaction in the steady state condition, Pd/Fe2O3 exhibit, on an average, 1.5 and 3 times the values of the current densities obtained for Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively. Long-term poisoning rates (δ) were derived by measuring the linear decay of the current at times greater than 500 s using the relation (δ) = 100/i0 × (di/dt)t>500 s (% per s), where (di/dt)t>500 s is the slope of the linear portion of the current decay and i0 is the current at the start of polarization back-extrapolated from the linear current decay. The calculated δ values are shown in the inset of Fig. 7. This clearly demonstrates that for ethanol oxidation on Pd/Fe2O3, the long-term poisoning of the surface is arrested by 40–70% compared to that on the carbon-supported catalyst surface.

It is evident from the XPS analysis that Fe2O3 is associated with various oxygenated species, e.g., Fe(OH)ads and FeOOH in alkaline medium, and these assist in the recovery of the deactivated reaction centers on Pd sites by oxidizing the carbonaceous residues at lower potential, thus boosting the catalytic performance of EOR. Explicit discussions have also been made on these aspects during the ORR study.

The respective products, acetate and carbonate, formed during the oxidation of ethanol were estimated and summarized in Table 2.

In Fig. 8(a), the first sharp peak (peak 1) represents the injection peak,56,57 which is a measure of the total ionic content of the injected sample. Peak 2 is the peak of our interest, i.e., the acetate peak. Peak 3 is a relatively minor peak that is undefined, however, may occur due to the presence of ions generated in the course of the reaction. Peak 4 clearly indicates that the conductivity of the analyte sample at that retention time is lower than the background (mobile phase) and may be attributed to some water content. Similarly, considering Fig. 8(b), peak 5 corresponds to the injection peak and peak 6 appears due to some unknown analyte ion. Peak 7 represents the carbonate peak, which is the main peak of our interest.
The remarkably high yield of acetate and carbonate (∼5.5 and ∼3.5 times than that on Pd/C and ∼4.4 and ∼3 times than that on Pt/C) on hematite-supported Pd (Pd/Fe2O3) ensures that the reaction proceeds through a parallel pathway, producing both acetate and carbonate as the end product in the oxidation kinetics. Thus, Fe2O3 has a pivotal role in driving the EOR toward acetate and carbonate formation, which is in accordance with our proposed mechanism for EOR discussed in the previous section.
The strong points behind the catalytic superiority of the prepared catalyst Pd/Fe2O3 on EOR may be summarized as follows. (i) Vacant sites available within the metal oxide structure act as high adsorption sites. (ii) High electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst reflects the creation of extensive reaction centers. (iii) Strong catalyst–support interactions build up synergistic partnership for propagating the charge transfer kinetics. (iv) The –OH carpet formed on the catalyst surface in alkaline medium aggravates the reaction kinetics. Evidently, these make the catalyst energetically sustainable compared to the use of carbon support.


3.2.4 ORR catalysis. 
One of the major issues in fuel cell energy efficiency is concerned with the poor kinetic behavior of ORR due to the high reduction overpotential mostly over the surface of Pt-based nano-catalysts. The second part of our investigation is therefore focused on alleviating this limiting factor and validating the profound assistance of the same robust catalyst (Pd/Fe2O3) in ORR kinetics. Typically, the ORR studies were carried out through hydrodynamic voltammetry using RDE and RRDE techniques. In the course of the ORR study, linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were recorded (Fig. 9) in the electrolyte saturated with O2 (99.99%) using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) loaded with the corresponding catalyst ink and polarization was carried out in the working potential range from 0.1 V to −0.6 V. In the typical LSV pattern, the initial kinetics regime was identified where the reaction rate was only kinetically controlled and not influenced by the rotation speed. Beyond this region, the kinetic regime turns into a mixed regime (diffusion and kinetic control) at slightly lower potential, finally leading to a plateau at further low potential, indicating the transition from diffusion-controlled to mass-transport regime. Pertinently, more negative the limiting cathodic current, more is the catalyst superiority.
 Fig. 9  Linear sweep voltammograms of (a) Pt/C, (b) Pd/C, and (c) Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts in 0.5 M NaOH saturated with oxygen at 10 mV s−1 scan rate at different rotation speeds (400–2400 rpm). 
Interestingly enough, outstanding ORR activity was observed in this investigation with the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst when compared to the standard Pt/C and Pd/C electrodes. The greater limiting current densities with steeper kinetic region become the preferred situation, indicating the catalytic efficacy of Pd/Fe2O3 with minimum polarization loss in the cathodic process. In the working voltage range, the oxygen diffusion to the catalytic reaction center is the sole rate determining step, which presumably depends on various parameters such as the thickness of the catalyst film, the content of Nafion, and the conductivity of the support material. All these factors, along with the rotation speed, affect the limiting current density and ultimately facilitate the tunnelling of electrons within the DEFC framework. It has also been observed that at a higher positive potential, eventually, no electrocatalytic conversion of oxygen occurs. The ORR is quenched at high potentials due to the presence of the surface O/OH−/H2O network, which prevents the adsorption of bi-dentate O2.58 The limiting current densities for all the catalysts increases with the increase in the rotation speed from 400 to 2400 rpm. The rise in the cathodic current is assigned to the high rotational speeds, leading to faster oxygen flux to the electrode surface and consequently generating larger currents.59 It has been observed that the limiting current densities in the rpm regime (400–2400) increase in the order Pd/Fe2O3 > Pt/C > Pd/C, which also supports the basic trend that Pt/C is a better catalyst than Pd/C in ORR. The kinetic current, as observed at −30 mV for Pd/Fe2O3, is much higher than that for carbon-supported Pt and Pd catalysts (Table 3). Eventually, the superior ORR activity of the catalyst is reflected in the enhancement of the kinetic current and the positive shift of the half wave potential since more positive the onset potential, lower will be the overvoltage and higher will be the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction.

The Levich–Koutecky equation was used to judge the level of conversion of O2 to OH−. For a first order reaction with respect to dissolved oxygen, the kinetic current (ik) and the catalytic current of the disc electrode (i) are related to the rotation rate (ω)60 with the equation 1/i = 1/ik + 1/(Bω1/2), where B is the Levich slope given by B = 0.2nF(DO2)2/3ν−1/6CO2, DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the alkaline medium, CO2 is its solubility, ν is the kinetic viscosity, n is the number of electron transferred per molecule of O2, F is the Faraday constant, and ω is the rotation rate in rpm. A plot of i−1vs. ω−1/2 at a particular potential gives a straight line, having a slope value of B. A similar mechanism is followed for each of the catalysts. The value of B was obtained by using the data for DO2 = 1.63 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, CO2 = 1.03 × 10−6 mol cm−3, and ν = 0.01 cm2 s−1.
The number of electrons exchanged was determined from the slope of the straight lines at different rotational speeds (Fig. 10a) at the potential of −0.40 V and was found to be 3.60, 3.35, and 4.05 for Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3, respectively, indicating the difference in the extent of oxygen reduction toward OH− (ref. 60) formation and producing the poisoning species H2O2. The Tafel slopes61 for Pd/Fe2O3 were calculated at high and low potential regions from the plots in Fig. 10b. The linear part of the Tafel plots for all the three catalysts is shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI file.† The exchange current density (i0) was obtained by extrapolating the fitted Tafel line to where the overpotential equals zero. The slope at the relatively lower potential is due to the formation of Pt/Pd oxides and/or the adsorption of OH− species on the electrode surface. The increment in the slope at higher potential region is indicative of the reduction of oxides and/or desorption of the OH− species existing on the surface of the electrocatalysts.59,61

Further, the RDE-RRDE technique was deployed to estimate the poisoning species H2O2 as the intermediate produced during ORR. Fig. 11(a) demonstrates the yield of H2O2 (% H2O2) in terms of the ring and disk current densities for Pd/Fe2O3. The calculations were based on the expression % H2O2 = (2Ir/N)/(Id + Ir/N), where Ir = ring current, Id = disk current, and N = collection efficiency, which is taken as 0.37 (as reported in the Pine research database for our GC-Pt electrode, Batsol, Manual). In case of Pd/Fe2O3, the yield of H2O2 is much reduced, as shown in Fig. 11(b), approximately 3.2% compared to 4.4% for Pd/C (Table 4), thus eventually supporting the facile ORR kinetics, which is least hindered by intermediate formation.

3.3 Beneficial role of Fe2O3 as the support in ORR
It is well known from literature and also derived in the present investigation that ORR follows the 4e− pathway on Pd/C.31,36 However, the oxygen binding energy on Pd surfaces is too strong, which makes the subsequent reduction process of O-containing species forming water or OH− difficult.34 This may apparently limit the ORR activity of Pd compared to Pt. On the other hand, the reduction of O2 can be subsequently executed by the assistance of the Fe2O3 support. The Fe(III)/Fe(II) species existing within the oxide structure can easily accept OH− to in situ generate the Fe(OH)ads/FeOOH moiety, which are supposed to intervene in the reduction mechanism, as shown in eqn (12) and (13). Pd + OH−(alkaline) → Pd–(OH)ads(11) Fe(III) + OH−(alkaline) → Fe(III)–(OH)ads(12) Fe2O3 + H2O → 2FeOOH(13) Fe2O3 + 2H2O + 2e ⇌ FeOOH + FeOH + 2OH−(14)
The existence of such superoxo species were also validated through XPS analysis (Fig. 4), as mentioned earlier. These species weaken the oxygen binding energy and in turn help in equilibrating the rate of electron transfer/O–O bond breaking, ultimately removing the O-containing species from the Pd surfaces and regenerating the active catalytic sites. The suggested ORR scheme on Pd surface follows a direct 4e− mechanism, as shown in Fig. 12(a), while Fig. 12(b) shows the auxiliary function of the Fe(III) species promoting the oxygen binding on Pd.
 Fig. 12  (a) ORR on the Pd surface. (b) Auxiliary role of Fe2O3 in ORR. 
The surface cations of the transition metal oxides (TMO) coordinate with the oxygen of H2O in order to satisfy their full oxygen coordination. At the same time, the ‘OH carpet’ is instantaneously formed on the surface in an alkaline environment (eqn (12)) as the water molecules get distributed over the catalyst sites. The ORR pathway over Pd NPs is therefore boosted on the TMO support as can be realized in the sequential steps such as (i) Fe–OH species interacting with O2, adsorbed on oxide surfaces, (ii) the adsorbed O2 reacting with water to regenerate Fe–OH, and (iii) the iron oxide in alkaline environment, thus maintaining the equilibrium with FeOH and FeOOH species, as shown in eqn (14). Therefore, Fe2O3 not only assists Pd by minimizing the Pd–O bond dissociation energy but also directly intervenes in the ORR mechanism. This is actually the distinguishable feature of TMO from that of the meso-carbon support, which can only help in catalyst dispersion and conductivity; however, it is incapable of co-assisting the redox catalysis but rather, it is susceptible to corrosion in the ambient environment.
At this juncture, the results of the ORR studies on bare Fe2O3 may be critically analyzed. Unlike that for EOR electrocatalysis, where ethanol oxidation propagation did not show (Fig. 6b) any catalytic features at all, ORR is found to exhibit (Fig. 13) the typical features although at poor levels. In order to ascertain the catalytic ability of Fe2O3 alone for propagating the reduction kinetics, the LSV plot in Fig. 13 was considered. It is an unprecedented observation that bare Fe2O3 contributes at least a minor share toward the overall ORR performance, which is expected to get synergized in the presence of metal NPs such as Pd in this case.
 Fig. 13  Linear sweep voltammograms of Fe2O3 in 0.5 M NaOH saturated with oxygen at different rotation speeds (400–2400 rpm) at 10 mV s−1 scan rate. 
To achieve a deeper insight into the extent of the reaction, the number of exchange electrons were calculated and found to be ∼1.6. The corresponding L–K plot is given in the ESI (Fig. 2).† In addition, H2O2 produced during the reduction reaction was also estimated. A high value of % H2O2 (∼32.5%) obtained on Fe2O3 indicates the shunting of the reduction process through a nearly 2e− transfer pathway (ESI Fig. 3†). The Tafel slope (ESI Fig. 4†) gives a high value (−248 mV dec−1) in the high current density region and exchange current density (i0) of the order 10−6 mA cm−2, indicating its inability to be used as a primary catalyst in ORR (Fig. 14).

3.4 Comparative mass activity of EOR and ORR catalysis
The EOR catalyst loading was maintained at 0.769 mg cm−2 while that for ORR was 20.5 μg cm−2 for Pt/C and Pd/C. The weight% ratio of the catalyst–support for Pt/C & Pd/C was maintained at 40:60 while for Pd/Fe2O3, it was further reduced to 25:75, as mentioned earlier. The EOR mass activity was calculated at 0.160 V (at the EOR peak potential of Pt/C) while the ORR mass activity was calculated at −0.2 V (vs. Hg–HgO), where all the three catalysts show more or less plateau behavior in the diffusion-controlled regime. Fig. 15 exhibits the supreme EOR and ORR mass activity of Pd/Fe2O3 compared to the carbon-supported catalysts.
 Fig. 15  Comparative EOR and ORR mass activity of the catalysts in the bar plot. 
The above records and analyses intrigue us with the outstanding contribution of the unique catalyst Pd/Fe2O3, which not only excludes carbon and Pt from the electrode matrix but at the same time can efficiently cater to the reaction kinetics of EOR and ORR in the respective cases and is far ahead of the commonly-used carbon-supported catalysts. The exceptionally energy-efficient behavior of the simple Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst was further demonstrated by the output performances of the complete fuel cell comprised of the same catalyst at both the positive and negative terminals.
3.5 Fuel cell performance study

Fig. 16 represents the I–V curve and the power density plot of the catalysts Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3. Pd/Fe2O3 exhibits the maximum open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.8 V, which is 0.05 V and 0.07 V ahead of that of Pt/C (0.75 V) and Pd/C (0.73 V), respectively. The power density values obtained for the Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts are 29.94 mW cm−2, 20.36 mW cm−2, and 36.01 mW cm−2, respectively. The beneficial role of the Fe2O3 support is therefore reflected in the output performance as Pd/Fe2O3 exhibits a 77% increase in the power density value compared to its carbon supported counterpart (Pd/C) and a 20% increase compared to that delivered by Pt/C.

I–V curve and power density plots of the DE (AEM) FC with Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts. 
Pd/Fe2O3 therefore stands out as the first ever reported unique catalyst with non-carbon support and non-Pt entity to navigate the electrochemical (redox) reactions at both the ends (anode and cathode) and impart better sustainability and affordability to the entire fuel cell system. Finally, the overall impression of EOR and ORR catalysis can be obtained from the schematic model representation (Fig. 17) of the Pd-embedded Fe2O3 structure in a direct ethanol fuel cell.

4. Conclusion
In this investigation, Fe2O3 NPs were developed as an alternate support material for Pd catalyst that replaces Pt and carbon from the catalyst matrix for DEFC operating in an alkaline environment. The unique catalyst Pd/Fe2O3 can propagate both the EOR and ORR with exceptional electrode kinetics and energy efficiency at much higher level than the conventional carbon-supported precious metals and their alloyed NPs. The in situ generated hydroxo/superoxo species FeOH and FeOOH within the Fe2O3 structure intervene in the EOR mechanism, which is reflected in the yield of the oxidation products on the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst, which is more than 5 times for acetate and more than 3 times for carbonate compared to the carbon-supported catalyst. Moreover, the ample interstitial spaces in hematite ensure better oxygen anchoring ability and availability of the peroxy linkage, which triggers the direct 4e− pathway for ORR kinetics that is least affected by H2O2 formation. The cost-effective and robust catalyst shows excellent stability and power density output in an in-house fabricated DE(AEM)FC operating in an alkaline medium at 40 °C.
