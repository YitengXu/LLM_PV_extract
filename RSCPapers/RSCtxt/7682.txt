, Accepted 5th June 2015First published on 5th June 2015AbstractA quick and facile synthesis of a mesoporous (pore diameter = 46.2–47.1 nm) material (FSG-EBT) through the immobilization of azo dye (EBT) on functionalized silica gel (FSG) has been achieved. FSG-EBT simultaneously binds two different metal centers, Zr(IV) and Tl(I) at their high and low oxidation states, respectively. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the extractor binds Zr(IV) with a breakthrough capacity (BTC) of 490 μmol g−1 and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) extracts Tl(I) (BTC = 120 μmol g−1). The LUMO has thus enhances the BTC of the resin as a whole. This binding mode sequence differs from earlier existing mode of binding where extractors bind metals using HOMO and LUMO operative on the same metal centre only. HOMO/LUMO value (μmol g−1) reiterates itself as a definite quantum mechanical descriptor of BTC, and BTC is a definite descriptor of the state of metal (monomer/polymer) sorbed. The synthesis needs no stringent reaction condition such as refluxing. Its corresponding nanomaterial has been well assessed (composition: [Si(OSi)3(OH)·xH2O]n[–Si(CH3)2–NH–C6H4–NN–EBT]4; structure: tetrahedral) and is reiterated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Along with its good extractor qualities [high pore volume, PV = 0.3747 cm3 g−1; surface area, SA = 330.97 m2 g−1; BTC (Q0 = 476.7 μmol g−1); column efficiency, CE = 296 and preconcentration factor, PF = 120.20 ± 0.04; reusability > 1000 cycles; and faster rate of sorption–desorption], FSG-EBT possesses well demarcated spatial placement of HOMO–LUMO with a substantial band gap (η = 7.1471 eV). This makes charge recombination by mixing difficult and thus shows its potential applicability as a good donor–acceptor organic electronic device.
1. Introduction
Trace level concentration and matrix effects1 make it difficult to directly determine analytes in real samples. So, a selective separation and preconcentration method for sample clean-up to obtain the trace target species in a small volume, prior to its detection/estimation by means of sophisticated instruments, is urgently required.2,3 In comparison with other techniques4–13 with poor recovery and selectivity,14–16 solid-phase extraction (SPE) creates much attention as it possesses many advantages. An appreciable selectivity and high values of preconcentration factors (PF) make SPE as an efficient method for sample clean-up of an analyte. It has received significant attention because of its reusability, simplicity, and time-cost effectiveness.17 More importantly, it is characterized by low consumption of reagents and is eco-friendly in nature.17–27 The widely used solid phase (SP) sorbent, silica gel (SG), gets hydrolyzed at its working range of pH 7.5–8.26 Its lack of selectivity and irreversible nature of binding with metal ions also restricts its reusability.23,27,28 Other reported SP sorbents (such as XAD resins, ion-exchange resin, cellulosic derivatives and porous glass beads)29–33 did not achieve appreciable selectivity to obtain the targeted species in its pure form by removing the interference of co-existing species. On the other hand, complicated method of synthesis, need of stringent stripping condition (1–3 mol L−1 HCl), low enrichment factor (PF = 20)34 and their very specific sorption qualities (each extractor is applicable for one or two selective metal ions only), limit the applicability of ion-imprinted polymers (IIPs).35,36 Functionalized mesoporous silica gel (FSG) of versatile selectivity, having high surface area (SA), high pore volume (PV), high degree of mechanical and chemical stability, and abilities for faster and quantitative sorption at near neutral pH,6,7 is therefore urgently required. FSG may be synthesized by two traditional methods: (1) impregnation of high molecular mass carboxylic acids (HMMLCE) on silanised silica gel (SSG).17–22 During silanization, dichlorodimethylsilane (DMDCS) as cross-linker increases the size of SSG particles. Consequently, the surface activity (BET SA = 149.46 m2 g−1; PV = 0.2001 mL g−1) of the synthesized FSG in terms of sorption efficiencies is sharply decreased.17–22 (2) In the second route, SG is chemically functionalized (grafted) using a suitable grafting component (such as 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, chitosan)23,37,38 to obtain FSG. Subsequently, a selective chelating agent [viz., dithizone, methylthiosalicylate, xylenol orange (XO), Eriochrome black T (EBT), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-napthol (PAN) etc.] was chemically immobilized on this FSG. These chelating agents act as selective metal trapping centers and normally the selectivity of the material is a function of solution pH. The chemical grafting protocols reported so far3,23,37–47 are rather complicated (refluxing for more than 24 h, requirement of several toxic/hazardous and costly chemicals such as diethyl ether, pyridine, dichloromethane, chloroacetyl chloride, 2-aminothiophenol, acetonitrile etc.),25 time consuming (72–120 h) and sometimes require noble metal catalysts. These extractors were also found to be unstable at both high and low pH (pH 1–3 and 9.0). Moreover, low level of PF and poor selectivity (applied for synthetic binary mixtures) to remove the matrix effects restrict their use in real samples. In addition, the cross-linking activities of the graftor (organosilicon compounds, chitosan or traditional chlorosilanes) increase the size of the FSG particles23,24,38–47 and as a result, their sorption activity in terms of SA (<300 m2 g−1) declines to a moderate level. Though in hydrosilylation reaction45 grafting time has been reduced drastically this necessitates the use of costly and hazardous catalysts such as tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3).
On critically analyzing these reports for functionalized silica gel (FSG), we herein present for the first time a rapid (2–3 min) and room-temperature grafting protocol for surface modification of amorphous silica gel (SG) using m-nitroaniline as the graftor. DMDCS was used as a bridging component and the method needs no catalyst. Later, chemical immobilization of EBT on the FSG is performed to obtain the extractor (FSG-EBT) of desired size, selectivity and stability.46 It possesses O, N and S as the binding sites and consequently, a wide variety of metal ions having different hard–soft behavior (guided by η, a definite quantum mechanical descriptor)48 can be adsorbed on it. The selectivity may be attained either by exploiting the differences in solution pH for extraction or through selective elution with the help of a selective eluent.17–22 In an analytical application the resin has been utilized for necessary sample clean-up1,49 of Th(IV) because of its essentiality and extensive application,50 toxicity and hazardous nature (biological T1/2 = 4 years, radioactive T1/2 = 1.4 × 1010 years).51 A rigorous search through the literature reveals that up to now, extractors are able to extract either high or low oxidation states using their HOMO and LUMO operative on the same metal ion (viz., carbonyls, nitrosyls etc.).52 However, spatially separated HOMO and LUMO, able to extract two different metal centers in their high and low oxidation states, respectively, at the same time (and enhancing the breakthrough capacity (BTC)) have not yet been reported. Besides the analytical usage, the photochemical applicability of such a material as a light emitting diode (LED) source or organic electronic device also merits mention. This is a genuine possibility because of intramolecular charge/hole transfer through donor–acceptor behavior (Schemes S1 and S2†). EBT, a water soluble azo dye is reduced irreversibly by a two-step one electron process at –NN– moiety (−68 mV s−1 (EPc1) and at −275 mV s−1 (EPc2)) and the system is averse to charge recombination, as is required in solar cells.53
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents and chemicals
Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and solvents used in this work were of analytical grade (BDH/E Merck, Bombay, India). Chemically bound Eriochrome black T (sodium 1-(1-hydroxy-2-naphthylazo)-2-naphthol-4-sulfonate, BDH, Bombay, India), a water soluble azo dye on silica gel (60–120 mesh/10–20 nm) was used as an ion extractor. Dimethyldichlorosilane (BDH, Bombay, India) was used a bridging component. Sn/HCl (E. Merck, Bombay, India) was used to reduce the nitro group to amine by the usual method.54 Standard stock solutions of Th(IV) (0.01 mol L−1), Zr(IV) (0.01 mol L−1), U(VI) (0.01 mol L−1) and Tl(I) (0.01 mol L−1) were prepared by dissolving Th(NO3)4, ZrO(NO3)2, UO2(CH3COO)2·2H2O and Tl2(SO4) (E. Merck, Bombay, India) in water and estimated complexometrically using XO indicator.2 Buffer solutions of different pH were prepared from acetic acid (0.2 mol L−1) and ammonium acetate (0.02 mol L−1) in appropriate ratio (NH4Cl:NH3 = 17.3 g:142 mL L−1). An aqueous solution of hexamine (BDH, Bombay, India) was used to adjust the pH of analyte solutions.
2.2. Instrumentation
Most of the investigations have been performed on nanomaterial. For the surface characterization of the extractor, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was performed at 5.0 kV by using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6700-FESEM, ZEISS Supra 55). Prior to analysis, solid samples were sprinkled onto adhesive carbon tapes which were supported on metallic disks. SEM analysis (for normal sized material) was carried out on randomly selected points on the solid surfaces and a back-scattered electron (BSE) detector was utilized during analysis. To measure particle sizes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken at an accelerating voltage of 60–200 kV in 50 V steps using a JEM-2100 microscope. To assess the probable composition of the ion-exchange material, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was recorded on a JEOL 2010 FEG microscope equipped with an EDX analyzer. The BET surface area and pore volume were determined by using automatic N2 adsorption/desorption instrument Micromeritics ASAP 2020 V3.03H (USA) at the instrumental conditions; analysis adsorptive: N2; analysis bath temperature = −195.85 °C; measured warm free space 26.4410 cm3; cold free space = 82.1653 cm3 with sample mass 0.0810 g without thermal correction. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku (Ultima IV) H-12 Japan (Kurary Co. Ltd. N) X-ray diffractometer in the 2θ measuring range 0–90° with a scanning speed of 3° min−1 at room temperature using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) as the scattering X-ray line source at a running condition of 40 kV and 30 mA. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the extractor in its Th(IV) loaded and unloaded form were acquired on a Shimadzu FTIR spectrophotometer (Model no. FTIR-8400S) using KBr pellets (Table S1†). Measurements were taken in the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. Raman spectra for the extractor and its Th(IV) loaded form were measured with Raman System RSLplus.R (Model no. 3000 series) (Agiltron 15 Cabot Road, Woburn, MA 01801, USA) by irradiating the solid mass with a 785 nm laser source at the range of power input 90–290 mW to achieve the precise resolution. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the corresponding nanomaterials (FSG and FSG-EBT) were recorded on an NMR Bruker Ascend spectrometer (Model no. 400 MHz and 100 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively) relative to the solvent d6-DMSO 1H: δ = 4.79. Mass spectrometric (MS) data were obtained by using WATERS-Q-Tof-Premier-HAB213 and WATERS-Q-Tof-Premier-ESI-MS instruments. 2–5 μL of sample in DMSO–methanol (1:9) solvent was injected into the ionizing chamber and nitrogen gas was used for desolvation. Ionization protocols: capillary voltage = 3.5 kV; cone voltage = 30.0 V, extraction and ion guide voltages = 1.2 and 0.9 kV; source and desolvation temperature = 100 °C. The ESI-MS spectra were recorded at 1 s scans under positive full scan mode. The UV-visible spectra of the extractor (for metal–ligand complexation at different mole ratios) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer (Model no UV-1800). The thermal stability and composition for the synthesized extractor and also the extracted Th(IV) species have been assessed by TGA/DTA analysis with a PerkinElmer (STA 6000) Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer at the instrumental conditions viz., flow-rate of nitrogen = 20 mL min−1, working range of temperature: 40 to 950 °C with increment of 25 °C min−1. Analytical applications of the material has been assessed with standard stock solutions of Th(IV) (0.01 mol L−1), Zr(IV) (0.01 mol L−1), U(VI) (0.01 mol L−1) and Tl(I) (0.01 mol L−1). The pH measurements were carried out with a digital Elico L1-120 pH meter combined with glass electrode.
2.3. Computational studies
Global hardness is a definite quantum mechanical descriptor and it is the cardinal index of chemical reactivity as well as stability of atoms and ions.3 In order to perform the geometrical optimization and energy calculation of the FSG-EBT compound and to rationalize the physico-chemical behavior of the synthesized resin the proposed chemical structure of the resin has been optimized by DFT method (Gaussian 09 Revision D.01 package). All the necessary calculations were carried out using the B3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation functional STO-3G basis set.4 The global hardness of the extractor was determined from the energy of the HOMO–LUMO of the optimized structures. A series of DFT calculations of its building units have been made to judge the parallel shifting of both the electron density and hole density within the molecular framework. The photoelectric properties has been assessed through density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations in the Gaussian09 program package, with LSDA/SDD* functional and basis set.4 In addition, neutral bond order (NBO) calculations of the optimized structures were performed to characterize the molecular orbital. The energies of the optimized structures were calculated after ZPE (zero point energy) and thermal corrections.
2.4. Preparation of ion exchange material (FSG-EBT)
Silica gel (A) (60–120 mesh/10–20 nm) and m-nitroaniline (B) were taken in toluene in a round bottom flask at 27 °C and dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) (C) was added slowly at 300 K. Here, m-nitroaniline binds with silica gel through DMDCS with the instantaneous formation of (Si–O)n–Si(Me)2–NH–C6H4NO2 (D) (FSG). Subsequently, diazo salt (E) was made by using the literature method.55 Finally, EBT was immobilized on this FSG by diazo coupling reaction and produces the resin (FSG-EBT) (F). The synthesized resin (deep black colored) mass was sequentially washed with 6 mol L−1 HNO3. Finally, the resin was washed with cold distilled water and dried at room temperature till constant weight. The whole synthesis (Scheme 1) required only 45–60 min. Each column could be used for at least 1000–1500 cycles without any loss of its exchange capacity.

2.5. Experimental details for analytical applications
2.5.1 Systematic studies for sample clean-up. Rare earths and Th(IV) in real samples (such as alloys and ore samples) is found to be present in a very low concentration. Th(IV) amidst several common cations/anions such as Cl− and SO42− salts of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, in the range of their natural contamination is also found in effluent samples. It needs an appropriate selective condition for extraction of Th(IV) on the adsorbent followed by its selective elution using an eluent of small volume to obtain enriched and pure states. Sorption of Th(IV), has been performed by both batch and column method.
2.5.2 Batch experiments: sorption isotherms. 0.1 g of dry extractor was equilibrated with 50 mL of Th(IV) solutions of different concentrations (4 × 10−4 to 9 × 10−4 mol L−1) at pH 6.5. The amount Th(IV) sorbed, qe, in each solution was determined as:  In order to assess the applicability of the isotherms the correlation coefficient, R2 and the RMSE (; where, qe(t) is the theoretical estimate for corresponding qe and n is the number of observations) were examined for the goodness-of-fit. The maximum R2 and minimum RMSE indicate the applicability of the isotherm. The parameters for the batch experiment are given in Table S2.†
2.5.3 Column experiments. Batch experiments require filtration in both extraction and elution steps to obtain the analyte. In the case of sample clean-up from multicomponent mixtures this sometimes also requires repetitive filtration. On the other hand, column chromatography is an effective alternative for sample clean-up through separation and preconcentration to retrieve an analyte in a more enriched state.22,27
2.5.4 Extraction procedure. The chromatographic column (0.8 cm diameter) was packed with 1 g dry extractor to achieve a bed height of 2.5 cm. The pH of the column was adjusted at 6.5 using hexamine buffer. An aliquot containing 11.7 mL of Th(IV) (4 × 10−2 mol L−1) in 20 mL hexamine buffer (pH 2.5–7.5) was passed through the column continuously till its saturation (498 μmol g−1) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL−1 min at 27 °C to assess the effect of pH on extraction. The extraction reached equilibrium within a few minutes. Increasing in the phase-mixing time up to 20 min had no significant effect on the extraction. Aqueous chemistry of Th(IV) is pH dependent5,6 and the conductance as well as the extraction is species dependent.7 Therefore, systematic studies have also been made to investigate the effect of pH on conductance (mS) of aqueous Th(IV) solution at various intervals of pH. After extraction Th(IV) was stripped with 0.1 mol L−1 HNO3 and the amount of Th(IV) in each fraction was determined complexometrically.
2.5.5 Effect of pH on extraction and conductance of Th(IV) solution. Extraction is pH dependent and Th(IV) exists as different species at different pH. Again, conductance is always species dependent. Therefore, systematic studies have been made for both extraction and conductance at the range of pH 3.5–9.5 to assess the relationship of extraction and conductance.
2.5.6 Effect of foreign ions on extraction. Th(IV) in a pure sample was found to be extracted on the FSG-EBT surface and reached equilibrium quickly. Considering its analytical application in real samples, the extractability of Th(IV) was therefore systematically investigated in the presence of some commonly occurring ions [Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Mg(II), Cl−, SO42−, ClO4−, NO3− up to 300 μg) and co-existing foreign ions such as La(III), Ce(IV), Eu(III), Dy(III) in their natural contamination concentration (up to 0.5–5 μg L−1)56 ranges (Table 1). Systematic studies of foreign ion stress on extraction of Th(IV) (sample volume = 50 mL) have been made by adding the foreign ions at constant flow-rate, analyte volume and temperature.
2.5.7 Elution of Th(IV). Systematic studies have been made on the elution behavior of Th(IV) with several acids of different concentrations (1.25 × 10−3 to 500 × 10−3 mol L−1). Stripped Th(IV) was collected in several fractions (2 mL each) and estimated complexometrically using xylenol orange as an indicator. 500 × 10−3 (mol L−1) HClO4 required least volume (5 mL) for the complete elution of Th(IV) and regarding its analytical convenience (identification and estimation) it was used to achieve the highest enrichment factor, Vs/12 × recovery (%) (Vs = sample volume); for sample clean-up of the analyte (Table 2).
2.5.8 Breakthrough capacity. For the determination of breakthrough capacity (BTC), 20 mL fractions of metal ion solution (10 μmol mL−1) were passed through the column at an optimized pH (6.0) and effluent was collected until the amount of metal ion concentration was the same in the feed and the effluent. A breakthrough curve was obtained by plotting the ratio Ce/C0 against the effluent volume, where C0 and Ce are the concentrations of the initial solution and effluent respectively. BTC is calculated using the formula (C0V(10%)/W), where C0 is the concentration of the metal ion in mg mL−1, V(10%) is the volume of the metal ion solution passed through the column when the exit amount reaches 10% of the initial amount (mg) and W is the weight of the extractor in g.
2.5.9 Optimization of preconcentration factor. The sample clean-up of an analyte through preconcentration from a solution of large volume of relatively low concentration has an enormous implication in analytical chemistry. Preconcentration factor (PF) depends on the recovery and analyte volume. PF (= Cf/Ci × recovery (%)) is the product of the ratio of concentrations and the recovery of analyte. So, to assess the analytical performance of the synthesized extractor systematic studies have been made on the effect of sample size for the recovery of Th(IV). Effect of volume and concentration on extraction has an inverse relationship on PF. So, its optimization has been made with respect to these two variables.
2.5.10 Studies on the extraction of both high and low oxidation state. To investigate the sorption of both high and low oxidation states, the ion-exchange material was fully saturated with Zr(IV) (490 μmol g−1), a cation which is stable in its high oxidation state (E0(ZrO2+/Zr) = −157 mV) at a range of pH of 2.5–3.0. After that, an aliquot containing 12 mL of Tl(I) (10−2 mol L−1), a species of low oxidation state in 20 mL hexamine buffer (pH 6.5–7.0) was passed through the column continuously to reach the saturation point (120 μmol g−1). 0.01 mol L−1 HCl was used to strip thallium as Tl(I), identified as a yellow ppt8 of Tl2CrO4 with CrO42− and subsequently Zr(IV) which is tightly bind at the exchange site, was eluted with the help of a strong eluent (≥2 mol L−1 HNO3). Breakthrough value of the extractor for U(VI) and Tl(I) pair was found to be 522 and 127 μmol g−1. Tl(I) and U(VI) were eluted with 0.01 mol L−1 HCl and 0.05 mol L−1 H2SO4, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical characteristics of the extractor in terms of SEM, TEM, BET analysis
The SEM micrographs of FSG-EBT (Fig. 1a) confirm that both free and Th(IV) loaded material are porous and the particle size is slightly irregular (approx. 110–150 μm) of almost the same for both forms. It can also be noted that the surface of FSG-EBT is much cleaner than its Th(IV)-loaded form (Fig. 1b). The particle sizes (Fig. 1a and b) of unloaded and loaded exchanger are of same order of magnitude (100 μm, i.e., 108 pm) and it is very much close to that of the pure silica gel (60 mesh to 120 mesh, i.e., 100 particles cm−1) particles (∼108 pm). The TEM and SEAD images (Fig. 1c and d) of the corresponding nanomaterial confirm that the size of the particles (12–24 nm) prevails within the size-range of nano SG (10–20 nm).

Usually DMDCS amid Si(OH)4 enhances the size of SG by catenation through its cross linking (silanization;21,22,27 Scheme 2). But here, being sandwiched between the SG and m-nitroaniline, it simply acts as a bridging component (Scheme 1) and is unable to promote catenation any further (Scheme 3). This suggests that as an end capping agent nitroaniline very efficiently impedes the process of cross linking.
 Scheme 2  Silanization reaction; DMDCS amid Si(OH)4 enhances the size of SG by catenation through its cross linking. 
 Scheme 3  DMDCS being sandwiched between the SG and m-nitroaniline simply acts as a bridging component and becomes unable to promote catenation any further; m-nitroaniline group acts as the end capping group. 
At P/P0 = 0.0–1.0 FSG-EBT possesses high BET (Fig. 1e) with SA = 330.97 m2 g−1, PV = 0.388974 cm3 g−1, t-plot micro PV = 0.007751 cm3 g−1 and uniform pore size (width 47.0 Å/diameter 46.2 Å). The investigation confirms that the material is mesoporous in nature and its pore diameter lies below 50 Å (File-S1†).
3.2. TGA, EDX and XRD analysis to find out the composition of the extractor
Amorphous SG appears to contain {Si(OSi)3(OH)·xH2O}n.57 TGA analysis of FSG-EBT (Fig. 2a) shows three regions of weight loss. TGA has 8.83% of weight loss up to 100 °C for sorbed water molecules. In the 2nd step the weight loss of 0.72% indicates removal of molecular water for the conversion of {Si[OSi]p=2–4[OH]m=2–0·xH2O}n to {Si[OSi]p=2–4[OH]m=2–0}n polymer, and it continues up to 120 °C. Then the 3rd stage of weight loss begins and continues up to 800 °C. The weight loss of 7.42% at the 3rd stage is due to its thermal decomposition and leaves the residue of inorganic ash as (SiO2)4n+4 polymers. The probable composition of the synthesized resin is [Si(OSi)3(OH)·xH2O]n[–Si(CH3)2–NH–C6H4–NN–EBT]4 (Scheme 1) and the molecular mass of the moiety attached to the [Si(OSi)3(OH)]n[–Si]4 framework is 2440. To account for the 7.42% weight loss, the calculated value of n is 28. Weight loss at the second stage gives the value of x as 0.108. This yields the molecular mass (M) as 7.563 × 103 and so, 1 g resin can generate 1/M mol extractor (i.e., 132.2 μM g−1 HOMO or LUMO). These exchange sites (HOMO or LUMO) are able to extract 132.2 or 529 μmol g−1 of Th(IV) when it exists as a monomer or tetramer, respectively. Comparing the TGA curves of the extractor in Th(IV)-loaded (wt loss = 8.89%) and unloaded forms (wt loss = 8.15%) in the range of temperature 100–800 °C (Fig. 2a), the difference in weight (0.74%) has been rationalized with the conversion of extracted Th(IV)-species into its inorganic ash containing (ThO2)n. It suggests the weight of the extracted species as 1064.16 g (eqn (1)) and reveals that a μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer, [Th4(OH)8]8+ is present in the extractor as the sorbed species. This, in turn, suggests the breakthrough capacity of FSG-EBT for Th(IV) as 529 μmol g−1.

(c) XRD spectra of the synthesized resin (e) XRD spectra of the Zr(IV) and Tl(I) loaded extractor (2θ = 21.92) and (f) XRD spectra of the silica gel. 
The calculated atomic composition (%) (Si: 25.90; O: 42.90; C: 25.0; Th: 0.89) obtained from TGA/DTA analysis and EDX (Fig. 2b and c) values (Si: 20.60%; C: 29.49%; O: 49.68% and Th: 0.53%) reiterates the composition, [Si(OSi)3(OH)·xH2O]n[–Si(CH3)2–NH–C6H4–NN–EBT]4 of FSG-EBT as well as the loaded extractor containing a μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer, [Th4(OH)8]8+. The sorbed water molecules (yH2O/M g−1) generate a pore volume of (51 × 18/7563.00) = 10.121380 mL g−1 and it attains 50% of the experimental (BET) values of 0.389 mL g−1. So, all the pores are not of correct sizes to intake water molecules. The XRD reflection patterns of FSG-EBT (Fig. 2d), FSG-EBT containing both Zr(IV) and Tl(I) (Fig. 2e) and amorphous silica gel (Fig. 2f) exhibit a single broad peak at 2θ = 22.38, 21.92 and 22.0°, respectively. This clearly suggests the absence of any kind of long range ordering in the molecular network of FSG-EBT and its metal loaded form. Consequently, the amorphous identity of the precursor, SG (2θ = 22.0) (Fig. 2f) was found to be retained in both the pure extractor and its metal loaded form. During the synthesis of FSG-EBT, reaction takes place at the outer surface of the central core [{(SiO2)n–O–}4; n = 28] and retains its amorphous identity as per the suggested reaction path (Schemes 1 and S3†). It also reveals that the metal sorption process has no or little influence on the central silica core. Here, the sorption of metal ions occur at the EBT moiety, present outside the silica core [{(SiO2)n–O–}4.
3.3. Structural identification of the resin by FT-IR, Raman, NMR and MS
The presence of various groups, viz., NO2, –SO and –OH in –SO3H, –C–C– of naphthalene ring, –NN–, C–H of CH3 in Si, aromatic C–H, O–H in SO3H, N–H in (Si–N(H)–C(aromatic-ring)), O–H(phenolic), O–H in Si(OH)3 in the synthesized extractor have been characterized by comparing the experimental, theoretical (DFT) and the reported peak positions in FT-IR/Raman spectra (together with the proposed assignments summarized in Table S1†) (Fig. 3a and b). The predicted B3LYP/6-31G wavenumbers are in consistently good agreement with the experimental FT-IR values. The presence of N–H in –Si–N(H)–Ar at 3525 cm−1 (reported: 3100–3500 and DFT: 3540.51) confirms linkage between the silica moiety and nitroaniline. A nice correlation has been observed in the experimental (FT-IR (symmetric): 2400, 2616 cm−1; FT-IR (asymmetric): 1800 cm−1), DFT (FT-IR (symmetric): 2578 cm−1; FT-IR (asymmetric): 1710, 1855.09 cm−1) and the corresponding reported values for –NN– group (Table S1†). It confirms the binding of azo-dye (EBT) with FSG. The strong FT-IR absorption band at 3697 cm−1 undergoes a shift to 2980–3673 cm−1 as a broad peak in the Th(IV) loaded spectra, thereby confirming the presence of intramolecular H-bonding in the μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer, [Th4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (Fig. 3b). The Raman peak (Fig. 3a) appearing at 440 cm−1 (DFT) for –NH (attached to Si of DMDCS) is highly compatible with the experimental Raman spectral features (at 420 and 421 cm−1, respectively, in the extractor and its Th(IV) loaded form) (Fig. S1†), thereby confirming the formation of FSG. Si–O–Si linkage has been well characterized by the Raman band appearing at 781 cm−1 (DFT) and its experimental peak at 787793 cm−1 (in both the loaded and unloaded forms).
 Fig. 3  (a) FT-IR and Raman spectra of DFT optimized structure of FSG-EBT; (b) experimental FT-IR spectra. 
The Raman peaks at 1800–1850 cm−1 (DFT) and 1800–1815 cm−1 (experimental) confirms the presence of –NN– groups in the synthesized material. The presence of aromatic rings is well assessed by the Raman bands appearing at 1200 cm−1 (DFT) and 1203 cm−1 (experimental) for aromatic C–C stretching vibration. Interestingly a new peak appears at 815 cm−1 in the Raman spectra in the Th(IV)-loaded extractor, which is in conformity with the presence of Th–O–Th in a μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer.58 It also agrees the TGA and EDX analysis. The 1H (400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.26 (1H, s, ArH), 8.19 (1H, s, ArH), 7.72 (2H, d, J = 4.8 Hz, ArH), 4.88 (1H, s, NH), 0.221 (6H, bs, CH3) and 13C NMR δ (ppm): [six aromatic carbons: 148.48, 132.76, 131.36, 129.01, 123.20, 117.83 and two methyl carbons at Si: 30.32] spectra of intermediate D (the peaks found at lower and higher ranges are given in ESI Fig. S2†) clearly confirm the attachment of m-nitroaniline to SG through DMDCS to functionalize the silica, (FSG). Now, turning to the behavior of the extractor molecule in terms of its experimental 1H (400 MHz) δ (ppm): 7.044–8.135 (13 ArH); 2.161–2.430 (6H, CH3) and 13C [20 aromatic carbons: 121.01–148.40 with the shortage of 6 aromatic carbons due to probable symmetry properties of the molecule] NMR spectra (Fig. S2(c–f)†), it is found that the experimental spectra are very compatible with the DFT NMR signatures [1H (400 MHz) δ (ppm): 13 ArH and 13C: 26 aromatic carbons] (Fig. S2(a and b)†). Electrospray ionization-MS analysis shows six major fragments with m/z 694.5, 755.5, 813.5, 1103.5, 1159.3, 2126.5 resembling the fragmentation pattern (Fig. 4a–f), of the extractor material. These fragmentation patterns reveal the attachment of different moieties ((SiO2)n, DMDCS, NH, EBT) and it confirms the reaction path (Scheme 1) for the synthesis of the extractor.
 Fig. 4  Electrospray ionization-TOF-derived mass spectrum of the synthesized extractor (a–f). 
On the basis of these systematic investigations, the composition of the synthesized resin can be denoted as [Si(OSi)3(OH)·0.108H2O]28[–Si(CH3)2–NH–C6H4–NN–EBT]4 and its structural identification confirmed the 2D structure of the molecule (Fig. 5a).

3.4. DFT analysis
The extractor has been synthesized from amorphous silica gel and it is a high molecular mass polymeric material. As a result of this, single-crystal XRD analysis was precluded to ascertain the three-dimensional structure of the material. Therefore, density functional theory calculations have been performed on this 2D structure (Fig. 5a) to obtain the 3D optimized structure of this material. All DFT59 calculations have been made by using STO-3G basis set with B3LYP/6 hybrid function to obtain the optimized structure (Fig. 5b) and its global hardness was calculated from the resulting HOMO–LUMO band gap. In the DFT optimized molecule (Fig. 5b), four EBT moieties are attached at the four tetrahedral corners (labelled as 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th O) of the central silicon (1st Si) through the linker component (substituted m-diazaniline group) and the bridging component (DMDCS). The optimized compound possesses high dipole moment (6.7214 Debye). At any time interval, the HOMO (−5.7675 eV) is suitably located at only one m-diazaniline part moiety out of four (and to a slight extent on the dimethyl group of DMDCS), while the LUMO (3.2431 eV) is highly localized on the region of a m-diazaniline moiety and one naphthol ring of the EBT moiety. During optimization it is found that HOMO and LUMO are present at two different edges of the tetrahedra (Fig. 6a–d) with a photosensitized level of HOMO–LUMO band gap of 7.1471 eV. With passage of time, both HOMO and LUMO which were initially present at two different edges of the tetrahedra, change their positions. They do this preferably instead of clustering at the same edge of the tetrahedra or overlapping each other (Fig. 6a–d). As a result of this the process of charge recombination is denied. This, undoubtedly, increases the lifetime of the ejected photoelectron to increase the solar efficiency (as per Schemes S1 and S2†).60–62
 Fig. 6  Spatial positions of the HOMO and LUMO at different time intervals (a–d), ηFSG-EBT = 9.0106 eV; dipole moment = 8.3613 Debye. 
Considering the symmetry properties of the molecule only one tetrahedral edge of FSG-EBT was taken as a model compound (Fig. S2c†) to generate the NMR spectra from DFT calculation. Thus the NMR fingerprint (Fig. S2 and S3†) generates a fullproof molecular identity of the extractor material (Fig. 5a and b). The theoretical UV-vis spectra (two major peaks at 699.4 and 432.2 nm (Fig. S4†), obtained by TD-DFT optimization of the extractor, is highly compatible with the experimental UV-vis spectral features (two major peaks at 578 and 450 nm) and reiterates the molecular structure of the extractor. The experimental spectral positions (274, 366.4, 450, 578, 880.5, 950.3 and 1094.5 nm) (Fig. 7a and b) are nearly compatible and support the transfer of a hole by a hopping mechanism (Fig. S5†). The presence of both HOMO and LUMO in the same molecule (Fig. S5†) with a clean demarcation makes it an ideal candidate to be used as a donor–acceptor organic electronic device.62 We hope to explore this aspect in the near future. Now, turning to its metal binding abilities, the theoretical calculation reveals that metal ion in a higher oxidation state may bind through the HOMO, while the LUMO, being far apart from HOMO (7.1471 eV), placed at the other part of the molecule would be involved in the binding of metal in a lower oxidation state.

3.5. Analytical application of the synthesized resin for Th(IV), Zr(IV), U(VI) and Tl(I)
3.5.1 Analysis of the sorption isotherm. A plot of Ce (μM g−1) vs. Ce/qe (g mL−1) gives a linear relationship (Fig. S6†) (y = 0.00904x + 0.00117; R2 = 0.98928) with a slope of 0.00904 which generates Q0 as 110.62 mg g−1 (i.e., 476.7 μM g−1) and b (energy parameter of adsorption) was found to be 7.7265 L g−1 respectively. The very high energy parameter (Langmuir b = 7.7265 L g−1) suggests high affinity of the adsorbent towards the adsorbate and supports the fast rate of equilibration (<1.0 min). The higher RMSE (0.9636) and poor Freundlich binding parameter for physisorption (n = 1.61) (Table S2†) also precludes multilayer formation (Fig. S3†).
3.5.2 Effect of pH on extraction and conductance. The pH of the influent solution is an important controlling parameter in the sorption process.63,64 The pH–extraction and pH–conductance relationships (Fig. 8) clearly indicate the presence of different Th(IV) species at different pH. The retention (mg g−1) increases with the increase in pH (a–d), reaches a maximum at the pH range 6.5–7.5 and then decreases (d and e) with further increase in pH. The studies show that there is a sharp jump (b and c) for extraction at the moderate range of pH, 4.5–5.25. The systematic studies for conductance of the analyte solution at the prevailing range of pH and concentration (4 × 10−2 mol L−1 of Th(IV) in 20 mL hexamine buffer (pH 2.5–7.5)) show a gradual decrease in both the initial (a and b) and final part (c and d) of the pH–conductance relationship (Fig. 8) with a similar type of sharp sigmoidal jump at pH axis (b and c) as for the pH–extraction relationship. This clearly indicates the change of analyte species from one to another according to the change of pH from 4.5 to 5.25. Further enhancement of pH at this short interval may increase the population of the latter species causing a gradual rise up to its limiting values reaching pH 7.0 ± 0.25. The problem of hydrolysis comes in to the play with further increase of pH and we observe noticeable depletion in the extent of extraction in the pH–extraction relationship (Fig. 8a). At the initial part of the pH–extraction relationship, the gradual rise is reflected by the existing species having low level of affinity towards the exchange site resulting in a poor extraction (confined to 30% only). Affinity between the acid (Th(IV)) and base (exchanger) is guided by the definite quantum mechanical descriptor, viz. the hardness, η.

3.5.3 Effect of common cations/anions and flow-rate on extraction. The systematic extraction chromatographic studies on Th(IV) ensured its quantitative extraction at the optimum pH 7.0 ± 0.5 (Fig. 8a). Common cations/anions (Cd2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Na+, K+, SO42−, ClO4−, CH3COO− and NO3− up to 250 μg), co-existing lanthanide ions (such as La(III), Ce(IV), Dy(III) and Eu(III) up to 5 μg L−1) and flow rate up to 2.5 mL min−1 did not cause interference (Table 1) in the sorption of Th(IV). The recoveries (%) of Th(IV) were nearly quantitative (>91%) and the analytical performance of extractor with respect to the standard deviation (<0.05) was found to be good. At low pH (<5.0), the otherwise difficult deprotonation of FSG and solubility of Th(IV) led to poor sorption.27

3.5.4 Breakthrough capacity. The analyte concentration in the effluent was close to 10% to that of the background level up to passage of 49.8 mL (0.01 mol L−1) Th(IV) solution (Fig. 9a) and it attains BTC at 498 μmol g−1 of dry extractor. Now turning to its surface behavior, FSG-EBT sorbs the analyte as a monolayer on its external surface (Langmuir: Fig. S6†). The determined Q0 corroborates the breakthrough value (498 μmol g−1) and suggests the chemisorption of Th(IV) as a tetramer (TGA = 527 μmol g−1) at the exchange site. It is also comparable to the TGA (527 μmol g−1). At a fixed amount of Th(IV) the volume–recovery relationship yields two desorption constants (k1 = 2 × 10−3 and k2 = 9.6 × 10−2 and PF (Fig. 9b) is optimized2,17,22 at their points of intersection with a value of 120.20 ± 0.04 (Fig. 9b and c).

3.5.5 Extracted species. The distribution of Th(IV)-species depends on the level of pH, the total Th(IV) concentration, and the ratio (n) of [OH−]/[Th4+] in the complex.65 μ2-O-hydroxo dimer, [Th2(OH)2(H2O)12]6+ is found to be present at n = 1 while the polymeric species, a μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer, [Th4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+, and a μ3-O-oxo hexamer, [Th6O8(H2O)n]8+), occur at n > 2.0.63 It has also been observed that at pH > 2.9 and concentration of Th(IV) > 10−3 M both these polymeric species (μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer and μ3-O-oxo hexamer) are the prime contributors.63–69 In our study at its prevailing conditions (pH = 6.5, [Th4+] = 10−2 mol L−1 and [OH]−/[Th4+] = 10−5.5) the maximum sorption of Th(IV) becomes 498 μmol g−1 (FSG:Th(IV) = 1:4) and corroborates TGA = 527 μmol g−1 and Langmuir = 476.7 μmol g−1 values (Table S2†). In the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 10) the absorbance maxima at 424.6 nm for pure extractor (nano form) in DMSO has been totally removed at a mole ratio of 1:4 (extractor:Th(IV) and reiterates the sorption ratio. Now, at any particular time interval, the HOMO, available to bind Th(IV) by electron donation, exists at one edge of the tetrahedra of the resin (Fig. 11a) (DFT). This in turn indicates that Th(IV) exists as its tetramer (at pH 6.5 and [Th4+] = 10−2 mol L−1) in the vicinity of the HOMO in the extractor–metal complex (Fig. 11b).
 Fig. 10  UV-visible spectrum of the extractor and its change upon complexation with Th(IV). 
 Fig. 11  Extractor–Th(IV) complex species: (a) μ2-O-hydroxo tetramer, [Th4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+; (b) Th(IV) exists as its tetramer in the vicinity of HOMO in the extractor–metal complex. 

3.5.6 Simultaneous sorption of both high and low oxidation state species. In the prevailing condition for extraction (pH = 6.5 and [Zr(IV)] = 10−2 mol L−1), both the tetranuclear [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ and octanuclear [Zr8(OH)20(H2O)24]12+ species of Zr(IV) are present in equilibrium.61 The compatibility of breakthrough value of Zr(IV) (490 μmol g−1) with Langmuir (Q0 = 476.7 μmol g−1) and TGA (527 μmol g−1) indicates the ratio of HOMO:metal as 1:4. So, Zr(IV) is present as a tetramer. DFT calculations produce a symmetric LUMO core within the tetrameric entity of tetranuclear [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ which efficiently makes a bond with HOMO of FSG-EBT (Fig. 12). Now, after attaining BTC [i.e., when HOMO is totally blocked with Zr(IV)], Tl(I) (an electron rich species) is forced to move towards the LUMO (Fig. 12) of FSG-EBT to make its synergistic attachment as a monomer (BTC = 120 μmol g−1) by back-donation in the presence of a very stable and poor oxidizer Zr(IV) (E0(ZrO2+/Zr) = −157 mV).
 Fig. 12  Simultaneous binding of Zr(IV) and Tl(I) at the HOMO and LUMO, respectively, of the extractor (FSG-EBT): donation of electron cloud from HOMO of extractor to LUMO of the zirconium species and back-donation of electron cloud from HOMO of thallium species to LUMO of the extractor. 
Thus, both the metal ions rarely and remarkably exist in two different spatial locations of FSG-EBT at their high and low oxidation states (Fig. 12) keeping intact the core identity of the extractor (XRD results; Fig. 2e). The behavior was tested with Th(IV), U(VI) and Ti(IV), (elements of transition series) and the result [518, 522 and 260 μmol g−1 for Th(IV), U(VI) and Ti(IV) along with 124–128 μmol g−1 Tl(I)] shows remarkable agreement with the simultaneous sorption abilities for high and low oxidation states of the extractor at its respective HOMO–LUMO levels. Here, at the prevailing condition for extraction (pH = 6.5 and [Ti(IV)] = 10−2 mol L−1), Ti(IV) exists as a dimer27 while both Th(IV) and U(VI) are reported to exist as tetramers.61,65 However, in the reverse sequence of sorption, thallium in its stable Tl(I) form cannot appreciably attack the less electronegative LUMO of the pure extractor (8–10 μmol g−1). The sorption of Tl(I) at the LUMO was slow (equilibration time = 10 min) probably because of the rapid change in position of LUMO from one tetrahedral edge to another. The sorption of metal ions [Th(IV), Zr(IV), U(VI) and Ti(IV)] with other extractors (FSG-X; where, X were EBBBB, NV, GNV, PAN) was found to be a integral multiple of HOMO/LUMO values (μmol g−1) (Table 4).

3.5.7 Effect of desorption condition and repeated use. The sorption of Th(IV) on the resin was very low below pH 1.5. So, systematic studies on its elution were made with different acid solutions of various concentrations (10 × 10−3 to 2000 × 10−3 mol L−1) (Table 2). These results indicate that 500 × 10−3 (mol L−1) HClO4 (5 mL) is sufficient for quantitative elution for Th(IV) (Fig. S7†) and it yields a good column efficiency (CE) in terms of plate number (N = 296).22 To investigate the reusability of the resin, the sorption and desorption cycles were repeated 800–1000 times by using the same adsorbent and BTC was decreased by only 0.2–0.3%.
Table 2 Elution study of Th(IV) [Th(IV) taken = 3.94 mg; column: 0.8 × 8 cm; flow rate = 1 mL min−1, pH = 7.0 ± 0.5; temp. = 25 °C]

3.5.8 Optimization of preconcentration factor. Systematic studies have been made on the extraction and recovery of Th(IV) (1 mL solution of 0.01 mol L−1) with respect to influent volume of different sample sizes (100–1200 mL). Plot of influent volume vs. recovery (%) yields two linear segments (Fig. 9b) (y = −0.002x + 99.65; R2 = 0.992 and y = −0.096x + 150.7; R2 = 0.947) intersecting at a volume of 600 mL. The slopes of the corresponding segments are the desorption efficiencies and yielded the desorption constants9 Kdesorption1 (2 × 10−3) and Kdesorption2 (9.6 × 10−2). Up to 600 mL the recoveries were quantitative (≥97%) and then it decreases gradually. During sample clean-up (extraction followed by stripping with 5 mL 0.5 mol L−1 HClO4), the analyte solution containing Th(IV) is always confined to small volume (5 mL). At the initial stage of quantitative range of recovery, the first term Vinfluent/Veffluent of PF (eqn (2)) predominates. This promotes a sharp increase of the enrichment factor and consequently improves the analytical detection limit. However, enrichment factor gradually decreases due to its poor recovery (Kdesorption2 ≫ Kdesorption1) at a higher dilution (volume effect)9 and the value was optimized at 120.2 (y = −0.096x + 150.7; R2 = 0.947) at an influent volume of 640 mL (Fig. 9c).

3.5.9 Analytical performance in comparison to other matrices. The sorption process on FSG-EBT follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a high adsorption coefficient Q0 = 110.62 mg g−1 (i.e., 476.7 μmol g−1) and high energy parameter of adsorption (b = 7.7265 L g−1). Q0 indicates the amount of Th(IV) for the monolayer saturation and it represents the adsorption capacity (i.e., BTC, 498 μmol g−1) of the ion-exchange material. The value of this adsorption capacity (476.7–498 μmol g−1) (Table 3) is comparable to that of other matrices. On the other hand, the BET surface area (330.97 m2 g−1) of the present extractor is also found to be comparatively much higher than earlier reported functionalized silica gel sorbents (FSG-Xs = 125–149 m2 g−1) for Th(IV) uptake.27,28,36 In addition to that, the present extractor binds a second metal centre (Tl(I), a low oxidation state) utilizing its LUMO, present at a different spatial location. Thereby, this increases the BTC by an amount of 120 μmol g−1, which may be enhanced up to 498 μmol g−1, the HOMO level BTC value.

4. Conclusions
In comparison to other matrices (Table 3), we herein for the first time report three important outcomes as follows:
(1) An efficient (yield = 99%, at room temp), rapid (2–3 min), metal-free catalytic and green (in view of some commonly available solvents/chemicals in a very simple laboratory set up and without the involvement of complicated steps with stringent reaction conditions) grafting protocol, recognizable through naked eye observation. The material has been well characterized (composition: [Si(OSi)3(OH)·xH2O]n[–Si(CH3)2–NH–C6H4–NN–EBT]4 and structure: tetrahedral) and it is further corroborated by standard DFT calculations. TGA was found to be sufficient to elucidate the composition of this kind of material. Additionally, the corresponding nanomaterial gives well-characterized NMR signals in solution phase and rules out any need of solid-phase NMR measurement. The material is mesoporous with uniform pore size (pore width 47.0 Å/pore diameter 46.2 Å).
(2) With respect to other matrices (Table 3), along with its analytical performances [high BET SA (331.0 m2), high BET PV (0.3890 cm3 g−1), high BTC (490–527 μmol g−1), reusability (up to 500–800 cycles), high PF = 120.20 ± 0.04), inertness (chemically: up to 6 mol L−1 HNO3, 8 mol L−1 HCl, 6 mol L−1 H2SO4 and thermally: 320 °C (mp)] it uniquely binds two metal centers, Zr(IV)/U(VI)/Ti(IV) and Tl(I), in their high and low oxidation states simultaneously at its respective HOMO and LUMO which are spatially separated (Scheme 4a). Thus, it differs from earlier reported materials in an important aspect, i.e. stabilization of high (e.g. transition metal complexes having ligands such as IO65−)69 and low (carbonyls)52,70 oxidation states of metals (Scheme 4b).
 Scheme 4  (a) FSG-EBT uniquely binds two metal centers, Zr(IV)/U(VI)/Ti(IV) and Tl(I), in their high and low oxidation states simultaneously at its respective HOMO and LUMO which are spatially separated. (b) HOMO and LUMO are not spatially separated in the ligand. Stabilization of high (by ligand like IO65−) or low (by ligand like carbonyls) oxidation states of metals. 
(3) The number and nature of exchange sites (e.g., phenolic –OH, –SO3H or –NO2) of the extractor are not the determining parameters for metal binding (BTC) but it is the availability of HOMO/LUMO or its integral multiple value (n × HOMO/LUMO μM g−1) that capture them in their high/low oxidation state. Therefore, HOMO/LUMO value is a definite quantum mechanical descriptor of BTC and BTC is a definite descriptor of the state of the metal (monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) sorbed. Two different BTC for metal sorption in their high and low oxidation states may be obtained when the HOMO and LUMO are well placed at two different spatial locations in the extractor. The classical BTC (saturation of HOMO) of FSG-EBT is sufficiently high (490–527 μmol g−1) (Table 4) and has been enhanced by 120 μmol g−1 for Tl(I) utilizing its LUMO, which even may be enhanced up to 490–527 μmol g−1 (the HOMO value). The analytical performances were found to be poor in the corresponding nanomaterial. In addition to the above, two other features include; (i) TGA was found to be adequate to elucidate the composition of this kind of exchange material. (ii) The corresponding nanomaterial gave well-characterized NMR signals in solution phase and ruled out any need for solid phase NMR.
