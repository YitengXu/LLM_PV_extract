1. Introduction
Green chemistry is a philosophy of chemical research and engineering that encourages the design of products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. Paul Anastas and John C. Warner proposed 12 principles of green chemistry, which aim to maximize the conversion of raw materials into products; minimize the amount of waste disposal; promote the use of safe, environmentally benign substances including solvents; and facilitate the design of energy-efficient processes.1,2 For greener materials synthesis, the following points should also be considered (concept of green sustainable chemistry was proposed by GSCN3): (1) contribution of products to minimizing environmental problems (e.g., reducing CO2 emissions and providing environmental catalysts); (2) recycling of materials to resources; (3) holistic life cycle assessment of materials; and (4) combining multiple technological and operational systems to reduce energy and resource use.
Supercritical fluid technology is expected to contribute to new materials synthesis with green sustainable chemistry, especially to nanomaterials.4 In the fabrication of nanomaterials, it is important to control the surface energy of the nanomaterials or the heterointerfaces. Several supercritical fluid technologies have been proposed to solve environmental problems in materials synthesis, as shown in Table 1. For example, supercritical CO2 drying can be used to dry semiconductor patterns without forming a gas–liquid interface, i.e., a capillary force, to prevent the collapse of fine patterns. Diffusivity in supercritical CO2 is higher than that in liquid, and since the reaction is less than first order (i.e., the Thiele modulus approaches unity), uniform and conformal deposition is possible with increased productivity.

Supercritical water can form a homogeneous phase with inorganic and organic substances, and water itself works as an acid or base catalyst.4
In this paper, we introduce some aspects of green solvents using supercritical water for processing green materials. First, the properties and some specific features of supercritical water are summarized briefly for better understanding of supercritical reaction solvents. Then, we describe the supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of nanoparticles and various applications of green materials. The surface control of nanoparticles in supercritical water is also explained. We then discuss the chemical recycling of waste polymers in supercritical water. New green processes that combine hydrothermal synthesis and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) are also considered. Finally, commercialization of supercritical water synthesis (SCWS) is introduced.
2. Supercritical hydrothermal synthesis
2.1 Mechanism
The supercritical state is defined as the thermodynamic state above the critical temperature and critical pressure. For water, the critical temperature and pressure are 646 K and 22.1 MPa, respectively. In the supercritical state, various fluid properties change, including density of molecules, diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Because of supercritical water's intriguing properties, especially around the critical point, various studies have examined its characteristics. Hydrothermal synthesis is performed in water at elevated temperature and pressure. Various materials including metal oxides and zeolites are prepared by this method. If we perform hydrothermal synthesis in supercritical water, we obtain small nanoparticles of metal oxides because of the properties of supercritical water. The dielectric constant of water at room temperature is 78 and decreases considerably with increasing temperature (Fig. 1). Around the critical point of water, this value is nearly equal to the dielectric constant of polar organic solvents. In hydrothermal synthesis, the dielectric constant controls the reaction rate, equilibrium, and solubility of metal oxides.
 Fig. 1  Dielectric constant of water. 
Tadafumi Adschiri pioneered the supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of metal oxides during the 1990s through extensive studies. The complete mechanism for the formation of various metal oxides has been discussed extensively.5–11 The solubility and distribution of ionic species can be predicted by calculating the reaction equilibrium constant for each reaction, the mass balance, and the charge balance. Several models are currently available for estimating the solubility of the species of interest on the basis of the dissociation reaction in a given system. The experimental results can be correlated well with various models to express the increase in solubility with increasing temperature (for positive solubility materials), the increase in solubility with decreasing temperature (for negative solubility materials), and the dramatic decrease in solubility around the critical point.12 This is the greatest advantage of supercritical hydrothermal conditions. Fig. 2 illustrates how significantly the solubility of metal oxides around the critical point changes owing to variations in the properties of water. The solubility first increases with an increase in temperature and then decreases. This decrease occurs because the density and dielectric constant decrease. Sue et al. described in detail a method for estimating metal oxide solubility.13 The decrease in solubility leads to a higher degree of supersaturation. According to the nucleation theory, the nucleation rate is expressed as a function of the degree of supersaturation and the surface energy. Thus, an extremely high nucleation rate can be expected under supercritical conditions, which leads to the formation of small nanoparticles of metal oxides, if the solution is rapidly heated up to the supercritical state. Adschiri and coworkers proposed a continuous flow reaction system to achieve the rapid heating and demonstrated the nanoparticle synthesis in supercritical water.5,6

2.2 Supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles
By employing the principles discussed above, various metal oxide nanoparticles have been obtained under supercritical hydrothermal conditions for applications in not only ceramics, coatings, catalysts, sensors, semiconductors, magnetic data storage, solar energy devices, and ferrofluids, but also medical fields such as hyperthermia treatments, bioimaging, cell labeling, and special drug delivery systems. We have synthesized various metal oxide nanoparticles, as shown in Table 2.

The supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles is green not only because it requires only water as a solvent but also because the resulting nanomaterials contribute to a sustainable society. For example, we have synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles under highly controlled supercritical hydrothermal conditions from a flow reactor.36TiO2 shows photocatalytic activity and photovoltaic properties, and therefore its synthesis contributes directly to the realization of sustainability. Because supercritical hydrothermal synthesis is performed in water using precursors, as shown in Table 2, the production cost of metal oxide nanoparticles (energy requirement from the green sustainable chemistry point of view) is much lower than that of other methods. Therefore, we believe that this method might significantly affect the production of nanomaterials for a greener society. Similarly, we have succeeded in synthesizing cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, including LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, and LiFePO4, which contributes to a green sustainable society. Fig. 3 shows a transmission electron microscopy image of LiMn2O4 nanoparticles (10–20 nm in size) synthesized from LiOH, Mn(NO3)2, and H2O2 at 673 K and 30 MPa. The capacity of these particles does not decay even after multiple charge–discharge cycles, which has been considered a major breakthrough point of these solid electrolyte materials.10,22 Kanamura et al. discussed this mechanism in detail and concluded that these particles are single nanocrystals of LiMn2O4 and are totally different from those obtained by other methods.18 In the synthesis of LiMn2O4 nanoparticles, the oxidizing reaction atmosphere must be controlled by regulating the oxygen gas partial pressure in the system. In this case, Mn2+ in Mn(NO3)2 should be oxidized to Mn3+. To achieve this, H2O2 was fed into the system. Under supercritical conditions, H2O2 decomposes into oxygen gas, which forms a homogeneous phase with supercritical water to provide an excellent oxidizing atmosphere.10,18,22 In addition to LiMn2O4, we also successfully synthesized LiCoO2 and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), both of which are also used as cathode materials in Li-ion batteries.

Defect-free single-phase LiCoO2 particles (<500 nm) can be produced by SCWS with excess of LiOH at a short residence time, as shown in Fig. 4. However, under subcritical conditions (623 K or below, 30 MPa), LiCoO2 was prepared with byproducts such as CoO or Co3O4. It is important to avoid subcritical conditions to obtain LiCoO2 without byproducts such as these. At supercritical temperatures, a highly crystalline high-temperature form of LiCoO2 particles (HT-LiCoO2) was produced. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that a well-developed HT-LiCoO2 phase, which is demonstrated by the high intensity of the (003) peak and clear splitting between the (006)/(012) and (108)/(110) peaks, was obtained without post-calcination, as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, the process of SCWS for preparing HT-LiCoO2 eliminates the energy-intensive calcination step and makes the manufacturing process much simpler and greener.22,37

Several researchers reported the supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of LiFePO4 nanoparticles by reacting iron sulfate, phosphoric acid, and lithium hydroxide in a flow system.38–40 Nanosize LiFePO4 particles, 200–800 nm in size, were synthesized using fast, continuous, supercritical hydrothermal synthesis at a reaction time of 40 s. The particles were much smaller than those produced by the conventional solid-state method (3–15 μm). The discharge capacity of the synthesized LiFePO4 particles was 70–80 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C after 30 cycles depending on the synthesis conditions. These values were higher than that of the solid-state-synthesized LiFePO4 (60 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C after 30 cycles), because of the smaller particle size and higher crystallinity.40

Fig. 5 shows CeO2 nanoparticles produced from Ce(OH)4. CeO2 has been widely used in catalysis, electrochemistry, and optics. For example, ceria nanocrystals have a high oxygen storage capacity and act as an important component in three-way catalytic converters for cleaning automotive exhaust. We have produced CeO2 nanoparticles by using supercritical hydrothermal methods. CeO2 nanoparticles produced with octanoic acid had a cubic shape having (100) planes and exhibited higher catalytic activity toward the deNOx reaction.29

As mentioned above, supercritical hydrothermal synthesis contributes to a greener sustainable society, not only because it does not require the use of organic solvents but also because the produced metal oxides play important roles in energy generation and exhaust gas purification (Table 3).

2.3 Organic-modified metal oxide nanoparticles produced by supercritical hydrothermal methods
Although supercritical hydrothermal synthesis yields highly crystalline nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution, the produced nanoparticles may have poor dispersibility in water and some organic solvents or aggregate in polymer matrices (Fig. 6). This is because metal oxide nanoparticles have low affinity toward organic molecules. To broaden the application of metal oxides in various fields, we need to realize the dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles in various media. We have developed a method of producing organic-molecule-modified metal oxide nanoparticles, which have higher affinity toward organic materials owing to the presence of organic molecules on their surfaces. These nanoparticles were produced by supercritical hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of organic molecules. Because of the low dielectric constant of supercritical water, organic reagents can form homogeneous solutions in water to react with the surface of metal oxide nanoparticles. For example, carboxylic acid and amines are found to react with the surface of metal oxide nanoparticles. The resulting hybrid nanoparticles exhibited good dispersibility toward organic solvents. The rest of this section covers the supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of hybrid organic–inorganic nanoparticles and hybrid materials in which metal oxide nanoparticles are dispersed in polymer matrices.

2.4 Hybrid nanomaterials
Hybrid materials consisting of polymer–inorganic nanoparticles are considered to be promising new materials that combine the advantages of polymers and inorganics (e.g., light weight and high mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity and electro-resistance, the ability to form transparent flexible electro-conducting films). We proposed a new method for synthesizing organic surface-modified nanoparticles by introducing organic reagents during hydrothermal synthesis. The surface-modified nanoparticles synthesized by this method can be easily recovered by extraction from the water suspension phase with an organic solvent and are easily dispersed in organic solvents, which leads to energy saving (thus greener) in separation and purification of nanoparticles. Transparent solutions were obtained for the products, as shown in Fig. 7. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis confirmed that particles were not aggregated but were suspended as individual particles. Several other studies discussed the synthesis of hybrid organic–inorganic nanoparticles, such as TiO2, ZnO, and CoAl2O4, under supercritical conditions.20,30,41 Transparent solutions are typically obtained for well-crystallized and very small hybrid nanoparticles when they are dispersed. The DLS studies also confirmed that these particles are not aggregated but are suspended as individual nanoparticles.

3. Material recycling with supercritical water
3.1 Chemical recycling from waste plastics


Condensation polymerization plastics. 
Chemical recycling is the most desirable process for recycling plastics because it converts plastics to their monomers, which can then be re-used. Subcritical and supercritical fluids such as water and alcohol are excellent reaction media for depolymerization or decomposition of plastics. In such fluids, polymer decomposition proceeds rapidly and selectively. A number of researchers have developed recycling technologies from fundamental research to practical applications.42
Condensation polymers with ether, ester, or acid amide linkages can be depolymerized by hydrolysis. When hydrolysis proceeds selectively, a polymer can be depolymerized into its monomers. Condensation polymers are easily decomposed to their monomers by hydrolysis in near-critical water, as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Monomerization of polymers by hydrolysis. 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a typical and widely used condensation polymer. PET was depolymerized to its monomers, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol, in subcritical and supercritical water.43 The yield of TPA was close to 100% at 673 K, 40 MPa, and a reaction time of 30 min. The yield of ethylene glycol was lower because of further decomposition catalyzed by the obtained TPA. The secondary products observed were benzoic acid, diethylene glycol, 1,4-dioxane, acetaldehyde, and crotonic acid.44 Supercritical methanol was also used to depolymerize PET; both monomers, dimethylterephthalate and ethylene glycol, were efficiently recovered.45,46 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Japan, has developed a chemical recycling process using supercritical methanol for depolymerizing post-consumer PET bottles in a pilot plant.47

Nylon 6, which is a polymer synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactam, has been depolymerized by hydrolysis in subcritical and supercritical water.48ε-Caprolactam and ε-aminocaproic acid were detected in the product's liquid phase. The total yield of these monomers was about 100% for reactions at 573 K in 60 min and at 603 K in 30 min. The yield of ε-aminocaproic acid rapidly decreased as the reaction time increased. Thus, nylon 6 was decomposed by hydrolysis to ε-aminocaproic acid followed by cyclodehydration to ε-caprolactam or further decomposition to smaller molecules. This indicates that the cyclodehydration reaction proceeds in water near the critical temperature.

            Polycarbonates, one of which is synthesized from bisphenol A and phosgene, are widely used as commodity plastics and engineering plastics, because of features such as temperature resistance, impact resistance, and desirable optical properties. Several depolymerization processes using alkali catalysts have been reported to produce bisphenol A. Ikeda et al.49 studied the decomposition of polycarbonate in water at 403–573 K. The main products were phenol, bisphenol A, and p-isopropenylphenol. The reaction was accelerated by the addition of Na2CO3, and the yield of identified products reached 68% in a reaction at 523 K for 1 h.
Polyurethanes are produced by the reaction of a polyisocyanate with a polyalcohol (polyol) in the presence of a catalyst and other additives. By hydrolysis of polyurethane in water, it is possible to obtain the polyol and diamine corresponding to the starting isocyanate. Nagase et al.50 found that the optimum temperature and pressure were 523–573 K and 10–20 MPa, respectively. The decomposition of polyurethane was almost 100% at temperatures above 543 K. Both polyol and diamine were recovered almost completely. When the temperature was higher than 603 K, the amounts recovered decreased. Dai et al.51 decomposed polyurethane foam in subcritical water at 423–623 K into tolylenediamine (TDA) and polyol. The highest yield of TDA was almost 90%.


Addition polymerization plastics. 
The recycling of thermosetting resins, which are widely used for electronics, is important. Phenol resin is a thermosetting resins that has a high thermal stability because aromatic units are connected by methylene bonds. Prepolymers of phenol resin were decomposed into their monomers by reactions at 523–703 K under an Ar atmosphere in subcritical and supercritical water.52 The total yield of identified products depended on the type of prepolymer; the maximum yield reached 78% in a reaction at 703 K for 0.5 h. The decomposition was accelerated by the addition of Na2CO3, and the yields of identified monomers were more than 90%.

Decomposition in subcritical and supercritical water was applied to printed circuit boards.53 For decomposition in supercritical water, about 80% of the resin was transformed into the liquid or gas phase. Phenol, o-cresol, and p-cresol were found to be the main components in the liquid phase.
Onwudili and Williams54 decomposed flame-retardant plastics (Br-ABS and Br-HIPS) in supercritical water in the absence and presence of the alkaline additives NaOH and Ca(OH)2. The main reaction products were oils containing ethylbenzene. Up to 99 wt% of the bromine atoms in the plastics was removed into the aqueous phase, and all of the antimony appeared in the solid residues.
Polyethylene is a commodity thermoplastic extensively used in consumer products; it is produced at a rate of more than 60 million tons a year. The distribution of reaction products for pyrolysis in supercritical water can be controlled. Watanabe et al.55 observed that pyrolysis in supercritical water differed from that in argon. Higher yields of shorter chain hydrocarbons, a higher 1-alkene/n-alkane ratio, and higher conversion rates were obtained in supercritical water. Moriya and Enomoto56 compared polyethylene cracking in supercritical water with water-free thermal cracking. A yellow–brown grease was producted from supercritical water cracking (698 K, 120 min). The oil and gas conversions were 90.2 wt% and 6.5 wt%, respectively. The yield of oil products for supercritical water was higher and for coke production was smaller than those in thermal cracking.

3.2 Materials recovery from waste
Fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs) have been widely used as a high-strength material in recent years. FRP containing glass fiber (GFRP) is a composite material manufactured by laminating unsaturated polyester resin with glass fiber and filler. FRP containing carbon fiber (CFRP) usually consists of carbon fiber and epoxy resin.
Sugeta et al.57 and Okajima et al.58 studied the decomposition of FRP in subcritical and supercritical water. FRP was almost completely decomposed at 653 K in 5 min. Pinero-Hernanz et al.59 used supercritical water to decompose epoxy resin containing carbon fiber. The efficiency of resin removal reached 79.3 wt% at 673 K and 28 MPa, with further improvement through the use of potassium hydroxide as an alkali catalyst (up to 95.3 wt%). The tensile strength of the reclaimed fibers was 90–98% of that of the virgin fibers.
Panasonic Electric Works, Ltd., Japan, has been developing FRP recycling technology since 2002 using hydrolysis in subcritical water.60 Thermosetting resin in FRP can be recycled into basic materials with a material recycling rate of 70%. After subcritical water hydrolysis of FRP, the resin was dissolved into a reaction liquid. The unsaturated polyester components recovered, such as glycols and fumaric acid, were separated from the aqueous reaction liquid and polymerized into polyester with new raw resin materials to produce recycled resin. Styrene–fumaric acid copolymer obtained in the aqueous phase was also separated and has the potential to be a low-profile additive for FRP formation. The recovered inorganic materials are used as inorganic filler to produce FRP. A pilot plant with a reactor capacity of 2.9 m3 is now under operation in Tochigi, Japan.
3.3 Materials recovery by supercritical oxidation
A new green SCWO process was proposed for in situhydrothermal synthesis of nanoparticles of metals and/or metal oxides by blending two wastewaters: one containing only metal ions and the other containing only organic compounds. This novel process provides sufficient energy from the exothermic reaction of the organic wastewater to perform hydrothermal synthesis of the metal and/or metal oxide from the inorganic wastewater, which contains few organic compounds. Hydrothermal synthesis of nanoparticles of metal or metal oxide can be combined with SCWO of organic compounds in wastewater, where nanoparticles formed in situ in the reactor can act as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of organic compounds. As a result, the oxidation rate of organic compounds is enhanced by the nanosized heterogeneous catalysts. SCWO provides a synergetic effect for simultaneous treatment of acrylonitrile and copper plating wastewater. During the reaction, the oxidation rate of acrylonitrile wastewater was enhanced by the in situ formation of nanocatalysts of copper and/or copper oxides, and the exothermic decomposition of the acrylonitrile wastewater supplied sufficient heat for the recovery of solid copper and copper oxides from the copper plating wastewater. The synergetic effect of wastewater treatment by the newly proposed SCWO process leads to full total organic carbon (TOC) conversion, color removal, detoxification, and odor elimination, as well as full recovery of copper (Fig. 9). For example, the maximum synergetic effect was found at 618 K with a residence time of 2 s, where the TOC conversion of the acrylonitrile wastewater increased from 17.6% to 67.3%. XRD analysis of the solid particles showed that Cu, Cu2O, and CuO particles with average diameters of 150 nm were generated in situ from the mixed wastewater during SCWO. In particular, copper recovery of more than 99.8% at 873 K showed that the SCWO process can be an effective technique for removing copper from copper plating wastewater.61 Another example regarding material recovery is the SCWO process treated for wastewater from LCD manufacturing process. During the oxidation in supercriticalwater, more than 97% chromium in the wastewater can be recovered as chromium oxide (α-HCrO2 and Cr2O3) particles with the particles size range 200–400 nm.62

4. Commercialization of green materials
4.1 Supercritical hydrothermal synthesis
A Korean company, Hanwha Chemical, has developed a continuous process in a pilot plant for supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of CeO2, CexZr1−xO2, LiCoO2, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, and so on. The pilot plant, with a capacity of 4 kg of dry powder per h, was operated to collect scale-up information and basic design data for a full-scale commercial plant. For CeO2, ceria particles in a wide size range (15–45 nm) can be produced by manipulating such operating variables as residence time, pressure, and temperature. Shallow trench isolation (STI) chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) tests showed that performance metrics such as pattern selectivity and oxide removal rate decreased linearly with CeO2 particle size. Two methods of preparing a ternary oxygen storage capacity (OSC) material were tested. In one method, a zirconia coating is made on ceria; the precursor solution was prepared so that ceria fine particles were dispersed in water and mixed with a zirconium nitrate solution. The precursor solution was continuously delivered into supercritical water to prepare ceria particles coated with zirconia. It produced a ternary OSC material at a rate of 1.5 kg h−1 at 25 MPa and 673 K in supercritical water. In the second method, ceria cores having diameters of 50–200 nm were coated with 2–10-nm-thick zirconia. Traditionally, alumina that provides thermal stability is coated together with the OSC material on a monolith by a wash coating process. However, in the pilot plant operation of SCWS, the precursor solution, which consisted of aluminum nitrate, cerium nitrate, zirconium nitrate, rhodium nitrate, or lanthanum nitrate, was instantly introduced into supercritical water containing ammonia. The reaction was performed at 25 MPa and 673 K within 30 s to produce high-performance ternary OSC materials. In the reactor, nitric acid generated during the hydrolysis of metal nitrate reacted with ammonia to yield nitrogen gas. This reaction occurs only above the critical point, making the process cleaner. A sample with a molar ratio of alumina to ternary OSC material of 4:1 shows higher thermal stability, because it maintained its specific surface area of more than 60 m2 g−1 after heat treatment at 1273 K and more than 50 m2 g−1 after heat treatment at 1373 K. An engine test showed similar performance in the conversion of CO, hydrocarbon, and NOx, and a chassis test showed more than 20% lower emissions of hydrocarbon and NOx.63
Among the metal oxides, LiFePO4 has received considerable attention as a promising positive electrode material. Hanwha Chemical constructed the first commercial plant for the supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of LiFePO4 at the end of 2010. This commercial plant (Fig. 10) continuously produces LiFePO4 and has a capacity of 1000 tons per year.64

Fig. 11 shows the XRD pattern of the highly crystalline LiFePO4 produced by supercritical hydrothermal synthesis without a carbon coating. Because most of the Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+ by the addition of a reducing agent, no evident impurities such as Fe2O3, LiFeO2, or Fe2P were detected.

To overcome its poor electrical conductivity, the particle size and morphology of LiFePO4 powder are precisely controlled during synthesis, as shown in Fig. 12.

These scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations are consistent with the particle size distribution measured by a laser diffraction and scattering method (Fig. 13). The average particle size, represented by the value at 50% cumulative population (d50%), is 349 nm.

A coin-type cell for electrochemical tests used a cathode composed of 90 wt% active material, 5 wt% conductive carbon black, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent for the mixture, which was then applied to an aluminum foil. A lithium metal and Celgard 3501 microporous polypropylene membrane were used as the anode and separator, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate : diethyl carbonate (EC : DEC = 1:1, v/v). The charge/discharge curves were galvanostatically obtained between 2.0 and 4.4 V (versusLi/Li+) at 298 K. Fig. 14 shows that LiFePO4 produced by supercritical hydrothermal synthesis has a capacity of 162.7 mA h g−1, very close to the theoretical capacity. Interestingly, the voltage difference between the flat charge and discharge plateaus in Fig. 14 is much smaller than that of a LiFePO4 electrode prepared by the solid-state reaction method, which means that the LiFePO4 produced by Hanwha Chemical has excellent electrical conductivity. This LiFePO4 is an anion-deficient non-stoichiometric compound with a unique crystal structure patented by Hanwha Chemical. Owing to anion vacancies, the non-stoichiometric LiFePO4 achieves a better diffusion coefficient of lithium ions than that achieved with stoichiometric LiFePO4.

As a pathfinder in supercritical fluid technology, Hanwha Chemical has achieved the first mass production in the world of highly crystalline LiFePO4 using continuous supercritical hydrothermal synthesis. Furthermore, this company is preparing a master plan for plant expansion and the development of next-generation cathode materials.
4.2 Chemical recycling process
Kobe Steel developed a chemical recycling process at Mitsui-Takeda Chemicals in 1997 by applying noncatalytic hydrolysis in subcritical water.65Tolylenediisocyanate (TDI) distillation residue, which is typically incinerated, was successfully converted to TDA. The commercial plant has been operating since 1998 with a capacity of 10 tons/day (Fig. 15(a)). The process consists of a reaction process in subcritical water and a purification process. The recovered TDA was of high quality and more than 99.5% pure. An expansion of the plant was completed in 2003.
 Fig. 15  
            TDI residue recycling plant in (a) Japan and (b) Korea. 
In Korea, Hanhwa Chemical also commercialized a solid TDI residue recycling process and constructed a plant at Korea Fine Chemical in 2007 with capacity of 20 tons per day (Fig. 15(b)). Dark brown solid TDI residue is the bottom product of secondary distillation of crude TDI, composed mainly of TDI oligomers with an average molecular weight of 833 g mol−1.66 To develop this process, optimized conditions for the hydrolysis of solid TDI residue in near-critical water from laboratory experiments were applied and verified by pilot plant tests. This near-critical water process does not employ any catalysts such as NaOH, so the separation process is simpler, and less wastewater is generated.
Hanhwa Chemical constructed a near-critical hydrolysis (NCH) plant (Fig. 16) at Namhae Chemical Corp., Yeocheon, Korea, to treat wastewater from the melamine manufacturing process containing total nitrogen of ∼12500 ppm. The capacity of the plant is 35 tons of wastewater per hour. When an NCH process was implemented, it was found that a greener process could be obtained. The waste treatment cost is low, and the treated water is totally recycled into the melamine manufacturing process to conserve demineralized water. Also, since the ammonia and CO2 produced in the wastewater treatment process can be recycled, raw feed materials can be conserved. Furthermore, because this technique increases productivity, the column operability can be increased.
 Fig. 16  Commercial recycling plant for melamine plant wastewater by the NCH process at Namhae Chemical Co. in Korea. 
Hanhwa Chemical, Samnam Petrochemical, and Seoul National University investigated homogeneous catalyst recycling in the waste slurry from TPA manufacturing. The wastewater from TPA manufacturing contains many organic acids such as 4-carboxybenzyl aldehyde, terephthalic acid, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, p-tolualdehyde, and p-toluic acid, and inorganic compounds such as cobalt and manganese acetate. During the SCWO of organic acids in the wastewater, nanoparticles of cobalt manganese oxide, synthesized in situ in the reactor, act as an oxidation catalyst to enhance the oxidation rate of organic compounds, so either the reaction temperature can be reduced or the residence time can be shortened. The TOC of the wastewater was 37480 ppm and decreased to 200 ppm after the reaction. More than 99% of the Co–Mn catalyst in the TPA wastewater was recovered as cobalt manganese oxide; the size of the Co–Mn oxide particles was ∼260 nm (Fig. 17). A commercial plant for continuous treatment of TPA waste slurry was constructed at Samnam Petrochemical, Yeocheon, Korea; it can treat up to 6.5 tons of wastewater per hour using a tubular reactor (Fig. 18). More than 99% of the inorganic compounds were recycled as a regenerated homogeneous catalyst. Another green aspect of this process is that it can operate without a heat supply because oxidation of the organic compounds generates sufficient heat to continually initiate the oxidation reaction, and any extra energy is used to produce high-pressure steam.67,68

Conclusions
In this review, we summarize the green aspects of supercritical hydrothermal processes. As we shown, supercritical hydrothermal processes contribute to greener society through the use of water instead of organic solvent to produce various functional materials that are used to minimize the emission of CO2. In addition, because the processes are quite fast, the supercritical hydrothermal processes can treat much larger amount of reactants and products as compared with conventional processes. Therefore, we believe that the commercialization of such processess greatly contributes to the greener society.
