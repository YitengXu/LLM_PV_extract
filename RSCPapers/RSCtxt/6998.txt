    , Accepted 11th January 2012First published on 13th January 2012AbstractPerformance of Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cells is enhanced by embedding Au nanoparticles in the poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) hole-conducting polymer layer. The improved charge transfer/transport at the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface by extended interface area of the P3HT/Au counter electrode and the re-absorption of the backscattering light from the embedded Au nanoparticles enhanced the device performance: Jsc 11.0 to 12.8 mA cm−2, Voc 606 to 626 mV, fill factor (FF) 60.5 to 61.2%, and power conversion efficiency (η) 4.0 to 4.9%. Simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc, and FF in Au nanoparticle-embedded systems is mainly attributed to the improved charge collection efficiency and light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3 due to the improved charge transfer/transport in the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface.
Sensitized solar cells (SSCs)1 are distinguishable from conventional p–n heterojunction solar cells as they are composed of three layers, the mesoporous electron conductor, the light absorbing sensitizer, and the hole conductor. Each layer can be optimized to achieve overall high device performances in the SSCs, and much research has been conducted to develop efficient SSCs since Grätzel and O' Regan reported ∼11% efficiencies in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1a
To date, inorganic semiconductors and quantum dots (QDs) have been promising alternative sensitizers owing to their unique properties such as high absorption coefficients, convenient bandgap tailoring, large dipole moments, multiple exciton generation, and high stabilities.2 Among the many candidates for metal chalcogenide-sensitizers,3Sb2S3 is attractive because of its high absorption coefficient (α = 105 cm−1) and suitable energy bandgap (1.7–1.9 eV).4 All solid-state Sb2S3–SSCs comprising mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/Sb2S3/CuSCN have attained high device efficiencies of 3.7%.5 Recently, we also reported that the Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cell comprising mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) as the electron conductor/sensitizer/hole-conducting layers attained high power conversion efficiencies through device optimization and interface treatments.6 The high efficiency seems to be mainly derived from the high fill factor. However, the Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cell has a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the wavelength region from 450 nm to 650 nm compared to other Sb2S3-SSCs such as mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/CuSCN,5mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-MeOTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene],7 and mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/cobalt electrolyte8 because of the inefficient charge transport between the P3HT and mp-TiO2 (or Sb2S3) layers.8 Therefore it is essential to find ways to increase the EQE in the P3HT layer to improve the device efficiency of Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cells. Herein, we propose a way to reduce the absorption loss in the P3HT hole conducting layer by embedding Au nanoparticles in the P3HT layer.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the fabricated Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cell and its energy band diagram. The device consists of FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide)/bl-TiO2 (blocking-TiO2)/mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT with Au nanoparticles/Au corresponding to the transparent conducting oxide/blocking layer/electron conductor/sensitizer/hole conductor/counter electrode layer, respectively. Upon external light illumination, the Sb2S3-sensitizer absorbs light and generates electron–hole (e–h) pairs. The electrons and holes in the e–h pairs separate at interfaces of Sb2S3 and TiO2, and then the electrons are transported into the mp-TiO2 layer and the holes are transported into the P3HT layer, simultaneously. At the same time, the P3HT hole conducting layer also absorbs light and creates e–h pairs. This dual behaviour, namely, that the P3HT layer acts as both a p-type hole conductor and light absorber, implies that the generated e–h pairs in P3HT are either destined to generate charge carriers (i.e. electrons and holes) which are then transported in opposite directions, or e–h pair recombination occurs. We have found that the generated charge carriers in P3HT in this device structure are not effectively transported to either Sb2S3 or TiO2 as in our previous photoluminescence (PL) study.8 In addition, the optimal exciton diffusion length in a P3HT/TiO2 (electron donor/acceptor) film is <10 nm, and the created charge carriers in the thick P3HT layer undergo exciton–exciton annihilation.9 Thus, we added Au nanoparticles in the P3HT layer to enhance its hole conducting properties. As depicted in the magnified image of Fig. 1(a), the embedded Au nanoparticles in P3HT (i) shorten the hole distance to the Au counter electrode, (ii) extend the interface area between P3HT and Au electrodes, and (iii) allow the Sb2S3 to re-absorb the backscattered light generated from the Au nanoparticle surface plasmon scattering. The Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cells with mp-TiO2 layer thicknesses of ca. 1 μm do not fully absorb light in the 450 nm to 750 nm-wavelength region (see Fig. 2(b)). The light above 450 nm-wavelength passes through the solar cell unless it is absorbed by the backscattering from the hole conducting layer8 or metal reflector. Of course, it is possible to absorb such light by either increasing the thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer or inserting a backscattering layer in liquid-type-SSCs.8 However, in solid-type-SSCs, the thickness of mp-TiO2 is restricted by the pore-filling problem because it is difficult for hole-transporting materials to perfectly infiltrate into the mesopores of the mp-TiO2 layer. In our previous report, the Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cell revealed the optimal device performance in ca. 1 μm-thick mp-TiO2 films.6 Therefore, we fixed the thickness of the mp-TiO2 film to ca. 1 μm. Accordingly, light above 450 nm-wavelength, which is not absorbed by Sb2S3, is reflected by the Au counter electrode as will be discussed later and re-absorbed by the P3HT layer.

With the addition of the Au nanoparticles in the P3HT layer, the re-absorbed light in the P3HT layer undergoes surface plasmon scattering.10 Therefore, the effective path length of the light is shortened by the increase in the backscattering caused by Au nanoparticles. As a result, it is expected that the EQE loss above 450 nm-wavelength will be reduced, and consequently, the power conversion efficiency will be enhanced. The TEM image shown in Fig. 2(a) indicates that the Au nanoparticles vary in size from 10 to 70 nm. These polydispersed Au nanoparticles scatter a broad range of light because the surface plasmon scattering effect strongly depends on the Au nanoparticle size.10 From the UV-Vis transmission spectra, shown in Fig. 2(b), the P3HT layer absorbs light up to 650 nm-wavelength and the Sb2S3 and Au nanoparticles absorb light above 650 nm-wavelength.
The EQE spectra of the devices with different concentrations of embedded Au nanoparticles in the P3HT layer are shown in Fig. 3(a). The EQE spectra of device Au1 with Au:P3HT = 1:15 wt:wt show higher EQE values in the region of 450–650 nm-wavelength compared to the device with no Au nanoparticles (Au0). This implies that the charge carriers generated in Sb2S3 are efficiently delivered to the Au electrode through the P3HT intermediate layer owing to the improved charge collection efficiency from the shortened hole pathway to the Au counter electrode and the extended interface area between the P3HT and the Au electrode. The EQE increase implies that the light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3 is also improved by the re-absorption of the backscattered light by the embedded Au nanoparticles. We surmise that the increase in EQE at the absorption wavelengths of P3HT results from either the improved charge collection efficiency in the P3HT layer or the improved light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3. The improvement of EQE in the region above 650 nm-wavelength might be derived from the improved light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3 because there are no absorption losses at this wavelength in P3HT. The degradation of EQE at high concentrations of Au nanoparticles embedded in P3HT (Au2) might be attributed to the increased exciton recombination because the excess Au nanoparticles could be in direct contact with mp-TiO2 or Sb2S3, thus decreasing the interfacial contact between Sb2S3 and P3HT. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices, shown in Fig. 3(b), are consistent with the EQE spectra in Fig. 3(a).
 Fig. 3  (a) EQE, (b) J–V, and (c) diffuse reflectance. Au0 (Au:P3HT = 0:15, wt:wt), Au1 (1:15), and Au2 (2:15). 
The device performance characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The Au1 device performance was improved as compared to that of the Au0 device: Jsc = 11.0 → 12.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 606 → 626 mV, fill factor (FF) = 60.5 → 61.2%, and power conversion efficiency (η) = 4.0 → 4.9%. Simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc, and FF in Au nanoparticles embedded systems was mainly attributed to the increase in the improved charge collection efficiency and light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3 due to the improved charge transfer/transport in the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface, as will be discussed later. The improved Jsc for a similar fill factor led to a decrease in the series resistance while the shunt resistance remained similar, as listed in Table 1. From the results of the J–V curves and the EQE spectra, we conclude that the Au nanoparticles embedded in the P3HT layer improve the charge collection efficiency by shortening the hole transporting pathway and extending the interface area between the P3HT and the Au electrode, and increasing the light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3 by the re-absorption of backscattered light from the Au nanoparticles. To confirm the absorption of real devices (Au counter electrode coated devices), we compared the diffuse reflectance of each solar cell as shown in Fig. 3(c). Unlike the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT (Au counter electrode uncoated device) in Fig. 2(b), the mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Au electrode device fully absorbs light up to 650 nm due to the Au counter reflecting electrode. This indicates that the unabsorbed light below 650 nm-wavelength could be fully re-absorbed by either Sb2S3 or P3HT once it has been reflected from the Au electrode. On the other hand, the light above 650 nm-wavelength is absorbed slightly better by devices containing embedded Au nanoparticles. This suggests that light above 650 nm-wavelength, which is backscattered from the Au nanoparticles, is re-absorbed by Sb2S3 because P3HT does not absorb in this region. However it is still not clear which factor is more dominant to improve the device efficiency in either improved charge collection or improved light harvesting.

To further confirm the role of Au nanoparticles embedded in P3HT, we compared the impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements of each device under dark and 1 sun illumination by applying a bias voltage of 550 mV, as shown in Fig. 4. In the Nyquist plot, a number of key features can be distinguished, such as charge transfer/transport at the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface and charge recombination at the TiO2/P3HT interface.8,11 The first arc, in the high-frequency region (∼105 Hz), can be attributed to the charge-transfer/transport resistance and capacitance at the P3HT/Au electrode or Sb2S3/P3HT interfaces. The second arc, in the low-frequency region (103–104 Hz), is associated with recombination resistance of the mp-TiO2/P3HT interface and the overall capacitance.8,11 The Nyquist plots under dark in Fig. 4(a) indicate that the Au embedded devices (Au1 and Au2) have smaller charge transfer/transport resistance than the pristine device (Au0) while the recombination resistances of all devices remain unchanged. If we assume that the charge transfer resistance and capacitance at the P3HT/Au electrode are negligible, the improved device efficiency will mainly be attributed to the improved charge collection due to the shortened hole transporting pathway and the extended interface between P3HT and Au electrodes. Eventually, the order of charge transfer/transport resistance at the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface will be RAu0 > RAu2 > RAu1, which is consistent with the order of Jsc and Rs in Table 1. The Nyquist plots under 1 sun illumination in Fig. 4(b) show the same tendency with the devices under dark conditions and confirm that the improved charge collection is the dominant factor to enhance the device efficiency.
 Fig. 4  
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) analysis. Nyquist (a) in dark, (b) in 1 sun illumination and Bode phase plots (c) in dark, (d) in 1 sun illumination under 550 mV of applied bias voltage. 
The Bode phase plots under dark and 1 sun illumination in Fig. 4(c) and (d) show that the shoulders in the low-frequency region occur at approximately the same frequency. This indicates that the recombination rates for devices Au0, Au1, and Au2 at the mp-TiO2/P3HT interface are constant although the Au embedded devices (Au1 and Au2) absorb more light than the Au0 device. The different shoulder frequencies in the high-frequency region seem to be attributed to the different charge transfer/transport resistance at the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface. In current status, there is no exact impedance model for this type of solar cells so that it seems to be difficult to exactly analyze the measured impedance spectroscopy although one impedance model for a solid state inorganic semiconductor-sensitized solar cell using CuSCN as a hole conductor has been reported.11e Therefore, we think further works have to be done to fully characterize and understand the impedance model for our devices. However, from the UV-Visible spectra, J–V curves, and EQE spectra, we can reasonably surmise without IS analysis that the embedded Au nanoparticles in P3HT are responsible for the improvement of the light harvesting and the charge transfer/transport at the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface.
In summary, the embedded Au nanoparticles in P3HT improved the charge collection efficiency by reducing the hole transporting pathway, extending the P3HT/Au electrode interface area, and increasing the light harvesting efficiency of Sb2S3. The Au nanoparticles in the P3HT layer enhanced the device efficiency by ∼22.5% at 1 sun illumination compared to the reference device as the model system. We have shown that this simple design scheme of introducing Au nanoparticles in the hole-conducting polymer layer enables unabsorbed light in solar cells to be utilized by the Au surface plasmon scattering effects and improves the charge transfer/transport at the Sb2S3/P3HT/Au interface which mainly contributes to enhanced device efficiencies.
Methods
Synthesis of Au nanoparticles
6 mL of ethylene glycol (EG: Junsei) in a 25 mL vial was heated to 160 °C for 1 h in an oil bath with magnetic stirring. 2 mL of 147 mM polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 55000, Aldrich) EG solution was then added to the pre-heated EG solution. 2 mL of 12 mM HAuCl4 (Aldrich) EG solution was added to the solution drop-wise over 200 s, and the reaction proceeded for 30 min, after which it was cooled to room temperature. The produced Au nanoparticles were collected by repeated centrifugation and washing in ethanol (5 times) and then dried at 60 °C in an oven for 1 d. To exchange the PVP capping molecules with P3HT (Rieke Metals, >98% regioregular), the Au nanoparticles were dispersed in 0.1 wt% P3HT in 1,2 dichlorobenzene (Aldrich) solution by sonication for 5 min. The Au nanoparticles are centrifuged and dried at 60 °C in an oven for 1 h. Then, the Au nanoparticles were re-dispersed in P3HT:1,2 dichlorobenzene (15 mg:1 mL) solution. Solutions with different Au concentrations were prepared: Au0 (Au:P3HT = 0:15 wt:wt), Au1 (1:15), and Au2 (2:15).
Preparation of the mp-TiO2 film
The TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing TiO2 nanopowder, synthesized through hydrothermal treatment of an aqueous peroxotitanium complex (PTC) solution in an autoclave at a temperature of 250 °C for 12 h, ethyl cellulose, and terpineol, as reported previously.6 The ca. 50 nm-thick bl-TiO2 layer on cleaned FTO (Pilkington, TEC15) was deposited by spray pyrolysis using 0.02 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetone) solution at 450 °C. The TiO2 paste was then screen-printed on the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate. The coated TiO2 film was then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h in air. The junction of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles was modified by dipping in a 20 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 12 h and sintering at 500 °C for 30 min.
Deposition of the Sb2S3 sensitizer on the mp-TiO2 film

          Sb2S3 sensitizer was deposited on the mp-TiO2 surface using chemical bath deposition (CBD).4 After dipping the mp-TiO2 film in the bath for 2.5 h, an amorphous orange Sb2S3 thin film formed. The deposited film was then heat-treated at 300 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 20 min.6
Fabrication of Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cells

          Au0, Au1, and Au2 solutions were spin-coated on the Sb2S3/mp-TiO2 film at 2500 rpm for 60 s and dried at 90 °C in a vacuum oven for 40 min. The Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Torr. The active device area was 16 mm2.
Device characterization
The I–V characteristics of the solar cell were measured by a sourcemeter (Keithley 2420) and a calibrated Si-reference cell (certified by NREL) under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) AM 1.5G illumination provided by a solar simulator (Class A, 91195A; Newport). The EQEs were measured using a fully computerized system comprising a light source (300W Xenon lamp, 66902; Newport) aligned with a monochromator (CornerstoneTM 260; Newport) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001). All measurements were carried out at least five times using a 9.6 mm2 metal mask, and the results were averaged. The EIS of the solar cells having a metal mask was measured in an open circuit condition under 1 sun illumination by using an impedance analyzer (Zahner IM6e).
