    , Accepted 11th September 2011First published on 10th October 2011AbstractA novel chemically stable Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure has been synthesized for the first time using a hydrothermal method. The Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure comprises a Zn poor-Zn2SnO4 plate and Zn-doped SnO2 nanothorns growing on the plate, both of which have high electron mobilities. The nanocactus is used as the photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus film reaches 2.21%, which is twice the previous reported efficiency of pure SnO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements show that the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus film has a good effective diffusion length and high intrinsic electron mobility. After TiCl4 treatment of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus film, the current density increases nearly three times and the PCE increases to 6.62%, which compares favourably with the P25 DSSCs (6.97%) and is much higher than that of the SnO2 (1.04%) or Zn2SnO4 (3.7%)-based DSSCs.
1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells have attracted extensive interest as promising candidates for the future generation of cost-effective photovoltaic solar cells.1–6 Nanocrystalline TiO2, ZnO and SnO2 with various morphologies have been have been synthesized for use as photoanode materials for developing high performance DSSCs and also for other applications.3,5,7–19TiO2 is the dominant photoanode material and the resulting DSSC exhibits the highest PCE of ∼11%.20,21ZnO has also been explored due to its similar bandgap (3.2 eV) and energy levels as TiO2, while possessing a much higher electron mobility of (>200 cm2 V−1s−1).9 However, ZnO-based DSSCs suffer from the instability of ZnO in acidic electrolytes and the slow electron-injection kinetics from the dye to ZnO.9 Another alternative, SnO2 (Eg = 3.6 eV) is chemically stable and has a much higher electron mobility (∼100–200 cm2 V−1s−1) than nanocrystalline TiO2 (∼10−2 cm2 V−1s−1).22 However, when combined with the iodide/triiodide redox couple (I−/I3−), the open circuit voltage (Voc) is fairly low in a SnO2-based DSSC, at best about 0.52 V, and the efficiency is 1.04%.23 A significant improvement in Voc (0.55 to 0.7 V) and efficiency (5.2%) can be achieved by covering the mesoporous SnO2 with a very thin shell of other metal oxides such as ZnO.24 Nevertheless, the chemically unstable component (ZnO) in the composites is a challenging issue that needs to be resolved. The chemically stable ternary oxide Zn-doped SnO2 might be a good choice that incorporates both the advantages of SnO2 and ZnO.25 Ternary compound nanostructures are also highly promising for the future development of DSSCs. Zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) is a chemically stable transparent conductive oxide (TCO) material with a band gap of 3.6 eV and electron mobility of 10–15 cm2 V−1s−1.26,27 However, the synthesis of these compounds is still challenging.28,29 A DSSC efficiency of up to 3.7% and a Voc of 0.63 V were obtained for this material.27 Photoelectrochemical characterization suggests that it has a similar conduction band edge energy as TiO2.26,30 Furthermore, it is now well-accepted that a high-efficiency photoelectrode for DSSCs requires not only a high surface area for light harvesting but also a densely packed microstructure for fast electron transport.5,31–34 Thus, the most urgent challenge now is how to comprise the advantages of the present photoanode materials to construct a compound structure that is chemically stable and possesses a high Voc, high electron mobility and high photocurrent when used as the photoanode of a DSSC.
In the work reported herein, a novel chemically stable Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure was synthesized for the first time using a hydrothermal method and used as the photoanode of a DSSC. The Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure comprises a Zn poor-Zn2SnO4 plate and Zn-doped SnO2 nanothorns growing on the plate, both of which have high electron mobilities. Using TiCl4 treatment of the photoanode, a thin layer of TiO2 nanoparticles were coated on the Zn–Sn–O nanostructures, enhancing the dye adsorption and charge injection and thus increasing the photocurrent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a photoanode structure consisting of Zn–Sn–O cactus–core morphology. This photoanode has the advantage of good electron injection and good electron transport resulting in comparable efficiency at lower dye loading to a conventional TiO2 photoanode.
2. Experimental
2.1 Zn–Sn–O nanocactus synthesis
The Zn–Sn–O nanocactus was prepared by a hydrothermal method. Typically, a 30 mL mixture of equal amounts of ethanol and deionized water containing 1.0 mmol Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 1.0 mmol SnCl4, and 15.0 mmol NaOH was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation after being washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. Finally, the product was dried completely at 70 °C.
2.2 
          Electrode preparation and DSSC making
The typical procedures of the paste making and DSSC assembly are according to the standard TiO2 DSSC making procedures.21 The photoelectrodes were made by screen printing the pastes on FTO glass to the desired thickness. The TiCl4 treatment for the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus film was performed by immersing the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus photoelectrode into a 0.2 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 60 min at 80 °C, while the TiCl4 treatment for the P25 film was performed by immersing the P25 photoelectrode into a 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C. After that, the electrodes were washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove residual TiCl4, and then sintered at 500 °C in air for 30 min. Finally, the photoelectrodes were soaked in a mixture solution of equal amounts of tert-butanol and acetonitrile containing 0.5 mM N719 dye for 20–24 h at room temperature. For the preparation of the counter electrode, the perforated FTO sheet was washed with water as well as with a 0.01 M HCl solution in ethanol and cleaned by ultrasound in an acetone bath for 10 min. After removing residual organic contaminants by heating in air for 15 min at 400 °C, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6·6H2O solution (8 mM in isopropanol) and then with the heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. Iodide based low viscosity electrolyte with 50 mM of tri-iodide in acetonitrile (AN-50, Solaronix) was used as the electrolyte.
2.3 Characterization

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance, with Cu-Kα radiation operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, scanning from 2θ = 20 to 80°). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL JSM-7600F) and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 2100 TEM, 200 kV) were used to characterize the morphology and the crystallinity of the samples. The chemical composition was determined by EDS. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for surface-area and pore analyses were measured using an Nova 3200e (Quantachrome Instruments). UV-Vis spectra are measured by a Shimadzu 3600 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; VG ESCA 220i-XL) was employed to analyze the zinc oxidation state. Monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (hν = 1486.6 eV) is employed for analysis with a photoelectron take-off angle of 90° with respect to the surface plane. Charge compensation was performed by means of low-energy electron flooding and further correction was made based on adventitious C1s at 285.0 eV using the manufacturer's standard software. The error of binding energy is estimated to be within ±0.2 eV. The amount of adsorbed dye was measured by desorbing the dye into 20 mM NaOH solution with equal amounts of deionized water and ethanol and by absorption measurements of the solution using the absorption peak intensity of N719 at 511 nm. The current–voltage test of DSSCs were performed under one sun condition using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe, 100 mW cm−2). The incident-light intensity was calibrated using a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel, 70260) before each experiment. EIS experiments were performed under illumination provided by a red LED (λ = 627 nm), 19.2 nm FWHM) while the cell was biased at the Voc induced by the illumination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus

Fig. 1a shows the novel cactus structure obtained from the synthesis. The well-dispersed nanocactus has a fairly uniform size of about 1 μm. The average atomic ratio of Zn to Sn is 0.75:1 (Fig. S1).† In the higher magnification image of the cactus (Fig. 1b), one can see that the cactus comprises the core plate with thorns that grow parallel to the plate surface. The growth of the thorns is strictly confined to three directions oriented at 60° to each other. The thorns have a diameter of about 30 nm and the tip of the thorn is sharp. The EDS shows that the tip has an atomic ratio of Zn to Sn of 0.25:1, which implies that the composition of the tip might be Zn doped SnO2. The TEM image of a single Zn–Sn–O nanocactus is shown in Fig. 1c. Fig. 1d shows the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of one of the tips. One can distinguish the lattice fringes easily and no grain boundaries or defects were observed, implying a reasonably perfect single crystalline thorn. The two perpendicular lattice fringes show interplanar distances of about 0.343 nm and 0.335 nm, corresponding to (−110) and (001) planes of tetragonal SnO2. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED; inset in Fig. 1d) confirmed that the thorn is single crystalline and grows along the [001] direction.

The XRD pattern of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus (Fig. 2) corresponds well to face-centred Zn2SnO4 (JCPDS, 24-1470) and tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS, 41-1445). The peaks belonging to SnO2 showed a slight shift to smaller angles, which is a result of Zn doping in SnO2. For the peaks corresponding to face-centered Zn2SnO4, there is a shift to larger angles due to the Zn2SnO4 being Zn poor.

To distinguish the growth sequence and composition development of this novel structure, the reaction was terminated at 8 h (before the development of the thorns). Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the intermediate powder obtained and the composition is found to be still face-centered Zn2SnO4 and tetragonal SnO2. However, the (110) peak for SnO2 does not appear in this intermediate product and the (440) peak for Zn2SnO4 is more pronounced than the other peaks. Fig. 3b shows the SEM image of a single Zn–Sn–O nanocactus in the initial growth stage. Through EDS analysis, the atomic ratio of Zn to Sn is observed to increase from the center to the edge of the plate. Fig. 3c shows the corresponding TEM image. The inset shows the SAED pattern of the plate, from which one can see the hexagonally packed diffraction points corresponding to the FCC structure of Zn2SnO4. There exists a separation of the high index diffraction points which is due to the SnO2 crystals. From the HRTEM image of area 1 in Fig. 3c (Fig. 3d), one can see the lattice fringes in three directions have an interplanar distance of 0.261 nm. This result implies that the core plate is Zn poor Zn2SnO4 since the (220) plane of face-centred Zn2SnO4 has an interplanar distance of 0.306 nm. This agrees well with the XRD data as discussed earlier. In the diffraction pattern of area 1 shown in Fig. 3e, one can see the clear diffraction pattern corresponding to the hexagonal arrangement of the atoms which is comparable to the SAED pattern of the whole plate. Fig. 3f shows the HRTEM image of area 2 shown in Fig. 3c. One can see the two tips at 60° to each other have the same lattice fringes in three directions. Fig. 3g and 3h show the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the HRTEM image of the two tips in Fig. 3f, and the tips are found to grow along the (002) direction.

Fig. 4a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus; the two absorption edges at 3.58 eV and 3.98 eV can be attributed to Zn-doped SnO2 and Zn poor-Zn2SnO4 respectively. To check if there is band bending by Zn doping in SnO2, XPS measurements were conducted on the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus and compared with the pure SnO2 powder (Aldrich, 325 mesh, 99.9% trace metals basis). Fig. 4b presents a comparison of the Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 transition peaks. The binding energy for the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus decreased 0.4 eV compared with the pure SnO2 powder (from 486.8 eV to 486.4 eV for Sn 3d5/2 and from 495.2 eV to 494.8 eV respectively). It is considered that Zn doping decreases the binding energy of Sn and can be attributed to oxygen deficiency.35 The O 1s transition peak also shifted from 530.7 eV to 530.3 eV upon Zn doping (Fig. 4c). The shoulder peak could be ascribed to Sn–O–Zn coordination.35 A strong Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2spectrum (Fig. 4d) with corresponding binding energies of 1021 and 1044 eV confirms the presence of Zn in the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus system.

From the above XRD, TEM, EDS, UV-Vis and XPS analyses, it is confirmed that the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure is composed of a Zn poor-Zn2SnO4 core plate and Zn-doped SnO2 nanothorns. The pore-size distribution and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of this nanocactus structure are determined using nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms. It was found that the as grown Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure has a surface area of 36.3 m2 g−1. Next, we evaluate the performance of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus as a photoanode in a DSSC.
3.2 Photovoltaic performance
The Zn–Sn–O nanocactus was turned into a paste and the photoanode was prepared by screen-printing the paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and finally made into a DSSC.17 To compare the DSSC performance of the cactus structure, TiO2 (Degussa P25) cells were also made by the same procedure. Four types of DSSCs were fabricated and compared, they are based on: (I) Zn–Sn–O nanocactus photoanode (denoted as ZnSnO cactus), (II) Zn–Sn–O nanocactus photoanode with TiCl4 treatment (denoted as TiO2–ZnSnO Cactus), (III) TiO2 (P25) photoanode (denoted as P25), and (IV) TiO2 (P25) photoanode with TiCl4 treatment (denoted as TiO2–P25).
The characteristic current–voltage (I–V) curves of the four kinds of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5, and their photovoltaic parameters derived from the I–V curves are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the open-circuit photovoltage of the Zn–Sn–O cactus DSSC (0.76 V) is lower than the P25 based DSSC but much higher than those obtained in DSSCs based on SnO2 (0.52 V),23TiO2 coated SnO2 (0.67 V),5ZnO/SnO2 composites (0.67 V)36 or Zn2SnO4 (0.63 V),27 as listed in Table S1 (all with N719 dye).† The high Voc obtained here can be attributed to the better energy level matching in the present system with the I−/I3−redox couple since a comparable current density is achieved compared with pure SnO2 or Zn2SnO4 (Table S1).† The dye adsorption shows that the nanocactus has a similarly good dye adsorption property since the surface area is about two thirds of the surface area of P25 (∼50 m2 g−1), which is much better than the pure SnO2 systems.5 The PCE prior to TiCl4 treatment reaches 2.21%, which is much higher than other SnO2 based systems. The above results may imply that the composition and the intrinsic nature of the cactus system are favourable for it to be used as the photoanode of a DSSC. After TiCl4 treatment, the current density increased nearly three times, while the Voc and FF remained very high. The dye adsorption is improved by about 9% with the TiCl4 treatment (from 0.834 × 10−7 to 0.905 × 10−7 mol cm−2). The surface area of the Zn–Sn–O cactus photoanode was probably slightly increased due to the formation of a thin and rough TiO2 nanoparticle layer. This is confirmed by the increased dye loading. The PCE increases to 6.62%, which is comparable to the P25 system. From the device data, it can be seen that even with reduced dye adsorption, the Jsc and PCE of the cells with Zn–Sn–O as photoanode are comparable to the conventional TiO2 cells.

3.3 Inhibited charge recombination by TiCl4 treatment
To reveal the kinetics of charge transport and transfer in these photoelectrodes, EIS spectra were collected using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat and the Nova 1.5 software package.37–41 All the EIS spectra were fitted with an equivalent circuit using ZView software.37
The chemical capacitance (Cμ) for the Zn–Sn–O cactus has a smaller value than that of P25, and it increases four-fold after TiCl4 treatment (Fig. 6a). Since Cμ reflects the change of electron density when there is a small variation in the chemical potential,37 it is obvious that the surface states were greatly increased due to the TiCl4 treatment of the Zn–Sn–O cactus photoanode, which will finally contribute to a longer electron lifetime (τn).
 Fig. 6  Characteristic data of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus (8 μm) with or without TiCl4 treatment and TiO2 (10 μm P25 with TiCl4 treatment) DSSCs extracted from the EIS spectra. (a) The chemical capacitance Cμ, (b) the interfacial charge recombination resistance Rrec as a function of the applied voltage, (c) Rrec as a function of Cμ, (d) the electron lifetime τn. 
The interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rrec) for the Zn–Sn–O cactus photoanode DSSC is always larger than that of the P25 photoanode based DSSC (Fig. 6b), while after TiCl4 treatment, Rrec decreases by half and has the same value as that of the P25 cells. Variations in the conduction band (Ec) also affect the recombination resistance values.42 As a result, in the present study, the interfacial charge recombination resistance is compared with the same density of states.43 Plots of Rrecversus Cμ of all the cells (Fig. 6c) show that the electron recombination of the Zn–Sn–O cactus DSSCs was greatly inhibited after TiCl4 treatment.
The electron lifetime is a characteristic time to evaluate the recombination rates of electrons at the interface. The electron lifetime for the Zn–Sn–O cactus photoanode DSSC is at least doubled after TiCl4 treatment (Fig. 6d). A low recombination rate is highly desirable to achieve a high charge-collection efficiency and will eventually lead to a high solar conversion efficiency. Since a larger electron lifetime stands for slower recombination during transport and an increased probability of the electrons being collected, there is no doubt that the TiCl4 treatment of the Zn–Sn–O cactus photoanode greatly increased the electron lifetime of Zn–Sn–O cactus films and finally greatly improved the power conversion efficiency.5
3.4 Excellent transport properties of Zn–Sn–O nanocactus for good charge collection
After TiCl4 treatment, the charge transport resistance (Rt) for the cactus DSSC increased greatly (Fig. 7a). It likely indicates that, intrinsically, the Zn–Sn–O has a better electron mobility than the deposited TiO2. The competition between transport and recombination of electrons is reflected in the effective diffusion length. The effective diffusion length (Ln) can be expressed as, (1)where L is the thickness of the photoanode films. The nanocactus structure has a diffusion length of at least five times the film thickness when measured in the voltage range of 0.55 V to 0.68 V (Fig. 7b), and decreases to 3 to 4 times of the film thickness after TiCl4 treatment from 0.57 V to 0.70 V. This indicates that the charge collection efficiency is good enough for both the cactus DSSCs with or without TiCl4 treatment,44 indicative of the excellent intrinsic transport properties of the Zn–Sn–O cactus material.
 Fig. 7  (a) The electron transport resistance in the photoanode material Rt as a function of Cμ, (b) the effective diffusion length Ln (with L as the unit), (c) the electron mobility μ with a dependence on Cμ. 
The electron (chemical) diffusion coefficient (Dn) can be calculated by37 Dn = L2n/τn = L2/RtCμ(2)
As a result, the electron mobility (μ) is calculated based on Einstein's relation, (3) where e is the elementary charge of an electron, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin and here we adopt room temperature (298 K). Plots of μ versus Cμ of all the cells (Fig. 7c) indicate that the electron mobility for the nanocactus photoanode is even larger than that of the TiCl4 treated P25 photoanode, indicating that the cactus material has a high intrinsic electron mobility which will favour the electron transport through a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance.
Since the dye adsorption for the Zn–Sn–O cactus photoanode is improved by about 9% with the TiCl4 treatment and the material has reasonable charge collection efficiency, more efficient charge injection can be expected considering the increase in chemical capacity, which indicates a much higher number of acceptor states to accommodate the injected charge. Electron injection into Zn–Sn–O may be difficult.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel, chemically stable Zn–Sn–O nanocactus structure with excellent transport properties was synthesized for the first time using a hydrothermal method and used as the photoanode of a DSSC. The overall power conversion efficiency for the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus based DSSC reaches 2.21% with a very high Voc of 0.76 V. EIS measurements showed that the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus film has a reasonably good effective diffusion length and high intrinsic electron mobility. After TiCl4 treatment of the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus film, the current density increased nearly three times. The PCE increases to 6.62%, which compares favourably to the P25 DSSCs. The reason for the enhancement of the PCE is found to be a great increase of the charge recombination resistance, the chemical capacitance (electron density) and the electron lifetime which inhibits the charge recombination and improves the electron injection efficiency. The composite Zn–Sn–O cactus–core TiO2 thin layer–shell structure provides not only a high surface area for dye adsorption and hence better light harvesting, a high surface state and hence a high electron injection efficiency, but also a densely packed microstructure for fast electron transport and thus a high electron collection efficiency. Therefore, through this work, it is found that the Zn–Sn–O nanocactus material, with excellent transport properties, is an immensely interesting material and could be a perfect photoanode candidate for dye-sensitized solar cells.
