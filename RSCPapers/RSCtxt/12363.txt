    , Accepted 27th February 2017First published on 27th February 2017AbstractThe thermal effects of NaYF4:Er microcrystals under 1550 nm laser diode irradiation were investigated using an infrared thermal imaging method. The results revealed that the temperature of the LD irradiation beam area was non-uniform. The NaYF4:Er sample exhibits a rapid temperature increase within 5–10 s, and the heating process reaches its steady state after 60 s of irradiation when exposed to 1550 nm LD. The response time, temperature increase, and emission intensity of the samples depend on the excitation power density and concentration of doped Er3+ ions. Low excitation power density is required to avoid the influence of thermal effects on the up-conversion emission spectra measurement. Rapid scanning in up-conversion emission spectra measurement is not effective in preventing the heating effect under high excitation power pumping. In addition, a relative deviation of temperature, existing in fluorescence intensity ratio technique, decreased with the increasing irradiation time.
1. Introduction
Up-conversion luminescence (UCL), a type of anti-Stokes luminescence usually with an infrared (IR) laser as the excitation source, plays an important role in biological fluorescence labelling, silicon solar cells, 3D displays, and anti-counterfeiting fields.1–7 UCL materials suffer from heating effects resulting from the traditional IR excitation source. To date, lanthanide-doped β-NaYF4, which is involved in numerous efforts, is considered to be one of the most efficient UCL materials.8,9 However, the quantum efficiency of UCL is low, and the maximum UCL quantum efficiency of RE3+-doped β-NaYF4 is only approximately 3–4%10 and 8–9%11 under 980 and 1510 nm pumping, respectively. This fact means that most incident excitation energy will be lost and would translate into heat energy, which will increase the temperature of the phosphor powder.12 This temperature increase limits practical applications: for example, a marked overheating effect resulting from the absorption of incident light of 980 nm LD by water is detrimental to biological applications.13 Moreover, the temperature increase will decrease the luminescent efficiency and affect the optical properties. Owing to the small LD beam area (usually only a few mm2) and low excitation power (usually not exceeding 1 W but with high power density), direct temperature increase measurement of UCL materials caused by incident LD is extremely difficult. Indirect methods have been used to investigate the thermal effects of UCL materials.14
In the present study, the thermal effects of NaYF4:Er material were investigated under 1550 nm LD irradiation for the first time. The dependence of up-conversion luminescence properties on thermal effects has been discussed. A temperature deviation between the direct recorded temperature and the measured temperature by fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique of the sample has been given. Several suggestions have been provided for the existing problems in the UCL performance test based on the experimental results of this study.
2. Experimental
Reflection, transmission, scattering, and absorption will occur when incident light irradiate on a solid (Fig. 1), and heating effects are only related to absorption. Interaction between incident light and nano samples would cause severe scattering. Therefore, high-crystallinity NaYF4:Er microcrystals synthesized via a solid-state reaction method were employed to reduce scattering interference and measurement error. The preparation method is as follows: Y2O3 (99.99%) and Er2O3 (99.99%) were dissolved in dilute nitrate solution to prepare lanthanide nitrate, to which, excess HF was added. The fluoride precursor was obtained after washing, centrifugation, and vacuum drying. Then, β-NaYF4:xEr samples were prepared according to ref. 15 by sintering the fluoride precursor in a quartz tube at 630 °C for 3 h in N2 (x = 10 and 25 mol%).
 Fig. 1  Interaction between incident light and samples. 
X-ray powder diffraction was performed at 40 kV and 40 mA from 10° to 70° using a D/MAX-Ultima+ X-ray generator with Cu-Kα (λ = 0.154184 nm) radiation. The samples were then pressed to form disks with a diameter of 14 mm and thickness of 2 mm at 30 MPa for 10 min (FW-4A) to further reduce measurement error induced by scattering and reflection. The purpose of the abovementioned step is to make scattering and reflection of all the samples as similar as possible to decrease fluctuations in the experimental results. The temperature of the samples surfaces was obtained by a VarioCAM hr infrared thermal imaging camera (Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), temperature measurement range of camera is from −40 to 600 °C with accuracy about ±2%). Due to wavelength of the 1.55 μm excitation source not being in the testing range of the VarioCAM hr infrared thermal imaging camera (7.5–14 μm), the thermal effects of the 1550 nm LD beam itself can be neglected. The photoluminescence (PL) and UCL spectra were obtained by a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and a power-tunable 1550 nm fiber laser diode (LD), respectively. The temperatures of the studied sample for PL temperature sensor were controlled by a home-made sample temperature controlling system DMU-TC 450. The sample was heated to a certain temperature for 10 min and then the PL spectrum was examined to ensure the uniform temperature of the sample, as shown in Fig. 7a. LD power was obtained by a LPE-1 power meter. A digital camera was used to determine the light beam area for calculating the power density. The LD beam was focused by a convex lens before measurement.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the β-NaYF4:Er sample. The peak positions of XRD patterns can be well indexed in accordance with β-NaYF4:Er crystals (JCPDS: 28-1192), indicating that crystals of β-NaYF4:Er hexagonal phase were synthesized. The two weak impurity peaks in the XRD pattern correspond to NaF, which results from excess NaSiF6. The peaks in the XRD are sharp and intense, proving that the as-prepared β-NaYF4:Er sample has high crystallinity.

The as-prepared β-NaYF4:Er presents high-efficiency UCL under 1550 nm pumping.16 The UCL performance of β-NaYF4:Er is optimal when the doping concentration of Er3+ is 10 mol% under 1550 nm pumping. The UCL quenching phenomenon occurs when the doping concentration of Er3+ is more than 25 mol%. Therefore, we chose 10 and 25 mol% Er3+ as the doping concentrations. NaYF4:10%Er presents a yellow-green UCL, whereas NaYF4:25%Er exhibits an orange-red UCL (Fig. 3). This is due to the enhancement of the red UCL component caused by the 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 cross-relaxed (CR) process with the increasing Er3+ ion concentration. Under the same excitation power density (0.74 W cm−2), the luminescence intensity of NaYF4:10%Er is slightly higher than that of NaYF4:25%Er.

Fig. 4 shows the temperature images of the NaYF4:25%Er sample at different irradiation times and the corresponding temperature curves (2.05 W cm−2, 127.7 mW). The temperature in the irradiated area of the NaYF4:25%Er sample presents a rapidly increasing trend within several seconds, and its temperature increases to 49.3 °C (close to the maximum temperature) from 28.7 °C (room temperature) after approximately 30 s of irradiation (Fig. 4b). The temperature increase (ΔT) is 21.4 °C. After irradiation time of t > 60 s, the surface temperature of the sample slowly increases. Thereafter, the temperature almost remains stable as the irradiation time increases to 600 s; the maximum ΔT is 22.6 °C. At this time, it achieves heat equilibrium between heat production and heat dissipation. The temperature of the sample surface rapidly decreases after irradiation stops. The ΔT at the center of the light beam area drops to one-second of the maximum ΔT within 2 s, and its temperature is about 1–2 °C higher than room temperature after 10 s when irradiation was stopped. The temperature of LD irradiation area is non-uniform with highest temperature in the center than around, which presents a temperature-fall process from the center to the surrounding (Fig. 4a). In the present study, the temperature mentioned, obtained by infrared thermal imaging, is always the highest temperature of the LD beam spot center.

To understand the effects of RE3+ ion concentration on the thermal effects of the sample, the temperature elevation of NaYF4:10%Er and NaYF4:25%Er samples on 1550 nm LD irradiation time at different power density have been discussed (Fig. 5). The temperature of the NaYF4:10%Er sample rapidly increased within 5–10 s, and was close to the equilibrium temperature in a short time, i.e., the response time was very short (5–25 s). The response time was 5 s at 0.57 W cm−2. When the excitation power density increased to 2.23 W cm−2, the response time was 25 s. Therefore, higher excitation power density would cause longer response time. The temperature elevation of the samples was complete after approximately 60 s. Excitation power density also exerts considerable influence on the temperature elevation of NaYF4:Er samples. Under low power density (0.57 W cm−2, 13 mW), the thermal effects of the NaYF4:10%Er sample were unremarkable with a temperature increase ΔT of 1.4 °C. Thermal effects were markedly enhanced with the increase in power density. The ΔT increased to 14.6 °C under 2.23 W cm−2 (152.2 mW) pumping (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  Temperature elevation of NaYF4:10%Er (a) and NaYF4:25%Er (b) samples with irradiation time at different power density under 1550 nm LD irradiation (1) 0.57 W cm−2, (2) 0.73 W cm−2, (3) 1.06 W cm−2, (4) 1.52 W cm−2, (5) 1.79 W cm−2, (6) 2.05 W cm−2, and (7) 2.23 W cm−2. 
Compared with NaYF4:10%Er, the temperature elevation of NaYF4:25%Er was more rapid (∼5 s) and the response time was shorter (Fig. 5b). In addition, the thermal effects of NaYF4:25%Er are more remarkable than those of NaYF4:10%Er. For instance, the ΔT values of NaYF4:25%Er were 2.6 °C and 27.2 °C under 0.57 and 2.23 W cm−2 pumping, respectively, being twice those of NaYF4:10%Er sample under the same conditions. This finding is due to the low intrinsic absorption efficiency of f–f part-forbidden transitions of the rare-earth ions; the doped ion content exerts a direct effect on absorption efficiency. The absorption efficiency of the NaYF4:25%Er sample is considerably higher compared to that of the NaYF4:10%Er sample for 1550 nm incident light.17–22 Only a small proportion of absorbed energy is used for UCL, whereas most of the energy will be transformed into heat energy. Therefore, although the visual UCL efficiency of the NaYF4:25%Er sample was lower than that of NaYF4:10%Er, the temperature increase ΔT of the NaYF4:25%Er surface was higher under equivalent irradiation conditions. Furthermore, the high efficiency of interaction containing CR results in significant thermal effects under higher Er3+ ion content conditions. Because no regular Stokes emission occurred for NaYF4:Er irradiated at 1550 nm (it is a common situation in UCL materials pumped at 980 nm), the heating effect was more obvious.23
Note that the reflection and scattering of NaYF4:10%Er and NaYF4:25%Er are equivalent, whereas the radiant energy absorption of NaYF4:10%Er is less than that of NaYF4:25%Er. Therefore, according to the principle of conservation of energy, we can logically believe that part of the energy of 1550 nm incident light not absorbed by the NaYF4:10%Er surface layer will undergo a deep penetration inside the sample and even penetrate through the sample, resulting in lower surface temperature than that of NaYF4:25%Er. Zhan et al.13 reported that the incident light of 915 nm LD presents less heating and larger imaging depth compared with that of 980 nm in an in vivo study. Therefore, in view of the abovementioned penetration depth in the sample, sufficient thickness of dense samples is essential for evaluating UCL efficiency via the relative intensity of up-conversion spectra or direct measurement of quantum efficiency. Moreover, sufficient thickness of sample is beneficial for the reduction of the influence of transmission, increase in real effective incident light absorption, and for promoting the UCL intensity, which are not mentioned in the reported evaluation methods.24,25
Owing to the extremely short response time (5–10 s) of temperature increase to LD irradiation, a short-time irradiation and rapid scanning in UCL spectra measurement cannot prevent the effect of thermal effects on optical characteristics, which may decrease luminescence intensity and change the profile of UCL spectra under high excitation power density. Dependence of UCL intensity on irradiation time was investigated under low and high power excitation, and the results confirm the abovementioned conclusion. The dependence of UCL intensity of NaYF4:10%Er and NaYF4:25%Er samples on irradiation time is shown in Fig. 6. The results show that the luminescence intensities of green emission decreased with the increasing irradiation time under 0.74 W cm−2 pumping. The NaYF4:Er samples present superior excitation characteristics under low excitation power, and the luminescence intensity was close to the detection limit of the spectrometer when excitation power density was slightly more than 0.74 W cm−2 1550 nm excitation. Therefore, the NIR UCL was obtained to investigate the effect of luminescence intensity on irradiation time under high excitation power density (3.44 W cm−2, 216 mW). The NIR luminescence intensities of NaYF4:10%Er and NaYF4:25%Er samples both present varying degrees of significant decrease and that of the NaYF4:25%Er sample decreased faster. Therefore, the doped RE3+ ion concentration and excitation power density have a significant influence on the decreased degree of UCL intensity originating from temperature elevation of samples. In the present study, the excitation density is relatively low with the highest value being only 3.44 W cm−2, whereas the maximum temperature elevation of the NaYF4:25%Er sample reached 27.2 °C and the UCL intensity decreased by 14%. Therefore, extremely low excitation power density (several W cm−2) is required to prevent the influence of thermal effects on UCL spectra measurement. However, the luminescence intensity of the sample is very weak under lower excitation density. It is crucial to balance two opposite phenomena, i.e., the higher UCL intensity and lower thermal effects.

FIR technology is a novel temperature measurement method, based on the dependence of FIR of thermal equilibrium level on temperature, and it has attracted significant attention. Since the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ ions are a couple of thermal equilibrium multiplets, the relative population follows a Boltzmann distribution. The ratio RHS of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, namely IH/IS, can be written as RHS = IH/IS = Cexp(−ΔE/κT)(1)where C is the constant related to the host materials, ΔE is the energy gap between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, κ is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Direct temperature measurement was used as a contrast to explore the accuracy of FIR measurement technology. The PL spectra of NaYF4:25%Er by 380 nm Xenon lamp were adopted to characterize the temperature sensor properties and to avoid the thermal effect in UCL caused by LD at different temperatures. The temperature-dependence of IH/IS of the NaYF4:25%Er sample is shown in Fig. 7a. The IH/IS values of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 energy levels continuously enhance with increasing heating temperature. Eqn 1 was fitted to the experimental data in Fig. 7a, and the curves for the NaYF4:25%Er sample from 20 °C to 127 °C can be expressed as RHS = 8.42exp(−1032.75/T)(2)
 Fig. 7  Temperature-dependence of FIR data of NaYF4:25%Er under 380 nm excitation (a) and the relationship between the direct measuring temperature and fitting temperature (b). 
Subsequently, UCL spectra of the NaYF4:25%Er sample were obtained under continuous irradiation of 1550 nm LD (0.73 W cm−2). The IH/IS of NaYF4:25%Er were obtained at different irradiation times and taken into eqn (2) to calculate the temperature of the sample under the corresponding radiation time (Fig. 7b). Compared with the results obtained by VarioCAM hr infrared thermal imaging camera, the temperature values calculated by FIR technology are lower. The temperature deviation (ΔTD) between calculated and direct measured values is 0.83 °C at 3 s. When irradiation time increases to 60 s, the ΔTD value dramatically increases to 3.23 °C. However, the ΔTD value gradually decreases as the irradiation time continues to increase. The ΔTD value stabilizes for t > 480 s. The minimum ΔTD value is 1.87 °C at t = 600 s. The average temperature of LD irradiation area is shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
The abovementioned phenomenon can be explained as follows. (1) The temperature calculated by FIR technology based on UCL is the average temperature value of the whole LD irradiation area due to the non-uniform temperature in LD irradiation area (Table S1, ESI†). While the direct temperature obtained by infrared thermal imaging is the highest temperature in the center of the LD irradiation area. Therefore, the temperature value calculated by FIR technology is lower than that obtained by the VarioCAM hr infrared thermal imaging camera. (2) The temperature of the spot remains stable as the irradiation time increases to 600 s. The temperature difference between the highest temperature of the center and the average temperature becomes smaller. Therefore, the ΔTD value decreases with the increasing irradiation time (i.e. heating temperature). (3) In addition, peak-differentiating and imitating of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 exists error and Boltzmann function fitting itself also has a deviation. There is a large uncertainty in the measurement of temperature based on UCL spectra. That is to say, temperature deviation ΔTD must be taken into consideration to obtain the accurate temperature values when using FIR temperature measurement technology based on UCL spectra.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the thermal effects of β-NaYF4:Er under 1550 nm irradiation were investigated by infrared thermal imaging camera. The results show that the temperature of LD irradiation area was non-uniform. Temperature deviation ΔTD must not be neglected for obtaining the accurate temperature values when using FIR temperature measure technology. The rapid heating process is completed within 5–10 s, and the heating process reaches steady state after 60 s of 1550 nm irradiation. Temperature increase depends on the excitation power density and content of doped Er3+ ions. The thermal effects of NaYF4:Er samples are remarkable under high power density pumping. Short-time irradiation and rapid UCL spectra measurement cannot avoid the heating effect of high excitation power density on UCL spectra measurement. Low power density is required to excite samples for minimizing the influence of thermal effects on UCL spectra measurement. In addition, the thickness of dense sample is necessary to ensure that most of the incident IR is absorbed by the samples and does not penetrate the samples.
