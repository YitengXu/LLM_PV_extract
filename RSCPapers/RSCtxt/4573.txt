    , Accepted 18th November 2021First published on 30th November 2021AbstractThe facile fabrication of low-cost photocatalysts with enhanced activity and high atomic utilization is becoming increasingly necessary for solar energy usage and/or conversion. In this work, a series of mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets with an enlarged specific surface area was synthesized via an inorganic acid-assisted exfoliation method without any soft or hard templates. An ultralow loading of downsized noble metal Pt was anchored on these porous nanosheets, exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity. The formation of mesoporous nanosheets in carbon nitride was expected to boost the mass transfer and shorten the charge carrier transfer route during the photocatalytic reaction. The characterization of samples revealed that the enhanced conductivity and photocurrent of the carbon nitride nanosheets also contributed to the enhanced H2 evolution activity. The maximum H2 production rates of 172.92 μmol h−1 and 321 μmol h−1 were achieved over the nanosheets derived from melamine and urea under visible light irradiation, which are 10.92- and 2.22-fold that of the corresponding bulk carbon nitride, respectively. This exfoliation method was demonstrated to be an efficient and universal method for the preparation of carbon nitride nanosheets with a mesoporous structure and high atom utilization of the co-catalyst for H2 evolution from water.
Introduction
The past few decades have witnessed a tremendous increase in fossil fuel demand, which is associated with environmental pollution, making research on sustainable and zero-emission environmentally friendly energy sources a top priority.1–4 As a typical representative of renewable and clean energy, H2 generated from photocatalytic water splitting has gained substantial attention. According to incomplete statistics, hundreds of semiconductors have been employed and investigated as photocatalysts for H2 generation.5,6 Among the reported semiconductors, polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has received great attention due to its unique properties, such as simple synthetic process, easy modification, low cost, non-toxicity, and high stability. As a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst, CN is composed of environmentally benign light elements and has a metal-free composition.7,8 However, bulk CN, which is typically synthesized via the polycondensation or copolymerization of organic precursors with a high content of carbon and nitride, usually exhibits low photocatalytic activity stemming from its small surface area, low pore volume, rapid recombination of photo-irradiated charge carriers and poor mass transfer. Thus, optimizing the photoelectric and structural properties of bulk CN to maximize its potential application in hydrogen production,9–11 oxygen reduction,12–14 oxygen evolution,15 CO2 photoreduction and organic pollutant conversion is highly desirable, but challenging.16–18
Among the various modification strategies including electronic structure modulation,19,20 molecular alignment and crystal-structure engineering,21 and the construction of heterojunctions,22,23 nanostructure-based strategies are considered facile, diverse, flexible and efficient approaches to obtain CN samples with functional bonds, unique electronic structures, and strong optical sensitivity. Although the ideal monolayered carbon nitride has a theoretical specific surface area of 2500 m2 g−1, the actual average specific surface area of carbon nitride derived from melamine is less than 10 m2 g−1 owing to its stacking.24 Thinner CN materials are commonly fabricated via hard/soft template or exfoliative methods such as liquid-phase ultrasonic exfoliation, chemical exfoliation,25,26 and alkaline metal ion or small molecular intercalation-induced exfoliation.27,28 It is worth emphasizing that the hydrothermal post-treatment can create microcosmic channels for electron and mass transfer, and simultaneously generate ultrathin mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets with good hydrophilicity. Theoretical investigations have revealed that carbon nitride nanosheets exhibit unique photoelectric and structure properties, and thus a promising material for the water cleavage reaction under light irradiation.29–31
Unfortunately, the shortage of template species, use of hazardous reagents such as organic solvents, and negative effects caused by carbon residues limit their application. Herein, mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets were synthesized through a proton-assisted solution assembly method. To maximize the noble metal atom efficiency, ultra-low loading downsized Pt species were anchored on the photocatalysts. It was found that Pt in the ionic state acted as a co-catalyst in the carbon nitride nanosheets, while metallic Pt species was also detected in the bulk carbon nitride. The optimized sample showed significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution activity and good stability under visible light irradiation. This enhanced activity should be mainly due to the greatly enlarged specific surface area, more exposed amine groups, and highly dispersed Pt co-catalyst in these carbon nitride nanosheets.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were analytical grade and used directly as receive without further purification. Melamine, concentrated nitric acid, and triethanolamine were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corp., P. R. China. Ethanol and sodium sulfate were supplied by Shanghai J&K Chemical Industries. Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate and Nafion solution (5%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water supplied by a Millipore system (Direct-Q 3UV) was used throughout the experiment.
Catalyst synthesis

Preparation of bulk carbon nitride (CN and CNu). 
Briefly, 5 g of melamine powder was put in alumina crucible with a cover and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h at a ramp rate of 2 K min−1 in air. After cooling to room temperature, the yellow sample was collected and ground into a fine powder in a quartz mortar for further use. The obtained bulk carbon nitride was denoted as CN. For comparison, 10 g urea was added to an alumina crucible and heated to 550 °C in air at a quicker ramp rate of 5 K min−1 to synthesize bulk carbon nitride (denoted as CNu).


Preparation of mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS, CNNSu). 
Firstly, 0.3 g of as-prepared CN powder was slowly added and uniformly dispersed in water with the assistance of an ultrasonic cell crusher in an ice bath. The crusher was equipped with a 0.6 cm flat tip probe at 40 W for 60 min. The pulse durations was set as on-time 2 s and off-time 2 s. Then, different amounts of 1 M HNO3 were added to the solution with the total volume of 55 mL and stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was finally transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 18 h in an electric oven. The resulting samples were collected and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times until the solution became neutral. Subsequently, this light-yellow powder was dried overnight in a vacuum drying oven at 45 °C. According to the dosage of 1 M HNO3 (2.5 mL, 5 mL, 10 mL, and 15 mL), the post-treated samples were labeled as CNNS-2.5H, CNNS-5H, CNNS-10H and CNNS-15H, respectively. The CNNSu-based samples were also treated using the same procedure. However, the added 1 M HNO3 volume was no more than 5 mL because the bulk carbon nitride derived from urea was completely decomposed when too much HNO3 was added to the hydrothermal system.


Preparation of ultralow loading Pt co-catalyst. 
The Pt co-catalyst was anchored on photocatalysts through a low-temperature decomposition method with slight modification.32,33 In detail, 100 mg carbon nitride was dispersed in 30 mL distilled water. H2PtCl6·6H2O (2 mg mL−1) was then added and stirred for 8 h at 80 °C. The volume of added H2PtCl6·6H2O solution was varied from 0.25 mL to 1.25 mL. The resulting catalysts were collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol several times, and dried overnight, followed by annealing at 125 °C under Ar protection in a controlled atmosphere furnace.

Characterization
The surface chemical state and morphology characterization of the as-synthesized samples was performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, England) with Al Kα monochromatization, Nicolet iZ10 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation, field emission scanning electron spectrometer (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800), and STEM transmission electron microscope (JEM-ARM200F). Surface adventitious carbon with a binding energy at 284.8 eV was chosen as the reference to calibrate all the binding energies in the high-resolution spectra. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and element mapping were also obtained by STEM operated at 200 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were measured on a Nano Scope IV instrument. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2500, Shimadzu, Japan) with BaSO4 as the reflectance reference, and the corresponding UV-vis adsorption spectra were obtained through Kubelka–Munk transformation. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) emission spectra were obtained on a JASCO FP-6500 and Hitachi F-7000 spectrometer, respectively. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were recorded on a Micronmeritics Tristar 2000 apparatus at 77 K. Prior to this measurement, the photocatalyst was evacuated and treated at 423 K under vacuum overnight. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of these samples was finally calculated according to the BET method. The content of Pt species in CNNS was analyzed via inductively couple plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES).
Photocatalytic evaluation
Photocatalytic H2 evolution from H2O was carried out in a Pyrex glass cell (volume: 439 mL) with a quartz optical entry window on the left side. The cell was connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. For each test, 50 mg catalyst was suspended in 250 mL of aqueous solution containing 30 mL triethanolamine scavenger. The suspension was thoroughly evacuated and degassed by a pump before each H2 evolution reaction. A xenon lamp (300 W) was employed to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. The evolved H2 was examined online by a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The incident photo number was measured using a radiant power energy meter (Ushio spectroradiometer, USR-40). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was finally calculated using the following equation:  
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement
Photoelectrochemical tests were carried out on a CHI electrochemical workstation (ASL/CH, 650 A) in a traditional three-electrode system with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt foil counter electrode. The working electrode was prepared by depositing the as-synthesized samples on FTO glass with an area of ca. 1.0 cm2. During the test, 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution served as the electrolyte. During the Mott–Schottky test, the working electrodes were obtained in advance via electrophoretic deposition in an acetone solution (50 mL) containing CN or CNNS powder (40 mg) and iodine (10 mg).
Results and discussion
Carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS) loaded with ultra-low Pt were synthesized, as illustrated in Scheme 1. To study the basic morphology and structural change in these samples, SEM and TEM were employed in the present work. The electron microscopy images of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1, where it can be clearly observed that a seriously agglomerated platelike bulk structure emerged in the CN sample (Fig. 1a). The hydrogen bond of the bulk carbon nitride would be disrupted by protic solvents in acid solution,34 inducing partial hydrolysis and lamellar CNNS output in relatively smaller pieces, as can be seen in Fig. 1b, which means that the interlayer and intralayer structure in carbon nitride was destroyed. After hydrothermal treatment, the obtained samples exhibited a mesoporous architecture composed of thin nanosheets with curved edges (Fig. 1c and d). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image in Fig. S1† shows that the randomly measured thickness of these laminar-structured nanosheets ranged from 1.1 nm to 1.5 nm, corresponding to 3–5 layers of C–N. These thin and curved nanosheets are interconnected with each other, forming a foam-like structure, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. It has been reported that porous materials can be generated with the in situ production of gas bubbles as template or vacancies.35–37 In this work, a small amount of H2O molecules and corrosive gases such as NH3, NO, and NO2 was produced during the hydrolysis process in the presence of HNO3 with strong oxidization ability and favourable exfoliation activity.31 The bulk carbon nitride was effectively exfoliated into thin nanosheets with abundant in-plane mesopores in this work. These in-plane mesopores not only endowed the catalysts with more boundaries, but also provided numerous newly exposed active sites and crossed diffusion channels, which can significantly speed up the mass transfer and stimulate light transport deeply in the mesoporous photocatalyst.38 Furthermore, the shortened transfer route induced by the mesoporous structure will remarkably promote the diffusion and separation of photogenerated charge carriers, greatly reducing the probability of their recombination in these samples. This type of structure and morphology change could also be reflected in the samples derived from urea (CNu and CNNSu), as shown in Fig. S2.† According to the ICP measurement, the Pt content in Pt/CNNS-5H with the added H2PtCl6·6H2O solution of 1 mL is 0.23 wt%. The anchored Pt species were uniformly dispersed in CNNS-5H, as demonstrated by element mapping (Fig. S3†). No Pt nanoparticles were detected in the high-resolution TEM images and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images of this sample, as shown in Fig. S3b and S4.† This indirectly demonstrates that the Pt species present in CNNS were efficiently downsized compared with that synthesized via the conventional thermal or photocatalytic decomposition method.

As can be seen in the power X-ray diffraction patterns in Fig. 2, both CN and CNNS give two distinct peaks located at around 13.1° and 27.4°, implying that these nanosheets had no significant change in their crystal structure compared with that of the bulk carbon nitride. The low-angle peak at around 13.1° is typically from the (100) in-plane structure repeating motifs of aromatic systems. This peak showed a downshift from 13.1° for the bulk counterpart to 12.7° for CNNS, implying a larger in-plane distance in the CNNS samples according to the Bragg equation, which is mainly caused by the mesoporous structure and simultaneously decreased planar size during hydrothermal treatment.39 With respect to the bulk CN sample, the CNNS sample showed a sharper diffraction peak at around 27.4°, which was derived from the periodic stacking of carbon nitride layers, indicating that the proton-assisted hydrothermal treatment favours the structure rearrangement in CNNS.40

The surface chemical state, composition, and functional groups were further studied by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3. Three peaks of oxygen (O 1s, 532 eV), carbon (C 1s, 285 eV), and nitrogen (N 1s, 400 eV) were clearly observed in the full scan spectrum (Fig. 3a). The weak signal located at around 76 eV corresponding to the Pt species was observed for CN. This signal was even weaker in CNNS, implying the lower Pt loading on its surface. The dominant C 1s peak at 288.26 eV corresponds to the sp2-hybridized C attached to N in the three-coordinated groups (NC–(N)2), while the peak at a lower binding energy of 284.8 eV is assigned to the sp2 C–C bond in the surface carbon impurities. The N 1s spectra were deconvoluted into four distinct peaks. The two peaks centered at 398.53 and 399.23 eV are attributed to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen in N2C (CN–C) and tertiary N in (N–(C)3), respectively. The peak at around 400.85 eV in the CN sample indicates the presence of amino (–NHx) functional groups. This peak in CNNS positively shifted to 400.95 eV, which is mainly due to the decreased electron density after being hydrothermal treatment in diluted HNO3. This peak shift, which was also seen for the CNNSu sample (Fig. S5†), confirms the loaded metal–support interaction between Pt and CNNS, resulting from the polarized electron transfer in Pt/CNNS.41 A weak peak at around 404.56 eV, which is derived from the charging effects or positive charge localization in the heterocycle heptazine systems, was also detected in the as-synthesized samples.42,43 The high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3d) exhibits two peaks at 531.72 and 532.84 eV, corresponding to C–O and CO groups, respectively.44 The O 1s peaks in CNNS showed a negative shift and their intensity was obviously enhanced, demonstrating the enhanced localized electron density and the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups.45 The Pt 4f spectrum in CN can be deconvoluted into four peaks, as shown in Fig. 3e, two of which with binding energies at 70.93 and 74.95 eV correspond to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 in the metallic state. The other two peaks at 72.58 and 76.27 eV are attributed to Pt2+ and Pt4+, respectively, indicating the co-existence of Pt0, Pt2+ and Pt4+ species.46 However, only two peaks at 73.04 and 76.34 eV, corresponding to Pt ions with relatively higher catalytic activity, emerged in CNNS,8 indicating that the Pt ions could be stabilized in the nanosheets not only derived from melamine, but also urea. Compared with that of Pt/CN, the positive shift in the Pt 4f peaks in Pt/CNNS revealed a decrease in the electron density, implying the priority of electron transfer between Pt and CNNS.

To study the chemical structure differences between CN and CNNS, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out, as shown in Fig. 3f. There was no significant difference in their spectra, implying that both samples showed similar features. In detail, the sharp peak at 807 cm−1 is due to the characteristic C–N stretching vibration mode of the triazine rings. The peaks in the range of 1200–1800 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of CN including C–N, CN, and CN in the heptazine heterocycles. The absorption peak at around 3320 cm−1 is attributed to the free amino groups and surface-adsorbed hydroxyl species. Additionally, the two new peaks in CNNS at around 3072 and 3270 cm−1 are also related to hydroxyl groups.47 Compared with bulk CN, the CNNS sample showed a new peak at 1080 cm−1, which is ascribed to the C–O stretching vibration, indicating the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups.46
To investigate the optical absorption properties of the as-obtained samples, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was applied in the range of 300–800 nm. The reflection was then converted to absorbance, as can be seen in Fig. 4a. All the photocatalysts could absorb ultraviolet and visible light, ensuring their photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. A progressive blueshift in the absorption edge can be found in the inset of Fig. 4a among the CNNS samples. The higher the HNO3 concentration in the hydrothermal solution, the more remarkable the blueshift phenomenon observed. The band gaps of these CN and CNNS materials were calculated using the formula (αhv)n = k(hv − Eg) based on the DRS spectra. The plot of (αhv)1/2vs. bandgap (hv) based on the spectral response, as shown in Fig. 4b, can give the extrapolated intercept, corresponding to the Eg value of the two representative CN and CNNS-5H catalysts. The bandgap energies of these materials increased gradually from 2.76 eV for CN to 2.88 eV for CNNS-15H, as listed in Table S1.† The conduction band edges of these two typical samples were also studied, as shown in Fig. S6.† The conduction band positions of these two samples were measured at various frequencies.48 The positive slope of the Mott–Schottky plots in Fig. S6† confirmed their n-type semiconductor character, which means that the flat band potential is approximately equal to the CB potential. Therefore, the CB edges of CN and CNNS were determined to be −1.12 eV and −0.85 eV vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, respectively.

Besides light absorption, other properties such as electron capture and hydrogen-reduction abilities are also main factors in determining the activities of the samples. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy, which is widely used to measure the irradiative recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, is a valid method to study the separation and migration behavior of charge carriers in photocatalysts.49–51 Therefore, the PL spectra of CN and CNNS were recorded. Compared to that of the bulk CN, the emission PL intensities of the CNNS samples were lower, implying the more efficient charge separation among these nanosheet materials. The emission peaks for CNNS showed a prominent blue shift, which is consistent with the bandgaps, as described above. Interestingly, it was obvious that CNNS-5H showed the lowest PL intensity, i.e., the lowest recombination rate of charge carriers in this catalyst, which is consistent with its highest photocatalytic activity, as discussed below.
To investigate the structural and textural properties of the samples, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K, as shown in Fig. 4d. All the isotherms of CNNS showed profound uptake of gaseous nitrogen because of the capillary condensation mainly in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.45–0.95, indicating the existence of distinct mesoporosity.13 The maximum specific surface area of CNNS reached 91.77 m2 g−1, which is almost 10-times that of CN (9.96 m2 g−1). The BET surface areas of all the samples are summarized in Table S1.† The surface area of CNNS increased with an increase in the content of added HNO3 and reached the maximum value for CNNS-5H, and then the area decreased slightly. Clearly, the enhanced specific surface area of CNNS could offer much more sufficient active sites, and thus accelerate mass transfer during the photocatalytic reaction for H2 evolution.
To elucidate the photoelectric characteristics such as charge carrier excitation and transfer of the obtained samples, the photo-induced electron–hole separation behavior of CN and CNNS was investigated photoelectrochemically (Fig. 5a). A fast photocurrent response was observed upon light-off and light-on in the two representative catalysts, indicating the extremely fast charge transport in the as-synthesized samples. In the CNNS-5H electrode, the photocurrent presented a quick increase once the light was on; however, a delayed transient could also be observed when light was off. This type of delay is believed to originate from electron release and trapping mediated by surface defects.52 The photocurrent of CNNS was greatly enhanced under AM 1.5, which was almost 3.3-fold that of CN. The higher photocurrent in the CNNS material suggests more efficient charge generation, transfer, separation, and thus higher photocatalytic activity. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, the average lifetimes are 1.28 ns (τ1 = 0.125 ns, 62.91% and τ2 = 3.23 ns, 37.09%) and 2.75 ns (τ1 = 1.05 ns, 54.34% and τ2 = 4.78 ns, 45.66%) for Pt/CN and Pt/CNNS, respectively. The average lifetime is regarded as a crude but rational measure to evaluate the photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency in a photocatalyst system. In this case, the 2.52-times prolonged average lifetime in Pt/CNNS guarantees more opportunities for electrons to participate in the H+ reduction reaction. Fig. 5c shows the EIS Nyquist plot of the two samples. Generally, a small arc radius in the EIS indicates a high electrical conductivity and low electron resistance value, corresponding to the efficient transfer and separation of photo-induced electrons and holes.

The photocatalytic activities for H2 evolution of CN and CNNS with different Pt co-catalyst loadings were measured in a closed Pyrex circulation system under visible light irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp. Triethanolamine (10 vol%) was added to the reaction solution, acting as a sacrificial agent and electron donor. As expected, all the CNNS photocatalysts showed enhanced activity for H2 evolution from H2O, as can be seen in Fig. 6a. A maximum H2 production rate of 172.79 μmol h−1 at 420 nm was reached over the optimized sample CNNS-5H with a Pt loading of 0.23 wt% (apparent quantum efficiency of this sample equals 2.45%), which is 10.73-fold greater than that of pristine bulk CN (16.10 μmol h−1). This type of activity enhancement could also be detected over CNu and CNNSu samples. The H2 production activity was enhanced from 144.5 μmol h−1 over CNu to 321.0 μmol h−1 on CNNSu with a low content of Pt as the co-catalyst (Fig. S7†). Compared with CNNS-5H, CNNS-10H and CNNS-15H showed lower catalytic activity, which may be ascribed to the deformation of the nanosheet structure and decreased specific surface area, as discussed above. Theoretically, the H2 evolution rate should be enhanced with an increase in the Pt cocatalyst loading. However, as shown in Fig. 6b, the evolution rate began to decrease when the added H2PtCl6 solution volume was over 1 mL, which is mainly ascribed to the decreased utilization of Pt atoms caused by the emergence of Pt nanoparticles.33 A comparison of the hydrogen evolution rate between this work and other related works is presented in Table S2.† As is known, stability is also a vital factor for the evaluation of a photocatalyst. Therefore, a photocatalytic stability test was performed on the optimized sample for four cycles. The high catalytic performance for H2 production was maintained after stability test, as shown in Fig. S8.† Furthermore, the XRD pattern of the used sample remained unchanged after the cycle test, which is consistent with its good stability.

It should be noted that the following steps are involved in the photocatalytic reaction: generation of charge carriers, photogenerated electron–hole separation, charge transfer, mass transfer and redox reaction. These steps together determine the final activity and are greatly influenced by the texture and physiochemical properties on the surface of the catalyst. Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the unique characteristics of CNNS contributed to its greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Firstly, the porous nanosheet structure exhibits an enhanced surface area, which can facilitate the mass transfer including reactants and products. Secondly, the thin nanosheet in CNNS will shorten the transfer distance of photogenerated charge carriers, and thus decrease the possibility of electron–hole recombination, as demonstrated by PL and TRPL. Lastly, the downsized Pt species could be stabilized and uniformly dispersed in the form of ions in CNNS, which would ensure the high efficiency of noble metal atom usage. Therefore, efficient photocatalytic reaction could be achieved in the present TEOA/H2O system, leading to a significantly improved H2 evolution performance. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons and holes of CNNS get separated easily.53,54 The photo-generated electrons in the conduction band would transfer from CNNS to the Pt species, while holes may be consumed by the triethanolamine scavenger. The Pt species in the photocatalytic system can act as an electron reservoir and active sites for H2 evolution.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of mesoporous ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets was synthesized with the assistance of protons in different concentrations of diluted HNO3 solution through the hydrothermal exfoliation method. The added inorganic acid HNO3 plays an important role in the formation of the porous nanosheet structure due to its strong corrosive and oxidizing property. In short, the inorganic acid could act as an exfoliating agent for the formation of CNNS. Furthermore, the gas bubbles generated from the decomposition of HNO3 and chemical bond breakage in carbon nitride during the hydrothermal treatment resulted in the porous structure. The greatly enlarged specific surface area and unique physiochemical characteristics of CNNS ensured the high dispersion of Pt species and enhanced the exposure of the active sites. The enhanced conductivity, shortened charge transfer pathway, and boosted charge transfer rate in CNNS led to a high charge carrier separation efficiency and H2 evolution activity. The maximum H2 production rate over CNNS-5H with an ultralow loading of Pt as the co-catalyst reached 172.79 μmol h−1, which is around 10.92-fold faster than that by the bulk CN. The calculated apparent quantum efficiency of CNNS-5H equals 2.45%. More importantly, this strategy for morphological control is universal. Mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets derived from the urea precursor could also be obtained and the photocatalytic activity of these nanosheets was also remarkably promoted. This method can pave a way to synthesize carbon nitride-based photocatalysts with quite high activity and noble metal atom utilization efficiency.
