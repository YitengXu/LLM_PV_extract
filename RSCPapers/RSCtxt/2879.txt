    , Accepted 27th March 2023First published on 24th May 2023AbstractIn this work, a novel flower-shaped NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was prepared by hydrothermal in situ synthesis using NV-g-C3N5 as the matrix and thioacetamide as the precursor. The prepared heterojunction showed a flower-like and layered structure, which widened the visible light absorption range and facilitated the usage of visible light. Under visible light irradiation, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction exhibited excellent photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction activity with an ammonia yield of 49.26 μg h−1 mg−1 in an electrolyte solution saturated with N2. Moreover, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction achieved outstanding photocatalytic degradation activity. The photocatalytic degradation rate of Rhodamine (RhB) reached 95% in 35 min under visible light irradiation. More importantly, the catalyst displayed good reusability and stability after four cycling runs for the photodegradation of MB. The prepared catalyst showed excellent photocatalytic universality and was also applied to efficiently degrade organic pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB). Therefore, solar light-driven photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic applications based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction are expected to pave a new way for fertilizers, energy utilization, and environmental remediation.
1. Introduction
Solar light, as clean renewable energy, is one of the most promising alternatives to dwindling energy resources and environmental deterioration due to its universality, sustainability, abundance, and environmental benignity.1 Therefore, it is particularly significant to use solar energy towards environmental remediation and convert it into chemical energy using a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology. With the rapid development of industries, it is especially urgent to solve the problems aiming for environmental remediation.2 Recently, there has been increasing pollution, seriously affecting the ecological environment and human health. Organic dyes are the main pollutants of concern in wastewater due to their high toxicity and hardly degradable characteristics.3 In recent years, electrodialysis,4 electrolysis,5 extraction,6 and biosorption7 have been widely used in wastewater purification. However, these methods suffer from some shortcomings such as low treatment efficiency, only rough removal of harmful substances in sewage, limited treatment range, long processing cycle, and complicated treatment steps. Therefore, the use of a simple, efficient, green, and no secondary pollution technology for the effective treatment of wastewater containing dyes is of great significance for environmental remediation. At present, photocatalytic technology, as an emerging advanced, efficient, green, and safe technology, shows great promise in environment remediation and energy utilization due to its low cost, harmful byproduct–free nature, and strong oxidative capability towards contaminants under solar light.8 It has become one of the most promising technologies for efficient wastewater treatment. The core of photocatalytic technology is the preparation of highly active photocatalysts, and hence, it is of great significance to prepare an inexpensive, readily available, and efficient photocatalyst for degrading pollutants by ingenious methods.
Ammonia, as a chemical base product, plays an increasingly important role in the development of science and technology, national economy, and especially fertilizer production.9 Production of ammonia is energy and resource intensive. Thus, ammonia needs to be produced in large quantities to meet the demand of industries, agriculture, science, and technology. Recently, biological nitrogen fixation,10 natural nitrogen fixation,11 and industrial nitrogen fixation (Haber–Bosch method)12 have been used to produce ammonia. However, the previous nitrogen fixation methods suffer from low yield and difficulty enhancing the yield. Especially, industrial ammonium production has disadvantages such as high energy consumption, high temperature and high pressure requirements, and difficultly controlling the yield. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly methods for nitrogen fixation research. At present, chemical nitrogen fixation methods such as photochemical,13 electrochemical,14 and photoelectrochemical method15 have attracted increasing attention due to the advantages of mild reaction conditions, convenient operation process, and low cost. Among these methods, photoelectrochemical technology has obtained increasing attention because it combines the advantages of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic methods.16 Furthermore, it is powered by clean sunlight. Under the action of an applied voltage, it can inhibit the recombination of charge carriers and improve the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst.17 It is noted that the photoelectrochemical method has its catalytic performance also related to the catalyst's performance.18 Therefore, the key to improving the efficiency of photoelectrochemical technology of ammonia lies in designing catalysts with high activity and high selectivity. However, the highly efficient conversion of solar energy is closely related to highly photoactive catalysts, which can direct the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy via a sustainable approach.
With the development of nanotechnology, manipulating nanostructures and synthesizing heterojunctions can promote efficient separation and utilization of the photo-generated charge carriers, greatly altering the catalytic performance of catalysts.19,20 Carbon nitride (CN) materials, non-metallic inorganic semiconductor polymers, have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their photocatalytic activity. Among them, the novel carbon nitride (g-C3N5) exhibits high thermodynamic stability and excellent electronic structure due to its triazole ring structure.21,22 In addition, g-C3N5 exhibits excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance due to its relatively low energy band gap (Eg = 2.2 eV). These excellent properties make g-C3N5 a very promising photoactive material.23 However, the g-C3N5 material has high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, it is of great significance to adopt a simple strategy to control the energy band gap of g-C3N5, reduce the radiative recombination rate of its electron–hole pairs, and further improve the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of g-C3N5. As we all know, the construction of surface defects of nanomaterials is an effective method to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts, because surface defects can provide active sites and efficaciously regulate the band gap,23,24 further promoting the generation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and thereby improving the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst.
Recently, two-dimensional transition metal sulfides have entered the field of view with many excellent properties. It has a two-dimensional layered structure similar to graphene, suitable band gap width, high carrier mobility, and unique valley spintronic properties, which is of great research significance.25 Among them, vanadium disulfide (VS2) as a typical metallic transition metal sulfide has a sandwich-like structure, and their unique layered structure is conducive to providing active sites.26 In addition, VS2 with good electrical conductivity and high reactivity has been applied in catalysts, humidity sensors, field effect transistors, supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries.27 However, there are few reports on photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic ammonia production. To fully exploit the performance of VS2 and expand its application, it is of great significance to design a VS2-based material for photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction and photocatalytic degradation.
In this work, a novel flower-shaped NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was prepared by hydrothermal in situ synthesis using NV-g-C3N5 as the matrix and thioacetamide as the precursor. The prepared heterojunction had good chemical stability and a wide visible light absorption range. More importantly, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction exhibited excellent photoelectron-catalytic nitrogen reduction activity with an ammonia yield of 49.26 μg h−1 mg−1 in an electrolyte solution saturated with N2 under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction achieved outstanding photocatalytic degradation activity under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation rate of Rhodamine (RhB) reached 95% in 35 min. The proposed catalyst was also applied to efficiently degrade organic pollutants such as MO and MB. Therefore, the solar light-driven photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction will pave a new way to produce ammonia and show great promise in environment remediation and energy utilization.

The used ultrapure water was prepared using a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system.
2.2. Apparatus
The morphology of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 nanosheets was characterized by JEOL-1230 (JEOL, Japan) transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 nanosheets were acquired using an S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a field emission electron gun at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV (Hitachi Ltd, Japan). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded using a UV-vis DRS spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3310, Japan). Optical characterization was performed using a UV-2450 ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co, Japan). Fluorescence analysis was performed using an F-7000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi Co, Japan). NV-g-C3N5@VS2 functional group analysis was performed using a K-Alpha 1063 XPS (Thermo Fisher Co., U.K.). A solar simulator (xenon lamp, CEL-HXF300) with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the source of illumination, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl), a platinum wire and a modified FTO electrode were used as the reference, counter, and working electrodes, respectively.
2.3. Preparation of NV-g-C3N5
First, nitrogen-vacancy graphitic carbon nitride (NV-g-C3N5) was prepared by thermal polymerization using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as precursors.24 After mixing 1.5 g of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole with a NaOH solution (0.005–0.3 g NaOH with 1 mL of ultrapure water), it was completely dried. Subsequently, the mixture of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and NaOH was first transferred to a 30 mL crucible and then to a muffle furnace for calcination at 500 °C for 3 h. The heating rate of the muffle furnace was 10 °C min−1. After natural cooling, a brownish-yellow product was obtained. In order to prepare NV-g-C3N5 nanosheets, the NV-g-C3N5 samples mixed with 6 mL of HCl (0.1 mol L−1) were put into a 10 mL centrifuge tube and sonicated for 6 h. After that, the obtained product was washed with ultrapure water to neutral. In addition, the original g-C3N5 material was prepared by the above-mentioned synthesis processes using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole as the precursor.
2.4. Preparation of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction
A NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was prepared by a hydrothermal method using NV-g-C3N5 nanosheets as the precursor, ammonium metavanadate as the vanadium source, and thioacetamide as the sulfur source. Briefly, 0.1 g NV-g-C3N5 and 0.2 g ammonium metavanadate were first added into a 50 mL beaker and then 11.25 mL ultrapure water and 2.25 mL ammonia water were added into the beaker, followed by stirring for 15 min to obtain a mixed solution. Then, 0.6 g thioacetamide was added to the above solution and continuously stirred until dissolution. The above solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon liner, and the reaction vessel with the Teflon liner was tightened and then placed in an oven at 160 °C for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the reactant was transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube for centrifugation at a centrifugation speed of 5000 rpm for 5 min to remove the supernatant. The obtained precipitate was washed alternately with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol for 4 times. After that, the washed precipitate was placed in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Finally, the obtained product was stored in a 2 mL centrifuge tube for further characterization and applications.
2.5. Preparation of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2/FTO electrode
First, 20 mg of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was weighed and added into a 2 mL centrifuge tube and then 1 mL of ultrapure water was added, followed by sonication for 30 min to disperse them. After that, 50 μL of the catalyst solution was dispensed with a pipette and dispersed on the pretreated F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode. The obtained FTO glass electrode was dried under infrared light. To prevent the samples from falling off the electrode surface, 20 μL of 0.05 wt% chitosan solution was drop-coated onto the surface of NV-g-C3N5@VS2/FTO, and finally dried under infrared light for 30 min. After drying in the air, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2/FTO electrode was obtained.
2.6. Photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction of N2
The photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction was carried out under the illumination of a solar simulator (xenon lamp, CEL-HXF300) with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). A three-electrode sealed H-cell with a proton exchange membrane was used for photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction. A saturated Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) and a platinum sheet (10 × 10 × 0.2 mm) were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. NV-g-C3N5@VS2-modified FTO was used as the working electrode, which was fixed by a glassy carbon electrode holder. In this experiment, 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte solution. Before each test, the electrolyte was deoxidized by high-purity N2 for 30 min to exclude dissolved O2, and the nitrogen gas was continuously and steadily bubbled in during the test to continuously provide N2. The photoelectrocatalytic system was analyzed on a CHI1030C electrochemical workstation at about 25 °C.
2.7. Determination of UV absorbance of NH3 standard solution
Ammonia production was determined by an indoxyl blue method.28 First, 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 μg mL−1 standard NH4+ solutions were prepared. Then, 2 mL of the prepared standard NH4+ solutions were put into a 10 mL centrifuge tube, and 2 mL of oxidizing solution (1.0 M NaOH containing 5 wt% C7H6O3 and C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), 1 mL of 0.05 M NaClO and 0.2 mL of 1 wt% Na2[Fe(NO)(CN)5]·2H2O were mixed into it, shaken well, and reacted in the darkness for 2 h. After that, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the solution was recorded using a UV-2450 spectrophotometer, and the absorption value of the absorption peak at 655 nm was determined.
2.8. Calculation of the production rate of ammonia
The production rate (r) of ammonia was calculated using the following formula:29 (1)where [NH3] is the concentration of NH3 (calculated from the NH4Cl standard curve), V is the volume of electrolyte (60 mL), t is the reaction time, and M is the catalyst loading.
2.9. Photocatalytic degradation based on NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions
In order to study the degradation properties of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, Rhodamine was used as the degraded product for photocatalytic degradation. First, 0.02 g NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions were put into the bottom of the reactor. Subsequently, 10 mL Rhodamine (RhB, 40 μg mL−1) was pipetted into the reactor. The reactor was stirred simultaneously under direct solar light irradiation for 30 min. The temperature of the solution was between 28 and 32 °C. The concentration of Rhodamine was measured using UV-vis absorption every 5 min. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency (y) of Rhodamine was obtained using the following equation: y = (1 − Ct/C0) × 100%(2)where C0 is the initial concentration of the Rhodamine solution and Ct is the concentration of Rhodamine at time t.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction
To study the morphological features of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to characterize the material. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction showed a flower-like and layered structure. As shown in Fig. 1C and D, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has an obvious layered structure, which greatly increases the specific surface area of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction. To explore the elemental composition of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, its energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterization was performed. As shown in Fig. S1A (ESI†), the EDX spectrum shows that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is mainly composed of C, N, S, and V, and the presence of O element may be caused by partial oxidation of the material. As shown in Fig. 1E–I, the EDX mapping further indicated that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was mainly composed of C, N, S and V. To further study the specific surface area and adsorption performance of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, we obtained its nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm. As shown in Fig. S1B (ESI†), the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has stronger N2 adsorption performance than that of single NV-g-C3N5, and the results indicate that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has a larger specific surface area and a certain pore size. In addition, the construction of a heterojunction is beneficial for the improvement of physical properties of the prepared catalyst.30–32

To investigate the functional group information of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, we performed Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the prepared material. As shown in Fig. 2A, after the addition of NaOH, a new peak was observed in NV-g-C3N5 at 2170 cm−1, which was ascribed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the cyano group (–CN).24 The characterization results show that the introduction of –CN may be due to the reaction of NaOH with the precursor or intermediate –NH2 during the condensation process of triazole rings, leading to a decrease in the –NH2 concentration and suggesting the production of nitrogen vacancies in the g-C3N5 material.16,24 Two new peaks were observed at 681 cm−1 and 982 cm−1 in the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, which we assigned to V–S–V and VS, indicating the preparation of VS2 in the heterojunction.33,34 As shown in Fig. 2B, the XPS full spectrum of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, showing obvious peaks around 164 eV, 285 eV, 401 eV, 524 eV, and 531 eV, further demonstrates that the prepared heterojunction material is mainly composed of S, C, N, V and O elements.35 The existence of O may result from the fact that the surface of the sample is oxidized. In Fig. 2C, the high-resolution XPS image of C 1s presents four peaks at 284.8 eV, 286 eV, 286.4 eV, and 288 eV, which are assigned to C–C/CC, N–CN, C–O, and CO.36 In Fig. 2D, the high-resolution XPS image of N 1s exhibits two peaks at 400.0 eV and 401.0 eV, which are the characteristic peaks of N3C and –NH, respectively.37 In Fig. 2E, the high-resolution XPS image of S 2p presents two peaks at 163.9 eV and 162.7 eV, which are the characteristic peaks of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively.38 In Fig. 2F, the high-resolution XPS image of V 2p presents two peaks at 523.7 eV and 516.3 eV, which are the characteristic peaks of V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2, respectively.39 These results indicate that V and S are in the valence of +4 and −2 in the heterojunction, and also show that the V and S elements in the material exist in the form of VS2.

To further investigate the optical properties of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, we investigated the UV-vis DRS spectra of NV-g-C3N5, VS2 and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction. As shown in Fig. S2A (ESI†), the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was found to have a wider light absorption range than pristine g-C3N5, NV-g-C3N5 and VS2, which may be due to the introduction of nitrogen defects and heterojunctions that make the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction enhance light-harvesting capacity. As shown in Fig. S2B (ESI†), compared with the single NV-g-C3N5 and VS2 materials, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction exhibits a weaker light intensity under the excitation of a certain wavelength of light, indicating that the construction of heterojunction promotes the transfer of electrons.40,41 The experimental result implies that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction possesses more excellent photochemical catalytic properties.
3.2. Quantitative analysis of NH3
The absorbance of the standard NH4+ solution was measured by an indoxyl blue method.42 As shown in Fig. S3A (ESI†), the absorbance value at 655 nm gradually increased with the increase in the concentration of NH4+. As shown in Fig. S3B (ESI†), the linear relationship between the standard NH4+ concentration and the absorbance value at 655 nm was constructed. The linear equation is y = 0.1408x + 0.0485. The drawn standard curve has a good linear correlation coefficient. According to this linear equation, the amount of ammonia produced in photoelectrocatalytic ammonia production research can be determined.
3.3. Optimization of experimental conditions and calculation of production rate of ammonia
In order to obtain the best photoelectrocatalytic performance of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction for the ammonia production system, optimization of experimental conditions was explored. The highest production rate of ammonia was used as the standard for choosing the optimal synthesized conditions. The production rate of ammonia was calculated using eqn (1). The production rate of ammonia of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction was calculated under different preparation conditions, and the results are listed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the production rate of ammonia reaches the highest value with 0.1:0.2:0.6 of the mass ratio of NV-g-C3N5 (the NV-g-C3N5 was obtained from 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole pretreated with 0.05 g NaOH), ammonium metavanadate and thioacetamide at 160 °C for 20 h. Meanwhile, the ammonia production rate was as high as 49.26 μg h−1 mg−1 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (60 mL) at a bias voltage of −0.4 V under visible light irradiation. Therefore, under the hydrothermal conditions of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction with 0.1:0.2:0.6 of the mass ratio of NV-g-C3N5 pretreated with 0.05 g NaOH, ammonium metavanadate and thioacetamide at 160 °C for 20 h, the production rate of ammonia of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction with the best photoelectrocatalytic performance was as high as 49.26 μg h−1 mg−1 in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at a bias voltage of −0.4 V under visible light irradiation. The production rate of ammonia based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is higher than that of some reported methods (Table S1, ESI†).
To explore the mechanism of photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, a control experiment was also conducted to study the effect of electrolyte solution saturated with N2 and visible light. From Fig. 3A, it can be observed that the production rate of ammonia based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is low under illumination and filled inert gases (Ar) at −0.4 V applied voltage. The result indicates that NH3 comes from the reduction reaction of N2. Meanwhile, the production rate of ammonia with filled N2, −0.4 V bias and illumination increases compared with that without illumination. The result indicates that illumination plays an important role in photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction. Compared with photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction with light, filled N2 and without the applied voltage, photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction with light, filled N2 and −0.4 V bias is higher, indicating that the applied voltage has an auxiliary effect on nitrogen reduction. Furthermore, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has the highest production rate of ammonia under illumination and filled N2 at −0.4 V applied voltage. The result indicates that the applied voltage and illumination play a significant role in photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction and filled N2 is the source of produced ammonia in the photoelectrocatalytic reaction. In addition, NH3 comes from the reduction reaction of N2.

(B) Production rate of ammonia based on FTO (a), VS2 (b), NV-g-C3N5 (c) and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions (d) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution saturated with N2 at a bias voltage of −0.4 V under visible light irradiation. The concentration of the catalyst is 2 mg mL−1. 
Additionally, the photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance of blank FTO, VS2, NV-g-C3N5, and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions was first investigated. As shown in Fig. 3B, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has the highest production rate of ammonia compared with blank FTO, VS2 and NV-g-C3N5. The result is attributed to the introduction of nitrogen defects and the construction of the heterojunction, which are beneficial for the electronic transmission performance, and synergistically inhibit the radiative recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby effectively enhancing the photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction. To further demonstrate the excellent electrical conductivity and low recombination rates of electron–hole pairs of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra and photocurrent of the samples were collected. From Fig. S5A (ESI†), it can be observed that the arc radii of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction electrode is the smallest compared with that of NV-g-C3N5 and VS2. The results indicate the most excellent electrical conductivity compared with NV-g-C3N5 and VS2. From Fig. S5B (ESI†), it can be observed that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has the highest photocurrent and stable photocurrent response compared with NV-g-C3N5 and VS2. The results indicate that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction exhibits low recombination rates of electron–hole pairs, which are beneficial for the photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction of N2.
For comparison, NV-C3N5 and VS2 were mechanically mixed and the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the mixture was tested. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the ammonia yield of NV-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions is 49.26 μg h−1 mg−1, while that of the mechanically mixed NV-C3N5 and VS2 is 20 μg h−1 mg−1. These results indicate that the photoelectrocatalytic activity of NV-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions synthesized by a hydrothermal method is higher than that of the mechanically mixed NV-C3N5 and VS2 under visible light. This may be because that the mechanically stirred preparation is unable to mix NV-C3N5 and VS2 effectively, limiting the efficient transfer of photo-induced electrons.
3.4. Mechanism of ammonia production based on the photoelectrocatalytic reaction
It is speculated that the photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction mechanism of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Scheme 1A. The construction of the heterojunction with the “Z-type” band structure is based on NV-g-C3N5 and VS2. To demonstrate the mechanism of action of photo-induced electrons, the band gaps of the NV-g-C3N5 and VS2 were first calculated by the optical absorption measurements and Kubelka–Munk function, respectively. The calculation using the Kubelka–Munk function is as follows:43 α(hν) ≈ B(hν − Eg)2(3)where Eg, h, B, ν and α represent the band gap of indirect allowed transition (eV), Planck's constant (J s), absorption constant, frequency of the light (s−1) and extinction coefficient, respectively. The Eg value was obtained when the slope is extrapolated to α = 0 (Fig. S8A and B, ESI†).24Eqn (4) was used to calculate the band gap energy of different samples: Eg = (1239.84 × m)/b(4)where m and b are obtained by the linear fit (y = mx + b) of the flat section of the UV-vis spectrum. According to eqn (4), the band gaps of NV-g--g-C3N5 and VS2 were calculated to be 1.73 eV and 1.96 eV.

Furthermore, the position of the valence band (VB) and conductive band (CB) of NV-g-C3N5 and VS2 were calculated using empirical formulas, respectively:21 ECB = X − Ec − 1/2Eg(5) EVB = ECB + Eg(6) X = [x(A)ax(B)bx(C)c]1/(a + b + c)(7)where Ec represents the energy of hydrogen free electrons vs. hydrogen (4.5 eV), Eg represents the band gap of the semiconductor, ECB and EVB represent the potential of VB and CB, respectively, and X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, indicated as the geometric average of the absolute electronegativity (also regarded as Mulliken electronegativity) of the atoms comprising the compound. x(A), x(B) and x(C) represent the Pearson absolute electronegativity of atoms in the semiconductor. In addition, a, b, and c are the number of atoms in the semiconductor.
According to eqn (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7), the calculated ECB and EVB of NV-g-C3N5 are −1.59 eV and 0.14 eV, and that of VS2 are −0.3 eV and 1.93 eV, respectively. In addition, the energy band structure of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is shown in Scheme 1A. The electrons in the valence band of NV-g-C3N5 are more likely to excite to conduction band under illumination. In addition, the electrons in the conduction band of NV-g-C3N5 are easily transferred to the conduction band of VS2. Therefore, the electrons transferring from NV-g-C3N5 to VS2 restrict the recombination of electron–hole pairs, further improving the PEC performance of the prepared NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction. Additionally, due to the existence of nitrogen defects providing more catalytic sites, NV-g-C3N5 more easily adsorbs nitrogen in the electrolyte (Scheme 1A), making the photogenerated electrons catalyze nitrogen reduction in the nitrogen defects and further improving the photoelectrocatalytic ability of the heterojunction.
3.5. Photocatalytic application of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions
The photocatalytic properties of pristine g-C3N5, NV-g-C3N5, VS2 and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions were investigated by constructing a reaction model for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants like RhB under visible light irradiation. The absorbance of the standard RhB solution was measured via a UV-vis spectrometer. As shown in Fig. S9A (ESI†), the linear relationship between the standard RhB concentration and the absorbance value at 655 nm was constructed. Before the photocatalytic experiment, the maximum adsorption capacity of pristine g-C3N5, NV-g-C3N5, VS2 and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions was investigated. As observed from Fig. S10 (ESI†), the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction exhibits the highest adsorption capacity compared with that of pristine g-C3N5, NV-g-C3N5 and VS2. It is because the prepared heterojunction has a large specific surface area. During the photocatalytic experiment, the mixtures of RB and catalysts were first stirred in the darkness for 3 min. As shown in Fig. 4A, the photocatalytic degradation ratios of RhB with pristine g-C3N5, NV-g-C3N5 and VS2 are 7.5%, 24% and 36% within 35 min, respectively. However, the photodegradation rate of RhB based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is as high as about 95% after 35 min of illumination. It is evident that the introduction of nitrogen defects effectively adjusts the band gap and provides more catalytic sites, which enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N5. Meanwhile, the construction of heterojunctions suppresses the radiative recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby greatly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. For comparison, the NV-C3N5 and VS2 were mechanically mixed and the photocatalytic activity of the mixture was tested. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the photodegradation rate of RhB based on NV-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions is 95%, while that of the mechanically mixed NV-C3N5 and VS2 is 46%. These results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of NV-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions is higher than that of the mechanically mixed NV-C3N5 and VS2 under visible light. This may be because the mechanically stirred preparation is unable to combine NV-C3N5 and VS2 effectively, limiting the efficient transfer of photo-induced electrons.
 Fig. 4  (A) Change ratio RB concentration with irradiation time over pristine g-C3N5, VS2, NV-g-C3N5 and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions under visible light irradiation. (B) Linear relationship between ln(C0/C) and irradiation time over pristine g-C3N5, VS2, NV-g-C3N5 and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions. C0 = 40 mg L−1. C is the remaining concentration of RB. The concentration of catalyst is 2 mg mL−1. 
To explore the reusability and stability of photocatalytical degradation based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, the cycling runs for the photodegradation of MB were performed. From Fig. S12 (ESI†), it is observed that there is no significant decrease in photocatalytic activity after four cycles. The result indicates that NV-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions have good reusability and stability in visible light photodegradation reactions.
In addition, to further investigate the universality of photocatalytical degradation based on NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions, we investigated the degradation performance of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction to other pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB). As shown in Fig. S9B and C (ESI†), the linear relationships between the standard concentration of MB and MO and the absorbance were constructed. As presented in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the photodegradation efficiency of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction for MO and MB is also high. The degradation rates of MO and MB are as high as 93% and 97%, and the results show that the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction with excellent photocatalytic performance has also excellent photocatalytic effects for the degradation of MO and MB, further demonstrating that the photocatalytical degradation based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction displays the universality.
3.6. Analysis of the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions
According to the pseudo-first-order reaction model (eqn (8)),44 the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RB was investigated. ln(C0/C) = kapt(8)where kap and t are the apparent reaction rate constant and irradiation time, respectively. C0 is the original concentration of RB. In addition, C is the concentration of MB at irradiation time t. A linear relationship between ln(C0/C) with irradiation time (t) is shown in Fig. 4B. The photocatalytic degradation curves of pristine g-C3N5, VS2, NV-g-C3N5 and NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions are in accordance with the pseudo-first-order kinetics. In addition, the degradation rate constant of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions (0.028 min−1) is the largest when compared with pristine g-C3N5 (9.7 × 10−4 min−1), VS2 (1.3 × 10−3 min−1) and NV-g-C3N5 (9.6 × 10−3 min−1). The results indicate that the introduction of nitrogen defects and the construction of heterojunctions greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity and further promote the degradation rate.
3.7. Mechanism analysis of the photocatalytic reaction of NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions
The energy band structure of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction is shown in Scheme 1B. Electrons of NV-g-C3N5 and VS2 were excited from VB to CB, which left holes in the VB for both semiconductors under illumination. According to the energy band structure, the electrons in the valence band of NV-g-C3N5 are more likely to excite to conduction band under illumination. In addition, the photoinduced electrons easily transfer from NV-g-C3N5 to VS2, and the holes of VS2 transfer to the more negative potential of VB of NV-g-C3N5. Since the CB of NV-g-C3N5 (−1.57 eV) is more negative than that reduction potential of O2 (−0.33 eV),45 some of the photoexcited electrons on the NV-g-C3N5 reacted with dissolved oxygen (O2) and generate active superoxide radicals (˙O2−).46 ˙O2− with high oxidation activity effectively degrades the pollutants (RhB). Because the CB potential of NV-g-C3N5 (−1.57 eV) is more negative than the CB of VS2 (−0.3 eV), the photoinduced electrons can easily inject into the CB of VS2.46 Similarly, the VB position of VS2 (1.96 eV) is more positive than the VB of NV-g-C3N5 (0.14 eV). The photogenerated holes on the VB of VS2 can directly transfer to the VB of NV-g-C3N5.16,46 These transfers of electrons and holes greatly reduce the electron–hole recombination, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes can diffuse to the heterojunction surface and directly degrade the adsorbed pollution.
It is noted that the p-benzoquinone (BQ) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as the main scavengers of ˙O2− and hydroxyl radical (˙OH), can effectively capture ˙O2− and ˙OH, respectively.47,48 In order to further explain the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB by the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction, radical trapping experiments with addition of BQ and DMSO were employed to explore the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions. As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the degradation rate of RhB with BQ and DMSO decreased to 59% and 52%, respectively. Compared with the photocatalytic degradation ratio without addition of ˙O2− and ˙OH, the photocatalytic degradation ratio was significantly decreased with the addition of ˙O2− and ˙OH. The results show ˙O2− and ˙OH, the main active species, are the main active substances in the photo-driven degradation of RhB based on NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions under visible light.
4. Conclusions
To sum up, a novel flower-like NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction has been prepared by a hydrothermal in situ method using ultrasound-treated NV-g-C3N5 as the matrix, ammonium metavanadate as the vanadium source, and thioacetamide as the sulfur source. The prepared heterojunction had good chemical stability, wide visible light absorption range, and outstanding photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance. More importantly, the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction exhibited excellent photoelectron-catalytic nitrogen reduction activity with an ammonia yield of 49.26 μg h−1 mg−1 in the electrolyte solution saturated with N2 under visible light. Meanwhile, NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunctions achieved photocatalytic degradation activity under visible light. The photocatalytic degradation rate of Rhodamine (RhB) reached 95% for 35 min. The proposed catalyst was also applied to efficiently degrade organic pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB). The solar light-driven photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants based on the NV-g-C3N5@VS2 heterojunction will pave a new way to produce ammonia and show great promise in environment remediation and energy conversion.
