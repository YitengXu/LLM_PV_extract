    , Accepted 2nd August 2020First published on 3rd August 2020AbstractExpanding the spectrum response through photon energy conversion is an effective way to further increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the Cr3+ passivated CsPbCl3:Mn2+ perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) were synthesized, which display high absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light, improved photoluminescence (PL) with a large Stokes shift, and improved stability, which is the ideal photon energy converter for PSCs. The optimal photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ PQDs reach 97% with 7.5 mol% of Cr3+. The enhancement of PLQYs can be attributed to the passivation effect of Cr3+ and the increased energy transfer rate from perovskite to Mn2+. The efficient converter was assembled on the surface of the PSCs, which display 7.40% relative increase of PCE from 20.81% to 22.35%. This work provides a method to tune the PL properties of quantum dot materials and a universal strategy to further increase the performance and even break the Shockley–Queisser limit of solar cells.
Introduction
Metal-halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaics and optoelectronic technologies due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, such as long carrier diffusion length,1 low defect densities,2 and high carrier mobilities,3 and their versatility in producing high-quality thin films.4 Since the advent of the first perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in 2009,5 their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 25.2%.6 The limitation of PCE for PSCs can be attributed to the low spectral response in the ultraviolet (UV) region (300–400 nm). Tandem solar cells, such as perovskite/silicon solar cells7,8 and polymer/perovskite solar cells,9,10 are considered to be an effective solution to solve this problem. However, the fabrication technology for tandem solar cells is complicated and costs too much.11 Photon energy conversion, which can convert UV light to visible or infrared light by efficient luminescent materials, is considered to be an effective approach due to their simple structure, low-cost fabrication, ambient operation, and long-term stability.12–16 A good photon energy converter needs to display high light absorption in the UV wavelength, high quantum yield, extraordinary transparency in the visible region, and large Stokes shift to reduce the self-reabsorption losses.17–20
All-inorganic colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) demonstrate a large absorption cross-section, high-photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), size-tunable band gap, high transparency in the visible spectrum but sensitivity to UV radiation, enabling them to become promising photon energy converters for PSCs.21–25 Among them, blue CsPbCl3 PQDs with a wide band gap (larger than 3 eV) could be an ideal UV downshifting material. Unfortunately, the virgin CsPbCl3 PQDs can emit only at 402 nm because of their narrow band-edge emission.26–28 The relatively small Stokes shift brings about significant self-re-absorption loss in the PQDs. To overcome this problem, transition-metal Mn2+ doped PQDs have been developed, because of their excellent PL properties and ionic radius and valence state that are similar to those of Pb2+ ions.29,30 Mn2+ ion doped CsPbX3 PQDs demonstrate high absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light and efficient orange emission with a large Stokes shift (higher than 200 nm), and are almost transparent in visible light.31,32 However, the PLQY of the Mn2+ ion doped PQDs is still low.33 Recently, many published studies have reported the passivation effect by introducing metal ions into the perovskite lattice, such as Ni2+, Pr3+, and Y3+, which can enhance the PLQY of the PQDs.28,34–37
In this work, the Cr3+, Mn2+ ion co-doped CsPbCl3 PQDs were successfully fabricated using a modified hot-injection method. Compared to the bare CsPbCl3 PQDs, the co-doped PQDs show higher PLQYs (97%), better stability, and enhanced UV absorption. The Cr3+, Mn2+ ion co-doped CsPbCl3 PQDs served as photon energy converters for PSCs. The PCE of the PSCs increased from 20.81% to 22.35%, with a relative enhancement of 7.40%.
The Cr3+, Mn2+, and Cr3+–Mn2+ doped CsPbCl3 PQDs were synthesized through a modified hot-injection method (see the ESI†).16 The as-prepared samples were examined by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique (Fig. 1a), and uniform and mono-disperse PQDs with a cubic phase were acquired. The average size of un-doped CsPbCl3 PQDs is determined to be 9.10 nm, which gradually decrease to 8.85 nm, 8.73 nm and 8.61 nm for CsPbCl3:Cr3+, CsPbCl3:Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+, respectively. According to previous literature, the doping ions substitute for Pb2+ ions. The decreased size after doping can be attributed to the lattice contraction of PQDs due to the substitution of larger-size Pb2+(1.19 Å) with smaller-sized ions (Cr3+: 0.615 Å, Mn2+: 0.67 Å). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and mapping images (Fig. 1b) have proven that the Cr3+ and Mn2+ ions have been involved in the CsPbCl3 PQDs. The doping concentration of Cr3+ and Mn2+ ions were determined to be 7.5 mol% and 12.1 mol%, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrate that all prepared PQDs exhibit the same cubic phase with CsPbCl3 and the (101) peaks gradually shift toward a large angle with doping different ions (Fig. 1c). Importantly, the FWHM of the diffraction peak at the (101) plane is 0.42° for the CsPbCl3 samples, whereas the FWHM becomes 0.33° for the Cr3+ and Mn2+ doped CsPbCl3 samples, indicating that the introduction of Cr3+ and Mn2+ can improve the crystallinity of CsPbCl3 QDs to some extent. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) shows that the interplanar distances of the (110) plane of CsPbCl3 PQDs is 4.01 Å, larger than that of CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ PQDs (3.97 Å, Fig. 1d). All these results can be attributed to the lattice contraction of PQDs, indicating the successful fabrication of Cr3+ and Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 PQDs.

To determine the location of Cr, XPS analysis of CsPbCl3:(7.5 mol%) Cr3+ and CsPbCl3 was performed as shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S1, ESI.† The results show the presence of Cs, Pb, Cl, and Cr elements in the CsPbCl3:(7.5 mol%) Cr3+ PQDs. The high-resolution XPS spectra revealed that the binding energy of Pb2+ 4f5/2 and Pb2+ 4f7/2 decreased obviously as Cr3+ ions were introduced (Fig. 1e), while the binding energies of Cs+ 3d3/2 and Cs+ 3d5/2 as well as those of Cl− 2p1/2 and Cl− 2p3/2 exhibited little variations (Fig. S1, ESI†). These results indicate that some Cr3+ ions have entered into the lattice of the CsPbCl3 perovskite host and most probably replace the Pb2+ sites rather than the Cs+ and Cl− sites.
To evaluate the influence on the structure of PQDs after introducing the Cr3+, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to simulate the electronic structures of the 7.5 mol% Cr3+ doped CsPbCl3 as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The introduction of Cr3+ may induce the formation of a small number of Pb2+ vacancies to compensate for excess charge, which will result in the distortion in the local crystal. As the proportion of Cr3+ is below 10%, this kind of distortion has little influence on the structure and luminescence. This can be verified by the DFT results. It can be seen that no other defects states were observed except a defect state induced by Cr3+. The defect state of Cr3+ is located near the bottom of the conduction band, which can be considered as a shallow energy level. The shallow energy level has little influence on the structure and luminescence. Therefore, the introduction of Cr3+ did not cause any instability in the crystal structure.

Fig. 2c presents the UV-vis absorption, the typical exciton absorption bands are 405 and 400 nm for bare CsPbCl3 and 7.5 mol% Cr3+ doped CsPbCl3 PQDs, respectively. The exciton bandgaps of the PQDs increase from 3.06 eV for the CsPbCl3 PQDs to 3.10 eV for the CsPbCl3:Cr3+ (7.5 mol%) PQDs. Accordingly, the emission peaks of the CsPbCl3 PQDs blue shift from 410 to 405 nm (Fig. 2d). Such a phenomenon is mainly assigned to the lattice contraction of PQDs by substituting Pb2+ with Cr3+. The PL intensity was enhanced by about 10 fold after the introduction of Cr3+ (Fig. 2d). As reported in previously published studies,34–37 the increase of the luminescence can be attributed to the surface passivation effect. Firstly, the introduction of Cr3+ (CrCl3) will result in a Cl-rich environment, which can reduce the density of the Cl− vacancies. Secondly, the Cr3+ can be anchored onto the surface of the PQDs, forming a new bond, filling the surface Pb–Cl ion pair defects, and repairing the uncoordinated Pb atoms. This can be proved by the dynamics of CsPbCl3 and Cr3+ doped CsPbCl3 (Fig. 2e), in which the decay time increases from 5.24 to 16.37 ns after doping with Cr3+. The large increase of the decay time can be attributed to the decrease of the non-radiative rate related to defects. By increasing the concentration of Cr3+ from 0 to 8.9 mol%, the optimal doping concentration of Cr3+ was studied at 7.5%, with the highest PLQY of 85% (Fig. 2f).
Based on the above investigations, the Cr3+ passivated Mn2+ doped CsPbCl3 PQDs were fabricated. To study the impact of surface passivation on the physical properties of the PQDs, the absorption and PL spectra were recorded. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 3a, the as-synthesized pristine CsPbCl3:(12.1 mol%) Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:(7.5 mol%) Cr3+,(12.1 mol%) Mn2+ PQDs exhibit sharp excitonic absorption at 397 and 392 nm, respectively. The bandgap increases after doping with Cr3+, which can be attributed to the lattice contraction. The excitonic emission peaks were situated at 404 and 400 nm for the pristine CsPbCl3:Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ PQDs respectively. The emission of Mn2+ ions centered at 610 nm can be observed for the two samples. Both the excitonic and Mn2+ emissions were increased, in which the increase of Mn2+ emission takes the main part. The intensity ratio of Mn2+ to excitonic emission can be calculated by integrating the PL spectra, which increases after the introduction of Cr3+, indicating that the energy transfer rate from perovskite to Mn2+ may be increased. The decay time of excitonic emission increases from 2.78 ns to 4.22 ns due to the surface passivation effect of the Cr3+ ions (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c shows the PLQY of excitonic and Mn2+ emission for the pristine CsPbCl3:Mn and Cr3+ passivated CsPbCl3:Mn PQDs. With increasing concentration of Cr3+, the excitonic and Mn2+ emissions display an increasing trend due to the passivation effect that reduces the nonradiative rate. The overall PLQY increases with increasing Cr3+, which reaches the optimum 97% at 7.5 mol%. Further increasing the Cr3+ results in the PLQY starting to decrease, which can be attributed to the fact that the excess Cr3+ may induce the structural distortion of the octahedral lattice due to the difference between the Cr3+ and Pb2+ radius.

The increase in decay time for the Mn2+ doped samples after introducing Cr3+ (Fig. 3b) is not as dramatic as the increase shown in Fig. 2c. Therefore, we deduce that the energy transfer rate may be increased in the Cr3+, Mn2+ doped PQDs. As shown in Fig. 3d, the energy transfer rate (RET) can be determined by the reverse of the excitonic decay time constant as a function of Sm3+ concentrations, to be RD = Rs + RET[C], where the RD represents the spontaneous decay rate of the perovskite, Rs represents the decay rate of the perovskite without doping, RET is the energy transfer rate from the perovskite to the Mn2+, and [C] is the doping concentration of the Mn2+ ions. The fitting result shows that the RET is 0.021 and 0.030 ns−1 mol−1, respectively. The introduction of Cr3+ leads to an increase in the RET by about 1.5 fold, which contributes to the enhancement of PL and PLQY. The mechanism of the PL process for the Cr3+ and Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 PQDs is shown in Fig. 3e. Under the excitation of a 365 nm light, the electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band of the CsPbCl3 PQD host to form bounded excitons, emitting blue photons due to the excitonic recombination. The Mn2+ substitution induces an intermediate quantum state in the CsPbCl3 PQDs, which generates a new recombination pathway. The electrons can transfer the energy to the 4E and 4T2 level of Mn2+, generating the Mn2+ emission. Besides the band-edge emission and energy transfer from the CsPbCl3 host to the Mn2+ ions, the non-radiative transition to traps such as Cl vacancies can also occur. The introduction of Cr3+ can inhibit the defect-related non-radiative transition through reducing the Cl− vacancies and surface passivation, which induced the increase of the decay time of excitonic emission. Meanwhile, the energy transfer rate from CsPbCl3 to the Mn2+ ions was found to increase after the introduction of Cr3+. This can be associated with the decrease of the defect density. The energy transfer from perovskite to Mn2+ ions is competing with the nonradiative transition to defects. The decrease of defect density leads to the decrease of nonradiative transition rate to defects, which results in the increase of energy transfer from perovskite to Mn2+ ions.
More importantly, the stability of the colloidal CsPbCl3 PQDs is greatly improved after the Cr3+ doping (Fig. 3f). The PL intensity of Cr3+, Mn2+ doped CsPbCl3 PQDs maintains 98.5% of the original intensity after 10 days of storage and remains at 95% after 150 days, which is much more stable compared with the Mn2+ doped CsPbCl3 PQDs. It is known that the instability of PQDs can be attributed to the decomposition of PQDs when exposed to air or water. As discussed above, the Cr3+ can fill the surface Pb–Cl ion pair defects, and repair the uncoordinated Pb atoms, which leads to the increase in structural stability. Therefore, the increase in PL stability can be attributed to the increase in the structural stability.
The efficient Cr3+ passivated Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 PQDs were explored as a downconverter to enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The structure of the PSC is shown in Fig. 4a, which combines the ITO substrate, In doped SnO2 electron transport layer (100 nm thickness), Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite layer (650 nm), Spiro-oMeTAD hole transport layer (150 nm) and the gold layer (100 nm). The CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film was firstly purified by ethyl acetate and was deposited on the surface of the ITO side. When irradiated by sunlight, the UV light can be absorbed and converted to visible light, which can increase the PCE of the PSC and decrease the decomposition of the perovskite induced by the UV light. A good down-converter layer needs to display high light absorption in the UV wavelength, high quantum yield, extraordinary transparency in the visible region, and large Stokes shift to reduce the self-reabsorption losses.18 As shown in Fig. 4b, the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film has a wide band gap of about 3 eV and only absorbs the sunlight with a wavelength lower than 400 nm, which has little influence on the utilization of visible light by PSCs. The absorbed UV light was converted to the visible light at 610 nm, which can be effectively utilized by the PSC. The optical transmittance of the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film (270 nm thickness) is above 95% in the visible region (Fig. 4b). The increase of short-circuit (ΔJsc) in the PSC induced by the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film can be estimated through the transmittance spectrum and IPCE, using the following equation (see clarification in the ESI†),

, where q is the electron charge and F(λ) is the incident photon flux density (AM 1.5, ASTM G173) at wavelength λ, and IPCE (610 nm) is the IPCE response around 610 nm. As the emission of Mn2+ ions is a broadband, the IPCE at this region floats around 93 to 96%. A(λ) is the absorption coefficient of QDs. T(film) is the transmittance of the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film after considering the absorption of PQDs and the sub-band gap scattering, which varied from 95% to 98%. The calculated ΔJsc in theory is 2.55–2.73 mA cm−2.
The J–V curves of the champion PSCs, including the pristine PSC and the PSCs coated with different thicknesses of CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ films, are reported in Fig. 4c and Table 1. The pristine PSCs reached a PCE of 20.81% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.093 V and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 24.52 mA cm−3, whereas the PSCs with CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ films all showed a considerable improvement of Jsc. Among them, the PSC with a 270 nm perovskite converter film displayed a PCE of 22.35%, with a Voc of 1.101 V and Jsc of 26.31 mA cm−2 (Table 1), which was relatively enhanced by 7.40%. The increase in short-circuit current (ΔJsc) is 1.79 mA cm−2, which is lower than the theoretical results. This can be mainly attributed to the insufficient absorption of the converted light by SSCs and suboptimal thickness. Assuming that the 270 nm thickness is the optimum condition, the absorption percentage of the converted light by PSCs is about 65.6 to 70.2%.

To evaluate the influence of the passivation effect of Cr3+ ions on the photon energy conversion, the performance of PSCs with CsPbCl3:(12.1 mol%) Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:(7.5 mol%) Cr3+,(12.1 mol%) Mn2+ films is compared in Fig. 4d and Table 1. The PCE of the PSC with the CsPbCl3:Mn2+ film was 21.70 with a Voc of 1.099 V and Jsc of 25.45 mA cm−2 (Table 1), which was relatively enhanced by 4.28%. The difference between PSCs with CsPbCl3:Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ films can be mainly attributed to the different PLQYs induced by the passivation of Cr3+ ions. To further analyze the mechanism of the enhancement of PCEs, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves are shown in Fig. 4d, which shows considerable improvement in the photoelectric responses from 300–410 nm for both PSCs assembled with the CsPbCl3:Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ films. The improvement of IPCE response for PSC with the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film is higher than that of PSC with the CsPbCl3:Mn2+ film, attributing to the more effective photon energy conversion from UV to visible light of the perovskite film induced by the passivation of Cr3+ ions. The Jsc under solar illumination can be predicted by the convolution of the IPCE spectra with the photo flux density distribution for 1 sun by the following equation, . The calculated Jsc values were 24.31, 24.37, and 26.06 mA cm−2 for the original PSC, and PSCs with CsPbCl3:Mn2+ and CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ films respectively, which agreed well with the I–V results.
The long-term stability of pristine PSC and PSC with converters was also studied (Fig. 4e). It can be seen that the PCEs of the pristine PSC started to decrease after 30 days. After 60 days, the PCE of SSC was decreased by 20% in percentage, which can be attributed to the decomposition of perovskite QDs due to exposure to the UV light. The PSC assembled with the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ film was much more stable, which still maintained 90% of PCE after 60 days. The enhancement of the stability can be attributed to the isolation to the UV light induced by the CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ converter.
Conclusion
In this work, the CsPbCl3:Cr3+ and CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ PQDs were fabricated, in which the Cr and Mn ions successfully substituted the Pb sites. Firstly, the initial PLQYs of CsPbCl3 is largely amplified from 8% to 85% due to the surface passivation effect of Cr3+ ions. The introduction of Cr3+ (CrCl3) will result in a Cl-rich environment, which can reduce the density of the Cl− vacancies. The Cr3+ can fill the surface Pb–Cl ion pair defects, and heal the uncoordinated Pb atoms. Second, the Cr3+ passivated CsPbCl3:Mn2+ PQDs with a PLQY of 97% was synthesized. The energy transfer rate from PQDs to Mn2+ ions was enhanced about 1.5 fold by introducing Cr3+ ions. Third, the efficient CsPbCl3:Cr3+,Mn2+ PQDs were explored as a photon energy downconverter to enhance the performance of the PSCs. The PCE of the PSC was enhanced from 20.81% to 22.35%, and relatively enhanced 7.40%. The increase in the PCE was mainly ascribed to the increase of photocurrent by converting the UV light to visible light. This work provides a strategy for improving the PL and stability of QDs and demonstrates a way to further enhance the performance of PSCs through expanding the spectral response, which is of great importance for the material and energy fields.
