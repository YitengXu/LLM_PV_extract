    First published on 9th November 2015AbstractIn order to develop high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs), full exploitation of the sun-irradiation from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) is one of the key factors to ensure high photocurrents and thus high efficiency. In this review, five of the effective design rules for approaching LBG semiconducting polymers with high molar absorptivity, suitable energy levels, high charge carrier mobility and high solubility in organic solvents are overviewed. These design stratagems include fused heterocycles for facilitating π-electron flowing along the polymer backbone, groups/atoms bridging adjacent rings for maintaining a high planarity, introduction of electron-withdrawing units for lowering the bandgap (Eg), donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymerization for narrowing Eg and 2-dimensional conjugation for broadened absorption and enhanced hole mobility. It has been demonstrated that LBG semiconducting polymers based on electron-donor units combined with strong electron-withdrawing units possess excellent electronic and optic properties, emerging as excellent candidates for efficient PSCs. While for ultrasensitive photodetectors (PDs), which have intensive applications in both scientific and industrial sectors, sensing from the UV to the NIR region is of critical importance. For polymer PDs, Eg as low as 0.8 eV has been obtained through a rational design stratagem, covering a broad wavelength range from the UV to the NIR region (1450 nm). However, the response time of the polymer PDs are severely limited by the hole mobility of LBG semiconducting polymers, which is significantly lower than those of the inorganic materials. Thus, further advancing the hole mobility of LBG semiconducting polymers is of equal importance as broadening the spectral response for approaching uncooled ultrasensitive broadband polymer PDs in the future study.

1. Introduction
The development of semiconducting polymers has been very active in the last few decades, and such fever still lasts until now in the field of polymeric photovoltaics including polymer solar cells (PSCs) and polymer photodetectors (PPDs).1–5 The semiconducting polymers stand out due to their tunable electronic and optical properties, low-cost, high flexibility, versatility of synthetic chemistry, etc.,6–8 which entitled them to be prominent candidates in the future market of opto-electronic devices, as substitutes for their inorganic counterparts.9–11 Among tons of semiconducting polymers having been studied during the last few decades, low bandgap (LBG) semiconducting polymers,12–20 possessing a typical bandgap smaller than 1.6 eV and absorption cut-off in the near infrared (NIR) region, emerge as one of the most intriguing categories for the investigation of PSCs and PPDs, in particular.
In the field of PSCs, NIR absorbance enables the generation of NIR photocurrent, which is an effective way to enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) and thus the power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addition, according to the molecular design, the majority of LBG semiconducting polymers own more delocalized π electrons, extended conjugation and enhanced planarity of the polymer chains than their wide bandgap (WBG) counterparts.21,22 These outcomes give rise to a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in terms of the lowered highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor polymer, an enlarged JSC in terms of the facilitated inter-molecular hole transport and an enhanced fill factor (FF) in terms of balanced electron and hole transport between the electron donor (D) polymers and the electron acceptor (A) fullerene derivatives. As a result, over 10% PCEs have been observed from single junction PSCs based on LBG semiconducting polymers,23–26 which showed a significant breakthrough towards the commercialization of PSCs.
In the field of photodetectors (PDs), GaN-, Si- and InGaAs-based PDs are the three major types dominating commercial markets, which are responsible for the ultraviolet (UV) detection (200–350 nm),27 visible detection (400–800 nm)28,29 and NIR detection (900–1700 nm),30 respectively. Even though the fabrication technology for inorganic PDs has been quite mature, the limitations including costly materials, device inflexibility and rigorous temperatures (for example, 4.2 K for InGaAs-based PDs)30 required for the manufacturing process strongly stimulate the exploration of other alternatives. In addition, each type of inorganic PD only covers a confined sub-band, making it difficult to fabricate multicolor PDs that have extensive applications in daily lives.31,32 LBG semiconducting polymers, with absorption spectra extending from the visible to the NIR region, comes up as a promising candidate to realize low-cost PPDs with high quantum efficiency, high sensitivity, and high speed over the broad spectral range from the UV to the NIR region. In 2009, such PPDs using LBG semiconducting polymers have been demonstrated by Gong and Heeger. Operated at room temperature, PPDs possess a wide spectral response from 300 to 1450 nm and high detectivities over 1012 Jones.33
In this review, the strategies for designing LBG semiconducting polymers are highlighted, aiming to enhance their electronic and optical properties so as to meet the requirement for high performance PSCs and PPDs. In the first section, the design rules for approaching LBG semiconducting polymers are summarized. In particular, by tuning the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels through molecular engineering, the bandgaps will be properly narrowed, enabling the extension of absorption spectra of LBG semiconducting polymers to the NIR region, resulting in the augmented JSC in PSCs and broadened spectral response in PPDs, respectively. In addition, the correlations between the molecular design and the polymer main chain stacking in the thin films would offer valuable information for enhancing the JSC and FF in PSCs, and the photoresponsivity in PPDs, respectively. In general, the designing motif of LBG semiconducting polymers highlighted in this review will certainly offer fresh and novel strategies for the future development of LBG semiconducting polymers due to their potential applications in high performance PSCs and uncooled ultrasensitive broadband PPDs. In the second section, the applications of LBG semiconducting polymers in PSCs classified by three effective D units for constructing the D–A copolymers are overviewed. The applications of each design rule in the promising LBG semiconducting polymers are elaborated, with the photophysical properties of polymers and device performance of PSCs being illustrated as feedback. Therefore, further development of LBG semiconducting polymers for approaching high efficiency PSCs would be attainable. In the third section, we analyze the fundamental physics of PPDs, in particular, the figure of merits used to evaluate the device performance of PPDs. In addition, the development of broadband PPDs is overviewed. Finally, the development of LBG semiconducting polymers and their applications in polymeric photovoltaics are summarized. The perspective areas of LBG semiconducting polymers are overviewed.
2. Development of LBG semiconducting polymers
2.1. LBG semiconducting polymers
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composites consisting of polymers as D and fullerene derivatives as A are the most intensively investigated systems in PSCs and PPDs.34–37 Their operational mechanisms are depicted in Fig. 1a: incident light irradiating on the BHJ active layer stimulates the formation of excitons (bounded electron–hole pair) in both D and A, followed by excitons diffusing into the D/A interfaces. Then the energy level offset (Ed) between the LUMO levels of D and A, which overcome the exciton binding energy, drives the exciton dissociation. The electron and hole transfer takes place through the A and D interpenetrating networks towards the cathode and the anode, respectively, which are eventually collected by the external electrode to generate photocurrent and photovoltage in both PSCs and PPDs. Fig. 1b illustrates the current density (J) versus voltage (V) (J–V) characteristics of PSCs, where JSC and VOC are pointed out, with FF and PCE being obtained according to the equations inserted in Fig. 1b. JSC is mainly determined by absorption efficiency of the BHJ active layer, combined with the charge carrier dissociation and transportation to the respective electrodes. Therefore, designing LBG semiconducting polymers with strong and broad optical spectra to fully exploit the sun irradiation is a crucial and an effective way to approach high JSC, thereby high PCE. It's also notable that to maintain a large VOC is of importance while fine-tuning the HOMO energy levels of LBG semiconducting polymers, since VOC is proportional to the energy level difference between the HOMO energy level of D and the LUMO energy level of A (Ebi).38 The FFs in PSCs are generally limited by the unbalanced charge carrier transports owing to much higher electron mobilities of fullerene derivatives than the hole mobilities of polymers.39 Therefore, to enhance the hole mobilities of polymers by molecular design which aims to balance electron mobilities of fullerene derivatives, is another important subject for approaching PSCs with high PCEs.

2.2 Structural factors
For polyaromatic conjugated systems, there are two resonance structures for the ground state within nondegenerate energy: the aromatic structure formed by the confined π electrons; and the quinoid structure originated from the delocalization of flowing π electrons along the conjugated chains, which simultaneously converts a double bond to a single bond and vice versa, as shown in Fig. 2.40 The aromatic form is energetically more stable, while the quinoid form has a higher energy and a lower bandgap (Eg).41 Since the Eg of a polyaromatic system is originated from the alternations in single and double bonds, it will be strongly dependent on the five structural factors as discussed below.
 Fig. 2  Aromatic and quinoid resonance forms for the ground state within nondegenerate energy. 
Firstly, the bond length alternation (BLA),40 an important geometric parameter, which is defined as the average of the difference in length between the adjacent carbon–carbon bonds in a polyene chain, represents the major contribution to the magnitude of Eg. When the quinoid state prevails in the ground states, more carbon–carbon double bonds will be presented in the two adjacent rings, which consequently decrease the BLA. The generally decreased BLA are expected to narrow the Eg of a conjugated polymer, whose contribution can be quantified as EBLA.
Secondly, the energy needed to transform from the aromatic structure to the quinoid structure (Eres), which directly depends on the aromatic stabilization resonance energy of the aromatic unit,42 is another composition of Eg. Outcome of this stabilization resonance is confining the π electrons within the aromatic ring and thus preventing their delocalization along the conjugated main chain. Hence, diluting such a stabilization effect is critical to narrow the bandgap, Eg.
Thirdly, the contribution Esub is from the introduction of the electron donating units and the electron withdrawing units into the conjugated main chain, which is the most straightforward way to adjust the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and consequently Eg.
Fourthly, the rotational disorder around inter-annular single bonds represents another character of polyaromatic systems.43 A mean dihedral angle “θ” between the consecutive units deterring the delocalization of π electrons along the conjugated backbone will increase the bandgap by Eθ.
The last component involved in Eg of conjugated polymers is the intermolecular interactions, Eint, which correlates with charge transfer between adjacent backbones by the hopping model.
Thus, Eg of a π conjugated system is expressed as: Eg = EBLA + Eres + Esub + Eθ + Eint, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Structural factors affect the bandgap of polyaromatic systems, where EBLA is the energy changed by increasing or decreasing the bond length alternation, Esub is the electron changed by introducing electron donating or withdrawing units, Eres is the energy needed to transform from the aromatic structure to the quinoid structure, Eθ is the energy from the rotational disorder around the inter-annular sing bonds and Eint is the energy from the intermolecular interactions. 
In the next subsection, examples of developing efficient LBG semiconducting polymers according to the above five structural factors will be illustrated.
2.3. Fused heterocycles
The fused heterocycles, formed by fusing a quinoid ring with an aromatic ring while placing the former along the polymer main chain, represents an important branch of building blocks to construct LBG semiconducting polymers. This is an effective approach to simultaneously decrease the BLA and dilute the aromatic stabilization. The most well-known examples were displayed by polythiophene (P1) and polyisothianaphthene (PITN, P2), as shown in Fig. 4.44 The former has a relatively small bandgap of 2.0 eV due to the quinoid form of thiophene units. But thanks to the much higher aromaticity of the benzene ring (1.56 eV) than that of the thiophene ring (1.26 eV), the main chain of P2 would favor the quinoid form to selectively maintain the benzene aromaticity, which, as a result, effectively narrows the band gap of P2 as low as 1 eV. The promising results have inspired the development of fused rings such as thienothiophene (TT), benzodithiophene (BDT), carbazole, dithieno-silole, etc., which also possess stabilized quinoid structures. They turned out to be efficient building blocks for the synthesis of LBG semiconducting polymers.

2.4. Bridging effects
To enhance the planarization between adjacent aromatic rings, aiming to parallel the p-orbital interactions to extend conjugation and promote the π electron delocalization, plays an important role in the design of efficient LBG semiconducting polymers. To join and rigidify two adjacent aromatic units through covalent bonds would be an effective way to impose the steric hindrance, which can overcome the above-mentioned Eθ and decrease the BLA simultaneously, and consequently narrowed Eg. Applications of such an approach were featured by bithienyl and its derivatives. Through the sp3 carbon bridging with the ketal group, a rigid bithienyl polymer (P3) was produced (in Fig. 5),45 with a remarkably lower Eg of 1.2 eV than its parent open-chain compound (P1).45 Further extended conjugation was realized by fusing the adjacent two thiophene rings with cyclopentene (P4), resulting in enhanced planarization and thus decreased Eg to 1.1 eV.46
 Fig. 5  Examples of bridging effects between thiophene rings (P3, P4 and P6) and phenyl rings (P5). 
The influence of atoms that bridge the two aromatic rings was further conducted. P547 and P648–53 as shown in Fig. 5 are two typical examples, which are represented by C, Si and Ge elements fusing in biphenyl and bithienyl systems, respectively. It's also found that adjacent rings bridged by Si or Ge generate more ordered structures of polymer chains than their C analogs, on account of the longer covalent bond and possible orbital interactions of Si or Ge with two rigidified aromatic rings.
2.5 Electron-withdrawing effects
Attaching electron-donating and electron-withdrawing side chains onto the polymer main chains represents the most straightforward method for tuning the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of LBG semiconducting polymers. Such studies are initiated by Bredas and Heeger in 1994, when they investigated the influence of substituents on the energy levels of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV).54 It was observed that both the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups can reduce the bandgap of conjugated polymers to some extent. The electron-donating groups shift the energy levels upward with the HOMO energy level up-shifted more than the LUMO level, while the electron-withdrawing groups shift the energy levels downward with the LUMO energy level down-shifted more than the HOMO level. Therefore, the electron-withdrawing substituents are usually selected to narrow the bandgap of polymers while maintaining a high VOC of PSCs thanks to the down-shifted HOMO levels.
Hou et al. reported the tuned energy levels of conjugated copolymer PBDTTTs composed of BDT and TT units.21 By substituting the ester group on the TT unit in P7 with a stronger electron-withdrawing ketone group in P8 (Fig. 6a), both LUMO and HOMO energy levels were dropped by 0.11 eV (Fig. 6b). When incorporating with an even stronger electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group on the TT unit (P9),55 the LUMO energy level was further lowered by 0.14 eV, leading to decreased Eg. Even though the resulting Eg of P8 (1.65 eV) was not ideal, it laid a solid foundation for the future development of LBG semiconducting polymers.

2.6. Alternating D–A units
Regularly alternating the D unit with the A unit along the polymer backbone is one of the most potent stratagems in designing LBG semiconducting polymers. The driving forces between the D and A components (in Fig. 7a) facilitate the π electron delocalization and quinoid mesomeric structure formation along the polymer main chain, leading to decreased BLA and thus Eg.41 In addition, photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in D–A copolymers, which is correlated with the HOMO energy level of D and the LUMO energy level of A, would also be involved in the reduced Eg. This process can be elucidated by Fig. 7b. Interactions between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of D and A units will be occurred, generating two new HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the D–A copolymer. After the electrons had redistributed to the hybridized molecular orbitals, a higher-lying HOMO energy level and a lower-lying LUMO energy level will be formed, thus resulting in the decreased Eopt and broadened optical spectra.56,57 Therefore, the HOMO energy level of the D–A copolymer majorly dominated by the D component, and the LUMO energy level mainly depends on the A component, which enables the facile tuning of the energy levels of D–A copolymers by selecting proper units. It's also notable that the magnitude of Eg reduction is strongly dependent on the strength of the electron donating and electron accepting properties. Representative D and A units with strong electron donating and electron withdrawing abilities, respectively, are exhibited in Fig. 7c.

In the next section, LBG semiconducting polymers composed of these D and A units will be introduced in detail.
2.7. Two-dimensional effect
As described above, the intramolecular charge transfer along the polymer backbones is directly correlated with the energy levels of semiconducting polymers, which is promoted via the adoption of D–A structures. Another factor, of critical importance for the hole mobility of LBG semiconducting polymers, is the intermolecular charge transfer, which occurs by the hopping model through the overlapped π electrons between the adjacent backbones.58 In order to form increased π–π overlaps, the two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers are designed.
In 2006, Hou et al. reported the optical and electronic properties of 2D polythiophenes (Fig. 8), and found that the absorbance in the lower wavelength range can be effectively enhanced due to the conjugation of the side chains, thus broadening the absorption plateau in the visible region.59 In addition, the higher conjugated side chains would also induce better planarity of the polymer backbones and enhance the π–π interactions, which is crucial for an efficient intermolecular charge transport and thus a high hole mobility. It's notable that a packed backbone stacking would also be one of the pleasant outcomes of the 2D structures, leading to red-shifted absorption spectra and a consequently decreased Eg. Therefore, the 2D structures would be an important design strategy in developing LBG semiconducting polymers with outstanding hole mobility and optical properties.

In summary, this section sums up the five classical design strategies for developing efficient LBG semiconducting polymers. In the following sections, the applications of these designs in both PSCs and PPDs will be evaluated, which will not only offer valuable feedback to the existing stratagems, but also provide fresh and novel ideas for the future construction of high performance LBG semiconducting polymers.
3. LBG semiconducting polymers for PSCs
The research fields of PSCs have experienced blossom by LBG semiconducting polymers in the last few decades. Design principles for efficient LBG semiconducting polymers have been thoroughly introduced in the previous section, which primarily aims to broaden the optical spectra of polymers to match the solar spectrum, lower the HOMO energy level of polymers to maintain a high VOC, and optimizing polymer backbone stacking to improve the hole mobility. Among all the design concepts presented, regularly alternation in D–A units proves to be the most basic approach, based on which, majority of high performance LBG semiconducting polymers for PSCs were constructed in recent years. In this section, the D–A LBG semiconducting polymers, as well as their applications in PSCs will be overviewed, in accordance with the three efficient electron-donating units as shown in Fig. 7c.
3.1. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene based LGB semiconducting polymers

3.1.1. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene based copolymers. 
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely used as the electron-donating unit in the construction of high performance LBG semiconducting polymers,59 because BDT, as a weak donor, would maintain a low-lying HOMO energy level of the resulting polymers, which ensures a high VOC for PSCs, and its structural symmetry and the rigid fused aromatic system could enhance the electron delocalization and interchain π–π interaction to improve the hole mobility. As a result, the combinations of BDT with other strong electron-withdrawing substituents, such as thienothiophene, thienopyrroledione, benzothiadiazole, etc. affords varieties of high performance LBG semiconducting polymers.
The most intensive applications of the BDT moiety are implemented through combination with fused thienothiophene rings, another promising building block for construction of LBG semiconducting polymers since it can support the quinoidal structure, which is crucial to narrow Eg. However, thienothiophene is a very electron-rich moiety, which is adverse to the stability during synthesis. So an electron-withdrawing ester group is introduced to form the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) unit, for stabilizing the resulting polymers. In 2009, Yu et al. reported the first BDT–TT conjugated LBG semiconducting polymer, PTB1 (P12),60 which started the great progress of LBG semiconducting polymers. Due to the broad optical spectra and appropriate chain stacking of P12, PSCs based on P12:PC71BM BHJ composites showed a promising PCE of 4.76%, with a high JSC and FF.61 However, the small VOC (0.58 V) attributed to the high-lying HOMO energy level shows the urgency for fine-tuning the energy levels of P12, which stimulate the synthesis of the PTB series polymers (P12–P17) with various side chains.61 By substituting the alkoxy group with the less electron-donating alkyl group, the HOMO energy level is significantly lowered by 0.14 eV, with a slightly enlarged Eg to 1.60 eV, which leads to an optimized device performance with a high VOC of 0.74 V and a PCE of 5.53%. Hou et al. further down-shifted both LUMO and HOMO energy levels by replacing the ester group in the TT unit with the ketone group, leading to a resulting polymer PBDTTT-C (P8)62 with a small Eg of 1.57 eV. Decent device performance was observed from PSCs based on P8:PC71BM BHJ composites, including a large VOC (0.70 V), JSC (14.70 mA cm−2) and thus a PCE of 6.58%. In addition, it's observed from P1561 that fluorine can be a good candidate to functionalize the 3-position in the fused ring, not only due to its high electronegativity, but also due to its small size for preventing the introduction of steric hindrance in the polymer chains. Therefore, Yu et al. introduced fluorine into P8 to form P18,63 which showed a deep-lying HOMO energy level of −5.22 eV. As a result, an increased VOC of 0.76 V was obtained from PSCs based on P18, with a certified PCE of 6.7%. Later, Yu et al. further synthesized the star polymer PTB7 (P19) among the PTB family,64 by introducing fluorine into the TT moiety. The HOMO energy level was lowered to −5.15 eV compared with other non-fluorinated PTB polymers, by simultaneously down-shifting the LUMO energy level, which resulted in a small Eg of 1.68 eV. Over 7% PCE (VOC = 0.74 eV, JSC = 14.50 mA cm−2, FF = 68.97%, and PCE = 7.40%) was observed from PTB7:PC71BM PSCs with a conventional device structure, which demonstrated a breakthrough for the development of LBG semiconducting polymers.
In order to break 10% PCE from single junction PSCs, tremendous efforts, such as device architecture design,65,66 interfacial re-engineering,67–69 thin film morphological control,70–73 have been paid to advance the performance of PSCs based on the BDT–TT conjugated polymers in recent years. Cao et al. demonstrated a PCE of 9.2% from an inverted PSCs fabricated by PTB7:PC71BM composites as the BHJ active layer and a water/alcohol soluble conjugated polyelectrolyte, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as the ITO surface modifier.74 However, it was found that further boosting the PCE is difficult due to the limitation of intrinsic properties of polymers themselves. So in the later context, materials science regarding the introduction of 2D structures into these BDT–TT copolymers will be illustrated, combined with the enhanced photovoltaic properties induced by 2D structures.


3.1.2 Other benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene based copolymers. 
The 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BT) unit is another efficient electron acceptor building block for constructing LBG D–A copolymers. Its strong electron-withdrawing property delivers a deep-lying HOMO energy level (−5.40 eV) of the BDT–BT conjugated polymer (P20),75,76 which results in a large VOC of 0.80 V. By introducing fluorine atoms into the electron-acceptor BT unit, the HOMO energy level is further lowered to −5.48 eV for P21 and −5.53 eV for P22, along with increasing fluorine numbers. This observation is in good agreement with the previous discussion. PSCs based on P22:PC61BM BHJ composites exhibited a large VOC of 0.90 V and a decent PCE of 7.3%. Fusing two BT rings affords another important electron-withdrawing unit naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (NT), which has a better planarity and more delocalized π electrons than the BT parent. By combining BDT with NT, Cao et al. synthesized a new polymer PBDT-DTNT (P24).77 Compared with its PBDT-DTBT counterpart (P23), P24 exhibited pronounced a redshifted absorption spectrum and higher hole mobility, while maintaining suitable energy levels for a reasonable VOC and efficient charge separation between the polymer and PC61BM, as a consequence, a high PCE of 6% was obtained.77 Later, we improved the efficiency over 8.4% by reengineering the ZnO interfacial layer in the inverted PSCs,78 and recently further noticed that PCE still preserves over 7% when the thickness of the P24 aggrandized over 1 μm.79 Such exciting results, which is originated from the high hole mobility and favorable polymer chain stacking, promotes the industrialization of PSCs with a thick BHJ active layer.
BDT-based LBG copolymers by combining with other building blocks were also shown in Fig. 9. Due to the efficient electron-withdrawing properties of the thienopyrroledione (TPD),80 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)81,82 and benzooxadiazole (BOD) groups,83 all the D–A copolymers show low-lying HOMO energy levels (−5.10 to −5.40 eV), which result in high VOC of PSCs based on these electron-donor polymers. Their photovoltaics performances are summarized in Table 1.

3.1.3. Two-dimensional polymers. 
The concept of 2D structures has been introduced in the previous section. 2D structures can effectively broaden the optical spectra and facilitate the planar stacking in polythiophene systems. Motivated by the previous promising results, Hou et al. applied a 2D structure in PBDTTT systems in 2011.84 By replacing the alkoxyl group on the BDT unit (P8) with the 2-alkylthienyl group, a 2D polymer, P28,84 was developed. Attributed to the extended conjugation of alkylthienyl side chains, P28 possessed better planarity for the intermolecular π–π interactions, which dramatically enlarged the hole mobility from 5.53 × 10−4 to 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to their 1D analogues, based on the spaced charge limited current measurement (SCLC). It's also found that the optical spectra of 2D polymers red-shifted, resulting in slightly decreased Eg. A high PCE of 7.59% was then observed from the PSCs based on P28:PC71BM blends, with both large VOC (0.74 V) and JSC (17.48 mA cm−2). These results suggested that BDT can be a promising parent building block for constructing 2D copolymers, and the photovoltaic properties of the BDT-based polymers can be significantly improved by adding the conjugated side groups onto the BDT units.
Later on, our group applied the same substitutions to the star polymer PTB7, obtaining 2D polymer PTB7-DT (P29).26,27 Similar to 2D PBDTTT series polymers, PTB7-DT showed triply enhanced hole mobility than its 1D counterpart, which would contribute to both JSC and FF of the PTB7-based PSCs. We also observed greatly dropped HOMO and LUMO energy levels by 0.34 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively, with Eg being decreased by ∼0.1 eV, which is contradictory to the previous statement that electron-donating groups (2-alkylthienyl) up-shift both HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In order to verify the above observation, the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of PTB7 and PTB7-DT were calculated by the first principles calculations to explore the origins for this phenomenon. The results are shown in Fig. 11.27 It's observed that 2D structures favor the delocalization of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels dispersing along both the backbone and its vertical directions, which is responsible for the down-shifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels. This novel 2D polymer possesses excellent photovoltaic properties, with over 10% PCE from single junction conventional PSCs based on the PTB7-DT:PC71BM BHJ composite.27
Latest reports by Li et al. revealed that different substituents attached on the conjugated thiophene side chains in 2D BDT–TT polymers would impose significant difference in the optical and electronic properties of the resulting polymers.85 It's well known that the alkoxy substitution of alkyl is adverse to VOC, since the higher electron-donating alkoxy would up-shift the HOMO energy level. Therefore, P30 has a much higher HOMO energy level of −5.18 eV than that of P29, resulting in a smaller VOC of 0.73 V. The sulfur atom, on the other hand, has a weaker electron-donating ability than that of oxygen. Moreover, the sulfur atom has some π-acceptor capability due to the formation of Pπ(C)–dπ(S) orbital overlap where divalent sulfur accepts π-electron from the p-orbital of the carbon–carbon double bond into its empty 3d-orbitals.86 These show that the polymer containing alkylthio substituents (P31) possesses deep-lying HOMO energy level (−5.40 eV) with a small Eg (1.57 eV), which renders the largest VOC (0.84 V) among the BDT–TT conjugated polymers and an outstanding PCE (8.42%).85 Further enhanced PCE was reported for a similar polymer (P32) immediately.87 The only difference was changing the branched alkylthio into linear chains, which achieved higher ordered intermolecular stacking and thus better charge transport properties. The JSC value was obviously enhanced from 15 mA cm−2 to 17 mA cm−2, resulting in a high PCE of 9.48%.
2D copolymers based on BDT conjugated with other electron-withdrawing substituents were also reported. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 10 (P36 to P38) together with their 1D analogues (P33 to P35),88–91 and their photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 2. It's observed that 2D copolymers possess an overall superior device performance than their 1D analogue, which originates from the enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions, down-shifted HOMO energy levels, strengthened absorbance and broadened absorption spectra.

3.2. Dithiophene based LBG semiconducting polymers
Another important electron donor family for constructing D–A copolymers is the dithiophene unit. Due to the strong electron-delocalization ability, dithiophene exhibits intensive molecular orbital hybridization with electron acceptors, which effectively narrows the bandgap of the resulting D–A copolymers. In addition, the five-number thiophene rings have less steric hindrance with the neighboring blocks than their six-number benzene analogue, which is beneficial for a high planarity of the produced D–A system.92 Bridging with different atoms C, Si, and N affords three dithiophene units, cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), dithienosilole (DTS) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP), respectively. As we have introduced in the previous section, bridging effects would further enhance the planarity of the resulting D–A copolymers, and thus delocalize the π electrons. As a result, the D–A copolymers based on the three dithiophene units are expected to possess narrow bandgaps and high hole mobilities.
By combining CPDT with the efficient electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole (BT) unit, Brabec et al. reported PCPDTBT (P39),93 the first LBG semiconducting polymer based on the dithiophene unit. As expected, P39 exhibited a narrow bandgap of 1.40 eV with the absorption spectrum extending to 900 nm. But due to the unoptimized BHJ film morphology, the PCE of the resulting P39-based PSCs was limited to 3.2%.93 Later on, by tuning the thin film morphology of P39:PC71BM BHJ composites with high-boiling point solvent additive alkane dithiols, Bazan et al. pushed the PSCs efficiency to 5.5%,94 with a high JSC of 16 mA cm−2 corresponding to the broad absorption spectrum of P39. In recent years, over 6% PCEs have been achieved by further optimization of the P39-based PSCs,95 reaching the calculated PCE according to the model reported by Scharber et al.96 In 2008, Scherf et al. synthesized two novel polymers PCPDTTBTT (P40), and PCPDTQ (P41), via the incorporation of a thiophene ring between the CPDT and BT units, and the combination of CPDT with another electron-withdrawing substituent dioctylquinoxaline, respectively.97 Both P40 and P41 have similar bandgaps and comparable hole mobilities with those of P39, predicting them as promising candidates in the photovoltaic applications. However, the resulting inferior performances were likely attributed to the unfavorable phase separation in the polymer:PC71BM BHJ composites.97 In 2012, Jen98 and Neher et al.99 introduced fluorine onto the BT substituent of P39, creating the novel polymer PCPDTFBT (P42). Thanks to the down-shifted HOMO energy level and better π–π stacking of the polymer backbones induced by the fluorine atom, P42 based PSCs shows enlarged VOC, JSC and FF. As a result, PCE is dramatically enhanced from 5.5%98 and 6.2%,99 without and with the utilization of solvent additives, respectively.
In contrast to the C–C bond, the C–Si bond is significantly longer, which endows the DTS less steric hindrance from the bulky alkyl groups and thus a better planarity than the CPDT unit. In addition, the interaction between the σ*-orbital of Si and the π*-orbital of dithiophene gives rise to a low-lying LUMO energy level, which could contribute to the narrow bandgaps of DTS-based conjugated copolymers. Hou et al. reported the first DTS–BT conjugated copolymer PSBTBT (P43) in 2008.100 The Si-bridged polymer has a similar bandgap (1.45 eV) with that of C-bridged counterparts, but with a three times higher hole mobility (1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) over that of P39 (3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which leads to a remarkably improved photovoltaic efficiency of 5.1% without solvent additives.100 Both enhanced JSC and FF confirms the better planar structure induced by the Si atom. By alternating the DTS unit with another electron-withdrawing unit N-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), Tao et al. synthesized the polymer PDTSTPD (P44),101 which possesses a HOMO energy level as low as −5.57 eV and a bandgap of 1.7 eV. Such a deep HOMO energy level and a broad optical spectrum generate a high PCE of 7.3%, with the assistance of solvent additives.
A series of other DTS-containing D–A copolymers, including P45, P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50 (Fig. 12) with the electron acceptor units of benzoxadiazole (BO), thiazolothiazole (TTz), naphthathiophene-dione (NTDO) and benzotriazole (BTA), respectively, were developed. Table 3 summarizes the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of the D–A copolymers. Among them, P45102 shows the deepest-lying HOMO energy level of −5.5 eV, which, however, didn't contribute to a high VOC because of the non-optimized phase separation in the P45:fullerene derivative composites. In contrast, the low-lying HOMO energy level (−5.4 eV) of PDTSNTDO (P46),103 which is attributed to the two strong electron-withdrawing ketal groups attached on the NTDO unit, generates a large VOC of 0.88 V, and thus a high PCE of 5.2%.103 Owing to the excellent planar structure of the TTz unit for highly compact π–π interactions, TTz-containing D–A copolymers possess distinguished hole mobilities. Therefore, P47 has a high hole mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.104 By removing the hexyl side chain from the 3-position in P47 to the 4-position of the thiophene units in P48,105 the hole mobility was further enhanced to 7.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the absorption was red-shifted due to less steric hindrance in P48.105 Replacing the sulfur atom in the BT unit affords the BTA unit, which can provide additional advantage of incorporating solubilizing alkyl chains directly onto the acceptor unit, rather than on the thiophene rings of the polymer. A more planar conformation of the polymer backbones would be resulted from this unique distribution of the alkyl chains, which benefits for the closely packing of the polymer chains and thus promote the hole mobility. Along these lines, DTS–BTA conjugated copolymers P49 and P50 were reported by Li et al.105 Introduction of the thiophene rings for bridging the D and A units further improve the photovoltaic performance, in terms of higher molar absorptivity, broader absorption band, lower bandgap, higher hole mobility (1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and thus higher PCE.106

Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) is an effective electron-acceptor unit for spanning the absorption spectra of the D–A copolymers, because the electron-richer nitrogen would arouse more molecular orbital hybridization, which lowers the bandgap. Therefore, by conjugating the DTS and BT unit, polymer P51107 possesses a narrow bandgap of 1.45 eV, which leads to a high JSC of ∼12 mA cm−2. However, the high HOMO energy level induced by the strong electron-donating nitrogen gives rise to a low VOC of 0.54 V, and thus an inferior PCE. Energy levels of the DTS–BT conjugated copolymers were further tuned by incorporating an aryl (Ar) imine substituent at the bridgehead position of the DTS unit, which could systematically influence the aromatic stabilization of the consistent copolymer segments through the inductive effects from the Ar ring. In addition, the electron-deficient benzene ring can keep low-lying HOMO energy levels, which is beneficial for high VOC. By increasing the electron-withdrawing property of the substituting groups attached on the Ar ring (from P52 to P56),108 the HOMO energy level can be down-shifted as low as −5.60 V, with a narrower bandgap of 1.4 eV compared with traditional DTS–BT analogues, which shows great potential for NIR photovoltaic applications.
3.3. Thiophene/phenylene/thiophene-based LBG copolymers
Benzene fused with thiophene is another well-known structure for ideal LBG copolymers. In thiophene/phenylene/thiophene structures, parallel π-orbital interactions are able to elongate the effective conjugation length and facilitate π-electron delocalization, and thus narrow the bandgaps while ensures high hole mobilities. Meanwhile, the resulting D–A copolymers can maintain low-lying HOMO energy levels, due to the electron-deficient benzene unit. In addition, it's facile to incorporate multiple side chains into either thiophene or phenylene rings to ensure a high solubility. Ko et al. initiated the study of this promising building block in 2008, by combining indacenodithiophene (IDT) with BT units to, form two comparable polymers P57 and P58 (Fig. 13).109 Both of them have deep HOMO energy levels of −5.40 eV, and high hole mobilities up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which result in a large VOC of 0.8 V and a high PCE of 4%. Ting et al. further tuned the bandgap of P58 via the combination of IDT with a series of other electron-withdrawing units, to create P59 to P63.110 Due to different strengths of the electron-withdrawing ability of these substituents, the bandgaps were ranged from 1.8 eV for P59 to 1.0 eV for P63, expanding the absorption spectra over 1200 nm,110 which also express great potential for NIR PPDs. In addition, P59 and P60 also possess deep HOMO energy levels, large absorption coefficients and high hole mobilities (over 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which bring about PCEs over 4%.110 In 2011, Ting further improved the structure of P58 by directly binding the IDT with BT units, forming a new polymer P64,111 which circumvents randomly distributed D (A) moieties and forms well-defined structures. The resulting polymer shows a deeper HOMO energy level and a higher hole mobility than its random analogues, which give rise to a high PCE of 6.1%.111 Later, Jen et al. effectively lower the bandgap of IDT-based copolymers by combining the IDT unit with two electron-deficient units dithienobenzoquinoxaline and dithienobenzopyridopyrazine, resulting in P65 and P66, respectively.112 Narrow bandgaps of 1.61 eV and 1.48 eV were obtained by P65 and P66, respectively, with dramatically enhanced hole mobilities over 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 112) compared with previously reported IDT-BT counterparts. The promising results originate from the better planarity and higher rigidity of the dithienobenzoquinoxaline and dithienobenzopyridopyrazine substituents, which are advantageous for delocalized π electrons and stronger intermolecular interactions. As a result, the PCE of PSCs based on P65 reached 6.06% (Table 4).112

By substituting the aryl unit on the IDT unit with alkyl chains, Li et al. synthesized a variety of new polymers P67 to P70, via the combination with different acceptor units including BTz, TTz, bis(thiophen-2-yl)-tetrazine (TZ), and DTBT.113 Benefited from the substituted alkyl chains, these polymers possess higher solubilities than their aryl substituted IDT-based counterparts and also deeper HOMO energy levels (−5.20 eV). Among them, P61 exhibits the lowest bandgap of 1.68 eV due to the strongest electron-withdrawing property of the BT unit, which results in a large JSC of 13.27 mA cm−2 and a high VOC of 0.82 V in PSCs.113
4. LBG semiconducting polymers for PPDs
Sensing from UV to NIR is critical for many industrial and scientific applications, including optical communications, remote control, day/night surveillance, chemical/biological sensing, etc.114–116 Inorganic PDs that have been well developed and commercialized can only cover limited sub-bands. Realizing the broadband PDs sensing from UV, visible to NIR by inorganic materials is difficult due to the great challenge for tuning the optical spectra of the inorganic materials.117 In addition, the complicated fabrication process and required working conditions (e.g. low temperature)30 for the inorganic PDs also limit its applications. To approach the facile-processed broadband PDs, low bandgap inorganic quantum dots (QDs) were then emerged. Thanks to the quantum confinement effects, the bandgaps of inorganic QDs can be easily tuned from 1.6 eV to 0.5 eV, covering the optical spectra from 300 nm to 2500 nm.118–120 However, the inorganic QD PDs were fabricated using the “in-plane” structure (two electrodes and the inorganic QD semiconductor all in one plane) with the electrode spacing >5 mm, which inevitably leads to high driving voltages (>80 V)18 and slow responses.121 These limitations motivate the development of organic material based-PDs, which outperforms their inorganic analogues due to the cost-effective materials, facile-processing methods and easily tunable bandgaps. Fabricated in two-terminal diode structures, the polymer:PCBM BHJ composites generally achieve large quantum yield, high response speed and low driving voltages that are required for efficient PDs (Fig. 14).

Sharing common features with PSCs, the PPDs based on the two-terminal diode structure can also be optimized through new material development, film morphological control, interfacial reengineering, etc. In the next section, how these factors influence the performance of PPDs will be illustrated from the perspective of fundamental physics of PDs.
4.1. Characterization of PPDs
The operational mechanism of the BHJ PPDs is the same to the BHJ PSCs, which we have presented in the previous section. Through the exciton generation at the D/A interfaces, followed by the transportation and extraction of the separated electrons and holes to the respective electrode, photocurrent will be generated in the PDs, which contribute to one of the important parameters of PDs, the responsivity (R).33R is the ratio of photocurrent to the incident-light intensity: R = Jph/Llight(1)where Jph is the photocurrent and Llight is the incident light intensity.
Noise equivalent power (NEP)33 is another important parameter for characterizing the PDs, which is described as the minimum impinging optical power that a PD can distinguish from the noise: NEP = (AΔf)1/2/D*(2)where A is the effective area of the PD in cm2, Δf is the electrical bandwidth in Hz, and D* is the detectivity measured in units of Jones. D* is given by33 D* = (AΔf)1/2R/in(3)
There are three contributions to the noise which limits D*: shot noise from the dark current, Johnson noise and thermal fluctuation “flicker” noise.63,64 If, as expected, D* is majorly contributed by the shot noise from the dark current, then D* can be expressed as (4)where q is the absolute value of electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 Coulombs), and Jd is the dark current density.
Another figure of merit linear dynamic range (LDR) or photosensitivity linearity (quoted in dB) is given by:33 LDR = 20log(Jph*/Jd)(5)where Jph* is the photocurrent measured at the light intensity of 1 mW cm−2. It indicates that within a certain range, the photocurrent has a linear response as the incident light intensity changes. This is important because beyond this range the intensity of the light signal cannot be detected and calculated precisely.
The last parameter evaluating a PD is the response time. It's critical for practical applications including remote control/sensing, fiberoptic communications, etc., where high-speed signal detecting is required. The response time of PPDs is mainly determined by the mobilities of the BHJ systems. The average carrier transporting distance is estimated to be d/2 in the thin film, where d is the thin film thickness. The average carrier transport velocity can be illustrated by:121 (6)where μ is the charge carrier mobility and Vint is the internal field.
As a result, the transient time for the charge carrier transport through the thin film, i.e. the response time of the PDs should be illustrated as122 (7) It can be deduced from eqn (1) to (5) that in order to obtain a high performance (large R and LDR, low NEP), high photocurrents and low dark currents should be ensured. High absorptivity and hole mobility are the determinant factors for large photocurrents, while film morphological control and interface engineering are of critical importance for suppressing the dark currents. From eqn (7), it's observed that for approaching a fast photo-response, the BHJ system should have both high mobilities and an acceptable Vint. Therefore, from the perspective of donor polymer design, a high hole mobility and low-lying HOMO energy level are desired.
4.2. Development of PPDs
In 2007, Yan et al. reported the first NIR PPDs utilizing the LBG polymer P71,123 a derivative of polythienothiophene. The incorporated electron-withdrawing ester group on the TT unit stabilized the electron-rich TT units and lowered the HOMO energy level of the polymer. Therefore, the energy level offset between the HOMO energy level of the electron donor and the LUMO energy level of the electron acceptor will be increased, contributing to an enhanced Vint of the P71:PC61BM BHJ system, and thus a faster photo-response of PPDs according to eqn (7). In addition, the tertiary alkyl side chains from the ester group increase the solubility of the polymer, which facilitate the formation of BHJ interpenetrating networks. With a narrow bandgap of 1.2 eV, the absorption spectrum of P71 extends to 1100 nm. As a result, broad spectral responsivity (400 nm to 1000 nm) was obtained by P71:PC61BM based PPDs, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 40% at −5V. The response time is measured to be ∼100 ns, which is primarily limited by the hole mobility of P71 (∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). In the same year, Andersson et al. synthesized a D–A structured polymer P72,124 a derivative of LBG polymer P73125 that had been widely applied in NIR photovoltaics. However, P73 has a low-lying LUMO energy level, which indicates the driving force offered by the LUMO energy offset between the polymer and PC61BM is insufficient for exciton dissociation. In order to circumvent this issue, a stronger electron donating unit dialkoxy-phenylene is introduced to replace dialkyl-fluorene, which, as a result, up-shifted the LUMO energy level and increase the photocurrent. Bearing a bandgap of 1 eV, P72 pushed the photo-spectral of the PPDs up to 1200 nm.
Inspired by these pioneering studies, a series of other LBG polymers were developed to expedite the progress of NIR photodetection, including P74–P79,33,126–128 and those have been well-studied in PSCs.129,130 Among them, the most outstanding one that features broad spectra, high responsivity and detectivity was P74.33 The introduction of the electron-withdrawing unit thienopyrazine (TP) stabilizes the electron-rich thiophene chain and facilitates the charge transfer along the backbone. Thus bandgap as low as 0.8 eV was achieved, which contributes to the broad photoresponse from 400 nm to 1450 nm, as shown in Fig. 15a. From the band alignment shown in Fig. 15b, it's observed that P74 possesses a matched LUMO energy level with that of PC61BM, which ensures efficient exciton dissociation. However, the high-lying HOMO energy level that inevitably resulted from such a narrow bandgap leads to a small built-in potential (related to the energy offset between the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the LUMO energy level of PC61BM) which is insufficient to effectively sweep out the free carriers, as a result, marginal EQE values were showed under the bias close to zero voltage. However, it's observed from Fig. 15a that just a small external bias (−0.5 V) generates significantly increased EQE and thus the photoresponsivity of 0.17 A W−1 in the NIR region.

As mentioned above, by tuning the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituents in P58, P61–P63 with low bandgaps of 1.0–1.2 eV are created,110 exhibiting expanded absorption spectra over 1200 nm and showing great potential for broadband PPDs. Even though inferior efficiencies are exhibited by PSCs based on P61–P63, the wide EQE spectra enable the photo-detection from the visible to the NIR region. Under low reverse bias, decent responsivity and detectivity would be expected. Along with such design rules, Qi et al. synthesized a series of LBG polymers by incorporating one weak donor unit (thiophene) and two strong acceptor units (DPP and thienoisoindigo (TIIG)), where the energy levels and thus the absorption range of the polymers can be facilely adjusted by tuning the ratio of two acceptor units.131 Going from P80 to P84, the detectivity decreases, while the response range increases. And the PPDs based on P83 exhibits detectivity of greater than 1011 Jones in a broad spectral region from 300 to 1200 nm under reverse bias. These results demonstrate that these novel polymers are promising candidates to fabricate PPDs to detect the UV to NIR light.
But it's notable that for approaching high detectivities under reverse bias, suppressing the dark current is crucial according to eqn (4). There are several possible origins of the dark current at reverse bias, including topological defects, thermionic or tunneling generation in the bulk of the active layer or at the contact interfaces, thermal generation at the D/A interface via ground state charge transfer, extrinsic doping of the active layer via oxygen or humidity and non-desired charge injection through the electrode, among which, the latter has been ascribed to the major root cause of the dark generation. For circumventing such undesired current injection, two effective solutions were reported: introducing an energeticy barrier at the electrode for avoiding the parasitic injection of electrons/holes from the electrodes; and fine-tuning the thin film morphology of the active layer for preventing the short circuits.
The first successful example of electrode interfacial re-engineering was demonstrated in Gong's work,33 where poly[3-3′(vinylcarbazole)] (PVK) or polystyrene-N,N-diphenyl-N,N-bis(4-n-butylphenyl)-(1,10-biphenyl)-4,4-diamine-perfluorocyclobutane (PS-TPD-PFCB) was introduced as the ITO modifiers and C60 as the cathode modifier. From Fig. 15c, the high-lying LUMO energy levels of PVK and PS-TPD-PFCB can energetically prevent the electrons transferring to the ITO anode, while the deep-lying HOMO energy level of C60 effectively blocks holes migrating to the Al cathode. As a result, low dark current densities were obtained in the reverse bias region, with detectivities over 1012 Jones in the broad wavelength range. Other studies conducted for lowering the dark current through interfacial reengineering were performed, including using PFN127 and poly[9,9-bis(6′-(N,N-diethylamino)propyl)-fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)-hexyl) fluorene] (PFN-OX)132 as the ITO cathode modifier and the Al cathode modifier, respectively, polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE),129 CdTe133 as the ITO anode interfacial layers, etc. Attributed to the introduced energetically barrier for blocking the charge injection from the electrode, PPDs with these interfacial layers exhibited tremendously suppressed dark current under reverse bias and thus high detectivities.
Aside from interfacial engineering, Greenham et al. reported that film thickness and thin film morphology are also the dominating factors that influence the dark currents.134 It was observed that thicker films prevent charge injection and current leakage, which thus suppress the dark current. However, thicker films would inevitably lead to unfavorable charge transfer within the active layer, which decrease the EQE values and thus sacrifice the detectivities. Since dark current is the consequence of the electron injection from the device contact to the active layer, which takes place from the anode (cathode) electrode to the donor (acceptor) component of the thin film, and current leaks through the corresponding donor (acceptor) domains, the phase morphology of the D/A domains would have dominating influences on the dark currents. It was observed that thermal annealing of the BHJ active layer at a temperature adjacent to the Tθ (phase transition temperature) increase the dark current because of the demixing of the electron donor and electron acceptor phases, which results in the formation of direct percolation pathways towards the electrodes.133 Therefore, controlling the phase separation of the BHJ active layer, aiming to achieve well-interpenetrated BHJ networks, is also of critical importance for preventing the current leakage and approaching a low dark current under reverse bias.
One representative example was exhibited by Wang et al.,135 in which thin film morphology of P74:PC61BM BHJ composites was tuned by side chain engineering. Since the low solubility of P74 in organic solvents may be the major factor that limited further reduction of the dark current of the P74-based PDs. Through side-chain engineering, solubility of the polymer, as well as the thin film morphology of the BHJ active layer would be changed. Polymers P85 to P88 (Fig. 16a) were formed along with the increment of the side chain ratio, which results in enhanced solubilities in organic solvents. As a consequence, surface roughness of the polymer:PC61BM thin film decreased from P85 to P88 (Fig. 16b), thanks to the gradually increased miscibility with PC61BM. Nearly two orders of magnitude decrement of the dark currents were thus observed, which brings about dramatically improved detectivities. Recently, Zhang adopted a similar concept by modifying the polymer structures (P89 and P91) with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) via the side chains to form the conjugated polymers (P90 and P92).136 The introduction of the EDOT unit is expected to increases the interaction between the polymer and the PEDOT layer, which gives rise to a favorable vertical phase separation and a polymer-rich layer near the PEDOT surface, thus accounting for the depressed dark current at reverse biases. As a result, PPDs based on P90 and P92, with EDOT incorporation, show three orders of magnitude decrease in Jd (from ∼10−6 A cm−2 to 10−9 A cm−2) and two orders of magnitude enhanced rectification ratio (from 104–106) under the reverse bias, as compared to PPDs without EDOT modification, demonstrating over 1012 Jones in a wide spectral region of 350 to 850 nm (Fig. 17).

5. Conclusions and outlook
LBG semiconducting polymers play important roles in both polymer solar cells for fully exploiting the sun irradiation and in polymer photodetectors for realizing broadband photodetection. For the molecular design of LBG semiconducting polymers, the molar absorptivity, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels, charge carrier mobility and solubility in organic solvent are the key factors that need to be noticed. Understanding the influence of structural factors on the photophysical properties of LBG semiconducting polymers, five design strategies have been proven to be effective in meeting the requirements, including fused heterocycles for facilitating π-electron flowing along the polymer backbone, groups/atoms bridging adjacent rings for maintaining a high planarity, introduction of electron-withdrawing units for lowering Eg while enhancing VOC, D–A copolymerization for narrowing Eg and 2D conjugation for broadened absorption and enhanced hole mobility. One of the prime design strategies for the current successful molecular structures lies in the D–A system construction, where the combination of D and A units should be properly selected. Since aside from Eg of the polymer, the relative strength of the D and A units in the conjugated system would also impose significant effects on the absorption coefficient of the ICT band, and the electron distribution in the conjugated system, which thus determines the charge transport properties of the polymers. From this review, it can be noticed that the widely employed D units in high performance D–A polymers, including BDT, CPDT, DTS and IDT, are all designed by hybridizing electron-rich aromatic rings into fused structures for combining the intrinsic advantages from the individual aromatic rings, as well as enhancing the planarity and rigidity of the D units. One of the remarkable advantages of the highly planar structure is the formation of the “face-on” orientation of the polymer, which benefits the π conjugation in the vertical-structured solar cells. Such a design strategy for the D units has become mature and straight-forward during the past few years. Along with the design rules, further development of novel and efficient D units should be realized. The development of A units, however, would be more critical and tricky. While we are looking for strong electron-withdrawing units to increase the π electron delocalization, too strong electron-deficient property, on the other hand, results in deep LUMO levels which hinders electron transport to the fullerene derivative acceptor and thus deteriorates the hole mobility of the polymer. The current successful A units adopt the common design strategy of fusing cyclic rings with a vertical direction to the main chain axis. For the future development of A units, electron affinity of the fused cycles needs to be cautiously considered, which should ensure a suitable LUMO level for both efficient ICT transition and charge transfer.
For PPDs, LBG semiconducting polymers, with facilely tunable energy levels, exhibit huge potential for realizing the multi-color photodetection with single polymers blended with fullerene derivatives, which circumvent the limited sub-bands covered by inorganic materials. Through a rational design stratagem, Eg as low as 0.8 eV has been obtained, covering a broad wavelength range from the UV to the NIR region. While the relatively low photoresponsivity arises from the low mobility of polymers and high dark current densities due to the polymer:fullerene BHJ formation, still intrinsically hindering the photodetectivity of PPDs. Such a significant limitation of polymers over the inorganic materials arises from the relatively large binding energy and disordered structure, so that most of the charge carriers in polymers are localized in a single molecule and intermolecular charge carrier transportation occurs only through the thermal-activated hopping, which severely hinders the impact ionization and photoelectric emission process. Photomultiplication effects in PDs would be an effective approach to circumvent such limitations by trapping one kind of the charge carrier (say electron or hole) in the active layer meanwhile enabling the opposite charge carrier transferring through and collected by the corresponding electrode. Doping of inorganic nanoparticles and quantum dots (QDs), including CdTe,137 PbS138 and ZnO,139 into the polymer (or polymer:fullerene) films has been intensively studied in the past, where inorganic nanoparticles (QDs) act as electron trapping sites due to the lack of electron transport pathways, and polymers provide hole transport channels. Recently, Zhang et al. applied the photomultiplication effects in the P3HT:PC61BM system, where a small amount of PC61BM is used in the system as electron traps.140 Later, they further doped P29 (PTB7-Th) in P3HT:PC61BM,141 forming a ternary BHJ system, to capture the NIR photoresponse. High EQEs were achieved in the UV-vis-NIR region under reverse biases while low dark currents can be maintained. This approach could be an important study direction for overcoming the low photoresponsivity and high dark current densities in NIR (IR) PPDs. It's worth to be applied in more LBG polymer systems and the mechanic physics needs to be further delved.
