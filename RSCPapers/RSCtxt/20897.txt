Introduction
The TW scale of the world’s ever-increasing energy demand poses a daunting challenge to replace fossil fuels with alternative sources.1 In order to overcome the geopolitical, economic and environmental problems associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels, however, alternative energy sources must be developed. Sunlight striking the earth is the largest power source currently available, and is for all intents and purposes infinite in supply.2 Solar energy is also well-distributed across the populous areas of the globe, thus matching energy supply with demand. Since it is also carbon neutral and environmentally benign, solar energy conversion represents an ideal alternative method of powering the planet.1,3,4 One current drawback of solar energy, however, is that it is diurnal and intermittent, while our energy demands are not. Thus, if the vast solar energy resource is ever to be used to supply the world's energy demand, efficient methods of storage need to be developed.
Storing solar energy in chemical bonds, generally referred to as solar fuels, would be an ideal scheme.5 One example of this approach is using solar energy to split water into H2 and O2, where the H2 could subsequently be used in a fuel cell or other energy conversion system. There are several physical requirements which must be fulfilled in order to effectively split water with sunlight using a semiconductor:
1. The electrode must be stable in contact with aqueous solutions under sometimes harsh operating conditions.
2. The conduction band and valence band must straddle the water reduction and oxidation potentials.
3. The semiconductor must absorb a substantial fraction of the incident visible light.
4. Charge carrier collection must be efficient.
In addition, in order to scale up a given technology to the global scale it should be composed of earth abundant materials. To date, no single material has fulfilled all the required conditions.6,7
Hematite
Hematite (α-Fe2O3), is a particularly attractive material for solar water splitting; iron is the fourth most abundant element in the earth's crust (oxygen is the most abundant), and iron oxide is environmentally benign.8–12 Hematite is stable in aqueous solutions, and in basic conditions often employed for water splitting. Hematite's valence band edge is substantially lower than the water oxidation potential thus making it a promising material for photo-catalyzed water oxidation.13–17 Hematite's conduction band is too low to reduce water; however this could be overcome through application of an external bias with a photovoltaic device or integration of a small bandgap water reduction system in a tandem configuration.9,18,19
Hematite has a reported band gap of 2.0–2.2 eV which allows it to absorb a substantial fraction of visible light; integration with the AM 1.5 solar spectrum produces a possible photocurrent density of 12 mA cm−2. The band gap determines the wavelengths of light that can be absorbed, but the material absorption coefficient, α, and thickness, l, determine the fraction, f, of those photons that will actually be absorbed according to Beers law: f = 1 − e−αl (neglecting reflectance). A given semiconductor material must therefore be 3/α thick in order to absorb 95% of the light at that wavelength. For hematite α = 8 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm, thus the photoelectrodes must be 0.4 μm in order to absorb 95% of light at this wavelength (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  AM 1.5 Solar spectrum (black). Also shown is the thickness of hematite required to absorb 95% of light at a given wavelength. 
Hematite therefore generally fulfils most of the requirements for solar water splitting. Attempts to utilize hematite electrodes for solar energy conversion, however, have resulted in very low energy conversion efficiencies.10,11,20 The low performance to date can be attributed to poor charge collection efficiency.
Charge collection
The charge carrier collection efficiency can be broken down into two parts: the efficiency of the minority charge carriers, holes for an n-type semiconductor, reaching the solution interface (electrode efficiency) and the efficiency of water oxidation by holes at the electrode surface (water oxidation efficiency).

Electrode efficiency. 
A very short hole diffusion length of 2–10 nm is generally claimed to be the cause of the low efficiencies. In order to test this, we prepared a series of thin film electrodes from 1–60 nm thick using atomic layer deposition, ALD (Fig. 2). ALD is a self-limiting process which deposits at most a single atomic layer per cycle by alternating pulses of a metal precursor and an oxidizer; this unique self-limiting property results in uniform films with highly controllable thicknesses.21–24 A fast surface-hole collector, [Fe(CN)6]4−, was used to isolate the electrode behaviour from the water oxidation reaction. Steady state current density, J, vs. applied voltage, V, measurements were performed.25,26Fig. 2 shows the average short circuit photocurrent density, Jsc, as a function of thickness for the thin film hematite electrodes. The Jsc initially increases with thickness, and then is essentially constant for electrodes thicker than 20 nm. The depletion width was also found to be ∼20 nm; the trend of increasing Jsc can therefore be attributed to the development of the electric field in the depletion region, which is effective at separating charge carriers and driving holes to the solution interface to be collected (drift).26 Charge carriers generated outside the depletion region do not contribute to the photocurrent, which accounts for the constant Jsc with thicker films despite increasing light absorption.26 These results show that there is an optimal film thickness which balances the development of an electrostatic field with having a short collection distance. Even when the electrode thickness is matched to the depletion width, however, the absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) is less than unity. In other words, the diffusion length is essentially zero, and the collection length is limited primarily by the drift length of holes.

The drift length of holes is dependent on the voltage drop across the electrode, which gives rise to a voltage dependant photocurrent.27 The Gartner model is often used to interpret such voltage dependant photocurrent densities.28,29 The Gartner model neglects surface state and depletion region recombination; however we demonstrated that depletion region recombination is significant in hematite electrodes.25,27 We therefore developed a model to describe the photocurrent density as the product of the optically saturated photocurrent density, given by the flux of photons that are absorbed by the material, Jabs, and the collection efficiency, η(V), which is a function of voltage:27 (1)
The collection efficiency is described by (2)where μ is the minority carrier mobility, τ is the minority carrier lifetime, and D is the electrode thickness. Note that this model is only valid when interfacial charge transfer is fast, such as when one-electron hole collectors like [Fe(CN)6]4− are employed. The case of slow charge transfer kinetics, such as water oxidation, is discussed below. According to eqn (1)–(2), linear photocurrent density vs. applied voltage curves are expected (see Fig. 4). The quantity μτVbi/D is the hole drift length, assuming a uniform field across the electrode, at no applied voltage. The collection efficiency is thus expected to increase with increasing hole lifetime and mobility, and decrease with an increasing electrode thickness. This is in agreement with the electrode thickness dependence of Jsc shown in Fig. 2.
Nanostructuring. 
The combination of very short hole collection lengths (∼20 nm) compared with light penetration depths of hundreds of nanometers can explain the low efficiencies of traditional hematite photoelectrodes.10–12,30 This combination is not a show-stopper, however. The development of nanostructured electrodes offers an opportunity to deconvolute the light absorption and charge collection pathways. The first report employing this strategy was by Grätzel and co-workers in 1994 who prepared a mesoporous electrode composed of 25–75 nm hematite particles, analogous to dye-sensitized solar cell electrodes.31 Although little enhancement was achieved, this work did establish the concept which would later prove successful. In 2000 Hagfeldt and co-workers prepared oriented nanorods which produced significantly improved performance.10,32 Since that time there have subsequently been several additional methods developed to prepare a variety of hematite nanostructures, including nanowires,33 nanotubes,16 nanonets,34 and nanocauliflower35 (Fig. 3), which can substantially enhance the photocurrent density.

Importantly, the development of nano-cauliflower hematite photoelectrodes prepared by chemical vapour deposition have produced current densities of over 3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE; a huge improvement over planer single crystal electrodes.36 Another recent approach demonstrated by Wang and co-workers is to coat a high surface area TiSi2 nanonet scaffold with hematite via ALD.34 This structure represents a thin film hematite electrode, which is optically scaled up. Excellent initial results have already been established. This method of nanostructuring is especially attractive since it offers enhanced control of the electrode morphology. The development of nanostructured hematite electrodes has been described in several excellent recent reviews and the interested reader is referred to these articles for further details of nanostructuring hematite electrodes.37–39


Water oxidation efficiency. 
While nanostructuring electrodes as described above can overcome the short minority charge carrier collection length, holes that reach the electrode/electrolyte interface still must be collected efficiently. Use of thin films allowed us to demonstrate that when a fast one-electron redox couples are employed, such as [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−, the hole collection can be quantitative.27 Similar conclusions were reached by others using a H2O2 hole scavenger.40 The water oxidation reaction at the hematite electrode surface is generally reported to be sluggish, however, which allows for increased recombination and a concomitant loss in efficiency.41–46 The differences in the J–V behaviour of a hematite electrode under H2O oxidation conditions and with a fast hole collector such as [Fe(CN)6]4−, can be attributed to differences in the surface-hole collection efficiency (Fig. 4).

A detailed understanding of the water oxidation reaction at the hematite electrode surface is therefore very important in devising strategies to overcome this kinetic barrier. There have been several recent studies, employing a variety of techniques, to understand the nature of the slow water splitting reaction with hematite photoelectrodes. For example, Durrant and co-workers used transient absorption spectroscopy to monitor the evolution of surface-trapped holes and correlated a long trapped hole lifetime with the onset of photocurrent.44 Peter and co-workers recently used intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and impedance spectroscopy (IS) to study the kinetics of water oxidation at hematite electrodes.41,47 In this work, a model was presented that describes the kinetic competition between charge transfer and recombination of surface trapped holes to interpret the IMPS and IS response.41
Recently we employed impedance spectroscopy to investigate water oxidation with hematite electrodes under different conditions of voltage, light intensity and electrolyte pH.48 A general physical model to interpret the IS data, which includes the existence of a surface state at the semiconductor/liquid interface where holes accumulate, was established (Fig. 5). We found a strong correlation between the development of a surface state capacitance, Css, and a valley in the charge transfer resistance from the surface state, Rct,ss, with the onset of photocurrent as illustrated in Fig. 5.48 These results clearly indicate that the hole-transfer step leading to water oxidation takes place predominantly from surface trapped holes, and not directly from holes in the valence band.

The above studies each highlight the fact that surface states play an important role in determining the water oxidation efficiency. They trap energetic valence band holes in lower energy trap states, these surface-trapped holes then either recombine with conduction band electrons or participate in water oxidation reactions. The mechanistic details of the processes involving the surface states, which determine the overall water oxidation efficiency, are still unclear. The chemical nature of the surface states is also still unknown. These issues certainly need to be better understood in order to minimize the required overpotential for water oxidation and maximize the photocurrent density (Fig. 4).
One strategy to overcome problems associated with surface states that has been recently employed is to modify the surface chemistry by applying coatings of other metal oxide materials such as Al2O3 and Ga2O3.49,50 Analogous strategies have been successfully employed in controlling recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells.51 In the case of hematite, surface state passivation strategies have resulted in an improvement in overpotential, but with diminished photocurrent densities. The physical effect of the coatings, e.g. if they reduce recombination, accelerate water oxidation or simply eliminate trapping, is also not clear and needs further investigation.
Catalysts. 
If the kinetics of water oxidation can be accelerated, such that it is significantly faster than recombination, better performance may be realized. One way to increase the water oxidation efficiency is to utilize catalysts which can be deposited on the surface of hematite photoanodes. This is an attractive strategy since the hematite electrode and catalyst can be independently investigated and optimized. In the most successful example of this, deposition of the well-known water oxidation catalyst iridium oxide on hematite shifted the onset potential by 200 mV and improved the photocurrent density.52 Iridium is a rare element, and therefore not ideal, and the enhancement decayed over a few minutes attributed to detachment of the nanoparticles. Nevertheless, this result demonstrates promise of using catalysts to significantly improve the water oxidation efficiency.
Recently, a cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) catalyst deposited onto hematite surfaces has also been investigated.13,14 Since it is made of earth abundant materials and has been the subject of detailed mechanistic studies, Co-Pi is a particularly interesting system.53–55 Promising results of the hematite/Co-Pi system have been reported by several groups. Fig. 6 shows the approximately 200 mV decrease in overpotential and slight increase in photocurrent densities at more positive potentials when the Co-Pi catalyst is added to a thin film hematite surface. Zhong and Gamelin first reported such a performance enhancement and attributed it to better water oxidation kinetics by Co-Pi compared to bare hematite.13,56 Other work by Durrant and co-workers attributed the enhancement primarily to a three order of magnitude reduction in recombination.57 Peter and co-workers also demonstrated that the primary effect of a cobalt nitrate surface treatment of hematite electrodes is the reduction of recombination.58 Since the surface chemistry changes upon the application of a catalyst, the rates of surface trapping, water oxidation and recombination are all almost certainly different compared to a bare electrode. Elucidation of a detailed structure–function relationship of catalysts on these processes will be necessary to further improve the water oxidation efficiency.

Outlook
The performance of hematite photoelectrodes for photocatalyzed water oxidation has been improving steadily over the last few years. A significant part of the improvement can be attributed to advances in developing nanostructured morphologies which allow for good light absorption with short hole collection lengths. Further improvements in the synthesis of uniform nanostructured morphologies with controlled dimensions should allow even great enhancements. The fundamental understanding of kinetic barriers which limit hematite's efficiency have also improved. For example, the water oxidation reaction on bare hematite electrodes is too slow to compete with recombination without application of a relatively large bias (overpotential). It has been shown that catalysts can help overcome this, but the mechanistic effect of the catalysts is still not completely understood. Additional studies of the water oxidation reaction, both with and without catalysts, on the electrode surface are therefore important in developing new catalysts which further reduce the overpotential. Finally, it has been shown that incorporation of a high concentration of impurities (dopants) can improve the electrode performance, however once again the physical effect of these dopants is not clear.
In conclusion, while great strides have been taken to improve the performance and understanding of water oxidation with hematite electrodes, the state-of-the-art is still far from optimal and there are several fundamental issues which still need to be better understood. We are confident, however, that continued research will lead to advancements which allow hematite to be integrated into efficient overall water splitting systems.

Footnote
† Thin films of iron oxide were deposited on FTO coated glass substrates by atomic layer deposition using a procedure described previously.48 The J–V curves were measured with an Eco Chemie Autolab potentiostat under simulated AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The Co-Pi catalyst was added to the surface by photo-assisted electrodeposition as described elsewhere.56
