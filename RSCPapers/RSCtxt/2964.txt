        CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocubes with high luminescence were synthesized through a solution-based diffusion method.

        CuInS2 is a I–III–VI2 semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.45 eV in the bulk material. CuInS2 thin films have been widely studied for photovoltaic device applications due to their high energy conversion efficiency and high absorption coefficient.1 Recently, much attention has been paid to CuInS2 nanocrystals, which have promising applications in printable solar cells, light emitting diodes (LED) and biological labeling.2 Various wet chemistry approaches including hydrothermal, thermolysis and hot injection have been developed to prepare CuInS2 nanocrystals.3–5 However, most of the reported CuInS2 nanocrystals suffered from poor crystallinity and poor uniformity in composition, size and morphology.
An obvious challenge for synthetic chemistry of CuInS2 nanocrystals arises from their ternary compositions. Cu–S is generally weaker than In–S, and consequently the stoichiometric ratio between Cu and In may vary substantially in the synthesized nanocrystals, which can exhibit great composition and phase complexity and induce structural defects.6 To combat this challenge, several approaches have been developed to control the stoichiometric ratio between Cu and In with an aim to achieve high quality CuInS2 nanocrystals.7 For example, single source precursors which had fixed Cu∶In stoichiometric ratio were employed to synthesize CuInS2 nanocrystals.5 The Cu∶In stoichiometric ratio in the nanocrystals was also controlled by introducing reactivity controlling ligands for Cu.3
In the last decade, certain efforts at developing semiconductor nanocrystals have been shifted to the synthesis of alloyed nanocrystals.8–10 The alloyed semiconductor nanocrystals hold several advantages, one of which is the possibility of minimizing the structural defects in nanocrystals and making the crystal structure more stable.9,10 High quality alloyed nanocrystals including ZnxCd1−xS have been synthesized successfully.8 An attempt has also been made to synthesize CuInS2–ZnS alloyed semiconductor nanocrystals.6 However, the reported CuInS2–ZnS nanocrytals did not show the expected high quality in terms of size and morphology control and quantum yield.
In this work, an effective solution based synthetic strategy has been developed to make high quality CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocrystals. The quantum yield of the obtained alloyed nanocrystals could reach 39%, which is reasonably good as compared to those of the previously reported. Moreover, the CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocubes exhibit promising two photon fluorescence (TPF) properties, suggesting their potential applications in multi-photon bioimaging.

        CuInS2–ZnS nanocrystals were synthesized by diffusing Zn into CuInS2 seeds at high temperature in solution. In the first step, CuInS2 seeds were formed by decomposing the mixture of copper acetate, indium acetate and n-dodecylthiol at 120 °C in ODE solution. The XRD test of the harvested nanoparticles suggested that CuInS2 nanoparticles were formed at this step but with poor crystallinity (Fig. S1, ESI†). At 120 °C, zinc stearate solution in ODE/oleylamine was injected into the reaction system and followed by further heating to 210 °C for 30 minutes. The amount of the injected zinc stearate solution was varied in order to obtain CuInS2–ZnS nanocubes with different Zn contents. The detailed experiment procedures are available in the ESI.†
Three types of CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocrystals with different amounts of Zn were prepared. The chemical compositions of the three nanocrystals were determined by using the ICP-OES technique (Table S1, ESI†). In general, the mole ratios between Cu and In of all the samples were close to 1. The mole fractions of Zn (Zn/(Cu + In + Zn)) in the three samples were 38%, 52% and 62%, respectively. Fig. 1 presents the crystal structure and morphology characterizations of the obtained CuInS2–ZnS nanocrystals with a Zn mole fraction of 62%. As shown in Fig. 1A, the XRD pattern of the nanocrystals consisted of three major peaks at 2θ of 28.6°, 47.5° and 55.8°, corresponding to the (111), (220) and (222) indices of the zinc blend crystal structure, respectively.11–14 It was noted that the exact positions of these three peaks were right shifted as compared to the XRD peaks of pure CuInS2, suggesting that the crystal structure of the CuInS2–ZnS was slightly changed due to the diffusion of Zn. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the Energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) image of the CuInS2–ZnS nanoparticles, in which the distribution of Zn in each nanoparticle is clearly observed. Fig. 1B presents a low magnification TEM picture of the obtained CuInS2–ZnS nanocrystals. Under TEM observation, the nanocrystals were dispersed very well and no particle aggregations were formed. The average size of the nanocrystals was ∼10.5 nm with a narrow size distribution from 9 nm to 11.5 nm (Fig. S3A, ESI†). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) displayed the diffraction rings of (111), (220) and (222) indices of the zinc blend crystal structure. The EDX element analysis, as shown in Fig. 1D, confirmed that the nanocrystals were composed of Cu, In, Zn and S. A magnified TEM picture (Fig. 1C) of several nanocrystals revealed that the obtained nanocrystals have a well-defined cubic morphology. Fig. 1E and F show the HRTEM image of a typical nanocube and its fast Fourier transform (FFT), respectively. The lattice fringes of the nanocube were clearly observed, of which two lattice indices of the zinc blend crystal structure, i.e. (020) and (220), could be distinguished. The corresponding FFT further confirmed the cubic crystal nature of the nanocube. By reducing the amount of the injected zinc source, another two types of CuInS2–ZnS nanocrystals with respective zinc mole fractions of 52% and 38% were synthesized using the same diffusion process. The TEM images of these two types of nanocrystals are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†), respectively, showing that both of the nanocrystals have well-defined cubic morphology. These two alloyed nanocubes have a similar size of ∼10 nm, which was close to that of the nanocubes with 62 mol% zinc. The size distributions of these two nanocubes are also presented in Fig. S3B and S3C (ESI†), respectively.

As mentioned above, synthesis of high quality CuInS2 nanocrystals remains a challenge due to the unequal bond strength between Cu–S and In–S bonds. Structural defects, such as vacancies and their induced anti-site defects, are commonly formed in pure CuInS2 nanocrystals. In this work, Zn ions were introduced into CuInS2 to form a CuInS2–ZnS alloyed structure. The possible crystal structure model of CuInS2–ZnS compound is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), as compared to the original crystal structure of CuInS2. A certain amount of the introduced Zn ions could substitute for Cu and In ions, and thus inhibiting the generation of vacancies. Moreover, the alloying ZnS component introduced more lattice dislocation into the system and thus hardening the crystal structure. As a result, the CuInS2–ZnS exhibited much higher structure stability than pure CuInS2.
The optical properties of the obtained CuInS2–ZnS nanocubes with zinc mole fractions of 38%, 52% and 62%, respectively, were characterized. In the absorption spectra shown in Fig. S6 of the ESI†, the absorption onsets of the nanocubes are blue shifted with increasing zinc mole fraction. Fig. 2A presents the PL properties of the synthesized alloyed nanocubes under excitation of UV (365 nm). The emission wavelengths of 548, 600 and 678 nm for the nanocubes with zinc mole fractions of 62%, 52% and 38%, respectively, also suggested a blue shift in emission with increasing Zn mole fraction. The observed systematic composition-controlled shifts of the absorption onset and emission wavelength can be explained by the formation of CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocrystalsvia alloying the wider band-gap ZnS with the narrower band-gap CuInS2. The quantum yields of all the emissions were as high as 39% (548 nm), 37% (600 nm), 34% (678 nm) (Fig. S7, ESI†), respectively, which were much higher than those of the pure CuInS2 nanoparticles. The corresponding digital photo shown in Fig. 2A also displays the strong emission of the nanocubes in toluene. The PL relaxation of the nanocubes with a zinc mole fraction of 38% was further characterized, as compared to that of the pure CuInS2 nanoparticles (Fig. S8, ESI†). The pure CuInS2 nanoparticles were synthesized at 210 °C for 30 minutes as a control. It was observed that the PL decay was not single-exponential and a fast PL decay component was detected in the pure CuInS2 nanoparticles. Such a fast decay component could be contributed to the structure defects in the pure CuInS2.15 As a consequence, the pure CuInS2 nanoparticles showed a very poor quantum yield (inset of Fig. S8, ESI†). In contrast, the CuInS2–ZnS sample completely eliminated the fast PL decay component and resulted in uniform single-exponential decay across the whole emission profile. This indicated that the structure defects could be effectively suppressed by the zinc diffusion, which was also correlated to the significant increase in quantum yield.
 Fig. 2  (A) PL spectra (365 nm UV) of the CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocubes with different zinc mole fractions of 62%, 52% and 38%, respectively. (B) Upconversion spectra (800 nm laser) of the CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocubes with different zinc mole fractions of 62%, 52% and 38%, respectively. 
The upconversion fluorescence properties of the nanocubes were tested under the excitation of 800 nm laser. The emission spectra and the corresponding emission photo are displayed in Fig. 2B. The emission peaks which were excited by 800 nm laser matched well with their respective counterparts under UV excitation. Three visible emissions, i.e., yellow, orange and red, were observed in the digital photo. The nanocubes with the zinc mole fraction of 52% were further studied by varying the input laser power. The laser power dependence of emission intensity is displayed in Fig. S9A (ESI†). Using the relation of I ≈ PowerK, the value of K was around 2.13 (Fig. S9B, ESI†), suggesting that the upconversion fluorescence mechanism in the sample was two photon excitation in nature.
The fact that the nanocubes exhibited strong two-photon fluorescence suggests their applications in bioimaging excited by multiphotons of near infrared. Recently, multiphoton bioimaging has been attracting much attention due to little near-infrared absorption from endogenous species and water. Multiphoton microscopy enables deep imaging of a variety of biological confocal microscopy, and it has now become the primary sample with less overall photobleaching than with the wide-field or fluorescence imaging technique in thick specimens. To demonstrate the applicability of the obtained nanocubes for bioimaging, the first necessary experiment step is to transfer the nanocubes from organic solvent to water.
A polymer coating technique was adopted for the phase transfer. The polymeric material chosen for the phase transfer was an amphiphilic brush copolymer that was derived by grafting alkylamine chains to poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride).
After phase transfer, the PL properties of the nanocubes could be well retained, as shown in the digital photograph of the nanocubes dispersed in water (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows the photograph of the nanocubes with a zinc mole fraction of 38% dispersed in water and toluene mixtures, demonstrating that the nanocubes could be dispersed in water completely after phase transfer. More particularly, the PL emission spectra of the nanocubes after phase transfer were compared with those of the nanocubes before phase transfer. As shown in Fig. 3C, there was no obvious shift in emission wavelength for the nanocubes after phase transfer, further implying that the PL properties of the nanocubes were well retained after phase transfer. Fig. 3D shows the image of OCA 17 cells labeled with the nanocubes with a zinc mole fraction of 62% under UV excitation. The yellow emission was clearly observed from the cells. The multi-photon cell labeling of the nanocubes with a zinc mole fraction of 38% was also demonstrated using the NIH/3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3E, strong red emission from the cells was detected under the excitation of 800 nm laser. These results suggested that the obtained heterodimers have promising cell labeling applications under either UV or near infrared excitations.

In summary, we report the synthesis of CuInS2–ZnS alloyed nanocrystals by diffusing Zn ions into CuInS2 nanocrystal seeds. The as-obtained alloyed nanocrystals were highly crystalline and had cubic morphology with narrow size distribution. By adjusting the Zn content, the nanocubes showed tunable emissions in the visible band from 548 to 678 nm under UV excitation. Moreover, two-photon fluorescence was demonstrated in the obtained CuInS2–ZnS nanocubes. The cell imagings excited by either 365 nm UV or 800 nm infrared laser were successfully demonstrated.
