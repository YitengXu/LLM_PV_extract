    , Accepted 22nd July 2014First published on 6th August 2014AbstractThe π-conjugated polymer, PQBOC8, can be easily assembled into a large-area crystalline ultrathin film at the CHCl3/water interface. A phototransistor based on this ultrathin film showed a large photoresponsivity of 970 A W−1, and a photocurrent/dark current ratio of 1.36 × 104 under a very low white light irradiation.
Polymer semiconductors have been widely recognized as promising materials for large-area, flexible electronic devices due to their film forming capacity and mechanical flexibility.1–3 However, many limitations in the performance of current polymer electronics, including organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and solar cells, are attributed to a lack of macroscopic order in polymer films and inability to control the morphology at the nanoscale level.4 In contrast to devices based on organic amorphous thin films, organic single crystals possess higher molecular ordering, which holds promise for enhanced performance and even unique optical and electronic properties.5,6 However, in consideration of the conformational freedom of alkyl groups and flexible entanglement of the backbone, polymers tend to form disordered structures in the nanometer to the micrometer length scale.7,8 Therefore, it is a challenge to fabricate polymers into crystalline nanostructures.
Solution-phase self-assembly has been demonstrated to be an efficient method to prepare crystalline polymers with one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure.9–11 For example, Xia and co-workers reported the charge transport of 1D nanobelts from the n-type polymer BBL fabricated by solution phase synthesis.10 Zhan et al. prepared highly crystalline PTz nanowires with excellent phototransistor performance by evaporation of dilute solution.12 Compared with the 1D nanostructure, two-dimensional (2D) crystalline materials, like graphene, attract much attention owing to their molecular-scale thickness with huge surface areas and compatibility with arbitrary substrates.13 They are endowed great potential for next generation electronics.14–16 To obtain 2D highly ordered nanostructures, in previous studies, copolymers were designed to have a plethora of molecular interaction, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, dipole–dipole, amphiphilic blocks, etc.17,18 A tremendous effort has to been focused on the design and synthesis to meet these requirements. Moreover, this is not suitable for polymers with given structures. Therefore, the establishment of a facile approach to fabricate a π-conjugated polymer into 2D crystalline film is of great practical value not only in terms of the relationship between its intrinsic structure and properties, but also for technical applications. To our knowledge, the fabrication of large-area and ultrathin polymer films with high crystallinity via solution-phase self-assembly has not been achieved.
Herein, we reported a simple self-assembly process for organizing free-stretched polymer chains into ordered 2D crystalline ultrathin films in a large scale at CHCl3/water interface. We choose the polymer PQBOC8 as a sample which is a promising semiconductor used in optoelectronic devices for its high charge-carrier mobility19 and power conversion efficiency in solar cells,20 simultaneously. The polymer was synthesized by Suzuki coupling according to a previously reported procedure.19 A wide absorption range (see ESI†) and the high fluorescence quantum yield of 10% in the solid state may make it a good candidate for photo-controlled devices.

Fig. 1a shows the schematic representation of the preparation of PQBOC8 nanostructures. Firstly, 1 mL deionized water was put into a beaker. The polymer PQBOC8 was totally soluble in CHCl3 and then injected dropwise into the container. Finally, a cover was put on the beaker to guarantee the slow evaporation of CHCl3 and give the polymer molecules sufficient time to adjust themselves. Because of larger density of CHCl3 over water, CHCl3 embedded into water and retained part of the solution touching air for evaporation, which is illustrated in Fig. 1a. After complete evaporation of CHCl3, the 2D films floated on the water surface. It is worth noting that we extended this method to other typical polymers including P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T (Fig. S2, ESI†). These polymers could also be assembled into large-area films indicating that this method is broadly applicable.

(c) XRD pattern of 2D film on SiO2/Si substrate. The inset is the molecular structure of polymer PQBOC8. 
The morphology of the 2D PQBOC8 film was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. 1b. The size of the film is about hundreds of micrometers. The electron diffraction pattern (inset of Fig. 1b) indicates that this film is highly crystalline. Electron beam damage is particularly problematic for ultrathin polymer films. With this in mind, the electron diffraction image was taken at 208 K. Indexation is assigned in a similar way as for P3HT.21,22 We ascribe a d-spacing of 4.0 Å from (020) reflection along b axis to π–π stacking distance and 4.4 Å from (002) reflection along c axis to the reflection of polymer chain direction. To acquire a better understanding of molecular packing in crystalline films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were employed and are shown in Fig. 1c. A strong and sharp diffraction peak is observed at 2θ = 4.1° while the second and third diffraction peaks are also observed at 2θ = 8.3°, and 2θ = 12.3°, which arise from an ordered lamellar structure with a interlayer d-spacing of 21.5 Å. In combination with the results of the electron diffraction pattern, we could confirm that only edge-on configuration existed in the crystalline films. This is different from the results of the spin-coated film in which edge-on and face-on orientation were concomitant.19 That is to say, the molecules were packed in a much ordered way in films prepared using this novel method.
High resolution TEM (HR-TEM) was used to visualize the inner morphology of a thin film. As shown in Fig. 2a, the polymer backbones show a long-range orientational order even though there are fluctuations in the degree of local order. Over larger length scales, the film morphology was observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In Fig. 2b, strip-shaped structures were observed and intertwined together forming a large-area film. In order to obtain the intermediate state of the solution, we observed the morphology of the sample using TEM before all CHCl3 evaporation. Dispersed nanobelts were numerously present (Fig. S3a, ESI†) before all CHCl3 was evaporated, which sheds more light on the formation of the large-area film. The thickness and morphology of these films can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the initial solution (Fig. S4, ESI†). The self-assembled films have a range of thickness from 22 nm to 14 nm with the decrease of concentration of solution (Table S1, ESI†). When the solution concentration of PQBOC8 was given at 0.1 mg mL−1, the nuclear density was so high that they easily formed network and disordered structures. With the concentration of the solution decreasing, the density of nuclear would also decrease and the film becomes much ordered. For instance, it is obvious that film with aligned nanostructure can be obtained at the concentration of 0.005 mg mL−1. Nonetheless, the film would become discontinuous when the concentration below 0.005 mg mL−1.

On the basis of above observation and discussion, we proposed a possible mechanism in Fig. 3 for the formation of a 2D crystalline film. In the first step, the polymer chains are fully extended in diluted solution (Fig. 3a). With the evaporation of CHCl3, molecules can attach to each other through electrostatic interaction and π–π interaction of donor and acceptor units between adjacent chains forming local ordered strips by nucleation (Fig. 3b). As more CHCl3 evaporated, the CHCl3/water interface would continuously shrink to reduce the surface energy which induced a force to compress the strips to arrange in a more ordered manner (Fig. 3c). With the help of the surface tension of water, the shrinking occurs along all directions of the interface, and thus leads to the formation of large-area 2D films with polymer side chains perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. 3d).

In order to examine the electrical properties of crystalline films, OFET devices with top-contact and bottom-gate configurations were fabricated. The relationship between thickness and mobilities is shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The mobility increases with the decreasing thickness of the film, which is in accordance with the fact that the film becomes much more ordered with the thickness decrease. The maximum mobility was found to be 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio of 107 at the concentration of 0.005 mg mL−1 while the devices were determined without any post-treatment. The typical output and transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The mobility improved if the substrate was treated with proper monolayer dielectric and some wrinkles could be eliminated in the process of transfer from water. Further investigation is still ongoing.
Typical photoresponse characteristics of phototransistors are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The increase of drain current was obviously observed under the illumination, which indicates that light plays an important role in improving the performance of the transistor. This conclusion is further confirmed by the results of Fig. S7 (ESI†). That is to say, light irradiation can be used as a substitute of VG to adjust the drain current and control the on/off state of the devices.23 Photoresponsivity (R) and photocurrent/dark current ratio (P) are defined by the equations given in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 4c, under a low white light irradiation of 0.28 mW cm−2, the phototransistor device exhibits strong photo-dependence and high light sensitivity with a R value of 970 A W−1 and a P value of 1.36 × 104. The phototransistor performance is also analyzed upon irradiation at different wavelengths (Fig. S8 and Table S2, ESI†). Green light irradiation yields the largest enhancement in the drain current with a photoresponsivity of 1000 A W−1 and a maximum on/off ratio of 1.24 × 105 under a very low power intensity of 43 μW cm−2 (Fig. 4d). This is attributed to the wavelength of the light source matching the light absorption range. The photoresponsivity reported here is among the highest values for devices based on the conjugated polymers. The phototransistor based on the spin-coated film only shows the highest R of 106 A W−1 and P of 92 under the same experimental conditions (Fig. S9, ESI†). We propose possible reasons for the highly sensitive phenomenon of the crystalline film and its superiority over the spin-coated film in view of intrinsic properties of PQBOC8. Firstly, the solid fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) of 10% being larger than many other donor–acceptor type polymers determines the exciton quality and numbers. Secondly, slow self-assembly induces a highly ordered crystalline structure leading to a decrease in defects as trapping sites. Moreover, donor units and acceptor units in adjacent polymer chains pack with each other very closely. This leads to a faster charge transfer in the crystalline film than in the spin-coated film, in which donor units and acceptor units are arbitrary. This speculation can be confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence measurements (Fig. S10, ESI†). The emission of both the samples follows a two-exponential decay. We ascribe the long-lived component to the charge transfer (CT) between the donor and acceptor moieties within one polymer chain while the short-lived component arises from CT between the donor and acceptor units in adjacent polymer chains.24 The ratio of the fast component in the crystalline film is higher than that in the amorphous film (72% vs. 45%), indicating that directional inter-chain charge transfer interaction plays a dominant role in the depopulation of the excited state. It would lead to efficient exciton dissociation and increased photoresponsivity in the phototransistor device based on the self-assembled polymer film.

In summary, we have successfully prepared a large-area crystalline polymer film using a simple CHCl3/water interface method. In the crystalline film, polymers constitute an edge-on orientation, which is much more ordered than the film prepared via a spin-coating method. Phototransistors based on these ultrathin films exhibited a high R value of 970 A W−1 and on/off ratios up to 1.36 × 104 under a low white light irradiation. This methodology provides a general and efficient strategy to prepare crystalline polymer films, which have great potential to be applied in optoelectronics.
