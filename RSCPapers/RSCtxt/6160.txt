    , Accepted 16th February 2022First published on 8th March 2022AbstractPhotoelectrodes combined with semiconductors and cocatalysts have been extensively investigated for photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 gas to chemicals and fuels. However, little attention has been paid to the electronic interaction between semiconductor photoelectrodes and cocatalysts, which is critical for controlling the CO2 reduction reaction. Here, we have discovered that the unique electronic interaction at the interface between bismuth nanoparticles (Bi NPs) and gallium nitride nanowires (GaN NWs) can significantly boost the catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction on a silicon photocathode. Theoretical calculations suggest that the binary system consisting of Bi and GaN favors CO2 conversion to HCOOH and enhances electron transfer from GaN NWs to Bi NPs. The optimized Bi/GaN/Si photocathode results in a superior faradaic efficiency of HCOOH (FEHCOOH) of ∼98% at −0.3 VRHE under 1-sun illumination.
Introduction
The ever-increasing CO2 emissions associated with fossil-fuel based energy consumption have led to serious environmental concerns. The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR) has been considered as a promising solution to overcome this challenge.1 To improve the activity of the CO2 RR, many electrocatalysts have been developed and achieved relatively high selectivity and productivity at low overpotential for single-carbon (CO, CH4, and HCOOH)2–5 and multi-carbon products (C2H4, C2H6, and C2H5OH).6–8 When the electrocatalysts were integrated with renewable energy sources, net CO2 reduction could be potentially realized while simultaneously producing value-added feedstock. Therefore, the solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 RR based on semiconductor photoelectrodes is believed to be one of the most attractive approaches because of solar energy's infinite reservoir and environmental benignity. Previously, various kinds of semiconductors such as Si,9–11 III–V,12 and metal oxides13–15 have demonstrated the PEC CO2 RR. However, these semiconductors usually suffer from insufficient light absorption, sluggish charge carrier transport, photocorrosion, or most importantly poor catalytic activity.16,17 Therefore, surface cocatalysts have been required to improve the catalytic activity of the PEC CO2 RR.
Noble metals such as Au,18,19 Ag,20,21 and their alloys22,23 have been frequently decorated on photocathodes as cocatalysts. However, these noble metals are too expensive for practical applications. To replace the noble metals, inexpensive and earth-abundant cocatalysts have been studied and developed for the electrocatalytic CO2 RR. Especially, Sn and Bi metals have shown promise for converting CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH).10,24–26 However, the effective utilization of earth-abundant cocatalysts in the PEC CO2 RR still remains a grand challenge due to the inefficient light trapping, limited surface area, poor stability, and insufficient activity of semiconductor photocathodes.18,24,25 Recently, single-crystal GaN nanowires (GaN NWs) vertically grown on Si photocathodes have emerged as an efficient and stable platform to achieve the high performance CO2 RR as well as water splitting.27–31 To date, however, there have been few studies of interfacial interactions between semiconductors and cocatalysts to further improve the performance.
For heterogeneous catalysis, tuning the electronic structure has been an important strategy to improve the catalytic activity.32–39 Interfacial interaction between two different materials changes the electronic structure, alters the binding energies of reaction intermediates, and consequently tunes the catalytic pathway. Therefore, a fine control over the composition and structure of multi-composite catalysts can yield unique catalytic properties that cannot be obtained with a single catalyst material.34,40–42 However, little attention has been paid to the interfacial electronic effects induced by interaction between semiconductors and cocatalysts on PEC catalysis, owing to the complexity of the heterogeneous interface, difficulty of fabricating high-quality semiconductor materials, and poor stability of conventional photocathodes in aqueous media. Thus, a fundamental understanding of the electronic modulation by interfacial interaction is critical and urgently needed in order to control the selectivity, productivity, and stability of the PEC CO2 RR.
Here, we have investigated the electronic interaction between Bi NPs and GaN NWs grown on a planar Si wafer and the impact on the PEC CO2 RR. The unique atomic ordering and electronic properties of defect-free GaN NWs showed enormous promise for efficient CO2 conversion when integrated with Bi NP cocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested strong electronic interaction by sharing the electrons between Bi NPs and GaN NWs. This interaction lowered the thermodynamic reaction barriers and further facilitated electron transport. The reaction mechanism of the Bi/GaN system is different from the previous CO2 RR over Bi electrocatalysts or GaN photocathodes. As a result, the integration of Bi NPs on GaN NWs greatly improved the faradaic efficiency of HCOOH (FEHCOOH) of ∼98% at −0.3 VRHE, achieved a high current density of HCOOH (jHCOOH) = 10.3 mA cm−2 at −0.6 VRHE, and operated 12 h without degradation under 1-sun illumination.
Results and discussion
Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes were fabricated by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of single-crystal GaN NWs on the n+–p silicon substrate, followed by thermal evaporation of Bi NPs (Fig. 1a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed the vertically grown GaN NWs on the planar n+–p Si wafer (Fig. S1†). The average length of GaN NWs was ∼288 nm and the average diameter was ∼60 nm (Fig. 1b and S2†). After the decoration of 10 nm-thick Bi NPs, the surface morphology of GaN NWs was roughened (Fig. 1c). The presence of Bi NPs was further confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. S3†). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of GaN/Si and Bi/GaN/Si showed GaN (002), GaN (004), and Si (004) peaks (Fig. S4†).43 Because the grains size of Bi NPs was too small, the XRD peaks from Bi NPs cannot be detected.

In order to confirm the microstructure and atomic distribution of GaN NWs and Bi NPs, we performed scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies. Bi NPs were uniformly distributed on the array of GaN NWs (Fig. 2a). Because the atomic number differences between Ga (31) and Bi (83) is fairly large, we could obtain sufficient Z-contrasts from the locally segregated Bi NPs on GaN NWs in the high angular annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM images (Fig. 2b). In the STEM images, the size of Bi NPs was statistically calculated using computer software and the average size was measured to be 9.1 nm (Fig. S5†). High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction patterns also evidenced the Bi NPs on GaN NWs (Fig. 2c and S6†). Lattice fringes were observed with d-spacings of 0.20, 0.24, 0.27, and 0.33 nm, which correspond to the Bi (015), Bi (104), GaN (002), and Bi (012) planes, respectively (JCPDS # 02-1078 and # 44-1246). This indicates that polycrystalline Bi NPs were formed on single-crystal GaN NWs. Moreover, the surface of Bi NPs was covered with ∼2 nm-thick amorphous oxide, indicating a metal/oxide core/shell structure.

Morphology of Bi NPs was investigated after the CO2 RR for 20 min at −0.4 VRHE in 0.1 M KHCO3. The presence of Bi NPs having the size of 3–20 nm was evident on GaN NWs, indicating that Bi NPs were stably anchored on the surface of GaN NWs without a noticeable change in morphology (Fig. S7a and b†). Crystallographic orientations of Bi NPs were investigated using the lattice fringes and electron diffraction patterns. The Bi (012) plane with a lattice spacing of 0.33 nm (Fig. S7c†), Bi2O2CO3 (013) plane with a lattice spacing of 0.30 nm (Fig. S7d†), and Bi2O3 (002) plane with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm (Fig. S7e†) were observed. The outermost surface of the cocatalysts was passivated by the amorphous region with a thickness of 2–5 nm. The oxidized forms of Bi2O2CO3, Bi2O3, and amorphous oxides might have been transformed from metallic Bi by immersing the sample in the aqueous electrolyte. There should be unavoidable partial reduction of the oxidized Bi species to metallic Bi during the CO2 RR. However, it is also true that the bismuth–oxygen structure is maintained during the CO2 RR at cathodic potentials as confirmed by operando Raman and in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements.26,44,45 Hence, we consider that Bi NPs acting in the catalytic reaction were composed of not only metallic Bi but also oxidized forms.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to study the surface bonding states of photoelectrodes. Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra were separated with a major peak of the Ga–N bond (1118.0 eV) and a minor peak of the Ga–O bond (1119.2 eV) (Fig. 3a).46 After depositing Bi NPs, the peak intensity of Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra reduced by ∼4 times because Bi NPs screened the photoelectrons emitted from GaN NWs. Moreover, the Ga 2p3/2 spectrum of Bi/GaN/Si positively shifted ∼0.21 eV compared to GaN/Si likely due to electron donation from GaN NWs to Bi NPs. After the CO2 RR for 20 min in 0.1 M KHCO3 at −0.4 VRHE, XPS spectra were approximately the same. This suggests that the chemical bonding states of GaN NWs didn't change during the PEC CO2 RR. In N 1s XPS spectra, the N–Ga (398.4 eV) and N–O (399.8 V) bonds were detected with Ga LMM Auger electrons (Fig. 3b).47 Similar to the Ga 2p3/2 XPS results, the intensity of N 1s decreased after deposition of Bi NPs and shifted positively by ∼0.31 eV, revealing electron transfer and strong electronic interaction between GaN NWs and Bi NPs. A positive shift of Ga 2p3/2 and N 1s spectra implied that the GaN NWs donate electrons to Bi NPs. The spontaneous electron transfer from GaN NWs to Bi NPs will be discussed in detail in the following theoretical calculation section.

To elucidate the bonding states of Bi NPs, deconvolution of Bi 4f XPS spectra was carried out with the metallic Bi0 (156.4 and 161.7 eV) and Bi3+ (158.5 and 163.8 eV) bonds (Fig. 3c). GaN NWs showed a peak from Ga 3s electrons without the characteristic doublet peaks of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 spectra. In contrast, Bi/GaN/Si exhibited a metallic Bi0 peak and an intense Bi3+ peak. The Bi3+ peak remained on the surface even after the CO2 RR due to spontaneously formed Bi2O2CO3, Bi2O3, and amorphous oxides on the surface of Bi NPs in the aqueous electrolyte as described in the TEM results. Despite that there could be partial reduction of Bi2O2CO3 and Bi2O3 during the CO2 RR, the Bi3+ states might dominate the outer surface layer where the catalytic reaction occurs. To investigate the oxidation states of surface oxides, O 1s XPS spectra were fitted with four peaks of O–Ga (531.1 eV), O–Bi (529.4 eV), OH–Bi (530.9 eV), and absorbed H2O (532.2 eV) (Fig. S8†).48 It was found that the oxide (O–Bi) and hydroxide (OH–Bi) were the reason for the Bi3+ peaks. Even after the PEC CO2 RR, the presence of the O–Bi and OH–Bi bonds showed that Bi oxides remain at the outmost layer of Bi NPs.
The PEC CO2 RR was performed by illuminating light (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2) on Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes on the surface normal direction and applying electrical potential using a three-electrode configuration (Fig. 4a). The n+–p Si wafer with a small bandgap (∼1.1 eV) readily generates electron–hole pairs under solar irradiation. GaN NWs enhance the light trapping in the Si substrate by suppressing the reflection loss. The average optical reflectance (OR) of the Si substrate was 51.4% at wavelengths of 400–800 nm (Fig. S9†). In contrast, GaN NWs effectively reduced the OR to 17.4% because their vertically-aligned structure matches the refractive indices between air and the Si substrate.49 In addition, Bi NPs with thickness (tBi) = 10 nm on GaN NWs functioned as a light scattering center, leading to enhanced light absorption and reduced OR to 11.7%. On the other hand, the Bi film (tBi = 10 nm) formed on the planar Si wafer reflects the incident light and increased the OR to 57.9% (Fig. S10†). The vertically aligned NWs were found to be an excellent geometric framework to load the cocatalysts of Bi NPs and enhance the optical transmittance by preventing Fresnel reflection (Fig. S11†). As shown in the energy band diagram of the photocathode, the transport of photoexcited electrons from Si to GaN is feasible without any significant barrier since the conduction bands of n+–Si and n+–GaN are approximately aligned (Fig. 4b).27 Therefore, photogenerated electrons can readily migrate toward the active sites of Bi NPs to participate in the CO2 RR.

(f) Bi thickness dependent FEHCOOH (left axis) and jHCOOH (right axis) of Bi/GaN/Si at potentials of −0.2, −0.4 and −0.6 VRHE. 
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted to study the PEC CO2 RR performance of planar Si, Bi/Si, GaN/Si, and Bi/GaN/Si in CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 (Fig. 4c). The photocurrent densities (j) of Si and Bi/Si with tBi = 10 nm were smaller than those of GaN NWs due to the reflection loss and smaller surface area. Interestingly, GaN NWs grown on the Si substrate showed a significant improvement in the onset potential (0 VRHE) and j (∼8.0 mA cm−2 at −0.8 VRHE) because of the efficient light trapping, effective charge carrier transport, and suppressed recombination. Furthermore, after deposition of Bi NPs on GaN NWs (tBi = 10 nm), j was further improved to 11.9 mA cm−2 at −0.8 VRHE. The photocathodes exhibited negligible activity under dark conditions, revealing that solar energy is required for PEC reactions.
The influence of the applied potential on the FEs was investigated for Si, Bi/Si, GaN/Si, and Bi/GaN/Si (Fig. S12† and Table S1†) and FEHCOOH was summarized (Fig. 4d). Planar Si primarily produced H2 with a little amount of CO (FECO < 10%). Deposition of the Bi film on the Si substrate (Bi/Si) generated HCOOH at 0 VRHE and showed a maximum FEHCOOH of ∼70% at −0.5 VRHE. The GaN/Si photocathode predominantly produced H2. However, Bi/GaN/Si greatly improved the selectivity of HCOOH and positively shifted the onset potential. High FEHCOOH > 92% was achieved at −0.3 VRHE, and the onset-potential was ∼0.2 VRHE. According to previous studies, the thermodynamic energy barrier for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the Bi catalyst was much higher than that of CO2 reduction to HCOOH because the free energy of H adsorption was too positive to allow the active HER.50 Therefore, H adsorption on the Bi/GaN/Si photocathode was inhibited and the HER should be largely suppressed. Since Bi/GaN/Si showed the best j and FEHCOOH among the measured photoelectrodes, and jHCOOH was also the highest (Fig. S13†). The maximum jHCOOH of Bi/GaN/Si was 8.2 mA cm−2 at −0.6 VRHE which was ∼10 times higher than that of Bi/Si (0.8 mA cm−2) (Fig. 4e). What is more, Bi/GaN/Si showed the maximum applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.15% at −0.1 VRHE whereas the other photocathodes of Si, Bi/Si, and GaN/Si exhibited a low ABPE < 0.01% (Fig. S14†). In comparison to the electrocatalytic performance of the Bi film, Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes showed enormously improved onset potential, current density, and FEHCOOH under solar light (Fig. S15†). Thus, the synergetic electronic interaction between GaN NWs and Bi NPs enhanced the conversion rate of CO2 to HCOOH as well as the selectivity. Moreover, we measured the products in the anodic compartment to investigate the oxidation reactions at the counter electrode (Fig. S16†). When we applied cathodic potentials of −0.4 and −0.6 VRHE to the photocathode for 20 min, the faradaic efficiency of O2 was nearly 100%, confirming that the oxygen evolution reaction was the only reaction occurring at the Pt counter electrode in the anodic reactor.
The catalytic activity of the Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes was further investigated by tuning tBi (Fig. S17†). At tBi = 2 nm, increments of FEHCOOH and jHCOOH were not noticeable compared to GaN/Si (tBi = 0 nm) (Fig. 4f). However, deposition of 5 nm-thick Bi NPs dramatically increased the FEHCOOH to 88.0%, 98.3%, and 94.7% at −0.2, −0.4, and −0.6 VRHE, respectively. Accordingly, the maximum jHCOOH = 10.3 mA cm−2 was achieved at −0.6 VRHE. At a higher loading of Bi NPs (tBi = 10 nm), FEHOOCH and jHCOOH were slightly decreased to 87.0% and 8.2 mA cm−2 at −0.6 VRHE. The Bi NPs provide active sites for catalyzing the reaction. Thus, both FEHCOOH and jHCOOH first improved with tBi. However, overloading of Bi NPs can block the incident light and decrease the number of photogenerated electrons. The balance between the catalytic activity and optical transmittance of Bi NPs leads to an optimized thickness (tBi = 5 nm). The Bi/GaN/Si photocathode showed a high FEHCOOH > 90% for 12 h operation (Fig. S18†). It is therefore seen that Bi/GaN/Si is a promising photocathode for the PEC CO2 RR with prolonged stability.
In order to gain more insights into the possible impact of interfacial interaction between GaN NWs and Bi NPs on the CO2 RR activity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. Based on the TEM and XPS results that the outermost surface of Bi NPs featured the oxidized Bi species in the form of Bi2O3, Bi2O2CO3, or amorphous oxide/hydroxide, the Bi2O3/GaN (100) model was established to elucidate the interfacial interaction. The geometries of GaN (100) and Bi2O3 were optimized by considering the PEC CO2 RR under aqueous conditions (Fig. S19 and S20†). Then, the free energy diagram of reducing CO2 to HCOOH and CO with the corresponding fully relaxed configuration was calculated. On the GaN (100) surface, the limiting potential (μ) for CO2 reduction to HCOOH via the *OCHO intermediate was 2.10 eV and the μ for CO production via the *COOH intermediate was 1.93 eV (Fig. S21†). Due to the large thermodynamic potential barriers, the CO2 RR on the GaN surface is unfavorable. On the other hand, self-supported Bi2O3 significantly stabilized *OCHO relative to *COOH, leading to a dramatically reduced μ of 1.04 eV for HCOOH production (Fig. S22†). Most strikingly, the μ value for HCOOH production was further lowered to 0.95 eV at the surface of Bi2O3/GaN (100) whereas high μ (1.93 eV) was retained for CO production (Fig. 5a), indicating that the Bi2O3/GaN binary system predominantly converts CO2 to HCOOH rather than CO. These results indicate that the Bi2O3 cocatalyst supported on GaN NWs can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of HCOOH. The CO2 RR by Bi/GaN/Si followed the same reaction pathway as that of previous Bi-based catalysts through the *OCHO intermediate.51,52 However, it should be noted that Bi2O3/GaN binary system can further lower the thermodynamic energy barrier for HCOOH production by stabilizing the *OCHO intermediate compared to self-supported Bi2O3 or GaN. To visualize the strong electronic interaction between the Bi NPs and GaN NWs, the differential charge density at the Bi2O3/GaN (100) interface was shown (inset of Fig. 5a). After the junction, each interfacial Ga and Bi atoms lose a Bader charge of 0.878e and 0.549e, respectively. A net charge transfer of 0.329e was observed at the Bi2O3/GaN interface. Electron reduction (blue) was found near the Ga atoms while electron accumulation (yellow) was found near the neighboring O atoms, revealing the ionic Ga–O bond. Meanwhile, electrons accumulated in the middle region in between Bi and N atoms, suggesting the formation of the covalent Bi–N bond. The Ga–O and Bi–N bonds resulted in the stable anchoring of Bi NPs on GaN NWs.

The density of states (DOS) near the Fermi-level (Ef) of GaN was simulated for GaN and Bi2O3/GaN systems to investigate the electron transfer properties between GaN NWs and Bi NPs (Fig. S23†). It is notable that the DOS at the conduction band edge (2.3 < E–Ef < 4 eV) was enlarged after the incorporation of Bi2O3 on GaN. The enlarged DOS at this energy level was attributed to atomic Bi and O (Fig. 5b), indicating that the energy states of Bi2O3 were slightly lower than the conduction band edge of GaN. This conduction band alignment facilitates the spontaneous transfer of photoelectrons without notable charge carrier transfer resistance. The thermodynamically favorable HCOOH production on the Bi NPs and efficient charge carrier transfer from GaN NWs to Bi NPs induce photogenerated electrons to move towards the Bi NPs during the PEC CO2 RR. Although the Bi2O3/GaN model cannot fully explain all possible combinations of Bi–GaN binary systems, it is still a very important finding that the synergetic effect of the semiconductor and the cocatalyst enhances the catalytic activity compared to each single material.
Previously, Bi-based electrocatalysts have demonstrated promising catalytic activity for CO2 reduction to HCOOH by stabilizing the *OCHO intermediate. Interface engineering of two different materials has been an emerging strategy to promote catalytic performance. For instance, charge transfer at the interface between two different Bi-based materials led to optimizing the binding energy of adsorbates and lowered the thermodynamic energy barrier.53,54 The effect of the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface on catalytic performance, however, has been rarely investigated even though there have been many reports of the PEC CO2 RR to HCOOH by integrating photocathodes and cocatalysts (Table S2†). Thermodynamically feasible production of HCOOH by Bi2O3–GaN binary system compared to each material of Bi2O3 and GaN revealed that the design rule of heterogeneous catalysis can be applied to PEC reactions. Compared to the previous photocathodes, Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes presented in this study exhibited excellent PEC CO2 RR activity with a low onset-potential (0.2 VRHE), high FEHCOOH (98% at −0.3 VRHE), jHCOOH (10.3 mA cm−2 at −0.6 VRHE), and prolonged stability (12 h) due to beneficial Bi–GaN interaction. What is more, the PEC CO2 RR operated at a much lower applied bias than electrocatalysis using Bi-based electrocatalysts because the built-in-potential formed in the photocathode (n+–p Si) positively shifted the reduction potentials. In general, the design of photocathodes is more difficult than the fabrication of an electrocatalyst because it is necessary to consider not only the catalytic activity but also the light absorption and the interfacial electronic interaction between semiconductors and cocatalysts. Nevertheless, Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes showed excellent performance in terms of the catalytic activity, optical transmittance, and electronic band alignment, establishing a highly promising architecture for efficient and stable solar-fuel production.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the Bi NP catalyst supported on GaN/Si photocathodes is highly active and selective for the PEC CO2 RR to HCOOH. This unique design allows efficient solar light absorption and charge carrier transport, and further exposes the abundant catalytically active sites. Theoretical calculations suggest that the binary system consisting of Bi NPs and GaN NWs works in synergy for CO2 reduction and reduces the reaction energy barrier by stabilizing key reaction intermediates of OCHO*. As a result, Bi/GaN/Si photocathodes showed superior FEHCOOH ∼98.0% at −0.3 VRHE and jHCOOH = 10.3 mA cm−2 at −0.6 VRHE. Stable and continuous operation for 12 h was also demonstrated with a high FEHCOOH > 90%. The electronic interactions between the semiconductor and the cocatalyst to enhance the catalytic activity will help rationally design photoelectrodes in the future. The photocathode consists of industry-ready materials (Si, GaN, and Bi) providing a promising route for producing clean solar fuels from PEC CO2 reduction in an aqueous cell.
Experimental
Fabrication of Bi/GaN/Si photoelectrodes
The n+–p Si junction was first fabricated through a standard thermal diffusion process using a (100) Si wafer. Phosphorus and boron dopants were coated on two opposite sides of the polished p-Si (100) wafer by spin-coating and then annealed at 950 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h. Plasma-assisted MBE was used for growing GaN NWs on the Si wafer under nitrogen rich-conditions with a N2 flow rate of 1.0 standard cubic centimeter per minute. The substrate temperature was 790 °C and the growth duration was ∼2 h. The forward plasma power was 350 W with a Ga flux beam equivalent pressure (BEP) of 5 × 10−8 torr. Bi NPs were deposited on GaN NWs/Si by a thermal evaporation method with a deposition rate of 0.1 nm s−1 under a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 torr. The rate and thickness of Bi were in situ monitored by using a quartz crystal thickness monitor. Also, the thickness of the Bi film was double-checked on the planar Si wafer using a surface profiler.
Structural and optical characterization
SEM and EDS analysis were conducted using a PHILIPS XL30S with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a working distance of 6 mm. The HR-TEM and STEM equipped with an energy-loss spectrometer were conducted at 200 kV with a Cs-corrector using a JEOL JEM 2200FS. XPS was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB250i X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source at a base pressure <2 × 10−9 torr. Optical reflectance and transmittance were measured using a UV-visible spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Cary 4000) equipped with an integrating sphere. Optical reflectance of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) standard reflector was calibrated to 100% and that of the sample was calculated with the following equation:  where Isample and IPTFE are the detected light intensity reflected by the sample and PTFE standard reflector, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
LSV measurements were conducted in an H-type cell separated by a Nafion membrane with a three-electrode system using a potentiostat (Ivium Stat). Ag/AgCl filled with 3 M KCl was used as the reference electrode and Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode. Photocathodes were used as the working electrodes. The electrolyte used for PEC measurements was an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) prepared by dissolving the solid salt in deionized water. The electrolyte was saturated with CO2 gas (99.99%) before the measurements. The measured potential (VAg/AgCl) (V) can be converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) (V) by using the Nernst function: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.222 + 0.0592 × pH. The light source used for the illumination was a LS 150 xenon arc lamp (ABET Technologies). The light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated using a mono-silicon detector by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. All measurements were conducted under ambient pressure at room temperature.
Product analysis
Gas products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Inficon, 3000 Micro GC) equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs) connected to a Molsieve column and Plot U column. Before beginning the PEC CO2 RR, the apparatus was purged with CO2 gas for 3 min to remove other gases. During the reaction, gas was circulated within the reactor at a flow rate of 50 ml min−1. After the reaction, gas products were automatically pumped into the chromatograph for analysis. Liquid products (HCOOH) were analyzed using a 500 MHZ 1H 1D liquid NMR spectrometer (Bruker) at 25 °C. The standard solution was 5 mM N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in D2O (Sigma-Aldrich). The amount of HCOOH was calculated by integrating areas of the products with that of the standard solution.
Calculations
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method and the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) for exchange-correlation potential and implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.55,56 The conventional DFT energy was corrected by Grimme's method (D3) in order to describe van der Waals interaction properly.57 Dipole correction along the slab cell c-axis was employed due to the asymmetric layer arrangement. All GaN, Bi2O3 and Bi2O3/GaN composite slabs were constructed from the fully relaxed bulk structure of GaN and Bi2O3. Based on the crystallographic direction of GaN NWs and surface energy of Bi2O3,58 surface vacuum slabs with the (100) and (010) surfaces were fabricated, respectively. The thickness of the GaN and Bi2O3 slabs were controlled to be at least 12 Å, composed of 5 unit cells periodically along the direction perpendicular to the surface. To mimic the bulk-like properties, the bottom 2 layers were fixed while the surface 3 layers were fully relaxed. For the GaN–Bi2O3 composite slab, to alleviate the computational load, the thickness of the GaN slab was reduced to 3 layers. A (010) surface of the Bi2O3 single unit cell was placed on the most energetically favorable site of the fully relaxed GaN (100) surface followed by complete relaxation. The vacuum region of slab cells was set to be more than 15 Å, to avoid the artificial interaction between periodic images. For the GaN and Bi2O3/GaN slabs with rectangular cell modeling, Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling with a grid of 4 × 2 × 1 was used for the Brillouin zone integration.59 In the case of monoclinic Bi2O3, a gamma-centered k-point sampling of 4 × 4 × 1 was employed. An energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for the plane-wave representation of the wavefunctions. Atomic structures were relaxed until all the Hellman–Feynman forces were <0.01 eV Å−1 and the criterion for the electronic step convergence was 10−5.
