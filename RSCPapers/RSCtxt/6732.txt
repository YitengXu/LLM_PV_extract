    , Accepted 13th May 2019First published on 13th May 2019AbstractCu2−xSe nanoparticles (Cu2−xSeNPs) were camouflaged with a red blood cell membrane (RBC) to create nanoparticles with improved biocompatibility, longer blood retention times, excellent absorption properties, superior photothermal conversion efficiency (67.2%) and singlet oxygen production capabilities for the synergistic photothermal and photodynamic therapy of cancer in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window.
Phototherapy (which includes photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)) is considered one of the most promising therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment owing to unique characteristics such as high selectivity, non-invasiveness, and low toxicity when compared to traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy.1,2 In PTT cancer cell death is induced by photothermal agents which are excited by light to generate hyperthermia,3 while PDT employs photosensitizers to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS).4 Although PTT is effective for tumor ablation, uneven heat delivery in tumor sites can lead to tumor regrowth/reoccurrence.5 For PDT, the tissue penetration depth of the light used for excitation can cause considerable restrictions.6 In order to address the shortcomings of PTT and PDT, a combined photothermal agent and photosensitizer was developed. The majority of research reported thus far on phototherapy focuses on the first NIR (NIR-I) window (750–950 nm). Compared to the well-explored NIR-I window, the NIR-II window (1000–1350 nm) has the advantages of larger maximum permissible exposure (MPE, 1 W cm−2, American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers, ANSI Z136.1-2007) and deeper tissue penetration.7–10 Considering the advantages of both PDT and PTT as well as the benefits of agents which are activated in the NIR-II window, there has been a recent increase in interest in the fabrication of dual-functional agents for the simultaneous generation of heat and ROS under NIR-II light irradiation.
Based on the optimal photo-induced properties of PTT and PDT in cancer therapy, a reasonable combination of PTT and PDT is expected to produce synergistic therapeutic effects.11,12 Some materials, including Cu2(OH)PO4@PAA,13 TeO2/(NH4)xWO3 nanoribbons,14 CsxWO3 nanorods,15 have been used as dual-functional agents for synergetic phototherapy by 1064 nm laser and exhibit some anti-cancer effects. However, the in vivo applications of dual functional materials still faces many challenges, including low photothermal conversion efficiency, poor biocompatibility, and short circulation times. Recently, the biomimetic approach of nanomaterials camouflaged by natural cell membranes, has attracted particular attention due to the advantages of long circulation times, biodegradability, non-immunogenicity, and biocompatibility.16 As a most abundant and affordable biological carrier among the cell membranes, red blood cell (RBC) membrane has been used as biomimetic coating on nanomaterials with various functions.17,18
In this work, to improve the therapeutic efficiency of synergetic phototherapy in the NIR-II window, RBC membrane was used to camouflage a NIR-II absorptive Cu2−xSe nanoparticle (RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs), which has been well-developed for phototherapy in the NIR-I window19 but has not been explored for synergetic phototherapy in the NIR-II window. Specifically, the photothermal conversion efficiency (67.2%) of Cu2−xSeNPs in the NIR-II window is higher than in the NIR-I window and higher than most previous reports such as semiconducting copolymer nanoparticles (43.4%),20 Au@Cu2−xS core–shell nanocrystals (43.2%),21 2D niobium carbide (45.65%),22 and Cu3BiS3 nanorods (40.7%).23 The dual-function of heat and ROS production of the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was investigated under 1064 nm laser irradiation. The advantages given by the RBC membrane to the Cu2−xSeNPs were demonstrated. Systematic evaluation was conducted in vitro and in vivo to confirm the high efficacy of the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs as synergetic phototherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer.
Schematic illustration of the synthesis of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs and their use in phototherapy is shown in Scheme 1. In the design of nanoparticles for biological applications, surface chemistry is an essential factor. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) gave an average size of 53.0 ± 3.1 for Cu2−xSeNPs while dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement gave an average size of 75.0 nm (Fig. S1A and B, ESI†). After coating with RBC, the obtained RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs displayed a well-dispersed distribution. However, the size of the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was increased. The diameter measured by DLS was 161.2 nm, and the average diameter obtained by TEM was 152.5 ± 5.2 nm (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1C, ESI†). This indicates that several nanoparticles are packed into the red cell membrane under the physical pressure. The surface zeta potential of the Cu2−xSeNPs was −13.1 mV, while after fusing with the RBC, the surface zeta potential increased to −24.8 mV (Fig. S2A, ESI†). Next their stability in aqueous solution and DMEM (added 10% FBS) was assessed, the change in size confirmed that the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs were stable after five days storage, without obvious co-aggregation (Fig. S2B, ESI†).

To evaluate the photothermal performance of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs, the absorption spectrum of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was measured revealing strong absorption in the near infrared region, indicating that the RBC membrane coating process had made little change to the absorption properties compared to bare Cu2−xSeNPs (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2C, ESI†). The temperature change of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs exposed to 1064 nm NIR laser irradiation with the power of 0.8 W cm−2 at varying concentrations were recorded (Fig. S3A and B, ESI†). A rapid temperature increase was observed from 25.0 to 62.3 °C over 5 min with a Cu2−xSe concentration of 40 μg mL−1. RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs were then exposed to 1064 nm laser at various powers (0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 W cm−2) to evaluate the photothermal performance in comparison to pure water. RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs were shown to rapidly convert NIR light into thermal energy (Fig. S3C, ESI†).
In order to investigate the photothermal stability of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs, the temperature variation recycle curves of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs were measured. The photothermal performance of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs showed no apparent deterioration during the recycling (Fig. S3D, ESI†). Next, according to the reported formula,19 the photothermal-conversion efficiency (η) of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was calculated on the basis of the value of the time constant for heat transfer and the maximum steady-state temperature (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3E, ESI†), which was 67.2% for 1064 nm, obviously higher than other nanomaterials at NIR-II laser irradiation.
The photothermal properties of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs were compared in both the NIR-I and NIR-II windows, the temperature of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs irradiated at 1064 nm was significantly higher than those irradiated at 808 nm at all powers tested. The temperature change measured at various tissue depths under NIR-I and NIR-II laser irradiation revealed that, the photothermal and tissue penetration capabilities of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs irradiated at 1064 nm were superior to those measured under 808 nm irradiation (Fig. S3F and S4, ESI†).
ROS generation is usually a primary cause of cell death in effective PDT.24 The ROS generation of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was measured using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a sensor to analyse 1O2 production under 1064 nm laser irradiation over time. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), with the extension of the irradiation time, the absorbance intensity of DPBF was decreased significantly, showing that DPBF was oxidized by the generated 1O2. To further verify the ROS generated by the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum were applied to analyse the ROS generated under 1064 nm laser irradiation in 5 min (Fig. 1D). 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) is a typical spin trapping agent for detecting 1O2.

(B) The production of ROS in cells incubated with: (i) RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs, (ii) RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs with 1064 nm laser irradiation. (C) The images of HepG2 cells co-incubated with calcein AM (green) and PI (red) (Scale bars = 200 μm). 
Compared with a control, the results clearly show the typical signal peak of 1O2 and a higher signal intensity was obtained from RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs vs. the control.
The cellular uptake of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs by HepG2 over 24 h is shown in Fig. S6A and B (ESI†). The uptake increases with time. Moreover, according to previous reports,25 coating by RBC could be used to avoid immune clearance of the nanoparticles by reducing the uptake by macrophages. So we co-treated RAW264.7 cells with Cu2−xSeNPs and RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs for 6 h. These results further confirm that uncoated Cu2−xSeNPs display higher uptake than RBC coated Cu2−xSeNPs. These results indicate that RBC can effectively reduce macrophage uptake. The distribution of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was investigated in HepG2 cells (Fig. S7, ESI†). Bio-TEM results reveal the efficient internalization of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs by HepG2 cells in a time-dependent manner (at 6 and 12 h) and that the nanoparticles mainly locate in the lysosomes of the cells.
Based on these results, the anticancer properties of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs in vitro were further evaluated. The cytotoxicity was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. (Fig. 2A). No obvious toxicity of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was observed, which demonstrates their excellent biocompatibility due to the addition of RBC. In order to clarify the mechanism of the 1064 nm laser irradiation induced cytotoxicity, a low temperature (4 °C) phototoxic experiment to measure the PDT properties independent of the PTT properties was performed. The PTT properties were also assessed independent of PDT effects by using Vitamin C (VC) as a ROS scavenger. The experiments to test the separate effects of PTT and PDT, were performed at a concentration of 60 μg mL−1. The PDT induced cytotoxicity was found to be 50.0% while the cancer cell inhibition rate induced by PTT was found to be 64.6%. In contrast the combined PTT/PDT cancer cell inhibition rate was much higher at 88%. Additionally, the real-time thermographs after 5 min at different concentrations were measured in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The generation of ROS in the cellular environment was further confirmed by the intracellular ROS probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), which when oxidized by ROS displays green emission (Fig. 2B). In the control group, negligible green fluorescence was observed, while cells incubated with RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs green emission could be clearly seen, which shows that RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs can induce the production of ROS under 1064 nm laser irradiation. These results indicate that the combination of PTT and PDT markedly enhances anticancer efficacy, with PTT playing a predominant role. Live/dead cell assay was performed with calcein-AM and PI co-staining, to further confirm the results of the MTT experiments (Fig. 2C).
A hemolysis assay is normally used to assess the cytotoxic effect of nanoparticles,26 as shown in Fig. S9A (ESI†), bare Cu2−xSeNPs caused higher hemolytic activity than RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs, which is in agreement with the corresponding photographs of the erythrocytes (Fig. S9B, ESI†). These results demonstrate that encapsulation by RBC not only gave the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs enhanced stability but also reduced their hemolytic properties.
Encouraged by the nanoparticles excellent therapeutic effects in vitro, further phototherapy experiments were performed in vivo on HepG2 tumor-bearing mice. After intravenous (IV) administration of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs and Cu2−xSeNPs (6.6 mg kg−1), the tumor-bearing mice were exposed to 1064 nm NIR laser with a power density of 1.0 W cm−2, and the temperatures of the tumor location measured after 5 min irradiation. Rapid increase to 48 °C was observed with RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs which was higher than for Cu2−xSeNPs (43.7 °C). This may be due to the higher tumoral accumulation of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs (Fig. S10A and B, ESI†).
In order to compare the tumor-accumulation capacities of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs and Cu2−xSeNPs, their blood circulation and bio-distribution were investigated in the mice. The pharmacokinetic parameters suggested that the blood circulation half-time of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs was 2.14 h, which was 4.43 times to that of Cu2−xSeNPs after intravenous administration (Fig. 3A). After 24 h both of them mainly accumulated in the liver, lungs and spleen. However, compared with free Cu2−xSeNPs, RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs not only displayed increased tumoral accumulation, but also reduced uptake in the main organs (Fig. 3B). These excellent results are due to the prolonged blood circulation of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs compared to Cu2−xSeNPs.

To further assess the tumor inhibitory effect of the nanoparticles (Fig. 3C and D), the tumor volumes of mice were measured over 20 days. Those in the treated with nanoparticles and irradiated with 1064 nm laser showed significant decrease in tumor volume after 20 days treatment. The best result was observed for the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs + laser group. In contrast the tumors on the mice in the four control groups all grew rapidly. There were no obvious changes of the body weight in the tumor-bearing mice (Fig. S10C, ESI†), indicating the low biotoxicity and side effects of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs for phototherapy in vivo.
Hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) was used to stain the tumor sections to further display the synergistic PTT/PDT effect (Fig. S10D and S11, ESI†). The tumors of mice the four control groups displayed normal growth. In contrast there was more nucleus karyopyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis observed in the two groups treated with nanoparticles and irradiated. The results confirm the phototherapeutic properties of RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs on tumor proliferation.
In summary, novel RBC coated Cu2−xSeNPs with high photothermal conversion efficiency and the ability to produce singlet oxygen in the NIR II window were synthesized by a simple method for combined PTT/PDT cancer treatment. The RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs exhibited strong and broad absorbance in the NIR II window. Compared to most previously reported nanoparticles working in the NIR-II window, the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs showed an excellent PTT efficiency and a higher photothermal conversion efficiency (up to 67.2%) in the NIR-II window. Moreover, due to the RBC camouflage, the RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs displayed significantly prolonged circulation lifetime and improve tumor accumulation. It is important to note that RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs showed enhanced PTT/PDT effects in vitro and in vivo. These unique RBC@Cu2−xSeNPs with excellent biocompatibility and highly effective phototherapeutic properties are highly promising for future biomedical applications.
