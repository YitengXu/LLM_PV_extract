    , Accepted 9th August 2019First published on 13th August 2019AbstractThe commonly employed methyl-ammonium containing perovskites are unstable at high temperature or under moisture attack, thus limiting their commercial applications. To overcome this barrier, a new perovskite possessing both thermal stability and water resistance has been constructed, involving pyrrolidinium rings (CH2)4NH2PbI3 (PyPbI3), through a simple solution-processing method. It presents not only prolonged moisture resistance and a favorable bandgap of 1.80 eV, as determined by P-XRD and UV absorption, but also excellent thermal stability, as verified via the in situ XRD technique. The new structure may be applicable to perovskite solar cells with improved thermal stability and water resistance.
1. Introduction
With the rapid improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 24.2%1 in less than one decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely considered as a promising candidate for next generation photovoltaics due to their suitable bandgap,2 excellent absorption properties3 and simple solution-processing synthesis methods.4,5 However, despite their impressive performance, a major bottleneck of commercialization remains. PSCs are not only unstable in humid environments,6,7 but also show poor thermal stability at the working temperature8 (85 °C). The most commonly employed PSC material CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) was shown to be intrinsically thermally-unstable.8 In order to fight against the moisture instability alone, various strategies have been developed, including device encapsulation,9 and surface passivation,10 but little improvement has been achieved. As a result, replacing MA cations seems inevitable.8,11–13
Although replacement with various cations has been tested, such as formamidine (FA),14,15 hydrazine (HA)16 and many others,17 still none resolves the stability issue. This may be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of these cations.10,18 Therefore, a hydrophobic structure has been selected and introduced into the perovskite structure to enhance the water resistance in some recent attempts.19–24 In this regard, three-membered ring based aziridinium lead iodide has been simulated,25 which showed a theoretical bandgap as low as 1.49 eV and good water resistance. Yet, due to the extreme toxicity of aziridine,26 it is impractical to apply to real devices. Although such toxicity can be eliminated by applying a four-membered azetidinium ring-based perovskite AzPbI3, it raises the bandgap to 2.15 eV, which is significantly higher than that of both MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, resulting in a low PCE of less than 1%.27,28 Moreover, the structure of AzPbI3 is extremely distorted,27 because of the severe strain in the four-membered azetidine rings, which aggravates the thermal instability.
Based on these developments, a novel five-membered pyrrolidinium ring-based perovskite PyPbI3 was synthesized in our previous attempt,29 to release the strain on the Az cations. Such a structure was proved to be highly ordered and moisture stable,29 offering a possible solution to the long-standing moisture instability problem. However, the thermal stability of PyPbI3 remains uncertain, which is imperative, crucial, and needs to be investigated.
It is, therefore, the purpose of this study to resolve the stability problems in MA-based perovskites by investigating the thermal stability of PyPbI3. Based on the results of in situ X-Ray diffraction (XRD), UV absorption and photoluminescence, we were able to uncover the thermal stability of PyPbI3, which remains intact up to 135 °C, as well as to confirm the smaller bandgap of PyPbI3 (1.80 eV) than that of AzPbI3 (∼2.15 eV). In addition, PyPbI3 was found to possess enduring moisture resistance after exposure to ambient air for 4 months. These results not only make PyPbI3 a promising candidate for photovoltaics, but also present a possible solution to the long-standing stability problem of perovskite solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Film formation
1 mmol of pyrrolidinium hydroiodide (98%, TCI) and 1 mmol of lead iodide (99.999%, Sigma) were dissolved in 1 ml DMF (99.99%, Sigma), respectively. The drop casting method and spin coating method were adopted to fabricate the perovskite thin films. After annealing at 120 °C for 40 minutes, polycrystalline films were obtained from both methods. The structure was confirmed via P-XRD (Fig. S1, ESI†) and H-NMR spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†).
2.2 
          In situ XRD measurements
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the polycrystalline films were collected using a Bruker-AXS D8 DISCOVER X-ray diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.79026 Å) in the range of 8–78° (2θ) with a step size of 0.002° and a time setting of 0.1 s per step. For in situ XRD experiments, the films were placed in a sample chamber armed with a temperature-control stage. The thermal XRD patterns were collected every 30 minutes.
2.3 Characterization
UV-vis spectra were acquired from thin film samples at room temperature using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. The Tauc plot was used to estimate the bandgap of the material. The photoluminescence test is conducted using an Ar-ion laser (excitation wavelength = 514.5 nm) at room temperature from Melles Griot (35LAP431208) at a power of 130 mW with a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The PL signals were collected using a liquid N2-cooled silicon CCD. Scanning electron microscopy was carried out on a JEOL JSM-7000F instrument operating at a 0.1–5.0 kV landing voltage.
A Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer was used to acquire the FTIR spectra in the wavenumber range of 500–4500 cm−1 with a resolution of 1 cm−1 in DRIFT mode, dispersing the powdered samples in dry KBr powder.
TGA measurements on the PyPbI3 samples were performed using a Netzsch 409 PC Luxx station, with a temperature range from ambient to a maximum of 1600 Celsius.
3. Results and discussion
To investigate the thermal stability of PyPbI3, in situ XRD with a high temperature stage was employed. The initial temperature was set at 40 °C, and gradually increased to 135 °C. The temperature was held for 30 min for each stage. As shown in Fig. 1, no obvious change was observed in the XRD patterns for all stages, which indicated the thermal stability of PyPbI3. In addition, TGA measurements were also taken to evaluate the thermal stability of PyPbI3, as illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

Moreover, the XRD test also confirmed the long-term moisture resistance of PyPbI3 on a thin film sample which has been exposed to a humid environment for 4 months. Such a test is still of huge significance for the enduring stability even though the moisture stability of PyPbI3 has been previously tested via dripping water for 30 min.29 No decomposition was found in the XRD patterns, as indicated in Fig. 2, which presented excellent moisture resistance of PyPbI3. These results prove that PyPbI3 is stable not only at high temperature way above working conditions, but also in moist environments for an extensive period of time.

To further ensure the suitability of PyPbI3 in photovoltaic application, the bandgap needs to be determined, which is given by UV absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) tests. The onset of the absorption spectra is located at 660 nm, which reveals a bandgap of the material of 1.80 eV as derived from the Tauc plot, with an absorption coefficient of more than 104, as shown in Fig. 3. Such a result is consistent with the photoluminescence result (Fig. 4), which indicated the bandgap value of PyPbI3 (∼1.80 eV) is, indeed, significantly lower than that of AzPbI3 (∼2.15 eV), making it more promising for photovoltaic applications.

Other than the bandgap, another important factor that influences the device performance is the film morphology, which was detected by field emission SEM (JEOL JSM-7000F), as shown in Fig. 5. Clearly, the PyPbI3 thin film consists of many large grains, with an average size of 2–3 μm, which is comparable to that of other studies.4,27,30

The defect density and the conductivity of the crystal were found to be 2.3 × 1016 cm−3 and 0.0177 (Ohm cm)−1, respectively, following the method of the literature.31,32 The value is comparable to that of MA-based perovskites.33
3.2 Discussion
As demonstrated, PyPbI3 has presented exceptional thermal stability and long-term moisture resistance, which is in sharp contrast to the literature, where the usual MA and FA based perovskites show neither moisture resistance nor thermal/phase stability. Obviously, for practical solar cell applications, the PyPbI3 structure is much more favourable due to its outstanding thermal/moisture stability.
This superiority of the bandgap and stability is attributed to the unique 1D structure of PyPbI3, as illustrated in its single XRD patterns (Fig. S4, ESI†), which show a hexagonal structure, with the PbI2 inorganic chains arranged in a face sharing manner and organic pyrrolidinium cations embedded between them. One huge benefit of this face sharing arrangement is that it results in a larger volume in the inorganic cage than 3D perovskites, as compared in Table 1 and Fig. 6, where the intramolecular force is weakened and imposes little constraint on the rotation of the Py cation. As a result, the organic cation is free to move in the cage and this leads to 12-fold dipole orientations even at room temperature, as verified by our single crystal XRD29 and FTIR (Fig. S5, ESI†) results. Therefore, the room temperature phase of PyPbI3 remains at the working temperature.

The superb moisture resistance of PyPbI3 can be attributed to its unique ring structure, which is composed of pyrrolidinium cations. The hydrophobic nature of these cations stops the invasion of water molecules,13,19 and thus improves the moisture resistance of the perovskites.
Although the PyPbI3 only device is still under development, promising results were already obtained from PyPbI3 containing FAPbI3 devices with a PCE of 19.2%, in addition to much enhanced stability.
4. Conclusions
To summarize, ring based pyrrolidinium lead iodide was synthesized and investigated. The newly fabricated PyPbI3 exhibits not only outstanding humidity resistance after exposure to air for 4 months, but also excellent thermal stability up to 135 °C, which is significantly higher than the phase transformation temperature of commonly employed MAPbI3. In addition, PyPbI3 also possesses a suitable bandgap of 1.80 eV, which enables a theoretical PCE above 26%, as estimated by the Shockley–Queisser limit. Given that no phase transformation was found in PyPbI3 at the perovskite working temperature, it will be of great potential to replace the existing perovskite structures for solar cell application, not only with both the required stability and desired PCE, but also with stable device performance.
