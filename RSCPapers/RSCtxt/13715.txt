    , Accepted 30th May 2019First published on 31st May 2019AbstractHerein, we report a simple and effective strategy to synthesize perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with the sole ligand of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APS) protonated by HBr, exhibiting high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (up to ∼90%) and high stability in ethanol mixed with deionized water. Also, PQD with protonated APS (APS+-PQD) films were fabricated on a slide by centrifugal force for down-converted light emitting diodes (LEDs). In addition, the red shifts of the PQDs resulting from self-absorption and Fösrster resonance energy transfer (FRET) were observed for the first time.
Lead halide perovskites have attracted widespread interest in the past ten years, owing to their superb performance in optoelectronic applications. The power conversion efficiencies of solar cells using organic–inorganic lead halide hybrid perovskite thin films have improved from 3.8%1 to 23.3%2 over the past several years. However, the low exciton binding energy and numerous surface defects in the perovskite thin films limit their light-emitting performance. Perovskites have also been proved to be an ideal material for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers.3–10 Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) exhibit excellent optical and electrical performance.3–8,11–16 Thus, PQD films became an ideal substitute. Due to low formation energy, the PQDs can be prepared in various sizes and morphologies via simply tuning the precipitation temperature and the species of the ligand.12,17–20 The effect of the ligand on lead halide perovskite nanocrystals has attached great advantages to their functional applications. Unfortunately, the low formation energy leads to instability, which is fatally undermining their optoelectronic applications.21,22
Numerous efforts have been devoted to stabilizing PQDs. Li et al. synthesized core/shell perovskite nanocrystals consisting of a light emitting CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) core with a narrow band gap and a Cs4PbX6 passivating shell.23 Polymers (such as polystyrene) are also ideal materials to block polar reagents and moisture. Dong and co-workers synthesized well dispersed PQDs inside polymer matrixes by a swelling–deswelling microencapsulation strategy.24 Lin et al. prepared perovskite quantum dots @ polystyrene composite micron beads via a swelling–shrinking strategy in nonpolar toluene and hexane.25 Additionally, mesoporous materials (for example, mesoporous silica26–28) were also demonstrated as a model to cap PQDs. However, few coordination groups (such as carboxyl and amino groups) in the tunnel lead to a tremendous amount of surface defects. Thus, the PQDs capped by mesoporous materials exhibit low absolute PLQY. For high absolute PLQY, tremendous efforts have been devoted to passivating PQDs with double-ligand12 and triple-ligand surface engineering.8 Li and co-workers synthesized organic–inorganic lead halide hybrid perovskite nanocrystals with APS and oleic acid (OA).29 Zhang and co-workers have prepared CsPbBr3 @ SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles at the single-particle level.30
Compared to PQDs with double and triple ligands, PQDs with sole ligands possess much more advantages in permanent and homogenous monofunctionalization.31,32 However, PQDs with a sole ligand have met with limited success because of a low level of surface passivation.33 Thus, sole ligand stable PQDs with high PLQY have become the next crucial research direction for PQD-based molecular imaging, displaying sensors, and so forth.
Herein, we present a new strategy to synthesize APS+-PQDs by modified ligand-assisted re-precipitation reactions at room temperature. The as synthesized APS+-PQDs deliver both high absolute PLQY and stability. As shown in Scheme 1, we added hydrobromic acid and APS into the precursor simultaneously. The amine groups will obtain protons. Owing to the positively charged protonated amine groups, more Br− ions than Pb2+ were exposed to the surface of the nanocrystals (NCs), and the structure can enhance the PL intensity.6,34 Meanwhile, the hydrobromic acid promoted hydrolysis of APS, which is crucial for stabilizing PQDs. In contrast to PQDs with a sole ligand of OA, the PQDs with APS+ have an ultrahigh absolute PLQY (up to ∼90%) and exhibit robustness in ethanol mixed with deionized water. Moreover, the APS+-PQD films fabricated by centrifugal force were used to down-convert LEDs. The PL spectra of the PQD films were red-shifted in contrast to colloidal PQDs. Furthermore, CsPbBr3 PQDs with APS+ also exhibit strong PL intensity in the process of multi-photon absorbance below the band gap.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis process. 
Organic acid–base pairs are common surface ligands in the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots. In this paper, we used APS protonated by HBr as the sole ligand to mono-functionalize and stabilize the PQDs. Upon reacting, amine groups will obtain protons, bonding with Br− ions. Coordination between N and Pb atoms will be weak because of electrostatic repulsion. Meanwhile, APS will undergo hydrolysis catalyzed by HBr and then a polysiloxane shell will form on the surface of the perovskite NCs. Although polar groups (SiOx) are exposed to the surface of NCs, the as-synthesized PQDs show excellent stability and disperse uniformly in mixed solvents of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and toluene (Fig. S1, ESI†). On the surface of the perovskite NCs, a number of amine salt groups will replace Cs+ ions to form the Br-rich structure. Easily, the ionic bonding between Br− and protonated amine groups is stronger than coordination bonding between N and Pb. Thus, the Br-rich formation will enhance the stability of halide perovskite NCs.
The as synthesized CsPbBr3 PQDs with APS+ exhibit high PL. Fig. 1a exhibits the evolution of PL emission (full width at half maximum of all prepared perovskite NCs is ∼19 nm). With addition of HBr, the PL peak position shifts from 517 to 510 nm according to the PL emission. The blue shifts are confirmed by UV-visible spectra as well (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1 shows an obvious Stokes shift (∼25 meV). In Fig. S2 (ESI†) the two-dimensional spectra of APS+-PQDs showed that the PL peak positions were stable. APS+-PQDs also exhibit stronger PL intensity than OA/OAm PQDs in the process of multi-photon absorbance below the band gap (Fig. S3, ESI†) under 700 nm illumination. In fact, Xiao et al. observed highly efficient two-photon absorption with a cross section of 2.7 × 106 GM and Padilha studied the specific physical mechanisms.35,36 The result indicated that APS+-PQDs are also a good material for two-photon absorption.
 Fig. 1  (a) PL emission and (b) UV-visible spectra of APS-PQDs with 0 μL of HBr (black), APS+-PQDs with 20 μL (red) and 80 μL (blue) of HBr. 
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Fig. 2 show that the sizes of all samples decrease from ∼40 nm to ∼10 nm, which can explain the observed blue shift. The binding force between the ligand and the perovskite became larger with the increase of the added HBr amount, which suppressed the growth of QDs and thus decreased the sizes of the nanocrystals. The APS+-PQDs can be well-dispersed in the mixture of toluene and DMF (Fig. S1, ESI†). The assembled APS+-PQDs appeared owing to soft agglomeration (Fig. 2). The non-radiative Auger recombination can be suppressed because of the dense array of PQDs, according to previous work.16 Therefore, APS+-PQDs exhibit stronger PL intensity than OA/OAm PQDs in the process of multi-photon absorbance. The interplanar distances of 0.58 nm and 0.41 nm corresponded to the (100) and (110) planes of the CsPbBr3 cubic phase (Pmm). Meanwhile, the interplanar distances of 0.49, 0.40 and 0.34 nm were identified, corresponding to the (202), (104) and (300) planes of the Cs4PbBr6 hexagonal phase (Rc), respectively. The HRTEM images indicated that Cs4PbBr6 hexagonal phase appears in the process.

Fig. 3 show that the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the PQDs with APS+ confirmed the coexistence of cubic perovskite structure (JCPDS 54-0752) and rhombohedral Cs4PbBr6 hexagonal structure (JCPDS 73-2478) while the XRD patterns of PQDs with APS were only coincident with cubic phase perovskite (JCPDS 54-0752). The above results are also consistent with the planes in the HRTEM images (Fig. 2). Therefore, TEM images and XRD patterns confirm the occurrence of hexagonal phase. The appearance of hexagonal Cs4PbBr6 may be due to the Br-rich surrounding, by checking the synthesis process. All Br/Pb ratios measured by XPS were much larger than the stoichiometric ratio of lead halide perovskite, which demonstrated the richness of bromine on the surface of the APS+-PQDs (Table S1, ESI†). This phenomenon can be attributed to the following two reasons. First, the feed Br/Pb ratios are larger than the stoichiometric ratio of lead halide perovskite in the precursor, which provides adequate Br− ions. Second, on the surface of the perovskite NCs, the coordination bonds between amine groups and Pb2+ are lost when APS is protonated. Therefore, the Br/Pb ratios increased with increasing amount of HBr. The Br content may improve the suppression of the non-radiative pathway because increase of the Br/Pb ratio on the surface of the PQDs is coincident with the increase of PLQY.

The XPS spectra of Cs and Br elements in Fig. S4 (ESI†) were in agreement with previous work.6Fig. 4 presents the XPS spectra of APS+-PQDs with 0, 20, 40 and 80 μL of HBr, respectively. The two main peaks of N element in Fig. 4a can be assigned to the free amine groups (NH2) at low binding energy (∼399.0 eV)37 and protonated amino groups (NH3+) at high binding energy (401–402 eV).38 Obviously, the content of protonated amino groups (NH3+) increases according to the areas of the two main peaks. The protonated or hydrogen-bonded amino groups (NH3+) cannot bind with Pb2+ because of electrostatic repulsion. Instead, the positive protonated NH3+s bind with Br− ions, which may form Br-rich surfaces. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the results of the zeta potential measurements of APS and APS+-PQDs. The zeta potential measurements indicate that the as synthesized PQDs are positively charged, which can be attributed to protonated or hydrogen-bonded amino groups. Thus, the Br-rich surface can be credited to the electrostatic attraction between NH3+ and Br−. Fig. 4b shows high-resolution Pb 4f spectra with the main peaks corresponding to Pb 4f7/2 (∼138.0 eV). We can assign the small peak located at 136.4 eV to the presence of Pb(0).39–41 Interestingly, the Pb(0) does not exist in PQDs with 0 μL of HBr. The rich Br− solvent environment may lead to the existence of Cs4PbBr6.42–44 The occurrence of Cs4PbBr6 decreased more Br− ions than Pb2+ and the electrostatic attraction between NH3+ and Br− nailed some Br− ions. The above process may cause the presence of bromide vacancies in the perovskite lattice. Bromide vacancies coupled with electrons, in other words polarons, may lead to the appearance of Pb(0). Practically, the Pb(0) in the perovskite lattice caused by bromide vacancies decreases as HBr increases, which corresponds to the areas of XPS for Pb in Fig. 4b.

The effect of a Br-rich surface on PL was studied using time-resolved PL decay spectra. Fig. S6 (ESI†) presents PL decays of PQDs prepared with 0, 20 and 80 μL of HBr. The average lifetimes (τave) were 15.01, 11.66 and 13.84 ns, respectively. The longer lifetimes usually indicate less surface defects and the generated excitons are more likely to recombine via a radiative pathway, which can lead to a higher PLQY.45 However, the APS-PQDs exhibited longer average lifetimes but lower PLQY than that of APS+-PQDs.
In order to reveal the details, the radiative lifetimes (τr) and nonradiative lifetimes (τnr) can be calculated according to PLQY and τave as follows: (1) (2) (3) (4)
where τ is the observed lifetime, kf is the radiative recombination rate constant and  is the nonradiative recombination rate constant. τr and τnr are listed in Table 1. It is obvious that both kf and  influence the PLQY. If nothing else, smaller  or, in other words, larger τnr leads to higher PLQY.

Furthermore, according to Fermi's Golden Rule20 the equation of the radiative recombination rate, kf, was given as follows kf ∝ fl2ω3|deh|2(5)where fl is a local field factor related to the difference between the dielectric constant of the NCs and the surrounding medium, ω is the transition frequency, and deh is the dipole transition matrix element owing to the overlap of the electron and hole wavefunctions for the radiative recombination process. The sizes of APS+-PQDs are smaller than those of APS-PQDs according to Fig. 2. The smaller sizes lead to larger ω according to the quantum size effect. Moreover,  of APS+-PQDs is smaller than that of APS-PQDs because the Br-rich surface of APS+-PQDs can suppress the nonradiative pathway. Thus, the APS-PQDs exhibited longer average lifetimes but lower PLQY than APS+-PQDs. Furthermore, the decrease of Br vacancies in the NCs led to smaller  or, in other words, larger nonradiative lifetimes. If nothing else, according to eqn (2) smaller  leads to higher PLQY. All of the above results indicate that our process improves the optical performance of PQDs with a sole ligand. Compared to the APS-PQDs, the APS+-PQDs have higher PLQY.
To better explore the structure of the as obtained PQDs, we investigated the ligands by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The band peaks at 1042 cm−1 and 1120 cm−1 can be assigned to asymmetric stretching of Si–O–Si from the silica shell,46 which can help stabilize the PQDs in a polar solvent such as ethanol mixed with deionized water. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows that the FTIR spectra of the PQDs heated at 100 °C under vacuum remained nearly the same as shown by the PQDs without annealing, which indicates that a silanol dehydration reaction can happen at room temperature. The polysiloxane layers are bonded to the core nanocrystals by ionic bonds between Br− ions and protonated amine groups. According to the above results, it is obvious that we synthesized highly stable PQDs capped by polysiloxane. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the PL intensity of the PQDs in the ethanol/water mixed solvent. Clearly, compared to PQDs with ligands of OA and OAm, the PQDs with HBr and a ligand of APS exhibit better stability.
The PQD films were prepared on slides by centrifugal force for optical applications. Interestingly, as Fig. 5 shows, the red shifts of emission peak position were observed for the first time, to the best of our current knowledge. The peak positions of APS+-PQDs shifted from 510 to 517 nm while the peak positions of APS-PQDs shifted from 516 to 532 nm. It is difficult to wash APS+-PQDs from their films. We have to analyze the sizes from Urbach energy. The Urbach energy of the APS-PQDs decreases from 14.32 to 5.60 meV, which indicates that the sizes of the APS-PQDs may increase. Unlike APS-PQDs, APS+-PQDs have no obvious change in Urbach energy. The results indicate that APS+-PQDs are more stable than APS-PQDs.

Nag et al. reported that self-absorption and FRET have limited influence on PQDs, by observing the optical performance of dilute colloidal PQDs.15 It should be noted that their work was based on the observation on dilute colloidal PQDs. To reveal the details of the red shifts, the OA/OAm-PQDs washed from the films by 1-octadecene were compared with OA/OAm-PQDs in terms of size. In fact, the red shifts appear with increasing concentration, according to Fig. 5a. As Fig. 6 shows, the average diameter of the OA/OAm-PQDs washed from the films is 14.2 nm, which is close to the 13.8 nm of OA/OAm-PQDs. Clearly, the red shifts are independent of the quantum size effect. As Table S3 (ESI†) shows, the Urbach energy of OA/OAm-PQDs is about 45 meV and shows no obvious change when the concentration of PQDs increases. All of the above results indicate that the red shifts of the APS+-PQDs may be attributed to self-absorption and FRET. In this process, the larger nanocrystals reabsorb the light emitted by smaller nanocrystals in the PQD films and weaken the emission of smaller nanocrystals.

Down-converted LEDs were built up by coating the APS+-PQDs on an ultraviolet chip. As Fig. 7 shows, the down-converted LEDs emitted bright green light and the color coordinates are (0.0805, 0.6906).

Conclusions
In summary, efficient and stable PQDs, using APS+ as the sole ligand, have been prepared at room temperature. Our investigation suggests that the content of HBr in the precursor may play a key role in the suppression of nonradiative recombination. The protonated amine groups (NH3+) replace the Cs+ ions on the surface of perovskite NCs, which reduces the content of lead element on the surface. XPS spectra demonstrate that the Br/Pb ratios are more than normally observed, which leads to Br-rich surfaces. The strong ionic bond between the protonated amine groups and Br− ions and the polysiloxane shell stabilize the PQDs in an ethanol/water mixture. Of course, our strategy can also be applied to other amine ligands such as OAm, which opens a new library for surface engineering of PQDs. We also fabricated down-converted LEDs by coating the APS+-PQDs on ultraviolet chips. The red shifts of the PQDs caused by self-absorption and FRET were observed for the first time. The PLQY was increased from 46% to 90% by protonating the free amine groups of the ligand in our work. The results can help researchers design new shells of PQDs with high PLQY.
