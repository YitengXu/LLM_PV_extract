, Accepted 31st July 2013First published on 1st August 2013AbstractTo achieve sustainable growth of human society, fossil fuels must eventually be replaced with renewable resources. Ultimately, the energy and carbon in fuels and chemicals synthesized must come from the sun and CO2 directly. Biological systems hold the promise to catalyze the synthesis of such fuels or chemicals. This article discusses recent advances in developing biofuel production processes from CO2, which include photosynthetic processes using algae and cyanobacteria and the non-photosynthetic “electrofuel” processes using Ralstonia eutropha and other lithoautotrophic microorganisms. Each of these processes involves strengths and weaknesses. While none of these processes have achieved industrial success, the challenges involved may point the direction for further improvement within the limit of theoretical possibility. Finally, all biological processes produce cell mass rich in protein. Regenerating ammonium by deamination of hydrolyzed proteins may close the loop of the global nitrogen cycle, which is also one of the major challenges in large scale biological processes.

Broader context
An ideal and sustainable fuel and chemical production process should derive energy from sunlight and carbon skeleton from CO2 directly. Photosynthetic microorganisms have the capability to accomplish these tasks by coupling the so-called “light reaction” of photosynthesis (converting solar energy to biochemical energy) to the “dark reaction” and subsequent carbon metabolism (converting CO2 to fuel). Alternatively, the light reaction can be replaced with man-made devices such as photovoltaic cells. Biologically accessible energy converted from photons or photovoltaic electricity can then drive the carbon fixation reactions to produce a desirable compound using metabolically engineered pathways. To close the nitrogen cycle, the protein in the cell mass generated can be deaminated to regenerate ammonia while producing more carbon-based fuels or chemicals.

Introduction
Fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas supply about 82% of US's total energy need.1 While the total reserve of fossil resources on earth is finite, our energy consumption grows at a stunning rate of about 30% every decade.2 This situation is certainly not sustainable in the long run. The energy problem is further complicated by short-term geopolitical and economic instabilities. Moreover, CO2 produced from fossil fuel combustion has been implicated to contribute to climate changes. These reasons argue for an eventual replacement of fossil energy sources. In particular, fossil-derived liquid fuels constitute more than 90% of the energy used in the transportation sector, which cannot be replaced unless major changes in infrastructure are in place.
To achieve sustainability, the energy must ultimately come from the sun, and the carbon skeletons of liquid fuels must be derived from CO2. In general, solar energy harvesting and CO2 reduction can be accomplished using either man-made devices or biological systems (Fig. 1). Each has its pros and cons. Solar energy harvesting using man-made devices has achieved reasonably high efficiency (10–45%), but the energy is output in the form of electricity, whose storage remains problematic for transportation applications. Also, CO2 reduction to liquid fuels by man-made processes is heretofore inefficient and non-specific. On the other hand, biological systems have utilized photosynthesis to capture solar energy and reduce CO2 to biomass for millions of years. The typical photosynthesis efficiency from solar to biomass energy is less than 1% for plants, although the opportunity for improvement is enormous thanks to the advances in genomic and molecular biology tools. In particular, biological reduction of CO2 to make long-chain reduced carbon compounds is effective and specific for CO2 re-utilization. With metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools, biological systems can be tailored to make compounds of interest with specific structures and conformations. This capability cannot be easily achieved using non-biological methods.
 Fig. 1  General schemes of solar energy harvesting and carbon fixation by biological and artificial approaches. Man-made devices are relatively efficient for solar energy harvesting and reducing power generation; while biological metabolic pathways are more versatile and specific for synthesis of carbon-based fuels and chemicals from carbon dioxide. A hybrid process that combines the artificial “light reaction” and the biological “dark reaction” has been recently proposed and demonstrated. 
Typically, biological fuel production processes depend on plant biomass. In particular, gasoline and diesel substitutes have been produced using engineered microbial catalysts from biomass-derived substrates, including simple sugars,3–9 cellulose,10,11 and minimally treated biomass.12 However, the harvesting, processing, and decomposing of recalcitrant biomass are still challenging.13
The capability of biological systems to catalyze fuel production from biomass can be extended to CO2. Thus, instead of plants, CO2-fixing microorganisms can be metabolically engineered to produce liquid fuels directly, bypassing the lignocellulose processing issues. In this scenario, CO2 fixation does not strictly depend on light. The CO2-fixing “dark reactions” in autotrophic microorganisms can be powered by energy and reducing equivalence derived from a variety of sources in addition to solar energy. However, the energy needed for CO2 fixation must ultimately come from the sun. The conversion of solar energy to drive biological CO2 fixation and fuel production can again be accomplished using two approaches (Fig. 1): biological or non-biological. In the former case, the cell utilizes the complete system of photosynthesis, including both the light and dark reactions, and directly produces liquid fuel. In the latter approach, a man-made device is used to harvest sunlight in the form of electricity, which then powers the biological production of fuels from CO2. Such processes have been dubbed “electrofuel” production.
Neither approach competes with food crops for farmland and bypasses the recalcitrance problem of lignocellulose, while fully capitalizing on the biological capability to synthesize liquid fuels with high specificity and efficiency. We discuss below the recent progress and remaining challenges in these strategies.
Biofuel production from photosynthetic microorganisms
The first scenario of photosynthetic production of fuel without lignocellulosic biomass is to utilize algae. The extraordinary capacity of some algal species to accumulate lipids has made them attractive candidates for biofuel production (Fig. 2). It has been proposed that algal biofuel can replace the petroleum usage of the whole United States by only using less than 4% of the land area of the country, which compares favorably with other biofuel crops such as corn and oil palm.14 Previously, the majority of the work was focused on isolation and selection of algae species with supreme lipid accumulation levels, fast growth rate, simple nutrient requirement, and high light-utilization efficiencies.15 Recently, the development of next-generation sequencing and molecular biology technologies has made the targeted engineering of algal metabolism possible. For example, under conditions which favor the triacylglycerol accumulation in algae such as nitrogen and sulfur deprivation conditions, the genes that showed differential expression have been identified using high throughput RNA-sequencing technologies,16,17 which provided insight into the cellular regulation of the lipid metabolism. Such advanced technologies are expected to improve algal oil production significantly.

To produce fuels and chemicals directly from CO2 without going through lipid synthesis, cyanobacteria are the organisms of choice. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotic microorganisms and are more tractable for genetic engineering. For example, synthetic pathways have been introduced into two of the model organisms Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the production of ethanol,18 isobutyraldehyde,19 isobutanol,19 1-butanol,20,21 isoprene,22 ethylene,23 2-methyl-1-butanol,24 2,3-butanediol,25 and 1,2-propanediol26 (Fig. 2). In addition, cyanobacteria produce an array of alkanes with diverse carbon numbers and structures27,28 (Fig. 2), some of which are only found in cyanobacteria. Recently, the genes responsible for alkane production in cyanobacteria have been identified and characterized.5 Although simpler than algae, metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria takes considerably more time and effort compared with other commonly studied and industrially utilized prokaryotes. The difficulties lie in multiple copies of the genome that present problems in genetic knockout,29,30 the limited number of well characterized and controllable promoters and other genetic tools,31 and the relatively poorly characterized metabolic regulation compared with the traditional industrial hosts.
Although suggested to be scalable, these biofuel production processes using photosynthetic microorganisms still need to overcome substantial challenges to be economically viable. First, the efficiency of biological photosystems is constrained by the nature of the biological molecules used, which can only utilize radiation within a limited spectrum. As a consequence, about 50% of solar energy cannot be used.32 Second, the biological photosystems have not been optimized for the maximal energy conversion when light is abundant. Therefore the efficiency of solar energy capture is also limited by the saturation effect and other complex cellular regulations.32,33 Third, large-scale culturing of photosynthetic organisms represents a new bio-production paradigm that requires large two-dimensional (2D) light exposing surface areas, since sufficient light exposure is only available within a layer of around 20 centimeters from the surface. Compared to the conventional three-dimensional (3D) microbial fermentation processes, which have been used in the industrial scale for centuries, the 2D process still requires substantial breakthroughs to be economically competitive. For example, the open-pond culture faces the difficulties in nutrient delivery, product collection, culture maintenance, and water loss.34 Alternatively, closed photo-bioreactors may be needed to maximize sunlight utilization and cell growth,14,35,36 particularly for genetically modified organisms. However, the cost is inevitably increased. In addition, the product toxicity issue in photosynthetic chemical and fuel production needs to be addressed. Higher alcohols may disrupt the structure of the cell membrane, which contains the essential light harvesting apparatus of photosynthesis. For example, it has been reported that cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942 showed significant growth retardation with 750 mg L−1 isobutanol19 or 600 mg L−1 2-methyl-1-butanol.24 In situ removal of the product might be one solution,19 which may require closed photo-bioreactor systems in a large scale. Alternatively, strain evolution and genetic engineering may yield production strains with higher tolerance. In-depth understanding of the cell physiology in photosynthetic microorganisms is needed.
Electrofuel: separation of light and dark reactions
The expense of direct photosynthetic production of fuels largely lies in the cost of 2D photo-bioreactors, which are needed to distribute light throughout the culture. On the other hand, the traditional 3D microbial bioreactors that can hold a large amount of cultures in the bulk of the bioreactor are relatively inexpensive, but cannot distribute light to the bulk. One way to circumvent the need for photo-bioreactors is to separate the “light” and “dark” reactions of the photosynthesis process, so that the light reactions can be substituted by man-made photovoltaic solar panels or wind turbines. Both devices generate intermittent electricity, which causes a major problem in storage. If the intermittent electricity can be utilized to drive the “dark reactions” in a bulk bioreactor, the electricity storage problem can be solved and the need for a 2D photo-bioreactor can be avoided. In addition, this approach could have better sun-to-fuel efficiency. For example, plants growing at the current average growth rate of 1 kg biomass dry weight per m2 per year in the United States capture only about 0.28% of the incident solar energy,37 whereas man-made solar cells collect energy from sunlight and generate electricity with relatively high efficiencies ranging from 10 to 40%.38,39 The high sunlight harvesting efficiencies will greatly reduce the land usage.37 Furthermore, it expands the boundaries of biofuels by exploring the vast repertoire of lithoautotrophic microorganisms which can fix CO2 in the dark and have diverse metabolic and physiological features. For example, while the photosynthetic plants, cyanobacteria, and algae used for traditional biofuel production utilize the Calve–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle exclusively for CO2 fixation, a number of other CO2 fixation pathways, such as the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, exist in lithoautotrophic microorganisms which have higher energy efficiencies40 (Fig. 2).
Direct electron transfer to CO2-fixing microorganisms
Transfer of electrons to the microbes can occur either directly from an electrode or indirectly through an electron mediator (Fig. 3). Early studies have suggested that some species such as Geobacter metallireducens41 are able to accept electrons directly from electrodes as the respiration electron donor. It has also been suggested that electricity can directly drive methane production from CO2 by a microbial biofilm containing predominantly a methanogen, Methanobacterium palustre.42 Recently, a broad range of microorganisms including Sporomusa species, Clostridium species, and Moorella thermoacetica have been demonstrated to be able to accept electrons directly from the electrode and produce native fermentation products such as acetate and 2-oxobutyrate from CO2 (ref. 43 and 44) (Fig. 2). These processes achieved high current efficiencies with low overpotential. Moreover, one of the organisms that is shown to be capable of accepting electrons directly from electrodes, Clostridium ljungdahlii,45 has recently been engineered to produce 1-butanol, a gasoline substitute, from fructose. The results indicated the possibility that the direct electron transfer approach may be used to make liquid fuels using CO2 and electricity.
 Fig. 3  Direct and indirect methods to transfer electrons to the microorganisms. (a) Hydrogen and formate as the mediators to deliver electrons to engineered Ralstonia eutropha cells for higher alcohol production from carbon dioxide. (b) Ammonia as the electron donor for the autotrophic growth of Nitrosomonas europaea cells. (c) Reduced neutral red (NRH) delivers electrons to support growth and fumarate reduction in Actinobacillus succinogenes. (d) Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans can utilize Fe2+ as the energy source to power carbon fixation and support growth. (e) A broad range of microorganisms including Sporomusa species, Clostridium species, and Moorella thermoacetica accept electrons directly from the electrode and produce native fermentation products such as acetate from CO2. (f) A microbial biofilm containing predominantly a methanogen, Methanobacterium palustre, directly obtains electrons from the cathode to drive methane production from CO2. Acetate was also present to support the growth of the biofilm. 
However, several biological and engineering difficulties have to be considered. First, fundamental metabolic engineering barriers need to be overcome for the production of non-native liquid fuels. These anaerobic acetogenic microbes do not perform respiration and rely largely on fermentative pathways to generate ATP. If the carbon flux is diverted away from the native fermentation product formation, the overall fuel yield may be drastically reduced due to energy deficiency.40 To solve this problem, basic energy conversion mechanism and metabolic regulations in these organisms need to be understood. Alternatively, acetate produced by acetogens from CO2 can be fed to an aerobic organism in a separate reactor to produce long carbon chain products.46 Second, direct electron transfer involves a 2D biofilm-based production process,47 which enjoys the favorable features of long-term stability and robustness in lab scales but has not been used in industrial scales.48,49 For the microbes to accept electrons, they need to be constrained to the biofilms on the electrodes. As such, a large electrode surface area is needed to support large scale production, which represents higher cost and requires specially designed bioreactors.
Delivery of electrons to microbes via carriers
Alternatively, electrons can be delivered to the microbes via chemicals (Fig. 3). To be sustainable in a large scale, these carriers need to be derived from electrochemical reactions with minimal cost and without adverse environmental effects. Hydrogen and formic acid are two top choices for this purpose (Fig. 3). Hydrogen has a low solubility in water, which significantly limits its mass transfer rate from the gas phase to the microbes in the liquid phase. In addition, the safety issues associated with hydrogen utilization will increase the cost in large scale manufacturing. The direct electron transfer from the electrode to the microbes mentioned above may overcome the mass transfer issue, but replace it with other challenges in scale up. Alternatively, soluble electron carriers could be used such as formic acid. Formic acid is highly soluble in aqueous solution with no safety issues. It can also be produced electrochemically using water and CO2.50 Furthermore, the formate utilization pathway is present in a broad range of microorganisms. Other inexpensive, non-toxic electron carriers are also possible, but large-scale environmental impact needs to be considered.
Hydrogen generated from water splitting can be used as the energy and electron source for lithoautotrophic organisms. Current electrolytic hydrogen generation processes have high energy efficiencies of more than 50%.39,51 By coupling with solar photovoltaics or wind energy, the estimated price of renewable hydrogen (∼3.6 to 7.6 $ per kg) is closer to that of natural gas derived hydrogen (∼1 to 2 $ per kg).52 Recently, photo-electrochemical cells using earth-abundant materials have been actively studied as another method to split water using solar energy.52–55 The photo-electrochemical cells mimic the natural photosynthetic light reactions in that they both convert solar energy to chemical energy in H2 equivalents. The remaining challenges are (1) capturing the energy in H2 and converting to biologically usable reducing equivalents; (2) reducing CO2 to universal metabolic building blocks such as pyruvate and acetyl-CoA; and (3) knitting the carbon–carbon bonds using the building blocks to produce fuels with desired structures.56
A wide range of lithoautotrophic microorganisms can use hydrogen as the energy source, among which Ralstonia eutropha has been well studied as the model organism.57 R. eutropha is facultative chemolithoautotrophic and has the unique oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenases, which confer ease of handling and make the organism a favorable host for metabolic engineering and large scale production. Recently, biosynthetic pathways for branched-chain higher alcohols (isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol) have been introduced to R. eutropha58,59 (Fig. 2). The engineered strain produced ∼1 g L−1 higher alcohols from CO2 using electrochemically produced hydrogen as the sole energy source.58 These results demonstrated the feasibility of electrofuel production using H2 as the intermediate, and the biocatalysts of potentially higher efficiencies are yet to be explored. For example, the thermophilic hydrogen-utilizing bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus has been shown to use the reductive TCA cycle for CO2 fixation,60,61 which has higher energy efficiency than the CBB cycle in R. eutropha. It has also been suggested that the highly efficient 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) CO2 fixation cycle in thermophilic archaea might be introduced into a genetically tractable, hyperthermophilic, and hydrogen-utilizing host such as Pyrococcus furiosus.62,63
As discussed above, the low solubility and the safety concerns of hydrogen represent a major hurdle for its utilization in a large scale bacterial culture system. To overcome this problem, formate can be used as an electron carrier instead of hydrogen. In addition to being produced by electrochemical reduction of CO2,50 it is also a major byproduct in chemical conversion of biomass.64 Similar to hydrogen, multiple lithoautotrophic organisms are known to utilize formate as the electron donor by using formate dehydrogenases that produce NADH from formate while releasing CO2 as the substrate for the CBB cycle.58 The engineered R. eutropha described above58 was also able to produce ∼1.2 g L−1 higher alcohols using formate as the sole carbon and energy source.
To demonstrate the direct conversion of electricity to liquid fuel, an integrated electro-microbial bioreactor was constructed using formate as an electron transfer intermediate.58 In this system, both electrochemical production of formate and biochemical conversion of formate to fuel are conducted in the same reactor, thus avoiding the separation cost of formate and minimizing the back reaction of the electrochemical system. In this system, the formic acid is formed by the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in the aqueous solution using indium as the cathodic catalyst. The formic acid produced is utilized by the engineered Ralstonia cells to generate CO2 and NADH. Thus, formate serves as a carrier to deliver both CO2 and the reducing equivalent to the cell. CO2 is then converted to higher alcohols, isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, through the CBB cycle and the engineered fuel production pathway.3 One complication of this integrated electro-microbial production system is that the reactive compounds may be generated from the anode reaction in the microbial growth medium. In particular, the generation of nitric oxide and superoxide was detected and suggested to trigger cellular response as demonstrated using a transcriptional reporter system.58 This problem is reminiscent of the challenges in biological photosystems, where reactive species are commonly generated. Instead of relying on the sophisticated biological anti-stress systems, the problem of free radicals generated in the electro-microbial system was mitigated by shielding the anode from the bulk of the reactor. Alternatively, medium optimization and other anode coating methods could be developed for further improvement of efficiency.
Other alternative electron carriers have also been reported (Fig. 3). Growth of the lithoautotroph Nitrosomonas europaea using CO2 and electricity-generated ammonia is one example.47 In this case, N. europaea cells utilized the reducing energy in ammonia and secreted the oxidized end product nitrite, which was continuously recycled to a separated electrochemical module and reduced back to ammonia with around 100% current efficiencies. The challenge of this system is the low growth rate and the evaporation of ammonia from the system, causing drop in efficiency. Another chemolithoautotroph Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans can utilize Fe2+ as the energy source to power carbon fixation,65–67 which makes it another attractive host for electrofuel production. Some artificial redox carriers such as neutral red can also be used to introduce reducing energy to biological systems to drive metabolism,68 which suggests the possibilities that novel artificial electron carriers with different chemical properties could be designed to deliver electrons to desired microorganisms. However, the cost for their large scale production and environmental impacts need to be addressed.
Electrofuels as a means for electricity storage
The current method of electricity storage via batteries suffers from the low energy density, which generally ranges between 0.1 and 0.7 MJ kg−1 (or 0.5–2.0 MJ L−1).69 In contrast, the energy density of gasoline is around 45 MJ kg−1. Given the limited on-board space in the vehicles, the low energy density of batteries greatly hampered their usage in the transportation sector. Although major innovations in lithium-ion battery technology have been made recently,70–73 five times greater energy densities are required for the future all-electric vehicles to have a 300–400 mile driving range.73 To match the performance of internal combustion engines in the global scale, batteries with orders of magnitude higher energy densities may be necessary. Alternatively, electrolytic water splitting can store electrical energy in chemical bonds in H2 molecules with efficiencies higher than 50%. However, the volumetric energy density of H2 is low (5.6 MJ L−1 at 700 bar and 8.5 MJ L−1 as liquid hydrogen) and H2 utilization in the transportation sector remains difficult. The development of electrofuels provides a promising approach for storing intermittent electricity, such as solar and wind power-generated electricity, in the form of liquid fuels that can be used for transportation directly.
Nitrogen recycling for biofuel production systems
As discussed, liquid fuels can be directly produced using CO2 by photosynthetic or lithoautotrophic microorganisms. The production of such fuels and their subsequent combustion forms a closed carbon cycle and thus reduces the net carbon emission. However, many nutrients required in the biological fuel production schemes are utilized in a one-pass, non-recyclable manner, among which the reduced nitrogen (ammonium) is required in the greatest amount56,74–76 for the synthesis of proteins and nucleotides. Some cyanobacteria species can produce ammonium from nitrogen in the air,77–79 which may represent an opportunity to solve the problem. However, most autotrophic microorganisms mentioned above do not fix nitrogen. Thus, conventional agriculture as well as future biological production of fuels must rely on the artificial nitrogen reduction process, known as the Haber–Bosch process, to provide ammonium as the nitrogen source. This process is energy intensive and environmentally unfriendly. And the nitrogenous nutrients used in biological production are currently not recycled.
To close the nitrogen cycle, ammonium needs to be freed from the biomass residues of microbial fermentation and reused to build new biocatalysts (Fig. 4). Moreover, it would be ideal if the deaminated carbon skeletons in protein-rich biomass residues could be converted to fuels or chemicals. The traditional ways for biomass residue treatment include anaerobic digestion,80,81 which employs a series of reactions carried out by acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the absence of oxygen. The process can convert biomass to CO2 and methane, while releasing other mineral nutrients. The intermediate product hydrogen and the final product methane can be used as biofuels.80 Recently, a new approach has been demonstrated.74 Microbial cells were engineered to produce higher alcohols from waste protein with high yield.74 Nitrogen metabolic pathways in E.coli were redesigned to strip amino groups from amino acids, and higher alcohol production pathways were introduced to convert the carbon skeletons of amino acids into fuels.
 Fig. 4  Nitrogen recycling for biofuel production systems. To achieve nitrogen neutral biofuel production, ammonia and carbon portions in the protein waste are separated. The free ammonia is fed back to the microbial process as a nutrient. And the carbon skeletons of the amino acids are converted to the biofuel product. Overall, thanks to the nitrogen recycling process, the input of the biofuel production system are only sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. And the output is biofuels. 
To realize the potential of nitrogen recycling from the biomass waste, other studies have been focusing on optimizing the treatment process of biomass to release amino acids and other constituents.82,83 Alternatively, microorganisms have also been engineered to display proteases on the surface and can utilize proteins directly.84
The use of protein-rich biomass residuals achieves several advantages, including closing the nitrogen cycle, and increasing the overall energy and carbon yield of biological processes. In addition, it allows the use of algae biomass and animal wastes as resources to derive ammonia as a nutrient and carbon compounds as fuel. When used in the algal processes, it avoids the need for a long nutrient starvation period for lipid accumulation since accumulated biomass will not be wasted. Similar benefits are realizable in any biological processes for fuel production.
Conclusion
Ultimately, biofuel production should use only CO2, H2O, and sunlight as starting materials and energy input. Toward this goal, various photosynthetic and lithoautotrophic microorganisms have been engineered for biofuel production, which potentially represents the most direct and efficient route from CO2 to fuels. In addition, a specialized biological system for recycling reduced nitrogen from biomass waste has also been constructed with the prospect of minimizing nutrient dissipation from the biofuel production scheme. Although the initial successes are promising, substantial scientific and engineering barriers remain for these processes to be scalable and economically viable. Meanwhile, the vastly diverse population of autotrophic microorganisms in the environment still awaits exploration as the hosts for CO2 conversion. Such biological resources and the rapidly advancing next-generation sequencing and biomolecular tools will surely facilitate progress toward eventual replacement of fossil fuels.

Broader context
An ideal and sustainable fuel and chemical production process should derive energy from sunlight and carbon skeleton from CO2 directly. Photosynthetic microorganisms have the capability to accomplish these tasks by coupling the so-called “light reaction” of photosynthesis (converting solar energy to biochemical energy) to the “dark reaction” and subsequent carbon metabolism (converting CO2 to fuel). Alternatively, the light reaction can be replaced with man-made devices such as photovoltaic cells. Biologically accessible energy converted from photons or photovoltaic electricity can then drive the carbon fixation reactions to produce a desirable compound using metabolically engineered pathways. To close the nitrogen cycle, the protein in the cell mass generated can be deaminated to regenerate ammonia while producing more carbon-based fuels or chemicals.


 	Fig. 1  General schemes of solar energy harvesting and carbon fixation by biological and artificial approaches. Man-made devices are relatively efficient for solar energy harvesting and reducing power generation; while biological metabolic pathways are more versatile and specific for synthesis of carbon-based fuels and chemicals from carbon dioxide. A hybrid process that combines the artificial “light reaction” and the biological “dark reaction” has been recently proposed and demonstrated.	 

 	Fig. 2  Metabolic pathways for biofuel and chemical synthesis using autotrophic microorganisms. CBB cycle, Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; ACP, acyl carrier protein.	 

 	Fig. 3  Direct and indirect methods to transfer electrons to the microorganisms. (a) Hydrogen and formate as the mediators to deliver electrons to engineered Ralstonia eutropha cells for higher alcohol production from carbon dioxide. (b) Ammonia as the electron donor for the autotrophic growth of Nitrosomonas europaea cells. (c) Reduced neutral red (NRH) delivers electrons to support growth and fumarate reduction in Actinobacillus succinogenes. (d) Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans can utilize Fe2+ as the energy source to power carbon fixation and support growth. (e) A broad range of microorganisms including Sporomusa species, Clostridium species, and Moorella thermoacetica accept electrons directly from the electrode and produce native fermentation products such as acetate from CO2. (f) A microbial biofilm containing predominantly a methanogen, Methanobacterium palustre, directly obtains electrons from the cathode to drive methane production from CO2. Acetate was also present to support the growth of the biofilm.	 

 	Fig. 4  Nitrogen recycling for biofuel production systems. To achieve nitrogen neutral biofuel production, ammonia and carbon portions in the protein waste are separated. The free ammonia is fed back to the microbial process as a nutrient. And the carbon skeletons of the amino acids are converted to the biofuel product. Overall, thanks to the nitrogen recycling process, the input of the biofuel production system are only sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. And the output is biofuels.
