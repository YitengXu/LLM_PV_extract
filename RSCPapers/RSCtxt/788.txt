    , Accepted 24th March 2017First published on 25th March 2017AbstractTin oxide has been demonstrated to possess outstanding optoelectronic properties such as optical transparency and high electron mobility; therefore, it was successfully utilized as an electron transporting layer in various kinds of solar cells. In this study, for the first time, highly dispersible SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a microwave-assisted non-aqueous sol–gel route in an organic medium. Ethanol dispersion of the as-prepared nanoparticles was used to cast a uniform thin layer of SnO2 without the aid of an aggregating agent and at low temperatures. Organohalide perovskite solar cells were fabricated using SnO2 as the electron transporting layer. Morphological and spectroscopic investigations, in addition to the good photoconversion efficiency obtained, evidenced that the nanoparticles synthesized by this route have optimal properties such as small size and crystallinity to form a continuous film. Furthermore, this method allows high reproducibility and scalability of the film deposition process.
Since the introduction of halide perovskites as photovoltaic light harvesters by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009,1 they have been receiving great attention from the solar energy community due to their superior optical and electrical properties compared to other light harvesting materials. The power conversion efficiency of organo-halide perovskite based solar cells (OPSCs) rapidly reached 19.3% in just 6 years of research, from the initial value of only 3.8%.1 This considerable improvement is not only based on optimization of halide perovskite preparation and casting methods, but also includes the appropriate choice of charge transporting layers which are crucial for device efficiency. In this regard, TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, Zn2SnO4, CdS and CdSe have been successfully used as electron transport materials (ETMs).3–10 Besides, a large variety of inorganic and organic materials have been used as hole transporting materials (HTMs);11–19 although, most of them are employed in inverted configuration OPSCs. Among all ETMs, compact and/or mesoporous TiO2 are the most widely used and experimentally mature ETMs since TiO2 was initially developed for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)20 and afterwards naturally transferred to organo-halide perovskite solar cells.1,3,4 However, TiO2 thin films usually require thermal annealing at 500–600 °C for high quality film formation, resulting in increased costs and fabrication time. Besides, high temperatures are not compatible with every kind of substrate, in particular, not with polymeric flexible substrates. Therefore, low-temperature solution processed TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) films were suggested as an excellent alternative to TiO2 films fabricated by traditional high temperature methods.2,8 Although TiO2 is widely used in the most efficient perovskite solar cells, SnO2 possesses a higher conductivity and electron mobility,21 which can enhance the current density of OPSCs and increase charge collection at the anode, respectively. Also, thanks to its larger band-gap, SnO2 decreases parasitic absorption caused by the ETL. Moreover, the favourable energy level alignment at the SnO2/perovskite interface can facilitate photo-generated electron injection from the halide perovskite to the SnO2.22–26 Furthermore, SnO2, thanks to a wider band-gap, is more stable under UV light illumination compared to TiO2 and ZnO.21 All these aspects make SnO2 a theoretically preferable ETM over TiO2 for OPSCs. Recently, Ke et al. have reported that SnO2 can be used as an efficient ETM in OPSCs, in which SnO2 was spin-coated from a precursor solution and subsequently annealed at 180 °C.22 In another report, high quality SnO2 prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used as the ETM yielding over 18% device efficiency.26 More recently, Rao et al. have demonstrated a device based on SnO2 nanocolloids grown at room temperature, but the corresponding devices reached only 6.52% efficiency.24 However, the efficiency was more than doubled (>14%) when the resulting SnO2 film was coated with a thin layer of TiO2 through impregnation with TiCl4 followed by annealing at 520 °C.24 Besides the quoted reports, apart from TiO2 there is only one low-temperature processed SnO2-NC-based ETL for OPSCs, where, however, commercial SnO2-NPs were used and the light absorber was HC(NH2)2PbI3.27 Therefore, due to the advantages of SnO2 mentioned above, we expect that SnO2 NC-based ETLs could actually outperform the TiO2-NC reference cell although no binding/compacting additives (e.g. titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), TiCl4) are used.2,8,28 Herein, we present a low-temperature synthesis of SnO2-NCs with controllable size and their application in OPSCs as a precursor for the ETL. To prepare SnO2-NCs, microwave assisted non-aqueous sol–gel (MWNASG) synthesis is employed. SnO2-NCs were already obtained through a similar route by Ba et al.,29 yet, we introduce the use of microwaves to initiate and sustain the reaction. Heating by microwave irradiation has been demonstrated to reduce the reaction time over conventional non-aqueous sol–gel synthesis and allows a more precise control of the reaction parameters such as the temperature, pressure and reaction time, all in favor of a higher yield and reproducibility.30,31 In a typical SnO2-NC synthesis, 0.85 ml SnCl4, 3 ml ethanol and 17 ml benzyl alcohol were mixed in a 20 ml microwave vial inside a glovebox. After sealing with a headspace cap, the vial was transferred to a microwave reactor cavity, and the reaction was carried out at 130 °C for two different reaction times (1.5 and 5 hours) to observe its effect on the NC size. Once the reaction was completed, the final product was washed three times by centrifugation, alternating dispersion in ethanol and precipitation with diethyl-ether before the precipitate was dried under vacuum. Finally, the powder of the as-synthesized NCs was dispersed in ethanol. Several control experiments indicated that at least 90 minutes of microwave driven reaction are needed for the formation of SnO2-NCs, which is further indicated by a turning of the solution from transparent to milky. The obtained product is first characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD pattern in Fig. 1 shows that the as-prepared NCs are crystalline and that no secondary phases are formed. A rough estimation of NC sizes by the Debye–Scherrer formula provides an average diameter of 6.3 nm. TEM and high resolution (HR) TEM micrographs (Fig. 2a and c) show that the particles grown for 1.5 h possess a mildly irregular spherical shape with an average size of approximately 3 nm. The discrepancy between the size obtained from TEM micrographs and XRD can be explained by the formation of larger crystallographically coherent domains made up of NCs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2e) confirms that the colloids are highly crystalline. It is further observed that the NC size can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time. When the reaction was run for 5 hours under identical conditions of temperature and concentration, oblong irregular particles with an average size of 10 nm are obtained (Fig. 2b and d). As for the smaller NCs, the single nanoparticle diffraction pattern of Fig. 2f evidences the high crystallinity of the larger particles. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are carried out to gain information about the band structure and composition of the SnO2 NC thin film, respectively. UPS (Fig. S1†) shows that the work function (WF) of the as-synthesized SnO2-NCs is 4.71 eV, which is significantly higher than that of TiO2-NCs.3,4 The ionization energy, obtained as the sum of the valence band onset and the WF, is determined to be 8.80 eV, which is slightly higher than that of amorphous SnO2 prepared by chemical bath deposition.32 An XPS survey scan (cf.Fig. 3) reveals that the film mostly contains oxygen (O1s) and Sn as expected for SnO2. However, the spectrum also contains noticeable signal originating from indium, i.e., from the ITO substrate underneath, which indicates that the formed SnO2-NP film is either thinner than the free mean path of the photoelectrons or that it may contain pinholes. Furthermore, a relatively weak signal attributable to chlorine is detected (cf.Fig. 3, Cl2p peak). We assume it arises from the SnCl4 precursor used for the synthesis. The as-synthesized SnO2-NCs are dispersed in ethanol, and the NC dispersion is spin-coated on cleaned ITO/glass substrates immediately after UV-O3 treatment. Then, in sequence, MAPbI3 and Spiro-MeOTAD are deposited on the SnO2 ETL layer. The materials preparation, device fabrication processes and characterization are described more in detail in the ESI.† The device architecture and the corresponding energy levels are illustrated in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Furthermore, TiO2-NCs of similar size like the sub-5 nm SnO2-NCs were synthesized by the same method to compare the optical properties and effectiveness as ETMs of both materials. Kubelka–Munk spectra (Fig.
5) indicate an absorption onset starting at much lower wavelengths for SnO2-NCs as compared to TiO2-NCs. This suggests that by replacing TiO2 with SnO2, one can decrease parasitic absorption within the ETL and, thus, increase the current density of the final device. The band-gap of the SnO2-NC thin film was determined from Tauc plot extrapolation to be 4.75 eV (Fig. S2†). This value is far higher than the band-gap of bulk SnO2 (Eg = 3.6 eV)33 indicating a strong quantum confinement effect due to the reduced size33–35 and the relatively large size of the Bohr exciton radius in SnO2 (4 nm), which determines the onset of the quantum confinement regime.36 To put the band-gap energy in relation to the NC size, Brus's theoretical relation was used.37  where Eg is the bulk SnO2 band gap (3.6 eV), ℏ is the reduced plank constant, μe is the reduced electron mass (0.27me), e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant (ε = 14 for SnO2) and R is the radius of NCs. For 3 nm one obtains a band-gap of 4.3 eV, which is 0.45 eV lower than the band gap obtained by the Tauc plot. This slight mismatch can be partly attributed to possible large uncertainties in the estimation of the band-gap by the Tauc plot and/or to the error in the estimation of the NC size from TEM images due to the blurred contours of the NCs caused by the residual organic matter. The quantum confinement is still visible for the thin film, suggesting that the NCs within the film do not coalesce due to the relatively low temperature used for annealing (150 °C), thus, letting the film preserve its nanostructured morphology. However, the 150 °C thermal treatment is sufficient to allow organic molecules (benzyl alcohol) to abandon the NC surface and let them come into contact, which is critical to obtain an efficient electron transport and a high conductivity of the film. The very high value of the measured band gap also suggests that the nanoparticles are defect-free or have a very low defect concentration. Indeed, highly defective nanoparticles would have had a narrower band gap due to defect-like intraband transitions.33 This finding further confirms the effectiveness of the MWNASG method for growing SnO2-NCs for the casting of SnO2 layers. The SEM image of Fig. S3† shows that the SnO2-NC film deposited on the ITO substrate after drying is quite uniform but presents scattered wells probably formed during the fast evaporation of the solvent. The AFM image of the SnO2-NCs film in Fig S4† evidences the presence of nanometric holes. This is also observable from the SEM image (Fig. S3†). However, given the relatively low value of the root mean square roughness Rq = 7.04 nm found, the surface roughness appears to be still modest. The appearance of an indium signal in the XPS spectrum may lead us to think that the SnO2 layer has pinholes. This cannot be excluded given the holes observed in SEM and AFM images. However, considering that the XPS probing depth is about 10 nm and given the fact that the thickness of the SnO2 ETL is in that range as well, it is highly probable that XPS probes the ITO substrate underneath. Moreover, the high efficiency of the devices leads to exclude the presence of a large number of pinholes in the film, which would have a serious detrimental effect on cell efficiency, especially on the shunt resistance and fill factor, which is not observed. The electron mobility of the SnO2-NC film was investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLS) method as reported in Fig. S5.† By fitting the Child's regime with the Mott–Gurney equation, a mobility (μ) in the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was measured (see Table S1†). This value of μ is lower than the value measured for mesoporous SnO2,21 yet, it is three orders of magnitude higher than the μ of the amorphous SnO2 film obtained by chemical bath deposition.32Fig. 6a shows the J–V curve of the best performing device obtained with a 3 nm SnO2-NC ETL, wherein the PCE is 14.2% with a VOC of 1.01 V, JSC of 21.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.9%. A statistic on 40 devices evidences that the average efficiency is 12.7% with a respective standard deviation of 0.88%. A histogram of the devices' efficiency is given in Fig. S6.† For comparison, Fig. S7† shows the J–V curve of the best performing MAPbI3/TiO2-NC reference device, where the TiO2 layer is deposited without adding the binding agent Ti(acac)2(iPrO)2. Clearly, the performance is considerably inferior compared to MAPbI3/SnO2-NC devices, for which also no binding agent was added. This comparison further highlights the quality of SnO2-NCs as building blocks for the ETL in organo-halide perovskite solar cells. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is plotted in Fig. 6b. The EQE is barely constant all over the spectrum but it oscillates after 650 nm probably due to light interference in the MAPbI3 film which is only 250 nm thick. The cut-off wavelength of the top-performing SnO2 ETL-based organo-halide perovskite solar cells is around 350 nm, which lies at significantly lower wavelengths than TiO2-based devices (410 nm).2,28 This is clearly one of the advantages of ultra-small size SnO2-NC-based ETLs since the high transparency in the UV range significantly enhances the photo-current density of the SnO2-based device (21.2 mA cm−2) compared to its TiO2-based reference device (15.8 mA cm−2).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a facile low-temperature solution-based preparation of tin(IV) oxide ETLs starting from microwave-assisted non-aqueous synthesized SnO2-NCs. Highly crystalline NCs were prepared in two average sizes just by adjusting the reaction time. The smallest SnO2-NCs show a strong quantum confinement effect, even when they are cast as a thin film, which is evidenced by the larger band gap of SnO2-NCs compared to bulk SnO2. This results in decreased parasitic absorption and a deeper work function of the SnO2-NC film, facilitating photo-generated electron injection from the halide perovskite to the SnO2 ETL. The as-synthesized SnO2-NCs were used as the starting material for ETLs in organo-halide-perovskite solar cells obtaining a PCE of 14.2%. As a future perspective, ultra-small sized SnO2-NCs could be used as an efficient ETL for organic and quantum dot-based photovoltaic devices. They are also particularly attractive for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells due to their high transparency and the low processing temperature that they require.
