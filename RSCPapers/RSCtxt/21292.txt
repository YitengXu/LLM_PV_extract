    , Accepted 30th January 2019First published on 30th January 2019AbstractOrganometallic compounds as photoactive materials are relatively new in organic solar cells. Upon cyclometalation, the octahedral heteroleptic Ir complex TBzIr exhibits significantly enhanced optical-absorption and improved film-morphology compared to the planar organic 2-(5′′-hexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen]-5-yl)benzo[d]thiazole (TBz) ligand. Thus, a dramatically improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from ∼0 to 3.81% is attained when combined with PC71BM.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) which involve interpenetrating networks between organic donors/acceptors (D/A) in the active layer have been attracting great interest owing to the advantages of low-cost, light-weight, flexibility and large-area.1–3 In general, the mechanism of a typical BHJ solar cell comprises four steps of light absorption and exciton generation in the photoactive materials, exciton diffusion into the D/A interface, charge separation at the D/A interface, charge transport and accumulation at the electrodes.4 Besides the design of high optical absorption active materials, a longer average exciton diffusion length which facilitates charge separation and reduces charge recombination could also improve the photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs. To increase the exciton diffusion length, it is desirable to induce organic active materials with high mobility and/or long lifetime.5,6
Over the past decades, the development of photoactive materials suitable for OSCs has mainly focused on singlet-exciton dominated purely organic systems. However, the diffusion length (5–10 nm) of singlet materials is significantly shorter than the absorption depth required for efficient light absorption.7,8 Therefore, organic triplet materials possessing lifetimes which are 2–3 orders longer than that of singlet materials are expected to be potential candidates to increase the exciton diffusion length. However, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) using triplet states have rarely been investigated.9–11 A maximum PCE was achieved at ∼2.0% for solution-processed BHJ devices and up to 2.8% for vacuum-deposited bilayer OSCs when involving triplet Ir complexes as donor materials.10,11
It is well known that triplet excitons are widely illustrated in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) based on cyclometalated Ir or Pt complexes.12 The strong spin–orbit coupling induced by a heavy metal center allows efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) to convert singlet excitons to triplets, and thus PHOLEDs could theoretically utilize all electro-generated singlet (25%) and triplet (75%) excitons for high-efficiency.13 Generally, cyclometalated Ir or Pt complexes as high-efficiency triplet emitters in PHOLEDs show rather poor organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance due to extremely low visible to near infrared light absorption.14 In contrast, high-efficiency OPV materials are all relatively narrow bandgap semiconductors which do not emit visible light and are not suitable for OLEDs. Therefore, the use of high optical absorption cyclometalated heavy metal complexes for active layer materials turns out to be a rather challenging area in OSCs.
In this study, we have for the first time reported the photovoltaic properties of a cyclometalated Ir complex (TBz)2 Iracac (or TBzIr) in comparison with a pure organic 2-(5′′-hexyl-[2,2′:5',2′′-terthiophen]-5-yl)benzo[d]thiazole (TBz) ligand. The cyclometalation with the Ir center resulted in significantly longer exciton lifetime, as well as stronger optical absorption and better film morphology when employed as electron donors upon blending with a PC71BM acceptor. OSCs based on the TBzIr donor exhibited a maximum PCE of 3.81%, which showed great improvement compared to nearly no photovoltaic response of the TBz ligand even under various device optimization conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the record-high value for small-molecule Ir complexes in OSCs.
The synthetic routes for the organic TBz ligand and cyclometalated Ir complex are demonstrated in the ESI† (Scheme S1). Both compounds were synthesized through Stille coupling reactions with reasonable yields of over 75% using tributyl(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)stannane and 2-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[d]thiazole or bis[2-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[d]thiazole]iridium(III)(acetylacetonate) as starting materials. The chemical structures were confirmed by NMR (Fig. S1, ESI†), mass spectrometry (Fig. S2, ESI†) and elemental analysis. The optimized geometries showed a highly planar structure of the TBz ligand, indicating its great potential for solid state molecular aggregation (Fig. 1). On the other hand, TBzIr exhibited a three-dimensional asymmetric conformation. As shown in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves (Fig. S3a, ESI†), both TBz and TBzIr exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) determined at 395 and 330 °C, respectively. Besides, the melting point (Tm) determined from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves (Fig. S3b, ESI†) for TBzIr was found to be 233 °C.

As shown in the ambient UV–Vis absorption spectra in Fig. 2a, the intense absorption band for TBz from 350–500 nm in a diluted chlorobenzene (CB) solution (approximately 10−5 M) could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (π–π*) transition from the strong terthiophene donor to the benzothiazole acceptor. Unexpectedly, this strong absorption greatly decreased in intensity in the film state regardless of being spin-coated with CB, CHCl3 or toluene solution (Fig. S4, ESI†). After cyclometalating with the Ir center, the metal complex TBzIr exhibited significantly enhanced and broadened absorption. Different from TBz, the absorption of the octahedral hexa-coordinated TBzIr in both solution and film was less changed. The bands below 500 nm are attributed to the TBz ligand-centered absorption, while the absorption bands at 531 nm in solution and 545 nm in film correspond to the singlet state metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) transition. It is abnormal that further lower-energy weak and broad absorption bands featured for the triplet state metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) and/or 3π–π* transition were not obvious in TBzIr which is distinguished from the previous reports on cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for PHOLEDs, and also differed from the reference (Bz)2Iracac with absorption bands from 380–430 nm for 1MLCT and 430–530 nm for 3MLCT and/or 3π–π* (Fig. 2a).15

The organic chelate TBz exhibited red-shifted photoluminescence (PL) in film compared to in solution, with a peak at 564 and 503 nm due to strong aggregation (Fig. 2b). These emission features are contributed by the radiative decay from the singlet excited state of TBz, as evidenced by the relatively short transient PL average decay lifetime of 0.96 ns in film and 0.59 ns in solution (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, the emission from the TBzIr complex was unusual. The short wavelength fluorescence within 700 nm which overlapped well with the solution and aggregated film spectra of TBz is ascribed to the ligand-centered singlet emission, while the longer wavelength emission with a peak over 800 nm corresponds to phosphorescence characteristics of the triplet excited state. This dual emission profile was ascribed to the large size of the cyclometalated ligand, which weakens the spin–orbital coupling and reduces the ISC rate from S1 to T1, leading to an incomplete elimination of the ligand fluorescence.16 It is observed that the lower-energy phosphorescence was sensitive to O2 and the intensity significantly enhanced when degassed with N2 compared with that under ambient conditions (Fig. 2b). This could be further verified by the relatively long average lifetime of 135 ns for TBzIr in CB solution obtained from the transient PL decay curves excited at 470 nm and recorded at 800 nm. The PL of TBzIr in film was similar to that in solution, which includes <700 nm ligand centered fluorescence and over 800 nm phosphorescence. The transient PL decay curves in the film state demonstrated an average lifetime of 139.0 ns, corresponding to τ1 = 9.2 ns (15%), τ2 = 59.4 ns (51%) and τ3 = 315.4 ns (34%) (Fig. 2c). The simultaneous demonstration of short and long lifetimes is in good agreement with the corresponding singlet and triplet emissions from the steady-state PL spectra. We deduced the oxygen sensitive emission and over 300 ns PL decay lifetime for TBzIr at room temperature which strongly supports the triplet excited state feature of the new Ir complex.
The electrochemical properties of TBz and TBzIr were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Both compounds showed irreversible oxidation and non-detectable reduction behaviors (Fig. S5, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (EHOMO) calculated from the onset of oxidation curves for TBz and TBzIr were −5.61 and −5.42 eV, and their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (ELUMO) calculated from the differences between the optical band-gap and EHOMO were −3.25 and −3.33 eV, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The relatively deeper HOMO levels are beneficial to increase the open circuit voltage (VOC) in OSCs when employed as donor materials.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the two compounds, OSCs with the device configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/TBz or TBzIr:PC71BM/Ca or PDINO/Al were fabricated. The widely reported PC71BM was selected as an electron acceptor and Ca or the organic perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO) was employed as different cathode interface materials.17 The representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 3, and the key device data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown, the organic TBz ligand nearly displayed no photovoltaic response even under various device optimization conditions, such as varied interface materials, D–A weight ratio, solvent additives and thermal annealing, etc. A weak signal with a rather low PCE of 0.002% was only achieved in a Ca-based device. Nevertheless, the EQE was unavailable. On the other hand, the TBzIr donor exhibited greatly improved photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE of 2.0% in the same device structure. Further improved device performance for TBzIr was conducted using PDINO as an electron-injection layer. The best PCE of 3.81% was achieved at an optimized active-layer thickness of 110 nm (Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI†), corresponding to a VOC of 0.92 V, JSC of 8.91 mA cm−2, and FF of 47%. The rational PCE achieved for the TBzIr based device also exhibited considerably balanced charge transport in the active layer of TBzIr:PC71BM. The hole and electron motilities determined from the J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices fitted by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7, ESI†) were calculated to be 1.26 and 1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In a wide UV–Vis range from 340–570 nm, the overall EQE is above 40%, with a maximum value of 66.7% at 468 nm. To the best of our knowledge, the efficiency is the highest value ever reported for bulk heterojunction OSCs with Ir complexes as electron donors.

Such enormous variations in the photovoltaic performance based on the TBz and TBzIr donors are attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, the TBzIr complex demonstrates significantly enhanced optical absorption both in neat and PC71BM blends than the TBz ligand within a broad UV–Vis range from 350 to 600 nm, which contributed to the higher EQE response in photovoltaic devices (Fig. 2a and 3c). Secondly, the >100 ns longer decay lifetime for TBzIr than the <1 ns for TBz is beneficial to increase the exciton diffusion length and thus facilitate charge separation. Besides, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency (Fig. S8, ESI†) which referred to their corresponding neat film of donor materials in TBzIr:PC71BM blends (83%) was more efficient than TBz:PC71BM (73%), suggesting a more effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the TBzIr donor and PC71BM acceptor. Furthermore, the better photovoltaic performance of the TBzIr device is also related to the better film morphology of TBzIr:PC71BM blends. As shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, the root-mean-square roughness was only 0.45 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†), greatly lower than 4.10 nm for TBz:PC71BM. In addition, a nanoscale phase-separated bicontinuous interpenetrating network was observed for TBzIr:PC71BM, which is favorable for charge separation and transport in OSCs.18 However, large aggregated domains collapse and holes were shown in TBz:PC71BM blends.
To gain better insights into the huge variations in the OPV performance induced by cyclometalation, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted to investigate the microstructures of the neat and PC71BM blended films. Fig. 4 showed the two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding in-plane and out-of-plane direction scattering profiles. Due to a large π-conjugated backbone for excellent molecular planarity, the TBz ligand suffered from excessive crystallinity, showing an intense intermolecular packing at various directions, as can be seen from the strong packing signal spread almost throughout all the patterns in Fig. 4a. The TBz:PC71BM blends exhibited similar awful disordered structures to that of the TBz films, displaying only slightly weakened crystallinity. Therefore, the extremely weak absorption and rather poor film morphology of the TBz:PC71BM active layer lead to nearly no photovoltaic response in OSCs. On the other hand, the stacking behavior of TBzIr greatly changed owing to the octahedral asymmetric configuration of the Ir complex. The TBzIr:PC71BM blends displayed similar GIWAXS patterns to that of TBzIr. Interestingly, the broad arch-like PC71BM aggregation signal (q ≈ 1.35 Å−1) disappeared, indicating that the octahedral spatial TBzIr molecules could reduce the PC71BM aggregation, which is quite different from classical PTB7-Th:PC71BM systems.19 In the out-of-plane direction, the π–π stacking peaks (010) of TBzIr and TBzIr:PC71BM blends are similar at qz = 2.17 Å−1 (Fig. 4e), corresponding to a distance of 2.89 Å. These π–π stacking peaks only showed up in the out-of-plane direction, indicating TBzIr and TBzIr:PC71BM preferred to adopt a face-on orientation, which was beneficial in fullerene-OSCs.20

In conclusion, we have shown that a cyclometalating organic planar C^N ligand with an octahedral heteroleptic Ir complex could significantly enhance optical absorption and improve film morphology. The PL decay lifetime has been greatly increased from <1 ns to >100 ns. Therefore, significantly increased PCE from ∼0% for the ligand to 3.81% for the Ir complex was achieved. Our work indicates that organometallic complexes may be a new class of promising photoactive materials in OSCs.
