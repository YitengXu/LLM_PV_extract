Herein, the usage of WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets as a rising ultrafast photonic device to generate high power mode-locked and Q-switched pulses in a fiber laser is demonstrated. The WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets were successfully prepared by the liquid exfoliation method with thickness less than 3 nm.

After integrating the WxNb(1−x)Se2-based device into an Er-doped fiber (EDF) laser cavity, mode-locking and Q-switching laser pulses were formed. In the mode-locked mechanism output, the pulse width is as narrow as 131 fs and the output power is 52.93 mW. In Q-switched operation, the shortest pulse duration is 1.47 μs with the largest pulse energy of 257 nJ. Compared to recent studies, our results showed some improvements. This study suggests that 2D TTMDC-based devices could be developed as efficient ultrafast photonics candidates and widely used in nonlinear optical applications.
Introduction
Since the advent of graphene in 2004, atomic thickness two-dimensional (2D) materials have ignited the enthusiasm of researchers owing to their innovational physics, chemistry and photoelectric properties as well as diverse applications.1–3 The existence of uncovered surfaces of 2D materials indicates that the surface defects and layer thickness would significantly influence their outstanding features, and the controllable preparation methods of these 2D materials are prerequisite for their meaningful research.4–6 After decades of heightened research progress, numerous 2D materials have been reported, such as topological insulators, perovskites, transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal oxides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), 2D Xenes (Mxene, bismuthene, antimonene, arsenene, phosphorene, boronene, germanene, silicene).7–14 Among these 2D materials, TMDCs, spanning a conductivity range from metals (group IV TMDCs) to semiconductors (group VII TMDCs), have attracted considerable attention.15,16 It is noted that the elemental composition plays the major role in determining the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDCs, making each of them favourable for specific applications.17 2D ternary transition metal chalcogenides (TTMDCs) exhibit a relatively diverse behaviour because of their multiple degrees of freedom for tuning the physical properties via stoichiometric engineering.18 Furthermore, 2D TTMDCs exhibit some properties that binary transition metal chalcogenides (BTMDCs) do not exhibit. In comparison to BTMDCs, TTMDCs can offer flexibility to precisely tailor the specific characteristics and applications via adding another element. TTMDCs have a general formula of MxN(1−x)X2 (M and N are the two different transition metals; X represents S, Se or Te; x = 0 to 1). Therefore, the unique properties make TTMDCs a hot research topic.19 The applications of TTMDCs are mainly focused on a wide extent of energy storage, electrocatalysts, catalysis and photodetectors, solar cells, and sensors. Unfortunately, the study of TTMDCs in the field of photonics is still in the initial stage.
Moreover, it can be found that most 2D materials have advantages in the application of ultrafast photonic devices as saturable absorbers (SAs) because of their excellent traits of wideband optical response, tunable bandgaps, large third-order nonlinearity, ultrafast carrier mobility, and strong interplay between laser and materials.20–22 Recently, several TTMDCs have been reported as SAs to generate ultrafast pulses. The successful application of Mo(1−x)WxS2 on pulsed fiber lasers has brought great motivation to develop other TTMDC SAs.23 However, the study of the nonlinear optical properties of TTMDCs is insufficient. WxNb(1−x)Se2, as a novel type of TTMDC, combining the semiconductor and metallic TMDCs, opens up the opportunity for related device applications.24 Nevertheless, the application on the ultrafast fiber lasers has been rarely investigated to date.
In this study, stable femtosecond mode-locked and Q-switched EDF lasers were demonstrated using the novel 2D WxNb(1−x)Se2-based SA. The WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets were fabricated with a layer thickness less than 3 nm, and the SA device was prepared by depositing WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets onto the microfiber. The saturable intensity and modulation depth of the SA were measured to be 40.93 MW cm−2 and 5.43%, respectively. After integrating the SA into the EDF cavity, we not only obtained stable mode-locked pulse trains with a pulse duration of 131 fs, output power of 52.93 mW, and fundamental repetition rate of 65.11 MHz but also realized Q-switched pulse trains with the largest pulse energy of 257 nJ and narrowest pulse width of 1.47 μs.
Experiments
Preparation and characterization of WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets
The high quality WxNb(1−x)Se2 crystals were produced by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) technology, which exhibits a high conversion rate of raw materials. Fig. 1(a) displays the scan electron microscope (SEM) image of WxNb(1−x)Se2 crystals and the intrinsic 2D layered structure is clearly confirmed. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to analyse the elements. Judging by the EDS analysis (Fig. 1(b)), the atomic ratio of W (28.15%), Nb (5.15%) and Se (66.71%) is estimated to be around 0.85:0.15:2, indicating that x equals to 0.85. Fig. 1(c) exhibits the Raman spectra and two characteristic peaks located at 123 and 260 cm−1. After the material fabrication, the liquid phase exfoliation process was performed to prepare WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as the solvent. IPA is a type of commonly used solvent having the advantage of excellent solubility. Thus, these 2D nanosheets have good dispersity in IPA to form a stable solution. 10 mg of WxNb(1−x)Se2 powder was dissolved into 20 ml IPA. After ultrasonication and centrifugation, a uniform WxNb(1−x)Se2 dispersion with desired concentration was obtained. Fig. 1(d) shows the photograph of the homogeneous WxNb(1−x)Se2 dispersion.

In order to study the exfoliated WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets intuitively, we conducted SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) tests. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the SEM images of WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets at different scales: (a) 2 μm and (b) 500 nm, confirming that the nanosheets are exfoliated successfully and the nanosheet structure is obvious. Fig. 2(c) shows the AFM micrographs of the as-prepared nanosheets. The layer thickness and horizontal size of the as-prepared nanosheets are illustrated in Fig. 2(d). The height of WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets is estimated to be less than 3 nm and the horizontal size distributes in several tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers.

The sandwiching and evanescent field interactions are the most common approaches for applying 2D materials as fiber lasers for ultrafast photonics. When 2D materials are sandwiched between two fiber connectors, the laser interacts with the materials directly via a short length, which would bring extra heat quickly. Therefore, the materials are damaged easily. In this study, the WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets dispersed in the IPA solution with a certain concentration were prepared by the liquid phase exfoliation method, which is appropriate for the evanescent field approach. Therefore, the method by decorating WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets onto the microfiber (taper waist: 12 μm) is employed to fabricate the SA device. The evanescent field interaction scheme not only overcomes the thermal damage induced by the optical power but also ensures a strong nonlinear effect due to the long interaction length.
EDF laser setup
An all-fiber EDF laser was built to investigate the ultrafast laser application of WxNb(1−x)Se2. The structure of the ring laser cavity is demonstrated in Fig. 3, whose total length is 3.15 m. The components include a 980/1550 nm wavelength division multiplexer (WDM), EDF, polarization controller (PC), isolator (ISO), 50% output coupler (OC), and SA device. All the optical components are polarization independent and their pigtail fibers are SMF-28e fibers. The PC is utilized to adjust the polarization state. The SA is a section of the microfiber covered with WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets, which is attached on the quartz flake. The taper region is firmly straightened. The EDF (Er 110-4/125) with a length of 0.33 m is pumped via a laser diode (LD) with the largest output power of 900 mW. The dispersion parameters of SMF-28e and EDF are about −22 and 12 fs2 mm−1, respectively. The net cavity dispersion is −0.058 ps2. The measuring instruments include the following: a 1 GHz bandwidth and 10 GSa s−1 digital oscilloscope (Rohde & Schwarz RTO2014), a 5 GHz InGaAs photodetector (Thorlabs DET08CFC), an optical autocorrelator (Femto FR-103XL), a 13.6 GHz radio frequency (RF) spectrum analyzer (Rohde & Schwarz FSW13), an optical spectrum analyzer (YOKOGAWA AQ6370D) with the minimum resolution of 0.02 nm, and a digital power meter (JDSU OLP-85).

Results
Nonlinear optical characteristics of WxNb(1−x)Se2-based SA
To verify the nonlinear optical properties of WxNb(1−x)Se2-based SA, a balanced double-detector system was applied to measure the nonlinear optics parameters. Stable laser pulses with the pulse width/repetition frequency of 530 fs/45.4 MHz are emitted from a mode-locked EDF laser. Fig. 4 shows the nonlinear transmittance curve of WxNb(1−x)Se2-based SA. Based on the usual two-level saturable absorption model, the following equation was used to fit the curve (1)where the T(I), αs, Isat, and αns are the transmittance, modulation depth (ΔT), saturable intensity and nonsaturable losses, separately. According to Fig. 4, modulation depth (ΔT), Isat, and αns are calculated to be 5.43%, 40.93 MW cm−2 and 11.42%, respectively. It is worth noting that the photon energy of 0.8 eV is lower than the direct bandgap (1.25 eV) of WxNb(1−x)Se2.24 The mechanism of saturable absorption at 1550 nm originates from the sub-bandgap absorption due to the defect-state theory, which has been demonstrated in other TMDs.25,26

Mode-locking operation
During the experimental process, when the pump power was increased to 64 mW, this fiber laser started to emit laser. The mode-locked laser pulses appeared at the pump power of 350 mW with adjusting the polarization state in the intra-cavity via rotating PC slightly. The output performance of the laser pulses generated from this proposed fiber laser is revealed in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) depicts the pulse sequence in a span of 2.4 μs. The time interval of 15.3 ns between two pulses is in agreement with the intra-cavity cycle time, confirming that this fiber laser operates under the fundamental mode-locking condition. The optical spectrum of mode-locked pulses at the pump power of 900 mW is demonstrated in Fig. 5(b). The center wavelength locates at 1551 nm with a 3 dB spectral bandwidth of 23 nm. It is noted that the central wavelength, spectral bandwidth, spectral intensity remained reasonably stable over the time period, indicating that the long-term stability is good. The autocorrelation curve is shown in Fig. 5(c), and the width of half height is 200 fs, indicating the pulse duration is 131 fs when sech2 function is fitted. The time-bandwidth product (TBP) of the soliton pulse can be obtained theoretically via the following formula: TBP = τ × c × Δλ/λc2(2)where τ is the single pulse width (131 fs), c is to the constant of light velocity, Δλ is the 3 dB width of spectra (23 nm) and λc is the central wavelength (1551 nm). These obtained data indicate that TBP is 0.375, which is a little larger than the transform-limited value of 0.315, suggesting that the laser pulses are slightly chirped. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the radio frequency (RF) spectrum shows that the fundamental repetition frequency is 65.11 MHz, corresponding to the entire cavity length of 3.15 m. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) was measured to be as high as 74 dB with the resolution bandwidth (RBW) of 10 Hz. Fig. 5(e) shows the RF sequence in the span of 500 MHz, confirming the high stability of mode-locking operation. Fig. 5(f) displays the variation curve of the output power versus the pump power, and the mode-locked condition can be maintained up to a pump power of 900 mW. It is clearly noted that the output power increases linearly from 17.85 to 52.93 mW, and the slope efficiency (η) is estimated to be 6.34%.

Q-switching operation
Besides the mode-locked operation, the Q-switched operation can also be obtained. In general, the introduction of the SA into a fiber cavity can initiate both mode-locking and Q-switching. The transition between the two pulsating regimes could be mediated by the equilibrium between gain and loss, which can be adjusted by the optimization of the pump power, the design of the nonlinearity of the SA device and the cavity dispersion. By fixing the pump power at 260 mW with the adjustment of PC in this cavity, Q-switching pulses were generated. Through slowly increasing the pump power to 900 mW, the Q-switching laser pulses could still be observed. Fig. 6(a) demonstrates the change in the Q-switched pulse sequence as the input power increased. Obviously, the pulse trains show uniform intensity with no obvious peak intensity modulation. Under the pump power of 900 mW, we measured the Q-switched pulse width to be 1.47 μs having the Gaussian shape, which is depicted in Fig. 6(b). In addition, the change of Q-switching pulses features with the pump power was also studied. Fig. 6(c) shows typical features of passively Q-switched laser pulses. With the increase in the input power from 260 to 900 mW, the pulse duration drops from 3.22 to 1.47 μs rapidly. The repetition frequency as a function of input power is also indicated. The repetition frequency can be adjusted in the 144–259.59 kHz range by tuning the pump power. Fig. 6(d) presents the tendency of the pulse energy and output power to vary with the increase in the input power. The output power varies from 15.9 to 66.8 mW with the linear relationship of the pump power. Correspondingly, the single pulse energy enhances to 257 nJ monotonically. To test the stability of Q-switching laser pulses, the RF spectrum under the pump power of 900 mW was measured, which is illustrated in Fig. 6(e). The repetition rate is 259.59 kHz with 100 Hz RBW and the SNR is as high as 88 dB. The harmonic Q-switched frequencies in a span of 2.5 MHz are clearly shown in Fig. 6(f), further confirming the good stability of this Q-switching operation.

Discussion
As is shown, the output performance of mode-locked as well as Q-switched EDF lasers using various 2D materials as SAs is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. By comparing the modulation depth (ΔT) of different 2D materials SAs, it is found that WxNb(1−x)Se2-based SA has similar quality with other materials, which is efficient in regulating the light. In Table 1, the 3 dB optical spectrum bandwidth of 23 nm is wider than that of most fiber lasers, which is enough for ultrashort pulse formation. In terms of the repetition rate, 65.11 MHz in this study is smaller than that of the fiber laser demonstrated in the report.28 It is worth noting that the pulse duration of 131 fs is the shortest than that of fiber lasers. Furthermore, the output power of 52.93 mW reveals the good character of this mode-locked fiber laser, which is proved to be superior by comparison. The SNR up to 74 dB indicates that this fiber laser has good stability. Obviously, the performance of this mode-locked fiber laser is better compared to the SAs using other 2D materials. For Q-switched fiber lasers, a high repetition rate is particularly desirable in some applications. As presented in Table 2, the repetition rate of 259.59 kHz is much higher than other results. The narrowest pulse width of 1.47 μs is in the same order of that based on extensively studied 2D TMD materials. Particularly, the output power of 66.8 mW is much larger than them. The single pulse energy of 257 nJ is also an excellent value. Significantly, an SNR of 88 dB is the best, suggesting the highly stable Q-switching state. In summary, the overall performance of our results demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2 shows some advantages. Based on the evanescent field, this EDF laser can withstand a pump power up to 900 mW. Also, the high 50% extract power from intra-cavity can also effectively enhance the output power. Therefore, the output power in this Q-switched or mode-locked fiber laser is remarkably enhanced in comparison to previously reported output power. These results powerfully demonstrate that this novel material has significant potentials for ultrafast photonic devices, which may promote the development of high power pulsed fiber lasers based on 2D materials.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets were exfoliated to few layers successfully with high quality in IPA and the microfiber-WxNb(1−x)Se2 device showed significant nonlinear absorption properties. Based on their saturable absorption, passively mode-locked and Q-switched EDF lasers with high stability were established. In the mode-locking state, the pulse width is as short as 131 fs, and the output power is up to 52.93 mW. In the Q-switched operation, the largest pulse energy is 257 nJ and the shortest pulse duration is 1.47 μs. These results evidence that the WxNb(1−x)Se2 nanosheets possess great potential applications in ultrafast photonics and the TTMDCs are a prospective 2D material candidates in nonlinear optics.
