    , Accepted 8th November 2021First published on 9th November 2021AbstractA critical new research direction in solid oxide cells (SOCs) is related to balancing power-grid load or integrating heat-electricity-gas interconnection simply by switching operations between the fuel-cell and electrolyser mode. The rational design of robust and high-performance materials for SOCs is urgent for high conversion/energy efficiencies. Iron is highly abundant and offers suitable and flexible redox chemistry for the two operation modes. Iron-based oxide materials are widely investigated for SOCs because of their low cost and, more importantly, the appropriate valence stability of the Fe–O bond for excellent redox activity across a wide range of electrode functions. This review describes the progress in iron-based materials for SOCs, especially the recent applications in electrode materials or catalysts. The stable structure of the ferrite oxides provides an important platform for improved performance via the substitution of Fe in the fuel electrodes of an SOC with H2/H2O or carbonaceous fuel/feedstock. Furthermore, we discuss nano-sized Fe0 metal or alloys on an oxide electrode via infiltration and in situ exsolution aiming to fabricate highly active electrocatalysts. The advances of ferrite oxide-based oxygen electrodes are also discussed in terms of thermal expansion, stability and electrocatalysis before the developments of symmetrical and reversible SOCs based on ferrite oxides are classified and summarized. Therefore, the challenges and future prospects are discussed.

Broader context
The aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2) can be achieved by either improving the conversion efficiency of fossil fuels or integrating renewable energies (such as solar and wind). However, these renewable energies are intermittent and do not always meet the timing of consumption unless a large-scale energy storage device is integrated into the grid. Solid oxide cells excelling at a highly efficient conversion between the electrical and chemical energies can increase both the efficiency of electricity production from fossil fuels and serve as energy-storage devices. As the polarization loss is crucially important in impeding the to and fro conversion, efficient and robust electrode materials are pursued to enable an excellent performance and long-term operation. Iron-based materials are promising candidates due to the optimum valency energy of Fe–O bonds in creating oxide-ion vacancies under both air and fuel conditions, compared to other transition-metal-based electrodes. Here, recent advances of iron-based electrode materials in metal/alloy or complex oxides are reviewed in terms of solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers, as well as in reversible operation, with an emphasis on exploring critical understandings of hydrocarbon electrochemical oxidation or CO2/H2O reduction.

1 Introduction
1.1 Fuel cells and electrolysers
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that directly convert chemical energy in various fuels into electrical energy, promising power generation with high efficiency and low environmental impact.1,2 A typical solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) consists of three major components: a cathode and an anode separated by a solid oxide-ion (O2−) or proton conducting electrolyte. SOFCs operated at 600–1000 °C where significant ion conduction in solids takes place are able to use carbonaceous fuel directly for energy conversion.3 The use of carbonaceous fuel is advantageous for their commercialization as it does not need the overhaul of the current infrastructure to distribute high purity hydrogen.4,5
Although the fuel versatility of an SOFC allows for the use of natural gas, the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid uncontrollable climate changes requires the integration of renewable energies apart from fossil fuels.6,7 An SOFC coupled with a solid oxide electrolyser cell (SOEC, jointly termed a solid oxide cell, SOC) is capable of long-term storage of electrical energy generated by water/CO2 splitting with H2/CO as fuel stock.6,8
The state-of-the-art electrode materials for an SOC stack are Ni–YSZ cermet fuel and strontium lanthanum manganite (LSM) oxygen electrodes.1,3 The electronic and ionic conductors are in separate phases of Ni–YSZ cermet or LSM–YSZ composites,9 but they can also merge into a mixed-ionic-and-electronic conductor (MIEC) as for expanded reaction sites.10 Particularly, the recent advances in iron-based electrodes for both cathodes and anodes enable a higher performance, better durability, and lower operating temperature for an SOC.11 Iron-based materials were found to be important in the metal support and oxide electrode along with the lowering temperature of an SOC:12 Fe0 in chromia-forming steel can act as support for electronic conductance, while ferrite oxides with mixed-ionic-and-electronic conductivity can be used for reduced polarization in both cathodes and anodes. More importantly, the ferrite oxide that is more resistant to coking and the reduction–oxidation (redox) cycle than Ni0 was attractive in carbonaceous fuel oxidation and CO2 electrolysis,4,13,14 which could be linked to the Fe–O bond strength.
1.2 Thermodynamic considerations

1.2.1 Stability of 3d transition metals under reducing and oxidizing conditions. 
The development of anode materials for SOFCs using carbonaceous fuels in the last decade has been focused on modified Ni(O) cermet15 or alternative oxide electrodes4,16 to suppress the deposition of carbon.4,14,17 Oxides of 3d transition metal (M) are popular choices for oxide anodes because of their variable valency state allowing for electronic and ionic conductivity. The selection of electrode materials for the fuel electrode is determined by the stability of the element under redox conditions. Although the formation of complex oxides will change the bond length and coordination, the redox stability of the oxides of transition metal is dependent on the bond strength of the cations with oxygen.18
According to the Gibbs energy (ΔG) diagram of the oxides (Fig. 1(a)) of Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, the first four can maintain the oxide state under humidified H2 (3% H2O), while the others can be reduced to their metallic state. The stability of Fe/FeOx stands in a very peculiar position: FeO can be reduced to Fe0 in 3% H2O–H2, but it can also maintain the oxide state if the steam is high, e.g. in 50% H2O–50% H2. The alloying of Fe with Ni0, Cu0, and Co0 is advantageous in avoiding the sintering and growth of alloys in SOCs19 partially because the regional or temporary high steam concentration would induce the formation of iron oxides.
 Fig. 1  Gibbs energy (ΔG) for the selected 3d transition metals (M) in the reaction xM + O2(g) = MxO2 (a) or the selected redox reactions between oxides (b). The equilibrium oxygen partial pressure was presented on the right y ordinate using the open circuit potential (OCP) of the oxygen pump against 1 bar O2. The OCPs of 3% H2O–H2 and air (P(O2) = 0.21 atm.) against 1 bar O2 are presented using dashed and dotted lines, respectively, for comparison. 
Stable chromites and titanates could be candidates for the fuel electrode, but a high-temperature reduction or intricate doping is required to produce oxygen vacancies for better electrocatalysis.20 Because the equilibrium P(O2) of FeO/Fe approaches that of 3% H2O–H2, as the temperature decreases, a stable ferrite oxide can be achieved through the design of complex oxides with a lower ΔG and a decrease in the activity of Fe cations. The multiple valence changing from V5+, V4+, V3+, to V2+ makes it difficult to control the vanadates, and a dramatic variation in crystal structure is implied.
For the application in oxygen electrodes of an SOC, FeO2, the oxygenated state of stable Fe2O3, can only be found at high pressure (76 GPa, Fig. 1(b))21 at room temperature. Pyrite-structured FeO2 with O–O bonds of 2.4–2.5 Å, shorter than the O–O bonds (2.72 Å) in SrFeO3, indicates that the spatial extension of the Fe 3d orbitals is the reason for the presence of the Fe4+/Fe3+ couple possible in ambient air. These redox couples in Mn- and Ni-based oxides provide electrical conductivity under oxidizing conditions, but the high-valence Fe4+/Fe3+ and Co4+/Co3+ redox couples could provide the MIEC.


1.2.2 Thermodynamics of perovskites with 3d transition metals. 
Perovskite oxides (with the general formula ABO3) offer a large family of compounds along with several perovskite-related structures that are currently recognized and widely used in SOCs.16,22–24 The 3-D 〈BO〉 framework in the perovskite could be engineered to be a mixed-ion-and-electron conductor (MIEC) assisting the mobility of oxide ions and electrons/electron holes through the oxide-ion vacancies and B–O–B bonds, respectively.4,14,25
Although FeO is found to be unstable under fuel conditions of an SOFC, perovskite-type ferrites, i.e. SrFeO3−δ (SFO) and LaFeO3 (LFO), could be stabilized for the oxide anode of an SOFC. The theoretical decomposition of a perovskite can be viewed in two steps and if LFO is taken as an example: LaFeO3 = 1/2Fe2O3 + 1/2La2O3(1) 1/2Fe2O3 = Fe0 + 3/4O2(2)
Combining the two reactions: LaFeO3 = Fe0 + 1/2Fe2O3 + 3/4O2 + 1/2La2O3(3)
The enthalpy change of reaction (1), ΔH0 (eqn (1)), is the negative value of the stabilization energy of a perovskite, Σ, that depends on the tolerance factor of the perovskite26,27 and ΔH0 (eqn (2)) characterizes the valence stability between Fe3+ and Fe0. The superior stability of perovskite-type LaFeO3 over Fe2O3/FeO could be explained by the stabilizing energy (Σ) that is dependent on the tolerance factor,18,28τ, of the final perovskite: (4)where RA, RB, and RO represent the ionic radii of cations on A and B sites, and oxide ions, respectively. Σ tends to increase when τ approaches unity (Fig. 2). The Σ value is in the range of 60–80 kJ mol−1 if the τ value is larger than 0.9.
 Fig. 2  Stabilizing energy (Σ) per mole of oxygen as a function of tolerance factor (τ) for AIIIBIIIO3 (a) and AIIBIVO3 (b) perovskites. The corresponding Σ value for the A2BO4 R–P phase in (b) is provided for comparison. Data were replotted from ref. 28 and 18. 
Compared to the very stable perovskites SrTiO3 and LaCrO3, the lanthanum-based perovskites of Co, Mn, Ni, and Fe can be subjected to significant valence variation (e.g., the Fe oxidation state from Fe4+, Fe3+ to Fe2+ or even Fe0) under a hydrogen atmosphere (Fig. 3a). LFO is thermodynamically stable under a humidified H2 (3% H2O) without decomposing to metallic iron and La2O3, but this does not guarantee that LFO can maintain the perovskite phase as the thermodynamic calculation is under the assumption of the unity activity of solid phases (LFO and FeO).29 The stability of LFO is actually quite close to Sr2Fe2O5 under a reducing atmosphere (Fig. 3a): both can survive in a reducing atmosphere of 10−20 bar at 850 °C.30 La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ started to decompose at a P(O2) lower than 10−20.5 bar (equivalent to 1.11 V vs. 1 bar O2) at 800 °C,31 but it underwent superficial decomposition at 600 °C in dry H2 to produce Fe0 nanorods and SrO.32

The open marks are experimental decomposition data for LFO (circles35,36), La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 (triangles31) and Sr2Fe2O5 (square30). (b) Stability field of perovskites in the La–M–O (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Cr) systems at 1000 °C as a function of P(O2) (the corresponding EMF against 1 bar O2) and the activity of cations on the A and B sites. (a) and (b) were modified and replotted from ref. 29 and 27 respectively. 
As can be seen from the stability field (Fig. 3b) in terms of P(O2), the activity of La3+ on the A site and transition metal, M, on the B-site (lg(a(M)/a(La))) is also important in determining the stability of the perovskite. This is the reason why an A-site deficient perovskite is usually employed to increase the exsolution of metals from the B site via the increase of the activity of transition cations.37–43 The development of a stable R–P phase with excess A-site element could be explained by the decrease of the activity of cations on the B site and the increased Σ compared with the parent perovskite (Fig. 2b).
SrFeO3 contains iron in an unusual Fe4+ oxidation state, which is considered to have resulted from the interplay of Fe 3d electrons and O p holes,44 providing significant oxygen non-stoichiometry for MIECs for excellent oxygen reduction or oxidation evolution as oxygen electrodes.44 The Fe4+ can be reduced to Fe3+ even by thermal treatment in air: e.g. SFO is reduced to SrFeO2.675 at 800 °C under a P(O2) of 0.21 bar as a result of oxygen loss from the lattice.45,46
The analyses of thermodynamics indicate that Fe-based materials boast great versatility in metal/oxide fuel electrodes and oxygen electrodes. The characteristics of increased stability under fuel conditions with a decrease of temperature and the possible mixed electron and oxide-ion conductivity of Fe-based materials were in line with the development of intermediate- and low-temperature SOCs, which makes them popular choices in the last few decades.

1.3 Objective and organization of the review
The maturity of SOCs for efficient electricity generation from chemical energy or chemical synthesis from electricity requires low-cost, highly stable and enhanced electrocatalytic electrode materials to reduce the cost in construction and operation. There are quite a few excellent reviews on the development of SOFCs and SOECs in terms of materials,15,16,47,48 microstructures,49,50 interfaces10,51,52 and systems.53,54
As the second most abundant metal element in the Earth's crust, iron has been selected to prepare highly conductive and light-weight supports, efficient nanoscale catalysts with high selectivity, and redox-stable oxide electrodes for symmetrical and reversible SOCs. In the context of extensive research in the last decade, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of Fe-based materials for SOCs. In the meantime, the infiltration and exsolution into or from Fe-based electrodes are highlighted for the development of advanced electrodes for SOCs. The advancements of symmetrical and reversible SOCs for energy storage are summarized.
Iron-based materials have been used in the development of both anodes (Section 2) for SOFCs and cathodes (Section 3) for SOECs for fuel oxidation or feedstock reduction, respectively. The strategies for balancing the stability and performance for fuel electrodes are reviewed in terms of thermodynamics and practical demonstrations. As one important family of materials for cobalt-free oxygen electrodes, ferrite based perovskites (Section 4) are reviewed as oxygen electrode materials before we move to the construction of symmetrical and reversible SOCs (Section 5).
2 Iron-based anodes for SOFCs
As the most abundant transition metal in the Earth's crust, Fe has been incorporated into the construction of SOFCs due to its low cost, stable metal/oxide reversibility and great mechanical strength at the oxygen potential of fuel and selective catalysis supporting fuel conversion. These advantages are very important to the commoditization and fuel versatility of an SOFC, and Fe can be included in the anode in the forms of metal alloy supports (Section 2.1) and oxide anodes (Section 2.2) for the utilization of H2 or carbonaceous fuels and nano-sized catalysts (Section 2.3) on the surfaces of non-ferrite supports to enhance the electrocatalysis for the FOR. Infiltration and exsolution37–43,50,55 are popular methods to enhance the performance of the anode to increase either the fuel adsorption/dissociation and electronic/ionic conduction. The relationship between different types of Fe-based materials and processing is graphically presented in Fig. 4.

2.1 Iron-based alloys
Ferritic stainless steels have been used for interconnects of an SOFC operating at 600–800 °C due to their abundance, low-cost, high electrical conductivity and high machinability, and they are beneficial for the construction of light-weight SOFC stacks.56–59 High Cr content (>22 wt%) ferritic stainless steels, such as Crofer 22 APU, ZMG 232 and E-BRITE, were designed for the operating temperature of 800 °C to avoid the rapid growth of oxide scales via the formation of a dense protective chromia layer, but lower Cr content ones (16–20%) that are less prone to embrittlement due to σ-FeCr phase formation could be used for SOFCs operated at temperatures below 800 °C to reduce the cost and increase the workability.60
Analogous to the advantages of stainless steel over ceramic interconnects, metal-supported SOFCs provide significant advantages over conventional ceramic cells, including low cost, mechanical ruggedness, and tolerance to rapid thermal and redox cycling.61 With the development of metal-supported SOFCs, porous stainless steel (Fig. 5) has been used for either anode or cathode support due to its high conductivity both in air and in a reducing atmosphere.62 However, with near-to-none ionic conductivity, high sinterability and tendency towards the formation of superficial chromia, infiltration of ionic conductors, mixing with oxides for cermet for functional layers and depositing dense oxide coatings to inhibit corrosion have been explored for the practical uses of these metals for electrodes and interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells.63 The infiltrated materials could be ionic conductors or metal/oxide electrocatalysts for either oxygen or fuel electrodes. With Ni-GDC and SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5 infiltration into either layer of porous 430L stainless steel sandwiching 15 μm scandia-stabilized zirconia (SSZ) electrolyte, a remarkable performance of 1.02 W cm−2 was achieved at 650 °C.62

Stainless-steel supported SOFCs are generally processed under an inert or reducing gas to avoid the oxidation of steel at high temperature for the densification of ceramic electrolyte,66 but, alternatively, the metal support can be obtained from the oxide precursor along with the in operando reduction under hydrogen (Fig. 5c).67 The conventional Ni–YSZ cermet anode has been achieved through the co-sintering of the NiO–YSZ composite with the YSZ electrolyte at a temperature of around 1400 °C and the in situ reduction of the oxide precursor can cause the loss of oxygen and increase the porosity of the anode for gas transport, but it would be difficult for FeOx incorporated into the NiO in the cermet to survive the co-sintering with YSZ due to the reactivity of FeOx with the zirconia-based electrolyte. Virkar et al.68 developed the idea of incorporation of iron in the anode support to reduce the cost of the anode substrate, and a high content of iron (Fe2O3:NiO molar ratio = 3:7) was incorporated, and a cell showing a power density of ∼180 mW cm−2 at 550 °C was achieved if GDC and NiO-GDC (50:50 wt%) were used as the electrolyte and functional layer, respectively.
The reactivity of binary oxides with LSGM is in the order of Co2O3 > NiO > Fe2O3 for the production of La-containing oxides at 1150 °C.69 Ni–Fe(O)-based anodes without mixing with ionic conductors have been developed initially to reduce the reactivity of the conventional Ni(O) anode with LSGM electrolyte that produces insulating phases blocking the reaction sites.65,70 A Ni–Fe(O)–SDC composite with a thin GDC buffer layer was used as the cermet support for the deposition of LSGM electrolyte through pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and a high performance of 2 W cm−2 was achieved at 600 °C.65 With a low concentration of iron (10 wt% Fe2O3) in NiO, an Fe–Ni alloy was achieved under reducing conditions at 700 °C for one hour, and the area-specific resistance (ASR) of the cell was limited by the cathode and the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte at high and low temperatures, respectively.70 Cu–Fe–Ni nanoalloy particles consisting of immiscible face-centered cubic Cu- and body-centered cubic Fe-based phases were obtained by reducing the Cu(Ni)Fe2O4 spinel precursor for an efficient anode at temperatures between 800 and 600 °C.67
The interaction between steel supports and superficial catalysts and ionic conductors is crucial to understanding the durability of the cell. A layer of CeFeO3 was found on the top of the chromia layer (Fig. 6) when operated under H2 conditions at 650 °C if GDC/Ni was infiltrated onto the surface of the Fe–Cr alloy (Fe–22 wt% Cr–0.4% Mn).66,71 CeFeO3 is unstable in ambient air, showing CeO2 impurities even at a low temperature,72 and the magnetic measurement and Mössbauer spectra both showed that the cation valencies in single-phase CeFeO3 are Ce3+ and Fe3+.73 The formation of CeFeO3 acts as a protective layer to inhibit the growth of an underneath chromia layer, similar to the proposed CeCrO3 layer in the ceria infiltrated metal support under reducing conditions.63

2.2 Ferrite-oxide anodes
The comparable stability of SFO and LFO against the fuel conditions indicates that the partial substitution for Fe4+/3+ could be more meaningful in stabilizing the oxides by maintaining the oxygen content in the perovskite lattice and decreasing the activity of Fe3+/2+ than A-site doping. Cr3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, W6+, and Mo6+ in perovskite-type ferrites are the most popular cations used for the synthesis of stable oxide anodes in a reducing atmosphere (Table 1), while ferrites with Ni2+, Cu2+, and Co2+/3+ substitution tend to destabilize the structure and induce the formation of a layered perovskite during the fuel cell operation. An investigation into the literature on stabilizing the ferrite perovskite with stable cations indicated that a substitution level of around 20% was sufficient to achieve a stable perovskite at 800 °C in H2. The La0.30Sr0.70Fe0.70Cr0.30O3−δ perovskite was shown to be stable down to a P(O2) of 10−20 atm at 800 °C and a P(O2) of 10−18 atm at 900 °C. Further reduction at lower P(O2) led to the formation of Fe0, but the phase separation was also shown to be completely reversible with an increase in the partial oxygen pressure and re-oxidation of the sample.74 The substitution of Mn4+/3+/2+ for Fe3+/4+ in a perovskite could be conditional as Mn2+ is more stable than Fe2+ to be reduced to metal, but Mn3+ is less stable than Fe3+ in the production of divalent cations. Ishihara et al.75,76 found that La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Mn0.1O3 maintained the perovskite phase after fuel cell testing at 800 °C, but a further increase of the Mn content as in La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.2Fe0.8O3−δ induced the formation of R–P phase La1.2Sr0.8Mn0.4Fe0.6O4 and Fe0 particles on the surface.77 Since the doping on the B site is more important in stabilizing the perovskite lattice, we select the most popular Mo, Cr and Ti doping as examples to represent the progress in ferrite anodes.

Mo doping. 
Mo doped SFO is well studied as the anode material of an SOFC because of its high conductivity in a reducing atmosphere, superior stability and electrocatalysis towards the FOR. SrFe1−xMoxO3−δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.25) is fairly stable in air as the Mo and Fe valences are mostly 6+ and 3+ in SrFe0.75Mo0.25O3, but a further increase of x requires a reducing atmosphere for single-phase perovskites.145 SrMoIVO3 is a cubic perovskite at room temperature with a cell parameter of 3.976 Å,146 close to that of SFO, 3.855 Å, but the maximum substitution of Mo on the Fe site achieved so far was Sr2Fe0.4Mo1.6O6via reduction in H2.147 SrFe1−xMoxO3 (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) with Fe and Mo cation ordering as in the typical double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 could be used as an oxide anode material for SOFCs.148 The redox couple Fe2+ + Mo6+↔ Fe3+ + Mo5+ is expected to generate electron carriers, as well as oxygen vacancies into the lattice for oxide-ion conduction.149 Sr2−xLaxFeMoO6−δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with La3+ doping in Sr2FeMoO6 can increase the cation disordering, oxygen vacancy and Mo4+ formation.133 Ni doping in SMFO generally destabilizes the structure: Sr2Fe1.5−xNixMo0.5O6−δ was stable under H2 at 750 °C when x = 0.05 and 0.10, but Ni0 was shown on the surface when x = 0.2 and 0.3.150 The reduction of Sr2FeMo0.65Ni0.35O6−δ in H2 at 850 °C produced R–P type Sr3FeMoO7−δ and Fe–Ni alloy.88 A-site deficiency also promoted the exsolution of Ni particles in the Ni/Mo co-doped SFO: Sr2−xFe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6−δ (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1) exhibited thermal stability in a reducing atmosphere at 750 °C, though some nickel particles were exsolved on the surface at 800 °C for x = 0–0.075. The cell with these oxide anodes delivered a peak power density of 326, 438, 606, 407 and 348 mW cm−2 at 800 °C with humidified H2 as the fuel when x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1, respectively.151 Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 showed the best performance when it was mixed with 40 wt% GDC.152 Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 infiltrated into a porous-dense-porous LSGM scaffold was used to prepare a symmetrical SOFC, and a maximum power density of 880 mW cm−2 at 700 °C and 306 mW cm−2 at 900 °C was obtained under H2 and CH4 fuel, respectively.153 The anode performance of A2FeMoO6−δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) with variable A-site cations was in the sequence Ca2FeMoO6−δ < Ba2FeMoO6−δ < Sr2FeMoO6−δ and, specifically, Ca2FeMoO6−δ was found to be unstable even in a nitrogen atmosphere.154


Cr doping. 
The 3d54s1 valence electron of Cr indicates that Cr6+ is achievable as in CrO3 or SrCrO4. CrO3 is volatile at temperatures above 200 °C, while SrCrO4 is one of the products during Cr-poisoning of an LSM oxygen electrode.155 SrCrO3 shows metallic conductivity but is unstable at 800 °C in ambient air.156 In contrast, LaCrO3 with an orthorhombic structure is stable in both ambient air and a reducing atmosphere. The stable (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3 could be engineered to a perovskite with the formula La1−xSrxCr1−xFexO3−δ (x = 0.2–0.67)157 and their polarization resistances as anodes for H2 oxidation decreased with Cr content. Ce-doped La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.5Cr0.5O3−δ was found to decrease the polarization resistance of the oxide anode in syngas,122 and the best performance was achieved when 5 at% Ce4+/3+ was used to replace La3+ on the A site. Recent research on Bi3+ doping on the La3+ site (La0.65Bi0.1Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.5O3−δ) showed a great enhancement in the performance in H2 and syngas compared to the La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.5O3−δ anode,123 and a remarkable performance (360 mW at 800 °C with syngas fuel) can be achieved for the La0.65Bi0.1Sr0.25Fe0.5Cr0.5O3−δ/SDC|LSGM (300)|LSCF/SDC cell.


Ti doping. 
Ti4+ doping in cubic SrFe1−xTixO3−δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) lowers both the ionic and electronic conductivity in air but increases the structural stability of perovskites.158,159 The SrFe0.7Ti0.3O3 anode showed much higher electrical conductivity and smaller area-specific resistance than the SrTi0.7Fe0.3O3 counterpart in a reducing atmosphere.160 SrFe0.7Ti0.3O3 was stable at 650–750 °C under hydrogen-fueled conditions, but showed Fe0 exsolution at 800 °C for 78 h under 5% H2.114 With Fe0 exsolution, the SrFe0.7Ti0.3O3 anode had an anode polarization resistance (Rp) of 0.17 Ω cm2 at 800 °C in humidified H2, much lower than the value 0.39 Ω cm2 measured for SrFe0.6Ti0.4O3, and 3.14 Ω cm2 for SrTiO3. A-site deficient Sr0.95Fe0.63Ti0.3Ni0.07O3 was designed for Ni0 exsolution under a reducing atmosphere and the cell with this anode showed a high power output of around 1 W cm2 at 800 °C (Fig. 7a and c).113 Ti4+ doping was also used to stabilize LFO and (La,Sr)FeO3 as in La0.95Fe0.8Ni0.05Ti0.15O329 and (La,Sr)(Fe,Ti)O3.115 For example, compared with La0.95Fe0.8Mg0.05Ti0.15O3, the perovskite La0.95Fe0.8Ni0.05Ti0.15O3 with Ni0 exsolution showed a much lower Rp in 5% H2 which could be further reduced by the testing in H2 (Fig. 7b and d). According to the analysis of Barnett et al. on the Rp variation vs. H2 partial pressure on SrFe0.7Ti0.3O3 without and with metal decoration, the FOR was limited by the charge transfer in the former, while it was by the adsorption rate in the latter.113

Although the power output of a cell depends on the thickness/type of electrolyte and the selection of cathodes, the statistics of the reported power output (Fig. 8) in the references from Table 1 could provide an overview of the effect of dopants. In most cases, the doping on the B site increased the performance of the cell from less than 200 mW cm−2 to near 1000 mW cm−2 at 800 °C, but it is interesting to note that the power of the cells increases with the charge of the dopants for either the reducible (Ni2+/3+ and Co3+/4+) or stable (Cr3/4+, Ti4+, Nb5+, and Mo6+) cations.
 Fig. 8  Box plots of the power densities of the cells based on perovskite-type ferrite anodes with different B-site dopants. The testing temperature was 800 °C and the fuel was wet H2. 
As the oxides are generally synthesized in ambient air when Fe3+ and Fe4+ are stable, the incorporation of higher valence cations requires the substitution of Sr2+ on the A site for La3+ content if the co-doping of LaFeO3 is taken as an example. The incorporation of Sr2+ will expand the unit cell of the reduced oxides and decrease the 〈Fe–O〉 bonding energy for higher oxide-ion conductivity. It should be noted that Mo showed multiple valences and was stable as oxides under fuel conditions, but it can also change from the stable Mo6+ in air to Mo5+ and Mo4+ for creating oxide-ion vacancies and electronic conduction.
Thermodynamic analysis indicates that FeO can be reduced to Fe0 under a H2 atmosphere with low humidity and the high stabilizing energy during the perovskite formation makes possible its utilization for oxide anodes. There are limited ferrites other than perovskites explored as stable anodes since a significant quantity of stable cations is needed to reduce the activity of Fe and decomposition or phase transformation.143,144,161

2.3 Iron-containing electrocatalysts
The use of Fe0 in the catalysis for fuel conversion is also related partially to the stability between Fe0 and its oxides.162 In an SOFC, nanostructured metal catalysis can be infiltrated into MIEC oxides to produce long TPBs for the FOR, but the sintering of nano-particles will cause the growth of size along with the decrease of reaction sites.163,164 The sintering of the nanoparticles will cause the loss of active sites of the anode. In order to reduce the degradation due to the sintering of catalysts, one possibility is to infiltrate high-melting-point metals, such as Co3W alloy,165 while the other is to enhance metal catalysts’ thermal stability by encapsulating them in a thin, porous metal oxide shell. A Co–Fe alloy infiltrated PrBaMn2O5+δ electrode was reported to exhibit excellent activities for hydrocarbon electro-oxidation.25 The nano-sized metal particles tend to interact strongly with an oxide support, thereby anchoring the metal particles and preventing sintering.166,167
The interaction of iron with oxide supports is well-known:162,168 iron oxide interacts strongly with γ-Al2O3 to produce some spinels which are difficult to reduce completely in a hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures below 900 °C. The reduction of ferric oxide on the oxide support is also affected by the loading of oxides and alloying with other nobler metals. Specifically, the reduction of Fe3+/Al2O3 in H2 cannot go beyond the Fe2+ at low metal loading (0.05 wt.%) unless the temperature is higher than 750 °C because ferric ions tend to occupy empty octahedral positions on the alumina surface and are strongly held to retard migration on the surface.169 Fe0 should just be the stable form under humidified H2 (3% H2O), but the actual operational SOFC was subjected to the oxidation of anodic current, e.g. at 0.7 V, which could vary the chemistry of Fe based catalysts. Irvine et al.170,171 studied the stability of a Ni–Fe infiltrated La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anode and found that the incorporation of iron could enhance the performance by a factor of 2.5 compared with the one with Ni infiltration and, more importantly, retard the degradation of the anode as a result of the suppression of the oxide layer covering the metal catalyst and the formation of an iron-rich oxide ((La,Sr,Ca)2Fe(Ti)O4 and/or La(Sr,Ca)Fe(Ti)O3) interlayer (Fig. 9) between the La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 backbone and the Fe metal particles.

Fe2O3 deposited on PrBaMn1.7Co0.3O5+δvia infiltration (Fig. 10) showed cation-swapping to create PrBaMn1.7Fe0.3O5+δ with in situ Co0 alloy exsolution on the surface for high and stable performance under CH4 for CO production.172 The dissolution of Fe into the underlying perovskite lattice is ascribed to its low co-segregation energy compared to that of cobalt. Compared to the Co0 exsolution from PrBaMn1.7Co0.3O5+δ creating a layered perovskite or A-site cation segregation, the filling of iron on the B site actually increased the ionic conductivity and stability.

The exsolved Fe0 or alloy can be obtained from ferrite perovskites, but the incorporation of Fe3+ in other stable non-ferrite perovskites (e.g. chromite and titanate) could also induce the growth of nano-sized Fe-containing electrocalysts.173 In La0.4+xSr0.4−xFexTi1−xO3 (x = 0.06 or 0.09), the exsolution requires higher temperature and lower oxygen partial pressure than the Ni counterparts due to the higher Fe–O energy for the segregation. The exsolved Ni–Fe nano-sized alloy on the titanate perovskite improves CO oxidation at 450 °C and enhances sulfur tolerance compared with the exsolved Ni0 as a result of the preservation of the initial spacings between the particles.174 The TPO results (Fig. 11) showed that the (La0.7Sr0.3)(Cr0.85Ni0.1125Fe0.0375)O3−δ anode had a better carbon deposition tolerance than the (La0.7Sr0.3)(Cr0.85Ni0.15)O3−δ anode as the addition of Fe increased the oxide-ion vacancies of the chromite and initiated the iron doping of the exsolved metal catalysts after reduction.89

A Cu/Fe–La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ metal–oxide interface was constructed via the in situ reduction of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.9(Cr0.5Mn0.5)0.9(Cu1−xFex)0.1O3−δ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) to enhance methane oxidation and redox stability while suppressing coking and sulfur poisoning.175 The Sr2CoMo1−xFexO6−δ (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1) perovskite with Co–Fe alloy exsolution showed excellent coking resistance in CH4, which could be attributed to the increased oxygen vacancies due to Fe doping and the effective catalysis of multiply-twinned Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles for reforming of CH4 to H2 and CO.176 Co–Fe co-doped La0.5Ba0.5MnO3−δ (La0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Fe0.1Co0.1O3−δ) with a cubic-hexagonal heterogeneous structure was found to produce Co0.94Fe0.06 alloy nanoparticles during the reduction in hydrogen.177 A single cell with this anode on a 300 μm thick LSGM electrolyte exhibited maximum power densities of 1479 and 503 mW cm−2 at 850 °C with wet hydrogen and wet methane fuels, respectively, and the cell was coking resistant for 200 hours under the methane fuel.
3 Iron-based cathodes for SOECs
3.1 Steam electrolysis
The reversible potential, and therefore the required electrical energy, for steam decomposition decreases with increasing temperature, leading to an increasing amount of heat energy needed to compensate for the entropy cooling.178 Hence, the relatively cheap heat energy supplied provides an increasing proportion of the total energy required to produce hydrogen as the temperature increases. Moreover, the overpotential losses in the electrical energy are lower at higher temperatures.179
At present, the practical development of SOECs lags behind that of SOFCs partially because of the degradation of the fuel electrode (cathode in the SOEC mode) and the oxygen electrode (anode in the SOEC mode) caused by the interdiffusion and delamination at the electrode/electrolyte interface.180 While the delamination of the oxygen electrode is ascribed to the excessive pressure build-up with a high O2 flow in an over-sintered (larger grain size and smaller pores) region, the Rp of an actual long-term galvanostatic electrolysis is ascribed to the Ni/YSZ fuel electrode.10,181 Ni alloyed with Fe was found to show much better performance than pure Ni or Pt at 600 °C for the production of H2 from steam at 600 °C on LSGM electrolyte,19 which is attributed to the preservation of the dispersion state of Ni particles by Fe alloying. The water splitting on the Ni–YSZ cathode, for example, happens on the TPB of the Ni, YSZ and gas phases:182 (a) water molecules (H2O) are adsorbed onto the TPB to form an OH− ion and a hydrogen atom (reaction (5), (6) and (7)), (b) OH− is reduced by an electron to produce O2− and release hydrogen atoms to combine for H2 (reactions (8) and (9)), (c) O2− ions formed this way migrate to the YSZ phase, and (d) O2− ions travel through the bulk of the electrolyte to the anode side to be oxidized for oxygen gas on the cathode.
For Ni–YSZ as the hydrogen electrode of the SOEC: H2O(gas) ⇌ (H2O)ads(TPB)(5) eNi ⇌ eYSZ(TPB)(6) (H2O)ads(TPB) + eYSZ(TPB) ⇌ Hads–SNi + OH−(TPB)(7) OH−(TPB) + eYSZ(TPB) ⇌ Hads–SNi + OYSZ2−(8) 2(Hads–SNi) ⇌ H2(gas) + 2SNi(9)Here, SNi: an active Ni surface site for reaction species adsorption; O–SNi: an active metal surface site adjacent to an Oads (adsorbed oxygen); Hads: adsorbed hydrogen; OYSZ2−: an oxygen ion on an YSZ lattice site; eYSZ: an electron on the YSZ surface near the TPB; and eNi, eYSZ: an electron near the TPB.
Perovskite oxides such as titanates,183,184 La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ185 and ferrites186 have been selected as candidates for the dissociation of water molecules. One possible solution to decrease the Rp on the fuel electrode could be the utilization of an MIEC oxide that expands the reaction sites to the surface of the electrode rather than the TPBs for the dissociation of water molecules as in Ni/YSZ cermet.187 The comparison between the reaction sites on TPBs and on the surface of an MIEC is presented in Fig. 12. Moreover, an alternative oxide electrode developed for an SOEC is able to reduce the strain as in the Ni(O) cermet cathode during the redox cycle188 and bring about the avoidance of using H2 for the pre-reduction or maintaining the reducing atmosphere.185 For example, for Sr2FeNbO6(SFN)-YSZ as the hydrogen electrode of an SOEC, the reaction mechanism could be illustrated using the following equations:189 H2O(gas) ⇌ (H2O)ads,SFN(10) (H2O)ads,SFN + eSFN ⇌ Hads–SSFN + OHSFN−(11) OHSFN− + eSFN ⇌ Hads–SSFN + OSFN2−(12) OSFN2− ⇌ OYSZ2−(13)where (H2O)ads,SFN: a water molecule adsorbed onto the SFN perovskite; Hads–SSFN: an SFN perovskite surface adjacent to an adsorbed hydrogen; OHSFN−: an OH− ion on the SFN surface; eSFN: an electron on the oxide surface; and OSFN2−: an oxygen ion on an SFN lattice site.

The exchange current density of LSF from DC polarization is 14 mA cm−2 at 700 °C, which is very close to that of Ni–YSZ.186 In this respect, the electrocatalysis of the metal-free ferrite towards water splitting is desirable since it is subjected less to microstructural variation than the Ni cermet counterpart as it can survive the reduction process. Sr1−xPrxFeO3−δ (SPF) (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.10) was explored as the cathode material for the electrolyser fed with steam, and the best performance was found at x = 0.04, showing an Rp of 0.25 Ω cm2 in a reducing atmosphere at 800 °C.190 The high performance of the MIEC ferrite perovskite lies in the expansion of reaction sites, but the superficial reduction under a cathodic bias is also important to the electrocatalysis of water splitting. Opitz et al.187 found that Fe0 was evident in the in situ NAP-XPS (near-atmosphere-pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy) of the La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 electrode under slight cathodic current (Fig. 13).

The sketches indicate the situation for the LSF surface and the resulting reactivity, respectively.187 The image was reproduced from ref. 187, Copyright Wiley-VCH. 
The electrochemically-driven evolution of Fe0 particles on the surface might induce the formation of an R–P phase underneath with a better thermodynamic stability limit than the perovskite and thus inhibit further reduction and increase the structure and redox stability by confining the dimensions of exsolution.191 The Rp of the cell with Fe loading in a La0.7Sr0.3VO3 (LSV) cathode via infiltration decreased by 50%, though it was twice that of a Ni-infiltrated LSV cathode, indicating that Fe0 as the metal electrocatalyst was not as efficient as Ni0 in the water-splitting reaction but was still better than the pure oxide.192 The current density of the electrolysis cell with (La0.2Sr0.8)0.9Ti0.9Fe0.1O3−δ-GDC electrodes reached approximately 150 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V at 800 °C, higher than 120 mA cm−2 for bare (La0.2Sr0.8)0.9TiO3−δ-SDC electrodes, because of the reversible growth of Fe0 particles on the surface in the former.193 The improved electrocatalysis of Fe0 over the oxide cathode could indicate that the intrinsic exsolution of Fe0 under cathodic current194 could induce the “smart” behavior of the ferrite perovskite that maintains high electrocatalysis and stability under a cathodic bias for electrolysis.
3.2 CO2 electrolysis and CO2/H2O co-electrolysis
High-temperature CO2 splitting SOECs could greatly assist the reduction of CO2 emissions by electrochemically converting CO2 to valuable fuels through effective electrothermal activation of the stable CO bond.52 Although Ni-cermet exhibits excellent catalytic activity for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis, it tends to suffer from some drawbacks of impurity poisoning, oxidation, particle aggregation, coke deposition, etc.195,196 These phenomena would result in cell performance degradation:197 a short stack Jülich F10 design with anode-supported cells for CO2–H2O co-electrolysis for syngas production showed ∼2% kh−1 voltage degradation at 800 °C as a result of Ni depletion at the cathode/electrolyte interface.
La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 was found to be an excellent electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction in SOECs198 and the reactions on the cathode were proposed based on the results of Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations:199 CO2(gas) + OLSF2− = CO32−(ads)(14) CO32−(ads) + e− = CO2− (activated, bent) + OLSF2−(15) CO2−(activated, bent) + e− = CO(ads) + O2−(ad)(16) CO(ads) = CO(gas)(17)In the initial step, a CO2 molecule is chemically adsorbed onto the LaSrFeO terminated surface and transforms into stable adsorbed carbonate (CO32−(ads)) species. CO32−(ads) upon accepting an electron can further transform into an activated bent CO2− (CO2−(activated, bent)) on the surface, which decomposes into adsorbed CO(ads) and an adsorbed oxygen anion (O2−(ads)) upon further acceptance of an electron.
Operando NAP-XPS measurements on a La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ cathode for CO2 electrolysis indicated the formation of carbonate intermediates, and Opitz et al.200 proposed that the oxide ion vacancies (Vac) produce CO2− or CO33− radicals (CO2˙−(ads) or CO3˙3−(ads)) when CO2 is adsorbed and attached to the surface of an MIEC ferrite with oxide ion vacancies and electron flow. CO2(gas) + Vac + e− = CO2˙−(ads)(18) CO2˙−(ads) + O2− = CO3˙3−(ads)(19) CO3˙3−(ads) + e− = CO(gas) + 2O2−(20)These reactions indicate that electron transfer is required to form the carbonate201 and thus to activate CO2 on the oxide surface, while the number of reaction sites is controlled predominantly by the oxygen vacancies of the perovskite.
Ti doping in La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5−xFe0.5TixO3−δ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5)202 improves the current efficiencies at x = 0.1 under a wide range of potentials for CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C. SFO was unstable for a CO2 electrolyser,203 but perovskite-type La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Ti0.3O3204 and La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ205,206 with partial Cr3+ or Ti4+ substitution for Fe3+/4+ were found to be stable. Ce was doped into the A site of La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.5Fe0.5O3−δ to promote the catalytic performance, and to introduce oxygen vacancies in the lattice in situ after reduction under operational conditions.207
The increased amount of oxygen vacancies not only facilitated the mobility of oxygen ions, but also provided favorable accommodation for chemical adsorption of CO2. The introduction of vanadium in ferrite perovskites (La0.5Sr0.5Fe1−xVxO3−δ, x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) promoted the formation of oxygen deficiencies and altered the electronic structure of Fe, and thus greatly enhanced the adsorption and dissociation of CO2.208 10% Nb doping in La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 was also found to increase the electrolysis of CO2, and a current density of 0.85 A cm−1 at 1.5 V was obtained at 800 °C.209 A small amount of Mn is effective for improving the activity of LFO-based cathodes for CO2 electrolysis: a cathodic current density of 335 and 240 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V/800 °C was achieved on a cell with La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Mn0.1O3 and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 cathodes on LSGM electrolyte, respectively.210
Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ is a typical oxide cathode material that can be used on LSGM based electrolyte and shows a superior performance for CO2 electrolysis even under pure CO2 feeding gas.211–214 A high current density of 1.09 A cm−2 could be obtained at 1.5 V at 800 °C for a cell with a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ/GDC cathode. F− anion doping in Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ was found to increase the CO2 adsorption: the electrolysis cell based on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δF0.1 cathode could give a high current of 1.36 A cm−2 at 1.5 V at 800 °C and high stability under continuous operation at a high current density.215
Fe–Ni nanospheres exsolved from La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ under reduction in H2 were found to greatly enhance the performance of the electrode for CO2 electrolysis (Fig. 14), and a high current density of 1.78 A cm−2, along with a high Faraday efficiency (∼98.8%), was achieved at 1.6 V and 850 °C for the cell with the La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ cathode with the exsolved Ni–Fe metals.216 Co–Fe outgrown on the surface of the ferrite perovskite was found to be important for CO2 activation as a result of the metal/oxide interface.217,218 La0.66Ti0.8Fe0.2O3−δ with A-site deficiency exhibited stable electrochemical performance over 300 h with the current density maintained above 0.5 A cm−2 and the exsolution of Fe on the surface was found to be important for the high performance.219

Simultaneous electrolysis of CO2 and H2O is proposed to produce value-added chemicals through the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) reaction besides simple H2 or CO.196,220,221 Fe(O) was placed on the top of the La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ cathode of an electrolyser for the in situ production of H2/CO and CH4 during the co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O.222 The Faraday efficiency was high for the production of H2/CO at a high-temperature (e.g. 800 °C), but the production of CH4 could be greatly enhanced by decreasing the temperature for the FT reaction223 or increasing the operating pressure of the cathode.224
Detailed summaries on CO2 and H2O co-electrolysis were found in a recent review by Zhang et al. and Bao et al.:196,225 Ni(O) cermet is still the popular choice for the cathode. Because the overpotential for CO2 dissociation is much higher than H2O,221 the direct electrolysis of CO2 in mixed CO2 and H2O will not be significant unless the CO2 concentration is much higher than that of H2O.220 Therefore, the requirement on the cathode of an electrolyser using CO2 and H2O as feedstock would not differ too much from that using CO2: high stability, oxide-ion conductivity, affinity to CO2 and coke resistance.226 Though the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGSR, H2(g) + CO2(g) = H2O(g) + CO(g)) is thermodynamically favorable at a temperature of >810 °C, the final gas composition could be affected by the residence time of the gas on the electrode and kinetic limitations.227,228
The RWGSR could be beneficial to the production of CO, especially when H2 is introduced along with H2O and CO2.229–231 However, the input of H2O or CO in the cathode chamber could be avoided if an oxide instead of Ni(O) was used as a cathode. The Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ cathode for electrolysis of CO2 and H2O was found to show a smaller polarization resistance than the titanite- or chromite-based counterparts by one order of magnitude.232 An A-site deficient La0.7Sr0.2NixCoyFe1−x−yO3−δ (x, y = 0; x = 0, y = 0.2; x = 0.1, y = 0.1; x = 0.2, y = 0) cathode with varied Co or Ni content showed a higher Faraday efficiency and H2/CO ratio when Ni is used to replace Co because the Co doped ones could be oxidized by CO2 or H2O during the electrolysis.233 The La0.7Sr0.2Ni0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode was found to be stable at a current density of <20 mA cm−2 and the CO/H2 ratio in the efflux and the Faraday efficiency were found to increase with temperature from 700 °C to 800 °C.234
4 Iron-based oxygen electrodes
Oxygen atoms diffusing into the porous matrix of the cathode of an SOFC are supposed to be reduced to O2−, while the O2− generated from the cathode of an SOEC will be transported to the oxygen electrode to be oxidized to oxygen molecules in the anode. The partial reduction of SFO can create oxygen vacancies and increase oxide-ion conduction, provided that the oxide-ion defects are not in a long-range ordered state. However, SFO in the extreme case can also be reduced to Sr2Fe2O5,235 an orthorhombic brownmillerite below 850 °C.30 The brownmillerite-type Sr2Fe2O5 containing ordered corner-sharing 〈FeO4〉 tetrahedra and 〈FeO6〉 octahedra can possibly transform into a Ca2Mn2O5-type structure with 〈FeO5〉 pyramids at temperatures above 850 °C, but the long-range oxygen vacancy ordering in both structures causes low oxide-ion conductivity.30,236
Acceptor doping in LFO, such as Sr2+ on La3+ or Mg2+,Ni2+ on Fe3+ sites, results in the formation of oxide-ion vacancies and an Fe3+ to Fe4+ charge compensating transition, and subsequent enhancements in both electronic and ionic conductivities.237,238 LaFe1−xNixO3−δ (x = 0.2–0.5) with Ni substitution for Fe also showed improved electronic and ionic conductivity compared with the parent LFO239 and a similar TEC ((8.9–11.9) ppm K−1) to the YSZ electrolyte. The ionic conductivity of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3−δ was measured to be 4.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 800 °C240 and the TEC was 12.6 ppm K−1, slightly higher than that of YSZ. A cell based on 10 μm YSZ electrolyte with an SDC buffer layer showed a high power output of 950 mW cm−2 at 750 °C.241 Although no distinct insulating phase was found in a composite of LSF and YSZ at 1400 °C, LSF showed increased cation interdiffusion with YSZ (mostly Zr diffused into the perovskite phase) with the Sr/La ratio in the perovskite that caused the decrease of electronic and ionic conductivity.242 The donor doping of Zr4+ would decrease the oxygen non-stoichiometry of LSF and the undersized Fe3+ dopants in YSZ would compete for the oxygen vacancies.243 CaO doped LFO (LCF) has also attracted attention to avoid the use of SrO as in LSF to reduce Cr poisoning and mitigate the cation diffusion of Sr2+ into the adjacent electrolyte.244
The ionic conductivity of perovskite oxides is in the sequence of manganite < ferrite < cobaltite, but the TEC match between the electrocatalysts with YSZ is in the reverse sequence (Fig. 15). The ultra-high TEC of the cobaltite perovskite could be an indication of structural instability as a result of chemical expansion related to the oxygen loss245 and the spin-state transition of cobalt cations246 upon heating. LSCF plays an important role as the oxygen electrode owing to the high MIEC properties, good structural stability and high electrochemical activity and was reviewed by Jiang.247 LSCF is not compatible with the most popular YSZ electrolyte, but it can be used for GDC or LSGM electrolyte. The Sr and Co incorporation increased the ionic conductivity (σi): e.g. the ionic conductivity of LSCF ranged in the order of 1–10−2 S cm−1 at 800 °C.248 The Sr0.9La0.1CoxFe1−xO3−δ (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.5) cathode on YSZ electrolyte if sintered at 1100 to 1250 °C showed the presence of the Sr–Zr–O layer, the thickness of which increased with Co content.249

La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ is a widely studied composition considering its moderate TEC (around 15.0 ppm K−1 at 700 °C251), decent electrochemical performance and durability. The Rp of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ depends on the preparation technique, e.g. particle size of the powder, calcination temperature, and surface modification (Fig. 16a). The electrode sintered at 1100 °C showed an Rp 10 times than that sintered at 800 °C, while Pd and GDC infiltration into La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ could decrease the Rp by 75%.252

Binary oxides of less reducible cations, such as Nb5+, V5+, Ti4+, and Hf4+, are also deposited onto LSCF to increase the surface stability and surface oxygen exchange coefficient, Kchem.260 The deposition of these less reducible cations was stipulated to decrease the  to the perovskite to decrease the surface segregation of SrO. As these oxides reduce the surface  that accelerates the Kchem and the surface SrO that hinders the Kchem, a volcanic plot can be obtained between the oxygen formation enthalpy of the oxides and the Kchem. Recent studies showed that Group IIIA oxides261 (B2O3, Al2O3, Ga2O3 and In2O3) and NiO262 and MgO263 were effective in increasing the Kchem of LSCF. For example, at 800 °C, the deposition of 0.202 mg cm−2 In2O3 particles increases the coefficient from 4.53 × 10−5 to 2.81 × 10−4 cm s−1 for LSCF and from 2.39 × 10−5 to 9.3 × 10−5 cm s−1 for LSF. More recent work on Pr0.1Ce0.9O2−δ indicates that the acidity of infiltrated binary oxides could be an excellent descriptor of the improvement/degradation of Kchem.264
LSM coated LSCF has been demonstrated to show superior performance than the one without coating under a cathodic current of around 0.1 A cm−2, and this could be related to surface activation under cathodic polarization due to the promotion of oxygen adsorption and/or dissociation associated with an Mn cation by the surface layer of a hybrid (La,Sr)(Mn,Co)O3 phase and the dramatically increased oxygen vacancy population under a cathodic bias.265,266 LSCF inhibited the Cr poisoning as a result of the surface segregation of Co3O4 on the surface of the electrode.267
LSCF/CeO2 heterostructure composite nanofibers achieved an Rp of 0.031 Ω cm2 at 700 °C, approximately 1/5 of that for the LSCF powder cathode (0.158 Ω cm2), because the interfacial cation interdiffusion between CeO2 and LSCF caused aliovalent La3+ doping in the former and valence variation of Co3+ and Fe3+ in the latter to increase the oxygen vacancy concentration and then facilitated the incorporation and transport of oxygen.268,269 La0.8−xBixSr0.2FeO3−δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) showed a decreased conductivity with Bi3+ doping, but the Kchem and chemical diffusion coefficient (Dchem) could be improved with Bi incorporation. Specifically, an Rp of 0.1 Ω cm−2 at 700 °C was obtained for a La0.4Bi0.4Sr0.2FeO3−δ cathode on SDC electrolyte.270
Rare-earth-element-free Ca2Fe2O5−δ, SFO, and BaFeO3−δ were also studied as the parent materials for oxygen electrodes. Ca2Fe2O5−δ, a brownmillerite, is almost stoichiometric at atmospheric oxygen pressure (δ < 0.02). The TEC of Ca2Fe2O5−δ is around 11–13 ppm K−1, matching well with that of electrolyte material, but Ca2Fe2O5−δ has relatively low ionic conductivity, 2 mS cm−1 at 900 °C.271 The cathode based on Ca2Fe2−xCoxO5−δ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) showed its best performance of 0.2 Ω cm−2 at 700 °C when x = 0.2.272 In contrast, the TEC of perovskite-type SFO was very high (40.8 ppm K−1 at 800 °C148), while BaFeO3−δ suffered from the phase change from a corner-sharing perovskite to a face-sharing oxygen-deficient 6H phase at 600 °C in air.44
Due to the drawbacks of SFO and BFO in terms of structural instability and large TECs, doping is generally required for practical oxygen electrode fabrication (Fig. 16b). The donor doping (e.g. La3+ or Nb5+) on the Sr2+/Ba2+ or Fe4+/3+ site is the general technique to improve the stability and reduce the TEC by decreasing the smaller size Fe4+ cation in the structure. The SrFe0.85Ti0.1Ni0.05O3−δ cathode decorated with uniformly distributed and well bonded NiO nanoparticles prepared via reduction under hydrogen for exsolution of Ni0 was found to reduce the Rp by 50% for the ORR.273 Cobalt and titanium substituted SFO (SrTi0.3Fe0.63Co0.07O3−δ) as the oxygen electrode material for an intermediate-temperature SOC provided both excellent oxygen electrode performance and long-term stability even at high current densities (1 A cm−2).274 Mo-doped SFO (SrFe1−xMoxO3, 0 < x < 0.25) was also used for the oxygen electrode148 and the strong hybridization of the Fe-d and O-p states was proposed to promote the formation of oxygen vacancies, allowing for facile bulk oxide-ion diffusivity and electronic conductivity.275
Anion doping in perovskites is also employed to enhance the mobility of oxide ions by increasing the oxygen reduction reaction. Cl− and F− are the popular choices for replacing the oxide ions276,277 in ferrite perovskites (SrFeO3, SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3, and SrFe0.75Mo0.25O3), and the enhancement in electrocatalysis was ascribed to the increase in Kchem and Dchem.278,279 The incorporation of F− or Cl− decreases the valence electrons on O2− and weakens its bonding with cations on the A or B sites, which increases the mobility of oxide ions.
5 Iron-based symmetrical and reversible SOCs
5.1 Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells
One of the recent directions in the development of SOFCs is a symmetrical configuration, where identical electrode materials are used simultaneously for an oxygen electrode and a fuel electrode. In the last decade, the development of symmetrical SOFCs has gained a lot of interest,8,48,280 because of the simple fabrication process with one thermal treatment step for both electrodes to reduce the cost of cell production and provide a possible way for reversing the sulfur degradation and carbon deposition by reversing the gas flow in the fuel electrode chamber to an oxidizing atmosphere. Therefore, this state-of-the-art approach could allow for higher tolerance of sulfur- and carbon-containing fuels. However, the challenges of symmetrical SOCs lie in the selection of electrode materials boasting acceptable structural stability and electrical conductivity in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres as well as reasonable electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction at the oxygen electrode and fuel oxidation at the fuel electrode.140 The development of symmetrical SOFCs has been reviewed in ref. 8 and 48, but we focus here more on iron-based symmetrical electrodes.

5.1.1 (Sr,Ba)FeO3-based oxides. 
The electrode materials for symmetrical SOCs were initially limited to structurally stable oxides or mixed compounds under both reducing and oxidizing conditions.112 Among the redox stable materials, iron-based perovskites could be potentially used as both anode and cathode materials in symmetrical SOFCs. SFO in air presented a semiconductor-type behavior between room temperature and 500 °C, which could be described by the small polaron conduction mechanism. A decrease in conductivity was observed as the temperature increased above 500 °C in air, which was related to the thermal reduction of Fe4+ to lower valence states and the consequent decrease in the number of charge carriers.281 The high-valence transition-metal doping in SFO results in a decrease in conductivity in air due to the decrease of Fe4+ in the Fe4+–O–Fe3+ transition for electron/hole transport (Fig. 17a).

The conductivity of SFO containing 25% B-site doped cations in SrFe0.75Ti0.25O3 showed a maximum value of 40 S cm−1 at 600 °C.282 The isothermal conductivity of undoped SFO is sensitive to the oxygen content and oxygen partial pressure: it showed a p-type conducting behavior under oxygen partial pressures above 10−5 atm and predominant n-type conduction below 10−15 atm at 800 °C.283 The conductivity of SFO in a reducing atmosphere was quite low because of the losing of Fe4+ and the phase transformation to brownmillerite (Sr2Fe2O5) with ordered oxygen vacancies. SFO may be doped on the B site with different more redox stable cations than Fe2+/3+/4+ such as Ti4+, Nb5+, Zr4+, Mo6+, and W6+, to stabilize the cubic polymorph and increase conductivity in a reducing atmosphere (Fig. 17b).132,140
SFO-based materials doped with high valence transition metals can have beneficial effects on the electrochemical performance, making them potentially suitable for use as cathode and anode materials in symmetrical SOFCs. The studies on ferrite-based symmetrical fuel cells are listed in Table 1 with “&” marks.
Ti-doped SFO is also a promising material showing an Rp of 0.5 Ω cm2 in 5% H2–Ar and 0.1 Ω cm2 in air at 800 °C.282 Santos-Gómez et al. reported a maximum power density of 700 mW cm−2 at 800 °C with a Sr0.98Fe0.8Ti0.2O3 symmetrical electrode.112 Zr-doped BaFeO3 (BFZ) on an LSGM (200 μm) electrolyte supported symmetrical SOFC exhibited a peak power density of 1097 mW cm−2 using humidified H2 as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant at 800 °C.139 A Mo-doped SFO perovskite structure was highly attractive for use as both cathode and anode materials in symmetrical SOFCs:129,131,153 Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ exhibiting a cubic structure showed high electrical conductivity both in air and in a hydrogen atmosphere,129 and the Fe/Mo redox couples can be expected to remain mixed-valent in the reducing atmosphere. At 780 °C, the value of electrical conductivity reached up to 550 S cm−1 in air and 310 S cm−1 in H2, respectively.129 An LSGM electrolyte-supported symmetrical cell with a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ|LSGM|& configuration was fabricated and tested with different fuels (Fig. 18). The Rp of the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ electrode in air was 0.10 Ω cm2, while the Rp value in wet H2 was 0.21 Ω cm2 at 850 °C. The maximum power densities at 900 °C in wet H2 and CH4 were 835 and 230 mW cm−2, respectively.

Ca-doping on the Sr site was found to increase the electrical conductivity in humidified H2 and a Sr1.75Ca0.25Fe1.5Mo0.5O3−δ-based symmetrical fuel cell on LSGM electrolyte showed an interface resistance of 0.09 and 0.2 Ω cm2 in air and hydrogen at 800 °C.130 Pd infiltrated Sr1.9FeNb0.9Mo0.1O6−δ was used for the symmetrical electrode, but the conductivity in air was much lower than that in the reducing atmosphere (1.42 × 10−2 S cm−1vs. 8.8 S cm−1).104 The Rp values of Sr1.9FeNb0.9Mo0.1O6−δ were 0.469 and 0.353 Ω cm2 at 800 °C in air and H2, respectively, and could be decreased significantly via Pd infiltration. The power output of the Pd–Sr1.9FeNb0.9Mo0.1O6−δ/SDC/LSGM/& symmetrical cell was 935.4 and 196.5 mW cm−2 at 850 °C in humidified H2 and 17 vol% CH4–83 vol% CO2 fuel, respectively.


5.1.2 RFeO3-based oxides (R = rare earth elements). 
Apart from AFeO3 (A = Sr, Ba) based perovskites, a lot of studies evaluated the potential application of rare earth elements doped in the A site of RFeO3 as the electrodes for symmetrical SOFCs.78,81,82,84,100–103,109,111,121,137,138,284–286 The substitution of rare earth elements on the A site, i.e. La3+, Sm3+, Ce3+/4+, Pr3+/4+, etc., is one way to improve the phase stability of iron-based oxides. Ce-doped SmFeO3 (Sm0.95Ce0.05FeO3−δ, SCFO) oxides have been explored as electrode materials for symmetrical SOFCs.79,111 The partial replacement of Sm by Ce enhanced not only the phase stability, but also the electrical conductivity under reducing conditions. A moderate level of power density with a maximum value of 130 mW cm−2 was achieved at 800 °C for a 700 μm-thick YSZ electrolyte supported single cell with SCFO symmetrical electrodes. Sm0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ (SSF) in composite with GDC showed an Rp of 0.67 Ω cm2 in air and 0.91 Ω cm2 in humidified H2 at 750 °C.78 The peak power density of the symmetrical fuel cell was 201.74 mW cm−2 at 750 °C. However, it was unstable at 800 °C in the humidified H2: the perovskite phase decomposed into Fe and R–P phase SmSrFeO4.
Actually, co-doping in the A-site and B-site of iron-based perovskites is also a popular strategy for designing highly active and stable electrodes for symmetrical SOFCs. La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−δ as the electrode material for symmetrical SOFCs was found to be stable in both oxidizing and moderately reducing environments, with only a minor amount of SrLaFeO4 phase presenting under the reducing conditions.87 At 850 °C, La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−δ-based symmetrical SOFCs illustrated excellent peak power densities not only in H2 fuel (900 mW cm−2) but also in wet CH4/air (522 mW cm−2). The stability of Sr-doped La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ was found to be conditional: oxides with 20% Sc3+ substitution for Fe4+/3+ (La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Sc0.2O3−δ) were stable under H2 at 800 °C, while La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Sc0.1O3−δ could be reduced to a composite containing a small amount of LaSrFeO4.124
Haag et al. reported that rhombohedral LaSr2Fe2CrO9−δ maintained the crystal structure after being reduced at 750 °C, while a small LaSrFeO4 peak presented for LaSr2Fe2CrO9−δ after being reduced at 800 °C.118,287 The electrical conductivities of LSFCr were 65–75 S cm−1 at 500–800 °C in air but, as these are p-type, decreased to 0.01 S cm−1 at 550 °C and to 0.16 S cm−1 at 800 °C when in H2. La0.3Sr0.7Fe1−xCrxO3−δ (x = 0–0.3) is used within a symmetrical SOFC.288 The oxide with the highest Cr content La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ showed an Rp of 0.1 Ω cm2 in air and 0.4 Ω cm2 in wet (ca. 3% H2O) H2 at 800 °C. The increasing Cr doping inhibited the formation of brownmillerite LaSr2Fe3O8 in La0.3Sr0.7FeO3, but La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ still showed a slow decomposition to produce trace R–P LaSrFeO4 plus Fe0 that can be reversibly incorporated into the perovskite lattice during the reoxidation. The cell based on La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ|LDC|LSGM|& showed a 30% power drop within 48 h at 800 °C, which was possibly attributed to the LaSrGa3O7 insulating phase, formed by cation interdiffusion at the LSGM/LDC interface under polarized conditions (Fig. 19).

LSCF, while an efficient cathode for SOFCs,289 is believed to be unstable under a reducing atmosphere for a symmetrical SOFC at a high temperature, but an LSCF|YSZ|& micro-symmetrical SOFC was fabricated successfully to work at 545 °C with a power of 210 mW cm−2. The phase stability of LSCF will be improved via B-site doping, such as Mo and Nb doping.97,102,138 A-site deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)1−xCo0.2Fe0.6Nb0.2O3−δ (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.10) in a symmetrical SOFC97 displayed good structural stability under both cathodic and anodic conditions and the electrochemical performance of the electrode improved via the introduction of A-site deficiency to increase the oxygen-vacancy concentration and a weaker B–O bonding energy promoting the reduction of Fe ions. At 850 °C, the maximum power density of an LSGM electrolyte-supported single cell with (La0.6Sr0.4)0.9Co0.2Fe0.6Nb0.2O3−δ symmetrical electrodes was 651 mW cm−2 operating in H2 fuel and was compatible with fuels such as syngas, ethanol, and CH4. A La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3−δ symmetrical electrode was synthesized by solid-state reaction through doping Mo at the B site of the LSCF cathode.136 XPS revealed that the Fe4+/Fe3+ ratios were 1.2:1 for LSCF and 1:3.3 for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3−δ for the reason of electroneutrality. The Rp of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3−δ in air (0.041 Ω cm2) was quite lower than that in H2 (0.266 Ω cm2) at 800 °C, and the initial performance of the symmetrical fuel cell was found to be stable in either H2 or liquefied petroleum gas.138
PrBaMn2O5+δ with Pr and Ba ordering was reported to be coke resistant anode material showing high MIEC under a reducing atmosphere.25 PrBaMn2O5+δ was synthesized via the hydrogen reduction of oxygenated PrBaMn2O6−δ containing hexagonal BaMnO3 as a secondary phase as a result of the Mn4+ in air. PrBaMn1.5Fe0.5O5−d (PBMFO) showed good stability in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, and high electrical conductivities (112.5 and 7.4 S cm−1 at 800 °C in air and 5% H2/Ar, respectively).290 A single cell based on PBMFO|LSGM(520 μm)|PBMFO exhibited a maximum power density of 0.54 W cm−2 at 800 °C and 0.34 W cm−2 at 850 °C using humidified H2 (3% H2O) and humidified CH4 as fuel, respectively. PrBa(Fe0.8Sc0.2)2O5−δ and (PrBa)0.95(Fe0.9Mo0.1)2O5+δ with a well-formed tetragonal structure were applied as both cathode and anode materials in symmetrical SOFCs.291 PrBa(Fe0.8Sc0.2)2O5−δ retained superior structural stability after annealing in 5% H2/N2 and wet H2 for 10 h at 800 °C. The Rp values were only 0.05 Ω cm2 and 0.18 Ω cm2 at 800 °C in air and humidified H2 (3 wt% H2O), respectively. An LSGM electrolyte-supported cell with PrBa(Fe0.8Sc0.2)2O5−δ (Fig. 20) as symmetrical electrodes exhibited a peak power density of 921 mW cm−2 at 850 °C and 275 mW cm−2 at 900 °C using H2 and CH4 as a fuel, respectively.291 Excellent cycling stability was obtained on the symmetrical cell using wet H2 and ambient air in the anode chamber at 750 °C.

Incorporation of ionic conductive oxides or metal catalysts into iron-based perovskites is also an effective strategy to improve the catalytic activity towards the ORR and FOR in symmetrical SOFCs.86,99 Composite electrodes prepared via the infiltration of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Sc0.1O3−δ perovskites into a porous LSGM skeleton were found to show very small Rp: 0.015 Ω cm2 in air and 0.29 Ω cm2 in hydrogen at 800 °C. The cell with thin LSGM electrolyte and a symmetrical La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Sc0.1O3−δ/LSGM electrode prepared via infiltration showed a maximum power density of 0.56 W cm−2 in wet H2 (3% H2O) at 800 °C.124 La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Sc0.1O3−δ oxide was impregnated as symmetric electrode catalysts into porous 430L substrates and YSZ backbones, and the maximum power density of the cell was 0.65 W cm−2 measured at 800 °C.292 A La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (LCFN)–Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) composite was prepared via infiltration and physical mixing methods,86 and the Fe–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles exsolved through in situ growth were found to induce an enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction. In the meantime, the chemical activity towards the ORR in air was further improved by infiltration of SDC nanoparticles. A symmetrical SOFC with a nano-sized La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ–SDC composite electrode was prepared via infiltration to enhance the performance compared with the one with a physically mixed composite electrode.85 The ASR of the nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ−infiltrated SDC cathode was only 0.009 Ω cm2 at 750 °C in air. Using H2 as a fuel gas, the maximum power density of the cell exhibited a value of 507 mW cm−2 at 800 °C. The authors also tested the cell using a CH4–O2 mixture (molar ratio of 2:1) as fuel and the maximum power density reached 350 mW cm−2 at 800 °C. Sm0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Ti0.15Ru0.05O3−δ was found to be stable at 800 °C in wet H2, and the engineering of A-site deficiency as in Sm0.7Sr0.2Fe0.8Ti0.15Ru0.05O3−δ greatly enhanced the power output of the symmetrical SOFC as a result of the exsolution of Ru0 in the latter.110 La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.7Ga0.3O3−δ oxide with a moderate TEC of 13.79 ppm K−1 in air and 13.88 ppm K−1 in 5% H2 at 200–800 °C was stable as the electrode material for a symmetrical SOFC using H2 containing 100 ppm H2S and humidified 17CH4–83CO2 as the fuel.105


5.1.3 R–P phase oxides for a symmetrical SOFC. 
In Section 2.2, quite a few perovskite oxides were found to decompose into stable R–P phase ferrites along with the formation of metal catalysts, indicating that the latter could be stable in a reducing atmosphere. R–P phase oxides, such as A2NiO4 and A2CoO4, are good candidates as oxygen electrodes due to the interstitial sites in the rock-salt AO layers which can accommodate excess oxide ions assisting their high oxygen-diffusion and surface-exchange coefficients,293–296 and thus R–P phase ferrites can be easily fitted into symmetrical SOFCs.
The simplest R–P phase oxide, K2NiF4-type crystal structure has been found to have much better stability than simple ferrite perovskites under reducing conditions.27 LaSrFeO4−δ showed reasonable stability according to low oxygen release down to oxygen partial pressures of 10−10 Pa at a temperature of 800 °C in Ar/H2/H2O.297 LaxSr2–xFeO4 (x = 0.6–1.4) showed good stability in 5% H2/Ar at 850 °C for 20 h and were evaluated as electrode materials for symmetrical SOFCs.298 The electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr1.4FeO4 was 23 S cm−1 at 800 °C in air, but the highest electrical conductivity was only 0.20 S cm−1 in 5% H2/Ar. Meanwhile, LaxSr2–xFeO4 showed better catalytic activity toward the ORR than H2 oxidation reaction. At 800 °C, a cell with LSGM electrolyte and a La0.8Sr1.2FeO4–LSGM mixture as symmetrical electrodes showed a maximum power density of 73 mW cm−2. LaSrCo0.5Fe0.5O4 was stable under reducing conditions (10% H2/N2) up to 800 °C, forming a nonstoichiometric LaSrCo0.5Fe0.5O3.75 phase,299 but La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4−δ (Fig. 21) as electrode materials for symmetrical SOFCs showed a small Co0 peak after reduction at 850 °C for 20 h in a flow of 5% H2/Ar.300 Although nano-sized Co0 particles (∼10 nm) exsolved on the surface of the reduced sample, the oxygen non-stoichiometry implied that the remnant R–P phase remained stable, even after five redox cycles between air and 5% H2. The Co doping on the Fe site increased the electrical conductivity and electrocatalysis for the FOR in the reducing atmosphere, which is similar to a perovskite material, as a result of the exsolved metallic particles.

5.2 Symmetrical solid oxide electrolysis cells
As mentioned previously, Fe-based perovskite oxides are candidates as oxygen electrode materials for SOECs; thus efficient electrolysis of pure CO2 has been achieved in symmetrical SOECs with Fe-based perovskite electrodes.204,212 The Fe-based oxides for symmetrical SOECs are summarized in Table 2.

SOECs with symmetrical La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Ti0.3O3 electrodes for electrolysis of pure CO2 at 800 °C showed an Rp of 0.08 Ω cm2 and a current density of 521 mA cm−2 at 2.0 V.202 La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Mn0.1O3−δ with a surface area of 22.93 m2 g−1 was used as the symmetrical electrodes for high-temperature electrolysis of pure CO2.301 The electrolysis cell on a YSZ electrolyte support with a GDC blocking layer showed an Rp of 0.068 Ω cm2 and a current density of 1.1 A cm−2 at 800 °C under an operating voltage of 2.0 V. Ni-doping in La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ (La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ) increased the oxygen vacancies and effectively enhanced the chemical adsorption ability of CO2 as a symmetrical cell for electrolysis of pure CO2.302,303 Although the main perovskite phase was retained after pure CO2 treatment for 24 h, SrCO3 a secondary phase emerged in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern after electrolysis at 850 °C.302 The maximum current density reached was 1.42 A cm−2 at 2.0 V for CO2 electrolysis with high Faraday efficiency if in situ exsolved Ni–Fe nanoparticles were initiated on the cathode side under pre-reduction in H2.303 Several studies were focused on Mo-doped ferrite perovskites for both cathode and anode materials simultaneously in SOECs.212,229,305 For example, a symmetrical cell with Sr2FeMoO6 infiltrated into the symmetrical tri-layer structure of porous-LSGM exhibited a current density of 1.24 A cm−2 at 1.5 V at 800 °C for pure CO2 electrolysis. Fe-based perovskites have also been applied as symmetrical electrodes for co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O in SOECs.196 A cell consisting of a 150 μm YSZ electrolyte and 15 μm GDC buffer layers and La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3−δ symmetrical electrodes showed a current density of 0.638 A cm−2 at 850 °C under an applied voltage of 1.3 V using a 75% CO2–15% H2O–10% H2 mixture at the fuel electrode.231
Because the cathode and anode of a symmetrical SOEC can survive in a reducing atmosphere and fuel (e.g. H2, C and CH4) can be introduced in the anode chamber to decrease the external voltage that is required to initiate the dissociation of H2O or CO2 on the cathode,307 the introduction of H2 on the anode will not be meaningful in terms of energy efficiency, but the introduction of widely available natural gas will decrease the consumption of electricity and increase the overall efficiency of an SOEC to 70% from 32% of a conventional SOEC.308
The first symmetrical CH4-assisted SOEC (Ce/Cu/Co/YSZ|YSZ (50 μm)|&) prepared via impregnation showed a current density of 0.2 A cm−2 at 0.4 V for the dissociation of steam.309 The overall reaction for the CH4-assisted electrolysis of H2O is the same as the one for methane steam reforming (CH4(g) + H2O(g) = 3H2(g) + CO(g)), but the former can produce pure H2 on the cathode that can be used for PEMFCs.
A symmetrical electrolysis cell with a (La,Sr)(Co,Fe,Mn)O3 electrode was proposed for the oxidation of methane on the anode;307 further demonstrations were on symmetrical cells based on Mo-doped SrFeO3 for the partial oxidation of CH4 to produce mixed CO and H2.307 Ni infiltration into a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ-SDC anode was found to increase the current density of the CH4-assisted electrolyser.310 A symmetrical cell with an “Sr2Fe1.5+xFe0.5O6−δ” (0 < x < 0.1) anode311 was found to be efficient in producing C2H4 (ethylene) from CH4. Solid carbon deposited on the anode of a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ/SDC|LSGM (500 μm)|& was also effective in decreasing the potential for the electrolysis of CO2/H2O on the cathode. As the oxidation of O2− from the cathode is proposed to take place in the electrolyte/anode interfacial region, the chemical or electrochemical nature of the fuel-assisted electrolysis is not very clear. Because the build-up of oxygen pressure on the anode/electrolyte interface was found to be one of the reasons for the delamination of an SOEC,312 the introduction of fuel in the anode chamber could also affect the long-term stability of the anode.
5.3 Reversible RSOCs
The coupling of an SOFC and an SOEC for energy storage using the conversion between H2O, CO2 feedstock and H2, CO fuel could be performed on the same cell in different operating modes or separate cells. The advantage of an RSOC that can operated in the fuel-cell or electrolysis mode is obvious because it can reduce the cost and space, but it at the same time puts an extra demand for the material to reduce the cell loss. The working progress and development of RSOCs have been reviewed very recently by Mogensen et al.,54 and we focus more on iron-based electrodes for RSOCs. As the ferrite oxygen electrode and fuel electrode have been discussed previously, the work on ferrite electrodes is basically more on demonstration.
The performance of oxygen electrodes would vary under a cathodic or anodic current in an SOFC and SOEC mode, respectively.313,314 LSCF and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ perovskites315,316 are used as oxygen electrodes for RSOCs. Specifically, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ exhibited good performance in the SOFC as well as SOEC mode. In the SOFC mode, the single cell using La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ as an oxygen electrode showed the maximum power density of 961 mW cm−2 and Rp of 0.142 Ω cm2 at 800 °C, while in the SOEC mode, the hydrogen production rate of RSOCs was up to 1348.5 mL cm−2 h−1.
Symmetrical SOCs with ferrite electrodes have also been demonstrated as RSOCs for power generation and CO2 reduction. A single cell with the LSFCr La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ|GDC|YSZ|GDC|La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ symmetrical configuration205 was examined as a CO/CO2 fuel electrode material in both the SOFC mode and SOEC mode respectively. The cell exhibited a decent electrochemical performance during both the SOEC mode and SOFC mode. The La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3−δ porous backbone doped with CeO2 can be used as a fuel electrode in different CO/CO2 atmospheres under reversible SOFC and SOEC operating conditions.107 At 850 °C, a current density of 3.56 A cm−2 was obtained at 2.0 V in 50% CO + 50% CO2 in the SOEC mode, while the maximum power density was 437 mW cm−2 at 800 °C in 70% CO + 30% CO2 in the SOFC mode. A slow degradation in both the SOFC and SOEC modes was observed during the reversible operation. Bian et al.304 found that La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Nb0.1O3−δ perovskite oxide used as a symmetric electrode for both SOFCs and H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis cells showed a peak power density of 1157 mW cm−2 (Fig. 22) at 850 °C in the SOFC mode and a current density of 1464 mA cm−2 was obtained at 1.3 V in the SOEC mode. The CO/H2 ratio in the output gas was ∼1.2–1.3 and was insensitive to the applied current density. The cell can electrolyze CO2 or CO2/H2O at high Faraday efficiency (96.5%) without carbon deposition.

6. Summary and outlook
The need to decrease the cost and impact on the environment is a huge opportunity to promote the industrialization of SOCs. Iron is one of the most earth-abundant and available elements. Iron-based materials have been selected to fabricate key components of SOFCs and SOECs for several decades. The stability and “flexibility” of the Fe–O bond allow for efficient doping of other highly active elements in FeO6 octahedra. It also provides adjustable conductivity due to the multiple valence states and coordination number changes of Fe in iron-based oxides. The interesting interaction of Fe–O brings many sectors to design new iron-based materials. In addition to academic research, it can be found that iron-based materials are also applied in commercial electrochemical devices or stacks. These motivate the extensive use of iron-based materials in the future.
Iron-based alloys can be used as supports for fuel cells to provide mechanical strength and electronic conduction, while iron-based oxides can be used for either fuel electrodes or oxygen electrodes because they are more reducible than chromite and titanate in creating MIECs and more stable than cobaltite or manganite in a reducing atmosphere. Iron-based oxides have attracted increasing attention for SOCs due to their variable oxygen stoichiometries in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, providing the opportunity to generate Fe0 metals/alloys for boosted electrocatalysis. Generally, replacing ca. 20% Fe4+/3+ in a perovskite with stable cations, such as Zr4+, Ti4+, Cr3+, and Ga3+, is able to prevent the decomposition or formation of brownmillerite under fuel conditions, while substituting Fe3+/4+ with Ni2+ or Co3+ is able to cause the exsolution metal catalyst to enhance the adsorption and dissociation processes in the FOR. Iron-based oxides also provide the opportunities for tunable properties to reach the balance between the TEC and MIEC via the doping strategy since Fe4+ in a perovskite can be reduced thermally in air for chemical expansion, while Fe3+ is fairly stable. Moreover, the abundant valence states of Fe in ferrites demonstrate their great potential for application as catalysts in a wide range of oxygen partial pressures. All these properties dictated by the thermodynamics of the valency energy of Fe–O bonding provide iron-based materials the opportunities to be used for the anode and cathode of an SOFC or SOEC.
Recent developments in SOCs also provide the opportunities for new electrochemical syntheses: for example, Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3−δ, (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Fe0.8Ni0.1Mo0.1O3−δ and Pr0.6Ba0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3−δ have been used for the electrochemical production of ethylene from ethane in a protonic SOC at 750 °C and ammonia at low temperature, respectively.317–319 Along with the development of protonic conducting SOCs operating at low temperatures,320–322 the special properties of iron-based materials will enable them to find more opportunities to be used to balance the stability and performance, especially in symmetrical cells.139,323
Although high performance has been achieved using iron-based electrodes, there are several challenges remaining to be addressed. While the development of metal-supported SOCs can provide a thin electrolyte to reduce the ohmic resistance at lower temperatures, it is very difficult to use ferrite oxides with low melting points as supports unless costly deposition techniques were used to prepare thin electrolytes.143 The reactivity of ferrites with popular zirconia normally needs to be addressed by the blocking layer to inhibit the unexpected reaction, while the LSGM/ferrite perovskite interfacial stability needs to be monitored for longer times. The development of ferrite electrocatalysts was confined mainly on perovskites, and the development of other types of oxides was required to reduce the use of costly rare earth elements or mobile alkaline earth elements.324 It is significant to clarify the stability and controlled phase evolution of iron-based oxides as fuel electrodes under long-term operation, especially in pure hydrogen or hydrocarbon at high temperatures. Combined in situ operando characterization techniques (e.g. XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS) and the theoretical simulation could give a comprehensive analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of iron-based oxides. Although nano-sized metallic particles can be exsolved from iron-based oxides to enhance the electrochemical activity, future studies may focus on pursuing in situ growth on various exsolved nanoparticles or alloy nanoparticles, which can be used as high-performance catalysts for mixed gases as fuels. Overall, iron-based materials have showed great potential for application in SOCs, allowing an increasing commercialization of these energy conversion technologies in the near future.

Broader context
The aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2) can be achieved by either improving the conversion efficiency of fossil fuels or integrating renewable energies (such as solar and wind). However, these renewable energies are intermittent and do not always meet the timing of consumption unless a large-scale energy storage device is integrated into the grid. Solid oxide cells excelling at a highly efficient conversion between the electrical and chemical energies can increase both the efficiency of electricity production from fossil fuels and serve as energy-storage devices. As the polarization loss is crucially important in impeding the to and fro conversion, efficient and robust electrode materials are pursued to enable an excellent performance and long-term operation. Iron-based materials are promising candidates due to the optimum valency energy of Fe–O bonds in creating oxide-ion vacancies under both air and fuel conditions, compared to other transition-metal-based electrodes. Here, recent advances of iron-based electrode materials in metal/alloy or complex oxides are reviewed in terms of solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers, as well as in reversible operation, with an emphasis on exploring critical understandings of hydrocarbon electrochemical oxidation or CO2/H2O reduction.
