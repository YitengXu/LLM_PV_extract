    , Accepted 19th December 2012First published on 20th December 2012AbstractBiVO4/CuWO4 heterojunction electrodes were prepared using spray deposition of a highly porous bismuth vanadate film onto the surface of an electrodeposited three dimensional network connected copper tungstate. Bilayer BiVO4/CuWO4/fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO) electrodes demonstrated higher photocurrent magnitudes than either with BiVO4/FTO or CuWO4/FTO electrodes in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte buffered at pH 7. The photocurrent is enhanced by the formation of the heterojunction that aids charge carrier collection brought about by the band edge offsets. When the pH 7 buffered electrolytes contained 1.0 M bicarbonate is employed instead of 1.0 M sulfate, the charge transfer resistance was decreased. This led to nearly 1.8 times the photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent was stable over 24 hours in bicarbonate electrolyte.
Introduction
Solar energy conversion and utilization through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has great potential as it would be sustainable, a carbon neutral process, and economically produces a high energy density fuel.1–5 The research interest in this area is stimulated around the development of visible light active and stable photoelectrodes. Development of new electrode configurations with high efficiency and good stability is extremely important for enhanced water splitting. For the past few decades, inexpensive metal oxides have been the primary choice of photoelectrodes for PEC water oxidation due to their stability. In particular, WO3 with a band gap of 2.7 eV, has been extensively explored for water oxidation photoelectrodes. However, it forms soluble tungstates in pH > 5 electrolytes,6,7 thus making it unstable under neutral pH electrolytes. Recently, electrodeposited CuWO4 film electrode having hybridized Cu-3d and O-2p orbitals contributing to the valence band maxima, exhibited good stability under dark and illuminated conditions in neutral pH electrolyte.8 The hybridization of Cu-d orbitals with O-p orbitals in CuWO4 induces strong covalency in the metal–oxo bonds and consequently reduces the formation of soluble tungstates. CuWO4 electrodes for PEC water oxidation have been reported by several groups.9–12 Although, the visible light absorption was improved when Cu was added to the WO3 host, the photocurrent was not improved significantly for this indirect band gap semiconductor. This might be due to the creation of an empty Cu (3dx2−y2) orbital, which, in turn, would be detrimental to the transport properties of the host.13,14 Therefore, it is necessary to improve the transport properties as well as electron transfer kinetics of CuWO4, either by modifying the surface with an oxygen evolution catalyst, or by fabrication of a heterojunction configuration through integration of a semiconductor with suitable band edges. Fabrication of a heterojunction electrode configuration with simultaneous illumination of two junctions improves the overall efficiency of semiconductors through the combined virtues of each interface.15–20 In particular, CuWO4 having low band gap compared to WO3 offers great advantage in designing heterojunction electrode configuration. One approach to this has been recently reported based on a CuWO4–WO3 heterojunction electrode configuration which exhibited improved PEC characteristics.14 In this direction, the design of new heterojunction electrode configurations based on CuWO4 is extremely important to improve its photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity.
Recently, BiVO4 has shown particular promise for water oxidation with moderate band gap between 2.4–2.6.21–23 Several approaches such as doping, composition variation and integration of oxygen evolution catalysts have been reported to improve the efficiency of BiVO4.24–26 Another, interesting approach to further improve the efficiency of BiVO4 would be the incorporation of porosity.27 In this study, we developed a promising heterojunction photoelectrode BiVO4/CuWO4/fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO) by integration of porous BiVO4 layer with the electrodeposited CuWO4 film. Surfactant directed electrodeposition method using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and metal–organic decomposition were utilized to prepare CuWO4 and BiVO4 electrodes with a network connected and a porous morphologies respectively. The presence of porous structure would enhance the depletion layer volume and the charge carrier collection at the electrolyte interface, which in turn improves the PEC efficiency.24,27 In addition, the dependence of the PEC characteristics on electrolyte composition of aqueous electrolyte solution is investigated. The presence of carbonate ions in the electrolyte has been found to significantly enhance the photocurrent of oxide semiconductor electrodes.28–31 In the present study, we also describe the effect of carbonate anions, on the PEC characteristics of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes.
Experimental section
The porous CuWO4/FTO electrodes used in this study were prepared in the presence of a structure directing agent by modifying the electrodeposition method described by Yourey et al.8 The CuWO4 films were electrodeposited on FTO plates from a 25 mL bath composed of 25 mM Cu(NO3)2·nH2O, 25 mM H2W2O11 and 5 wt% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The acidic peroxotungstate precursor was prepared by adding concentrated 30% H2O2 to an appropriate amount of Na2WO4·2H2O in high purity water. The pH of the resulting solution ranged between 10.5 and 10.8. The acidity of the final deposition solution was adjusted to pH 1.1 by adding 2–3 mL of concentrated HNO3.2 CuWO4 films were electrodeposited on F-doped SnO2 coated on transparent glass (FTO; 20–23 Ω sq−1) after being cleaned by sonication in ethanol and then in acetone for 10 min each. A three-electrode setup with FTO, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as working, counter and reference electrodes respectively was used for electrodeposition. Amorphous white films of 5 μm thickness were deposited on a 1 cm2 area of the FTO when submerged in a stirred stock solution. The potential was swept between +0.3 V to −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 12 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using Gamry (Reference 600) potentiostat. These films were subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 2 h and resulted in bright yellow CuWO4/FTO electrodes. The porous BiVO4 electrodes were prepared by a surfactant assisted metal organic decomposition method.27 The precursor solution for the deposition of the film was obtained by mixing solutions of Bi, and V in the presence of a structure directing agent. Specifically, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99% trace metal basis, Aldrich) was dissolved in an acetic acid, water mixture, followed by addition of 0.3 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). To prepare the V solution, a stoichiometric amount of vanadium(V) tri-i-propoxy oxide (98%, Strem Chemicals) was dissolved in acetylacetone (C5H8O2). The two solutions were mixed in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of Bi to V and stirred for 0.5 h. The resulting precursor solution with the desired atomic percentage ratios of Bi:V as 1:1 was spray-coated on FTO glass using a Grex Tritium double action air brush and consequently annealed at 500 °C for 6 h in an air atmosphere to get BiVO4/FTO. The spray coating and calcination steps were repeated to get BiVO4 film of thickness 5 μm. To prepare BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes, first a 2.5 μm thick film of CuWO4 was coated on FTO using electrodeposition by sweeping the potential between +0.3 V to −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 6 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A subsequent layer of BiVO4 with thickness of 2.5 μm was spray coated using a Grex Tritium double action air brush and consequently annealed at 500 °C for 6 h in an air atmosphere to get BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes with thickness of 5 μm.
The crystal structure of as synthesized electrodes was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips X'pert X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a CARY 5E UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The thicknesses of the electrodes were measured by a profilometer (Tencor® P-10 surface profiler). The surface morphology and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the as-synthesized electrodes was analyzed using a FE-SEM, JEOL 7000 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer. The Photoelectrochemical setup for the action spectra consisted of a 100 W tungsten arc lamp housing with an LPS-220 lamp power supply (Photon Technology International), a model SID-101 monochromator (Photon Technology International), and an EG&G model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research). Light exiting the monochromator was chopped at 37 Hz, and an optical filter was used to block any second-order diffraction. The signal was detected using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier using the chopping frequency as a reference. The spectral output of the lamp and monochromator was measured using a thermopile detector in place of the electrochemical cell. The voltage output from the thermopile is proportional to the incident power and it was plotted vs. photon energy. To obtain photon flux from this plot, the photocurrent signal at each wavelength was divided by the energy (eV) of that wavelength. The semiconductor photocurrent spectrum was divided by the photon flux spectra to get a normalized spectrum. In these tests the electrode was held at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and the photocurrent at each monochromatic light was registered. All other photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature in a three-electrode cell with a flat glass window using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat interfaced to a computer. CuWO4/BiVO4/FTO, CuWO4/FTO or BiVO4/FTO electrodes were used as the working electrode with Pt sheet (∼3 cm2) and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A 1.0 M Na2SO4 or 1.0 M NaHCO3 aqueous solutions (pH 7 phosphate buffer) were used as the electrolytes for the PEC measurements. This buffer solution is prepared by dissolving, chemvelop hydrion buffer (pH 7, Fisher scientific) in 500 mL of water. The PEC responses were measured using a 300 W Oriel Xenon lamp to illuminate the photoelectrodes. A 55 mm diameter water filter was placed in the beam path between the light source and photoelectrochemical cell to avoid the heating up of the solution due to IR radiation and the output light intensity was set using a GaInP2 reference cell (Eg = 1.8 eV) calibrated to AM1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA. Dynamic chopped light and steady state linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were scanned in the anodic direction at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The flat band potentials were determined from open-circuit potentials of the electrodes under illumination.32 The open-circuit potentials were measured under 5-sun illumination. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed in a three-electrode setup and using a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport Oriel), integrated with a parabolic reflector, collimated lens assembly, passing through a computer-controlled monochromator. Sample photocurrent data was normalized to the output of a calibrated silicon photodiode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a potentiostat and frequency response detector (Solartron SI1260 impedance/gain analyzer). The Nyquist plots were measured at 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with an AC amplitude of 10 mV, frequency of 100 kHz–100 mHz under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The measured spectra were fitted using the ZView software program. For stability measurements, a bias potential of 0.4 V vs. Pt counter electrode was applied in a two electrode setup. The photoelectrodes were illuminated with calibrated AM1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) from a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport Oriel).
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction patterns of annealed films of bare CuWO4/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes are shown in Fig. 1a.

XRD patterns of all electrodes studied showed strong peaks for SnO2 originating from FTO substrate. The CuWO4 electrodes exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to a triclinic structure (JCPDS card no. 70-1732). An indexed XRD pattern of CuWO4 is presented in Fig. S1a (ESI†). After deposition and annealing of a BiVO4 layer the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO films exhibited peaks corresponding to BiVO4 and CuWO4. The bare BiVO4 electrodes correspond to a monoclinic scheelite type crystal structure (JCPDS card no. 14-0688). Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and CuWO4/FTO electrodes and the band edges of the absorption spectra were ca. 518, 516 and 532 nm respectively. The slower rise in absorbance of CuWO4/FTO as compared to the sharp increase in absorption for BiVO4/FTO suggests that CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes possess indirect and direct band gaps respectively. The absorption spectrum of the CuWO4/FTO exhibited two bands in the range of 300–550 nm. A peak around 390 nm and a shoulder at ∼450 nm have been observed. These transitions are assigned to W(5d) ← O (2p) LMCT band and W(5d) ← Cu(3d) MMCT band respectively.33 The absorption tail extended to a much longer wavelength of 650 nm and it could be attributed to the presence of defect levels within the band gap of CuWO4. In addition, localized d–d-transitions in Cu2+ exhibited an absorption band at wavelengths longer than 650 nm (Fig. S1b, ESI†).8 For BiVO4 the absorption tail extended to a much longer wavelength of 700 nm and was attributed to the presence of ionic defect levels with in the band gap due to the oxygen vacancies.34 The band gaps of the CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes were determined from the photocurrent action spectra and were found to be 2.33 and 2.40 eV respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). SEM images of representative CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes are shown in Fig. 1c and d respectively. The particles of CuWO4 were assembled to form a three dimensional network structure by electrodeposition in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1c). The presence of SDS in the electrolyte invoked significant change in the morphology as observed in the SEM images (Fig. S3, ESI†). The formation of nanostructured films during the electrodeposition process in the presence of a surfactant was attributed to the controlled interaction of surfactant–inorganic aggregates at solid–liquid interfaces under electrochemical control.35,36 Further, the surface morphology analysis of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes revealed a porous morphology for the top BiVO4 layer. The formation of a porous structure for BiVO4 was attributed to the removal of the micellar cores at high temperatures from the micellar-inorganic units.27 The elemental mapping of CuWO4 electrodes demonstrated an even distribution of Cu and W elements throughout the annealed film (Fig. S4, ESI†). The elemental mapping of the BiVO4 layer of the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited the distribution of Bi, V, O elements with some amount of W dispersion (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The effect of spray deposited BiVO4 film on photocurrent generation of CuWO4 electrode was investigated by examining PEC responses of the heterojunction BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode, CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes. Typical current vs. potential responses under chopped light illumination are shown in Fig. 2a.

All three electrodes (CuWO4/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO) generated anodic photocurrents upon illumination indicating n-type character of the electrodes. The BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode exhibited enhanced photocurrents compared to CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. This is typically due to the enhanced charge separation brought about by band-edge offsets in the case of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode. Further, to investigate the effect of carbonate ions on the photocurrent generation, PEC studies were performed on the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode by replacing 1.0 M Na2SO4 with 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte. The photocurrent of the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode in the bicarbonate electrolyte was dramatically improved, so as to reach 2.18 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In addition, photocurrent-potential characteristics of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes were measured through backside illumination. The photocurrent of backside illuminated BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode was decreased compared to the front side illuminated electrode as the front side illumination has favourable band edge offsets compared to the back side illumination. Typical steady state photocurrents vs. potential characteristics of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte and in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolytes were measured under illumination and dark conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†). The BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode exhibited a negative shift of ca. 230 mV in the photocurrent onset potential (Fig. S6a, ESI†) in the presence of 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, photocurrent-potential profiles measured in 1.0 M NaHCO3 under dark exhibited a negative shift (∼230 mV) in the onset potential for O2 evolution compared to in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. S6b, ESI†). This suggests that oxygen evolution reaction kinetics were improved for the heterojunction BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to in 1.0 M Na2SO4.
The chopped light I–V studies were also performed on CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes in 1.0 M NaHCO3 and are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Increased photocurrent in sodium bicarbonate electrolyte is surmised to be based on the catalytic effect of HCO3− and easy desorption of O2 gas from the BiVO4 surface.30 The PEC characteristics were also improved for CuWO4/FTO (Fig. S7a, ESI†) and BiVO4/FTO (Fig. S7b, ESI†) electrodes in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to that of 1.0 M Na2SO4 (Fig. 2a). The photocurrent onset potentials of CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO are found be around −0.12 V and −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) respectively (Inset of the Fig. S7, ESI†). The measured flat band potentials from illuminated open-circuit voltages were found to be −0.13 V and −0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl for CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). These measured flat band potential values are similar to the photocurrent onset potential values.
Assuming a type II heterojunction and the band gap energy values obtained from the photocurrent action spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†), a schematic illustration of charge transfer processes at the heterojunction BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode under irradiation is depicted (Fig. 2b). Due to the existence of the relatively negative valence band (VB) and CB positions of BiVO4 to that of CuWO4 band levels, the photogenerated electrons can easily transfer from the conduction band of BiVO4 to that of CuWO4. This facile electron injection process would reduce the probability of recombination of holes formed in the valence bands of the two semiconductors. Moreover, the lower more positive valence band of the CuWO4 acts as a barrier to any holes in the BiVO4 and prevents them from diffusing to the FTO. Consequently, the number of holes that can reach the electrode/electrolyte interface would be enhanced leading to efficient PEC water oxidation.
In order to assess the dynamics of water oxidation, photocurrent vs. time measurements were performed on BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes in 1.0 M Na2SO4 and 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolytes (Fig. 3). Current vs. time (chronoamperometry) measurements were performed at different bias potentials 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) while the illumination was turned on and off.
 Fig. 3  Transient photocurrent densities measured with chopped light (100 mW cm−2) for BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes at 0.2 V (a); 0.4 V (b); 0.6 V (c) and 0.8 V (d) vs. Ag/AgCl in (i) 1.0 M Na2SO4 (pH 7) and (ii) 1.0 M NaHCO3 (pH 7) aqueous solutions. 
The photocurrents were enhanced by 5.0, 3.0, 2.3 and 1.9 at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 V respectively for BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. This suggests that the photocurrent enhancement observed in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte is more significant at lower potentials. An analogous effect of photocurrent enhancement at low bias potentials was observed on oxygen evolution catalyst modified BiVO4 based electrodes compared to unmodified BiVO4 electrodes.24,27 In addition, the photocurrent transients (spikes) were absent for BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. This suggests that HCO3− is more catalytically favourable compared to SO42− in the electrolyte.
In order to examine the effect of HCO3− ions on Rct over SO42− ions in the electrolyte, the EIS measurements were performed on BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO in 1.0 M NaHCO3 and 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolytes (Fig. 4). The deduced equivalent circuit for the photoanode (inset of Fig. 4) consists of solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) in parallel to the constant phase element (CPE). The charge transfer resistance at the electrode interface was obtained from the diameter of the semicircle. The measured Rct values for Nyquist plots of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes from the model fits were found to be 1630 and 2891 Ω respectively. The reduced Rct indicates that the charge transfer at the interface has been significantly improved in the presence of HCO3−. Similar effect of enhanced charge transfer was observed by Chatchai et al.37 at the interface of heterojunction electrode modified with catalyst particles. In addition, the Rct values for Nyquist plots of CuWO4/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes from the model fits measured in 1.0 M NaHCO3 were found to be 2368, 1490 and 1630 Ω respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). The high charge transfer resistance values elucidate the low PEC activity of the CuWO4/FTO electrode and could be due to its poor charge transfer characteristics. This has been overcome by forming the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO heterojunction electrode as evident from the low Rct and high PEC activities.

Fig. 5 shows the IPCE plots of CuWO4/FTO and BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes measured at 0.3, 0.5, 0.62 and 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
 Fig. 5  IPCE plots of (a) CuWO4/FTO and (b) BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes measured at 0.3, 0.5, 0.62 and 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1.0 M NaHCO3 (pH 7). 
The higher IPCE values for BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO (Fig. 5b) electrodes compared to that of CuWO4/FTO (Fig. 5a) confirm that the formation of a heterojunction configuration with CuWO4 and BiVO4 layer enhances the solar light conversion efficiency by increasing the photoinduced charge carrier separation in both UV and visible regions.
The BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode exhibited IPCE value of 42% at 450 nm measured under an applied bias of 0.62 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The obtained IPCE values were either higher or close compared to the IPCE values reported for WO3/Mo-doped BiVO4 (17% at 0.6 V),17 BiVO4/WO3 (33% at 0.7 V),18 nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 (28% at 0.5 V)19 and IrO2/TaON (45% at 0.38 V)38 electrodes. In light of the recent report by Mi et al., it is essential to substantiate, that water oxidation is the governing process happening at the photonode.39 However, Saito et al.; observed stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution (H2/O2 = 2) by gas chromatography for a BiVO4 based multijunction electrode in NaHCO3 electrolyte.31 In addition, Gamelin et al., have reported oxygen evolution at about 100% Faradaic efficiency in a BiVO4 system.25 This is likely due to the lower band gap and more negative flat band potentials of BiVO4 and CuWO4 compared to WO3, both of which contribute to hole injection at a less positive potential which is incapable of oxidizing anion components of the electrolyte. However, we are in the progression of implementing oxygen detection by gas chromatography which will be included in future studies.
To investigate the durability of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes over time, the electrodes were kept under AM 1.5 (∼1 sun) illumination at 0.4 V bias vs. Pt counter electrode in 1.0 M NaHCO3 over 24 h. The current vs. time (Chronoamperometry) data obtained under short-circuit condition is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The electrode attained a stable photocurrent within 15 minutes and remained stable over 24 h. The current study shows that BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes are fairly stable under photolysis conditions in NaHCO3 electrolyte. Similarly, enhanced stability for the BiVO4 electrode was observed in the presence of NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to a constant decay in Na2SO4 and NaH2PO4 electrolytes.30 The improved stability was attributed to the catalytic ability of HCO3− ions through improved hole transfer from the surface of BiVO4. Jia et al., have also observed improved stability for BiVO4 in the presence of CoO catalyst. The photocurrent for this electrode was decreased by 37% over 7.5 h in K2SO4 electrolyte.26 Contrasting to this, the unmodified BiVO4 exhibited 52% decline in photocurrent with in 5 h. The improved photocurrent and stability in the presence of bicarbonate electrolyte suggests favourable consumption of photogenerated holes in the BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode by the desired water splitting reaction.
In summary, we prepared a three dimensional network structured CuWO4 films on FTO by an electrodeposition method in the presence of a structure directing agent. A highly porous BiVO4 electrode was integrated on top of a network connected CuWO4 electrode by a surfactant assisted metal–organic decomposition method. The PEC characteristics of as-synthesized CuWO4 films were improved by fabricating a BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO heterojunction electrode. We also investigated the effect of electrolyte composition on the PEC performance of BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes. The heterojunction BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrode exhibited ∼230 mV shift in the onset potential for water oxidation in 1.0 M NaHCO3 electrolyte compared to 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. We observed good stability for BiVO4/CuWO4/FTO electrodes. The wide band gaps of the materials in this heterojunction configuration, together with the transparent substrate, allow the possibility of unbiased photoelectrolysis by stacking this material on top of a narrower band gap photocathode (e.g. Si) to drive the water reduction reaction. The integration of porous BiVO4 with network connected CuWO4 dramatically improved the PEC performance of CuWO4 and this configuration is a promising heterojunction for solar-driven water oxidation.
