    , Accepted 25th February 2022First published on 26th February 2022AbstractThe rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has placed increasing demands on polymer donors and there is still room for optimization of the currently available top-performing polymer donors to work perfectly with the state-of-the-art NFAs. To further develop and fine-tune the best-performing polymer donors, random ternary copolymerization is a simple and powerful strategy, in which the search for a suitable and easily accessible third component is the challenge. Herein, a series of terpolymer donors OPz11, OPz12, OPz13 and OPz14 are synthesized by incorporating varying fractions of the ester-substituted thiazole (E-Tz) unit into the D18 polymer. Notably, the subtle E-Tz content brings optimization in the energy levels, electrostatic potentials (ESPs), molecular aggregation, miscibility and morphology, as revealed by the open circuit voltage (VOC) improvement from 856.1 to 865.3 mV, and fill-factor (FF) enhancement from 74.34% to 78.71%. Finally, an exciting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.42% is obtained from OPz11:Y6 devices, and is among the highest values reported for PSCs. This work illustrates that the accessible E-Tz unit is a promising building block to construct terpolymer donors for high-performance organic photovoltaic cells, and random ternary copolymerization is a flexible and promising strategy for photovoltaic materials development.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting tremendous attention from academics and industries, due to the distinct merits of polymers, such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, and solution processibility.1–5 The unique advantages of scalability as well as the low energy payback time make them a potential player in future energy marketplace.1,4 In the past few decades, a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been obtained from 7% to 19% owing to the continuous development of organic photoactive materials and device engineering processes.6–13 Particularly, great success has been achieved in the advancement of high-performance non-fullerene acceptors, e.g. ITIC, Y6, and their derivatives.14–17 Meanwhile, most of the PSC devices that achieve 18% PCEs are based on tandem or ternary active layer strategies (Table S1†). The binary devices with 18% PCEs have increasing demands for post-treatment processes. Very limited polymer donors have the potential to afford over 18% PCE particularly in single and binary active layer devices. For example, the binary devices based on PM6:L8-BO achieved 18.32% PCE when first reported, and the PCE was further improved to 18.6% after post-treatment optimization with a new additive diiodomethane (DIM).7 Compared to the non-fullerene fused ring acceptors, high performance polymer donors are limited and urgently needed. Recently, a few new polymer donors such as PBDTT1Cl,10 PNTB6-Cl,9 and PMZ-1012 achieved PCEs of 17.10%, 17.59% and 18.23%, respectively, implying that polymer donor innovation is promising and requires more efforts. Another emerging polymer donor developed by the Ding group, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole], namely D18, employs a new acceptor unit dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) in the polymer conjugated backbone and achieves remarkable PCEs.6 The prominent features of D18:Y6-based devices lie in the complementary light absorption, low charge recombination, and balanced hole/electron mobilities, which enable an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.859 V, a high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.7 mA cm−2, and a fill-factor (FF) of 76.61%. Recent studies have demonstrated that one common feature of PSCs with the PCE exceeding 18% is the high FF approaching or exceeding 80%, as a result of the more suitable phase separation.7,13,18,19 In this light, the photovoltaic performance based on D18 could be further improved with the fine-tuning of phase morphology and energy levels.
To further improve the existing high performance polymer donors, common strategies include (i) introducing functional groups (e.g. F, Cl and ester group) on the backbone to regulate the energy levels and crystallinity; (ii) optimizing the side-chain towards solubility improvement and morphology optimization.20–23 Other than the aforementioned two strategies, a simpler yet effective polymer modification approach is mixing a third component in the conjugated main chain to fine-tune the morphology and energy level.24–27 In recent years, a few random terpolymers adopting this strategy have been reported; however, the complex monomer structures and long synthetic steps are not easy to complete, such as the third unit 2-(1,1′-dicyanomethylene)-4-(3-thie-nylmethylene)rhodanine (TR) of PNDI-2T-TR(5),27 the fluoro-substituted and ester group-substituted thiophene (F-ET),28 and the thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) in polymer donor PM6.29 Besides, the performance of the random terpolymers relies heavily on the selection of the content of the incorporated third unit and the compatibility with the backbone, which cause the development of random terpolymers to lag behind. Development of a rational molecular design strategy for high-performance terpolymers still faces a great challenge.
In this study we used the skeleton of D18 and employed an easily accessible third component E-Tz, and successfully constructed a series of new terpolymers, namely OPz11, OPz12, OPz13, and OPz14, with 5%, 10%, 20%, and 50% E-Tz content, respectively. Due to the electronegativity of the E-Tz unit, all the terpolymers show deeper HOMOs and better pairing with Y6 to afford higher VOC. Further, the miscibility of OPz11:Y6 is more finely regulated than that of D18/Y6 as a result of the incorporation of 5% E-Tz unit, thus achieving a more smooth morphology with decreased Rq values, and more balanced exciton dissociation and charge collection. In addition, theoretical studies demonstrate that OPz11 and D18 have distinct electrostatic potentials (ESPs). The stronger intermolecular electric field (IEF) of OPz11:Y6 can promote exciton dissociation. As a result, the OPz11:Y6-based PSC achieves an excellent PCE of 18.42%, with a VOC of 865.3 mV, a JSC of 27.02 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 78.71%, standing among the best-performing PSCs. OPz11 is a new polymer donor and achieves a high PCE of 18.42% in single and binary active layer device structures, and we believe that the PCEs of OPz11 based PSCs will further improve with the development of engineering processes in future.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
A series of terpolymers are synthesized by adding different E-Tz unit contents (5% for OPz11, 10% for OPz12, 20% for OPz13, and 50% for OPz14, respectively) to the reaction mixture with typical Stille coupling reactions. The monomer and terpolymer structures are shown in Fig. 1a and the acceptor Y6 structure is shown in Fig. 1b. All terpolymers are obtained from the reaction at 110 °C for 4 h under nitrogen and using toluene as the solvent. Then, the crude polymers are purified by Soxhlet extraction and successively extracted with methanol, acetone, n-hexane, dichloromethane/chloroform (1:1), and chloroform to remove oligomers and other impurities, and finally extracted with chlorobenzene to collect the product polymers. The terpolymers are settled in methanol and dried in a vacuum oven for 4 h before use and the final yields are all over 60%. The monomers and final products are characterized by 1H NMR and elemental analysis (see Fig. S1 and Table S2, ESI†). Moreover, the molecular weights of the terpolymers are determined by high temperature (150 °C) gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in trichlorobenzene (TCB). The results show that the polymers possess similar number-average molecular mass (Mn) and dispersity (Đ) (D18, 68.61 kg mol−1, Đ 2.06; OPz11, 62.35 kg mol−1, Đ 2.14; OPz12, 63.55 kg mol−1, Đ 2.28; OPz13, 60.56 kg mol−1, Đ 1.95; OPz14, 33.02 kg mol−1, Đ 1.85; see Tables 1 and S3†). Thermogravimetric analysis shows that these terpolymers exhibit good thermal decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) exceeding 400 °C, which are high enough for electronic device application (see Fig. S2†).

2.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of D18, OPz11, OPz12 and Y6 pure films. As depicted in Fig. 1c and S3,† all polymers possess similar absorption ranging from 350 to 630 nm, and display absorption edges of 638 nm, 626 nm, 624 nm, 620 nm and 615 nm for D18, OPz11, OPz12, OPz13, and OPz14, respectively. The difference is reflected in the 0–1 (λ0–1, ∼541 nm) peak (Tables 1 and S3†). In Fig. S4,† as the content of the Tz unit increases in the copolymer, the twist angle between the donor and acceptor decreases perhaps due to the existence of the intramolecular interaction between the ester group of the Tz unit and the adjacent sulfur atom of thiophene. This interaction has been proven to be beneficial for a better planarity and conjugation of the backbones.28,30–32 In this work, this interaction could also be evidenced by DFT studies. The dihedral angle of the ester group and the adjacent sulfur atom of thiophene is lower than that of the D18 conjugated backbone, showing a more regular plane (Fig. S4†).
The energy levels of each terpolymer are measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S5,† the energy levels of E-Tz-based terpolymers are deeper than that of D18 and decrease as the E-Tz unit increases due to the strong electronegativity of E-Tz (supported by Fig. S6†), and the HOMO/LUMO are measured to be −5.58/−3.68 eV for OPz11, −5.61/−3.70 eV for OPz12, −5.63/−3.71 eV for OPz13, −5.65/−3.73 for OPz14 and −5.52/−3.66 eV for D18. Therefore, the calculated band gaps are 1.90 eV for OPz11, 1.91 eV for OPz12, 1.92 eV for OPz13, 1.92 eV for OPz14 and 1.86 eV for D18, respectively, which are in accordance with the optical band gap (Eg) data. The detailed data including optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Tables 1 and S2.† From the energy level diagram (Fig. 1d), the deeper HOMO energy levels match well with those of Y6 and are promising to achieve higher VOC.
Next, in order to study the effect of the E-Tz unit on the temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) property of the polymers, the temperature dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymer solutions (D18, OPz11 and OPz12) in chlorobenzene are measured from 25 to 100 °C. Previous reports frequently show that most of the high-performance donor polymers exhibited the TDA property,21,28,29 which is important for achieving an optimal blend morphology. As shown in Fig. 1e–g, the absorption of the D18, OPz11 and OPz12 solutions peaked at 520, 510, and 500 nm at 100 °C, respectively. When the solutions are cooled down to room temperature, the peaks red-shift to ∼550, ∼550, and ∼545 nm, respectively. It is important to note that all the additional 0–1 transition peaks gradually increase at ∼580 nm and become even higher than the peak at ∼500–520 nm, which indicates the strong aggregation and π–π stacking of the polymer chains. Furthermore, the TDA properties of the polymers exhibit slight difference upon increasing the E-Tz content in the polymer backbone, particularly in the peak shape. For instance, the absorption spectra of OPz11 (5% E-Tz) and OPz12 (20% E-Tz) show a significant 0–0 transition peak which is similar to that of D18. As a result, the different TDA properties may be able to regulate the morphology of the polymer blend during the temperature related processes.
2.3 DFT calculation
The electronic cloud distribution and backbone conformation of the terpolymers are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. To simplify the DFT calculation, all alkyl chains are replaced by methyl groups for calculations.33,34 As shown in Fig. S6,† the E-Tz unit displays deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels than the DTBT unit (−6.50 vs. −5.0 eV), implying that the E-Tz unit possesses a stronger electron-withdrawing effect than the DTBT unit. As a result, OPz11 exhibits deeper HOMO levels with the E-Tz unit introduction (−4.984 vs. −4.918 eV) (Fig. S7†). To simplify the calculation and comparison of the properties of polymers D18 and OPz11, we just compared the different conjugated backbone fragments with or without the E-Tz unit. Moreover, to obtain a better study of the impact of ESP on the intermolecular interactions and excited states, the molecular geometries are planarized to avoid unexpected atomic interactions, and this approximation allows the field direction to be perpendicular to the plane (see Fig. 2). In the fragment of the conjugated backbone of D18 and OPz11, the averaged ESP values of the atoms in the conjugated backbones and the surface area distributions with different ESP are shown in Fig. 2a, respectively. D18 shows negative ESP values on most part of its conjugated backbone, particularly for the DTBT units, and a minimal ESP value of −574 meV is calculated. For OPz11, the chemical groups with a strongly electronegative ester group, nitrogen and fluorine atoms have a negative ESP and a minimal ESP value of −1037 meV is calculated (see Fig. 2b). The E-Tz unit of OPz11 shows lower potential (∼890–1037 meV) than the DTBT unit of D18 (∼570 meV), and the results make the electrostatic attraction between OPz11:Y6 stronger than that between D18:Y6. The corresponding ESP area distributions are shown in Fig. 2c. The larger electrostatic attraction can contribute to stronger intermolecular electric fields (IEF) between the donor/acceptor interface, and is favorable for exciton dissociation.35–37

2.4 Photovoltaic properties
Devices with the architecture of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (AL)/PDIN/Ag are fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance with the terpolymers in the active layer (Fig. 3a). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 3b and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. As demonstrated, the D18:Y6 based device exhibits a VOC of 856.1 mV, a JSC of 27.12 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.34%, resulting in a PCE of 17.26%. Surprisingly, the OPz11:Y6-based device yields an elevated VOC of 865.3 mV, a JSC of 27.02 mA cm−2, and an excellent FF of 78.71%, leading to an outstanding PCE of 18.42%. The optimal device preparation processes are listed in Table S4,† and the performance of OPz11 containing 5% E-TZ unit is the best. It is worth noting that the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance for the OPz11 based device is owing to the elevation of the VOC and FF. Particularly, due to their relatively low HOMO energy levels,17,24,26 the VOC is gradually enhanced with the increase of E-Tz content in the terpolymers. When the contents of E-Tz are 5%, 10%, 20% and 50%, the VOC values are 865.3 mV, 871.4 mV, 888.2 mV and 905.9 mV, respectively, which is in good accordance with the change trend of the HOMO energy levels. The corresponding device performances of OPz13 and OPz14 can be found in Fig. S8a and Table S5.† The results imply that the introduction of E-Tz as the third component for random polymerization is a promising strategy to adjust energy levels and achieve higher photovoltaic performances.

To confirm the JSC values from the J–V curves, we carried out external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. As provided in Fig. 3c, the EQE spectra of the three devices display similar shapes from 300 to 950 nm, except that the D18 based device exhibits a slightly stronger photoresponse than the OPz11 and OPz12 based devices. Basically, the integrated JSC values of D18, OPz11, and OPz12-based devices from the EQE curves are 26.40, 26.25, and 26.08 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the JSC values measured from the simulator (within 3% error, Table 2). The EQE results of OPz13 and OPz14 can be found in Fig. S8b.† Additionally, we compared efficient polymer donors matching with Y6 reported in recent years,6,13,25,26,28–30,38–49 as shown in Fig. 3d. We have summarized recent high performing organic solar cells with the PCE exceeding or approaching 18% in Table S1.† In addition to VOC, another significantly improved parameter is the FF, which is also an important contributor to the improved device performance. The many previously reported literature studies mentioned that FF is largely correlated with the competition between the charge recombination and extraction.50 Therefore, it is meaningful to explore this key parameter via measuring the transportation, extraction, collection, and recombination behavior of photo-generated charges.
To understand the exciton dissociation and collection processes, we investigated the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) based on the equation Veff = V0 − Vcor − fRs, where V0 represents the voltage when Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage,51 and equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark.15 Under a wide voltage range from −1.5 to 1.5 V, while the Jph reaches saturation, the current at that voltage is defined as the saturation current (Jsat). The exciton collection efficiency (ηcoll) and exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) are obtained according to the formula ηdiss = Jph/Jsat and ηcoll = Jmax/Jsat, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 3e, the OPz11-based device exhibits an ηdiss of 98.1%, which is similar to the ηdiss of the D18-based device (98.4%). Nevertheless, the ηcoll of the OPz11-based device is 89.6%, which is higher than that of the D18-based device with the value of 87.5%. The high exciton dissociation and charge collection rates result in a high FF of 78.71% in the OPz11-based devices. In addition, the ηdiss and ηcoll of OPz12, OPz13, and OPz14-based devices decrease, indicating that the appropriate introduction of the E-Tz unit is necessary to facilitate exciton dissociation as well as charge collection (Fig. S8c†).
The dynamics of the free charges in the devices are quantified through J–V curves under various incident light intensities and the transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC). As reported, the charge recombination behavior can be evaluated by employing the dependences of VOC and JSC on light intensity (Plight).52,53 The bimolecular recombination can be estimated using the power law equation: J ∝ Iα, where α is the power factor (the imbalanced mobilities can also lead to α < 1).54 From fitting the data of JSCversus Plight as illustrated in Fig. 3f, we obtain α values of 0.996, 0.996, and 0.991 for D18, OPz11 and OPz12 based devices, respectively, indicating that the three devices display negligible bimolecular recombination losses. In addition to bimolecular recombination losses, Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is another key factor to explore. In this case, VOC is plotted as a function of the incident light intensity (Fig. 3g). The data are fitted according to the expression VOC ∝ nkT/qln(I), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge, respectively. Generally, a slope value of 2kBT/q implies that the device is dominated by trap-assisted recombination in the bulk, while a slope value equal to 1kBT/q suggests that bimolecular recombination dominates, and a slope smaller than 1kT/q indicates possible surface trap-assisted recombination.28,54–56 As depicted in Fig. 3g, n values of 1.14, 1.09, and 1.23 for D18, OPz11 and and OPz12 based devices are obtained, indicating that the OPz11-based device presents the lowest trap-assisted recombination. Overall, these findings imply that the introduction of 5% E-Tz into D18 can reduce trap-assisted recombination, in line with the significantly enhanced device photovoltaic performance.
Insights into the charge extraction and recombination patterns of the D18, OPz11, and OPz12 based devices are analyzed by TPV and TPC measurements. The carrier lifetime (τ) under open-circuit conditions is extracted from the TPV decay dynamics employing the mono-exponential fits in the dark. The fitting of the TPV signals is by using the equation: y = A × exp(−x/t).57 As shown in Fig. 3h, the τ values of D18, OPz11 and OPz12 based devices are obtained to be 60.73 μs, 66.48 μs and 49.64 μs, respectively. The τ of the OPz11 based device is longer than that of D18 and OPz12-based devices. In general, the longer carrier lifetime is also conducive to the increase of exciton diffusion distance, indicating that lower defects exist in the terpolymer OPz11-based device, compared with the device of D18. In Fig. 3i, TPC is employed to explore the competition between the recombination process and carrier sweep-out. The charge extraction time of the OPz11 based device is 0.48 μs, which is faster than those of D18 and OPz12 based devices with the values of 0.52 μs and 0.64 μs, implying that the charge extraction in the OPz11 based device is most efficient compared to others. These results illustrate that the reasonable copolymerization strategy with the E-Tz unit can effectively promote the charge extraction and restrain recombination, which is consistent with the data of device performances.
The hole and electron mobilities of these terpolymers are tested with space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements.58 The electron only and hole only devices with architectures ITO/ZnO/PDIN/active layer/PDIN/Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag are fabricated. The electron and hole mobility values of all terpolymer donors are presented in Fig. S9 and Table S6.† The hole mobilities (μh) are estimated to be 2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 8.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for D18, OPz11, and OPz12 based devices. And their corresponding electron mobilities (μe) are 9.36 × 10−4, 8.18 × 10−4, and 2.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The OPz11 based device affords more balanced electron and hole mobilities (μh/μe 2.05) than D18 and OPz12 based devices (μh/μe 2.16 and 3.06), contributing to a higher FF of 78.71%.
2.5 Film morphology and miscibility
The surface morphology and phase separation of the active layer are studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM). As demonstrated in height images (Fig. 4a and S10†), the root mean square roughness (Rq) values decline gradually as the E-Tz content increases. In particular, the OPz11 based film shows an Rq value of 3.0 nm, which is smaller than that of the D18 based film (Rq 3.54 nm), and larger than that of the OPz12 based film (Rq 2.7 nm), implying that the OPz11-based and OPz12-based blend film became more smooth with the E-Tz unit introduction. Generally, a smooth film results in low trap recombination with a better interfacial contact, which is beneficial for higher FF.59 From the AFM images, the donor and acceptor materials are separated to nano-sized domains with visible fibrous structures which could be favorable for charge transport. In addition, we estimated the miscibility of the donor/acceptor using the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter xdonor–acceptor obtained from K(γ1/2donor − γ1/2acceptor), where K is a positive constant and γ is the surface energy values of the donor/acceptor, respectively.60–62 The contact angles of the films were obtained on a DSA-100 (KRUSS Germany) contact angle meter. Then the surface free energy was calculated using the Owens–Wendt method: γL × (1 + cosθ) = 2 × (γdLγdsv)1/2 + 2 × (γpLγpsv)1/2, where γL and γsv are the surface free energies of the probe liquid and sample, respectively, and θ is the contact angle of the sample (data shown in Tables S7–S9†). The surface energy of each material is calculated from the contact angle (Fig. 4b) measurements. The xdonor–acceptor values for D18/Y6, OPz11/Y6, OPz12/Y6, OPz13/Y6 and OPz14/Y6 are 0.40, 0.29, 0.22, 0.19 and 0.11 K, respectively. The lower Δδ values indicate that the miscibility improves as the E-Tz content increases, which is in line with the change trend of Rq values. The surface morphology and contact angle data are shown in Fig. S9, Tables S7 and S8.† In short, the random ternary copolymerization strategy with the E-Tz unit can reduce aggregation and finely tune phase separations.

2.6 Molecular packing
To explore the molecular packing and orientation of the components in the photoactive layer, the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) method is adopted, and the corresponding GIWAXS parameters are summarized in Table S9.† As shown in 2D GIWAXS patterns (Fig. 5a and Table S9†), all donors demonstrate a preferential face-on orientation and the intensity of (010) π–π diffraction becomes slightly weaker as the E-Tz content increases, resulting in lower crystallinity. With regard to the blend films, the OPz11:Y6 displays (010) π–π stacking at qz = 1.710 Å−1 (coherence length (CCL), 3.17 nm). In comparison, the D18:Y6 exhibits (010) π–π stacking at qz = 1.713 Å−1 (CCL 3.26 nm) and the OPz12:Y6 presents (010) π–π stacking at qz = 1.708 Å−1 (CCL 3.13 nm) (Fig. 5b and Table S10†). The decrease of CCL demonstrated that the introduction of the E-Tz unit can tune the crystallinity of D18 to improve the miscibility with Y6. The differences in the orientation distribution of crystallites in these three blend films are quantified by integrating the intensity of the (010) diffraction signals at various azimuthal angles (Fig. 5c). As depicted, the orientations of OPz11:Y6 and D18:Y6 are more inclined to be face-on from an azimuthal angle around 75° to nearly 90°, which is beneficial for charge transportation and collection.63–65 Furthermore, similar to pristine polymer films, the d-spacings for π–π stacking increase substantially from 3.666 Å for D18:Y6 to 3.673 Å for OPz11:Y6 and 3.677 Å for OPz12:Y6. The CCLs based on the OOP (010) peak decrease from 32.57 Å for D18:Y6 to 31.71 Å for OPz11:Y6 and 31.29 Å for the OPz12:Y6 device, indicating more favorable miscibility for OPz11 and OPz12 blends. The corresponding scattering profiles for the blend films are shown in Fig. 5c. The suitable crystalline morphology of the OPz11:Y6 film, resulting from its more reasonable miscibility, is beneficial for the reduced charge recombination to improve FF, and this trend is in agreement with AFM and contact angle results.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of terpolymer donors, namely, OPz11, OPz12, OPz13 and OPz14, are synthesized via introducing varying contents of the electron deficient monomer E-Tz unit into the D18 backbone. We find that the incorporation of the E-Tz unit can (i) finely regulate the molecular aggregation and phase separation, which promote the exciton dissociation and charge transport; (ii) finely-tune the energy levels for higher VOC; (iii) optimize the ESP for achieving a stronger intermolecular electric field (IEF), which is beneficial to promote the exciton dissociation. As a result, 5% E-Tz unit enables an outstanding PCE of 18.42% with a high VOC of 865.3 mV and an excellent FF of 78.71%, which stands among the best-performing PSCs. This work illustrates that the accessible E-Tz unit is a promising building block to construct terpolymer donors for high-performance organic photovoltaic cells, and random ternary copolymerization is a flexible and promising strategy for photovoltaic materials development.
