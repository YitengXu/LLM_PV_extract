    , Accepted 3rd December 2018First published on 5th December 2018AbstractIn this work we report three novel polythiophene derivatives (P4T2F-HD, P4T2F-HD/BO, and P4T2F-BO) which are synthesized via a three-step reaction in each case. The polymers show excellent coplanarity and desired aggregation characteristics in solution. The HOMO energy levels of the new polymers were down-shifted by 0.4 eV as compared to the commercial polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The polymers are able to offer high device performance when combined with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. When blended with a non-fullerene acceptor (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-(((4,4,9,9-tetraoctyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-7,4-diyl))bis-(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (O-IDTBR), P4T2F-HD offers the highest PCE of 7.0% with a high Voc of 1.04 V. Moreover, P4T2F-HD can tolerate the variation of active layer thickness over a large range when blended with a fullerene acceptor. The decent device performance and processability under mild conditions demonstrate that polythiophene derivatives hold great potential for application in large-scale production of polymer solar cell modules.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive research interest due to their unique merits such as flexibility, light weight, low-cost, compatibility with roll-to-roll manufacturing, etc.1,2 Benefiting from the new molecular design, active layer morphology control, interface engineering, and device architecture innovation, the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been improved rapidly.3–5 At the same time, reducing the synthetic complexity of photoactive materials is urgent for realizing large-scale industrial application of this photovoltaic technology.6–8 The active layer which consists of a p-type conjugate polymer as the donor and a n-type organic semiconductor as the acceptor plays a vital role in determining the device performance of PSCs.9 In the past two decades, researchers have devoted considerable efforts to developing new donor materials to match the state-of-the-art fullerene-based acceptors 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) and 6,6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM).10 Particularly, medium (1.6 < Eoptg < 1.8 eV) and low bandgap (Eoptg < 1.6 eV) donor polymers have received intensive attention due to their ability to provide high short-circuit current (Jsc).11,12 More encouragingly, highly efficient low bandgap non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have been successfully developed and widely investigated in the recent few years.13–15 In most cases, wide bandgap (WBG) (Eoptg > 1.8 eV) donor polymers can match better with the low bandgap non-fullerene acceptors.16–19 Simultaneously, multi-junction and ternary devices are effective to further boost the efficiency of PSCs, in which the WBG donor polymers are needed to complement the light absorption in the short wavelength range.20,21 Thus, it is urgent to develop new high performance WBG conjugated polymers. Generally, the main considerations to construct WBG polymers include appropriate molecular orbital energy levels, high charge carrier mobility, and enough solubility to ensure solution-processability at room temperature.22,23
So far, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most representative WBG donor materials, which has a few prominent advantages including high hole mobility, ease of formation of a suitable nanoscale interpenetrating network structure with fullerene derivatives, and insensitivity to active layer thickness.24 Besides, its simple chemical structure and straightforward synthetic pathway make it one of the most suitable candidates for large-scale manufacturing of PSCs.25 However, the development of polythiophene (PT) derivatives in the field of PSCs has been on the verge in the past few years due to the emergence of high efficiency conjugated polymers based on the alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) design.26 Considering the continuous progress of device optimizing methods and non-fullerene acceptors, it is necessary to further explore new PT derivatives. At present, the PCEs of PSCs based on P3HT and traditional fullerene acceptors of [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM are around 5%.27–29 When blended with non-fullerene acceptors higher efficiency can be achieved by P3HT. For example, a binary solar cell composed of P3HT and a non-fullerene acceptor (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-(((4,4,9,9-tetraoctyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-7,4-diyl))bis-(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (O-IDTBR) produced a PCE of 6.4%.30 By introducing another non-fullerene acceptor (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-{(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-7,4-diyl(Z)methylylidene]}bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one) (FBR) to form a ternary solar cell, P3HT afforded a more remarkable efficiency of 7.7%.31 In Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI,† we have summarized the photovoltaic performance parameters of PT-based photovoltaic devices that show PCE ≥ 6.0%. Encouragingly, a PT derivative poly[(4,4′-bis(2-butyloctoxycarbonyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5-diyl)-alt-(2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl))] (PDCBT) afforded a PCE up to 10.2% when blended with a non-fullerene acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (ITIC).32 These results show that PT derivatives have the potential to be highly efficient in PSCs and inspired us to develop new PT derivatives. One of the main drawbacks of P3HT is the very high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, which results in a low open-circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cells. Downshifting the HOMO energy level thus needs to be considered when designing new PT-based photovoltaic materials. In addition, the photovoltaic performance of conjugated polymers is influenced by their aggregation properties in solution and microstructure in solid state. Fluorination of the polymer backbone is a well-known strategy to down-shift the energy levels of conjugated polymers. Moreover, fluorination can induce strong aggregation in solutions and improve interchain packing in the solid state of conjugated polymers.33,34
In this contribution, we designed three fluorinated PT derivatives, P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD (Scheme 1), which possess very simple chemical structures and can be synthesized through a three-step reaction in each case. Two fluorine atoms are introduced onto each repeat unit of the polymers to down-shift the HOMO levels and to tune aggregation properties. Different alkyl side chains were used to tune the solubility and processability of the polymers (P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-HD).35,36 Moreover, a ternary copolymer P4T2F-BO/HD was prepared via random copolymerization to fine-tune the polymer solubility.37 Compared to P3HT, the HOMO energy levels of the newly synthesized PT derivatives are reduced by 0.4 eV without changing the optical bandgap (Eoptg). Moreover, P4T2F-HD is processable at room temperature. The new PT derivatives all produced PCE over 5% when blended with [70]PCBM and PCE over 6% when blended with O-IDTBR. Among the three polymers, P4T2F-HD exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with PCE = 6.3% and PCE = 7.0% when blended with [70]PCBM and O-IDTBR, respectively. In addition, the P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM blend shows a desirable independence from the thickness variation of the active layer. In the thickness range from 200 to 320 nm, the average PCEs are almost unchanged. These results suggest that PT derivatives hold great potential for application in large-scale production of polymer solar cell modules and P4T2F-HD is a promising alternative to P3HT.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD are shown in Scheme 2. Starting from the inexpensive 3-alkylthiophene compounds, the resulting PT derivatives were synthesized via only three step reactions. Firstly, 2-bromo-3-alkylthiophene (1a and 1b) compounds were prepared in 90% and 92% yield through the bromination of 3-alkylthiophene with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Then, compounds 1a and 1b were subjected to a palladium-catalyzed homocoupling reaction to afford dibrominated monomers 2a and 2b with 85% and 88% yield, respectively.38 The polymers were obtained through Stille condensation polymerization under the same reaction conditions. Detailed synthetic procedures for monomers and polymers are described in the ESI.† Elemental analysis was used to confirm the chemical structures of the polymers (ESI†). The results are consistent with the element composition of the polymers including the random copolymer P4T2F-BO/HD. Number-average molecular weights (n) and molar-mass dispersity (ĐM = w/n) of the polymers were characterized by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The three polymers possess a similar n of ∼45 kDa and a ĐM of ∼1.5. The relevant results are summarized in Table 1. The polymer P4T2F-BO is only soluble in hot chlorinated solvents, while P4T2F-HD is very soluble in common organic solvents even at room temperature due to its longer alkyl side chains. The random copolymer P4T2F-BO/HD which possesses mixed side chains of 2-butyloctyl and 2-hexyldecyl shows modest solubility in between P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-HD.

2.2. Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to investigate the thermal properties of the polymers. As shown in Fig. 1a, the three polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 416, 434, and 422 °C for P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD, respectively. Thus, all of the three polymers are sufficiently stable for PSC operations. The second heating and cooling DSC curves are depicted in Fig. 1b, and the detailed thermal transition parameters are summarized in Table 1. All three polymers display clear melting peaks during heating and crystallization peaks during cooling. With the increasing length of side chains, the melting temperatures (Tm) and crystallization temperatures (Tc) of the polymers reduced gradually. P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD exhibited endothermic melting transitions (Tm) at 259, 228, and 193 °C, and exothermic crystallization transitions (Tc) at 237, 210, and 179 °C, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between polymer chains is weakened due to the lengthened side chains. In addition, the enthalpy values of the three polymers are also decreased in the order of P4T2F-BO > P4T2F-BO/HD > P4T2F-HD. It implies that the longer side chains of 2-hexyldecyl could reduce polymer crystallinity in comparison with 2-butyloctyl, which may favor a more miscible donor:acceptor blend morphology.39,40

2.3. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers and P3HT in solutions and films are compared in Fig. 2a and b, and relevant data are summarized in Table 2. In solution, P3HT shows only an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption peak (A0–1) at 454 nm without any (A0–0) shoulder peak, while P4T2F-HD shows an ICT peak at 474 nm and a very weak (A0–0) shoulder peak at 604 nm. The ICT peaks of P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-BO/HD dramatically red-shifted to 563 and 560 nm with a strong shoulder peak at 612 and 606 nm, respectively. These results suggest that the polymer chains of P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-BO/HD show strong aggregation in dilute chlorobenzene solutions at room temperature. To investigate the stability of aggregates in solution, temperature-dependent absorption spectra of the polymers were recorded. As shown in Fig. S9a–c (ESI†), P4T2F-BO aggregates are very stable and do not dissociate until heated to ∼80 °C, while P4T2F-BO/HD aggregates are less stable and completely dissociate at ∼55 °C. Moreover, P4T2F-HD aggregates are the most unstable and could disaggregate completely at ∼30 °C. These results agree well with the DSC results and suggest that the interchain interactions can be tuned by alkyl side chains. From solution to film, the ICT peaks of P3HT and P4T2F-HD red-shifted significantly to 516 nm and 551 nm, respectively, due to an effective planarization of the polymer backbone. For P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-BO/HD, the ICT peaks show no obvious change. The (A0–0) shoulder peaks of the polymer films blue shifted slightly as compared to those of the polymer solutions. The possible reason is that the polymer films were spin-coated from hot solutions at high rotary speed. Under this circumstance the interchain stacking of polymers cannot reach the level of polymer aggregation in solution at room temperature due to the polymer chains quickly condensing as a consequence of the fast removal of solvent.35,41 The absorption spectra of the polymers with absorption coefficients in chlorobenzene solutions (10−5 mol L−1) and as thin films are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), from which it is clear that all polymers exhibit similar absorption coefficients. The polymer solutions show molar extinction coefficients of ≈4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and the thin films show absorption coefficients of ≈1 × 105 cm−1. The optical bandgaps of P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD were calculated to be 1.90, 1.91, and 1.92 eV, respectively, based on the film absorption onsets (653, 648, 643 nm), which are almost identical to that of P3HT (1.93 eV). However, the ICT peaks of the polymers red-shifted at least 35 nm compared to that of P3HT.

The frontier molecular orbital energy levels were characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The CV curves are shown in Fig. S11a (ESI†), and the energy levels are depicted in Fig. 2c and Fig. S11b (ESI†). The HOMO levels of the polymers are estimated to be about −5.30 eV, which are down-shifted by 0.4 eV in comparison with P3HT. These down-shifted HOMO levels are beneficial for acquiring a better stability against oxidation under ambient conditions for polymers as well as obtaining a higher Voc in the resulting PSCs. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated to be about −3.40 eV for the P4T2F polymers and −3.00 eV for P3HT, respectively, which were derived from the HOMO levels and optical bandgaps as no reliable reduction curves were obtained in CV measurements.
2.4. Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the ground state geometries of one repeat unit of the polymers at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. We replaced the alkyl side chains with methyl groups to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the polymer backbone shows excellent coplanarity. The torsional angle at the minimum energy state is 11.7° for the two methyl-substituted adjacent thiophene rings and 0.4° for the two fluorine-substituted adjacent thiophene rings. The rigid potential energy surface scans at dihedral D1, D2, and D3 are presented in Fig. 3c. Three different colors of blue, green, and red correspond to the increase of relative energy. Rotational dihedral angles result in conformational diversity and not all of them have equal energy. The rotational barriers are comparable in magnitude and shape. It is clear that the high twist angles of dihedral D3 possess a larger red area, which is indicative of higher energy conformation. These results indicate that the fluorine atom enlarges the rotational barriers of the dihedral angle D3 due to the noncovalent intrachain F⋯S, F⋯H–C, and interchain C–F⋯πF interactions. Such weak conformational locks play a key role in promoting backbone planarity and interchain packing.42,43

2.5. Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were evaluated in PSCs by blending them with a fullerene acceptor [70]PCBM in a device of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:[70]PCBM/PFN-Br/Ag, where PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br), respectively. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the best devices are displayed in Fig. 4a, and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The device parameters of the solar cells under various conditions are presented in Tables S3–S9 (ESI†). The optimal donor:acceptor weight ratio is 1:1.5, and the optimal thickness is 200 nm for the three active layer blends. Four different types of solvent additive including 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenyl ether (DPE), and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) were utilized to optimize the device performance. The photovoltaic devices based on P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-BO/HD were cast from hot chlorobenzene (CB) with 3% CN as additive and thermally annealed at 100 °C, which offered the highest PCEs of 5.4% and 6.1%, respectively. The P4T2F-HD-based devices were cast from chloroform at room temperature with 2% DPE as additive and thermally annealed at 80 °C, which delivered the maximum PCE of 6.3%. In particular, the Voc of the photovoltaic devices of P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD is around 0.80 V, which is significantly higher than that of the P3HT:[70]PCBM device, benefitting from the down-shifted HOMO levels of the new PT derivatives.43 Due to the similar UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers, the three kinds of devices provided similar Jsc, which is around 10 mA cm−2. Notably, all devices showed a very high fill factor (FF). The P4T2F-BO-based device showed an FF of 0.68, while the P4T2F-BO/HD- and P4T2F-HD-based devices both exhibited the highest FF of 0.74. The high FF is generally attributable to the high charge carrier mobility and optimal morphology of the active layers, which will be discussed in more detail later. Compared to the reported devices of P3HT:[70]PCBM which offered the highest PCE of 4.1%, the enhanced PCEs of our new PT derivatives are mainly because of the higher Voc.44 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 4b. All devices exhibited efficient photon response with EQE around 60% in the range from 300 to 600 nm. As a result, the Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra of all devices are very similar, which are 10.4, 9.7, and 9.7 mA cm−2 for P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD, respectively. These results are consistent with the Jsc values acquired from J–V tests.

The insensitivity of the device performance to the variation of active layer thickness is of vital importance to roll-to-roll processing.45–47 We thus investigated the device performance of the P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM blend at various layer thickness due to its high FF and excellent processability at room temperature. By adjusting the solution concentrations and spin speed, photovoltaic devices with different active layer thickness ranging from 200 to 320 nm were fabricated. The J–V characteristics and thickness dependent solar cell performance of the devices are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S8 (ESI†). The Jsc increased slightly from 10.2 to 11.5 mA cm−2 when the active layer thickness increased from 200 to 320 nm, and the Voc and FF of the devices reduced slightly as a result of more charge recombination at larger layer thickness. Overall, the PCEs of the solar cells are almost constant over the active layer thickness of 200–320 nm, demonstrating the excellent tolerance of the P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM blend to thickness variation and good reproducibility of device performance. These virtues are very valuable to large scale manufacturing. In combination with the excellent processability under mild conditions, these results suggest that P4T2F-HD is a good candidate for use in large area PSC modules.

Compared to fullerene-based acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors can offer higher device performance due to their extended light absorption and tunable energy levels, as well as their ability to provide high quantum efficiency at very small energy loss.48–50 O-IDTBR, a small molecule non-fullerene acceptor reported by Holliday et al., has been widely used.30 We note that the optoelectronic properties of O-IDTBR are well-matched with our PT derivatives. Moreover, O-IDTBR allows for efficient organic solar cells at very low voltage loss.51 Therefore, we evaluated the photovoltaic performance of various PT:O-IDTBR blends. The current density J–V characteristics and related parameters of the optimized devices are presented in Fig. 4a and Table 3. For all the three O-IDTBR-based non-fullerene devices, the optimal weight ratio of donor:acceptor is 1:1, and the optimized active layer thickness is about 100 nm. All of the active layers were spin-coated from CB solution without using solvent additives. The films were further annealed at 75 °C for 5 min to improve the device performance. The solar cells of P4T2F-BO:O-IDTBR and P4T2F-BO/HD:O-IDTBR exhibited the highest PCEs of 6.3% and 6.5%, respectively, which are comparable to the P3HT:O-IDTBR device that afforded the maximum PCE of 6.4%.30 More encouragingly, the solar cell of the P4T2F-HD:O-IDTBR blend showed the maximum PCE of 7.0%, outperforming the P3HT:O-IDTBR device.30 The higher PCE of the P4T2F-HD:O-IDTBR device is mainly benefited from the remarkably increased Voc (1.04 versus 0.73 V) and enhanced FF (0.67 versus 0.62). Fig. 4b shows the EQE spectra of the optimized O-IDTBR-based non-fullerene solar cells. The devices exhibit an extended photon response range as compared to the fullerene-based devices. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the non-fullerene devices based on the PT derivatives exhibit a relatively small voltage loss of ≈0.60 V, which is defined as the difference between the optical bandgap of the donor/acceptor materials and the Voc value of the solar cell (Eoptg/q − Voc).
2.6. Charge generation, transport, and recombination
To investigate the charge generation in the PSCs of the new PT derivatives, we carried out the photoluminescence (PL) quenching tests. The PL spectra of neat and blend films are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). All of the three pure polymer films show strong PL in the range of 600–800 nm. When blended with [70]PCBM and O-IDTBR, the PL of the polymers is almost completely quenched, indicating that the electron transfer from the PT donors to the acceptors is highly efficient.
A space charge-limited current (SCLC) model was used to estimate the charge carrier mobility of the blend films. The J–V curves of the single-carrier devices are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), and the corresponding hole/electron mobility data are listed in Table 4. All of the [70]PCBM-based blend films exhibit balanced μh/μe ratios, which are beneficial to obtaining high FF values. Moreover, the hole mobility (μh) and the electron mobility (μe) of the PT:[70]PCBM blends show slight enhancement in the order of P4T2F-BO < P4T2F-BO/HD < P4T2F-HD, which is consistent with the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cells. The PT:O-IDTBR blends show lower hole/electron mobility and relatively high μh/μe ratios as compared to the PT:[70]PCBM blends, agreeing with the lower FF values of the O-IDTBR-based devices relative to the [70]PCBM-based devices. Similarly, the PT:O-IDTBR blends show an increasing trend in hole/electron mobility along with the addition of longer side chains, which explained the improvement of FFs and PCEs of the corresponding solar cells. It is worth mentioning that the electron mobility of the P4T2F-HD:O-IDTBR blend is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the P3HT:O-IDTBR blend, which probably accounts for the higher FF value of the former (0.67 versus 0.62).30

The charge recombination mechanisms of the solar cells were investigated by measuring the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the intensity of incident light (Plight). The results are presented in Fig. 6. The relationship between Jsc and Plight follows a power law formula of Jsc ∝ Pαlight, where α is an exponential factor.52 In general, the higher α value (α ≤ 1) represents less bimolecular recombination. On the other hand, Vocversus natural logarithm of Plight follows the relationship of Voc ∝ (nkBT/q)ln(Plight), where kB, T, and q denote the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively.53 Bimolecular recombination is dominant when the slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) is close to kBT/q, and trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination is dominant when the slope is close to 2kBT/q. The α values for all PT:[70]PCBM devices are equal to 1.00, suggesting that bimolecular recombination is negligible in these devices. The slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) was calculated to be 1.84, 1.79, and 1.68kBT/q for the P4T2F-BO:[70]PCBM, P4T2F-BO/HD:[70]PCBM, and P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM devices, respectively. These results suggest that trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination is the dominating recombination mechanism in the PT:[70]PCBM devices. And the extent of trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination is decreased in the order of P4T2F-BO:[70]PCBM > P4T2F-BO/HD:[70]PCBM > P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM. For the PT:O-IDTBR devices, the α values were calculated to be 0.92, 0.98, and 0.98 for P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD, respectively. The slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) was calculated to be 1.43, 1.32, and 1.28kBT/q for the device of P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular recombination is more pronounced in O-IDTBR-based devices. And the extent of bimolecular recombination is decreased in the order of P4T2F-BO:O-IDTBR > P4T2F-BO/HD:O-IDTBR > P4T2F-HD:O-IDTBR, which is consistent with the FF values and PCEs of the solar cells.

2.7. Morphology characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to study the morphology of the active layers. As shown in Fig. 7a–c, the bright and dark regions represent the polymer donor-rich and fullerene acceptor-rich domains, respectively. All fullerene-based blend films show fibrillar bicontinuous interpenetrating network structures. Such fibrillar structures are favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thus explained the high EQE and FF of the solar cells. The fiber width of the films follows the trend of P4T2F-BO < P4T2F-BO/HD < P4T2F-HD, which is consistent with the hole mobility of the blend films and FF of the corresponding solar cells. It has been established that higher polymer solubility in the processing solvent will result in the formation of wider fibers in blend films.54,55 The different fiber width observed in our systems can thus be explained by the difference in the solubility of the polymers due to the different length of their side chain. In contrast, the blend films of polymer:O-IDTBR do not show any fibrillar structure (Fig. 7d–f), indicating a good miscibility between the polymer and O-IDTBR, especially the blend films of P4T2F-BO:O-IDTBR and P4T2F-BO/HD:O-IDTBR. Such intimately mixed nanostructures are conducive to exciton dissociation, but they may limit charge extraction due to the lack of a continuous pathway for charge transport, which leads to lower charge mobility and FF. As a result, the polymer:O-IDTBR cells showed lower EQE and FF with respect to polymer:[70]PCBM cells.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to further investigate the surface morphology of the blend films. The AFM height images (size: 5 μm × 5 μm) are shown in Fig. 8. For the [70]PCBM-based blend films, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 6.42, 5.19, and 2.38 nm for P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD, respectively. Clearly, P4T2F-BO and P4T2F-BO/HD offered excessively large roughness. For these cases, reducing the RMS roughness indicates the formation of more mixed donor:acceptor blends, which will promote charge transport and suppress charge recombination and consequently improve the FF and PCEs of the solar cells. For the O-IDTBR-based blend films, the RMS roughness values are 1.21, 1.75, and 1.88 nm for P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD, respectively, which are much smaller than that of the [70]PCBM-based films, suggesting that the PT donors and the O-IDTBR acceptor are highly miscible in the blends. These results agree well with the TEM images for the corresponding blend films (Fig. 7d–f). Under this circumstance, increasing the RMS roughness and improving the phase separation are desired to enhance charge transport and to suppress charge recombination. Therefore, the AFM results explained the trend of the FF and PCEs for various PT:O-IDTBR solar cells. Moreover, we note that thermal annealing can slightly improve the device performance of all blends based on the PT derivatives regardless of fullerene or non-fullerene systems (Table S9 in the ESI†). However, correlating these differences in device performance to the change of active layer morphology is difficult at this stage. In the AFM images (Fig. 8, Fig. S14 and S15, ESI†) there is no consistent trend to understand the effect of thermal annealing on the morphology of various active layers. More morphological studies including those related to polymer orientation and domain purity are needed to understand the effect of thermal annealing, but those studies are beyond the focus of this work.

3. Conclusion
We synthesized three novel polythiophene derivatives P4T2F-BO, P4T2F-BO/HD, and P4T2F-HD through three simple reactions. Their HOMO energy levels are down-shifted by 0.4 eV relative to the state-of-the-art polythiophene P3HT. The new polythiophene derivatives are compatible with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors for making high efficiency solar cells. Particularly, P4T2F-HD showed the best photovoltaic performance among the polymers. It offers high hole mobility and FF values due to the formation of a well-defined fibrillar bicontinuous interpenetrating network structure in the active layer. The optimal P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM device afforded a PCE of 6.3% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 10.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.74 at an active layer thickness of 240 nm. Moreover, the P4T2F-HD:[70]PCBM cells show desired tolerance to thickness variation of the active layer. When blended with a non-fullerene acceptor O-IDTBR, P4T2F-HD gives a PCE of 7.0% with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 10.0 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.67. It is worth noting that P4T2F-HD has exceptional solubility in common organic solvents at room temperature, which is a desired virtue for large-scale manufacturing of PSC modules. Our results demonstrate that polythiophene derivatives still have much space for further improvement of photovoltaic properties.
