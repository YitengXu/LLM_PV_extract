Introduction
Due to the increased concern over the depletion of fossil fuel resources, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have attracted enormous attention due to their impressive energy-conversion efficiency and high energy density, easy refuelling, long life, and low pollution.1–3 Recently, extensive studies have shown that porous carbon materials such as activated carbons,4 carbon fibers,5 carbon nanotubes,6 and mesoporous carbons,7 play an important role in determining the performance of a DMFC due to their unique nanoscale pore network and high electrical conductivity. In particular, effective surface area and appropriate pore size in the carbon nanostructure can effectively facilitate transport of reactants7 and access of the electrolyte8 for better performance of the DMFC.
As a single layer of graphite, graphene has recently attracted a great deal of research interest in the field of energy conversion and storage. For example, graphene has been widely recognized as a promising support of fuel cell catalysts,9,10 and active material of supercapacitors11 and Li-ion batteries12 due to its unique structure and superior physicochemical properties, such as excellent electrical conductivity, high theoretical specific surface area, good mechanical strength, and extraordinary chemical stability. Unfortunately, during the preparation and drying process, graphene usually undergoes restacking between individual graphene sheets due to the strong interlayer van der Waals forces, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the surface area and pore volume. In addition, many graphene nanostructures obtained from wet-chemical reduction13–15 and the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth approach16,17 often lack mesopores and macropores, despite having a large surface area and excellent electrical conductivity. However, for electrocatalytic and/or electroactive materials, unique mesopore/macropore characteristics can accelerate the diffusion of reactive species, ions, and electrolytes to the electrode surface,8,18,19 leading to improved performance. From this point of view, among the various methods available for the preparation of graphene materials, the template approach is highly recommended because various mesopores/macropores can be effectively introduced and the pore structure can be tuned by simply adjusting the ratio of precursor/templating agent.
Herein, we report an effective route to obtain mesoporous graphenes (MGs) with a large mesopore surface area and excellent conductivity via a template-assisted pyrolysis approach. Phenolic polymer-ammonium oleate supramolecular aggregates formed by weak acid–base interaction induced self-assembly resulted in a solid carbon source. Layered graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) created by the polycondensation of dicyandiamide under high temperature and a nitrogen gas environment provided the sacrificial template. The produced MGs present a high mesopore surface area (265.9 m2 g−1) and large bimodal mesopores (4 and 10 nm). The conductivity of the MGs was measured to be 171.7 S cm−1. The passive DMFC utilizing MGs within the cathodic diffusion layer demonstrated an improved performance and discharge stability. The excellent performance of MGs as the material incorporated into the diffusion layer of DMFCs highlights its potential for use in energy-related fields.
Experimental methods
Materials
Dicyandiamide, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and oleic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol, formaldehyde (37 wt%), and ammonium hydroxide (28 wt% NH3) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Vulcan XC-72R powdered carbon black pigment was purchased from Cabot. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of mesoporous graphenes
MGs were synthesized based on a weak acid–base interaction-induced self-assembly20 and subsequent sacrificial-template-assisted pyrolysis approach.21 Typically, 2.5 mmol of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 7.5 mmol of formaldehyde were firstly dissolved in 95 mL of ultrapure water. Then, an aqueous solution (5 mL) containing 56 μL of oleic acid and 160 μL of ammonium hydroxide solution (28 wt%) was added to the above solution under slow stirring at 30 °C. The mixture solution was stirred for 30 min to yield a stable phenolic polymer emulsion. After 5.3 g of dicyandiamide was added and stirred for 3 h, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at 60 °C. Yellow powders were obtained after drying in an oven at 70 °C for 24 h and acted as the precursor for MGs. Finally, MGs were obtained by heating the precursor to 1000 °C and holding it at that temperature for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. In this procedure, the heating rate before and after 600 °C was 2 and 3.3 °C min−1, respectively.
Preparation of MEAs
Nafion 115 membrane was used as the electrolyte, and its pre-treatment procedures have been described in our previous work.22 The pre-treated membranes were kept in ultrapure water prior to the fabrication of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). Toray carbon paper (TGPH060, 20 wt% wet-proofed) was used as the anodic backing layer. A slurry of Vulcan XC-72R carbon black and polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE), consisting of 20 wt% PTFE with a carbon loading of 1.0 ± 0.1 mg cm−2, was coated onto the carbon paper to form the anodic diffusion layer (ADL). For the cathode side, carbon cloth (Type A, 10 wt% wet-proofed) was used as the cathodic backing layer. A slurry of MGs and PTFE, consisting of 20 wt% of PTFE with a carbon loading of 2.0 ± 0.2 mg cm−2, was coated onto the carbon cloth to form the cathodic diffusion layer (CDL), herein labelled as MG-CDL. For comparison, a conventional CDL with Vulcan XC-72R carbon black was obtained using the same procedure, which was labelled as XC-CDL. Catalyst ink was prepared by mixing a given amount of catalyst with 5 wt% Nafion solution (DuPont), isopropyl alcohol, and water. After being ultrasonically dispersed for at least 3 h at room temperature, the above catalyst ink was sprayed onto the surface of the diffusion layer to form the gas diffusion electrode. Here, a mixture of Pt–Ru (1:1) black (HiSPEC™ 6000, Johnson Matthey) and Pt–Ru (1:1)/C (HiSPEC™ 10000) with a mass ratio of 3:5 was used as the anode catalyst, while Pt/C (HiSPEC™ 9100) was used as the cathode catalyst. The metal loadings were 4.0 ± 0.2 mg cm−2, and the Nafion content was 20 wt % for both the anode and cathode. Finally, an MEA with 4 cm2 active surface area was obtained by hot-pressing the anode and cathode onto a pre-treated Nafion 115 membrane at 6 MPa and 130 °C for 3 min.
Characterization
The morphology of MGs was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Supra 55, Carl Zeiss), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL), and atomic force microscope (AFM, Multimode V, Veeco). For TEM characterization, the samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol to obtain uniform ink. Then, a drop of ink was mounted onto copper grids covered with holey carbon film and dried in the air. The AFM was operated in tapping mode using silicon cantilevers with a force constant of 40 N m−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Diffraction patterns were collected at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 and with a step of 0.02°. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of MGs were measured at 77 K using a surface area analyzer (ASAP 2010 Micromeritics). Before measurements, the sample was degassed in a vacuum at 200 °C for at least 6 h. The specific surface area and pore volume were determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the single point method, respectively. Pore size distribution curves were obtained using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The electrical conductivity of MGs was measured with a powder resistivity meter (FZ-9601, Shanghai Xiyu Co. Ltd.) by confining the pressed MG powders between two metal discs. During the conductivity measurement, a pressure of 2 MPa was applied to ensure good electrical contacts between the carbon grains. Evaluation of the electronic structure and surface composition for MGs was conducted with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Escalab 250, Thermo Scientific) using Al Kα radiation. The binding energy was referenced to the C 1s spectrum at 284.5 eV. The Raman spectrum was collected using a Raman microscope (DXR, Thermo Scientific) under 514 nm excitation. The FTIR spectrum was recorded in the range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 0.1 cm−1 using a Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet).
Single cell testing
For the DMFC test, the MEA was sandwiched between two gold-plated current collectors. The polarization curves were obtained using a fuel cell testing system (Arbin) under passive operation with 3 M methanol solution. After a 2 minute waiting period to obtain a stable voltage reading, each discharging current point along a polarization curve was obtained. The discharge tests of passive DMFCs were conducted at a constant current density of 40 mA cm−2.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured on a Solartron Impedance/Gain-phase analyzer (Model 1260A) controlled by a personal computer with Corrware software (Scribner Associates, Inc.). The impedance spectra were acquired at a given direct-current (DC) potential of 0.5 V with a frequency range from 10 kHz to 10 mHz and with the amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage signal less than 10 mV. The obtained impedance spectra were analysed on the basis of an electrical circuit element model. The fitting errors were kept within 10%.
Results and discussion
The synthesis procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1. An emulsion was formed by mixing ammonium oleate, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and formaldehyde solution. Ammonium ions bridge oleic acid and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid by weak acid–base interactions and lead to the formation of phenolic polymer-ammonium oleate supramoleculars in the polymerization process.20 In the following pyrolysis, as the temperature rises from room temperature to approximately 600 °C, a series of nitrogen-containing polymers are formed as dicyandiamide undergoes polymerization (e.g., melamine, melem, melon, and so on23) that finally leads to g-C3N4 polymers, accompanied by the pyrolysis of phenolic polymer to form layered graphene sheets. When the temperature is further increased from 600 to 1000 °C, abundant mesopores can be created due to the rapid decomposition of the g-C3N4 template between the graphene sheets.

Fig. 2 presents the morphological observation of the MGs created by the sacrificial template method. The FESEM images in Fig. 2a and b reveal that the MGs have a highly porous morphology, and entangled, transparent, three-dimensional nanosheets with macroporous networks and mesoporous channels are clearly observed. The diameter of these open pores ranges from 10 nm up to several hundred nanometers. Unlike chemically reduced graphenes obtained from graphene oxides, which extensively aggregate into thick sheets,24 the primary nanosheets in MGs are thin and very flexible, the wall thickness of which is within a few nanometers. TEM characterization (shown in Fig. 2c and d) shows the typical wrinkles of oligolayered graphenes. A detailed inspection for MGs in Fig. 2c reveals that the width of the nanosheets ranges from 500–600 nm and the thickness does not exceed 5 nm. The high resolution TEM image of MGs presented in Fig. S1† further confirms the formation of multilayer graphene with a layer thickness of 2–4 nm. A representative AFM image of MGs is shown in Fig. 3, which gives a single graphene nanosheet deposited on the silicon wafer. The height profile to the right of Fig. 3 shows that the thickness of the nanosheet is approximately 4 nm, indicating that the as-obtained graphene nanosheet is few-layered, which is in good agreement with the results of the TEM observation.

 Fig. 3  Typical AFM image of MGs. The curve in the upper right panel shows the height and width information of graphene nanosheets from the AFM image. 
The XRD was used to determine the crystalline structure of MGs. Fig. 4 displays the XRD patterns of MGs and graphite. A broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 26° corresponding to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon appears at the XRD pattern of MGs, indicating the successful formation of graphitic aromatic structure in MGs owing to the high-temperature pyrolysis of phenolic polymer. As compared to the sharp (002) peak of graphite, the (002) peak of MGs is quite weaker and broader, demonstrating that graphene sheets in MGs are loosely stacked, which is derived from the g-C3N4 template that is formed during the high-temperature calcination and is then decomposed at a higher temperature, in good accordance with the SEM and TEM images. According to Bragg's law, the interlayer spacing (d002) was calculated to be approximately 0.342 nm for MGs, slightly broader than those of well-ordered bulk graphite (0.335 nm). In addition, as for MGs, a small (100) peak (the inset of Fig. 4) can be observed, indicating a fairly high degree of graphitization.25

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of MGs in Fig. 5a show a typical type IV curve with a large H2 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores. These mesopores are generated by the in situ formation and decomposition of g-C3N4 template.21 However, graphenes (Grs) that were synthesized without using dicyandiamide exhibit a typical type I isotherm, where the main adsorption occurs at low relative P/P0 pressures, which is a characteristic of microporous materials.26 The textural properties of two samples are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface area of MGs is calculated to be 283.4 m2 g−1, slightly higher than that of the 2D mesoporous graphene nanosheets previously reported,27 while this data is significantly lower than that of the graphenes obtained without using dicyandiamide. The mesopore surface area for MGs reaches 265.9 m2 g−1, and the mesopore content (the ratio of mesopore volume to total pore volume) is approximately 98.6%, indicating that MGs mainly consist of mesopores. The total pore volume for MGs is estimated to be approximately 0.70 cm3 g−1, much larger than that of Grs, which is attributed to the existence of abundant mesopores in MGs. The mesopore volume for MGs is approximately 0.69 cm3 g−1, much larger than that of Grs (0.17 cm3 g−1), indicating that dicyandiamide plays an important role in forming mesoporous structure, as the graphenes obtained without using dicyandiamide exhibit much less mesopore volume than that of MGs. The BJH pore size distribution (Fig. 5b) indicates that MGs possess a relatively narrow pore size distribution, with a sharp peak at 4 nm and a flat peak at 10 nm. In contrast, no peak is observed in the pore size distribution curve for Grs.

These results demonstrate again the important role of the g-C3N4 sacrificial template in the formation of the mesoporous graphene structure. Table 1 reveals an average pore diameter of 9.3 nm for MGs, calculated through the desorption isotherm, which is much larger than that of Grs (3.1 nm). Such a large average pore size is uncommon for graphene materials (the average pore size of chemically reduced graphene oxides is 2–6 nm with a wide pore size distribution25,28) and can be ascribed to the use of the g-C3N4 sacrificial template in the pyrolysis synthesis. It is noted that the graphenes reported by Li et al.,21 which were synthesized using glucose as the carbon source and dicyandiamide as the template precursor, do not exhibit distinctive characteristics of mesoporous materials. However, in our work, phenolic polymer-ammonium oleate supramolecular aggregates as a carbon source, which are much larger than glucose, can more effectively wrap dicyandiamide and form strong intermolecular interactions, thus facilitating the formation of a mesoporous structure in high-temperature pyrolysis. The bulk electrical conductivity of MGs was determined to be approximately 171.7 S cm−1, which is much higher than that reported for mesoporous graphene nanoballs prepared by chemical vapour deposition.11
The wide survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 6a) of MGs reveals the presence of C, N, and O elements. The total nitrogen and oxygen content of MGs was calculated from XPS to be 2.04% and 19.57%, respectively. The high content of foreign atoms (including N and O) may be due in part to the presence of surface-absorbed water and other small molecules, because such high-surface-area carbons are superadsorbing materials.21 The high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 6b) displays three different peaks at 284.5, 286.1, and 288.6 eV, corresponding to CC–C (sp2 C), C–O/C–N, and CO groups, respectively. The high-resolution N 1s scan (Fig. 6c) indicates the presence of three forms of nitrogen, namely, pyridinic N (397.5 ± 0.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 ± 0.2 eV), and graphitic N (401.5 ± 0.2 eV).29 The nitrogen content of MGs can be controlled and adjusted by the amount of dicyandiamide and the heating temperature.

Raman spectroscopy is an effective technique to investigate the structural changes of graphene layers. The Raman spectrum of MGs is shown in Fig. S2.† The peak located at approximately 1370 cm−1 is the D band related to the edges, defects, and structural disorders in MGs. The G band at approximately 1570 cm−1 arises from the first-order scattering of E2g mode of sp2 carbon. The intensity ratio of two bands (ID/IG) is widely used to prove the graphitization degree of carbon materials. A lower value represents a higher degree of graphitization.30 The MGs show an ID/IG value of approximately 0.97, much lower than that of the graphene material obtained from chemical reduction of graphene oxide (ID/IG = approximately 2.4),31 indicating that MGs synthesized using the sacrificial template approach possess a higher graphitization degree and relatively fewer defects. In addition, the sharp peak at 2330 cm−1 can be assigned to the fundamental vibration of surface-attached N2 molecules.32 The FTIR spectrum of MGs is shown in Fig. S3.† The sharp peaks of moderate intensity at 2362 and 2332 cm−1 correspond to the presence of a residual nitrile group (CN) on the surface of the sample.33 The absorption band near 1688 cm−1 confirms the presence of CO groups.34 The absorption band at approximately 1637 cm−1 can be assigned to the skeletal vibrations of CC and/or CN of graphitic domains.34,35 The band at 1400 cm−1 might be from the deformation vibrations of the OH groups on the surface of MGs,36 and the band at approximately 738 cm−1 associates with C–H due to plane deformation.37
MGs synthesized using the sacrificial template approach not only have a high electrical conductivity but also possess abundant mesoporous structures that are beneficial to promote mass transfer in the electrode/electrolyte interface, and we have fabricated a cathodic diffusion layer for passive DMFCs that is composed of MGs. For a fair comparison, the same amount of MGs and XC-72R carbon was coated onto the backing layer (porous substrate) to form the cathodic diffusion layer. Fig. 7a compares the polarization curves of two passive DMFCs utilizing MGs and XC-72R carbon within the CDL, respectively. It can be observed that in the low current density region, the two passive DMFCs exhibit similar kinetic and ohmic polarization due to the similar catalyst layers that were used. However, in high current density, the polarization curve of the passive DMFC with MGs shows a smaller voltage drop compared with the DMFC utilizing XC-72R carbon. The maximum power density for the passive DMFC with MGs is approximately 32.9 mW cm−2, which is approximately 1.2 times higher than that with XC-72R (27.9 mW cm−2). The discharge curves (Fig. 7b) for passive DMFCs utilizing MGs and XC-72R within the CDL are compared under a constant current density of 40 mA cm−2. It can be seen that the passive DMFC with MGs shows a higher and more stable cell voltage than that with XC-72R. The Faraday efficiency and energy efficiency for the passive DMFC with MGs are calculated to be 42.0% and 13.8%, respectively, which is much higher than those of the passive DMFC with XC-72R (33.8% and 10.7%).

To clarify the effect of MGs within the cathodic diffusion layer on cell performance, the EIS for two MEAs were analysed. Fig. S4† shows the experimental impedance spectra and the simulation data based on an equivalent circuit presented in Fig. S4b† for the passive DMFCs employing MGs and XC-72R in the CDL, respectively. The fitting results are in good agreement with the experimental data essentially over the full range of frequencies, and the fitting parameters are listed in Table S1.† The passive DMFC with MGs possesses a much lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct-c, 0.405 Ω) than that with XC-72R (0.825 Ω) for cathodic oxygen reduction, indicating that the adoption of MGs in the cathodic diffusion layer results in a significant decrease in charge-transfer resistance. It is well known that for electrochemical reactions involving gases or liquids, increasing the concentration of electroactive reactant increases the charge-transfer rate, which would result in the acceleration of the electrochemical reaction and improvement of cell performance. Therefore, the probable reason for the decreased charge-transfer resistance is that MGs within the CDL facilitate oxygen diffusion, leading to an increased oxygen concentration, which might explain the improved performance of the passive DMFC with MGs, as shown in Fig. 7.
Conclusions
We have developed an effective method for the fabrication of mesoporous graphenes from a phenolic polymer precursor via a template-assisted pyrolysis process. Mesopores were generated by the in situ formation and decomposition of g-C3N4. The mesoporous graphenes exhibited a large specific mesopore surface area and high bulk conductivity. The passive DMFC utilizing MGs within the cathodic diffusion layer showed good performance and discharge stability. The outstanding performance of MGs as a material that can be used as a porous diffusion layer for DMFCs highlights its potential in energy-related applications.
