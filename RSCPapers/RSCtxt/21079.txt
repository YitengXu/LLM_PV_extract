    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 1st June 2020AbstractDesigning near-infrared (NIR) absorbing donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers with photoresponse beyond 900 nm has remained a challenge in the area of organic photovoltaics (OPV) owing to the limited kinds of strong electron acceptors. Here we present the use of pyrrolopyrrole aza-BODIPY (PPAB) as a new acceptor group in D–A polymers in place of a conventional diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor to achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 2.27% despite the ultra-small bandgap of 1.08 eV. The small photon energy loss of the PPAB-based D–A polymer and moderately high short-circuit current of 8.52 mA cm−2 arising from the panchromatic visible/NIR absorption guarantee PPAB as a potential building block of D–A polymers for NIR photovoltaics.
Introduction
Over the past two decades, semiconducting polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaics1,2 have emerged as a promising renewable energy technology owing to their advantages such as low cost, light weight and solution-processing for flexible devices.3,4 The certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of such polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently reached 14% by developing p- and n-type materials and device architectures and morphologies.5 According to the Shockley–Queisser limit,6 which predicts an optimal bandgap (Eg) of ∼1.4 eV for a single-junction photovoltaic cell under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination, donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers exhibiting optical response up to ∼900 nm have been intensively investigated,2,7,8 thereby limiting the use of the rest of the solar spectrum in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is indispensable for realizing multi-junction solar cells.9,10
Recently, Janssen et al. developed ultra-small bandgap D–A polymers with high NIR photoresponse (PCEs of 2.9–3.5% with up to 50% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 1000 nm) by combining diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a conventional acceptor7,11–15 with a series of strongly electron-donating pyrrole-based groups, which progressively raise the HOMO level to decrease Eg to 1.13 eV.16 Their pioneering work disclosed the crucial requisite for precise energy control of both p- and n-type materials to balance the photovoltaic performance and bandgap by minimizing energy loss (Eloss) defined by Eg − eVoc, where e and Voc denote the elementary charge and open-circuit voltage, respectively. The lower limit of Eloss has been proposed to be 0.6 eV due to the trade-off relationship with the quantum efficiency of charge generation.17Eloss of most successful PSCs thus ranges between 0.7 eV and 0.8 eV. Meanwhile, there have been reports on efficient charge generation in PSCs with Eloss less than 0.6 eV,18 and further reduction of Eloss has recently been proposed to realize a new efficiency regime for organic photovoltaics (OPV).19 In this context, although several factors should be considered, it is essential to tune the LUMO energy offset between p-type D–A polymers and n-type materials to minimize Eloss owing to the inherently small Eg for NIR PSCs.
Pyrrolopyrrole aza-BODIPY (PPAB)20 is a newly designed functional chromophore derived from DPP and heteroaromatic amines by a facile Schiff base forming reaction.21 Because of the π-extended structure, PPAB exhibits far-red/NIR absorption and fluorescence with high quantum yields, which have been further applied in various fields such as aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE),22 two-photon absorption (TPA),23 photoacoustic imaging,24,25 photothermal cancer therapy25 and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECLs) in the NIR region.26 During our investigation on OPV application of PPAB20c and PPAB-based small molecules,27,28 we noticed that PPAB provides sufficiently deep LUMO levels for charge transfer to [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor. In the case of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) triads using cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as a donor, the PCE was improved from DPP–CPDT–DPP triad (0.18%) to DPP–CPDT–PPAB triad (1.49%) and PPAB–CPDT–PPAB triad (3.88%) by replacing a DPP acceptor with PPAB despite the gradual red-shift of the photoresponse up to 1000 nm in this order. In addition, the Eloss values of the PPAB-based triads (0.52 eV for DPP–CPDT–PPAB triad and 0.54 eV for PPAB–CPDT–PPAB triad) were smaller than the suggested lower limit.17 These results motivated us to further extend PPAB–CPDT combination to the NIR PSCs.
To extend the library of the PPAB-based D–A systems, here we present the synthesis of three kinds of D–A polymers comprising DPP or PPAB or both as acceptors and CPDT as a donor. Replacement of DPP with PPAB in the D–A polymers selectively lowered the LUMO level, while the HOMO level remained almost unchanged, decreasing Eg from 1.30 eV to 1.08 eV. Inversely, the PPAB-based PSCs showed better NIR photoresponse with PCEs up to 2.27% and a small Eloss value of 0.53 eV.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of DPP- and PPAB-based D–A polymers
The D–A polymers (P1–P3) were synthesized by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling condensation polymerization29 of dibromo-substituted DPP (DPP-2Br)30 or PPAB (PPAB-2Br)27 or both with bis(trimethylstannyl)-CPDT (CPDT-2SnMe3)31 (Scheme 1). All D–A polymers were purified by successive Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform and obtained in high yields (77% for P1, 89% for P2 and 79% for P3).32

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis in chloroform at 40 °C revealed the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 45, 794 and 280 kg mol−1 for P1, P2 and P3 with rather high polydispersity index (PDI) of 67.4, 9.5 and 72.7, respectively, due to aggregation in chloroform, especially in the case of P1 and P3 (Table 1). The chemical structures of P1–P3 were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which revealed the proton signals at similar chemical shifts to the corresponding triads reported in our previous study (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†).28

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical and electrochemical properties of P1–P3 were characterized by UV/vis/NIR absorption and photoelectron yield spectroscopies (PYS) (Table 1). In the film state, the D–A polymers exhibited intense, panchromatic absorption in the vis/NIR regions ranging from 300 to 1200 nm with an absorption maximum at 969, 912 and 816 nm for P1, P2 and P3, respectively (Fig. 1). Introducing PPAB into the polymer backbone in place of DPP improved absorption in the shorter visible region and the NIR region. This trend agrees well with that observed for the PPAB- and/or DPP-based A–D–A triads in our previous study.28 The red-shifts of the absorption spectra of these polymers by 162–665 cm−1 from the solution state to the thin film state were rather modest (Fig. S4, ESI†). The Eg estimated from the onset of the film absorption decreased in the order of P3 (1.30 eV), P2 (1.12 eV) and P1 (1.08 eV) upon increasing the ratio of PPAB groups in the polymers. The PYS measurements revealed similar HOMO energy levels (P1: −5.19 eV, P2: −5.16 eV and P3: −5.17 eV), indicating dominant contribution of the CPDT moiety to determine the HOMO energy levels of the polymers. On the basis of the Eg and the HOMO energy levels, the LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −4.11 eV for P1, −4.04 eV for P2 and −3.87 eV for P3. The LUMO energy levels decreased from P3 to P1 due to the stronger electron accepting nature of PPAB than DPP. Taken these results together, the ultra-small bandgaps of P1–P3 (1.08–1.30 eV) were tuned mainly by the low lying LUMO energy levels of the PPAB groups.

OPV performance
Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC)33–35 measurements using monochromatic light pulse from a nano-second laser (laser-flash)36,37 and white-light pulse from a Xe flash-lamp (Xe-flash)38 as the photoexcitation source provide the maximum transient conductivity (ϕΣμmax) and photoconductivity maxima (Δσmax), respectively. ϕ and Σμ represent charge charrier generation efficiency and the sum of the hole and electron mobilities, whereas Δσmax includes information about not only the yield and local mobility of charge carriers, but also their lifetime and photoabsorption. The increase in ϕΣμmax upon mixing P1–P3 with [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) indicated that all polymers can function as a p-type material in BHJ-OPVs (Fig. S5a, ESI†). On the basis of Δσmax, the best blend ratio of polymers and PC61BM was estimated to lie between 1:1 and 1:2, and the magnitude of Δσmax was in the order of P1 > P2 > P3 (Fig. S5b, ESI†).
To improve photoresponse in the visible region, PC71BM was used instead of PC61BM, and BHJ-OPVs with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO (30 nm)/P1–P3:PC71BM (36–134 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated (Fig. S6, ESI†). The potential device conditions according to the TRMC measurements were further optimized by controlling polymers/PC71BM ratio, active-layer thickness and amount of solvent additives as described in detail below.
Considering the low solubility of P1, chlorobenzene was selected as a solvent for device fabrication owing to the better solubility at high temperature. After screening the D/A ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 according to the TRMC measurements, the optimal D/A ratio of polymers and PC71BM for BHJ-OPVs was 1:1 for P1 and P2 and 1:3 for P3 (Fig. S7, S11 and S14 and Tables S1, S5 and S8, ESI†). Among various additives tested (1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and diphenyl ether (DPE)), P1-based PSCs processed with DPE exhibited the highest PCE of 2.27% compared with those with other additives (PCEs of 2.13% and 1.78% using DIO and CN as an additive, respectively) (Fig. S8 and Table S2, ESI†). The optimal amount of DPE additive varies depending on polymers, 0.5% for P1, 2.5% for P2 and 1.0% for P3 (Fig. S9, S12 and S15 and Tables S3, S6 and S9, ESI†). For the active layer thickness, the polymers exhibited the best OPV performance when the thickness is less than 70 nm (61 nm for P1, 68 nm for P2 and 69 nm for P3) (Fig. S10, S13 and S16 and Tables S4, S7 and S10, ESI†). The fill factor (FF) of P1-based PSCs decreased as the thickness was increased from 36 to 100 nm due to the lowering of the extraction efficiency of photogenerated carriers, whereas the Jsc was enhanced to a certain degree. A closer look at the changes in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of P1-based PSCs at various thicknesses revealed the increase in EQE in the NIR region when the thickness was increased up to 61 nm owing to the NIR photoresponse of P1, whereas the EQE in the visible region dropped at larger thicknesses (∼100 nm) due to the aggregation of PC71BM. A similar tendency was observed for P3-based PSCs. In contrast, the EQE spectra of P2-based PSCs decreased in the whole vis/NIR regions at the high thicknesses due to poor charge transportation.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQE spectra of the optimized devices for P1–P3 are shown in Fig. 2, and the data are summarized in Table 2. Because of the longer wavelength limit of our instrument, the EQE spectra ended at 1100 nm. As anticipated from the HOMO energy levels (Table 1), similar Voc of 0.54–0.59 V was observed for all the PSCs. In contrast, the short-circuit current (Jsc) increased from P3 (3.36 mA cm−2) to P2 (6.25 mA cm−2) and further to P1 (8.52 mA cm−2). The high Jsc of P1-based PSCs can be attributed to the intense, panchromatic absorption of P1 compared with P2 and P3. The order of Jsc as well as PCE are consistent with that of Δσmax obtained in the TRMC measurements using a white-light pulse. The EQE spectra of the optimized devices, which were superimposed on the absorption spectra of the corresponding polymers and PC71BM, ensured NIR photoresponse of P1 and P2 extending to 1200 nm (Fig. 3).

To rationalize the high PCE of 2.27% and NIR photoresponse in the case of the P1-based PSC, maximum EQE (EQEmax) and Eloss values were compared (Table 2). In inverse proportion to the decrease of Eloss values from P3 (0.71 eV) to P2 (0.58 eV) and P1 (0.52 eV), the EQEmax increased from P3 (7%) to P2 (14%) and P1 (17%). It is remarkable that the Eloss values of P1 and P2 are below the empirical lower limit of 0.6 eV.17 This indicates that PPAB-based polymers are highly compatible with fullerene-based acceptors, although several mechanisms should be incorporated into the working mechanism with the low Eloss for the P1- and P2-based PSCs.
Film morphology
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for further study on the interior morphologies of the BHJ active layers to reveal the difference in nanoscale phase segregation of P1–P3 (Fig. 4). The bright and dark regions represented the polymer-rich and PC71BM-rich domains, respectively, due to the higher electron density of PC71BM than that of polymers. All active layers exhibited homogeneous and fine nanostructures with different domain sizes. The domain sizes (D) estimated using power spectral densities (PSDs) calculated by the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D FFT) analysis were 11 nm for P1:PC71BM, 22 nm for P2:PC71BM and 12 nm for P3:PC71BM.39 Considering the short exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductor, which is normally less than 10 nm, the small D of P1:PC71BM may facilitate charge generation at the D/A interfaces to attain high Jsc values. In addition to the small Eloss, the suitable D of P1:PC71BM also contributes to its reasonable photoresponse in the NIR region.

Conclusions
In this study, we have developed a series of D–A polymers comprising DPP or PPAB or both as acceptors. Upon replacement of DPP with PPAB, the optical bandgap decreased from 1.30 eV to 1.08 eV due to the stronger electron accepting nature of PPAB than DPP. Consequently, panchromatic absorptions extending to 1200 nm were achieved for the PPAB-based polymers (P1 and P2). Despite the small Eloss values below 0.6 eV, which generally causes inefficient charge generation, PPAB-based PSCs with PC71BM as a n-type material exhibited moderately high NIR photoresponse with EQEmax of 17% for P1 and 14% for P2. Ultimately, the best performance with PCE of 2.27% and the Jsc as high as 8.52 mA cm−2 was achieved for the P1-based PSC. Considering the D–A polymers with NIR photoresponse have still been on its infant stage, the small Eloss of PPAB-based polymers in combination with PC71BM is highly potential for future application in the NIR PSCs. In addition, further improvement of photoresponse in the visible region by controlling the HOMO energy level with other types of donor groups in place of CPDT may enhance the overall PCEs. Research along these directions will be reported in due course from our laboratory.
Experimental
Instrumentation and measurements
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-770 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-ECX500 spectrometer (operating at 495 MHz for 1H) using a residual solvent as an internal reference for 1H (δ = 7.26 ppm for CDCl3). Molecular weights (number-average molecular weight: Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of polymers were determined using a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (gel permeation chromatography: GPC) method with polystyrene standards. SEC-GPC analysis was performed using chloroform as an eluent at a flow rate of 1 cm3 min−1 at 40 °C, on a SHIMADZU LC-20AT/CBM-20A/CTO-20A chromatography instrument connected to a SHIMADZU SPD-M20A UV/vis detector. Photoelectron yield spectra (PYS) were recorded on a RikenKeiki AC-3 ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 120 keV. The spin-coated thin films on mica were peeled from substrates by soaking in water and then transferred onto copper grids for TEM observations. All reagents and solvents used for reactions were of commercial reagent grade and were used without further purification unless noted otherwise. All solvents used in optical measurements were of commercial spectroscopic grade.
Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC)
A resonance cavity was used to obtain a high degree of sensitivity in the conductivity measurement. The resonance frequency and microwave power were set at ca. 9.1 GHz and 3 mW, respectively, so that the electric field of the microwave was sufficiently small not to disturb the motion of charge carriers. Nanosecond laser pulse at third-harmonic generation (THG; 355 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite II, 5–8 ns pulse duration, 10 Hz) or microsecond white-light pulse from a Xe flash lamp was used as an excitation source. The photoconductivity Δσ was obtained by ΔPr/(APr) where ΔPr, A and Pr are the transient power changes of the reflected microwave from a cavity, the sensitivity factor and the reflected microwave power, respectively. The power of the white-light pulse was 0.3 mJ cm−2 pulse−1. The samples were drop-cast on a quartz plate from solutions of the polymers and PC61BM and dried in a vacuum oven. The TRMC experiments were performed under ambient conditions at room temperature.
OPV device fabrication and evaluation
Prepatterned ITO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonic cleaned sequentially in detergent solution (15 min), deionized water (10 min × 2) and acetone (10 min), kept in isopropyl alcohol overnight, and then subjected to UV/ozone treatment for 30 min. A thin layer (∼30 nm) of ZnO was prepared by spin-coating (at 5000 rpm for 30 s) a precursor solution of zinc acetate (1.00 g) and ethanolamine (0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (10 mL) filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane filter, followed by baking at 200 °C for 10 min under air. The photoactive layer was then deposited by spin-coating from a chlorobenzene solution containing a donor and PC71BM after passing through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane filter. The thicknesses of the photoactive layers were ca. 36–134 nm, measured with a profilometer. The thin films were then loaded into an E-200 vacuum evaporation system (ALS Technology). Finally, 10 nm-thick MoO3 and 100 nm-thick Ag layers were sequentially vacuum-deposited on top of the photoactive layers under high vacuum (<5.0 × 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask, defining an active area of 0.04 cm2 for each device. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQE spectra of the fabricated OPVs were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measure unit in air, under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) conditions, using a Xe lamp-based SRO-25GD solar simulator and IPCE measurement system (Bunko Keiki). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified silicon photovoltaic reference cell.
