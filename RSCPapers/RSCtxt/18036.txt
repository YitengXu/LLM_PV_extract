    First published on 14th December 2011AbstractIn our developing world, carbon dioxide has become one of the most abundant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is a stable, inert, small molecule that continues to present significant challenges toward its chemical activation as a useful carbon end product. This tutorial review describes one approach to the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbonfuels, using cobalt and nickel molecular catalysts, with particular focus on studying the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 binding to metal catalytic sites.

1. Introduction
There are both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to overcome for successful reduction of CO2 to carbon products. The former are outlined in eqn (1)–(6). Eqn (7) shows the thermodynamic potential of a competing reaction for CO2reduction, and that is the reduction of H+ to hydrogen. Here Eo′ is the formal potential vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) under standard conditions in aqueous solution: pH 7, 25 °C, 1 atmosphere of gases, and 1 M solutes. Because the one-electron reduction of CO2 to CO2˙− requires nearly two eV of free energy, a proton-assisted approach to CO2reduction, such as those in eqn (2)–(6), lowers the thermodynamic barrier significantly. Transition-metal complexes can have accessible multiple redox states that promote such proton-assisted, multi-electron pathways. Molecular systems that are capable of catalysing the reduction of CO2 typically give the products CO and/or formic acid (HCO2H), but examples that reduce CO2 to higher energy products such as methanol and methane are rare, typically inefficient, and not selective. Fig. 1 shows a Latimer–Frost diagram1 for the multi-electron, multi-protonreduction of CO2 in homogeneous aqueous solution at pH 7 (red points); the dashed lines correspond to the potentials in eqn (2)–(6). The intermediates in such a diagram, all of which lie well above the appropriate dashed line (except for CO as an intermediate for the reaction of CO2 to H2CO), depend on the properties of the catalyst (if any). For any given product, the intermediate (point) that lies farthest in ΔG/n above the corresponding dashed line (i.e., the distance in free energy above a dashed line divided by the number of electrons added from the starting point, CO2) determines the intrinsic thermodynamic overpotential for that process. Alternative intermediates are indicated in Fig. 1 by the blue points and labels. Odd-electron intermediates tend to be relatively high-energy species compared to even-electron intermediates,2 so, apart from CO2˙−, we have listed and shown only the even-electron intermediates. CO2 + e− → CO2˙− Eo′ = −1.90 V(1) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O Eo′ = −0.53 V(2) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → HCO2H Eo′ = −0.61 V(3) CO2 + 4H+ + 4e− → HCHO + H2O Eo′ = −0.48 V(4) CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− → CH3OH + H2O Eo′ = −0.38 V(5) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + H2O Eo′ = −0.24 V(6) 2H+ + 2e− → H2 Eo′ = −0.41 V(7)
One of the key steps in catalyticCO2reduction involves the binding of CO2 to a vacant coordination site at the metal centre of a reduced catalyst (eqn (8) and (9)). The kinetics and thermodynamics of the process (eqn (10)) can have a major effect on the overall mechanism and efficiency of the catalytic cycles. Therefore, it is important that the binding step be fully characterised and understood. This is particularly apparent when inert, stable molecules such as CO2 are used as the substrate. Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule that usually binds to a metal catalyst through the electrophilic carbon atom. This causes a change in geometry of CO2 from linear to bent, a difficult rearrangement that may require a large excess of energy, especially in the absence of protons. The solubility of CO2 in organic and aqueous solutions is also a limiting factor for studying it as a substrate for catalyticactivation. For example, the solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution is ca. 0.03 M while that in MeCN is roughly ten times greater. Further, CO2 equilibria in aqueous solution are complicated to say the least.3 Equilibrium and rate constants that favour the product of a given CO2reduction reaction (e.g., CO) can have an overall adverse effect on catalytic ability. However, kinetic parameters for CO2 binding (eqn (10)) need to be small enough not to form a stable ML(CO2)+ adduct, yet large enough for catalysis to occur. MIIL2+ + e− ⇌ MIL+(8) (9) KCO2 = [ML(CO2)+]/{[MIL+][CO2]} = kf/kr(10)
In this review, we describe both photo- and electrocatalytic CO2reduction systems. In the photocatalytic systems (see Scheme 1), light is required to excite ground-state chromophores that, once in the excited-state, are reductively quenched by a sacrificial electron donor, typically a tertiary amine, and transfer an electron to a separate, molecular catalyst (MIIL2+) to produce a reduced state of the catalyst (MIL+, see eqn (8)). The reduced species reacts further with the substrate, CO2 (or H+, CO, etc.). If a ML(H)2+ is formed (eqn (11)) CO2 may insert into the M–H bond to give the formate adduct, M–OCHO (eqn (12)). The CO, formate (HCO2−), and H2 yields depend on the binding equilibria and the rates of various competing reactions; CO and HCO2− remain desirable end products of CO2reduction and H2 a desirable side product. MIL+ + H+ → ML(H)2+(11) ML(H)2+ + CO2 → ML(OCHO)2+(12)
In an electrocatalytic system, there is no need for a sacrificial reagent or even a chromophore. The reducing equivalents for eqn (8) come directly from the electrode surface and electrons are transferred either following diffusion of the catalyst to the electrode surface or by catalyst adsorption onto the electrode surface. Electricity obtained by photovoltaic or dye-sensitized solar cells can be used for the catalyticreduction of CO2. The initial steps between the two processes are different but the catalytic steps in both photo- and electrocatalytic systems are comparable.

1.1. Scope of review
This tutorial review considers experiments that deal with the isolation and characterisation of complex intermediates and their kinetics, as they pertain to the binding of substrates to reduced metal macrocycles, and how the data correlate with catalytic activity. There are a number of recent reviews that describe the features of photo- and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 using metal catalysts, e.g., catalytic efficiencies; product turnover numbers, frequencies, and selectivities; catalyst stability; etc.,4–10 and interested readers are encouraged to seek those out for more information. Because the literature has been extensively reviewed in this context, we have chosen to focus on thermodynamic and kinetic experiments using metal macrocyclic catalysts and how those parameters relate to CO2reduction (and H+reduction), for which there are no current accounts. In particular, we will describe properties associated with cobalt and nickel complexes of the macrocyclic ligand 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) and its derivatives in Chart 1. The importance of determining parameters such as the equilibrium constant of substrate binding, KS (S = substrate such as CO2, CO, or H+), to catalytic centres will be discussed. These studies can be important for developing efficient molecular catalysts, and we outline below how to determine such parameters from five example techniques. While much of the seminal work in this field has postulated the involvement of intermediate species, little spectroscopic evidence for such intermediates was obtained. It should be understood that although intermediates cannot always be isolated, kinetic and thermodynamic studies can provide better insight into the existence of postulated reaction intermediates, such as those suggested in Scheme 1.

Metallo-porphyrins, phthalocyanines, corroles, and chlorins have also shown evidence for electro- and photocatalytic reduction of CO2, but there have been no reports of CO2 adducts of such metallo-macrocycles due to the highly reactive nature of the unsaturated system(s).7 However, it has been suggested that the catalytic reaction pathways using metal ‘cyclam-like’ catalysts are similar to the reaction pathways for metal ‘porphyrin-like’ catalysts, except for the involvement of catalytically active species such as M0 for ‘porphyrin-like’, instead of MI for ‘cyclam-like’ catalysts.7
2. Overview of methods
It is far beyond the extent of this review to cover every possible method/technique that may be used for isolation and characterisation of reaction intermediates, but the ability to use multiple techniques is certainly advantageous. This section describes five methods that have proven useful. Electrochemical methods are suitable for every chemistry laboratory with regard to instrumentation, but the technique and analysis can be quite demanding. Spectroscopic methods involving chemical reduction, laser flash photolysis, and pulse radiolysis are also considered. Finally, theoretical studies based on DFT calculations have become ubiquitous, and hybrid DFT calculations with large basis sets are now quite feasible and can be used for predicting free-energy profiles of catalytic reactions in addition to geometric and electronic structures. Other methods of characterising intermediates are presented throughout the text.
2.1. Electrochemical
One typically measures the reduction potentials (E1/2red) for cobalt or nickel ‘cyclam-like’ macrocycles using electrochemical sweep methods, e.g., cyclic voltammetry (CV), in solutions that have been purged with an inert gas (Ar or N2). When CO2 or CO is introduced into the solution the E1/2red—usually the MII/I couple—of the metal macrocycle may shift or become an irreversible process. When electron transfer and forward (kf) and reverse (kr) reactions (e.g., eqn (8)–(10)) are sufficiently rapid, and KS is relatively large so that the system is always in equilibrium, KS can be determined by measuring the change in E1/2red in solutions that contain different amounts of the dissolved substrate. A value for KS can be obtained by taking the exponential of the intercept from a linear plot of E1/2redvs. ln[S], derived from the modified Nernst relationship in eqn (13), where Eo′ is the MII/Ireduction potential in the absence of S (i.e., under Ar or N2), R is the gas constant in J mol−1 K−1, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction process (one for the case of MII/I), F is the Faraday constant in C mol−1, and q is the number of ligands involved in binding to the metal centre (one in the case of macrocyclic complexes).11,12 This new half-potential, E1/2red, modified by the binding of the substrate that removes MI from the solution, refers to the MII/MIS couple with [MII] = [MIS]. E1/2red = Eo′ + (RT/nF)ln(KS) + q(RT/nF)ln[S](13)
An example of the CO2 binding determination is shown in Fig. 2. From a plot of E1/2redvs. ln[CO2], Gangi and Durand obtained KCO2 of 7 × 104 M−1 in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for CoIL6+ (L6 = 5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,11-diene, Chart 1). Throughout this review values of KCO2 (and KCO) are quoted in units of M−1, as the solubility of CO2 (and CO) in a given solvent was taken from the literature or determined by known methods.13–17 Electrochemistry is an excellent method for determining the binding constants for metal macrocycles with CO2 or CO, but often there is no shift in the E1/2red in the presence of either gas. Such behaviour suggests that the complex does not interact with the substrate on the time scale of the CV, or the binding constant is too low to be measured by electrochemical methods. In some other cases, the CV becomes irreversible upon introduction of CO2, and only the cathodic component of the voltammogram may be observed. This can occur, for example, when electron transfer and forward reactions are sufficiently rapid (and KCO2 is also large) but the reverse reaction is slow. Simulation of CVs can be utilized to obtain the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters using commercially available programs such as BASi DigiSim® Simulation Software for Cyclic Voltammetry or DigiElch Electrochemical Simulation Software.18

2.2. Spectroscopic

2.2.1. Electrochemical and chemical reduction. 

Spectroscopy is an alternative approach to obtain KS. Bulk solutions of MImacrocycles may be generated by electrochemical or chemical reduction of MII (or from MIII for cobalt). It is then possible to introduce various concentrations of the substrate and study the resulting species (e.g., M–CO2 or M–CO) by spectroscopic methods. Bulk electrolysis is used to create solutions of MImacrocycles electrochemically, but isolation of intermediates formed via this method is complicated by the presence of high concentrations of electrolyte in solution. Chemical reduction of bulk solutions in aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile (MeCN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), is frequently accomplished using sodium amalgam (Na(Hg)) as a reducing agent. A mixture of Na and Hg with 0.5–1% Na has reducing power of ca. −2.0 V vs.NHE. The solvents must be rigorously dried, but only small quantities of the complex are necessary for spectroscopic studies. As with bulk electrolysis at very negative potentials, there are disadvantages to reduction by Na(Hg) as well. The strong reducing nature of Na(Hg) can reduce the metal macrocycles beyond their catalytically active MI state yielding unwanted colloids, or reduction of the macrocycle itself can lead to demetalation and product decomposition. Further, Na(Hg) is thermodynamically capable of direct reduction of CO2 to CO2˙−. The biggest drawback to Na(Hg)reduction is the experimental set-up. Methods used in our laboratory require special skills in glass-blowing, Schlenk line techniques, and the handling of reactive Na and toxic Hg vapour.
An example study investigated the reversible binding of CO2 to CoIL6+ in MeCN (eqn (9)).19 When solutions of CoL6(CO2)+ were heated at reduced CO2 pressure, partial dissociation to the parent complex was observed. The KCO2 values and other thermodynamic parameters (ΔGo(298) = (−5.5 ± 1.0) kcal mol−1, ΔHo = (−5.4 ± 1.0) kcal mol−1, ΔSo = (+0.4 ± 3) cal K−1 mol−1) were characterised by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3) using eqn (10) and (14). ΔGo = ΔHo − TΔSo = −RTln(KCO2)(14)The binding constant KCO2 = (1.2 ± 0.5) × 104 M−1 at 298 K in MeCN is slightly smaller than that reported for DMSO (7 × 104 M−1), as determined from CV experiments.16

            Laser flash photolysis
          . 
Transient-absorption spectra, lifetimes of various reactive intermediates MI and M–CO2 (or M–CO), and KCO2 can be measured by flash-quench experiments using a photosensitiser (PS), a quencher (i.e., an electron donor, D) and an MII species (eqn (9) and (15)–(19)). PS + hν → PS*(15) PS* + D → PS− + D+(16) PS− + MIIL2+ → PS + MIL+(17) KCO2 = [ML(CO2)+]/{[MIL+][CO2]} = ΔA/{A∞[CO2]}(18) kobs = kf[CO2] + kr(19)

Fig. 4 (left) shows an example of a transient decay curve for CoIL6+ monitored at 670 nm in a MeCN/methanol (MeOH) solution containing 0.1 mM terphenyl, 1 mM CoIIL62+, and 0.53 mM CO2; and (right) kinetic behaviour of the CoIL6+ in the presence of CO2.20 When CO2 is introduced into the system containing terphenyl and CoIIL62+, the lifetime of CoIL6+ changes dramatically. The variation of the observed rate constants for CoIL6+ decay with CO2 concentrations (0.53 to 7.2 mM) is shown in the right panel of Fig. 4. The CO2 binding rate constant of 1.7 × 108 M−1 s−1 is obtained from the slope of the line-fit in the figure. As shown in eqn (18), the binding equilibrium constant of 1.1 × 104 M−1 can be calculated using the decay traces because the initial and final absorbances of CoIL6+ at 670 nm can give the ratio of the total CoL6(CO2)+ complex (ΔA) to the unreacted CoIL6+ complex (A∞) using the fact that the CO2 adducts have no significant absorption in the visible region of the spectrum. Alternatively, KCO2 can be obtained by measuring kobs using solutions with various [CO2] (eqn (10) and (19)). However, in the case of CoIL6+, the error in kr is too large and the KCO2 could not be determined with this method.

2.2.3. 
            Pulse radiolysis
          . 

Pulse radiolysis is a unique type of spectroscopy that complements laser flash-quench experiments. Although the technique is somewhat limited to use in aqueous solution, it is certainly possible to perform experiments in organic media, but the possibility of radical reactions in organic solvents only complicates the species being studied. Since pulse radiolysis does not require a photosensitiser, the reduction chemistry of species that do not have high extinction coefficients such as Co–H and NiI or Ni–S (S = CO2, H) complexes of ‘cyclam-like’ macrocycles can be conveniently investigated. Through the radiolysis of water (eqn (20)), which occurs by rapid electron injection generated by an accelerator (e.g., a Van de Graaff generator) or by radioactive rays (e.g., 60Co γ-rays), free radicals are created and their concentrations are shown as the number in parentheses representing the G-value (number of molecules formed per 100 eV) of each species. H2O  eaq− (2.6), ˙H (0.6), ˙OH (2.7), H2 (0.45), H2O2 (0.7)(20)The rate constants for the free radicals generated in eqn (20) are well documented, as are their reactions with a number of reagents to create reactive, unstable organic and inorganic radicals.21 From these data it is possible to apply conditions necessary to generate a reactive species for study. For example, in order to investigate the reduction chemistry of CoIIL62+ the addition of ˙OH scavengers such as tert-butanol (t-BuOH) is essential, since CoIIL62+ reacts very rapidly with the ˙OH radical. Formate (HCO2−) can also scavenge ˙OH to form the CO2 radical, CO2˙−, a strong reducing reagent (eqn (1)). The CO2˙− can also be produced by a reaction of dissolved CO2 with e−aq. While CoIIL62+ can be reduced to CoIL6+ using e−aq, CO2˙− can attach to the metal centre to form CoL6(CO2)+ in addition to producing a small amount of CoIL6+ (Scheme 2). Creutz et al. observed that in the CoIL6+ system (which has found application in both the photoreduction of water to H2, and electroreduction of CO2 to CO), all three adducts CoL6(H)2+, CoL6(CO2)+, and CoIL6(CO)+ are present at equilibrium (on the time scale of seconds), and equilibration is achieved exclusively via dissociation to CoIL6+.22 The KCO2, KCO and KH+ for CoIL6+ will be discussed in Section 3.
 Scheme 2  Reactions of CoIIL62+ with e−aq and CO2˙−, and reactions of CoIL6+ with CO2, CO, and H+, as studied by the pulse radiolysis technique. 
The benefit of pulse radiolysis lies in the fact that it is a simple and clean technique used to generate and study the reactivity of metal macrocycles. While the chemistry behind pulse radiolysis is quite complex, significant quantities of data may be obtained from experiments simply by applying different reaction conditions. Examples of output data include: UV-Vis spectra of transient species and their extinction coefficients, pKa isotherms, binding constants, and reaction rate constants.

2.3. Theoretical
There are a number of quantum chemistry/density functional programs in widespread use, and an even greater variety in the details of how they are used to elucidate the reaction pathways and energetics of molecular catalysis. An explanation of the many levels and methods of theory exceeds the limits of this review. A good starting point is to carry out computations with hybrid density functional methods using, e.g., the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.23 Geometry optimisations and vibrational frequency calculations are required in order to compute the absolute free energy of each species involved in the chemical reaction under study. In the context of metal macrocycles, calculations of all species in a polarisable continuum model of the solution phase (CPCM) seem more reliable than calculations in vacuum. For example, as discussed in Section 4.1, CO2 does not bind to the Ni centre in RSRS-NiL1(CO2)+ in the gas phase, but it does so in a CPCM solvation model of water, probably because the interaction with the dielectric continuum stabilises the charge separation between the Ni centre and the CO2 moiety, while the vacuum does not.
Once the absolute free energies in solution (except for gases) of all relevant species are computed, the problem of calculating standard free energies of reaction, equilibrium (or binding) constants, pKa values, and standard reduction potentials may be addressed (eqn (21)–(26)). The first step is to calculate the standard free energy change for the reaction under consideration. This is given by (21)where  is the calculated absolute free energy of species i with the appropriate standard state (1 atm gas, 1 M in solution, or pure liquid). A species i may be a gas-phase electron (in the case of a reduction half-reaction), a solvated proton (in the cases of a proton-coupled reduction half-reaction or an acid dissociation reaction), or any other species involved in the reaction. Once the  has been determined, the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction, (22)the pKa value for an acid dissociation reaction, (23)or an absolute standard reduction potential, can be computed, (24)where n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is the Faraday constant.
It should be noted that the absolute standard reduction potential so computed does not correspond to the standard convention of electrochemistry which references all reduction potentials to that of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). For consistency, the absolute standard reduction potential of the NHE is computed, H+(s) + e−(g) → (1/2)H2(g)(25) EoNHE,abs = −[½G*(H2(g)) − G*(H(s)+) − G*(e(g)−)]/nF(26)using a calculated value of G*(H2(g)) with n = 1. The resulting standard reduction potential is then Eored vs. NHE = Eored,abs − EoNHE,abs.
The value of Go(e−(g)) = −0.868 kcal mol−124 for the standard free energy of the gas-phase electron and the values G*(H+(s)) = −266.5 kcal mol−1 in MeCN and −272.2 kcal mol−1 in water are recommended in the literature.25–28

        Cobalt tetraazacyclam
        macrocycles


Cobalt ‘cyclam-like’ complexes have been studied as CO2reductioncatalysts for many years. In fact, CoIL6+ and CoIL1+ act as catalysts for the photochemical29–31 and electrochemical29,32reduction of CO2 in aqueous and organic media. Product selectivity is low however, with the complexes producing CO and HCO2− as CO2reduction products, and H2 as a side product. The most studied cobaltmacrocycle is CoIIL62+, which can be isolated in its N-rac and N-meso isomeric forms (Chart 2), each having different spectroscopic characteristics. Equilibration of the two isomers is slow at room temperature (<2 × 10−7 s−1) in organic solvents and in acidic aqueous solutions; equilibration is, however, rapid in alkaline media, where the N-rac isomer is favored at equilibrium.33 While infrared (IR) spectra of the perchlorate salts provide a reliable means of distinguishing the two diastereomers in the solid state, the intensity of the solvent-dependent d–d band in the near-IR (1400–1700 nm) region provides a probe of the isomeric composition in media such as Nujol, DMSO, D2O/H2O, or MeCN. The near-IR band is two to three times more intense for the N-rac than for the N-meso isomer. It is possible to observe isomeric mixtures of the N-rac- and N-meso-CoIL6+ complexes using 1H NMR spectroscopy in CD3CN,17 and at room temperature it was found that the mixture was 85:15 (N-rac:N-meso). Similar ratios were observed for other isomeric ligands such as CoIL4+17 in CD3CN and NiIIL62+ in D2O.34,35 The N-rac isomer also has positional isomers with both five- or six-coordinate geometry as shown in Chart 2. The isomerisation of N-meso-CoIIL62+ to the N-rac isomer is slow but once reduced to the CoI complex, the isomerisation is rapid. In pulse radiolysis investigations of the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 binding, pure isomers of CoIIL62+ were used, however, in many other studies the equilibrium mixtures of CoIIL62+ were utilised.

3.1. Binding of CO2
Gangi and Durand were among the first to report KCO2 for the reversible binding of CO2 to CoIL6+ to form CoL6(CO2)+ using an electrochemical method as discussed in Section 2.1.12 They determined KCO2 to be 7 × 104 M−1 in dry DMSO solution with 0.1 M Et4NClO4 as the supporting electrolyte. Since the KCO2 is relatively large, Fujita, Creutz and coworkers characterised the species in MeCN using UV-Vis, FT-IR, 1H NMR, XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure), laser flash photolysis, and pulse radiolysis.17,19,20,36–39 As mentioned in Section 2.2.1, the KCO2, together with other thermodynamic parameters (i.e., ΔHo and ΔSo) can also be determined spectroscopically using eqn (14), or by heating the solution containing the species and a known amount of CO2 in a closed vessel. However, when a purple solution of CoL6(CO2)+ is cooled, the solution becomes brownish yellow and freezes as a yellow solid. The purple colour returns when the solution is warmed to room temperature. This thermochromism, which is due to the addition of a solvent molecule to five-coordinate CoL6(CO2)+ as shown in eqn (27), was studied in MeCN, butyronitrile (PrCN, Fig. 5), and a CD3CN/THF mixture. CoL6(CO2)+ + Sol ⇌ (Sol)CoL6(CO2)+, KSol(27)
The FT-IR spectra measured over the range 25 to −75 °C in a CD3CN/THF mixture indicate the existence of the six-coordinate species with intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the bound CO2 and the amine hydrogens of the macrocyclic ligand (νCO2 = 1544 cm−l, νNH = 3145 cm−1). The binding of CO2via both its electrophilic centre (carbon atom) and its nucleophilic centres (oxygen atoms) is thus implicated in the stabilisation of the CO2 complex at low temperatures. Also, a dramatic νCO2 shift from 1710 cm−1 to 1544 cm−1 upon cooling is consistent with a significant charge transfer from the CoI centre to the bound CO2. While both five- and six-coordinate CO2 adducts are diamagnetic, six-coordinate CoI complexes are normally high-spin, paramagnetic species. XANES measurements of these CO2 adducts in MeCN were used to identify the oxidation state and coordination geometry of the complex. The cobalt main edge energy in the XANES of the CO2 adduct at room temperature is similar to that of CoIIL62+, indicating that it is a CoIIL6(CO2−)+ complex, having transferred one net electron from the CoIL6+ species to the bound CO2 ligand. However, the XANES of the CO2 adduct at low temperature unambiguously showed a considerable edge shift toward higher energy, suggesting the formation of a CoIII carboxylate, (MeCN)CoIIIL6(CO22−)+, by transferring two electrons from CoI to the bound CO2. Metal carboxylates have been postulated to be important intermediates in photo- and electrochemical CO2reduction and the water gas shift reaction, but this study clearly showed that cobalt(I) macrocycles can transfer two electrons to the bound CO2, and thereby facilitate CO2reduction, avoiding an energetically unfavorable one-electron pathway.

The spectra were taken at 40.0, 23.8, 14.8, 0.0, −9.0, −20.0, −30.5, −40.8, −51.5, −60.2, −73.6, −84.5, and −110.5 °C.

This was a very important result, but it was hard to understand how a closed-shell species could transfer first one and then a second electron from the metal centre to a bound CO2 molecule. The electron donation in CoL6(CO2)+ was investigated with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculations in a CPCM treatment of an MeCN solution with and without an explicit solvent molecule coordinated in the sixth position. The results explain the strange apparent sequential one-electron transfer. The calculated TD-DFT UV-Vis spectra of the five- and six-coordinate CO2 adducts are shown in Fig. 5. The calculated spectrum of the former shows a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition at ca. 480 nm in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed transition at ca. 530 nm. The calculated spectrum for the six-coordinate CO2 adduct exhibits a weaker transition at ca. 440 nm in good agreement with the experimentally observed peak at ca. 430 nm. The observed change in the electronic structure upon coordination by a solvent molecule is thus reflected by the calculations.
As shown in Fig. 6, the electron pair in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the five-coordinate CO2 adduct to CoIL6+, originally in the dz2 orbital of the metal centre, is shared to make a σ-bond between the metal centre and the C atom of the CO2 adduct. Since this is a shared pair of electrons between the Co and the C atom, it represents the transfer of one net electron, in support of the assignment of CoII in the XANES experiments. If CO2 remains bound to the catalyst, then one electron processes are not necessarily high in energy, especially when they correspond to the movement of a pair of electrons.
 Fig. 6  Calculated doubly-occupied highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of five-coordinate CoL6(CO2)+, top, and the calculated C2 symmetry structure of the same view of the complex, bottom. The CO2 adduct is stabilised by hydrogen bonds (distance 1.978 Å) between its two oxygen atoms and the two N–H protons of the L6 ligand. The Co–C bond distance is 1.981 Å and the O–C–O bond angle is 132.43°. Co (light blue), C (gray), H (white), N (blue), O (red). 
In the six-coordinate complex (Fig. 7), this σ-bonding orbital between the Co and the C atom of CO2 becomes HOMO-3, and the new HOMO shows the donation of a second (dxz) pair of electrons from the metal centre, this time to make a π-bond between the Co and the C. This “carbene-like” bonding transfers a second net electron from the Co to the C, resulting in the observed CoIII assignment in the XANES experiments.

The two O–H bond distances decrease to 1.810 Å from 1.978 Å, the Co–C bond distance increases slightly to 2.003 Å from 1.981 Å, and the O–C–O bond angle decreases to 127.37° from 132.43° upon coordination by the solvent. Co (light blue), C (gray), H (white), N (blue), O (red). 
In this manner, i.e., the sharing of two pairs of electrons originally associated with the reduced metal centre between the metal centre and the C atom of the CO2 ligand, we can explain the apparent sequential one-electron transfer from CoI to CO2 in the closed-shell singlet state upon first the binding of the CO2 and then the coordination of a MeCNsolvent molecule. The calculated standard binding free energy of CO2 to CoIL6+ to form the five-coordinate adduct is −5.70 kcal mol−1, yielding a value for KCO2 of 1.5 × 104 atm−1 (or 5.4 × 104 M−1), which is between the values obtained by the electrochemical and spectroscopic methods discussed above.
Let us now discuss more details about CO2 binding constants to CoIL6+. Schmidt et al.16 extended the electrochemical KCO2 measurements in various solvents using pure N-rac-CoIIL62+ and Creutz et al.36 determined KCO2 values of N-rac and N-meso-CoIL6+ in water using pulse radiolysis (Table 1). The KCO2 value of the N-rac-CoIIL62+ isomer is 100 times larger than that of the N-meso-CoIIL62+ isomer in both DMSO and H2O. A weak correlation is found between KCO2 of the N-rac-CoIIL62+ isomer and the solvent dielectric constant,16 and may be attributed to the ‘solvation’ of CO2 in each solvent tried.19 Furthermore, the values in water for both N-rac and N-meso-CoIIL62+ are 1000 times larger than those in MeCN or DMSO, indicating efficient stabilisation by a network of hydrogen bonding between the bound CO2 molecule and free water molecules. The UV-Vis spectrum of N-rac-CoIIL62+ at room temperature also indicates that five- and six-coordinate species exist with a ratio of 1:2,36 in contrast to almost all five-coordinate species in MeCN. It should be noted that the difference in KCO2 values for CoIL5+ and CoIL6+ in MeCN, which have the same reduction potential for CoII/I, is surprisingly large. These results indicate that effective hydrogen-bonding interactions between the bound CO2 and aminemacrocycle N–H protons may serve to additionally stabilise the adduct in some cases, while steric repulsion by methyl groups on the tetradecane ring may destabilise the adducts, depending upon the complex.

Electrochemically, CoIIL22+ and CoIIL32+ show no change when the solution is saturated with CO2, indicating that either the KCO2 < 0.5 M−1 or the forward reaction rate of the complex with CO2 is very small so no chemical reaction takes place. The complexes CoIIL42+, CoIIL52+, and N-meso-CoIIL62+ exhibit behaviour consistent with an electron transfer followed by a chemical reaction, or an ErCr mechanism.41 Under CO2, the reversibility of CoII/I couples for CoIIL42+, CoIIL52+, N-meso-CoIIL62+, and CoIIL72+ is maintained but is shifted to more positive potential. In the case of N-rac-CoIIL62+, CoIIL82+, and CoIIL92+, their CVs are irreversible. This is a result of sufficiently rapid electron transfer and forward reactions, and a slow reverse reaction with large KCO2. However, the cathodic peak current does not change, therefore a catalytic reaction can be ruled out. Interestingly, CoIL6+ was the only complex found to have thermochromic behaviour (i.e., purple at room temperature and yellow at low temperature), but the UV-Vis spectra of CoL7(CO2)+, CoL8(CO2)+ and CoL9(CO2)+ in MeCN indicate that these species are likely solvated six-coordinate CoIII carboxylate species at room temperature, i.e., (MeCN)CoIIIL(CO22−)+. Binding constants increase as the CoII/Ireduction potentials become more negative. Thus charge transfer from CoI to CO2 is an important factor in stabilising these adducts. It should be noted that the binding rate constants, measured by flash photolysis in MeCN:MeOH (5:1 v/v) or by pulse radiolysis in water, increase as the binding constants increase (Table 1). Over a period of a few weeks, CoL6(CO2)+ and (Sol)CoIIIL6(CO22−)+ decomposed to form CoL6(CO)+, CoL62+, and carbonate in dry MeCN under 1 atm CO2. However, when the solution contains proton sources (such as an amine sacrificial donor, water, or methanol), the CO2 adducts decompose rapidly to form free CO. In fact, CoL6+ and CoL1+ act as catalysts for photochemical and electrochemical CO2reduction.37 The spectroscopic evidence for the sequential formation of the photosensitiser radical anion, CoIL6+, CoL6(CO2)+ and (Sol)CoIIIL6(CO22−)+, with the photosensitiser p-terphenyl and triethylamine as the electron donor, was investigated in catalyticCO2reduction systems using flash photolysis in MeCN:MeOH (5:1 v/v).20 The electron-transfer rate constant for the reaction of the p-terphenylradical anion with CoIIL62+ is diffusion controlled because of the large driving force (+1.1 V or ΔG = −1.1 eV). The CO2 binding rate constant 1.7 × l08 M−1 s−1 in MeCN:MeOH (5:1 v/v) is similar to that in H2O obtained by pulse radiolysis. As mentioned in Section 2.2.2, the equilibrium constant 1.1 × 104 M−1 for the binding of CO2 to CoIL6+ obtained by flash photolysis is consistent with that previously obtained by spectroscopic methods in MeCN. Flash photolysis20 and continuous wavelength photolysis30,37 investigations of photocatalytic systems with varying CoImacrocycles identified the factors controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 binding, as well as the photoreduction of CO2 to CO. Steric hindrance and reduction potentials are important factors in the catalytic activity for photochemical CO2reduction. Furthermore, temperature-, solvent-, and CoII/I potential-dependent conversion from CoIL(CO2)+ to (Sol)CoIIIL(CO22−)+via two-electron transfer to the bound CO2 could be of fundamental importance for the proton-coupled reduction of CO2.
Through Na(Hg)reduction of CoIL6+ in MeCN, followed by introduction of CO2, a dinuclear, CO2H–bridged adduct, Co–C(OH)–O–Co, was isolated and its structure was solved (Fig. 8).19,42 The crystal structure in Fig. 8 provided evidence for H-bonding stabilisation between one of the CoL6 moieties, a perchlorate counter anion, and the bridging CO2H. More specifically, H-bonds exist between the amine hydrogens of one of the L6 ligands, namely N(1) and N(8), and one oxygen from the ClO4− and one oxygen from the bridging CO2, namely O(21) and O(1), respectively. There is also a hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of the bridging CO2H and the ClO4− counterion, namely between O(2) and O(21). The isolation of such a complex has implications about the involvement of two cobalt centres in the mechanism of CO2reduction. Meanwhile (Sol)CoIIIL6(CO22−)+ has been postulated as a key intermediate, and the protonation of the bound CO22− has been considered as the next step for CO2reduction. Nevertheless, it has been rather complicated to elucidate the pathway of decomposition of (Sol)CoIIIL6(CO22−)+ or CoIIL6(CO2−)+.20 The isolation of this dimer could be simply due to the low solubility of the species.

Ellipsoids drawn at the 50% probability level, H-atoms omitted for clarity. The dashed lines indicate H-bonds that are thought to stablise the formation and isolation of the dinuclear complex.42 
3.2. Binding of CO

Carbon monoxide is a much better ligand than CO2, and this fact becomes obvious when comparing the equilibrium constants of the CO adducts of the MImacrocycles discussed here. Electrochemistry experiments showed that CO binds reversibly to CoIL2+ and CoIL3+.17 Conversely, CoIIL2+ (L = L4–L9) display well separated, irreversible waves under a CO atmosphere, a process attributed to an ErCi mechanism: rapid reduction followed by rapid CO binding, and then rapid CoI–COoxidation that results in loss of CO. All these CoIL(CO)+ complexes are yellow in colour. Crystals of [CoIL6(CO)]ClO4 were isolated and the structure was solved as shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  The solid state structure of the CoIL6(CO)+ cation, hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity. O1, C1, and Co lie on a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which relates N1 to N8, N4 to N11, etc. The hydrogens (not shown) on N1 and N8 are both on the same side of the ligand, facing the carbon monoxide. The Co–C distance is 1.797 (10) Å. The figure has been reprinted with permission from ref. 43. Copyright 1989 American Chemical Society. 
A large KCO and a low νCO are consistent with strong MI to CO back donation; νCO decreases and KCO increases as CoI becomes a more powerful reductant (Table 2), i.e., CoII/I has a more negative reduction potential.17 The CoI–macrocycle affinity for CO exceeds its affinity for CO2 in MeCN, suggesting that reduction of boundCO2 to boundCO is thermodynamically favourable compared to the reduction of the free substrates. However, in water, KCO2 and KCO are almost the same, indicating water may be a better solvent for CO2reduction, its low solubility notwithstanding. Backbonding with CO and charge transfer to CO2, as well as CO2 stabilisation by N–H bonds of the ligand (Fig. 6–9) are all important factors governing CO and CO2 binding properties of CoILmacrocycles, though these are further complicated by the existence of conformational, positional, and coordination isomers.

3.3. Binding of H+

Cobalt hydride species with cyclam-related macrocycles are difficult to isolate due to their facile reactivity toward oxygen, H+, etc. A pulse radiolysis study in H2O by Creutz et al. examined the equilibration and kinetics of protonation of N-rac and N-meso isomers of CoIL6+ by acid (HA).22,36 The kinetics and thermodynamics for formation of CoL6(H)2+ can be determined using two kinds of reaction pathways with the pulse radiolysis technique (eqn (28), or eqn (29) and (30)). CoIIL62+ + ˙H → CoL6(H)2+(28) CoIIL62+ + eaq− → CoIL6+(29) CoIL6+ + HA → CoL6(H)2+ + A−(30)Three protonated cobalt(I) species, sec-N-rac-CoL(H)2+, N-meso-CoL(H)2+, and primary-N-rac-CoL(H)2+ (whose structures are similar to the CO2 analogues upon replacement of CO2 by H+ in Chart 2), were characterised in a pulse radiolysis study using the following reactions: N-rac-CoIIL62+ + ˙H → sec-N-rac-CoL(H)2+(31) N-meso-CoIIL62+ + ˙H → N-meso-CoL(H)2+(32) N-rac-CoIL6+ + HA → primary-N-rac-CoL(H)2+ + A−(33) N-meso-CoIL6+ + HA → N-meso-CoL(H)2+ + A−(34)
While hydrogen atom addition to both isomers of CoIIL62+ is fast (∼109 M−1 s−1), the rate constants (105–108 M−1 s−1) for the reaction of N-rac-CoIL6+ with proton donors decrease with increasing pKa of the donor acid, consistent with a reaction occurring viaproton transfer.44 The pKa values for N-meso-CoL(H)2+ and primary-N-rac-CoL(H)2+ are reported to be ≥13.9 and 11.4, respectively.36 Interestingly, no insertion of CO2 into the Co–H bond was detected. Rather it was concluded that equilibration among CO2 and hydride complexes of a given isomer proceeds exclusively via formation of the free CoI complex as shown in Scheme 2.

        Nickel tetraazacyclam
        macrocycles


Nickel ‘cyclam-like’ complexes were studied as CO2reductioncatalysts over three decades ago, first by Fisher and Eisenberg32 and later by Sauvage et al.45 Sauvage et al. discovered the selectivity and efficiency of NiIIL12+ as an electrocatalyst to produce CO (as opposed to H2) in aqueous solutions. NiIL1+ is adsorbed on the surface of a Hgworking electrode,46 a process that occurs at potentials more positive than the NiII/I observed in the absence of CO2, a truly remarkable phenomenon that suggests a strong chemical interaction between the molecular complex and the electrode surface.47,48 However, the process is not so trivial, and catalytic activity is affected by the structure of the cylcam ligand,49 as well as its corresponding complex isomers,47,49e.g., the conformational isomers of NiIIL12+ in Chart 3. To date, NiIIL12+ is still the benchmark for other nickel ‘cyclam-like’ catalysts, and since Sauvage's initial reports, there have been only two other complexes that exhibit greater electrocatalytic activity for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO under similar conditions, namely NiIIL132+ and NiIIL152+, reported by Fujita et al.50
 Chart 3  Conformational isomers of NiIIL12+. 
4.1. Binding of CO2
Typically the value of KCO2 for Ni ‘cyclam-like’ complexes is quite low, on the order of 10 M−1 (Table 3). Kelly et al. have carried out a number of experimental studies with NiIL1+ in aqueous solution.51 It was found through pulse radiolysis studies that the yield of NiIL1+ (λmaxabs = 380 nm in UV-Vis spectrum) was dependent on [CO2], with a non-visible-light-absorbing NiL1(CO2)+ adduct being formed via the equilibrium in eqn (35). Some of the binding parameters were determined to be KCO2 = 16 M−1, kf = 3.2 × 107 M−1 s−1, and kr = 2.0 × 106 s−1 with a standard binding free energy (ΔGoaq) for eqn (35) of −1.6 kcal mol−1.51 Whereas for CoL6(CO2)+ there was evidence of charge transfer from CoI to CO2, this was not the case for NiL1(CO2)+, i.e., there was no clear evidence of a NiII or NiIII metal centre. A later study revealed that the yield of NiIL1+ decreased by a second-order decay over a range of [CO2], and this led to the conclusion that in order for the reduction of CO2 to take place, NiL1(CO2)+ had to receive a second electron from another NiIL1+ species.52 The rate constant for this electron transfer was determined to be 1.6 × 108 M−1 s−1 in aqueous solution.52 As with CoL6(CO2)+, the binding of CO2 does not proceed by CO2insertion into a Ni–H bond. Although both Gangi and Fujita attempted to measure KCO2 for NiIL6+, the data could not be obtained by electrochemical methods due to the low binding affinity of CO2 with NiIL6+. (35)
Sakaki investigated the likelihood of CO2 binding to a NiI complex using ab initio calculations.53,54 Modeling NiIIL12+ with NiII(NH3)4F2, he attempted to observe different ‘NiL(CO2)+’ intermediates, where the CO2 was C-bound in an η1 fashion. He found that while the complex NiI(NH3)4(F)0 could coordinate to CO2, complexes of NiI(NH3)4+, NiI(NH3)5+, or NiII(NH3)4(F)+ could not coordinate CO2. It was said that for NiI(NH3)4(F)(CO2)0, the F− pushes up dz2 and neutralises the charge of NiI, thus allowing for strong NiI to CO2 charge transfer and stabilisation. In addition, the F− coordination results in an overall neutral charge of the complex, which decreases charge–dipole repulsion between the nickel complex and CO2. Furthermore, the charge transfer character increases the negative charge on the oxygen atom(s) of CO2, facilitating protonation. The analogous NiI(NH3)4(CO2)+ structure was also proposed, but there is no charge transfer to CO2 in the absence of F−. Sakaki also modeled NiII(NH3)4(F)(CO2)+ as a CO2 adduct, however this complex was thought to be unlikely due to the overall NiII charge causing repulsion of CO2.53

With four asymmetric N-donors, cyclam (L1) has five possible conformational isomers when coordinated to a metal centre (Chart 3).55 Calculations done for this review showed that CO2 binds to RSRS-NiIL1+ in water because of the four N–H protons on the same side of the ligand (Fig. 10), permitting H-bonding stabilisation of the CO2 adduct. A molecule of the solventwater does not coordinate with the metal centre of the CO2 adduct, even when two explicit solventwater molecules are hydrogen bonded to the CO2 in the adduct. Analysis of frontier orbitals shows that a doubly-occupied molecular orbital shares its electron pair in a σ-bond between the Ni and C of CO2; the electron in the singly occupied molecular orbital also contributes to this σ-bond. This is in contrast to the behaviour modeled for CoL6(CO2)+ in Section 3.1.

4.2. Binding of CO

Nickel ‘cyclam-like’ complexes react with CO to give paramagnetic d9 five-coordinate species with square-pyramidal geometry, as was evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)56–58 and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)59spectroscopies. EPR studies by Gagné and Ingle showed that for NiII complexes with α-conjugated macrocyclic ligands (e.g., L2), a ligand radical was formed upon one electron reduction of the complex, giving NiII(L˙−)+, with NiII playing a role in stabilisation.58 In contrast, complexes of ligands without α-conjugation (e.g., L11) showed reduction at the NiII centre to give NiIL+. In either case, NiII(L˙−)+ or NiIL+, both species react with CO to give NiIL(CO)+.57–59 While in its reduced state, NiII(L˙−)+ gave isotropic spectra consistent with a ligand radical species, CO addition resulted in the conversion to an anisotropic species. The conversion was described as being an intramolecular electron transfer process, by which the electron migrated from a ligand orbital to a predominately metal orbital.58 Results from Gagné and Fujita suggested that CO predominately coordinates Ni by a σ-interaction with the metal 4s and 4p orbitals,58,59 an assignment based on the fact that νCO was independent of KCO for the complexes reported.

Fig. 11 illustrates the determination of KCO for NiIIL122+ in MeCN using the method described in Section 2.1. In the left diagram, the CVs show that as the [CO] increases while [Ni] is kept constant, there is a shift in the E1/2red to more positive potentials for the NiII/I couple. The inset shows that the shift in potentials is reversible, i.e., purging the 10% CO/Ar solution with pure Ar results in the original CV for the NiII/IL122+/+ couple. The nature of the difference in the waves with different [CO] could be due to isomers of NiIL12(CO)+, or changes in electron transfer and forward and backward reaction kinetics of the complex with CO (eqn (8)–(10)). The right diagram shows a plot of the E1/2redvs.ln[CO] at two different scan rates, 20 and 50 mV s−1, and KCO has a value of 1.3 × 105 M−1, obtained from the least-squares line-fit. The CO binding constants and stretching frequencies are summarized in Table 4.

Mulazzani, Blinn, and coworkers studied the CO binding properties of NiIIL12+ in aqueous solution using pulse radiolysis and laser flash photolysis techniques.60 The NiIL1+ species absorbs at 380 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum, and the rate of decay of this species was found to increase with increasing [CO] in the range of 0.1–1.0 mM. The decay is followed by the growth of a species having a maximum at 470 nm. The species at 470 nm decays by a first-order process with the concomitant formation of a new species at 350 nm with weak absorption at 630 nm, and is not dependent on [CO]. The new species at 350 nm is quite stable in the presence of O2 or H+. An initial CO addition product of NiIL1+ at 470 nm decays slowly to a product at 350 nm (1.8 s−1). The rather negative ΔS‡ (−14.4 ± 0.1 cal K−1 mol−1) and positive ΔH‡ (12.7 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1) suggest significant solvation and structural reorganisation within the transition state. In other words, the species at 350 nm is not a new CO-adduct, but merely the thermodynamically favored geometric isomer for the five-coordinate NiI–CO adduct.
There is a difference when comparing NiIL6(CO)+ to NiIL1(CO)+, as the former is ‘locked’ in its kinetic isomer while the latter is free to isomerise to the more thermodynamically stable 350 nm-absorbing isomer. The NiIL6(CO)+ has an absorption at ca. 470 nm but does not isomerise further. The shift in absorption maximum from 470 to 350 nm in NiIL1+ could be due to isomerisation of L1, followed by coordination of CO. The kinetic isomer (470 nm) is presumed to be in the RRSS-configuration (Chart 3), while the thermodynamic isomer (350 nm) is thought to be in the RSRS-configuration (Chart 3). This observation is in support of the calculations that show that CO2 will only bind to the RSRS-configuration of NiIL1+ (Fig. 10).
Other methods have been used to characterise the NiIL(CO)+ adducts. Fig. 12 exemplifies reduction of NiIIL132+ by Na(Hg) in MeCN solution as characterised by UV-Vis spectroscopy, ultimately forming NiIL13+. When CO is introduced into the bulk solution containing NiI(L13)+, a CO adduct is observed. XANES and EXAFS are useful techniques to establish unambiguously the ligation geometry around Ni. The absorption intensity correlates directly with the coordination number when Ni is four-, five-, or six-coordinate. A study of NiII, NiI, and NiI–CO complexes of L2, L5, and L6 by Fujita and coworkers examined such coordination characteristics.59 They found that for NiIIL22+ the coordination number was solvent dependent—six-coordinate in MeCN and four-coordinate in nitromethane. Upon reduction of NiIIL22+ the ligand radical species was four-coordinate, and when CO was introduced, a complex mixture developed that included the NiII(L˙−)+ monomer and dimer, as well as NiIL2(CO)+. Complexes NiIIL52+ and NiIIL62+ were four-coordinate square planar, as were their NiIL5+ and NiIL6+ reduced complexes. When CO was introduced, a five-coordinate species was characterised, with the Ni–C distances in NiIL1(CO)+ and NiIL2(CO)+ being short, ca. 1.8 Å.

4.3. Binding of H+
It should be noted that in general, the nickel ‘cyclam-like’ complexes are not efficient catalysts for the reduction of H+ to H2, even in the absence of dissolved CO2. Thus, it is thought that a CO2 mechanism may not proceed via a Ni–H intermediate. In any case, the binding of H+ to NiI may be determined experimentally.
The kinetics and thermodynamics of H+ binding to NiIL1+ in aqueous solution was studied by the pulse radiolysis technique.51 It was found that the reduction of NiIIL12+ by ˙H goes through an inner-sphere mechanism to give NiL1(H)2+, with a rate constant on the order of 109 M−1 s−1. The transient ‘hydride’ species decomposes to NiIL1+ and H+ at a much slower rate, with kf = 3 × 107 M−1 s−1 and kr = 5 × 105 s−1. The binding free energy for eqn (36) was determined to be −2.4 kcal mol−1. Interestingly, there is a pH dependent yield of NiIL1+, where the absorbance at 380 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum corresponding to NiIL1+ decreases with decreasing pH. The data give an isotherm suggesting an equilibrium reaction as shown in eqn (36), and the acid dissociation equilibrium constant for NiL1(H)2+ was determined to be 0.017 M (pKa 1.8).51 When applied to different Ni ‘cyclam-like’ derivatives, similar isotherms are obtained. Pulse radiolysis methods result in a hydrated electron being converted to ˙H at low pH and therefore an inner-sphere mechanism results before the equilibrium reaction. However, addition of ˙H approaches a diffusion-controlled limit and can become quite complicated. (36)
Kelly et al. also studied H+reduction by NiIL1+ and found that NiL1(H)2+ is reduced by another NiIL1+ to form NiL1(H)+ and NiIIL12+.52 This evidence suggests that binding of H+ to NiIL1+ is not sufficient to drive the two-electron reduction of H+ to H2 and NiIIIL13+. The mechanism by which the second electron is provided to NiL1(H)2+ by NiIL1+ was proposed to occur either by an outer- or an inner-sphere reduction, following a pathway similar to that of CO2reduction by NiIL1+. For the former mechanism it was suggested that NiL1(H)+ undergoes protonation followed by decomposition to yield H2 and NiIIL12+. Protonreductionvia an inner-sphere mechanism was proposed to occur through a proton-bridged [(L1)Ni–H–Ni(L1)]3+ intermediate that undergoes simple protonation/decomposition to give H2 and NiIIL12+.
5. Comparison of Co and Nimacrocycles
In general terms, it is true that complexes of CoIL+ form more stable adducts with CO2 and H+ than do the NiIL+ analogues. In fact, the standard binding free energies of CoIL6+ and NiIL1+ for binding with CO2 and H+ differ by a factor of ten.51 While they cannot be compared directly because of two different ligands, the charge transfer stabilisation observed in the CoL(S)+ (S = substrate) complexes seems to be absent in the analogous nickel complexes. XANES data unambiguously show evidence for charge transfer in CoIL(CO2)+ complexes, to give CoIIL(CO2−)+ and, upon cooling, (Sol)CoIIIL(CO22−)+ (Sol = solvent), one- and two-electron transfer products from CoI to bound CO2, respectively. This experimental evidence is further supported through DFT calculations which showed σ- and π-interactions between Co and CO2 in the HOMOs of the one- and two-electron transfer products, respectively. On the other hand, NiIL(CO2)+ complexes do not seem to enter into the same sort of charge transfer interaction of NiI bound to CO2. Rather, only a σ-bond interaction is calculated to be present in the Ni–CO2 adduct. The difference in the stability between the two types of metal macrocycles, cobalt and nickel, has been attributed to differences in the MIII/II couple, as opposed to the MII/I couple,51 for which the potentials differ significantly between the two metals.
What has also become clear is that geometric isomers play a crucial role in substrate binding for both cobalt and nickelmacrocycles. Although not discussed in great detail, it turns out that different configurations of the macrocycle ligand affect catalytic activity as well.50 Even with the simplest NiIL1+ complex, the RSRS-configuration is the active isomer, presenting a certain non-trivial aspect to these sort of ‘cyclam-like’ macrocyclic complexes, an aspect that is not immediately apparent when one looks at a two-dimensional drawing of the complexes.
Finally, what remains interesting (and not well understood) is that the nickel ‘cyclam-like’ complexes are better, more selective CO2reductioncatalysts in aqueous solution. They operate at a wide pH range and maintain selectivity, producing CO as opposed to H2 even at low pH. This phenomenon has been attributed to the difference in KS between the two substrates.51 For example, the NiIL1+ species only reacts with H+ at very low pH (pKa of NiL1(H)2+ < 2) so that addition of a proton cannot compete with CO2 addition in a CO2 saturated solution, thus allowing for the proton-assisted reduction of CO2 to CO. Conversely, CoL(H)2+ complexes are extremely sensitive to oxygen and H+, thereby making them more suited for protonreduction to H2.
6. Future prospects
There has been resurgence in the many subfields of artificial photosynthesis in recent years, and at the heart of that is the catalytic conversion of sunlight into a sustainable energy source such as solar fuels. Molecular catalysts like the cobalt and nickel ‘cyclam-like’ complexes that are the subject of this review will receive a great deal of attention in the coming years. They contain inexpensive, earth-abundant metals that can activate CO2 in electro- and photocatalytic systems.
