Introduction
Efficient light energy conversion over a wide range of wavelengths is essential for solar conversion technologies that might lead to a sustainable society. Wide band gap semiconductor electrodes, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) are considered to be promising candidate systems.1 At a semiconductor electrode, holes and electrons are excited by light to drive various types of chemical reactions including multi-electron transfer. However, due to their wide band gap energy, TiO2 electrodes do not have any photo response in the visible region. To date, several strategies, such as dye-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells, have been proposed to overcome this limitation.2,3 In addition, it has been reported that the combination of specific metal nanostructures that excite the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) with semiconductor electrodes can broaden the photo response to the visible wavelength regions.4–6 These systems are recognized as plasmonic photo conversion systems. LSPR is a resonant photon-induced oscillation of free electrons.7,8 To date, there have been various proposals for accelerating photo conversion and chemical reactions based on LSPR excitations.9–11 Several ideas, such as field-enhanced energy transfer, photothermal heating, and electron–hole pair formation have been considered as potential mechanisms for the LSPR-enhanced chemical reactions.12–14 With regard to electron–hole pair formation, holes and electrons are excited under light illumination with a specific wavelength during the decay process of LSPR.15 When the plasmonic structures are supported on an n-type semiconductor electrode, the excited electrons in the metal nano-structure are injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor, whereas holes are consumed by oxidation reactions.16 In this system, the LSPR conversion system induces a water oxidation reaction under low energy photon illumination.17 The incident photon-to-current efficiency spectrum agrees well with the light absorption characteristics of the plasmonic structure, indicating the occurrence of plasmon-induced multi-electron transfer reactions. Recently, various plasmonic photo conversion systems have been established and applied to various visible-light induced multi electron transfer reactions, including water splitting reactions.18,19 Hence, plasmonic conversion systems have drawn considerable attention in the field of photochemistry.
The optical character of a plasmonic nanostructure is strongly influenced by its shape, size, and the metal species; thus, by controlling these features, it is possible to achieve efficient conversion of light energy.20–23 For example, when two nano particles are separated by less than 10 nm, a much stronger optical field enhancement of up to ∼105 can be generated within the gap.24 This strong optical field is often applied in analytical measurements, such as surface enhanced-Raman scattering observations.25 In addition to these structures, rod structures have a unique photoresponse character. Longitudinal and transverse modes can be observed from rod structures, depending on the light polarization direction; i.e., parallel and/or vertical to the long axis of the rod structure.26 Particularly for rods with an approximate length of 100 nm, reflection at either end of the propagating surface plasmon can excite higher order plasmon modes under polarized illumination parallel to the long axis.27 To date, several approaches, such as scanning near-field optical microscopy and the use of polymer materials, have been attempted to map the near-field intensity distribution.27–30
In order to achieve a highly efficient plasmonic photo conversion system, an understanding of charge transfer processes and the dependence of reaction active sites on the plasmonic character is required.31–33 In a previous study, we visualized the spatial distribution of reaction active sites for a plasmon-induced reaction by electrochemical polymerization of a conductive polymer.34 The conductive polymer selectively deposited at locations where the optical field was generated. Importantly, the absolute potential value for the generated holes can be estimated from the incident photon energy, redox potential of pyrrole, and the flat band potential of TiO2 under the control of electrochemical potential of the systems. Moreover, hole trapping sites formed at the metal/TiO2 interface play an important role in plasmon-induced chemical reactions. In this study, we investigated how the spatial distribution of reaction active sites depends on the plasmonic modes. To this end, we prepared various metal nano-structures by electron beam lithography. Through the use of well-defined structures, it is possible to precisely define the plasmonic optical properties and gain insight into the nature of the reactions and their dependence on the plasmon modes. In addition, by a combination of Raman measurements, we attempted to clarify the relationship between the reaction efficiency and higher order modes.
Experimental
Preparation of random Au/TiO2 electrode
Atomically smooth single crystalline TiO2 (110) (10 × 10 × 0.5 mm3; rutile, 0.05 wt% niobium doped; Furuuchi Chemical Co.) was immersed into 20% HF solution for 10 min, followed by rinsing with water and drying under nitrogen flow. To fabricate plasmon-active Au nano-island structures (random Au/TiO2), a 10 nm Au layer was prepared by electron beam evaporation onto the TiO2 surface at a deposition rate of 0.2 nm s−1 followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.
Electron beam lithography was also used to fabricate well-defined Au structures. The resist solution (ZEP:ZEPA = 2:1) was dropped onto the substrate and spun at 4000 rpm for 60 sec. By heating the substrate at 150 °C for 3 min, a resist layer with a thickness of approximately 200 nm was obtained. The resist coated TiO2 substrate was introduced into the EB irradiation equipment. The EB was irradiated following a CAD design with a dose of 400 μC cm−2 and a beam current of 50 pA. After EB drawing, the substrate was rinsed with ZED – N50 and ZED – B to remove the resist.
Plasmon-induced oxidative polymerization of pyrrole
Photocurrent measurements with Au/TiO2 were performed with a commercial potentiostat and potential programmer (HZ-5000; Hokuto Denko) with the use of Pt wire and Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 + 0.01 M AgNO3) electrodes as the counter and the reference electrodes, respectively. Under illumination by near-infrared laser light [λex = 785 nm (1.58 eV), Iex = 1 mW), in 0.1 M NaClO4 acetonitrile solution containing polymerizable monomers (pyrrole, thiophene, 2,2′-bithiophene (BT), 3-methylthiophene (MT), 3-dodecylthiophene (DT), or 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT))], which were purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. and Wako (Japan). All electrochemical potentials in the present article are described with vs. Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile. The plasmon-induced oxidative polymerization of the monomer was performed with a confocal Raman microscope (×100 objective lens, spot diameter of ca. 3 μm). The structures deposited on the surface were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JSM-6700FT; JEOL Ltd).
Results and discussion
Polymerization of various monomers on Au/TiO2 electrode
As reported in a previous study, we performed the plasmon induced oxidative polymerization of pyrrole under infrared laser illumination.34 In that report, the values for the flat band potential of n-TiO2 (φfb = −0.68 V),35 the energy of illuminated light (1.58 eV), the absolute electrochemical potential for generated holes (φhole) were estimated as φhole = 1.58–0.68 = 0.9 V. The fast recombination rate of the carrier relaxation,36 suggests that excited holes were trapped at the metal–semiconductor interface, corresponding to reaction active sites with an electrochemical potential more positive than 0.9 V. To confirm this value, we performed plasmon-induced polymerization reactions with different types of monomer molecules. The oxidation potential for each monomer was determined from the onset potential of the anodic peak in electrochemical measurements, as can be found in the ESI.† The estimated oxidative potentials of pyrrole, BT, EDOT, DT, MT, and thiophene are 0.68, 0.81, 0.93, 1.28, 1.37, and 1.40 V, respectively. These values are comparable with those in previous reports.37–39Fig. 1 shows SEM images of the surface of the random-Au/TiO2 electrode immersed in the acetonitrile solution containing pyrrole, BT, and EDOT (Fig. 1a–c) obtained after illumination by infrared light. The illumination times correspond to 10, 100, and 300 s from left to right. The red circles indicate the laser illumination spots. In Fig. 1a and b, deposited polymer originating from pyrrole and BT monomers can be clearly observed. An increase in the deposited amount was also confirmed by increasing the illumination time. In this system, the polymerization reactions proceeded by hole transport in the deposited polymers. Thus, the large amount of deposited BT reflects the higher conductivity of BT compared with that of pyrrole.40 In addition, we also confirmed the polymerization of EDOT; however the amount of deposition was quite small even after illumination for 300 s (Fig. 1c). This result reflects the relatively low reaction yield owing to the lower overpotential. Conversely, in the case of DT, MT, and thiophene monomers, no deposits were observed even after exposure for long times (data not shown). Considering the oxidative potential values for each monomer estimated from electrochemical measurements, the electrochemical potential of the active sites is located at a potential more positive than 1.0 V, as predicted above. Hence, the reason for a lack of deposition of poly-DT, -MT, and -thiophene is that their redox potentials are more positive than that of the generated holes. It should be noted that this potential dependence could exclude the temperature elevation on the plasmonic structure surface. This could be also supported by our previous paper. According to our previous paper, the temperature elevation under the current condition would be up to around 40 degree.41 Thus, the temperature effect could be negligible in the current case. Therefore, we construct a schematic energy diagram for the present plasmon-induced charge transfer process against the electrochemical potential value, as shown in Fig. 1d. A similar discussion of the oxidative character of the system in other reports also supports our proposed mechanism.42 Therefore, through the use of various monomers, we confirmed the value for the electrochemical potential of generated holes in our previous report. An important point in our proposal is that active reaction sites are highly localized with excited holes whose electrochemical potentials are much more positive than the Fermi level of gold. This finding suggests potential for improvements in the design of the reaction system. Additionally, based on the mechanism as in Fig. 1d, it could be expected that the smaller nanoparticles (less than 100 nm) would lead to the higher reaction efficiency due to the relatively higher absorption cross section.21

Spatial distribution of reaction active sites on well-defined plasmonic structures
To gain a deeper understanding of the plasmon-induced chemical reactions, we examined the plasmon-induced oxidation of pyrrole monomer by well-defined plasmon modes. Well-defined nanostructures, such as disk and bow-tie structures, were prepared on the n-TiO2 surface by electron beam lithography. The electric field within the spatially distributions is excited in the vicinity of such structures depending on the polarization direction of the incident light.43,44 The bow-tie structures generate a very strong optical field at the gap between two triangles and at each corner under polarized light illumination parallel (longitudinal) or vertical (transverse) to the long axis of the bow tie structure, respectively.44Fig. 2a–c shows SEM images of the deposited polypyrrole formed by the plasmon induced oxidation reaction at each structure under polarized light illumination. The direction of the polarized light is indicated by double-headed arrows. According to the previous report, the plasmon resonance wavelength could be expected to appeare at around 800 nm, corresponding to the incident laser wavelength.44 We observed a site selective tendency for each structure depending on the direction of light polarization. For the case of polarized light illumination onto the disk structure, deposits were located along the polarization direction (Fig. 2a). Conversely, as in Fig. 2b and c, the polymer mainly deposited at the gap whereas deposits were observed outside the corners of each triangle under parallelly and vertically polarized light illumination, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the theoretically estimated distributions for the generated strong optical field. Therefore, plasmon-induced chemical reactions tend to take place at regions of strong electric field, which is consistent with results from our previous work.34 Hence, the spatial distribution indicates that excited holes are selectively trapped at regions with a strong optical field, resulting in efficient multiple charge transfer reactions.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) nanodisk and (b and c) bow-tie structures after illumination in 1 mM pyrrole + 0.1 M NaClO4 acetonitrile solution. Applied electrode potential was 0.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Incident laser wavelength and light intensity were 785 nm and 0.1 mW, respectively. Single and double-headed arrows in each image indicate the deposited polymer and polarization direction of incident light, respectively. (d) In situ Raman spectra of Au bow-tie structures on TiO2 electrode and (e) time-series Raman intensity at 932 cm−1. Polarization directions of the laser were (black) parallel and (gray) perpendicular to the long axis of the bow-tie structure. 
To characterize the deposits, we performed in situ Raman measurements during light illumination. The Raman spectra in Fig. 2d and e were acquired with polarized incident light (black) parallel and (gray) vertical to the long axis, respectively. Both spectra had similar Raman bands, indicating that the chemical character of the deposits is independent on the incident polarized light direction. The Raman bands at 932 and 1600 cm−1 are assigned to C–H, and CC stretching of polypyrrole.45 From the representative Raman bands, the deposits in both Fig. 2b and c were polypyrrole formed in the plasmon-induced oxidation reaction.
In Fig. 2e, the Raman band intensities at 932 cm−1 are plotted as a function of the laser exposure time. The black and gray plots correspond to the longitudinal and transverse directions as in Fig. 2d. A time-dependent change in the Raman band intensity was observed in both cases. Over the first 10 s, the Raman band intensities almost saturated. Notably, the intensities for the phonon-bands of TiO2 (Eg, A1g) were stable during measurements. Hence, changes in the Raman band intensity at 932 cm−1 originated from growth of polypyrrole. Incidentally, the intensity of the Raman band gradually decreased with increasing laser exposure time in both cases. In the present system, the intensity of the Raman band was enhanced by the strong exciting electric field. As the amount of deposition increased, the resonance energy of the plasmon was modified by the change in the dielectric constant of the surrounding metal nanostructures, leading to a mismatch of the Raman excitation. The change in the coverage of the polymer decreased the Raman band intensity. Clearly, the Raman band intensities in the longitudinal direction were stronger than those in the transverse direction. In terms of the plasmon resonance wavelength for Au bow-tie structures, the resonance wavelength strongly depends on the polarization direction; the longitudinal mode has a longer resonance wavelength. According to previous reports, the plasmon resonance for the present Au nano bow-tie structure on TiO2 can be predicted to appear at approximately 800 and 700 cm−1 for the longitudinal and transverse modes, respectively.46 Therefore, we expect that the differences in scattering intensity originate from the relationship between the plasmon resonance wavelength and the incident laser wavelength. Consequently, we used Raman measurements to investigate the dependence of the reaction process on the excited plasmon mode. In addition, by considering the dependence of the Raman scattering intensity on the plasmon modes, it may be possible to discuss the reaction efficiency of distinct plasmon modes.
Investigation of plasmon-induced oxidation reactions of higher order plasmon modes
To discuss the dependence of the reaction characteristics on the plasmon modes, we prepared Au nano rod structures with various aspect ratios. The short side was set to be 50 nm and the rod length was varied from 50 to 1000 nm. As mentioned in the introduction section, nanorod structures had multipole modes (higher order, mode index number: n = 2, 3, 4, and more) under illumination by longitudinal mode polarized light. This effect results from propagation of light within the rod structure. The number of oscillations, corresponding to the mode index increases as the rod is made longer. The resonance of higher order modes shifts to longer wavelengths as the mode index increases.29Fig. 3 shows SEM images of rods with lengths of 75, 300, 550, and 750 nm obtained after infrared laser illumination of a solution containing the pyrrole monomer. The polarization direction of the incident light is parallel to the long axis as indicated by the double-headed arrows. We confirmed that each rod structure had a distinct spatial distribution of the deposits. Furthermore, deposition of the polypyrrole was apparent but the amounts of deposition on each structure were different. In the case of longer rods, the deposition was relatively small compared with that of the shorter rods. These results indicate that a lower mode index gives a higher reaction yield. Previous reports have found that the strength of the optical field for a low mode index has a much stronger field intensity than that for higher modes.26 Our finite-difference time-domain calculations also reproduced this result (see in ESI†). Therefore, the difference in the amount of deposition originates from the different strengths of the plasmonic field depending on the excited mode. Additionally, in the case of a transverse mode, we confirmed deposition of the polymer and independence of the rod length, as in Fig. S3.† This result is also in good agreement with the character of the transverse mode.47
 Fig. 3  SEM images of Au nanorods after irradiation with 0.1 mW of 785 nm laser. Rod lengths and irradiation times were respectively (a) 75 nm, 5 s; (b) 300 nm, 10 s; (c) 550 nm, 10 s; and (d) 750 nm, 10 s. Laser irradiation was conducted in 1 mM pyrrole + 0.1 M NaClO4 acetonitrile solution at a static potential of 0.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Double-headed arrows shown in each image indicate the polarization direction of incident light. 
Following the above results, we examined the relationship between the Raman intensity of the polypyrrole and the rod length. To this end, we prepared rod structures that had various lengths ranging from 10 to 1000 nm and performed in situ Raman measurements during the polymerization reactions. We also prepared ten structures with exactly same rod length to confirm the reproducibility. The Raman intensities at 932 cm−1 were plotted as a function of the rod length (upper of Fig. 4). Specific rod lengths (i.e., 75 and 300 nm) showed the relatively stronger Raman intensities. Thus, we expected that the reaction efficiency depends on the excited multipole plasmon mode in (Fig. 3b and c). Perpendicular incident illumination to the substrate excites only odd modes.26 Therefore, rod lengths of 75 and 300 nm can be defined as n = 1, and 3, respectively. Moreover, considering the deposition of the polypyrrole on the rods with lengths of 550 and 750 nm, each length can be assigned to n = 5 and 7, respectively. A similar tendency for a periodic change in the near-field intensity depending on the rod length has been demonstrated in both experimental and theoretical investigations.29 Thus, a plasmon-induced charge transfer reaction was preferentially triggered by the higher order plasmon mode. The relatively weak Raman intensity and small deposition amounts for the cases of n = 5 and 7 resulted from multipolar plasmons with higher index values that weakly interacted with the incident light, leading to weak resonance.26 To analyse these results in detail, we have also plotted the enhancement factor (|E|4) of the Raman scattering on Au rods with lengths of 75, 300, 550, and 750 nm estimated from finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations (SI).48 Each plot was calculated from the highest intensity value at the edge of the rod structure. The plots show that the enhancement factor for n = 1 is much higher than those for other indexes because of the strong electric field intensity. However, the Raman intensity of n = 3 was larger than expected from the enhancement factor. This result confirms that the efficiency of the plasmon induced oxidation reaction does not directly correlate with the electric field intensity. Thus, we conclude that we have firstly visualized a qualitative relationship for plasmon-induced charge transfer reaction depending on the multipolar modes through Raman measurements.

Raman spectra corresponding to each plot were collected with the laser exposure time of 10 s. Black and red plots are Raman intensity and average value. Plasmon mode index estimated from Fig. 3 is indicated as the colored region. (bottom) Correlation between λp and λex for each mode index as a function of rod length. 
According to previous reports, it is possible to describe the linear relationship of rod length (L) as a function of the resonance order as follows:29L(n) (nm) = 1/2λpn (nm)+a (nm)where a is a constant value that depends on the shape of each rod end. The parameter λp is the resonance wavelength of the electron oscillation with a distinct morphology. On the basis of the above equation and the experimental result that n = 1, 3, 5, and 7 are 75, 300, 550, and 750 nm, respectively, the values of λp and a are estimated to be 225 nm and −37.5, respectively. Thus, our Raman measurements could be used to estimate λp under 785 nm laser illumination without any theoretical methods. From this estimation and the assumption that all structures have the same edge structure, it is possible to describe the relationship between λp on each rod length and the excitation wavelength (λex), as illustrated in the bottom of Fig. 4. The cases of n = 1 and 3 have much steeper slopes than those of n = 5 and 7. These tendencies are in good agreement with previously reported experimental results.26 From the above results, even higher order plasmon modes can be visualized and a reliable estimate of the plasmon resonance wavelength dependence on the rod length is possible by our present technique. Through these investigations we obtained detailed information about the active reaction sites, absolute potential values for active reaction species, and the reaction efficiency for each plasmon mode.
Conclusions
Here, we successfully visualized active reaction sites for plasmon-induced chemical reactions. The reaction active sites and the absolute electrochemical potential values for generated holes were revealed with the use of various polymerizable monomers. The well-defined structures revealed the dependence of the reaction efficiency on the generated strong optical field. More importantly, it was possible to estimate the relationship between the plasmon resonance wavelength for higher order plasmon modes and rods thorough in situ Raman scattering observations. Thus, the design of the metal nano structures has an important influence on the improvement of plasmonic conversion systems. Although further detailed theoretical and experimental studies are required, we have established guidelines to effectively control plasmon-induced reactions for applications in future optical devices.
