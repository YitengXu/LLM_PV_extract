Inspired by the chemistry of halogen bonding, we introduce an effective processing strategy using diiodoperfluoroalkyl and diiodoalkyl additives to modulate the crystallization, traps and resultant photophysical processes in methylammonium halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite solar cells that can reach a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20% associated with a negligible hysteresis with a compact TiO2 based planar structure. Aided by combinatorial analyses with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and density functional theory calculation, we ascribe the achieved modulation of the crystallization in CH3NH3PbI3 to the formation of halogen bonding between the iodine in the additives and halide anions in perovskite precursor solutions. Benefitting from the modification with additives, the resultant solar cells exhibit a decrease in Shockley–Read–Hall recombination due to the suppressed charge trapping which explains the improvement of PCE. Our solar cells processed with additives also show retardation of degradation with a considerably enhanced environmental stability. This work offers a promising route through additive management to achieve high performance and stable perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
In the last couple of years, solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite polycrystallites have experienced a skyrocketing increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which enables their applications in generating electricity with low-temperature processes and earth-abundant materials.1–7 These emerging photo-absorbers are associated with low exciton binding energies (20–30 meV),8,9 high charge carrier mobility,10,11 long carrier diffusion distances, and non-excitonic charge generation with low recombination rates.5,12–14 Such features have led to state-of-the art perovskite solar cells with certified PCEs over 22%.7 The widely used processing route for perovskite crystallization in the laboratory adopts solution-processing. By this means, non-negligible levels of defects can be created in the resultant thin films. It has been evidenced that the present defects or traps can critically impair the photovoltaic behavior and electrical stability of perovskite solar cells.15 To this end, attaining control over the crystallographic growth kinetics for perovskite films toward lower trap densities has become a central topic to fully reach the potential of these materials for high performances.16–19
To date, there have been documented methodologies allowing for improvements in the quality of polycrystalline perovskite films, including the optimization of the spin procedure,20,21 introduction of additives,22,23 or surface treatments,24,25 leading to advances in understanding the defect chemistry and crystallization for perovskites. The application of solvent additives has been proven with great versatility to modulate the perovskite film formation and resultant photovoltaic behaviours. For example, by using a coordination additive of dimethyl sulfoxide, the kinetics of crystal growth was meliorated with enlarged grain sizes.26,27 With incorporating bidentate halogenated additives based on 1,8-diiodooctane, a temporary chelation with Pb2+ in the PbI2 solution was enabled, leading to retardation of the crystallization with improved homogeneity of nucleation.16 Moreover, a promising route involving acidic additives was demonstrated to mediate the perovskite film formation with catalytic effects.28–30 Very recently, new insights into the chemical reaction with defects in perovskite films were obtained through CH3NH2 additives to promote the dissociation of polyiodide colloids to realize reduced charge trapping.31
In halide perovskite solution, the iodine anions serving as a Lewis base can strongly interact with halogenated organic molecules via noncovalent interactions, leading to halogen bonding (HB). As an analogue to the better-known hydrogen bonding, HB was unequivocally demonstrated by Hassel in his Nobel lecture in 1970 and has shown great potential in crystal engineering and biological assays.32–35 More relevant to perovskites, Snaith et al. made use of a supramolecular strategy based on HB to passivate under-coordinated iodine ions at the perovskite surface.36 However, there have been rare examples concerning the effects of halogen bonding during the crystallization process for perovskites so far. A fundamental question is asked: how does the introduction of HB into the perovskite precursor solution impact the crystallographic growth kinetics and ultimate photovoltaic device behaviours?
In this contribution, we report a facile and effective processing strategy using diiodoperfluoroalkyl additives of 1,4-diiodooctafluorobutane (C4F8I2) along with non-fluorinated 1,4-diodobutane C4H8I2 (see their chemical structures in Fig. 1a) to modulate the crystallization and photovoltaic characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. We achieve boosted power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 20.1% with inhibited hysteresis using a compact TiO2 based planar architecture. The enhanced PCE is ascribed to the meliorated crystallization in the presence of iodine–iodine interactions (or HB) induced by the additives, confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. These modifications are associated with a shrinkage of colloidal sizes in precursor solutions and improved stoichiometry in solid films, leading to perovskite films featuring fewer traps and a compact and pinhole-free morphology. By transient photocurrent/photovoltage measurements, we found that the CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells with additive modification can have an expedited charge sweep-out with mitigated recombination losses, which explains the enhanced device performance. Beneficially, the described strategy also enables retardation of degradation in our perovskite solar cells with an enhanced environmental stability. Under the optimal condition, the device can maintain ∼80% of the initial PCE after more than 2 months of storage in an ambient environment.

Results and discussion
Analogies between the halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding are often compared: the partially positively charged halogen atoms (Lewis acid) can serve as the halogen bond donor and the negatively charged Lewis base can function as the halogen bond acceptor. To assess the formation of HB in the presence of additives during the crystallization of perovskites, firstly, we calculated Mulliken charges (MCs) around the two iodine atoms in the utilized additives of C4H8I2 and C4F8I2 by DFT calculation. The MCs were found to be +0.097 (with the unit of elementary charge) in C4H8I2 and +0.329 in C4F8I2 (see the results in Fig. 1a). These positively charged iodine atoms in additives can interact attractively with those iodine anions in the perovskite precursor solution. We further compared the strength of HB in terms of the relevant bond length. Since the volume of iodine anions is much larger than that of additives in the precursor solution, there tend to be two HBs formed by iodine at the two ends of the additive molecule (see formation of HB illustrated by dashed lines in Fig. 1b). The more pronounced electron deficiency of the iodine atoms in C4F8I2 is explained by the stronger electronegativity of fluorine, which results in higher HB strengths with a shorter bond length of 3.47 Å, revealed by DFT calculation. In contrast, a larger length of 3.74 Å was found in C4H8I2 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). These results suggest that the strength of HB can be simply tuned by the side atoms of additives with different electronegativities.
The formation of HB in our perovskite precursor solutions with additives is further confirmed by NMR spectroscopy which is the most widely used technique for studying the HB in the solution phase. Fig. 1c shows the chemical shifts of 19F NMR for pristine C4F8I2 and C4F8I2 added solutions of PbI2, CH3NH3I, and mixed PbI2/CH3NH3I in DMF/DMSO mixed solvents. All the concentrations were kept the same as the conditions used to prepare the solar cells except that the DMSO solvent was replaced by DMSO-6d. The signal of the fluorine atoms (F1/2/7/8) connected to the iodine-bearing carbons (C1 and C4) at ϕ 67.98 ppm exhibited an upfield shift of 2.21, 5.20, 3.68 ppm in PbI2,36 CH3NH3I, and mixed PbI2/CH3NH3I, respectively, while the signal of F3/4/5/6 at ϕ 112.96 ppm presented upfield shifts of 0.36, 0.78, and 0.61 ppm in these three solutions. The more pronounced chemical shifts for F1/2/7/8 are in agreement with our DFT calculation confirming that the electronegativity of F1/2/7/8 is larger than that of F3/4/5/6 after forming the HB (see Fig. S1†). The 19F NMR spectra provide strong evidence that C4F8I2 can interact with iodine anions via HB in the perovskite precursor solution.37
In the case of C4H8I2, we utilized 1H NMR spectra to record the chemical shifts in pristine C4H8I2 and the three solutions with C4H8I2 added (see the corresponding NMR in Fig. S2, ESI†). The upfield shifts of hydrogen atoms adopt the same trend as that of fluorine atoms in C4F8I2 but less significantly. This can be due to the lower positivity of iodine atoms with a weaker HB formed in the presence of C4H8I2.
To better understand the role of additives in solid state perovskites, we measured the XPS spectra of the as-spun CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films under different processing conditions. As shown by the high-resolution I 3d spectra in Fig. S3,† visible shifts in the two sub-peaks toward higher binding energy (BE) are observed in the C4F8I2 processed film. The upward shift of BE may be linked to the presence of positively charged iodine in the fluorinated additives (Fig. S1, ESI†). In contrast, the BE shift induced by non-fluorinated C4H8I2 is less pronounced. This trend is in line with the weaker positivity of iodine in C4H8I2. Concerning the presence of under-coordinated halide anions in perovskites (mainly near the surface regime),36,38 iodine–iodine interactions are allowed with the positively charged iodine in the additives, leading to HB. We also examined the BE of Pb 4f (see XPS spectra in Fig. 1b, lower panel) where a more pronounced upward shift with C4F8I2 is observed, showing a similar trend to I 3d. The occurrence of iodine–iodine interactions could partially pull away the electron clouds from Pb, which in turn changes its electronegativity such that the BE increases.39 The XPS results help confirm the formation of iodine-based HB in the as-cast perovskite films involving additives.
In perovskite precursor solutions prepared from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF), there could be the presence of multiple complexes including PbI2–DMSO and CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO (DMF) complexes formed through solvent–solute interactions,16 and intermediate polyiodide complexes of PbI3−, PbI42−, or PbI53−. The latter are generally harmful to the perovskite crystallization due to their varied stoichiometry.40,41 To understand how the additives impact these multiple complexes in our precursor solutions, we examined the colloidal size by DLS measurements.27Fig. 1d shows the histogram of cluster diameters in CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solutions determined by DLS. Without additives, the size distribution features a Gaussian shape showing an average radius of ∼1000 nm, consistent with previous results.42 The radius reduces to 615 nm after adding C4H8I2 and further to 531 nm with C4F8I2. The trimming of colloids in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution can be explained by the suppression of aggregation of polyiodide complexes after adding weak coordination additives.27 Considering that the iodoplumbate complexes (e.g. PbI64−) are generally associated with large colloidal sizes,43 the reduced density of intermediate polyiodide complexes can result in a reduction of the average colloidal size in our perovskite precursor solutions. Mechanistically, the suppressed iodoplumbate complexes can be related to the reduced concentration of iodine anions with the formation of HB.42 Interestingly, the size trimming follows the HB strength tuned by the positivity of iodine in the additives. We further examined the dependence of additive concentration on the shrinkage of clusters (see the results in Fig. S4, ESI†). As shown, the average radius monotonously decreases with increasing amount of additives, due to the increase of positively charged iodine in the additive molecule. As a result, the iodine–iodine interaction tends to become stronger which can assist the suppression of aggregation of complexes.
Upon clarifying the role of additives in the solution of perovskite precursors, we examined the crystallinity in the as-spun CH3NH3PbI3 solid films by XRD and the results are shown in Fig. 1e. The peaks assigned to the primary (110) and (220) planes were found to proportionally increase in the additive-processed films. In contrast, the perovskite without additives displays a rather weak XRD peak for the (110) plane. The different XRD indicates that the crystallization in CH3NH3PbI3 films is aided by the present additives before annealing and this modification is likely attributed to the presence of HB in the precursor solution where the crystallization is initiated. For comparison, we also measured XRD patterns of annealed CH3NH3PbI3 films (see the results in Fig. S5, ESI†). The main (110) XRD peak slightly increases in the additive-processed films. We further examined the surface morphology of the as-spun CH3NH3PbI3 films by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (see SEM images in Fig. S6, ESI†). As shown, polygon-shaped grains associated with visible voids/pinholes (near grain boundaries) are noted in the pristine film. In contrast, the films processed with additives exhibit more compact and homogeneous features with the density of voids substantially reduced. From the top-view SEM images in Fig. 2a, the reduction of the morphological defects with additives is consistently seen in CH3NH3PbI3 films after thermal annealing. A dramatically improved morphology with highly compact and homogeneous features can be achieved when using C4F8I2. The meliorated 3D perovskite solids with a film containing fewer pin-holes could benefit from the enhanced crystallinity at the early stage (before annealing).44

Non-stoichiometry is a common origin for traps in perovskites that hinder the device operation.45 To examine how the meliorated crystallization impacts charge trapping, we performed surface analysis using XPS on annealed CH3NH3PbI3 films. Fig. 2b and c display high-resolution XPS of core levels I 3d and Pb 4f measured on various CH3NH3PbI3 films. Visible shifts in the BE toward lower energy (with respect to the reference sample) are observed on the C4F8I2 processed film while the shift becomes less significant for non-fluorinated C4H8I2. This behavior contrasts with the observed upward shift in the BE of I 3d in the as-spun perovskites, which is mainly due to the presence of C4F8I2 containing the strong electron-pulling fluorine. The surface of annealed perovskite solids is often associated with under-saturated metal ions (e.g. Pb2+), due to dangling bonds. The downward shift of BE in Fig. 2b and c can be explained by the reduced density of Pb ions near the surface area of perovskites, which increases the average electronegativity of Pb and reduces the strength of Pb–I bonds. We further estimated the surface non-stoichiometry based on the ratio of peak intensity of I 3d to that of Pb 4f. The I/Pb ratio was found to be 2.63, 3.13 and 2.96 for pristine, C4H8I2 and C4F8I2 processed films, respectively (see Table S1, ESI†). The I/Pb ratio < 3 can suggest a Pb-rich surface in pristine CH3NH3PbI3 associated with electron traps.45,46 Importantly, the surface stoichiometry is improved by using C4F8I2, with the I/Pb ratio approaching the theoretical value of 3. These results evidence that the surface charge trapping in perovskite films can be effectively mitigated via the suppressed non-stoichiometry with the described additive process.
The reduction of surface traps is expected to weaken the non-radiative Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in perovskites. Fig. 2d shows steady-state PL spectroscopy of different CH3NH3PbI3 films. The PL from the band-to-band optical transition (∼763 nm) is enhanced in the additive-processed films, which can result from the suppressed non-radiative SRH recombination.47 Based on the same set of samples, we further assessed the PL decay kinetics for the emission at ∼763 nm (see the inset of Fig. 2d). The appearance of the two temporal regimes can be correlated with the surface (faster decay) and bulk charge recombination (slower decay).48 From the extracted decay time constants with a bi-exponential decay model (see fitting parameters in Table S2, ESI†), the PL in both temporal regimes is found to be longer lived with additives. This result suggests that charge recombination in both bulk and surface regions may become weakened, which can be primarily ascribed to the meliorated film morphology with fewer structural defects and suppressed surface traps by additives.
With the identified impacts of additives on the perovskite crystallization and photophysical properties, we turned to the photovoltaic characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells that adopted a planar device architecture (see Fig. S7, ESI†). We first screened the concentration dependence of additives on the PCE. Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†) display the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics (in the reverse scan direction) of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells at various concentrations of C4H8I2 and C4F8I2, respectively and the extracted device parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 in the ESI.† We established the optimal additive concentration as 3% (mass ratio), at which the PCE can be boosted to 18.5% with C4H8I2 and further to 20.1% with C4F8I2. Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics (reverse scan) of the best perovskite solar cells under the optimal conditions (3%) with the device parameters compared in Table 1. The gain of PCEs mainly arises from the enhanced short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which can be related to the mitigated carrier losses via recombination modified by additives. Fig. 3b displays the incident photon-to-converted electron (IPCE) efficiency. The Jsc extracted from the integration of IPCE spectra is consistent with the values determined from the J–V characteristics, ensuring the accuracy of device parameters. To better demonstrate the improved device performance statistically, we show the histogram of photovoltaic parameters along with the standard deviations (error bar) in Fig. S10,† based on 20 devices under respective processing conditions. It is important to note that on top of the boosted PCE, the scattering of the device parameters is reduced as well. This result points to a higher reproducibility to yield more efficient perovskite solar cells with the described process with additives.

We further examined the solar cell behaviors processed with longer carbon chain additives (C6F12I2 and C8F16I2; see their chemical structures in Fig. S11a†). The determined MCs with DFT calculation indicate a stronger positivity of the iodine in these additives compared to C4F8I2, due to which the formation of HB is supposedly facilitated. However, from the results of solar cell characteristics (see Tables S5 and S6 in the ESI†), decreased PCEs are observed due to significant decreases in FF and Jsc. We note that the color of the C6F12I2 (or C8F16I2) processed perovskite films significantly changes (Fig. S11b†) and this phenomenon can be due to the unfavorable precipitation of longer chain additives in the perovskite solutions, due to their poor solubility in the used toluene anti-solvent. This may explain the reduced device efficiency with a low film quality.
The effect of hysteresis is a known issue impeding accurate assessments of the realistic efficiency of perovskite solar cells. To this end, in Fig. 3c we compared J–V characteristics scanned in both forward and reverse directions and the corresponding device parameters are provided in Table S7, ESI.† As can be seen, a considerably suppressed hysteresis is achieved using the additive based processing. The calculated hysteresis index (HI), according to the relationship described previously, is 0.224 for the control device and 0.055 and 0.045 (w/) with C4H8I2 and C4F8I2, respectively.49 The reduced HI agrees with the suppression of surface charge trapping together with the reduced non-stoichiometry such that ion motion under electrical fields could be restrained.50
We also examined the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells stored in various environments. Fig. 3d displays (normalized) the PCEs of CH3NH3PbI3 devices as a function of storage time in an ambient environment. The PCE of the control cell drops rapidly, down to half the initial performance after about two months of storage. In contrast, a slower decay of PCE is observed in the additive modified devices. We note a similar degradation rate between the two cells modified with additives showing PCE drops of 23% (C4H8I2) and 22% (C4F8I2) after the same storage time in air. The retardation of degradation leads to maintenance of PCEs >15% for relatively long periods (see Fig. S12†). We further compared the PCE degradation of devices kept in nitrogen (see the inset of Fig. 3d). Consistently, the solar cells processed with additives display much slower PCE degradations, maintaining 83% (C4H8I2) and 87% (C4F8I2) of respective performance at the beginning after more than two months. The slower degradation of PCEs demonstrates that with the described additive process, favorable gains in the environmental stability can be obtained, which likely benefits from a minimized diffusion of H2O and/or oxygen molecules into the perovskite active layer with the compact and pinhole-free morphology.
To gain more insights into the photophysical mechanisms for the enhanced device characteristics with additives, we explored charge transport properties. The current of both hole-only (HO) and electron-only (EO) devices containing the additive-processed perovskite active films increases. In the EOs, we note three discernable transport behaviors and the occurrence of trap-filling current (TFC) characteristics of a strong voltage dependence (guided by the red line in Fig. 4b) implies the presence of electron traps in our perovskites, which agrees with the XPS results in Fig. 2 and the previous observation on thermally evaporated perovskite solar cells.51 Based on the voltage (Vt) corresponding to the transition from the ohmic (linear) current to TFC, the density of traps (nt, see the results in Table S2, ESI†) was estimated according to the relationship nt = 2ε0εr/qL2 (where ε0εr is the dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3, q is the elementary charge and L is the perovskite film thickness).38 Of note, the nt reduces from 7.6 × 1014 cm−3 (control cell) to 6.8 × 1014 cm−3 (with C4H8I2) and further to 5.5 × 1014 cm−3 (with C4F8I2). This result provides direct evidence of the suppressed electron traps, owing to the inhibited non-stoichiometry in the surface region. Based on the dark current in single-carrier diodes we extracted the mobility (μ) of the two carriers in the space-charge limited current (SCLC) regime with Mott–Gurney (see the results in Table 2).52 The determined μ falls in the range of 10−3 to 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, in line with values extracted with time-of-flight techniques.53 Notably, the μ of holes and electrons increases by about 2 and 1.5 fold with C4H8I2 and by 3 and 2 fold with C4F8I2, respectively, with the mobility balance between the two carriers approximately maintained. Generally, the improved carrier transport can promote charge sweep-out toward respective contacts with lower chances of charge accumulation near the electrode interface, due to which carrier losses via surface recombination may be mitigated.10 On this basis, the enlarged Jsc and FF in the solar cells with additives can be explained.

To further assess the impact of the modified perovskites on charge extraction, we probed charge transport kinetics with transient electrical measurements. Fig. 4c displays (normalized) decays of photocurrent density (Jph) under short circuit conditions (bias = 0 V) under excitation at 488 nm. If the charge extraction is unaffected in these devices, one expects an overlap between the normalized photocurrent traces. Instead, we observe visible changes in these kinetics (see Fig. 4c), indicating variations of recombination and charge extraction. The Jph of the additive-processed cells exhibits faster decays than that of the control device and the latter is associated with a large portion of slower decay (extended to microseconds), likely related to charge trapping/de-trapping.44 The extracted time constant (τ) relevant to charge extraction was determined to be 339 ns (control), 231 ns (w/C4H8I2), and 190 ns (w/C4H8I2), respectively, based on a mono-exponential decay model (see fitting parameters in Table 3), which follows the trend of the mobility. The promoted charge sweep-out with enlarged carrier mobility in the steady state fully agrees with the identified suppression of electron traps with additives. Further insights into the transport properties are attained from the impedance spectroscopy (IS) of perovskite solar cells under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The transport resistance (RCT) extracted from IS (see the Nyquist plot in Fig. S13†) was found to decrease from 5540 Ω (reference cell) to 3782 Ω (w/C4H8I2) and further to 2757 Ω (w/C4F8I2). Moreover, the series resistance (Rs) becomes smaller with additives (see the results in Table S8, ESI†). These results confirm the enhanced carrier transport with reduced recombination based on the additive-modified perovskite photo-absorbers.

At last, we performed TPV measurements (under open-circuit conditions) to directly probe the recombination in operational solar cells (see the results of TPV in Fig. 4d). Differing from the TPC, the net current flow in TPV is zero and thus the decay kinetics primarily manifest the lifetime of photo-carriers dictated by recombination. Based on the decay kinetics in Fig. 4d, the effective carrier lifetime was extracted which amounts to 226 ns, 257 ns, and 300 ns for the control cell and those with C4H8I2 and C4F8I2 additives, respectively (see Table 3). These values are in line with the results reported in the literature.54 The elongated photocarrier lifetime unambiguously evidences the mitigation of recombination in the additive-processed solar cells. Such favorable modifications are a synergistic result of the enhanced carrier mobility with suppressed electron traps in the perovskite films enabled by the improved crystallization via HB.
Experimental methods
Materials
1,4-Diiodobutane (98%, C4H8I2) and perfluoro-1,4-diiodooctane (98%, C4F8I2) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Inc. PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa) and CH3NH3I (purity scale: 99.8%, Dyesol) were used as received. Spiro-OMeTAD (99.5%) was purchased from Xi'an polymer Light Technology Inc. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 98%) and chlorobenzene (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Device fabrication
First, FTO patterned glass substrates were cleaned by soap-scrubbing and sonicated sequentially in ultra-pure water, acetone and isopropanol and finally dried at 80 °C for 20 min before use. A TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the FTO conducting glass substrate via hydrolysis of TiCl4 at 70 °C, forming an electron-selective contact. Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, and then mixing with 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of a stock Li+ solution (which contained 520 mg mL−1 bis-trifluoromethylsulfonylamine lithium salt in acetonitrile). For solar cells, the precursor solutions were prepared by solubilizing a mixture of PbI2 and CH3NH3I (1:1 in molar ratio) in dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide (3:7 in volume ratio) with a total concentration of 37 wt%. H8 and F8 were added into the precursor solution with different mass concentrations. After heating at 60 °C for two hours with sufficient stirring, the perovskite precursor solutions were then spin-coated onto the FTO/TiO2 substrates at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 4000 rpm for 45 s. During the last 25 s of the second spin-coating step, the substrates were treated with toluene by drop-casting (0.8 mL). The as-spun films were annealed at 95 °C for 30 min. After that, the hole extraction layer comprising Spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated atop the annealed perovskite films at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of Au top contact was thermally evaporated through shadow masks under high vacuum (<1 × 10−5 Pa). Single carrier devices for electrons and holes adopted the device architecture of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Al and FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, respectively.
Characterization
The current-density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells and single carrier devices were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter under a nitrogen environment. CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells were tested under irradiation by using a solar simulator calibrated with a certified reference Si cell. Single carrier devices were tested in the dark in the charge injection regime. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells was measured by using a Newport external quantum measurement system (Model 66920). The mobilities of single-carrier devices were determined by fitting the J–V characteristics with Mott–Gurney law.
The morphology of the as-prepared TiO2 and perovskite films was characterized by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi-SU8220). Transmittance and absorbance spectra were obtained by utilizing a UV-vis spectrometer (PE Lambda 650/850/950 UV-vis spectrophotometer). Crystallinity and phase identification of the samples was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'Pert) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å). The test range is from 10 to 80 degrees with a speed of 10 degrees per min. Impedance spectroscopy was performed using an electrochemical workstation (model CHI660) under 1 sun illumination at frequencies ranging from 105 to 1 Hz by applying a disturbance AC signal of 10 mV (DC bias = 0 V). Steady-state PL spectra were measured by using a HORIBA Fluorolog-III spectrofluorometer. PL lifetime was determined by using a customized spectrometer system (Fluorolog-III, HORIBA Jobin-Yvon Inc) mounted with a diode laser (λ = 460 nm) as the excitation source with a detector (model R-928) operated at a voltage of 950 V and with peak preset = 3000 counts. The decay dynamics were analyzed using Data Analysis Software. XPS spectra were measured by using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi system with a monochromatized Al Kα source under a pressure of 5.0 × 10−7 Pa. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS. Time-resolved photovoltage and photocurrent decay kinetics were determined by using a customized transient measurements system (Physike, TTPMS-100). As the perturbation source, a square wave shaped laser pulse (488 nm, Coherent OBIS LX 150 mW Laser) with a pulse width of 30 ns and a repetition duty ratio of 0.3% was used to excite the photoactive layer of perovskite solar cells. The generated nonequilibrium carriers were modulated by using a waveform generator and a controllable high brightness LED (intensity = 60 mW cm−2) was used as the bias illumination source. Transient photocurrents were measured over a selectable resistor (1/2/4/8 Ω) compatible with the junction capacity of the device. Signal distortion was minimized within 10 ns, far shorter than the relaxation time. An oscilloscope (Tektronix, MDO3032) was used to record photocurrent or photovoltage decay kinetics. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR):1H and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 500 spectrometer. For 1H, the concentration of perovskite is 1 mM. And the ratio of perovskite to H8 is 1:0.1. For 19F spectra measurements, the concentration of perovskite solutions with and without additives are the same as for the solar cell fabrication.
Computational details
All geometry optimizations were carried out using the B3LYP1-3 functional (Becke's three-parameter nonlocal correlation exchange functional with the nonlocal correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr) with the 6-31G(d) basis set implemented in the Gaussian 09 program.4 The nature of the optimized structures was characterized by vibrational analysis, with which all stationary points were confirmed to be minimal. Mulliken charges from the Mulliken population analysis and molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) were obtained based on the optimized geometries.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a facile and highly efficient processing strategy using diiodoperfluoroalkyl additives to yield favorable modifications of the crystallization, traps and opto-electrical properties of perovskite solar cells. Under the best conditions, CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells processed with C4F8I2 produce an enhanced PCE of 20.1% with a TiO2 based planar architecture. Based on a variety of experimental analyses in conjunction with DFT calculation, we identify the interactions of additives with the iodine anions in perovskite precursor solutions via halogen bonding which can lead to a modified crystallization in CH3NH3PbI3 films with an improved film morphology. We found that the carrier transport is enhanced in the additive-processed perovskite films, due to which charge extraction is expedited with reduced recombination losses. As a consequence, the device efficiency increases significantly showing inhibited hysteresis. With the demonstrated additive strategy, we simultaneously achieve a favorable retardation of the degradation of PCE in our solar cells. The gain of environmental stability is primarily related to the morphological mediation of perovskite films with pinhole-free and compact features. This work enriches fundamental insights into the defect chemistry in perovskite materials and offers a strategic path to tackle critical issues in perovskite solar cells toward achieving high performance and long-term stability.
