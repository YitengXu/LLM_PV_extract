    , Accepted 1st October 2014First published on 2nd October 2014AbstractIn this work, dysprosium ion decorated yttrium oxide (Dy3+:Y2O3) nanocrystal phosphors were incorporated into TiO2 acceptor thin film in a bid to enhance the light harvest, charge separation and transfer in the hybrid solar cells. The results show that the energy level offset between the donor (P3HT) and the acceptor (Dy3+:Y2O3–TiO2) has been narrowed down, thus leading to the enhanced electron and hole transports, and also photovoltaic performances as compared to pure TiO2 without incorporating Dy3+:Y2O3. By applying femtosecond transient optical spectroscopy, after the incorporation of dopant Dy3+:Y2O3 into TiO2 at 6 wt%, both the hot electron and hole transfer lifetimes have been shortened, that is, from 30.2 ps and 6.94 ns to 25.1 ps and 1.26 ns, respectively, and an enhanced efficiency approaching 3% was achieved as compared to 2.0% without doping, indicating that the energetic charges are captured more efficiently benefitting a higher power conversion efficiency. Moreover, these results reveal that both the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges of the acceptor were elevated by 0.57 and 0.32 eV, respectively, after incorporating 6 wt% Dy3+:Y2O3. This work demonstrates that distinct energy level alignment engineered by Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor has an important role in pursuing efficient future solar cells and underscores the promising potential of rare-earth phosphor in solar applications.
1. Introduction
Hybrid solar cells (HSCs) based on inorganic semiconductors (e.g., nanocrystal titanium dioxide TiO2) and organic materials (e.g., poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT) have drawn intensive attention due to the potential of combining the advantageous properties of the two types of materials, such as the highly delocalized electronic states and the significant dielectric constant of inorganic semiconductors, or the low-cost of the solution-processing of a polymer.1–10 Over the last five years, most of the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on the well-known conducting polymer P3HT is around 2%, ranging from 1.0–3.0%.11–13 However, note that much higher PCE of above 5% has been achieved for polymer solar cells based on P3HT by device optimization or molecular design of a new electron acceptor.14,15 Since the solution-processed photovoltaic devices typically suffer from the low efficiency, one of the promising approaches to enhance the device performance is the effective energy level alignment to narrow the energy offset and hence promote the charge carrier transfer at the interface of the BHJs. It is known that the energy offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the P3HT donor and the TiO2 acceptor is about 1.2 eV and this energy offset at the donor/acceptor interface is sufficient to break the Coulomb attraction (typically 0.1–0.5 eV) but not in an efficient way.16,17 However, because of the initial cooling process, a substantial amount of solar energy has already been irreversibly lost.18,19 Besides, it is well-established that the open circuit voltage is dependent on the energy band positions of acceptors and donors.20–22 Therefore, it would not only benefit charge transport but also favor the enhancement of open circuit voltage if an appropriate energy offset at the interface of the donor and the acceptor could be engineered by utilizing the doping of foreign ions or compounds into the acceptor colloid by the low-cost solution-processing.
Recently, much effort has been devoted to the photoluminescence of the rear-earth ion doped semiconductor materials to broaden the absorption domain for solar cell applications,23–27 especially the down-conversion of ultraviolet light to visible light.27 The typical way to achieve the photoluminescence is via an energy transfer using rare-earth ions (e.g., Dy3+) owing to their unique and rich energy level structure,28,29 allowing for efficient spectral modification. These nanometer-sized inorganic materials can exhibit a wide range of optical and electrical properties.30 A host–guest hybrid material with novel properties would be obtained by incorporating foreign ions or compound into the host material. Dy3+ is one of the most efficient rare earth (RE) ions, owing to its versatile energy levels in the near ultraviolet region and the effective energy transitions in an appropriate host material. On the other hand, yttrium oxide (Y2O3) is one of the most promising down-converted host materials for rare earth ions because of the similarities in the chemical properties and the ionic radii of rare earth ions of Dy3+ and Y3+. Moreover, Y2O3 possesses good phase stability, low thermal expansion and a wide transparency range (from ultraviolet to mid-infrared), and also has a low phonon energy that is essential for efficient photoluminescence by minimizing energy loss.31,32 Herein, the Dy3+ ion-decorated yttrium oxide (Y2O3) will be incorporated into the TiO2 acceptor. The intensively pursued nanocrystalline rare-earth phosphors, which can broaden the absorption domain to enhance the exciton generation and improve the transfer of charges by the doping effects, have attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic and unique conversion properties.33 Especially, europium or yttrium ions have demonstrated an excellent enchancement of ultraviolet light harvesting via a down-conversion luminescence process in DSSC devices.34–36 However, seldom evidence has been provided to substantiate the control of the energy band position originating from the rare-earth phosphor dopant and the charge photogeneration dynamics in HSCs has rarely been reported. Herein, we focus on the intensively pursued doping effects of the nanocrystalline rare-earth phosphor dopant to broaden the absorption domain and engineer the energy level alignment of the BHJ, and eventually to enhance the exciton dissociation and charge transport in HSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All analytical purity chemical reagents including tetrabutyl titanate, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, molecular weight of 20000), nitric acid, sodium hydrate, P25(Degussa), OP emulsifying agent (Triton X-100), tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), acetonitrile, isopropanol, yttrium oxide, didysprosium trioxide, conjugated polymer P3HT and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene) polystylene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, Hongkong, China except otherwise indicated. Fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, sheet resistance 8 Ω cm−2) was purchased from Hartford Glass Co., USA.
2.2 Preparation of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor
Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors were prepared by a minor modification of the hydrothermal method according to the following procedures.25,26 Firstly, Y2O3 (0.040 mol) and Dy2O3 (0.002 mol) were mixed and homogenized thoroughly. Then, adequate nitric acid was added into the mixture under heating and stirring. After being completely dissolved, the mixture was quickly transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Then, the compounds were dissolved in deionized water, and then a 10 M NaOH solution was added dropwise under stirring. Afterwards, an appropriate amount of de-ionized water was added until the filled degree reached 80% of the total container volume. The obtained solution was hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for 12 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the obtained product was centrifuged, washed until the pH value of the system equaled to 7, and then dried in air at ambient temperature, followed by sintering in air at 850 °C for 30 min. Finally, Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors were obtained.
2.3 Synthesis of colloidal nanocrystalline rare-earth phosphate doped TiO2
The rare-earth phosphor doped TiO2 colloid was prepared by the following procedure in a similar way to that reported.37,38 Tetrabutyl titanate (10 mL) was added to 100 mL of distilled water under stirring, and then a white precipitate was produced immediately. The precipitate was filtered using a glass frit and washed with distilled water. The filter cake was then transferred to a mixed solution (150 mL) containing 1 mL nitric acid and 10 mL acetic acid at 80 °C, under vigorous stirring a light blue TiO2 precursor was formed. Followed by an ultrasonic stirring for 30 min, the mixture was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 200 °C for 24 h to form a colloid of TiO2. Then 1 wt% P25 and a certain amount of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors were added into TiO2 colloid by repeating crystallization at 200 °C for 12 h. Finally the resultant slurry was concentrated to 1/5 of its original volume by thermal evaporation, and then 0.5 g PEG-20000 and a few drops of the Triton X-100 emulsification reagent were added to produce an even and stable TiO2 colloid.
2.4 HSC device fabrication
A layer of nanocrystalline rare-earth phosphor doped TiO2 acceptor film with a thickness of 200 nm was prepared by coating the TiO2 colloid on FTO glass using a doctor blade technique, followed by sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Since the electron transfer process was more efficient if the donor was adsorbed on the acceptor.39 the acceptor film was soaked in a 0.15 mmol mL−1 conjugated polymer P3HT toluene solution for 12 h to uptake P3HT molecules for the fabrication of BHJ. Then, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the BHJ. Finally, Pt electrodes were deposited on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer as the counter electrode by thermal evaporation under vacuum.
2.5 Characterization
The phases of the prepared powders were identified by a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at a power of 30 kV and 40 mA. The XRD patterns were collected in a scan mode at a scanning speed of 5 min−1 in the 2θ range between 10° and 70°; the microstructure of the Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor was characterized by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd) and high resolution (HR)-TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns working at 200 kV. Samples for TEM and HR-TEM characterization were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the samples in absolute ethanol, placing a small volume of this suspension on carbon-enhanced copper grids, and then drying in air. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data were recorded by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S3500N) equipped with an EDS detector (OXFORD 7021). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results were obtained using a BAS 100B instrument at room temperature at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with 0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte, a platinized platinum (0.5 cm2) as the counter electrode and the Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The values are expressed in potentials versus Fc/Fc+. The TiO2, Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2 and Dy3+:Y2O3 films are used as working electrodes, respectively. Mott–Schottky measurements were done at the frequency of 1 kHz in the aqueous solution of 0.05 M Na2SO4 using a BAS 100B instrument and the Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was measured by using a spectrophotometer (FLS920, Edinburgh), in which a xenon lamp and a photomultiplier tube (R955, Hamamatsu) were used as an excitation source and a fluorescence detector, respectively. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE, also termed as external quantum efficiency) measurements were performed under short-circuit conditions. A class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) served as a light source. The light was directed through a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) onto the HSCs. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled HSCs were recorded on an Electrochemical Workstation (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A, USA) under the irradiation of a simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp in an ambient atmosphere.
2.6 Electron–hole transport primary dynamics
The ultrafast light source with a temporal resolution of ∼120 fs was generated by a mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser operating at 800 nm. An optical parametric amplifier (OPA-800CF-1, Spectra Physics) provided ultra-short laser pulses at desired wavelengths (∼120 fs, full width at half maximum). A continuum white light generated from a sapphire plate was directed into the excited sample and detected using a charge coupled device (CCD) detector. Ultra-short laser pulses at 400 nm were employed as the pump light for the sample excitation and the probe light for the absorption measurement. Transient absorption at various delay times could be measured by controlling the arrival time of each laser pulse at the sample.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the prepared powder
The XRD pattern of the prepared powders Dy3+:Y2O3 nanophosphors is shown in Fig. 1a. It reveals that all the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed as those of cubic yttrium oxide Y2O3. In detail, the peaks at 21.645°, 29.125°, 33.307°, 48.318° and 57.362° obtained from the XRD pattern are in excellent agreement with those of Y2O3 according to JCPDS 86-1107, corresponding to 20.5006°, 29.1523°, 33.7871°, 48.5351° and 57.6246°, respectively. It is worth mentioning that both Y3+ and Dy3+ ions have similar electronic structure as well as similar ionic radii of these atoms (Y = 0.9 Å, Dy = 0.912 Å), which favors the successful replacement of Y3+ ions with Dy3+ ions. Meanwhile, Y2O3 and Dy2O3 were completely dissolved and mixed during the course of the hydrothermal preparation. Therefore, although the initial loading amount of Dy3+ is as small as 5 mol% only relative to Y2O3, nevertheless Dy3+ can enter the Y2O3 lattice to form the so-called Dy3+ decorated Y2O3. Besides, as shown in Fig. 1a, the individual characteristic peaks of bare TiO2 and Y2O3 can be clearly demonstrated, and those peaks are also clearly reflected in Dy3+:Y2O3-doped TiO2 film. Fig. 1b shows the TEM image of the dysprosium ion decorated yttrium oxide nanophosphors, that is, Dy3+:Y2O3, most of which are in the order of about 100 nm in diameter and still within the nano-domain. Fig. 1c and d reveal the HR-TEM images and the corresponding SAED patterns of Dy3+:Y2O3 nanophosphors. The estimated distance spacing of d1 = 0.546 nm, d2 = 0.433 nm estimated from the HR-TEM images are in agreement with those from the standard XRD pattern, i.e., d1 = 0.5301 nm, d2 = 0.4328 nm, which lend further support to the above XRD analysis.

3.2 Energy level engineering by doping Dy3+:Y2O3
An efficient solar device not only requires the wide adsorption of the solar spectrum, but also an excellent separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs into long-lived dissociated charges with a high quantum yield and minimal loss of free energy.40–42 Herein, rare earth ion Dy3+ acts as down-conversion to broaden the absorption of the solar spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†) and the optimal initial molar loading of Dy3+ relative to Y2O3 was optimized and determined to be 5 mol% as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). One route for highly efficient charge transfer needs to compress the geminate recombination of electron–hole pairs and to gain a long diffusion length and also requires quick extraction of electrons and holes. Consequently, in order to achieve a higher efficiency, after rare-earth phosphor was doped, the present work turns to investigate the effects of the energy band control induced by Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor and its influences on the charge transport dynamics. The primary dynamics investigation helps to disclose the innate dynamics of the photoexcited charges in P3HT and the photogenerated electron–hole transfer at the interface of the donor and the acceptor in HSCs. Note that as will be discussed in Fig. 5d, the optimal loading of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor in acceptor TiO2 film is about 6 wt%, because it becomes hard to form a flat acceptor film when exceeding 6 wt%; on the other hand, with further increasing the loading, the elevation of the CB energy level does not change much and only improve slightly (Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, the studies on the photogeneration dynamics were based on the doping of Dy3+:Y2O3 at 6 wt%. Herein, through femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) of organic–inorganic BHJs with selective probe wavelengths, we have successfully monitored electron, hole transfer (∼ps) and the dynamics of electron–hole recombination (∼ns) as shown in Fig. 2 and evidenced that both the charge transfer time and the efficiency are enhanced by doping with Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors.
 Fig. 2  Energy level diagram of acceptor/donor showing optical excitation (up arrow), nonradiative relaxation (curved line), radiative relaxation (down arrow) and the electron and hole transfer times at either Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2/P3HT or TiO2/P3HT interfaces. |n〉 refers to the vibrational eigenstates involved in the transitions. The VB and CB energy levels of pure TiO2 are also shown for comparison. The LUMO and the HOMO of P3HT are −3.0 and −5.1 eV, respectively. 
The conduction band (CB) level of the electro-extraction layer (e.g., Dy3+:Y2O3–TiO2) is below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of P3HT, whereas the energy level of hole-extraction layers (PEDOT:PSS) is above the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of P3HT, thus enabling the delocalized electrons to diffuse towards a donor/acceptor interface while the hole to transfer to the hole-extraction layer (i.e., PEDOT:PSS) as illustrated in Fig. 2. The energy-band model shown in Fig. 2 was used to interpret the charge photogeneration, transfer and the subsequent relaxation. At the thermal equilibrium, the unperturbed P3HT molecules reside in the ground state S0. Under the excitation of 400 nm laser pulse, electrons are promoted to the vibronic levels of excited state S1|n〉 in P3HT molecules, and then the holes are formed in the ground state S0, that is, the so-called charge delocalization (generation). Then the delocalized electrons undergo one of the following three processes: (a) recombination with the holes in the ground state with a decay time constant of τre; (b) relaxing to the lower vibronic level of excited state S1 with a decay time of τvib1 (within ∼1 ps);43 (c) transfer to the interface of BHJ.
An efficient energy conversion in HSCs requires quick extraction of those hot charges before they cool down. Next, we will prove that the favorable energy level alignment can be obtained by doping Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors, which results in the enhancements of both the electron and hole transfers. Therefore, the hot charge transfer becomes more competitive than the cooling process.
3.3 Electron transfer dynamics
Transient absorption spectra of donor/acceptor films measured from 1 to 900 ps are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Note that the negative long-lived absorption bands at 602 nm are ascribed to the photobleaching (PB) of the ground state absorption (S0, S1) of P3HT, which is consistent with the ultraviolet-visible absorption peak (Fig. S3, ESI†). The absorption peak at ∼650 nm is observed immediately after the laser excitation and is ascribed to photoinduced excited state absorption (PA). For 400 nm photoexcitation, it is reasonable to attribute the 650 nm PA band to state-filling effects.44,45
The transient absorption dynamics probed at 650 nm are shown in Fig. 3. The complex state-filling effects can be regarded as the excited state absorption from S1|n〉 to the higher levels with an absorption cross section σS1 > σS0. Thus, the transient photoinduced excited states absorption (PA) decay monitors the variation of the delocalized electron population of the excited state S1|n〉 in P3HT. The TAS signals for both the TiO2/P3HT and Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2/P3HT films in Fig. 3 have prominent contributions from the electronic hyperpolarizability near zero delay, but exhibit a complicated temporal profile at positive time delay. We have decomposed the TAS signals of these films into four dynamically distinct components that appear to the organic–inorganic blend films.45,46 These components include: (1) an instantaneous response of the electronic contribution that is represented by a scalar multiple of the cross-correlation function between the pump and probe pulses; (2) a fast component (<1 ps) that accounts for the prominent shoulder in the upper curves; (3) an intermediate component with an exponential decay in the range 1–50 ps; (4) and a most slow component, which accounts for the TAS at the longer time delay (>50 ps). Thus, ϕ(t) can be described with a superposition of contributions: ϕ(t) = δ(t) + Aexp(−t/τvib1) + Bexp(−t/τhot-e) + Cexp(−t/τre)(1)where δ(t) is the purely electronic hyperpolarizability that responses instantaneously to the applied laser field (Fig. 3 PA1), the second term is the nonradiative decay of vibronic relaxation |n〉 → |0〉 in P3HT after the excitation by the pump pulses (Fig. 3 PA2), the third term is the hot electron transfer to the interface of the heterojunction contributions to the detected signal with a transfer time of τhot-e (Fig. 3 PA3), and the last term is the contribution of the recombination of the electron–hole pairs with a time constant of τre, respectively (Fig. 3 PA4). All these decay transients are well fitted with three exponential decays with nonlinear least squares fitting of the whole delay time using eqn (1) and all the constants are listed in Table 1. The efficiency of hot electron transfer can be estimated by using the ratio of the amplitude B/(A + B + C). For pure TiO2/P3HT and Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2/P3HT, the hot electron transfer time and the efficiency are τhot-e = 25.1 ps, 15.8% and τhot-e = 30.2 ps, 12.1%, respectively. It is evident that with the presence of Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2 as the acceptor layer, the hot electron transfer lifetime becomes shorter, and the transfer efficient becomes higher as compared to pure TiO2. All these outcomes can be ascribed to the energy level alignment of the acceptor induced by the Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors. That is, the CB and VB positions of TiO2 are elevated by 0.57 and 0.32 eV, respectively. Correspondingly, the energy offset between the LUMO energy level of the donor and the CB of the acceptor is narrowed from 1.33 to 0.76 eV; meanwhile, the energy offset between the HOMO energy level and the VB of the acceptor decreases from −2.26 to −1.94 eV, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It is worth mentioning that the results obtained in this work should be reliable. On one hand, as observed from TA spectra, a prominent symmetrical peak that accounts for approximately 90% of the peak amplitude is clearly observed near zero delay, immediately followed by a fast decay in the time domain 1–5 ps. Subsequently, an intermediate component in the range of 1–30 ps was clearly observed. Finally, a long tail dominates the contribution in long time delay. This concept was detailed by the highly-cited work done by D. McMorrow et al.,47 and the method of least-squares deconvolution (LSD) was employed to obtain the parameters by fitting the TA spectra, which has gained recognition and widely been used.48–50 On the other hand, TAS measurements were carefully carried out to obtain reliable results. The laser system was operated at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, and the corresponding time interval of each pulse is 0.1 s. Since the time interval was long enough for the sample to reach a fully thermodynamic equilibrium before the next pulse arrived, thus the already fully relaxed sample can be excited by each pulse. Each data was obtained by averaging 100 individual measurements to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the typical detection sensitivity of the difference absorption (ΔOD) was better than 10−4.

For Dy3+:Y2O3–TiO2 and pure TiO2, the electron–hole recombination times were obtained to be τre = 0.7 and 14.0 ns, respectively, indicating that with the presence of Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2 as an acceptor layer, the delocalized electrons decay much faster than pure TiO2. However, from the transient absorption dynamics of PB (Fig. 4), there is no restoration of the hole in the valence band in P3HT on the long time scale (50 ps to 1.2 ns) with the presence of either pure TiO2 or Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2 as an acceptor. If all the electrons that depart from the S1 state relax to the ground state S0, the hole population decay should resemble the PA signal. On the basis of conservation of the particle number, the discrepancy of the electron–hole recombination time and the hole decay time can be attributed to the ‘less energetic’ electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. In other words, there exists another pathway for electron relaxation. In fact, those hot electrons in a vibronic energy level of the S1|n〉 state first relax to a lower vibronic energy level S1|0〉, and then may have enough time to transfer from the donor to the acceptor because of the long geminate recombination time (∼ns). As the initial cooling process, a lot of energy dissipates by emission of phonons, and then those hot electrons develop into less energetic electrons. Moreover, the less energetic electron transfer time can be estimated on the order of ns due to the decay time quenching from 14.0 to 0.7 ns. Therefore, the reduction of the electron–hole recombination time represents a large number of less energetic electron transfer to the interface. Thus, we conclude that through optimizing the energy level configuration induced by Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor not only reduces the hot-electron transfer time, but also improves the less energetic electron transfer.

3.4 Hole transfer dynamics
The transient PB decay monitors the variation of hole population of the ground in P3HT. The transient absorption decays probed at 602 nm are performed as shown in Fig. 4 to investigate the hole transfer dynamics. Particularly, after being excited by femtosecond laser pulse of 400 nm (about 3.1 eV), which is greater than the band gaps of both donor (∼3.0 eV) and acceptor (∼2.1 eV) molecules, thus both P3HT and TiO2 were promoted to the excited states, and a large number of holes were formed in the valence band of the acceptor and the donor while many electrons were created in the conduction band. The hole decays in the ground state of P3HT experienced three competitions: the hole transfer from the acceptor to P3HT, the recombination with the electrons in excited state S1 and the hot hole cooling from the lower vibrational relaxation. The hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor gives rise to the hole population, while both the cooling of hot holes and the recombination with electrons reduce the population of holes. There exists a competition between the generation of new holes and the quenching. However, the photobleaching dynamics reveal that the population of hole increases in the time domain (from 100 ps to 1.2 ns) despite the recombination of the electron–hole pairs, indicating that the hole transfer is dominant on the long time scale. Nevertheless, early time decays originating from the vibronic relaxation of holes occurred quickly, typically in several sub-picoseconds. Therefore, the transient photobleaching of the ground state absorption decays can be described with a sum of two exponential functions: ϕ(t) = δ(t) + Dexp(−t/τvib2) + Eexp(t/τcomplex)(2)where the second term is the nonradiative decay from the lower vibronic level inducing the hot-hole cooling (Fig. 4 PB2), the third term represents the complex contributions to the detected signal: the hole transport with a hole transfer lifetime τh and the recombination of the electron–hole pairs S1|n〉 → S0 (n = 1, 2, 3,…) with an effective fluorescence decay time constant τflu (Fig. 4 PB3). There exists a competition between the generation of new holes and the quenching, thus the hole transfer time τh can be estimated by using the relation 1/τcomplex = 1/τh − 1/τflu,51 in which τflu was estimated to be about τflu = 38 ± 12 ns.52 From fitting the normalized absorption decays by eqn (2), with either the Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2 or the pure TiO2 layer (electron acceptor) present, we found that the corresponding hole transfer time decreases to 1.26 from 6.94 ns. This phenomenon can be well interpreted by the Marcus theory: in the “inverted” region, the electron transfer rate increases with decreasing energy offset between the conduction band acceptor and donor. In the current case, after doping Dy3+:Y2O3, the energy offset between the VB edge of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor is narrowed down from 2.26 to 1.94 eV and should fall within the “inverted” region herein. The narrowing of the energy offset causes the hole transfer to the interface in a more efficient way with less energy loss, thus in turn boosting charge separation in HSCs.
Although the above analyses in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 are based on one device only, nonetheless time-integrated PL measurements were provided to identify the charge transfer properties with a selected electron–hole-only extraction layer, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), which can further lend support to our work. Compared to TiO2/P3HT, an efficient PL quenching for Dy3+:Y2O3–TiO2/P3HT blend film can be ascribed to the redundant space provided or pores formed by the incorporation of Dy3+:Y2O3 nanoparticles, thus favoring the physical adsorptions of P3HT molecules in virtue of intermolecular attractive forces.53,54 As for the hole-only device P3HT/PEDOT:PSS, the emission intensity of P3HT was quenched intensely after coating on the hole extraction layer PEDOT:PSS. These high degrees of PL quenching indicate that the current configuration of Dy3+:Y2O3–TiO2/P3HT bears good electron and hole transport properties.
3.5 Photovoltaic characterization of the HSCs
With a view of exploring the doping effect of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors on the final photovoltaic performance, we prepared and characterized two types of films for comparison: pure TiO2/P3HT and blended Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2/P3HT films. The devices were fabricated by the sequential depositions of Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2, P3HT, PEDOT:PSS and the Pt electrode on a transparent FTO substrate. The morphology of Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2 was characterized by SEM and TEM. It can be observed from Fig. 5a and c that the particle diameter of TiO2 was estimated to be about 20–30 nm while the diameter of Y2O3 is much larger but still within the nano-domain (about 100 nm). The surface of the TiO2 layer clearly exhibits a porous structure, which benefits the improvement of p–n contact for BHJ.55–57 On the other hand, the porous structure of the TiO2 layer is ready for the adsorption of P3HT molecules by trapping the solution in the microporomerics58–60 in virtue of intermolecular attractive forces.61–64 In addition, the cross-sectional SEM image of the photovoltaic layer was shown in Fig. 5b: the different layers and their individual thickness of the FTO, BHJ, and PEDOT:PSS can be clearly distinguished. Especially, the thickness of the photovoltaic layer was estimated to be about 200 nm as observed from Fig. 5b.

The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the photovoltaic performances of HSC with different loading amounts of Dy3+:Y2O3 are shown in Fig. 5f, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. It reveals that with the increase of Dy3+:Y2O3 amount in the HSCs from 0 wt% to 6 wt%, both Voc and Jsc gradually increase. However, since when the amount of Dy3+:Y2O3 exceeds 6.0 wt% in the doping layer, it is hard to form a flat film, thus a maximum conversion efficiency of 2.97% was achieved under the optimized loading amount of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphor at 6.0 wt% in the doping layer. This can be further confirmed by IPCE measurements of solar cells made from different loading amounts of nanophosphors (Fig. 5e), which were carried out at a given molar ratio of Dy3+ relative to Y2O3 at 5 mol% and exhibit the best IPCE at 6 wt% of Dy3+:Y2O3. A slight but still appreciable increase of IPCE around 375 nm can be observed when the contents of Dy3+:Y2O3 increase from 2 wt% to 6 wt%, which originates from the enhancement of the down-conversion process by Dy3+. Meanwhile, the broad IPCE covering the spectrum from 450 to 600 nm increases significantly with increasing contents of Dy3+:Y2O3, which we ascribe to the energy level tailoring effect as demonstrated in Fig. 5d. However, when the initial loading amount of Dy3+:Y2O3 exceeds 6 wt%, it is hard to form a flat acceptor film, which can seriously influence the intimate contact between the donor and the acceptor, therefore, a notable decrease in IPCE (Fig. 5e) and device performance is observed.

Under the identical experimental conditions, the Dy3+:Y2O3 doped TiO2/P3HT HSC exhibits better device performances than the pure TiO2/P3HT HSC of 2.02%. In detail, the photocurrent density Jsc has gradually increased from 6.10 to 7.89 mA cm−2 while Voc increases from 0.673 to 0.749 V, with the increase of the doping amounts of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors from 0 wt% to 6 wt%. All these better performances can be ascribed to the energy level alignment induced by the incorporation of Dy3+:Y2O3 and the resultant enhancements in light harvesting (i.e., exciton generation), charge transfer and collection. The CB energy levels of TiO2 at different doping concentrations of Dy3+:Y2O3 nanophosphors were determined using Mott–Schottky plots. The Mott–Schottky results (Fig. 5d and Table S2, ESI†) show that with the addition of Dy3+:Y2O3, the CB energy levels of acceptor are substantially elevated from −4.19 to −3.77 eV. However, with further addition (exceeds 6 wt%) of the nanophosphors, the CB energy levels are affected little, down to −3.72 eV at 8 wt% from −3.77 eV at 6 wt%. It is worth mentioning that on one hand, Y2O3 plays the dominant role of tailoring the energy level alignment since the concentration of Dy3+ is limited in view of the fact that the initial loading is small and there is also loss during the hydrothermal preparation; on the other hand, when the initial loading amount of Dy3+:Y2O3 exceeds 6 wt%, it is hard to form a flat acceptor film. Special attention was paid to the energy levels at the optimized doping concentration of 6 wt%: the CB and VB energy levels of the acceptor are elevated by 0.57 and 0.32 eV, respectively, according to the CV characteristics and the UV-vis spectrum (Table S1, ESI†). According to the relationship in eqn (S3) (ESI†),65 the elevated CB energy levels of the acceptor with an increase in the doping amount of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors as demonstrated in the Mott–Schottky in Fig. 5d and Table S2 (ESI†) can provide some insight into the slightly increased Voc (from 0.673 to 0.749 V). The elevated CB energy levels simultaneously reduce the energy offset between the CB energy level of the acceptor and the LUMO energy level of the donor, thus leading to enhanced electron transfer, which can interpret the increased short-circuit current density Jsc as it is related to the charge separation and transfer. This demonstrates that the doping of lanthanide phosphors indeed is critical to the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. This work is initially motivated by exploring the potential powerful role of Dy3+:Y2O3 in inorganic–organic HSCs through a simple architecture. However, having a better understanding of the underlying photophysical mechanism will shed some insight on the designing rule of optimizing photovoltaic devices in future.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the energy level alignment of TiO2/P3HT systems was successfully tailored. That is, the CB and VB edges of the acceptor were elevated by 0.57 and 0.32 eV, respectively, with the doping concentration of Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors at 6 wt%. The results show that both the charge transports (including electron and hole) and the device performances have been significantly enhanced by Dy3+:Y2O3 phosphors. Notably, the electron and hole transfer lifetimes have been shortened from 30.2 ps and 6.94 ns to 25.1 ps and 1.26 ns, respectively. And an efficiency approaching 3% was achieved as compared with the pure TiO2, which can be ascribed to the widened absorption range of P3HT except the tailored energy level induced by rare-earth phosphors. This work underscores the potential of rare-earth phosphors in pursing highly efficient optoelectronic devices with excellent charge-transport properties by tuning appropriate energy level configurations.
