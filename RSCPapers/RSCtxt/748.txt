    , Accepted 16th October 2020First published on 17th October 2020AbstractThe structure–property relationships of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are a key issue in the molecular design of new-generation acceptor materials for further improving the device efficiencies of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, three couples of SMA isomers were synthesized, based on three central fused ring units and two 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) isomer electron-withdrawing terminal units with chlorine substitutions in different positions of its benzene ring: Cl-1 with chlorine on the same side as a CO group of IC and Cl-2 with chlorine on the same side as the CN groups of IC. Through systematical investigation, we found that the chlorine substitution position of the terminal groups has a regular and significant influence on the molecular packing and photovoltaic performance of the SMAs. The molecular packing behavior of the SMAs is closely related to and determined by the configuration of their terminal groups, no matter which central fused ring of the SMAs is used. In particular, the Cl-1-based SMAs possess a stronger crystallinity with long range ordering packing in their molecular plane direction, while the more abundant and stereoscopic π–π intermolecular interaction in the Cl-2-based SMAs promotes the molecules to form three-dimensional charge transporting channels and leads to their red-shifted absorption and higher electron mobilities. Therefore, the Cl-2-based PSCs exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to that of the Cl-1-based devices, and the best PCE of a Cl-2 SMA-based PSC reached 16.42%. These results highlight the importance of the investigation of intermolecular interactions, packing and the arrangement of the SMAs in the solid-state, which may provide direct insights for exploring the relationship between the molecular structure and property of the photovoltaic materials. Moreover, we envision that if fragments such as end groups or side chains with more diverse molecular interactions are added into the design and the subsequent synthesis of the SMAs, this may be beneficial to promoting molecular π–π accumulation and further improving the molecular order, forming suitable molecular packing and morphology in the resulting blend films, and finally affecting the efficiency of the PSCs.

Broader context
Recently the development of low bandgap small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells (PSCs) to over 17%. However, the structure–property relationship is still a key issue and a huge challenge in the molecular design of new-generation SMAs. Herein, three couples of SMA isomers were synthesized, with chlorine substitution on different positions of the terminal benzene ring, to investigate the structure–property relationship. We found that the chlorine substitution position has a significant influence on the physicochemical properties, molecular ordering and photovoltaic performance of the SMAs. Molecular packing behavior of the SMAs is tightly related to and determined by the configuration of their terminal groups, no matter which central fused ring of the SMAs is used. The results provide a direct insight to explore the structure–property relationships of the photovoltaic materials, to further guide the design of SMAs. In addition, the abundant and stereoscopic π–π intermolecular interaction in the SMAs plays an important role in promoting the molecules to form suitable packing and charge transporting channels. Thus, an appropriate design of SMAs with more diverse molecular interactions may be beneficial to improving the molecular order, forming a suitable morphology in the blend films, and finally improving the efficiency of the PSCs.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are a promising lightweight technology that utilizes low-cost renewable solar energy.1,2 As a result of considerable progress in materials and device processing methods, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has exceeded 16%.3–10 The breakthrough in PCE values in recent years is significantly attributed to the development of the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) and A–DA′D–A-structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs).11–16 These kinds of SMAs all exhibit highly anisotropic conjugated structures, which will affect their intermolecular interactions and lead to a significant structure–property dependence.17 The molecular packing plays a crucial role in determining intermolecular interactions, and the electronic and optical properties of the SMAs.18 Moreover, the nanoscale ordering of the SMAs in the solid state crucially affects the mesoscale morphology of their blend films with polymer donors, and further influences the electron mobility, charge separation and charge collection ability of the PSCs.19,20 Therefore, it is essential to study and understand the effect of the molecular structure on the intermolecular interactions and packing of the SMAs.
In recent years, many groups have performed a lot of research on the modification of SMAs.21–29 However, the relationships between the structure, molecular packing and morphology of the blend films are still vague. Thus, some researchers have tried to elucidate the structure–properties relationship of the SMAs through molecular structure modification. For instance, Marks and co-workers reported SMAs of ITN-C9 and ITzN-C9, the difference between them is that the benzene substituents are located in different positions on the terminal group. The divergent PCE outcomes of these molecules are associated with PCE-favorable “π-face-on” molecular orientations and increased crystallinity, which is attributed to the difference in the molecular structures.30 Wei and co-workers carried out a calculation for explaining the importance of molecular arrangements on tuning the exciton binding energies of the SMAs.31 Our group investigated the effects of side chain regiochemistry on the intermolecular interactions and aggregation behavior of the SMAs, TPTC and TPTIC, and found that the side chain regiochemistry had a significant effect on the active layer morphology of the PSCs.19 In addition, based on a series of SMAs, we also highlighted the influence of the side chain length on the single-crystal packing of the SMAs, and on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.32 Morse and co-workers also emphasized the importance of the side chain in molecular packing, and pointed out that molecular fragments like the electron deficient groups or side chains lead to a wide variety of geometrical conformations and adapt to facilitate molecular organization of the SMAs.18 These studies indicate the importance of the fine structure modification on tuning the molecular packing and intermolecular interaction of the SMAs for understanding the structure–property relationship.
In this work, we performed a systematic study on the structure–properties relationship of the SMAs by preparing three couples of SMA isomers with different chlorine substitution positions on their terminal units (Fig. 1), in an attempt to explore how the chemical design can influence the molecular organization of the SMAs and the device performance of the PSCs. The three couples of the SMA isomers are based on the central fused ring of MO-IDIC33 (MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2), the fused ring of Y66 (LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2) and its derivative with longer side chains (N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2) respectively, and a chlorine substitution at different positions of the 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) terminal groups: Cl-1 with chlorine on the same side as the CO group of IC and Cl-2 with chlorine on the same side as the CN groups of IC (see Fig. 1a). The selection and design of the molecular structures were based on the following considerations: (i) the central fused rings are selected from the most representative SMAs including the most representative A–D–A-structured MO-IDIC and the A–DA′D–A-structured star molecule Y6. In addition, the different molecular shapes of the two SMAs was also considered in the molecular design. (ii) The common electron deficient terminal group (A unit) IC group25 is selected as the terminal group of the SMAs. (iii) Chlorination substitution at different positions of the IC was designed to investigate the effect of the subtle chlorine substitution position on the intermolecular interactions and photovoltaic performance of the SMAs.

Absorption spectra of (b) MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2, (c) LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2, (d) N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2 in chloroform solutions and films. 
The absorption spectra, electronic energy levels, crystallinity, crystal packings, mesoscale morphology of the SMAs and their blend films with the polymer donor, as well as the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on the three couples of SMA isomers, were systematically studied and compared. We found that the chlorine substitution position on the terminal group has a regular effect on the intermolecular interactions and photovoltaic performance of the three couples of SMAs, no matter what the central unit is. The Cl-2-based SMAs exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra, a down-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO), a higher degree of self-organization, more abundant intermolecular interactions and higher electron mobility than the Cl-1-based ones. In addition, the abundant molecular interaction of the Cl-2-based molecules should be the primary reason for the more ordered molecular stacking structure in the films. The photovoltaic properties of the three couples of SMAs were investigated by using PTQ10,34 PM635 and PL136 as polymer donors respectively. The Cl-2-based SMAs all exhibit higher PCEs than that of their corresponding Cl-1-based molecules in the same couple of SMA isomers, which is mainly attributed to the improved fill factor (FF) owing to the more ordered molecular accumulation and increased electron mobility of the Cl-2-based SMAs. The best PCE of the PSCs based on PL1:N3–Cl-2 reached 16.42%. These results demonstrate that the molecular packing is mainly predominated by structure fragment interactions, and the molecular packing mode also plays a key role in the photovoltaic performance of the SMAs. Thus, the systematic study of the molecular packing and the refined structure design is effective in developing novel acceptor materials for achieving a high photovoltaic efficiency.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the SMAs
The molecular structures of the three fused ring monomers and the three series of isomeric acceptors based on them are shown in Fig. 1a. IC–Cl was synthesized according to the previously reported literature.13 The two IC–Cl isomer units of Cl-1 and Cl-2 with chlorine substitution on different positions of the benzene ring of the IC end group were successfully separated by column chromatography, the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of these two end groups are shown in Fig. S10–S13 (ESI†). The final SMAs, MO-IDIC–Cl-1, MO-IDIC–Cl-2, LY–Cl-1, LY–Cl-2, N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2 were synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation reactions between MO-IDT–CHO, LY–CHO, N3–CHO and Cl-1 and Cl-2, respectively. The detailed synthesis processes and purification details are provided in the ESI.† The structure and purity of the compounds were measured and confirmed using 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (Fig. S14–S25, ESI†) and mass spectroscopy.
Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels
The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1b–d) of the three series of SMAs in solution and the thin-film states were measured to investigate the effect of the chlorine substitution position on the optical and aggregation properties of the acceptors. The corresponding data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). In the solutions, the acceptors with Cl-1 and Cl-2 terminal groups exhibit a similar absorption range from 550 to 730 nm for MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2, and from 550 to 800 nm for LY–Cl-1, LY–Cl-2, N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2. Moreover, the Cl-2-based molecules (the acceptors with Cl-2 terminal groups) show a slightly red-shifted absorption compared to the Cl-1-based ones. In films, all the SMAs exhibit a red-shifted absorption in comparison with their solutions, which could be attributed to their ordered aggregation in films. In addition, the absorption spectra of the Cl-2-based SMAs show a more obviously red-shifted absorption compared to that of the Cl-1-based ones in the films. This result indicates that the SMAs with Cl-2 terminal groups possess more ordered molecular packing, which will be beneficial and result in an increase in efficient charge transport in the PSCs.
The maximum absorption (λmax) values for these SMAs were observed at 740, 746, 816, 829, 811 and 838 nm, with optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.55, 1.54, 1.39, 1.36, 1.37 and 1.33 eV for MO-IDIC–Cl-1, MO-IDIC–Cl-2, LY–Cl-1, LY–Cl-2, N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2, respectively. Electronic energy levels of these SMAs were measured using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†). The Cl-2-based SMAs exhibited a slightly up-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO), and a down-shifted LUMO energy level (ELUMO) compared to the Cl-1-based SMAs. The changing ELUMO and EHOMO values of the Cl-2-based SMAs agree with their red-shifted absorption and reduced Eg in comparison with the Cl-1-based SMAs, which may be attributed to the changes in the dipole moment or electron cloud distribution in the molecules which had chlorine substitution at a different position.37
Crystallinity and molecular packing of the SMAs
To further investigate the effect of the chlorine substitution position on the aggregation of the SMAs, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was utilized to compare the thermal properties of the SMAs, as shown in Fig. 2. In the first heating of the DSC measurement, MO-IDIC–Cl-2 displays an obvious cold crystallization peak, with an enthalpy of 10.2 J g−1, but there is no clear melting peak. However, MO-IDIC–Cl-1 shows DSC melting peaks in both the first and second heating cycle, which are not shown in MO-IDIC–Cl-2, indicating that MO-IDIC–Cl-1 can crystalize from the melt, whereas MO-IDIC–Cl-2 needs the assistance of the solvent. This is likely related to different interactions between the end groups. As shown in Fig. 2b and e, LY–Cl-2 does not show any crystallization or melting peak, but LY–Cl-1 still shows a cold crystallization peak in the first heat with an enthalpy of 2.8 J g−1, which means LY–Cl-1 is a little more crystalline than LY–Cl-2. Finally, comparing N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2 (Fig. 2c and f), N3–Cl-1 shows two distinct peaks with enthalpies of 1.4 and 3.5 J g−1 respectively, however, N3–Cl-2 is mostly amorphous without any crystallizations or melting peaks. The results demonstrate that the Cl-1-based molecule (N3–Cl-1) is more crystalline than N3–Cl-2. Collectively, it is interesting to note from the data above that the SMAs with Cl-1 terminal groups exhibit higher degrees of crystallites than the Cl-2-based SMAs.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was further used to investigate the orientation, molecular packing and crystallinity of the polymer donors of PTQ10, PM6 and PL1 (which were used in the fabrication of the PSCs to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the SMAs) and the six SMAs in neat films. We prepared these thin films on Si substrates by spin-coating from their chloroform solutions. The rapid evaporation of the chloroform solvent quenched the films in a disordered state owing to the differing abilities and kinetics of ordered aggregation of the photovoltaic materials. Fig. S4 (ESI†) displays the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the polymer donors, which all show a predominantly face-on orientation.

Fig. 3 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the SMAs neat films and their line cuts in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2 exhibit a predominantly face-on orientation with π–π stacking in the out-of-plane direction at about 1.83 Å−1 (Fig. 3c), the π–π stacking distances and the coherence lengths of the MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2 films are similar, with a distance of 3.43 and 3.45 Å, and corresponding π–π stacking coherence lengths (CCL) of 48 and 46 Å, respectively. Compared with MO-IDIC–Cl-2, more scattering peaks are observed for MO-IDIC–Cl-1, suggesting that MO-IDIC–Cl-1 may adopt several different packing motifs or polymorphs and it possesses a higher degree of aggregation than MO-IDIC–Cl-2. For the isomers of LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2 (Fig. 3g and h), the π–π stacking diffraction is at 1.73 Å−1 for LY–Cl-1 compared to 1.77 Å−1 for LY–Cl-2 in the out-of-plane direction. The π–π stacking distance/CCL of these molecules are 3.63/16 Å for LY–Cl-1 and 3.55/18 Å for LY–Cl-2, which exhibits a better π–π stacking and a similar π–π stacking coherence length of LY–Cl-2 compared to LY–Cl-1. The normalized integrated intensity of the π–π stacking is higher in the Cl-2-based compared to the Cl-1-based MO-IDIC and LY SMAs, which indicates that the Cl-2-based SMAs possess a higher degree of molecular packing than those of the Cl-1 based ones in the spin-cast films. Both the N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2 SMAs pairs show a similar π–π staking distance (3.53 Å) and a π–π stacking coherence length (33 Å for N3–Cl-1 and 35 Å for N3–Cl-2). However, the thickness normalized integrated intensity of the π–π staking is slightly higher in N3–Cl-2 than N3–Cl-1, which indicates the improved molecular order in the N3–Cl-2 film compared to the N3–Cl-1 film. In general, the results of the GIWAXS analysis reveal the noticeable common influence of the chlorine substitution position on the molecular packing: the Cl-2-based SMAs exhibit a higher degree of self-organization and more ordered molecular packing in the π–π stacking direction than that of the Cl-1-based ones. This result is consistent with the conclusion obtained from the absorption spectra mentioned above.

Single crystals of the SMAs are free from grain boundaries and have a long-range periodic order.17 Hence, the crystal structure of the SMAs could provide powerful information for examining the intermolecular interactions and structure–property relationships,18,38 which in turn further guides the molecular design and synthesis. Thus, in order to explore the changes in the molecular interaction and the difference in the ordered packing mode caused by the different position of the chlorine substitution in the terminal group, the single-crystals of chlorinated terminal units Cl-1, Cl-2 and the SMAs were grown via slow diffusion of the poor solvent (methanol) into the good solvent (chloroform) solution, then the corresponding diffraction data were acquired. The single-crystal structures of Cl-1 and Cl-2 are shown in Fig. 4a and b, which also exhibits the intermolecular interactions (broken line) between the central molecule (blue one) and the adjacent ones. From this figure, Cl-1 and Cl-2 exhibit completely different packing motives, the interaction between Cl-1 and its adjacent molecules mostly tend to be extended in a plane, while the accumulation of Cl-2 is more stereoscopically extended. The different packing modes of the terminal units could affect the packing of the SMAs.

The configurations of MO-IDIC–Cl-1, MO-IDIC–Cl-2, LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2 from their crystal structures are shown in Fig. S5, and the corresponding crystal data are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). From the crystal structures, all the SMAs exhibit the intramolecular S⋯OC interaction and in particular an additional S⋯O interaction for MO-IDIC, which may provide an interlocking structure to fix the molecular conformation. Chlorine atoms in these systems exhibit abundant interactions with adjacent molecules, including hydrogen bonding with side chains and weak interactions with CN groups, which play an important role in promoting molecular accumulation. In order to reveal the molecular interaction between the adjacent molecules for the SMAs, the in-plane molecules are marked in blue as references and the neighboring molecules with molecular interactions with the reference molecule (central molecule) are shown in Fig. 4a, d, g and j, and as the side chains of the isomeric SMAs are the same, the alkyl chains are therefore omitted for clarity. As shown in Fig. 4a, the central MO-IDIC–Cl-1 exhibits multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Fig. S6, ESI†) with a CN⋯H distance of 2.45/2.51 Å between the adjacent IC molecules and 2.81 Å between the adjacent IC and MO-IDIC perpendicularly to the molecular long axis direction in plane. Furthermore, these molecules are extended by head-to-tail π–π stacking with an average distance of 3.68 Å, and they finally form a parallel arrangement (Fig. 4b and c). For MO-IDIC–Cl-2, there are two independent conformational molecules and three kinds of π–π interactions with an average distance of 3.45 Å (Fig. 4d), which allows these molecules to form a cross-aligned network structure, and further promotes the layers of the large network to form three-dimensional interpenetrating network structures (Fig. 4e).
As shown in Fig. 4g, LY–Cl-1 shows a planar, but not mirrored conformation, and the stacking pattern contains three kinds of π–π interactions with an average distance of 3.59 Å and multiple hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. S6, ESI†) with CN⋯H distances of 2.41 and 2.69 Å. The CN⋯H interactions lead to the molecules forming a wave line extension in the planar layer, and a molecular layer stacked by multiple head-to-tail π–π interactions and the steric effects of the side chains. Interestingly, more intermolecular interactions were found for the stacking structure of LY–Cl-2 than that of LY–Cl-1. In detail, as shown in Fig. 4j, head-to-tail, head-to-head (tail-to-tail) and core-to-core π–π stacking interactions with an average distance of 3.44 Å and hydrogen boding with a S⋯H distance of 2.84 Å and N⋯H distance of 2.75 Å cooperatively form a complex three-dimensional framework in the LY–Cl-2 crystal (Fig. 4k).
Combining the accumulation of Cl-1 and Cl-2 to compare the interaction and packing mode between the Cl-1-based molecules and the Cl2-based ones, some interesting regular patterns caught our attention. Even though the MO-IDIC–Cl-1 (or Cl-2) and LY–Cl-1 (or Cl-2) have different molecular structures and shapes, their packing modes are still similar to that of the terminal electron pulling groups (Cl-1 and Cl-2). The intermolecular hydrogen-bonding connection between the ICs is easier to form for the Cl-1 based compounds, which is conducive to their in-plane extension. However, the interlinking hydrogen bonds are not conjugated and continuous in plane, and make scarce contributions to the electron transport process. MO-IDIC–Cl-1 is packed into the one-dimensional molecular aggregation mode, which limits the electron transporting channel. For the Cl-2-based molecules, however, the intermolecular interactions are more abundant and stereoscopic, such as Cl-2, which allows the molecular packing to expand in three-dimensional space. Moreover, the high dimensionality of the co-facial π–π stacking in the Cl-2-based molecules will provide efficient electronic coupling for charge transfer. Meaning that as MO-IDIC–Cl-2 forms a three-dimensional grid like accumulation, LY–Cl-2 forms a spatial network structure with obvious interlayer packing. These interpenetrating networks are beneficial for the rapid transfer of charge carriers along multiple directions.
The differences in the Cl-1 and Cl-2 based SMAs in terms of the crystallinity and molecular packing characteristics are likely due to the differences in their molecular packing during crystallization and film formation. For the Cl-1 based molecules with Cl-1 terminal groups, multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions could be conducive to their ordered extension in the direction of the long range molecular plane, but not in the π–π stacking direction, which leads the Cl-1 based molecules to possess a stronger crystallinity than that of the Cl-2 based molecules. The abundant and stereoscopic π–π intermolecular interaction of the Cl-2 based SMAs leads to more ordered short-range stacking in the π–π direction, as observed in the GIWAXS measurements, which is beneficial to the charge transfer in the Cl-2 based SMAs. Table S2 in the ESI† lists the electron mobilities of the SMAs measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The electron mobilities of the Cl-2-based SMAs are obviously higher than those of the Cl-1-based SMAs (7.31 × 10−4 for MO-IDIC–Cl-2 vs. 5.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MO-IDIC–Cl-1, 7.08 × 10−4 for LY–Cl-2 vs. 4.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for LY–Cl-1, 14.8 × 10−4 for N3–Cl-2 vs. 5.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for N3–Cl-1), which consist of the molecular packing structures.
Photovoltaic performance
All of the results for the optical properties, electronic energy levels, crystallinity and electron mobilities show that subtle differences in the structures have significant impacts on the molecular packing structure and properties of the SMAs. In order to systematically understand the influence of the difference in the position of the terminal chlorine atoms on their photovoltaic performance, the PSCs with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:SMAs/PDINO/Al were fabricated, in which medium bandgap conjugated polymers PTQ10, PM6 and PL1 (see Fig. S2 in ESI†) were used as the electron donors. The reason for selecting different polymers as donors is to enable better energy level matching between the acceptors and donors, and the slightly up-shifted HOMO level of PL1 compared with that of PM6 is beneficial for matching with the N3–Cl-1 (or Cl-2) with upshifted HOMO energy levels compared with LY–Cl-1 (or Cl-2).36 PEDOT:PSS and PDINO served as the anode and cathode buffer layers, respectively. Chloroform was used as the processing solvent for the devices and the donor/acceptor (D:A) weight ratios in the blend active layers were optimized to 1:1.1 (wt/wt) for the PTQ10:MO-IDIC–Cl-1 (or 2) and PM6:LY–Cl-1 (or 2) systems with thermal annealing at 110 °C for 5 min. The optimized D:A weight ratio for PL1:N3–Cl-1 (or 2) is 1:1.5 and this was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs for the three systems are shown in Fig. 5 and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

For the PTQ10:MO-IDIC–Cl-1 (or 2) system, the devices with MO-IDIC–Cl-1 as an acceptor exhibit a PCE of 10.76%, with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 17.67 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.2%. The MO-IDIC–Cl-2 based PSCs show a better photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 12.49%, the Voc, Jsc and FF are 0.88 V, 19.21 mA cm−2 and 73.9% respectively. Among the LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2 based devices, the PM6:LY–Cl-1 devices yield a PCE of 14.41%, with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 24.30 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.1%. The LY–Cl-2 based PSCs shows a higher PCE of 15.16% with a slightly lower Voc of 0.88 V, and a similar Jsc of 24.19 mA cm−2, but a higher FF of 70.9%, in comparison with that of the LY–Cl-1-based PSCs. For the PSCs with N3–Cl-1 or N3–Cl-2 as the acceptor and PL1 as the donor, the N3–Cl-1 based devices show a good PCE of 15.05% with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 23.86 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.4%, while the N3–Cl-2-based PSCs display an even higher PCE of 16.42%, benefitting from a simultaneously enhanced FF of 75.5% and Jsc of 25.62 mA cm−2 compared to that of the N3–Cl-1 based devices. The IPCE spectra (Fig. 5d–f) of these PSCs displays a broadened photo-response, and the calculated Jsc values from the integration of the IPCE curves are listed in Table 1, which are in good agreement with those from the J–V measurements.
Comparing the photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs based on the three couples of isomeric SMAs, there is a noteworthy trend: the Cl-2-based devices show a higher PCE with a slightly lower (or similar) Voc, higher (or similar) Jsc and a higher FF than those of the Cl-1-based ones. The lower Voc is due to the down-shifted LUMO level of the Cl-2-based SMAs, the higher Jsc values are a result of the extended absorption the Cl-2-based SMAs. The increased PCEs of the Cl-2-based PSCs are mainly ascribed to their improved FF values, from MO-IDIC–Cl-1 (69.2%) to MO-IDIC–Cl-2 (73.9%), from LY–Cl-1 (65.1%) to LY–Cl-2 (70.9%) and from N3–Cl-1 (71.4%) to LY–Cl-2 (75.5%). The improved FF is a result of the higher electron mobility of the Cl-2 SMAs (see Table S2, ESI†). In addition, when using unseparated IC–Cl as the terminal group, the PCE of the corresponding acceptors fall between the efficiency values of the Cl-1-based and Cl-2-based SMAs (see Table S4, ESI†). These results indicate that the refined molecular structural design is an effective method to develop high efficiency photovoltaic materials.
Morphology analysis
In order to gain a deeper understanding about the relationship between the molecular structure of the SMAs and the device performance of their PSCs, we conducted GIWAXS measurements39 on the blend films based on the three couples of isomeric SMAs. As shown in Fig. 6, all the blend films show a predominantly face-on orientation. For the MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2 based films, the corresponding π–π stacking distances of the SMAs in the out-of-plane direction are the same (3.45 Å). However, the polymer donor π–π stacking distances are decreased (from 3.59 Å for the blend with MO-IDIC–Cl-1 to 3.51 Å for the blend with MO-IDIC–Cl-2), which suggests a closer packing of PTQ10 in the MO-IDIC–Cl-2 based blend film. In addition, significantly stronger and sharper π–π stacking peaks were observed for the PTQ10:MO-IDIC–Cl-2 film, and a longer coherence length for the SMA in PTQ10:MO-IDIC–Cl-2 (47 Å) compared to that in the MO-IDIC–Cl-1 (36 Å) based film was obtained, which is beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction. In the GIWAXS pattern of the PM6:LY–Cl-1 and PM6:LY–Cl-2 blend films, it is not possible to deconvolve the contribution of the SMA and polymer donor for π–π stacking (Fig. 6g and h). The π–π stacking distance of 3.61 Å for both the blends and the coherence lengths of 32 and 33 Å, respectively, for the LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2 based blend films do not show much difference. However, the thickness normalized integrated intensity of the out-of-plane π–π peak in the LY–Cl-2 blends is higher than that in the LY–Cl-1 blends, which is mostly attributed to the improved ordering of LY–Cl-2. Fig. 6k and i show the results for the PL1:N3–Cl-1 and PL1:N3–Cl-2 blend films. From the measurements, a similar SMA π–π stacking distance (3.55 Å for N3–Cl-1 and 3.57 Å for N3–Cl-2) and coherence length (49 Å for N3–Cl-1 and 47 Å for N3–Cl-2) are obtained in these two blend films for the SMAs. Similarly, the polymer π–π stacking distance (3.63 Å for the N3–Cl-1-based blend and 3.61 Å for the N3–Cl-2-based blend) and the coherence length (19 Å for the N3–Cl-1-based blend and 20 Å for the N3–Cl-2-based blend) does not show a significant difference. Nonetheless, the intensity of the out-of-plane direction is clearly increased in the N3–Cl-2 based films compared to the PL1:N3–Cl-1 blends, which is mostly attributed to the improved ordering of the N3–Cl-2 acceptor. Summarizing these three systems, the packing difference caused by the molecular interaction in the SMAs not only affects the properties of their neat films, but also influences the corresponding properties of their blend films with polymer donors, and this may be due to the distinctive packing mode of the SMAs in the single crystal, which are most likely still preserved in the films.40 The surface morphology of the corresponding blend films was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), there is no obvious difference between the Cl-1-based and Cl-2-based films. Therefore, the surface morphology has little effect on the properties of the blend films. Finally, the improved molecular ordering and the molecular aggregation of the Cl-2 based SMAs in the blend films help to improve the electron mobilities and therefore result in higher photovoltaic efficiencies for the PSCs with the Cl-2-based SMAs as acceptors.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that a small change in the chlorine substitution position of the terminal IC electron deficient groups has a significant influence on the properties and molecular ordering of the SMAs based on three different central fused ring units. A couple of new A–D–A SMAs with the same central fused ring of MO-IDIC (MO-IDIC–Cl-1 and MO-IDIC–Cl-2) and two couples of A–DA′D–A SMAs with the central units of Y6 (LY–Cl-1 and LY–Cl-2) and its derivative with longer side chains (N3–Cl-1 and N3–Cl-2) were synthesized by using chlorine substituted IC isomeric terminal groups: Cl-1 with chlorine on the same side as the CO group of IC and Cl-2 with chlorine on the same side as the CN groups of IC. Detailed investigations of the molecular interactions were performed in order to understand the structure–property relationships in the three couples of SMA isomers. It was found that the chlorine substitution position of the terminal groups influences the molecular interaction and the photovoltaic performance of the SMAs. The Cl-2-based SMAs exhibited a slightly red-shifted absorption, an up-shifted EHOMO and down-shifted ELUMO, three-dimensional interpenetrating network structure with highly ordered π–π direction molecular packing and significantly higher electron mobility than those of the corresponding Cl-1-based isomers. In comparison with the photovoltaic performance of the SMA isomers with the same central fused ring and different terminal groups of Cl-1 and Cl-2, the Cl-2 SMA-based PSCs revealed a higher PCE with a higher FF for all three series of SMAs, and the best PCE of the PSCs based on N3–Cl-2 reached 16.42%. Thus, appropriate design of SMAs is important for the molecular aggregation and the formation of an electron transporting network in the solid-state. Our results indicate that the introduction of suitable substituents at suitable positions to promote intermolecular interactions could be an efficient way to improve the molecular stacking of the photovoltaic materials to further increase the PCE of the PSCs.

Broader context
Recently the development of low bandgap small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells (PSCs) to over 17%. However, the structure–property relationship is still a key issue and a huge challenge in the molecular design of new-generation SMAs. Herein, three couples of SMA isomers were synthesized, with chlorine substitution on different positions of the terminal benzene ring, to investigate the structure–property relationship. We found that the chlorine substitution position has a significant influence on the physicochemical properties, molecular ordering and photovoltaic performance of the SMAs. Molecular packing behavior of the SMAs is tightly related to and determined by the configuration of their terminal groups, no matter which central fused ring of the SMAs is used. The results provide a direct insight to explore the structure–property relationships of the photovoltaic materials, to further guide the design of SMAs. In addition, the abundant and stereoscopic π–π intermolecular interaction in the SMAs plays an important role in promoting the molecules to form suitable packing and charge transporting channels. Thus, an appropriate design of SMAs with more diverse molecular interactions may be beneficial to improving the molecular order, forming a suitable morphology in the blend films, and finally improving the efficiency of the PSCs.
