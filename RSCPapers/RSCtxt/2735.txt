    , Accepted 17th February 2023First published on 15th March 2023AbstractHydrogen will play a vital role in Germany's future energy supply. Because of that, the German government has issued a hydrogen strategy in 2020 to ensure the future hydrogen supply in Germany. Due to the increased interest in this energy carrier, this study investigates the LCOH for different hydrogen plants in Germany. For this purpose, different water electrolysis technologies and scenarios have been considered. The objectives of the study are, on the one hand, to find out which hydrogen technology causes the lowest LCOH for the different scenarios and what LCOH can be expected for green hydrogen in 2030 and 2050 if electricity prices are only 20 or 30 € per MWh, which are also compared to the production costs of blue and grey hydrogen. On the other hand, other objectives of the study are to find out how the change in wholesale electricity prices in 2022 compared to those in 2021 affected the LCOH and how the LCOH changes if an electricity price of 0 € per MWh is assumed. Furthermore, the results are compared and classified with the generation costs of other processes as well as results from other studies. The study concludes that the solid oxide electrolyser cell technology causes the lowest LCOH, except for the 4000 h_RE current scenario. If the electricity prices for green hydrogen production are 20 or 30 € per MWh, the LCOH decreases significantly and is in between 1.33 and 2.88 € per kg H2 (30 € per MWh) and 0.95–2.39 € per kg H2 (20 € per MWh). These values are competitive compared to those for blue and grey hydrogen. Compared to 2021, the LCOH has doubled or nearly doubled. Provided that an electricity price of 0 € per MWh is assumed, the LCOH decreases by about 35–99% (10 MW) and 45–99.5% (100 MW), with even some negative LCOH values due to the assumed revenues for oxygen. In addition, the results are in good agreement with those of other studies and are competitive with those of other processes at an electricity price of 20 € per MWh.
1. Introduction
Due to the accelerating climate change and serious effects on humans and nature, both the EU and the Federal Government of Germany have enacted hydrogen strategies that are to contribute to significantly reducing CO2 emissions in the areas of industry, transport and energy. The primary goal is to become less dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas and to replace them with renewable, climate-friendly hydrogen, so that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced, and the Paris climate goals can be met.1,2 Climate-friendly hydrogen is to be used primarily in the chemical and steel industries and, in combination with CO2, as a climate-friendly fuel for trucks, ships, trains and airplanes.2,3 In addition, conventional gas-fired power plants are to be built or retrofitted in the future, so that they can be operated with climate-friendly hydrogen after security of supply is ensured by renewable energies.2 These intentions mean that hydrogen will play a crucial role in future energy supply, especially for Germany. Therefore, the German government has agreed on strategic partnerships with Australia and countries in western and southern Africa regarding the future supply of green hydrogen, as conditions in these areas are particularly favorable for wind and solar power. Furthermore, the Federal Government plans to have 10 GW of installed domestic electrolyser capacity by 2030 to meet future hydrogen demand.2 Due to these promising prospects for hydrogen as an important building block of the future energy supply in Germany, this study investigates the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), considering the three major electrolysis technologies – alkaline electrolysis (AEL), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). Nowadays, hydrogen plays only a minor role in energy supply. For example, hydrogen accounts for only 2% of the total energy demand and thus only a small share of the energy supply in Europe. Hydrogen is mainly used for the production of chemical products. 96% of this hydrogen is produced by natural gas (steam reforming) and therefore considerably contributes to climate change through CO2 emissions.2 The reason why hydrogen is preferentially produced from natural gas by steam reforming is that the production costs for blue and grey hydrogen at 1.5–2 € per kg H2 – before 2022 – were much lower than the production costs through water electrolysis.4,5 However, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels causes much higher emissions with about 13.3 kg CO2 per kg H2.6
1.1 Literature
Regarding the LCOH, plenty of articles have already been published.7–17 In this regard, the number of published articles in terms of hydrogen and cost has significantly increased since 2015. This is evidenced by Yue et al. who conducted an extensive literature review on the topic.16 Yue et al. considered a period from 2000 to 2019 and applied the following search terms: hydrogen & cost and hydrogen & economy. A total of 806 publications were published in 2015, while the number in 2019 included 1985 publications, an increase of more than 146%, which highlights the interest in this topic and shows that there is a lot of movement in this area.16 This trend is also confirmed by Bhandari & Shah and Emam & Özcan,8,9 who also conducted extensive literature reviews on this topic. It is shown in the studies that the focus is on AEL and PEMs,8,9,13,16 mainly due to the maturity of the technologies (SOEC early development stage, see ESI Table 1†).8 This can also be applied to studies that focus only on Germany.7,8,12,18 In addition, the studies were published before the increase in energy costs due to the Ukraine war, so these studies could not consider the impact of increased energy costs, which are likely to persist in the longer term,19 on the LCOH. However, since energy costs are the largest contributor to the LCOH, provided a certain operating time per year and corresponding electricity prices are achieved,13,14,20 this is of particular importance if electricity is purchased from the grid. Due to the fact that most studies only focus on AEL and PEMs and do not consider current energy prices for the purchase of grid electricity for hydrogen production, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the LCOH in Germany, contemplating all three major water electrolysis technologies (AEL, PEMs, and SOECs) and up-to-date electricity prices as well as future costs for 2030 and 2050 to show a comprehensive overall picture of hydrogen generation in Germany with a focus on green hydrogen. Consequently, this study contributes a new research article to the scientific community, which is of broader interest, and aims to answer the following research questions:
(1) Which water electrolysis technology accounts for the lowest LCOH for current, 2030, and 2050?
(2) What is the LCOH for green hydrogen at an electricity price of 20 and 30 € per MWh and how does it compare to blue and grey hydrogen?
(3) How did the LCOH change in 2022 after wholesale electricity prices increased exorbitantly compared to 2021?
(4) How does the LCOH change with an electricity price of 0 € per MWh?
(5) How does the LCOH compare to other processes and results from other studies?
In this article, different full load hour (FLH) scenarios have been applied (4000 h, 6000 h, and 8000 h). The reason for the consideration of at least 4000 h is that the electrolyser system should operate for at least 3000 to 5000 h per year, according to ref. 21, which supports the choice of 4000 h as the minimum operating time. Besides that, the higher the FLH are the lower the LCOH, according to Götz et al.20 Consequently, FLH below 4000 h have deliberately not been considered. Besides that, a renewable scenario (4000 h_RE) has been applied, where the electricity is supplied by a hybrid mix of wind and solar power. This is a realistic assumption for wind and solar power supply in Germany throughout the year, in accordance with ref. 22. The calculation of the LCOH has been performed for 10 and 100 MW plants since it is expected that hydrogen will be produced in large centralized plants in the future.23 In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted for sensitive parameters, which is further illustrated in the following chapter.
The SOEC technology, which is the least developed of the considered technologies, can be used in three different operating modes: thermoneutral, endothermal, and exothermal. In the thermoneutral operating mode, the energy input is equal to the energy demand, and the efficiency of electrical to hydrogen conversion is 100%. In this mode, the heat required to generate hydrogen is equal to the heat released in the cell by Joule heating. Applying the exothermal mode, the electrical efficiency is less than 100% because the energy input exceeds the reaction enthalpy. In this mode, the generated heat in the cell can be used to preheat the inlet gases. An advantage of the exothermal mode is the use at higher current densities. Regarding the endothermal mode, heat must be supplied to the system (e.g., process heat) to maintain the temperature level, since the electrical energy input is below the reaction enthalpy. The electrical to hydrogen conversion efficiency, however, is greater than 100% in this mode and leads to lower degradation, since this mode is used at lower current densities.24
More information about the water electrolysis technologies can be found in ESI Section 1.†
2. Methodology
The applied method for calculating the LCOH in this study is based on the study by Gorre et al. The reason for choosing this method is because the method is based on project experience.25 Besides that, the components for the LCOH calculation are discussed in this section. This includes capital expenditure (CAPEX), fixed and variable operating expenses (OPEX), revenues, stack lifetime and replacements. Moreover, the hydrogen production rates and specific energy demand of the technologies are discussed as well, besides the selected parameters for the sensitivity analysis.
2.1 Levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH)
There are various methods available to calculate the profitability of a plant or project,25,26 for example, the calculation of the net present value. This method gives an overview of whether it is worth investing in a plant or project or not. The total discounted costs are deducted from the total discounted revenues over the full life of the project. While a positive result means a profitable project and is worth investing in, a negative result means that the project is not profitable and therefore should not be invested in. A result of zero means that there is neither a profit nor a loss (break-even point).25,26 In addition, there is the method of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) or in terms of hydrogen production, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). According to Fambri et al., this method calculates the breakeven sale price,27i.e., the price that must be earned to avoid losses. The results are expressed in cost per unit of stored energy (e.g. € per kW per h, € per MWh, or € per kg). The LCOH is calculated in this study as follows, see eqn (1).25,27 (1)where n equals the plant's lifetime, CAPEXi is the capital expenditure in year i, fixOPEXi is the fixed operational expenditure in year i, Celi is the cost of electricity in year i, Cwati is the cost of water for hydrogen generation in year i, CRi is the cost of stack replacement in year i,  is the revenue for produced oxygen in year i, r is the discount rate (base scenario 10%), and  is the produced amount of H2 in year i.
A discount rate of 10% has been assumed because most studies regarding the levelized cost calculation of power-to-gas processes chose a value between 6 and 8%,25,28 while a discount rate for chemical plants is usually in the range of 10–20%, according to ref. 29. Therefore, a discount rate of 10% has been considered as a baseline scenario and is further changed to 8% and 12% in the sensitivity analysis.
2.2 Capital expenditures, CAPEX
The CAPEX of the considered water electrolysis technologies are high; however, they might decrease significantly in the future.25,30Table 1 shows the CAPEX for the electrolyser systems, H2 storage, grid injection as well as additional costs for planning and installation.

The CAPEX for the electrolyser systems stem from Zauner et al., who predicted the CAPEX for electrolyser systems in a comprehensive study through technical learning curves.30 With regard to the storage cost of hydrogen (490 € per kg H2 which will decrease in the future), an amount of 1000 and 10000 kg H2 for 10 and 100 MW systems, respectively, has been presumed, according to the considered amount of hydrogen (100 kg) stored for a 1.2 MW system27 and the calculations by Zhang et al.28 Besides that, the costs for gas grid injection, and additional cost for installation and design are obtained from Gorre et al.25
2.3 Operating expenses, OPEX
When it comes to the OPEX, the OPEX can be split into two parts, fixed and variable OPEX. The fixed OPEX have to be covered even if the plant is not operating, while the variable OPEX only arise if the plant is producing.18

2.3.1 Fixed OPEX. 
The fixed OPEX comprises costs that occur even if the plant is out of order, e.g., personnel and insurance costs, and stem from Gorre et al. because these values relate to project experience and therefore represent realistic values.25 The considered values are listed in Table 2.

2.3.2 Variable OPEX, revenues, and stack lifetime: . 

Table 3 gives an overview of the assumed electricity prices, process water costs, O2 revenues, and stack lifetime of the different technologies. For the current scenario, electricity costs of 232 € per MWh were contemplated, based on the average of the monthly wholesale electricity prices from January to November 2022.31 Compared to 2021, the price rose exorbitantly by more than 139% (97 € per MWh),32 mostly due to the energy crisis in Europe.33 For 2030 and 2050, the electricity prices are subject to uncertainties because they are based on estimates. While the price for 2030 is obtained from ref. 34 and equals 93 € per MWh, 2050's price is assumed to increase by 13% compared to that for 2030, following the predictions by ref. 35. Thus, this results in an electricity price of approx. 105 € per MWh. Due to the uncertainties of future electricity prices – 2022 as an example – and the fact that the electricity price is the most sensitive parameter of the cost components for FLH > 4000 h,13,14,20 the electricty costs are part of the sensitivity analysis. Moreover, a renewable scenario (hybrid mix of wind and solar power) with 4000 FLH, following ref. 22, and a price of 50 € per MWh (ref. 36) – which corresponds to 5 ct per kW per h – is considered in this study. In addition, electricity prices of 0 € per MWh have been presumed for all scenarios to show the effect on the LCOH if no electricity costs are contemplated.

A price of 2 € per m3 has been assumed for water,37 while an amount twice as high as the water consumption of the stoichiometric demand has been considered for hydrogen generation, following ref. 25. Furthermore, only oxygen has been considered as an additional source of revenue with a price of 7 ct per kg,38 since it has been assumed that heat is not contemplated as an additional source of revenue. The reason is, on the one hand, that the process heat can itself be used. On the other hand, it has been assumed that the plants are not located close to the district heating network. With regard to the stack lifetime, the values from ref. 39 in Table 3 have been assumed. In this respect, the following numbers of stacks' replacement result if a plant lifetime of 20 years is assumed (Table 4). These numbers have been multiplied with the replacement costs in % of electrolyser system costs in order to obtain the total replacement costs (see Tables 1 and 4).39

This parameter (stack replacements) is not part of the sensitivity analysis, although the values for 2030 and 2050 are subject to large uncertainties. The reason is that this parameter has only a very small impact on the LCOH, which is confirmed by the extensive study by Zauner et al.30 In the study, the lifetimes have been changed by ±25% for different future scenarios. The same applies for fixed OPEX, revenues from oxygen, and costs for water consumption, so these parameters have also not been considered for the sensitivity analysis (see below).27,30

2.4 Specific energy demand and production rates: 

Table 5 shows the values for the specific energy demand in kW h per kg H2 and the production rate of hydrogen per hour. The values for the specific energy demand are taken from ref. 39, while the hydrogen production rates per hour are based on the calculation by Zhang et al.,28 taking the specific energy demand as the initial values. The production rates are for 1 MW systems and therefore multiplied by 10 and 100 for the 10 and 100 MW systems, respectively, according to Zhang et al.28 Since the efficiency of the technologies is associated with high uncertainties, this parameter is also part of the sensitivity analysis.

2.5 Sensitivity analysis
The parameters considered in the sensitivity analysis are listed in Table 6. For each parameter a width of ±20% has been assumed. The selection is limited to these parameters because according to Zauner et al. – with the exception of the discount rate – they have the largest impact on the LCOH.30

The next section discusses the results and answers the research questions. The results of the sensitivity analysis are also discussed. At this point, the author points out that the current results regarding SOECs are not very meaningful, which is related to the stage of development of the technology. However, the author has used the values from Zauner et al.30 to be able to depict a complete analysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Discussion of the results
As can be seen in Fig. 1 and 2, the lowest LCOH for current, 2030, and 2050 occur if the SOEC technology is used, with the exception of the 4000 h_RE current scenario. This is due to the much higher efficiency of the technology compared to AEL and PEMs (see Table 1, ESI†). Thus, the values for SOEC (10 MW) range between 11.97 and 13.66 € per kg H2 (current), 4.26–4.97 € per kg H2 (2030), and 4.11–4.47 € per kg H2 (2050), while the values for AEL range between 13.3 and 14.43 € per kg H2 (current), 5.18–5.84 € per kg H2 (2030), and 5.19–5.54 € per kg H2 (2050), and for PEMs, between 13.97 and 15 € per kg H2 (current), 5.55–6.09 € per kg H2 (2030), and 5.17–5.42 € per kg H2 (2050). Besides that, the values decrease with increasing operating time, which is in agreement with ref. 13 and 20, and the values of the 100 MW plants are lower than those of the 10 MW plants, which is related to the lower CAPEX in € per kW. Moreover, the values for green hydrogen are in the range of approx. 4–6 € per kg H2 (current), 3–4 € per kg H2 (2030), and 2–3 € per kg H2 (2050) and constantly decrease over time.
 Fig. 1  LCOH of different hydrogen plants (10 MW). 
 Fig. 2  LCOH of different hydrogen plants (100 MW). 

Fig. 3 and 4 show the composition of the LCOH. It can be seen from the figures that, except for some values of the 4000 h_RE scenario, the electricity costs are the largest cost factor of the LCOH, while the CAPEX are less than 20% of the LCOH, except for some values of the 4000 h and 4000 h_RE scenarios. Furthermore, the shares of fixed OPEX, process water, and stack replacements on the LCOH are considered as low or even very low, which is why these parameters are not included in the sensitivity analysis (see above). Regarding the O2 revenues, negative values result, since these reduce the LCOH between approximately 2–12%. Overall, it can be stated that electricity costs are the most important cost factor for scenarios ≥4000 h and should therefore be part of a sensitivity analysis.
 Fig. 3  Composition of the LCOH (10 MW). 
 Fig. 4  Composition of the LCOH (100 MW). 
For the 4000 h_RE current scenario, the much higher CAPEX and lower electricity price of 50 € per MWh result in the LCOH of a SOEC being larger compared to AEL and PEMs, despite the higher efficiency. Thus, the value for this scenario of 5.96 € per kg H2 is higher than the values for AEL (5 € per kg H2) and PEMs (5.18 € per kg H2). Regarding the 100 MW plants, the value for the 4000 h_RE current scenario is 4.63 € per kg H2 and lies in between the values for AEL (4.44 € per kg H2) and PEMs (4.69 € per kg H2). Otherwise, the above also applies for the 100 MW plants, namely that the values decrease with increasing operating time. The values for both the 10 and 100 MW plants are included in the ESI.†
Looking at 2030's and 2050's values of the 4000 h_RE scenario, the LCOH for a SOEC is lower due to the expected decrease in CAPEX (see Table 1). For a SOEC, the values are in between 2.68 and 3.27 € per kg H2 and thus lower than the LCOH for AEL (3.33–3.72 € per kg H2) and PEMs (3.38–3.74 € per kg H2), which also applies for 2050's values of 2.03–2.39 € per kg H2 compared to AEL (2.65–2.93 € per kg H2) and PEMs (2.62–2.73 € per kg H2). This is valid for electricity prices of 50 € per MWh. These values are overall in very good agreement with the literature values40,41 that forecasted a LCOH of green hydrogen for 2030 in Germany of 3–4 € per kg H2 and for 2050, of 2–3 € per kg H2. Consequently, the electricity price of 50 € per MWh for green generated hydrogen seems reasonable. Furthermore, Aurora Energy Research also sees a LCOH of >3 € per kg H2 in 2030 as realistic, and deviates from previous forecasts where a LCOH of 2 € per kg H2 have been presumed.42 This is because the electricity price for a LCOH of 2 € per kg H2 in 2030 would have to be well below 20 € per MWh, which is considered as unrealistic according to ref. 42. Since the LCOH of blue and grey hydrogen are ≤2 € per kg H2 – without considering the exorbitantly increased natural gas prices,5 – it remains to be stated that the LCOH of green hydrogen at an electricity price of 50 € per MWh would be too expensive compared to blue and grey hydrogen and are therefore not competitive.
On the other hand, if we consider the high natural gas prices in 2022, the production costs of blue and grey hydrogen have increased sharply and in some cases were above 6 € per kg H2.43 These costs are even higher than the LCOH for green hydrogen of the current scenario in this study (4.44–5.96 € per kg H2) as well as the current LCOH of green hydrogen in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.43,44 Based on a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA, these range from 2.8 to 6.2 € per kg H2. Even though the values are mainly dependent on the number of operating hours, fluctuations in electricity prices and quality of wind and solar energy,44 these values show that green hydrogen can already be an alternative to blue and grey hydrogen from natural gas at current natural gas prices.
3.2 LCOH of green hydrogen at electricity prices of 20–30 € per MWh
Since natural gas prices will not remain at the extremely high level of 2022,45 and green hydrogen is not competitive with blue and grey hydrogen at an electricity price of 50 € per MWh, it is interesting to find out what will happen if electricity prices for the production of green hydrogen from wind and solar energy are only 20 or 30 € per MWh. For this purpose, Fig. 5 and 6 show the results including the values for 50 € per MWh.
 Fig. 5  LCOH for 2030 and 2050 with electricity prices of 20, 30, and 50 € per MWh (10 MW). 
 Fig. 6  LCOH for 2030 and 2050 with electricity prices of 20, 30, and 50 € per MWh (100 MW). 
As can be seen, the values are significantly lower than the values with 50 € per MWh as electricity price. Thus, the values for 2030 with 30 € per MWh and 20 € per MWh as electricity price are 19–23% (2.65–2.88 € per kg H2, 10 MW) and 29–32% (1.89–2.34 € per kg H2, 100 MW) as well as 31–41% (2.22–2.39 € per kg H2, 10 MW) and 44–48% (1.50–1.85 € per kg H2, 100 MW) below the values with 50 € per MWh as electricity price and also below the projected values of 3–4 € per kg H2 for 2030 (see above). This means that green hydrogen is competitive with blue hydrogen and even with grey hydrogen if costs are ≤2 € per kg H2 (price level before 2022).4,5 The Hydrogen Council even sees generation costs below 1.5 € per kg H2 in sunny parts of Europe as realistic by 2030.46 Thus, the Hydrogen Council assumes costs of about 1.4 € per kg H2.46 However, from the author's point of view, this has to be considered as very optimistic, as electricity costs would have to fall below 20 € per MWh, which also seems unrealistic from Aurora Energy Research's point of view.42 The Department of Energy (DOE) even assumes a hydrogen price of only 1 USD per kg H2 by the end of the decade,47 which would be unrivaled compared to alternative processes relying on fossil fuels.48 However, it should be noted that the generation cost of green hydrogen of 1 USD per kg H2 would only be possible in countries with high capacity factors, therefore with high FLH of solar and wind energy.22 In this case, the hydrogen would have to be transported for use in Germany, which would significantly increase the LCOH of 1 USD per kg H2.45 Altogether, the projected LCOH of green hydrogen for 2030 of about 1–4 € per kg H2 varies widely and are therefore subject to uncertainties.
With respect to 2050, the values are well below 2030's values in the range between 1.73 and 2.06 € per kg H2 (30 € per MWh, 10 MW) and 1.33–1.76 € per kg H2 (30 € per MWh, 100 MW) as well as 1.35–1.58 € per kg H2 (20 € per MWh, 10 MW) and 0.95–1.28 € per kg H2 (20 € per MWh, 100 MW), respectively. In this context, the LCOH could fall below 1 € per kg H2 in 2050 in large centralized plants using the SOEC technology, which would make the production particularly attractive. In general, large central plants are expected to have a lower LCOH in the future than small central plants,23 which is related to the lower investment costs in € per kW, amongst other things. The costs are absolutely competitive compared to the production costs of grey and blue hydrogen, which is also confirmed by ref. 43. In order to make green hydrogen further competitive compared to grey and blue hydrogen, there are also opportunities from the policy side to help lower the production costs of green hydrogen and make the production costs of fossil hydrogen more expensive, so that green hydrogen is promoted.

3.2.1 Political measures. 
In this context, tax incentives for investments in hydrogen technologies could be created to increase the attractiveness of investing in these technologies. This could accelerate development and research efforts and lead to more efficient outcomes that would also have a positive impact on the LCOH. In addition, there is an opportunity for even greater governmental support for these technologies by providing more funding than is currently available49 to accelerate development and research efforts as well. Furthermore, and this is the most important point from the author's point of view when it comes to incentives and funding opportunities for the technology, the subsidies for fossil fuels, which amounted to 16 billion euros in 2021 and are difficult to justify in times of climate change,5 could be used to promote or subsidize green technologies. For example, these funds could be used specifically to subsidize electricity prices, so that electricity prices of 20–30 € per MWh can be achieved, which would make green hydrogen in Germany not only competitive to blue hydrogen, but also to grey hydrogen, independent of natural gas prices, especially in large central plants (see above). This would also have an impact on the carbon footprint, as the production of grey hydrogen causes over 13 kg of CO2 per kg of H2 (ref. 6) and is difficult to justify in times of climate change and alternative technologies. The reason is that the environmental impacts create societal damage costs that lead to a significant loss of welfare.50 Therefore, the environmental impacts of fossil-based hydrogen production processes with very high CO2 emissions per kg H2 are another starting point to promote green hydrogen. Thus, the environmental impacts of the fossil-based hydrogen production processes could be monetised with the help of environmental prices published by CE Delft51 and levied as an environmental tax on the production costs. For this purpose, the environmental impacts – such as the CO2 emissions of 13.3 kg CO2 per kg H2 (ref. 6) – would be multiplied by the environmental prices. The result is a value in € per unit produced and therefore monetises the environmental impacts (= environmental costs). Since the environmental impacts of green hydrogen are lower than those of fossil hydrogen,52 the difference in the environmental costs could be levied as an environmental tax on the prices for fossil-based hydrogen. This would make the prices for fossil-based hydrogen more expensive and thus promote green hydrogen.
Overall, from the author's point of view, a value between 3 and 4 € per kg H2 for the LCOH of green hydrogen in Germany in 2030 seems realistic, which is in line with the statements of ref. 40–42. However, these values depend on the further development steps of the technologies and especially the electricity prices in 2030. In addition, political decisions can also have a lasting effect on the LCOH in the future in a correspondingly positive or negative direction. A price of 1 € per kg H2 is not to be expected for the production of green hydrogen in Germany. This value is rather to be expected for regions where a high capacity factor >70% can be realized, e.g., in Australia, South Africa or South America.22 However, if green hydrogen is sourced from these countries, transport costs for the transport to Germany will arise, which would significantly increase the LCOH of 1 € per kg H2.45 For 2050, from the author's point of view, a value between 2 and 3 € per kg H2 can be considered as realistic, which is in agreement with ref. 40 and 41. Provided that electricity costs can be reduced to 20–30 € per MWh, e.g. by targeted subsidies, values < 2 € per kg H2 in 2030 and 2050 are also possible. Then green hydrogen would be competitive to blue and grey hydrogen in any case, independent of natural gas prices.

3.3 LCOH compared to 2021 and at electricity prices of 0 € per MWh
In the next section, we will look at how the LCOH have changed compared to 2021 for the grid scenarios, as it is interesting to find out what impact the Ukraine war with the resulting exorbitantly increased electricity prices has on the LCOH, all other things being equal. Furthermore, we illustrate what happens if energy costs are assumed to be 0 € per MWh.

3.3.1 LCOH compared to 2021. 
The wholesale electricity price increased from 97 € per MWh (ref. 32) to 232 € per MWh (see above) from 2021 to 2022. This represents an increase of more than 139% and has a corresponding impact on the LCOH. Considering this price for the 4000 h, 6000 h, and 8000 h scenarios in 2021, the LCOH for AEL and PEMs have more than doubled, both for 10 MW (100.4–106.9%) and 100 MW plants (103–113.4%), except for PEMs_6000 h (97% increase, 10 MW). For a SOEC, the LCOH increased by only 77–85% (10 MW) and only 92–99% (100 MW), respectively, which is related to the much higher CAPEX that dampens the impact of sharply increased electricity prices on the LCOH. Overall, and regarding the question of how the LCOH has been affected by the enormous increase in wholesale electricity prices in 2022, it can be stated that the LCOH has more than doubled in some cases, and the increase in wholesale electricity prices from 2021 to 2022 had a significant impact on the LCOH, which is related to the fact that electricity costs are a major cost factor of the LCOH (see Fig. 3 and 4).


3.3.2 LCOH at electricity prices of 0 € per MWh. 
If electricity costs of 0 € per MWh are assumed, the LCOH also decreases significantly (see Fig. 7 and 8).
 Fig. 7  Comparison of LCOH with and without electricity costs (10 MW). 
 Fig. 8  Comparison of LCOH with and without electricity costs (100 MW). 
The LCOH decreases significantly if 0 € per MWh are considered, as can be seen in Table 7. All values refer to 10 MW plants. For the 100 MW plants, the results are lower with similar percentage changes. For the sake of overview, these values are listed in the ESI† together with the values for 10 MW plants. The figures demonstrate again that the cost of electricity is the largest component of the LCOH, as mentioned above (see Fig. 3 and 4).

Furthermore, it can be seen from the results that 2050's results for green hydrogen with 20–30 € per MWh electricity price (see Fig. 5 and 6) can already be achieved in the current scenario. The values range from 1.27 to 3.84 € per kg H2, with especially attractive values for the 6000 h scenario (1.60–2.74 € per kg H2) and for the 8000 h scenario (1.27–2.15 € per kg H2). The same is valid for the 6000 h and 8000 h values in 2030 and 2050, although these values are significantly lower than the values for the current scenario, as these values are only in the range between 0.47 and 0.82 € per kg H2 (2030) and 0.03–0.31 € per kg H2 (2050). Note that some negative values result due to the revenues for oxygen. For the 4000 h scenarios, the same values are obtained regardless of whether the electricity is supplied from the grid or directly from renewables. Overall, an electricity price of 0 € per MWh reduces the results by more than 71% (4000 h, 10 MW), 78% (6000 h, 10 MW), and 82% (8000 h, 10 MW), and more than 79% (4000 h, 100 MW), 84% (6000 h, 100 MW), and 87% (8000 h, 100 MW) for the grid scenarios, respectively. For the renewable energy scenario, these values are lower by more than 35% (10 MW) and 45% (100 MW) due to the lower electricity price. As the electricity price is the main driver of the LCOH, it is the starting point for targeted policy measures to promote hydrogen production in Germany and make it more attractive.

3.4 Comparison with results from other processes and studies
In the following section, the results are compared with the values of other processes for hydrogen production and the results from other studies for classification purposes.

3.4.1 Comparison with the results from other processes. 
The following processes are considered:
(1) coal gasification (CG) without carbon capture and storage,
(2) coal combustion (CC) with carbon capture and storage,
(3) authothermal methane reforming (ATR) of methane with carbon capture and storage.
When it comes to CG, coal is converted at high temperature into a syngas consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, among others. This syngas can be further processed by the water–gas shift reaction to produce more hydrogen. The cost of this process is about 1.34 USD per kg H2.48 The cost can be considered as very low compared to the results of this study and will only be reached in 2050 if the electricity price of renewable energy is 20 € per MWh, which seems unlikely for the future according to ref. 42, or if the electricity price for 2030 and 2050 is 0 € per MWh. Since the production process is also associated with high environmental impacts, it would make sense to introduce an environmental tax based on greenhouse gas emissions (as discussed above) in order to make this fossil-based hydrogen production process less economical and therefore less attractive. The same applies to the production of hydrogen in the coal combustion process, in which coal is only partially burned. In this process, carbon dioxide and heat are produced by the addition of oxygen. The carbon dioxide reacts further with the rest of the coal to form carbon monoxide, which reacts with the addition of heat and water via the water–gas shift reaction to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This process is similar to CG,53,54 but has a higher cost of 1.63 USD per kg H2.48 With respect to the results, the above applies here as well.
Regarding the ATR of methane, it is an alternative process to steam reforming, where natural gas is converted into a syngas – rich in hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide – under high pressure and temperature. The main difference between the two processes is that ATR uses oxygen directly for combustion, while steam reforming uses oxygen via air for the combustion process and thus for steam generation. Both processes are commonly used processes in the industry.55 The cost of ATR followed by carbon capture and storage is approximately $1.48 per kg H2,48 based on natural gas prices before 2022. As for CG and CC, this cost is only achieved in this study if the electricity price from renewables is 20 € per MWh or if the electricity price is 0 € per MWh (for 2030 and 2050). Provided that the natural gas price is at 2022's level, the costs increase by about 3–4 times, so that all 2030's and 2050's as well as all renewable values are competitive with the ATR process.
The alternative fossil fuel-based processes for hydrogen production cause a lower LCOH under normal conditions if energy costs do not increase exorbitantly due to external influences. Therefore, green hydrogen is not competitive due to high electricity prices. However, these processes either cause very high CO2 emissions (CG and CC) or are currently uneconomical (ATR), making green hydrogen a viable alternative, especially if the production costs of hydrogen from fossil fuels and the associated societal damage costs would be burdened by an environmental tax (see above).


3.4.2 Comparison with the results from other studies. 
Before comparing the results with those of other studies, the author would like to point out that the results are only comparable to a limited extent. The reason is that different assumptions and parameters have been made or taken into account. Therefore, considering different electricity prices can have a significant impact on the LCOH, as this parameter has a large share on the LCOH (see above).
Emam & Özcan conducted an extensive literature review on sustainable hydrogen production.9 The study includes values for the three main water electrolysis technologies (AEL, PEMs, and SOECs), while the focus is on the PEM technology. Regarding the results of the study, the values for hydrogen production from grid electricity range from 5.5–5.73 USD per kg H2 (AEL), 5.16–6.29 USD per kg H2 (PEM), and 4.95–6.03 USD per kg H2 (SOEC).9 These values are not reached for the grid scenarios in this study until 2030 due to the exorbitantly high electricity price in 2022. The assumed electricity prices for these values range from 57–70 USD per kW per h, well below the assumed grid electricity prices in this study. For green hydrogen from wind or solar energy – 7.47–9.1 USD per kg H2 (AEL, wind), 4.67–6.22 USD per kg H2 (PEM, wind), and 6.46–9.86 USD per kg H2 (SOEC, solar) – only the values for PEM (wind) are in the range of the study's value for the current scenario (4.69–5.18 € per kg H2).9 It should be mentioned that only the electricity price of PEM-wind of 60 USD per MWh is known.
Besides that, Yue et al. reported production costs of 3.2–5.2 € per kg H2 for AEL and 4.1–6 € per kg H2 for PEMs, excluding SOECs.16 Referring to these values, this range is only reached for the renewable energy scenario (current, 2030, and 2050) in this study (for 10 MW and 100 MW) – 2.57–5 € per kg H2 (AEL) and 2.48–5.18 € per kg H2 (PEM). Yue et al. did not specify from which source the electricity is obtained.16 It can therefore be only assumed that these values refer to green hydrogen. Compared to the values by Hofrichter et al. (0.7–13.5 € per kg H2)10 for PEMs from renewable sources, the value ranges by Yue et al. are very narrow.
Moreover, Bhandari & Shah published a value range between 1.8 and 7.56 € per kg H2 (PEM) and 1.8–8.81 € per kg H2 (AEL) for hydrogen not produced with grid electricity.8 Furthermore, the values for green hydrogen produced from wind and solar energy in ref. 48 range between 5.89 and 6.03 € per kg H2 (wind) and 5.78–23.27 € per kg H2 (solar), while the electrolysis technology is not specified in ref. 48. As can be seen, there are partly very large value ranges with respect to the LCOH in peer studies. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, a comparison with peer results is only possible to a limited extent, since other assumptions have been made and other parameters have been taken into account. Overall, however, it can be stated that the results of this study are in good agreement with the results from peer studies.

3.5 Sensitivity analysis
As already mentioned, the sensitivity analysis includes the parameters CAPEX, discount rate, electricity price, and plant efficiency. The results of the sensitivity analysis with ±20% are discussed below. The results can be found in the ESI.†

3.5.1 CAPEX. 
If the CAPEX are changed by ±20%, the impact on the LCOH is considered to be very small. For example, at +20%, the values for the grid scenarios only change by 1–5% (10 MW) and 1–3% (100 MW), while the values for the renewable energy scenario change by 2–10% (10 MW) and 3–8% (100 MW). For −20%, only the sign changes, not the values. It remains to be noted that a change in CAPEX has only a minor impact on the LCOH, due to the high share of electricity costs on the LCOH. This also applies if the electricity prices decrease in 2030 and 2050, as CAPEX also decrease due to technological progress.


3.5.2 Discount rate. 
The same as for CAPEX can be applied to the discount rate, where the values are even lower with 1–3% (10 MW) and 0.5–2% (100 MW). For the renewable energy scenario, values of 3–7% (10 MW) and 2–6% (100 MW) result. Again, only the sign changes, with a value of −20%. Overall, it can be stated that the change of the discount rate by ±20% has only a very small impact on the LCOH, just like the CAPEX.


3.5.3 Electricity price. 
In contrast to the CAPEX and the discount rate, a change of the electricity price by ±20% has a significant impact on the LCOH. In this context, the LCOH changes by 14–20% (10 MW), 16–20% (100 MW), and by 7–20% for the renewable energy scenario, with negative signs for −20%. Since electricity costs are the largest cost driver of the LCOH for scenarios with FLH ≥ 4000 h and a corresponding electricity price [20, Fig. 3 and 4], they should always be part of a sensitivity analysis.


3.5.4 Plant efficiency. 
Next to the electricity price, the plant efficiency has the largest impact on the LCOH. For example, a +20% increase in efficiency causes the LCOH to decrease by about 17%, while a 20% decrease in efficiency causes the LCOH to increase by 25%. The fact that the plant efficiency has a great influence on the LCOH is also confirmed by ref. 30. Since this parameter is associated with a high degree of uncertainty regarding future development and has a major influence on the LCOH, it should be considered with particular sensitivity.

Fig. 9 shows the visualisation of the results mentioned above.

4. Conclusion
Due to the fact that hydrogen will play an important role in the future energy supply of Germany, the LCOH of different hydrogen plants in Germany has been investigated in this study. For this, the three major water electrolysis technologies and different scenarios have been considered. The objectives of the study were to investigate (1) which hydrogen technology causes the lowest LCOH for the different scenarios and (2) which LCOH can be expected for green hydrogen in 2030 and 2050 if electricity prices are only 20 or 30 € per MWh and how do they compare to blue and grey hydrogen. Moreover, (3) how the increased wholesale electricity prices compared to those in 2021 affect the LCOH and (4) how they change if an electricity price of 0 € per MWh is assumed was also investigated in this study. In addition, (5) the results have been compared and classified with the generation costs of other processes as well as results from other studies. The study concludes that (1) the SOEC technology generates the lowest LCOH, except for the 4000 h_RE current scenario, and that (2) the LCOH at electricity prices of 20 and 30 € per MWh in 2030 and 2050 range between 1.33 and 2.88 € per kg H2 (30 € per MWh) and 0.95–2.39 € per kg H2 (20 € per MWh) for 10 and 100 MW plants, respectively, and are thus competitive to blue and grey hydrogen. Furthermore, (3) the LCOH has doubled or nearly doubled compared to that in 2021, while (4) the LCOH decreased by about 35–99% (10 MW) and 45–99.5% (100 MW) with even a negative LCOH in some cases at 0 € per MWh electricity price. Moreover, the results are in good agreement with those from other studies and are competitive with other processes – such as blue and grey hydrogen, ATR, and CG – at an electricity price of 20 € per MWh. Moreover, at an electricity price of 50 € per MWh in 2030, the LCOH for green hydrogen range between about 3 and 4 € per kg H2, which is in very good agreement with the literature values. However, these LCOH are not competitive with conventional manufacturing processes, as their LCOH are much lower at 1–2 € per kg H2, if special effects such as the exorbitant increase of the natural gas price in 2022 are excluded. However, conventional manufacturing processes cause much higher CO2 emissions due to the use of fossil fuels and thus societal damage costs in times of climate change. In this regard, the author sees two possibilities to reduce the LCOH of green hydrogen and to increase the LCOH of conventionally produced hydrogen, so that green hydrogen becomes more attractive. On the one hand, there is the possibility to use the subsidies of fossil fuels, which amounted to about 16 billion euros in 2021 and are difficult to justify in times of climate change, specifically to reduce the electricity prices for the production of green hydrogen. Then, the LCOH could be significantly reduced, since the electricity costs are the largest cost factor for FLH ≥ 4000 h. On the other hand, there is the possibility of introducing an environmental tax consisting of the difference in environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes monetised with environmental prices (= environmental costs), which is expected to be significant for conventional processes such as grey hydrogen at 13.3 kg CO2 per kg H2 compared to green hydrogen. The environmental tax would be levied on the generation costs and would sustainably promote the production of green hydrogen. These two points would have an important signal effect in times of climate change: firstly that fossil fuels would no longer be subsidised, and secondly that conventional generation processes of hydrogen would become more economically unattractive compared to green hydrogen by levying an environmental tax. This would promote sustainably produced hydrogen and also help to save large quantities of greenhouse gases, which would be beneficial in times of climate change.
5. Limitations
The data in this study are partly based on estimates and therefore subject to large uncertainties, which is why a sensitivity analysis has been conducted. However, not all uncertainties can be covered with a sensitivity analysis, such as the 139% increase in electricity price in 2022 compared to that in 2021 as an example. Furthermore, the SOEC technology has been considered in this study for the current scenario, although this technology has not yet reached market maturity. This has been done for comparison purposes and for completeness, so the results should be considered accordingly. The results stem from Zauner et al.30
