    , Accepted 3rd November 2020First published on 3rd November 2020AbstractThe performance of many emerging multinary chalcogenides for photovoltaic (PV) applications has been considerably inferior to the Shockley–Queisser limit, and one of the main reasons for this is the existence of various detrimental deep-level defects and defect clusters. Among them, the development of kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(Sx,Se1−x)4 (CZTCh) solar cells is currently hindered by a large open-circuit voltage deficit (Voc,def). Much of this Voc,def could be ascribed to the abundant cation disorder and defect clusters in the CZTSSe absorber layer, which is the origin of band-tail states caused by electrostatic potential fluctuations. To deal with the above intractable issues encountered in kesterite-like materials, a partial or complete cation substitution strategy offers a viable pathway to alter the characteristics of such deleterious defects and defects clusters, namely, (i) partial cation substitution can introduce ionic-size mismatch for alleviating antisite disorder and/or detrimental defect clusters to mitigate a large Voc,def and (ii) complete cation substitution can be expected to eliminate notorious band-tail states. This can foster the development/exploration of many emerging multinary chalcogenides beyond the kesterite-based CZTSSe for PV applications. In this review, we summarize the above recent efforts and attempts in both state-of-the-art experimental studies and gaining new theoretical insights to alleviate the problems associated with CZTSSe, as well as learn a lesson for applying to other promising chalcogenide PV materials. In addition, the record efficiencies for cation-substituted kesterite and related  chalcogenides PV devices reported till date have been summarized in this review. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided on the current research trends in relation to improving kesterite-based devices, as well as the exploration of related chalcogenides PV materials.Qingwen TianQingwen Tian received his PhD in Inorganic Chemistry from Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIAC), in 2015.

1. Introduction
Chalcogenide photovoltaic (PV) materials based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) and CdTe have gained considerable interest and made great progress in thin-film PV technologies, with lab-scale power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20%.1–6 However, these materials may ultimately be limited in their large-scale commercialization by the scarcity of In, Ga, and Te elements, as well as the negative environmental impacts of Cd.7–9 In this context, several nontoxic, cheap, and earth-abundant chalcogenides such as SnS,10,11 GeSe,12–14 Sb2(S,Se)3,15,16 CuSbSe2,17,18 Cu2SnS3,19etc. have been proposed for thin-film PV applications over the past few years, but their record efficiencies, i.e., below 10%, are far below those necessary for practical applications. Therefore, developing nontoxic and earth-abundant absorber materials for thin-film PV applications are critically needed to meet the requirements of both high-performance and stable, low-cost production.
In emerging thin-film PV materials, kesterite-based Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), and mixed-chalcogenide alloys (e.g., Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) denoted as CZTCh) have been considered as potential candidates for high-performance PV technology, because their constituent metals materials are nontoxic and earth abundant.20–22 In the past decade, kesterite-based solar cells have achieved a significant increase in PCE from the initial 0.66% to the current world record of 12.62% in 2019.23,24 However, despite this progress, the current record is just 0.02% higher than the value of 12.6% achieved in 2014. That is, the development of CZTSSe solar cells is going through obvious stagnation after more than a decade of in-depth research.25 Although CZTSSe and CIGSe are similar in structure and electronic properties, the record efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells is still significantly lower than that of CIGSe solar cells. There are many reasons for the performance gap between CZTSSe and CIGSe devices: (i) a possible undesirable band offset at the front CdS/CZTSSe heterointerface; (ii) the increased back-contact resistance and interfacial recombination from a thick MoS(Se)2 layer formed at the Mo–CZTSSe interface; and (iii) intrinsic point defects and associated band tailing as the key culprits behind the large open-circuit voltage deficit (Voc,def).8 As a multicomponent system, CZTSSe has more complicated point defects than those observed in Si or CdTe, including a variety of antisite, interstitial, and vacancy crystallographic point defects. On one hand, these defects in CZTSSe can restrict the transport of carriers; on the other hand, they play a key role in tuning the Fermi level and carrier concentrations for achieving p-type conductivity. In particular, the Cu–Zn and Sn–Zn disorders in the lattice are prevalent due to the similar ionic radii and coordination environments of Cu+, Zn2+, and Sn4+, which critically weaken the efficiency of carrier extraction. It is believed that the CZTSSe materials show a structural transition at a critical temperature of about 200 °C, and cationic disorder in the Cu–Zn sublattice is one of the primary causes of structural transition. The existence of Cu–Zn disorder in the sublattice of kesterite has been confirmed by a neutron diffraction technique. If cationic disorder is responsible for the main performance deficit in kesterite-based devices, then the alteration, control, and suppression of cationic disorder offer a prospective pathway for achieving high efficiency.
In this review, we summarize the progress achieved in both state-of-the-art experimental studies and gaining new theoretical insights into kesterite-based CZTSSe and fabricating multinary chalcogenides (, where M denotes metal and Ch, chalcogen); we mainly focused on the mitigation of the large Voc deficit resulting from these intrinsic point defects and associated band tailing encountered in the development of kesterite-based CZTSSe solar cells. To overcome the shortcomings of kesterite materials, research progress in many emerging multinary chalcogenides beyond kesterite-based CZTSSe in the past several years is also reviewed or discussed. Meanwhile, we summarized the single-junction record efficiencies for cation-substituted kesterite and derived -chalcogenide-based PV devices reported till date (Table 1). Finally, the shortcomings and outlook for future improvements in earth-abundant chalcogenide PV devices are described.

2. Problems and challenges
The primary obstacle that kesterite-based solar cells encounters is a high Voc deficit (Voc,def = Eg/q − Voc, where q is the elemental charge), preventing CZTSSe devices from achieving a higher PCE comparable to that of CIGSe, which has been unanimously observed in various reports.22,26–29 Even for the current record for CZTSSe devices, the Voc,def is larger than 0.58 eV,24 and this deficit has been recognized as the key reason for hampering further improvements in CZTSSe device performance. A large number of experimental and theoretical studies have shown abundant intrinsic point defects, defect clusters, and associated band tailing as the main culprits for this large Voc,def.8,21,26,30–34 The multielement nature of kesterite-based CZTSSe leads to multiple possibilities for antisite, vacancy, and interstitial defects. In particular, Cu–Zn antisite defects are ubiquitous in the kesterite structure owing to the similar ionic radii and chemical character of Cu+ and Zn2+. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that Cu–Zn antisite defects in the kesterite structure have a lower defect formation energy than that for copper vacancy (VCu) (Fig. 1a and b).31–33 Even worse, as shown in Fig. 1b, the ionization level of CuZn antisite is about 100–200 meV higher than the valence band maximum (VBM), which is far higher than VCu (about 20 meV above VBM), indicating that CuZn is a deep defect.20 This kind of antisite defect is not easy to form in chalcopyrite-based CIGSe due to the larger chemical disparity between Cu and In/Ga. It has been believed that the formation of Cu–Zn disorders and related charge-compensated defect clusters such as CuZn + ZnCu can cause electrostatic potential fluctuations, which are the origin of the band-tail states (Fig. 1c and d). Such band-tail states can impose restrictions on the possible light-induced separation and increase the probability of carrier recombination, which subsequently reduce the Voc and Jsc. The EU in these compounds can be estimated to be above 50 meV (Fig. 1e), suggesting that even in the radiative limit, qVoc is predicted to be much lower than qVSQoc (where VSQoc is the Voc of a solar cell in the SQ limit and EU is the Urbach energy).35 These defects, namely, CuZn and VCu, have also been observed within similar transition energies in some relevant experimental reports.36–39 For example, Khadka et al.39 investigated the admittance spectra (AS) of their champion CZTSe device and revealed three electronic states for defects corresponding to the step features observed in the C-F-T result (Fig. 1f). According to previous theoretical calculations,32 their observed defects with the trap energy levels of Et1 = 118 meV and Et3 = 19 meV can be attributed to CuZn (−/0) and VCu (−/0), respectively. Finally, the AS results show defects at 19 (VCu), 58 (unknown), and 118 meV (CuZn) with integrated defect densities estimated to be 1.99 × 1015, 2.21 × 1015, and 3.26 × 1015 cm−3, respectively.

Reproduced with permission.46 Copyright 2009, American Physical Society. 
However, recent experiments and calculated results have revealed that the Cu–Zn disorder is not directly responsible for the band-tail states.27,40–42 Among these studies, Rey et al.41 demonstrated that the defect clusters, 2CuZn + SnZn, have a great impact on the bandgap fluctuations and band-edge energy. Besides, Ma et al.43 also proposed that the origin of the band-tail states is indeed related to SnZn-based defect clusters such as 2CuZn + SnZn (Fig. 1g). Hybrid DFT results also showed that SnZn and SnCu antisites also act as recombination centers with defect states, which can introduce high density of nonradiative recombination centers.44,45 These results highlight that all these cation–cation disorders and defect clusters increase the Voc,def and undermine the performance of CZTSSe-related solar cells.
Obviously, it is an essential input to deal with the intractable problems encountered in the development of kesterite-based solar cells. Hence, the suppression or removal of related antisite defects and clusters provides a prospective pathway to achieve high efficiency, comparable to those obtained in mature CIGSe solar cells. In addition, as a prototypical example of  chalcogenide materials, the calculated band structure of the band compositions and its schematic depiction for kesterite-based CZTS are shown in Fig. 1h and i.46 In terms of alleviating the point defects and associated clusters on the sublattice, one appealing strategy is to adopt isovalent cation substitutions. In this method, metal cations in kesterite can be partially or completely substituted with other isovalent cations, which can alter the formation energy of point defects.47 Suitable cation substitution in the kesterite host is regarded as one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of PV materials (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows a schematic of some sections of the periodic table, including the most interesting recent metal elements for substitution. Indeed, numerous experimental results have shown the beneficial effects of complete or partial cation substitution on a significant improvement in device performance: Cu1+ by other group IA or IB (Ag1+, Li1+) cations; Zn2+ by group IIA, IIB, or VIIB (Cd2+, Ba2+, Mn2+) cations; and Sn4+ by group IVA (Ge4+) cations.48–58 In addition, first-principles calculations revealed some other elements with +1, +2, +4, and −2 valences, such as Zn2+ with group IIA (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+) cations, Sn4+ with group IVB (Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+) cations, and S2− with group VIA (O2−, Te2−) anions. The above partial or complete substitution can produce many new  chalcogenides, and these compounds have high potential for PV applications in the future.60,61 Meanwhile, this cation substitution strategy can offer some more promising possibilities to deal with the high Voc deficit problems encountered in kesterite development. Therefore, the extended exploration of more multinary chalcogenides to further expand the alternative material of PV absorber layers is still significant.

3. Progress review
3.1 Cu-site substitution

3.1.1 Ag substitution for Cu. 
The partial or total substitution of Ag for Cu in CZTSSe system has been employed to suppress the formation of CuZn, with the aid of the larger radius of Ag+ (1.14 Å) with respect to Cu+ (0.74 Å) (Table 2). Even though this substitution approach, in principle, is feasible, its efficacy is still questionable. One theoretical study confirmed the potential of Cu substitution by Ag, revealing a fundamental disparity between the defect physics of CZTS and AZTS.62 The results show that the formation energy of the acceptor defect AgZn is larger than those of the other three donor defects (ZnAg, SnZn, and VS), making Ag2ZnSnS4 exhibit n-type conductivity due to the very low concentration of AgZn (Fig. 3a). From the calculated transition energy levels of defects (Fig. 3b), AgZn has a deeper acceptor level than those of CuZn and CuCd. While ZnAg has a relatively shallow level compared with the other donor defects (SnZn and VS), it plays a dominant role in determining the characteristic of n-type conductivity. It is expected that cation disordering and the associated band tailing can be effectively inhibited by Ag substitution for Cu in the CZTSSe system. They also proposed a strategy to decrease Voc,def by fabricating a composition-graded (Cu1–xAgx)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CAZTSSe) absorber layer, resulting in large band bending near the CdS/CAZTSSe junction interface, and therefore, the Voc can be improved.

Inspired by these encouraging theoretical results, many efforts have been devoted toward developing AZTS, AZTSe, and alloyed CAZTSSe as an absorber layer for solar cells.48,49,54,63–70 The experimental results observed by Wu et al.63 showed that a change in the conduction type of the alloyed (Cu1−xAgx)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 film from p to n occurred with an increased Ag doping level from 0 to 0.5 (Fig. 3c), thereby agreeing with a previous theoretical prediction.62 Gershon et al.54 investigated the fundamental properties of mixed CAZTSSe compound with different Ag doping levels. As the Ag content increased, an obvious bandgap shift to higher values is observed, as shown in Fig. 3d. Evidently, the (Eg − EPL) value reduces from ∼110 meV (for pure CZTSe) to ∼0 meV in the case of a pure AZTSe material, suggesting that the band-tailing problem, which is the primary cause of Voc loss in kesterite devices, is significantly suppressed in Ag-doped CAZTSSe samples. Following this work, they reported over 5.0% efficiency in pure Ag2ZnSnSe4 (AZTSe) solar cells based on a novel FTO/AZTSe/MoO3/ITO/Ni/Al architecture (Table 1 and Fig. 3e), which also demonstrated that AZTSe is indeed an n-type absorber material and has a smaller bulk band-tailing parameter than that in the CZTSSe compound.48 More recently, Qi et al.65 used acetate as the starting material in the precursor solution, affording large grains through the entire absorber layer. A champion cell with 11.32% efficiency was fabricated, which can be attributed to the optimal absorber layer with decreased trap density, extended depletion width, and reduced charge recombination process (Fig. 3f). In the available reports, the highly efficient solar cells could only be realized with a relatively low Ag doping level [Ag/(Ag + Cu) = 1–20%];49,52,64,67–72 therefore, the suppression of CuZn antisite defects might not be completely achieved with a low Ag content. To effectively resolve the abovementioned issues, Huang et al.66 tried to increase the Ag content in CAZTSSe and investigate the effects of higher Ag content [Ag/(Ag + Cu) > 20%] on the phase stability, crystal structure, and defect properties. In order to obtain a compact and densely packed morphology, as well as avoid the formation of secondary phases, it is necessary to reduce the selenization temperature for a high-Ag-content CAZTSSe film (Fig. 3g). They concluded that the inferior performance of CAZTSSe devices with a high Ag content can be ascribed to the poor junction quality resulting from unpassivated defects at the interface as well as grain boundaries (GBs). Therefore, the passivation of the interface as well as the redesign of the device structure can be the key issues for high-Ag-content solar cells in the future.


3.1.2 Li substitution for Cu. 
Doping with alkali elements has been inherited from the predecessor chalcopyrite CIGS solar cells, which has exhibited a significant positive impact on kesterite-based devices. To date, Li,73–79 Na,80–86 K,74,87–89 Rb,74,87 and Cs74,87 have been extensively investigated. Among them, the Li+ substitution for Cu+ in CZTSSe films has been demonstrated by several groups.73,76–78 Xin et al.73 reported that Li doping in CZTSSe films can change the polarity of the electric field at the GBs. The potential maps and corresponding line scans of the CZTSSe films with and without Li doping as obtained from the scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) data are shown in Fig. 4a. For the non-Li-doped film, an obvious positive peak in the contact potential difference (CPD) at the GBs was observed. This positive peak can be attributed to the local accumulation of positive charges at the GB, leading to the formation of an electric field that facilitates electron collection through the GBs, which is favorable for device performance. However, after Li doping, a reversal in the electrostatics at the GBs was observed in the higher-performing Li-doped films (Fig. 4a). They concluded that the introduction of Li could modify the local defects in the CZTSSe films, resulting in upward band bending (Fig. 4b); this has proven to be conducive to the device performance by forming a barrier for the minority carrier electrons to cross into the GBs.

It is not clear whether Li is introduced into the lattice or is scattered at the GB. Yang et al.76 clearly demonstrated, for the first time, that Cu+ ions in CZTSSe films can be substituted with Li+, forming a homogeneous alloyed Cu2−xLixZnSn(S,Se)4 (CLZTSSe) materials (Fig. 4c). Unlike Na+ and K+ ions, Li+ ions have a very weak effect on promoting the grain growth of CLZTSSe films in their experiments. They also found that the conduction band minimum (CBM) and VBM decreased with an increase in the Li doping level, which resulted in a tunable bandgap and conduction band offset (CBO) that makes it possible to enhance the Voc of the CLZTSSe device (Fig. 4d). The secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) results showed that Li+ ions are homogeneously distributed in the large-grain layer, similar to that observed in other metal elements (Fig. 4e). The abovementioned results are based on a sodium-free substrate (quartz substrate with SiO2 content of 99.99%) of CLZTSSe solar cells. However, when a sodium-rich soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate was used in the same experiments, only trace amounts of Li were detected in the selenized CLZTSSe film; meanwhile, a large amount of sodium can be found to be distributed on the surface and at the GBs of the selenized thin films. They attributed this fact to the occurrence of an exchange of Li with Na diffusing from the SLG substrate to the surface and GBs of the selenized films.77
However, a first-principles study by Maeda et al.90 proposed that Li+ in stoichiometric CZTSe films has small substitution and migration energies, and the presence of VCu further reduces the migration energy of Li+. They concluded that Li+ ions are expected to migrate into the VCu instead of replacing Cu. To further understand the effects of Li incorporation into the CZTSSe absorber layer on the grain growth and device performance, Cabas-Vidani et al.78 synthesized a series of alloyed CLZTSSe absorber layers with a lithium fraction of Li/(Li + Cu) ranging from x = 0 to 0.12. Contrary to previous reports,73,76 an obvious improvement in grain growth can be observed via the incorporation of Li (Fig. 4f); this can be ascribed to the fluxing effect of the Li2Se phase that is liquid during the first annealing stage,91 which is consistent with that reported for the fluxing Na2Sex phases.92 Meanwhile, the previous Li/Na cation-exchange reaction reported by Yang et al.76 is not observed in their case. Most of the Li loss in the final film can be attributed to the redissolution of soluble Li salts in DMSO during the subsequent spin-coating process, as shown in Fig. 4g. The discrepancy in the experimental results might be caused by the variations in the measurement methods and/or the different solvent systems. In addition, a significant increase in the apparent carrier concentration is observed from 3 × 1015 cm−3 for the sample without Li doping up to 5 × 1016 cm−3 for the doped sample with x = 0.07. The authors believed that the formation of ZnCu donor defects is suppressed by the migration of Li+ ions into the VCu, resulting in a decrease in compensation and increase in hole concentration. A champion device with 11.6% efficiency (12.2% active area) was achieved based on this effective Li-alloy strategy (Table 1 and Fig. 4h), very close to the highest recorded value of 12.62%. Although the beneficial effects of Li doping in kesterite-based solar cells were observable, it is necessary for developing an alternative solution chemistry to decrease Li loss in the future.

3.2 Zn-site substitution

3.2.1 Cd substitution for Zn. 
To reduce the disorder in the Cu–Zn sublattice, Cd2+ (0.92 Å, with an ionic radius larger than that of Zn2+ (0.74 Å); Table 2) is employed as a promising isoelectronic substitution for Zn in the kesterite structure. In this sense, this method is feasible in principle, but whether it is efficient is still a question worth discussing. The theoretical DFT calculations diverge with this expectation.62 By comparing the formation energy when μCu = μCd = 0, the value of CuCd (1.28 eV) is actually equal to that of VCu. The calculated results show that the formation energies of CdCu and CuCd antisites in CCTS are very close to the case of CuZn, suggesting that the full or partial substitution of Cd for Zn in CZTS(Se) has no remarkable effects on the alleviation of antisite defects (CuCd).62 Besides, the transition energy level of CuCd is deep and the band-edge shifting due to the related defects is also as severe as that of CZTS(Se) (Fig. 5a and b).

Indeed, some experimental reports have demonstrated a significant performance improvement in CZTS or CZTCh devices via the introduction of Cd2+.93–96 Su et al.93 introduced Cd2+ into the CZTS system to partially replace Zn to fabricate a homogenous CZCTS film, thereby significantly increasing the device efficiency from 5.30% to 9.24% with an appropriate ratio of Zn/Cd (x = 0.4). Meanwhile, a phase transition is observed from I4-kesterite to I2m-stannite when Cd substitution for Zn exceeds 60% (x = 0.6–1.0) (Fig. 5c). Based on this previous research of Cd alloying, more recently, a novel device structure comprising glass/Mo/Cd-alloyed CZTS/CdS/ITO has been designed, where i-ZnO is omitted for better indium diffusion; a post-annealing process is subsequently performed for the entire device.50 It is observed that this post-annealing process can not only improve the performance of ITO films, but also tune the electron- and hole-doping concentrations in the p–n junction, simultaneously regulating the band alignment for better carrier transport.
Finally, an excellent efficiency of 12.60% for pure-sulfide-based kesterite devices could be realized (Table 1).50 Moreover, the introduction of Cd in a CZTS absorber can remarkably improve the undesirable band-tailing issue, minority lifetime, and electrical properties, which has been demonstrated by Yan et al.;96 Cd-alloyed pure-sulfide-based CZCTS solar cells with efficiency in excess of 11% have been achieved (Fig. 5e). In kesterite-based solar cells, the main performance-limiting point defects could be ascribed to the Cu–Zn antisite, CuZn + ZnCu, as well as the deep-defect-level-inducing Sn antisite, 2CuZn + SnZn. Interestingly, Sun et al.97 prepared a Cd-alloyed CZTSSe film by simultaneously selenizing a CZTS precursor with a CdS buffer layer. Cd incorporation in the bulk in addition to a higher Cd content near the absorber surface were observed. The results showed that the trap energy levels and density of the Cd-alloyed sample were 38 meV and 1.47 × 1016 cm−3, respectively, while the corresponding values for the reference film were 118 meV and 6.98 × 1015 cm−3, as shown in Fig. 5f. The Cd-alloyed film exhibits slightly higher hole concentration, resulting in a lower Fermi level contributing to a higher Voc. As a consequence, the highest efficiency of 11.2% for Cd-alloyed CZTSSe solar cells could be achieved (Fig. 5g).
Recently, Hadke et al.98 fully replaced Zn with Cd in CZTS in a Cu-poor composition, which can not only significantly suppress the formation of deleterious deep-trap-level-inducing defect clusters (such as CuZn + SnZn and 2CuZn + SnZn), but also relieve bandgap fluctuations. The proposed suppression of deep 2CuZn + SnZn can be validated by a higher PL yield and longer PL decay time at the optimal Cu/[Cd + Sn] ratios (Fig. 5h). Based on this strategy, a pure CCTS device with 7.96% active-area efficiency is obtained, which is the highest PCE among fully cation-substituted CZTCh-based absorbers till date (Table 1). Summarily, preliminary developments have positioned Cd substitution as a very promising route for moderating disorder-inducing antisites and reducing the Voc deficit of kesterite, and it could even be employed in the future to implement popular interfacial engineering and bandgap grading.
Another appealing strategy for alleviating the detrimental antisite defects and defect clusters is to investigate materials where a combination of Cu and Zn is partially substituted by a combination of elements that are chemically less similar but retain the same valence. Recently, Hadke et al.47 explored the effects of double cation substitution on pure-sulfide CZTS by partially substituting Cu with Ag and Zn with Cd, thereby forming complex (Cu,Ag)2(Zn,Cd)SnS4 (CAZCTS) compounds. In their research, normalized TRPL was employed to qualitatively compare the effects of Ag and Cd on the carrier lifetimes of the different component films (Fig. 6a). They observed that Cd incorporation played a leading role in improving the PL decay time, which is closely related to the improvement in the minority carrier lifetime, leading to an improvements in Voc and Jsc.99,100 The depth of acceptor defects (in terms of Eg − EPL) is plotted as a function of the Cd content in the films, as shown in Fig. 6b; the Eg − EPL is the difference between the bandgap and PL peak of the measured materials. It is observed that Cd incorporation alters the position of the acceptor defects near the valence band, and the shallowest defects are achieved at 30% Cd substitution, which is consistent with the maximum device performance obtained at this Cd content. Further investigations showed that Ag incorporation in this compound could not only effectively decrease the charge carrier density but also reduce nonradiative bulk recombinations. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the double cation substitution approach, a total area efficiency of 10.1% was obtained at a composition of 5% Ag + 25% Cd of (Cu0.95Ag0.05)2(Zn0.75Cd0.25)SnS4 (Table 1).

Interestingly, complex (Cu1−xAgx)1.85(Zn0.8Cd0.2)1.1SnS4 monograin powders with different Ag doping levels were successfully synthesized by Timmo et al.101 The shape and surface morphology of monograin powder crystals is shown in Fig. 6c, exhibiting a tetragonal shape with sharp edges. They achieved a PCE of 8.73% by using 1%-Ag- and 20%-Cd-substituted CAZCTS monograin powders as the absorber materials in solar cells based on a graphite/CAZCTS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ag/glass structure. Evidently, a significant increase in the PL intensity was observed in the Ag-doped materials compared with the reference (Fig. 6d). The obtained results show that a very low Ag doping level (x = 1%) is beneficial to the performance of CAZCTS solar cells, but it is detrimental at higher levels; further, the acceptor concentration in the complex CAZCTS absorber can be modified by adjusting the Ag doping levels.


3.2.2 Alkali-earth metals substitution for Zn. 
Recent efforts aimed at altering the antisite defects characteristics (CuZn, ZnCu, and SnZn) is to seek another distant element substitution. Group II elements, such as Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, may be promising substitutions for Zn site to eliminate cation disordering due to a larger size and electronic properties mismatch with Cu and Sn.8,20,102 Among them, earth-abundant Ba2+ (1.49 Å) and Sr2+ (1.32 Å) with larger ionic radii than that of Cu+ (0.74 Å) and Sn4+ (0.69 Å), as listed in Table 2, are expected to be desirable isoelectronic substitutions for Zn. Hong et al.102 proposed that trigonal Cu2–MII–Sn–Ch4 (MII = Ba, Sr; and Ch = S, Se) quaternary compounds are similar to kesterite CZTCh devices with regard to electronic and optical properties, which could be potential candidates for PV and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting applications. In particular, the high formation energies of Cu–Ba/Sr and Sn–Br/Sr antisite defects are higher than that of VCu, and the main point defect in Cu2BaSn(S,Se)4 (CBTSSe) and Cu2SrSn(S,Se)4 (CSTSSe) systems is VCu as a shallow acceptor, which is highly similar to the case of high-efficiency CIGSe materials.20,102
In the last few years, CBTS- and CBTSSe-related compounds have been extensively investigated.103–113 The trigonal pure-sulfide-based Cu2BaSnS4 (CBTS) is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor resulting from Cu deficiency, with a space group of either P31, P3121, or P3221,114–116 and it has recently attracted extensive research attention. Although the wide bandgap of CBTS (∼2.0 eV) is not ideal as an absorber for single-junction solar cells,117,118 it is competent as a top cell in a tandem solar cells and solar-driven water-splitting devices.114,120 According to the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit, the highest theoretical efficiency of ∼22% could be achieved for a CBTS-based single-junction solar cell (bandgap: ∼2 eV). If CBTS is used as a top cell stacked with an Si (Eg ≈ 1.1 eV) bottom cell, the total efficiency (PCE) of the tandem device would be significantly improved to ∼34%, surpassing the value for the corresponding single-junction solar cells.119 In 2017, Ge et al.120 reported a pure-CBTS-based solar cell with sputtered CdS/CdS:O buffer layers, affording a slightly higher PCE of 2.03% (Table 1), which demonstrated that CBTS was a promising top-cell absorber in tandem solar devices.
Xiao et al.121 further investigated the defect characteristics of orthorhombic CBTSe using DFT calculations, and the calculated charge-state transition levels are shown in Fig. 7a and b. Evidently, most of the dominant Ba-related defects (VBa, Bai, BaCu, CuBa, and BaSe) exhibit shallow defect transition levels due to high ionicity. Owing to the discrepancy in size and electronic properties, they found that the formation energies of CuBa and BaCu antisite defects are much higher than the CuZn- and ZnCu-related antisite defects in CZTSSe under both Cu-poor and Cu-rich synthesis conditions. These results strongly imply that the notorious cation disorder and band tailing in this system could be effectively mitigated. In 2016, Shin et al.117 reported the first prototype solar cell based on CBTS with 1.62% efficiency using a common device structure analogous to that of a CZTSSe-based solar cell. In their results, the relatively sharp cutoff in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and narrow PL peak width suggest that band tailing may not be a critical issue in this improved system.26,117 The smaller red-shift in the PL peak (2.03 eV) relative to the bandgap (2.04 eV) in the CBTS film is only ∼10 mV compared with that for the CZTSSe film (100 mV), which provides further evidence of a lower level of cation disorder and band tailing in this system.26 By developing a successive sulfurization/selenization process to incorporate Se into the sulfide films, Shin et al.122 successfully reduced the bandgap to a more suitable value (∼1.55 eV) for single-junction solar cells. They also obtained an abrupt cutoff in the EQE curve, coupled with a narrow PL peak centered at a wavelength close to the bandgap determined from the EQE inflection point, suggesting relatively low levels of band tailing in the trigonal CBTSSe films, which is consistent with the pure-sulfide-based device.117 Encouragingly, a CBTSSe-based solar cell with 5.2% efficiency could be achieved (Table 1), which demonstrated a >2.5-fold PCE improvement in this family after only one year.122

According to the results obtained by Wang et al.,59 the kesterite-structured CBTS is not thermodynamically stable and cannot form a stable region in the chemical potential space. They predicted that CBTS would spontaneously decompose into some binary and ternary compounds (e.g., Cu2S, CuS, BaS, SnS2, SnS, and Cu2SnS3). However, Xiao et al.121 suggested that there is a large chemical potential window that can thermodynamically stabilize orthorhombic-structured CBTSe. A polyhedron region surrounded by the thermodynamic equilibrium planes of elemental as well as binary- and ternary-compounds is shown in Fig. 7c. Evidently, CBTSe has a much larger chemical potential window than that of the previously reported CZTSe,32,45 indicating that pure-selenide CBTSe should have better thermodynamic stability than CZTSe.
As an analog compound of CBTS, Cu2SrSnS4 (CSTS) has also been reported by a very few research groups in the last few decades.124–129 As early as 1976, Teske was the first to report a trigonal CBTS compound synthesized from a mixture of three binary sulfides at 620–700 °C (space group P31).123 In 2001, Llanos et al.124 investigated the optical and electrical properties of the trigonal phases of CSTS and Cu2SrGeS4 (CSGS) using diffuse reflectance spectra and electrical conductivity. The bandgaps of CSTS and CSGS were estimated to be 2.1 and 2.9 eV, respectively, indicating that both the compounds were classified as semiconductor materials. Following the recent computational results, Crovetto et al.126 prepared the trigonal CSTS films by the sulfurization of Cu-poor co-sputtered Cu2SrSnO4 precursors. It was found that the electronic properties, bandgap, absorption coefficient, and PL emission exhibited high similarities with previously reported CBTS films, as expected by the first-principles calculations.102 In order to evaluate the PV characteristics of CSTS films, they fabricated a prototype single-junction solar cells based on CSTS absorbers with a well-known device structure similar to CZTS, yielding efficiencies of up to 0.59% (Table 1). More recently, Xiao et al.127 obtained p-type CSTS thin films with a trigonal structure by using a 2-methoxyethanol/lactic acid-based solution process. Compared with kesterite-based CZTS, CSTS has a wider bandgap (1.93 eV) and is an attractive alternative top cell for tandem PV and PEC cells. The potential of CSTS-based PEC cells has also been investigated. A PEC device employing a CSTS film as the working electrode was fabricated, which yielded a saturated photocurrent of ∼0.5 mA cm−2, which is much inferior than that of a pure CBTS system (5 mA cm−2), as reported by Ge et al.129 As a new material, preliminary studies on CSTS devices appear to be less undermined by cation disordering and band-tailing issues. Higher performance can be expected by employing a more suitable heterojunction partner than CdS, which may result in higher Voc, as already demonstrated in CBTS-based solar cells.120
Zhu et al.130 recently expanded on the CBTSSe paradigm by computationally screening 16 quaternary compounds, denoted as  (MI = Cu, Ag; MII = Sr, Ba; MIV = Ge, Sn; Ch = S, Se) for their possible utility as earth-abundant and environmentally friendly thin-film PV absorbers. In accordance with the calculated results, four pure  compounds have great potential as particularly promising candidates for thin-film PV applications based on the overall comparison of the band structures of the 16 compounds (Fig. 8). Cu2BaSnS4 (P31; I/D: 1.74/1.75 eV) and Cu2BaGeSe4 (P31; I/D: 1.60/1.61 eV) have quasi-direct bandgaps, while Cu2BaSnSe4 (Ama2; D: 1.50 eV) and Cu2SrSnSe4 (Ama2; D: 1.46 eV) have direct bandgaps. In contrast to the Cu-containing compounds, it is observed that all Ag-based compounds (which belong to space groups I222 or I2m) show indirect bandgaps with bandgap values within 0.66–1.38 eV.

More recently, Sun et al.131 proposed that a new tolerance factor approach based on ionic radii, akin to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor for perovskites,132 could be expected to aid in rationalizing the current structures and predicting new members of the defect-resistant  materials, which can greatly facilitate the discovery of a multitude of novel defect-resistant semiconducting and energy-related structures. They found that all the 31 experimentally reported  quaternary compounds could form within five crystal structure types, as shown in Fig. 9, all of which possess two vital structural characteristics: (i) an obviously larger MII atom (such as Ba) taking nontetrahedral coordination and (ii) a three-dimensional (3D) extended network composed of metal (I/IV)-chalcogen (S or Se) tetrahedra. Based on the similarity of these crystal structures, they derived a set of tolerance factors that could be applied as descriptors for material discovery and phase stability within this family. Using this tolerance factor tool, they successfully predicted four new  compounds, namely, Ag2BaSiS4, Ag2PbSiS4, Cu2PbGeS4, and Cu2SrSiS4, that could be synthesized with the predicted structure types. This tool may act as a guide to researchers in the search for new defect-resistant semiconducting materials for solar energy applications in the future.

To counter the antisites within the kesterite structure, Ca2+ (1.14 Å) with a larger ionic radius than those of Cu+ (0.74 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å), as well as similar to those of Ag+ (1.14 Å) and Cd2+ (0.92 Å) in coordination environments (Table 2), is initially expected to be a favorable isovalent substitution for Zn. However, the DFT calculation results by Berman et al.133 failed to live up to these expectations. The formation energies of both CaZn and CaCu (Zn) defects are as high as ∼1.13 and 2.26–2.45 eV, respectively, indicating that Ca substitution for Zn is very difficult under low doping conditions. The ionic radius of Ca2+ (1.14 Å) is larger than that of Cd2+ (0.92 Å); therefore, it shows a significantly higher formation energy for the isovalent CaZn antisite (∼1.13 eV) than that of the corresponding CdZn (∼0.12 eV).84 As a result, the incorporation of Ca in the kesterite structure is harder than that in Cd (CdZn) due to the combined electrostatic and steric effects.133 Additionally, the higher concentrations of Ca doping in CZTS are not thermodynamically stable, which spontaneously decompose and form other secondary phases (CaS and Cu2SnS3). In short, they suggest that Ca doping in the CZTS system is not an ideal pathway to mitigate the Cu–Zn antisite defects.
In 2015, Zhong et al.134 investigated the effects of larger Ca2+ and Mg2+ substitution for Zn2+ (Cu2CaSnCh4 and Cu2MgSnCh4; Ch = S and Se) on the electronic, optical, and thermodynamic stability properties using the first-principles calculations with the HSE hybrid functional approach. Unfortunately, the results suggest that the Ca-based Cu2CaSnS4 and Cu2CaSnSe4 compounds are not thermodynamically stable, while the Mg-based materials (Cu2MgSnS4 and Cu2MgSnSe4) are thermodynamically stable; further, the ground-state configuration would change from the kesterite into stannite configuration when Zn atoms are substituted by larger Mg atoms, which seems to contradict Wang's calculation results.59 They concluded that Wang et al.59 failed to include all the related phases, and only focused on the kesterite phase, to explore the thermodynamic stability. In addition, the bandgaps of Cu2MgSnS4 (CMTS) and Cu2MgSnSe4 (CMTSe) were calculated to be 1.80 and 1.16 eV, respectively, which are correspondingly larger than those of CZTS and CZTSe. As reported, the CBM is mainly affected by the mixture of Sn-5s and S-3p (Se-4p) electronic states, while the VBM is governed by the hybridization of the Se-4p (S-3p) and Cu-3d states.61 In Zhong's result, the projected density of states (PDOS) also shows that the substitution of Zn2+ with Mg2+ cannot contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi level, and it does not affect the nature of the valence and conduction bands. Therefore, the substitution of Zn2+ with Mg2+ should not expand the bandgap value, which is not consistent with the small increase in the bandgap in Mg-based materials. Zhong et al.134 attributed this fact to the enhancement in the interaction between Sn and S (Se) induced by the bond-length shortening compared with the Zn-based materials. Their calculated results suggest that Mg-based materials (CMTS and CMTSe) can prove to be suitable candidates for use as efficient PV materials based on their appropriate electronic structures and optical properties.
Recently, Yang et al.135 presented the first report on the PV effects of CMTS materials. The CMTS thin films were prepared using a nontoxic spin-coating method via sulfurization. The solar cell with the structure of glass/Mo/CMTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al was fabricated as a proof of concept, yielding a PCE of 0.78% for the best device achieved at an optimal sulfurization temperature of 530 °C (Table 1). Guo et al.136 proposed a simple and low-cost route to fabricate a CMTS thin film using a novel dual-source ultrasonic co-spray method. The calculated bandgap for the CMTS was 1.76 eV, which is close to the optimum value as an efficient top cell for tandem PV devices. The Hall effect measurements show that the CMTS film has a high resistivity of 1.412 × 10−1 Ω cm and had p-type conductivity.


3.2.3 Transition metal substitution for Zn. 
Recent studies regarding alloying with the partial/full Ag+ substitution for the Cu+ and Cd2+ substitution for Zn2+ have made great progress in suppressing cation disorder, improving crystallinity, inhibiting secondary phases (such as ZnS), adjusting bandgap, or their combination, which have significantly enhanced the device performance. However, the abovementioned commonly reported substitutes, namely, Ag+ and Cd2+, are not ideal as they adversely affect the nontoxicity and earth abundance of kesterite materials. Therefore, several earth-abundant transition metals such as Mn, Fe, Ni, and Co as substitute alternatives for Zn have been investigated due to the Cu2MIISnCh4 (MII = Mn, Fe, Ni, and Co; Ch = S and Se) structure being similar to that of CZTSSe materials.137–139 All these semiconducting materials are made up of earth-abundant elements, exhibit suitable bandgaps, and afford a high light absorption coefficient, which can, therefore, be applied for the potential PV candidates.140
3.2.3.1 Manganese (Mn) substitution for Zn. 
The ionic radius of Mn2+ (0.80 Å) is larger than that of Cu+ (0.74 Å) (Table 2). Obviously, the larger ionic size difference can reduce the cation disorder in Cu2MSn(S,Se)4-based materials.141,142 Cu2MnSnS4 (CMnTS) is a p-type semiconductor with a stannite structure and ferromagnetic properties, which is considered to be a promising PV material due to its suitable direct bandgap and excellent absorption coefficient similar to those for kesterite.143,144 Some recent studies focusing on CMnTS materials have reported the PV performance. However, their performances are still very poor.145–148 In 2015, using a simple and nontoxic spin-coating technique, Chen et al.,148,149 for the first time, fabricated CMnTS solar cells with 0.49% efficiency, yielding a Voc of 308.4 mV, Jsc of 4.70 mA cm−2, and FF of 33.9%. Prabhakar et al.150 also reported the CMnTS and Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4 (CMnTSSe) thin-film solar cells fabricated from a low-cost spray pyrolysis technique in the ambient atmosphere using water as the solvent. It has been observed that the crystal structures of Mn-based materials could be indexed to the tetragonal phase (space group I2m). A CMnTS solar cell (efficiency of 0.73%) with the glass/Mo/Na-CMnTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Ag structure was fabricated by incorporating Na into the CMnTS absorber layer during the spray process. This Na incorporation in the CMnTS film can not only improve the grain growth and reduce nonradiative recombination, but also enhance the charge collection in the longer-wavelength region and decrease potential fluctuations. Most recently, Sun et al.151 prepared CMnTS films via a simple sol–gel method followed by a conventional selenization process; further, the stannite-structured CMnTS solar cell was fabricated, achieving a champion PCE of 1.79%, which is the highest efficiency reported till date for this material (Table 1). This work further demonstrated that CMTSSe is a promising PV material.
Inspired by the performance improvements noted for partially substituted Ag and Cd, Mn2+ (0.80 Å) with a larger ionic radius than those of Zn2+ (0.74 Å) and Cu+ (0.74 Å) is expected to be a favorable candidate to partially substitute Zn2+ to suppress the common cation disorder in CZTSSe. By finely adjusting the ratio of Mn–Zn and fabricating a double-layered structure of CZTS and CM0.15Z0.85TS using a sol–gel spin-coating method, Liea et al.152 obtained the highest efficiency of 5.73% at CZTS plus 4 layers of Mn2+-substituted CM0.15Z0.85TS, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of better collection at a short wavelength from CM0.15Z0.85TS and the superior back-contact collection from CZTS (Table 1). Based on this early work, they also compared the effects of Mn2+ substitution in sulfide- and sulfoselenide-based kesterite solar cells in terms of optoelectronic properties and device performance.153
Mn doping was also investigated by Li et al.,154 indicating that the dominant acceptor defect in CMn0.05Zn0.95TSSe solar cell is the shallow defect of VCu rather than the deep defect of CuZn in pure CZTSSe. Additionally, the back-contact barrier height of CMn0.05Z0.95TSSe solar cells was effectively reduced by Mn doping compared with that of a CZTSSe solar cell. Finally, the best CMn0.05Z0.95TSSe solar cell with the highest efficiency of 8.9% is obtained (Table 1). It is worth mentioning that a machine learning model was first utilized to seek the optimal doping ratio of Mn2+ in a CZTSSe device by the authors, which can save a lot of time and material cost.
3.2.3.2 Fe substitution for Zn. 
Fe can be found in the natural mineral kesterite consisting of Cu2(Zn1−xFex)SnS4, and therefore, a moderate doping level of Fe2+ can be incorporated into the host lattice to form a homogeneous Cu2(Zn1−xFex)SnS4 (CZFTS) alloy material. In 2014, Kim et al.155 successfully synthesized polycrystalline CZFTS thin films using chemical spray pyrolysis accompanied by post-sulfurization. The bandgaps of sulfurized CZFTS films can be tuned from ∼1.36 ± 0.02 to 1.51 ± 0.02 eV, almost showing a parabolic increasing trend with an increase in the Zn content. Meanwhile, this group reported the deposition of CZFTS thin films for the first time by using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method.156 They investigated the effects of changing the Zn/Fe ratio of the targets on the properties of CZFTS thin films, and the results revealed the transformation of the kesterite to the stannite phase with a variation in the Zn/Fe ratio. The substitution of Zn by Fe in CZTS was also investigated by Collord et al.,157 with the aim of exploring the impact of partial substitution of Fe on the optoelectronic properties of the absorber layer. They performed a combinatorial tested incorporation of Fe from 0 to 10000 ppm using a soluble FeCl2 precursor. The obtained results showed that Fe doping has a significantly negative effect on the devices even at relatively low doping levels, which can be attributed to the deterioration in the quasi-Fermi level splitting. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent Fe from diffusing into the absorber layer when adopting a metal foil as a substrate for flexible CZTSSe devices.
Quaternary pure Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) has drawn attention recently; it is expected to have applications in a variety of light-harvesting devices, such as P–N-junction solar cells, water purification, and electrocatalyst materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).158–161 In the search for suitable n-type semiconductors, Chatterjee et al.162 investigated several materials in their work. Finally, a device (efficiency: 2.9%) was fabricated using a novel sandwich structure: ITO/Cu@NiO/CFTS/Bi2S3/ZnO/Al (Table 1).
Beyond these elements (Mn and Fe), other transition metal elements have also been attempted as an exciting candidate for Zn in CZTS, such as Ni and Co, due to their suitable direct bandgap and excellent optical absorption coefficient. Recently, quaternary CNTS nanocrystals have been synthesized by several groups.144,163–166 Rondiya et al.167 synthesized a zinc-blende-type CNTS nanocrystals using a cost-effective and facile hot-injection method (Fig. 10a). Combining the first-principles DFT calculations, they investigated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the CNTS material for various high-symmetry crystalline phases. The calculated phonon dispersion and the corresponding P-DOS of CNTS for the most stable P2c polytype in G-type antiferromagnetic (G-AFM) ordering are shown in Fig. 10b. The possible negative-frequency phonon mode has not been observed in the results, which indicates that the phases are kinetically stable in their G-AFM ordering. Finally, a preliminary PV device with 0.09% efficiency was fabricated for the first time using a well-known architecture: glass/Mo/CNTS/CdS/AZO/Al (Fig. 10c and d and Table 1). Furthermore, the band alignment of the CNTS/CdS heterojunction was also measured in their work (Fig. 10e), demonstrating a small and desirable CBO value of −0.12 eV. Therefore, they concluded that a lower CBO at the CNTS/CdS heterostructure results in a higher Voc (423 mV) and FF (43%) compared with the first ever CZTS and CFTS cells.162,168 The preliminary results on CNTS materials yielded encouraging semiconducting properties with a high absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) in the visible range and an optical bandgap of 1.47 eV. Higher PV performance can be expected with a more appropriate device structure and reduced interfacial defect states in the future.

Some works have been reported for the synthesis of Cu2CoSnS4 (CCoTS) nanomaterials in the last decade.144,161,163–165,169–171 Cui et al.144 synthesized a sphere-shaped CCoTS nanocrystal using a simple and mild solvothermal method, exhibiting a ferromagnetic behavior at blocking temperatures of 13.8 and 69.5 K and affording an energy bandgap of 1.25 eV. Krishnaiah et al.171 reported the synthesis of CCoTS nanoparticles via a robust thermal decomposition process and their application in PV. The prepared CCoTS nanoparticle films with a bandgap ranging from 1.43 to 1.61 eV showed a photoresponse behavior under illumination (100 mW cm−2), indicating potential applications in low-cost thin-film solar cells.

3.3 Heterovalent cation substitution
Besides these isovalent substitutions, some heterovalent cations (trivalent metallic elements: In3+, Sb3+, and Ga3+) can also be partially incorporated and alloyed within the CZTSSe system.172–179
In3+ is considered to be one of the most interesting doped cations, since kesterite can be derived from the chalcopyrite structure by replacing two In3+ (Ga3+) cations with one Zn2+ and one Sn4+, suggesting that In3+ can probably be used to substitute both Zn2+ and Sn4+ and form charged defects. Besides, the formation of InCu defects in chalcopyrite can form benign complexes with VCu.174,180 Therefore, the In3+ cation has the possibility to occupy either Cu–Zn or Cu–Sn sites. In this sense, it is very interesting to investigate its possible impact on the material properties and device performance. In 2014, Kuo et al.174 prepared p-type In-doped CZTSe bulks by using a liquid-phase reactive sintering method at 600 °C. With an increase in the In doping level, the carrier concentration of In-doped CZTSe bulks monotonously increases, while the hole mobility initially increases from 1.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 to a maximum value of 8.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 and then decreases to about 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating that In incorporation can improve the electrical properties of CZTSe bulks. In order to specifically address the high Voc,def issue in CZTSSe solar cells, Kim et al.175 employed In2S3/CdS double emitters to introduce foreign In dopant element in CZTSSe absorbers (Fig. 11a). Among all the possible doping elements, they selected In2S3/CdS double emitters as a supplier for In into the CdS/CZTSSe layers based on the following advantages: (i) In can substitute for Cd in CdS and for Sn in CZTSSe due to their similar atomic radii, forming not only n-type doping (InCd) in CdS, but also p-type doping (InSn) in CZTSSe; (ii) the introduction of In dopant can simultaneously enhance the electron density in CdS and hole density in CZTSSe, which was also independently reported by Kuo et al.174 and Partain et al.,181 respectively. By this ingenious In3+ substitution approach, they successfully obtained a cell efficiency of up to 12.7% with a low Voc,def of less than 600 mV.

To further understand the effect of In3+ on the structure and photoelectric properties, Giraldo et al.176 prepared a series of CZTSe thin films with different In doping concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.6 × 1020 cm−3. They observed that the CZTSe films exhibited an obvious bilayer structure even at lower In doping levels. These results clearly demonstrated that In3+ at a low doping level could be successfully incorporated into the host lattice of CZTSe to form alloying materials. Contrary to previous reports,174,175 In doping does not have an obvious impact on the carrier concentration with an increasing In content. They attributed this to either the formation of neutral charged defects and/or complex defects or the introduction of a deep defect that is not significantly ionized at room temperature. Even worse, the performance of solar cells starts to deteriorate as the In doping concentrations increases beyond 1.2 × 1020 cm−3; this is probably forming some mixed Sn oxides and In oxide at the GBs that would become more conductive or even change their potential, leading to the degradation of shunt resistances (Rsh) as well as FF (Fig. 11b).
In chalcopyrite materials, Sb3+ doping was investigated to promote grain growth.182–184 In recent years, the incorporation of Sb in kesterite has also been investigated by some groups.179,185,186 Tai et al.186 studied the effect of Sb doping in CZTSSe by power-dependent and temperature-dependent PL results, revealing that trap density could be significantly suppressed with 0.5 mol% Sb doping due to the Sb passivation effect on nonradiative centers inside the bandgap. However, beyond 0.5 mol% Sb doping, more defects could quench the photoexcited carriers, which can obviously deteriorate the Voc,def.
The extended exploration of more heterovalent dopants to further improve the performance of kesterite-based materials is also attractive. Du et al.177 constructed a sandwich-like configuration of Ga3+ intermediate layer during the preparation of a precursor CZTSSe film via a low-cost ethylenediamine/1,2-ethanedithiol-based method (Fig. 11c and Table 1). They observed that Ga3+ substitution has a negligible impact on the bandgap, and Ga3+ cation is more likely to migrate to the bottom absorber layer in this system. One possibility for device improvement could be the introduction of Ga3+ altering the electrical properties of the bottom layer. However, the exact mechanisms behind this improvement are not yet clear. This trivalent metallic substitution can expand our understanding on mitigating harmful defects and provide an unconventional pathway to treat kesterite materials. A further improvement for obtaining even better PCE requires extensive investigation on the electrical properties of films through more heterovalent substitutions in future research.
4. Summary and outlook
4.1 Summary
In this review, recent theoretical and experimental studies have been summarized for cation substitution in kesterite-based absorber layers, with a particular focus on inhibiting point defects, defect clusters, and associated band-tail states for mitigating Voc,def in kesterite-based CZTSSe and derived earth-abundant multinary chalcogenides. These investigations suggest the promise of cation-substituted CZTSSe and related chalcogenide materials for next-generation PV applications. We mainly summarize the recent efforts and attempts to deal with the intractable problem encountered in kesterite materials and learn a lesson for applying to other promising earth-abundant metal PV absorbers, namely, (i) employing partial distant-cation substitution, which can introduce ionic size mismatch and mitigate antisite defects and (ii) developing structural diversification beyond the kesterite type by complete cation substitution, which can be expected to resolve band-tail states and explore many emerging multinary chalcogenide materials.
4.2 Shortcomings
Although the use of partial substitution has had a certain impact on the suppression of deep-level defects, intractable problems encountered in kesterite systems have not been completely resolved. These strategies are not yet comparable to CdCl2 passivation used in CdTe devices. In addition, the partial or total substitution of Ag for Cu and Cd for Zn in CZTSSe systems have undermined the composite advantages of CZTSSe with nontoxic and earth-abundant elements to a certain extent. In the search for novel, potential PV materials, it is first necessary to consider the magnitude of bandgap and visible-range absorption spectrum. Indeed, there is a large quantity of derived materials with bandgaps varying from 1.0 to 2.0 eV, which make them attractive to achieve the theoretical S–Q limit, but most materials afford a poor PCE below 5.0%. This low PCE can be attributed to the existence of undesirable nonradiative pathways that involve sub-bandgap electronic states induced by deep-level point defects and extrinsic impurities and therefore lead to a shorter carrier lifetime.195,196 The current defect detection methods are too macroscopic and not sufficiently clear to accurately distinguish between various defects. Recognizing these point defects and extrinsic impurities is far more difficult than screening, measuring, and predicting them. Practically, there is still a serious disconnect between theoretical and experimental investigations. A closer collaboration between theoretical and experimental investigators is required in future works.
4.3 Outlook
Future works on emerging multinary  chalcogenides investigated here should involve the systematic and comprehensive investigation of the defect properties including their formation energies and defect levels. An in-depth understanding of point defects and defect clusters is essential to enable control over the functionality and efficiency of semiconductor devices.197 Therefore, developing a higher-resolution characterization technique for identifying similar-sized atoms (i.e., Cu and Zn) is still significant. If in situ observations for all kinds of defects could be achieved in multinary  chalcogenides, the formation, diffusion, and distribution of defects can be comprehensively studied, and the adopted suppression strategies can become more targeted.
In kesterite-based solar cells, the cation disorder and associated band tailing are now considered to be major factors limiting the performance. These limitations are likely to be present in other kesterite-like devices, too. To better suppress and understand harmful cation disorders, we should carefully investigate the interaction between the preparation conditions and the atomic disorder of kesterite-like compounds, particularly preparation temperature. Reducing the processing temperature to a level comparable to that of perovskites may effectively reduce cation disorders to a certain extent. Isovalent cation substitutions involving larger ionic size mismatch have been regarded as a feasible pathway to suppress the formation of cation disorders among the constituent elements.8 Besides these isovalent substitutions, heterovalent substitutions such as trivalent metallic elements should be partially incorporated and alloyed within the CZTSSe system in future works, which may cause alterations in the point defects and defect clusters. In fact, the photogenerated-carrier lifetime and diffusion length should be improved not only by the suppression or removal of undesirable defects but also via architecture redesign based on conventional devices.
Considering that the structure of a kesterite-based device is entirely inherited from CIGSe solar cells, it is necessary to carefully reconsider that whether this copied architecture is completely suitable for CZTSSe and related chalcogenides. In this regard, redesigning a novel device configuration is still urgently needed. Furthermore, the concept of the spatial separation of charge carriers and recombination sites has been successfully achieved in predecessor CIGSe solar cells by constructing a gradient in the Ga/In composition ratio. This intriguing concept should be incorporated into such a device configuration.
In addition, the improved heterojunction quality can reduce interfacial recombinations and enhance the overall device performance. Further interfacial modification by engineering the composition, chemical environment, and crystallinity of the buffer deposition process is expected to improve the efficiency to a higher level. For junction interfaces without optimization, adjusting the CBO values at the junction interface is critical to reduce interfacial recombination and associated Voc,def. Employing suitable cation or anion substitution, e.g., Ag and Li for Cu, Cd for Zn, Ge for Sn, or Se for S, the CBO values of the junction interface can be continuously tuned to an optimized value.
Learning from the well-developed Si and perovskite solar cells, the surface passivation and interfacial engineering at the heterojunction interfaces are applied to improve the energy-level alignment and increase the charge-carrier lifetime between the absorber layer and carrier-selective contact.
Finally, kesterite and related multinary chalcogenides are of high research interest for several current PV applications, except conventional semiconductor materials. Although research progress in these technologies has been relatively slow, the advantage of a composition with earth-abundant and nontoxic elements is an effective way to achieve sustainable thin-film PV. When further efficiency breakthroughs for perovskite solar cells become increasingly difficult, a major breakthrough may be made by the continuous research efforts in kesterite and related materials.
