1. Introduction
Because of the crisis in traditional energy, renewable energy has attracted a large amount of attention. Solar energy holds tremendous promise for sustainable green technology. Solar cells, which can convert solar energy into electricity directly, are the focus of research due to their high power conversion efficiency. In all types of solar cells, I–II–VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductor absorber layers have been widely investigated because of their eco-friendliness and high power conversion efficiency.1–13 Recently,14 the power conversion efficiency of CIGS thin-film solar cells has reached 21.7% on the lab scale, which is comparable to other high-efficiency thin-film solar cells. However, fabricating high-quality CIGS thin films require a high-vacuum environment, resulting in high manufacturing cost. Furthermore, indium and gallium are scarce and costly, which is also a major obstacle to commercializing CIGS. There is an urgent need to find inexpensive and suitable elements to replace indium and gallium partially or completely to reduce the cost of materials, and to study the effect of doped or alternative elements. There is still insufficient research in this field. In the past decade, there have been several reports of partial substitution of indium and gallium with Al to fabricate thin-film solar cells via vacuum deposition, and the power conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells is satisfactory.15–17 Compared with vacuum deposition technology, solution processes are an easy, cheap approach to preparing semiconductor materials. Much research has focused on fabricating CIGSSe solar cells.3–6,9,11–13,18–27 Achieving elemental substitution, optimized compositions and homogeneous phases in quaternary CuInxM1−x(S,Se)2 (M = Fe, Co, Zn, Ni, Ge, Sn, B, Al) semiconductor materials via solution processes are strategies to overcome the scarcity and high price of indium and gallium. Previously, Chen et al. synthesized CuInxB1−xSe2 nanowires via a solvothermal method, in which the elemental ratio of In and B could be adjusted, and solar cells containing CuIn0.9B0.1Se2 nanowires achieved a power conversion efficiency of 2.34%.28 Connor et al.29 and Vahidshad et al.30 have also investigated the structural and optical properties of Zn and Fe substitution in CuInS2 nanoparticles. In addition, we have reported the synthesis of Cu3InSnS5 and Cu3ZnInSnS6 nanocrystals,31,32 and Li et al.33 prepared wurtzite Cu3ZnInSnS6 nanocrystals. Furthermore, Graeser et al. reported (CuIn(S,Se)2)0.5 (Zn(S,Se))0.5 solar cells using (CuInS2)0.5(ZnS)0.5 nanocrystals with the best device performance of 6.7%.34 However, our understanding of the elemental substitution of CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 to prepare thin films via solution processes and their use in thin-film solar cells is still insufficient and challenging. In this work, Al, Ni, and Co were used to substitute indium partially in the CuInS2 thin film. A simple solution process was used to prepare CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co)/CdS p–n heterojunctions by using a precursor solution, and power conversion efficiencies of 4.33%, 2.38%, and 1.98%, respectively, were obtained. The photovoltaic performance was comparable with the best solar cell efficiency of 4% reported for a CuInS2/CdS p–n junction solar cell fabricated by spin-coating precursor solutions.9
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O, 99.99%), indium hydroxide (In(OH)3, 99.99%), nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)3, 99.99%), and cobalt acetylacetonate (Co(acac)3, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Aluminum nitrate, cadmium hydroxide (Cd(OH)2, AR), carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.9%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, AR), and 1-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2, 99%) were obtained from Aladdin. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of CuIn0.9R0.1S2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) and CdS precursor solution
Ethanol (10 mL), CS2 (1.44 mL, 24 mmol), and 1-butylamine (2.4 mL, 24 mmol) were mixed in a 25 mL conical flask under magnetic stirring at room temperature. In(OH)3 (1.8 mmol), Al(NO3)3 (0.2 mmol) and Ni(acac)3 (0.2 mmol) or Co(acac)3 (0.2 mmol) were placed in the flask and heated at 60 °C for 30 min until they dissolved. Then, 0.9 mmol Cu2O was added and stirred for 60 min, yielding a homogeneous light yellow solution. Finally, a sticky solution was obtained by diluting the mixture to a total metal concentration of 0.4 M with ethanol. The solution was vigorously stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min to remove a small amount of insoluble solid. The synthesis was conducted in air. The CuIn0.9R0.1S2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) precursor solution was stored in a sealed glass vial. Ethanol (10 mL), CS2 (1.2 mL, 20 mmol), and 1-butylamine (2.0 mL, 20 mmol) were magnetically stirred in a 25 mL conical flask at room temperature. Cd(OH)2 (2 mmol) was placed in the flask and heated at 60 °C for 30 min until they dissolved. The CdS precursor solution was stored in a sealed glass vial.
2.3 Deposition of CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) absorber layers and fabrication of solar cell devices
CuIn0.9R0.1S2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) precursor thin films were spun on Mo-coated soda-lime glass (20 × 20 × 1.1 mm) at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by sintering on a 350 °C hot plate for 2 min to form Cu0.9In0.9(Al,Co,Ni)0.1S2 nanocrystal thin films. This process was repeated several times to obtain an absorber layer of the desired thickness. The samples were annealed at 400 °C for 10 min prior to selenization. Two samples and selenium powder (30 mg) were sealed in a test tube (25 mm diameter, 30 mL volume) under vacuum and then selenized at 540 °C for 40 min in a furnace. The CdS thin films were deposited by spin-coating Cd precursor solution on CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) thin films at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealing in a 300 °C hot plate for 2 min to form a CdS thin film. A 50 nm layer of intrinsic ZnO was deposited by RF sputtering, a 250 nm layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) was deposited by DC sputtering, and a 2 μm Al grid electrode was formed by thermal evaporation. Four devices with an active area of 0.368 cm2 were isolated by mechanical scribing with a tungsten needle.
2.4 Characterization
XRD patterns were recorded by using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (XFlash detector 4010, Bruker AXS). Samples for EDX measurements were prepared on a glass slide. J–V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (Abet Sun 2000; AM 1.5) with a homemade probe station. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using an 842-PE Newport optical power meter certified by Newport.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-fabricated CuIn0.9Al0.1(S,Se)2 (CIASSe), CuIn0.9Ni0.1(S,Se)2 (CINSSe) and CuIn0.9Co0.1(S,Se)2 (CICSSe) thin films and their enlarged (112) planes. After selenization in a sealed glass tube at 540 °C for 40 min, the chalcopyrite structure CIASSe, CINSSe and CICSSe thin films were formed. The main (112) diffraction peak became sharper and the intensity increased, and other minor peaks, such as (110), (103), (211), (105), (220) and (312), which belonged to the chalcopyrite structure were also visible. This result demonstrates that the absorber layer was composed of large chalcopyrite structure grains and that it did not contain impurity phases. Selenization is an important procedure because it improves the crystal quality after annealing at high temperatures and adjusts the bandgap of the as-fabricated thin film because the S can be substituted with Se in the crystal lattice. This process is essential for CIGSSe thin-film solar cell fabrication. The quality of the absorber layer strongly affects the short current, open voltage and overall performance of solar cells.

The device properties of solar cells are strongly affected by the absorber layer's elemental composition; therefore, EDS was used to analyze the elemental composition of the thin films. Approximately ten points were used to determine elemental composition. Fig. 2 shows that the ratio of Cu/(In + R) (R = Al, Ni, Co) is ∼0.9, and In/(In + R) is ∼0.9. This result shows that the composition of the solar cell absorber layer was Cu-poor and (In + R)-rich, which is consistent with previous reports.18,25 If the thin film is Cu-rich, CuxSe is formed by selenization. The elemental compositions of the thin films avoided CuxSe generation, improving the interface properties to increase photo carrier separation and improve the open voltage of the solar cells during solar cell fabrication.

Fig. 3 shows a top-view of the selenized CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) thin film and cross-sectional images of the corresponding solar cells. The left-hand images show that the as-prepared thin films were composed of large, dense crystals. Low-resolution SEM images showed that pinhole- and crack-free films were obtained after selenization, and the size of grains was around 1–2 μm, which was the desired absorber layer for solar cells (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). In the right-hand cross-sectional images (Fig. 3), the absorber layer thin films consisted of two layers. The upper layer was composed of large grains and the bottom layer was composed of fine grains on the MoSe2/Mo substrate. The large grains and MoSe2 were formed after selenization at 540 °C for 40 min. The fine-grain layers were formed by the incomplete decomposition of organic ligands during selenization, which agrees with previous studies of CIS and CIGS thin-film solar cells fabricated with nanocrystal inks or solution processes.12,18,25

The CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) solar cells were fabricated according to the classical structure of glass/Mo/CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co)/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al. The CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) solar cells were characterized under AM1.5 illumination (Fig. 4 and Table S1 in the ESI†). The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) solar cells were 4.33%, 2.38% and 1.98%, respectively. The results show that the CuIn0.9Al(S,Se)2 solar cell achieved the best performance with parameters of Voc = 0.41 V, Jsc = 21.39 mA cm−2, and FF = 49%. The CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) solar cells fabricated by solution processes have the highest PCE. However, compared with the solar cells fabricated by evaporation, the performance of our solar cells is poor. The short current was 21.39 mA cm−2, which is lower than the previously reported literature value of >30 mA cm−2.16 This may be caused by the low Se content compared with previous devices. The band gap of CISSe, CIGSSe or CZTSSe thin-film solar cells is strongly related to the S/Se ratio. The differences in device performance among the CIASSe, CICSSe and CINSSe thin-film solar cells were large, which could be explained by the absorber crystal quality and the effect of the doping agents. In the CIASSe absorber layer, the fine-grain layer was thinner than in the CICSSe and CINSSe films, and the grain size was much larger. The partial replacement of indium by aluminum improved the efficiency of the CIASe solar cells.15,35 The Co- and Ni-doped CISSe films played a passive role in the crystal growth and microstructure of the absorber layers, and degraded the device performance of the solar cells.

When the Se content is high, the band gap is narrow, and the short current is high. The series resistance of CIASSe solar cells also was consistent with the above result. The series resistance of CIASSe solar cells was 33.22 Ω cm−2, which is much higher than for CIGSSe solar cells fabricated in the same way. The open voltages of CIASSe, CINSSe and CICSSe were 0.41, 0.38 and 0.34 V, respectively, which was consistent with the shunt resistance (Table S1, ESI†). The reflectance spectra of the CIASSe solar cell are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and we expect that a significant improvement in device performance could be achieved by depositing an MgF2 antireflection film. We are currently optimizing the selenization process and improving the crystal quality of absorber thin films to improve the overall performance of CIASSe, CINSSe and CICSSe thin-film solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a solution process was used to obtain high-quality pinhole-free CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co) thin films. Our work demonstrated that indium can be partly substituted by low-cost earth-abundant elements Al, Co and Ni. Single p–n junction CuIn0.9R0.1(S,Se)2 (R = Al, Ni, Co)/CdS thin-film solar cells were fabricated via a spin-coating solution process, and power conversion efficiencies of 4.3%, 2.38% and 1.98% were achieved.
