1. Introduction
Due to the pressing issues of energy shortage and environmental concerns, innovative energy conversion and storage strategies have gained growing interest in recent years. Among these, electrolytic water splitting, metal–air cells, and carbon dioxide reduction have become prominent approaches.1–5 A common feature of all these systems is that the cathode region undergoes a reduction reaction while the anode region experiences an oxygen evolution reaction (OER).6–10
However, the sluggish and multi-step proton-coupled electron transfer process of the OER plays a decisive role, especially in electrocatalytic water-splitting systems.11–16 Water splitting is considered a straightforward, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective approach to hydrogen production instead of hydrocarbon reforming or cracking.17–20
Therefore, the creation of stable and efficient electrocatalysts for the OER is paramount in addressing the problem of OER hysteresis and achieving sustainable and large-scale hydrogen production.
The E–pH relationship determined by the Nernst equation reveals the reaction potential versus pH at a linear scale of −59 mV pH−1, and consequently, the sluggish OER proceeds more easily, as well as exhibits more favorable reaction kinetics in alkaline electrolytes. Besides, given the attractive and advanced route for sustainable hydrogen release in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers, exploring acidic OER catalysts is also significant, especially concerning the high current density and ultrahigh gas purity. In addition, the corrosion resistance and structural stability of electrocatalysts are highly dependent on the pH of electrolytes, and many of the typical OER electrocatalysts are not stable under acidic conditions due to high oxidative potentials. Thus, rational regulation of the alkalinity or acidity of electrolytes is necessary for OER processes.
Currently, the consumption of noble metal oxides IrO2 and RuO2 has increased dramatically due to their high catalytic activity in the OER. However, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals present significant challenges in the widespread application of noble metal catalysts. Thus, non-noble metal catalysts have been developed and progressively improved as feasible substitutes for noble metal catalysts in the past few decades.21–24 The tunable d-electrons and empty orbitals of transition metal oxides, phosphides, nitrides, sulfides, selenides, and carbides make them ideal candidates for OER catalysts. However, it is important to note that not all transition metal compounds demonstrate the desired catalytic activity and stability level for the OER. Achieving optimal catalytic performance and stability requires careful design and tuning of the structure and electronic arrangement. Additionally, as the OER is a mass transfer process involving the gas–liquid–solid phases, the ability of reactants and intermediates to adsorb and desorb on the catalyst surface is critical in determining the catalytic efficiency.25–29 High-performance OER catalysts should have the following characteristics: (1) good electrical conductivity to enhance electron transfer efficiency and reduce internal resistance; (2) high density and accessible catalytic active sites; (3) high intrinsic activity of active sites; (4) strong mechanical and chemical stability for industrial applications; (5) superhydrophilic and superoleophobic catalyst surfaces for water molecule adsorption and oxygen desorption; and (6) straightforward and environmentally friendly synthesis steps to achieve kilogram-scale macro preparation.
This review comprehensively summarizes the catalytic mechanism for the OER. Additionally, we have organized and presented design methods and principles for efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts in recent years, as shown in Fig. 1. These strategies are mainly categorized as single-phase and multi-phase modulation approaches. The former involves manipulating defective states, electron spin states, and amorphous catalysts, whereas the latter encompasses designing phase interfaces, strong metal support interactions, and single-atom catalysts. We analyze the impact of these design strategies on the performance of the OER through insights gained from in situ tests and theoretical calculations, which provide new perspectives to identify efficient and stable OER catalysts. Furthermore, we summarize innovative hydrogen production strategies from electrolytic water splitting and present novel designs of electrolytic cell structures to promote the industrialization of electrocatalytic hydrogen production technology. Finally, we analyze the current challenges and provide possible solutions to develop highly efficient and stable OER catalysts.

1.1 Adsorbate evolution mechanism
The adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) is a typical four-concerted proton–electron transfer (CPET) process in the catalytically active site, as illustrated in Fig. 2a.30 The AEM involves a four-step reaction process that produces three intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH). Specifically, the process begins with the adsorption of OH− at the active site, which loses electrons and generates *OH in alkaline water. Following the loss of the second electron, the intermediate *O is produced during another OH− attack. Subsequently, *OOH key intermediates are formed through nucleophilic attack by OH−. Finally, the fourth electron transfer and deprotonation lead to O2 desorption from the catalyst surface, releasing the active site for the next cycle. The binding strength between the intermediates and the active site determines the difficulty of completing the four-step reaction. The free energy difference (ΔG) is utilized to assess the strength of intermediate adsorption and active site activity. Experimental and theoretical findings have demonstrated that the creation of *O and *OOH species constitutes the pivotal step in the OER. Therefore, the magnitude of the difference between ΔG*O and ΔG*OH is intimately linked to the OER activity. Fig. 2b shows that the overpotential and values of ΔG*O–ΔG*OH for the catalyst exhibit a volcanic distribution. An ideal OER electrocatalyst can maintain binding energy with critical oxygen intermediates that are neither excessively strong nor insufficiently weak.31 According to the Sabatier principle, too weak adsorption of intermediates and catalysts leads to difficulty in the adsorption and activation of the reaction. Meanwhile, too strong adsorption leads to difficulty in desorption, permanently occupying the active site. Therefore, only catalysts with medium binding capacity are desirable. When ΔG*O–ΔG*OH values were ca. 1.6 eV, the catalytic activity was optimal with the smallest overpotential. Thus, catalysts with intermediate adsorption and desorption ability are preferred. Notably, the overpotential was at its minimum, and the catalytic activity was at its peak when the difference between the Gibbs free energy of reaction intermediates ΔG*O and ΔG*OH was approximately 1.6 eV.

1.2 Lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism
The adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) is tightly linked to intermediate binding activity, and theoretical calculations indicate that the overpotential in the AEM should be at least 370 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, recent reports have shown that the experimental limit of the OER catalysts is significantly lower than the value given above, which has brought the limitations of the AEM to light. In light of recent progress in electrochemical in situ characterization technologies, dynamic changes in catalyst structure during the OER catalysis have been revealed, suggesting that the OER process involves the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) to overcome the 370 mV overpotential barrier of the AEM while providing a more logical explanation of the oxygen production process under electro-catalytic conditions. Unlike the inert lattice oxygen in the traditional AEM, the LOM involves activated lattice oxygen in oxygen production. The initial two steps of the LOM generate *OH and *O intermediates identical to those produced in the AEM. Material lattice oxygen participates in the O–O coupling to produce O2 in the third step of the LOM. Therefore, the fundamental idea of the LOM is to activate lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, effectively avoiding the free energy restriction of adsorption and desorption of intermediates with faster reaction kinetics. Three main LOMs are designed for the studied materials: the oxygen-vacancy-site mechanism (OVSM) (Fig. 2c), the single-metal-site mechanism (SMSM) (Fig. 2d), and the dual-metal-site mechanism (DMSM) (Fig. 2e). The LOM can provide a more compelling explanation for the observed phenomenon of ultra-low overpotential oxygen production. Furthermore, O isotope tracing studies have revealed the involvement of lattice oxygen in the OER process, providing strong evidence supporting the validity of the LOM. Recently, the origin of the surface reconfiguration of transition metal oxide LOM catalysts has been revealed as a spontaneous chemical process.32
1.3 Coupled oxygen evolution mechanism
In the investigation of catalytic mechanisms for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), two key factors that limit catalytic activity are the O–O coupling in the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and deprotonation in the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM). Additionally, the intrinsic activity of the catalyst is strongly influenced by electronic states at the Fermi energy level. A potential solution to these challenges lies in the electron transfer mechanism, which results from metal and oxygen redox chemistry switchability at the Fermi energy level. This mechanism can achieve deprotonation and O–O coupling, as illustrated in Fig. 2f.33 The coupling of metal and oxygen redox chemistry in the COM successfully bypasses the rate-determining step of the OER, thereby reducing the energy barrier of the catalytic reaction. Specifically, the nickel oxyhydroxide nanoribbon structure with alternating 4-coordinated and 6-coordinated Ni edge atoms (NR-NiOOH) is designed to achieve controlled geometric conversion between octahedrons (NiO6) and square planar (NiO4) configurations. Light-induced geometric transitions allow for the precise control of electronic state transitions in proximity to the Fermi energy level. This strategy holds promise for the development of highly efficient catalysts.
1.4 Oxide path mechanism
Compared to the AEM, LOM, and COM, the oxide path mechanism (OPM) enables the design of high-performance OER catalysts due to its superiority in directly coupling O–O radicals without the involvement of active sites with intermediates (such as *OOH). The OER intermediates in the OPM are sole *O and *OH. Although OPM electrocatalysts can maintain stability while breaking the proportional relationship, they require high synergistic effects of the active site. Hence, designing active sites with an appropriate atomic spacing can facilitate the coupling of O–O radicals. Recent studies on the OPM of OER catalysts mainly focus on regulating cationic spacing in active centers. For instance, substituting Mn atoms on MnO2 with Ru atoms through the cation exchange method has proved beneficial for the OPM-type OER, leading to good OER catalytic activity and durability in acidic electrolytes for Ru/MnO2. The in situ tests and theoretical calculations have shown that no *OOH intermediates followed the OPM during the catalytic process, which avoided *OOH formation and resulted in a lower OER barrier.34
2. Innovative strategies to improve OER performances
Currently, IrO2 and RuO2 are the commonly used commercial OER catalysts. Despite their potential benefits, the restricted availability and high expenses of these materials have impeded their progress and practical utilization. As a result, non-precious metal catalysts have been gaining increasing attention from researchers in recent years. However, the inadequate inherent activity and stability of non-precious metal catalysts have prompted the proposition and investigation of design and optimization strategies. These comprise defect state modulation, amorphous material design, electronic spin state modulation, phase interface design, single-atom catalysts, and strong metal support interactions. Consequently, comprehensively organizing and summarizing these methods and principles is essential for developing future research on efficient OER catalysts.
2.1 Single-phase catalyst modulation strategy
2.1.1 Defect states. Electrocatalysis belongs to the category of surface catalysis, where the catalytic efficacy of a material is predominantly shaped by the atomic and electronic arrangement of its surface. The approach of defect engineering assumes a crucial function in modifying the surface charge distribution of the catalyst by disturbing the original periodicity and symmetry of its crystalline surface. Through the introduction of defects, it becomes possible to tailor the electronic properties of the surface, thereby optimizing catalytic activity.35,36 Crystals are often subject to defects caused by atomic thermal motion, local temperature gradients, and concentration effects during the crystal formation process. These defects can be broadly classified into bulk phase defects and surface defects, with the latter further divided into point defects, line defects, and plane defects based on their ductility. Defects can be divided into cationic and anionic, depending on their type. Recent research has indicated that the type and quantity of defects significantly impact the catalytic activity of crystalline material catalysts.37–39 Although crystal defects play a crucial role in catalytic materials, their diversity and complex nature make their study challenging. Consequently, a systematic review of defective state catalysts is necessary to facilitate an improved comprehension and design of catalysts.40–42 Oxygen vacancies are lattice defects commonly present in various oxides and caused by the absence of oxygen atoms. Oxygen vacancies are paramount in augmenting the electrocatalytic efficiency of the OER.43,44 However, despite the significance of oxygen defects in the OER catalysis, their actual mechanism remains uncertain and calls for further investigation.45 Operando techniques have been employed to study the structure–function relationship between oxygen vacancies and catalytic activity in Co3O4 during electrochemical processes.46 Nyquist plots of the measured impedances on Co3O4 and VO-Co3O4 from open circuit potential to 1.80 V reveal the adsorption and evolution of *OH on the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. In the high voltage range, the rapid accumulation of OH− facilitates the activation and driving of the OER. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) test indicate that the oxygen vacancies promote pre-oxidation and surface remodeling of Co2+ on the material surface. The use of operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques provides a comprehensive analysis of how intermediate species interact with oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. The conclusion is drawn that the vacancy on Co3O4 enhances the adsorption energy of *OOH and promotes more efficient O2 generation. Simultaneously, the oxygen-rich vacancy of Na-loaded RuO2 was reported to be an efficient OER catalyst.47 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and filtered image demonstrated lattice streaking and atomic phase inhomogeneity, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies on the material surface. The catalyst can drive water splitting efficiently with an overpotential of only 235 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Before and after the OER, no significant changes were observed in the diffraction peaks of XPS and EXAFS, indicating that the catalyst possesses structural stability. Besides, the remarkable OER efficiency can be attributed to the revolutionary doping of Na and the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which effectively lower the Fermi level of RuO2. This finding is well-supported by theoretical calculations that demonstrate significant OER activation. Moreover, another study illustrated the role of oxygen vacancies in the OER catalysis. Specifically, the NaBH4 reduction method was used to load Ru nanoparticles onto NiV-LDH while simultaneously introducing oxygen vacancies into the material.48 The XPS and electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses indicated the abundant occurrence of oxygen vacancies, which helped boost the OER catalytic activity of the material and stabilize the Ru nanoparticles on the surface. Only 0.1 mg of catalyst was present on the support electrode, indicating excellent mass activity of the material rich in oxygen vacancies. The evolution and formation of the precatalyst play a crucial role in achieving highly efficient OER catalysts. Surface oxygen defects can quickly induce surface reconfiguration of the catalyst during the electrochemical process due to the altered electronic structure of the atoms. Furthermore, adding F atoms onto arrays of CoMoO4 nanosheets is expected to induce a disruption of the atomic arrangement and a consequent increase in the population of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the nanosheets.49 HR-TEM, XPS, and ESR results demonstrated the presence of oxygen vacancies on the material. In an alkaline electrolyte, the catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a voltage of only 1.486 V and exhibits a smaller Tafel slope than the catalyst without oxygen vacancies. Theoretical calculations suggest that the unusual OER catalytic activity can be attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which undergo surface reconstruction and optimize the adsorption of catalytic reaction intermediates. Additionally, the catalyst with oxygen vacancies reduces the band gap of CoMoO4 and enhances electrical conductivity. In recent studies, it has been demonstrated that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in modulating the catalytic activity of RuO2 and NiCo2O4 composite nanocones.50 The presence of lattice defects can be observed in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images, indicating that the loading of RuO2 generates a significant number of oxygen vacancies on the surface of NiCo2O4. The resulting catalyst exhibits bifunctional HER/OER catalytic activity, with only 1.5 V required to drive water splitting up to a current density of 10 mA cm−2. To further enhance the impact of oxygen vacancies on electrocatalytic OERs, researchers have investigated oxygen vacancy-containing FeCoOx-S nanosheets.51 Theoretical calculations have suggested that Co atoms positioned around oxygen vacancies exhibit greater adsorption energy for water. Moreover, surface modification with S atoms has been found to further enhance the adsorption energy of the catalyst for water. The Bader charge number on the material surface supports the notion that the presence of S atoms and oxygen vacancies facilitates the adsorption and desorption of *OH. The experimental results align with these theoretical predictions. Specifically, EXAFS indicates that introducing S atoms increases oxygen vacancies near the active sites Co and Fe. In 1.0 M KOH, FeCoOx-Vo-S requires only 1.48 V to attain a current density of 200 mA cm−2, significantly better than FeCoOx-Vo and commercial RuO2.

In addition to oxygen vacancies, sulfur vacancies represent another type of anionic vacancy critical in modulating catalyst activity. Similar to oxygen vacancies, sulfur vacancies are found in sulfides.52 Sulfides are efficient substrates for electrocatalysis as they possess smaller band gaps than oxides, facilitating faster electron transfer.53,54 Nevertheless, the primary issue faced by most sulfide-based electrocatalysts is their poor stability. While catalysts with a spinel configuration tend to be more stable, there is still a need for improvements to their catalytic activity. Sulfur-vacancy-rich spinel-phase Co3S4 nanoflowers were synthesized under alkaline conditions and became efficient OER catalysts.55 The introduction of sulfur vacancies optimized the electron distribution of Co3S4 and promoted the adsorption of intermediates. Vs-Co3S4 exhibited efficient OER catalytic activity, requiring an overpotential of only 245 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm−2, and could stably catalyze water splitting for up to 200 h with minor decay in catalytic activity. In addition, ReS2 with sulfur vacancies has been demonstrated to enhance its activity towards the OER.56 The improved catalytic activity and stability of Re/ReS2 after introducing sulfur vacancies by H2/N2 reduction results from the fact that the S vacancies increase the density of the active site and optimize the electron density around the active site. One interesting sulfur vacancy modulation study involves doping O ions onto layered MoS2 using an anion doping approach. This method utilizes heterogeneous atoms to increase the sulfur vacancies on the MoS2 substrate significantly.57 The EPR spectra confirmed the presence of sulfur vacancies in the material, and concentration variation measurements were conducted to determine the number of this defect. Additionally, Pt coupling with O-MoS2 was performed using XPS and EXAFS, along with the structural study of the S defect. The results indicate that high Pt valence states can be attributed to partial sulfidation during solvent heating (Fig. 3f–g). Moreover, the use of Fourier transform EXAFS spectra and wavelet transforms reveals that Pt atoms are situated within S vacancies. This configuration induces a local rearrangement of electrons within the catalyst, a key factor contributing to its unusual catalytic activity (Fig. 3h–l). The core–shell structure with S vacancies displayed remarkable mechanical stability as the catalyst remained stable for the entire 24 hour duration of the water splitting without any observable changes within the catalyst structure. Furthermore, sulfur vacancies enhanced the catalytic activity by facilitating the interaction with metals and vacancies. A straightforward hydrothermal synthesis method was employed to prepare Ru-doped Ni9S8, which is abundant in sulfur vacancies.58 Theoretical calculations reveal that introducing Ru does not generate new active sites but induces a surface charge modulation effect. This modulation triggers a distinctive metal-vacancy interaction that results in optimized adsorption energy of intermediates in catalytic reactions. Consequently, the catalytic activity of the catalyst is enhanced. Moreover, this research proposes a mechanism involving the synergistic effect between sulfur vacancies and metals. This mechanism provides a promising approach to investigating the catalytic mechanism in greater depth and designing high-performance electrocatalytic materials for the OER.
In electrocatalysis, it has been observed that anionic defects, specifically oxygen and sulfur defects, can significantly augment catalytic activity. Cationic vacancies are also being explored as a potentially promising design strategy for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts because cation vacancies can optimize the adsorption of intermediates by modulating the charge distribution of neighboring atoms, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.59,60 For example, cationic defects can alter the geometry and electronic structure around the single atomic catalyst, enhancing the electrocatalytic reaction activity. Specifically, Co2+ ionic vacancies are introduced on Co(OH)2 to immobilize single-atom Ru on Co(OH)2.61 The electronic configuration of the catalyst is optimized, and its electrical conductivity is improved due to the charge interaction between single-atom Ru and the Co vacancies. Compared to the catalyst without Co vacancies, the mass activity of the catalyst with Co vacancies is 4.73 times higher. Through in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and theoretical calculations of single-atom Ru and Co vacancies, it has been demonstrated that the cationic vacancies play a crucial role in optimizing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on the single atom and reducing the reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This study provides a novel approach to investigating the synergistic effects of single-atom and cationic vacancies. In addition, some reports indicate that polymetallic compounds exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to monometallic compounds due to the synergistic effect between multiple metals. Nevertheless, precisely tuning the species of cation vacancies within polymetallic compounds remains challenging. Intelligent material design can alter the length of M–O bonds, reducing internal crystal structure stability and consequently producing cation vacancies. For example, the Co–O bond length in NiCo2O4 spinel is modified through Al doping, impacting the ease of chemical bond breakage.62 The electrocatalytic activity of catalysts that generate Co2+ cation defects following NaOH etching was superior. This superiority can be attributed to the cation defects that induce electron redistribution at the active catalytic site, leading to a reduction in the internal resistance of the catalyst. Notably, both EXAFS and theoretical calculations suggest that the etching agent NaOH is more inclined to react with Co, resulting in Co defects while leaving Ni and Al unaffected. This selective generation of cation vacancies provides a promising strategy for regulating cation-deficient states. Despite the growing interest in introducing cation defects in electrocatalysts, the correlation between such defects and catalytic activity remains uncertain. Investigating cationic defects in typical OER catalysts, such as NiFe-LDH, poses a challenging task. However, the relationship between cationic defects and catalyst surface reconstruction was elucidated for the first time with the assistance of aprotic-solvent-solvation-induced leaking. The aprotic-solvent-solvation-induced leaking promotes defect states in NiFe-LDH, and in situ Raman spectroscopy indicates that the defect states in the catalyst are primarily cationic vacancies VFe and VCo.63 At higher voltages, cationic vacancies combine with reaction intermediates to undergo catalyst surface reconstruction, forming Ni–OH and Fe–OH structures. Furthermore, the application of voltage leads to the formation of NiOOH and FeOOH amorphous precatalysts on the catalyst surface. The presence of cation vacancies accelerates the formation of precatalysts, a crucial factor contributing to the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity due to cation defects.
The manipulation of defect states to enhance catalytic activity is an important growing topic in catalysis. Nonetheless, the study of defect-state catalysts presents several challenges that require careful consideration. Notably, while it is well-established that defects can significantly improve catalytic performance, the precise control of defect quantity and characteristics remains a significant challenge. Additionally, the relationship between defect sites and catalytic activity necessitates the use of in situ detection techniques to track and analyze catalytic behavior changes accurately. Developing effective methodologies for the controlled modulation of defect states and using advanced analytical techniques for in situ monitoring represent crucial avenues for future research in this field.

2.1.2 Phase regulation. G. Kreysa and B. Hakansson first investigated the OER catalytic performance of amorphous catalysts under alkaline conditions in 1986, where the amorphous Co50Ni25Si15B10 showed the best OER catalytic activity.64 In 1992, D. W. Kirk and coworkers conducted a pioneering study to compare the catalytic activity of crystalline and amorphous materials.65 Electrochemical tests revealed that the amorphous Ni-rich Ni–Co alloy had better catalytic activity than its crystal form. In addition, the amorphous Ni–Co alloys showed better electrocatalytic stability in the alkaline environment. A few years later, to investigate the mechanism of catalytic activity of amorphous catalysts, S. J. Thorpe and coworkers used the Tafel slope to study the slow surface site substitution of amorphous Ni–Co alloys using low- and high-voltage catalysts in the OER under alkaline conditions.66 Curtis P. Berlinguette and coworkers first investigated the amorphous binary and ternary metal oxide OER catalytic activity.67 In this study, 21 amorphous oxide films with varying Fe, Co, and Ni contents were synthesized using a photochemical metal–organic deposition. A screening process was performed to identify the most active amorphous catalysts by analyzing the onset potential, Tafel slope, and η at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 through contour plots (Fig. 4a–c). Electrochemical studies revealed that the catalytic activity increased as the Fe content increased because Fe can stabilize Ni in a highly oxidatively active state. Although crystalline materials have been widely used as electrocatalysts for the OER, recent research has highlighted the advantages of amorphous materials. In comparison to crystalline catalysts, amorphous catalysts offer several benefits: (1) at the microscopic level, amorphous materials possess a disordered atomic arrangement, which is distinct from the long-range ordering of crystalline catalysts. (2) Amorphous materials have a high density of lattice defects due to their random nature. These defect states enhance the number of active sites and optimize intermediates' adsorption. (3) The atomic disorder and ligand unsaturation of amorphous materials enhance the inherent activity of the catalytically active sites. (4) Amorphous materials have a lower formation energy than crystalline materials, allowing greater flexibility in adjusting the composition of amorphous materials.68

The distinct atomic and electronic structures of amorphous alloys have captivated the interest of researchers, inspiring the exploration and creation of amorphous alloy catalysts. One example is the FeCoNi amorphous alloy material, which can be synthesized through the in situ conversion strategy.69 The FeCoNi amorphous alloy material has demonstrated remarkable efficiency as an OER electrocatalyst, requiring only a 235 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Its exceptional stability in alkaline electrolytes also makes it a promising candidate for practical applications. The long-term stability is attributed to the amorphous and three-dimensional aerogel structure of the amorphous alloy electrocatalyst. Furthermore, this unique structure provides abundant defect sites and accessible catalytic active sites, contributing to its exceptional performance. Additionally, amorphous alloy materials possess the unique ability to exfoliate two-dimensional layered catalysts, such as the NiFe amorphous alloy's capacity to exfoliate MoS2, thus driving the development of two-dimensional catalysts.70 The heterogeneous structure of NiFe alloys and MoS2 nanosheets prevents the agglomeration of the layer structures. Furthermore, the uniform distribution of NiFe alloys on the two-dimensional material surface facilitates charge transfer between interlayers. The high OER catalytic activity and stability of NiFe/MoS2 have been attributed to the unique structure of amorphous NiFe and the generation of highly oxidized catalytically active substances during the catalytic process. Previous studies have demonstrated that the catalytic activity of amorphous alloy catalysts supersedes that of crystalline catalysts. However, the intrinsic mechanism responsible remains elusive. Therefore, applying in situ electrochemical and spectroscopic methods to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of highly active amorphous catalysts could be beneficial for developing high-performance amorphous catalysts. In particular, subjecting macroscopically prepared NiFe amorphous alloys to positive voltages at room temperature can reveal the intrinsic mechanism of amorphous alloy materials. This activation of surface atoms significantly increases the number of catalytically active sites exposed on the surface, enhancing the catalytic activity.71 As a result, the catalytic activity of the OER under alkaline conditions was enhanced. Constructing catalysts by coupling amorphous materials with other crystalline or amorphous materials is a promising study area. A layer of amorphous NiFe LDH nanosheets was deposited by in situ electrochemical deposition onto amorphous CuS to form an amorphous–amorphous interface structure.72 This strong coupling effect of the two amorphous forms alters the interfacial electronic structure while facilitating the catalyst durability test. The NiFe NS/CuS catalyst requires only 1.47 V to drive the OER up to a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The superior catalytic activity may arise from the charge redistribution due to the strong interaction of the two amorphous catalysts. Another example is the graphene coating coupled with NiFe alloy materials, which constructs crystalline and amorphous interfacial structures.73 The electrocatalysts consisting of (WO2–Ni17W3)/NiFe(OH)x with both amorphous and crystalline interfaces have been demonstrated to be suitable for industrial electrolysis of water, particularly for the production of hydrogen at high current densities.74 The catalyst exhibits both HER and OER catalytic activities, sustaining stable water splitting for 120 hours at a current density of 1000 mA cm−2 under industrial conditions. The exceptional catalytic performance and stability at high current densities are attributed to its heterogeneous amorphous and crystalline component structure. Incorporating amorphous and crystalline interfaces in the catalyst design overcomes the limitations of unstable conventional amorphous catalysts. By employing Ni2P@FePOxHy, which features both crystalline phosphide and amorphous phosphate-doped hydroxide nanosheets, a high current density of 1 A cm−2 can be achieved and stable water cracking is sustained for up to 12 days.75 The Ni2P@FePOxHy nanosheet structure provides many pore structures on the catalyst surface and active sites, which is conducive to promoting the adsorption and desorbing of intermediates. In addition, the heterogeneous interface between amorphous and crystal forms can improve the charge transfer ability and reduce the internal resistance of the catalyst to enhance the catalytic activity.
Anodic catalysts undergo surface self-reconfiguration during the catalytic process, forming amorphous species on the catalyst surface. Extensive studies have confirmed the electrocatalytic activity of such species generated in situ during electrocatalysis. In recent research, the amorphization process of NiSn(OH)6 was investigated using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.76 This technique unveiled a gradual reduction in the characteristic peaks of the Sn species and the emergence of NiOOH diffraction peaks (Fig. 4f–h), providing insights into the evolution of the amorphous species on the catalyst surface. The self-electrochemical corrosion of Sn and the appearance of a new species of NiOOH amorphous catalytic activity are the underlying causes of its enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, the amorphous CoFoO material grown in situ on the surface of black phosphorus has good OER electrocatalytic activity.77 The electrocatalytic process of CoFeO@BP results in the in situ conversion of the catalysts to amorphous CoFeP, leading to highly efficient HER catalytic activity. An interesting research topic is the in situ surface reconfiguration during the electrochemical process, which converts the catalyst into an HER/OER bifunctional catalyst. In chalcogenide electrocatalysis, the dissolution of ions on the material's surface can form a layer of amorphous materials. A top-down strategy was employed to facilitate the formation of surface amorphous precatalysts, selectively dissolving La3+ at the A-site of chalcogenide LaNiO3 while activating Ni2+ at the B-site. This approach promotes the formation of amorphous surface precatalysts, enhancing the chalcogenide electrocatalysts' catalytic activity.78 Meanwhile, the newly introduced Fe3+ entered the lattice and formed NiFe amorphous catalysts with a large specific surface area, requiring only 1.419 V potential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The excellent electrocatalytic OER activity is mainly derived from amorphous materials with a high density of active catalytic sites.

2.1.3 Spin states regulation. Transition metal oxides play a critical role as catalysts in water splitting, but their practical applications are limited by factors such as poor electrical conductivity and few active sites. Therefore, researchers have shifted their attention to transition metal oxides with easily tunable electronic structures that exhibit excellent catalytic activity. These oxides consist of a metal center and an oxygen ligand, with the central transition metal possessing five d orbitals-three low-energy orbitals (dxy, dxz, dyz) and two high-energy orbitals (dz2, dx2−z2). During the OER process, intermediates primarily bond and transfer charge with the high-energy orbitals. Thus, electron occupancy on these orbitals plays a crucial role in catalytic activity. Moreover, regulating the d-orbital electron distribution and spin contributes to catalytic reaction kinetics. As far back as 1984, researchers John O'M. Bockris and Takaaki Otagawa investigated the correlation between the magnetic moments of chalcogenide materials, the number of transition metal d electrons, and the activity of catalysts in electrocatalytic water splitting.79 Since then, Anatoly L. Buchachenko has investigated the spin regulation of catalytic materials and discovered the spin and magnetic response phenomena of many metals and transition metal oxides.80 Later, Anatoly L. Buchachenko and Vitaly L. Berdinsky summarized and analyzed the role of electron spin in catalysis.81 In catalytic reactions, these two effects, the co-existence of electron spin and spin–orbit coupling, determine the catalytic process and the rate of catalytic reactions.Since then, researchers have increasingly investigated the regulation of electron spin effects in transition metal oxides.82–86 Spinel-type oxides have attracted significant attention in catalysis due to their stable conformations. Poor electrical conductivity and inactive metal centers hinder their OER catalytic activity. Recently, researchers have explored the potential of magnetic field effects to modulate spin on spinel oxides and enhance their OER catalytic activity. External magnetization can alter the electron spin of ferromagnetic materials, thereby influencing catalytic activity. A spinel-type ferromagnetic catalyst is CoxFe3−xO4 which has garnered attention for this purpose. This catalyst generates a thin hydroxide layer on its surface during the OER process.87 Comparing the OER activity of pristine CoxFe3−xO4 and CoxFe3−xO4 catalysts subjected to the magnetic field, they found that CoxFe3−xO4 subjected to a magnetic field had better OER catalytic performance, and the catalytic activity returned to the original state after demagnetization. Magnetic hysteresis loops and theoretical calculations show that the electron spin of OH− on the surface of CoxFe3−xO4 under the action of a magnetic field facilitates the transfer of d electrons from the transition metal and 2p electrons from O and promotes the generation of triplet oxygen, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of the OER. These findings suggest that spin-pinning has a pronounced effect on the rate of charge transfer and matter transport on the surface of the electrocatalyst, which has not previously been reported in the literature. These novel insights highlight the potential of spin state control as a powerful tool for optimizing electrocatalytic performance and represent a significant contribution to catalyst design and synthesis.
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity can be enhanced by exploiting the spin-pinning effect between an alloy catalyst and the hydroxide species. In another research, the electron spin phenomenon is crucial in promoting the OER activity and stability of magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalysts.88 More specifically, magnetization of the alloy enhances the spin-pinning effect between the catalyst and the hydroxide layer, leading to improved OER performance. This effect is particularly notable as it enables the catalyst to maintain its activity and stability over long operation times and high-temperature conditions, such as those encountered in an electrolyzer operating at 60 °C. The magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst represents a promising option for OER applications prioritizing high efficiency and long-term stability. Additionally, the stability at elevated temperatures further underscores its potential for industrial applications. Overall, magnetic field-enhanced OER catalysts hold considerable promise for various practical applications. To further investigate the relationship between spin-polarization kinetics and catalytic activity, Xu and co-workers continued their research by exploring the electron spin state of the ferromagnetic material CoFe2O4 under the influence of a magnetic field.89 The catalytic activity of transition metal oxides is heavily influenced by the spin state of their d electrons, which is closely related to the degree of bonding between the metal and intermediates. In the case of CoFe2O4, a ferromagnetic catalyst without an external magnetic field, the Tafel slope is around 120 mV dec−1, suggesting that the first electron transfer step is rate-determining. However, when exposed to a magnetic field, the Tafel slope decreases to about 90 mV dec−1, indicating that the rate-determining step becomes a mixture of the first and second electron transfer steps. In contrast, non-magnetic catalysts show no change in the rate-determining step upon application of a magnetic field. This study aims to investigate the impact of an external magnetic field on the electron spin and catalytic activity of ferromagnetic catalysts during the OER. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a and b, magnetic hysteresis loops and theoretical calculations reveal that applying a magnetic field during OER catalysis promotes the adsorption and stabilization of oxygen intermediates after spin polarization of the electrons in the catalysts. This enhances the efficiency of the OER process and promotes oxygen production. This study provides a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the interplay between magnetic fields, electron spin, and catalytic activity in transition metal oxides.

In addition to inducing spin polarization of transition metal d electrons by applying a magnetic field, the introduction of heteroatoms can also manipulate the electron spin. Single-atom catalysts have recently garnered significant attention due to their potential for catalytic activity. Researchers have extensively investigated the impact of single-atom charge transfer on catalytic activity, further contributing to the growing interest in this field. However, fewer studies have been conducted on the influence of transition metal single-atom electron spins. The internal electron polarization of single atoms constitutes a unique catalytic active center that plays a crucial role in intermediate adsorption. In M–N–C type single-atom catalysts, heteroatom doping can induce polarization of d-electron spins, enhancing the catalytic properties.90 Theoretical calculations were performed to determine the structure and charge distribution surrounding Fe and Ni single atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 5c–k. The introduction of Ni single atoms led to moderate spin polarization of the electrons of Fe single atoms, resulting in enhanced electron leaving domains. Consequently, OH− could adsorb effectively on the catalyst surface, demonstrating remarkable OER catalytic activity. Furthermore, the location of ferromagnetic single-atom can affect their spin states. For example, studies have demonstrated that when ferromagnetic single-atom Co is deposited on layered TaS2, it can bind with TaS2 in two distinct manners.91 These are the substitution of Ta with Co (CoTa) and anchoring a Co single atom in a hollow site on the TaS2 surface (CoHS). Theoretical calculations of charge density and magnetic moment indicate that CoHS is the active center for the OER, where the surrounding Co/Ta can tailor the spin density of the Co single atom. Furthermore, increasing the loading of single atoms enhances the magnetic moment of the single atom and, consequently, the OER catalytic activity. To verify this conclusion, Fe-based single-atom catalysts were also studied. The correlation between the spin state, spin density, and catalytic activity has been firmly established. In particular, the association between the spin state of single-atom Co and the catalytic activity of OER is a widely studied topic.
Additionally, the relationship between the spin state of Co-based sulfur group materials and the OER activity has gained attention, given the prominence of Co as a typical ferromagnetic element. By controlling the reaction conditions, the classical double chalcogenide PrBaCo2O6 can exhibit diverse crystallographic facets relevant to this field of study.84 Exposing the crystalline planes (100) enhances the OER catalytic activity of the catalyst by increasing the strength of intermediate adsorption. Combined with the EXAFS analysis, different crystal surfaces result in changes in the electronic structure of Co, which originates from the distortion of CoO6 caused by the varying crystal surfaces. Theoretical calculations reveal that the distortion of CoO6 effectively promotes the spin polarization of d electrons in Co, which enhances the hybridization of 3d orbitals with 2p orbitals of O in Co. Despite the extensive investigation of the spin state design of catalysts, in situ characterization of spin states has not been thoroughly explored. Consequently, there is a need to develop in situ techniques capable of monitoring changes in catalyst spin states. Additionally, establishing a database linking spin states and the catalytic activity of magnetic materials can efficiently identify superior catalytic materials. The single-phase modulation strategy provides a more flexible approach to studying efficient catalysts, and a comparison of OER catalyst activities for single-phase modulation strategies is shown in Table 1.

2.2 Multi-phase catalyst modulation strategy
2.2.1 Interfacial structure regulation. A practical approach is to design interfaces comprising two or more phases to modulate catalytic performance. These interfaces are formed by combining different components, including metals, metal oxides, metal phosphides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, metal carbides, and metal hydroxides.92,93 By carefully designing these interfaces, catalytic activity and selectivity can be improved, making them an important area of study in catalysis research.94,95 The unique phase interface structure fosters bond cooperation, which has several benefits, including accelerating electron transmission, enhancing catalyst conductivity, boosting hydrophilicity, and augmenting the active electrochemical area.96–98 The varied band structures present at the phase interface induce charge transfer between different phases, regulating interface electrons and reducing the adsorption energy of catalytic reactions. Furthermore, the strain and synergistic effects arising from the crystal structure of the phase interface influence the catalyst's adsorption energy to the intermediate, further enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of the OER. The successful construction of the phase interface allows Co electrons to transfer to Mo2C in the Co/Mo2C heterogeneous catalyst, resulting in Co becoming an electron-deficient center, thus optimizing the adsorption energy of the OER intermediates and improving the catalytic activity of the OER.99 In addition, the synergistic effect of Co and Mo2C brought by the “self-sacrifice” effect of Co overcomes the obstacle of poor catalytic stability of Mo2C in an alkaline environment. Co/Mo2C has a good performance of electrocatalytic oxygen production under alkaline conditions. Only 254 mV of overpotential is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is better than that of the noble metal catalyst.The electrocatalytic activity of the OER is significantly affected by the change in electronic structure that arises from forming a phase interface. The resulting rearrangement of electrons can also be attributed to the defect states generated in this process. It is worth noting that constructing a phase interface entails destroying the original long-range ordered crystal structure and forming numerous defect states. Recent studies have consistently demonstrated that the defect state that arises from heterogeneous structures serves as the catalytic activity center, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of OER materials. Specifically, the Co9S8/Ni3S2 nanowire heterostructures exhibit a unique two-phase structure that promotes the formation of abundant lattice defects on the surface of the catalysts, leading to remarkable improvements in its catalytic activity.100 The existence of defect states significantly improves the active area, speeds up the charge conduction and material transport and optimizes the adsorption of intermediates simultaneously. Therefore, it has excellent OER electrocatalytic performance and excellent stability. Similarly, NiS2/MoS2 nanosheets with the phase interface of NiS2 and MoS2 have many lattice defects and a unique interfacial microenvironment that optimizes the adsorption of OER intermediates.101 The NiS2/MoS2 nanosheets exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability for water splitting. Meanwhile, CoO/CoP hollow nanoneedles on N-doped carbon destroyed the long and ordered crystal structure leading to defects and exposing more catalytic active sites in the material.102 The theoretical calculations show that the unique P–Co–O tetrahedron at the phase interface can accelerate the charge transfer and improve the conductivity of the catalyst (Fig. 6a–f). By lowering the d-band center of the catalyst, the adsorption energy of the oxygen intermediate onto the material can be optimized, leading to a significant enhancement of its electrocatalytic activity. This finding highlights the importance of carefully engineering the electronic properties of the catalyst to achieve superior catalytic performance.

The coupling of materials with different morphologies to form a phase interface can be strategically designed to enhance the effectiveness of catalytic reactions. The synergistic effect can be fully realized using this method. Research has shown that the nanowire structure facilitates the acceleration of electron transport during catalytic reactions. The nanosheet structure provides a larger catalytic active area, leading to a higher density of active sites. A non-homogeneous composite catalyst incorporating nanowires and nanosheets with heterogeneous structures was developed to enhance the catalytic activity further. This integration allows for optimized adsorption energy and strong electron coupling at the phase interface, combining the advantages of fast electron transport and high-density catalytic active sites. Inspired by the nutrient transport of plants, CuNi nanowires were used as branches and NiFeCu sodium hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets acted as blades, achieving a good OER catalytic activity (Fig. 6g and h).103 The material utilized in the study demonstrates rapid electron transfer between the nanowires and nanosheets, effectively enhancing the conductivity of the catalyst. Furthermore, the incorporation of NiFeCu hydroxide ultra-thin nanosheets creates additional catalytic active sites, ensuring efficient water splitting. The material's branch and leaf-like structure also prevent the aggregation of the ultra-thin nanosheets, thereby significantly improving the stability of the catalyst. In a two-electrode system, a mere 1.51 V voltage was sufficient to drive water decomposition and produce a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Through theoretical calculations and empirical experiments, it has been demonstrated that introducing Cu atoms in the catalyst design leads to significant electron redistribution. This electron redistribution weakens the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates and lowers the energy barrier of the OER rate-step reaction. The strategic engineering of phase interfaces and the catalyst morphology also leads to maximum catalytic activity and stability. The synthesis of such heterogeneous structures represents an innovative approach to catalysis research and may offer novel insights into designing more efficient and durable catalysts.
The formation of a phase interface in materials can effectively regulate the coupling of electronic structure and morphology, providing insights for the design of electrocatalysts with dual functions for the HER/OER. Recent studies have demonstrated that coupling materials with HER and OER activities can enhance the catalytic performance of catalysts through a synergistic interfacial effect arising from heterogeneous materials. One such example is the CoP@CoOOH/CP core–shell heterojunctions, which exhibit excellent HER and OER catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect of CoP and CoOOH, including the presence of oxygen vacancies.104 The study found that CoP exhibited good HER activity, but its OER activity was poor. However, the in situ growth of CoOOH on the CoP surface has shown significant enhancements in both the OER and the HER catalytic activity. This is due to oxygen vacancies on the CoOOH surface which optimize the adsorption energy of the OER intermediates. As a result, the electron transfer process becomes more favorable, contributing to more excellent overall catalytic activity. Additionally, the formation of heterogeneous interfaces exposed more catalytically active sites and improved charge transfer, further enhancing the catalytic performance of CoP. These findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting the metal at the phase interface to optimize catalyst biofunctionalization. Based on these results, the unique Co–Co2C/CC electrocatalyst is a promising bifunctional catalyst for various applications.105 Heterogeneous catalysts were developed with Co nanoparticles exhibiting HER catalytic activity and Co2C with OER activity. The Co–Co2C/CC bifunctional electrocatalyst demonstrated excellent efficiency due to the synergistic effect. This novel design holds promise for developing low-cost and stable high-efficiency electrocatalysts for metal carbide. Additionally, the Co/β-Mo2C heterogeneous catalyst integrated the formation of a heterogeneous interface between Co and β-Mo2C, which markedly improved the original HER activity of β-Mo2C and overcame its poor OER activity in alkaline electrolytes.106 Thus, this research provides essential insights for developing advanced electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the interaction between N-CNTs, Co, and β-Mo2C at the phase interface forms distinct Mo–N and Co–N bonds. These bonds facilitate charge redistribution within the material and enhance the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. Consequently, the phase interface strategy induces lattice mismatch and increases electron redistribution at the active site, contributing to the optimization of adsorption energy. This suggests a promising approach for designing electrocatalytic water decomposition catalysts by considering the phase interface's impact on the original ordered structure of the crystal. In summary, electrocatalysis occurs primarily on the surface of materials, making it crucial to regulate the heterojunction interface when constructing composite nanostructures for high specific surface area and efficient charge transport. However, research on interface structure during catalytic processes is still limited. The in situ characterization equipment can track the interface evolution during catalysis, uncovering the underlying principles of catalysis. Therefore, integrating in situ methods with theoretical calculations can provide constructive guidance for the research and development of efficient catalysts.

2.2.2 Decoration of single atoms. As atomic-scale technology has advanced, researchers have turned to the design and development of nanocatalysts. The size of the catalysts is significant in multiphase catalysis, and as nanomaterials are reduced to single-atom size, they develop unique electronic and spatial structures that can significantly enhance their catalytic activity.107–112 Single-atom catalysts are receiving increasing attention due to their high atom utilization efficiency and unique selectivity.113–115 As early as the 1990s, studies related to single-dot atomic catalysts, such as the growth of large concentrations and regularly spaced single-dot metal complexes on silica inner walls with large-diameter pores.116 In 2011, Zhang proposed the concept of single-atom catalysts (SACs).117 HAADF-STEM has revealed that the single-atom catalysts exist as isolated single sites, exposed on the surface of the substrate with 100% atomic utilization. Furthermore, XAS was used to investigate the electronic structure and coordination environment of single-atom Pt catalysts. It was discovered that single atoms were not isolated but formed chemical bonds with the substrate catalyst, providing essential stability for the single-atom catalysts. Over the past decade, in situ characterization techniques have rapidly advanced the progress of single-atom catalysts. The structures of single atoms have become increasingly diverse, with various forms, including grafted onto the support surface as ligand atoms, anchored in defective sites of defective state substrates, dispersed in alloy catalysts, and bonded in complex skeletons. These innovations have resulted in numerous new possibilities and opportunities in single-atom catalyst research.118–121 Different single-atom structures will improve the efficiency of catalytic reactions. For the OER, single-atom catalysts can enhance the efficiency of catalytic reactions and reduce the cost of catalyst synthesis. The catalysts used in industrial OER electrocatalysis still rely on noble metals, such as IrO2 and RuO2. Still, the scarcity and high price of noble metals limit the industrial progress of OER electrocatalysis. In addition, considering that electrocatalysis is a surface catalytic process, the active sites in the noble metal oxide bulk are not the true catalytic active centers, resulting in low conversion efficiency (TOF) and mass activity of the catalysts. In contrast, noble metal single-atom catalysts can precisely solve the problem of noble metal catalysis due to surface anchoring and 100% utilization.122–125 The design of highly active OER catalysts combining single-atom strategies has been extensively investigated. Spinel-type NiCo2O4 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies were prepared by using electrodeposition.126 The introduction of Ir species into the electrolyte results in the formation of single-atom Ir-loaded NiCo2O4 nanosheets. This coupling of Ir single atoms to oxygen vacancies contributes to the stability of single-atom catalysts. The TOF of Ir–NiCo2O4 nanosheets is six times higher than that of NiCo2O4 nanosheets. Despite the substantial increase in TOF, the percentage of noble metal Ir in the catalyst is only 0.41%, indicating that the single-atom strategy employed in this material successfully achieves efficient, stable, and cost-effective oxygen production. Theoretical calculations suggest that coupling Ir atoms with oxygen vacancies is beneficial in protecting Co's valence state, enhancing the catalyst's stability, and improving the charge transfer ability of Co single atoms. Additionally, this coupling allows for the effective adsorption of intermediates, ensuring the proper functioning of the catalyst. While researchers have significantly improved the TOF of Ir single-atom catalysts compared to IrO2, they still face challenges in reducing the overpotential for the OER. According to the Sabatier theory, a highly active catalyst cannot be either too strong or too weak in its adsorption energy to the reaction intermediates. Therefore, precise modulation of the adsorption energy of the single-atomic active site for oxygen intermediates is key to enhancing the OER catalytic activity of Ir single-atom catalysts. By anchoring single atomic Ir on Ni2P, researchers observed a very low overpotential of only 149 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Consequently, this research highlights that precise modulation of adsorption energy is crucial in optimizing the OER catalytic activity of Ir single-atom catalysts, as evidenced by the promising results obtained with a single atomic Ir anchored on Ni2P.127 IrSA–Ni2P exhibits significantly greater current density for the OER compared to IrO2 when the voltage reaches 1.53 V, reflecting the unique coordination environment of Ir single atoms. HAADF-STEM imaging indicates that Ir is situated directly above the Ni site, and EXAFS data indicate a coordination environment of Ir–O–P. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ir–O–P and Ni–O–P sites are essential in regulating oxygen intermediate adsorption and desorption.The layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a relatively mature transition metal OER catalyst, but the intrinsic catalytic activity is not high. The two-dimensional LDH layer is distributed with mutually exclusive anions.128 The interlayer of the support enables uniform distribution of cations due to electrostatic adsorption, providing an ideal precursor for single-atom catalysts. Leveraging this design principle, single-atom Pt was successfully introduced into the LDH through electro-reduction, resulting in a stable, single-atom interaction with the support material (Fig. 7a).129 HAADF-STEM images showed that Pt single atoms were evenly dispersed without agglomeration (Fig. 7b), and EXAFS analysis determined Pt's electronic states and coordination environment. The white line intensity of Ni3Fe–PtCl62− LDH indicated successful anchoring of high-valent Pt (Fig. 7c). At the same time, R-space fitting confirmed the formation of Pt–O bonds between Pt and LDH carriers via the electrochemical reduction approach (Fig. 7d). The study found that Pt-anchored LDH catalysts exhibited excellent HER and OER activities, which the significant enhancement of LDH conductivity could explain due to the introduction of Pt single atoms. In situ XAS and in situ Raman spectroscopy were used to trace the evolution of the single atomic material during electrocatalysis, ultimately revealing the efficient electrocatalytic activity derived from Pt single atoms. Moreover, the incorporation of Pt single atoms optimized the intrinsic structure of LDH, and the alternating synergistic interaction between Pt and LDH facilitated the adsorption and desorption of oxygen species intermediates. Research on noble metal single atoms has demonstrated the ability of catalysts to achieve both high activity and low cost. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of introducing Pt single atoms in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of LDH, with important implications for future catalyst design.

Research on non-noble metal single-atom has led to further cost reductions in recent years. In contrast, catalytic performance has even caught up with noble metal single-atom catalysts, which has placed higher demands on the design of single-atom catalyst structures. To improve atom utilization and reduce mass transfer resistance, anchoring single atoms on the surface of a substrate with a hollow support structure is an effective structural strategy. NiSAs@S/N-FCS was prepared using vapor-phase chemical deposition with single-atom Fe anchored on the outer surface of S/N co-doped hollow carbon spheres.130 The catalyst exhibited a remarkable performance with an overpotential of only 249 mV required to attain the current density of 10 mA cm−2. To better understand the electrochemical process, monitoring changes in the material is crucial. In this study, they employed an operando XANES device to track and analyze these changes (Fig. 7e). XANES spectra indicated that the absorption edge shifted towards higher energies as the voltage increased, suggesting a higher valence state of Ni (Fig. 7f). Furthermore, they observed a gradual increase in the first peak of Ni in real space with increasing voltage, which may be attributed to the interaction of water molecules with Ni under high voltage conditions (Fig. 7g).
They combined step diagrams and charge distribution of various catalyst models to identify the most efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). ACG-NiN4-SC exhibited the lowest reaction-determining step (RDS) energy barrier, making it a superior candidate for efficient catalytic OER (Fig. 7h–j). In addition, Ni–Fe bimetallic (oxygen) hydroxide is another more established bimetallic transition metal OER catalyst, but the material itself has no significant advantage for the adsorption of oxygen intermediates. When a third metal is introduced, the electronic structure of the catalyst is adjusted to achieve medium-strength adsorption and desorption of intermediates. Single-atom Mo anchored on Ni1−xFexOOH dramatically enhances the efficiency of water oxidation.131 The introduction of single-atom Mo modulates the coordination environment of Ni and Fe, resulting in a higher valence state of the transition metal. The OER catalytic process was traced experimentally using isotopically labeled O species. The excellent catalytic activity originated from converting OER from the AEM to the LOM by introducing a single atomic Mo. The OER process involving lattice oxygen excited by single-atom Mo leads to a significant reduction in the overpotential of the OER. Due to their unique electronic structure and high atomic utilization, single-atom catalysts are becoming a hot research topic. Still, the stability and low loading of single-atom catalysts are critical for further development. Future research can focus on the design of substrate catalysts to effectively improve the stability of single-atom catalysts and achieve extensive loading of single atoms.

2.2.3 Strong metal–support interaction regulation. In multiphase catalysts, various interesting structures often appear when metals are loaded on support leading to significant changes in catalytic activity and stability, which has received much attention from researchers.124,132–139 With the rise of nanomaterials research, strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) was formally introduced in the 1970s.140 The noble metal loaded on TiO2 is reduced at 200 °C followed by uniform dispersion on the support. The catalytic material obtained had a strong hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption capacity. Excitingly, the noble metal was still uniformly dispersed on the support when the reduction temperature was increased to 500 °C. Meanwhile, the material could hardly adsorb hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which is evidence of a strong interaction between the metal and the support.Later, a strong interaction between the metal nanoparticles Ru and the support TiO2 was observed using EXAFS.141 Specifically, the bond length of Ru–Ti is shorter when Ru is loaded on TiO2 than when Ru is loaded on metallic Ti. The shorter bond length strengthens the bonding between the atoms, indicating the metal–support strong interaction. To directly observe SMSI effects at the atomic scale, in situ HAADF was applied for the first time to trace the evolution of Pd/TiO2.142 In a reducing atmosphere, the Pd particles interact closely with TiO2. The exposed crystalline surface at the bottom of the Pd particles is reconstructed with increasing temperature, eventually leading to an ordered epitaxial growth. The electronic effects and stability of the SMSI effect make the material an excellent electrocatalyst for the OER. TiO2 is a typical semiconductor material, but the use of TiO2 for the electrocatalytic OER has been little studied due to its poor electrical conductivity. The conductivity of the catalyst can be effectively enhanced by embedding Ir nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface along with nitriding treatment.143 The catalytic activity and stability of electrochemically tested surface catalysts are significantly improved after loading Ir nanoparticles, which originates from the metal support strong interactions formed by Ir nanoparticles and TiO2: the introduction of Ir nanoparticles protects the durability of metal nitrogen oxides, and TiON hinders the excessive accumulation and oxidation of Ir nanoparticles. The SMSI effect is widely used in two-dimensional layered materials because two-dimensional materials have a high specific surface area, which can provide more contact sites for nanoparticles. In addition, nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the laminate can increase the dispersion to reduce the loading.144 Platinum nanoparticles confined on a two-dimensional layered LiCoO2 carrier allow for efficient total water cleavage (Fig. 8a).145 HER/OER bifunctional Pt/LiCoO2 provides switching of the active center. Specifically, Pt nanoparticles are the HER catalytic active center, and LiCoO2 acts as a co-catalyst. This unique interaction between the metal nanoparticles and the support effectively enhances the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. Generally, layered NiFe LDH tends to be the most catalytic material support, but when NiFe LDH is loaded on other supports, the catalytic activity of NiFe LDH is optimized.146 Eight conductive supports (metal foil, FTO, ITO, etc.) were used as the study objects to load NiFe LDH. The Co foil was considered as the support with the best OER catalytic activity. The results of in situ EXAFS and DFT theoretical calculations show that Co is doped in situ into NiFe LDH to form a strong interaction between the catalyst and the support. The conductivity of the catalyst is improved, and the electronic structure undergoes local optimization resulting in the activation of the active centre. It can be seen that the metal–support strong interaction is not only related to the type of active metal center but also closely related to the choice of the support.

Single-atom catalysts are ideal active metal catalysts, and the coordination environment around the single atom is closely related to the catalytic activity.147–150 The support design determines the coordination environment of the single atom. The current single-atom supports involve metal foil, metal (hydrogen) oxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, metal nitrides, metal carbides, and metal non-metallic compounds. The formation of strong interactions between the single atom and each support helps to stabilize the single atom, optimize the d-band center of the active site and change the electronic structure of the interface. The optimization of the electronic structure is closely related to the catalytic activity. The single-atom catalysts are ideal for electron–metal–support interaction (EMSI) studies because of their independent and well-defined electronic structure.
The application of EMSI facilitates the understanding of the electronic effects of single atoms and supports to a new level and is currently receiving much attention. For example, monodisperse single-atom Ru catalysts with support PtCu alloys construct unique core–shell structures.151 In situ EXAFS experiments showed that the electron transfer from Pt to Ru effectively prevented the chemical valence of Ru from rising, increasing the number of electrons. The present study employs theoretical calculations to examine the oxygen adsorption environment on various alloy catalyst surfaces (Fig. 8b). The results show that the Ru1–Pt3Cu(111) alloy is positioned close to the vertex of a volcano-type plot, indicating optimal intermediate adsorption strength (Fig. 8c). Further analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) and surface strain reveal that Cu exhibits weak intermediate O adsorption. In contrast, Pt enhances it, leading to the observed variation in η with the Pt ratio (Fig. 8d–f). To elucidate the outstanding antioxidant and anti-solvation properties of Ru1–Pt3Cu, they investigate the charge transfer of adsorbed oxygen on different Pt–Cu surfaces (Fig. 8h). The results indicate that the PtCu alloy contributes a significant amount of charge. In contrast, the Ru single atom contributes less, suggesting that the electrons necessary for the OER originate from the PtCu alloy rather than the monatomic Ru. This finding is significant as it helps preserve the stability of the Ru single atom during the catalytic reaction. This EMSI effect of single atom Ru and the carrier PtCu alloy not only helps to enhance the catalytic activity of the material but also provides an effective way to control the stability of the single atom. Since then, the effect of different single-atom positions on the catalytic efficiency of single-atom catalysts has received extensive attention. The single atom Ir can be selectively anchored at the CoOOH triple hollow sites and oxygen defects by controlling the synthesis conditions.152 The anchoring of single atoms at various sites leads to changes in coordination environments. Observations from EXAF and theoretical calculations have shown that Ir exhibits strong electronic interactions with the support after being anchored at the triple hollow sites of CoOOH. This interaction increases the conductivity of the catalyst while simultaneously optimizing the adsorption of oxygen intermediates through the EMSI effect. Conversely, when the Ir single atom is anchored at the oxygen defect of CoOOH, the EMSI effect fails to optimize the electronic structure of the Co and Ir sites due to unfavorable interatomic spacing. However, through hydrogen bonding, the Ir site effectively stabilizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, thereby reducing the reaction energy barrier for the decisive step. Both configurations enhance the OER catalytic activity of the material, providing novel insights into the electronic effects of single atoms and supports. The multi-phase modulation strategy provides more ideas to study efficient catalysts and achieve ultra-high activity of catalysts. The comparison of OER catalyst activity with multi-phase modulation strategies is shown in Table 2.

3. Alternative strategies and membrane-based electrolyzers
3.1 Anodic high-valuable products
The study of efficient OER catalysts is crucial for hydrogen production from the electrolytic water splitting industry and reducing the energy consumption of CO2 reduction and metal–air cells.153–155 The four-electron transfer process underlying the OER must manifest as sufficient energy output to drive hydrogen production through electrolytic water splitting, given that the OER represents a rate-limiting step in this reaction. While current research emphasizes the development of highly efficient OER catalytic agents, progress in this domain has been ongoing for decades. Despite these efforts, OER's theoretical equilibrium potential rests at 1.23 V vs. RHE, offering the critical bottleneck hindering the further minimization of hydrogen production costs. Additionally, considering the coupling of the HER and the OER, it becomes possible to generate oxyhydrogen within the same electrolytic cell. Furthermore, with a large amount of hydrogen–oxygen mixing, the risk of an explosion becomes significant. Moreover, the oxygen generated may become reduced at the cathode, compromising overall hydrogen production efficiency.156–158 Researchers have recently identified small organic molecule oxidation reactions as a viable alternative to the OER at the anode, which could address several issues. First, the low oxidation potential of small organic molecules can decrease the overpotential of electrolytic hydrogen production, thereby significantly improving the energy conversion efficiency. Second, this method enables the generation of economically efficient organic matter, as opposed to less lucrative oxygen, thereby generating value-added products that can find applications in the biomedical, fine chemical, and fuel energy fields. Finally, it offers the additional benefit of eliminating the need to use electrolytic cells with diaphragms, effectively avoiding the risk of hydrogen–oxygen mixing while reducing the design and cost of electrolytic cells. The aforementioned benefits serve as evidence for the promising prospects of utilizing organic molecule oxidation reactions as a viable and sustainable substitute for traditional OER processes.159–161 The careful choice of small organic molecules is crucial, as it necessitates not only a low oxidation potential to prevent competing reactions with the OER but also solubility in water at ambient temperature.162–167 The existing methods for the oxidation of small organic molecules under the conditions above can be broadly classified into two categories, namely electrochemical oxidation for the synthesis of small organic molecules, such as the oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes, carbohydrates, primary amines, and others, and small organic molecules as sacrificial agents for the degradation of pollutants, such as urea and hydrazine. Although the electro-oxidation reactions of these small molecule organics exhibit low overpotentials, the multi-electron transfer processes during their conversion result in sluggish kinetics, which impedes the catalytic reactions. Thus, the development of efficient catalysts for small molecule oxidation reactions is crucial to minimize overpotential and enhance reaction rates. Proper design of such catalysts will be essential for achieving these objectives.164
The 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrochemical oxidation to 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is an attractive OER substitution reaction because FDCA is a substitute for the critical chemical terephthalic acid.165,166 The electrochemical oxidation for preparing FDCA is green and non-polluting. Given this, high entropy oxides with a high density of active sites were designed as catalysts for HMF oxidation. The synthesis technique of low-temperature high-entropy oxides makes (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 with a larger specific surface area and oxygen defects.167 Its intrinsic electrocatalysis is far superior to high-entropy oxides synthesized at high temperatures. The OER activity of (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 is poor, with an onset potential of 1.50 V vs. RHE for OER. Still, when HMF is added to the electrolyte, the onset potential of the HMF oxidation reaction is only 1.35 V vs. RHE. After several cycles, the Faraday efficiency of FDCA is almost 100%, which indicates that (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 has high selectivity and stability for the oxidation of HMF. Meanwhile, (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 was applied to oxidize other small organic molecules. The electrochemical test surface (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 showed low starting potential and high catalytic activity for various organic compounds such as ethanol, glycerol, and glucose, which provided a new idea for hydrogen production by high entropy oxides with a reduced overpotential of total water decomposition. Considering the further enhancement of the activity of electrochemical oxidation of HMF, an in-depth study of the mechanism of the catalytic reaction of HMF is necessary. The adsorption and desorption ability of catalytic intermediates on the catalyst surface is the key to the modulation of catalyst activity. The electrochemical oxidation of HMF involves the conversion of organic precursors, intermediaries, and OH− at the active catalytic site. Oxygen vacancy-controlled spinel Co3O4 was used to understand the role of oxygen vacancy on the oxidation of organic matter and the catalytic oxidation mechanism of HMF at the atomic level.168 The electrochemical experiments showed that the oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 greatly influence the enhancement of HMF conversion efficiency and that Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies has a smaller onset potential. The operando XANES, quasi-operando XPS, and TOF-SIMS were used to trace the state of OH− and Co3O4 oxygen vacancies during the oxidation of HMF. The EXAFS fitting results showed the coordination structure of Vo-Co3O4. When the voltage increases to 1.30 V vs. RHE, the number of Co–O bonds gradually increases, indicating that OH− enters the lattice of Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies. The number of Co–O bonds gradually decreases, and the number of Co–CoOh increases with the voltage increase, indicating that the structure of CoTd in Co3O4 is transformed. Based on the results of in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, it was found that OH− adsorbed on oxygen vacancies, participated in the lattice oxygen oxidation process, and finally coupled with HMF. The process accelerated the mass transfer rate of HMF catalytic oxidation and improved the intrinsic activity of HMF electrochemical oxidation. Understanding the oxidation mechanism of HMF at the atomic level helps to design efficient and advanced catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxidation of small molecules.
Among the reactions for the electrochemical oxidation of synthetic small-molecule organic compounds, the catalytic oxidation of ethanol has attracted much attention. Ethanol is derived from fermentation of sugar and is considered a carrier of green energy. After electrocatalytic oxidation, ethanol conversion produces 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE), an important chemical product. Moreover, since ethanol contains up to 13.04 wt% of hydrogen, the direct production of high-value DEE from ethanol catalysis and hydrogen production aligns with the national carbon-neutral strategy. The 1 nm PtIr nanowires have unique advantages in the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol, requiring only 0.61 V ultra-low voltage to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9a–c).169 The Faraday efficiency of converting ethanol to DEE is 94% (Fig. 9d). The in situ IR results showed that PtIr nanowires were beneficial in promoting the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, followed by the last generation of DEE. After stability testing, PtIr nanowires showed no degradation in the selectivity and stability of catalytic conversion of ethanol to DEE, which is crucial for applying the catalyst (Fig. 9e).

According to statistics, a large amount of industrial and domestic wastewater containing urea is discharged into the environment every year, and untimely degradation of urea will lead to severe environmental pollution. Urea oxidation reaction coupled with the HER not only can degrade urea to alleviate environmental problems but also can reduce the voltage required for hydrogen production while effectively avoiding the risk of explosion caused by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. Although the theoretical voltage of urea oxidation is only 0.37 V vs. RHE, oxidation of urea is a kinetically slow six-electron transfer process. Therefore, the design of efficient electrocatalytic urea oxidation with the HER is a challenging task. Transition metal phosphide is a promising electrocatalyst due to its good electrical conductivity and Pt-like properties. The Ni2P/NiMoP nanosheets were prepared as bifunctional catalysts for urea oxidation and the HER on the nickel foam support using the one-step hydrothermal and annealing treatment.170 The unique coupling interface and electronic structure between Ni2P and NiMoP make the Ni2P/NiMoP nanosheets excellent HER catalytic activity, requiring only 22 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Interestingly, when urea is introduced into the electrolyte, the oxidation potential decreases from 1.49 V to 1.33 V. When a whole cell is formed, only 1.35 V is required to drive urea oxidation and HER to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Although some research has been done in the study of urea oxidation, the mechanism of urea oxidation still needs to be determined. Exploring the mechanism of urea oxidation is essential for designing efficient electrocatalysts. Urea is a complex organic small molecule containing an electron-donating amino group and an electron-absorbing carbonyl group. The in-depth study of the adsorption and desorption strength of different urea groups with catalysts benefits the design of high-performance urea oxidation catalysts. CoS2/MoS2 with Schottky heterojunction readily induces charge transfer between the two phases, resulting in electron-rich and electron-deficient centers with different adsorption abilities to electron-donating and electron-absorbing groups in urea.171 The electrochemical test results revealed that CoS2/MoS2 has impressive urea oxidation activity, requiring only 1.29 V to drive urea oxidation up to the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with good stability. Theoretical calculations indicate that CoS2/MoS2 is affected by the difference in Fermi energy levels leading to the redistribution of electrons. The electron-rich MoS2 side has a strong adsorption capacity for the amino group in urea. In contrast, the electron-deficient CoS2 side has a strong adsorption capacity for the carbonyl group in urea, activating the urea electrooxidation reaction and thus accelerating the reaction kinetics. This precise regulation of urea adsorption ability provides a new idea for enhancing catalyst urea oxidation ability.
Another sacrificial agent type of OER substitution reaction is the oxidation reaction of hydrazine. The oxidation of hydrazine has a lower potential than urea oxidation, only 0.33 V vs. RHE. In addition, the oxidation of hydrazine is a kinetically faster four-electron transfer process compared to the six-electron transfer process of urea oxidation. Meanwhile, electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine can achieve the degradation of N2H4 in wastewater. Bifunctional tubular CoSe2 nanosheets are an effective strategy for hydrazine oxidation-assisted efficient hydrogen production.172 An ultra-low voltage of only 164 mV is required to drive the HER and hydrazine oxidation up to a current density of 1 mA cm−2, significantly reducing the energy consumption for hydrogen production from electrolytic water. In situ-grown Ni3N–Co3N nanosheets exhibit unusual activity in electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation and alkaline electrolytes.173 At a small voltage of 200 mV vs. RHE, electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation can reach an ultra-high current density of 1000 mA cm−2. However, when a complete cell is formed with the HER, a current density of 400 mA cm−2 can be achieved at an ultra-low voltage of 0.76 V, which offers excellent potential for energy-efficient hydrogen production. Self-powered hydrogen production and hydrazine-safe handling can be performed simultaneously (Fig. 9f). The power density is maximum when the electrolyzer output voltage is 0.495 V (Fig. 9g). In addition, the integration of OHzS with DHzFC achieved self-powered hydrogen production (Fig. 9h). The hydrogen production showed an excellent linear correlation with the electrolysis time (Fig. 9i). The sustainable solar energy can drive the oxidation of organic molecules and hydrogen production simultaneously, providing a new idea for the practical application of the device (Fig. 9j). Theoretical calculations show that the excellent hydrazine oxidation performance and HER catalytic activity come from the charge rejection at the heterophase interface and the low ΔG*H.
3.2 Membrane-based electrolyzer
In addition to the electrocatalysts, the electrolysis cell design is essential in the hydrogen production system using electrocatalytic water splitting considering hydrogen production.174,175 Despite the significant reduction in the internal resistance of electrocatalytic cracked water achieved by a single-chamber electrolyzer, it fails to meet industrial production requirements due to its inability to circumvent hydrogen-oxygen mixing. Consequently, the two-chamber electrolytic cell with a diaphragm has emerged as a critical area of research focus. Its adoption is attributed to its ability to realize the separation of hydrogen and oxygen. However, the diaphragm in the two-chamber electrolytic cell often exhibits significant internal resistance, resulting in increased energy consumption during the electrolysis process. Hence, in designing an electrolytic cell diaphragm, the first consideration should be reducing the electrolytic cell's internal resistance. The resistance of the electrolytic cell is affected by the affinity of the membrane material to the electrolyte. Therefore, the design of highly hydrophilic membrane materials and improved electrolyte conductivity can facilitate charge transfer, thereby reducing internal resistance. Moreover, the electrolytic cell diaphragm divides the cell into a cathode chamber and an anode chamber, and the hydrogen and oxygen produced by electrolysis are released through the gas conduction ports of their respective chambers. Therefore, the gas tightness of the electrolytic cell diaphragm plays a crucial role in ensuring the purity of hydrogen and oxygen. Considering the voltage difference between the cathode and the anode during electrolysis and the corrosion of the electrolyte for a long time, the stability of the diaphragm is also highly required. At present, the two-chamber electrolytic cell used in electrolytic water hydrogen production technology mainly includes alkaline electrolytic cell, proton exchange membrane electrolytic cell (PEMEC), and anion exchange membrane electrolytic cell (AEMEC) (Fig. 10). In recent years, research on solid oxide electrolytic cells (SOECs) has gradually received widespread attention. Among these, the working temperature of alkaline electrolytic cells and PEMEC is generally below 95 °C, which is called low-temperature electrolytic hydrogen production technology and has been applied industrially.

The alkaline electrolytic cell, commonly used for hydrogen production from electrolytic water, typically employs a 30 wt% KOH solution with an industrial current density of 2 A cm−2 and operates at temperatures ranging from 60–90 °C. This design is considered one of the most advanced among current electrolyzers being researched. However, the diaphragms used in alkaline electrolytic cells are predominantly made of asbestos and silicate compounds. Although asbestos diaphragms are cost-effective and allow penetration of both anions and cations, their tendency to swell significantly diminishes the diaphragm's mechanical strength over prolonged operational periods, leading to increased internal resistance and energy consumption, negatively affecting the overall performance of the electrolytic cell. Moreover, the gas diffusion resulting from gas pressure differences between the anion and cation chambers presents a significant challenge in maintaining hydrogen gas purity during the electrolytic process. While an asbestos diaphragm can physically isolate the chambers, its drawbacks cannot be entirely mitigated, prompting the search for alternative diaphragm materials. Polymer diaphragms, such as polyphenylene sulfide, polyether ether ketone, and polysulfone, have gained attention due to their superior thermal stability and corrosion resistance. However, their poor hydrophilicity can result in higher internal resistance and reduced electrolytic efficiency. Therefore, the development of hydrophilic polymeric diaphragm materials is crucial to achieving both high stability and low internal resistance. A composite electrolytic cell diaphragm made of ZrO2 and PSF has been studied as an innovative solution to improve the electrolytic process.176 The introduction of ZrO2 significantly reduced the PSF organics film's internal and composite film's resistance in 30 wt% KOH electrolyte. The resistance of this hybrid film is only 0.3 Ω cm−2 in 30 wt% KOH electrolyte, which enables a lower tank pressure at the same current density. The stability was tested in 30 wt% KOH at 120 °C, with an average weight loss of 2% after 10000 hours. Later, the ratio of ZrO2 to PSF was adjusted to synthesize the composite diaphragm to achieve the optimal operating environment.177Although the conductivity and stability of commercial ZrO2 and PSF composite membranes with about 85 wt% ZrO2 have reached a high level, the average pore size is large and cannot avoid the problem of hydrogen–oxygen mixing. The content of ZrO2 was adjusted using the cast film method to control the pore size of the polymer membrane. The average pore size will be as low as 70 nm, which achieves efficient separation of hydrogen and oxygen even at high gas pressure differences.
To address stability and efficiency issues in alkaline electrolytic cells, researchers are focusing on the PEMEC. This technology overcomes alkaline electrolyzers' obstacles by eliminating spacing between the cathode, the anode, and the diaphragm, reducing the electrolyzer's mass transfer resistance.178–182 The reactant water only needs to enter the anode chamber to produce oxygen and H+, which is reduced to hydrogen after passing through the proton exchange membrane to the cathode chamber. The perfluoro sulfonic acid membrane, commonly known as Nafion 117, is widely used as a proton exchange membrane due to its thin structure and good proton transport properties. Furthermore, the penetration of hydrogen and oxygen is minimal at high pressures, thereby facilitating the collection of high-purity hydrogen in a prolonged high-voltage operating environment. The low thickness of Nafion 117 also contributes to reduced internal resistance in the electrolytic cell, thereby enhancing hydrogen production efficiency. Despite these advantages, the high cost of proton exchange membranes presents a significant limitation to widespread industrial use. The PEM used under acidic conditions avoids the formation of H2/O2 mixtures, enabling a more comprehensive loading range and safer electrolyzer operation and making them preferable for practical applications. However, electrocatalysts are often susceptible to deactivation and corrosion under acidic conditions due to the abundant production of H+ on the electrode surface, leading to chemical changes in the electrode material and deactivating the catalyst. Furthermore, water splitting in acidic environments requires high potential, which is achieved by applying high-voltage electricity. However, the high voltage can lead to the destruction of the catalyst structure, resulting in catalyst deactivation. Consequently, designing and developing stable electrocatalysts under acidic conditions is a significant challenge. Currently, researchers primarily enhance the stability of hydrolysis catalysts through material selection, structure optimization, electrode potential adjustment, and the addition of antioxidants. While currently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts exhibit improved activity and stability, their performance falls short of industrial application requirements, particularly at high current densities under acidic conditions. In the future, the design of acidic catalysts should focus on the reaction mechanism, catalyst mechanism evolution, and reorganization under acidic conditions, combining theoretical calculations and in situ characterization for calculating and synthesizing high-stability and high-activity acidic OER catalysts.
The AEMEC technology combines the advantages of alkaline electrolyzers and PEMEC technologies to provide faster response and higher current density while reducing cost.183,184 After reaching the anode, it is oxidized to produce water and oxygen. KOH or NaHCO3 solution was added to the feedstock as an additional electrolyte to further enhance the hydrogen production efficiency. Ammonium-enriched anion exchange ionomer binder significantly improved the AEM performance.185 By testing the electrochemical performance of different electrode systems, the current density of 2.7 A cm−2 can be achieved at 80 °C and 1 M NaOH electrolyte with only 1.8 V, making the performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art PEM electrolyzers. The superior full-cell properties result from removing phenyl groups from the polymer backbone, avoiding the formation of phenols and thus neutralizing the quaternary ammonium salts.
The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure electrolytic cell is a unique type of cell, in which the electrode is composed of a membrane electrode assembly rather than the traditional block electrode. The MEA includes a diaphragm film, an electrode, and a collector plate. Anode and cathode catalysts are coated on both sides of the MEA to generate oxygen and hydrogen, respectively, by applying a voltage. The MEA structure electrolytic cell has broad applications in water decomposition, hydrogen production, and fuel cell fields. Its use can significantly improve hydrogen production and water decomposition reaction efficiency, reduce cost, save space, and promote energy conservation and environmental protection. Moreover, high current density plays a vital role in MEA-structured electrolytic cells. It enhances the rate of electron transfer and ion transport as well as the rate of electrochemical reaction, thereby improving catalytic activity and reaction rate in MEA electrolytic cells and increasing hydrogen production. However, there are challenges in studying high current density in MEA cells, mainly the stability of the catalyst under high current density. When the catalyst is exposed to high current density, the surface of the catalyst may be damaged by corrosion, oxidation, precipitation, or other factors, affecting its long-term stability and service life. Therefore, it necessitates the development of more stable and efficient catalysts and the exploration of surface modification and protection techniques to extend catalyst life. Currently, researchers mainly study the design of high-current density catalysts from aspects such as catalyst size, morphology, and electron transport. The formation of a heterogeneous interface provides additional catalytic active sites for the OER catalyst and accelerates charge and substance transport. With a unique heterogeneous interface, Am-Mo-NiS0.5Se0.5, Ni2P@FePOxHy, and NiFe LDH/NiS have demonstrated ampere-level current density and high durability.186–188
In recent years, SOECs at high temperatures have attracted attention due to their excellent performance.189–191 The gaseous water molecules obtained from the SOEC system at high temperatures are reduced at the cathode to accept H+ and O2−. The O2− ions migrate through the oxide electrolyte diaphragm to the anode to be oxidized to produce O2. Some heat energy at high temperatures is used to drive hydrogen production by water decomposition instead of electricity, so hydrogen production efficiency by water electrolysis is greatly improved. However, SOECs are still in the laboratory research stage due to the high-temperature equipment and complex process.
Recently, in colleges and universities, the design of a membrane-based electrolytic cell has been combined with the electrolysis of natural seawater for hydrogen production to achieve selective hydrogen production from natural seawater without pretreatment.192 An electrolyzer for direct electrolysis of natural seawater was constructed using a spontaneously driven phase transition mechanism with a hydrophobic PTFE membrane as the gas permeation electrode interface. The design of the membrane-based electrolytic cell allows for the transport of raw water vapor while impeding the transport of impurity ions. It is equivalent to purifying the seawater first, avoiding the anode's chlorine oxidation reaction. This water phase change strategy enables efficient hydrogen production from natural seawater on a large scale. This study provides essential research ideas for the electrolysis of pure seawater.
4. Conclusions and perspective
Extensive research conducted on the OER has significantly contributed to advancing various applications, including electrocatalytic water splitting, CO2 reduction, and metal–air batteries, towards achieving carbon neutrality. Of these applications, renewable green energy-driven electrocatalytic hydrolysis is critical to achieving pollution-free hydrogen production. The efficient OER catalysts are the focus of research to overcome the energy barriers of electrocatalytic water splitting. In this paper, the mechanism of the OER and the design and modulation methods of OER catalysts with different materials in recent years are reviewed (Fig. 11). A comprehensive review was conducted on the regulation methods of catalyst activity, employing both single-phase and multiphase regulation strategies. The advantages of various regulation strategies are presented in Table 3. The correlation between the catalyst activity and microstructure is discussed based on experimental and DFT theoretical calculations. Innovative strategies for the OER are also explored, such as utilizing an OER substitution reaction to achieve low energy consumption and high-value hydrogen production through electrocatalytic hydrolysis and designing an electrolyzer system to address the challenge of hydrogen–oxygen mixing. Despite the significant progress made in studying the OER mechanism, catalytic active site modulation and activation, and long-term stability, advanced OER catalyst efficiency still falls short of the requirements for industrial applications, particularly highly active and stable integrated OER catalysts. This review offers some strategies to address these challenges and outlines potential research directions:

(1) The evaluation of catalysts remains a challenging task, as factors such as catalyst loading, substrate type, and electrolyte solution can influence their activity. Standardizing variables across various working systems poses a challenging obstacle, hindering the assessment of intrinsic activity. Furthermore, accurate evaluation of ECSA and TOF depends on the number of active surface sites. However, determining the actual surface area and the number of active sites is daunting, as electrocatalysis occurs solely on the surface of bulk materials. Therefore, to ensure an impartial evaluation of the catalytic activity of OER catalysts in different working environments, it is crucial to establish rigorous evaluation criteria.
(2) Despite several decades of research into OER catalysts, significant obstacles to their industrial application persist. One of the most significant challenges is the high cost associated with catalyst preparation, making it difficult to scale up production. Additionally, ensuring the stability of catalysts at high current densities on an industrial scale remains an area of continuing research interest. To tackle these challenges, future iterations of OER catalysts should prioritize minimizing expenses while refraining from employing methods involving elevated temperature and pressure. Given the challenge of kilogram-scale macro preparation, researchers should also explore simple and easily scalable synthesis methods such as the sol–gel method. Finally, materials must maintain structural stability despite large voltage and bubble disturbances, which is essential to ensuring catalyst stability.
(3) The limitations in designing highly active catalysts arise from a lack of understanding of their catalytic mechanisms. While the adsorption–desorption mechanism in the AEM can theoretically explain most OER mechanisms, the energy barrier of *OH and *OOH adsorption–desorption hinders further improvements in catalytic activity. Although alternative mechanisms have been proposed, it is imperative to investigate the material–reactant–electrolyte reaction mechanism to understand the nature of high catalytic activity better. Incorporating a conformational relationship perspective can assist in devising OER catalysts that are both more robust and effective. Therefore, further studies on the catalytic material–reactant–electrolyte reaction mechanism are necessary to overcome the limitations of the current understanding of catalyst design for the OER.
(4) The present study of catalyst research has successfully delved into atomic and electronic levels by employing DFT theoretical calculations. Nevertheless, since the theoretical models used in these calculations are often idealized and localized, discrepancies may exist between the calculated and experimental results. Furthermore, theoretical calculations often face the challenge of constructing an accurate model for the precatalysts, considered the active catalytic species in the OER. Thus, more advanced and reliable methods for theoretical calculations are needed to guide experiments better. By establishing a complete and accurate material library, it would be possible to screen for efficient OER catalysts effectively.
(5) Current research on the stability of catalyst structures is mainly restricted to pre- and post-OER testing characterizations, which may fail to capture the intricacies of the catalytic process. Nonetheless, the application of in situ or operando characterization techniques can provide a comprehensive comprehension of the material's progression, encompassing alterations in surface atoms and electrons. Hence, these methodologies proffer invaluable insights into crafting OER electrocatalysts that are both enduring and efficacious.
In conclusion, the design and development of OER catalysts have made significant progress in recent years, and innovative strategies have been proposed to advance the industrialization process. This review aims to consolidate these strides and expedite the research and development of exceedingly effective OER catalysts.
