    , Accepted 5th June 2017First published on 5th June 2017AbstractAll-inorganic perovskites, such as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), have recently emerged as highly promising optoelectronic materials due to their excellent physical properties, especially their higher thermal stability. However, the performance of a CsPbX3-based photodetector is worse than its counterparts based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. In this work, we demonstrate flexible high performance photodetectors based on the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure using solution-processesing. Owing to the interfacial charge transfer from perovskite to ZnO, the photocurrent of devices was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude after the introduction of a ZnO layer. The CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors exhibited high sensitivity with an on/off ratio of >104 under 450 nm light illumination and a high photoresponsivity of 4.25 A W−1. Furthermore, CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetectors with excellent stability and outstanding flexibility were also demonstrated. This work demonstrates that CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructures are promising for the construction of high-performance photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are considered to be promising materials for future optoelectronic applications due to their excellent physical properties, such as their large light absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and high carrier mobilities.1,2 Noticeably, the power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have skyrocketed from 3.8% to 22.1% during the past several years.3,4 Besides solar cells, there have been some pioneering studies on fabricating perovskite-based photodetectors, revealing excellent figures of merit such as high detectivity, ultrafast response speeds, and broad response ranges.5–10 Nevertheless, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite is unstable in a humid environment, which is still the main concern for its practical applications.11,12 To circumvent this problem, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) have been developed as alternative materials.13–27 It was reported that CsPbBr3 owned both a high absorption coefficient (∼2 × 105 cm−1)13 and large carrier mobility (1000 cm2 V−1 s−1),14 which are comparable to that of Si. For optoelectronic applications, Ramasamy and co-workers fabricated an all-inorganic perovskite photodetector from CsPbI3 nanocrystals and it exhibited a high on/off photocurrent ratio of 105.19 Song et al. reported flexible photodetectors based on CsPbBr3 nanosheets, and the high light on/off current was stable after bending and recovering for 10000 cycles.20 However, the performance of the all-inorganic perovskite photodetector was worse than its counterparts based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. One possible approach for improving the performance of perovskite photodetectors is to combine the perovskite layer with other functional materials, i.e., fabricating bilayer heterostructure photodetectors. Indeed, perovskite absorption layers have been integrated with several two-dimensional materials including graphene, WSe2, WS2, and MoS2.28–33 A major challenge in heterostructure photodetectors is the need to improve the photoresponse of a device while maintaining a low dark state current. For high conductivity materials such as graphene, the dark state current is too high, which is unfavorable for improving the on/off ratio of the device. Owing to its high electron mobility, tunable conductivity, solution-processability and good band alignment with CsPbX3,34–37 ZnO is a promising candidate for the fabrication of heterostructure perovskite photodetectors. In fact, for the same reason, ZnO has frequently been used as an electron transfer layer in the fabrication of perovskite solar cells.38–42
In this work, we demonstrate that the performance of the CsPbBr3 photodetector is remarkably improved by introducing a ZnO underlayer. Because of the high absorption and long diffusion lengths of charge carriers in perovskites, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs in the perovskites are expected to be transported to the interface CsPbBr3/ZnO and then to be separated by the built-in electric field. As a consequence, the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the perovskites is limited, and the photocurrent of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude compared with the reference CsPbBr3 device. Furthermore, a flexible photodetector was fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, and it exhibited excellent stability with a change in the photocurrent of less than 1.5% after 10000 bending cycles.
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. Firstly, a thin ZnO layer was deposited on the cleaned glass substrates by spin-coating a solution of ZnO nanoparticles, and then annealed on a hot plate in ambient air at 120 °C for 30 min. Next, the samples were transferred to a glove-box and an Au electrode was deposited on the ZnO layer by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. Sequentially, the CsPbBr3 layer was spin-coated on top of the Au/ZnO layer with a DMSO solution of CsBr and PbBr2. Residual DMSO was further removed by annealing the samples at 100 °C for 10 min. Fig. 1b presents a schematic device structure of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetector, and the corresponding optical microscopy image is given in Fig. 1c. To expand the applications of CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetectors, the device was also fabricated on PET substrates with excellent flexibility, as shown in Fig. 1d.

Fig. 2a presents a cross-sectional SEM image of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure sandwiched between a 40 nm ZnO compact layer and an Au coating layer. The observed samples were covered with Au to avoid the charge effect during SEM observation. The perovskite layer was dense and of uniform thickness of about 100 nm, with grains spanning the entire thickness of the film. The pristine CsPbBr3 film on the glass substrate showed a similar thickness and morphology (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows the I–V curves of the CsPbBr3-based photodetectors with and without a ZnO layer measured in the dark and under 450 nm laser irradiation with a light density of 16.42 mW cm−2. As extracted from Fig. 2b, after introducing the ZnO layer, the dark current of the photodetector slightly increased from 0.32 to 0.45 nA under an applied voltage of 10 V, while the photocurrent greatly improved from 0.18 to 4.94 μA at 10 V. Furthermore, the light on/off ratio was determined to be >104 and ∼560 for the CsPbBr3-based photodetectors with and without the ZnO layer, respectively. Notably, by combining the perovskite with the ZnO layer, the on/off ratio was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude. The I–V curves of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector measured at various power densities from 0.15 to 32.58 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 2c. At the same applied voltage, the photocurrent increased gradually with an increase in the power density, which can be attributed to a change in the photon intensity from the incident light.

Fig. 2d shows the responsivity spectrum of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector, which was obtained using a calibrated Si photodetector as a reference. The responsivity was increased with the applied voltage, and the maximum values of the responsivity were located at a wavelength of about 515 nm. The peak responsivity of the detector under 10 V reached 4.25 A W−1, which is much higher than that of commercial Si photodetectors (<0.2 A W−1). To investigate the temporal response of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetectors, the current–time (I–t) curves were measured under 450 nm laser irradiation at different voltages, as shown in Fig. 2e. The current in the dark and under illumination was controlled by a light shutter. The photocurrent remarkably increased with increasing applied voltage due to the increase in carrier drift velocity. Moreover, the on/off switching behavior was preserved over multiple cycles, indicating the robustness and reproducibility of our heterostructure photodetectors. To accurately determine the response time of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetectors, the I–t curve of the device was measured using a 450 nm continuous laser, which was switched on and off by a chopper working at 200 Hz. The rise time and decay time were defined as the time rise to (1 − 1/e) of the maximum photocurrent from the dark current and recovery to 1/e of the maximum photocurrent, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2f, the rise time and decay time of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector were determined to be 210 and 240 μs, respectively. In contrast, the on/off switching of the reference CsPbBr3 photodetector was slightly faster than that of the CsPbBr3/ZnO device (Fig. S2, ESI†). The above results demonstrate that the performances of CsPbBr3-based photodetectors, especially the high on/off ratio and the responsivity, are significantly improved by introducing a ZnO layer.
To understand the mechanism of photoelectrical response enhancement after inserting the ZnO layer, the optical properties of pristine CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO films were also characterized. Fig. 3a presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO films. Both spectra exhibit intense band gap absorption with a peak at around 516 nm, which is in good agreement with the peak responsivity of the photodetector shown in Fig. 2d. The band gap of CsPbBr3 was estimated to be 2.33 eV, which is consistent with the previously reported values.20,43–45 The light absorption in the CsPbBr3/ZnO film was almost unaffected by the presence of the ZnO layer, which could be attributed to its wide band gap (3.42 eV) and thin thickness (40 nm). Fig. 3b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO films. Both samples display a peak at 527 nm, which is consistent with the band gap of CsPbBr3. More importantly, the maximal PL intensity for the CsPbBr3/ZnO film was quenched by nearly 70% with respect to the PL intensity of the pristine CsPbBr3 film. Such a dramatic PL quenching is attributed to the efficient charge transfer at the interface and exciton dissociation,28–31 as schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. The enhanced photoresponse of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector can be understood from the band profile of the reference CsPbBr3 and the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector illuminated under a light source, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. In the reference CsPbBr3 device, photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the perovskite recombined within a few picoseconds (i.e., within the lifetime of the photoexcited electrons), resulting in significant loss of the photocurrent. However, in the presence of ZnO, the photoexcited electrons in the perovskite layer transferred to the ZnO layer with higher mobility, while the holes were left in the valence band of CsPbBr3 (Fig. 3d), where the CsPbBr3 played the double role of light harvester and hole conductor.6,46 As a consequence, the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the CsPbBr3 layer was limited, and the photocurrent was obviously increased. As mentioned earlier, the decay time of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector (240 μs) was longer than that of the reference CsPbBr3 device (150 μs, Fig. S2, ESI†), which is in good agreement with the reduced charge recombination. On the other hand, electron transfer from CsPbBr3 to ZnO increased (lowered) the Fermi level of ZnO (perovskite) and reduced the contact barrier, leading to a high photocurrent. Consequently, the interfacial charge transfer not only leads to the reduced charge recombination but also lowers the barrier height, and both are favorable for enhancing the photoelectrical response of devices.

The inset schematically represents the charge transfer at the CsPbBr3/ZnO interface under light illumination. The band profiles and working mechanisms of (c) the reference CsPbBr3 photodetector and (d) the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetector are also shown. 
It is well known that surface morphology and film quality play an important role in device performance and, therefore, forming dense, uniform and stoichiometric films is critical for improving the performance of CsPbBr3 photodetectors. In this work, the ratio of CsBr:PbBr2 in the precursor solution was found to be crucial for both the morphology and chemical composition of the CsPbBr3 films. The CsPbBr3 films were spin-coated on the ZnO layer from solutions with varied CsBr:PbBr2 ratios (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) in DMSO solvent. Fig. 4a–d shows the SEM images of the CsPbBr3/ZnO films synthesized from the different CsBr:PbBr2 ratios. As presented in Fig. 4a, when the lowest CsBr:PbBr2 ratio (0.5) was used, connected perovskite islands were formed and a significant portion of the substrate was exposed without CsPbBr3 coverage. Increasing the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio from 0.5 to 1.0 simply resulted in more coverage, while the morphological features looked quite similar (Fig. 4b). When increasing the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio to 1.5, the morphology exhibited both smaller and denser crystallites, which formed a dense and uniform film with a few pinholes (Fig. 4c), and which should be favorable for achieving the high performance of devices. Further increasing the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio did not significantly change the morphology, coverage, or grain size of the spin-coated perovskite films (Fig. 4d). However, some white particles were formed on the surface of the CsPbBr3 films, and this will be discussed later. In addition, the pristine CsPbBr3 films deposited on glass showed similar morphology to those on the ZnO layer (Fig. S3, ESI†).

(g) Temporal photoresponse of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors. 
The CsPbBr3/ZnO films deposited from the solutions with varied CsBr:PbBr2 ratios were also characterized using XRD measurements. As shown in Fig. 4e, polycrystalline orthorhombic CsPbBr3 (Pnma crystal structure) with an additional CsPb2Br5 phase45,47,48 was observed on the film deposited from PbBr2 rich solution (i.e. a CsBr:PbBr2 ratio of 0.5). The characteristic diffraction peaks from CsPb2Br5 disappeared with an increase in the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio, and the pure CsPbBr3 phase was observed for the films with CsBr:PbBr2 ratios of 1.0 and 1.5. That a PbBr2-rich precursor results in the formation of a CsPb2Br5 phase has been reported previously.45 On further increment of the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio to 2.0, a very weak peak at 12.72° associated with Cs4PbBr6 was observed,45,49 and we suspect that the white particles observed in Fig. 4d are Cs4PbBr6 grains. Indeed, the film with the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio of 3.0 exhibited a stronger XRD peak of Cs4PbBr6, and more white particles appeared on the film surface (Fig. S4, ESI†). This trend is qualitatively consistent with our above proposal. Both the SEM and XRD results suggest that uniform and pure CsPbBr3 films with fewer pinholes can be made from a solution with a CsBr:PbBr2 ratio of 1.5, and the best device performance is expected to be obtained with this ratio.
To illuminate the effect of morphology and film quality on the device performance, the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors were fabricated from the solutions with different CsBr:PbBr2 ratios. The I–V curves of the corresponding devices under 450 nm illumination with a light density of 16.42 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4f. The photocurrent at an applied voltage of 2 V increased from 2.9 to 418 nA when the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio varied from 0.5 to 1.5. However, further increasing the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio to 2.0 slightly reduced the photocurrent to 315 nA. The temporal photo responses of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors were also measured, as shown in Fig. 4g, and the on/off switching for all the devices was reproducible for multiple cycles. Again, the photodetector fabricated from the solution with the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio of 1.5 exhibited the highest photocurrent response, which is entirely consistent with the observation that the uniform and pure CsPbBr3 film with fewer pinholes was obtained under this concentration. Several studies have reported on CsPbBr3-based photoconductive detectors using nanostructures. Some of them exhibit good performance regarding response time, responsivity, and the on/off ratio, as listed in Table 1. However, achieving high performances of these aspects simultaneously is rather difficult. Our CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors exhibit better overall performance.

Recently, the fabrication of flexible optoelectronic devices on plastic substrates has received considerable attention owing to the proliferation of handheld, portable consumer electronics.6,20 To demonstrate the potential application of the present heterostructure photodetector in flexible optoelectronics, we spin-coated CsPbBr3/ZnO films on PET plastic substrates and constructed the corresponding flexible photodetectors. The electrical stabilities of the flexible CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector at various bending radii is shown in Fig. 5a. In the bending process, five different bending states of the flexible device were investigated and marked with the corresponding bending diameter. The currents through the flexible device remained nearly unchanged at an applied voltage of 2 V at five different states, indicating that the performance of the flexible device was not influenced by the external stress under both dark and light illumination conditions. Fig. 5b depicts the logarithmic I–V curves of the flexible device with different bending diameters under 450 nm light illumination. Once again, no obvious photocurrent change was observed under five different bending states. The flexibility of the CsPbBr3/ZnO photodetector was further evaluated after bending with a diameter of 10 mm for 10000 cycles. As shown in Fig. 5c, the device still showed excellent light-switching behavior after 10000 cycles of bending. The photocurrent of the flexible device slightly reduced from ∼412 to ∼406 nA after 10000 cycles of bending. The device is extremely stable with fluctuations of less than 1.5%. The above results demonstrate the excellent flexibility, good folding endurance and robust bending stability of the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors, which may greatly expand their application fields, especially in portable devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated and characterized high-performance CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors using a simple solution process. Owing to the interfacial charge transfer from perovskite to ZnO, the photocurrent of the devices was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude after introducing a ZnO layer. The CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors exhibited a high on/off ratio (>104), a high photoresponsivity (4.25 A W−1) and a fast response time (210 μs). Furthermore, a low-temperature processing approach offered a wider selection of potential substrates, and the CsPbBr3/ZnO detectors fabricated on polyethylene terephthalate substrates exhibited excellent stability and outstanding flexibility. These results demonstrate that the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterostructure photodetectors fabricated using a simple method show great potential for future applications.
Experimental section
Preparation of ZnO nanoparticles
ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized via hydrolysis and condensation of zinc acetate dihydrate using potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol, as reported previously.42 Firstly, the zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in methanol at 60 °C, and the KOH solution in methanol was prepared by stirring with a magnetic bar for roughly 30 min. Then, the KOH solution was added to the zinc acetate dihydrate solution under vigorous stirring. After 2 h, the heater and stirrer were removed and the nanoparticles were allowed to precipitate for an additional 2 h. The precipitate and mother liquor were separated, and the precipitate was washed twice using methanol. The ZnO solution used in this work was prepared by solving the precipitation methanol and n-butyl alcohol mixed solvent (1:1) at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1.
Preparation of perovskite precursor solution
The CsPbBr3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsBr and PbBr2 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution at varied CsBr:PbBr2 ratios (i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). The concentration of PbBr2 was 0.4 M for all the solutions. After stirring for 5 h at room temperature, clear solutions were obtained under the CsBr:PbBr2 ratios of 0.5 and 1.0. On the other hand, precipitates were observed for the solutions with CsBr:PbBr2 ratios of 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0. The precipitates in the CsBr-rich solutions were taken out and the upper transparent solution was filtered.
Characterization of perovskite layers
The morphology and thickness of the CsPbBr3 thin films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta-600). The optical absorption spectra of the samples were acquired using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer in the double-beam mode. The PL spectra were measured at room temperature with a HITACHIF-4500 spectrometer using the 380 nm excitation wavelength. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 spectrometer with Cu Kα as the X-ray source.
Device fabrication
Firstly, the glass and PET substrates were cleaned via sonication in sequence using neutral detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min, followed by treatment in a UV-ozone cleaner for 15 min. Then, ZnO was spin cast at 2500 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min. Next, the samples were transferred into a glove-box and the Au electrodes (80 nm) were deposited via thermal evaporation using a shadow mask under a high vacuum of 1 × 10−4 Pa. The electrode intervals were about 20 μm and the length was 500 μm. Next, the CsPbBr3 layer was prepared by spin casting the precursor solution on the ZnO layer at 2000 rpm for 4 min and drying at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the devices were heated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min.
Device performance measurements
All the device measurements were performed under ambient conditions. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were acquired using a Keithley 2450 source meter in the dark and under illumination. A 450 nm laser with adjustable optical power was utilized as the light source and the output power was measured using a laser power meter. To obtain the responsivity spectra, a broadband laser-driven light source (Energetiq, EQ-99X) was used, and the photocurrent was measured from the device under study, then divided by the lamp power calculated using a calibrated Si detector. The photoresponse time was recorded by an oscilloscope assisted with a chopper working at 200 Hz.
