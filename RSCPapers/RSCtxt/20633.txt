    , Accepted 22nd March 2022First published on 22nd March 2022AbstractThe oxidation of Sn(II) to the more stable Sn(IV) degrades the photovoltaic perovskite material CsSnI3; however, this problem can be counteracted via alkaline-earth (AE) doping. In this work, the electronic properties of CsSn1−xAExI3, with x = 0 and 0.25, and AE = Mg and Ca, were investigated via Density Functional Theory. It is proven that the synthetic reactions of all these perovskites are thermodynamically viable. Besides, a slight strengthening in the metal–halide bonds is found in the Mg-doped perovskite; consequently, it exhibits the greatest bulk modulus. Nevertheless, the opposite occurrs with the Ca-doped perovskite, which has the smallest bulk modulus due to the weakening of its metal–halide bonds. The calculated bandgaps for CsSnI3, Mg-doped and Ca-doped perovskites are 1.11, 1.32 and 1.55 eV, respectively, remaining remarkably close to the best photovoltaic-performing value for single-junction solar cells of 1.34 eV. Nevertheless, an indirect bandgap was predicted under Mg-doping. These results support the possibility of implementing AE-doped perovskites as absorber materials in single-junction solar cells, which can deliver higher output voltages than that using CsSnI3. Finally, it was found that Sr or Ba doping could result in semiconductors with bandgaps close to 2.0 eV.
1. Introduction
The most efficient perovskite solar cell (PSC), technology that will soon hit the market,1,2 has a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% with an active area of ∼0.1 cm2, according to the most recent report by Green and co-workers.3 Nevertheless, the toxicity of lead-based perovskites is a major concern, which can hinder the deployment of this technology.4 To the best of our knowledge, the most efficient PSC built using a 3D tin-based (Sn-b) perovskite reported in the literature has a PCE of 13.2%,5 which is barely above half the PCE of the lead-based photovoltaic device mentioned above, even with a smaller active area (∼0.4 cm2). Based on the fact that PCE is the most important criterion to reduce the cost, according to a levelized-cost-of-electricity study,1,6 Sn-b PSCs cannot be considered a replacement for lead-based PSCs nowadays. This problem is attributed mostly to the oxidation of Sn(II) to the more stable Sn(IV), which is mainly responsible for the unstoppable internal degradation of Sn-b perovskite materials.7
Sn-b perovskites can be organic or inorganic, depending on the cation occupying the A site in the ASnX3 perovskite, with X = halogen. Organic perovskites, also known as hybrid perovskites,8 have organic cations in their A site such as methylammonium (CH3NH3+, or simply MA) or formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+, or simply FA), which are the most employed cations thus far in lead-free PSCs.9 Conversely, inorganic perovskites can have monovalent cations in their A site, for example, Cs+ and Rb+. However, the performance of PSC devices based on organic perovskites is lower than that with inorganic perovskites due to the higher reactivity of the former with external agents (such as oxygen or water).10,11 Thus, the insertion of an alkaline-earth (AE) species in the crystal structure of the all-inorganic Sn-b perovskite CsSnI3 to form CsSn1−xAExI3 has been driven by the fact that partial metal substitution is already considered as a route to improve the stability of perovskite materials given that AEs present only the 2+ oxidation state.12
It is possible to gain insight into whether the CsSn1−xAExI3 compound will form a perovskite structure by calculating both the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t (eqn (1a)),13 and the octahedral factor, μ (eqn (1b)),14 as follows: (1a) (1b)where rCs and rI are the ionic radius of Cs and I, respectively, and rB is the effective ionic radius of the cations inserted in the B site of the ABX3 perovskite, which is calculated as follows: rB = (1 − x)·rSn + x·rAE;(1c)where rSn and rAE are the ionic radius of Sn and AE, respectively. Then, it is predicted that CsSn1−xAExI3 is a perovskite if t and μ fulfil the following empirical structural conditions:14,15 (1d)
Previous experimental and theoretical works have proven the viability of the inclusion of AE species in the ABX3 perovskite (A = FA+, MA+ and Cs+; B = Pb2+ and Sn2+; and X = I−, Br− and Cl−) due to the oxidation state of 2+ demanded by the perovskite compound on the site B. By inserting small amounts (mostly ≤10%) of substitutional Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba, it is possible to improve the performance of PSCs, i.e., an enhancement in their PCEs, open circuit voltages, and carrier mobilities.16–19 Furthermore, the inclusion of AECl2 (AE = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) as additives in the synthesis of conventional metal–halide perovskites (based on Pb or Sn) has enhanced the photovoltaic parameters of PSC devices.20
Herein, a study based on density functional theory (DFT) was carried out on the electronic properties of the CsSn0.75AE0.25I3 compound (x = 0.25) with AE = Mg and Ca (Fig. 1a), which is empirically predicted to have a perovskite structure (Fig. 1b), similar to CsSnI3 (t = 0.86 and μ = 0.52). For CsSn0.75Mg0.25I3, t = 0.89 and μ = 0.47, and for CsSn0.75Ca0.25I3, t = 0.87 and μ = 0.51, where both (empirical) structural factors correspond to both compounds, fulfilling the conditions in eqn (1d). Despite having a high concentration of AE in the perovskite crystal,19 it is the smallest one that can be modelled in the perovskite unit-cell (Fig. 1a). In fact, no perovskite structure is empirically predicted beyond x = 0.5 in the CsSn1−xMgxI3 compound (Fig. 1b); moreover, segregation processes can occur in the metal–halide perovskite when the doping amount of Mg is greater than 1%, as was the case for MAPbI3.19 Nevertheless, this work can help elucidate the physical and chemical repercussions of incorporating AE species to obtain CsSn0.75Mg0.25I3 (referred herein simply as 0.25-Mg, due to the concentration level and the AE dopant) and CsSn0.75Ca0.25I3 (named 0.25-Ca hereon), which are intended to be used as absorber materials in PSC devices. It is worth mentioning that only Mg (rMg = 0.72 Å) and Ca (rCa = 1.00 Å) were selected in this study for primarily two reasons. Firstly, even though Sr (rSr = 1.18 Å (ref. 21)) has a six-coordinated ionic radius closer to that of Sn (rSn = 1.15 Å) than Mg, Ca and Ba (rBa = 1.35 Å (ref. 21)), both Sr and Ba can induce broad bandgaps.23 Thus, both perovskite compounds, CsSn0.75Sr0.25I3 (t = 0.86 and μ = 0.53) and CsSn0.75Ba0.25I3 (t = 0.85 and μ = 0.55), would be out of the scope of photovoltaic applications due to their wide bandgap. This aspect was corroborated in Section 4. Secondly, Mg and Ca are among the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust,24 and thus their abundance can make emerging photovoltaic technology environmentally friendly, and in the long run, they can reduce the manufacturing cost.25 It is worth mentioning that all the alloys in the CsSn1−xCaxI3 compound are empirically predicted as a perovskite material (Fig. 1b), but higher concentrations of Ca may also derive semiconductors with broad bandgaps, which can limit their implementation in single-junction solar cells.23

(b) Goldschmidt (t) and octahedral (μ) factors of CsSn1−xAExI3, which were calculated using eqn (1a)–(1d), were used to delimit the perovskite structure region. rCs, rI, rMg and rCa were taken from ref. 21, and rSn was taken from ref. 22. 
2. Computational details for determining structural, mechanical and electronic properties
The CsSnI3 perovskite presents four distinct structural phases as a function of temperature;26 nevertheless, in the present work, only the orthorhombic B-γ perovskite was modelled (Fig. 1a). The main reasons for this selection are because it can exist at room temperature and it is a photoactive semiconductor, having a bandgap of 1.30 eV and direct electronic transitions.26 There exists another crystal structure at room temperature, the Y phase, but it is not a photoactive semiconductor given that it possesses a wide bandgap (2.55 eV) with indirect electronic transitions.26 Thus, the Y-phase was discarded. Both 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites were modelled through the substitution of one tin atom in the unit-cell (UC) of CsSnI326 by the Mg and Ca AEs as necessary.
All the ab initio calculations of the electronic properties in this work were based on DFT as implemented in the SIESTA code.27 To describe the exchange and correlation interactions, a functional in the frame of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was chosen, namely, the one proposed by Zhang and Yang,28 which is a revised version of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (revPBE). For the description of the valence electrons of all present species, it was employed a polarized double-ζ basis set with an energy shift of 0.22 eV in conjunction with norm-conserving Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials29 in their fully non-local form.30 The first Brillouin zone of CsSnI3, 0.25-Mg, and 0.25-Ca perovskites for both the electronic-property calculations and the geometric-structure-optimization processes was sampled by a 7 × 5 × 7 grid. In the case of reactants, different k-meshes were used, where for both MgI2 and CaI2, a 7 × 7 × 4 grid was used, whereas for CsI and SnI2, two grids, i.e., 8 × 8 × 8 and 4 × 12 × 5, were employed, respectively. All the mentioned k-meshes were described by means of the Monkhorst–Pack approach.31 Moreover, based on the convergence calculations performed on CsSnI3, MgI2 and CaI2 (Fig. S1 of ESI 1†), an energy cut-off of 600 Ry was used to define the real-space grid of numerical integrations for all structures studied in this work. Besides, all geometrical optimizations were performed with no symmetry restrictions and until all forces involved in the crystal were smaller than 5.0 × 10−3 eV Å−1. It is worth mentioning that corrections for dispersion interactions were not considered for all the calculations. The inclusion of dispersion interactions in all-inorganic perovskites is not as crucial as in organic perovskites because semiempirical corrections are much more important for systems that are bonded by long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions or where hydrogenated molecules are involved.32,33
In the search for an accurate description of the bandgap of CsSnI3, three additional functionals at the GGA-DFT level, together with scalar relativistic (SR) corrections and considering all the electrons of the system, were utilized, as implemented in the DMol3 code.34 These functionals included HCTH/407,35 BOP36–38 and RPBE.39 Besides, the same k-mesh mentioned above in conjunction with the computational conditions of ref. 40, the additional restriction that all atomic orbitals must equal zero at 7.5 Å from their atomic centre was applied. It is important to mention that the HCTH/407 functional has been demonstrated to be one of the most precise functionals in describing the bandgap within the GGA-DFT theory.41
Some first insights into the electronic effects of AE doping in CsSnI3 were inferred through the lengths of the bonds between the iodine anion and the metallic cations M (M = Sn, Ca, and Mg) given that the bond order varies inversely with the bond length,42,43i.e., the shorter the M–I bond length, the greater the number of electronic states that are overlapping within the bonding region. Formal insights were obtained by means of a population analysis within the approach of the Voronoi Density Deformation (VDD) method.44 Likewise, as an empirical reference on the nature of the M–I bonds, the fraction of ionic character for isolated bonds was determined through the amount of ionic character (AIC), which is based on Pauling's electronegativity principle:45 (2)where χi is the electronegativity of the ion i. Even though the AIC values were calculated on isolated bonds, they can serve as a reference given that within the Pauling approach, the bond energy, EAB, between species A and B is proportional to the difference χA − χB.46
To determine the bonding and antibonding contributions to the electronic energy bands and indicate the bond strength of the M–I bonds for undoped and doped CsSnI3, a crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis was performed, which partitions the energy-band structure into orbital-pair interactions. Bonding interactions were characterized by negative values of COHP, whereas antibonding interactions exhibit positive COHPs. It worth mentioning that the COHP curves quantify the number of overlapping states (NOS) per unit of energy times the integral of the Hamiltonian over the orbitals hybridizing at the considered electronic energy.47 Thus, by integrating the COHP curves (ICOHP) over the occupied-states energies, the bond strength is demonstrated.47
Mechanical properties were studied through the bulk modulus (B0) by fitting the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state48 to the total electronic energies at different volumes for all three perovskites (CsSnI3, 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca). For this, the total electronic energy of twenty-one unoptimized UCs with different volumes was calculated for each perovskite compound (sixty-three structures in total, due to the three perovskite compounds). In each case, the minimum energy value corresponded to the total electronic energy of the previously optimized UC of the CsSnI3, 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites, and the volume of these previously optimized UCs was changed by increasing or decreasing the three lattice constants by 0.5%.
Besides, to see if the doped perovskite materials could be obtained in the laboratory, the formation energy (EF) was calculated, which is the energy released when compounds AX and BX2 react to form perovskite ABX3.49 Particularly, in the present case, the synthetic route considered to obtain the 0.25-AE perovskites CsSn0.75AE0.25I3 was: (3a)
Therefore, EF was defined as: EF = ECsSn1−xAExI3 − [ECsI + (1 − x)·ESnI2 + x·EAEI2];(3b)where ECsSn1−xAExI3, ECsI, ESnI2 and EAEI2 are the total electronic energy of CsSn1−xAExI3, CsI, SnI2 and AEI2, respectively, and x = 0 or 0.25.
A negative value of EF indicates that the chemical reaction is exothermic, i.e., the product is energetically favourable with respect to its components.
The atomic orbitals contributing to the valence (VB) and conduction (CB) bands were elucidated by means of fat-band depictions on the dispersion-relation, ε(k) (electronic energies as function of the reciprocal-space points), i.e., circles superimposed over the curves ε(k) whose diameters (denoting the fat-band thickness) represent the weight of individual electronic angular-momentum states per atomic species in the Kohn–Sham wavefunctions. Therefore, the thickness of a fat-band is proportional to the sum of the squared modulus of the coefficients in the expansion of the Bloch states,50 which is normalized to allow the Kohn–Sham wavefunction to be composed only by the single atomic electronic state for which it is drawn the fat band, and its value is 1.
Finally, to observe the effects of the insertion of an AE species in CsSnI3 on the charge transport at the electronic band edges, the effective masses were calculated along the [100], [010] and [001] reciprocal-space directions having the top of the valence band (TVB) and the bottom of the conduction band (BCB) as the starting point, and by addressing the relation 1/m* = 2 × constant/ħ2, where the constant is evaluated by fitting ε(k) to the quadratic function ε(k) = constant × k2.
3. Results and discussion
The four possible positions to place an AE atom in the orthorhombic cell of the B-γ perovskite were considered to inspect the optimized geometrical structures, as shown in Section 3.2 (see Fig. S2 of ESI 1† to visualize the other optimized structures, which are not presented in Fig. 3). However, it is worth mentioning that they led to the same total electronic energy once they were subjected to DFT geometrical optimization (ESI 1†); therefore, the electronic and mechanical properties described below were computed over only one structure for each 0.25-AE perovskite (Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, firstly, the thermodynamic stability of all three perovskites was considered.
3.1. Thermodynamic stability in the perovskite-formation reactions
The negative values of the formation energies, EF, for the CsSnI3, 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites (Fig. 2) predict that they can be experimentally obtained, that is, the reactions of eqn (3a) when x = 0.25 are exothermic, which means that the separate phases CsI, SnI2 and AEI2 are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the formation of the single phase CsSn1−xAExI3 with x = 0.25.51
 Fig. 2  Formation energy, EF, for CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskite compounds. The purple, silver, dark-green, light-green and blue spheres represent the I, Sn, Cs, Mg and Ca atoms, respectively. 
These results could be evinced by the synthetic process of both only the Sn-b and 0.25-AE perovskites given that in the one-step deposition method, low temperatures (≤180 °C) are sufficient to boost the reactions.17,19 However, the EF values for both the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites were less negative than that for CsSnI3; subsequently, there is a risk that at higher x values, CsSn1−xAExI3 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes into separate phases.52 Thus, additional studies varying the AE concentration (x) are essential to give extensive theoretical support to the thermodynamic stability of reactions leading to CsSn1−xAExI3.
3.2. Structural properties
The agreement obtained for all the structural parameters of the UCs of CsSnI3, MgI2 and CaI2 with the experimentally reported values is remarkable, as shown by the relative errors below 10% (Table 1). For the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites (Fig. 3a), the α, β, and γ angles scarcely deviated from the right angle (Table 1), which is indicative of a low octahedral distortion with respect to that of CsSnI3.40 Nevertheless, both 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca did not retain the Glazer tilt pattern (G-tp) a−b+a− that CsSnI3 possesses (due to its Pnma symmetry), given that all the optimized structures of the 0.25-AE perovskites obtained a P1 symmetry (even positioning an Sn atom where the AE species are located). Nevertheless, the UC used to study the CsSnI3 perovskite retained the same Pnma symmetry after the geometrical optimization process. Thus, to further examine the octahedral distortion, it was necessary to analyze each of the four octahedrons that all the UCs employed here have (Fig. 3b). To do this, each octahedron was characterized by three parameters, i.e., the length of the M–I bond (li), the nearly right angle formed by the I–M–I bond within the octahedron (Φi) and the angles (θa, θb and θc) between the vectors ,  and , and the UC vectors ,  and  (Fig. 3b), respectively. Based on the work by Park et al.,53 these angles were defined as follows: (4)

(b) Illustration of the angle (Φi), bond length (li) and vectors (, , , ,  and ) employed to characterize the octahedral distortions. The visualization of the unit-cell was deliberately changed to show the four octahedrons considered to compute the shown information.

For simplicity, the octahedrons are distinguished only by the metal embedded at their centres, as shown in (a); therefore, when there is more than one metal species involved, the label employed was “Sn/Mg” or “Sn/Ca”. The four octahedrons in (b) were considered to obtain the averaged values plotted in (c), (d) and (e).

For CsSnI3, MgI2 and CaI2, the relative error obtained with respect to the experimental values taken from ref. 26, 56 and 57 is indicated in parentheses, respectively

Fig. 3c shows the plots of the averaged values of all the li and Φi computed for each perovskite system, i.e., the 〈l〉 and 〈Φ〉 values for the Sn, AE and Sn/AE octahedrons. As can be seen from Fig. 3c, on average, the octahedrons did not suffer a significant distortion given that the 〈Φ〉 value of all the octahedrons was equal to 90°. The only internal distortion that they suffered “in general” was related to 〈l〉, where distinct values of 〈l〉 due to the presence of AE species provoked changes in the volume of the octahedrons in the 0.25-AE perovskites and they moved away from the perfect octahedral form, even further than the octahedrons in CsSnI3. Finally, given that 〈Φ〉 was equal to 90° in all the octahedrons in the perovskites, there is no off-centering of any of the metals in the octahedrons, and thus lone pair formation may not take place in these perovskite compounds.54
Besides, based on the average angles 〈θa〉, 〈θb〉 and 〈θc〉, the octahedral tilting of the AE octahedrons was different from that of the Sn octahedrons in the 0.25-AE perovskites (Fig. 3d and e), leading to symmetry breaking and the resulting P1 structures for the 0.25-AE perovskites. The Mg octahedrons are less tilted than the Sn octahedrons in the 0.25-Mg perovskite due to both 〈θa〉 and 〈θc〉 given that they are smaller in the former than in the latter; nevertheless, both octahedrons had similar values for 〈θb〉, which means that there is a more significant mismatch on the tilt from the vertical axis of the (Mg and Sn) octahedrons in the 0.25-Mg perovskite (b in the G-tp a−b+a−) than that from the horizontal axes (each a in the G-tp a−b+a−). In contrast, based on all three average angles 〈θa〉, 〈θb〉 and 〈θc〉, the Ca octahedrons presented a greater tilt from all directions than that of the Sn octahedrons in the 0.25-Ca perovskite, i.e., both types of octahedrons presented the same G-tp a−b+a−, but each term in that G-tp involves a greater tilt in the Ca octahedrons than in the Sn octahedrons. Nevertheless, despite having obtained symmetry breaking due to the octahedral tilting in the 0.25-AE perovskites, when 〈θa〉, 〈θb〉 and 〈θc〉 of both AE and Sn octahedrons are compared among them, the differences are not greater than 1.5°. This explains why the results in Fig. 3d and e are scarcely perceptible in Fig. 3a, being more obvious in the 0.25-Mg perovskite than in the 0.25-Ca perovskite. Notwithstanding, as shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† the discrepancies between the octahedral tilting of both the AE and Sn octahedrons are magnified to be appreciated.
These inhomogeneous octahedral distortions presented by the 0.25-AE perovskites were also reflected by the volumes of the UCs. There was a decrease by 3.4% in the UC volume of CsSnI3 with the substitution of Sn by Mg and, whereas a very small increment of 0.8% with substitution by Ca (Table 1). Thus, as the volume variation was not substantial, it is expected that an insignificant deviation from the right angle for α, β, and γ occurred (Table 1).
These changes in volume are in agreement with the ionic radii of the AEs, which are 0.72 and 1.00 Å for Mg2+ and Ca2+,21 respectively. The ionic radii of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are smaller than and similar to that of Sn2+ (1.15 Å), respectively. Nevertheless, although it is expected that the UC volume of the 0.25-Ca perovskite is smaller than that of CsSnI3, the opposite result was obtained. In fact, the literature presents contradictory results for ionic radii. For example, Shannon21 and Travis et al.,22 through a revision of structural data, concluded that Sn2+ has a greater ionic radius than that of Ca2+; however, it was previously found by Rahm et al.55 that in both isolated neutral and isolated first-ionized Ca, relativistic effects induce both radii be greater than that of isolated Sn. Besides, considering that the use of Grimme's pairwise dispersion corrections32 did not improve the structural description of CsSnI3 (Table S1 of ESI 1†) the possibility of attributing the above-mentioned opposite result to the lack of dispersion interactions was discarded.
Therefore, to delve into the above-mentioned volume variations, the M–I bonds were analysed. The Sn–I bonds were categorized according to whether they participated in the AE–I–Sn or Sn–I–Sn bridges, considering also whether these bonds were bridged by an apical or an equatorial I (Fig. 4a and b), respectively. The average values for all the M–I bond lengths are listed in Table 2. As expected, the Mg–I bonds were smaller than that of Ca–I for both the apical and equatorial I atoms. Besides, the Mg–I bonds were smaller than any Sn–I bond in the 0.25-Mg perovskite. On the contrary, the average bond lengths of the Ca–I bonds in the 0.25-Ca perovskite were larger than that of the Sn–I bonds. In CsSnI3, the apical Sn–I bond length was smaller than that of the equatorial Sn–I, as experimentally reported;26 nevertheless, this inequality was not fulfilled in the 0.25-Mg perovskite, where the apical Sn–I bond was greater than the equatorial Sn–I bond in the Mg–I–Sn bridge.

Moreover, in the 0.25-AE perovskites, the length of the Sn–I bond in the AE–I–Sn bridge (with I being either apical or equatorial) is greater than that of the Sn–I bond in the Sn–I–Sn bridge (Table 2), i.e., Sn–I bond lengths (for I also coordinating an AE) > Sn–I bond lengths (for I simultaneously coordinating two Sn).
It is worth noting that the dissimilarity among the Sn–I bond lengths in the 0.25-AE perovskites could bring about Jahn–Teller effects.58 Moreover, all the aforementioned M–I bonds (apical and equatorial) result in distinct octahedral distortions among the four octahedrons in the UCs of the 0.25-AE perovskites. In fact, the standard deviation of the average values of θa, θb and θc for each of the optimized structures of both the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites is greater than zero in all cases (ESI 2†).
3.3. Atomic charges and ionicity of (Sn, Mg or Ca)–I bonds
The distinct lengths of the Sn–I bond in the 0.25-AE perovskites (Table 2) suggest that they have distinct bond orders, which indicates that one can modulate the overlapping crystalline orbitals in the Sn–I bonds by means of substitutional AE impurities in the CsSnI3 perovskite. For the CsSnI3 perovskite, the VDD populations analysis obtained the same positive charges at all the Sn atoms and the same negative charges at all the I atoms, independently of whether the latter was apical or equatorial. This occurs because inside the CsSnI3 crystal, each Sn or I atom essentially has the same atomic environment as any other atom of the same species (Fig. S4 of ESI 1†). Even though the distances of an I atom to its nearest and second-nearest neighbours depend on whether is located at the apical or equatorial position, these distances are similar for both types of I. Nevertheless, the Sn–I bonds at the AE–I–Sn bridges, with I being either apical or equatorial, presented a more ionic nature than that of the Sn–I bonds at the Sn–I–Sn bridges in the 0.25-AE perovskites (Table 3), given that there is a greater amount of positive and negative charges surrounding each species in the former bridges than in the latter. Moreover, the Ca atoms concentrated more positive charges than Mg in the 0.25-AE perovskites, as expected, given that Ca is less electronegative than Mg.

The distinct bond lengths found for Sn–I are evidence of the different bond energies among the metal–halide bonds. These changes in bond energies originate from the χI − χSn difference (as Pauling's theory suggests) because of the presence of cations with a more ionic character, leading to an AIC of 34% and 43% for the Mg–I and Ca–I bonds, respectively, both being greater than 12% of AIC for Sn–I bond (Fig. 4c). This assumption can be supported by the fact that, as mentioned above, the atomic charges at the Sn–I bonds are different among the CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites (Table 3). Besides, the AIC-percentages indicate that the Mg–I bonds are more covalent than the Ca–I bonds, which agrees with the greater amount of positive charge obtained on the Ca atoms than that on Mg atoms. This was reinforced by the electronic density in the Sn–I–Sn and AE–Sn–I bridges (Fig. 4d), where an increase in the loss of charge concentration was perceived between the metal and halogen in the Sn–I, Mg–I, and Ca–I bonds, in agreement with the same increasing tendency of the AIC percentages. Furthermore, a reduced electronic cloud was detected between Sn and I in the AE–I–Sn bridges compared with the Sn–I–Sn bridges in CsSnI3, which agrees with the increased amount of positive charge on the Sn–I bonds in the AE–I–Sn bridges (Table 3). Finally, there is a reduced charge concentration between AE and I when passing from Mg to Ca, which reflects the more ionic character of the Ca–I bonds with respect to the Mg–I bonds.
In conclusion, the very small increment in the UC volume of the 0.25-Ca perovskite with respect to that of CsSnI3 (Table 1) is due to the greater ionicity induced by Ca2+, as revealed by the bond distances, AIC, electronic density, and VDD atomic charges. Therefore, the increment in the UC volume of the 0.25-Ca perovskite has a chemical origin. It worth mentioning that although Mg2+ also increases the ionicity, it does not increase the perovskite UC volume because its ionic radius is appreciably smaller than that of Sn2+ (61% of its relative size); on the contrary, the Ca2+ ionic radius is closer to that of Sn2+ (85%).
3.4. Bonding and antibonding properties of electronic energy bands
To analyze the strength of the M–I bonds in all three perovskites, the ICOHP values for each of them were calculated (Fig. 5), which ordered from the strongest metal–halide array to the weakest one as follows: −1.551 (0.25-Mg perovskite), −1.520 (CsSnI3), and −1.498 eV (0.25-Ca perovskite). This ordering is in agreement with the UC volumes found above for all three perovskites given that it is expected that the ICOHP magnitude increases inversely with the UC volume, i.e., with the separation between the atomic species. In the present case, the smallest (greatest) UC volume was found in the 0.25-Mg perovskite (0.25-Ca perovskite) as a consequence of the more ionic nature of Ca with respect to that of Mg.
 Fig. 5  COHP analysis of the different atomic species involved in the M–I bonds. ICOHP values for total M–I, Sn–I and AE–I bonds are also shown. 
It is important to note that the upper third of the VB in all three perovskites is constituted only by the antibonding states of the Sn–I bonds, except for the 0.25-AE perovskites (Fig. 5). The electrons in this energetic region do not participate in bonding but are extended over the crystalline structure instead and can be photoexcited to the conduction band, which is useful for a material to be implemented in a photovoltaic device. Nevertheless, at the conduction band, the electronic states are even more antibonding, which can hinder the electronic photo-electronic transitions.
Interestingly, Mg and Ca cations do not contribute to the antibonding states at the VB, only with the bonding states; however, they produce antibonding states at the bottom and close-to-the-middle of the CB, respectively, without merely replacing the antibonding Sn–I states. Furthermore, the presence of AE species in the 0.25-AE perovskites diminished the positive-COHP height at the bottom of the conduction band, which means that the presence of both AE species would diminish the weakening of the bond strength in case the CB is occupied by photoexcited electrons from the VB.
It is noteworthy that doping CsSnI3 with substitutional Mg is more convenient than with substitutional Ca because with the former the ICOHP value becomes more negative than with the latter, as mentioned above.
3.5. Mechanical properties: bulk modulus
The bulk modulus of the CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites exhibited the same decreasing order that was observed for the ICOHP values (Fig. 6), as follows: 19.967 (0.25-Mg perovskite), 19.403 (CsSnI3) and 18.891 GPa (0.25-Ca perovskite). Thus, when reducing the perovskite volumes by the same fraction, the required hydrostatic pressures reveal that the density of the interionic interaction energy (i.e., the cohesive energy density) increases more in the 0.25-Mg perovskite than in CsSnI3, but the opposite occurs in the 0.25-Ca perovskite. Specifically, the bulk modulus results indicate that the internal pressure preventing the atomization of the CsSnI3 perovskite gains strength by means of substitutional Mg but it becomes weaker through substitutional Ca. It is noteworthy that the value of B0 for CsSnI3 calculated in this work (Fig. 6) is in agreement with that computed by Chung et al. (19.840 GPa),26 which contributes to the reliability of the results reported herein.
 Fig. 6  Total electronic energy as a function of UC volume for CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites. Insets show the respective bulk modulus (B0). The solid lines in orange are the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fits. The sum of the squared residuals in all curves is below 8.3 × 10−4 (ESI 2†). 
However, despite of having performed the partial substitution of Sn by species from a different block in the periodic table, B0 only increases by 2.9% through substitutional Mg and decreases by 2.6% through substitutional Ca. In this case, studies can be found in the literature in which the variation in B0 is more substantial at the same level of theory and employing the same equation of state, but comparing different perovskite systems. For example, in the transition from orthorhombic B-γ (the phase employed in the present study) to high-temperature cubic B-α phase, there is an increment of 15.3% in the value of B0.59 Further, by inserting substitutional Cl in the B-α CsSnI3 perovskite to form CsSnI2Cl, B0 increases by 11.0%.60 Experimentally, a more substantial bulk-modulus improvement was found by the total substitution of FA by MA in an organic perovskite compound,61 where among the FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 perovskites, there is a bulk-modulus increment of 41.4%.
The bulk modulus reported herein for all three Sn-b perovskites are comparable to that of organic lead-based perovskites, but the former has the advantage of being more environmentally friendly than the latter. Therefore, the CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites can be used instead of lead-based perovskites in photovoltaic devices. Besides, the above-mentioned comparison presented different routes for increasing the bulk modulus of perovskite materials, particularly that of Sn-b perovskites, through strengthening of the metal–halide bonds. Considering that perovskite materials are employed to harvest the charges in PSCs, sandwiched by charge transport materials in a p-i-n or a n-i-p architecture, an increment in the bulk modulus can represent an improvement in endurance upon compression of the charge transport materials.
3.6. Atomic-orbitals contributions to the electronic energy bands
As expected, the VB and CB of the CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites are mostly constituted of I-5p and Sn-5p orbitals, respectively (Fig. 7). Particularly, the upper third of the VB is constituted by the hybridization of the Sn-5s and I-5p orbitals. The states provided by the Mg-3s and Ca-4s orbitals in the 0.25-AE perovskites are located at the bottom of their respective valence bands; thus, these orbitals do not interfere in the transport of holes. Furthermore, both the I-5s and I-5p orbitals hybridized with both the Mg-3p and Mg-3s orbitals in the 0.25-Mg perovskite, and with both the Ca-4s and Ca-4p orbitals in the 0.25-Ca perovskite. By means of an additional COHP analysis (Fig. S6 of ESI 1†), it was possible to elucidate that the overlapping of both the p and s orbitals from the AE with both p and s orbitals from the halogen contributed to the states of both the VB and CB.
 Fig. 7  Energy band orbital characters visualized as fat-bands superimposed on the electronic-dispersion-relation, ε(k); the graphs are for all three perovskites studied in this work. The top of each column indicates the perovskite compound. Each row projects the fat-bands belonging to a specific orbital (s or p) from a certain atomic species (Sn, Mg, Ca or I). The high symmetrical points in the first Brillouin zone were taken from ref. 62. All dispersion graphs were obtained using the revPBE functional. 
Nevertheless, as considered for both the Mg-3s and Ca-4s orbitals, both Mg-3p and Ca-4p do not interfere in the transport of holes in their respective perovskites. It is worth noting that owing to the octahedral coordination of Ca in the 0.25-Ca perovskite, contributions from the 3d orbitals in both the VB and CB can be expected,63 where sp3d2 hybridization occurs. Notwithstanding, considering previous results from first-principles calculations,64 the inclusion of Ca-3d orbitals in the total hybridization between both the Ca and I orbitals may raise the energy of the bonding between the Ca and I atoms.
In the 0.25-Mg perovskite, the Mg-3s orbitals mainly participate in the transport of electrons in addition to the Sn-5p orbitals, given that they were involved in the BCB. However, the Mg-3s orbitals modified the reciprocal-space position of the BCB from Γ (0,0,0) to T (0,1/2,1/2) (Fig. 7), i.e., the electronic transitions in this perovskite are indirect. The BCB is constituted by the hybridization between the Sn-5p, I-5p and Mg-3s orbitals. Therefore, the 0.25-Mg perovskite may not be a good absorber material as CsSnI3 in PSCs. Besides, in the 0.25-Ca perovskite, the Ca-4s states were located at higher energies from the BCB, and therefore as in CsSnI3, the BCB is constituted by the hybridization between the Sn-5p and I-5p orbitals and its bandgap is direct. With respect to the states provided by the I-5s orbital and Cs atoms, it was previously proven that the contribution of the former to the VB and CB is minimum,65 and the contribution of the latter occurs at energies far from the band edges.66,67 This aspect was corroborated by the projected partial density of states, as shown in Fig. S7 of ESI 1.†
3.7. Bandgap (Eg) of CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites
The revPBE functional with no SR corrections underestimated the experimental Eg value of CsSnI3 (0.43 eV theoretical vs. 1.30 eV experimental), as shown in Table 4. However, the improvement in the description of Eg from the HCTH/407, BOP and RPBE functionals using SR corrections is well known, and all the Eg values obtained from these functionals were comparable to the previous results obtained by means of the HSE06 functional (Table 4). Furthermore, the most precise functional among the tasted ones was HCTH/407, from which an Eg that is 14.7% below the experimental value was obtained for CsSnI3.

As demonstrated by previous theoretical studies,69,70 relativistic corrections were necessary to obtain a good description of the bandgap of CsSnI3. However, considering the SOC at this level of theory (DFT-GGA) underestimates the bandgap of metal–halide perovskites even using hybrid functionals71 (as can also be seen in Table 4). Thus, to obtain a good approximation of the bandgap considering spin–orbit interactions, it is necessary to employ a higher level of theory, such as the quasiparticle self-consistent GW theory.72 Moreover, given that neither the excited electronic states nor the optical properties of the perovskite materials were studied in the present work, it is valuable to obtain the bandgap energy values by means of SR corrections.
Therefore, for the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites Eg values of 1.32 and 1.55 eV were obtained using the HCTH/407 functional (Table 4), indicating that the bandgap increased by 0.21 eV and 0.44 eV due to the presence of Mg and Ca, respectively, in the perovskite structure. This significant change is probably attributed to the high concentration of AE in the metal–halide perovskite, given that it was previously reported that when MAPbI3 is doped with small amounts of Sr (Sr represented less than 1% of the metal species in the perovskite structure), the resulting compound retained practically the same bandgap as the undoped compound.19
Alternatively, considering the radiative limit (in-rad-lim), i.e., discarding any recombination process in the photovoltaic device distinct to the radiative process, the bandgap-size criterion for a semiconductor to be considered as an absorber material in a single junction device to obtain a PCE above 30% is 0.94 ≤ Eg ≤ 1.60 eV.73 Thus, the 0.25-Mg perovskite is well suited to serve as an absorber material in PSCs with the p-i-n (or n-i-p) architecture. Besides its indirect bandgap, the 0.25-Mg perovskite not only fulfils the above-mentioned condition, but its Eg is also close to the ideal value (1.34 eV), where the maximum photovoltaic power can be generated.74 Moreover, the upper limit of the PCE for a PSC employing the 0.25-Mg perovskite in-rad-lim would be 33.5%, that is, 0.3% below the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit.75 The 0.25-Ca perovskite also fulfilled the bandgap criterion, even though it can serve as one of the absorbers in a multijunction PSC, in conjunction with CsSnI3 given that there are no significant structural discrepancies between them (Table 1). Moreover, considering that the widely used perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 has been reported to have a bandgap of 1.63 eV,76 the 0.25-Ca perovskite should not be discarded to be implemented in single-junction PSCs. In fact, the upper limit of the PCE for a PSC based on the 0.25-Ca perovskite in-rad-lim would be 31.5%, i.e., 2.3% below the SQ limit.72 Based on the work by Nayak et al.,77 by employing the 0.25-Ca perovskite in a PSC, the open circuit voltage (VOC) and the voltage at maximum power (VMP) could increase up to 1.0 V (Fig. S8 in ESI 1†). Due to the fact that 3D Sn-b perovskites deliver an average VOC of 0.5 V,78 by inserting substitutional AE in CsSnI3, this problem can be overcome without counteracting the efficiency of the PSC device. Of course, the PSC in-rad-lim is far above the PCE that a photovoltaic device can achieve. To put things in perspective, the best PSC using a 3D Sn-b perovskite as absorber material, in which a VOC above 0.5 V has been reported,5 exhibited a PCE of 13.2%; however, its upper limit in-rad-lim is 32.7%,73i.e., 147.7% above the reported PCE.
Besides that, the fill factor (FF) of a solar cell (which is a parameter of the performance of the device) is proportional to the bandgap.77 Given that both 0.25-AE perovskites have a wider bandgap than CsSnI3, a PSC built using them can exhibit a better performance than that employing CsSnI3. It is worth mentioning that a PSC employing the 0.25-Ca perovskite is empirically predicted to have an FF that is higher than the best Sn-b PSC reported in the literature (Fig. S8 of ESI 1†); therefore, a PSC based on the 0.25-Ca perovskite can be a competitive device.
3.8. Hole and electron effective masses
Compared with the dispersion-relation ε(k) curves of CsSnI3, that of the 0.25-AE perovskites are flattened at the upper third of the VB around the Γ point, i.e., the presence of substitutional AE atoms induced heavier holes than that in CsSnI3 (Fig. 8). This was revealed by the effective masses of the holes,  (where M = Sn, Mg, and Ca for the holes in the CsSnI3, 0.25-Mg, and 0.25-Ca perovskites, respectively), which for all three assessed directions followed the order of .
 Fig. 8  Effective masses of the charge carriers (in units of free electron mass, me) of all three perovskites. The k-space directions [100], [010] and [001] are along the straight path Γ → X, Γ → Y and Γ → Z (or [00] for T → Y and [00] for T → Z in the 0.25-Mg perovskite), which were considered in the parabolic fitting. Red label specifies the high symmetrical reciprocal point where the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band were located. See Fig. S10–S12 of ESI 1† for further details. 
Alternatively, holes are expected to be lighter than electrons in Sn-b perovskites;72 nevertheless, this was not the case for the CsSnI3 and the 0.25-Ca perovskites along the [001] direction, where the inequality  was fulfilled. The same is true for the 0.25-Mg perovskite due to the presence of Mg states at the CB, given that the electrons are lighter than holes  along the directions parallel to the [010] and [001] directions. Notwithstanding, it was remarkable that the electrons became heavier along the [010] direction in the first Brillouin zone of both the CsSnI3 and 0.25-Ca perovskites. Despite being a 3D perovskite, the heaviness of the electrons resembles that of 2D dimensional perovskites,79 where  given that there is almost no dispersion on the ε(k) curve along the vertical direction.80
As observed in previous theoretical studies, considering the SOC in the calculations magnifies the dispersion of the ε(k) curves, primarily at the CB due to the Sn-5p states.72,81 Consequently, there is a reduction in the  and  values for the Sn-b perovskites down to one or even two orders of magnitude, relative to the electron rest mass,72,81 where the experimentally determined hole effective mass in MASnI3 is  (in units of free electron mass, me).82 In contrast, the dispersion curves generated by SR corrections are very similar to that obtained with no relativistic corrections or additional contributions (Fig. S9 of ESI 1†), i.e., similar results were obtained from these two methodologies for the charge carrier effective masses of CsSnI3 (Table S4 in ESI 1†). In the present case, the true benefit of having performed SR calculations relies on the values obtained for the energy bandgaps. Therefore, further studies are needed to corroborate if the above-mentioned inequalities and related effective masses prevail under the consideration of the SOC in the theoretical calculations.
With respect to the anisotropy found for the charge carrier effective masses (Fig. 8), Wu et al.83 found that it was related to the occupation of the 5pi (i = x, y, and z) orbitals of both I and Sn, which are the main contributors to the VB and CB, respectively.
4. What about Sr and Ba?
At the beginning of this work, the use of alkaline-earth species with ionic radii greater than that of Ca abandoned, such as Sr or Ba. Both CsSn0.75Sr0.25I3 (0.25-Sr perovskite) and CsSn0.75Ba0.25I3 (0.25-Ba perovskite) fulfil the empirical structural conditions for the perovskite structure, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t = 0.86 and 0.85, respectively) and the octahedral factor (μ = 0.53 and 0.55, respectively). Nevertheless, it was argued that both substitutional Sr and Ba may increase the bandgap considerably.
Thus, to clarify any doubt in this regard, the bandgap energies for these perovskites were calculated by means of the HCTH/407 functional on structures that were previously optimized using the computational parameters in Section 2. The obtained bandgaps for both 0.25-Sr and 0.25-Ba perovskites were Eg = 1.87 and Eg = 2.12 eV (Fig. 9), respectively, confirming that these perovskites possess a wider bandgap than any of the perovskites studied above. Even though both values are situated far from the ideal interval (the one in green in Fig. 9) for single-junction solar cells, these materials resulted in direct electronic transitions, which facilitate their applicability in photoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, photocatalysts, and field-effect transistors, where lead-free perovskites have been already implemented.89 Nevertheless, the upper limit of the PCE in-rad-lim for the PSC devices based on the 0.25-Sr and 0.25-Ba perovskites would be 25.7% and 20.3%, respectively. Despite being theoretically predicted to have both VOC and VMP above 1.0 eV (Fig. S8 of ESI 1†), both 0.25-Sr and 0.25-Ba perovskites are limited by their PCE in photovoltaic devices due to their wide bandgaps.
 Fig. 9  Bandgap energy of CsSn0.75AE0.25I3 with AE = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba (in this order in the graph). All diamonds in blue are the experimentally determined bandgaps from distinct 3D Sn-b perovskites found in the literature (ref. 84–88), arbitrarily allocated in horizontal positions. As a guide to the eye, a red dotted-line has been drawn for bandgaps values of CsSn0.75AE0.25I3. The bandgap value of the “Champion Sn-b perovskite” was taken from the PSC with a PCE of 1.32% (ref. 5) mentioned above. The energy interval in green, where a PCE > 30% could be achieved in-rad-lim, was taken from ref. 73. 
It is interesting to note that the bandgap of the 0.25-AE perovskites increased linearly with the principal quantum number of the AE valence electrons (Fig. 9). This increment is consistent with the gradual decrease in the electronegativity going down the AE group, which implies an increment in the ionicity of the metal–halide bonds90 (as already proven for the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites). Similar bandgap behaviours have been reported by varying the volume of both the halogen and monovalent cation in metal–halide perovskites;40,69,86,91,92 nevertheless, it must be mentioned that non-linear bandgap changes were found by varying the size of the (non-AE) divalent metal cation.62,93 Then, the above-mentioned finding highlights the possibility for linearly tuning the bandgap of CsSnI3 through the insertion of substitutional AE species. Notwithstanding, Dimesso et al.94 experimentally studied the analogous compound MASn1−xAExI3 with AE = Mg, Ca and Sr, but the bandgap energies found did not change linearly when the volume of the AE species increased at a particular concentration (x); in fact, there was no increment in the bandgap when going from Mg to Sr at x = 0.1 or 0.3.94 Previously, a similar discrepancy was found by Chen et al.95 for the quaternary compound Cu2ZnSnX4 (X = S or Se), where they theoretically calculated different bandgaps for both Cu2ZnSnS4 (1.50 eV) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (0.96 eV), but previous experimental reports delivered similar bandgaps for both compounds (∼1.50 eV). Nevertheless, as in the work by Chen and co-workers, the present theoretical calculations were performed on perfect crystals, avoiding any difficulties in the characterization process.95 Thus, extensive scrutiny is suggested to corroborate if the linear behaviour (or similar bandgap changes) found in the present work prevails experimentally. Actually, Ba has an 88% greater volume than that of Mg,21 and therefore, a perceptible increment in the bandgap is expected, where in the present case, the bandgap increased 61% from the 0.25-Mg perovskite to the 0.25-Ba perovskite.
Finally, to assess the bandgap tunability in Sn-b perovskites, other Eg values are shown in Fig. 9. More complex perovskites should not be discarded in further studies.
5. Conclusions
In summary, a density functional theory study was performed on the CsSnI3 perovskite doped with substitutional Ca and Mg to study their effects on the structural, mechanical and electronic properties of CsSnI3. The formation energy was calculated for the alkaline-earth-doped perovskites CsSn0.75Mg0.25I3 (0.25-Mg perovskite) and CsSn0.75Ca0.25I3 (0.25-Ca perovskite) to see if it would be possible to synthesize them in the laboratory. Although all three perovskites could be obtained theoretically in the laboratory, there is a possibility of making the CsSnI3 perovskite more unstable by the insertion of substitutional alkaline-earth (AE) species.
The presence of AE species in the tin-halide perovskite results in four distinct octahedral distortions in the crystal solid (due to the 20-atom unit cells). Besides, although the discrepancies were not significant, the octahedrons based on Mg cations in the 0.25-Mg perovskite were less tilted than that involving Sn cations, whilst the octahedrons based on Ca cations in the 0.25-Ca perovskite were more tilted than that where Sn cations were implicated.
Likewise, the volume of the former was reduced as expected given that Mg2+ is visibly smaller than Sn2+. On the contrary, despite the fact that Ca2+ is slightly smaller than Sn2+, the unit cell volume of the 0.25-Ca perovskite was enhanced, although in a minor fraction. Besides, it was elucidated by means of the analysis of the Sn–I bond in both the Sn–I–Sn and AE–I–Sn bridges that the Sn–I bond increases its ionicity when it intervenes in an AE–I–Sn bridge (AE = Mg or Ca). Therefore, the metal–halide bonds acquired more ionic character by the insertion of AE species. This aspect in conjunction with the similar size between Ca and Sn encouraged the increment in the unit cell volume of the 0.25-Ca perovskite.
Furthermore, the 0.25-Mg perovskite had the greatest resistance to uniform compression given that it possessed the highest bulk modulus among the perovskites studied. Thus, the strengthening of the metal–halide bonds by means of substitutional Mg could prevent the oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV) in CsSnI3. The opposite happened in CsSnI3 with substitutional Ca, given that the 0.25-Ca perovskite presented less resistance to uniform compression than CsSnI3. These results were due to the strength of the M–I bonds (M = Sn, Mg, and Ca), as revealed by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population.
With respect to the electronic properties, the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites had an indirect and direct bandgap, respectively, with a bandgap (Eg) of 1.32 eV for the former and 1.55 eV for the latter. Both bandgaps were calculated by means of the HCTH/407 functional, which delivered a good approximation for the CsSnI3 perovskite (Eg = 1.11 eV) with a deviation from the experimental value of 0.2 eV. Based on the fat-band analysis, it was elucidated that the hybridization of the Mg-3s, Sn-5p and I-5p orbitals was responsible for the indirect bandgap in the 0.25-Mg perovskite, whereas the Ca-4s states were located at higher energies, far from the bottom of the conduction band in the 0.25-Ca perovskite. In addition to the change in the bandgap magnitude, the insertion of substitutional AE species also produced an increment in the hole effective masses, which is not beneficial for perovskite solar cells.
Nevertheless, owing to both the wider bandgap and direct electronic transitions of the 0.25-Ca perovskite, photovoltaic devices based on the latter can bring about higher power conversion efficiencies and open circuit voltages above 0.5 eV; therefore, the low-open-circuit-voltage problem of lead-free solar cells can be overcome and their performance can be enhanced. Further studies are required to determine if the proposed materials, 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites, yield benefits as absorber materials in photovoltaic devices.
By employing the same methodology, the bandgaps for the 0.25-Sr (CsSn0.75Sr0.25I3) and 0.25-Ba (CsSn0.75Ba0.25I3) perovskites were also calculated, obtaining Eg = 1.87 eV for the former and Eg = 2.12 eV for the latter; nevertheless, due to their bandgap magnitudes, the performance of a single-junction solar cell based on these materials is limited. Finally, the bandgap of the 0.25-AE perovskites increased linearly with a gradual decrease in electronegativity on going down the AE group, consistent with the expected increment in ionicity of metal–halide bonds.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Optimized structures for CsSnI3 and the 0.25-AE perovskites (with AE = Mg or Ca). (b) Illustration of the angle (Φi), bond length (li) and vectors (, , , ,  and ) employed to characterize the octahedral distortions. The visualization of the unit-cell was deliberately changed to show the four octahedrons considered to compute the shown information. (c) Average values 〈l〉 and 〈Φ〉 for the Sn and AE octahedrons within all three perovskites. (d) and (e) Average values of the angles defined in eqn (4) for the 0.25-Mg and 0.25-Ca perovskites, respectively, compared to that of CsSnI3 experimentally determined26 (Sn-Exp.) and obtained in this work (Sn-Theo.). For simplicity, the octahedrons are distinguished only by the metal embedded at their centres, as shown in (a); therefore, when there is more than one metal species involved, the label employed was “Sn/Mg” or “Sn/Ca”. The four octahedrons in (b) were considered to obtain the averaged values plotted in (c), (d) and (e).

 	Fig. 5  COHP analysis of the different atomic species involved in the M–I bonds. ICOHP values for total M–I, Sn–I and AE–I bonds are also shown.	 

 	Fig. 6  Total electronic energy as a function of UC volume for CsSnI3 and 0.25-AE perovskites. Insets show the respective bulk modulus (B0). The solid lines in orange are the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fits. The sum of the squared residuals in all curves is below 8.3 × 10−4 (ESI 2†).	 

 	Fig. 7  Energy band orbital characters visualized as fat-bands superimposed on the electronic-dispersion-relation, ε(k); the graphs are for all three perovskites studied in this work. The top of each column indicates the perovskite compound. Each row projects the fat-bands belonging to a specific orbital (s or p) from a certain atomic species (Sn, Mg, Ca or I). The high symmetrical points in the first Brillouin zone were taken from ref. 62. All dispersion graphs were obtained using the revPBE functional.

 	Fig. 8  Effective masses of the charge carriers (in units of free electron mass, me) of all three perovskites. The k-space directions [100], [010] and [001] are along the straight path Γ → X, Γ → Y and Γ → Z (or [00] for T → Y and [00] for T → Z in the 0.25-Mg perovskite), which were considered in the parabolic fitting. Red label specifies the high symmetrical reciprocal point where the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band were located. See Fig. S10–S12 of ESI 1† for further details.	 

 	Fig. 9  Bandgap energy of CsSn0.75AE0.25I3 with AE = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba (in this order in the graph). All diamonds in blue are the experimentally determined bandgaps from distinct 3D Sn-b perovskites found in the literature (ref. 84–88), arbitrarily allocated in horizontal positions. As a guide to the eye, a red dotted-line has been drawn for bandgaps values of CsSn0.75AE0.25I3. The bandgap value of the “Champion Sn-b perovskite” was taken from the PSC with a PCE of 1.32% (ref. 5) mentioned above. The energy interval in green, where a PCE > 30% could be achieved in-rad-lim, was taken from ref. 73.
