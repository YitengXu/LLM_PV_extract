Similarly, s-MBI films have a high absorption coefficient (∼103 cm−1) and an indirect band gap of ∼1.8 eV. Moving from s-MBI to Ns-MBI, the value of absorption coefficient is ∼103 cm−1 and the band gap corresponds to ∼2 eV.

1 Introduction
Recently, halide-based perovskite materials have been identified as strong potential candidates for various opto-electronic applications. Organic–inorganic and hybrid organic–inorganic halide-based perovskite materials are effective due to their unique properties such as a long charge carrier diffusion length, a high absorption coefficient (104–105 cm−1), low synthesis cost,1 high charge carrier mobility,2 tunable band gap (1.5–2.3 eV),3etc. Metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of semiconductor materials for a wide range of applications, such as solar cells,4–6 photodetectors7–9 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),10–12 lasers13,14etc. Among these applications, photodetectors are of primary importance as they bridge the gap between photonics and electronics. The synthesis of metal halide perovskites for photodetector applications has been reported by several groups. For example, Hu et al.15 demonstrated high performance flexible photodetector applications based on pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films deposited by a vapour solution method. Yang et al.16,17 reported the synthesis and fabrication of all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites for photodetector application. However, most of the metal halide perovskites for photodetector application are based on toxic lead (Pb). Furthermore, the lifetime of these Pb-based metal halide perovskite photodetectors is low due to the chemical instability of the material. Therefore, it is necessary to replace Pb in these perovskite materials by a non-toxic element. To achieve Pb-free perovskite materials, several attempts have been made to replace Pb by group 14 elements such as tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge).18,19 However, replacement by Sn and Ge in perovskites results in poor stability due to oxidation effects. Bismuth (Bi) is the adjacent element to Pb and it has properties that are similar and comparable to those of Pb.
Thus, to overcome the above problems, researchers replaced lead (Pb) with bismuth (Bi) and have succeeded in fabricating Pb-free Bi-based single perovskites such as MA3Bi2I9,20 CsBi3I10,21 and Cs3Bi2I9,22 and also double perovskites such as MA2AgBiI623 and Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Br and Cl).24 Such Pb-free perovskite materials have been successfully employed in opto-electronic devices. For example, Zhaoyang Qi et al.25 prepared highly stable, Pb-free Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanoplates for visible light photodetection application. They fabricated photodetectors that exhibited fast rise and decay times of 10.2 and 37.2 ms, respectively, with a specific detectivity of ∼1010 Jones. Bai et al.26 reported the preparation of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite films for solar cell applications. Cuhadar et al.27 synthesized Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite films and showed their application in low-voltage switching resistive memory.
A variety of methods have been reported for the synthesis of device quality perovskite materials, which include two-step spin-coating methods, vacuum flash-assisted solution processes (VASPs),28 vapor deposition,29,30 gas-induced methods,31,32etc. However, these methods necessitate costly equipment, and require high processing temperatures and times. One step solution-based room temperature synthesis methods have many merits over the above-mentioned synthesis methods such as easy synthesis, large scale deposition, shorter process times and no need of a high temperature. The present study is focused on a simple one-step solution processed synthesis method (without any solvent treatment) for device fabrication. We herein report the synthesis of highly stable and Pb-free bismuth iodide(III) (BiI3 or called BI), stoichiometric methylammonium bismuth iodide [(CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 or MA3Bi2I9 or called s-MBI] and non-stoichiometric methylammonium bismuth iodide [(CH3NH3)2BiI5 or MA2BiI5 or called Ns-MBI] perovskite thin films at room temperature by a single step solution process spin coating method for photodetector application. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Visible spectroscopy measurements show that BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI are highly stable under atmospheric conditions for four months. Finally, photodetectors based on the synthesized BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskites have been directly fabricated on FTO substrates. These photodetectors have highly stable photo-switching behaviour along with excellent photoresponsivity and detectivity, and thereby fast response and recovery times. Our work shows that Pb-free BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskites have great potential in the future for photodetector application.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of MAI crystals
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) crystals were synthesized by drop-wise addition of aqueous hydroiodic acid (HI, Alfa Aesar, 57%) into methylamine (CH3NH2, Sigma Aldrich, 40%) under ice-cold conditions and then stirred for 2 hours. Solvent from the resultant solution was removed using a rotary evaporator at 60 °C. Yellow-white crystals were obtained after complete evaporation of the solvent and then the remnants were washed several times using diethyl ether [(C2H5)2O]. Filtration of the precipitate and subsequent drying at 70 °C for 12 hours under vacuum yielded white MAI crystals.
2.2 Synthesis of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films
Pb-free perovskite BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films were prepared at room temperature by a single step solution process spin coating method. In the experiment, bismuth triiodide (BiI3, 99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and the as-synthesized methylammonium iodide (MAI) crystals were used as chemical precursors. All solutions were prepared by adding BiI3 and MAI in various proportions (molarity variation of MAI:BiI3) in DMF. For the synthesis of BI solution, 1 M BiI3 was added into 0.5 ml of DMF. Similarly, for the synthesis of s-MBI, a 3:2 M proportion of MAI:BiI3 was added into 0.5 ml of DMF and the Ns-MBI solution was obtained by adding 2:1 M proportions of MAI:BiI3 into 0.5 ml of DMF. The resultant solution was transferred for sonication till the solution became crystal clear. These perovskite solutions were deposited on glass substrates (corning glass # 7059) by the simple spin coating method (at 6000 rpm for 30 s). Spin deposited perovskite thin films were annealed at 90 °C on a hot plate for 10 min. Films were allowed to cool to room temperature and then taken for characterization.
2.3 Material characterization
X-ray diffraction was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance, Germany) having a CuKα line (λ = 1.54056 Å), with 2θ values ranging from 5° to 60° and a step of 0.1°. The optical band gap of the perovskite thin films was estimated from the absorbance spectra recorded using a JASCO, V-670 UV-Visible-NIR spectrophotometer in the range of 200–800 nm. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed using a HITACHI, S-4800, Japan, instrument with an operating voltage of 10 kV to observe the surface morphology of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films. Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia microscope Raman) in the range of 70–250 cm−1. The spectrometer has the backscattering geometry for detection of Raman spectra with a resolution of 1 cm−1. The excitation source was a 532 nm line of a helium–neon laser. The power of the Raman laser and its spot size were kept <5 mW and ∼1 μm, respectively, to avoid possible heating effects on the sample. The thickness of all the synthesized Bi-based perovskite films was determined by a profilometer (KLA-Tencor, P-16+) and it was found to be in the range of 500–600 nm.
2.4 Device fabrication and photo-response measurements
BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI photodetectors were fabricated on FTO coated glass substrates. Firstly, the FTO substrates were etched out from regions under the anode contact by using 30% hydrochloric acid (HCl) and zinc powder. The FTO substrates were then cleaned with ultrasonication in double distilled water (DDW), acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 15 min each. In a second step, an electron transport layer (ETL) of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) was deposited on the pre-cleaned FTO substrate by using RF-magnetron sputtering. In a third step, the active perovskite layer of BI, s-MBI or Ns-MBI was deposited on FTO/c-TiO2 by the spin coating method to form the FTO/c-TiO2/BI or s-MBI or Ns-MBI structure. The prepared structure was then annealed on a hot plate at 70° for 10 min. After that, for the top electrode contact, graphite paste was prepared by mixing graphite powder in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution and the same was deposited over the FTO/c-TiO2/BI or s-MBI or Ns-MBI structure to form the FTO/c-TiO2/BI or s-MBI or Ns-MBI/graphite structure. The complete device fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the complete device fabrication process used in the present study. 
All the opto-electronic measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2400 system source meter that was attached to a computer through a GPIB 488A interface. For white light illumination, a PEC-L01 portable solar simulator was used for measuring the photo-response of the fabricated FTO/c-TiO2/BI or s-MBI or Ns-MBI/graphite device. The photocurrent-time characteristic curves were measured under standard AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the opto-electronic measurement set-up used in the present study. The effective area of the photodetector was 0.25 cm2.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to confirm the formation and to analyse the structural properties of the synthesized bismuth iodide (BI), stoichiometric methylammonium bismuth iodide (s-MBI) and non-stoichiometric methylammonium bismuth iodide (Ns-MBI) thin films prepared by the spin coating method. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared BI and the same BI sample exposed to normal atmospheric conditions (relative humidity of 55–65% and temperature of 25–35 °C) for 4 months without any encapsulation.
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns of spin coated (a) BI, (b) s-MBI and (c) Ns-MBI perovskite thin films. 
The presence of multiple peaks in the XRD patterns indicates that all the films are polycrystalline in nature. The films show diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼ 12.78°, 14.22°, 25.72°, 26.97°, 39.09°, 41.56° and 52.94°, which correspond to the (003), (101), (006), (113), (009), (300) and (0012) diffraction planes, respectively. All diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hexagonal BiI3 phase with lattice parameters a = 0.7538 nm and c = 2.0805 nm, which are consistent with the values reported in the literature (JCPDS file # 07-0269)33 and the space group C23i.34 It is interesting to note that the XRD patterns recorded after 4 months exposure of BI films to normal atmospheric conditions did not show any significant change in the diffraction peak intensity and position. Furthermore, no additional diffraction peaks were observed even after exposure of BI films to humid air for 4 months. These results suggest that the BI thin films are environmentally stable. Fig. 3(b) and (c) shows the XRD patterns of s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films along with the XRD patterns of the same s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films recorded after 4 months exposure to normal atmospheric conditions again without any encapsulation. As can be seen, both films have diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼ 8.30°, 12.56°, 16.30°, 24.60°, 25.40°, 41.56° and 50.30° corresponding to the diffraction planes (002), (101), (004) (006), (202), (208) and (308), respectively. These diffraction peaks match well with the theoretically calculated and experimentally observed XRD patterns of MBI published earlier,35 although there are ambiguities regarding the crystal structure of MBI. For example, Jakubas and Sobczyk36 and Park et al.37 reported that MBI has a hexagonal crystalline structure with P63/mmc as the space group, whereas Szklarz et al.38 reported that MBI has an orthorhombic structure with Cmcm (63) as the space group. The XRD peaks of the MBI perovskite thin films obtained in this study are similar to the results reported by Jakubas and Sobczyk36 and Park et al.,37 suggesting that the MBI perovskite has a hexagonal crystalline phase with P63/mmc as the space group. Thus, the calculated lattice parameters are found to be a = 0.8612 nm, b = 0.8531 nm and c = 2.1971 nm. These lattice parameters match well with the DFT calculated lattice parameters reported by Chen et al.39 and experimentally verified reported values reported by Kamminga et al.40 No change in diffraction peak intensity and position was observed in the XRD patterns recorded after 4 months exposure of both s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films to the normal atmosphere, suggesting that the synthesized films are environmentally stable. On the other hand, the X-ray diffraction intensity of the non-encapsulated organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was found to decrease even with exposure to humid air for 5 min and it almost vanished when the exposure duration was 30 min.41
The formation of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films in the range of 75–250 cm−1 prepared by the spin coating method.
 Fig. 4  Raman spectra of spin coated BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite thin films. 
As can be seen, the Raman spectrum of the BI film shows a strong active shoulder at ∼112 cm−1 and two weaker peaks at ∼85 cm−1 and ∼ 151 cm−1. These peaks match well with previously reported Raman spectrum peaks of BI in the literature.34,42 The line at 154 cm−1 may be assigned to the 2nd order Raman line, which is only observed in bulk materials at lower temperature43 or may be a new vibrational mode. The Raman spectra for s-MBI and Ns-MBI show strong Raman active peaks at ∼108 cm−1 and ∼145 cm−1, respectively, which are characteristic bands observed for MBI perovskite films.35 The density functional theory (DFT) calculated vibrational modes reported by Öz et al.35 at ∼23, 35, 47 and 59 cm−1 and the Bi–I–Bi scissoring modes at ∼73 cm−1 and ∼87 cm−1 were not observed in the Raman spectra of these films. A possible reason for this may be coupling to the Bi–I stretch mode (108 cm−1). The Bi–I stretching vibrations are observed at 108 cm−1 and 145 cm−1, which are reproduced well in the recorded Raman spectrum. Our results are also in good agreement with those of similar compounds containing (Bi2I9)3−.44 Thus, Raman spectroscopy analysis further confirmed the formation of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films synthesized using the spin coating method.
3.2 Morphological properties
The surface morphology of the spin coated Bi-based perovskites was analysed using the FE-SEM technique. Fig. 5 shows the FE-SEM micrographs of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films. The insets show the corresponding magnified FE-SEM images. As can be seen from Fig. 5(a), the BI film shows a dense and uniform distribution of micron size crystals having a chain like structure, which covers the entire substrate area.
 Fig. 5  FE-SEM micrographs of (a) BI, (b) s-MBI and (c) Ns-MBI perovskite thin films deposited by the spin coating method. The insets show the corresponding magnified images. 
The morphology of the s-MBI films shows hexagon-shaped MBI crystals with smooth curvatures at every corner. Micron sized MBI hexagons are vertically and horizontally aligned with the micron size void space [Fig. 5(b)]. These voids can be removed by chemical engineering such as solvent treatment.45Fig. 5(c) depicts the FE-SEM micrographs of the Ns-MBI thin films. As can be seen, the Ns-MBI film comprises hexagon-shaped crystals with a porous part at the centre of the hexagons. These hexagons are aligned horizontally over the entire substrate surface with micro-voids present in between them. The origin of the formation of micro-voids in the film is not clear, however we think that evaporation of solvent during the film formation may have created the voids. These voids may hamper the energy conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
3.3 Optical properties analysis
Optical properties such as optical absorption and band gap of the as synthesized BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films were evaluated using UV-Visible spectroscopy. Fig. 6 shows the optical absorption of the as deposited BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films and each inset of Fig. 6 shows the corresponding typical Tauc plot, used for band gap estimation.
 Fig. 6  UV-Visible absorption spectra of spin coated (a) BI, (b) s-MBI and (c) Ns-MBI perovskite thin films. Inset in each figure shows the typical Tauc plot used to estimate the band gap of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films, respectively. 
In a direct transition semiconductor, the optical energy band gap (Eopt) and the optical absorption coefficient (α) are related by46 (αE)1/2 = B1/2(E − Eopt)(1)where α is the absorption coefficient, B is the optical density of states and E is the photon energy. The absorption coefficient (α) can be calculated from the transmittance of the films with the formula (2)where d is the thickness of the films and T is the transmittance. Therefore, the optical band gap is obtained by extrapolating the tangential line to the photon energy (E = hν) axis in the plot of (αhν)1/2 as a function of hν (Tauc plot).

Fig. 6(a) shows that absorption of BI starts from ∼710 nm and has a broad absorption spectrum up to ∼220 nm with the highest value of absorption coefficient of ∼104 cm−1. The inset of Fig. 6(a) shows the typical Tauc plot for BI having a band gap of 1.74 eV, which matches with the literature values.34,35Fig. 6(b) shows the absorption of s-MBI, which starts from ∼660 nm and has a broad absorption spectrum up to ∼220 nm with the highest value of absorption coefficient of ∼103 cm−1. The inset of Fig. 6(b) shows the typical Tauc plot for s-MBI with an indirect band gap of ∼1.8 eV.47,48 Moving from stoichiometric MBI to non-stoichiometric MBI, the optical properties vary a little bit. The optical absorption and optical band gap of Ns-MBI are shown in Fig. 6(c). With an increase in concentration of MAI in MBI (i.e., Ns-MBI), the absorption edge shifts towards lower wavelength. For the Ns-MBI thin film, the optical absorption starts from ∼620 nm and has a broad absorption spectrum up to ∼220 nm with the highest value of absorption coefficient of ∼103 cm−1. The inset of Fig. 6(c) shows the typical Tauc plot for Ns-MBI having an indirect band gap of ∼2 eV. We have also recorded the optical absorption spectra and calculated the optical band gap of all three BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films after four months from the date of synthesis. All the synthesized samples even after 4 months exhibited similar optical properties, such as absorption and band gap values. These results further confirm the environmental stability of the Bi-based perovskites.
3.4 Photodetector properties
A photodetector is a light sensor that can convert incident radiation into electrical signal. The working mechanism of a photodetector is well known and many reviews have explained its basic principle in detail.49–51 In a photodetector, absorbed photon energy is utilized for the generation of electron hole pairs called excitons. The stability and recyclability of a photodetector under light illumination are critical for its long-term operation. Thus, time-resolved photo-response measurement has been conducted under alternating dark and white light illumination (100 mW cm−2) at zero bias voltage. Fig. 7(a1)–(c1) present the time-resolved photo-response [(I–t) curves] of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite photodetectors. Almost no deterioration of photocurrent is observed, revealing that the photo-response of all the fabricated BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI devices is stable and repeatable. Furthermore, a sharp rise and decay of photocurrent are observed when the solar simulator is turned ON and OFF immediately, signifying the fast response and recovery characteristic of the BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite-based photodetectors under white light illumination. As can be seen from the XRD and FE-SEM analysis (Fig. 3 and 5), the synthesized BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI materials are highly crystallized. As a result, the photo-induced free carriers recombine very fast instead of slowly recombining with the trapped carriers. This gives the fast photo-response characteristics. Such a fast photo-response has been reported by Luo et al.52 for InSe-based photodetectors and Cao et al.53 for GaSe photodetectors. In order to evaluate the response and recovery time, the enlarged view of a single ON–OFF cycle of each photodetector needs to be considered.
 Fig. 7  Time-resolved photo-response characteristics of (a1) BI, (b1) s-MBI and (c1) Ns-MBI perovskite thin film photodetectors under alternating dark and illumination conditions and (a2), (b2) and (c2) show the single cycle photo-response of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite photodetectors, respectively, for estimation of the response and recovery time. 

Fig. 7(a2)–(c2) show the dynamic response and recovery data for one cycle of the BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite-based photodetectors, respectively. The time taken by the photodetector to reach 90% of the maximum photocurrent value from its dark current value is called the response time (τRise) of that photodetector. In the same way, the time required for a photodetector to reach 10% of its maximum photocurrent response is called the decay time (τDecay) of that photodetector.54 The response and decay times of the BI photodetector are found to be 2 s and 1 s, respectively; for the s-MBI photodetector, they are 2 s and 2 s, respectively; and for the Ns-MBI photodetector, they are 3 s and 2 s, respectively.
The performance of a photodetector can be further characterized by various parameters such as photo responsivity, detectivity, photosensitivity, probable quantum efficiency, etc. The photo-responsivity (Rλ) of a photodetector is defined as the photo-excited current generated per unit power of incident light on the effective area of the photodetector and is given by the equation55 (3)where ΔI = Iphoto − Idark is the change in the photocurrent due to irradiation of light, Pλ is the intensity of incident photons (100 mW cm−2) and A is the area of the photodetector (0.25 cm2). The photoresponsivity of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite-based photodetectors was found to be ∼0.5 mA W−1, 0.1 mA W−1 and 0.2 mA W−1, respectively.
The photosensitivity (ξ) of a photodetector is defined as the ratio between the difference in photo current (Iphoto) and dark current (IDark) values to the dark current and is expressed as56 (4)The estimated value of photosensitivity of the BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite-based photodetectors was found to be 114, 118, and 75, respectively.
To evaluate the efficiency of the electron transport and carrier collection, we have estimated the probable internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the photodetector using the following equation,57 (5)where h is Plank's constant, c is the velocity of light, e is the charge of the electron, λ is wavelength of the incident radiation and Rλ represents the photoresponsivity. The values of quantum efficiency of BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite-based photodetectors were found to be 124 × 10−3%, 20 × 10−3% and 41 × 10−3%, respectively.
Similarly, detectivity (D*) is an important parameter of photodetectors, which gives a measure of the quality of a device. It is measured in the unit of Jones and is given by58 (6)where Rλ is the photoresponsivity, JDark is the dark current density and e is electron charge. We have observed average values of detectivity for BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite photodetectors of ∼1.30 × 107 Jones, ∼0.61 × 107 Jones and ∼0.70 × 107 Jones, respectively. A comparative analysis of BI-, s-MBI- and Ns-MBI-based photodetectors with reference to their response and decay time, responsivity, detectivity, photosensitivity, probable quantum efficiency, etc. is shown in Table 1.

4. Conclusions
We have synthesized highly stable, Pb-free BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskite thin films at room temperature by a single step solution process spin coating method for photodetector application. The structural, optical, and morphological properties of these films were investigated using different characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM, UV-Visible spectroscopy, etc. The formation of the BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI thin films was confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy results. The XRD and UV-Visible spectroscopy measurements showed that BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI are highly stable under atmospheric conditions for four months. XRD analysis showed that BI has a hexagonal crystal structure and a P63/mmc hexagonal space group for s-MBI and Ns-MBI. UV-Visible spectroscopy analysis showed that the BI film has a high absorption coefficient of ∼104 cm−1 and band gap of ∼1.74 eV. Similarly, s-MBI also has a high absorption coefficient (∼103 cm−1) and an indirect band gap of ∼1.8 eV. Moving from s-MBI to Ns-MBI, the value of absorption coefficient becomes 103 cm−1 and the band gap becomes ∼2 eV. Finally, photodetectors based on the synthesized BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskites have been directly fabricated on FTO substrates. All photodetectors showed highly stable photo-switching behaviour along with excellent photoresponsivity and detectivity, and fast response and recovery times. The present results demonstrate the great potential of highly stable and low-toxic BI, s-MBI and Ns-MBI perovskites for future opto-electronic applications.
