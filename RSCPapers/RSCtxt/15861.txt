    , Accepted 25th July 2018First published on 27th July 2018AbstractThe effects of fused-ring regiochemistry on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors are investigated. Two n-OS isomers TPTC and TPTIC were prepared with different oxygen positions in the central fused-ring unit of the acceptor molecules: oxygen is connected with benzene in TPTC and it is connected with two thiophenes in TPTIC. It is found that TPTC tends to cause excessive self-aggregation with several different packing motifs or polymorphs, while TPTIC with compact alkyl chains forms well-defined crystals. The electron mobility of TPTC, which is measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, is much lower than that of TPTIC. When blending these acceptors with the polymer PTQ10, excessive self-aggregation of TPTC leads to large phase separation and exhibits little change after thermal annealing treatment, while the intermolecular interaction in TPTIC is appropriate to achieve suitable phase separation in its blend films with PTQ10, and the stacking of both crystallites was obviously improved after thermal annealing. Thus the PSCs with TPTIC as the acceptor show a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.42%, in comparison with that (1.97%) of the device with TPTC as the acceptor. These results indicate that the regiochemistry of the n-OS acceptors greatly influences the aggregation behavior of the molecules, which strongly affects the performance of the PSCs, and the structure–property relationship of the materials with the regiochemistry could guide the development of high performance n-OS acceptors.
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn considerable attention as an emerging energy conversion technology, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have reached over 14%.1–4 This progress has greatly benefitted from the development of low bandgap acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-structured n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors5–12 and the structure optimization of polymer donors which are absorption-complementary and energy level matching with the acceptors.13–19 In the A–D–A type n-OS acceptors, fused-ring aromatic building blocks were widely used as the central donor unit.20–27 Such fused rings feature high thermal, chemical and mechanical stabilities. Furthermore, their planar rigid backbone strengthens π-orbital interactions, elongates the effective conjugation length and facilitates π-electron delocalization. Moreover, these coplanar structures effectively suppress the rotation of adjacent rings to lower reorganization energy, which is beneficial to enhance the intrinsic charge mobility.26,28,29 Owing to the superior inherent structural characteristics, the fused-ring-based molecules (such as IDT or IDTT-based small molecules) are state-of-the-art n-OS acceptors and widely used in high-efficiency PSCs. However, for these fused-ring-based molecules, the good planarity and large conjugation length can also lead to excessive self-aggregation and large phase separation. In order to obtain desirable n-OS acceptors that can match with donors to achieve favorable morphology, flexible side chains should be introduced to improve their solubility and to tune the morphology of their blend films with the polymer donor for obtaining good photovoltaic performance.
Side-chain engineering is one of the commonly used strategies to tune solubility, aggregation behavior and intermolecular interactions of the donor and acceptor materials for improving their photovoltaic performance.19,30–32 Nowadays, most of the related studies focus on optimizing side-chain lengths, geometry, or introducing alkyloxy or conjugated side chains,30,33–35 while the effects of side chain regiochemistry have not yet been systematically studied for the fused-ring n-OS acceptors.36 The fused-ring regiochemistry of the n-OS acceptors could provide new knowledge on the structure–property relationship for further improving the photovoltaic performance of the n-OS acceptors.
In this work, we synthesized two fused-ring n-OS isomers TPTC and TPTIC with different oxygen positions in the fused-ring central donor units of the acceptors.29,37,38 Oxygens of the crosslinked alkoxy side chains are connected with benzene in TPTC and they are connected with two thiophenes in TPTIC. Meanwhile, the side chains of these two molecules are located in different regions on the central donor unit along with different positions of oxygen atoms in the structure. Then the effects of the different regiochemistry on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of the acceptors were studied systematically. It was found that TPTIC shows more appropriate aggregation behavior and high electron mobility than TPTC. Photovoltaic properties of the two acceptors demonstrated a big difference with the PCE values of 1.97% and 10.42% for the PTQ10-based PSCs with TPTC and TPTIC as acceptors, respectively. The results indicate that regiochemistry is another important strategy to regulate the aggregation and photovoltaic properties of the n-OS acceptors.
Synthetic routes of the isomers TPTC and TPTIC are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† Compound 1 and compound 2 were synthesized according to the literature.39 Intermediate 3 was prepared by Suzuki reaction of 1 and 2 using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst at rt and the crude product was purified directly by washing with methanol. Then product 3 was dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 and then reacted with BBr3. After being stirred at rt for 12 h, water was added and the precipitate was filtered. After being dried, the precipitated compound 4 was dissolved in dry THF and reacted with n-octylmagnesium bromide. The crude product without further purification was dissolved in toluene and reacted with p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate giving product 5 in high yields. Then the intermediate 6 was prepared by Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of 5 with POCl3 in DMF. Subsequently, target molecules TPTC and TPTIC were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of 6 with 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) in high yield (85% for TPTC and 89% for TPTIC) as dark blue solids. All the compounds were fully characterized by conventional NMR and mass spectroscopy. The thermogravimetric analysis indicates that TPTC and TPTIC are thermally stable at up to 328 and 317 °C, respectively (5 wt% loss, Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

In order to reveal the essential difference between the two molecules in the stereoscopic structure, DFT calculation is carried out at the B3LYP/6-31 G (d, p) level using the Gaussian 09 package to evaluate the optimal geometric configurations for TPTC and TPTIC, as shown in Fig. 1. Clearly, both TPTC and TPTIC present nearly flat conformations. The difference between these two molecules is mainly in the geometric configuration, especially in the spatial position of the alkyl chain. TPTC exhibits a relatively longer distance of 7.58 Å while TPTIC has a shorter distance of 5.92 Å between the two side chains (Fig. 1a and b). The different molecular geometries of the two n-OS acceptors could influence their aggregation behavior and photovoltaic performance. In ITIC derivatives, the electron-rich central unit is not involved in π–π interactions due to the steric hindrance of the side groups. It is the electron deficient end units that cause π–π interactions with the polymer donors or the adjacent acceptor molecules in their blend films, which facilitates electron transfer and transport.40,41 As for TPTC and TPTIC, the more compact alkyl chains of TPTIC lead to the suppression of π–π stacking between their electron-rich cores, as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† However, the relatively small steric hindrance of the side chains in TPTC results in more complicated π–π stacking and more diversified aggregation modes, as shown in Fig. 1c and S3 in the ESI,† which may result in a complicated aggregation morphology that is detrimental to the electron separation and transportation.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two isomers in solution and films (without thermal annealing) are shown in Fig. 2a. For TPTC and TPTIC, the absorption spectral ranges are similar in solution (from 550 nm to 800 nm) with maximum extinction coefficients of 1.1 × 105 and 1.5 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 699 and 703 nm, respectively. In addition, TPTIC shows an obvious shoulder peak, indicating its stronger aggregation than TPTC in solution. The film absorption spectra of the molecules are significantly red-shifted in comparison with their solutions, and the maximum absorption of TPTC and TPTIC films were red-shifted from 698 to 750 nm and from 703 to 765 nm, respectively, which indicates that more ordered aggregation and stronger π–π stacking interactions exist in the films of the molecules. The difference between the absorption spectra of TPTC and TPTIC in the range of 400–500 nm may be due to the difference in the position of oxygen atoms. The optical band gaps of TPTC and TPTIC films are 1.52 and 1.49 eV, respectively, estimated from their absorption edge (818 nm for TPTC and 835 nm for TPTIC).

In order to further investigate the effect of side chain regiochemistry on the properties of the isomers, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the two isomers films before and after thermal annealing (at 120 °C for 5 min) were compared, as shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† It can be seen that the thermal annealing treatment exhibits different effects on TPTC and TPTIC. The absorption peak of the TPTC film has no obvious change before and after the thermal annealing, which indicates that there is no aggregation change in the TPTC film with the thermal annealing. Interestingly, the absorption spectrum of the TPTIC film shows a broadened absorption band with a new vibrational peak and ca. 10 nm red shift after the thermal annealing (see Fig. S4b†), which suggests that there is further ordered aggregation of TPTIC during the thermal annealing. The new vibrational peak could be ascribed to the enhanced π–π interaction in the ordered aggregation of TPTIC after the thermal annealing. This phenomenon is probably due to the different packing modes of the two molecules, which will be discussed later.
The electronic energy levels of TPTC and TPTIC were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. 2b. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the two molecules were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials obtained from their cyclic voltammograms, according to the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.36) (eV). (Redox potential of Fc/Fc+ is 0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl in our measurement system, and we take the energy level of Fc/Fc+ as 4.8 eV below vacuum.) TPTC has an up-shifted LUMO (−3.83 eV) energy level and a down-shifted HOMO (−5.85 eV) compared to those (−3.89 eV/−5.67 eV) of TPTIC (see Table 1), which could be ascribed to the position effects of oxygen atoms in the isomers.

Molecular packing of pure films of the two isomers was investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Fig. 3, GIWAXS plots indicate that both TPTC and TPTIC exhibit highly ordered molecular packing with sharp peaks and strong peak intensities. A neat TPTC film tends to form edge-on oriented crystallites with the (100) peak at ∼0.4 Å−1, (200) peak at ∼0.8 Å−1 and (300) peak at ∼1.2 Å−1 in the OOP direction. And the TPTIC film also tends to form edge-on oriented crystallites with the (100) peak at 0.362 Å−1 and (200) peak at 0.737 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. Owing to the different positions of the side chains relative to the fused rings, the 2D GIWAXS patterns of TPTC and TPTIC exhibit a significant difference. For TPTC, more than one set of (h00) scattering peaks is observed in Fig. 2c, suggesting that TPTC may adopt several different packing motifs or polymorphs. The results of GIWAXS indicate that such a small change in the side chains has a significant influence on the aggregation and molecular ordering in the neat films of the isomers, which could affect the photovoltaic performance of the n-OS acceptors.

For further investigating the difference in aggregation between the two isomers, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. In the first heating of the DSC measurement, the two isomers both display an obvious melting peak, revealing that there are crystallite structures in the two films prepared by dropcasting from their solutions. TPTC shows a higher melting temperature (289.5 °C) and melting enthalpy (49.23 J g−1) than that of TPTIC (276.3 °C and 38.00 J g−1), indicating that more energy is needed for the TPTC film to break the crystallite structure. This might also contribute to the different responses to thermal annealing of the two molecules. The TPTIC formed well-defined crystals and this can be further promoted by the thermal annealing, while TPTC forms a vast amount of compact crystals (Fig. 6), and the packing is hard to break, and thus no further growth of crystals is observed during thermal annealing. Besides, it is interesting to note that, during the 2nd heating, there is no melting peak for TPTIC, while TPTC still shows some peaks. This indicates that the crystallization is highly suppressed when cooled at 10 °C min−1 from the melt and the crystallization is facilitated by the initial presence of the solvent. Collectively, the data above suggest different crystallization behaviors of the two isomers, which is consistent with what is observed in the GIWAXS measurement.
In order to compare the difference in the charge transport properties of the isomers, electron mobilities of the two isomers were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with an electron only device of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al. Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the results. The calculated electron mobility of TPTIC is 1.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that (0.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) for TPTC.
All these results of optical properties, electronic energy levels, crystallinity and electron mobilities show that the regiochemistry of the fused-ring central unit can have significant impacts on the properties of the n-OS isomers. In order to further investigate the influences of the regiochemistry on the photovoltaic performance of the isomers, the PSCs with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTQ10:acceptors (TPTC or TPTIC)/PDINO/Al were fabricated, in which a medium bandgap conjugated polymer PTQ10 was used as the electron donor,17 PEDOT:PSS and PDINO served as the anode and cathode electrode buffer layers, respectively. Device fabrication details are described in the ESI.† The donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio in the active layer of the devices was optimized to be 1:1.5. Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs, and Table 2 lists the photovoltaic performance parameters of the devices for a clear comparison. The PSC based on PTQ10:TPTC without thermal annealing showed a very low PCE of 1.36%, even after the annealing treatment, the PCE of the TPTC-based PSC is improved only a little to 1.97%, due to its lower Jsc and FF, while under the same processing conditions and the same PTQ10 batch, the as-cast device based on PTQ10:TPTIC delivered a PCE of 3.83% with a Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 10.38 mA cm−2, and FF of 38.79%. After optimization with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 5 min, the TPTIC-based PSCs demonstrated a PCE of 10.42% with a Voc of 0.90 V, Jsc of 17.17 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.45%. The big difference of the photovoltaic performance of the two isomer acceptors could be due to their different aggregation behaviors in the blend active layers of the PSCs.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the influence of the regiochemistry on the device performance, we conducted GIWAXS42 measurements on the blend films, from which the detailed morphology information such as the molecular packing and orientation in the blend films can be extracted. In the GIWAXS pattern of the PTQ10:TPTC blend film (Fig. 5a), the π–π stacking peak is shown in both IP and OOP directions, suggesting that there are both face-on and edge-on crystallites. Furthermore, in the TPTC-based film, PTQ10 and TPTC still maintain their independent and unchanged crystallinity, exhibiting two polymorphs similar to those observed in the pure films. After thermal annealing, there is little change in the aggregation behavior of the PTQ10:TPTC blend films, the π–π stacking distance and OOP coherence length didn't change much, while the TPTIC crystallites of its blend films show a face-on orientation with the (100) peak at 0.408 A−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction compared to the edge-on orientation with the (100) peak at 0.362 Å−1 in the neat film. The (100) peak of PTQ10 moves to 0.288 A−1 from 0.271 A−1 in the neat PTQ10 film, and the (100) peak of TPTIC moves to 0.408 A−1 from 0.362 A−1 in the neat TPTIC film, which suggests a closer packing in both PTQ10 and TPTIC crystallites in the blend films. In addition, after thermal annealing, significantly stronger and sharper peaks, especially the π–π stacking peak, are observed in the PTQ10:TPTIC film. Although the π–π stacking distance remains unchanged, it exhibits a higher OOP coherence length (from 38.7 to 54.6 Å), which is beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction. Meanwhile, the RSoXS results (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) indicate that the purity of the domains is higher in the as-cast samples of these two blend films than that in the thermally annealed samples, and the highly pure domains may result in more trapped charges and slightly lower Jsc and FF43 values. The origins of the difference between the PTQ10:TPTC and PTQ10:TPTIC blend films could be due to the different interactions of these two isomer acceptors with the PTQ10 donor leading to stronger vitrification or attributed to the intrinsic aggregation properties of the two acceptors.

Optical microscopy was used to obtain the morphological images of the blend films of PTQ10:TPTC or TPTIC and the neat films of TPTC, TPTIC (Fig. 6). In Fig. 6a, the blend film of PTQ10 with TPTC exhibits obviously crystalline particles; however, the film based on TPTIC shows a smooth surface (Fig. 6b). A large number of compact crystals were also observed in the neat film of TPTC (Fig. 6c). These results indicate that the large crystal of the TPTC-based blend film is due to the intrinsic aggregation properties of the acceptor, rather than the different interactions between donor and acceptor components, which determine the large phase separation of the neat and blend films. The surface and bulk morphology of PTQ10:TPTC or TPTIC blend films were also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† the film based on TPTIC exhibits a uniform and smooth surface, the corresponding TEM images exhibit finely dispersed phase separation. However, for the TPTC-based blend films, strong aggregation was observed in AFM, and TEM results show that the TPTC tends to cause large phase separation. With these results, it is likely that the PTQ10:TPTC blend suffered from excessively large phase separation, which results in its poor Jsc and lower IPCE, as a large portion of excitons generated in the PTQ10:TPTC blend cannot diffuse to the interfaces for charge separation but will recombine to ground states.44 In summary, the morphological results indicate that the intermolecular interaction in TPTIC is appropriate to achieve suitable nano-scale phase separation in its blend films with the PTQ10 donor, while the larger aggregates of TPTC inhibited the mixing and induced large phase separation with PTQ10, so that serious phase separation existed in the active layer of the TPTC-based PSCs. It is the different morphologies of the acceptor isomers that influenced their photovoltaic performance.

In conclusion, the effects of the fused-ring regiochemistry on the physicochemical and photovoltaic performance of the two n-OS acceptor isomers are investigated. The different positions of oxygen and side chains on the fused-ring central units have a significant impact on the steric hindrance, intermolecular interactions and aggregation behavior of the acceptors, thus resulting in a significant effect on the active layer morphology, and their absorption spectra, electron mobility and photovoltaic performance. TPTIC possesses higher electron mobility and forms appropriate aggregates in its blend films with the PTQ10 donor, especially after thermal annealing, while TPTC has lower electron mobility and excessive phase separation in its blend films with PTQ10. As a result, the PSCs based on TPTIC yielded a high PCE of up to 10.42%, while the PCE of the TPTC-based PSCs was only 1.97%. These results indicate that the regiochemistry of the fused-ring central units greatly influences the photovoltaic performance of n-OS acceptors, and the structure–property relationship could guide the development of n-OS acceptors for high performance PSCs.
