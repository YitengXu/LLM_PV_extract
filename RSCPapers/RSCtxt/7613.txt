    , Accepted 18th April 2019First published on 19th April 2019AbstractDriven by the increasing global energy demand, the development of innovative energy conversion and storage systems is becoming more and more urgent. As one of the attractive means, water splitting has attracted widespread attention because of its great potential in storing electricity in the form of chemical fuel which also makes it a promising solution to the utilization of non-grid electricity generated by solar or wind. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is generally deemed as the key rate-limiting step of water splitting, and thus studying efficient OER electrocatalysts with a low overpotential and good stability is of vital importance. Here, we successfully prepared an OER catalyst with excellent electrochemical performance through a simple anion doping. Firstly, a stable cubic perovskite SrCoO3−δ was prepared by anion F-doping instead of traditional A and/or B site doping. Secondly, SrCoO2.85−δF0.15 demonstrates excellent OER activity superior to its parent hexagonal compound H-Sr2Co2O5 and those perovskites prepared via complicated A- and/or B-site doping. DFT calculations and XPS investigations reveal that the cubic structure and the highly oxidative oxygen species (O22−/O−) via F− doping jointly contribute to the better OER properties of SrCoO2.85−δF0.15. Our work brings forth a promising strategy to stabilize cubic structures from hexagonal ones via a simple anion doping strategy, which may open a new avenue for the development of even more effective OER catalysts and may be applied in many other fields related to structure transformation, in addition to energy and catalysis fields.
Introduction
The development of multifarious late-model energy conversion and storage systems is becoming more and more momentous on account of the increasing global energy crisis.1–3 One of the attractive means is the electrocatalytic splitting of water (2H2O = 2H2 + O2), which stores electricity in the form of chemical fuel by utilizing intermittent power sources, such as solar energy and wind energy.4 Among the potential electrochemical processes for water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), 4OH− = O2 + 2H2O + 4e−, is regarded as the key rate limiting step which involves a four-electron transfer reaction and requires a high overpotential to complete the reaction2 (1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE, at standard temperature and pressure). As a result, extensive research has been devoted to the study of efficient electrocatalysts with a low overpotential and good stability in OER catalysis. Up to now, noble metal nanoparticles and their oxides, including iridium oxide (IrO2) and ruthenium oxide (RuO2), are the top-performing electrocatalysts for the OER.5,6 But the scarcity, high cost, and practical performance decay restrict their widespread application on a commercial scale.1 Accordingly, numerous research groups are urgently developing alternative catalysts composed of much more abundant transition metals, such as transition metal oxides,6–10 chalcogenides,11,12 molecular compounds13,14 and so on.15,16
Perovskite oxides, with a chemical formula of ABO3 where A is typically a rare-earth or alkaline earth element and B is commonly a 3d transition metal, have been widely used as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).17,18 Recently, researchers found that perovskite oxides also exhibit remarkable OER activity in alkaline solutions which is comparable to that of precious metal based catalysts such as iridium and ruthenium. By density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Federico Calle-Vallejo et al. and Y. Matsumoto et al. demonstrated that the SrCoO3 parent oxide would deliver the highest OER activity among SrMO3 and LaMO3 (M = transition metals) parent oxides.19,20 Nevertheless, this theory has not yet been proved experimentally since it has been very difficult to prepare an ideal SrCoO3 perovskite cubic structure instead of incompletely oxidized SrCoO3−δ, H-Sr2Co2O5 (H refers to the hexagonal phase structure) which is the most common phase, containing face sharing of CoO6 octahedra (Fig. 1), similar to that of the 2H type BaNiO3 structure.21 Fortunately, substitution or partial substitution of the A site and/or B site by other elements was proved to be effective in supporting the cubic structure for SrCoO3−δ, which accordingly affected the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity compared to the parent hexagonal-type compound.22 Suntivich and co-workers reported that Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) theoretically should have the best performance among all studied oxides from molecular orbit principles and even better than the noted electrocatalysts RuO2 and IrO2.23 Nevertheless, BSCF is not stable and tends to become amorphous as the OER proceeds.24 Following this, several other SrCoO3−δ based perovskite oxides have also been studied, such as La0.2Sr0.8CoO3−δ,25 La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ,26 La0.3(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.7Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ,27 SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3−δ,28 and SrSc0.025Nb0.025Co0.95O3−δ,24 and they have shown good electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solution.

Recently, in addition to the A and/or B site of ABO3 perovskite doping, it has been reported that the partial occupation of nonoxide anions at the oxygen sites could give rise to many interesting properties.29,30 For example, Moon et al. successfully prepared a SrFeO3−αFγ thin film and found that anionic F− substitution could significantly affect the electronic structure and enables a new method to control the functional properties of complex oxide heterostructures.31 Zhu and co-workers stated that the oxygen permeability of the membranes at intermediate temperatures (400–500 °C) had been improved after the fluorine anions occupied the oxygen sites of BSCF and SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3−δ.32 Zhang et al.29 and Xie et al.17 demonstrated that the doping of F− into SrFeO3−δ and BSCF enabled a great improvement in their ORR performance and stability at intermediate temperatures. To date, however, the effect of anion-doped perovskites on OER performance has not been reported. Moreover, it is still unknown whether F− dopants can function effectively in transforming the hexagonal structure of oxides into a cubic one, since the base oxides of the existing F related oxides are all cubic ones (before F doping).
In this work, a stable cubic perovskite structure of SrCoO3−δ was successfully prepared by means of simple F-doping and applied as the OER catalyst for the first time. As shown in Fig. 1, the stacking arrangement of the close packed oxygen layers transforms from a purely hexagonal phase to a purely cubic phase by the fluorine doping, accompanying the change from face shared to corner shared CoO6 octahedra. We found that such anion doping contributes dramatically to the OER performance in alkaline solution. Compared with its parent hexagonal compound H-Sr2Co2O5 (SC), SrCoO2.85−δF0.15 (SCF0.15) showed much higher OER activity with 54 mV lower overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 and 6 times higher mass activity at 420 mV. Such an enhancement should be ascribed to the higher electrical conductivity and the larger number of O22−/O− species in the SCF0.15 catalyst. Importantly, the OER activity of the SCF0.15 catalyst is superior to that of the benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst including a smaller Tafel slope (60 mV dec−1), higher mass activity, and greater durability under OER cycling conditions. These results strongly suggest the prominent potential of SCF0.15 as an efficient, durable, and economical OER electrocatalyst and indicate the unique electrochemical improvement in catalysts induced by F-doping. This work illustrates that the strategy of modulating structures by anion doping will be a new avenue for the rational design of high-performance perovskite electrocatalysts.
Experimental
Materials preparation and synthesis
SrCoO2.85−δF0.15 (SCF0.15) powder was synthesized using a combustion method with citric acid and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the combustion agents. Sr(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and SrF2 were applied as the raw materials. For the preparation of SrCoO2.85−δF0.15, stoichiometric amounts of SrF2 were dissolved in distilled water first. Stoichiometric amounts of the nitrate precursors were subsequently added into the solution. Next, citric acid was added to the solution at a mole ratio of 1:1.5:1 for metal ions:citric acid:EDTA, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 7 by using ammonia water at last. The solution was magnetically stirred for 2 h and then heated on a hot plate until self-combustion occurred. The resulting ash was subsequently collected and heated at 1050 °C for 5 h to form the desired SCF0.15 powder (nominal composition). H-Sr2Co2O5 (SC), SrCoO2.9−δF0.1 (SCF0.1) and SrCoO2.75−δF0.25 (SCF0.25) powders were prepared using a similar combustion synthesis method. All chemicals here were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
Characterization
The phase structures of the obtained samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD, SmartLab, 9 kW). XRD patterns were recorded in the range of 20–80° with a step size of 0.02° and a scan speed of 10° min−1 at 40 kV and 200 mA. Crystalline parameters and the space group were obtained from the XRD data using the Rietveld refinement method. The powder morphologies were characterized using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (JEM-2010, 200 kV). The elemental distribution and surface element states were determined by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250 with Al-Kα radiation) method.
Electrode preparation and electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature using a three-electrode system on an electrochemical workstation (CHI instruments 760E China). A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode, and Pt foil and Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) were adopted as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a diameter of 3 mm was pre-polished with a 50 nm α-Al2O3 slurry on a polishing cloth. After ultrasonic cleaning in ethanol for 5 minutes, the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried before each test. The preparation method of the working electrodes based on SCF0.15 powder was as follows. Firstly, a mixture of SCF0.15 powders (10 mg) and carbon black (5 mg) was dispersed in 1 ml water-isopropanol solution (volume ratio of 3:1) and then 70 μl Nafion solution was added. Here, the function of carbon black was to improve the conductivity of electrocatalysts, and the electrocatalytic activity of carbon black was very small and could be ignored in the studied potential range. The mixture was sonicated for 1.5 h to generate a homogeneous electrocatalyst ink. And finally, 3 μl as-prepared catalyst ink was coated on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature, resulting in an approximate catalyst loading of 0.397 mg cm−2. 1 M KOH aqueous solution (99.99% metal purity, pH ∼13.8) was used as the electrolyte for the OER test. Prior to each electrochemical test, the electrolyte was saturated with O2 for 30 min roughly and kept under an O2 atmosphere throughout the whole electrochemical test. Before collecting linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve data, the working electrode was activated by cyclic voltammetry for 20 cycles in the range of 0–0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 from 0 to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) to obtain the polarization curves. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from 0 to 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, 3.5 M KCl) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for 1000 cycles to investigate the cycling stability. After the CV cycle test, LSV curves of the working electrodes were recorded again at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. To eliminate the impact of the solution resistance, all measured potential values were “E-iR” (i is the current and R is the electrolyte ohmic resistance measured by the impedance method in an O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte, and iR drop was compensated at 85% through positive feedback) corrected based on the formula E(RHE) = 0.197 + V (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH.
Results and discussion
Crystal phase structure and stability of SCF0.15
Perovskite oxides with a nominal composition of H-Sr2Co2O5, SrCoO2.85−δF0.15(SCF0.15) were prepared by the ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid–citric acid method. The room temperature X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 2a) show that without fluorine ion doping, the parent oxide H-Sr2Co2O5 (SC) presents a hexagonal structure as previously reported.21 With the incorporation of a small number of fluorine ions, the crystal-phase structure changes from a hexagonal to a cubic perovskite phase and no SrF2 phase was detected in SCF0.15. This suggests that F− has been successfully doped into the oxide as targeted. Although the SCF0.25 sample also reveals the cubic phase, it has some impurities as shown in the XRD results (Fig. S1b, ESI†). We just studied SCF0.1 and SCF0.15. Rietveld refinement further suggests that the as-prepared SCF0.15 sample has a cubic structure with lattice parameters of a = b = c = 3.808 Å and a space group of Pmm. Considering the values of Rp (3.37%), Rwp (5.21%) and χ2 (3.61) as shown in Fig. S1a,† the fitted parameters are very reliable. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns along the [100] zone axis shown in Fig. 2e further demonstrate the perovskite structure of the SCF0.15 sample, which can be well indexed in terms of a cubic unit cell, allowing the lattice planes to be identified. The results of refinement XRD and HRTEM confirm the cubic perovskite structure of the SCF0.15 sample with a lattice parameter ≈ 3.81 Å.

For the sake of further proving that F− has been successfully doped into the perovskite lattices, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of SCF0.15 and SC samples were comparatively employed. As shown in Fig. S1c,† strontium (Sr 3d at 133 eV), cobalt (Co 2p3/2 at 780 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 795 eV), and oxygen (O 1s at 531 eV) were detected in both SCF0.15 and SC samples. But from the amplified XPS survey data of the SCF0.15 sample (Fig. 2b), an additional weak peak at a binding energy of ≈685 eV was observed which should be assigned to the F 1s signal. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and homologous energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings (Fig. 2f) confirm the presence of Sr, Co, O and F in the SCF0.15 sample and the homogenous distribution of these elements, further verifying that F− has been incorporated successfully into the SCF0.15 lattice.
One of the core concerns for developing doped SrCoO3−δ-type materials could be that whether they could maintain phase stability at room temperature and in aqueous solution, the working conditions for the OER. Greatly, such instability mainly happens in the materials with high Ba, and Sr contents, which bring forth high basicity and prone to react as Lewis base with CO2 and H2O in air. As shown in Fig. 2c, the SCF0.15 sample was found to keep well its original cubic perovskite structure after six months' storage. It means that SCF0.15 has an excellent stability at room temperature. Moreover, after soaking the SCF0.15 powder in distilled water for 100 hours and then drying it at 80 °C for 10 hours, no peaks corresponding to any impurities were observed in the XRD pattern of such treated SCF0.15 samples, as shown in Fig. 2d, further proving the high stability of SCF0.15.
OER performance
The electrocatalytic performance of SCF0.15 in alkaline media (1 M KOH) was initially evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a typical three-electrode system at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 using a thin-film rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique25 (see details in the Experimental section). Similar measurements were performed on the benchmark IrO2 (Aladdin Industrial Corporation), SC, SCF0.1 and carbon black catalysts for direct comparison (the electrocatalytic performance results of SCF0.1 are shown in Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. 3a, the OER polarization curve of SCF0.15 shows a smaller onset potential of ≈1.51 V, slightly larger than that of IrO2 (1.47 V, similar to previous reports21,33) and much lower than that of SC catalysts (1.58 V). It is worth noting that the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (a reference to assess the efficiency of electrocatalysts34) of SCF0.15 is 380 mV, 54 mV lower than the SC catalyst in the 2H-hexagonal structure. Moreover, the current density of SCF0.15 at a large overpotential (e.g., η = 0.42 V) even surpasses that of benchmarked IrO2, which can be strongly reflected by its small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1 (millivolt per decade of electrical current density) (Fig. 3b). This implies that SCF0.15 has more favorable reaction kinetics. What calls for special attention is that the mass activity (current density/electrocatalyst loading), the vital indicator for commercial application, of SCF0.15 is almost 6 times that of the SC catalyst, and about 1.3 times that of the IrO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3c. This clearly demonstrates the much improved OER performance after the phase transition from the hexagonal structure to the cubic phase owing to the adulteration of fluorine atoms. Moreover, the electrocatalytic properties of SCF0.15 prepared by simple anion doping exceed those of many complicated A- and/or B-site doped perovskite materials, as shown in Table S2.† This strategy of changing phase structures by anion doping could provide a guidance for the design of high-activity perovskite electrocatalysts.

Fig. 3d shows the electrochemical impendence (EIS) spectra of those catalysts fitted using an equivalent circuit diagram consisting of the solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE) related to the electrochemical double capacitance. The semicircle diameter in the high frequency range of Nyquist plots (Fig. 3d) corresponds to the Rct value of the SCF0.15 catalyst (52 Ω) under OER conditions, which is much smaller than that of the SC catalyst (163 Ω). It highly indicates that SCF0.15 possesses a faster charger transfer and more facile kinetics for OER catalysis, which is essential for an efficient OER electrocatalyst.
One of the vital factors that determine the practicability of electrocatalysts is the long-term stability.2 To evaluate this, continuous potential cycling between 1.011 and 1.811 V (versus RHE, no iR correction) was performed for the SCF0.15 catalysts at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, with IrO2 as the reference, in O2-saturated 1 M KOH. What makes this pleasing, as shown in Fig. 3e, is that SCF0.15 samples still maintained good electrochemical properties after 1000 cycles. To further verify the long-term stability of SCF0.15, we carried out the amperometric i–t test for 20 hours. As shown in the illustration of Fig. 3e, SCF0.15 showed good stability during the test period. In contrast, for the reference benchmark IrO2 catalyst, a rapid degradation of OER activity is shown in Fig. 3f after 1000 cycles, similar to that reported previously,28 which may be ascribed to the oxidation of surface Ir4+ to soluble IrO42− anions under the OER test conditions.25 The distinct behavior of SCF0.15 and IrO2 catalysts in the potential cycling test strongly demonstrates the excellent stability of SCF0.15 under OER working conditions.
To conclude, although SCF0.15 processes a slightly higher OER onset potential compared to the IrO2 electrocatalyst, it is a promising alternative OER catalyst with superior activity and stability, and the F-doping strategy may open a new avenue to stabilize cubic perovskites from hexagonal phases to achieve good electrochemical performance.
Discussion
The electrochemical results indicate that the fluorine doping is favorable for the OER activity improvement. And the origins of this improvement is of concern to us. To better understand the fast OER kinetics of SCF0.15 and in particular the enhancement mechanism via F-doping, a computational analysis by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)35,36 has been carried out. For the DFT calculations, the detailed computational methods and choices of the slab models are described in the ESI.† The following four sequential electron reaction paths are considered in the OER process in alkaline solution:37 H2O (l) + * ⇌ HO* + H+ + e−(1) HO* ⇌ O* + H+ + e−(2) O* + H2O (l) ⇌ HOO* + H+ + e−(3) HOO* ⇌ O2 (g) + H+ + e− + *(4)Here, * indicates the active site on the surface of the catalyst which is available for adsorption and HO*, O*, and HOO* are adsorption intermediates. The calculations of free energies of each step are performed within the framework proposed by Nørskov et al.38 According to this approach, the chemical potential of H+/e− (0.5 H2) changes in the presence of an external bias U, and thus the free energy of the above four reactions can be calculated as:ΔG(U) = ΔE + (ΔZPE − TΔS) − eUwhere ΔE is the reaction energy, computed from the electronic energies of the reaction intermediates and the energies of the H2, O2 and H2O molecules, ΔZPE is the zero-point energy change and ΔS is the entropy change.37 The detailed calculation methods are described in the ESI.†
Since one of the main impacts of F− doping in SC is the crystal structure transformation from a hexagonal phase into a cubic one, the effect of crystal structures on the catalytic activity toward the OER should be the first to focus on. To simplify the calculation and to make better comparison with hexagonal Sr2Co2O5 (with no F−), we adopt a cubic SCO (001) surface with 4 oxygen vacancies to represent the cubic SCF0.15, as described in the ESI.†Fig. 4 shows that the standard free energy needed in each step of oxygen evolution reactions on the (001) cubic SCO surface and (0001) hexagonal SCO surface. Both structures show an endothermic reaction at the equilibrium potential U = 1.23 V with some uphill steps. When a potential greater than 1.23 V was applied, the four fundamental reaction steps become energetically downhill, indicating that the reactions can be greatly accelerated under such conditions. For the cubic perovskite structure, the rate-determining step occurred between O* → HOO* with the largest free energy variation of 1.94 V. This value is a little larger than that of the ideal cubic structure of SCO (1.53 V in Fig. S5,† very close to the reported value of 1.54 V (ref. 39)), which seems to suggest that the presence of surface vacancy is not energetically beneficial to the O* → HOO* process. Interestingly, the rate-determining step over the hexagonal structure is different from that of the cubic one and requires a much higher free energy of 3.17 V as demonstrated. This obviously manifests that the cubic structure achieved by F-doping possesses better OER activity, in good agreement with the experimental results.

As shown in eqn (1)–(4), to complete the OER processes, good electronic conductivity and high catalytic activity toward water dissociation are of key importance to a good OER electrocatalyst.40Fig. 5a shows the electrical conductivities of SCF0.15 and SC samples measured at room temperature by the four-probe direct current (DC) technique. The electrical conductivity of SCF0.15 (≈61 S cm−1) is almost eight times higher than that of SC (≈8 S cm−1), indicating a significant improvement in electrical conductivity via the F doping strategy, which is in line with a structure change from a 2H-polymorph with face sharing of CoO6 octahedra to a 3C-polymorph with corner sharing.21 In order to obtain insight into the effect of phase transition on the electrical conduction behavior, we performed first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT).41 The electronic density of states (DOS) of the cubic and hexagonal structures is shown in Fig. 5b and c, respectively, and the state densities near the Fermi level are illustrated in the inset. We can see that both structures exhibit metallic characteristics, but the state density around the Fermi energy level of the cubic structure is apparently larger than that of the hexagonal structure, which is more favourable for the electron conduction by lowering the activation energy of electron conductivity.41 This result corresponds well with our experimental observation (see Fig. 5a). The contribution of the electrical conductivity of pure materials (without carbon black) to the OER activity is specified in the ESI (Fig. S6†).

The second factor could be the presence of elements with specific oxidation states on the surface which are catalytically active.21 Researchers generally regard the transition metals and the oxygen-related species on the catalyst surface as the active sites to catalyze the OER.21,42 We performed an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test to get an insight into the surface chemical environment and bonding configuration of SCF0.15 and SC catalysts. Fig. 5e and f display the XPS spectra of Sr 3d and Co 2p, and no significant change was found in the surface Co and Sr oxidation state for SCF0.15 and SC samples. Therefore, the contribution from Sr and Co species towards the enhancement of the OER performance of SCF0.15 can be ruled out. As indicated in Fig. 5d, the O 1s spectrum can be fitted into four distinguishable peaks with binding energy (BE) from 528.6 eV to 532.8 eV. For typical perovskite oxides, the peak with the lowest BE (∼529.4 eV) can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen species (OL2−), that located at around 530.9 eV is assigned to the highly oxidative oxygen species (O22−/O−), that at ∼531.4 eV can be attributed to hydroxyl groups or the surface adsorbed oxygen (–OH/O2), and the last peak with the highest binding energy (532.8 eV) is formed due to molecular water or carbonate ions adsorbed on the surface (CO32−/H2O). The relative contents of these four surface oxygen species are estimated from the relative area of the fitted corresponding sub-peaks and summarized in Table S1.† As observed, the relative content of O22−/O− in the SCF0.15 surface is prominently higher than that in SCF0.1 and SC catalysts. The increased relative content of O22−/O− may be a result of the higher electronegativity of F− than O2−, which weakens the coulombic force between lattice oxygen (O2−) and B-site ions,29,43 and thus facilitates the formation of O22−/O− instead of lattice oxygen (O2−). Previous studies have reported that the highly oxidative oxygen species (O22−/O−) formed on the surface of metal oxide electrocatalysts are highly active for catalysing the OER in alkaline solution.40,44 Therefore, the higher relative content of (O22−/O−) in the SCF0.15 surface should be another key factor that contributes to the excellent OER activity of SCF0.15.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared, using a simple F− substitution strategy, a cubic perovskite oxide SCF0.15 and developed it as an efficient OER catalyst with remarkable activity and durability. The SCF0.15 perovskite displays far superior OER activity and a smaller Tafel slope (60 mV dec−1) than parent SC and the state-of-the-art precious metal IrO2 electrocatalysts. The conspicuous enhancement of the OER performance of the SCF0.15 catalyst may be attributed to the improvement of the electronic conductivity, on account of the structure change from a 2H- to a 3C-perovskite after F doping. Another factor may be the increased number of reactive oxygen species (O22−/O− species) which contributes to its enhanced OER activity in terms of onset OER potential and overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, SCF0.15 displayed a better stability than the noted IrO2 catalyst under the same OER cycling conditions. These advantages demonstrate the potential of the SCF0.15 perovskite as an efficient, durable and economical OER catalyst for use in energy storage and conversion applications. On the other hand, in addition to electrocatalysis, it will open up a promising avenue to the development of structure transformation and can be applied in many other fields.
