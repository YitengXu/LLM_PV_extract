    , Accepted 22nd August 2022First published on 23rd August 2022AbstractThe buried interface between a perovskite (PVK) light absorbing layer and an electron transport layer (ETL) plays an utmost important role in further improving the efficiency and stability of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The interfacial properties greatly affect charge transport, perovskite crystal growth, and device stability. Herein, a variable structure broad-spectrum UV-284 absorber agent 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid (HMBS) is introduced into PSCs based on SnO2 ETLs as an efficient multifunctional chemical linker to modify the buried interface properties. HMBS used to modify SnO2 can simultaneously suppress the surface trap states of ETLs, optimize the ETL/PVK interface energy level arrangement, and improve the crystallization quality of the upper perovskite films. Meanwhile, as an efficient UV absorber, HMBS can also greatly reduce the damage caused by UV light to perovskite films and thus improve the stability of devices. Consequently, HMBS-modified PSCs exhibit champion efficiencies of 23.42% (0.09cm2) and 20.63% (1.00 cm2) along with remarkably enhanced UV stability. This work emphasizes the importance of appropriate interface treatment strategies for buried interface modification and provides an effective method for fabricating efficient and UV resistant perovskite photovoltaic devices.
1 Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have aroused a research upsurge in the photovoltaic field because of their excellent photovoltaic characteristics and low-temperature processing technology.1,2 Especially, remarkable achievements have been made using tin oxide (SnO2)-based planar PSCs due to the optimization and improvement of the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) preparation process in the past few years.3–5 Compared to other transparent metal oxide semiconductor films such as TiO2 and ZnO, SnO2 has better energy level alignment matching with perovskite films, higher electron mobility, and excellent chemical stability.6 However, SnO2 films also have their shortcomings to be overcome. The most prominent disadvantage is the existence of inevitable hydroxyl groups on the surface of SnO2 films with residual alkalinity,7 which not only affect the structural stability of the upper perovskite film,8 but also impair carrier transport at the buried interface.9 Thus, it is essential to promote the surface of SnO2 films for building interfaces with excellent performance.
Besides the SnO2 ETLs of PSCs, the upper perovskite (PVK) layers and hole transport layers (HTLs) prepared by a solution method also have various defects on the surface. Thus, the contact interfaces of these functional layers largely determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs.10–12 For a PSC with an n–i–p structure, the accumulated defects at the buried interface below the perovskite light absorption layer have a more significant impact on the efficiency and stability, especially under UV irradiation, compared to the upper PVK/HTL interface.13,14 Therefore, many studies have been carried out to modify the ETL/PVK interface to passivate the defects on the surface of SnO2 and a perovskite and then suppress nonradiative recombination caused by the interface defects and energy level mismatch.15 For instance, Zheng et al. used cesium trifluoromethane sulfonate to reduce the commonly existing surface defects in perovskite films by removing excess iodine and chelating with uncoordinated Pb2+.16 Chen et al. used a sulfur salt to modify the buried ETL/PVK interface and found that it could interact with SnO2 and perovskite films and thus obviously improve the device performance.17 Cheng et al. passivated the ETL/PVK interface with potassium chlorobenzene sulfonate and effectively improved the carrier extraction efficiency.18 However, there are few reports on the use of interface modifiers with multi-functions to simultaneously suppress the surface defects and improve the UV resistance for PSCs.
In this work, we propose a simple and effective interface modification strategy, where a broad-spectrum UV absorber (UV-284) with the name of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid (HMBS) is employed to modify the interface of the SnO2 ETL and perovskite layer. The introduction of the HMBS modifier can simultaneously suppress the surface trap state of SnO2 and perovskite films, promote the carrier transport at the buried interface, improve the crystallization quality of the upper perovskite film, and reduce the damage caused by UV light to PSCs. These merits of the HMBS-modified PSCs eventually assisted in achieving champion efficiencies of 23.42% (0.09cm2) and 20.63% (1.00 cm2). Moreover, the unencapsulated HMBS-modified PSC also exhibited better storage stability and UV resistance than the controlled devices.
2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl), formamidinium iodide (FAI), and lead iodide (PbI2) were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. Spiro-OMeTAD, acetonitrile, and 4-tert-butylpyridine were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid (HMBS) was purchased from TCI. Commercial tin(IV) oxide solution (SnO2, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All salts and solvents were used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Perovskite solar cell fabrication
An FTO substrate was sequentially ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 30 min and subsequently dried with a nitrogen gun. The FTO substrate was treated with UV/O3 light for 60 minutes before depositing the SnO2 ETL. The SnO2 ETL was prepared by spin-coating the SnO2 nanocrystal solution (diluted with H2O to 2.5%) at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. The HMBS-modified layer was obtained by spin-coating the isopropanol solution containing HMBS on the SnO2 surface. FA0.47MA0.53PbI3 perovskite films were prepared by a typical two-step method.7 The PbI2 precursor was first prepared by dissolving 1.5 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO solution (9:1, v/v), then spin-coated on SnO2 or SnO2-HMBS substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s and then heated at 70 °C for 1 min. The mixed organic salt was prepared by dissolving 110 mg of FAI, 90 mg of MAI, and 10 mg of MACl in 5 mL of isopropanol. After it was fully dissolved, the mixed organic cation solution was spun on top of the PbI2 film at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The hole transporter, spiro-OMeTAD, was dissolved in chlorobenzene and LiTFSI and tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was used as the additive (0.167 g of spiro-OMeTAD, 0.0298 g of TBP, and 0.0103 g in 1 mL of chlorobenzene), and then the solution was deposited by spin-coating at 5500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick Au electrode was deposited on top of the device through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation under vacuum conditions.
2.3 Measurement and characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). FTIR spectra were measured using a Bruker Vertex 80v Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The surface morphologies of the films were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Quanta 250FEG) and an atomic force microscope (AFM; Brook Multimode 8). Absorption spectra were measured with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a PHI5000VERSA PROBE II instrument. The PL spectra were obtained at room temperature by using a steady-state lifetime spectrofluorometer (Varian Cary Eclipse). The time-resolved photoluminescence decay was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system. The current–voltage characteristic curves were measured under standard AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-90L2, Wacom). The storage stability test of PSCs was evaluated by storing the devices in an inert atmosphere (N2, 25 °C, and RH of 25 ± 5%) without any encapsulation. The UV soaking stability was tested under continuous 365 nm UV irradiation (390 W cm−2) from the FTO side.
3 Results and discussion
As a broad-spectrum UV absorber, HMBS is widely used in various sunscreen cosmetics due to its high absorption efficiency of UVa and UVb in the solar light spectrum. As shown in Fig. 1a, the molecular structure of HMBS contains a carbonyl group connecting two benzene rings, and a hydroxyl group, a methoxyl group, and a sulfonic acid group are located on one of the benzene rings. The hydroxyl group and the adjacent oxygen of the carbonyl group can form a closed cycle by an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Under UV irradiation or at high temperature (e.g., 100 °C), the hydrogen bond ring will be opened to release the external energy. After opening the hydrogen bond, the positive electrostatic potential is more concentrated on the methoxyl group and the negative electrostatic potential of HMBS is more concentrated on the sulfonic acid group, thus realizing the effective separation of electron donors and acceptors in the molecule, and then promoting the charge transfer within the molecule. The resulting enol structure can further passivate defects by interacting with undercoordinated metal cations such as Sn4+ in SnO2 and Pb2+ in the perovskite.19 In addition, the electronegativity increase is more favorable for the sulfonic group to coordinate with the uncoordinated metal cations (e.g., Sn4+ and Pb2+) to passivate surface defects.20–22 It should be mentioned that the electrostatic potential structure of HMBS is asymmetric both before and after UV irradiation; such an asymmetric electronegative structure will form an electric dipole layer, which is conducive to achieving more effective interface carrier transport.23,24 The frontier molecular orbitals, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), of HMBS before and after UV irradiation also show the electron density concentrated on one of the benzene rings and the asymmetrical distribution of the electron cloud will facilitate the charge transfer between HMBS and adjacent materials.25 Thus, HMBS is an ideal interface material for perovskite solar cells no matter with or without ultraviolet radiation. Most importantly, the sulfonic acid group in HMBS can eliminate most of the hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface by an esterification reaction to inhibit the corrosion effect of hydroxyl groups on the upper perovskite film and thus improve the stability of the perovskite film. The protection effect of HMBS on perovskite films was further studied through a UV aging experiment, as shown in Fig. 1b. Compared with the perovskite films modified with HMBS, there is a rapid enhancement of the characteristic peak intensity related to PbI2 (at 2θ of ∼12.6°) in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the perovskite deposited on the bare SnO2 substrate, indicating that HMBS can effectively prevent the degradation of perovskite films under UV irradiation.

The interaction mechanism between HMBS and SnO2 was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the obvious shift of the CO stretching vibration characteristic peak in the structure after coating HMBS on the SnO2 substrate confirmed both the existence of HMBS molecules on the SnO2 surface and the strong chemical interaction between HMBS and SnO2.26 The appearance of an S 2p characteristic peak in Fig. 1c also confirmed the existence of HMBS on the surface of the SnO2 film again. Furthermore, the Sn 3d XPS spectra of bare SnO2 and HMBS-modified SnO2 films further confirmed the interaction between HMBS and SnO2 (Fig. 1d).27 Especially, an asymmetric wide peak was observed in the O 1s XPS spectra of both the bare SnO2 and HMBS-modified SnO2 films. Therefore, it can be deconvoluted into the characteristic peaks of O atoms in two different environments, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. One peak at about 530 eV was related to the hydroxyl group (OH−) and another peak at about 528 eV was originated from the lattice oxygen (O2−).28 By calculating the corresponding peak area, the ratio of OH− to O2− in the HMBS-modified SnO2 ETL decreased from 0.55 to 0.28, which directly proved that HMBS could eliminate most of the hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface.
Subsequently, we performed ultraviolet electron spectroscopy (UPS) characterization to reveal the effect of HMBS on the surface work function (WF) and energy band structure of SnO2 films, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. Based on the optical bandgap obtained in Fig. S4b (ESI†) and the results of UPS, the energy level structure diagram of each functional layer can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 2c. Compared to the controlled SnO2 ETL, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the HMBS-modified SnO2 ETL was closer to that of the PVK film, which was conducive to the charge transport at the ETL/PVK interface and the improvement of device open circuit voltage (VOC).29 Moreover, we measured the dark current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of different devices to qualitatively evaluate the effect of HMBS on the conductivity of the SnO2 ETL. As shown in Fig. 2d, the conductivity of FTO/SnO2-HMBS/Au devices was slightly increased, which might be attributed to the effective passivation of SnO2 surface defect states by HMBS. Although the introduction of HMBS has a significant effect on the surface properties of SnO2 films, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the surface morphology SnO2 film (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the SnO2 film (Fig. S4a, ESI†) did not change obviously after the HMBS modification, nor did the high transmittance of incident light (Fig. S5, ESI†).

Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†) show the XRD patterns and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite films prepared on different substrates to study the effect of HMBS on the upper perovskite crystal structure and film quality. Compared with the controlled perovskite films deposited directly on the bare SnO2 substrate, the characteristic diffraction peaks related to the perovskite structure in the XRD pattern of the HMBS-modified perovskite films did not show an obvious shift but had stronger diffraction intensity and narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM), and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectral intensity was also slightly improved. These results showed that the HMBS interface modification strategy is conducive to the preparation of perovskite films with higher quality, larger grain size, and lower grain boundary density, which was also consistent with the morphological observation of perovskite films shown in Fig. 3a–d. And the shift of proton electron cloud density in liquid 1H NMR shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) directly proved the formation of coordination bonds between HMBS molecules and Pb2+ ions,30 which is also consistent with the results reflected by XPS of the perovskite films peeled from different substrates (Fig. S9, ESI†). Moreover, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and corresponding time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite films deposited on glass substrates with or without HMBS modification were measured to reveal the effect of HMBS on the photoelectric properties of the upper perovskite films. Compared with the perovskite films deposited directly on the bare glass substrate, the perovskite films prepared on the glass substrate modified with HMBS have higher PL strength (Fig. 3e) and longer carrier transport life (Fig. 4a), indicating that HMBS can effectively improve the crystallization quality of the upper perovskite film and reduce the density of defects in the film. The electron trap density (Ntrap) in the perovskite film prepared on the HMBS-modified glass substrates was significantly reduced from the initial 1.47 × 1015 to 5.94 × 1014 cm−3, which further proved the positive effect of HMBS on crystal growth of the upper perovskite films.31 Furthermore, the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also showed that the devices modified with HMBS have higher recombination resistance, so it is more conducive to reduce the recombination loss of carriers at the interface, improve the transmission efficiency, and then lead to the improvement of VOC and the fill factor (FF), as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†).32 Based on the above analyses, we believe that HMBS can not only eliminate most of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of SnO2 ETLs and improve the crystal quality of the upper PVK films, but also can interact with the uncoordinated metal cations (Sn4+ and/or Pb2+) to passivate surface defects at the interface, as shown in Fig. 4a.

To further explore the effect of HMBS on photovoltaic performance, planar PSCs with the architecture of FTO/ETL/PVK/HTL/Au were fabricated. The optimal treatment concentration of HMBS was obtained by comparing the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs prepared at different treatment concentrations of HMBS. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), when the concentration of HMBS was 0.1 mg mL−1, the corresponding PSC can show the highest PCE. Therefore, we choose the concentration of HMBS to be 0.1 mg mL−1 to modify the interface afterwards in this work. Fig. 4b shows the champion I–V curves of reverse scanning (RS) and forward scanning (FS) measured at a scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1 through a shadow mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of PSCs. As a result, the optimized PSC modified with HMBS exhibited the highest PCE of 23.75% with a high VOC of 1.16 V measured by RS, while the highest PCE of the controlled PSC in RS was only 21.75% with a VOC of 1.12 V and an even lower PCE of 20.48% in FS. Due to the effective passivation of interface defects, the optimization of energy level arrangement, and the improvement of the crystal quality of the upper perovskite film, the VOC values of the HMBS-modified devices were significantly improved. The integrated current densities (JSC) calculated according to the EQE spectrum were also consistent well with the results of I–V curves (Fig. S11, ESI†). Fig. 4c shows the steady-state output PCE of different devices at the maximum power point voltage to further characterize the output stability. In addition, the statistical photovoltaic parameters of 16 PSCs also proved that HMBS can be used as an effective interface modifier to improve the device fabrication reproducibility (Fig. S12, ESI†). We also prepared devices with a size of 1 cm2 according to the optimized HMBS concentration and obtained a champion efficiency value of 20.63% (Fig. S13, ESI†). Meanwhile, the stability of PSCs modified with HMBS was also systematically studied, as shown in Fig. 4d and e. After 1000 hours of storage under controlled conditions (∼25 °C, relative humidity of 25 ± 5%), the unencapsulated HMBS-modified device can still maintain ∼90% of the initial efficiency (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the efficiency of the controlled device is reduced to about 60% of the original efficiency. Moreover, the test results of the UV stability of the HMBS-modified PSCs under continuous UV irradiation from the FTO side also prove that our interface modification strategy can significantly enhance the UV resistance of the devices (Fig. 4e).
4 Conclusion
To sum up, we have proved that HMBS can be used as an effective multifunctional interface crosslinker for SnO2-based planar PSCs to achieve higher photovoltaic performance and UV resistance. Owing to the effective passivation of the defects on the buried interface, the adjustment of the interface energy level arrangement, the improvement of the crystallization quality of the perovskite film, and the effective protection against UV light, the highest PCE of the HMBS-modified PSCs reached 23.42% (0.09cm2) and 20.63% (1.00 cm2). Meanwhile, the HMBS-modified device can also still retain ∼70% of the initial efficiency after nearly 500 hours of continuous UV irradiation. These results proved the feasibility of our multifunctional interface modification strategy based on UV absorbers.
