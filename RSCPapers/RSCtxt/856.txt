Introduction
Agriculture in Tunisia faces acute problems of water quality and quantity caused by limited conventional water resources. One possibility to cope with low water resources is to purify wastewater for reuse. In this case, pathological microorganisms pose a potentially serious health risk to the population in those regions. To avoid health and ecological hazards caused by using effluents in crop irrigation, the treatment of domestic sewage may involve in its last stage a disinfection treatment, which inactivates pathogens. Disinfection of effluents can be achieved by a variety of methods, mostly using chlorine, hypochlorites, chlorine dioxide, ozone and UV light. Several physico-chemical treatments have been investigated as alternatives to chlorine. In particular, a photochemical procedure was used for disinfection of effluents with sunlight as the energy source; the oxygen dissolved in water as the oxidizing agent, a dye as an intermediary for the absorption and transfer of the light energy to the oxygen and/or organic matter molecules and the microorganisms as the oxidation target. The oxidative species (1O2, OH˙, O2−, H2O2) which might be produced in this procedure irreversibly altered the vital cell constituents and resulted in lethal damage.1 Singlet oxygen by itself is a cytotoxic agent, at least against microorganisms. This has been shown by experiments where the dye did not contact the cell membrane or even penetrate into the cytoplasm.2
The biochemical and functional effects of porphyrin photosensitization include cross-linking and photooxidation of membrane proteins, peroxidation of lipids, inhibition of transport of some essential metabolites, leakage of lysosomal enzymes and increased cellular uptake of porphyrins.3 Such damage probably permits the penetration of photosensitizer molecules into the cytoplasm. However, the cytoplasmic membrane represents the main site of cell photodamage leading to the damage of targets, which are critical for cell survival.3
The use of photochemical reactions for water disinfection was previously studied.4–10 The usefulness of dye sensitizers, e.g. Rose Bengal and Methylene Blue has been tested under laboratory conditions and sunlight exposure.1,4,6,7
Porphyrins demonstrate the photodynamic activity against psoriasis, atheromatous plaque, viral and bacterial infections including HIV.11,12 On the other hand, cationic meso-substitued porphyrins are known to exhibit different photosensitising properties compared with porphyrin-type compounds.13 Thus, we have decided to investigate their photosensitising activity to purify wastewater and to compare their efficiency with that of Rose Bengal and Methylene Blue.
Photosensitised oxidations can take place by two main mechanisms called Type I and Type II. A Type I mechanism implies the initial interaction between the excited sensitizer and the substrate resulting in either H-atom or electron transfer. The radicals so produced react with oxygen to regenerate the sensitizer and to form peroxy radicals or superoxide radicals leading to the formation of oxygenation products. Type II takes place via initial interaction between molecular oxygen and the sensitizer to produce singlet molecular oxygen (1O2, 1Δg) or superoxide radical anions.14–17 Indeed, in photosensitised reactions, light energy is absorbed by one reagent (the sensitizer) and secondary processes lead to chemical modification of a second reagent (the substrate).
The primary products of a photosensitization process can rapidly generate new products according to a cascade of secondary processes if they are unstable in the medium used.
In the present work, we study the photosensitised oxidation by these three photosensitizers: Rose Bengal disodium salt (RB-2Na), Methylene Blue (MB) and meso-substituted tetra-cationic porphyrin (T4MPYP) to disinfect wastewater for agricultural unrestricted future reuse. The effects of fecal coliform survival by different factors influencing the effectiveness of the photooxidation reaction e.g. the nature and the concentration of sensitizers and the time of exposure to solar radiation are determined in our experiments.
Materials and methods
Samples (2000 ml) of secondary wastewater, containing an added sensitizer (MB, RB and T4MPYP) were exposed to sunlight for different radiation times. Experiments were done during summer in the north of Tunisia (semi-arid area). The global average sunbeam was 3290 cal cm−2 per day (1 cal = 4.184 J).18 In parallel light luminance was measured with a luxmeter at area (i.e. surface) solution (Scientech 373, power and energy meter). The average luminance during phototreatment operation was approximately 130 000 lux. According to the conversion factor: 1 lux ≃ 9.5×10−3 mW cm−2 ≃ 1.8×10−3 µM m−2 s−1 of visible photons (400–700 nm),19 the water's surface (690 cm2) in the basin receives during 1 h of solar exposure about 3.24 × 1022 photons. The distribution of the wavelengths of the solar spectrum is concentrated between 400 and 1200 nm with the peak around 500–600 nm (Fig. 1). 8% of solar radiation constitutes the UV radiation (λ < 400 nm).

At first, efforts were made on small volumes to understand the photosensitisation process (scientific and economic) and to control it in a better way. The experiments were carried out in 3 l basins (square shape). The depth of the liquid was 2.2 cm. When the desired amount of radiation was reached, the samples were examined for fecal bacteria (MPN methods). Control samples kept either in the dark (with MB, RB and T4MPYP) or exposed to sunlight (without a sensitizer), were run simultaneously. The experiments were conducted with stagnant water without mechanical mixing and aeration on water recirculation. The photosensitizers were directly dissolved in bi-distilled water at a concentration of 2.5 mg ml−1. The concentration was checked spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient (Table 1).

When light passes through a solution of a compound some wavelengths are transmitted, some are scattered and the remainder are absorbed in proportion to the concentration of absorbing substance. Absorbed light is of the greatest importance in photosensitisation. The number of photons absorbed at different wavelengths is the difference between incident and transmitted light (allowing for scattering, etc.). The number of photons absorbed at different wavelengths constitutes an absorption spectrum, which gives much information on molecular configuration, electronic transition and energy levels. Absorption spectra of sensitizers are measured with a Vis-UV spectrophotometer (Fig. 2). The absorption of photons is given by the Beer-Lambert law: I = I0e−εCl(1)With I0 photons per unit area and time passing into the cuvette of thickness l (cm) and a fraction I not absorbed and passing through it, the fraction absorbed is I0 − I. C is the molar concentration of absorber and ε is the molar extinction coefficient (unit, M−1 cm−1), characteristic of the absorber in a particular solvent at a given wavelength. Transmittance, I/I0, is related to optical density (OD), also called absorbance or extinction as: OD = logI0/I = εCl(2)Table 1 shows the percentage of incident radiation absorbed with different sensitizer concentrations by the liquid (2.2 cm deep) using the Beer-Lambert law of absorption (eqn. (2)). It seems clear that a higher fraction of radiation is absorbed in the water treated by cationic porphyrin.

Secondary activated sludge treated effluents from the wastewater treatment plant of Charguia city (60 m3 per day, 400 000 inhabitants) was the source of water.

Results and discussion
The occurrence of fecal coliforms in water is regarded as the most important indicator of water pollution from the feces of warm-blooded animals. Based on recommended microbiological quality guidelines for wastewater use in agriculture (WHO),21 1000 fecal coliforms per 100 ml are appropriate for irrigation of crops likely to be eaten uncooked. A more stringent guideline (≤200 fecal coliforms per 100 ml) is appropriate for public lawns, with which the public may come into direct contact.
The results of control samples kept either in the dark with sensitizer or exposed to sunlight (without sensitizer) show a not significant decrease of bacteria in wastewater.
The effect of 240 min sunlight irradiation on decreasing numbers of fecal coliforms with different concentration of T4MPYP was investigated. At the lower concentration of 1 µM, only a small effect can be observed in comparison to that observed at higher concentration (5 and 10 µM), during 240 min of sunlight exposure. Indeed the variance analyses between lower and higher concentrations are significantly different (P > 0.05). Concerning higher concentrations, the variance analyses are not significantly different between 5 and 10 µM of T4MPYP (P < 0.05) at the end of the treatment time (240 min).
After 60 min sunlight treatment, the following decreases in fecal bacterial counts were observed (log counts) respectively with 5 and 10 µM of T4MPYP: 2.94 ± 0.2 and 2.4 ± 0.2. After 240 min, we obtained a total log reduction (≤0.47 log units) with both concentrations: 5 and 10 µM of T4MPYP.
The concentration of 5 µM cationic porphyrin seems more suitable to reduce fecal coliforms in wastewater for these reasons: It allows one to obtain a good treatment yield and is more economic. Moreover using the low photosensitizer concentration avoids the formation of aggregates (in the case of RB),22 allows a better light penetration in water (in the case of MB)6 and limits the accumulation of photosensitised molecules in the environment.23
The efficiency of these concentrations: 1, 5 and 10 µM of T4MPYP, RB and MB on fecal coliform reduction during 240 min exposure time is represented in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Photoreduction of fecal coliforms in wastewater by different concentrations of sensitizers (T4MPYP, RB and MB). Concentration of sensitizer: (a) 1 µM, (b) 5 µM and (c) 10 µM. 
Illuminated cationic porphyrin photoinactivates fecal coliforms in wastewater more efficiently than RB and MB at low (1 µM) and high (5 and 10 µM) concentrations. Our results show that a concentration of 1 µM of sensitizer is insufficient to furnish a suitable quality of water (i.e. coliform count ≤ 102 per 100 ml) even after 240 min of solar radiation exposure. Under these conditions, the two dyes RB and MB seem equally efficient but less efficient than T4MPY (Fig. 3).
As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the fecal bacterial photosensitivity increased with increasing sensitizer concentrations.
With a concentration of 10 µM, the reclaimed wastewater quality (coliform count ≤ 102 per 100 ml) could be obtained either by a 60 min solar exposure with T4MPYP or by a 120 min exposure with RB or by 240 min exposure with MB. Likewise, identical results are reached with 5 µM of T4MPYP and RB, respectively, after 60 and 240 min solar radiation exposure.
The variance analyses between the efficiency of 5 µM of tetra-cationic porphyrin on the one hand and RB and MB on the other hand, are significantly different. Moreover, RB allows fecal coliform log count reduction that is more important than MB especially during the first time of sunlight irradiation. The difference in microbial counts (log counts) observed during the first 2 h between 5 µM of RB and MB was 1.2 ± 0.2. This difference becomes approximately 0.2 ± 0.06 during the fourth hour of phototreatment. Thus the increasing duration of irradiation increases the log count reduction in fecal coliforms.
For comparison, the use of the same sensitizer concentration and illumination intensity indicates that MB is the less efficient sensitizer. Indeed the MB possesses the lowest average Einstein energy and a weaker apparent quantum yield (Table 3). The effect of the amount of energy supplied to the photosensibilisation reaction depends upon the light intensity in the range of the sensitizer absorption and the period of radiation.

The photons emitted by ultraviolet or visible light have the energy in the range of 1.5 and 4.4 eV. This energy is sufficient for excitation of an electron from an initially occupied, low energy orbital to a high energy, previously unoccupied orbital.24 The energy of a photon (E) is calculated from eqn. (3). It depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave (γ), which is related to the wavelength (λ) E = hγ = hc/λ(3)Where h is Planck's constant (6.62 × 10−34 J s−1), c is the velocity of light in vacuo (3 × 108 m s−1). The photon energy of the selected wavelength of light corresponding to the maximum absorption band of the photosensitizer is given in Table 3.
The average spectral extinction coefficient for each of the sensitizers based on the spectrum of sunlight and on the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer are calculated. Then the average value of the Einstein s−1 absorbed in each basin is determined. The results in terms of apparent quantum yield (rate of disappearance of fecal bacteria/rate of photon absorbed) are represented in Table 3.
To capture a photon of visible light, the energy levels of the atomic or molecular orbital must have a difference in energy corresponding to the absorbed quantum. The energy levels are designated by a total quantum number. The quantum yield of a given photochemical product is the probability that the absorption of one photon by the system leads to one molecule of that product.
Furthermore, the type II (generation of radicals and oxygenation products) process is in general predominant with the sensitizers, which absorb in visible light (dyes). Whereas the type I (production of singlet molecular oxygen) process takes place favourably with sensitizers which absorb in the ultraviolet region.14 Indeed the illumination of RB in the visible region generates singlet oxygen primarily, whereas irradiation in the UV generates singlet oxygen plus very reactive radical species.25 Lower-energy (long-wavelength) radiation is sufficient to excite molecular rotation and vibration, which involve displacements of the nuclei. With higher energy (shorter wavelength) radiation the electrons in bound molecular energy states are excited causing chemical change. Table 4 gives the quantum yield of intersystem conversion singlet–triplet, the quantum yield of singlet oxygen production and the energy of triplet excited state (kJ mol−1) of Rose Bengal, Methylene Blue and the meso-tetra-cationic porphyrin.

The data presented herein show that: (1) The higher fraction of solar radiation is absorbed by cationic porphyrin, followed by MB and the RB at the end. (2) The most energetic visible photons are absorbed by cationic porphyrin, followed by RB and the MB at the end. (3) The UV photon absorbed by cationic porphyrin and RB is more energetic than absorbed by MB. (4) The photophysical characteristics of RB seem better than MB in the same buffer. This suggests that T4MPYP is more effective for bacteria inactivation in wastewater during sunlight exposure than RB, which is more effective than MB.
To deepen this point and on the basis of literature data,7,13,27–35 it appears logical to hypothesize that the differences in the photoinactivation of bacteria are also the consequence of the degree of sensitizer hydrophobicity, the different distribution in the various compartments of cells, the number of positive or negative charges and the formation of aggregation.
In previous work, we demonstrate that suspended solids interfere with the disinfection process by reducing light penetration, by deactivating the sensitizer (T4MPYP) and by protecting the helminth eggs by their adsorption.10 The same behaviour was observed for fecal bacteria. The decrease in log counts of fecal coliforms was 1 ± 0.3 after 1 h phototreatment by 5 µM RB, MB and T4MPYP when the suspended solids (SS) reach 50 mg l−1.
The strong influence of T4MPYP and sunlight on fecal bacteria may be of environmental importance, in view of the fact that wastewater disinfection by T4MPYP and sunlight is a suitable scenario in an arid town (appropriate climate, natural medium protected, wastewater reused in agriculture).
 Fig. 4  Photoinactivation of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by 5 µM of different sensitizers. 
On the other hand, we found that Gram-negative bacteria (fecal coliforms) appear to be more resistant to photosensitised alteration than Gram-positive bacteria (fecal streptococci) (Fig. 4). Other authors have reported similar results.36–38 Gram-negative bacteria display a remarkable resistance to photosensitization unless the permeability of the outer membrane is artificially increased.13,38
The photodynamic inactivation by illuminated Rose Bengal of a number of bacterial species has been compared. The Gram-positive species were inactivated about 200× more quickly (99% inactivation) than Salmonella typhimurium wild type strain.39 Cationic meso-substituted porphyrins efficiently photosensitize the inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria.13,40 The Gram-negative bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide coat (LPS) offers some protection from the toxic effects of exogenous agents. This capacity enables these bacteria to survive in what otherwise must be considered hostile environments. The LPS has previously been shown to present a physical or chemical barrier through which singlet oxygen and hydroxyl free radicals generated outside cells must pass to interact with a vital target, such as membrane or cytoplasmic components.39,41,42
In view of the results shown in Fig. 4, we confirm again the remarkable efficiency of cationic porphyrin towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative in comparison with RB and MB. Bacteria photoinactivation methods using photosensitizers such as porphyrin or RB dyes have shown promise for wastewater disinfection. Most photosensitizers used in biomedical studies are degraded on light illumination. This process, usually called photobleaching, involves a decrease in the absorption or fluorescence intensity.43 Different sensitizers are photobleached at different rates in solution, cells and tissues. Photobleaching of RB, T4MPYP and MB is detected during the irradiation experiments. Fig. 5 compares the photobleaching of RB, T4MPYP and MB in wastewater during 240 min sunlight irradiation.
 Fig. 5  Photobleaching of sensitizers in wastewater. 
The photodecomposition rate of MB was faster than RB, which is faster than T4MPYP. Moreover the degradation of sensitizers proceeded faster at the start of irradiation, and then the reaction rate slowed especially for MB. Sunlight irradiation of T4MPYP, RB and MB in aqueous solutions led to their total photooxidation.
It has been demonstrated that the efficiency of photobleaching and the formation of photoproducts in aqueous solution seems to be conditioned by the aggregation state and chemical structure of the photosensitizer.44 The excited porphyrin molecule is degraded either by products formed by itself or by direct interaction with its surroundings.45
After the disinfection treatment, the residual dye sensitizer can be removed from wastewater by adsorption on a filtrate column if colourless effluents are desired. Our results demonstrate that the photosensitizer residual concentration was completely removed by adsorption on a salt column. We can also use a reactor with an immobilized dye in order to avoid the necessity to recover dissolved photosensitizer after photodynamic treatment from the purified wastewater.46
The photostability of the sensitizers used in wastewater disinfection can be considered a disadvantage or an advantage. Bleaching of RB, MB and T4MPYP and the formation of photolysed products as such did not lead to any additional effect. This was tested by preillumination of 5 µM distilled water until the 3 µM level had been reached when determined photometrically. Then, wastewater in the rough (i.e. secondary activated sludge treated effluent) was added for further illumination. After this addition, the new concentration becomes 2 µM. The survival curve was identical with that obtained with freshly prepared 2 µM RB, MB and T4MPYP wastewater (data not shown).
Conclusion
The fecal coliforms were photoinactivated with T4MPYP in a shorter time of sunlight exposure than MB or RB. This suggests that T4MPYP is more effective for bacteria inactivation in wastewater than RB or MB. In addition, MB seems to have photoinactivated fecal bacteria less efficiently than RB. The data presented herein show an interrelation between bacteria photoinactivation, sensitizer concentration, length of irradiation time and sensitizer maximum absorption.
The photobleaching of MB in wastewater is faster than T4MPYP and RB. T4MPYP appears the most photostable sensitizer in an aqueous solution exposed to sunlight irradiation. A concentration of 5 µM of T4MPYP allows one to obtain satisfactory log reduction in fecal bacteria. Increasing duration of irradiation will improve the wastewater yield treatment. It can compensate for a low concentration of sensitizer, a less efficient sensitizer type or a mediocre quality wastewater (charged in SS). The findings reported in this paper further support the conclusion that porphyrins represent a class of photosensitizing agents that are potentially useful in environmental management.
The influence of meteorological conditions, temperature, air movements, and rainfall on this procedure, are still to be studied. The low number of rainy days per year and their relatively short duration, in the semi arid and arid area (specially the centre and the south of Tunisia) probably excluded them from being an important factor. At present, we are extending our study to examine the feasibility of sunlight disinfection of wastewater with T4MPYP in a pilot scale plant.
