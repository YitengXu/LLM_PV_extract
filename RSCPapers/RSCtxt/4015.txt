    , Accepted 2nd January 2015First published on 2nd January 2015AbstractIn the present work we introduce a path to the controlled construction of DSSCs based on hierarchically structured single walled, self-organized TiO2 layers. In a first step we describe a simple approach to selectively remove the inner detrimental shell of anodic TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). This then allows controlled well-defined layer-by-layer decoration of these TiO2-NT walls with TiO2 nanoparticles (in contrast to conventional TiO2 nanotubes). We show that such defined multiple layered decoration can be optimized to build dye sensitized solar cells that (under back-side illumination conditions) can yield solar light conversion efficiencies to the extent of 8%. The beneficial effects observed can be ascribed to a combination of three factors: (1) improved electronic properties of the “single walled” tubes themselves, (2) a further improvement of the electronic properties by the defined TiCl4 treatment, and (3) a higher specific dye loading that becomes possible for the layer-by-layer decorated single walled tubes.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a great deal of interest in research and technology due to their high industrial potential towards low cost and versatile solar conversion technologies.1 In the classic Grätzel-type cells the photoanode consists of a compacted TiO2 nanoparticle film coated with a monolayer of a suitable inorganic dye.1 The dye acts as a light absorber where electrons are excited from the dye's HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level,1d,f and from there are injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 scaffold. Electrons then travel to the back contact and into an electrochemical conversion circuit. High conversion efficiency is reached if light absorption is maximized, and recombination – mainly with oxidized dye and electrolyte – is minimized (i.e., if the electron transfer rate through the TiO2 network is faster than the various recombination pathways).2 In order to suppress some potential drawbacks of nanoparticle based networks (e.g. random walk2d of carriers with an accordingly long diffusion path and recombination at grain junctions), over the past decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to the use of 1D scaffolds such as nanorods, nanowires, or nanotubes instead of nanoparticle layers.2b,3 However, many 1D structures provide a specific surface area that is 2–3 times lower than comparable layers fabricated from nanoparticles – thus the dye-loading per volume element of the photoanode is significantly lower. To overcome this issue, i.e. to combine a high surface area and directional electron transport, a number of hierarchical TiO2 structures have been described in the literature.4 For example, Grätzel et al.4c used TiO2-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide nano-forest-like photoanode films grown by pulsed laser deposition to achieve fast electron transport, and decorated it with dye sensitized TiO2 – this hierarchical mesostructure provided an overall DSSC efficiency of 4.9%.
Over the past few years, a most frequently investigated 1D architecture is TiO2-nanotube layers that are grown from Ti metal sheets by a simple self-organizing electrochemical anodization process.5 This approach has the inherent advantage that the tube layers can be used directly in a “back-side illumination” configuration – i.e. using the Ti metal substrate, where the tubes are grown from, directly as a back contact for the TiO2 photoanode, as illustrated in the ESI, Fig. S1a.† The term “back-side illumination” is used here to maintain the classification as used in nanoparticle cells (where front-side refers to “through the TiO2 layer” and back-side to “through the Pt back contact and electrolyte”). These “back-side” configurations (in the particle case) always have a lower efficiency than front-side illumination configuration DSSCs (because in a back-side configuration some light is absorbed by the Pt-coated FTO and the iodine electrolyte).1h
Most efforts to increase the efficiency of such TiO2 nanotube based cells target smaller diameter nanotubes, bamboo geometries, or a secondary modification of the tube layers using etching or particle decoration to reach a higher specific surface area.6 An overview of literature results from DSSCs based on TiO2 nanotubes used in a back-side illumination configuration is given in Fig. S1b.† Included are various efforts to change the tube dimensions and modify the active light harvesting area. Until now, TiO2-nanotube layers that hold a record DSSC back-side illumination efficiency of 7.12% are layers that after formation again were processed with a hydrothermal treatment4b that enhanced the tube wall roughness and thus the specific dye adsorption. For front-side illumination nanotube-based DSSCs the world-record efficiency is >9%; nevertheless the approach is based on a tedious lift-off of limited size and fragile membranes from the substrate that then are attached on FTO with a thin layer of TiO2 nanoparticles.3h,i For a more realistic (scalable) approach usually thin layers of Ti are evaporated on FTO, then completely anodized to transparency, and finally used in a classic solar cell assembly; however, for such structures the best front-side efficiency is ≈7%.7
These nanotubes as well as most anodic TiO2 nanotube layers used in the literature were grown using the most common growth approach in an ethylene glycol (EG)/fluoride electrolyte. Nevertheless, all these EG based anodic tubes, due to the nature of the formation mechanism, consist of a two layer (inner and outer shell) structure, well established in the literature,8 and as illustrated in Fig. 1a and S2.† This double walled nanotube morphology is only clearly apparent in SEM for tubes after annealing, or directly in TEM close to the tube bottom. In double walled tubes, the comparably thick inner layer contains a high amount of impurities and affects the sintering behavior during thermal treatments of the tubes.8 Moreover, it narrows the inner diameter of the tubes and constrains the possibilities of modifying the inner tube wall (e.g. by a well-controlled layer-by-layer TiCl4 treatment or other TiO2 particle decoration as we describe below).

In the present work we show that these conventional TiO2 nanotube layers (valid for all tubes grown in EG) can be stripped from their inner layer by a suitable annealing/etching sequence, and we demonstrate that the resulting single walled nanotubes (Fig. 1b) allow a defined layer-by-layer coating with TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). This enables the careful adjustment and optimization of a hierarchical geometry towards high efficiency DSSCs (in contrast to attempts using classic TiO2 nanotubes grown in any EG electrolyte (Fig. S3†)). As a result, in this work we obtained conversion efficiencies for solar light close to 8% (7.82% ± 0.2) with an N719 dye1f (Ru-based dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl 4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium)) which is until now the highest value reported for any back-side illuminated TiO2-nanotube based DSSC. This effect is not only due to an increase of the active area but also due to accelerated charge transport observed for TiCl4 treated nanotube walls.
Results and discussion
TiO2 nanotube layers were grown in an EG/lactic acid electrolyte9 to a length of 16 μm as described in ref. 9a. This approach leads to well anchored TiO2 nanotube layers on the Ti metal substrate (which is advantageous for DSSC applications).9b After anodic growth, the tube walls consist, as expected, of a double shell structure evident from Fig. 1a.
In order to remove the inner shell we developed a selective core removal treatment as described in the ESI† (Experimental details). It is based on the finding that a combination of a mild annealing treatment (150 °C) followed by an optimized piranha etch leads to the selective dissolution of the inner tube shell.
After removal of the inner shell (Fig. S2†), the inner diameter of the tubes is widened from approx. 40 nm to 110 nm (Fig. 1), with an inner wall surface that is smooth and well defined, and due to the stripping of the inner shell the amount of carbon contaminants strongly drops (Fig. S5 and S6†). The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1b and in Fig. S2† confirm that the inner shell of the nanotubes has been removed completely, i.e. also at the bottom of the nanotubes.
These opened tube layers were then layer-by-layer decorated with nanoparticles using an approach based on TiCl4-hydrolysis (as commonly used in particle solar cells1d) and as described in the ESI.† We used conditions under which each particle layer added a thickness increment of approx. 13 nm with individual TiO2 particles of ≈3 nm diameter. Fig. 1c shows SEM images of single walled nanotube layers after the first and fourth layers of decoration. In every case the formed tube walls were well and uniformly decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles on the outside and inside (Fig. S4†).

Fig. 2 shows the solar cell performance for an increasing number of sequential TiCl4 treatments using single and double walled TiO2 nanotubes. For the single walled tubes a maximum efficiency of η = 7.82% (±0.2) is reached after four time decoration with TiO2 nanoparticle layers. Clearly, the TiCl4 decoration not only improves the surface area but also improves the fill factor. The reason for the decay in the performance for more than 4 layers is likely that for an even higher TiO2 nanoparticle loading the electrolyte penetration into the tubes starts getting hampered (see Fig. 1c after 5 layers), due to a clogging of the inner tube channel. The significance of the removal of the inner tube shell becomes clear, if the layer-by-layer treatment is attempted for conventional nanotube samples (Fig. 2b) – in this case already after applying nominally 2 layers, a maximum efficiency of η = 5.53% (±0.14) is reached and overall a well-defined decoration is not possible even for this second layer, due to a non-homogeneous deposition on the tube walls (see Fig. S3†).

(T(n) with n = number of added nanoparticle layers, JSC = short-circuit current, VOC = open-circuit voltage, FF = fill factor, and η = efficiency.) (c) IPCE spectra of the DSSCs. 

Fig. 2c provides additionally IPCE spectral data for the best solar cell. From these spectral data one can see that due to the use of a back-side configuration the typical photocurrent losses below 500 nm occur due to absorption in the iodine electrolyte.1h Most important, however, is that the single walled tubes show over the entire wavelength region a higher IPCE magnitude, and after optimized layer-by-layer particle decoration a significant photocurrent response at higher wavelengths. Such a difference in the absorption behavior can be ascribed to a different reflectivity of the different tube morphologies (see Fig. S7†).
It is also remarkable that the plain single walled tubes, although having a lower dye loading, show a higher JSC and a higher efficiency than double walled tubes, and even after one layer of decoration the performance of the single walled tubes (η > 6%) is clearly higher than any value obtained for the double walled tubes. This shows that the increased specific surface area for dye decoration cannot be the sole reason for the observed improved performance of a DSSC. In order to evaluate a possible influence of the treatments on the electron transport properties, we carried out IMPS and open circuit voltage decay measurements.

Fig. 3a shows electron transfer time constants of double walled and single walled nanotube layers obtained from IMPS measurements. Clearly, electron transport in single walled nanotubes is faster than that in double walled nanotube samples, and it is remarkable that an additional TiCl4 treatment reduces the transport times even more, i.e. the treatment not only increases the surface area for dye adsorption but it also leads to improved electronic transport properties of the oxide scaffold.

(b) The electron life time derived from open circuit voltage decay (insert) in corresponding DSSCs as a function of VOC. (c) Electron transfer time (tc) constants from IMPS measurements under the UV light (325 nm) for single walled and double walled TiO2 nanotubes with T(n) layers of TiO2 nanoparticle decoration without dye adsorption in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 (in H2O) electrolyte (n = number of TiO2 nanoparticle layers added). 
The open circuit voltage decay measurements show a longer electron life time in double walled tubes than in single walled tubes; however after the TiCl4 treatment even longer life times can be measured. This indicates that while transport is faster in single walled tubes (Fig. 3a), the de-coring treatment may lead to some recombination sites (defects) – the latter can be strongly suppressed by the TiCl4 treatment. Fig. 3b shows that the TiCl4 treatment of double walled tubes also increases the life time, but it is still lower than that for the single walled TiCl4 treated sample (please note that this goes along with the main beneficial effect of single walled tubes that is the considerably faster electron transfer time; Fig. 3a).
The fact that the improvement in solar cells is indeed due to an improvement of the TiO2 scaffold is supported by IMPS measurements of the non-dye sensitized tubes measured under alternating UV excitation in a classic photoelectrochemical cell (Fig. 3c). In Fig. 3c bare single walled tubes show even in an aqueous electrolyte in conventional photoelectrochemical configuration clearly faster electron transport than double walled tubes, and again the TiCl4 treatment is found to strongly improve the transport times. Thus, all above results are in line with an interpretation that a considerable part of the improvement in TiCl4 treated single walled nanotubes is due to enhanced electron transport properties, likely caused by the passivation effect of defects by the TiCl4 treatment.
Conclusion
Overall, in the present work we demonstrate selective removal of the lower quality inner oxide shell of anodic TiO2 nanotubes using a simple chemical etching process. The resulting single walled tubes allow a well-defined layer-by-layer TiO2 nanoparticle decoration of the tube walls using repetitive TiCl4 treatments. These hierarchical TiO2 nanotube structures can significantly enhance the solar cell efficiency in dye sensitized solar cells. Using an optimized nanoparticle decoration we reach for DSSCs, using back-side illumination, an efficiency close to 8%. The beneficial effects observed can be ascribed to a combination of three factors: (1) improved electronic properties of the “single walled” tubes themselves, (2) a further improvement of the electronic properties by the defined TiCl4 treatment, and (3) a higher specific dye loading that becomes possible for the layer-by-layer decorated single walled tubes.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the simple annealing/chemical etching procedure introduced in this work to de-core TiO2 nanotubes from their detrimental inner shell for solar cells should be generally applicable also to other applications of TiO2 nanotubes. In particular, together with controlled TiCl4 treatments this should provide an approach to significantly improve the electronic properties for virtually any photoelectrochemical TiO2 nanotube application.
Experimental section
To grow TiO2 nanotube layers we used titanium foils (0.125 mm thick, 99.6+% purity, Advent, England) that were degreased by sonication in acetone, ethanol and isopropanol, rinsed with deionized water, and then dried with a nitrogen jet. Anodization was carried out with a high-voltage potentiostat (Jaissle IMP 88 PC) at 120 V in a two-electrode configuration with a counter electrode made of a platinum gauze using an electrolyte composition of 1.5 M lactic acid (LA, DL-lactic acid, ∼90%, Fluka), 0.1 M ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and 5 wt% deionized H2O in ethylene glycol (99 vol%) held at a temperature of 60 °C (HAAKE F3 Thermostat) for 1 min 30 s.8 The formed anodic nanotube layers from a first anodization were removed by ultra-sonication. In a second anodization, we used the same experimental conditions. To remove the inner oxide shell (that consists of a carbon containing lower quality oxide7), the samples were annealed at 150 °C in air at a heating and cooling rate of 30 °C min−1 for 1 h using a Rapid Thermal Annealer (Jipelec JetFirst100). Samples were then dipped in a piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 3:1) for 6 min at 70 °C. After immersion in H2O and EtOH, the samples were dried with a nitrogen jet. On etching for significantly longer than the optimized time, the remaining nanotube layer starts to slowly dissolve too. Also, extended exposure can make the TiO2 nanotube layer easier to peel off from the Ti substrate.
In order to convert the TiO2 nanotubes to anatase, the samples were annealed at 450 °C in air at a heating and cooling rate of 30 °C min−1 for 1 h using a Rapid Thermal Annealer.6b
For morphological characterization, a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi SEM FE 4800) was used. The thickness of the nanotubes was measured from SEM cross-sections. Further morphological and structural characterization of the TiO2 nanostructures was carried out with a TEM (Philips CM30 TEM/STEM) (Fig. S2 and S4†). Composition and chemical state information were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600, US) (Fig. S5†) and by Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) (Fig. S6†). X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, X'pert Philips PMD with a PANalytical X'celerator detector) using graphite monochromized CuKα radiation (wavelength: 1.54056 Å) was used for determining the crystal structure of the samples (all samples used here were fully converted to anatase, Fig. S9†).
For dye-sensitization, a Ru-based dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl 4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium) (D719, Everlight, Taiwan, same as the commonly called N719 dye) was used. Samples were dye-sensitized by immersing for 1 day in a 300 mM solution of the Ru-based dye in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio: 1:1). After dye-sensitization, the samples were rinsed with acetonitrile to remove the non-chemisorbed dye. To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, the sensitized nanotubes were sandwiched together with a Pt coated fluorine-doped glass counter electrode (TCO22-15, Solaronix) using a polymer adhesive spacer (Surlyn, Dupont). An electrolyte (0.60 M BMIM-I, 0.03 M I2, 0.10 M GTC in acetonitril/valeronitril (85:15 vol)/SB-163, IoLiTec Inc, Germany) was introduced into the space between the sandwiched cells. Using back-side illumination, the current–voltage characteristics of the cells were measured under simulated AM 1.5 illumination provided by a solar simulator (300 W Xe with an optical filter, Solarlight), applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter. The active area was defined by the opening of the black shadow film mask to be 0.2 cm2.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed with a 150 W Xe arc lamp (LOT-Oriel Instruments) with an Oriel Cornerstone 7400 1/8 m monochromator. The light intensity was measured with an optical power meter.
For TiCl4 treatments we used 0.1 M aqueous solutions of TiCl4 prepared under ice-cooled conditions. The TiO2 nanotube layers were then treated at 70 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the samples were washed with DI water and rinsed with ethanol to remove any excess TiCl4, and finally dried in a nitrogen jet. After the treatment, TiO2 nanotube samples were annealed again at 450 °C for 10 min to crystallize attached nanoparticles.
Dye desorption measurements of the dye sensitized TiO2 layers were carried out by immersing the samples in 5 ml of 10 mM KOH for 30 min. The concentration of the fully desorbed dye was measured spectroscopically (using a Lambda XLS UV/VIS spectrophotometer, PerkinElmer) at 520 nm and the amount of dye absorption on the TiO2 nanotube layer was calculated using the Beer–Lambert law.1g Intensity modulated photovoltage and photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out using modulated light (10% modulation depth) from a high power green LED (λ = 530 nm) and UV (λ = 325 nm). The modulation frequency was controlled by a frequency response analyzer (FRA, Zahner IM6) and the photocurrent or photovoltage of the cell was measured using an electrochemical interface (Zahner IM6), and fed back into FRA for analysis. The light incident intensity on the cell was measured using a calibrated Si photodiode.
