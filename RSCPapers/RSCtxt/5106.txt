Through N2 adsorption–desorption measurements, BiPO4/g-C3N4 showed a large surface area (172.9 m2 g−1) and small pore diameter and the incorporation of BiPO4 caused a red-shift of g-C3N4 in the visible light region by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy. The photocatalytic degradation of benzene over BiPO4/g-C3N4 was investigated. Degradation of benzene could be achieved up to 73% in 2 wt% BiPO4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts under optimum reaction conditions, which was 6 times more when compared with pure g-C3N4 at the same conditions. The improved photoactivity of BiPO4/g-C3N4 could be ascribed to its effective separation of photogenerated hole–electron pairs between BiPO4 and g-C3N4. Furthermore, the BiPO4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts showed excellent stability. By using an in situ FTIR technique, ethyl acetate, carboxylic acid and aldehyde could be regarded as the intermediate products, and CO2 and H2O were produced as the final products. Through electron spin resonance (ESR), OH˙ and O2˙− were examined in the photocatalytic degradation of benzene.
Introduction
Effective applications in solar energy conversion and removal of environmental pollution by semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted considerable attention in modern society.1–4 In the past decade, the traditional photocatalyst TiO2 has been extensively investigated owing to its merits, such as being nontoxic, having low cost and its excellent stability against photocorrosion.5–8 However, it can only be activated by the ultraviolet light (λ < 400 nm), which only constitutes about 4% of the solar spectrum, due to its wide bandgap (anatase 3.4 eV) and has low separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs formed in photocatalytic processes.7 Therefore, it is necessary to fabricate efficient new types of photocatalysts capable of responding to visible light in order to improve the utilization of solar energy.9–11
Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), which is as organic semiconductor materials, are increasing interest in environmental pollutions removal due to the constructed plastic optoelectronic systems and the chemical structure of organic semiconductor materials since Wang et al. reported that g-C3N4 showed a good photocatalytic performance for hydrogen or oxygen product by water splitting under visible light irradiation.12 For g-C3N4, the catalysts possess high stability with respect to thermal and chemical attacks due to its tri-s-triazine ring structure and high condensation. Meanwhile, it features a semiconductor band gap of 2.7 eV corresponding to an optical wavelength of 460 nm, which belongs to the visible light region.13 With an attractive electronic structure, g-C3N4 is an ideal semiconductor and is valuable for photocatalysis driven applications. According to the literature,14–17 the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 is located at about −1.3 V vs. NHE (pH = 7). And its valence band (VB) at about 1.4 V, resulting in a small thermodynamic driving force for organic pollutants oxidation. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of bulk g-C3N4 is limited due to fast recombination of electron–hole pairs formed in photocatalytic process. In order to resolve this problem, several routes have been used including non-metal doping (boron,18 fluorine19 and sulfur20), optimizing porous structure,17 and coupling g-C3N4 with a semiconductor.21,22 In these methods, there is a great interest in the heterostructure of semiconductor catalytic performance. Through the coupling, a synergistic effect may be achieved. High utilization efficiency of solar light can be achieved by a narrow band gap semiconductor.15,23 Simultaneously, high separation rate of photoinduced electrons–hole pairs can be realized due to the interaction of the two semiconductors. Bismuth salt photocatalysts (such as Bi2WO6),24 which have been reported by other groups, exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for degradation of pollution. BiPO4, as one of them, finds application in catalysis and can be used for separating radioactive elements.25,26 PO43−, which possesses a large negative charge, is postulated to help the electron–hole pairs separation, which plays an important role in its excellent photocatalytic activity.
Benzene is regarded as a priority hazardous substance due to its high toxicity, confirmed carcinogenicity and environmental persistence, because it is widely used as a solvent in industrial processes.27–30 Therefore, effective removal of benzene from the ambient environment is necessary by mild technology.
Herein, we synthesized a new inorganic–organic BiPO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites photocatalysts by a hydrothermal method with simple calcination. It was found that the photodegradation activity of BiPO4/g-C3N4 for benzene was greatly enhanced under visible light irradiation compared with that of pure g-C3N4. And the BiPO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites photocatalyst shows excellent stability during photochemical reactions. The mechanism for this enhanced photocatalytic benzene degradation can be ascribed to the large surface area, strong absorption in visible light and excellent charge transfer between BiPO4 and g-C3N4 based on the photoluminescence results.
Experimental section
All chemicals were used as received without any further modification. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, NaH2PO4·2H2O, melamine and anhydrous ethanol were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagents Development Centre. Distilled water was used in the experimental processes.
Photocatalysts preparation
BiPO4 was synthesized by a hydrothermal process. Typically, 8 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 160 mL distilled water under magnetic stirring. Then 28.8 mmol NaH2PO4·2H2O was added to the mixture and stirred for 1 h. The resulting suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 24 h. The products were washed three times with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol, respectively, before being dried at 120 °C for 8 h.
BiPO4/g-C3N4 with different a amount of BiPO4 was synthesized using a calcination method. In a typical procedure, BiPO4 (0.016, 0.036, 0.048 and 0.065 for sample 1 wt% Bi–CN, 2 wt% Bi–CN, 3 wt% Bi–CN and 4 wt% Bi–CN, respectively) was dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous ethanol, and then 15.8 mmol melamine was added and dispersed by ultrasonic for 5 min. The mixtures were dried at 85 °C overnight to remove ethanol. Subsequently, the as prepared mixtures were put into a covered crucible and heated to 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 and 520 °C for another 2 h in a muffle furnace. Pure g-C3N4 was also prepared for comparison purpose.
Characterization
The crystal structure of the samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a powder X-ray diffractometer (LabX-6000, Shimadzu, Japan, λ = 1.5406 Å) with a scan rate of 0.02° s−1 over a 2θ range from 20 to 70°. The morphology of the samples was detected by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM-2100; accelerating voltage, 200 kV). UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-500 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as reference. The pore structure of the obtained sample was characterized by N2 adsorption using an adsorption apparatus (Quantachrome NOVA Instruments V 2.2 gas sorption analyzer). Specific surface area of the samples was determined from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation, and pore volume was determined from the total amount adsorbed at relative pressures near unity. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were surveyed by an Edinburgh FL/FS900 spectrophotometer. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the radicals trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were detected at ambient temperature with a Bruker (E500) spectrometer. The irradiation source was a Quanta-Ray Nd:YAG pulsed laser system (λ = 532 nm, 10 Hz). The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: center field = 3510 G; sweep width = 200 G; microwave frequency = 9.85 GHz; modulation frequency = 100 kHz and power = 20 mW. To minimize measurement errors, the same quartz capillary tube was used throughout the ESR measurements.
Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic degradation of gaseous benzene was carried out under visible light, using a 500 W Xe lamp (Shanghai Seagull Colored Optical Glass Co., Ltd.) with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm). Photocatalytic degradation of benzene was conducted in a Pyrex glass cylindrical reactor with a volume of 120 mL. 0.1 g of the catalysts was put at the bottom of the reactor. Then, benzene vapor was mixed with the air (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen as reaction gas) and introduced into the reactor at room temperature. Once the concentration of the reactants had been stabilized, the inlet and outlet ports were shut off. After adsorption equilibration in the dark for 1 h, the lamp was turned on to allow the photoreaction to proceed. The concentration of benzene was analyzed by gas chromatogram (Agilent7890A) with HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm).
The in situ FTIR measurement was carried out in a home-built IR cell (about 120 mL), equipped with two NaCl windows and a sample holder for the catalyst wafer to analyze the degradation mechanism of benzene. Benzene vapor mixture with dry air, which was pretreated through a drying column packed with desiccant and molecular sieves, was introduced into the IR cell at room temperature. When the sample was saturated with reaction gas, the inlet and outlet ports were shut off. After adsorption equilibration in the dark for 1 h, the 500 W Xe lamp (Shanghai Seagull Colored Optical Glass Co.) with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm) were used as visible light. A Bruker VERTEX 70 FT-IR equipped with a DTGS detector was employed for recording of the FTIR spectra.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the BiPO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites
The XRD pattern was used to investigate the phase structures of the samples, and the typical diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The peak at 27.4° in the XRD patterns of the samples is due to the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, which is indexed for graphitic materials as the (002) peak of the g-C3N4.13 For BiPO4, evidently, the same diffraction peaks as for BiPO4 (JCPDS 15-0766) have been detected, in which the peaks at 25.5°, 29.5°, 31.3°, 41.9° and 48.7° are corresponding to the diffraction peaks of (110), (200), (102), (211) and (212) crystal planes of BiPO4.31 For BiPO4/g-C3N4 samples, these peaks are intensified with an increasing amount of BiPO4, while the ones belonging to C3N4 gradually decreased. The intensity of the peak decreased which indicated that BiPO4 nanoparticles may be wrapped in the interlayer of g-C3N4 and weaken the force of interlayer stacking, accordingly. In addition, no impurity peaks were observed.

Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the FTIR spectra of BiPO4, pure g-C3N4 and Bi–CN samples. In the case of BiPO4, 1032 cm−1 and 596 cm−1 could be attributed to δ(PO4) and ν(PO4), respectively.32 For g-C3N4, the broad band at 3155 cm−1 is attributed to stretching modes of NH and NH2. The band at 1325 cm−1 corresponds to C(sp2)–N stretching, and the band at 1641 cm−1 assigns to C(sp2)N stretching modes. The 807 cm−1 band is attributed to s-triazine ring vibration modes. The C–NH–C unit is found in melem (1252 and 1325 cm−1).33 It can be clearly seen that the main characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 and BiPO4 all appeared in the Bi–CN photocatalysts.

The existence of BiPO4 in g-C3N4 was visualized by TEM observations, as shown in Fig. 3. g-C3N4 shows a layer structure (Fig. 3a and b), which is consistent with results reported previously. BiPO4 nanoparticles with average size of about 20 nm were well dispersed in the g-C3N4 phase (Fig. 3c). The HRTEM reveals that the fringe spacing of 0.326 nm can be indexed to the (002) crystal planes of g-C3N4 (Fig. 3d), while the lattice spacing of 0.210 nm can be assigned to the (200) facets of BiPO4.

Fig. 4 shows N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the 2 wt% Bi–CN and pure g-C3N4. The 2 wt% Bi–CN and pure g-C3N4 were found to be IV-type isotherms according to the BDDT classification. The hysteresis loops for the 2 wt% Bi–CN and g-C3N4 were similar, which shows the incorporation of BiPO4 did not affect the specific surface area of g-C3N4. The BET surface areas of the 2 wt% Bi–CN and g-C3N4 were 172.9 and 175.7 m2 g−1, respectively (see Table 1). The large surface area can provide more photocatalytic active sites and will be beneficial for photocatalytic application. Meanwhile, the pore size of 2 wt% Bi–CN was calculated as 2.432 nm based on the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, exhibiting a character of mesoporous materials. It has been reported that large pore volume might be beneficial for the catalytic activity, while a small average pore diameter might also be one of the reasons for increasing catalytic activity.34,35

Fig. 5a–f shows the XPS spectra of 2 wt% Bi–CN. Fig. 5a is the XPS survey spectrum of the sample which contains the peaks of Bi 4p, Bi 4d, Bi 4f, Bi 5d, O KLL, O 1s, P 2s, P 2p, N 1s, and C 1s. The peaks at 164.9 eV and 159.6 eV can be assigned to the binding energies of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 (Fig. 5b), which indicates the existence of a trivalent oxidation state for Bi.36 A broad signal peak at about 132.7 eV suggests that the P in the sample exist in the oxidation state of P5+ (Fig. 5c).33 For the O 1s, the peak at 530.9 eV is attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen, while the peak at 532.6 eV is related to adsorbed oxygen (Fig. 5d). The binding energy of 288.2 eV can correspond to the C–N–C coordination in the C 1s (Fig. 5e). In the N 1s spectrum several binding energies can be separated (Fig. 5f). The main signal shows occurrence of C–N–C groups (398.7 eV) and tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups (400.7 eV).37

The absorption range of light plays an important role in photocatalysis, especially for visible light photodegradation of contaminants. Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis DRS of the as-synthesized samples. As can be observed, BiPO4 only can absorb UV light, in the absorbance region from 257 to 368 nm. However, for pure g-C3N4 and Bi–CN samples, strong absorption in the visible region can be seen, in the absorbance region from 371 to 465 nm and Bi–CN samples exhibit absorption edge of 571 nm together with an increased light absorption, which has a significant redshift (ca. 106 nm) compared with g-C3N4. The results indicated that loading of BiPO4 improved its light absorption ability. There are two major reasons to explain this result. Firstly, the interaction of the heterojunction between BiPO4 and g-C3N4 effectively enhances the separation of electron–hole pairs and accounts for the band gap transition of photo-generated electrons and subsequently enhances the absorption in the visible light region.31 Secondly, as there was a colour change of the composites samples, turning from pale yellow to grey, along with an increasing amount of BiPO4 introduced into the g-C3N4 this would also cause enhanced absorbance.38 The band gap of the pure g-C3N4 is estimated to be about 2.7 eV (Fig. 6b). It is noteworthy that the band gap of Bi–CN samples, which is in the range of 2.3 to 2.5 eV due to incorporation different amount of BiPO4, tends to be smaller than that of pure g-C3N4, indicating that the absorption of the Bi–CN samples is shifted to a lower energy region.

Photocatalytic degradation performance of the BiPO4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts
The photocatalytic degradation of gaseous benzene over the BiPO4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 7a. As shown in Fig. 7a, the photocatalytic activities of BiPO4 and g-C3N4 were very low under visible light. The conversion of benzene was only 2% and 11%, respectively. In contrast, Bi–CN samples presented much higher photodegradation activity for benzene under the same conditions. Especially, 73% conversion of benzene was achieved over 2 wt% Bi–CN after 4 h under visible light irradiation. Bi–CN exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of gaseous benzene compared to pure g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation, which is due to its strong absorption in the visible-light region (from 571 to 363 nm) and excellent charge separation characteristics. However, the removal of benzene decreased with increasing amount of BiPO4, which might result from the additional recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the excess amount of BiPO4 particles and decreasing the diffraction intensity assigned to g-C3N4 because the crystal had an important role in photocatalytic oxidation process.39,40

(b) The variation of ln(C/C0) of benzene by different processing routes. (c) Cyclic photodegradation of benzene over 2 wt% Bi–CN under visible light irradiation. (d) PL spectra of g-C3N4 and Bi–CN. 
The photocatalytic reaction followed a pseudo-first-order reaction, and the rate constant of benzene decomposition over 2 wt% Bi–CN, which was estimated to be about 0.316 h−1, was faster than for the other samples (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, the photochemical stability of 2 wt% Bi–CN was tested. As shown in Fig. 7c, the benzene degradation efficiency declines only about 8% after four consecutive runs. Therefore, the as-synthesized BiPO4/g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibits excellent stability in visible light photochemical degradation reactions.
PL spectroscopy is usually utilized to investigate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs during a photocatalytic process.41,42 Fig. 7d shows the PL spectra of g-C3N4 and Bi–CN. The PL spectrum of g-C3N4 shows a strong emission, which indicates the electrons and holes recombine rapidly. By contrast, for Bi–CN photocatalysts, there was weak PL peak observed, indicating that the photogenerated electron–hole pairs recombination was very slow. It is concluded that the heterojunction of BiPO4 and g-C3N4 may act as an active center for decreasing the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, according to the result of the N2 adsorption–desorption, Bi–CN showed a large specific surface area, which means that its surface can provide more photocatalytic active sites.
In situ FTIR study of photodegradation mechanism of benzene
Real-time monitoring of transient events occurring on the catalyst during the reaction and the surface adsorbed species, which were detected by in situ FTIR, will give an important insight into the reaction mechanisms. In this work, a set of IR transmittance spectra are obtained during the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene over 2 wt% Bi–CN (Fig. 8). Prior to light irradiation (t = 0), when benzene reached adsorption equilibrium on the surface of the 2 wt% Bi–CN, strong peaks due to gas-phase benzene appeared at 3090, 3055 and 3047 cm−1, which are assigned to the C–H stretching mode of benzene, respectively43 (Fig. 8a). The band of 1483 cm−1 is associated with CC stretching. The vibrational bands at 1804, 1820, 1951, and 1966 cm−1 are assigned to C–H out-of-plane bending mode44 (Fig. 8c). The bands at 1050, 1038 and 1025 cm−1 could be ascribed to C–H in-plane deformation vibrations43 (Fig. 8d). After reaction, the intensity of bands at 3090, 3055 and 3047 cm−1 decreased significantly with increasing reaction time. After 4 h, most of the benzene had decomposed. Meanwhile, the bands at 2360 and 2342 cm−1 (Fig. 8b) corresponding to CO2 increased as the reaction proceeded, and some new surface species, which appeared at 1109, 949 and 791 cm−1, were evidenced in the FTIR spectra in Fig. 8d. Among them, bands at 1109 cm−1 is assigned to the C–O–C stretching vibration which existed in ester.45 The 949 cm−1 band is assigned to O–H out-of-plane deformation vibration of carboxylic acid, and 791 cm−1 is assigned to C–H deformation vibration of aldehyde.46 On the basis of previous reports and our results, ethyl acetate, carboxylic acid and aldehyde are the intermediate products during the photocatalytic degradation of benzene, CO2 and H2O are produced as the final product.
 Fig. 8  (a–d) Infrared spectra recorded as a function of irradiation time following the photooxidation of toluene over 2 wt% Bi–CN photocatalyst. 
In order to detect the reactive species evolving during a photocatalytic reaction process, such as hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical species, electron spin resonance (ESR) technique is usually used.47 As shown in Fig. 9a, four characteristic peaks of DMPO–OH˙ with intensity 1:2:2:1 can be observed with visible light irradiated aqueous dispersions of 2 wt% Bi–CN. Similarly, the six stronger characteristic peaks of the DMPO–O2˙− adducts are also observed with visible light irradiated methanol dispersions of 2 wt% Bi–CN in Fig. 9b. ESR results indicate that the generation of the OH˙ radical and O2˙− radical species is crucial during the reaction and it is confirmed that both OH˙ and O2˙− radicals are produced on the surface of 2 wt% Bi–CN and OH˙ radicals with strong oxidation capability act as the predominant species.

Based on the above results, a photocatalytic mechanism as shown in Scheme 1 may be proposed. Under visible light irradiation, electrons (e−) are excited from the VB of g-C3N4 and create holes (h+) in the VB. Normally, these charge carriers quickly recombine and only a fraction of electrons can participate in the photocatalytic reaction. However, when g-C3N4 is connected with BiPO4 to form composites, these photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 tend to transfer to BiPO4 particles due to their excellent electronic conductivity, improving to hole–electron separation. The transferred electrons will accumulate on the BiPO4 nanoparticles, presumably as interface-bound exciton pairs, to capture the adsorbed O2 and H2O on g-C3N4 surface to form OH˙ and O2˙−, and then participate in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction. Meanwhile, on the VB of g-C3N4, the high separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is the result in the increase of the number of holes, which could directly enhance the moderate performance of mineralization ability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized BiPO4/g-C3N4 by a hydrothermal method including calcination for efficient photocatalytic degradation of gaseous benzene under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic activities of BiPO4/g-C3N4 on benzene degradation under visible light irradiation increase to about 6.0 times as high compared to those of pure g-C3N4. The significant enhancement on photocatalytic performance was ascribed to strong absorption in visible light and rapid photogenerated electron transfer rate and charge separation efficiency in BiPO4/g-C3N4. Through and in situ FTIR technique, phenol, carboxylic acid and aldehyde were found to be intermediate products, and CO2 and H2O are determined as the final product during the reaction process. Through ESR, OH˙ and O2˙− are examined in the photocatalytic degradation of benzene. Such BiPO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with high photocatalytic performances may provide an alternative for traditional catalysts to address energy conversion, green chemistry, and environmental issues.
Note added after first publication
This article version replaces the version accepted on 6th March 2015, which contained errors in the BET data. In characterization section, the surface area of the samples was determined from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. However, in results and discussions section, the data of surface area was calculated according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda equation. In general, the BJH equation was used to calculate the pore diameter. The surface area, which was calculated according to the BJH equation, was inaccurate. In fact, the BET surface areas of the 2 wt% Bi–CN and g-C3N4 were 172.9 and 175.7 m2 g−1 respectively according to the BET equation.
