    , Accepted 27th March 2023First published on 3rd April 2023AbstractSearching for adaptable, versatile, and highly performing substances or building blocks is the goal of materials science. Owing to their exceptional structural modifiability, capability for supramolecular assembly, distinctive optoelectronic specialty, and superior device performance, various pyridazine-based (PD-based) heteroaromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs), which are embedded with the adjacent sp2-N pair (–NN–/N–N), have attracted increasing attention in the field of organic optoelectronic materials. In particular, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), fluorescence probes, luminescence, chromism, catalysis, and supramolecular assembly have witnessed notable advancements in recent years. This review categorized different molecular species, outlined structural traits, personality traits, and device performance and analyzed connections between those elements, including PD-based polymers, pure organic small molecules, pure organic complexes, and ligand–metal complexes as host materials, thermally active delayed fluorescence materials, electrode materials, chromism materials, fluorescence probes, organic catalysts, and energy materials. The aza-quantity, substituent, regioisomerism, dihydrogen bond, and dual-coordination effect were all summarized and expanded. In addition, the trends, challenges, and future aspects of PD-based HAHs were discussed and prospected.

1. Introduction
Heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) have undergone thorough research and quickly developed as organic optoelectronic materials for various uses,1–6 including optoelectronic devices, sensing, information encryption, catalysis, gas storage, and energy storage. Significant efforts have been made to design and create new HAHs with specific optoelectronic properties to satisfy the aforementioned applications. This has increased the demand for HAH-related structural design, simple and affordable synthesis techniques, and efficient device performance optimization. Hence, a significant variety of HAHs based on various π-conjugated core units, such as six-membered diazines,7–13 acridones,14–17 quinoxalines,18–21 pyrimidines,22,23 triazines,24 and five-membered imidazoles25–27 and pyrroles,28,29 have emerged in the past decades. Among these, π-conjugated pyridazine derivatives (PDs),29–35 a type of HAH with PD-unit(s) in the conjugated skeleton, have drawn great attention because of their distinct properties, relating to the adjacent sp2-N pair, including excellent structural modifiability, unique supramolecular recognition and assembly capability, and potentially excellent optoelectronic properties in devices.36–38 The conductivity of PDs has a long history that dates back to 1969. Hoare and Prat found that organic pyridazine-iodine (PD-I) complex30 had low resistivities ranging from 1 Ω cm to 50 Ω cm measured by the four-probe technique. In 1984, Satoh and collaborators found that the conductivity of doped and undoped polypyridazine (polyPD) (Scheme 1) films synthesized by electrochemical oxidation reached conductivities of 10 S cm−139 and 6 S cm−1, respectively.40 Yang and collaborators reported that the low electronic resistivity of the iodine-doped conjugation-interrupted poly(3-vinylpyridazine) (poly(3-vinylPD) (Scheme 1)) was measured to be 1000–500 Ω cm with the double probe method.41 According to a 1987 study, Kang and collaborators34 reported that the conductivities of PD-I complex approached 2 S cm−1 for PD-I under room-temperature conditions. In 1990, Xi and collaborators42 reported that the measured conductivity of compressed powder of doped polyPD reached 1.56 S cm−1. Similar to the building blocks of pyrimidine and pyrazine with farther sp2-N pairs,7 the electron-deficient PD unit is an outstanding electron-withdrawing unit to construct electron transfer materials with high electron mobilities29,36 and/or electron-push–pull molecular systems with well-separated and balanced electron/hole transfer capabilities.37,43 Particularly, the presence of adjacent N atoms facilitates the generation of pyridazine–chelated (PD–chelated) complexes,44–46 dihydropyridazines (dihydroPDs),47 unique hydrogen bonds, and protonated PDs29,35 to construct new molecular systems for various applications from OLEDs, OFETs, OPVs, and sensing to catalysis. Owing to the outstanding biological features of PDs, such as bactericidal and anticancer actions (antitumor activity), their biological research and application in medical drugs and pesticides are very successful and have been reviewed.48–52 Their progresses on materials have also been reviewed for many years.7,53 To demonstrate the structure–property–performance relationship of PDs, the accompanying principles, applications, challenges, and prospects, this review mainly focused on the classification of versatile PD-based materials and applications (Fig. 1a) in organic field effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and also excellent fluorescence probes/indicators, chromism, catalysis, and energy storage/release.

2. PD-cored optoelectronic materials and their applications
2.1 PDs for OFETs
Electron-deficient and adjacent sp2-N pair-embedded PD-units have strong electron-withdrawing properties and tend to exhibit supramolecular effects with hydrogen, halogen, and coordination bonds, making them promising semiconductors for OFETs. These units aim for the terminal target of versatile and highly performing compounds or star building blocks. Moreover, owing to the rich substituent sites and the well-developed synthetic methods, the PD-unit is utilized as a universal electron-deficient building block to construct charge transfer materials with donor–acceptor (D–A) structures, including pyridazine–thiophene (PD–thiophene) polymers/oligomers and pyridazine–carbazole (PD–carbazole) small molecules via fused cyclization and C–C, C–N, or C–O covalent bonding. Various PD-based organic semiconductors, including small molecules, polymers, and cocrystal charge transfer complexes, have been effectively used as channel semiconductors in OFETs by carefully manipulating the energy levels, charge mobilities, and stacking patterns of PDs with rational molecular design. Scheme 1 and Fig. 2, respectively, depict summaries of the molecular structures of exemplary PD-based channel semiconductors and the hole and/or electron mobilities of associated devices. The energy levels and device performance of the PDs for OFETs are listed in Table 1. The diazine–thiophene oligomer system includes the PD–thiophene derivative PDT-1 (Scheme 1).54 Compared with pyrimidine–thiophene oligomers (PMT-1 and PMT-2), the highest hole mobility in OFET devices of oligomer PDT-1 was determined to be 4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is not only higher than that (1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of oligomers PMT-1 and PMT-2 but also higher than that (3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of PDT-polymer P(PydTh)-6 (Scheme 1).8 A research demonstrated that the PD-cored oligomer PDT-1 had an inherent advantage over the other two V-shaped pyrimidine derivatives owing to the synergy effect of S⋯N interactions and the more linear structure. Liu and collaborators5 found that pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazine (PPD) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit-based copolymer PPPD–DPP (Scheme 1) exhibited the ambipolar charge transfer features with 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.054 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron and hole mobilities, respectively. The highest hole mobility of PPPD–DPP under air conditions reached 0.121 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PD-unit can not only fuse with electron-rich groups but also conjugate with them via single bonds. Electron-rich tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was successfully fused on PD-unit providing T-shaped small molecules T3a and T5b (Scheme 1)6 with mobilities of 4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The pyridazine-fused (PD-fused) thiophene polymers PDTTPTT, PDTTPBT, and PDTTPBDT (Scheme 1) have optical band-gaps ranging from 1.41 eV to 1.58 eV. PDTTPTT36 annealed for 1 h achieved the highest hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. After annealing at a high temperature (200 °C), the hole mobility remains at 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the on/off ratio is still 105. This demonstrates that the PD-unit fused on the thiophene moiety is beneficial to the thermal stability of the polymer with alkyl side chains. The charge transfer capabilities for more star PD-units could be predicted using theoretical models. For example, Wang and collaborators55 predicted the maximum electron and hole mobilities of the large π-extended pyridazino[4,5-d]pyridazine (diPD) derivative TAT (Scheme 1) to be 3.404 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.516 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the crystallographic a-axis, respectively. This indicates that single-crystal TAT is a potential n-type material. Furthermore, it was predicted that the polyhalogenated 4F-TAT, 4Cl-TAT, and polycyanated 4CN-TAT derivatives are potential n-type materials. A unique supramolecular system force-driven by hydrogen bonds can be built using the adjacent sp2-N pair on the PD-unit as hydrogen bonding acceptors. The PD–carbazole-based (DCPi) cocrystal DCPi–TCNQ is coassembled with a 1:2.5 molar ratio of DCPi (Scheme 1), and TCNQ exhibits an electron mobility of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.29 It is located between the values (10−6–10−8, 8.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the other two complexes (1,4-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzene (DCBz)-TCNQ and 2,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)pyrazine (DCPa)-TCNQ), which were formed from donors and acceptors with a molar ratio of 1:2. This suggests that the adjacent sp2-N pair of the PD-unit can be used to control the charge transfer characteristics of organic semiconductor materials and, more crucially, to accomplish functional optimization through supramolecular interactions. For example, dibenzo[c,e]pyridazine (dibenzo[c,e]PD) (BCC) could be used to construct coassembled systems through H⋯N hydrogen35 and C–I⋯N halogen bonds.34,56 Lu and collaborators57 designed and synthesized a series of coronal macrocyclic PDs (OCP-3a, OCP-3b, OCP-3c, OCP-4, and OCP-5) (Scheme 1) for the identification of organic ammonium and dinitrile compounds. The primary supramolecular driving force of the host guest aforementioned was the H⋯N hydrogen bonds originated from the adjacent sp2-N pair on the PD-unit. This represents a significant advance that the coronal macrocyclic structures can be used to identify biological cations.

The adjacent sp2-N pair on the PD-unit promotes the formation of intramolecular dual S⋯N contacts, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and halogen bonds. It favors the optimization of the molecular configuration and increases device performance. For example, with an increase in the number of N atoms in the structures of the benzodithiophene–pyridazine (benzodithiophene–PD) copolymer system (MP0, MP1, and MP2) (Scheme 1),58 the dual supramolecular interactions between PD and thiophene units on both sides of the molecule are strengthened. Consequently, the conformational planarity of the main chain gradually increases (MP0 < MP1 < MP2), resulting in an absorption redshift and a decrease in the optical band-gap from 2.28 to 2.12 eV. Consequently, the conformational planarity of the main chain gradually increased (MP0, MP1, and MP2). The space charge-limited current (SCLC) mobilities of MP0, MP1, and MP2 polymer films improved from 2.33 × 10−6 to 3.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, providing one more clue for the existence of an aza effect on optimizing charge transfer ability by the embedment of adjacent sp2-N pair. Among various organic semiconductor materials, the electron or hole mobilities of the PDs (Fig. 2a) are kept at a comparatively low level. Consequently, systematic optimization must be used to continuously design and validate studies. The π-conjugated units and the macroscopic properties are connected by the aza effect of multiheteroatoms,59 which has clear but not absolute patterns among the π-conjugated backbones owing to their various distances, overlaps, group kinds, and sizes. Li and collaborators60 found that the electron-deficient pyridazinooxadiazole (PCCP5) (Scheme 1) unit contributes the majority of the polymer's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (−5.91 eV/−4.30 eV) lower than that (−5.79 eV/−4.15 eV) of PD-based pyridazinothiadiazole (PCCP3), pyridine-based pyridooxadiazole (PCCP4), and pyridothiadiazole (PCCP2). Theoretically, PCCP5 (Scheme 1) with a pyridazinooxadiazole unit should have an electron mobility of 1.06 cm2 V−1 s−1. PCCP3 with pyridazinothiadiazole demonstrated the lowest mobility of 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is lower than that of PCCP2 with pyridothiadiazole. This provides clue for the potential synergy effect between four sp2-N atoms and a weakly electron-donating O atom. The latter has a distinctive contribution to the LUMO energy levels of pyridazine-containing (PD-containing) polymers in contrast to the former's strong electron-donating S atom.
Leclerc and collaborators61 found that the LUMO energy level (−4.15 eV) of the pyridazinooxadiazole-cored polymer MRC-P1 (Scheme 2) was lower than those (−3.88 eV and −3.99 eV) of MRC-P2 and MRC-P3, respectively. This showed that pyridazinooxadiazole, an electron-withdrawing compound, was very successful in regulating the LUMO energy levels of polymers. This further suggests that the molecular systems containing PD-unit exhibit the aza effect.62 However, compared to the fused oxadiazole system, the fused thiadiazole system has inferior optimization capabilities for energy levels and device performance.

2.2 PDs for OPVs
Through the synergy effect of supramolecular interactions and electronic structures, PD-units have been employed as electron-withdrawing acceptor units to control the energy levels, thermal stability, intermolecular packing modes, and polymeric configuration of OPV materials. The aforementioned pyridazinooxadiazole-based polymer60 not only exhibited obvious advantages in charge transfer ability but also possibly hint at potential advantages to enhance the performance of OPV materials. The structure-property-performance relationship of the polymer with pyridazinooxadiazole (Scheme 2, MRC-P1) clarified by Leclerc and collaborators61 is very important. The change trends of short-circuit current densities (Jsc) and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) (0.47%, 0.37%, and 0.13%) are compatible with those of the LUMO energy levels of MRC-P1, MRC-P3, and MRC-P2 (1.52, 0.86, and 0.55 mA cm−1), respectively. This result reflects the potential optoelectronic properties and device performance of pyridazinooxadiazole-based polymers. In 2011, the empirical correlations discovered by Leclerc and collaborators63,64 in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental information of model compounds allowed for fair estimations of the parameters, such as the HOMO energy level, LUMO energy level, and energy gap (Eg) of polymers. The expected values of the carbazole–pyridazinothiophene copolymers (Scheme 2), including poly-CDTPZOx and poly-CDTPZQx64 (MRC-P1 and MRC-P3),61 as p-type materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, are very close to the experimental data. The energy gaps of pyridazinooxadiazole-based poly-CDTPZOx are smaller than those of pyrazino[2,3-d]pyridazine-based (pyrazino[2,3-d]PD-based) poly-CDTPZQx, indicating the matched electronic structures of the PD-unit and oxadiazole unit. This accomplishment offers a significant and beneficial model for the development and exploration of high-performance PD-based OPV materials. In Scheme 2 and Fig. 2b, respectively, the molecular structures indicative of the PD-based photovoltaic materials and PCEs of the corresponding devices are outlined. The energy levels and device performances of the PDs for the OPV devices are listed in Table 2.

As a typical molecular system, the aforementioned benzodithiophene–PD copolymers (MP0, MP1, and MP2) (Scheme 1)58 show a regular and gradual change in absorption maximum (λmax), absorption onset (λonset), LUMO energy levels, optical band-gaps, and π–π distances as well as improved hole mobility with an increasing amount of N atoms. The PCEs, one of the key parameters of OPV devices prepared with three polymer donors, increased from 0.81% for MP0:PC61BM (1:0.6) and 1.13% for MP1:PC61BM (1:0.7) to 3.22% for MP2:PC71BM (1:0.7). All other parameters, such as the open circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, and fill factor (FF), also demonstrated an upward trend as the number of N atoms grew (aza-quantity effect).58,65 In another case, the copolymers (BT-PPD-1 and BT-PPD-2) with benzodithiophene–pyrrolopyridazine (BT-PPD) core and PBDT–PhBT (Scheme 2)37 provide a model molecule in which the aza effect of adjacent sp2-N pair is a positive strategy for the optimization of OPV device performance. The polymers BT-PPD-1 and BT-PPD-2 containing pyridazine–dicarboxylic (PD–dicarboxylic) imide units show a wider absorption spectrum and a smaller band-gap when compared to the polymer PBDT–PhBT (Scheme 2) containing phthalic imide units without sp2-N atom (1.98 eV vs. 1.70 eV) and deeper LUMO energy level (−3.37 eV vs. −3.60 eV).37 For the BHJ solar cells made by separately coblending BT-PPD-1 and BT-PPD-2 with PC71BM (1:2) as the absorber layers, these maximum Voc values are 0.86 V/0.91 V with an increase of 5.5%. The maximum Jsc values are 5.96 mA cm−2/6.04 mA cm−2 with a slight increase of 1.3%. The PCEs are 2.71%/3.66% with a 25.9%.
A group of azole-fused DTDCTBs (Scheme 2)66 could be used as typical models for the clarification of the aza effect in terms of regioisomerism, number of sp2-N atoms, and multiple heteroatoms. Wang and collaborators66 carried out a systematic theoretical calculation of DTDCTB-3/-12/-16/-24/-25/-27 (Scheme 2) containing electron-deficient PD-units and DTDCTB-5 and -19 containing electron-deficient diazole-fused units by DFT and time-dependent density functional calculations. The calculations revealed that only the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTDCTB-3, -5, -16, and -19 matched those of PC61BM when compared to the original small molecule DTDCTB without a PD-unit. The predicted Voc (1.01 V and 1.15 V) and ΔE (0.54 and 0.40 eV) of devices with PD-based DTDCTB-3 and -16 are more favorable than that (0.80 V and 0.84 V; 0.58 eV and 0.61 eV) of the thiadiazole- and oxadiazole-based DTDCTB-5 and DTDCTB-19. The comparison of DTDCTB-3 vs. DTDCTB-19 and DTDCTB-3 vs. DTDCTB-16 provided one more molecular system with the trend that not only the more sp2-N atoms on the electron-withdrawing groups, the better performance of OPV devices, but also the priority of pyridazinooxadiazole-based polymers60,61 to DTDCTB-2466 and poly-CDTPZQx.64
However, when polymers containing PD-fused triazole (m-PrzTAZ) (Scheme 2)67 and polymers (m-FTAZ, m-PyCNTAZ, and m-CNTAZ) containing difluorobenzene ring-, cyanopyridine ring-, and dicyanobenzene ring-fused triazoles were separately blended with PC61BM, the corresponding performance parameters (including Jsc, FF, and PCE) of the OPV devices (Fig. 3) were at low levels of m-PrzTAZ, except for its higher Voc (0.955 ± 0.010 V) than that (0.853 ± 0.004 V) of m-FTAZ. This situation may be due to the complicated synergy effect of the mismatched HOMO/LUMO energy levels similar to DTDCTB-27,66 the shortwave absorption region, the lowest molecular weight, and the lowest SCLC hole mobility.

Additionally, the PD-based copolymer PPD-BDT (Scheme 2),68 with different alkyl chains from BT-PPD-2,37 displayed an optical band-gap of 1.8 eV and good processability in chlorobenzene solution. In the organic solar cell with PPD-BDT and fullerene derivative as the absorber layer, the Jsc and PCE reached 8.0 mA cm−2 and 4.5%, respectively. Using PPD-BDT/CuInS2 (CIS) nanocrystals as the light-absorbing layer, the Jsc of the hybrid solar cell reaches 8.8 mA cm−2, one of the top parameters of the corresponding OPV devices using PD-based polymers. Barnes and colleagues69 discovered that the micro/nanomorphology of extended PDs may significantly affect the performance of photovoltaic devices in term of highly variable emission spectra. Molecular packing defects from the fast pillar growth of TAT (Scheme 1)55,69 single crystal likely resulted in a strong NIR emission band centered at 800 nm (Fig. 4a).

2.3 PDs for OLEDs
Structural characteristics, such as steric hindrance, electron deficiency, and coordination of adjacent sp2-N pair, enable PD-units to act as different components in OLED devices. PD-units, for example, have been used as ligands to coordinate with Ir, Pt, and other precious metal ions to create phosphorescent emitters for OLEDs, which emit blue light, red light, and near-infrared (NIR) light.70–72 PD-units can also be combined with –BF2– to construct pure organic complex-based blue fluorescent emitters,73,74 or with arylamine groups to construct phosphorescent host materials75,76 and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminescent materials.77,78Scheme 3 and Fig. 2c, respectively, provide a summary of the molecular structures typical of PD-based hosts, emissive materials, and EQEs of related devices. The energy levels and device performance of the PDs for the OLED devices are listed in Table 3.

The planarity of π-conjugated systems,79 electron-withdrawing capability, substituent quantities,70 and ligands with various amounts and structures of PD-based complexes played key role in optimizing the performance of OLED devices. An orange light OLED device (560 nm) with a homoleptic Ir complex (IrNzPPya) (Scheme 3)79 as the dopant emitter containing pyridazine–chelated ligands (PD–ligands) presented excellent device efficiencies (70.8 cd A−1, 75.4 lm W−1, and 30.8%). However, the overall performance of another homoleptic Ir complex (IrCzPPya)-based OLED device was relatively poor (46.1 cd A−1, 40.1 lm W−1, and 22.6%). In addition, white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with a single emission layer (EML) composed of IrNzPPya and a blue emitter FIrpic exhibited excellent device efficiencies (49.9 cd A−1, 55.9 lm W−1, and 23.9%) and one of the best white light CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.46). Compared to Ir(BFPPya)3 (Scheme 3) with fewer F substitutions and Ir(BPPya)3 without F substitutions, Ir(BDFPPya)3 with more F substitutions70 has the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 84%, the most blueshifted electroluminescence (500 nm), and the lowest thermal decomposition temperature (Td) (402 °C). The corresponding efficiencies of Ir(BPPya)3 without F substitutions are still at low levels (30.2 cd A−1, 31.8 lm W−1, and 11.2%). The effective experience related to the WOLED of homoleptic Ir complex IrNzPPya with excellent performance79 provides a valuable alternative to solve the mismatch of high PLQY and low device performance of the polyfluorinated homoleptic Ir complex Ir(BDFPPya).70 In another set of Ir homo-/heteroleptic complex systems with multiple F substitutions,80 the performance of OLED devices prepared with heteroleptic Ir(mdfppya)2pic (Scheme 3) exhibited the highest efficiencies (41.0 cd A−1, 33.9 lm W−1, and 11.62%) compared to those of the other two. Ning and collaborators46 have improved the EQEmax of phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) (Fig. 2c) with (fpdz)2Irpic (Scheme 3) as green emitter to the top level of 28.7% with excellent stability, which is superior to the EQEmax of 23.1%, 22.7%, and 24.5% of PhOLEDs (Fig. 2c) with (fpdz)2Irtaz, (fpdz)2Iracac, and (fpdz)2Irtmd, as emitters (Scheme 3), respectively. By utilizing a doping concentration adjustment approach, suitable PD-based ancillary ligands with well-matched energy levels are beneficial for increasing device efficiency. Wang and collaborators81 studied the performance of OLED devices with ICA-2 (Scheme 3) and ICA-4 from the perspective of steric hindrance. At a doping concentration of 2.5%, the comparison revealed that the device efficiencies of ICA-4 reached 50.5 cd A−1 and 14.9%, which are better than those of ICA-2 (41.7 cd A−1 and 10.5%). Under high lumens of 60000 cd m−2, the device efficiency of ICA-4 rolled off by 64%, which is lower than that of ICA-2 (70%), indicating that the steric hindrance of the bridge ring could effectively inhibit the intermolecular interaction of ICA-4. This is consistent with the dominant steric hindrance of IrNzPPya-based OLED devices79 prior to that of IrCzPPya.
Diphenylpyridazine-based (diphenylPD-based) homoleptic Ir complexes (Ir(PDPh)3, Ir(FHPDPh)3, Ir(HFPDPh)3, and Ir(FPDPh)3) (Scheme 3), developed by Tong and collaborators,82 were doped into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films at a concentration of 0.01 wt% releasing green or yellowish green phosphorescence emission in a relatively high PLQY range of 64–76%. Using 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) as the host, Ir(HFPDPh)3-based electroluminescent devices presented a maximum luminescence efficiency of 64.1 cd A−1 and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.2% at a high doping concentration of 15 wt%. Simultaneously, when the complex was solely used as the light-emitting layer, the Ir(HFPDPh)3-based undoped green electroluminescent device gave an EQE as high as 15.2% (40.1 cd A−1) with CIE coordinates of (0.346, 0.599). The intermolecular aggregation was inhibited by the bridge ring and –CF3's steric hindrance in favor of the high device efficiencies under high doping concentrations. The device with non-CF3-substituted Ir(PDPh)382 (OE-1, Scheme 3)33 as the dopant phosphor gave 17.7% EQE and a high-efficiency roll-off value of 37.3%. Herein, one more molecular system suggests that the performance of electroluminescent devices of Ir complex phosphors is influenced by the aza effect and the steric hindrance effect.79,81,82 After structural optimization with electron-donating groups based on Ir(HFPDPh)3, the green device with OE-4 (Scheme 3)33 as the dopant phosphor gave an EQEmax as high as 21.9% and a maximum current efficiency (CEmax) of 78.6 cd A−1. These parameters are comparable to those of Ir(HFPDPh)3-doped (15%) devices82 and better than those of methyl-containing OE-2 and OE-3-based devices,33 indicating the potential inadequacy of steric methylated phenyls on optimizing device performance. In addition, they developed another group of regioisomeric homoleptic Ir complexes (Ir-1, Ir-2, and Ir-3 (Scheme 3)) containing disordered thieno[2,3-d] rings,31 representing regioisomerism. The device with Ir1 as the dopant phosphor gave obviously better performance parameters. The CEmax, PEmax, EQEmax, turn-on voltage, and maximum luminescence (58.5 cd A−1, 45.9 lm W−1, 18.2%, 3.1 V, and 18290 cd m−2) are higher than that (42.1 cd A−1, 29.0 lm W−1, 13.1%, 3.2 V, and 16170 cd m−2)31 of commercially available Ir(III) bis[2-(thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-4-yl)phenyl]acetylacetonate (PO-01) under the same device condition. The homoleptic structure of the Ir1 complex containing regioisomeric thieno[2,3-d]pyridazine (thieno[2,3-d]PD) has a synergistic influence on competitive performance. The influence of the steric hindrance effect is expected from the control experiment between Ir1 and the minor product as the dopant phosphors of OLEDs.
Beside of that, there are some PD-based Ir complex guest emitters with exceptional OLED device performance. For example, homoleptic Ir complexes [Ir(dpbpa)2(Bphen)]+PF6− and [Ir(dtbpa)2(Bphen)]+PF6− (Scheme 3 and Fig. 4c)83 containing benzo[g]phthalazine (dpbpa) units exhibited maximum emission peaks appearing at 715 and 775 nm, respectively, and obvious redshifts compared to the smaller π-conjugated benzo[g]quinoline-based complexes.84 PhOLEDs were prepared by doping a PD-based Ir complex into the mixed host poly(N-vinyl)carbazole (PVK)–2-(4-biphenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) (30%) with a concentration range of 10–20%, and EQE attenuation was maintained at approximately 0.5% within a wide current density range of 1–100 mA cm−2. The results of theoretical calculations using DFT and TD-DFT revealed that the structures of [Ir(dpbpa)2(Bphen)]+PF6− and [Ir(dtbpa)2(Bphen)]+PF6− have stronger Ir–N bonds (2.06 Å and 2.07 Å) than previous benzo[g]quinoline-based complexes.84 The LUMO energy level occupied the benzo[g]phthalazine unit with a higher electron accepting capability and reduced steric congestion, which is favorable for improving the phosphorescence emission of the complexes.
The PLQYs of two types of NIR Ir homogenous Ir(dtbpa)3 and Ir(Ftbpa)3 (Scheme 3 and Fig. 4b)72 were measured as high as 5.2% and 17.3% at 824 nm and 765 nm, respectively. The introduction of the –CF3 group into Ir(Ftbpa)3 improved the thermal stability and sublimation ability. The EQE of the NIR organic light-emitting diode (NIR-OLED) devices could reach 4.5% at 760 nm. With the benefit of low-cost, the increase in the molecular weight of the PD-based π-conjugated group also successfully decreased the precious metal content percentage (about 10% Ir). Improving the NIR phosphorescence of the Ir complex through ligand optimization has provided a new strategy for the future development of practical PD-based NIR emitters for NIR-OLEDs with high efficiency, low roll-off, and low cost. There is still a long way to go before pure organic NIR emitters could match the performance of metal complexes.
In 2015, Ye and collaborators85 systematically investigated three commercially available phosphors (FIrpic, Ir(ppy)2(acac), and Ir(bt)2(acac)) and the homemade Ir(MPCPPZ)3 (Scheme 3) red phosphor for the preparation of two-, three-, and four-component single-emitting layer WOLEDs with PVK as the main component. Among them, the CEmax of the two-component WOLED (25.5 cd A−1) is similar to that of the four-component WOLED (24.0 cd A−1), and the color rendering indexes (CRIs) of the three-component and four-component WOLEDs are close (82.4 and 82); the correlated color temperature (CCT) of the two-component WOLED is higher than that of the three-component WOLED (4400 > 3700–2800). The four-component WOLED had the highest EQE (11.5%) and maximum luminance (43569.9 cd m−2). This study provides a valuable PD-based complex and application strategy for polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) lighting research.
PD-based ligands can be used to construct not only Ir complex phosphorescent emitters but also Pt complex materials with red and NIR light emissions. Zhukovskaya and collaborators86 found that the phosphorescence emission could redshift to the NIR region (Fig. 4d). The methyl group of PDPtT2 (Scheme 3) resulted in three blueshifted emission peaks by 10 nm compared to that of PDPtT1. Thienyl substitution of PDPtT1 and PDPtT2 is decisive in the NIR emission of PDPtT1 and PDPtT2 compared to the phenyl substitution of PDs with higher energy emission.87 This group of dithiophene-pyridazinyl dinuclear Pt(II) complexes provides a new type of candidate NIR emissive material for PhOLEDs.
Furthermore, pure organic PD-BF2-complex fluorescent compounds can be made using PD-units. The PD-BF2 complexes (PDDPTPA, PDBPTP, and PDPTP) (Scheme 3)73 emitted blue fluorescence with the high quantum efficiency (25%, 52%, and 79%, respectively) excited at 375 nm. Yamaji and collaborators74 synthesized three PD-BF2 complexes 2-Py@BA, 2,3-Py@BA, and 2,5-Py@BA (Scheme 3) with various PLQYs of 66%, 18%, and 16% in the solid state, respectively. The fluorescence characteristics of the above two molecular systems indicate that the blue emissive PD-BF2-complexes are a kind of potential wide band-gap organic materials.
Arylamine–pyridazines (arylamine–PDs) have also been used as host materials for electrophosphorescent devices. DCMP (Scheme 3) with larger π-conjugation and weaker structural symmetry, as hosts for PhOLEDs, performed somewhat better device performance of green PhOLEDs and red PhOLEDs, including CEmax (72.5 cd A−1/37.0 cd A−1), maximum power efficiency (PEmax) (52.5 lm W−1/28.2 lm W−1), and EQEmax (22.2%/20.0%) than that (63.9 cd A−1/28.4 cd A−1; 47.2 lm W−1/24.1 lm W−1, 19.5%/15.3%) of DAMP (Scheme 3, Table 3).4 Interestingly, DCMP with two larger π-conjugated and asymmetric end-caped groups possesses a higher thermal Td of 425 °C than 384 °C of DAMP. However, it is unable to reveal the influence of the molecular packing mode owing to the lack of a crystal structure. Although the molecular size and weight of the polycarbazole-substituted 4CzPyPyaPy (Scheme 3) are greater than those of 3CzPyaPy, its Td of 418 °C is not as high as 3CzPyaPy's Td of 436 °C,75 which may be partly due to the stronger asymmetric structure of the polar molecule 3CzPyaPy with dimer-like packing in favor of HOMO dispersion.88,89 The CEmax, PEmax, and EQEmax of the green phosphorescent device with 3CzPyaPy as the phosphor host material and Ir(ppy)3 as the luminescent material reached 54.0 cd A−1, 42.4 lm W−1, and 17.7%, respectively. The dipolar host materials (CzPd and PCzPd) (Scheme 3)76 have high triplet state energies of 2.70 eV and 2.71 eV, respectively. Compared to the PCzPd host with a large size and pyrrolocarbazole unit, the PD-based CzPd host with a smaller size has a stronger ability to balance holes and electrons in the emitting layer. The EQEs of green PhOLEDs containing CzPd and PCzPd as the hosts and Ir(ppy)3 as the luminescent material reached 15.5% and 10.6%, respectively. Song and collaborators47 explored four imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine (imidazo[1,2-b]PD) derivatives (Scheme 3) as the n-type unit of bipolar host materials with complicated substituent effect and steric hindrance effect rather than substituent-quantity effect or regioisomerism. They also found that the red PhOLEDs with IP6Cz (Scheme 3) as the hosts displayed an extremely high EQEmax of 26.9% owing to the contact of adjacent imidazo[1,2-b]PD units. IP68Cz possesses better applicable potential because of a slightly lower EQEmax (25.2%) of related PhOLEDs but a higher Tg (158 °C) than that (26.9%, 91 °C) of IP6Cz.
One of the most important research strategies for developing TADF materials is the modification of push–pull electrons and substitution sites. The balance between push–pull electron groups and the optimization of the energy level distribution of the frontier orbital by the substitution site resulted in the smallest singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔEST) for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), thus improving EQE. The combination of electron-donating groups and PD-units significantly affects the properties of TADF emitters. Samuel and collaborators77 designed and synthesized a set of host molecules (dPXZMePydz, dDMACMePydz, and dCzMePydz) (Scheme 3) with electron-withdrawing PD-units. Among them, only dPXZMePydz exhibited TADF features, showing an RISC rate and the highest PLQY up to 3.9 × 106 s−1 and 8.5%, respectively. It is theoretically corroborated that ΔEST is only 86 meV, indicating that phenoxazine–pyridazines (phenoxazine–PDs) with push–pull electronic characteristics are a type of potential TADF material reported by another group of PDs (DDH-1, DDH-2, DDH-3, DDH-4, and DDH-5) (Scheme 3).78 The ΔEST values of DDH-1, DDH-2, DDH-3, and DDH-4 were in the range of 120–500 meV. Among them, the regio-isomers (DDH-2 and DDH-5), which are both phenoxazine-PDs but with different C–N substitution sites, exhibit different ΔEST values (220 meV and 90 meV) under the same test conditions, indicating the TADF characteristics of DDH-5 with the highest EQE of 5.9% in OLED devices, compared to 2.52% of DDH-2. Consequently, the creation of high-performance TADF materials benefits from PD-based regioisomerism.
Together with TADF characteristics, PD-based luminous materials also have two-photon and nonlinear optical properties. Fan and collaborators90 synthesized two PD-based HAHs (DPPA and TPPA) (Scheme 3). In the single crystal of TPPA, the twisted dihedral angle between pyrene and PD-units reaches 27°, tending to suppress the π–π stacking of π-conjugated molecules.15,91 Bi(diphenylpyridazine)-fused (bi(diphenylPD)-fused) pyrene (TPPA) has greater advantages in terms of the two-photon absorbance coefficient and cross section related to a synergy effect of the larger but twisted structure, more N atoms, and structural symmetry than DPPA.
Achelle and collaborators92 obtained a series of triphenylamine–diazine–thienocyclopentanedione derivatives (D–π–A–NLO (Scheme 3)) with good nonlinear optical features. Among them, PD-based NLO-1a/-1b/-1c was compared with N-free phenyl-based NLO-3a/-3b/-3c. It was found that the PD-based NLO-1a/-1b/-1c had lower electrochemical HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The vinyl group in the embedded structure near the triphenylamine has the most obvious influence on the HOMO energy levels of the PD-based NLO-1c, varying from −5.40 eV to −5.24 eV, hinting the existence of the aza effect. The μ of PD-based NLO-1a/-1b/-1c spread in the range of 4.14–5.33 D, which is greater than that of benzene-based NLO-3a/-3b/-3c. The first hyperpolarizability β × 10−30 of NLO-1a/-1b/-1c is 3113–6401 esu, which is also higher than that of N-free NLO-3a/-3b/-3c (2031–4890 esu). This further demonstrates the importance of the aza effect in the development of high-performance organic NLO materials.
2.4 PDs for chromism
PDs can not only be used to construct charge transfer materials, host materials of PhOLEDs, and luminescent materials but can also be used to construct electrochromic and acidochromic materials owing to their strong influence of remarkable electronic structures with alternative sp2-/sp3-N atoms, competitive electron push–pull abilities, and steric conformation, followed by the appearance of acidochromism, electrochromism, and chemochromism.

2.4.1 PDs for electrochromism. 
PD–thiophene-based polymers with typical electron push–pull structures could possess not only certain charge transfer characteristics but also electrochromism.8 Xu and collaborators93,94 explored PD–thiophene-based polymers from electron acceptor frameworks (PPD and benzopyrrolopyridazine (benzoPPD) (Scheme 4)) with improved solubility and higher electron push–pull ability than P(PydTh)-12 with a band-gap of 2.38 eV.8 The optical band-gap (1.69–1.77 eV) of the PPD system (OL-P1, OL-P2, and OL-P3 (Scheme 4))93 was similar to that of the benzoPPD system (PC-P1, PC-P2, and PC-P3 (Scheme 4))94 in the range of 1.72–1.78 eV. The PPD system has good optical contrast by purple and transparent blue (Fig. 5), where the best optical contrast of OL-P1 at 540 nm and 1350 nm reached 34.1% and 54.2%, respectively. The optical contrast of PC-P1, PC-P2, and PC-P3 in the visible and NIR regions reached 34% and 71%, respectively. Among these polymers, the coloration efficiencies of OL-P1 were 436 and 457 cm2 C−1 in the visible and NIR regions at 542 and 1350 nm, respectively, while PC-P2 had higher coloration efficiencies of 471 and 651 cm2 C−1, respectively. This indicates that the polyaromatic benzoPPD system has the potential to construct D–A-type electrochromic materials.

2.4.2 PDs for acidochromism. 
Taking advantage of the trend that sp2-N atoms are easily protonated by strong acids, PDs have received more attention and research in acid response.95–97 Li and collaborators95 obtained a tetramethoxyphenylpyridazine (tetramethoxyphenylPD) derivative (TPP) (Scheme 4), which has excellent acid-induced fluorescence emission enhancement from 0.46% to 11.12% and acid-induced fluorescence chromism (Fig. 6a) from blue (406 nm) to orange-red (630 nm). TPP, as the active ingredient, can be used to prepare a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) sensor95 with high sensitivity and reversibility. Moreover, the solid film95 composed of TPP and a photoacid generator can be used for data encryption and decryption. In addition, in a series of diazine derivatives synthesized by Tang and collaborators,96 different from the luminescent characteristics of pyrimidine- and pyrazine-based TPE derivatives, two PDs (PYD–TPE and PTZ–TPE) (Scheme 4) exhibited a relatively weak aggregation-induced emission effect. PYD–TPE and PTZ–TPE are sensitive to strong acid, exhibiting reversible acidochromism (Fig. 6b)96 similar to TPP.95 In addition, CzPyr-OMe97 and CzPyr-H29,97 (Scheme 4) achieved highly sensitive detection for volatile acid (TFA), excellent switch responsiveness at various pH values, and encryption inks (Fig. 6c). These developments demonstrate the excellent acidochromism,95–97 electrochromism,93,94 and regioisomerism96 nature of D–A-type PDs. In addition, Zhang and collaborators10 found that some acidic thiols could also be detected by macrocyclic PDs, named expanded rosarin 1 and semi-rosarinogen 2 (Scheme 5), giving obvious but different color changes (Fig. 6d and e). Air-stable semi-rosarinogen 2 displayed a more pronounced color shift when treated with dithiols and aliphatic thiols than with expanded rosarin 1 in the solvents of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). From the perspective of the various acidities of thiols treated with expanded rosarin 1 and semi-rosarinogen 2, various response times and color changes appeared.

2.4.3 PDs for chemochromism. 
PDs often exhibit strong fluorescent characteristics and are highly sensitive to external chemical stimuli. Obvious fluorescence/phosphorescence or color changes revealed the presence of chemically/biologically active objects (diphenol, nitric oxide (NO), and cysteine (Cys)), cells, ions, and types of chemical reactions. In 2012, Dong and collaborators98 found that a chemiluminescent system Ir(MPCPPZ)3 (Scheme 5) comprising a cyclometalated Ir(III) complex, potassium permanganate, and oxalic acid can be used to determine different water samples of hydroquinone. In 2017, Bozdemir and coworkers99 obtained dibenzodipentenone derivatives (TL4 and TL5 (Scheme 5)) containing dihydroPDs with easily removable acidic protons, which can be employed as extremely sensitive and selective fluorescent chemosensors for F-ion detection. Panigati and collaborators100 designed and synthesized four new glycosylated luminophores (G3-Re, G4-Re, G5-Re, and G6-Re (Scheme 5)) based on the dinuclear Re complex. The sugar residue was covalently bound to the PD–ligand at the β-position. They discovered that the complex displayed intriguing bioimaging characteristics in human cervical adenocarcinoma cells, which are shown to be highly effective phosphorescent probes suitable for cellular imaging applications, including high cell permeability, organelle selectivity, low cytotoxicity, and rapid internalization. In 2019, Panigati and collaborators101 synthesized three new luminescent PDs containing a dinuclear Re complex and estradiol, namely, E2-Re2 (Scheme 5). E2-Re2 exhibits staining differences when treated with human MCF-7 and 231 cells. Combined with the good uptake ability and low cytotoxicity, it can be used as a probe for imaging applications in living cells. You and collaborators102 synthesized quaternized PD-cored 5,6-phenanthroliniums (PD+). Among them, 5,7-diaryl-5,6-phenanthroliniums (ArPD+, Scheme 5) showed a strongly redshifted emission range of 572–742 nm and a higher quantum yield of 41%. The diarylation products (ArPD+-5k and ArPD+-5r) exhibit far-red to NIR fluorescence emission range (Fig. 4e and f) of 678–742 nm with excellent photostability and low cytotoxicity in favor of potential mitochondrial-targeting reagents. This indicates that the quaternization strategy for PDs is advantageous for long-wave emissive materials with good biocompatibility. In 2020, Wang and collaborators103 synthesized the pyridazine–perylene (PD–perylene) fluorescence probe molecule PAPC (Scheme 5), which can be used for the highly selective detection of Cys. The PAPC solution with strong blue light emission in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) can emit 605 nm light when Cys was added, with high sensitivity for a detection limit of 0.19 μM and a wide linear detection range of 1–120 μM. The probe has been successfully used to detect Cys in real samples, such as urine and HeLa cells. These developments suggest that PDs are uniquely advantageous in terms of light and color response and that they can be optimized for the detection of organic acids in biological systems. Li and collaborators104 reported a PD-based fluorescent indicator (p-Nus) (Scheme 5) for the successful detection of NO (Fig. 7), which was transformed from the fluorescence probe (Ratio Tr). There was a fluorescence enhancement of up to 20-fold when p-Nus was treated with natural DNA, while there was only 2.5-fold fluorescence enhancement when the isomeric o-Nus met with natural DNA. Therefore, PD-based p-Nus possesses great potential as a nucleic acid stain or a green probe for the nucleus. Yang and collaborators105 reported a series of PD-based fluorescence probes (NO-PRs) (Scheme 5). In comparison with the “gold standard” commercial probe (diaminofluorescein-based DAF-FM), NO530, one of the NO-PRs, exhibits similar or better sensitivity and higher selectivity to NO. Qu and collaborators106 prepared seven new push–pull tetrazine molecules that can undergo inverse electron demand Diels–Alder (iEDDA) reaction with cyclooctene, accompanied by fluorescence turn-on hinting at the formation of PDs. Thereafter, PDs with high quantum efficiencies can be used as fluorescent indicators for the iEDDA reaction process. Two of these, DA3 and DA6 (Scheme 5), exhibited obvious room-temperature phosphorescence.

2.5 PDs for catalysis and energy storage/release
The direct oxidation of organic molecules by O2 often requires more complicated reaction conditions.107–109 It is very valuable for simple, controllable, highly efficient, and highly selective organic catalytic oxidation. In 2018, Stone and collaborators110 reported that an organic catalytic oxidation strategy based on BCC–O2 (Scheme 6) can oxidize alkyl halides to aldehydes after a series of processes, such as azo salinization, 1,3-prototropic shift and hydrolysis. The hydrazine derivative generated in this process can be oxidized to BCC by O2 simultaneously. It is suited to substrates with twenty three different push–pull electron groups, such as phenyl chloride/methyl bromide and 1,3,5-tribromobenzene/methyl chloride. This indicates that the redox properties of the PDs of the adjacent sp2-N pair111–113 are crucial in organocatalyzed oxidation.

Turro group45 used their synthesized BCC-based dinuclear Rh complex (NC-1) (Scheme 6) as a self-sensitized photocatalyst under acidic conditions for red light or NIR light photocatalytic hydrogen production. In particular, adjacent sp2-N pair both attended the chelation. The greatest wavelength absorption peak for this complex is at 624 nm, and the absorption edge extends to 800 nm. This complex exhibits considerable absorption in the visible and NIR ranges. The highest TON (turnover number) value of 170 ± 5 was achieved after 24 h of irradiation with a 670 nm red light. Analogous complex CS-1114 (Scheme 6) exhibits a hydrogen TON value of 250 after 24 h of red light irradiation at 655 nm. The two four-membered metallocycles contained in the coordination structures of both NC-1 and CS-1 are formed by the coordination of two BCC ligands with a total of four sp2-N and dinuclear metal ions. They also obtained tetraester-based dinuclear Rh complexes (JACS-1 and JACS-2)115 (Scheme 6) and used them to produce hydrogen in photoelectrochemical cells. Although the maximum absorption wavelength of JACS-1 was blueshifted to 605 nm compared with that of NC-1 and CS-1, the absorption could still reach 800 nm. The 1-NiO thin-film photocathode, which was prepared using JACS-1 as both a dye sensitizer (for charge injection into the semiconductor NiO) and a catalyst, produced a photocurrent of 52 μA cm−2 in the presence of 655 nm red light (53 mW cm−2) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.1 mol L−1) under the potential of 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The Faraday efficiency of hydrogen production can reach 85 ± 5% after 2.5 h. The above reports indicate that PDs are useful in the construction of new photocatalysts. In addition to oxidative catalysis and photocatalysis, PDs have also been explored as unsymmetrical organocatalysts. Hennecke and collaborators9 found that several kinds of unfunctionalized alkenes could be enantioselectively dichlorinated in the presence of cinchona-alkaloid and benzopyridazine-based (benzoPD-based) derivatives, especially for DPR-1a and DPR-2a.
Additionally, Ma and collaborators116 developed a set of PD-conjugated microporous polymers (PD-CMPs) that can be employed for Li+ storage/release and had band-gaps of 2.57, 2.36, and 1.63 eV by combining BCC with benzene, pyrene, and benzothiadiazole units. Among them, the polymer (AzoBT, Scheme 6) comprising BCC and benzothiophene diazole frameworks delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1543 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. It demonstrated an outstanding rate performance of 366 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 and exhibited a stable cycling performance of 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1. This suggests that π-conjugated microporous polymers with PD units could be used as Li+ storage/release materials. In addition, nitro-substituted iminotriazolo[4,5-d]pyridazines (iminotriazolo[4,5-d]PDs), iminotriazolodihydropyridazines (iminotriazolodihydroPDs),117 and tetrazolo[1,5-b]dihydropyridazines (tetrazolo[1,5-b]dihydroPDs)118–120 (Scheme 6) are potentially useful energetic materials. Shreeve and collaborators117 developed a group of nitroimino-containing triazolo[4,5-d]dihydropyridazines (triazolo[4,5-d]dihydroPDs) (CEJ-5) and triazolo[4,5-d]pyridazines (triazolo[4,5-d]PDs) (CEJ-6, CEJ-7, and CEJ-8) with good detonation velocities (8875–9351 m s−1) and detonation pressures (31–37.4 GPa) that provides a new design strategy for next generation high energy density explosives. They also obtained tetrazolo[1,5-b]dihydroPD (Scheme 6 and Fig. 8a) containing both -NO2 and -N3 groups with a detonation velocity and pressure of 8746 m s−1 and 31.5 GPa, respectively, which were superior to those of the commercial groups.118 Zhang and collaborators119,120 explored several tetrazolo[1,5-b]dihydroPD-cored multipurpose energetic materials (CC-1, CC-2, EMF-4, EMF-9, and EMF-12) with high-level detonation velocities in the range of 8809–9021 m s−1 and detonation pressures in the range of 28.7–34.8 GPa. Among them, the detonation velocities (9351 and 9307 m s−1) of CEJ-7 and CEJ-8 are comparable to those of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (HMX).121 Theoretically, EJOC-8 (Scheme 6), developed by Klapötke and collaborators13 with two nitro and two amino groups, was projected to have a comparable detonation velocity of 8486 m s−1. This indicates that N-rich HAHs, here for multiaza-ring-fused PDs embedded with large π-conjugation and adjacent N-chains, can be regarded as a molecular library for promising booster, heat-resistant, or heat-resistant explosives. The energy release of these N-rich explosives is usually accompanied by the instant removal of adjacent sp2-N pair as N2 gas. Moreover, the adjacent sp2-N pair of the tetrazine analog has been proven to be an effective leaving group, giving various PDs based on cycloaddition,106 which could be regarded as a kind of certain reaction-directing groups.32 The naked PD molecule has been used to construct a kind of polyPD-cored nanothreads (Fig. 8c)32via selective [4+2] cycloaddition under high-pressure conditions over 13–19 GPa with the formation of sp3-C. The newly formed extended crystalline polymers are stable at room temperature.

3. Synthetic strategy and electronic structures
With many great achievements in the past decades, there are mainly two typical synthetic strategies (strategies I and II, Scheme 7) in the construction of PDs, including the cyclization of pyridazine-ring (PD-ring) (strategy I) and the modification of PD-ring (strategy II) from various precursory chemicals. On the one hand, the cyclization of PD-ring (strategy I) could be achieved by several methods, such as the Schiff-base condensation between hydrazine and diketones122/anhydrides73/aromatic ortho-diesters,6 oxidative N–N coupling cyclization between hydroxylamine and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4),123 or t-BuOCl and aromatic diamines,78 Diels–Alder cycloaddition between tetrazines and substituted acetylenes124–126 or ethylenes,57,127 [3+n] cycloaddition from azomethine ylides,128 diazo-based cycloaddition48,104 or quarternizative cyclization,102 and photoactivation of pyridazine-N-Oxides (PD-N-Oxides).129 On the other hand, the modification of PD-ring (strategy II) could be achieved by a huge number of C–C or C–N coupling or cyclization methods, including Suzuki reaction, Stille reaction, nucleophilic substitution, Sonogashira reaction, Aldol condensation, C–H activated direct arylation, Minisci reaction, Ullmann reaction, Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, and aroylation via wet chemistry, thermochemistry, photochemistry, and/or electrochemistry, which have been significantly investigated and/or summarized.53,104,130
 Scheme 7  Synthetic strategies for PDs: cyclization of PD-rings (strategy I) and modification of PD-rings (strategy II). 
Ritchie and collaborators131 found that the replacement of –CH by –N (Fig. 1c) resulted in a slightly suppressed electron delocalization132 and gave the aromaticity in sequence by benzene > pyridine ≈ PD ≈ pyrazine > pyrimidine > s-triazine based on magnetisability. More specifically, in 2007, Solà reported that PD possesses prior aromaticity with the highest multicenter indices (MCI, Iring) of 0.044/0.0304 than 0.042/0.042 and 0.0304/0.0291 of pyrimidine/pyrazine, respectively, calculated at CCSD/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory.133 By comparing the ionization ability of these three isomers, the pka values (CH3CN/H2O) 10.07/2.33 of PD were measured higher than 8.72/1.3 of pyrimidine and 7.74/0.6 of pyrazine (illustrated in Table S1 with references, ESI†). Unlike the other two, the molecular structure of PD has been proposed as three resonance hybrid forms, including two Kekulè structures and one charge-distributed structure.134 The specialty of PD is ascribed to the large Pauli lone-pair repulsion in N–N/NN bonds (Fig. 1d) and is influenced by the priority of the electrostatic and σ-orbital interactions of the C–N bonds of PD-ring.135 It is well known that the N–N/NN bond stores great energy, which is regarded as the primary source of PD's special electronic structure. In 2008, Benin summarized136 the high-energetic tetrazine, pentazines, and hexazine systems containing more than one N–N/NN bond. In 2019, Dobrynin and collaborators developed a technique named nanosecond-pulsed spark discharge plasma in liquid N2 and contiguous N-fragment (N3) from NaN3 recombined and obtained neutral or ionic N6 as the polynitrogen material.137 In 2022, Wang reported the experimental and theoretical investigation of metallic luster and planar hexazine dianions in the form of N62−, which is metastable when pressures decreased to 20 GPa and can be stabilized in K2N6 above 45GPa.138 Therefore, it is indicated that the structure–variability, reaction–activity, stimulus–sensitivity, and substitution–modificability of PDs are strongly influenced by the unique N–N/NN bonds, which are different from that of other diazines (Fig. 1c). Yu and collaborator139 systematically summarized the diazine-based TADF emitters, especially pyrazine- and pyrimidine-based ones. But PD-based TADF emitters are not so extensive owing to the potential intramolecular transformation of resonance hybrid forms in brackets (Fig. 1c) under various electronic push–pull environments. This self-regulative transformation might result in a neutralized tuning of the RISC process with a potentially large ΔEST for naked PDs or common substituted PDs. Once strong electron push–pull groups are modified on PD-rings, the variability of intramolecular transformation from three resonance forms of PD-ring to monohydropyridazine (monohydroPDs) form or dihydroPD form (Fig. 1c) arises and makes the controllable structural optimization a multivariate puzzle. However, modification strategies on new PD-based TADF emitters can also be performed using proper bridge groups,77,78 steric ortho-substitution, expensive or cheap metal-complexation140–143 with suppressed variables as ligands for PhOLED emitters.
4. Conclusion and outlook
In summary, PDs with adjacent sp2-N pair can be used to construct various compounds, including polymers, pure organic small molecules, pure organic complexes, ligand–metal complexes, and ionized quaternary ammonium salt derivatives, possessing structural or electronic characteristics of adjacent sp2-N pair, electron-deficiency, regioisomerism, acceptors of hydrogen bonds, and dual-coordination. These advantages enable them to be useful host materials, TADF materials, or key active ingredients for OFETs, OPVs, OLEDs, and other functional applications. Most interestingly, PDs, embedded with variable –NN–/N–N moieties in their molecular structures, show excellent performance and great potential when used as stimulus-responsive materials for electrochromism, acidochromism, and chemochromism. In addition, PDs are beginning to make breakthroughs as organocatalysts and electrode materials for photocatalysis, energy storage/release. There are some difficulties and challenges. For example, the NIR or far IR emission spectra of organic PDs are not easy to achieve even for large π-extended pyrrolopyridazine (pyrroloPD) (PP-1 and PP-2 (Scheme 6)),122 tetraazaperylenes (TAP-a and TAP-b (Scheme 6)),55,144 and π-extended phthalazine (2QP (Scheme 6)),145 diazabenzo[ghi]perylene derivatives (DABP-1, DABP-2 (Scheme 6)).146 Moreover, the performance of organic thin film optoelectronic devices with PD-based active ingredients remains at relatively low levels, including the charge mobilities (Fig. 2a and Table 1), photovoltaic performance (Fig. 2b and Table 2), and NIR luminescence efficiencies (Fig. 2c and Table 3).
Based on the unique structures of PD-cored chemicals, more systematic top-down or bottom-up molecular design for highly performing PD-based molecular libraries and star molecular systems would be achieved under the great efforts of global experts. The relatively fewer kinds and numbers of PD-cored materials are mainly attributed to two reasons. (1) The first reason is that the potential self-transformation between N–N and NN bonds determines the instability of the sp2-N pair containing the PD-ring with large Pauli lone-pair repulsion in N–N/NN bonds and the three resonance hybrid forms. (2) In contrast, the stability of pyrimidine and pyrazine cores determines the relative predomination of the investigation as useful materials. Given time, there will be more specific achievements. This review calls for more efforts to enrich versatile PDs for high-performance materials beyond bioactive pharmaceutical drugs and pesticides.49,147
For the sake of more and better functional PD-ring-based materials, herein, the general strategy can be explored by combining the previous studies and interesting results with practical synthetic methodologies (Scheme 7),50,106,148–156 theoretical calculations,129,157–161 aza-quantity effect and aza-regioisomerism,159,160 and supramolecular strategies,29,162–165 the serendipitously discovered or well-designed of PD-based materials possess huge application prospects in the fields of optoelectronics, chromism, fluorescence probes, and energy materials. The unceasing breakthroughs in catalysis,9,45,115,154,166,167 magnetic complexes,155,168 molecular rotators (Fig. 8b),162 and high strength/stiffness nanothreads32,169,170 are worthy of further investigation and devotion (Fig. 1b).
