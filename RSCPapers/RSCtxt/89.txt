A square-planar platinum(II) based dye containing 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine
 and quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate ligands achieves efficient
 sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells over a wide
 visible range, generating a short-circuit photocurrent of 6.14
 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit potential of 600 mV under simulated
 AM 1.5 solar irradiation, with a solar energy
 conversion efficiency of 2.6%.Photoelectrochemical systems with dye-sensitized metal oxide semiconductor electrodes have allowed the construction of low-cost photovoltaic devices over past two decades.1 Several organic dyes1–4 and transition metal complexes of Ru(II),5–8 Os(II)9
 and Fe(II)10 have been employed in solar cells to sensitize nanocrystalline metal oxide semiconductors. So far, the most successful sensitizers employed in these devices are diimine-type complexes of ruthenium(II) anchored to nanocrystalline TiO2 films, yielding overall AM 1.5 solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies of up to 11%.5,6 Octahedral ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes are found to be attractive sensitizers due to their favorable light absorption, redox properties, luminescence emission, excited state lifetime and photostability in the device.5–8Luminescence from square-planar platinum(II) complexes has been known for many years but restricted mainly to the solid state or in frozen glasses.11–13 In recent years, a number of Pt(II) complexes with chelating diimine and its derivatives have been synthesized that display long-lived solution luminescence under ambient conditions.14 Eisenberg and co-workers
 have made elaborate studies on the excited state of mixed-ligand platinum(II) complexes with diimine and dithiolate ligands, over the past decade.15–17 These complexes have a long-lived charge transfer excited state, which is emissive in fluid solution at room temperature and undergoes electron transfer quenching both oxidatively and reductively.15,17 The charge transfer excited state energies of Pt(diimine)(dithiolate) complexes can be tuned about 1 eV through changes in the electron donating and accepting abilities of the diimine and dithiolate ligands.17 Though a large number
 of square-planar platinum(II) complexes represent a promising class of charge transfer sensitizers, they have not been fabricated into solar cells until now. In order to study the photoelectrochemical performance of Pt(II) based sensitizers, we have synthesized Pt(H2dcbpy)(qdt), 1, and Pt(H2dcphen)(qdt), 2 (H2dcbpy=4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine, H2dcphen=4,7-dicarboxy-1,10-phenanthroline, and qdt=quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate). We have achieved for the first time a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of about 2.5%, using these
 square-planar platinum(II) diimine dithiolate dyes (1 and 2) anchored to nanocrystalline TiO2films.  Pt(H2dcbpy)Cl2 and Pt(H2dcphen)Cl2 were prepared by
 boiling a reaction mixture of potassium tetrachloroplatinate(II)
 (1.0 mmol), KCl (600 mg) and the corresponding diimine
 ligand (1.02 mmol) in 50 ml of water for 4 h. A few drops of
 0.1 M KOH were added to the mixture to help dissolve the
 ligand. The light yellow product that precipitated was filtered
 out, washed with hot water and dried under vacuum. Complexes
 1 and 2
 were prepared by adding a degassed solution of
 H2qdt (0.62 mmol) in MeOH (5 ml) to a degassed solution of
 Pt(H2dcbpy)Cl2 or Pt(H2dcphen)Cl2
 (0.6 mmol) in aqueous
 0.1 M KOH (30 ml). The solution turned red-orange after 10 min
 and was allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h.16 The
 product was precipitated out by adding 0.1 M HCl, filtered off and washed several times with water. Both Pt(H2dcbpy)(qdt)†
 and Pt(H2dcphen)(qdt)‡ were purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column.The platinum(II) diimine dithiolate complexes (1 and 2)
 exhibit a broad band in the 350–550 nm range of their respective absorption spectra, with a molar extinction coefficient of 10000–13000
 M−1 cm−1
[Fig. 1(a)]. This band is assigned as mixed
 Pt/qdt-to-diimine charge transfer excited state,16 involving a transition from a HOMO that has a mixture of Pt and qdt orbital
 character to a LUMO that is a low-energy π* orbital of the diimine ligands. The visible bands in the absorption spectra of
 both 1 and 2 broaden and are red-shifted upon adsorption onto TiO2
 (Fig. 2). When excited within the charge transfer absorption band, complex 1 in degassed ethanol–methanol solution
 at 298 K exhibits a luminescence consisting of a broad band with a maximum at 650 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(b). A structured
 emission with a maximum at 575 nm was observed in an ethanol–methanol glass matrix at 77 K. The excited state lifetime of complex 1 was measured to be 50 μs at 77 K, which decreased with increasing temperature and became 57 ns in fluid solution at 298 K. The very short-lived excited state in fluid solution may be caused by efficient nonradiative decay ia low-lying
 ligand field excited states or solvent interactions in the
 open coordination sites.13 The 
cyclic voltammograms of complexes 1 and 2, measured in DMF containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate, show one irreversible wave for the Pt3+/2+ couple at +0.8 and +0.9 V18s. SCE, respectively.
 All the photophysical, 
electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of 1 and 2 are collected in Table 1. The excited state oxidation potentials of these complexes are estimated to be <−1.01 V s. SCE from the electrochemical and spectroscopic data.19 The excited states have enough thermodynamic driving force to inject an electron into the conduction band20 of the nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductor.

 2 was carried out by dipping 12 nm thick films overnight in a
 5×10−5 M ethanolic solution of 1 or 2, containing 40 mM deoxycholic
 acid, 7%
tert-butylpyridine and 3% DMSO. The surface concentration of both 1 and 2 on TiO2 film is around 9.5×10−8
 mol cm−2. The presence of deoxycholic acid and tert-butylpyridine, as a co-adsorbent, are found to be necessary to prevent stacking13
 and/or self-quenching21 of the dye molecules. Square-planar platinum(II) complexes are known to exhibit intermolecular stacking interactions in solution and in the solid state. Photoelectrochemical experiments of the dye sensitized semiconductor electrode films were performed with a sandwich-type solar cell,8 in conjunction with a redox electrolyte consisting of a solution of 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M LiI in methoxyacetonitrile. Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent action
 spectra of such a cell sensitized by complexes 1 and 2, where the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is
 plotted as a function of wavelength. Both 1 and 2 achieved efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells over
 a wide visible range, displaying a maximum around 500 nm, where IPCE approaches a high value of about 30%. A short-circuit photocurrent of 6.14 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit potential
 of 600 mV with an impressive 
fill factor of 0.71 were obtained for 1
 under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 2.6% (Fig. 3). These results show that high injection efficiencies can be achieved for this class of square-planar platinum(II) diimine dithiolate sensitizers, leading to efficient photovoltaic devices. A further improvement in the conversion efficiency is possible
 by increasing the spectral response in the low-energy part of the solar spectrum. Work on the optimization of the cell efficiency and its stability under long-term irradiation is in progress.

 2 at +0.9 V s. SCE is 0.15 V more positive than the corresponding
 process in Pt(phen)(qdt).15
 This is attributed to the electron
 withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid functionality, which
 reduces the electron density around the metal center.6.
