    , Accepted 30th July 2019First published on 6th August 2019AbstractExciplex forming co-hosts have been applied to fabricate high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to the merits of bipolarity, 100% exciton harvesting, preferred dipole alignment, and sensitizing effects. We review the discovery and development of the exciplex mechanism framework, from its discovery to successful application as hosts for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) OLEDs, and hyperfluorescent OLEDs, as well as in white OLEDs (WOLEDs). Exciplex forming co-hosts utilize the TADF effect to guarantee high exciton utilization efficiency. The charge-injection-free energy level configuration decreases the driving voltages and brings about improved power efficiency. The increased transitional dipole moment of emitters in exciplex forming co-hosts adds outcoupling efficiency to beat the efficiency limit. Exciplexes with the TADF effect also show sensitizing effects, making high-efficiency fluorescent OLEDs possible. This review introduces the progressive achievements of exciplex forming co-hosts, aimed at forming a summary of the present research on exciplex based OLEDs, and hopefully helping researchers grasp the future developing trend of exciplex forming co-hosts.

1. Introduction
Since organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were introduced in 1987 by C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke,1 tremendous efforts have been made to improve the performance. Currently, the most well-known high-efficiency OLED is a multi-layer structure with a doped emitting layer (EML). Host materials are used to disperse the emitter and to reduce both concentration-quenching and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA). Exciplex forming co-hosts have been newly developed as efficient hosts in OLEDs, helping to balance charge transport and improve the device configuration. Such hosts outperform traditional hosts in terms of driving voltage, power efficiency (PE), operational lifetime, and efficiency roll-off, etc. The exciplex originates from the photoexcitation or electroexcitation of the blend or bilayer of two materials, incorporating electron donor (D) or acceptor (A) moieties. The main characteristic of exciplexes is electron exchange between the D and A, with one in the excited state and the other in its ground state (D*A or DA*), forming an exciplex state ((D+A−)*) with red-shifted emission and a broadened spectrum compared with those of D or A.2–4
In the early studies about exciplexes, it was believed that such intermediate states would lead to additional non-radiative or radiative relaxation pathways, which generally caused multi-component EL spectra and low quantum efficiency with additional emission from the device.5–7 Nonetheless, in follow-up studies, it was assumed that the exciplex energy could be quenched by phosphors with smaller gaps for pure phosphorescence emission.8 Meanwhile, there were reports using mixed hosts (hole-transporting materials and electron-transporting materials) by solution processing methods, without noticing that energy transfer actually took place between the exciplex and dopants,9,10 until a study in 2010 by Kwon et al.11 and after by Kim et al.12 Such energy transfer processes proved that exciplexes can actually serve as potential hosts for OLEDs. By then, the advantages of exciplex energy transfer-based OLEDs were mainly acknowledged as balanced charge mobilities or reduced charge trapping by the dopants. In 2012, the Adachi group introduced the idea of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) to define the mechanism of exciplex formation and the energy transfer process.4,13 Since then the idea of using exciplexes as a potential energy transfer medium has rapidly been accepted by many researchers. Unlike phosphorescent emitters, converting singlets into triplets via intersystem crossing (ISC), TADF is a process alternatively up-converting “cold” triplets into singlets through enhanced reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to potentially accomplish 100% exciton harvesting. TADF materials or exciplexes have basically E-type delayed fluorescence, and often have a small singlet–triplet gap (ΔEST, 0–50 meV),14 which is defined as the energy difference between the lowest singlet (S1*) state and the lowest triplet state (T1*).13,15,16 In theory, an efficient RISC process could be thermally activated when ΔEST is small enough, which can be expressed as ΔEST = ES − ET = 2J(1)where J is the electron exchange energy, related to the spatial work function overlap of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the molecules.17
As aforementioned, the Adachi group reported a fine adjustment method to reduce the electron exchange energy between donating and accepting moieties within a molecule, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Here, spatially separated frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs, HOMO/LUMO) were created by a twisted and weakly coupled electron D/A configuration linked by a bridge. In analogy to TADF molecules, they also explained in another paper that the donor and acceptor moieties in an exciplex can be considered locked in place in solid-state thin films, which causes the HOMOs and LUMOs to be considered localized.4 Both cases reduce the electron exchange energy as well as ΔEST, inducing subtle intra- and intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) processes for TADF molecules and exciplexes, respectively. It's worth noting that we only cover exciplexes with the TADF effect in this review. In an exciplex forming co-host-based OLED, as electrons and holes are injected from and accumulated at the LUMO of the acceptor (LUMOA) and the HOMO of the donor (HOMOD), they can form bound electron and hole pairs (excitons) and then undergo radiative recombination for exciplex emission. Thus, an exciplex is referred to as the bound CT state of a bimolecular process, as shown in Fig. 1(b).

The donor and acceptor were connected with an intramolecular linking bridge. 
However, a simple mixture of random electron donors and acceptors does not necessarily lead to an exciplex with the TADF effect. For exciplexes with high quantum yields (η) and the TADF effect, multiple conditions are required. (1) The electron donating and accepting materials should possess high charge mobilities, and are usually hole- and electron-transporting materials, to ensure efficient charge injection. (2) To ensure charge accumulation, the LUMOA/LUMOD offset and HOMOA/HOMOD offset should both be about 0.4 eV or larger. (3) It is preferable to choose donor and acceptor materials with high T1 to suppress back-energy-transfer from the exciplex. The exciplex energy (SE1 and TE1) can be described as Eexciplex = e(Eox,D − Ered,A) + constant(2)where Eox,D and Ered,A are the oxidation potential of the donors and the reduction potential of the acceptors, respectively.18 As shown in Fig. 1(a), with Eexciplex (SE1 and TE1) less than SD1/TD1 and SA1/TA1, it clearly shows exciton confinement and avoids unnecessary recombination channels. More importantly, the triplet energy (ET) of the exciplex host is adjustable by simply selecting donor and acceptor materials with different oxidation or reduction potentials. Last, exciplex formation can also be predicted by the driving force of the system −ΔGcs = Eexciton(EA* or ED*) − Eexciplex(3)where EA* and ED* are the exciton energy of the constituting molecules.18,19 By analysing three exciplexes, Zhang et al. considered that a ΔGcs of larger than 0.57 eV is favorable for exciplex emission. In OLEDs based on exciplexes, direct charge-transfer occurs at the FMOs of donors and acceptors, so the radiative decay energy of Eexciplex, hv, is normally less than the difference between the HOMOD and LUMOA. Hence, for OLEDs utilizing exciplex forming co-hosts, the exciplexes can be regarded as small bandgap hosts with appreciable exciton confinement effects and other merits, which will be introduced in Section 2. Typically, the molar ratio of the electron donor and acceptor materials is kept at 1:1 for most exciplex forming co-hosts.20–24 However, there are reports on the exciplex emission efficiency indicating that a lower acceptor molar ratio would increase the PL efficiency in a m-MTDATA:Bphen (m-MTDATA, 4,4′,4′′-tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-phenylamino)-triphenylamine; Bphen, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) mixed exciplex.25 In 2007, Niu et al. claimed that a mixture of donating and accepting materials would boost the exciplex emission.26 Besides the physical intermolecular contact, adequate electron cloud overlap of the mutual molecules is also indispensable for the charge transfer. In general, efficient electron transfer between the donor and acceptor molecules facilitates the exciplex efficiency. The exciplex emission efficiency is a collaborative parameter depending on the HOMO/LUMO match, the intermolecular FMO overlap, the carrier mobilities, the D:A molar ratio, etc. When using exciplex hosts in OLEDs, they generate a ratio of singlet:triplet excitons equal to 1:3 under electrical excitation. For PhOLEDs or TADF OLEDs, both singlet and triplet excitons participate in the recombination process. Hence the doping ratio of phosphorescent or TADF emitters remains the same as that of traditional hosts. For fluorescent emitters, however, it requires an extremely low doping concentration in order to avoid non-radiative triplet–triplet energy transfer to the dopant, as the Dexter exciton radius can be as short as several nanometers.27 Therefore, the doping concentrations for most fluorescent emitters are below 1 wt%. Due to the up-conversion of triplets into singlets by the efficient RISC process, the triplet energy can be harvested through the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of singlets between the exciplex and dopant. The additional FRET in hyperfluorescent OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts will greatly improve the internal quantum efficiency (IQE, ηint).
In this review, we focus on the features of monochromatic OLEDs and white OLEDs (WOLEDs) using exciplex forming co-hosts in the most recent publications. This review will also cover some work of our group to elaborate the main ideas of the review. In Section 2, the basic mechanism, the D/A material selection to form appropriate exciplex hosts, and the roles and the advantages of using exciplex forming co-hosts will be introduced. The third and fourth section will cover approaches to improving the device performance and simplifying the device configuration. Some typical applications in monochromatic OLEDs (green, red and blue) and WOLEDs will be compared. We will also try to look for the patterns of designing high-efficiency exciplex forming co-host-based OLEDs. In the fifth section, a multi-channel recombination process in exciplex forming co-host-based hyperfluorescent OLEDs will be introduced in detail. Finally, we will summarize the recent progress on exciplex forming co-hosts and give an outlook for future development.
2. Comprehensive roles and outstanding merits of exciplex hosts
In this review, an exciplex host refers to a mixed host with the TADF effect. Some examples of using the energy transfer from the D/A interface exciplex to the emitters will also be regarded as exciplex hosts for comparison. Without doubt, exciplexes can also be utilized as emitters if the PLQY is high enough. Sections 4 and 5 involve some examples of exciplexes serving as both blue emitters and hosts for other emitters, but the topic of exciplexes as emitters is beyond the scope of this discussion. Either a mixed exciplex co-host or an interface exciplex is the CT state of a bimolecular (intermolecular) system. For TADF materials, however, the donor and acceptor groups are linked by a D–A bridge as shown in Fig. 1(c). In order to realize the RISC effect, the key is to reduce the FMO overlap and decrease the ΔEST value, which is often realized by a highly twisted molecular conformation. Increasing the steric hindrance also helps limit the HOMO and LUMO communication, which is very important for deep blue TADF emitters. However, the D/A configuration of TADF materials does not necessarily make them bipolar hosts for OLEDs. Another difference is that in order to increase the PLQY of TADF emitters, the molecules are designed to suppress the intermolecular interactions with the material itself or the host material. Unlike TADF materials, in an exciplex-based OLED, electrons and holes are firstly injected into the LUMOs of the acceptors and the HOMOs of the donors, respectively, followed by electron exchange between the FMOs of the D/A materials. This makes exciplexes superior to TADF materials as host materials, considering that both of them feature the TADF effect, but exciplex hosts also have strong bipolarity and low injection barriers. Hence, we will focus on the description of the advantages of exciplex hosts and some examples in this review.
2.1 Reduction in driving voltage
Unlike traditional hosts, the driving voltage of OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts can reach as low as the emitted photon energy (in units of “eV”) simply by tuning the energy level alignment. In traditional host–dopant systems, phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) for example, phosphorescent emitters serve as hole traps followed by electron capture, exciton formation, and then recombination as they are electrically excited.28–30 Such a trap-assisted recombination model causes a rise in voltage as the doping ratio increases. For exciplex forming co-hosts, however, the charge recombination is enhanced by Langevin recombination so that the light emission is mainly produced by direct energy transfer from the exciplex to the dopants rather than by trap-assisted recombination. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the direct recombination of the holes in the HOMOD and electrons in the LUMOA will effectively reduce the driving voltage due to the decreased excitation energy (appr. the HOMOD/LUMOA offset). By contrast, in a traditional host–dopant system as shown in Fig. 2(c), the carriers are commonly hosted by large band gap materials with equivalent high T1 and a much larger S1. Such a high-lying S1 and wide band gap cause an increase in the driving voltage.31

Similarly, in 2015, Lee et al. studied the light emission mechanism by comparing the current density and luminance of two types of mixed host based devices. They found that the light emission in the exciplex based OLED is energy transfer dominated, while the exciplex free OLED was controlled by charge trapping.32 Based on the Langevin recombination model, the exciplex forming co-hosts are equivalent to small bandgap hosts with the same HOMO/LUMO levels as the HOMOD/LUMOA. By careful material selection and device engineering, it is possible to match the HOMOD/LUMOA with those of the dopant. The theoretical lowest driving voltage could reach as low as the triplet energy gap of the dopant. In 2013, Kim et al. reported green PhOLEDs with an ultralow driving voltage of only 2.4 V at 1 cd m−2 using an exciplex forming co-host TCTA:B3PYMPM (TCTA, 4,4′,4′′-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenylamine; B3PYMPM, bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimi-dine) doped by Ir(ppy)2acac (iridium(III) bis(2-phenylquinoline)acetylacetonate).33 The driving voltage was much lower than that of using CBP (4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl) (2.8 V) as a single host.29 As shown in Fig. 3(a), the LUMO and HOMO of Ir(ppy)2acac are 3.01 and 5.47 eV, very close to the LUMO of B3PYMPM (3.2 eV) and HOMO of TCTA (5.83 eV). The device only had a hole injection barrier of 0.2 eV at the TAPC/TCTA (TAPC, di-[4-(N,N-ditolyl-amino)-phenyl]cyclohexane) organic/organic junction and nearly zero electron injection barrier. Besides, in their further report, the driving voltage also remained unchanged for different doping concentrations due to the dominant Langevin recombination.29 The results proved that the exciplex forming co-hosts reduce the charge injection barriers and driving voltage losses. Low driving voltage blue PhOLEDs were also realized using an mCP:POT2T (mCP, N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene; PO-T2T, (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(benzene-3,1-diyl)(tris(diphenylphosphine oxide))) exciplex co-host with FIrpic (iridium(III)bis[(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2′]-picolinate) as a dopant.34 Its current injection started at only 2.0 V and the device showed a turn on voltage of 2.4 V at 1 cd m−2. In 2017, a high T1 (3.0 eV) exciplex co-host was developed by the Kim group.35 A low driving voltage of 2.9 V was achieved using mCP:BM-A10 (2,4-bis(4-(diphenyl-phosphoryl)phenyl)pyridine) as a co-host and FCNIr (tris((3,5-difluoro-4-cyanophenyl)-pyridine)iridium) as a blue emitter, compared with 3.3 V when using mCP alone as a host. In our recent work, Zhang et al. reported a multi-exciplex-forming co-host (MEH) EML configuration to further reduce the driving voltage.36 By constructing a “staircases” energy alignment of two exciplex hosts, the WOLEDs reached 2.1 V in turn-on voltage and 115.5 lm W−1 in power efficiency. Exciplex forming co-hosts can also decrease the driving voltage of tandem PhOLEDs. In 2014, Liao et al. reported a green single and tandem PhOLED using exciplex forming co-host m-MTDATA:TPBi (1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)-benzeneare) in electroluminescence (EL) units.27 The device structures and electroluminescence properties are shown in Fig. 4. The driving voltage for a single unit OLED was 2.2 V, which was much lower than that using the CBP host (3.1 V). For a tandem OLED using an intermediate connector (IC) consisting of “LiNH2-doped BPhen/MoO3”, nearly zero voltage loss across the IC was realized and the driving voltage is only slightly over twice that of the single unit OLED.

2.2 Enhancement in power efficiency and external quantum efficiency
One important parameter for future low power consumption lighting or display panels is the PE, the ratio of luminous flux to power.37–39 To realize high PE OLEDs, two key issues should be addressed: (1) to realize 100% IQE and to increase the luminance, and (2) to remove the carrier injection barrier and to reduce the driving voltage.40 As shown in Fig. 1(a), an exciplex can harvest 100% electrogenerated exciton energy, i.e., both singlets and triplets, and transfer to dopants via FRET and Dexter energy transfer (DET), respectively. Hence, for the first point, high IQE can be realized depending on the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, ηPL) of the dopants. Besides, the IQE of the device can be favored by enhanced horizontal transitional dipoles as introduced below. Due to the reduced driving voltages as mentioned in the previous section, the power consumption will decrease, and an exciplex thus can increase the PE as a host for fluorescent,38,41–43 phosphorescent,40,44–46 and TADF38,47,48 OLEDs.
It is known that for both fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters, a higher ratio of horizontal transition dipoles to vertically aligned dipoles can increase the light out-coupling efficiency and EQE of polymer and small molecule OLEDs.20,22,49–51 With a preferred horizontal dipole moment alignment of emitters in the EML, an exciplex can also achieve ultra-high EQE of the theoretical limit as confirmed by the Kim group.20,22 As reported, in a green PhOLED using Ir(ppy)2acac as the dopant and TCTA:B3PYMPM as an exciplex forming co-host, it showed a preferred orientation with a horizontal to vertical dipole ratio of 0.77:0.23 by analysing the angle dependent PL data (Fig. 5(a) and (b)).20 Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), an increase in the horizontal-to-vertical dipole ratio (0.76:0.24) was also observed in a blue PhOLED using FIrpic (T1 = 2.62 eV) as the dopant and mCP:B3PYMPM (2.97 eV) as the exciplex co-host.22 Both devices exhibited high maximum EQEs of about 30%, which matched well with the calculated results. In later reports, similar increases of the horizontal to vertical dipole ratio were observed in tandem,52 white,53 red,54 green,55–57 yellow,53,56 and blue PhOLEDs,22 as well as in fluorescent58,59 and TADF48 OLEDs. It proved that exciplexes as versatile hosts for OLEDs can significantly increase the device performance.

2.3 Broadening of the recombination zone
Balanced charge transport in the EML is the key for broadening the recombination zone. For most host (mainly hole-type) materials, the electron mobility is about 2 to 3 orders lower than the hole mobility. By introducing strong electron-withdrawing moieties, electron type hosts can be realized with a hole-blocking effect. However, for either hole or electron type hosts, the recombination tends to locate either at the hole-transporting layer (HTL)/EML interface or the EML/electron-transporting layer (ETL) interface.60 It is reported that bipolar hosts have more balanced charge transport, though it does not necessarily broaden the recombination zone. Since bipolar hosts incorporate electron-donating and withdrawing moieties, it not only increases the synthesis complexity, but also makes it difficult to achieve high triplet energy as a result of intramolecular charge transfer. In addition, the weak charge-blocking effect of bipolar hosts means hole- and electron-blocking layers (HBL/EBL) are necessary for a device, which adds to the production complexity. Since an exciplex forming co-host is a blend of donor and acceptor materials, it has inherent balanced charge mobility. With the charge-injection-free HOMO/LUMO level matching, accumulated carriers can be effectively removed by an applied electric field.44 Additionally, the various combinations of exciplex hosts make it attainable for most dopants. Kim et al. found the EL shift at different driving currents can be reduced in a deep blue PhOLED using mCP:BM-A10 as an exciplex forming co-host.35 Recently, Liao et al. used a thin sensing layer to investigate the recombination zone in a blue PhOLED having a gradient exciplex as a host.44 As shown in Fig. 6, an ultrathin layer of PO-01 ((iridium(III) bis(4-phenylthieno[3,2-c]pyridinato-N,C′)acetylacetonate)) (0.5 nm) was inserted into different positions of the STPy4:PO-T2T exciplex. It clearly shows that energy transfer from the exciplex to PO-01 can be well accomplished across the co-host region, meaning better exciton allocation. As a result, the EQE of the WOLED using this exciplex forming co-host is 27.5% at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2. However, no evident data precisely characterized the recombination zone. Besides, some reports pointed out a narrow recombination zone would have better carrier and exciton confinement61 and prevent red-shift.62

2.4 Reduction in efficiency roll-off
Exciton saturation at high current density is the main reason for large efficiency roll-off in PhOLEDs and TADF OLEDs.31,63–66 For most PhOLEDs or TADF OLEDs, the excitons only form at a shallow interface between the HTL/EML or EML/ETL, depending on the host type. As long lifetime triplet states are involved in the recombination process, high triplet concentration will cause severe TTA and triplet-polaron annihilation (TPA), leading to efficiency roll-off.66–68 Exciplex forming co-hosts simply provide a broader recombination zone compared to a traditional host with a narrow one so that the otherwise high triplet concentration would be substantially reduced in the broad recombination zone, thus resulting in a lower efficiency roll-off. In 2013, Kim et al. reported a high-efficiency orange OLED based on an exciplex forming co-host with extremely small efficiency roll-off very close to that of a fluorescent OLED.69 Other issues such as resistance losses due to the mismatch between the HOMO/LUMO of the adjacent layer and limited charge mobilities can also cause large roll-off at high applied voltages, which is inevitable except for exciplex forming co-hosts.60,66 Reduction in efficiency roll-off has also been reported in OLEDs with bipolar hosts or mixed host systems.60,70–74 However, efficiency roll-off at extremely high luminance still exists due to TTA and TPA. In PhOLEDs, as exciplexes provide TADF, the quick RISC process would redistribute the triplet excitons and thus lead to a much lower triplet population.75,76 As for TADF OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts, the exciplex can provide an additional fast RISC rate (kRISC) to suppress the bimolecular annihilation, subsequently reducing the efficiency roll-off.43,77 In 2017, Kim et al. reported a green TADF OLED with an exciplex forming co-host, combining intra- and intermolecular charge-transfer processes.43 They proved the concept that the RISC in the exciplex would increase the singlet ratio to higher than 25% owing to the long-range singlet exciton energy transfer between the exciplex and the TADF dopants (Fig. 7(a)). In comparison, as Fig. 7(b) shows, the OLEDs using a non-exciplex host (CBP) favored a trap-assisted recombination process which mainly takes place on the TADF molecules, similar to PhOLEDs. As a result, the RISC rate in the exciplex forming co-host system increased 1.5 fold and the device only showed 9.4% EQE roll-off at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2, which was much lower than that (>31%) in an OLED with a traditional host.

In our collaborative work, Fung et al. also discovered that the efficiency roll-off of green PhOLEDs can be well reduced by a multi-quantum-well (MQW) structure interface exciplex.65 The device structure was ITO (110 nm)/HAT-CN (hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile) (10 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/EML/B3PyMPM (70 nm)/Liq (quinolone lithium) (0.2 nm)/Al (120 nm). By inserting a thin layer (0.2 nm) of green phosphorescent emitter Ir(ppy)2acac into the interface of the exciplex TCTA/B3PyMPM, pure green emission can be achieved, indicating all the energy was utilized by the dopant. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the EML consisted of MQWs of TCTA (3 nm)/Ir(ppy)2acac (0.2 nm)/B3PyMPM (3 nm). As the number of MQWs increases, the efficiency roll-off of the devices can be effectively alleviated. As they pointed out, since the TADF process has a longer exciton radius, the excessive triplet excitons can be recruited by the adjacent exciplex systems and then transfer to the S1 of the emitter via FRET. Consequently, the EQE in a 7-MQW OLED only showed a 19.3% roll-off at 5000 cd m−2. Although the MQW strategy reduced the efficiency roll-off, it also brought fabrication complexity.

2.5 Improvement in operational lifetime
In 2014, Seo et al. reported that the lifetime of OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts can theoretically reach 1 million hours at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m−2, as long as the exciplex is used as a medium of energy transfer rather than non-radiative relaxation pathways.78 The improvement in the operational lifetime of OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts benefits from multiple aspects: the broadened recombination zone, the blocked carrier leakage from the EML to the HTL or to the ETL, and the RISC process to reduce the triplet concentration. Typically, in traditional host–dopant system PhOLEDs, the emission zone is only located in a narrow interface due to the unipolar charge transport property of the host materials and the hole-trapping effect of the emitters. At high current density the exciton density and the probability of charge collision increase to deteriorate the TTA and TPA as mentioned above. And then the TTA and TPA generate high energy triplets and polarons, which cause degradation of the host materials and emitters leading to short operational lifetimes. Hence, broadening the emission zone is an effective way to prolong the operational lifetime of OLEDs. Exciplex forming co-hosts are an effective strategy for widening the recombination zone and reducing the negative and positive polarons. Furthermore, another key factor which would cause device degradation is the leakage of charges to the transporting layers, as most hole- and electron-transporting materials are not stable with hetero-type carriers. However, as for exciplex forming co-hosts, the carriers are blocked from the transporting layer and the exciplex energy will be directly transferred to the dopant. In 2017, Kim et al. reported a red PhOLED using NPB:PO-T2T (NPB, N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′′-diamine) as an exciplex host (Device 1), achieving an EQEmax of 34.1% and PEmax of 62.2 lm W−1.54 The device structure is shown in Fig. 9(a), with a doped hole HTL and ETL. More importantly, the operational lifetime for a red PhOLED, using Ir-(mphmq)2(tmd) (bis(4-methyl-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinoline))Ir(III) ((tetramethylheptadionate)) as an emitter, was 2249 h as the initial luminance reduced from 1000 to 900 cd m−2 (T90), proving that exciplex forming co-hosts can indeed increase the operational lifetime of OLEDs (Fig. 9(b)). But they also showed that not all exciplex hosts guarantee a long operational lifetime, because the lifetime of the device using an NPB:B3PYMPM exciplex host (Device 3) was even worse than that of the CBP host (Device 5). It was claimed that the longer operating lifetime of the OLEDs based on NPB:PO-T2T was due to the more stable anion state of PO-T2T than that of B3PYMPM. As further demonstrated by Duan et al. the operational lifetime of the OLED using the mixed exciplex forming co-host TCTA:CzTrz ((3′-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-3-yl)-9-carbazole) was almost two orders less than that of the interface exciplex TCTA/CzTrz.79 The main reason was due to the instability of TCTA, i.e., the bond dissociation reactions of arylamines caused by the hemolysis of the S1 states during the charge recombination process.80 In other words, the instability of TCTA in a bulk exciplex was due to the TCTA excitons. Therefore, a stable bulk exciplex system requires the electron donors to stay in a stable cation state, while the electron acceptors stay in a stable anion state. The energy transfer should be mainly between the CT states and the dopant rather than forming excitons and recombining via separate recombination channels of the donors and acceptors.

Although the operational lifetime using exciplexes as hosts is promising in green and red OLEDs, only a few studies have been published addressing the lifetime of blue OLEDs. In 2018, Lee et al. reported a stable exciplex forming co-host for blue PhOLEDs based on Ir(CNpi) (fac-tris(3-(1-(2,6-diisopropylphen-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzonitrile)iridium).81 They synthesized an electron-transporting material, CNmCBPCN (9-(3′-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-5-cyano-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)-9H-carbazole-3-carbonitrile), with appropriate HOMO/LUMO levels to form an exciplex between two p-type hosts, mCBP-1CN (3′,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile) and oCBP (2,2′-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,1′-biphenyl). The ortho linkage in oCBP made the HOMO isolated by distortion of the backbone, shifting the HOMO level deeper to −6.00 eV, compared with that of CBP (−5.82 eV). As a result, the blue PhOLED using the oCBP:CNmCBPCN exciplex forming co-host showed an EQEmax of 18.8%. For the lifetime test, the lifetime of the OLED based on the oCBP:CNmCBPCN exciplex was extended more than 1.8 times compared to that of the CNmCBPCN single host device.
As reported by Su et al. recently, the operational stability of OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts can be predicted based on multiple conditions.82 They studied six pairs of exciplexes, namely, TCTA:T2T (2,4,6-tri[(1,1′-biphenyl)-3-yl]-1,3,5-triazine), NPB:T2T, NPB:SpiroCO-mTRZ (1′-(3-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)phenyl)-1′H,10′H-spiro[acridine-9,9′-anthracen]-10′-one), NPB:SF2-TRZ (2-(9,9′-spirobi[fluoren]-2-yl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3Δ,5-triazine), BCzPh:T2T (BCzPh, 9,9′-diphenyl-9H,9′H-3,3′-bicarbazole), and BCzPh:SF2-TRZ. The chemical structures of the compounds are shown in Fig. 10(b). They divided the exciplexes into two groups: the RISC-dominated and the Dexter-dominated co-hosts. Transient PL and PLQY were measured to analyse the exciton dynamics properties of the exciplexes. It was calculated that NPB-based and BCzPh:SF2-TRZ complexes had larger kTnr and thus quicker triplet relaxation, which meant they can be defined as Dexter-dominated co-hosts. On the contrary, TCTA:T2T and BCzPh:T2T exciplexes were RISC-dominated co-hosts because of the rapid RISC rate of about 106 s−1. After doping a red phosphorescent dye, PQ2Ir (bis(2-phenylquinoline)(2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dionate)-iridium(III)), the PL decays from the exciplexes were reduced, showing complete FRET from the exciplex 1CT to the emitter. Generally, the ultrafast FRET helped decrease the reactive exciton density, which possibly caused chemical bond dissociation. The time-dependent singlet density and triplet density of the exciplexes were calculated to demonstrate the singlet and triplet relaxation lifetimes. It was found that the Dexter-dominated co-hosts had a transient lifetime span of only hundreds of nanoseconds, compared with the RISC-dominated ones. The short threshold time can reduce the hole-transporting moiety fission and quenching effect. It indicated that NPB:SpiroCO-mTRZ and TCTA:T2T would face serious degradation failures. Evidence was also found that the Dexter-dominated co-hosts reduce the exciton-polaron annihilation (EPA) degradation, which mostly originated from the hole-transporting materials. In order to give a direct comparison, the overall degradation patterns are shown in Fig. 10(c). It was predicted that BCzPh:SF2-TRZ and NPB:T2T forming exciplex co-hosts had the highest molecular stability. Then red PhOLEDs were fabricated using a red phosphorescent iridium complex emitter, PQ2Ir. The device configurations and chemical structures are shown in Fig. 10(d). It turned out the operational lifetime of PhOLEDs based on BCzPh:SF2-TRZ was 16 times longer than that of TCTA:T2T. The transient EL decays also indicated the hole-injection failure would induce hole trap accumulation and cause a huge rise in the driving voltage, accelerating the device degradation.

Generally, the challenge remains to synthesize novel stable donors and acceptors with higher triplet energy and suitable HOMO/LUMO levels to address the lifetime issue of blue OLEDs.
3. Exciplex hosts for monochromatic OLEDs
Monochromatic (red, green, and blue) OLEDs are essential components for display and lighting panels. Considering the multiple advantages, exciplex forming co-hosts have been applied to fabrication of high-performance OLEDs. In this section, we will discuss the application of exciplex forming co-hosts in three parts. Examples of monochromatic OLEDs, i.e., green, red, and blue OLEDs, will be covered in each part, respectively. It should be pointed out that exciplex forming co-hosts have been applied in OLEDs since 2010 before the mechanism was fully explored, but the device efficiency remained low.9–11 Only after the mechanisms of RISC and TADF were introduced into the exciplex host, and more transporting materials with strong electron donating or accepting abilities were synthesized, did more researchers then pay much attention to further studies of exciplex hosts. This section will mainly review the breakthrough studies on high-efficiency OLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts. Due to the limited length of this review, some early reports are not included in this section,11,12,83 which did not analyse the TADF or RISC mechanism of the involved exciplex, though the EL properties of the device were fully characterized. To gain a better understanding of the charge-transfer process in exciplex host based OLEDs, a multi-recombination channel process of exciplex hosts for hyperfluorescent OLEDs will be discussed in Section 5. Some parameters of the monochromatic OLEDs mentioned in this section are illustrated in Table 1.

3.1 High-efficiency green OLEDs
The study on high-efficiency exciplex forming co-host OLEDs began with the Kim group when they used a TCTA:B3PYMPM exciplex host and Ir(ppy)2(acac) dopant to fabricate green PhOLEDs in 2013.20 The phosphorescent emitter, Ir(ppy)2(acac), in the mixed exciplex showed a high PLQY of 94%. The green PhOLED had a simplified device structure: ITO/TAPC (75 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/TCTA:B3PYMPM:Ir(ppy)2(acac) (1:1 molar ratio and 8 wt%) (30 nm)/B3PYMPM (40 nm)/Al (100 nm). The EQEmax of the optimized device was about 30%. They used a classic dipole model based on the angle dependent PL data to calculate the out-coupling efficiency (ηout) of the device. The EQE (ηEQE) and ηout have the following relationship: ηEQE = γ × ηS/T × qeff(ηPL, Θ, Γ) × ηout(Θ, Γ)(4)where γ is the charge balance factor, qeff is the effective quantum yield, ηS/T equals 1, Θ is the horizontal dipole ratio and Γ is the geometric factor. Based on this model, the EQEmax can be calculated as high as 46%, taking ηPL and Θ to be 1 (Fig. 5(b)). In this specific case, they achieved a preferred non-isotropic orientation with a horizontal to vertical dipole ratio of 0.77:0.23 when the thickness of TAPC was 80 nm.
In 2014, Lee et al. explored the possible application of exciplex type co-hosts for green TADF OLEDs based on 4CzIPN ((1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-4,6-dicyanobenzene)) by comparing two exciplex free co-hosts, mCP:TPBi and CBP:TPBi, and two exciplex type co-hosts, TCTA:TPBi and TAPC:TPBi.84 As shown in Fig. 11(a), only the mCP:TPBi:4CzIPN film showed a featureless high intensity PL spectrum, however, the PL intensity for the exciplex type co-host doped films (TCTA:TPBi and TAPC:TPBi) was relatively low. Besides, as shown in Fig. 11(b), the overlap of the PL emission of the mixed hosts and UV-vis absorption spectra was extensive for mCP:TPBi and CBP:TPBi, indicating the energy transfer from the co-hosts to the dopant was sufficient. The PLQY values of the doped films further verified inefficient energy transfer for the exciplex type co-host-based films, which was 97%, 66%, 15%, and 6% for mCP, CBP, TCTA, and TAPC as the donor, respectively. Eventually, the EQEmax of the OLEDs based on the exciplex type co-hosts was only 5.6% and 3.3% for TCTA:TPBi and TAPC:TPBi, respectively, compared with 25.8% and 13.0% for the exciplex free co-hosts, mCP:TPBi and CBP:TPBi, respectively (Fig. 11(c)). Apart from the inefficient energy transfer between the exciplex and the dopant, another reason is the failure of suppressing exciton quenching in the 4CzIPN TADF devices, because the shallower HOMO levels of the aromatic amine type donors (HOMOTCTA = −5.7 eV and HOMOTAPC = −5.5 eV) compared with the TADF dopant HOMO (HOMO4CzIPN = −5.80 eV) can induce exciton quenching and additional exciplex formation in the dopant. In comparison, the exciplex free co-host comprising TPBi and deep HOMO level carbazole derivatives, mCP (−6.1 eV) and CBP (−5.9 eV), achieved much higher EQEmax.

Therefore, the challenge is that not all high-efficiency exciplex co-hosts for PhOLEDs can be applied for high-efficiency TADF OLEDs. At about the same time, Kim et al. reported a high-efficiency TADF OLED using 4CzIPN as a dopant and mCP:B3PYMPM as an exciplex forming co-host.85 As shown in Fig. 11(d), the HOMO of B3PYMPM is as low as −6.77 eV, meaning it could theoretically form an exciplex with mCP. The exciplex host resulted in exciton confinement in the dopant and avoided additional exciplex formation. Fig. 11(e) shows an adequate overlap of the PL emission of the exciplex and the absorption of the dopant for efficient energy transfer. The PLQY of mCP:B3PYMPM:4CzIPN was as high as 97 ± 3%. Based on the same method above, the horizontal dipole ratio, Θ, and the PLQY of the 30 nm thin film composed of mCP:B3PYMPM:(5 wt% 4CzIPN) were 0.73 and 0.97, respectively. The optimized device structure was ITO (70 nm)/(4 wt% ReO3):mCP (65 nm)/mCP (15 nm)/mCP:B3PyMPM:(5 wt% 4CzIPN) (30 nm)/B3PYMPM (20 nm)/(4 wt% Rb2CO3):B3PYMPM (50 nm)/Al (100 nm). As shown in Fig. 11(c), the energy level diagram clearly suggests there was no carrier injection barrier within the device. As a result, the EQEmax and PEmax of the device were 29.6% and 88.8 lm W−1, respectively, matching well with simulated results (Fig. 11(f)). Exciplex forming co-hosts are also efficient candidates for green tandem OLEDs. In 2017, Liao et al. reported a green tandem OLED having an EML of TAPC/Ir(ppy)2(acac)/TmPyPB (TmPyPB, 1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]-benzene). The thin layer of Ir(ppy)2(acac) between the interface exciplex TAPC/TmPyPB has little effect on the exciplex energy due to the long range FRET (up to 10 nm).86 The tandem OLED showed an EQEmax of 36.85%, which was two fold higher than the single unit OLED (17.97%).
Exciplex forming co-hosts also play significant roles in application in hyperfluorescent OLEDs to break the efficiency limit of traditional fluorescent OLEDs. In 2015, Lee et al. utilized an exciplex host TAPC:DPTPCz (1:1, by weight) to sensitize the traditional fluorescent emitter C545T (2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5H,11H-10-(2-benzothiazol-yl)quinolizine-[9,9a,1gh]coumarin). The device showed a low turn-on voltage of 2.8 V and CEmax, PEmax, and EQEmax of 44.0 cd A−1, 46.1 lm W−1, and 14.5%, respectively.87 They proved that nearly 100% triplet harvesting at a low doping ratio (0.4 wt% and 0.2 wt%) using an EML of “TAPC:DPTPCz:C545T” can be realized. The key was to reduce triplet–triplet energy transfer, which is usually wasted by non-radiative recombination, and to increase the FRET assisted by up-conversion of the triplets via the RISC process. The detailed energy transfer process will also be introduced in Section 5. In 2018, Wong et al. reported a versatile exciplex forming co-host for both a traditional green fluorescent emitter, C545T, and green phosphorescent emitter, Ir(ppy)2(acac).42 The exciplex host BCzPh:3P-T2T (2:1) (3P-T2T, 2,4,6-tris(3-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine) not only showed a high PLQY value of 68%, but also served as a great host for C545T and Ir(ppy)2(acac). The pure exciplex emission device had an EQEmax and PEmax of 13.5% and 45.9 lm W−1, respectively. For the device with 1 wt% C545T doped in the exciplex matrix, the highest values of EQE and PE were 15.5% and 66.5 lm W−1, respectively, and for the PhOLED with Ir(ppy)2(acac), those were 29.7% and 143.4 lm W−1, respectively.
3.2 High-efficiency red OLEDs
The first paper utilizing the exciplex energy of a mixed exciplex host was actually reported by Kwon et al. in 2010 when they applied mixed exciplexes, m-MTDATA or 2-TNATA with TPBi, as hosts and the red phosphorescent emitter Ir(phq)2acac as the dopant.11 However, the EQEmax was only about 10.3% for 2-TNATA:TPBi compared with 9.9% for the m-MTDATA:TPBi exciplex. In 2014, Liao et al. compared the efficiencies of red PhOLEDs with the Ir(piq)3 emitter using traditional and exciplex hosts.88 We found a substantial improvement in current efficiency at 20 mA cm−2, where the value was 10.4 cd A−1 for the m-MTDAT:BPhen exciplex host but 6.5 cd A−1 for the TPBi single host. However, to further increase the efficiency, it requires a deeper understanding in terms of the energy transfer and intermolecular interactions between the exciplex and the dopant. A huge improvement was made by the Kim group in 2014.89 They achieved an EQEmax of 20.9%, 27.6%, 27.1% and 35.6% for red PhOLEDs using an NPB:B3PYMPM exciplex forming co-host doped with fac-Ir(phq)3 (tris(2-phenyl-1-quinoline)iridium(III)), Ir(mphq)2acac ((bis(2-(3,5-dimethyl-phenyl)quinoline)Ir(III)(acetylacetonate))), Ir(MDQ)2acac (bis(2-methyldibenzo-[f,h]-quinoxaline)Ir(III)(acetylacetonate)) or Ir(mphmq)2tmd ((bis(4-methyl-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinolin-e))Ir(III)(tetramethylheptadionate)), respectively. Quantum chemical calculations were used to thoroughly study the device performance and the intermolecular interactions. Among these dyes, except that fac-Ir(phq)3 had homoleptic ligands, the other three were all heteroleptic iridium complexes (HICs). First, they carried out the geometry optimizations of the NPB/B3PYMPM/red dye ternary systems by DFT calculations based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.90 Based on the results, they computed the pairwise binding energies of the hosts and the red dyes. It turned out that the binding energies between the HICs and the exciplex were much higher than the others. Then they optimized the binding geometries as shown in Fig. 12(b). For the HIC dyes, there were clear interactions with the exciplex molecules. The isosurfaces of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) revealed highly electropositive spots of the HIC dyes, which were responsible for the strong Coulomb interactions between the electronegative aromatic planes of the host molecules and the methyl groups or the hydrogens of the HICs. As a result, it favored a transition dipole moment of the HICs in the exciplex co-host. This phenomenon was also proved by the horizontal orientational factor Θ, which was calculated to be 0.70, 0.77, 0.80, and 0.82 for fac-Ir(phq)3, Ir(mphq)2acac, Ir(MDQ)2acac, and Ir(mphmq)2tmd, respectively. By contrast, the Θ value of fac-Ir(phq)3 was only 0.70, as calculated from the angle dependent PL data (Fig. 12(d)). The device configurations were ITO (100 nm)/TAPC (75 nm)/NPB (10 nm)/NPB:B3PYMPM:3.5 mol% red dyes (30 nm)/B3PYMPM (10 nm)/B3PYMPM:2 wt% Rb2CO3 (45 nm)/Al (100 nm). The red PhOLED based on Ir(mphmq)2tmd achieved an EQEmax of 35.6% at a luminance of 350 cd m−2, which was 1.5 times greater than that of the most efficient red PhOLED based on a single host.39,91,92 This publication gave us a comprehensive study template for analysing the dipole moment and the intermolecular interactions of PhOLEDs using exciplex forming co-hosts. Liao et al. studied the carrier and exciton confinement in a mixed exciplex host, comprising a spiro derivative donor, N,N-10-triphenyl-10H-spiro[acridine-9,9′-fluoren]-3′-amine (SAFDPA), and an electron-accepting material Bphen, doped with a red phosphorescent emitter, Ir(MDQ)2acac.93 The OLED device showed a low turn-on voltage of 2.24 V at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and a high PE of 31.8 lm W−1. Exciplex forming co-hosts are also a promising strategy in enhancing the performance of near-infrared (NIR) OLEDs. Recently, Adachi et al. reported a solution processed NIR OLED using a neodymium complex, Nd(TTA)3Phen, as the emitter and a TCTA:SPPO13 exciplex as the host.94 Considering that no additional EL peaks were detected in an OLED with an EML of SPPO13:TCTA:Nd(TTA)3Phen blend film, it was believed the NIR emission was from the sensitization of Nd3+ ions by the exciplex singlet and triplet. The PLQY of the SPPO13:TCTA:Nd(TTA)3Phen film was as high as 1.2%, which was much higher than that using the mCP host (0.4–0.5%). The device exhibited NIR emission peaking at 890, 1060 and 1330 nm from Nd3+, with an EQEmax of 0.034%. It should be pointed out that though the results showed that an exciplex can serve as an effective host for NIR OLEDs, the maximum luminance of neodymium complexes at the present research stage is not high enough for commercial applications. Therefore, further investigations are needed to boost the NIR OLED performance.

In 2015, Zhao et al. reported a high-efficiency red fluorescent OLED using DCJTB (4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran) as the dopant and TCTA:3P-T2T as the exciplex forming co-host.95 The sensitized red fluorescent OLED with a low doping ratio of 1.0 wt% of DCJTB showed a maximum luminance of 22767 cd m−2, a CEmax of 22.7 cd A−1, a PEmax of 21.5 lm W−1, and an EQEmax of 10.15%. Wong et al. adopted a Tris-PCz:CN-T2T (Tris-PCz, 9,9′,9′′-triphenyl-9H,9′H,9′′H-3,3′:6′,3′′-tercarbazole; CN-T2T, 3′,3′′′,3′′′′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(([1,1′-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile))) exciplex as a host doped with 1 wt% of red fluorescent emitters rubrene and DCJTB to achieve an EQEmax of 6.9% and 9.7%, respectively.96 Recently, Liao et al. used the same fluorescent emitter DCJTB doped in a TCTA:B4PyMPM (4,6-bis[3,5-(dipyrid-4-yl)phenyl]-2-methylpyridine) exciplex forming co-host to fabricate a high-efficiency red fluorescent OLED. An innovation of our work was to dope additional energy transfer assistant TADF molecules into the TCTA:B4PyMPM:DCJTB system. We used TADF emitters with the TADF material serving as a double dopant sensitizer, providing additional FRET processes and boosting the device EQE to 12.9%, which was the highest value at that moment. The experimental details will be covered in Section 5.
3.3 High-efficiency blue OLEDs based on exciplex hosts with high triplet ET
As exciplex forming co-hosts have achieved so much success in green and red OLEDs, there were also reports on blue exciplex hosts with higher exciplex energies. Before exciplexes were used as energy transfer hosts for dopants, the exciplex emission in devices is usually red-shifted. The successful energy harvesting of exciplexes was realized long before researchers used exciplexes as regular and efficient hosts.8–11 However, the exciplex energy discovered then was not high enough for efficient energy transfer to blue emitters. As the exciplex triplet or singlet energies can be predicted by the oxidation and reduction energies of the electron-donating and-accepting materials,18 exciplex hosts for blue emitters should consist of high-lying LUMO acceptors and deep-lying HOMO donors. Besides, both the donor and acceptor should have higher T1/S1 levels than those of the blue dopant to prevent back-energy-transfer. In 2014, Kim et al. used a mixed exciplex forming co-host, mCP:B3PYMPM, doped with a typical blue phosphorescent emitter, FIrpic.22 Though the triplet energy of B3PYMPM (2.68 eV) was lower than that of the exciplex (2.97 eV), they achieved a high EQEmax of 29.5% and a low turn-on voltage of 3.0 V, which mainly, as they proved, benefited from the increased transitional dipole moment. Later, in 2015, similar work by the Kim group used mCP as the electron donor to form an exciplex with another acceptor having a high T1 of 2.99 eV, PO-T2T.34 It turned out that T1 of the exciplex (2.64 eV) was much smaller than both those of mCP (2.94 eV) and PO-T2T (2.99 eV), and slightly higher than that of the dopant FIrpic (2.63 eV). As shown in Fig. 13, they claimed that the excitation energy in the exciplex system can be well confined and then transferred to the dopant. As a result, the device achieved an EQEmax of 30.3%, a PEmax of 66 lm W−1, and low driving voltages of 2.75, 3.29, and 4.65 V at 100, 1000, and 10000 cd m−2, respectively. Overall, a preferable strategy for a blue exciplex host is to select a donor and acceptor with appropriate energy levels and higher T1 than that of the formed exciplex to prevent back-energy-transfer.

In 2018, Tian et al. compared the device performance of two exciplexes: one was formed of a bipolar donating material 2,6-bis(3-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)pyridine (26DCzPPy) and the acceptor B4PyMPM and the other was formed of common donating host mCP and B4PyMPM.46 The blue PhOLEDs had a structure of ITO/HAT-CN (5 nm)/TAPC (30 nm)/TCTA (10−X nm)/26DCzPPy (X nm)/26DCzPPy:B4PyMPM:FIrpic (1:1, 15%, 20 nm)/B4PyMPM (45 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/Al (120 nm), with X equal to 10, 5, 2, and 0 for Device D, E, F and G, respectively. The chemical structures and energy diagram of the exciplex are shown in Fig. 14(a). The blue PhOLEDs using FIrpic as an emitter achieved a low operating voltage of 3.06 V at a luminance of 100 cd m−2, a high PE of 43.1 lm W−1 at 0.2 mA cm−2, and Commission International de I’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.35). More importantly, the blue PhOLED based on the 26DCzPPy:B4PyMPM exciplex showed less green emission than that of the mCP:B4PyMPM exciplex,40 making it more promising to be applied in WOLEDs to contribute more blue emission as will be introduced in Section 4.

Nonetheless, high-efficiency blue PhOLEDs can also be fabricated by using exciplexes consisting of donors and acceptors with smaller triplet energies than that of the exciplex. In 2017, the Kim group reported an exciplex forming co-host having a high triplet energy of 3.0 eV, formed by mCP (T1 = 2.9 eV) and BM-A10 (T1 = 2.8 eV).35 The exciplex served as an efficient host for a deep blue phosphorescent emitter FCNIr, with T1 2.73 eV, peaking at 455 nm, achieving an EQEmax of 24% with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.21), and a turn-on voltage of 2.9 V. Despite this, the energy transfer might not be sufficient due to the nonconfined exciplex T1 or undesirable charge balance. Such a deduction was based on the low PLQY of the exciplex (17%) and the short transient PL lifetime (86 ns), which were much smaller than those of normal exciplexes. Therefore, the major issue at present for deep blue exciplex forming co-hosts is the limited diversity of electron donors and acceptors with fairly high triplet energy. It is worth noting that the efficiency roll-off of this device with an EML of mCP:BM-A10:FCNIr is larger than that of the mCPPO1 host,97 even if they had similar EQEmax. We believe to further improve the performance of deep-blue PhOLEDs based on exciplex hosts, donors/acceptors with higher T1 should be used instead. Exciplex forming co-hosts can also be applied in solution processed blue OLEDs. In 2017, Liao et al. reported two novel wide-bandgap and high T1 electron-accepting materials, 1,4-phenylenebis(diphenyl-phosphine oxide) (2PO) and (phenylphosphoryl)-bis(4,1-phenylene)bis(diphenylphosphine oxide (3PO)).98 The materials formed mixed exciplexes with TCTA, which were appropriate to serve as hosts for blue phosphorescent emitter FIrpic using a solution processing method. The formation of uniform morphologies and charge transport balance had been realized and the blue PhOLEDs showed a CEmax of 29.2 and 26.8 cd A−1 using 2PO and 3PO as the acceptor, respectively.
The Kim group also tested an exciplex host in TADF OLEDs. In 2016, they reported the performance of a blue TADF OLED based on 2CzPN can be improved by using an mCP:PO15 (2,8-bis-(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzothiophene) exciplex host.48 The device achieved an EQEmax of 21.8%, which was much better than that based on a single host (13.6%). Exciplex hosts have achieved success in green and red hyperfluorescent OLEDs to beat the efficiency limit, however, challenges remain in constructing exciplex hosts with high ET for blue hyperfluorescent OLEDs.
4. Exciplex hosts for white OLEDs
Recently, WOLEDs have attracted tremendous attention owing to their promising applications in high-quality displays and solid-state lighting.99–103 Excellent white light, which requires a broad and continuous spectrum covering the entire visible range (380 to 780 nm), can be formed by mixing complementary (e.g., blue and orange or yellow) or primary colors (blue, green and red).103,104 Several significant approaches have been proposed to develop high-performance WOLEDs, including precisely manipulating carriers-and-excitons in phosphorescent/fluorescent hybrid WOLEDs,44,75,103,105,106 fully utilizing triplets by introducing blue emission with high T1,75,102,107 subtly designing simplified exciton-confining structures,46,102,108 adopting a gradient doping strategy,44 and employing tandem architectures.100,109,110 Notably, exciplex-based WOLEDs with excellent properties are emerging with many efforts.46,108,109,111–114 As described above, exciplexes can not only improve the performance of monochromatic OLEDs,34,84,115 but also form exciplex-based WOLEDs, which can exhibit high efficiency, low driving voltage, low efficiency roll-off, and high color rendering index (CRI).44,46,108,114,116–118 Furthermore, exciplexes were successfully and flexibly applied as emitters or hosts in WOLEDs with single-/multi-EML and tandem structures in tremendous application prospects.45,75,109,114,116,119 The following will address WOLEDs employing exciplex hosts with different structures and emission mechanisms. The device performance of the WOLEDs based on exciplex hosts is listed in Table 2.

4.1 Single-EML WOLEDs
Forming single-emitting layer (S-EML) WOLEDs was regarded as one of the most efficient and simplest methods to obtain white light by incorporating complementary or primary emitters into one single layer. The concentration of each emitter should be precisely controlled in one single host material to reasonably allocate the excitons for exhibiting more balanced and efficient white emission.63,108,120–122 Accordingly, the applications of exciplex co-hosts in hybrid and all-phosphorescent WOLEDs with S-EML structure are presented in the following sub-sections.

4.1.1 Hybrid WOLEDs with single-EML structure. 
In hybrid WOLEDs with S-EML structure, a blue exciplex serves as both host and emitter in combination with phosphors (e.g., orange or green/red) to emit white light, where incomplete energy transfer between the blue exciplex and the dopants generally occurs.75,105,114,116 To achieve high-performance WOLEDs, a blue exciplex is required having higher T1 than that of the orange or green/red emitters, allowing efficient energy transfer.33,85,93,123 The concentrations of the phosphorescent dopants are usually very low, which guarantees the residual energy of the exciplex and emission of blue light under recombination. Otherwise solely guest emission can be observed.116 An exciplex system is commonly formed by combining hole-transporting and electron-transporting materials, which can result in bipolar charge transportation and a “zero” barrier architecture.88,124 This is beneficial to boost the achievements of WOLEDs with high efficiencies and low power-consumption. Furthermore, due to the intrinsic TADF properties with small ΔEST, both singlet and triplet excitons can be harvested in exciplex forming co-host systems. Therefore, a 100% IQE and desirable white light emission can be simultaneously achieved in hybrid WOLEDs with S-EML structure. And blue exciplex-based WOLEDs can perform with improved efficiencies compared with conventional blue fluorescent material based hybrid WOLEDs.
Notable examples include the work by Lee's group in 2015, in which they implemented an effective strategy to simultaneously harvest singlet and triplet excitons by using the blue exciplex CDBP:PO-T2T (CDBP, 4,4′-bis(9-carbazolyl)-2,2′-dimethylbi-phenyl) as an exciplex host and blue emitter.75 Green and red phosphor emitters of Ir(ppy)2acac and Ir(MDQ)2acac were doped into the blue exciplex co-host at low concentrations. Finally, warm light emission with an EQEmax of 25.5% was realized in this device, and the CIE coordinates showed a mild shift from (0.41, 0.45) to (0.38, 0.42) when the luminance increased from 10 to 10000 cd m−2.75 For the emission mechanism, the management of singlet/triplet excitons in an S-EML hybrid WOLED is shown in Fig. 15. By using a TADF exciplex for the blue fluorescent emission, a theoretical 100% IQE can be achieved because of the energy transfer of the triplet excitons to the singlet excitons by RISC in this system.
 Fig. 15  Simplified schematic diagrams for exciton management in single-EML hybrid WOLEDs based on (a) conventional blue fluorophores and (b) blue TADF emitters with low dopant concentrations. Zone I (green circle) represents the diffusion zone of singlet excitons, where all singlet and triplet are harvested by the green/red phosphors for green/red emission. Zone II (pink circle) represents the triplet diffusion zone, where triplet excitons are harvested by the phosphor molecules for green/red emission and the out-of-range singlet excitons can only be harvested by the blue fluorophore for blue emission. In the uncovered Zone III, for conventional blue fluorophores, all the excitons cannot be harvested by the phosphor molecules and only singlets are used for fluorescence, resulting in 25% IQE; but for TADF blue emitters, the triplets can be up-converted into S1 for light emission together with the directly generated singlet excitons, realizing 100% IQE. RS and RT are respectively the diffusion lengths of singlet and triplet excitons; compared with a conventional host, RT of the TADF host is smaller due to the fast competition process of RISC.

Meanwhile, a typical hybrid WOLED with S-EML structure, ITO/TPAPB (30 nm)/TPAPB:TPBi:4.0 wt% Ir(2-phq)3 (30 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al, was reported via a blue exciplex system combined with a new donor material TPAPB ((4-dimesitylboryl)phenyltriphenylamine) and TPBi.125 The blue exciplex system was proved to be efficient both as a blue fluorescent emitter and as a sensitizer for orange phosphor Ir(2-phq)3 (tris(2-phenylquinoline)iridium(III)) simultaneously. The WOLED exhibited excellent efficiencies with an EQEmax, CEmax and PEmax of 15.7 ± 0.3%, 42.5 ± 0.3 cd A−1, and 29.6 ± 0.2 lm W−1, respectively.
Other blue exciplexes were also introduced for developing high-performance WOLEDs with simple structure via an incomplete energy transfer mechanism. For example, 9,9′-biphenyl-3,3′-diylbis-9H-carbazole (mCBP) and PO-T2T were employed as electron donor and acceptor components to form a blue exciplex forming co-host.116 A WOLED based on the mCBP:PO-T2T exciplex was fabricated with a structure of ITO/MoO3 (3 nm)/mCBP (20 nm)/mCBP:PO-T2T:0.5 wt% Ir(bt)2(acac) (20 nm)/PO-T2T (40 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (Ir(bt)2(acac), bis(2-phenyl-1,3-benzothiozolato-N,C2′) iridium (acetylacetonate)). By redistributing the energy of the exciplex and doping the orange phosphor Ir(bt)2(acac) into the blue exciplex co-host at low concentrations, the WOLED performed with an EQEmax and a turn-on voltage of 22.21% and 2.5 V, respectively.
In 2017, Ma and co-workers reported a S-EML hybrid WOLED with a blue exciplex CDBP:PO-T2T by doping an orange guest, PO-01, with a low concentration of 0.3%.114 As demonstrated in Fig. 16, the FRET is dominant in this system rather than DET owing to the low concentration of PO-01. Meanwhile, the incomplete energy transfer caused the blue emission of the exciplex to be displayed as well as the orange emission of PO-01. The resulting complementary-color hybrid WOLED realized an EQEmax and PEmax of 29.0% and 108.3 lm W−1, respectively, and retained 15.8% and 33.4 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2.

4.1.2 All-phosphorescent WOLEDs with a single-EML. 
Compared with hybrid WOLEDs in which conventional fluorescent materials are introduced, all-phosphorescent WOLEDs can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons generated through electric excitation, and have the potential to achieve high-efficiency WOLEDs.52,126–129 To confine the excitons and prevent energy loss in all-phosphorescent WOLEDs, T1 of the exciplex forming co-host should be higher than that of the blue phosphorescent emitter. In order to achieve high-performance WOLEDs with an exciplex co-host, Liao et al. have carefully selected donor and acceptor materials, and a high-performance blue exciplex, mCP:B4PyMPM (4,6-bis[3,5-(dipyrid-4-yl)phenyl]-2-methylpyrimi-dine), with high T1 (2.75 eV), was proposed.108 Blue phosphor FIrpic and complementary color emitter PO-01 were doped into the exciplex host to give desirable warm white emission. Fig. 17 shows the device structure and performance of the S-EML WOLEDs. The simplified device structure with a high T1 donor/acceptor prohibited exciton leakage so that full utilization of excitons by DET and FRET from the exciplex co-host to dopants FIrpic and PO-01 can be achieved. The resulting WOLED delivered an extraordinarily high forward-viewing PE of 105.0 lm W−1 and an EQEmax of about 30% (without out-coupling techniques). Furthermore, the well-matched energy alignment rendered a device showing an extremely low turn-on voltage (∼2.5 V). This work provided a constructive avenue for achieving high-performance WOLEDs with a S-EML by introducing a high T1 blue exciplex mCP:B4PyMPM.

Later, Zhao et al. were inspired to use a novel exciplex forming co-host formed by combining 3,3′-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (m-CBP) and B4PyPPM.130 By optimizing the doping ratio of m-CBP and B4PyMPM (a molar ratio of 1:1), an exciplex forming co-host with balanced carrier transport was developed. Two-color WOLEDs with a structure of ITO/TAPC (40 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/m-CBP:B4PyMPM:15 wt% FIrpic (W1) or F3Irpic (W2):0.25 wt% Ir(MDQ)2acac (30 nm)/TmPyPB (45 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated by simply doping blue or cyan phosphorescent dopants with red dye into the exciplex host. Both devices exhibited lower turn-on voltages of 2.5 V than that of traditional host based WOLEDs. Furthermore, maximum EQEs of 23.9% and 26.9% were achieved in device W1 and W2, respectively. The exciplex host is effective in redistributing the singlets and triplets in the hybrid S-EML WOLEDs. However, the devices suffered from severe efficiency roll-off at high luminance. It is also challenging to maintain stable EL emission and high-quality white emission at the same time.

4.2 Multi-EML WOLEDs
In WOLEDs with a multi-EML structure, multiple emitters (e.g., emitter spectrum covering red/green/blue or orange/blue emission) are separately doped into individual layers to produce white light.45,46,102,105,114,117 Therefore, the flexible manipulation of each emitting layer and effective management of the exciton distribution can be achieved with multi-EML structure. Accordingly, the quality of the white emission is sensitive to each luminous layer. Hence, it is crucial to maintain the balanced illumination of different layers. Many efforts have been made to realize desirable and color-balancing WOLEDs by manipulating the charge and excitons in a multi-EML structure. Based on the multi-EML and exciplex forming co-host concepts, high-performance hybrid and all-phosphorescent WOLEDs with excellent efficiencies, low operating voltage, and high CRI were realized.44–46,105,131

4.2.1 Hybrid WOLEDs with multi-EML structure. 
A common approach to obtain multi-EML structure-based WOLEDs is to incorporate a combination of a blue fluorophore and orange (red/green) phosphorescent emitters.132–134 And the efficiency and color quality are related to the diffusion of triplet excitons in multi-EML-based hybrid WOLEDs.134–136 The exciton diffusion length LD is expressed by the following equation: (5)where D and τ represent the diffusion coefficient and effective exciton lifetime, respectively.112 As the triplet excitons exhibit a lifetime about 106 times longer than that of the singlet one (1–10 ns),89,137 the triplet diffusion length is larger compared with the singlet one (<10 nm) by about one order of magnitude. Hence, in order to achieve a balanced spectrum and high-performance, it is significant to spatially separate the singlet and triplet excitons respectively into the blue fluorescent material and the phosphorescent emitter (e.g., red/green or orange) in multi-EML WOLEDs.132,134,138 Recently, interlayer-based hybrid WOLEDs were fabricated by inserting an HTL or ETL between the exciton generation zone and phosphorescent emitting layers.132,134,138–140 The introduction of the interlayer can effectively improve the utilization of excitons to enhance the efficiencies. However, some other influences should be considered such as: (1) it consumes energy when applying a voltage across the interlayer; (2) the interlayer can increase the complexity of the architecture, which impedes the application of WOLEDs; (3) the formation of additional exciplexes is not negligible, which can impair the device efficiency; and (4) the unstable interlayer will degrade the lifetime of WOLEDs.
Fortunately, interlayer-free hybrid WOLEDs have been discussed by incorporating TADF exciplexes as fluorescent emitting layers or hosts. Liu et al. reported a new architecture for high-performance hybrid WOLEDs by using a blue exciplex forming co-host to serve as a fluorescent emitting layer to prepare interlayer-free WOLEDs.105 The exciplex was combined by mixing a bipolar host 26DCzPPy with an electron-transporting material PO-T2T. In this exciplex-based system, the management of exciton diffusion was not strictly required as in conventional OLEDs. The reason was that the triplet excitons of the exciplex failing to diffuse to the phosphorescent emitters will be upconverted into the singlet state for blue emission through RISC. Hence the utilization efficiency of excitons for emission can be enhanced. Finally, a series of high-performance WOLEDs were prepared by using 26DCzPPy:PO-T2T as the blue fluorescent emitting layer and 26DCzPPy:Ir(MDQ)2acac as the phosphorescent emitting layer. These two-color WOLEDs exhibited a low turn-on voltage of 2.5–3.3 V. And a hybrid WOLED with an EQEmax and a high CRI of 19.3% and 77, respectively, were achieved by using an exciplex-based multi-EML structure as shown in Fig. 18.

Recently, it was reported that TADF emitters and exciplexes could be combined to fabricate high-performance WOLEDs. A blue TADF material bicarbazole derivative 4,4′-(9H,9′H-[3,3′-bicarbazole]-9,9′-diyl)bis(3-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile) (pCNBCzoCF3) was synthesized and combined with a star-shaped material m-MTDATA to form an orange exciplex.141 A series of high-efficiency “warm-white” OLEDs were fabricated by combining the blue TADF emission from pCNBCzoCF3 and exciplex emission from the pCNBCzoCF3/m-MTDATA interface. The best WOLED performed with a high brightness of 40900 cd m−2 (at 15 V), a CE of 53.8 cd A−1, and an EQE of 18.8%. Liu et al. reported a simplified, high-performance, and doping free WOLED by combining an interface exciplex with a TADF emitter.142 As demonstrated in Fig. 19, TAPC and TmPyPB were used as the p-type transporting and n-type transporting layer, respectively, to design the p-i-n WOLEDs. Besides, a doping-free structure was obtained by inserting a 2 nm thin layer of DDCzTrz between the TAPC and TmPyPB layers. The combination of orange emission of the exciplex TAPC/DDCzTrz interface and blue TADF emission ensures white light. Besides, S1 and T1 of the exciplex were lower than those of TAPC (2.87 eV) and DDCzTrz (2.53 eV), which prevented exciton quenching between the exciplex and the donor and the acceptor, ensuring efficient orange emission. Owing to the barrier-free structure and high PLQY of DDCzTrz (0.66), remarkably, a WOLED with a CRI of 91, an EQEmax of 28.4%, and a PEmax of 68.5 lm W−1 was realized. This simple structure by using TADF and an exciplex unlocked a new strategy to develop high-efficiency and high-quality WOLEDs.

4.2.2 All-phosphorescent WOLEDs with multi-EML structure. 
In all-phosphorescent WOLEDs with multi-EML structure, the blue emission is crucial for the performance of devices. An exciplex has intrinsic advantages to act as the host of a blue emitter in WOLEDs, such as reducing the operating voltage, leading to high PE. The blue phosphorescent emitter FIrpic with a T1 of 2.62 eV is commonly used for the blue emission in all-phosphor WOLEDs. In order to improve the quality of the blue emission for high-performance all-phosphor WOLEDs, enormous efforts have been made.44,46,52,53,112,143
In Liao's work, a novel blue exciplex forming co-host was designed by combining 26DCzPPy with B4PyMPM.46 This exciplex has higher T1 than that of blue emitter FIrpic, which is beneficial to fabricate exciplex host-based blue devices.60 They optimized the device structures and fabricated injection and transport barrier-free blue OLEDs. The device structure was ITO/HAT-CN (5 nm)/TAPC (30 nm)/TCTA (8 nm)/26DCzPPy (2 nm)/26DCzPPy:B4PyMPM:FIrpic (1:1, 15 wt% 20 nm)/B4PyMPM (15 nm)/Bphen:0.1 wt% LiH (25 nm)/Al (120 nm). Furthermore, phosphorescent emitter PO-01 as the complementary color for orange emission was doped in the adjacent singlet host of 26DCzPPy with various low concentrations based on the blue device. The energy diagram and structure of the WOLEDs are displayed in Fig. 20. The optimized devices showed maximum EQEs exceeding 20% and low turn-on voltages of about 2.6 V, and maintain about 4.0 V at 10000 cd m−2. They achieved a maximum PE, CE, and EQE of 89.0 lm W−1, 79.0 cd A−1, and 27.3% at 100 cd cm−2, respectively, and 74 lm W−1, 73 cd A−1, and 25.3% at 1000 cd cm−2, respectively. The performance of the WOLEDs is displayed in Fig. 20(a), (b) and (d). The proposed device structure, in which excitons can be fully utilized for emission within the stable recombination zone, can favor low efficiency roll-off and high performance of the device. These results implied that the simple well-designed multi-EML structure employing the 26DCzPPy:B4PyMPM exciplex can offer a reasonable method for the application of WOLEDs.

Generally, T1 of the blue exciplex forming co-host should be higher than those of the blue emitters for efficient energy transfer. Otherwise, it is undesirable to fabricate WOLEDs.34,116,144 However, it always fails to choose suitable materials to form blue exciplex forming co-hosts as we mentioned earlier. In order to achieve high-PE WOLEDs by directly combining materials and the co-host structure, a new gradient exciplex (AGE) strategy was reported for developing high-efficiency WOLEDs in Liao's work.44 Two novel spiro-type materials STPy3 (T1 = 2.82 eV) and STPy4 (T1 = 2.81 eV) were designed to combine with PO-T2T to form exciplexes. Theoretically, both exciplexes were unsuitable to serve as the host of FIrpic as they exhibited lower T1 than that of the blue emitter (FIrpic). However, we found that by adjusting the STPy3/STPy4:PO-T2T mixing ratio to form an AGE system in the blue emission layer, the generated excitons could be rationally distributed in a consequently nonuniform doping profile. Finally, the WOLEDs were established as ITO/HAT-CN (10 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/gradient STPy3 or STPy4:PO-T2T (mixing ratio from 0 to 50 mol%):FIrpic (15 vol%, 20 nm)/STPy3 (W3) or STPy4 (W4):PO-T2T:PO-01 (6 vol%, 2 nm)/PO-T2T (45 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/Al (120 nm). And the complementary orange emitter PO-01 was doped into the exciplex co-host (mixing ratio 1:1). The optimized WOLED device W3/W4 exhibited state-of-the-art maximum EQEs and PEs of 25.6/28.2% and 86.0/92.0 lm W−1, respectively, which showed better performance than that of conventional single host-based (such as STPy3 and STPy4) bicolor WOLEDs. Notably, the turn-on voltage for AGE-WOLEDs was only 2.3 V. The results of the WOLEDs are shown in Fig. 21. This work offered a new strategy to fabricate exciplex-based WOLEDs in which exciplex co-hosts with smaller exciplex energy than the blue dyes can also be efficient for WOLEDs.

In terms of spectral performance, the CRI is a crucial standard for high-quality WOLEDs. A desirable lighting application can reproduce the true colors of various objects, thus, a CRI above 80 is required.134,145,146 Compared with ternary or quaternary systems combining more emitters (e.g. blue/green/red, even blue/green/orange/red) to generate white light, creating binary system WOLEDs with a high CRI over 80 is a bottleneck. Fortunately, Liao's group have taken steps to solve this problem by utilizing a color remedy strategy (CRS) via an exciplex.45 With the beneficial contribution of the exciplex, the CRIs of the resulting binary-emissive WOLEDs can be enhanced from 63 to the 80 threshold. To realize white light, common blue (FIrpic) and red (Ir(MDQ)2(acac)) phosphorescent emitters were employed in the multi-EML structure. A bipolar high-triplet-energy material diphenyl(10-phenyl-10H-spiro[acridine-9,9′-fluoren]-2′-yl)phosphine oxide (POSTF) and STPy4 were used as donors combined with another acceptor PO-T2T. Finally, the green emission component of FIrpic was enhanced in the exciplex-based (POSTF:PO-T2T and STPy4:PO-T2T) WOLEDs, which leads to a high CRI above 80 (depicted in Fig. 22). Moreover, all of the CRS-based WOLEDs have a superior EQE of 20%, and the EQEmax is 25%. Thus, the exciplex not only improved the PE, EQE, and roll-off but also enhanced the CRI and color quality of WOLEDs.

For W1–W6, the donor was POSTF and the corresponding thicknesses of the red EML are 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0. Device W7 was a STPy4-based device (x = 0.8). Reproduced from ref. 45.

Multi-EML WOLEDs utilizing exciplex hosts can be flexible to control the monochromatic portion of the EL spectrum. What is challenging is that it is hard to maintain high EQEs simultaneously, as excitons prefer to recombine in the orange or red EML.

4.3 Tandem WOLEDs
Tandem OLEDs, an OLED structure stacking multiple EL units electrically in series with an intermediate connector or charge generation unit (CGU), have attracted much academic and industry interest owing to their excellent merits, such as high CE and EQE, and long operational lifetime.109,110,119,147–152 However, the consequent high operating voltage and complex fabrication process are not negligible. Some monochromatic tandem OLEDs with low driving voltages by using exciplex forming co-hosts have been reported.
Tandem WOLEDs connect different color emitting units, so that the charge recombination of each hardly interferes. An all exciplex emission tandem WOLED using blue exciplex mCP:PO-T2T and a complementary orange exciplex DTAF:PO-T2T (DTAF, 9,9-di[4-(di-p-tolyl)aminophenyl]fluorine) has been reported by Chou et al.109 As shown in Fig. 23(a), the tandem structure had a configuration of two parallel blend layers as the intermediate connector. The structure of the optimized WOLEDs consisted of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/TPAC (20 nm)/mCP (15 nm)/mCP:PO-T2T (151, 20 nm)/PO-T2T (45 nm)/Liq (1 nm)/Al (1 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/DTAF (20 nm)/DTAF:PO-T2T (151, 20 nm)/PO-T2T (50 nm)/Liq (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 23), where Liq/Al/MoO3/DTAF was the intermediate connectors (holes and electrons are generated at the MoO3/DTAF interface), and PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid). Eventually, the WOLED employing the all-exciplex system exhibited an EQEmax and PEmax of 11.6% and 15.8 lm W−1, respectively. This was attributed to the localization of the movement of the charge recombination zone and elimination of the energy transfer between blue and yellow emission layers. The WOLED exhibited high quality and stable white emission with CIE values and a CRI of (0.29, 0.35) and 70, respectively. Therefore, the exciplex-based tandem WOLED provided a reliable strategy to develop high-performance WOLEDs.

Kim's group also reported a high-efficiency tandem WOLED by using exciplexes as hosts in 2014.52 The device structures were optimized through optical simulation to maximize the out-coupling of the emitted light. Two exciplexes TCTA:B3PYMPM and mCP:B3PYMPM were utilized as hosts for green/red emitter (Ir(ppy)2(tmd)/Ir-(mphmq)2(tmd)) and blue emitter FIrpic, respectively. The combination of Ir(ppy)2(tmd) and Ir-(mphmq)2(tmd) was used to achieve high-efficiency orange emission, as they have highly oriented triplet transition dipole moments along the horizontal direction and high PLQYs. A schematic diagram of the structure of tandem WOLEDs using the exciplex forming co-host is shown in Fig. 24(a). An efficient CGU composed of Rb2CO3-doped BPhen/HAT-CN/TAPC was employed in the exciplex-based structure. WOLED I/II with HAT-CN and p–mCP having thicknesses of 20/40 and 40/80 nm, respectively, displayed different performances and validated the simulation results experimentally. Tandem WOLED I exhibited a white EL spectrum with a high CRI of 71 and EQEmax/PEmax of 46%/49 lm W−1. The tandem WOLED II had a white EL spectrum with a CRI of 63 and EQEmax/PEmax of 54.3%/63 lm W−1 (Fig. 24(b) and (c)). These excellent results indicated that the combination of an exciplex and tandem structure can contribute to high-performance WOLEDs.

Based on the strategy of exciplex forming co-hosts and tandem structure to improve the performance of WOLEDs, Meng et al. fabricated simplified tandem WOLEDs using ultrathin emitters using the energy transfer from interface blue exciplexes (TAPC:TmPyPB) to the emitters. FIrpic and PO-01 were applied as blue and orange undoped ultrathin emissive layers (UEMLs).119 The device structure of the tandem WOLED is shown in Fig. 25. Here, TAPC and TmPyPB were selected as the donor and acceptor to form the exciplex owing to their high hole/electron transport mobility and suitable HOMO and LUMO levels. An efficient CGU Bphen:LiNH2/HAT-CN was employed in the tandem WOLEDs. As depicted in the energy transfer process of Fig. 25, the excitons generated on interface exciplexes can transfer to FIrpic and PO-01 for white emission because of the higher T1 of TAPC (2.87 eV) and TmPyPB (2.78 eV) than that of FIrpic (2.62 eV) and PO-01 (2.2 eV). By introducing the exciplex in the tandem structure, the tandem WOLED achieved a CEmax and EQEmax of 41.5 cd A−1 and 18.59%, respectively, benefiting from the balanced carrier injection and reduced operating voltage. Moreover, in terms of healthy lighting applications, it is an advantage that the exciplex-based tandem WOLEDs can easily emit a warm white spectrum with a low correlative color temperature of 3686–4700 K, while maintaining high power efficiency due to the reduced operating voltage.

Tandem devices are an effective method to increase the EQE and lifetime of OLEDs. With the simple device configuration of exciplex host based OLED units, it is possible to reduce the number of interfaces and charge injection barriers in tandem devices. By careful device engineering, we think the power efficiency of tandem WOLEDs utilizing exciplex hosts can reach more than 100 lm W−1. Efforts should also be made to simplify the device configurations for lower cost.
5. Exciplex hosts for hyperfluorescent OLEDs
In conventional fluorescent OLEDs (FOLEDs), only 25% of generated excitons can be used for radiative emission according to the spin-statistics, resulting in a theoretical IQEmax of 25%. Therefore, to fully utilize all the excitons for electroluminescence is critically important for FOLEDs. The key point to achieve 100% IQE is to increase spin mixing of singlet and triplet states. To date, a thermally activated RISC mechanism has been reported in exciplexes, indicating a sufficient RISC process may convert triplets to singlets, which can be harvested by fluorescent dyes for lighting purposes. The potential of exciplexes as an effective exciton harvesting approach for fluorescent emitters has been reported up to now. The exciplex can be utilized as an exciton generation part, and then the energy of the generated excitons will transfer to conventional fluorescent dyes for radiative emission. Notably, two requirements should be considered for efficient energy transfer between the exciplex and the fluorescent emitters: (1) minimizing the charge trapping on fluorescent dopants and harvesting most of the excitons by the exciplex forming co-host; and (2) preventing the fluorescent dopants from harvesting the triplet excitons directly.87
One way to avoid direct carrier trapping and the generation of unwanted non-radiative triplet excitons on the fluorescent dopants is to separate the TADF exciplex and the fluorescent dopants. In this research field, Li et al. further studied the exciton formation of exciplex by inserting an interlayer with a thickness ranging from 0 to 4 nm to separate the HTL and ETL.153 As shown in Fig. 26(a), three typical exciton formation processes are illustrated: (1) an intramolecular CT exciton for a closely bound electron–hole pair in a single molecule, (2) an intermolecular CT exciton for a weakly bound electron–hole pair in contacting donor and acceptor molecules, and (3) a spatially separated electron–hole pair in spatially separated donor and acceptor molecules. In an exciplex, the exciton formation mostly belongs to intermolecular CT excitons. The interlayer can spatially separate the hole-transporting material and electron-transporting material to play a role of adjusting the CT exciton radius and enlarging the exciton distribution region. In this situation, long-range coupled electron–hole pairs act as an emission center or an exciton donor for conventional fluorescent emitters. This strategy significantly separated the exciton generation and energy releasing areas, and avoided carrier trapping by the fluorescent emitters doped in the p-type HTL and the generation of unwanted non-radiative triplet excitons. Fig. 26(b) shows the energy level diagram of the device structure. In contrast to the device without the interlayer, the devices with an inserted 4 nm or thinner mCP film showed enhanced luminescence and reduced efficiency roll-off. The devices based on this strategy achieved a remarkable EQEmax near 15% due to the avoidance of the direct carrier trapping and DET process by doping the conventional fluorescent dye tetraphenyldibenzoperifl-anthene (DBP) into the adjacent HTL (TAPC).

To satisfy the aforementioned two requirements, the following two strategies can be applied: (1) using a TADF exciplex host with a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) close to those of the fluorescent dopant to minimize exciton-trapping; and (2) adopting an extremely low concentration to minimize triplet–triplet energy transfer from the host to the dopant. Owing to the barrier free carrier-injection/transport from the adjacent transport layers to the exciplex, exciplexes are actually a candidate for one of the most promising hosts for fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes. A large spectral overlap between the absorption spectrum of the fluorescent dopant and the PL spectra of exciplexes is always required to facilitate efficient singlet to singlet state FRET between the exciplex and the fluorescent emitter. Moreover, exciplexes with TADF characteristics employed as hosts and sensitizers in the meantime have attracted more attention. Liu et al. fabricated the first OLED using a conventional fluorescent dopant sensitized by a TADF exciplex host and claimed that the device efficiency can be predicted by the following formula: EQE = 1 × (25% + χT) × ηPL × ηoc(6)where χT is the triplet utilization for radiative decay, ηPL is the intrinsic PLQY of the emitting layer, and ηoc is the optical out-coupling factor, typically 20% ± 2%.87 As shown in Fig. 27, compared with the common host:fluorescent dopant system, the exciplex host:fluorescent dopant system has an additional RISC process. By efficient up-conversion from triplets to singlets followed by energy transfer from the exciplex to the fluorescent dopant, the triplets can be harvested indirectly after the RISC by fluorescent dyes for emission purposes. Therefore, a sufficiently high rate of RISC directly affects the value of χT. In addition, minimizing the triplet–triplet DET to avoid the formation of non-radiative triplets on the fluorescent dopant is also a critical factor to increase the triplet utilization. DET is a short-range energy transfer process, thus by choosing a suitably low dopant concentration, the short-range triplet–triplet energy transfer from the host to the guest can be effectively minimized. Liu et al. proposed that the quenching of the host's triplet is seriously influenced by the fluorescent dopant. To confirm this, they compared the optical properties and device performance of the TAPC:DPTPCz:x wt% C545T films with x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1. The transient fluorescence decay characteristics of the films were tested and both the short and the long decay times systematically increased with decreasing dopant concentration. The energy transfer efficiency (ΦET) was also calculated to be 0.62, 0.59, 0.41, and 0.28 for the 1, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 C545T-doped films, respectively. The synchronously decreasing ΦET value with the concentration presented can be explained by the increasing distance between the host and guest. Therefore, the triplet–triplet energy transfer from the host to the guest can be minimized by using a very low doping concentration. In terms of device performance, the maximum EQEs are 7.5%, 7.9%, 12.7%, and 14.5% for the 1, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2% C545T-doped devices, respectively, indicating nearly 100% triplet harvesting in the 0.4% and the 0.2% C545T-doped devices. The results revealed that using an extremely low dopant concentration is generally a useful strategy to guarantee effective harvesting by a conventional fluorescent dopant in a TADF exciplex host.

An exciplex can also act as a host and sensitizer for another exciplex, for example in 2019 Jeon et al. firstly demonstrated self-energy transfer in an exciplex and reported a system of ternary exciplexes with an EQE of 17.5% by mixing a p-type donor material, an n-type acceptor material, and a donor–acceptor type material together.154 The high-energy exciplex and the low-energy exciplex work as a host and dopant in the emitting layer, respectively. The internal exciplex to exciplex energy transfer induces efficient emission of the low-energy exciplex, resulting in high efficiency in the exciplex based OLEDs. A schematic diagram of energy transfer in the ternary exciplexes is shown in Fig. 28. The exciplex host should have high emission energy, while the exciplex dopant should possess low emission energy for energy transfer.

Very recently, Zhao et al. reported solution-processed exciplex OLEDs by utilizing the strategy of ternary exciplexes and achieved an impressively high EQE of 24%.155 Compared with vacuum-deposited exciplexes, solution-processed exciplexes induce stronger intermolecular interaction, benefitting the emission of exciplexes. As shown in Fig. 29, the ternary exciplex system contains a higher-energy TADF exciplex and a lower-energy TADF exciplex. The higher-energy TADF exciplex exhibited higher T1 than the lower one to prevent the leaking of triplet excitons. With the additional RISC route on the higher-energy TADF exciplex compared with common exciplexes, the up-conversion of triplet excitons can be more efficient. Therefore, many disadvantageous quenching processes such as TTA and TPA will be suppressed. In addition, an exciplex with higher CT states offers a platform for storage to decrease the exciton density on the lower CT states of the exciplex-emitter, which might avoid serious quenching effects on the exciplex-emitter. The pure exciplex based OLEDs achieved an EQEmax of 14.4%. To further improve the device performance, two other donors 3CzFDPhTz (3-(9-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-yl)-9-phenyl-9H-carbazole) and 9PhFDPhTz (9-(4-(9-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole) were separately added to the TPA-3:PO-T2T (TPA-3, (4-(9-(perfluoropyridin-4-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline)) to form ternary exciplexes. Finally, solution-processed exciplex OLEDs achieved a much higher EQEmax of 24% than the pure exciplex devices, indicating full harvesting of excitons in the ternary exciplex system.

In our previous work, it was found that the exciton radius in an interface exciplex can reach more than 4 nm.88 A high doping ratio might induce strong TTA and TPA quenching effects. In order to obtain high-efficiency fluorescent OLEDs using an exciplex host and a conventional fluorescent emitter, an extremely low doping concentration is always required because the generated excitons should not be directly trapped on the fluorescent dopant, and DET from the exciplex to fluorescent dyes should be prevented as much as possible. Furthermore, the TADF properties of the exciplex are critically important to sensitize the singlet emission of fluorescent emitters. Exciplex–guest systems are an effective method to realize high-efficiency exciplex-sensitized FOLEDs. Zhao et al. demonstrated a high-efficiency fluorescent emitter DCJTB with TADF exciplex TCTA:3P-T2T as the host.95 For the 1 wt% DCJTB doping concentration, a maximum EQE of 10.15% could be achieved, which was much higher than traditional red fluorescent OLEDs. The enhanced efficiency can be explained as a result of the efficient triplet exciton up-conversion of exciplex TCTA:3P-T2T and the energy transfer to DCJTB. Later, Hung et al. exploited an efficient exciplex Tris-PCz:CN-T2T as the host of DCJTB, and the red devices by doping 1 wt% DCJTB in the exciplex-forming co-host achieved an EQEmax of 9.7.96 However, due to the long exciton lifetime of triplets, there still existed a great degree of TTA and TPA in exciplex-based FOLEDs. To solve these problems, our group developed high-efficiency double-dopant TADF-sensitized FOLEDs with a strategy of doping assistant TADF molecules and a conventional fluorescent emitter into an exciplex-forming co-host.41 The schematic illustration of the emission mechanism is shown in Fig. 30. Theoretical analysis and calculations were carried out to understand the energy transfer process and the obtained experimental results. As shown in Fig. 30(a), the corresponding theoretical maximum internal EL efficiency for one-dopant TADF sensitized FOLEDs in an exciplex-forming co-host at low doping concentrations of fluorophores can be expressed by the following equation: [ΦEL(int),Ref]max = [ηHost0(S1) + ηHost0(T1)ΦHostRISC]·ΦFET1·ΦguestPL(7)For the novel double-dopant TADF-sensitized FOLEDs (Fig. 30(b)), the theoretical maximum EL efficiency can be expressed by: [ΦEL(int)]totalmax = {[ηHost0(S1) + ηHost0(T1)ΦHostRISC]·(ΦFET1 + ΦFET2·ΦFET3) + ηHost0(T1)·ΦDET2·ΦTADFRISC·ΦFET3}·ΦguestPL(8)Comparing (7) and (8), obviously, the theoretical maximum internal EL efficiency of double-dopant TADF-sensitized FOLEDs was higher than that of conventional one-dopant TADF-sensitized FOLEDs by adding two additional FRET processes (FRET2 and FRET3). Based on this understanding, we proposed that the effective method of double-dopant TADF sensitized FOLEDs would further enhance the performance of traditional fluorescent dyes. In contrast to conventional exciplex-sensitized FOLEDs, double-dopant TADF-sensitized FOLEDs possess two FRET processes in the energy transfer mechanism of the exciplex–assistant TADF molecule–fluorophore. It can further minimize the portion of triplets in the excited state system, which indeed helps harvest singlet and triplet excitons for luminescence. Then we employed this strategy in FOLEDs by using the exciplex TCTA:B4PyMPM doped with conventional red fluorophore DCJTB and four different TADF molecules (4CzIPN; 4CzPN, 1,2,3,4-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-5,6-dicyanobenzene; 4CzTPN, 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-3,6-dicyanobenzene or 4CzTPN-Ph, 2,3,5,6-tetrakis(3,6-diphenyl-carbazol-9-yl)-1,4-dicyanobenzene). The results confirmed our proposed strategy of double-dopant TADF-sensitized FOLEDs. It remarkably enhanced the efficiency; at a low doping concentration of 0.5 wt% DCJTB it achieved a high EQEmax of 12.9%, which was more than twice the EQE limit of 5% for traditional FOLEDs, and exhibited an obvious enhancement compared with one-dopant TADF sensitized FOLEDs.

Another way to harness triplet excited states by fluorescent dyes for efficient FOLEDs is to utilize phosphorescent molecules as the sensitizers. The phosphorescent co-dopant would bring about additional energy transfer from the exciplex to the phosphorescent sensitizer to harvest both singlets and triplets. Thus, the energy will be harvested by the fluorescent emitter through efficient FRET. Hence, the energy transfer from the exciplex to the fluorescent dopant would be more complete in general and there will be more singlet exciton energy converting to fluorescence. Kim et al. reported a method to combine the sensitizing effect and the induced heavy metal effect of the phosphor to increase the singlet to triplet ratio, followed by energy transfer to fluorescent dopant molecules.115Fig. 31 illustrates the excited state processes in the energy transfer system. In a system without a phosphorescent dopant, the triplets on the exciplex can be utilized by the RISC process of the exciplex, followed by energy transfer to the fluorescent emitters for luminescence. In a system with a phosphorescent dopant, one part of the triplets on the exciplex can be converted to singlets on the exciplex by the quick RISC process. The other part of the triplets can be harvested by the phosphorescent dopants through the FRET and DET from the exciplex to the phosphorescent emitter. Thus, this method results in an increasing portion of FRET energy transfer from the exciplex to the fluorescent emitters and a reduced triplet concentration in excited states. Moreover, due to the induced heavy atom effect of phosphorescent materials, spin mixing between the triplet and singlet states on the exciplex would be enhanced, accompanying a higher rate of the RISC process. To prove this concept, an exciplex composed of TCTA:B4PyMPM was doped with phosphorescent dopant Ir(ppy)2tmd, and fluorescent dopant DCJTB as the fluorescent exciton acceptor. The devices based on this method achieved a remarkably high EQEmax of 23.7%, representing highly efficient exciton harvesting for fluorescence emission. The photophysical data and device performance of the hyperfluorescent OLEDs are summarized in Table 3.

Hyperfluorescent OLEDs, especially blue fluorescent OLEDs, are very promising considering their long operational lifetime and pure color emission compared with phosphorescent and TADF OLEDs. However, there are still challenges of using exciplex hosts for hyperfluorescent OLEDs. Suitable exciplex hosts for blue hyperfluorescent OLEDs are not available; because blue fluorescent emitters often have high S1/T1, existing donors/acceptors can meet the requirements for high singlet/triplet energies. Obvious additional exciplex EL peaks at shorter wavelengths could be detected, which are generally attributed to incomplete energy transfer between the exciplex and the fluorescent dopant. The broadened recombination zone and doping method will also deteriorate the color quality of red OLEDs. There is still a lack of large triplet energy exciplex hosts for blue hyperfluorescent OLEDs. Besides, even if the EQEmax of the sensitized OLEDs exceeded the theoretical limit, the efficiency roll-off was still severe.
6. Conclusions
Tracing the discovery and development of exciplexes, this review describes the mechanism and superiority of using exciplexes as co-hosts for phosphorescent, TADF, and hyperfluorescent OLEDs. Exciton utilization is extremely important for the efficiency of OLEDs, since it directly decides the IQE. Phosphorescent metal complexes are one way to approach 100% IQE due to their strong spin–orbit coupling induced by the heavy metal ions. For traditional fluorescent materials it has been long assumed that only 25% of singlets can be utilized to generate fluorescence. When the efficient RISC process was demonstrated both in TADF molecules and exciplexes, pure organic materials showed potential for 100% exciton harvesting.
An exciplex is an intermolecular charge-transfer state formed by electron-donating and accepting materials, which is not only an efficient emitter but also an excellent host to sensitize an emitter as an energy transfer medium. We consider that exciplex forming co-hosts provide incomparable exciton utilization efficiency compared with traditional hosts. The PhOLEDs and TADF OLEDs based on exciplex forming co-hosts have reached more than 30% in EQE. The quick RISC processes redistribute the excitons and avoid TTA and TPA, accompanied by merits like high efficiency and low efficiency roll-off. The bipolarity, injection-barrier-free quality, and the Langevin recombination mechanism reduce the driving voltage and enlarge the recombination zone. The multiple combinations of donors and acceptors make the bandgap, S1/T1 and energy levels of the exciplex highly adjustable. Besides, exciplex forming co-hosts favor the sensitizing efficiency of doped traditional fluorescent OLEDs, as 100% IQE has become possible to beat the 25% theoretical limit. The analysis of multi-channel recombination processes in exciplex–dopant systems can also help us understand the basic photophysical mechanism, even if there are still some unknown parameters and difficulties about exciplex forming co-hosts.
The development of exciplex forming co-hosts is a process of perfecting the mechanism system. Although high exciplex efficiency has been realized for many cases, the determinant factors are still unknow. Basic studies concerning the charge transfer between D and A, the recombination process, the bimolecular interaction, and the degradation process of the exciplex are particularly important to future development and to the whole intellectual framework. Several characterization and calculation methods have been applied to the analyses of the energy transfer in exciplex–dopant systems. However, there is still a lack of measurements of the intrinsic charge-transfer states and exciton transport. Due to the multiple pre-factors, it is still a great challenge to adequately evaluate the geometry and electronic structures of exciplex hosts by both theoretical calculations and experimental investigations. To form a unified knowledge network consistent with TADF, the same studies on exciplex hosts as TADF molecules and comparisons should be covered. In terms of the materials, it is often possible to choose materials to form exciplexes with adjustable triplet energy. However, a shortage of deep blue exciplex forming co-hosts still exists due to the limited selection of donors and acceptors with high oxidization and reduction potentials. Sometimes, the low charge mobility has an influence both on the exciplex formation and the D/A mixing ratio. Exciplex hosts were proved to have long operational lifetimes in green and red OLEDs, but it is of importance to develop stable donors and acceptors with higher triplet energies to improve the operational lifetime of blue OLEDs. In terms of device engineering, the device performance using exciplex hosts is promising and efficient. However, there are also some negative effects, such as additional EL peaks due to the inefficient energy transfer and non-radiative recombination. The exciplex hosts still could not completely solve the large efficiency roll-off of blue TADF OLEDs. The application of using exciplex forming co-host in tandem WOLEDs has not been paid much attention, even though exciplexes have already shown their potential as hosts for tandem WOLEDs, which is very promising in commercial applications. One more point which should not be neglected is that WOLEDs based on exciplex hosts involve tri-doping and quadri-doping techniques, which might increase the complexity for device fabrication resulting in a cost issue. Therefore, solution processing methods such as printing techniques would be cost-effective ways to fabricate WOLEDs involving multiple compositions in their active layers.
Overall, we introduced the mechanism and reviewed the application of exciplex forming co-hosts. Exciplex forming co-hosts play multifunctional roles in the energy transfer in OLED devices. More importantly, exciplexes as a new group of materials provide a unique point in pursuing high-efficiency host materials, and will inspire more researchers to perform further investigations in this field.

 	Fig. 15  Simplified schematic diagrams for exciton management in single-EML hybrid WOLEDs based on (a) conventional blue fluorophores and (b) blue TADF emitters with low dopant concentrations. Zone I (green circle) represents the diffusion zone of singlet excitons, where all singlet and triplet are harvested by the green/red phosphors for green/red emission. Zone II (pink circle) represents the triplet diffusion zone, where triplet excitons are harvested by the phosphor molecules for green/red emission and the out-of-range singlet excitons can only be harvested by the blue fluorophore for blue emission. In the uncovered Zone III, for conventional blue fluorophores, all the excitons cannot be harvested by the phosphor molecules and only singlets are used for fluorescence, resulting in 25% IQE; but for TADF blue emitters, the triplets can be up-converted into S1 for light emission together with the directly generated singlet excitons, realizing 100% IQE. RS and RT are respectively the diffusion lengths of singlet and triplet excitons; compared with a conventional host, RT of the TADF host is smaller due to the fast competition process of RISC.
