    , Accepted 5th November 2014First published on 5th November 2014AbstractUsing density functional theory calculations with HSE 06 functional, we obtained the structures of spin-polarized radicals on rutile TiO2(110), which is crucial to understand the photooxidation at the atomic level, and further calculate the thermodynamic stabilities of these radicals. By analyzing the results, we identify the structural features for hole trapping in the system, and reveal the mutual effects among the geometric structures, the energy levels of trapped hole states and their hole trapping capacities. Furthermore, the results from HSE 06 functional are compared to those from DFT + U and the stability trend of radicals against the number of slabs is tested. The effect of trapped holes on two important steps of the oxygen evolution reaction, i.e. water dissociation and the oxygen removal, is investigated and discussed.
The spin-polarized radicals, forming via the trapping of photogenerated holes, are widely considered as crucial primary species in many reactions such as water photooxidation and organic pollutant degradation.1–4 Their structures and activity are an issue of general importance for understanding the catalytic mechanism and further rationally enhancing the catalytic performance. In particular, rutile TiO2 is an important photocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in which radicals formed from the hole localization are generally regarded to play a key role in facilitating O2 formation.
To date, a few experimental techniques, such as electron spin resonance (ESR),4 laser induced fluorescence (LIF)5 and transient absorption spectra (TAS)3 of photocarriers, have been used to detect the signals of photogenerated holes. However, the identification of the hole trapping sites and the structures as well as the corresponding trapping capacities (or the stabilities of radicals) has not been conclusive. Extensive trial-and-error studies focused mainly on new photocatalyst preparation, efficient photocarrier separation and band structure modification. Theoretically, owing to the difficulty in simulating radicals properly, a comprehensive understanding of the hole distribution, stability and catalytic activity still needs to be further developed. Nevertheless, a few theoretical reports have recently paid attention to probe the basic properties of hole trapping in oxides at the nanoscale: Zawadzki et al.6 studied the stabilities of delocalized and trapped holes in bulk rutile and anatase TiO2 with the Δ-SCF method. Wolf et al.7 investigated the hole trapping at surfaces of m-ZrO2 and m-HfO2 nanocrystals and found that the localization of holes at surface oxygens is more favourable than that in the bulk by 1.05 eV. Deskins et al.8 calculated the hole migration rates in TiO2 and showed that holes are more stable in the rutile phase, while electrons are more stable in anatase. Valentin et al.9 studied the polarons in photo-excited anatase TiO2 and revealed that the hole trapping sites generally correspond to either under-coordinated surface atoms or isolated OH species on a hydroxylated surface. By investigating the water photooxidation on rutile TiO2(110), Ji et al.10 detected some hole trapping signals and reported that the bridge oxygen is the most stable hole trapping site. Despite this progress, detailed analyses of the structures of possible radicals in photooxidation are still missing. Considering that holes cannot trigger the subsequent photooxidation unless they diffuse from bulk phases to surfaces and are trapped on the surfaces as radicals with a certain lifetime, there is no doubt that the lack of knowledge on photogenerated radicals hinders the progress of understanding of the photooxidation mechanism and the solar energy conversion efficiency.
Very recently, Cheng et al.11 reported a thorough density functional theory (DFT) study on hole trapping on TiO2, in which they identified the adsorbed hydroxyl radical (˙OH) and its deprotonated O− radical as the active radicals at the TiO2(110)–water interface in photooxidation. Their detailed electronic analyses on spin population, the vertical electron affinity and the redox potential of various trapped holes (bulk-Ti3O˙+, terminal-TiOH˙, terminal-TiO˙−, bridge-Ti2O˙+, transient-OH˙) uncover the nature of these localized states at the electronic level and also explain some of the spectroscopic and thermodynamic measurements reported in the literature.
Despite the considerable progress made in the field, there are still issues that need to be addressed. The answers to the following questions remain unclear: are there any geometric structural features that determine the hole trapping? How do the trapped holes affect the oxygen evolution reaction? Are there any new trapped hole states in addition to the states identified before? In addition, it is also desirable to know the quality of DFT + U in describing the hole trapping compared to the DFT calculations with HSE 06 functional. Therefore, a systematic investigation of the nature of various radical species on rutile-TiO2 is of great significance in exploiting the photocatalytic mechanism on the catalyst.
In the present work, we carried out extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the HSE 06 functional, which is much expensive but more accurate in describing the hole localization by reducing the on-site electronic self-interaction, to systemically explore the atomic structures and further ascertain the hole trapping capacities of these radicals compared to the self-trapped hole in the bulk phase. After obtaining the basic properties of radicals, the mutual effects among the geometric structures, the energy levels of trapped hole states and their thermodynamic stabilities as well as the significant roles of radicals in facilitating water dissociation and the lattice oxygen removal were also discussed.
In all the hybrid DFT calculations using the VASP code,12,13 a p(1 × 4) unit cell of rutile TiO2(110) with four-Ti-layers and a ∼15 Å vacuum between slabs was selected as the model (Fig. 1(a)). The transition states (TSs) were searched using a constrained optimization scheme, which has been widely used in previous studies.14–17 It is worth noting that, to simulate a photogenerated hole in the consideration of simplifying the complicated photo-excited system to exclude the uncertain electron–hole interaction which varies with the trapping centre while ensuring the electroneutrality of the periodic system (eliminating the energy correction resulting from the presence of background counter charge), we introduced an OH group as an electron acceptor on the bottom surface of the slab instead of removing electrons from the periodic system. Similar approaches were used in previous work.18 It is found that, in a normal optimization using HSE 06 functional, an electron would be trapped at the OH group forming a surface OH− at the back of the slab and a hole would be localized on the lattice O− site in the bulk phase (Fig. 1(c)); while the standard PBE functional failed to describe the distribution of the hole resulting in largely delocalized states (Fig. 1(b)) due to the self-interaction error, which is similar to the results of Cheng et al.18 The localization of the hole from HSE 06 functional is further confirmed by the electronic structural analyses of site-projected magnetic moments (0.69 μe) and the Bader charge (0.47 e) as we have utilized previously.19–22 It is worth noting that in our approach the introduced OH sitting at different positions on the bottom layer gives a negligible effect on evaluating the properties of the surface radicals due to the weak interaction in between. In order to pin down the key structural features for hole trapping, no water surrounding was considered in this work for the purpose of excluding the water effect (the structure distortion induced by adsorption of aqueous species and the hydrogen bond network). However, the water effect is discussed in conjunction with the results of Cheng et al.11

In order to thoroughly investigate surface radicals, we focused on all the possible hole traps on hydroxylated surfaces because under aqueous conditions there should be hydroxyl groups occupying both terminal and bridge sites on the surface, as well as adsorbed water molecules. Previously, Salvador23 has provided experimental evidence that water molecules specifically adsorbed on terminal Ti4+ can hardly trap a hole and be very difficult to be photo-oxidized. But to be rigorous, we still checked the energy level of adsorbed water using DFT calculation with HSE 06 functional. As shown in plots of the density of states (DOSs) in Fig. 2, the occupied states of oxygen in water are lower, as large as ∼1.90 eV compared to those of lattice oxygens located at the valence band maximum (VBM) and spread out within the valence band, giving rise to very little contribution to the band edge. In addition, the energy levels of two σ bonding O–H bonds in water are even far below the VBM (∼−8.6 eV), as shown in Fig. 2(b). This suggests that the adsorbed surface water molecules are not efficient hole traps, being consistent with the experimental work of Salvador.23 In contrast, when we analyzed the DOS of adsorbed CH3O* species, we find that the O 2p states of CH3O* contribute to the most of the valence band edge (see the ESI† for details). These results indicate that the oxygen atom in CH3O* is prone to trap a hole while the surface water is not. This partly explains the photooxidation promotion effect of methanol in OER when adding methanol into the water, agreeing well with the experimental report of Guo et al.24

The geometry structure optimized from HSE 06 is illustrated in the inset. The vertical dotted line in (b) indicates the center of valence band edge of O 2p states in the water molecule. 
After confirming the inability of adsorbed water molecules in trapping holes, the remaining possible hole traps on the surface are the bridge oxygen (Obr2−; Obr2− + h+ → Obr−), the three-coordinated oxygen (O3c2−; O3c2− + h+ → O3c−), the bridge hydroxyl group (OHbr−; OHbr− + h+ → ˙OHbr), and the adsorbed OH− on terminal Ti4+ ions (OHt−; OHt- + h+ → ˙OHt). The optimized geometry structures of these radicals from HSE 06 and the corresponding spin density plots are showed in Fig. 3. One can see that the radicals always keep the original coordination number unchanged, and the hole localization is accompanied by the distinct elongations of Ti–O bonds (see the average bond length changes listed in Table 1) by the outward move of the lattice Ti4+ ions. The original positions of Ti4+ lattice points before trapping holes are indicated as black circles in Fig. 3 to show the structural changes due to the hole trappings at the atomic level, and the spin density plots displayed in Fig. 3 demonstrate evidence of the existence of localized holes. We can see that the holes localize clearly on the O 2p orbital in each radical, being approximately perpendicular to the local plane formed by linked Ti–O bonds to reduce the steric repulsion. Upon careful examination of Fig. 3, we find that ˙OHbr is an interesting one that appears to possess a minor delocalization on the surrounding oxygens, which indicates the difficulty for the hole trapping, being consistent well with its weak hole trapping capacity (see Table 1). After trapping holes, the oxygens possess less negative charges, resulting in changes in the electrostatic potentials, which affect the structural relaxations and the formation of radicals.

The orbital-resolved projected densities of states (PDOSs) of these radicals are shown in Fig. 4. A 3.45 eV band gap for rutile TiO2(110) was calculated using HSE 06 functional, and a 3.12 eV band gap corresponding to the bulk TiO2 was obtained (exp. ∼3.05 eV), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The strong interaction between Ti and O atoms is clearly shown by the large overlapping of d and p orbitals throughout most of the valence band. However, the edge of the valence band consists mainly of O 2p states, showing weak overlapping, whereas the conduction band edge possesses major Ti 3d character. By comparing the pure TiO2(110) with other surfaces in Fig. 4(a)–(g), one can see that the formation of radicals does not lead to significant changes in the whole band structure, but introduces a localized paramagnetic hole (O 2p) state in the band gap, as can be visualized by the iso-density surface in Fig. 3. This further confirms that all the trapped holes are predominantly localized on the structurally distorted oxygens, and only these oxygens have significant spin magnetic moments and considerably less negative charges (as shown in Table 1). In addition, accompanying the hole localization and the formation of the radical species, the oxidative power of photoholes would be reduced to some extent, manifesting itself in the up-shifting of the hole state in the band gap relative to the VBM, despite being still capable of oxidizing water into oxygen, as shown in Fig. 4(h) (see the ESI† for the derivation of the H2O/O2 potential). Furthermore, we calculated the hole trapping capacity, which is defined by the relative thermodynamic stability of each radical compared with the self-trapped hole in the bulk phase (see Table 1). Interestingly, it is found that there is a good correlation between the energy level of the unoccupied O 2p states in these radicals and their HTCs: the higher the energy level of a trapped hole state is, the more stable the hole would be, and the stronger the hole trapping capacity roughly is.

A good correlation between the energy levels of the trapped hole states (O 2p) in the band gap among radicals (two- or three-coordinated) and their hole trapping capacities is plotted (h). The oxidative potential of H2O/O2 is shown as a green dashed line. 
Because each geometry structure corresponds to a specific electronic structure or vice versa,25,26 each trapped hole state should link to a unique geometric structure. As pointed out above, the hole trapping process is accompanied by the corresponding structural distortion. Hence, it is worth discussing the structural relaxation to understand the variation in HTC. Table 1 lists the hole trapping capacity of different radicals relative to a self-trapped hole in the bulk phase calculated using the HSE 06 functional and PBE + U method. Among these radicals on the surface, the formation of ˙OHt radicals can release the largest energy (0.92 eV from HSE 06; 0.77 eV from PBE + U). This is mainly benefited from the large degree of freedom of the structural relaxation: small steric hindrance of the protruded single Ti–OH bond and the significant backward movement of Ti4+, which was protruded before the hole trapping on the surface due to the adsorption of OH−, to the original lattice site in the structural relaxation (as shown in Fig. 3(e)). The large energy release indicates that the ˙OHt radical should be a dominant radical on hydroxylated TiO2(110) with a coverage being about 108 times higher than Obr− at room temperature estimated using Boltzmann distribution function, p1/p2 = exp[(0.92–0.42) eV/(kBT)], where p1 and p2 are the populations of the two radicals. Thus, it should play an important role in photooxidation reactions, being consistent with experimental results of Ahmed et al.27 where the ˙OH radical can be indirectly detected by using terephthalic acid and theoretical work of Cheng et al.11 When the holes are trapped by Obr2− and O3c2−, forming Obr− (Fig. 3(a)) and O3c− (Fig. 3(c)) radicals, HSE 06 calculation shows the energy releases of 0.42 and 0.03 eV, respectively. These energy results correlate well with the corresponding structures: the different O coordination numbers lead to the different extents of resistance when relaxing (Fig. 4(h)) during trapping the holes, indicating that Obr2− is the most favored lattice oxygen for hole trapping on the surface. As for the ˙OHbr radical (Fig. 3(b)), the three coordinated structure and especially in the presence of positively charged H in OHbr−, which increases the electrostatic repulsion, results in the difficulty of trapping holes compared to the surface Obr2−, absorbing 0.33 eV (0.20 eV by PBE + U) during the formation. Such a large energy requirement indicates that the ˙OHbr radical is unstable and it should thus be readily converted into other radicals.
Another unexpected finding is that the subsurface oxygen (Osub2−) just below the surface five-coordinated Ti4+, on which OH− adsorbs, is very easy to trap a hole and form the Osub− radical, giving an energy gain as large as 0.95 eV. A similar result of strong hole trapping at subsurface layers of TiO2 was also reported by Zawadzki28 in the anatase TiO2 recently. After carefully examining the local structure of Osub2−, we find the following features: (i) when OH− bonds on a surface Ti4+, it pulls the Ti4+ out of the surface plane by ∼0.75 Å and thus leaves enough space for Osub2− to relax when trapping a hole. (ii) For the two subsurface Ti4+ ions, instead of outward move, they return to the original position from the initial off-lattice site during the formation of an Osub− radical, as shown in Fig. 3(d). If the hole migrates to OHt−, the surface Ti4+ would move back to the original lattice site, thus generating an elongated Ti–OH bond and promoting the hole localization at OHt−. This interesting finding indicates that the surface Ti4+, which is underneath the adsorbed OH−, could play a key role in hole-switching that adjusts the involvement of holes in photooxidation. When the surface reaction needs a hole, the surface Ti4+ protruded due to the adsorption of OH− would move down and the Osub− could release the hole into the reaction. Otherwise, the Ti4+ may stay the protruded structure on the surface and the Osub− keeps the hole temporarily.
As discussed above, the hole trapping capacity of each radical is related to the energy level of trapped hole states and the structural relaxation, especially the latter one. Three new trapped hole species (O3c−, ˙OHbr and Osub−) are identified in this work compared to Cheng et al.11 In particular, Osub− is of importance, which may act as the subsurface hole reservoir in facilitating the surface photooxidation. Generally, the HTC trend of these trapped holes found in this work is ˙OHt ≈ Osub− > Obr− > O3c− ≈ bulk hole > ˙OHbr, which is consistent with the work of Cheng et al. with water surroundings.11 It is noted that our HTC values are slightly higher than those in the work of Cheng et al.,11 which may be due to the water effect. Furthermore, we suggest that the hole is prone to diffuse to the structurally soft site on the surface thermodynamically from the bulk at the cost of sacrificing its oxidative power, being in agreement with Valentin et al.9 and Zawadzki et al.29 Having presented the mutual effects among the geometric structures, the energy level of trapped hole states and their thermodynamic stabilities, we can discuss some implications of these results for photocatalyst design. In order to improve the photooxidation activity, holes should be trapped on the surface as many as possible, requiring that the catalytic surface should be softened to a certain extent to weaken the metal-oxygen (M–O) bond and to reduce the resistance in structural relaxation when trapping holes. Specifically for TiO2, one strategy may be to moderately substitute the lattice Ti4+ with other suitable metal ions possessing a weaker M–O bond in its oxide. This might explain the experimental results of incorporating germanium (Ge) into Titania (TiO2) with an enhanced activity on azo dye photo-degradation reported by Stengl et al.30
To date, the oxygen evolution reaction has been generally considered as the bottle-neck in the photocatalytic water splitting due to its high overpotential,31 and it is also widely accepted that radicals should play crucial roles in the photooxidation reaction,32 although the detailed mechanism still remains unknown. A long-standing question in the field is: how do radicals (trapped holes) affect the reactions in photocatalytic OER? Here, after obtaining the structures of radicals, we can shed some lights on this issue. Firstly, for the water dissociation process, both Valdes et al.33 and Li et al.34 suggested that the rate-limiting step for water oxidation is the initial water dissociation step. As shown in Fig. 5(c), when there is no hole in the TiO2(110) slab, the water dissociation process needs to overcome a barrier of 0.36 eV to produce OHt− and OHbr− with an energy cost of 0.13 eV in our system, indicating a much faster reverse reaction rate. When there is a hole standing still in the bulk as a spectator (see the TS structure in Fig. 5(a)), a slight promotion (∼0.07 eV) on both the barrier and the reaction energy can be seen at both the transition and final states probably resulting from the enhanced adsorption of OHt−. When the bulk hole participates in the water dissociation, in which the TS is reached with 20% of the hole locating on the OHt and 78% of the hole distributing on a nearby O3c2− (Fig. 5(b)), a significant decrease in the kinetic barrier but an increase in thermodynamic driving force take place. This suggests that a water molecule can readily dissociate into ˙OHt and OHbr− with the help of a photohole, being in agreement with a recent report of Ji et al.35 Secondly, considering the experimental results of the involvement of lattice oxygens in OER on rutile TiO2(110) reported by Nakamura et al.36 and Mezhenny et al.,37 we calculated the oxygen vacancy formation energy of Obr2− (the normal bridge oxygen) and Obr− (the bridge oxygen radical), which are 3.16 eV and 1.54 eV for Obr2− and Obr−, respectively, aiming at exploring the possible effects of radicals thermodynamically. This simple energy contrast clearly reveals the contributions of radicals in promoting the removal of lattice oxygen. Therefore, it is clear that with the participation of active radicals, both the initial water dissociation and the lattice oxygen removal are greatly promoted. Thus, we can reasonably speculate that the overall OER may be considerably accelerated with the participation of radicals.
 Fig. 5  The geometric structures of water dissociation at the transition states (TSs) in the presence of a hole as a spectator in the bulk phase (a) and with the participation of a hole (b). The bond lengths at the TS are also illustrated with the unit of Å. The energy profiles of different water dissociation pathways are shown in (c). 
Finally, it is worth noting that, considering the well-known odd-even oscillations38 of some properties on rutile-TiO2(110), we attempt to estimate the HTC convergence of the two important radicals, i.e. ˙OHt and Obr−, using a larger 10-Ti-layer p(1 × 4) slab suggested by Kiejna et al.39 at the PBE + U calculation level (the calculation at the HSE level is beyond the scope of this work). The result shows that the absolute values of energy releasing are generally reduced by ∼0.4 eV, being −0.36 eV for ˙OHt and −0.1 eV for Obr− compared to a self-trapped hole in the bulk phase. However, the general HTC trend is almost unchanged, namely it is 0.26 eV more favourable for ˙OHt than Obr− compared with the value of 0.31 eV in the 4-Ti-layer slab.
In summary, we localized the structures of the important spin-polarized radicals in photooxidation and further calculated the thermodynamic stability of these radicals. It was found that the surface bridge oxygen (Obr2−) is the most favored lattice oxygen for hole trapping from the HSE 06 functional. We also confirmed that the adsorbed ˙OHt radical has the strongest hole trapping capacity on TiO2(110) and is most likely to participate in aqueous photooxidation reactions. The stability trend of these two key radicals was found to be hardly changed with the numbers of slabs used. It was also found that a distorted geometry in particular in the O–Ti bonds is always essential to achieve hole trapping on O 2p states. The mutual effects among the geometric structures, the energy level of trapped hole states and their thermodynamic stabilities were also discussed. Substituting species M with a weak M–O bond in TiO2 may enhance the hole trapping. With the participation of active radicals, both the initial water dissociation and the lattice oxygen removal can be greatly promoted. These findings should be of importance for photocatalytic chemistry.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Side view of our calculation model (a) and the corresponding spin density comparison between standard PBE (b) and HSE 06 functional (c) with an iso-value of 0.005. Grey: Ti; red: O; white: H. This colour notation is used throughout the paper.	 

 	Fig. 2  Projected density of states (PDOS) of TiO2(110) with a water adsorbed on a terminal Ti4+ (a) and the local DOS of the adsorbed water molecule (b) using HSE 06 functional in the gas phase. The geometry structure optimized from HSE 06 is illustrated in the inset. The vertical dotted line in (b) indicates the center of valence band edge of O 2p states in the water molecule.	 

 	Fig. 3  Illustration of geometry structures of spin-polarized radicals (left) and the corresponding spin density plots with an iso-value of 0.005 (right) for Obr− (a), ˙OHbr (b), O3c− (c), Osub− (d) and ˙OHt (e) from HSE 06. The black circles in the geometry structures represent the original positions of Ti4+ before trapping holes and the oxygen atoms in radicals are highlighted in yellow.	 


Bulk hole	0.17	0.47	0.69	0	0
Obr−	0.21	0.56	0.74	−0.42	−0.46
O3c−	0.16	0.46	0.68	−0.03	0.03
˙OHbr	0.28	0.44	0.67	0.33	0.20
˙OHt	0.43	0.60	0.76	−0.92	−0.77
Osub−	0.27	0.57	0.75	−0.95	−0.78

 	Fig. 4  The PDOSs of pure TiO2(110) (a) and the localized radicals (b–g) using HSE 06. The vertical dotted lines in the PDOS denote the energy levels below which the states are occupied. A good correlation between the energy levels of the trapped hole states (O 2p) in the band gap among radicals (two- or three-coordinated) and their hole trapping capacities is plotted (h). The oxidative potential of H2O/O2 is shown as a green dashed line.	 

 	Fig. 5  The geometric structures of water dissociation at the transition states (TSs) in the presence of a hole as a spectator in the bulk phase (a) and with the participation of a hole (b). The bond lengths at the TS are also illustrated with the unit of Å. The energy profiles of different water dissociation pathways are shown in (c).
