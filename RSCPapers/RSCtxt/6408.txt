    , Accepted 4th April 2019First published on 5th April 2019AbstractSolar-driven distillation and desalination are promising technologies for large-scale water purification. Internal micro-channels are critical for the performance of a steam generation device in consideration of thermal management and water transportation. Here, we designed novel porous three-dimensional carbon foams (CFs) with unique interconnected channels and rough surfaces via alkali activation of naturally abundant wood. Promoted by the rough surface, the CFs can harvest more than 97% of the energy of the solar spectrum. The hydrophilic interconnected micro-channels of the CFs enhance water transportation and heat localization. Benefiting from these advantages, the highest steam generation efficiency of the CFs reaches 80.1% under 1 kW m−2. In addition, the CFs also show high stability under harsh conditions and high activity in desalination of seawater. With the unique interconnected micro-channels, this porous carbon device offers a scalable, cost-effective and efficient choice for solar steam generation.
1. Introduction
Water shortage is a vital problem faced by humanity. Reverse osmosis and multi-stage flash, two commonly used clean-water production strategies to alleviate water shortage, have several deficiencies such as huge energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Solar steam generation is considered as a promising technology to produce clean water with distillation and seawater desalination due to the abundance of solar energy.1,2 The design of an efficient solar-driven evaporation system mainly follows four core principles: (1) improving the harvesting of solar energy, (2) reducing heat loss at the evaporation surface, (3) promoting water transportation, and (4) accelerating vapor escape.3–5
In order to implement these principles, most devices are designed to consist of two parts: a light absorber for photothermal conversion and a substrate for water transportation. Recently, ultra-black absorbers with wide-range light absorption, such as polymers,6,7 semiconductors with ultra-narrow band gap8–10 and plasmonic nanoparticles,11–13 have been investigated for solar-driven evaporation. However, most of these solar absorbers are either unstable or expensive. Carbon-based materials, such as graphene, amorphous carbon, and carbon black nanoparticles, with broad-spectrum light absorption, low cost and high abundance, are excellent candidates for photothermal conversion.14–17
As for the substrate, porous materials are applied to improve the steam generation performance via efficient water transportation, such as anodic aluminum oxide,18 polyvinylidene fluoride membrane19,20 and biofoam.21,22 Thermal localization is another essential requirement for the substrate. With thermal localization, thermal energy is confined at the surface where the phase change happens to achieve the minimization of dissipated energy and the maximization of solar-vapor conversion efficiency.5,16 Effective light absorption, low thermal conductivity, rich porosity, and high hydrophilicity of a device can contribute to the localization of heat.16 On the basis of its mesoporous and hierarchical structure, low tortuosity, and efficient water transport, wood is considered as an attractive raw material for water distillation devices.12 There have only been a few wood-based evaporation devices investigated so far, such as those containing carbon nanotube-coated wood,23 plasmonic wood12 and flame-treated wood.24–27 However, from the perspective of stability, wood is not an ideal substrate for photothermal distillation and desalination devices, as it is easily deformed and rotted in natural water.28,29 Turning wood into carbon is a method to improve the chemical stability of devices. Besides, carbon can serve as the light absorber as well. Therefore, a carbonized wood block is expected to an efficient evaporation device with high chemical stability, wide light response range, low cost and convenient fabrication.6
Alkali-assisted carbonization is one of the widely used methods to open and broaden the existing channels and create new pores in carbon materials and improve hydrophilicity.30,31 For the first time, simultaneously considering surface modification and intrinsic structural optimization, we designed and fabricated novel three-dimensional (3D) carbon foams (CFs) via in situ alkali activation. Benefiting from the rougher surface due to alkali activation, the light diffuse reflectance of CFs is reduced and a superior light absorption capability is achieved with a broadband wavelength from 280 nm to 2500 nm. Similarly, the alkali chemical treatment breaks down the walls of the channels to form plentiful interconnected channels. Meanwhile, because of such abundant hydrophilic interconnected channels, water is efficiently transported from the water–air interface to the surface of the CFs via capillary force. Due to the abundant interconnected micro- and nano-channels as thermal barriers, the heat is localized on the top surface of the CFs for less thermal loss. Moreover, the open cellular microstructure promotes the diffusion of the internally generated vapor into the air. Superior light harvesting, thermal management and high-efficiency mass transfer result in an outstanding steam generation performance of the CFs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of carbon block
Natural wood was washed and cut into blocks with a diameter of approx. 45 mm and a thickness of approx. 3.5 mm for further use, the weights of the blocks being 6.16 ± 0.37 g. Each wood block was carbonized at 773 K for 2 h under N2 flow. The obtained carbonized wood block (CB) was washed with distilled water and ethanol, and dried at 333 K.
2.2 Preparation of the 3D CFs
The 3D CFs were prepared via the alkali activation method. Typically, different amounts of KOH (2, 5, and 10 g) were dissolved into 50 mL ethanol. After being soaked in the resultant solutions for 10 min, the wood blocks were carbonized at 773 K for 2 h under N2 flow. The obtained porous CFs were washed with HCl solution, distilled water and ethanol, and dried at 333 K. The 3D CFs were designated as CF-1, CF-2, and CF-3, which represented the CFs prepared with 2, 5, and 10 g of KOH respectively. The diameters of the CFs are approx. 34 mm, and the thickness is approx. 2.9 mm.
2.3 Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained with an S-4800 microscope (Hitachi, Japan). The N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was performed with an Autosorb-iQ-AG-MP automated gas sorption analyzer (Quantachrome, USA). The surface area was calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. Pore size distribution and pore volume were determined according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equation. The optical transmittance and reflectance spectra of the solar-driven evaporation devices were obtained with a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Agilent, USA) equipped with an integrating sphere from 250 to 2500 nm. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained with a Nicolet iS5 infrared spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The contact angle images were obtained with a KSV-CAM200 contact angle meter (KSV, Finland). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a PHI QUANTERA II with a monochromatized Al Kα excitation source.
2.4 Solar steam generation
A xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300, CEAULIGHT, China) worked as the solar simulator. The illuminating light intensity was adjusted by controlling the distance of the optical lengths and the power of the solar simulator. For reducing the experimental error by preventing light from irradiating the bulk water, all solar-driven evaporation devices were covered by a punched polystyrene ring with an outer diameter of 40 mm and inner diameter of 30 mm, and the entire structure was floated on the surface of water in a beaker with a diameter of 40 mm. The beaker was put on an electronic balance. The weight loss was recorded in real time to accurately measure the evaporation rates and efficiency. The IR images and temperature were obtained with a FLIR One Pro thermal imager. The seawater desalination experiment was carried using a homemade quartz reactor with an evaporative water collection system. The seawater used in this experiment was simulated in the lab. The initial concentrations of NaCl, MgCl2, KCl, MgSO4, NaHCO3, CaCl2, and NaBr in the simulated seawater were 26.5, 24, 0.73, 3.3, 0.2, 1.1, and 0.28 g L−1, respectively. The concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ before and after desalination were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy.
All solar evaporation experiments were conducted at an ambient temperature of 23 ± 1.1 °C and relative humidity of 54%.
3. Results and discussion
Optical images of the wood, CB and CFs are presented in Fig. 1a–e. The obvious shrinkage in volume can be observed from the images of the carbon devices, which may be caused by the loss of bound water in the wood cell walls under high temperature. CB presented a smooth surface, whereas CFs showed relatively rough surfaces, and the surface roughness of CFs became higher as the amount of alkali increased. The microstructures of the devices (Fig. 1f–k and S1†) are critical to water transportation in solar steam generation. As shown in the cross-sectional view of CB (Fig. 1h), the microscopic structures of fiber tracheids and cell lumina were well preserved after carbonization. However, the internal pore structure of CF-3 is very different from that of CB. Some of channel walls were etched by alkali during carbonization to produce abundant interconnected channels. In addition, the difference in the top-view FESEM images of CB and CF-3 confirmed the roughness of the surface of CF-3. As shown in Table 1, the surface area and pore volume increased with increasing amount of alkali, which confirmed that alkali etching may create more pores in CFs. The alkali etching also enlarged the channels in CFs, as the average pore size of CF-3 was greater than that of CF-2 and CF-1. The pore size distribution of the devices is exhibited in Fig. S2.† The different porosity suggested that the microstructure of CFs may be tuned by the amount of alkali during preparation. The mass change (Fig. S3†) of the carbon devices proved the alkali etching indirectly. With an increase of alkali dosage, the loss of mass increased.

High light harvesting ability is an essential requirement for photo-thermal conversion. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2a. The ordinate axis, absorption efficiency (A), was calculated with the equation: A = 1 − T − R, where T and R are the transmission and reflection efficiency. The CFs were found to have higher absorption efficiencies than CB at various wavelengths. The absorption efficiency of devices over the whole solar spectrum is calculated via the following equation:32  where na (%) is the absorption efficiency of devices over the whole solar spectrum, EA is the energy absorbed by the devices, ES is the solar energy, λ (nm) is the wavelength, aλ (%) is the absorption efficiency of devices at wavelength λ, and Sλ (W m−2 nm−1) is the solar spectral irradiance. Natural wood could absorb about 38.3% of the solar energy. After carbonization, the light harvesting properties of CB were improved remarkably with a high absorption (about 90.5%). The CFs showed increases in the light harvesting properties owing to multiple reflection (Fig. 2b), which was a result of the increased surface roughness and enlarged porous structure with alkali activation.19 The absorption efficiency of CF-3 reached as high as 97.2% over the whole solar spectrum. The broad-spectrum and high-efficiency light absorption of CB and CFs can be ascribed to the closely spaced energy levels of the loosely held π electrons.33 The solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency increases with improvement of the light harvesting performance of the devices. To demonstrate the enhancement of the photothermal conversion efficiency, the surface temperatures of the devices under 2 sun (1 sun = 1Copt = 1 kW m−2) in air were monitored. As shown in Fig. 2c, the maximum surface temperatures of natural wood, CB and CFs increase rapidly in 120 s and become almost steady afterwards. For the best light harvesting performance, CF-3 demonstrates a highest maximum steady temperature of 87.9 °C. The heat released by carbon devices can be attributed to the solar excitation and relaxation of the loosely held π electrons with the closely spaced energy levels.33,34 As CF-3 shows higher light absorption due to the rough surface and enlarged channels, it presents the highest steady temperature under illumination among CB and CFs. There was heat exchange between the surface of the material and the environment due to the difference in temperature. When the thermal equilibrium was reached after 120 s, the temperature of the device tends to be stable.

In addition to the light harvesting properties, the water transportation in a solar-driven evaporation device has a remarkable influence on steam generation. The C 1s XPS spectra of CB and CF-3 were obtained. As shown in Fig. 3a, the signal can be fitted into two components. The peak at 284.0 eV is assigned to graphitic CC and the peak at 285.5 eV is attributed to C–OH. The peak area of C–OH for CF-3 is larger than that for CB, suggesting that more –OH appears in CF-3. The FT-IR patterns shown in Fig. S5† also suggest the amount of –OH increased remarkably with alkali activation. The increased amount of –OH may enhance the hydrophilicity of the CFs. As presented in Fig. 3b and S6,† CB shows a contact angle of 72.3° after 5 s, and the contact angles become smaller with increasing amounts of alkali. Additionally, the water droplet (5 μL) is slightly absorbed by CB in 300 s, whereas the water droplet can be completely absorbed by CF-3 within 1 s, which demonstrates the strong hydrophilicity and water permeability of the CFs. The hydrophilic interconnected channels were demonstrated to efficiently wick the water to the surfaces of the devices via the capillary effect.12 An experiment was designed to indicate the higher water transportation rate of CF-3. As shown in Fig. S7,† the evaporation device was placed in a watch-glass containing rhodamine B solution, and a small piece of dry tissue paper was put on the top of the device. It took only 1.5 min to completely wet the tissue paper on CF-3, whereas the time to completely wet the tissue paper on wood, CB, CF-1, and CF-2 was 15, 8, 8 and 5 min, respectively (Fig. S8†). This experiment suggested the water transportation rate of CF-3 was higher than those of the other devices. Heat localization can be enhanced by promoting water transportation to the surfaces of devices through abundant interconnected channels and hydrophilicity.35 Besides, the thermal loss can be minimized by locating the solar-driven steam generation at the water–air interface.35 To illustrate this, the temperature distribution of CF-3 soaked in water as the illumination time increased from 0 to 30 min under 5 sun was recorded by an IR camera (Fig. 3c). The temperature of the top surface of CF-3 increases from ambient temperature to 61.5 °C within 5 min and remains stable through 30 min, whereas the temperature of the water underneath CF-3 only shows an increase of 4.6 °C. This result shows that heat was localized on the evaporation surface of CF-3, and thus cuts down heat loss to improve the thermal-to-vapor conversion efficiency.

To systematically evaluate the performance of the solar-driven evaporation devices, the evaporation rates and energy conversion efficiencies were accurately calculated by monitoring time-dependent mass change under different illumination intensities. Typical curves of time-dependent mass change under 1 sun irradiation are plotted in Fig. 4a, and the evaporation rates were calculated via the slope of the curves. CB presents a high evaporation rate of 1.03 kg m−2 h−1, about 2.98 and 2.07 times higher than those of bulk water (0.345 kg m−2 h−1) and natural wood (0.498 kg m−2 h−1), and CF-3 show the highest evaporation rate of 1.26 kg m−2 h−1. The corresponding energy conversion efficiencies were calculated by the following equation:17,23,24  where η is the energy conversion efficiency, m (kg m−2 s−1) is the mass flux (i.e. evaporation rate), h is the heat of phase change (h = 2260 kJ kg−1), Copt is the optical concentration, and q is the nominal solar irradiation (q = 1 kW m−2). Accordingly, the energy conversion efficiencies (Fig. 4b) of bulk water, natural wood, CB, CF-1, CF-2 and CF-3 under 1 sun illumination are 22.5%, 31.7%, 65.5%, 70.6%, 75.0% and 80.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the energy conversion efficiency of CF-3 increases with an increase of the light intensity (Fig. 4c). The evaporation rate increases from 1.26 kg m−2 h−1 at 1 kW m−2 to 14.09 kg m−2 h−1 at 10 kW m−2, and the corresponding energy conversion efficiency increases from 80.1% to 89.6%, which is one of the highest values among the reported solar-driven evaporation devices (Table S1†).3,19,23,25,26 As shown in Fig. S9,† the conversion efficiencies are almost unchanged with different incident angles under 1 sun, which indicated the light absorptivity of CF-3 was angle-independent.

(f) Ion concentrations (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+) before and after desalination with CF-3. 
The stability of CF-3 was evaluated through operation under harsh conditions or for a long time. Fig. 4d shows the energy conversion efficiency of CF-3 in different water conditions (pH = 0–14) under 1 sun irradiation. CF-3 presents an excellent energy conversion efficiency over a wide pH range. It is worth noting that CF-3 still exhibits stable conversion efficiency after 200 hours (Fig. 4e), suggesting the outstanding stability of the solar-driven evaporation device. CF-3 also presents high activity after being stored for 260 days (Fig. S10†).
To demonstrate potential application, the desalination effects of CF-3 were evaluated using artificial seawater (Fig. 4f). The concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ ions after desalination are 0.63, 0.22, 0.47 and 0.41 mg L−1, which were significantly lower than those of the initial seawater. Furthermore, the ion concentration values meet the USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.
On the basis of the above results, the enhancement of solar evaporation performance of CFs can be discussed. There are four consecutive steps included in solar steam generation as follows: (i) light absorption; (ii) solar-to-heat conversion; (iii) heat-to-vapor conversion; and (iv) vapor escape. These four steps are closely connected to the intrinsic characteristics of a solar steam generation system, such as surface roughness, internal structure and wettability. The integrated engineering of the above properties would contribute to the optimization of the four consecutive steps, and thus achieving a maximum improvement of the solar steam generation performance. Taking CF-3 as an example, the surface roughness has been modified to harvest more solar light. The CFs could absorb solar energy in the entire spectrum due to the closely spaced energy levels of the loosely held π electrons.33 Heat was released by the relaxation of the excited electrons. More solar energy could be absorbed by CF-3 than by CB owing to the multiple reflection effect of the rough surface of CF-3, and thus more heat was released. Secondly, the internal channels and wettability are modified to improve the heat-to-vapor conversion. The hydrophilic interconnected micro-channels in CF-3 could transport water to the evaporation surface via the capillary effect.12,24 Besides, the efficient water transportation and locating the steam generation at the water–air interface could both promote thermal isolation.35 The improvement in water transportation and heat localization accelerated heat-to-vapor conversion. Finally, the open porous structure within the top surface of CF-3 enabled steam escape without interference. The alkali treatment simultaneously altered the surface roughness, internal channels and wettability to optimize the four consecutive steps in solar steam generation. As a result, a strong synergetic enhancement in the solar-to-vapor conversion is achieved. Additionally, the CFs are cost-effective, scalable and stable, which makes them promising candidates for use in desalination. However, as a disadvantage, the interconnected channels lead to a decrease in the mechanical properties of the devices (Fig. S5†). In addition to a photothermal device for water distillation, the alkali-activated CFs are expected to serve as catalyst, catalyst substrate, absorbent and gas separation device due to the unique interconnected micro-/nanostructure.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we designed and fabricated alkali-activated 3D CFs as solar evaporation devices based on natural wood. Simple and inexpensive preparation methods of the CFs are promising for large-scale production. The capillary effect and the abundant hydrophilic interconnected channels can effectively absorb water from the bottom to the surface of the devices. Besides, the rougher surface of the device reduces diffuse reflectance and enhances solar absorption. With these advantages, CF-3 exhibits an outstanding solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency of 80.1% under 1 sun irradiation. Moreover, the CF-3 device exhibits superior stability under harsh conditions (pH = 0–14) or long-time operation (200 h). Notably, CF-3 also shows excellent desalination performance. This work suggests that the cost-effective, scalable and recyclable 3D CFs can be used in steam generation, water purification and seawater desalination.
