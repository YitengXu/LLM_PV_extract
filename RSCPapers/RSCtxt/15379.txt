    , Accepted 22nd May 2019First published on 22nd May 2019AbstractThe development of facilely synthesized, dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) with high efficiency is of great significance for the potential application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report two novel indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ) based small molecules obtained via a three-step reaction in a high yield without using expensive catalysts, namely C201 and C202, and further apply them as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. Compared with C201, C202 contains two additional biphenylamino groups to improve its spatial configuration. It is found that the interplay between the molecular geometry and the aggregation behavior can exert a great influence on the film formation property and thus on the device performance. Strikingly, the champion devices employing C202 as the HTM deliver a much higher PCE of up to 17.7%, which is substantially higher than that of devices containing C201 (8.7%) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G). It is revealed that the C202 capping layer exhibits a more homogeneous and uniform surface morphology as compared to that of C201, which effectively reduces the charge recombination losses and facilitates charge extraction, leading to a much-enhanced photovoltaic performance. This is the first example of ICZ core-based small molecules as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. Moreover, the PSCs containing C202 as the HTM also exhibited good long-term stability under ambient conditions (40% RH) as compared to devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD, due largely to the hydrophobic nature of C202 which prevented moisture from destroying the perovskite film. This work offers a new avenue for developing cost-effective and stable HTMs for PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most promising alternative energy sources, have attracted tremendous research attention due to their rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1,2 Normally, the light-absorbing perovskite layer is sandwiched between an electron transporting layer (ETL) and a hole-transporting layer (HTL). The HTL plays an essential role in extracting and transporting holes generated by the excited perovskite under light illumination. Moreover, it can also prevent the electron recombination processes at the interface, which deteriorate the solar cell performance.
Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) can be generally categorized into small organic molecules, inorganic materials, and polymers. Inorganic hole transport materials usually possess high hole mobility; however, it is difficult to deposit them on top of the perovskite layer due to the limited choice of fabrication methods and solvents.3 As a result, they are typically utilized in the “p–i–n structured” PSCs, where the HTLs are underneath the perovskite layer.4,5 Polymers that possess excellent film-forming abilities suffer from relatively poor batch-to-batch synthesis reproducibility. Taken together, small organic molecule HTMs are easy to be modified and purified and are solution processable.6,7 To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been the most used small organic molecule HTM. However, the synthesis procedure of spiro-OMeTAD is rather tedious, correlated with a high production cost. Moreover, the hole mobility of pristine spiro-OMeTAD is quite low (10−5 s−1 cm−1).8 Dopants like bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) are needed in order to improve its hole mobility. LiTFSI acts as a counter ion during the oxidation reaction between spiro-OMeTAD and O2.9 Nevertheless, LiTFSI is rather moisture-absorbing and Li+ can easily migrate into the perovskite layer,10 which are detrimental to the long-term device stability. In addition, t-BP must be added to improve the solubility of LiTFSI. But, it has been reported that t-BP can also accelerate the deterioration of the perovskite.11 Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to replacing spiro-OMeTAD, most of the replacements still either need to be doped to improve their hole mobilities12,13 or only yield comparatively low PCEs.14–18 Thus, the development of facilely synthesized and high-performing dopant-free HTMs is highly demanding in view of future application of PSCs.
Introducing a “donor–acceptor” (D–A) structure and a rigid conjugated core are two of the most effective strategies to improve the hole mobility, and thus develop the dopant-free HTMs.19–24 The indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ) core is a type of rigid conjugated electron-rich aromatic ring, which has been successfully applied in organic light-emitting diodes (OLED),25 organic thin-film transistors (OTFT)26,27 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),28 due to its outstanding photo-electric characteristics. In this regard, ICZ-based HTMs have been attempted in PSCs with dopants, the performance of which, however, is not satisfactory.29 Considering its facile synthesis, low cost and flexible modification, the potential of ICZ-based dopant-free HTMs in PSCs is still unexplored so far. Here, we designed and synthesized two ICZ core-based small molecule materials, denoted as C201 and C202, through only a three-step reaction with a high yield (Scheme 1). Compared with C201, C202 contains two additional biphenylamino groups to improve its spatial configuration. These two materials were further deployed as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. The best devices constructed with C201 showed an impressive PCE of up to 17.7%, which is considerably higher than that of devices based on C201 (8.7%) under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). Moreover, the PSCs containing C202 as the HTM also exhibited good long-term stability under ambient conditions (40% RH) as compared to devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD, due largely to the hydrophobic nature of C202 which prevented moisture from destroying the perovskite film.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to C201 and C202 are depicted in Scheme 1. First, a substituted indole and a substituted aldehyde produced an ICZ frame catalyzed by a Lewis acid as well as a step of oxidation.30 It is worth noting that we can easily modify the ICZ ring precisely by introducing various functional groups from the starting materials. Then, the final HTMs can be obtained through an Ullmann reaction. Both steps can guarantee a high yield above 80% without using any expensive catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 1) indicate that both C201 and C202 exhibit a highly planar molecular geometry, which will facilitate intermolecular stacking, and thus the hole hopping process. Since C201 has a smaller steric 4-methoxy group, it shows a relatively higher planarity as compared to C202.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures and the molecular geometry of C201 and C202. 
UV-vis absorption spectra of the synthesized HTMs in dichloromethane solutions and in thin films are given in Fig. 2a. The UV-vis absorptions of C201 and C202 in thin films show bathochromic shifts at the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of 8 and 3 nm, respectively, as compared to those in dilute solutions (the perpendicular configuration of spiro-OMeTAD shows no bathochromic shift, as shown in Fig. S1†). The results indicate that C201 holds a stronger intermolecular π–π stacking, which is in accordance with the DFT results. From the formula: Eg = 1240/λedge (Eg stands for bandgap, λedge is the UV-vis spectra absorption edge); the bandgap of C201 and C202 is calculated to be 2.77 and 2.74 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of C201 and C202 are −5.27 and −5.23 eV, respectively, calculated from the first oxidation potential of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) diagram, which are performed in dichloromethane solutions with ferrocene as the internal reference (Fig. 2b). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was also carried out to get a further understanding of the HOMO level in the film (Fig. S2, ESI†). The HOMO levels of C201 and C202 in the film are calculated to be −5.38 and −5.12 eV, respectively, with the equation φ = 21.21 eV − (Ecutoff − Efermi). A slightly more positive HOMO level of C202 is caused by the stronger electron-donating ability of 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine than that in the methoxy group. Thus, the HOMO energy levels of the two HTMs are more positive than the valence band (VB) energy level of the mixed-ion perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (−5.67 eV), implying that they are able to extract the photo-generated holes from the perovskite layer.31 The thermal stability of C201 and C202 is studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere, indicating that both the compounds are stable at decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 371 °C for C201 and 396 °C for C202, respectively (Fig. 2c). All the optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table S1.†

(d) Square root of current density–voltage curves for C201 and C202, measured by hole-only devices. 
Hole mobilities of the two HTMs are estimated with the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method by fabricating the hole-only devices (see Fig. 2d, details provided in the ESI†). Calculated with the Mott–Gurney law, the hole mobility of C201 and C202 is 1.8 × 10−4 and 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (as comparison, pristine spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a hole mobility of 6.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, shown in Fig. S1†). Benefitting from its stronger intermolecular π–π stacking, C201 exhibits a slightly higher hole mobility.
The two small molecules were further investigated as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. The PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of FTO glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2//(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au. The mixed-ion 3D perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 was prepared by using a solvent-engineering technique according to the previous method.32Fig. 3a and b present the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and the energy level diagram of the fabricated PSCs. The perovskite crystals are penetrated into the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold (∼120 nm) and form a uniform capping layer with a thickness of ∼600 nm. The HTM layer (∼30 nm) is then spin-coated atop of the perovskite, followed by thermal evaporation of a layer of 80 nm gold as the back electrode. More detailed information regarding the solar cell fabrication is described in the Experimental section (shown in the ESI†).

(f) PCE statistics of 20 devices based on C201 and C202 as HTMs. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best PSCs based on pristine C201 and C202 as HTMs measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) are shown in Fig. 3c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Devices based on C201 as HTMs showed a rather low PCE of merely 8.7%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.51. By contrast, the photovoltaic parameters of the best performing C202-based device are much higher (Voc = 1.05 V, Jsc = 23.0 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.73), which led to an improved PCE of 17.7% under identical conditions. Hysteresis characteristics of C201 and C202 based devices are presented in Fig. S3 and summarized in Table S2.† Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed for PSCs with dopant-free C201 and C202 as presented in Fig. 3d. The C202-based devices exhibit higher IPCE values than those of C201-based devices over the entire region measured. The integrated current densities from the IPCE spectra of devices employing C201 and C202 are estimated to be 16.9 and 22.5 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well with the values from the J–V measurements. A stabilized power output at a maximum power point has been suggested to be an important index to judge the PCE.33 We carried out the steady-state photocurrent output of PSCs based on C201 and C202 as HTMs at the maximum power point for 200 s under one full sun irradiation as shown in Fig. S4.† The corresponding stabilized PCEs are shown in Fig. 3e. C202-based devices presented a considerably higher steady-state efficiency of 17.5% as compared to that of the devices using C201 (7.6%), which is consistent with the PCE values obtained from J–V characterization. The reproducibility of the PSCs incorporating C201 and C202 as HTMs were also examined based on 20 identical devices as displayed in Fig. 3f. The average PCEs of C201 and C202 based devices are 6.6 ± 0.7% and 16.9 ± 0.5%, respectively.

Although C201 possesses a more deep lying HOMO energy level and even a slightly higher hole mobility, the solar cell performance of devices based on such an HTM was found to be rather poor. In order to gain insights into the origin of the different photovoltaic performance observed for these two HTMs, the surface morphology and roughness of the perovskite films with and without HTMs were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic-force microscopy (AFM). The top view SEM image of the bare perovskite film is quite uniform, composed of 300–500 nm diameter crystals with very distinct grain boundaries (Fig. 4a). However, the top view of the HTMs atop of the perovskite layer is significantly different. It can be seen that there are lots of crystal-like sheets after covering the C201, indicating its great inclination to aggregation (Fig. 4b). As a result, C201 can only form an inhomogeneous and rough film, which cannot fully cover the surface of the perovskite. By stark contrast, C202 films show extremely uniform and good coverage on the top of the perovskite layer (Fig. 4c) (spiro-OMeTAD also shows a similar uniform SEM image, presented in Fig. S5†). The poor uniformity of C201 should be most likely due to its relatively lower solubility strongly correlated with its much better planarity. Tapping-mode AFM shows that the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite surface changes from 24.7 nm to 11.9 nm for C201 and 7.0 nm for C202, respectively (Fig. 4d–f). C202 has a denser and smoother film than C201, largely due to the incorporation of the larger moiety 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine, which can affect the molecular configuration and film formation property. The uniformity of the HTM capping layer on the top of the perovskite is essential, which has a significant impact on the charge recombination and charge extraction processes in the devices.

The dark J–V characteristics of PSCs with C201 and C202 as HTMs were further studied. The dark current is the parasitic current, whose direction is opposite to the photo-generated current, while the swift change of its intensity can reflect the strength of the built-in voltage (Vbi).34 As presented in Fig. 5a, C201-based devices show approximately 10 times larger dark current than that of C202-based devices in the range of −0.5–0.8 V. Estimated from the voltage that begins to depart from the diffusion current, C201-based devices show a Vbi around 0.85 V, while C202-based devices exhibit a Vbi around 1.0 V. This can be attributed to the improved electron blocking capability of the more homogeneous C202 capping layer, which can effectively prevent direct contact between the Au counter electrode and the perovskite. This in turn will reduce the charge recombination losses, accounting for higher Voc and FF obtained for C202-based devices.

To better understand the hole extraction capability of different HTMs, steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay measurements were carried out for the samples consisting of glass/perovskite with and without HTMs. As shown in Fig. 5b, the perovskite film exhibits an intense PL emission peak centered at 755 nm. After being covered by the HTMs, the intensity of PL was significantly quenched, indicating the transport of photo-generated charge from the perovskite to the HTMs. Meanwhile, C202 shows a stronger PL quenching ability, which may be resulted from improved contact at the perovskite/HTM interface linked to its more uniform surface morphology. In addition, the time-resolved PL decay curves are fitted using the bi-exponential fitting function, , and summarized in Table S3.† The average decay times were calculated using the equation .35 The PL lifetime of the perovskite decreases from 279.5 ns to 134.3 ns after coating C201, and to 82.3 ns after coating C202 (Fig. 5c) (as comparison, PL lifetime shrinks to 2.1 ns after covering spiro-OMeTAD, as shown in Fig. S6†). This result is in agreement with the steady PL quenching, indicating a stronger hole-extraction ability of C202, which leads to an improved photocurrent density.
The stability of PSC devices based on C202 was further examined in an ambient environment with relative humidity around 40% at a temperature of ∼22 °C, stored in the dark without encapsulation. For comparison, the stability of PSCs containing spiro-OMeTAD doped with Li-TFSI and t-BP was also tested under identical conditions (J–V characteristics shown in Fig. S7†). As presented in Fig. 6, devices with C202 as dopant-free HTMs exhibited relatively good stability, retaining ∼72% of the initial PCE after 288 h. In contrast, the devices using doped spiro-OMeTAD showed a much faster degradation rate, retaining only 23% of the original efficiency during the testing period. Water contact angle measurements were used to evaluate the moisture-resisting ability of the HTMs as shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The water contact angle of C202 (89.5°) is larger than that of doped spiro-OMeTAD (72.8°), suggesting the high moisture resistivity of C202. The hydrophobic characteristic of C202 can prevent the moisture attacking the perovskite film, leading to an improved ambient stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we for the first time developed two new ICZ core-based small molecule materials as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. They can be easily synthesized through only a three step reaction without using any expensive catalysts. Impressively, the best devices constructed with C202 showed a much higher PCE of up to 17.7%, which is considerably higher than that of devices based on C201 (8.7%) under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). This has been the highest efficiency for ICZ core-based HTMs in PSCs to date. The much-enhanced performance of C202-based devices should be attributed to the reduced charge recombination loss and improved charge extraction capability, strongly correlated to their more uniform film formation on top of the perovskite layer due to their low inclination to aggregate. Moreover, the PSCs containing C202 as the HTM also exhibited good long-term stability under ambient conditions (40% RH) as compared to devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD, due largely to the hydrophobic nature of C202 which prevented moisture from destroying the perovskite film. The present work demonstrates a new design strategy for developing cost-effective and stable HTMs for PSCs in the future.
