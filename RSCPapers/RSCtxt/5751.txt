    , Accepted 22nd June 2012First published on 19th July 2012AbstractThe battery–supercapacitor hybrid electrode, consisting of both faradaic rechargeable battery components and non-faradaic rechargeable supercapacitor components in a single electrode, is successfully developed using Li4Ti5O12–activated carbon (LTO–AC) hybrid nanotubes in a negative electrode for an advanced energy storage device. Li4Ti5O12 and PVA-derived activated carbon are hybridized with morphological control over the one-dimensional (1D) tubular structures via an in situ sol–gel reaction combined with electrospinning, followed by a hydrothermal reaction and appropriate heat treatment. The prepared LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes are tested at a variety of charge–discharge rates as anode materials for use in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that deliver a specific capacity in the range of 128–84 mA h g−1 over a 100–4000 mA g−1 charge–discharge rate in the potential range 1.0–2.5 V vs. Li/Li+. The hybridized LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes electrode is included in a new type of hybrid energy storage cell, denoted as BatCap, as the negative electrode using commercialized activated carbon (AC) as the positive electrode. The hybrid BatCap cell exhibits a high energy density of 32 W h kg−1 and a high power density of 6000 W kg−1, comparable to the properties of a typical AC symmetric capacitor.
Introduction
In view of the global energy crisis, the problems of resource exhaustion, climate change, and environmental pollution have accelerated the transition in the energy industry from an oil-based economy to an electricity-based economy. The current focus of national policies directed toward energy production is to promote the utilization of alternative energy resources.1–3 The harnessing of non-pollutive energy resources, including solar energy, geothermal energy, wind, and wave, is on the rise, and it is universally recognized that effective energy management systems must be evaluated in an effort to address the imbalances between energy supply and demand. Special attention has been paid to the development of electric vehicles that can switch the utilization of combustion engines due to the lower environmental impact of such technologies. High-performance energy storage devices that simultaneously collect high power and energy densities while displaying cycle stability have become extremely important.4–7
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors are currently considered to be the energy storage devices that are most suitable for converting electrical energy into chemical energy. However, typical LIBs and supercapacitors cannot meet the need of practical applications which demand high performance energy storage devices.8–10 LIBs are commonly used to store larger amounts of electrochemical energy relative to supercapacitors, meaning that LIBs indicate a high energy density. In contrast, supercapacitors are more appropriate energy storage devices than LIBs in the context of high-powered electric systems due to their higher power density and stable power generation properties. Therefore, several studies have focused on the development of a high rate capability to enhance the LIBs for use in high-performance electrical devices. Especially, because one of the most important limiting factors for the high-rate power generation of LIBs is slow charge transfer, many research efforts have been geared toward enhancing the charge transfer speed with material morphology control,11–14 composites with high-electrical conductive material,15–19etc. On the other hand, several supercapacitor designs have tried to introduce effective methods for increasing the capacitance to enhance the storable electrochemical energy. Typically, most material designs that have been proposed to improve supercapacitors have focused on higher surface area,20–22 larger working potential window,23–26 use of faradaic reaction with specified metal oxide,27–29etc., because energy densities are based on the capacitance and working potential window.30,31 Asymmetric electrode systems consisting of different electrode types have been proposed as advanced supercapacitors because they offer improved energy densities due to the differences in the redox potential of each electrode material.
Recently, a new approach to energy storage devices has been proposed, involving the hybridization of LIBs and supercapacitors, described by Amatucci et al.10,32,33 as a hybrid supercapacitor. The proposed cell design consists of a Li+ ion-active negative and electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) positive electrodes immersed in a Li salt containing an organic solvent. Hybridization of battery and supercapacitor electrodes combined with organic electrolyte results in the storage of a larger energy due to the wide working potential window of the organic electrolyte and the steady redox reaction potential of the battery-type negative electrode. Basically, good cycle performance of hybrid supercapacitors can be depressed by poor cycle stability of battery-type electrodes relative to EDLC-type electrodes. Therefore, the most important properties of the negative electrode in the hybrid supercapacitor are long-term cycling stability, rapid charge and discharge, and a higher energy density compared with activated carbon, for example Li4Ti5O12.31 Following the first clever proposal, there were reports of using Brookite (TiO2),31 graphite,34 and Li4Ti5O12–MWCNT composite35 as battery-type negative electrodes that can satisfy the conditions mentioned above in the presence of an activated carbon supercapacitor-type positive electrode.
The present work examines an advanced battery–supercapacitor hybrid energy storage device, the BatCap system, developed through hybridization of battery-type electrode material and supercapacitor-type electrode material at a single negative electrode.36 We developed Li4Ti5O12–AC (LTO–AC) hybrid nanotubes as negative electrodes for the BatCap system using electrospinning techniques, an in situ TiO2 sol–gel reaction combined with hydrothermal reaction to synthesize Li4Ti5O12, and, finally, heat treatment. The battery–supercapacitor hybridized electrodes could be charged and discharged via faradaic and non-faradaic mechanisms as a step process, thereby increasing the amount of energy that could be stored with a high rate. This complementary electrode system required a large surface area of the AC part to enable the faradaic mechanism, and better charge transfer properties with high electrical conductivity and short ion diffusion length for non-faradaic mechanism. Therefore, we attempted to implement a carbon activation process and synthesize a 1D-tubular morphological structure. The material characteristics and electrochemical performances of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes as negative electrodes in the BatCap system were investigated using a variety of analytic methods and electrochemical tests.
Experimental section
Reagents and chemicals
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Acros, average Mw = 88000), lithium ethoxide (LiEox) (Aldrich), lithium chloride (LiCl) (Aldrich), titanium isopropoxide (TIPP) (Aldrich), activated carbon (SX Ultra, Norit), and isopropylalcohol (IPA) (Daejung, Korea) were purchased and used without further purification.
Preparation of LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes
We prepared the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes via two steps.37 PVA was electrospun on the aluminum foil followed by an in situ TiO2 sol–gel reaction on the surface of the electrospun PVA nanofibers. PVA was dissolved in deionized water for 3 h with stirring at 70 °C to prepare the 7 wt% PVA aqueous solution. This solution was then transferred to a syringe connected to a metal needle and electrospun at a 1 mL h−1 feeding rate into a bath filled with a 0.02 M TIPP/IPA solution to synthesize the TiO2-coated PVA nanofibers (TCP-NF) via an in situ sol–gel reaction. The second stage involved the hydrothermal reaction of TCP-NF in the LiEox/LiCl/IPA solution followed by heat treatment to prepare the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. First, LiEox was dissolved in the 0.01 M LiCl/IPA solution during 30 min of stirring to yield the Li precursor for the phase transition from TiO2 to Li4Ti5O12. TCP-NFs were transferred into the 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave containing the LiEox/LiCl/IPA solution. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 150 °C over 72 h, and the product was washed with IPA several times to eliminate the unreacted precursors. Finally, the prepared sample was heat-treated in a tubular furnace at 800 °C for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere and 5 min under an air atmosphere to activate the PVA-derived carbonaceous phase in the composite.
Characterization of LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes
Microstructural and morphological analysis of the prepared materials was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) with standard procedures,38–40 a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL) operating at 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600, TA) was carried out to determine the proportion of the carbonaceous phase in the composite. A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 static volumetric gas adsorption instrument was used to measure the nitrogen adsorption isotherms of the composite at liquid N2 temperature using ultrahigh purity grade (99.9999%) gas.
Electrochemical tests of LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes
The electrochemical performances of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were tested using a battery cycler (WBCS3000, WonATech) in an Ar-filled glove box (Korea Kiyon). The electrodes of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were prepared using 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% carbon black, and 10 wt% polyvinylidene (PVDF) as the working electrodes in the half-cell performance tests and as the negative electrodes in the electrochemical performance tests. The anodic performances of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes in the LIBs were tested by assembling 2032 coin-type half-cells with lithium-metal as the reference electrode, Celgard 2400 as the separator, and a 1 M LiPF6 solution in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by volume ratio, Cheil Industry Inc.) as the electrolyte in the glove box. The electrochemical performances of the half-cell comprising LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were tested at various charge–discharge rates in the potential range 1.0–2.5 V vs. Li/Li+ in the constant-current mode. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study was carried out using a multi-channel potentiostat generator (VMP3, Biologic). Comparable half-cells containing commercialized Li4Ti5O12 as the active material were assembled and tested under the exact same experimental conditions to compare the electrochemical performance with those of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. Moreover, negative electrode performances of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes in the BatCap system were carried out using a three-electrode system with commercialized AC (SX Ultra, Norit) as the positive electrode, lithium-metal as the reference electrode, and as-prepared negative electrode. The positive AC electrode was prepared using an 80 wt% active material and 20 wt% PVDF as the binder. The electrochemical performances of the negative electrode in the BatCap system were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a coin-type half-cell and galvanostatic charge–discharge test with a LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system. The AC//AC symmetric supercapacitor system was fabricated using the same full-cell preparation process, and was tested to compare the electrochemical characteristics with those of the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC BatCap system.
Results and discussion
Microstructural and morphological characteristics of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes
The microstructure and crystal structure of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were analyzed using XRD yielding the results shown in Fig. 1A with a diffraction peak typical of the Li4Ti5O12 phase (space group: Fd3m, JCPDS card no.49-0207) in Fig. 1B. The cell parameter calculated from the XRD peaks for the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes was a = 0.8369 nm, which agreed well with the theoretical value of a = 0.8357 nm. These results also corresponded to the properties of the synthesized Li4Ti5O12 phase in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes after preparation. The carbonaceous material in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes displayed an amorphous phase that could not be detected in the XRD measurements.

The morphology of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes was investigated by FE-SEM and TEM imaging. SEM images, shown in Fig. 2A, clearly indicated that 1D morphology caused by an electrospinning procedure was well maintained after the hydrothermal reaction and heat treatment. The 1D-shaped LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were about 250 nm in diameter. Fig. 2B shows a magnified image of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, revealing evidence for the tubular structure formed by decomposition of the TiO2-coated PVA phase in the TiO2-coated PVA nanofibers (TCP-NF) under the in situ sol–gel reaction.37 In addition, the porous morphology on the surface of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes could be readily observed. The PVA phase is one of the promising precursors for activated carbon via an appropriate dehydrating agent and activation process.41–43 In this study, we impregnated LiCl into the TCP-NF as the dehydrating agent in the hydrothermal reaction process, followed by air-assisted surface activation during the heat treatment procedure.44 1D-tubular morphologies with porous surface structures were clearly revealed in the TEM analysis results. Fig. 2C shows the TEM analysis of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, and a high-magnification image of the surface region is indicated in Fig. 2D. These results present the obvious 1D-tubular structure of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, in good agreement with the SEM analysis results. Furthermore, the high-magnification image of the surface region, as shown in Fig. 2D, indicated the presence of morphological characteristics typical of AC materials, as reported previously.41,45 The carbonaceous materials in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes with an activated phase enhanced the electron transportation kinetics due to relatively higher electronic conductivity compared with the Li4Ti5O12 phase in the composite. Also, the activated phase with a large surface area can present additional sites for electrochemical energy as the EDLC. The proportion of carbonaceous materials in the composite was about 21.1 wt%, based on thermogravimetric analysis under air atmosphere up to 800 °C, as shown in Fig. S1.†

Surface characteristics of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes
Nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis was performed to characterize the surface textures of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 3. The similar surface characterizations were conducted on the Li4Ti5O12–carbon (LTO–C) hybrid nanotubes, which were prepared using the same procedure as that of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes except for the activation process, and LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes after heat treatment in the air atmosphere at 800 °C, denoted as air-LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. The surface characterization results are summarized in Table 1 to figure out the effects of the activation process on the surface area. Table 1 also lists estimates of the surface area of the carbonaceous phase in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. The BET specific surface area (BET SSA) of the carbonaceous material can be estimated as BET SSA divided by the mass of the carbonaceous phase due to no BET SSA of air-LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. Table 1 reveals that the BET SSA of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes is about 158 m2 g−1 much higher than that of the LTO–C hybrid nanotubes, despite the lower amount of carbonaceous phase present in the sample. These results indicated that the activation process effectively increased the surface area of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, thereby providing additional EDLC on the negative electrode. Also, the BET SSA of the carbonaceous phase in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes was calculated using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results in Table 1, which indicates similar values to the previous reports for PVA-derived AC materials.44,46,47

Raman spectroscopy and XPS were performed to obtain information about the surface chemical characteristics of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. Fig. S2† shows the Raman spectrum of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes in the Raman shift range from 900 to 1900 cm−1, which represents the crystalline perfection of the carbonaceous materials. The curve fit was obtained using a Gaussian fitting procedure with four superimposed Raman shift peaks at 1171, 1337, 1507, and 1604 cm−1. The curve deconvolution results are summarized in Table S2,† in which the values are similar to the results of typical amorphous carbon materials, especially the existence of peak 1 and peak 3 due to the sp3-rich phase and the C–H bond vibrations, respectively.48 This is in good agreement with the XRD analysis results, as shown in Fig. 1, in that no peak was observed around 2θ = 25° from the (002) plane of the graphite. Also, the relative intensity of peak 2 (D band) to peak 4 (G band), of which the value can be denoted as R = Ipeak2/Ipeak4 and which varies with the degree of graphitization and the alignment of the graphitic planes,49 was about 1.25. This value is lower than the typical R value for graphite, indicating the presence of a less-developed graphitic carbon structure on the surfaces of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes.50,51
Fig. S3† shows the XPS spectra of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, which provides useful information for various functional groups on the composite surfaces. The survey XPS spectrum in Fig. S3A† includes the clearly observed peaks corresponding to Li1s, Ti2p, and O1s due to the Li4Ti5O12 phase and C1s due to the activated carbonaceous materials in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. These results indicated the well-prepared Li4Ti5O12 phase and graphitic carbon as the most dominant carbon structures in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes.
Electrochemical performances of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes
We electrochemically characterized the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes as the anode for LIBs using half-cell performance tests at different charge–discharge rates in the potential range 1.0–2.5 V vs. Li/Li+. The anodic performance of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes is displayed in Fig. 4A, and a differential capacity vs. cell potential curve is shown in the inset image. At a charge–discharge rate of 100 mA g−1, the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes exhibited a specific capacity of 128 mA h g−1. This value approached the theoretical value of 131 mA h g−1 for the Li4Ti5O12 phase, which accounted for about 79 wt% of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. The potential values of the charge and discharge reaction for the composite sample were 1.59 V and 1.52 V vs. Li/Li+ at 100 mA g−1, respectively, which are typical potential values for Li4Ti5O12 as the anode in LIBs. These results indicated that the Li4Ti5O12 phase functioned well as the anode in the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes similar to the pure Li4Ti5O12.

The inset shows the differential capacity vs. cell potential curve at a charge–discharge rate of 100 mA g−1 during the second cycle. (B) Retained discharge capacity ratio of the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes and the pure Li4Ti5O12, and Coulombic efficiencies at various charge–discharge rates of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. 
The specific capacities at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mA g−1 were found to be 107, 104, 92, and 84 mA h g−1, respectively, indicating an enhanced rapid charge–discharge rate for the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes. Details are provided in Fig. 4B, which indicates the discharge capacities of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes and pure Li4Ti5O12 retained at various charge–discharge rates. The values were calculated as the values of the discharge capacity ratio at each charge–discharge rate compared with the discharge capacity at 100 mA g−1. As the charge–discharge rate increased beyond the low value regime, the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes yielded an excellent retained discharge capacity exceeding 67% at 4000 mA g−1 much higher than the value of the pure Li4Ti5O12, 14%.
We also performed the impedance analysis of the samples to understand the charge transfer kinetics in depth depending on the morphological controlled nanostructure and the hybridized electro-conducting phase in the composite. AC impedance data for the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes and pure Li4Ti5O12 half-cells were compared over the frequency range 100 kHz–10 mHz under an open circuit after preliminary equilibration. The Nyquist plots and analytic values of the samples are shown in Fig. 5 and Table S5.† The resistance values were normalized by multiplying the mass of the active material of each sample to attain a fair comparison.52 The impedance analysis results given in Table S5† clearly demonstrate that both the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the resistance of electrolyte (Rs) of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were much smaller than the corresponding values of the pure Li4Ti5O12. Furthermore, the Li+ ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) of the samples reflecting the charge transfer reaction kinetics, calculated using the impedance analysis values listed in Table S5.† The exchange current density of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes was higher than that of Li4Ti5O12, however, the DLi+ of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes (9.48 × 10−9 cm2 s−1) was one order of magnitude higher than the value for the pure Li4Ti5O12 (2.37 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) suggesting that the charge transfer reaction of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes was significantly better than the pure Li4Ti5O12, resulting in a good agreement at faster frequency responses, as shown in Fig. S6† and in previous publications studying the high rate capability of the Li4Ti5O12–carbonaceous material hybrid.53

As can be seen in the results, it is noteworthy that the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes provided better anodic performance at high charge–discharge rates with a great Coulombic efficiency close to 100%. Collectively, these results suggest that the morphological control over the nanosized 1D-tubular structures and PVA-derived activated carbonaceous phases of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes provides effective control over the electrochemical performance when used as the anode in LIBs at high rates. Particularly, 1D-tubular structure enhances the accessibility of the electrolytes to the active material surface resulting in better Li-ion transport kinetics. Accordingly, the presence of the PVA-derived activated carbonaceous phase in the 1D-tubular composite improved the electron transport kinetics, which determined the extent of the charge transfer reaction at high charge–discharge rates.36 The significantly enhanced electrochemical performances at high rate were attributed to better charge transport kinetics and can potentialize the use of LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes not only for the high-power LIBs but also in the BatCap system.
The LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes were also subjected to cycling over a potential range of 0.5–3.5 V at a variety of charge–discharge rates in an effort to evaluate the electrochemical performances as a negative electrode with AC as a positive electrode in the BatCap system. The mass of each electrode was fixed at mpositive/mnegative = 3 to fabricate the full-cell from the specific capacity information about the AC, as shown in Fig. S7,† because the highest energy density of the hybrid energy storage device can be generated through a balance of the exchanged charge between the positive and negative electrodes.31,34–36

Fig. 6 illustrates the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system with separated potential profiles for each electrode and full-cell. In the early state, the full-cell potential plot demonstrated the slow decrease in the curve-shaped slope because of a plateau region at the negative electrode (the red-colored potential profile) from the Li+ ion lithiation/delithiation reaction in the Li4Ti5O12 species around 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+. Then, the linear slope of the full-cell potential profile indicated a linear plot with a higher slope than the plot observed for the early state due to the end of the plateau region of the negative electrode above 2.2 V in the full-cell potential range. The negative electrode potential profile for the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system, the shape of which is differs substantially from the profile shapes of the pure Li4Ti5O12 or general activated carbon, could be explained in terms of the energy storage mechanism unlike typical symmetric capacitors. The AC part of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes could be operated as the EDLC until the negative electrode potential reached the faradaic reaction-available potential of Li4Ti5O12. The faradaic redox reaction potential around 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+ showed that the Li4Ti5O12 material could be charged or discharged as a battery material, indicating the potential to store a higher energy density than typical EDLC material, followed by another energy density increase from the EDLC material in the composite after a full faradaic redox reaction of the Li4Ti5O12 part. The potential range of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes was controlled over 0.7 V vs. Li/Li+ to prevent the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers that could disturb the charge transfer kinetics. The potential profile of the positive AC electrode in the hybrid BatCap system was nearly linear over the entire charge–discharge potential range up to around 4.0 V vs. Li/Li+. This result was typical of the EDLC electrode, indicating a good agreement with the CV curve presented in Fig. S7.†

The black-colored potential profile indicates the full-cell, the red-colored potential profile indicates the negative electrode of the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes, and the blue-colored potential profile indicates the positive AC electrode. 
The Ragone plot in Fig. 7 was obtained from charge–discharge measurements of the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system and the AC//AC symmetric capacitor system at a variety of power densities based on the total mass of both electrodes. The plot summarizes the electrochemical performances of each energy storage system. The LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system operated using a combination of an energy storage mechanism for a battery and an EDLC, as supported by the combined charge–discharge potential profile of a battery and an EDLC, as illustrated in Fig. 6. It was not appropriate, therefore, to estimate the electrochemical performance of this hybrid BatCap system using conventional equations for either batteries or supercapacitors. In a typical battery system, the energy density can be calculated based on the product of the state of charge, Q, and the working potential, V, per mass of the active material, due to the fixed potential value of the electrochemical redox reaction during the charge–discharge process. Otherwise, the energy density of a typical EDLC based on a supercapacitor can be estimated using the equation (1/2)QV, because the Q value is proportional to the working potential.54 Therefore, the energy densities of the hybrid BatCap system could be calculated by integrating the Q–V graph area during the discharge process, followed by unit conversion to W h kg−1.12 The maximum power density (PD) could be estimated using the equation, PDmax = VmaxI, in which Vmax is the maximum working potential and I is the charge–discharge current. However, the maximum power density calculated using this typical equation tended to overestimate the power of the concerned energy storage device that was actually available. The energy efficiency, i.e. the fraction of the total energy transferred from a device to the surrounding except for the energy lost due to heat generation, was calculated. The maximum power density could then be estimated using the equation PDmax = Vmax2/4R = VmaxI/2.34,36,55
 Fig. 7  Ragone plot for the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system and the AC//AC symmetric capacitor at various charge–discharge rates in the working potential range of 0.5–3.5 V. The data were calculated based on the total mass of the active electrode materials of both electrodes. 
As demonstrated in the Ragone plot in Fig. 7, the energy densities at a low power density, 50 W kg−1, for the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system and the AC//AC symmetric capacitor system are about 90 and 18 W h kg−1, respectively. The practical specific energy density of the LTO/AC hybrid nanotube//AC hybrid BatCap system can be expected to be close to 40 W h kg−1, as practical large batteries generally contain an electrode material mass of about 35–40 wt% of the total mass of the system, of which the value is 5–10 times higher than that of EDLCs using an acid or alkaline aqueous solution. At a high power density of 6000 W kg−1, the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes hybrid BatCap system exhibited an energy density of 32 W h kg−1 against only 14 W h kg−1 for the AC//AC symmetric capacitor system even at a much lower power density, 1000 W kg−1. These specific energy density values for the hybrid BatCap system reveal synergistic effects relative to the literature values for typical commercialized LIBs (about 10 W h kg−1 at 1000 W kg−1), EDLCs (about 5 W h kg−1 at 5000 W kg−1) or hybrid capacitors (about 15 W h kg−1 at 1000 W kg−1) consisting of pure Li4Ti5O12 and AC in each electrode.33
The results shown in Fig. 7 reveal that control over the 1D-tubular morphology of the composite with AC improved the electrical conductivity and shortened the ion diffusion length. Additionally, Li4Ti5O12–AC hybridization, which provided a higher storable charge from the EDLC of the AC and lithiation/delithiation of Li4Ti5O12, simultaneously affected the improvements in the power and energy densities.
Conclusion
A synthetic technique for the in -situ sol–gel reaction was combined with electrospinning, hydrothermal reaction, and heat treatment to successfully prepare LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes that can potentially enable advanced energy storage devices, such as the hybrid BatCap system, which includes both the battery-component and the supercapacitor-component in a single electrode. The LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes contributed 67% of the capacity ratio at a charge–discharge rate of 4000 mA g−1 in the half-cell performance test. These results indicated an excellent high power generation rate compared with the pure Li4Ti5O12, due to the better charge transfer kinetics, as shown by the impedance analysis results. The hybrid BatCap system was fabricated using the LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes as the negative electrode and AC as the positive electrode. The energy densities of the LTO/AC hybrid nanotubes//AC hybrid BatCap system were in the range 90–32 W h kg−1 over the power densities from 50 to 6000 W kg−1. These values permitted us to envision the hybrid BatCap system using LTO–AC hybrid nanotubes for the negative electrode with superior charge storage for high performance-required application.
