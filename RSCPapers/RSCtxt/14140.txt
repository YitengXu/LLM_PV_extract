    , Accepted 20th September 2017First published on 20th September 2017AbstractCation mixing has proved to be effective in stabilizing the high-temperature phase of formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites, affording high-performance n–i–p perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, optimum cation mixing is found to be inapplicable directly to NiO p–i–n PSCs due to the energy band misalignment. In the present study, we reveal the role of mixing cesium (Cs), methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) in the energy band alignments and the crystallization of perovskites in such a device structure. By tuning the composition of mixed cations, we have significantly improved the energy band alignments of perovskites in p–i–n NiO-based PSCs. The relative amount of Cs to MA cations also plays a decisive role in shaping the nature of perovskite precursors, thus impacting the quality of the resulting perovskite layer in NiO p–i–n PSCs. These insights and the associated engineering efforts led to a significantly improved power conversion efficiency of 18.6% based on the NiO p–i–n PSCs, in addition to their superior ambient stability to typical n–i–p PSCs.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been a rising star in solar energy conversion devices. In merely 7 years, the certified champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has leaped to 22.1% from an initial value of 3.8%.1,2 Among the PSCs with the highest PCE reported, formamidinium (FA)-based mixed-cation perovskite absorbers excel in their performance for both large and small area PSCs. Representatively, Grätzel et al. have reported a 1 cm2, FA-based PSC with a PCE of 20.5%.3 Saliba's group recently reported a rubidium-containing PSC with a similar perovskite material and achieved a PCE of 21.6% with photovoltage output as high as 1.24 V.4 However, almost all of the FA-based PSCs with high PCEs reported to date invariably used an n–i–p architecture with a typical TiO2-based mesoscopic layer, which has been shown to be detrimental to the overall device stability.5
As an alternative to n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs, inverted p–i–n PSCs have drawn increasing attention due to their superior stability, scalability, negligible hysteresis and simple processing.6 Among the common hole transport materials used in inverted PSCs (e.g. PEDOT-PSS and PTAA), planar NiO appears to be a promising choice because of its special stability.6–11 However, the PCE of this type of PSC is still falling behind. One of the reasons for the lower efficiency perhaps lies in the exclusive use of methylammonium (MA)-based perovskites, and thus to promote the efficiency of inverted PSCs, FA-based perovskite absorbers should be applied due to their higher theoretical PCE limit than MA-based perovskites. However, although it was reported that FA-based perovskites could be stabilized by Cs+, this strategy is yet to be applied to NiO inverted p–i–n PSCs to achieve high-performance. Unfortunately, it was found that the cation mixing of optimized FA-perovskites for normal n–i–p PSCs is not directly applicable to NiO p–i–n PSCs due to the unmatched energy band structures between the FA-based perovskite layer and the commonly used electron transport layer (ETL) such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).12
To achieve efficient charge transfer across the perovskite/PCBM interface, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite should be lower than that of PCBM (around 4.2 eV), and its valence band maximum (VBM) should also be much lower than that of PCBM (around 6.0 eV).13 The former is to ensure a sufficient driving force for electron injection while the latter is to prevent the holes from leaking into the ETL causing unwanted recombination.14 The narrow band gap of PCBM limits the possibility for perovskite materials to have a favorable energy band alignment. For FA-based perovskites, the CBM of pure FA-based perovskites is known to be lower than that of PCBM, and thus electron extraction is energetically hindered across this interface.12 Clearly, it is an unmet challenge to align the energy levels between FA-based perovskites and PCBM in inverted NiO p–i–n PSCs in such a way that charge collection is favored.
In this paper, by precisely tuning the perovskite composition, we obtained a stable high-quality triple cation perovskite thin film and realized a suitable band alignment between the triple cation perovskite and PCBM. By systematic optimization of the triple-cation perovskite layer, the NiO-based inverted PSCs achieved a PCE of up to 18.6% with superior ambient stability to TiO2-based n–i–p structured devices. In addition, controlled experiments were carried out to study the composition-dependent stabilization of FA-based perovskites by MA and Cs. It is revealed for the first time that the ratio of MA/Cs is critical in shaping the chemistry of perovskite intermediates and thus can be used to control the phase purity of the resulting perovskite film.
Results and discussion
Energy band tuning of the mixed cation perovskite for matching the ETL
Although mixed cation FA-perovskite solar cells have achieved record efficiencies on the common n–i–p device structure, application of such a mixed cation strategy to inverted p–i–n solar cells requires re-optimization of the energy band alignment and is yet to be realized. For the FAPbI3 perovskite, according to a previous study,15 the VBM at −5.67 eV relative to the vacuum level is below those of typical hole transport layer (HTL) materials (−5.2 eV for NiO and −5.3 eV for PEDOT-PSS4,7), meaning an energetically favored hole extraction across the perovskite/HTL interface. However, the CBM at −4.2 eV is literally equal to that of the mostly used PCBM ETL at around −4.2 eV,13,16 a non-ideal case for efficient electron extraction across the perovskite/ETL interface due to the lack of a driving force.17 In the present work, we have discovered that well-aligned interfacial energetics can be achieved by tuning the triple-cation composition of the perovskite layer, as will be detailed below.
To simplify the discussion, we applied a one-step protocol to deposit the triple-cation perovskite in a way similar to what has been reported previously.18 All the compositional adjustments were done by mixing perovskite stock solutions with different quantities of target ions.
In the present work, the composition of our perovskite films was set as 1.2 M CsaFAbMAcPbBrzI3−z with a + b + c = 1 and 0.12 M excess PbI2. The amount of Br doping (z value) was fixed at 0.33, that is, 0.40 M Br−. The excess PbI2 was added to promote the cell performance as reported previously.19 The PV device structure is FTO/NiO/perovskite/PCBM/bis-C60/Ag.

Fig. 1 illustrates our composition engineering strategy. Since Cs and MA are both minor cation components in the triple-cation perovskite, we first fixed their total relative amount to 1 and their ratio a:c to 3:2 and varied the ratio of FA:(Cs + MA) as x:1 (Fig. 1a). Next we changed the relative amount of Cs to MA while keeping FA = 0.9 M and (Cs + MA) = 0.3 M (Fig. 1b). The characterization and device performance results for these series of perovskite samples are presented below.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of compositional engineering by varying the ratio of (a) FA:(MA + Cs) = x:1 and (b) Cs:MA = y:(1/4 − y). 
First, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-vis spectroscopy14,20 were performed for the samples coated on the ITO substrate to probe the energy band structures of the mixed cation perovskites (Fig. S1–S3†). The resulting VBMs and CBMs for different compositions of the mixed cation perovskites are listed in Fig. 2a. The band gap of organohalide perovskites is known to be relatively insensitive to cationic substitution,21 and indeed the band gaps we obtained here for the various compositions are fairly consistent at around 1.6 eV, which is comparable to the reported values for a similar degree of Br doping.21,22 To our surprise, however, the positions of the VBM and CBM showed significant shifts when the mixed cation composition was varied. As shown in Fig. 2a, when x (FA:(Cs + MA) = x:1) was increased from 1.5 to 3, the VBM shifted significantly by as much as 360 meV from −6.10 eV to −5.74 eV. Finer tuning of FA3/4CsyMA1/4−y resulted in further, albeit smaller, band position variations as depicted in Fig. 2b. As the content of cesium was increased from FA3/4Cs0MA1/4 to FA3/4Cs7/40MA3/40 (FA, Cs and MA are denoted as F, C and M, respectively), the CBM and VBM shifted downwards gradually. For example, the CBM of F0.9M0.3 is at around −4.06 eV while that of F3/4Cs7/40MA3/40 is at −4.19 eV. Note that the band gap of F0.9M0.3 is 1.52 eV while those of other perovskite thin films are similar at around 1.6 eV. So F0.9M0.3 serves as a reference in this study, and the result shows that the substitution of MA cations with other cations lowered the band edges. The cationic composition is therefore proved to be capable of engineering the perovskite band structures. The reason underlying the energy band tuning lies perhaps in the charge density of the cations. For instance, FA+ has a lower charge density than the other cations and thus lower coulombic stabilization, which could raise the band edges relative to other samples.

(d) TRPL decay traces (excitation at 740 nm with 200 mW cm−2) of the perovskite layers in the presence and absence of the PCBM quenching layer. 
Next we examine the photovoltaic performance of these perovskite films. Bear in mind that effective electron extraction and hole blocking require the CBM and VBM of the perovskite to be above the CBM and VBM of the ETL.6,12Fig. 2c presents the PCE histograms of the NiO p–i–n PSCs using the mixed cation perovskites with different x values, the ratios of FA:(Cs + MA), and correspondingly different band edge matching between the perovskite and PCBM. A detailed analysis is carried out to reveal the correlation between the PCE and band alignment. To facilitate comparison, the photovoltaic data from champion devices are used (Table 1 and Fig. S4†). In Fig. 2a, the CBM of FA:(Cs + MA) = 1.5:1 (−4.51 eV) is lower than that of PCBM (−4.2 eV). So is the VBM of FA:(Cs + MA) = 1.5:1 (−6.10 eV), which is 0.1 eV lower than that of PCBM. The unmatched band edges indicate that the electron extraction across this interface is energetically unfavored and the holes could leak to PCBM to cause severe electron–hole recombination.17 Indeed, as shown in Table 1, the PCE of the band unmatched group “1.5:1” is poor (13.9%) due to a much lower current density of 18.9 mA cm−2. After tuning the ratio of FA:(Cs + MA) to 2:1, the CBM position became more suitable and thus the PCE increased to 16.4%. Interestingly, the Jsc, FF and Voc of “2:1” are all significantly higher than those of the “1.5:1” group. It can therefore be seen that the band edge mismatch plays a decisive role in the device performance. At this stage, however, the CBM of “2:1” (−4.3 eV) is only close to that of PCBM (−4.2 eV), indicating more room for tuning. Further tuning the ratio to FA:(Cs + MA) = 3:1 increased both the CBM (−4.15 eV) and VBM (−5.74 eV), which are significantly higher than those of PCBM, establishing a high driving force for electron extraction and at the same time a high energy barrier against hole leakage. Consequently, the “3:1” group outperformed “2:1” in terms of PCE by 31% reaching a value of as high as 18.2%, topping all of the studied in terms of Voc, FF and Jsc. What is more, this group also demonstrates a much narrower efficiency distribution showing a much better device reproducibility (Fig. 2c). The leap of Voc can be ascribed to the higher CBM which enlarges the built-in voltage, while the improved FF and Jsc demonstrate a more facile charge transfer due to the absence of an interfacial energy barrier. To further prove our analysis, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence studies (TRPL) of the “3:1” and “2:1” perovskites and perovskite/PCBM films, and the result is shown in Fig. 2d. The long components appearing in the PL decay of the perovskite/PCBM samples are due to the incomplete trapping of the intrinsic carrier while the fast decay is due to the carrier transfer between the perovskite and PCBM. Clearly, perovskite films with FA:(Cs + MA) = 3:1 (τ1 = 27.6 ns) exhibit only a slightly longer photoluminescence lifetime than the “2:1” film (τ2 = 23.4 ns), indicating similar carrier lifetimes. However, in the presence of PCBM, the PL lifetime of the “3:1”-perovskite/PCBM film (τ′1 = 8.1 ns) is clearly shorter than that of the “2:1”-perovskite/PCBM (τ′2 = 12.3 ns) film. We then compare the electron transfer efficiency η (obtained by ηn = 1 − τ′n/τn (ref. 23)) at the perovskite/PCBM interface. The electron transfer efficiency of “3:1”-perovskite/PCBM (η1) reaches 70% which is significantly higher than that of the “3:1”-perovskite/PCBM interface (η2 = 47%). Therefore, the solar cell with the “3:1”-perovskite demonstrates superior device performance.

On the other hand, variations in cationic composition (F3/4CsyMA1/4−y), that is, fixing the amount of FA but changing the ratio of Cs to MA, also resulted in significant changes in photovoltaic performance as listed in Tables 2 and S2.† Considering that the band alignments of this series (Fig. 2b) are suitable, it is important to know the origin of such variations, as will be discussed later.

Summarizing the above, we have demonstrated that the compositional adjustment of the A-site cations of the perovskite material could tune the electronic structure of the perovskite absorber and effectively the interface energy barrier, resulting in a decent PCE of more than 18% from the original value of 13%.15 The triple cation system, with our compositional engineering strategy, is proved to be able to be adapted to the NiO/PVK/PCBM planar p–i–n structure and produce a high PCE output. The triple cation perovskite shows impressive ability to accommodate different HTM–ETL combinations for perovskite solar cell devices.
Composition-dependent crystallization of the intermediate phase
For mono-cationic FAPbI3, to obtain a pure-phase perovskite layer, the annealing temperature needs to be higher than 175 °C.24 To stabilize the α-phase of the photoactive FA-based perovskite at a relatively low processing temperature, MA and Cs cations need to be doped into the perovskite material. In this way, the pure α-phase of the FA-perovskite can be obtained at around 100 °C, which could expand the scope of the perovskite device structure design.18,25,26 Although the FA-perovskite has been known to be stabilized by cation mixing, such a stabilization effect has not been systematically investigated yet except for a computational study.26 In the following, controlled experiments were carried out to study the composition-dependent stabilization of the FA-based perovskite by MA and Cs.
We first present the chemical and crystallographic changes of perovskite intermediate films resulting from varying the molar ratio of Cs/MA (Fig. 3a). To simplify the discussion, FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 and FA3/40MA7/40Cs3/40 were selected to represent Cs dominant and MA dominant triple-cation formulations while FA3/4MA1/4 and FA3/4Cs1/4 served as references of Cs-free and MA-free scenarios.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic representation of cation composition-dependent crystallization (1only the major crystalline phase is presented). XRD patterns of the (b) intermediate film and (c) annealed film. # and * denote the diffraction peaks of photo-inactive and photoactive FA-perovskite phases, respectively. (F = FA, C = Cs, and M = MA). 
The XRD patterns of the intermediate films (pristine perovskite film without thermal annealing) with different precursor compositions are shown in Fig. 3b. In the MA-free formulation (FA3/4Cs1/4), we identified for the first time DMSO-PbI2 as the intermediate phase in the one-step deposition process of the perovskite layer. As shown in the “F3/4C1/4” panel in Fig. 3b, the signature X-ray diffraction peaks of DMSO-PbI2 at 8.8° (110) and 9.4° (200)27 appear and help confirm our finding. On the other hand, when Cs was absent, the intermediate phase of formulation FA3/4MA1/4 was changed to the DMSO-PbI2-MAI adduct,28–31 which is characterized by XRD peaks at 6.6° (002), 7.3° (021) and 9.2° (022). In the case of triple-cation formulations, the XRD patterns of FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 and FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 resembled those of FA3/40MA1/4 and FA3/40Cs1/40, respectively, and showed the coexistence of DMSO-PbI2 and DMSO-PbI2-MAI peaks. From Fig. 3b, it can be seen that when the amount of Cs increases, the diffraction peaks of DMSO-PbI2 become dominant, but when the amount of MA increases, the diffraction peaks of DMSO-PbI2-MAI outcompete. Considering that the total amount of MA + Cs comprises only a quarter of the overall A-site cations in the formula, it is surprising to find that the variation of the Cs/MA ratio could have a decisive impact on the chemistry of perovskite intermediate films. One possible explanation is the dominant amount of DMSO in the perovskite precursor solution which drives the formation of a DMSO coordinated compound which crystallizes as the solvent withdraws in the spin-coating process.
The different precursor intermediates described above will certainly affect the subsequent crystallization processes of perovskite films and eventually have an impact on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting solar cell devices. Both intermediates of DMSO-PbI2-MAI and DMSO-PbI2 have been widely studied especially in MA-based perovskites.28,29,32 From previous studies, it is known that DMSO-PbI2-MAI contains edge-sharing triple trains29 of the negatively charged PbI6 octahedral backbone, to which MA cations are held through electrostatic interaction. However, this intermediate has not been observed until now in the deposition process of FA-based perovskites. Meanwhile, the DMSO-PbI2 intermediate was only observed in two-step (sequential) deposition processes of perovskite, and consists of neutral PbI5O double chains holding DMSO molecules via van der Waals force.29,32 In principle, DMSO-PbI2-MAI is more resistant to transformation to perovskite at room temperature than DMSO-PbI2 due to the inherently stronger intermolecular electrostatic interaction than the van der Waals interaction. In fact, DMSO-PbI2-MAI was used to retard the perovskite phase formation,28 whereas DMSO-PbI2 was used to facilitate the perovskite phase evolution.27
Now the key question is which intermediate is more favorable to the formation of the photoactive α-perovskite phase. First, DMSO-PbI2-MAI is more reluctant to exchange its content with FA cations than DMSO-PbI2 due to the stronger electrostatic binding. This would make the transformation to the α-perovskite phase less favorable. Second, the crystalline nature of DMSO-PbI2-MAI means that there is no entropic advantage of using MA cations to stabilize the photoactive FA-perovskite phase because MA is confined to the crystalline DMSO-PbI2-MAI. Together, DMSO-PbI2-MAI is in principle not a suitable intermediate for the formation of the photoactive perovskite phase with entropic stabilization from Cs and MA cations, and one could suspect that it may result in a poor perovskite film containing the δ-phase FA-perovskite. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3b, the DMSO-PbI2-MAI dominant intermediate films of FA3/4MA1/4 and FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 show conspicuous diffraction peaks of the low-temperature, photo-inactive FA-perovskite phase at 11.60° (010).24,33 After thermal annealing at 95 °C for an hour, such peaks are still noticeable (Fig. 3c), which reinforces our proposition that a portion of the MA cations fail to take part in stabilizing the α-phase of the FA-perovskite in the whole crystal growth process.
In stark contrast, the DMSO-PbI2 dominant FA3/4Cs1/4 and FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 films contain no observable δ-phase, the photo-inactive FA-perovskite phase, in both intermediate (Fig. 3b) and annealed films (Fig. 3c). Clearly, the absence of confined cations in DMSO-PbI2 led to the stabilization of the α-phase perovskite from the ingress of Cs and MA ions. It is also possible that DMSO-PbI2 can stabilize the α-phase perovskite by itself. To check if DMSO-PbI2 can facilitate the formation of the α-perovskite without Cs or MA under the same experimental conditions, we also perform XRD measurements on FAPbPbBr0.33I2.67. The XRD patterns of both intermediate (Fig. S5a†) and annealed films (Fig. S5b†) show dominant XRD peaks of the δ-phase perovskite. XRD peaks of DMSO-PbI2 can also be identified in the XRD pattern of the intermediate film. Therefore, DMSO-PbI2 can not effectively facilitate the formation of the photoactive phase effectively under the experimental conditions. The key to avoid the formation of the δ-phase perovskite is to avoid the confinement of MA and Cs cations by the crystalline intermediate phase. In this sense, DMSO-PbI2 is more favorable than DMSO-PbI2-MAI in the formation of the photoactive α-perovskite phase in the mixed-cation system.
To reiterate, when the amount of MA is dominant in CsyMA1/4−y, the evolution of DMSO-PbI2-MAI in the intermediate film limits the stabilization of MA cations and results in the formation of the photo-inactive δ-phase FA-perovskite. On the other hand, when the amount of Cs is dominant, the formation of DMSO-PbI2 does not induce undesired δ-phase FA-perovskite evolution (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 4 displays the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films derived from the two above-discussed formulations. The compositional variations are also confirmed by EDS mapping (Fig. S6†). Evidently, the cross-sectional image of the annealed FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 film shows a more monolithic feature (Fig. 4a) than that of FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 (Fig. 4b). Correspondingly, the top-view SEM image of the FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 film exhibits a more uniform, crystalline morphology indicating better film quality as compared to FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40. In a previous report, this was ascribed to the Cs modulated seeding process that subsequently directed the crystal growth.18 Our result indicates that the observed monolithic growth of perovskite crystals was enabled by the dominating DMSO-PbI2 intermediate phase.27 Advantageously, a more monolithic grain growth leads to higher film quality and eventually could be beneficial to the photovoltaic device performance. Further increase in cesium content leads to the appearance of pinholes which may be due to the faster crystallization (Fig. S7†).

Thanks to the higher perovskite film quality and better energy band alignment through the compositional engineering efforts detailed above, the FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 device shows a much higher PCE with a maximum PCE of 18.6% compared to 15.5% for the FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 ones (Table 2). As the J–V curves in Fig. 5a show, FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 excels mainly in terms of Jsc and FF which is the result of phase purity and perovskite film quality as discussed previously. Fig. 5b shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of different perovskite formulations. It is reasonable to speculate that the presence of the photo-inactive perovskite in FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 is detrimental to the photo-electron conversion. Therefore, the FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 device demonstrates superior solar to electricity conversion as compared to FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 which re-emphasizes its superior phase purity and film quality. The integrated current of FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 (21.91 mA cm−2) is considerably higher than that of FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 (18.53 mA cm−2) and is in accordance with the Jsc data of the respective devices (Fig. 5b).

In addition, intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) is applied to derive the carrier lifetime of the devices and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5c.34 It is observed that the FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 device has a longer carrier lifetime than FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40. Under the same device structure, the longer carrier lifetime indicates a higher film quality of FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 with fewer recombination centers. To further examine the charge transport properties of the two devices, impedance spectroscopy (IS) is performed at different applied biases in the dark (Fig. 5d). The equivalent circuit model for fitting is shown in the inset of Fig. 5d. The recombination resistance Rrec obtained from fitting with the equivalent circuit of FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 is significantly lower than that of FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 which is consistent with the IMVS result where such a device demonstrates a shorter carrier lifetime due to severe recombination. Combined with the crystallographic data presented above, it can be reasonably concluded that the presence of the photo-inactive perovskite phase in FA3/4MA7/40Cs3/40 can lead to an increase in charge recombination and decrease in carrier lifetime. Therefore, the FF and Jsc of such a device are significantly lower than those of FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 with the pure perovskite crystal phase (Fig. 5a). With the high-quality film, the FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 device shows a stable photocurrent output (22.51 mA cm−2) at 0.80 V and a steady PCE at 18.0% within 300 s (Fig. 5e). The stable photovoltaic output is consistent with its minor hysteresis as shown in Fig. 5f.
The film quality as well as the phase purity of FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 result in its prevailing photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE of 18.6%. As compared to the normal structure device using the same perovskite formulation, the inverted device shows higher ambient stability at a humidity of 20–30% with encapsulation (Fig. S8†). More than 80% of the initial PCE is retained for inverted PSCs, while for the normal structure device the efficiency drops by more than 40% in 8 days. As can be seen from the picture shown in Fig. S8,† after 8 days, the edge of the Ag electrode on the normal structure cell has completely decayed and turned to black and presents no current in J–V measurement. The reason could be iodide ion migration from the perovskite layer to the electrode.35 It is also important to know whether the mixed-cation perovskite is more stable than conventional MAPbI3. To simplify the picture, we examine the stability of the two formulations (FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 and MAPbI3) with bare films (Fig. S9†). After 14 days of storage, the MAPbI3 deposited on NiO has decomposed to a great extent to yellow lead iodide while the mixed-cation film reserves its original appearance. In all, the FA3/4MA3/40Cs7/40 perovskite shows higher ambient stability than MAPbI3, and when applied to the solar cell device, the inverted structure cell is more stable than the normal structure cell under an ambient environment.
As an interim summary, the power of compositional engineering contributes to the adjustability of crystallization and photo-electronic properties of the FA-perovskite material. On the other side of the coin, with the change of composition, the optimum processing conditions or solvent composition will concurrently change. In other words, there is still enormous scope for tailoring the perovskite material to achieve the desired outcome.
Conclusion
We have examined the possibility of promoting the photovoltaic device efficiency by compositionally tailoring the A-site cations of FA-perovskite materials. By systematically tuning the values of a, b and c in CsaFAbMAcPbBrzI3−z, we were able to adjust the band edges of the perovskite absorber to overcome the energy barrier for charge transport through the perovskite/ETL interface. Furthermore, we discovered the change in chemical essence of the perovskite intermediate film with the variation of the Cs/MA ratio. The presence of the DMSO-PbI2-MAI intermediate in the pristine perovskite film was found to cause the evolution of the photo-inactive perovskite phase in the MA-rich perovskite formulation. We obtained a pure-phase, high-quality perovskite absorber FA3/4Cs7/40MA3/40PbBr0.33I2.67 by tailoring the Cs/MA ratio and the resulting device shows an improved PCE of 18.6% which is among the highest reported for the FA-based perovskite solar cells in the p–i–n inverted structure based on the inorganic hole transporting layer. The NiO-based inverted structure device also demonstrates superior ambient stability as compared to the TiOx-based n–i–p structure solar cell. Together, our work provides new insights into the cation-mixing induced stabilization of the photoactive FA-based perovskite and the attendant energy band re-engineering needed to devise high-performance NiO p–i–n perovskite solar cells.
