    , Accepted 15th December 2021First published on 21st December 2021AbstractAttributed to the rapid development of benzodithiophene (BDT) centered small molecule donors, all small molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have achieved comparable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) (>15%) along with high reproducibility, in contrast to polymer-based OSCs. However, the difficulty and complexity of synthesizing BDT-derived donors limit their cost performance and commercial application. Distinct from the relatively high synthetic complexity that exhibited by most BDT-derived small molecule donors, oligothiophene donors are much more accessible. However, the performance of oligothiophene donors has been unsatisfactory (PCE < 12%). Here, by employing an A–π–A′–π–A structure, a novel thiazole-centered cost-effective oligothiophene donor Tz6T is developed. By incorporating a nonfullerene acceptor eC9-4F, Tz6T based binary ASM-OSCs achieve a milestone efficiency of 15.4% (the certified PCE is 14.8%). This PCE record not only pushes oligothiophene to the forefront of small molecule donors, but also represented one of the crest values achieved by oligothiophene donors.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been garnering increasing attention due to their unique advantages such as environmental friendliness, solution processability and flexibility.1–5 Especially in recent five years, the rise of small molecule (SM) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), structured with a fused electron-rich cyclic core and electron-deficient flanks, brought a skyrocketing improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs.6–13 By employing state-of-the-art polymer donor/NFA binaries, a PCE of over 18% has already been achieved in single junction OSCs.14–18 Considering that the mass production of photovoltaic materials is a must for the commercialization of OSCs, although polymer donors exhibit unparalleled PCE values, their inconsistent device performance caused by batch-to-batch variations in the molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) remains a major challenge.19–22 To tackle the inconsistency problem of polymer donors, the responsibility naturally fell on SM donors which not only show a negligible batch-to-batch inconsistency in photovoltaic behavior, but also have a well-defined and easily-tunable structure.23,24
Recently, benzodithiophene (BDT) based donors have made significant progress in the SM-donor/SM-NFA, i.e., all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs. A PCE of over 15% has already been realized by NFA based OSCs containing elaborately designed BDT donors.25–30 Meanwhile, in spite of much lower synthetic cost, the development and PCEs of oligothiophene based donors have been unsatisfactory. From the era of fullerene acceptors to the present era inaugurated by NFAs, oligothiophene donors have been intensively investigated as electron-donating materials in organic photovoltaic research and technology.31,32 Besides exhibiting superior charge transport and excellent intrinsic stability, the breakthroughs of concise and low-cost syntheses of regio-regular oligothiophene derivatives also attracted wide attention and spurred the investigation of cost-effective oligothiophene donors.33–36 The benchmark of oligothiophene donors, a sepithiophene based molecule DRCN7T, was first reported by Chen et al. with an impressive PCE of 9.3% in blend with PC71BM; the following modified pentathiophene analogue DRCN5T further pushed the record to 10.1%, which was not only one of the best performance achieved by single-junction ASM-OSCs reported, but also outperformed most BDT donors in the fullerene system.37,38 Judging from the structures and synthetic routes of the representative BDT donor BTR and oligothiophene donor DRCN7T (Scheme S2†), it can be seen that while they share very similar π-linkers, terminal groups and photovoltaic performance in the fullerene system (PCE of ca. 9.3%), the facile synthesis of the central unit causes a significant decrease in time cost and raw material cost when synthesizing DRCN7T.39 Regrettably, situation has been changed since NFAs rose. At present, in most NFA systems, oligothiophene donors exhibited much inferior performance (<10%) to BDT donors.40,41
To enhance the performance of oligothiophene donors in ASM-OSCs, many attempts have been made from the perspective of molecular engineering. When designing a SM donor molecule, no matter an oligothiophene or BDT derivative, using the A–π–D–π–A structure is the most frequently adopted strategy. All top BDT donors (PCE > 15%), without exception, are featured with the A–π–D–π–A backbone.25–30 However, for high performance oligothiophene donors, it has been found that probably the A–π–A′–π–A structure is a more suitable design. Previously, by replacing the electron-donating central thienyl unit of DRCN7T with an electron-withdrawing di-chlorinated thienyl unit, SM donor 2Cl7T (Fig. 1a) was conveniently synthesized and a PCE of 11.5% was achieved by using the 2Cl7T:Y6 binary.42 This PCE record is not only an almost fivefold enhancement compared to that of A–π–D–π–A structured DRCN7T (ca. 2.3%), but also one of the highest records achieved by oligothiophene donors. Unfortunately, compared with eximious BDT donors, the PCE still lags far behind (Table S12†).

In this contribution, following the study of 2Cl7T, a novel A–π–A′–π–A structured oligothiophene donor Tz6T was prepared by replacing the central unit of 2Cl7T with chlorinated thiazole, a more electron-deficient unit (Fig. 1a). In comparison to its predecessor 2Cl7T, Tz6T demonstrated blue-shifted absorption spectra, deepened energy levels and improved crystallinity. After being employed as the donor material in OSCs with the NFA eC9-4F, a milestone PCE of up to 15.4% was achieved by Tz6T:eC9-4F binary solar cells (the certified PCE is 14.8%). This result not only makes the performance of oligothiophene donors parallel to that of top BDT donors, but also reveals that oligothiophene donors are still promising candidates for scale-up productions and applications of OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and thermal analysis
The NFA eC9-4F and SM donor 2Cl7T used in this work were synthesized according to previous literature.42,43 The synthetic procedure of chlorinated donor Tz6T is depicted in Fig. 1a and the ESI† (Section 1, Synthetic protocols). The thiazole-centered organotin 4 was synthesized via a Stille coupling followed by the stannylation. The head-to-tail bithiophene segment 5 was concisely built via consecutive regio-controlled cross-coupling reactions followed by acetylation and bromination.44 Then the thiazole-centered backbone was constructed through a Stille coupling between organotin 4 and segment 5. Finally, the terminal group 7 was connected to the oligothiophene via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction to generate the donor molecule Tz6T. The unreported intermediates and high-purity Tz6T were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) (see the ESI†). In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S3a†) shows that Tz6T exhibits excellent thermal stability and decomposes (5% loss) only above 395 °C (vs. 392 °C for 2Cl7T). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. S3b†) results indicate that Tz6T exhibits a melting temperature (Tm) of 221 °C, and the cooling scans show a propensity of crystallization around 201 °C.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of Tz6T were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S1,† the diluted chloroform solution (ca. 5 × 10−6 mol L−1) of Tz6T shows that the main absorption band ranges from ca. 440 nm to 570 nm with the absorption peak located at 517 nm. However in the thin film (Fig. 1b), not only the absorption peak of Tz6T red-shifted from 517 nm to 586 nm, but also a notably extended absorption band ranging from ca. 430 nm to 690 nm was observed attributed to the enhanced π–π stacking interactions. In addition, the absorption onset of the thin film of Tz6T is 729 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptgap) of ca. 1.70 eV. Therefore, the light capturing range of Tz6T is complementary to the absorption of NFA eC9-4F that would favor solar energy harvesting.
To determine the energy levels of Tz6T, its electrochemical behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S2a,† by replacing the central dichlorothienyl unit with chlorothiazole, the EOX of SM donors shifted from 0.85 V (2Cl7T) to 0.87 V (Tz6T). And the corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of Tz6T is slightly deepened to −5.35 eV, which is expected to favor the VOC of Tz6T-based OSCs. Apparently, the ΔEHOMO offset between donor Tz6T and acceptor eC9-4F is enough to prompt exciton dissociation in the blend film (Fig. 1c and S2b†). Overall, it can been seen that Tz6T shares quite similar photophysical and electrochemical properties to 2Cl7T (Table 1).

2.3. Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate how this central-unit-substitution design affects the photovoltaic performance of oligothiophene donors, the ASM-OSCs based on 2Cl7T and Tz6T were fabricated and characterized, respectively. Y6-derived molecule eC9-4F was chosen to be the acceptor, and the conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Phen-NaDPO45/Ag was adopted. The measurement of OSC devices was conducted under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The detail of the device optimization process is described in the ESI,† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Tables S2–S4.† The J–V plots and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2a and b, and the detailed photovoltaic performance parameters are shown in Table 2.

With the binary system of 2Cl7T:eC9-4F with 1.8:1 D:A mass ratio and 18 mg mL−1 concentration, ASM-OSCs annealed at 120 °C gave a champion PCE of 12.55% with a JSC of 21.32 mA cm−2, a VOC of 861.3 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 68.33%. As for the Tz6T:eC9-4F binary, the optimized D:A mass ratio and concentration was unchanged except that the thermal annealing temperature was elevated to 150 °C, but a drastically enhanced PCE of up to 15.4% was achieved without using any additive. Notably, a certified PCE of 14.80% was recorded in the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) (Fig. S5†) to verify the reliability of our data. As shown in Fig. 2c, this is a landmark PCE record for oligothiophene donors. Judging from the photovoltaic parameters shown in Table 2, both 2Cl7T and Tz6T based devices achieved a satisfactory VOC above 860 mV, and the PCE surge of Tz6T was mainly attributed to the simultaneously increased JSC (25.14 mA cm−2) and FF (70.86%). Agreeing well with the superior JSC measured by using a solar simulator, the EQE spectrum of the Tz6T based device exhibits a much higher response across the whole UV-Vis-NIR region than that of the 2Cl7T based device. And the EQE stays above 70% from ca. 440 to ca. 840 nm for Tz6T which guarantees efficacious photon-electron transfer. The integrated JSC values from EQE curves are 24.62 and 20.92 mA cm−2 for Tz6T:eC9-4F and 2Cl7T:eC9-4F devices, respectively, which coincide with the measured values with a deviation less than 2.5%. In addition, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was adopted to analyze the evaluation of JSC. As reported, the IQE can estimate the efficiency of the absorbed incident photon extract free charge based OSCs.46 As depicted in Fig. 2b, the IQE of the Tz6T:eC9-4F device is significantly enhanced in the range from 450 to 850 nm, which is the contributor to the higher EQE photoresponse.
2.4. Charge carrier transport
To elucidate why the Tz6T:eC9-4F blend exhibits superior photovoltaic performance, charge carrier dynamics is investigated in various ways. In OSCs, bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination are the two major charge-carrier recombination channels that would result in the loss of FFs and PCEs. To probe how these recombination losses affect the device performances, J–V characteristics under different light intensities were measured for Tz6T:eC9-4F and 2Cl7T:eC9-4F. To quantify the bimolecular recombination rate, the relationship between JSC and light intensity was investigated. According to previous reports, JSC and incident light intensity (I) show a power-law dependence of J ∝ Iα, where α represents the power factor. The bimolecular recombination efficiency (η) then can be quantified as η = 1/α − 1, which means the closer the α is to 1, the more unlikely bimolecular recombination occurs. The fitted α values of the devices are shown in Fig. 3a. Similarly, the trap-assisted recombination can be recorded by monitoring the relationship between VOC and light intensity. Usually, VOC and the natural logarithm of I are related as VOC ∝ n(kT/q)ln(I), where k, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively. The value of n ranges from 1 to 2, and n equals to unity indicates trap-free conditions. Any deviation from 1 indicates that charge-carrier traps exist to a certain degree in the active layer or the interface between the active layer and the electrode in the device. The fitted n values of the devices are shown in Fig. 3b. For the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F and Tz7T:eC9-4F devices, the α values are 0.987 and 0.993, and the n values are 1.36 and 1.13, respectively. That means the device based on Tz6T:eC9-4F not only is affected less by bimolecular recombination, but also suffered less trap-assisted recombination than the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F based device. Hence, the photovoltaic performance of the Tz6T:eC9-4F binary was essentially enhanced.

Transient photocurrent/photovoltage (TPC/TPV) characterization was also performed to quantitatively analyse the charge recombination and extraction in devices. As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocurrent decay curves of the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F and Tz6T:eC9-4F devices are highly overlapped giving almost identical decay time of 1.07 μs and 0.85 μs, indicating that the charge extraction from the Tz6T:eC9-4F device is more efficient than that from the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F device. Meanwhile, the carrier lifetime (τ) was obtained from fitting of the TPV signal with equation: y = A × exp(−x/τ), and the values of 33.12 μs and 69.43 μs were obtained for 2Cl7T:eC9-4F and Tz6T:eC9-4F devices (Fig. 3d), respectively. A τ value of 69.43 μs for the superior device based on Tz6T:eC9-4F is ca. 2.1 times larger than that of 2Cl7T:eC9-4F. These results indicate that with a much prolonged charge carrier lifetime and faster charge extraction, the Tz6T:eC9-4F device exhibits the capability of efficiently extracting charge and suppressing recombination which is indisputably beneficial to the improvement of the FF.
Besides the charge extraction/combination, the FF is also strongly correlated with the charge transport in D:A blends. Therefore, the hole-transport/electron-transport diodes were fabricated based on 2Cl7T:eC9-4F and Tz6T:eC9-4F devices to evaluate their charge transport properties. The hole-transport only diodes with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag configuration and electron-transport only diodes with an ITO/ZnO/Phen-NaDPO/active layer/Phen-NaDPO/Ag configuration were fabricated, respectively. As presented in Fig. 3e and f, by replacing 2Cl7T with Tz6T, the hole mobility (μh) of the blend increased from 7.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility (μe) also increased from 1.28 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.46 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared with 2Cl7T:eC9-4F, Tz6T:eC9-4F blends not only demonstrated essentially boosted charge mobilities (hole/electron), but also showed a more balanced μh/μe value (0.89 vs. 0.58 for 2Cl7T:eC9-4F). These features guarantee efficacious charge transport and collection as well, consequently leading to an improved JSC and FF in Tz6T:eC9-4F devices.
2.5. Morphology characterization
The surface and bulk morphology of the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F, and Tz6T:eC9-4F based films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. As demonstrated in AFM height images (Fig. 4a and b), the Tz6T:eC9-4F film presents a root mean square roughness (Rq) value of 1.04 nm, larger than that of the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F film with a value of 0.98 nm. In general, the surface roughness is correlated with the crystallinity features beneath,47 and the larger roughness result from the stronger crystallinity of the Tz6T:eC9-4F film. From the TEM images (Fig. 4c and d), the phase separation of Tz6T:eC9-4F is more obvious with formation of the fibrous structure, demonstrating the high crystallinity of the thiazole-centered oligothiophene induced blend films which indisputably benefits the charge separation and transportation. The morphology data are in accordance with the information from mobility measurement, which can effectively explain the enhancement of the FF and JSC.

(a, b) AFM height images of 2Cl7T:eC9-4F and Tz6T:eC9-4F blend films; (c, d) TEM images of 2Cl7T:eC9-4F and Tz6T:eC9-4F blend films; (e–h) 2D GIWAXS patterns of relevant neat and blend films; (i) in plane and out of plane line-cut profiles of relevant neat and blend films. 
The molecular packing and orientation properties were recorded by using grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) images, and the 2D patterns which are shown in Fig. 4e–h and S6,† respectively. The 1D line-cut profiles of these films are presented in Fig. 4i and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Tables S5 and S6.† As depicted in 2D GIWAXS images (Fig. 4e–h and S6†), the molecular orientation of 2Cl7T and eC9-4F shows a preferential face-on direction as previously reported,42,43 whereas Tz6T presents aeolotropism, and so promises to form a 3D network with eC9-4F to facilitate charge transport. Indeed, the Tz6T film shows the stronger intensity of (200) and (300) diffraction signals compared to that of the 2Cl7T film in the out-of-plane direction, which implies higher crystallinity of the Tz6T film with lower defects. As for blend films, the Tz6T:eC9-4F film exhibits (010) π–π stacking at qz = 1.35 Å−1 with a coherence length (CCL) of 3.02 nm, and the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F film presents (010) π–π stacking at qz = 1.36 Å−1 with a CCL of 2.45 nm. Although the intermolecular distance difference between Tz6T:eC9-4F and 2Cl7T:eC9-4F films is negligibly small, the larger CCL and higher diffraction intensity of Tz6T:eC9-4F as compared to 2Cl7T:eC9-4F, indicate the much higher crystallinity of Tz6T:eC9-4F, which accounts for the higher mobility, fewer defects and superior photovoltaic performance in the Tz6T:eC9-4F blend film.
2.6. DFT calculations and prospects
For an in-depth study on how the subtle change in the central unit of oligothiophene donors causes substantial differences in photovoltaic performance, and to shed light on further performance optimization of oligothiophene donors, theoretical calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Gaussian 16 program to explore the electronic structure of ground and excited states and donor–acceptor interactions on the molecular level.48 Geometries of all molecules and donor–acceptor complexes were optimized at the PBE0/def2-SVP level with Grimme's D3BJ empirical dispersion correction. The PCM solvation model was used with diphenyether (ε = 3.73) as the solvent in all the calculations to simulate the dielectric environment of the solid state.49 The electronic structure of excited states was obtained using time dependent density functional theory at the same level of theory. The hole–electron distribution and excited state analysis were performed by using the Multiwfn program.50
First, the relaxed excited state properties of a single donor molecule were obtained. According to the results (Table S9 and Fig. S7†), 2Cl7T and Tz6T share very similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels, but the larger hole–electron distance (D_idx), dipole moments of the S0 and S1 state (μS0 and μS1) and smaller hole–electron overlap (Sr) suggest a stronger CT character of Tz6T compared with that of 2Cl7T. Next, the torsion angle next to the central chlorinated thiazole/thiophene was relax scanned and the results are shown in Fig. S8.† It's found that the torsion potential surface of 2Cl7T is very flat from 0° to 150°. The rising of potential at 180° is due to the repulsion between the chlorine atom and adjacent alkyl chain. On the other hand, the introduction of nitrogen in Tz6T leads to a large torsional barrier at 90° and correspondingly a narrow angle distribution around 0° or 180°. To investigate the extent of energy disorder caused by this torsion angle distribution difference, the S1 state transition energies and Boltzmann probability were computed at each scanned angle and the results are shown in Fig. S8c, d and Table S11.† Then the Boltzmann probability weight standard deviation of S1 state transition energies was computed to illustrate the extent of energy disorder. The resulting value is 0.01 eV for Tz6T and 0.09 eV for 2Cl7T, and the smaller energy disorder of Tz6T would contribute to its improved VOC.51–53
The electrostatic potential (ESP) of two donors and eC9-4F was also calculated to probe how the intermolecular interaction affects the charge generation/recombination in two different binaries. As shown in Fig. 5a, the nitrogen in Tz6T has an evidently more negative electrostatic potential around it compared to 2Cl7T, which will generate a repulsion force to the negatively charged acceptor moiety of eC9-4F. This repulsion force will decrease the contact between the donor moiety in D and acceptor moiety in A. To illustrate this point, the stacking energy of the central unit of Tz6T and 2Cl7T with the acceptor moiety of eC9-4F was computed. The stacking energy of Tz6T was found to be 2.27 kcal mol−1 smaller than that of 2Cl7T, using their stacking energy with donor moiety of eC9-4F as the reference (Fig. S9†). And the mitigated D:A interaction is essential for avoiding the hypermiscibility issue and attaining a favorable morphology in the Tz6T:eC9-4F blend.54

This weakened Tz6T:eC9-4F interaction is also reconfirmed by the results of contact angle measurement. The miscibility of the donor/acceptor in the blend was estimated from the solubility parameter (δ) of each component. When the δ values of two components are close (i.e. the difference of two values (Δδ) is small enough), they are more likely to form a well-mixed and less phase separated morphology in the blend film, indicating good miscibility.55–57 The δ value can be calculated with equation: , where γ is the surface energy of the material, and K is the proportionality constant (K = 116 × 103 m−1/2).58–60 The surface energy of each material was calculated from the contact angle measurements (Fig. S4 and Table S1†). It can be seen that compared with the negligible Δδ of 2Cl7T:eC9-4F (0.000738), the Δδ of Tz6T:eC9-4F essentially increased (0.046), demonstrating the alleviated miscibility of Tz6T:eC9-4F.
Additionally, the D/A complexes were optimized at the S1 state to investigate the charge separation at the D/A interface (Fig. 5b–e). Two conformers were calculated for each D/A pair, where the acceptor moiety of the donor molecule (2Cl7T or Tz6T) stacks with the donor or acceptor moiety of the eC9-4F molecule. Tz6T exhibits a smaller exciton binding energy at both interfaces (Table S2†), which should facilitate the charge separation process. The smaller exciton binding energy should be the result of more CT character of the standalone Tz6T molecule.
From DRCN7T (PCE of ca. 2.3%) to 2Cl7T (PCE of ca. 12.6%) then to Tz6T (PCE of ca. 15.4%), it can be clearly found that to design high performance oligothiophene, using the A–π–A′’–π–A structure, is a more effective and convenient pathway. Moreover, combining the feedback from DFT calculations and the characterization results, several semi-empirical rules can be summarized for further optimization of oligothiophene donors: first of all, introducing a certain electron-withdrawing functional group into the central unit of oligothiophene is pivotal. It can not only enhance the VOC of devices, but also generate a repulsion force to the negatively charged acceptor moiety of commonly used NFAs which leads to reduced charge recombination. Secondly, the fine-tuned plane of the donor backbone is also important to achieve smaller energy disorder which would contribute to its improved VOC; finally, besides inserting the electron-withdrawing functional group, the asymmetric central unit could reinforce the intramolecular CT feature of the donor as well, which would facilitate the charge separation.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a new thiazole-centered oligothiophene donor Tz6T with the A–π–A′–π–A structure was developed for OSC devices. Similar to its predecessor 2Cl7T, the introduction of electron-withdrawing atoms (nitrogen and chlorine) into the central unit results in a low lying HOMO energy level and a wide band gap absorption profile. By blending with NFA eC9-4F, Tz6T-based devices demonstrate a PCE of 15.38% while 2Cl7T only exhibits a PCE of 12.55%, which is a milestone record for cost-effective oligothiophene donors among reported SM donor families. The simultaneously enhanced JSC and FF of Tz6T-based devices realized this boosted PCE, and all the results of charge carrier dynamics measurements corroborated the superiority of the Tz6T:eC9-4F blend. Compared with the 2Cl7T:eC9-4F blend, the Tz6T:eC9-4F film not only exhibits higher crystallinity, and improved and more balanced hole/electron mobilities, but also ameliorated charge extraction and collection. From the perspective of molecular design, it can be concluded from the DFT calculation results that the introduction of the nitrogen atom into the central unit is the key to designing high performance oligothiophene donors. The more ordered conformation of Tz6T and more negative ESP around the central unit of Tz6T would reduce energy disorder and charge recombination, respectively, and they both can be attributed to the substitution of a carbon–chlorine bond with a nitrogen atom. Most importantly, this unprecedentedly high PCE of over 15% achieved by Tz6T not only brings oligothiophene back to the forefront of small molecule donors, but also makes this cost-effective donor family very promising for the real production of commercialized OPVs in future.
