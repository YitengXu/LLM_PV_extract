    , Accepted 20th May 2015First published on 25th May 2015AbstractSodium-ion batteries have attracted extensive attention for large-scale energy storage applications for renewable energy and smart grids owing to their abundant sodium resources and potential low cost. Compared with the numerous available cathodes, very few anodes are viable for sodium-ion batteries. Here we report a highly safe and low-cost nanocomposite, disodium 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Na2C6H2O4)/CNT, prepared by a simple spray drying method, as a high performance anode for sodium-ion batteries. The resulting nanocomposite exhibits a reversible capacity of 259 mA h g−1 with a first Coulombic efficiency of 88% and excellent rate performance. The average sodium storage voltage is 1.4 V, which prevents the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer and consequently ensures high safety, high first Coulombic efficiency and superior rate performance.
1. Introduction
The electrochemical energy storage system is one of the most promising means to store electricity on a large scale which is critical for the smooth integration of renewable intermittent energies, such as wind and solar power, into the grid.1,2 Amongst them, lithium-ion batteries with high energy density have been widely used in portable electronic devices and would be the best choice for electric vehicles. However, the amount of lithium resources in the Earth's crust would not be sufficient to satisfy the demands of widespread application of electric vehicles and smart grids simultaneously. Sodium has similar physicochemical properties to lithium and the fundamental principles of lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries are similar, while sodium resources are practically inexhaustible. Thus, room-temperature sodium-ion batteries have been recently proposed for these large-scale applications.3–6
Safety is another critical factor in such practical applications. The lack of anodes with appropriate storage voltage impedes the development of highly safe sodium-ion batteries. Numerous carbon-based materials have been studied as anodes for sodium-ion batteries. Among them, hard carbon exhibits high storage capacity and good cycling performance. However, the sodium storage voltage of carbon-based materials is close to the sodium plating voltage; on the one hand, this will lead to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer owing to the electrolyte reduction below 0.8 V; on the other hand, this may also cause dendrite growth and consequential safety issues under fast charging or overcharging conditions.7,8 Although the storage capacity of several alloys is large, the low first Coulombic efficiency and instable electrode structure caused by large volume change during sodium insertion and extraction make alloys impractical.9,10 Ti-based compounds are another important class of anodes which have attracted considerable interest in recent years. It mainly includes Ti-based oxides and Ti-based phosphates NaTi2(PO4)3. Ti-based oxides,11–14 such as Na2Ti3O7 and Na0.66[Li0.22Ti0.78]O2, have shown relatively low first Coulombic efficiency due to the formation of a SEI layer, which also influences the high rate performance. Polyanionic NaTi2(PO4)3 displays a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 2.1 V via Ti4+/Ti3+ conversion. This operating voltage is too positive for high energy density and this material can only be considered with aqueous electrolytes where hydrogen evolution is to be avoided.15,16
Organic electrode materials, which can be obtained from biomass and recyclable resources, are environmentally friendly and low-cost choices for secondary batteries.17–22 Conjugated carbonyl compounds with a quinone-type redox centre23,24 or carboxyl redox centre25–27 are an important part of organic anode materials with relatively low storage potential. The first reported organic sodium-ion battery anode, disodium terephthalate (Na2C8H4O4), exhibits a high reversible capacity and good cycling performance but a low first Coulombic efficiency of 50% due to its low storage voltage.27–29 It is desired to develop organic anode materials with a storage voltage higher than 0.8 V to avoid the formation of a SEI layer. Dilithium 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Li2C6H2O4) exhibits a lithium storage voltage of 1.6 V.30 Considering the potential difference between lithium and sodium, this redox centre may provide an appropriate sodium storage voltage just above 1 V. Moreover, most organics show low electronic and ionic conductivity, which will significantly limit their capacity and rate performance.31,32 Thus, organic materials must be integrated by efficient charge conduction pathways both in particles and the whole electrode with high surface area. Three-dimensional (3-D) networks of carbon nanotube electrode structure models can offer high surface area, interpenetrating porosity and efficient charge carrier transport. In addition, a porous and hollow structure allows a high contact area of the active material with the electrolyte, leading to fast transport of electrons and sodium ions.
Here, we introduce a Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite prepared by a simple spray drying method for highly safe sodium-ion batteries, which exhibits a reversible capacity of 259 mA h g−1 with excellent rate performance of a storage capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at 7 C (∼8 min discharging/charging) rate and a first Coulombic efficiency of 88% at an average sodium storage voltage of 1.4 V. The relatively high voltage prevents the formation of a SEI layer and dendrites, thereby ensuring the high safety of the battery. Meanwhile, this spray drying method can be further extended to water- or oil-soluble materials to improve the electronic conductivity of the electrode.
2. Experimental
Synthesis
A Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite sample was synthesized in one step as follows: stoichiometric amounts of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,5-DBQ) (TCI, 98%) and NaOH (99%) were dissolved in deionised water, and then 10 wt% hydrophilic carbon nanotubes was added into the solution and dispersed by ultrasonication for 3 h. The homogeneous liquid was spray-dried at the inlet and outlet temperatures of 150 °C and 80 °C, respectively. The obtained spherical powders were heated at 300 °C for 4 h in an Ar atmosphere. The Na2C6H2O4 sample was prepared by a room-temperature liquid-phase reaction between stoichiometric 2,5-DBQ and NaOH. NaOH was dissolved in ethanol and then the solution was slowly injected into a DMSO solution in which 2,5-DBQ was dissolved. An orange precipitate formed and was separated out by centrifugation. The as-obtained powders were washed with ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) in the scan range of 10–60°. The morphology of the sample was observed by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4800). EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature with a JEOL JES-FA200 spectrometer. Microwave power and modulation amplitude were, respectively, set to 1 mW and 0.35 mT.
Electrochemistry
A Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite electrode was fabricated by compressing a mixture of Na2C6H2O4/CNT (53 wt%), acetylene black (42 wt%), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder (5 wt%). The control Na2C6H2O4 electrodes were prepared by mixing Na2C6H2O4 (70 wt%), acetylene black (20 wt%), and polytetrafluoroethylene (10 wt%) homogeneously. The working electrodes were dried at 100 °C under vacuum for 10 h. The CR2032 coin-type cells were assembled with pure sodium foil as the counter electrode, and glass fibre as the separator in an argon-filled glove box. The electrolyte was 0.8 M NaPF6 in PC. The discharge and charge measurements were carried out on a Land BT2000 battery test system (Wuhan, China) in a voltage range of 1.0–2.0 V at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
A Na2C6H2O4/CNT composite material was synthesized by means of spray drying with 10 wt% CNTs. Spray drying is widely used for spherical shape granulating in industry and the process is presented in Fig. 1a. The raw material is Na2C6H2O4 aqueous solution containing homodispersed hydrophilic carbon nanotubes. During spray drying, the solute Na2C6H2O4 separates out upon water evaporation, and then forms nanocomposite microparticles together with carbon nanotubes. The formed microparticle is interspersed with carbon nanotubes, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. This approach takes advantage of uniform dispersion of hydrophilic carbon nanotubes in the composite with soluble materials with low electronic conductivity, a building conducting network and granulating spheres simultaneously. Either water- or oil-soluble materials are applicable to this approach with carbon nanotubes possessing hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity after different surface modifications. For comparison, we also prepared Na2C6H2O4 by a simple liquid phase reaction using precursors of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,5-DBQ) and NaOH in an organic solvent at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns collected for Na2C6H2O4 and Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite samples are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The Na2C6H2O4 sample prepared from the liquid phase reaction crystallizes in a space group of P. However, after spray drying, the pattern of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite shows wide full widths at half-maximum, indicating that the crystallinity decreases in this process. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite displays a (100)-preferential orientation. The morphology of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 3, the nanocomposite particles are composed of nanoparticles around 50 nm and in whole exhibit an irregular spherical shape with a particle size of 1–5 μm. It can be seen that in this porous sphere structure, carbon nanotubes interlace inside the particle and protrude outwards from the sphere surface to build a conductive network in and between microparticles, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The pore size distribution was obtained from the N2 sorption isotherm through the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) approach. The Na2C6H2O4/CNT sample shows typically a porous structure with a large number of pores in the range of 40–50 nm. For the Na2C6H2O4 sample synthesized in the organic solvent, the SEM image shows the particle size in the range of 50–100 nm.

The sodium storage performance of the Na2C6H2O4 electrode and Na2C6H2O4/CNT electrode in sodium half-cells is shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. For the Na2C6H2O4 electrode, there is one flat plateau at 1.2 V in the first discharge process, showing that a two-phase reaction happened with sodium insertion into this structure, while the following charge process presents two voltage plateaus at 1.3 V and 1.6 V. The first discharge capacity is 288 mA h g−1 at a current rate of C/10 (C/10 means 2 mol Na insertion into 1 mol Na2C6H2O4 in 10 h), corresponding to two sodium insertion per formula unit. Combining with a charge capacity of 265 mA h g−1, the asymmetric reaction in the first cycle exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 92%, which is much higher than any other reported organic carbonyl anodes for sodium-ion batteries. It can be attributed to the high storage voltage avoiding SEI formation and sodium consumption. However, the capacity of the Na2C6H2O4 electrode fades rapidly. The capacity decreases to 140 mA h g−1 in the 5th cycle, and further decreases to 40 mA h g−1 in the 10th cycle, which might be ascribed to the low electrical conductivity of this organic material.

(c) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd cyclic voltammetry curves of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT composite electrode at a scan rate of 0.03 mV s−1. 
The first discharge/charge curves of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT electrode show a reversible capacity of 259 mA h g−1 with a first Coulombic efficiency of 88%, which are close to that of the Na2C6H2O4 electrode and superior to most of other anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Attributed to the electronic network building by the carbon nanotubes inside the microparticle and protruding out of its surface, the cycle performance of this nanocomposite is significantly improved. After 10 cycles, the capacity remains at 250 mA h g−1. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT sample are displayed in Fig. 4c in the voltage range of 0.8–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na at a scanning rate of 0.03 mV s−1. One cathodic peak was observed at about 1.15 V in the first negative sweep, corresponding to the reduction of two quinone groups to sodium phenoxide.30 In the subsequent positive sweep, there are two anodic peaks centred at 1.35 V and 1.65 V, suggesting that the oxidation of sodium phenoxide is a two-step process. From the second cycle, two pairs of redox peaks are present in both negative and positive sweeps, which are in good agreement with the discharge/charge curves. These observations indicate that the mechanism of the first discharge process is different from the following. Thereafter, the electrode reaction shows high reversibility, thus ensuring good cycle performance.
To investigate the reaction mechanism, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) method was used for Na2C6H2O4 samples at different discharge/charge states at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 5, the pristine Na2C6H2O4 material shows no signal as expected due to the even number of electrons. Surprisingly, after being discharged to 1 V (corresponding to 2 Na insertion), the discharged Na4C6H2O4 phase shows the onset of a strong isotropic EPR signal (g = 1.9675), indicating that the Na4C6H2O4 phase is in a triplet ground state.25,33 Once charged to 1.4 V (corresponding to 1 Na extraction), the EPR spectrum of the charged Na3C6H2O4 phase has a different g value of 1.9685, suggesting the presence of free radicals in the Na3C6H2O4 phase. Upon further charging to 2.0 V, the spectrum is similar to that of the pristine Na2C6H2O4 molecule, showing the high reversibility of the electrode reaction.
 Fig. 5  X-band EPR spectra recorded on Na2C6H2O4 electrodes at different discharge/charge states at room temperature. 
The rate capability of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT electrode was also evaluated in a sodium cell. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that the reversible capacities are 258, 239, 234, 212, 197, 161 and 142 mA h g−1 at current rates of C/10, C/5, C/2, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C and 7 C, respectively. The capacity retention at 7 C rate (∼8 min discharging/charging) is 55% of the initial capacity. As it is well known, the SEI layer formed on the electrode surface results in a large impedance increase. Na2C6H2O4 with high storage voltage has no SEI layer on the surface and hence exhibits superior rate performance. Furthermore, the unique porous structure of favorable transport characteristics builds up a mixed conducting 3-D network for both the Na+ ion and electron. The well-connected carbon nanotubes provide a continuous electronic pathway and simultaneously the porous structure makes the liquid electrolyte facile for diffusion into the bulk of the electrode material. Moreover, the primary nanoparticles greatly reduce the solid-state transport lengths for Na+ ion diffusion which is assumed to determine the overall rate in this nanocomposite. Fig. 6b shows the capacity and Coulombic efficiency of the Na2C6H2O4/CNT electrode versus cycle number. After 30 cycles, the reversible capacity is still kept at 191 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 1 C. The capacity retention is 92%. Meanwhile, after the initial cycle, the Coulombic efficiency can reach over 99%. It may be due to the porous structure which buffers well against the local volume change during the Na insertion/extraction and thus enhances the structural stability.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Na2C6H2O4/CNT nanocomposite obtained by a spray drying method shows a reversible capacity of 259 mA h g−1 with a high first Coulombic efficiency of 88% and superior rate performance of a storage capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at 7 C rate (∼8 min discharging/charging). This nanocomposite exhibits an average sodium storage voltage of 1.4 V free of SEI layer formation and dendrite deposition, ensuring the high safety of the battery. All these properties make this nanocomposite a promising anode material for room-temperature sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems. In addition, this widely applicable spray drying method opens a new avenue for the improvement of electrode materials with low electronic conductivity.
