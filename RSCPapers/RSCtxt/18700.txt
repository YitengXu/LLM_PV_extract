    , Accepted 24th April 2020First published on 25th April 2020AbstractSustainable production of high-value carbon-based fuels and chemicals through electrochemical CO reduction (COR) under mild conditions is a promising alternative to the traditional Fischer–Tropsch process that requires high energy input and large-scale reactors. However, the COR process suffers from the low activity and poor selectivity of the currently employed electrocatalysts, greatly hampering its large-scale application. Herein, by means of comprehensive swarm-intelligence structure search and first-principles computations, we identify an ideal electrocatalyst for COR, i.e., a metallic Cu2B2 monolayer with planar heptacoordinate copper and planar pentacoordinate boron. Our results reveal that the predicted Cu2B2 monolayer exhibits superior thermal and dynamic stability and holds promise for experimental realization. More importantly, this catalyst could effectively reduce CO to ethanol through the “carbene” mechanism with a low limiting potential (−0.59 V) and a small barrier for C–C coupling (0.41 eV). Our work is the first report on the as-designed electrocatalyst with planar hypercoordinate motifs for CO reduction to C2 products, which not only widens the potential application of hypercoordinate 2D materials, but also opens up a new and promising avenue for converting abundant industrial CO to value-added ethanol.
1. Introduction
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to high-value chemicals offers a promising avenue to a carbon-neutral energy cycle and long-term storage of renewable electricity.1–5 Among various generated products during CO2 electroreduction, C2+ (containing two or more carbon atoms) hydrocarbons and oxygenates with high energy density are preferred electrolytic products due to their high demand as an important raw material for organic chemicals,6 among which ethanol is of particular interest due to its high heating value (−1366.8 kJ mol−1) as a clean and renewable liquid fuel.7–10 However, direct CO2 reduction to ethanol still remains a great challenge due to the poor selectivity and low efficiency of the used electrocatalysts at practical reaction rates (>300 mA cm−2).11–13
As an alternative to direct CO2 reduction, a two-step process is highly attractive, in which CO2 is initially reduced to CO and then sequentially reduced to multi-carbon (C2+) products,14,15 due to its several advantages as follows: (1) the catalytic performance for achieving C2+ products could be greatly enhanced by directly utilizing CO as the reactant to increase the near-surface CO concentration;16,17 (2) CO reduction (COR) can proceed in alkaline electrolytes that can effectively suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and thus enhances selectivity towards C2+ products;18,19 (3) starting with CO instead of CO2 as a feedstock can help overcome issues in feedstock utilization and stability due to the formation of carbonates in CO2 electrolysers.20 Therefore, COR has been receiving renewed attention in recent years due to its significant promise for production of C2+ products.21 In particular, the electroreduction of CO to value-added chemicals powered by electricity generated from solar or wind sources under ambient conditions is a quite promising alternative technology as the conventional Fischer–Tropsch synthesis requires harsh reaction conditions, large infrastructure, high hydrogen consumption, and complex processes of product separation.22–24
Currently, Cu is being studied extensively as the only CO reduction catalyst to yield C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates with appreciable selectivity, and thus great research effort has been devoted to further enhancing the performance of Cu-based catalysts for COR and to deeply understanding the underlying mechanisms, especially the product distribution and structure–activity relationship.15,18,21,25–34 For example, Li et al. reported that a supported bulk polycrystalline copper powder electrode can effectively reduce CO to multi-carbon oxygenates with high activity and high selectivity.27 Deng and co-workers achieved a high faradaic efficiency of up to 52.7% for COR to ethylene over Cu catalysts.28 Furthermore, Bertheussen et al. showed that oxide-derived Cu catalysts can reduce CO to ethanol at high rates in an alkaline electrolyte.29 In addition, Wang et al. demonstrated that Cu nanoflower electrodes are capable of achieving almost full selectivity towards liquid multicarbon oxygenates.32 Although notable progress has been achieved in preparing Cu materials that expose the desired facets for COR, there still remains a major challenge in enhancing the catalytic performance and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism. Therefore, searching for novel electrocatalysts with high efficiency and high selectivity for CO reduction to C2+ products is urgently needed.
Recently, due to their unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively utilized as catalysts for some important electrocatalytic reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction, water splitting, CO2 activation, and ammonia synthesis.35–45 Among various 2D materials, boron-containing nanosheets, such as boron nanosheets,46,47 boron doped graphene,48,49 or single boron sites supported by 2D materials,50,51 have attracted extraordinary interest due to their superior catalytic activity for electrochemically converting earth-abundant simple molecules into value-added chemicals under ambient conditions.52 For example, the embedded boron atom can serve as an active site for electrocatalytic reduction of O2,48 CO2,49 or N2 (ref. 50, 51 and 53) because its empty sp2-orbital could provide strong binding with these reactants, leading to the effective activation of O2, CO2, or N2 and the subsequent reduction steps.
Inspired by the unique properties of 2D B-containing materials, an interesting question arises: can we search for a novel B-based monolayer with good stability and high efficiency for use as a COR electrocatalyst? In this work, by means of comprehensive first-principles swarm structural search, we predict a novel flat 2D hexacoordinate Cu2B2 monolayer as the electrocatalyst for COR. Notably, the following advantages make us choose metal borides as the electrocatalyst for COR: (1) the diversity in structures and compositions results in the generation of a large number of compounds with interesting properties and applications;54 (2) metal borides generally display high stability in both acidic and alkaline media;55 (3) metal borides with different configurations can be achieved by simple and general synthetic methods, which allows flexibility in the choice of the transition metal and metal-to-boron ratios.56
Our results reveal that the designed Cu2B2 monolayer not only exhibits excellent stability, but also has an inherent metallic feature. In particular, the Cu2B2 monolayer can effectively catalyze the electroreduction of CO to C2H5OH through a “carbene” mechanism with a very small limiting potential of −0.59 V and an ultralow energy barrier of 0.41 eV for C–C coupling. Thus, we predict that the as-designed Cu2B2 monolayer can be utilized as a quite promising catalyst with high efficiency for the conversion of CO to C2 products.
2. Computational details
The search for the lowest-energy structure was performed with the particle-swarm optimization (PSO) method as implemented in the CALYPSO code,57 which can efficiently and rapidly obtain reliable structures via the input of chemical composition and has successfully predicted many 2D nanosheets with novel properties, such as Cu2Si,58 TiC3,59 FeB6,60 Be5C2,61 and some MB2 monolayers.62 Then, spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) computations within the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)63,64 were performed for structural relaxations, single-point energies, and electronic structures. The projector-augmented-wave (PAW)65,66 pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons, and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional67 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was adopted to describe electron interactions. The energy cutoff of the plane wave was set to 600 eV and the atomic position was fully relaxed until the maximum force on each atom was lower than 10−4 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 5 × 5 × 1Γ centered k point grid for geometry optimization. The empirical correction in Grimme's method (DFT+D3)68 was used to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was utilized to locate the involved transition states.69,70 The obtained Cu2B2 monolayer was placed in the x–y plane and the z direction was perpendicular to the plane, in which a vacuum space of 20 Å in the z direction was used to avoid interactions between adjacent layers, and a 3 × 3 supercell was employed to explore the catalytic activity of the Cu2B2 monolayer. To evaluate the dynamic stability, phonon dispersion spectra were computed by using the Phonopy code71 interfaced with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT).72
Since the standard GGA generally tends to underestimate the band gap, the hybrid functional based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) method73,74 was used to achieve the exact band structure. To estimate the COR catalytic activity of the predicted Cu2B2 monolayer, the computational electrode model (CHE) method75,76 was utilized to compute the free energy change (ΔG) of each elementary step and find the lowest energy pathways. According to this model, the changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for all electrochemical steps were defined as ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGpH, where the reaction energy (ΔE) can be directly obtained by analyzing the DFT total energies. The zero point energy difference (ΔEZPE) between the products and the reactants can be computed from the vibrational frequencies. ΔS is the change in entropy between the products and the reactants at room temperature (T = 298.15 K). The entropies of the free molecules, such as CO, CH4, CH3CH2OH, and H2, were taken from the NIST database. ΔGpH is the free energy contribution due to the variations in the H concentration, which can be determined as ΔGpH = 2.303kBT × pH, and in this work the value of pH was set to 0 to simulate a strong acidic environment. Here, we considered a Heyrovsky-type reaction mechanism, where solvated protons from the solution can directly react with an electron and reaction intermediates on the surface to construct free energy diagrams. According to the obtained free energy change of each elementary step, the limiting potential (UL) was further computed as follows: UL = −max (ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4, …, ΔGi)/e as it is a widely accepted activity descriptor to estimate the experimental activity of various COR electrocatalysts. In addition, according to the theoretical study by Peterson et al.,76 we included the solvation corrections at the water–solid interface implicitly by defining that carbonyls adsorbates, such as *CO and *CHO, were stabilized by 0.10 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure
After comprehensive structure search with PSO in the CALYPSO code, the Cu2B2 monolayer with D2h symmetry (Fig. 1a) is revealed to have the lowest energy, suggesting a global minimum in the 2D space. A unit cell of the Cu2B2 monolayer consists of two Cu atoms and two B atoms with optimized lattice parameters of a = b = 3.95 Å. In particular, the Cu2B2 monolayer is an exactly planar structure. Within this global minimum structure, each Cu atom is located at the central site of a seven-membered ring, which coordinates with four B atoms and three other Cu atoms, while the B atom connects with four Cu and one B atoms, thus leading to the formation of planar heptacoordination copper and planar pentacoordinate boron with shortest lengths of Cu–B and Cu–Cu bonds of 2.03 and 2.47 Å, respectively, and the B–B bond length (1.64 Å) is comparable to that in borophene (1.67–1.71 Å).77

3.2. Stability
Good stability is a prerequisite for further application of a newly designed material. To evaluate the stability of the Cu2B2 monolayer, its cohesive energy (Ecoh) was computed, which is a widely accepted descriptor to assess the possibility of the experimental realization for the predicted 2D material.58–61 Notably, the Ecoh value of the Cu2B2 monolayer is determined by the following formula: Ecoh = (2ECu + 2 EB − ECu2B2)/4, where ECu, EB, and ECu2B2 are the total energies of a single Cu atom, a single B atom, and Cu2B2 monolayer, respectively. Our computations show that the computed cohesive energy of the Cu2B2 monolayer is as high as 4.59 eV per atom. Furthermore, we explored the dynamic stability of the Cu2B2 monolayer by computing its phonon dispersion spectrum. There is not any appreciable negative frequency in the phonon spectrum of the Cu2B2 monolayer (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), implying its good kinetic stability. In particular, the highest frequency of 1034 cm−1 (31 THz) is even higher than those of 473 cm−1 in the MoS2 monolayer,78 580 cm−1 in silicene,79 854 cm−1 in the FeB2 monolayer,80 and 1020 cm−1 in the Be2C monolayer,81 indicating the robust connection between the Cu and B atoms in the Cu2B2 monolayer.
In addition, the stability of the as-designed Cu2B2 monolayer should be evaluated under realistic electrochemical conditions, such as strong acidic media (low pH value) and working potentials of cathodes (in terms of negative overpotentials). According to previous theoretical studies,82,83 we computed the dissolution potential (Udis, in V) of Cu in the Cu2B2 monolayer at pH = 0, which will be compared with the negative overpotential (−η) of COR on the Cu2B2 monolayer (further computational details are shown in the ESI†). Our results showed that the computed Udis value of Cu is about 1.76 V, which is much larger than the negative overpotential of COR on the Cu2B2 monolayer (−0.82 V), suggesting that Cu within the Cu2B2 framework can survive under the realistic experimental conditions of COR.
The next important question arises; why does the Cu2B2 monolayer exhibit such high stability? To address this issue, we analyzed the electron distribution in the Cu2B2 monolayer by computing its electron localization function (ELF),84 which is a useful tool for the classification of chemical bonds and description of electron localization in molecules and solids.85 In general, the ELF values of 1.0 and 0.5 correspond to well localized electrons and a perfect free electron gas distribution, respectively. According to the obtained isosurface of the ELF with a value of 0.50 (Fig. 2a), we can see that the electrons are well delocalized in the whole Cu2B2 monolayer, suggesting a strong interaction between the Cu and B atoms in the Cu2B2 framework. Meanwhile, there is a certain amount of charge transfer from the Cu atoms to the B atoms in the Cu2B2 monolayer, as revealed by the accumulated electron gas around the B atoms, which is well consistent with the result that the valence (oxidation) state of each Cu atom within the Cu2B2 monolayer is +0.18 according to Bader charge analysis.86 Moreover, the ELF map in the (001) direction through the Cu2B2 monolayer shows that the red color corresponding to the ELF value of 1.0 is mainly located around the B–B bonds to form robust ionic bonds (Fig. 2b). The existence of ionic bonds further testifies the obvious electron transfer and robust connection between Cu and B atoms, thus resulting in high stability of the Cu2B2 monolayer.

3.3. Electronic properties
Good electrical conductivity is crucial to promote rapid charge transfer for efficient electrochemical reactions. Thus, by using the accurate hybrid HSE06 functional, we computed the exact band structure of the Cu2B2 monolayer to explore its electrical conductivity. Interestingly, our results show that several bands cross the Fermi level in the band structure of the Cu2B2 monolayer (Fig. 3), suggesting the metallic feature and thus demonstrating its excellent electronic conductivity, which will promote electrocatalytic reactions. The metallicity mainly originates from the co-contribution of Cu-3d and B-2p states (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the apparent hybridization between Cu-3d and B-2p states further testifies the strong interaction between each other, which is well consistent with the ELF analysis of the Cu2B2 monolayer.

3.4. CO activation and reduction
After confirming the unique geometric structure, outstanding stability, and inherent metallicity of the Cu2B2 monolayer, we then moved to explore its catalytic activity towards electrochemical CO reduction by determining the lowest energy pathway and computing the corresponding limiting potential (UL), which is a key descriptor of catalytic activity on given catalysts, and a less negative UL value suggests a better COR catalytic performance.
The adsorption and activation of the CO molecule on the catalyst is the first step during electrochemical COR, which is a key step to initiate the subsequent reduction steps. After full structural relaxation, our results show that the CO molecule is preferably adsorbed on the B site by forming a B–C bond with a bond length of 1.49 Å (Fig. 4a). Remarkably, the interaction between CO and the Cu2B2 monolayer is very strong with an adsorption energy of −1.47 eV, which elongates the C–O bond length from 1.14 Å in free CO to 1.16 Å on the Cu2B2 monolayer. The projected density of states (PDOS, Fig. 4b) show that the strong adsorption mainly originates from the strong hybridization between B-2p and CO-2p in the whole region. More interestingly, there is significant charge transfer between the Cu2B2 monolayer and CO according to the charge density difference of the Cu2B2 monolayer with the adsorption of CO (Fig. 4c), in which the B atom of the Cu2B2 monolayer captures the lone-pair electron from the 5σ orbital of CO and simultaneously donates its electrons to the empty 2π* orbital of CO, forming the so-called “σ–π” accepting–donating interaction. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for N2 activation on B-decorated g-C3N4.87 Overall, the high binding strength, strong hybridization in the PDOS, and obvious charge transfer reveal that the adsorbed CO molecule can be sufficiently activated on the Cu2B2 monolayer, which would facilitate its subsequent reduction reactions.

After confirming the sufficient activation of the CO molecule with a ΔG value of −0.77 eV, we explored its further reduction on the surface of the Cu2B2 monolayer. The obtained lowest energy pathway for CO reduction on the Cu2B2 monolayer and the corresponding reaction intermediates are presented in Fig. 5, and the detailed free energy changes of each elementary step along various pathways are summarized in Table S1.†

As shown in Fig. 5, the activated CO molecule will be preferably hydrogenated to *COH species adsorbed on the B–B bridge site, in which the hydrogen is bound to the upper O site, and the C–O length is elongated to 1.33 Å. Remarkably, the formation of *COH species is uphill by 0.59 eV in the free energy profile, which is lower than that of *CHO species (ΔG = 0.71 eV, Table S1†). Once the *COH species is formed, it can be further hydrogenated through one proton–electron pair transfer to its C atom to generate *CHOH species with a ΔG value of −0.01 eV, which is followed by the hydrogenation of *CHOH to give *CH2OH, and this reaction is slightly downhill (0.22 eV). The approach of a fourth hydrogen induces the dissociation of *CH2OH into *CH2 and H2O with a free energy change of −0.77 eV. According to previous theoretical studies,88–91 the pre-formed *CH2 species was revealed to be a key intermediate for combining with the CO molecule to induce the effective C–C coupling and thus generate C2 products, i.e., the “carbene” mechanism.92,93 Interestingly, in the Cu2B2 monolayer, the abundant B atoms could serve as active sites, promoting the coupling between the formed CH2 and CO to generate C2 products.
As expected, the *CH2 species can couple with the CO molecule to form *CH2CO, in which *CH2 and CO bind with two neighboring B atoms. Remarkably, in this intermediate, the distance between *CH2 and CO is 1.58 Å, which is comparable to 1.53 Å of ethane, suggesting the formation of a C–C bond by the coupling of *CH2 and CO. More importantly, in comparison to separated  and CO, this coupling process for the *CH2CO formation results in an obvious energy gain of 0.89 eV (ΔG = −0.20 eV), indicating that *CH2 species can spontaneously couple with the impending CO molecule to generate *CH2CO. In addition, the kinetic barrier is required to further determine the possibility of the C–C bond formation since it is not a simple proton-transfer step, and its reaction barrier is not diminished with higher applied voltages.77 Interestingly, we found that this coupling of *CH2 + CO (g) → CH2CO* overcomes an ultralow energy barrier of 0.41 eV, which is much lower than that on C-doped boron nitride nanoribbons (1.30 eV),90 implying the kinetic feasibility for the C–C bond formation through the “carbene” mechanism.
Following the C–C coupling between *CH2 and CO via the “carbene” mechanism, the formed *CH2CO will be further hydrogenated to *CH3CO, *CH2CHO, or *CH2COH species with ΔG values of −0.39, −0.59, or +0.04 eV, respectively, implying that the generation of *CH2CHO is more energetically preferable than that of the other two intermediates. Subsequently, we found that *CH2CHO prefers to be hydrogenated to *CH2CH2O with an exothermicity of 0.68 eV, while the formation of *CH3CHO or *CH2CHOH from *CH2CHO is endothermic by 0.18 or 2.29 eV. The next hydrogenation step at the C or O atom of *CH2CH2O will give *CH3CH2O, *CH2CH3O, or *CH2CH2OH, respectively. Remarkably, the three possible reactions are uphill in the free energy profile by 0.07, 0.54, and 1.06 eV, respectively, indicating the higher feasibility to yield *CH3CH2O. Finally, the adsorbed *CH3CH2O reacts with one proton upon one-electron reduction to generate the CH3CH2OH product, which is uphill by 0.53 eV in the free energy profile. During the overall CO reduction to CH3CH2OH, the potential-determining step is the formation of *COH species with the maximum ΔG value of 0.59 eV as discussed above. Remarkably, the corresponding limiting potential is computed to be −0.59 V, which is less negative than that of the direct dimerization of adsorbed CO* on the well-established Cu(100) surface (−0.73 V).94,95 Therefore, the predicted Cu2B2 monolayer is a rather promising candidate to efficiently boost the conversion of CO to ethanol.
In addition to the aforementioned “carbene” mechanism, CO dimerization is also a well-accepted pathway to generate C2 products on the Cu surface, in which two activated CO molecules were directly dimerized to a OCCO* species, followed by its further hydrogenation to a C2 product.94–98 Thus, we made a comparison of the C–C bond coupling through the “carbene” mechanism and the CO direct dimerization on the Cu2B2 monolayer. As shown in Fig. S2,† the free energy change for C–C coupling through the CO dimerization is as high as 1.33 eV, which is much larger than that through the aforementioned “carbene” mechanism with the maximum ΔG value of 0.59 eV, thus suggesting a low possibility of forming the C–C bond via the CO direct dimerization on the Cu2B2 monolayer.
The competing electrocatalytic reaction, i.e., the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is also our concern because such a reaction might significantly affect the faradaic efficiency of the desired products. We thus explored the adsorption energy of H* species on the Cu2B2 monolayer, which is a key descriptor for estimating the HER catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate that the H* species will be adsorbed on the B site with an adsorption energy of −0.46 eV, which is about three times less than that of the CO molecule on the Cu2B2 monolayer (−1.36 eV). Thus, the B active sites will be preferentially occupied by the CO molecule during COR, suggesting that the HER activity is less likely to compete with the ethanol product on the Cu2B2 monolayer. In addition to C2 products, we also explored the COR to C1 products. As shown in Fig. S3,† our results show that CH4 is also a possible product of COR on the Cu2B2 monolayer with a limiting potential of −0.59 V, which is the same as that of the CH3CH2OH product. However, the energy barrier of the coupling of *CH2 with CO (0.41 eV) along the C2 pathway is much lower than that of the hydrogenation of *CH2 to *CH3 along the C1 pathway (1.26 eV, Fig. S4†), indicating a high selectivity toward C2H5OH.
3.5. CO reduction on other M2B2 monolayers
Motivated by the excellent catalytic activity of the Cu2B2 monolayer, we explored other potential M2B2 materials with the same D2h symmetry by substituting the Cu atom in the Cu2B2 monolayer with Fe, Co, and Ni due to their similar radius to Cu. Our results show that only the Ni2B2 monolayer can maintain a similar planar hypercoordinate structure, while Fe2B2 and Co2B2 monolayers with D2h symmetry are unstable due to their obvious negative frequency in their phonon spectra (Fig. S5†). We further estimated the COR catalytic activity of the stable Ni2B2 monolayer by computing the free energy change for the first hydrogenation step (CO* + H+ + e− → COH*), which is the potential-determining step of COR on the Cu2B2 monolayer. The results demonstrate that the ΔG value for COH* formation on the Ni2B2 monolayer is 0.70 eV, which is slightly larger than that on the Cu2B2 monolayer of 0.59 eV, further highlighting the superior catalytic performance of the Cu2B2 monolayer for COR.
Furthermore, we explored the origin of the high catalytic activity of the Cu2B2 monolayer towards COR by computing the electron filling of B p-levels, which plays an important role in the activation of CO. According to the aforementioned analysis of ELF, a certain amount of electrons around the B sites is located at the x–y plane to bind with neighboring Cu atoms, while the pz orbitals of the B atom are less filled and will accept the lone pair electrons of CO. Thus, the less the pz orbital filling, the stronger the COH* adsorption. As shown in Fig. S6,† the B-pz orbitals in the Cu2B2 monolayer are less filled as compared with those of the Ni2B2 molecule, which is well consistent with their adsorption strength with COH* (−4.10 eV for Cu2B2vs. −3.45 eV for Ni2B2).
4. Conclusions
In summary, we for the first time designed a novel 2D Cu2B2 monolayer with a planar hypercoordinate structure for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO to C2 products based on first-principles swarm structure computations. The “acceptance–donation” process between CO and B sites of the Cu2B2 monolayer leads to the sufficient activation of the CO molecule, promoting the subsequent CO reduction to C2H5OH with a rather low limiting potential of −0.59 V through the “carbene” mechanism. Moreover, the as-designed Cu2B2 monolayer exhibits a metallic feature, which makes it an ideal candidate for rapid charge transfer for efficient COR. In addition, the Cu2B2 monolayer presents a large cohesive energy and high thermal stability, suggesting significant advantages for experimental realization. In view of the high stability and great promise for preparation, good electrical conductivity, superior catalytic performance, and obvious suppressing effects on the competing reaction, we thus predicted that the Cu2B2 monolayer is a quite promising electrocatalyst for CO reduction to C2 products, which will inevitably inspire more theoretical and experimental studies to rationally design and fabricate other novel 2D materials with high efficiency for various electrochemical reactions.
