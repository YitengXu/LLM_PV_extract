    , Accepted 10th May 2023First published on 13th May 2023AbstractThe above 25% certified efficiency had been achieved for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with regular n–i–p device architecture based on two-step processes in recent years. However, the perovskite films prepared by two-step processes still have an incomplete PbI2 reaction, poor crystallization quality and residual stress. Herein, an excellent strategy, i.e. introducing 2D MoSe2 nanosheets as additives into PbI2 precursor solution in the first step of two-step processes, is proposed to increase the conversion of PbI2 and improve crystallinity as well as reduce residual stress simultaneously. It is revealed that MoSe2 nanosheets prompt the formation of a porous PbI2 film and then achieve a high quality perovskite film. Interestingly, MoSe2 nanosheets play the role of a “lubricant” to relax residual stress. In addition, MoSe2 nanosheets also result in a more suitable energy-level alignment at the perovskite/electron transport layer interface. Consequently, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.76% and the highest PCE of 22.80% are achieved upon incorporating 2D MoSe2 nanosheets, which are greatly improved compared to the average PCE of 19.40% and the highest PCE of 20.92% for the control PSCs. Besides, the MoSe2-doped PSC could maintain 80% of its initial efficiency under 15–20% RH at room temperature for 1000 hours in air. This work not only provides a facile and efficient method to increase the PCE and stability of PSCs but also reveals the application potential of 2D MoSe2 in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties and low-cost solution processibility.1–3 Evolution of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from 3.8% to 25.7% has been witnessed within the past 13 years.4 Currently, the high PCE is mostly achieved by devices with a regular structure (n–i–p) compared to those with an inverted (p–i–n) structure, making them favorable candidates for next-generation solar cells.5,6 The perovskite (PVK) layer can be fabricated by one-step or two-step processes, which had been commonly used in the PSC field.7,8 Compared with random nucleation/growth in one-step processes, sequential two-step deposition methods have some obvious advantages,9,10 such as a controllable and repeatable process, easily forming vertical columnar grains, allowing for the preparation of thicker PVK absorbers and being more suitable for scale-up manufacturing. However, the PVK films prepared by a two-step process still have some challenges, like incomplete transformation from lead iodide to PVK,11 poor crystallization quality of the PVK film12 and residual stress during final annealing.13 These adverse factors often lead to relatively low efficiency and poor stability of PSCs.
Conventionally, PbI2 dissolved in dimethyl formamide (DMF) solution tends to form a layered and dense film on a flat substrate,14,15 which is unfavorable for the reaction of PbI2 with FAI/MAI and thus result in residual PbI2.16 The residual PbI2 easily produce Pb0 defects, which act as non-radiative recombination centers often leading to energy disorder and then pull down the quasi-Fermi level splitting, hindering charge extraction and thus ultimately cause open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) deficit of PSCs.17–22 Besides, the morphology of the final PVK film strongly depends on the morphology and crystallization of initially formed PbI2 film during the first step of the two-step processes.23 The PVK films prepared on a dense PbI2 film often have poor crystallization quality and small grain size and thus plenty of defects.24 In addition, residual tensile stresses, originating from the differences in the volume contraction of the PVK film and the underlying substrate after annealing processes due to the mismatch of the thermal expansion (CTE) coefficient between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL) substrate,25–27 would weaken Pb–I bonds in the [PbI6]4− framework and then decrease the activation energy for ion migration, hinder charge transport and extraction, and reduce performance and stability of devices.28–30 Currently, additive engineering is widely adopted to overcome the above problems. It has been reported that polymers,31,32 small molecules33 and nano-carbon materials34,35 were employed commonly as additives. However, these additives have some intrinsic shortcomings such as non-uniform dimensions,36 self-aggregation, and high diffusion coefficients and volatility of small molecules,37 limiting their application in PSCs. Most importantly, the existing additive rarely plays multiple roles for simultaneously solving the problem of the PbI2 residue along with modulating perovskite crystallization and residual stress so far.
Recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been studied widely for a variety of applications due to its unique layered structure, high conductivity and tunable band gap.38,39 For instance, Zhao, XJ et al. introduced 2D WS2 nanosheets in PSCs, in which WS2 nanosheets play the role of a van der Waals epitaxy growth template by insetting into the SnO2–TiOxCl4−2x/CsPbBr3 interface to achieve a high quality CsPbBr3 perovskite film and release the interfacial strain due to the matched lattices of CsPbBr3 with 2D WS2.40 Zhao, Y et al. utilized few-layer SnS2 as the ETL for high-efficiency PSCs via the self-assembly stacking deposition method. Owing to the good electron extraction and intrinsic conductivity of the SnS2 layer, the balanced charge transport is obtained, as a result, the planar PSCs exhibited over 20% PCE.41 Huang et al. employed water-soluble 2D MoS2 and WS2, fabricated by exfoliating the corresponding bulk materials by the lithium intercalation reaction, as the hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs to achieve the improved PCEs. And the PSCs based on 2D MoS2 and WS2 show higher stability compared to those based on PEDOT:PSS.42 Obviously, 2D TMDs as the HTL, ETL or interface modification layer is promising for enhancing the efficiencies of PSCs. However, 2D TMDs used as additives in perovskite film have not fully explored. In particular, the effect of 2D TMDs as an additive introduced in two-step-processed PSCs needs to be in-depth investigated.43,44
In this work, we proposed a controllable approach to fabricate a porous PbI2 film by introducing 2D MoSe2 nanosheets into PbI2-DMF solution. The porous channels within the PbI2 film induced by the MoSe2 additive promoted the reaction between FAI/MAI and PbI2 to fully convert the underlying PbI2 into PVK, largely eliminating the PbI2 residue and increasing the grain size and crystallinity of PVK. On the other hand, MoSe2 nanosheets located at the bottom of the PVK layer can relax residual stress and also achieved a more matched interface energy-level alignment. As a result, the average PCE of PSCs made with the MoSe2 additive are enhanced to 21.76% from 19.40% of control devices and yield a champion PCE of 22.80%. Also noticeably, the MoSe2-doped PSC can maintain over 80% of its initial efficiency under 15–20% RH at room temperature in air and over 90% of its initial efficiency in a nitrogen-filled glovebox for 1000 hours. This work provides a controllable method of the MoSe2 additive for reasonable design of a micro–nano structure of both PbI2 and PVK films to achieve highly efficient and stable PSCs.
2. Results
2.1. Preparation and characterization of MoSe2 nanosheets
MoSe2 nanosheets were prepared by electrochemical intercalation exfoliation according to the Experimental section. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image reveals that the exfoliated MoSe2 nanosheets have a lateral dimension of 1–2 μm (Fig. 1a). Fig. S1 (ESI†) showed a large-area scanning atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of a representative MoSe2 nanosheet deposited on the Si/SiO2 substrate in the tapping mode, indicating that exfoliated MoSe2 nanosheets have a thickness of 3–4 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and the corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the MoSe2 nanosheet are displayed in Fig. 1b and c. We can clearly observe a lattice distance of 0.237 nm, which corresponds to the (103) lattice plane of MoSe2. And the hexagonal diffraction spots of the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 1d) suggests the high crystallinity of MoSe2 nanosheets. The phase characteristic of exfoliated MoSe2 is verified by the Raman spectra and UV-Vis absorption spectra. Raman spectra of the exfoliated MoSe2 nanosheets in Fig. 1e demonstrate that there has been no phase change during the exfoliation process, since it exhibits similar photon modes as that of bulk MoSe2.45 Moreover, both characteristic peaks corresponding to the vertical mode A1g and in-plane E2g1 are weakened compared with bulk MoSe2, indicating the formation of few layer structure of MoSe2 nanosheets.46 As shown in Fig. 1f, three peaks labeled as A, B and C are located at 803, 702 and 421 nm in the UV-Vis spectra of the MoSe2 nanosheet suspension. The presence of the A and B peaks, attributed to the direct band to band exciton and spin split valence band to the conduction band, respectively, suggest a 2H phase of MoSe2, i.e. semiconductor phase, after the electrochemical intercalation exfoliation process. And the digital photograph presented in the inset of Fig. 1f shows that the MoSe2 nanosheets exhibit excellent dispersibility in the DMF solvent without apparent aggregation. This evidence indicate that the obtained MoSe2 nanosheets not only have a pure 2H phase but also high crystallinity.

2.2. Effect of additive MoSe2 on the PbI2 and PVK films.
For the sequential two-step process, the morphology of PbI2 films and the residue of PbI2 in PVK films play a vital role in determining the performance of PSCs.47,48 Herein, the PbI2 DMF solution mixed with a certain amount of MoSe2 nanosheets were deposited on the SnO2 ETL surface by spin-coating, as shown in Fig. 2a. For the sake of description, PbI2 without MoSe2 and with MoSe2 were referred to as C-PbI2 and M-PbI2, and the PVK without MoSe2 and with MoSe2 as C-PVK and M-PVK, respectively. As evidenced by top-view SEM images (Fig. 2b and c), the morphology of the PbI2 film obviously changes after introducing the MoSe2 additive. It is clear that the C-PbI2 film is naturally compact (Fig. 2b). Proverbially, DMF as the main solvent of the PbI2 precursor solution possess high volatility and hence lead to fast crystallization of PbI2, as a result, a layered and dense PbI2 film is often obtained. By contrast, the M-PbI2 film presents a porous structure (Fig. 2c). Moreover, these pores penetrate the entire PbI2 layer vertically, as confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2d and e). The formation of a porous structure of the M-PVK film should be attributed to the randomly distributed MoSe2 nanosheets within the PbI2 film.49–51 The MoSe2 nanosheets as heterogeneous nucleation sites have an interlayer spacing of 4.74 Å, which mismatched with the interplanar distance of 6.9 Å for the (110) plane of PbI252 and thus disturb the oriented growth of PbI2 and lead to randomly stacked grain and then form the mesoporous PbI2 films.53 AFM images in Fig. 2f, g reveals the formation of a more rough PbI2 film with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.652 nm due to the incorporation of MoSe2 nanosheets compared with the C-PbI2 film with a Rq of 1.206 nm, which should be associated with the porous structure of the M-PbI2 film.

Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) result verifies that the existence of randomly distributed MoSe2 nanosheets results in the crystallinity of the M-PbI2 film becoming lower compared with that of the C-PbI2 film (Fig. S2, ESI†). The porous PbI2 film with low crystallinity can provide favorable diffusion channels for FAI/MAI and matched pre-expanded volume for perovskite grain growth.
The surface morphology evolution of obtained PVK films are shown in Fig. 3a and b and the variations in the average grain size are described in detail by the statistical distribution diagrams presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is clear that the grain size of PVK becomes larger by the addition of MoSe2 nanosheets, displaying an average increase from 322 nm (C-PVK) to 583 nm (M-PVK). Simultaneously, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the cross-sectional SEM image of the M-PVK film also exhibits larger grain distribution with vertically columnar alignment compared with that of C-PVK film, which would lead to fewer carriers losses. It is concluded that the appropriate control of the holes in the PbI2 film can not only promote the diffusion of FAI/MAI but also accommodate the volume expansion and absorbs more strain energy. Furthermore, AFM measurements, as shown in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†), were performed to further reveal the surface morphologies of two types of PKV films. The roughness of the M-PVK film (4.59 nm) is lower than that of the C-PVK film (8.65 nm). And larger grain size can also be seen in the M-PVK film, which is consistent with SEM results. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were subsequently performed to verify the crystallinity of PVK films, as shown in Fig. 3c. There are the same diffraction peaks for the C-PVK and M-PVK films, indicating that the MoSe2 nanosheets are not embedded in the PVK crystal lattice. There is a stronger diffraction peaks at 12.7° arising from PbI2,54 indicating the presence of PbI2 residue in the C-PVK film. It is clear that the M-PVK film has a less pronounced PbI2 peak (at 12.7°), implying the presence of reduced PbI2 residues upon the introduction of MoSe2 nanosheets. The characteristic diffraction peak of the M-PVK film at about 14°, corresponding to the (110) plane of the PVK phase, is significantly enhanced compared with that of the C-PVK film, which indicates the improved crystallinity of the M-PVK film. In order to intuitively show the amount of PbI2 residues in the perovskite film, we statistically determined the diffraction peak ratio of PbI2/(110) of the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). This peak ratio reduce from 0.921 (C-PVK) to 0.438 (M-PVK), indicating that the addition of MoSe2 nanosheets can promote the transformation of PbI2 to PVK.

(f) d-spacing values obtained from the perovskite (110) plane as a function of incidence angle for the C-PVK and M-PVK films. (g) Schematic diagram of residual strain distribution within C-PVK and M-PVK films. 
Ulteriorly, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded, and the corresponding Pb 4f spectra are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Two peaks at the binding energies of 136.4 eV and 141.4 eV corresponding to metallic Pb are observed for the C-PVK film noticeably. The metallic Pb peaks are associated with the presence of organic cations and iodide vacancies in the PVK film, and they are considered to be the main non-radiative centers.55 Exhilaratingly, there is no signal of metal Pb in the M-PVK film, indicating that metallic Pb are significantly suppressed by MoSe2. This may be attributed to the formation of a porous structure due to the addition of MoSe2, which promotes the relatively complete reaction of PbI2 with FAI/MAI.
The interfacial strain distribution was further studied by depth dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement to better understand the crystal structure of PVK near the SnO2/PVK heterostructure interface. As shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S8a (ESI†), the (110) and (202) characteristic peaks of C-PVK film obviously shift to lower angles by varying the incident angles from 0.1° to 1°.
According to the Bragg equation of nλ = 2dsinθ, the shift of the diffraction peak toward a low angle would result in increased inter planar crystal spacing, which means lattice expansion and residual stress present within the C-PVK film. Residual stresses form in PVK films after annealing processes, originating from the differences in the volumetric contraction of the PVK films and the underlying substrate after removal from processing conditions. Key driving forces for the differences in volume contraction are the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) α mismatch between perovskite film and ETL.56 It is reported that the expansion coefficient of the PVK film is 6.1 × 10−5 K, which is larger than that of SnO2 (4.0 × 10−6 K).26 When PVK film cools down after thermal annealing, the contraction of the PVK film is limited by the underlying SnO2 substrate, resulting in depth-dependent crystal lattice deformation within the PVK film. Obviously, the deformation in the top region of the PVK film is lower than that in the bottom interface because of the difference in α values between ETL and PVK films,19 resulting in in-plane residual tensile strain after the cooling process, as illustrated in Fig. 3g. By contrast, there is a significantly reduced diffraction peak shift for the M-PVK film, as shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S8b (ESI†). Evidently increased d-spacing of the C-PVK film is observed by varying the incident angles from 0° to 1°, while the d-spacing of the M-PVK film has an insignificant change, as shown in Fig. 3f. This certifies that the tensile strain of the PVK film especially in the bottom region is released, which in turn reduces the strain-induced lattice distortion.57 To fully prove the above point of view, we characterized the distribution of MoSe2 nanosheets in the PVK film by the elemental mapping of energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), we found that most MoSe2 nanosheets are distributed at the bottom of the PVK film and on the SnO2 surface. 2D MoSe2 nanosheets have a weak interaction between neighboring layers owing to the van der Waals forces, similar to graphene.58 The most MoSe2 nanosheets distributed on the bottom of the PVK film can play a role of “lubricant” between the ETL and PVK film to help lattice expansion or shrinkage and therefore release interfacial tensile strain (Fig. 3g).59
Residual strain in the PVK film has been a burden on device stability.60,61 Stress relaxation could correlate to the increase in the humidity stability of the perovskite absorber,62 which is often overlooked. Accordingly, the M-PVK film is anticipated to improve the resistance to the oxygen/moisture-induced degradation by the above analysis. To confirm the abovementioned consideration, the time-resolved water contact angle was measured at C-PVK and M-PVK film surfaces, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The M-PVK film experience a larger initial water contact angle of 55.1°. However, the C-PVK film shows a smaller contact angle of 40° under the same conditions. This reveals that the M-PVK film has superior resistance to penetration of dampness over the C-PVK film. The humidity stability was also tested by storing the two types of PVK film with 35 ± 5% RH (Fig. S11, ESI†). The C-PVK film basically completely decomposed after standing for 200 hours, while the M-PVK film still maintains the PVK phase. The result indicates that after MoSe2 introduction, the long-term stability of PVK films is improved due to good crystallinity and relaxed residual stress of the M-PVK film.
To investigate the influence of MoSe2 nanosheets on the band structure of PSCs, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-Vis spectra of C-PVK and M-PVK films were measured, as shown in Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S12 (ESI†). The valence band maximum (VBM) was calculated according to the following formula: VBM = 21.21 eV−(Ecut-off − Eon-set), where Ecut-off and Eon-set represent the cut-off and on-set energy boundaries (Fig. 4a and b). Simultaneously, the corresponding Tauc plots of C-PVK and M-PVK are shown in Fig. 4c. According to the Tauc plots, the optical bandgaps of C-PVK and M-PVK remain almost unchanged, which means that the addition of MoSe2 has no effect on the band gap of PVK. Fig. 4d shows energy level diagram for different layers in PSCs. It can be observed that the VBM of M-PVK significantly shifts to −5.31 eV from −5.43 eV of C-PVK, which is closer to the VBM (−5.20 eV) of Spiro-OMeTAD HTL. The better energy level match at the perovskite/HTL interface facilitates the charge extraction and decreases the charge recombination loss, and hence, the higher Voc and Jsc could be acquired.63

2.3. Photovoltaic performance
To explore the influence of the MoSe2 additive on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, the devices were fabricated according to the following architecture: ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. 5a. For simplicity, next we refer to the PSCs without MoSe2 and with MoSe2 as C-PSCs and M-PSCs, respectively. Under standard AM 1.5 G illumination, the J–V curves of devices were recorded in Fig. 5b and the photovoltaic performance parameters summarized based on thirty devices under each condition are listed in Table 1. It is noted that a substantial increase in Jsc for all M-PSCs can be observed, which could be ascribed to the better crystallinity and lower defect density of PVK films. Similarly, the Voc and FF also improved significantly for all M-PSCs compared with those of C-PSCs. Specifically, the C-PSCs show an average PCE of 19.40 ± 0.44%, with an average Voc of 1.116 ± 0.017 V, average Jsc of 23.82 ± 0.23 mA cm−2, and average FF of 0.73 ± 0.01.

When an optimal amount of 0.1 mg mL−1 MoSe2 was added to the PVK layer, the average Voc of M-PSCs improved to 1.146 ± 0.09 V, the average FF increased to 0.77 ± 0.01 and the average Jsc rose to 24.54 ± 0.26 mA cm−2, yielding an average PCE of 21.76 ± 0.53%. Ultimately, the campion M-PSC with a PCE of 22.80% was obtained. The improved Voc and FF can be attributed not only to the improved PVK films but also the matching energy level structure. Thus, it can conclude that the MoSe2 nanosheets additive is a very effective method for achieving high-efficiency PSCs.
To further elucidate the advantages of the MoSe2 nanosheets as additive in the PVK film, we evaluated the trap density and the ability of charge extraction. The trap-state densities of holes and electrons of PVK films were measured with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Fig. 6a and b displays the kink in the dark J–V curve for the C-PSC and M-PSC. The linearly increasing region indicates ohmic response, and the quick nonlinear increasing area indicates the fully filled trap states.64 The voltage at the kink point is called the trap-filled limit voltage VTFL, and the trap state density ntrap is determined by equation65:ntrap = 2VTFLε0εr/eL2where ntrap is the trap state density in devices, L is the thickness of the PVK film, e is the electron elementary charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant. In the electron-only device (Fig. 6a), the VTFL of the C-PSC is 0.218 V, and that of M-PSC is 0.196 V. The corresponding electron trap-state density values are 2.15 × 1017 and 1.93 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. In the same way, for the hole-only device (Fig. 6b), the VTFL of the C-PSC is 0.198 V, and that of M-PVK is 0.174 V. The corresponding hole trap-state density values are 1.95 × 1017 and 1.72 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. This clearly shows that M-PSCs reduced carrier trap-state density significantly, which is beneficial for enhancing the Voc and FF. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shown in Fig. 6c is used to analyze the charge transfer and recombination behavior within PSCs. Compared with the C-PSC, M-PSC has a lower value of Rtr and a higher value of Rrec (Table S1, ESI†), suggesting that charge transfer is improved and the charge recombination is restricted.

For the M-PSC, the enhancement of Rrec is primarily due to the high quality PVK films, which is mainly manifested in the reduction of the defect state density and the relexation of tensile stress. The Mott–Schottky plots was researched according to capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements (Fig. 6d), the built-in potentials (Vbi) of 0.97 and 1.09 V are obtained for the C-PSC and M-PSC, respectively. Increasing Vbi was critical for Voc enhancement of PSC. The higher flat band potential can provide greater driving force and reduce the space accumulation and recombination of carrier.66 Similarly, as shown in Fig. 6e, compared with the C-PVK film, the PL intensity of the M-PVK film was enhanced obviously, indicating the suppression of undesirable nonradiative recombination. Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and integrated current density curves of C-PSC and M-PSC are shown in Fig. 6f. The integrated Jsc values of C-PSC and M-PSC were calculated as 22.68 mA cm−2 and 23.37 mA cm−2, respectively, which in good agreement with the measured Jsc values from J–V curves. The enhancement of photoresponse in the short wavelength region for the M-PSC is mainly attributed to the likely association with the relatively fewer trap states in the M-PVK film, which is conformed to UV/Vis absorption spectra in Fig S12a (ESI†).67 Charge carrier kinetics at the interface was investigated by transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 6g and h. It can be observed that the photovoltage decay time increased from 68 μs for the C-PSC to 103 μs for M-PSC, which indicates that M-PSC owns a longer charger recombination lifetime. In contrast, a decrease of photocurrent decay time from 1.899 μs for the C-PSC to 1.296 μs for M-PSC can also be observed in Fig. 6h, indicating a speedup of charge carrier transport. The results from the transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurement are well consistent with those of EIS characterization as mentioned in Fig. 6c. Thus, the MoSe2 additive contributes toward the reduction of defect states in the M-PVK film, which effectively enhances the optoelectronic performance of M-PSC. Moreover, the unencapsulated C-PSC and M-PSC were tested for 1000 hours under N2 conditions to study their stability. The M-PSC maintains over 90% of original efficiency, while that of C-PSC decreased to 80% of original efficiency (Fig. 6i). Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the results of C-PSC and M-PSC stored for 1000 hours under 15–20% RH at room temperature in air. The M-PSC maintains over 80% of original efficiency, while that of the C-PSC decreased to 60% of original efficiency. These results illustrate that MoSe2 as an additive significantly strengthens oxygen/moisture resistance and then environmental stability of PSCs.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we employed 2D MoSe2 nanosheets as an additive to fabricate highly efficient planar PSCs by a two-step process. The results demonstrate that the reactivity of the PbI2 film with MAI/FAI is enhanced by inducing the formation of a porous PbI2 layer with help of MoSe2 nanosheets, which effectively reduces the amount of residual PbI2 in the perovskite film and effectively reduce Pb0 defects, and finally achieved high quality perovskite film. Furthermore, after MoSe2 introduction, the residual tensile stress of the perovskite film during the annealing process is also released. Moreover, the energy level offset between the perovskite layer and the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer is reduced and thus their energy-level alignment become more favorable for facilitating the transfer of the photogenerated holes from the perovskite active layer to the HTL. Owing to the multiple effects of the MoSe2 additive, a champion PCE of 22.80% and an average PCE of 21.76% were achieved for the PSCs prepared with the optimal MoSe2 concentration. These values exceed obviously compared to the control PSCs with the highest PCE of 20.92% and an average PCE of 19.40%. In addition, the stability of both perovskite film and device are improved by introducing MoSe2. Thus, our work successfully proves that MoSe2 is a feasible and effective additive for the fabrication of highly efficient two-step-processed PSCs, and paves the way for the use of this novel approach with other 2D materials.

The SnO2 colloidal precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Potassium phytate was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Company. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene, and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were all purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology in China. Lead iodide (PbI2) was purchased from TCI Company. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-2-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co Ltd.
4.2. Synthesis of MoSe2 nanosheets
MoSe2 nanosheets were prepared by the intercalation reaction using a two-electrode electrochemical cell. MoSe2 single crystal powder and graphite rod were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. The MoSe2 single crystal powder is fixed to the platinum sheet metal electrode with a conductive copper mesh. Acetonitrile solution (40 mL; 5 mg mL−1 or higher) of quaternary ammonium bromide (tetraheptyl ammonium bromide) as an electrolyte. The applied voltage was set to 20 V and the intercalation process was carried out for 2 hours. The electrolyte concentration and intercalation voltage can be adjusted to adjust the reaction rate. During intercalation, a negative voltage is applied to the MoSe2 (cathode) so that the positively charged THA+ (tetraheptyl ammonium ion) is inserted between the layers of the MoSe2 crystal. After the reaction is complete, the MoSe2 powder evolves into an expanded and fluffy structure. Then, washing was repeated with ethanol, and the washed materials were dispersed in DMF, followed by ultrasonic stripping treatment for 60–120 min in a plasma cleaner with a power of 100 W. Finally, the ultrasonic solution was centrifuged, with the supernatant at 1000 rpm and precipitate at 8000 rpm. After repeating 3 times, pure MoSe2 nanosheets dispersed in DMF were finally obtained.
4.3. Device fabrication
ITO glass was cleaned sequentially through sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Prior to deposition, the ITO was treated with UV ozone for 15 min. The thin SnO2 film was formed by spin-coating onto the substrates from a diluted SnO2 precursor solution (SnO2 dispersion liquid mixed up with deionized water at 1:4 by volume) at 4000 rpm for 30 s; the sample was then annealed in air at 150 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the ITO/SnO2 substrate was cleaned with UV ozone for 15 min to improve the surface wetting in the following steps. To prepare the perovskite film, 1.5 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO (9:1) was spin-coated on the ITO/SnO2 substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and then the sample was annealed at 50 °C for 4 min. A solution of FAI, MAI, and MACl (90 mg:6.39 mg:9 mg) in IPA (1 mL) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s; the as-formed fresh film was then converted to a black perovskite film through annealing on a hot plate in air at 100 °C for 30 min (20–30% humidity). For the MoSe2 dopant perovskite film, MoSe2 nanosheets dispersed in DMF solution with different concentrations were added to 1.5 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO (9:1) was spin-coated on the ITO/SnO2 substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and then the sample was annealed at 50 °C for 4 min. A solution of FAI, MAI, and MACl (90 mg:6.39 mg:9 mg) in IPA (1 mL) was added dropwise to the PbI2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s; the as-formed fresh film was then converted to a black perovskite film through annealing on a hot plate in air at 100 °C for 30 min (20–30% humidity). After the perovskite film had formed, the sample was transferred to a glove box and then a solution of Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene (72.3 mg mL−1) containing Li-TFSI solution (18 μL; prepared as a 520 mg mL−1 solution in ACN) and TBP (29 μL) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a Ag film (100 nm) was deposited, as the counter electrode by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum.
4.4. Device characterization
The absorption spectra of perovskite thin films were obtained by a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (V-570, JASCO, Japan) which was equipped with an integrated sphere set up and which can measure the absorption in the wavelength region of 190–2500 nm with an accuracy of ±1.5 nm. A Bruker D8 Advance XRD instrument with Cu radiation was used to measure and analyze the crystal structure and properties of PbI2 and perovskite films without and with MoSe2. A high-resolution field-emission Zeiss GeminiSEM 300 SEM instrument was used to measure the top-view and cross-sectional images of PbI2 and perovskite films without and with MoSe2. A photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure Pb 4f of XPS spectra. An NX10 atomic force microscope from Park Systems to measure the surface morphology and roughness of PbI2 and perovskite films without and with MoSe2. Photoluminescence was measured using an Edinburgh FLS980 with a laser source of 325 nm was used to excite the perovskite films. The solar cell efficiency was measured using a solar simulator (Abet SUN3000) in which the output power (100 mW cm−2) and solar spectrum of the lamps were corrected by a calibrated silicon wafer solar cell (Abet Technology). The current versus voltage measurements were done for electron-only and hole devices using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The capacitance–voltage measurement was conducted with a Keysight E4990A impedance analyzer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was performed under dark conditions under short-circuit conditions. A Donghua DH7001 electrochemical workstation was employed for the measurement and analysis. The frequency (f) range from 1 Hz to 200 kHz was applied for the measurement without the bias voltage. The EQE measurement was conducted using a power source (Zolix Sirius-SS) with monochromator (Zolix Omni-λ). The active area of devices was fixed at 0.04 cm2.
