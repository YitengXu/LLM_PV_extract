    , Accepted 9th January 2017First published on 9th January 2017AbstractIn this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of indium monochalcogenide (InX with X = S, Se, Te) monolayers with and without strains. Our results show that InX monolayers are indirect semiconductors. Upon the application of strain, the band structures can be modulated and an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition is observed in an InSe monolayer. The electron mobility of up to 2.0 × 103 cm2 (V s)−1 is quantitatively determined in the framework of deformation potential theory. Though the mobility of holes is relatively small, it can be greatly improved by introducing compressive strain, with a value up to 2.8 × 103 cm2 (V s)−1. In addition, the performance of the photoresponse of InX monolayers is evaluated based on first-principles calculations. Under illumination, the InX based systems exhibit high photoresponsivity (Rph = 0.18 A W−1) and external quantum efficiency (EQE = 62.5%), which can be further enhanced via strain. Owing to such excellent electronic and optoelectronic merits, InX monolayers will become promising candidates for next-generation ultrathin and flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.
1 Introduction
Since the successful synthesis of graphene, there has been growing interest in atomically two-dimensional (2D) materials for applications in electronics and optoelectronics, including optical sensors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes.1–3 A large number of 2D materials, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs)4–6 and black phosphorus (BP),7,8 have been experimentally fabricated or theoretically predicted. As a class of layered semiconducting materials, indium monochalcogenides (InX with X = S, Se, Te) have attracted intense interest due to their exotic electronic structures and optoelectronic properties.9–11 For example, Sucharitakul and co-workers11 demonstrated that the intrinsic electron mobility of InSe obtained by mechanical exfoliation exceeds 103 cm2 (V s)−1, which is well above that of many other 2D semiconductors.6,12,13 In recent experiments, few-layered GaS, GaSe, and InSe have been proven to be promising candidates in fields such as optoelectronics, field-effect transistors (FETs), and solar energy conversion.10,14–16 Despite this recent explosion of experimental results, theoretical investigations on the optoelectronic properties of the InX (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayers are still in their early stages. Additionally, little is known about how strains influence the photoresponse or photovoltaic performance of 2D material based nano-devices. Thus, new findings in strain-engineered modulation on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of InX monolayers are highly desirable.
In this work, to figure out the strain-induced electronic and optoelectronic properties of InX systems, a comprehensive study is presented in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that the band gaps of InX monolayers are tunable over a relatively large range. A transition between indirect and direct band-gaps is observed for the InSe monolayer under compressive strain, which favors the solar energy conversion. In addition, the hole mobility can be greatly improved by introducing compressive strain, with the value up to 2.8 × 103 cm2 (V s)−1, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the unstrained case. For the first time, the performance of the photoresponse of InX monolayers is evaluated based on the first-principles calculations. Upon illumination, InX monolayers exhibit high photoresponsivity (1.8 × 10−1 A W−1), which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of MoS2 based phototransistors (1.6 × 10−2 A W−1) and 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of graphene based photodetectors (5 × 10−4 A W−1).17,18 The performance of the InX monolayers can be further enhanced by the strains. These results demonstrate that InX monolayers are a new category of 2D semiconductors with high potential for novel applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.
2 Computational methods
2.1 DFT calculations
Spin-polarized DFT calculations are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).19,20 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method21 is used from the standard VASP library with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functional.22 Ground state structures are found by allowing all systems to fully relax with respect to both the atomic positions and the supercell shape and size using a conjugate-gradient method with an energy convergence of 10−6 eV and a force convergence of 10−3 eV Å−1. The cutoff energy for the basis set is chosen to be 500 eV, and the Brillouin zone is sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 18 × 18 × 1.23 In this work, periodic boundary conditions are applied and a vacuum space of 20 Å along the z direction is set to avoid the interactions between two slabs in the nearest-neighbor unit cells, which gives well-converged results.
The state-of-the-art hybrid functional (HSE06) is used for all calculations,24,25 in which the hybrid functional is mixed with 25% exact Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange. A damped vdW correction based on Grimme's scheme is also incorporated to better describe the nonbonding interaction.26
2.2 Photocurrent calculations
In this study, we employ DFT methods within Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF-DFT) to calculate the photocurrent.27,28 The electron–photon interaction is treated as a perturbation on the self-consistent Hamiltonian of the system (Ĥ0). The total Hamiltonian can be written as (1)where  is the momentum of the electron and A is the electromagnetic vector potential.29,30 The photoinduced current is calculated as follows:30–32 (2)where α stands for the lead of source/drain. Tα(E) is the effective transmission coefficient of lead α, which can be expressed as: Tα(E) = Tr{iΓα[(1 − fα)G<ph + fαG>ph]}(3)where Γα represents the line-width function which describes the interactions between the electrodes α and the central scattering regions. fα is the Fermi distribution function of lead α. G<ph and G>ph denote the zeroth order approximations of the smaller and greater Green's functions based on the Keldysh equation.31,32
3 Results and discussion
The single-layer InX (X = S, Se, Te) consists of four sublayers, stacking in the sequence of X–In–In–X (see Fig. 1). As the chalcogen atoms vary from S to Te, the optimized lattice constants a and bond lengths dIn–X increase by 11.3% and 12.6%, respectively. By contrast, no significant changes, i.e. less than 1.5%, are found for bond lengths dIn–In and bond angles. Table 1 summarises the geometrical properties of InX monolayers.

In order to check whether these InX monolayers are easy to synthesize, we calculate the cleavage energy γ, which is the energy per unit surface area necessary to separate the monolayer InX from the surface. γ is defined as: (4)where N is the number of surface layers, A is the surface area, and EN and EN−1 are the total energies of the surface with N and N−1 layers, respectively. Esl denotes the energy of the single layer InX. Note that two surfaces are generated during the cleavage, and therefore γ is corrected by the factor of 2. Fig. 1c shows that the cleavage energy of the single-layer InS material is much larger than that of single-layer MoS2, suggesting that the InS monolayer is difficult to synthesize by micromechanical exfoliation. While for InSe and InTe monolayers, γ is smaller than or comparable with the value of the MoS2 monolayer. Therefore, we expect that the single-layer InSe and InTe can be fabricated easily by cleaving their 3D counterparts. Indeed single-layer InSe has already been synthesized successfully.10,11
Based on the orbital characteristics, the band structures are plotted using different colors, ranging from blue (contributed by In) to red (contributed by X = S, Se, or Te). The calculated band structures of single-layer InX obtained by HSE06 functionals are shown in Fig. 2. An extraordinary caldera-shape valence-band edge (refers to Γ1+) is observed. Li and Appelbaum indicated that such unusually distorted upper valence-band dispersion could be primarily the result of purely orbital interactions.33 Besides the conduction band minimum (CBM) Γ2− and valence band Γ1+, the band edges also include two pairs of doubly degenerate valence bands, i.e. Γ3± as shown in Fig. 2e. It can be seen that the free standing InX monolayers are indirect band-gap semiconductors. For InS and InSe monolayers, the valence band maximum (VBM) is located between the Γ and M points, while the CBM occurs at the Γ point. For single-layer InTe, however, the VBM is located at the Γ point while the CBM transfers to the M point (see Fig. 2h).

The Fermi level is set to zero. 
The strain-induced bandgap engineering has recently been demonstrated to be a powerful technique for semiconductors, in particular for 2D materials due to their flexible features. In experiments, the 2D materials can be deformed using an atomic force microscope (AFM) or by a two-point bending method.34,35 It is predicted and confirmed that appropriate strains can exert an important influence on the electronic structures and optical properties, and trigger internal changes of the system.35–37 Thus, it is of significance to investigate how the strains influence the electronic properties of InX monolayers. We probe this question by introducing −3% to 3% biaxial strains on InX monolayers and keep the crystal symmetries. The isotropic strain ε is defined as ε = Δa/a0, where a0 is the equilibrium lattice constant and Δa is the deformation of a0. As shown in Fig. 2d, when the compressive strain is applied on the single-layer InSe, the transition between indirect and direct band gaps is observed, in which the CBM and the VBM are located at the Γ-point. The direct-band-gap InSe monolayer is expected to have higher solar energy conversion efficiency compared to those of indirect-band-gap monolayers. By contrast, an indirect band gap is observed for the InSe monolayer when the tensile strain is applied as shown in Fig. 2f.
In Fig. 3, we plot the band gap evolution of InX monolayers as a function of the strains. The results show that for InS and InSe monolayers, the band gaps reach the maximum values when the compressive strain (ε = −1%) is applied, and decrease gradually with the increase of the compressive strain. In the case of tensile strain, the band gaps decrease approximately linearly, and reduce by 20% and 19% for InS and InSe monolayers under 3% tensile strains, respectively. For the InTe monolayer, the bandgap peaks with a maximum value Eg = 2.32 eV at ε = 1% tensile strain, and decreases to 1.96 eV when the compressive strain (ε = 3%) is applied. In addition, as the chalcogen species changes from S to Te, the band gaps decrease, which can be attributed to the decrease in ionicity.9,38

To obtain a deep insight into the strain-engineered modulation on the electronic structures of the InX monolayers, we analyze the physical origin of the atomic orbitals at the band edge positions. The InSe monolayer is taken as an example. In Fig. 4a and b, the band-decomposed charge densities of the CBM and the VBM at the Γ point are plotted. The results indicate that at the Γ point, the CBM is dominated by the Se 4pz and In 5s orbitals, while the valence band Γ3− is mainly composed of the Se 4px and 4py states. When the compressive strain (ε) is applied, the position of the valence band Γ1+ goes down, and eventually the VBM occurs at the Γ point (see Fig. 2d). This can be understood in terms of the chemical bonding. The bond length dIn–Se decreases with the increase of ε, giving rise to a larger overlapping of the charge density between In and Se atoms. The stronger bonding between In and Se atoms indicates that the valence band Γ1+, which is hybridized by the In 5s, 5pz, and Se 4pz states, becomes more stable for the electrons and thus moves to the lower energy region. When ε is large enough, i.e. 3% in our case, the energy level of Γ3− is higher than that of Γ1+, and the indirect-to-direct band-gap transition occurs. On the other hand, when the tensile strain is applied, the bond length dIn–Se increases. The In–Se bonds are weakened due to the smaller electron cloud overlap. As a result, the valence band Γ1+ is lifted up (see Fig. 2f). Similar results are also found for InS and InTe monolayers. However, when the systems undergo compressive strains, the CBM changes from the Γ point to the M point (see Fig. 2a and g), and the systems are still indirect semiconductors.

From the point view of potential applications, charge mobility is one of the critical factors. In the following section, we first calculate the carrier effective masses, which can present a quantitative description of the carrier transfer ability along the specific directions. The effective masses of electrons (me*) and holes (mh*) along the M → Γ direction are calculated by fitting parabolic functions to the CBM and the VBM, which are expressed as follows: (5)where k is the wave vector, and Ek is the energy corresponding to the wave vector k. As shown in Table 1, small effective masses for electrons are observed, especially in the InSe monolayer. The predicted me* is 0.18 m0 (where m0 is the free-electron mass), which is 3 times smaller than that of the MoS2 monolayer (me* = 0.54 m0).39 It is remarkable that the valence band appears to be nearly flat in the M → Γ direction, giving rise to the heavy effective masses for holes. Nevertheless, when the compressive strain is applied, the valence band Γ3− is lifted up, and the VBM transfers to the Γ point, leading to the smaller hole effective masses. The calculated mh* of the InSe monolayer under the compressive strain (ε = 3%) is 0.16 m0, which is close to the reported value of black phosphorus (mh* = 0.15 m0).8
To further examine the mobility property of the lateral heterostructures, we provide theoretical prediction for the carrier mobility (μ). μ is estimated using the deformation potential (DP) model proposed by Bardeen and Shockley,40 which is expressed as:8,41,42 (6)where kB, T, and e represent the Boltzmann constant, temperature, and electron charge, respectively. Ed is the deformation potential constant, defined by Ed = dVedge/dε. Here Vedge is the energy change of the VBM for holes or the CBM for electrons under appropriate strains. The elastic modulus C is derived from (∂2E/∂ε2)/S0, where E represents the total energy and S0 stands for the area of the system. A temperature of 300 K is employed to calculate the mobility. The calculated μ as well as two other important factors, namely the deformation potential Ed and the elastic modulus C, is presented in Table 2. The predicted electron mobilities in InX monolayers exceed 103 cm2 (Vs)−1 at the temperature of 300 K, which are consistent with previous measurements.11 Due to the heavy effective masses, the mobility of holes (μh) is much slow. As has been discussed above, μh can be greatly improved by introducing the compressive strain. In particular, the calculated μh of the InSe monolayer is up to 2.8 × 103 cm2 (V s)−1, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the unstrained case. The high carrier mobilities make InX monolayers extremely appealing for applications in field effect transistors and optoelectronic technology.

We now turn on the light and investigate the photoinduced current in InX monolayers. As shown in Fig. 5a, a two-probe model is employed, which consists of a central scattering region sandwiched by two semi-infinite InX sheets as electrodes. An external bias voltage Vds = 0.2 V is applied across the scattering region. The incident light power density is 0.1 μW mm−2 in our simulations. The predicated photocurrents of the InX monolayers as a function of photon energy are plotted in Fig. 5b. The results indicate that under illumination, the electron–hole pairs are generated in InX monolayers via the interband transitions. These electrons and holes were swept to electrodes in different directions guided by the drain–source electric field, leading to the photoinduced current.

One critical figure-of-merit to determine the performance of the InX monolayers is the responsivity (Rph), which is defined as: (7)where e is the electron charge. Fph is the photon flux defined as the number of photons per unit time per unit area. The calculated Rph values for InS, InSe, and InTe monolayers are 0.13 A W−1, 0.18 A W−1, and 0.15 A W−1, respectively, which are about 1 order of magnitude higher than those of MoS2 based phototransistors (1.6 × 10−2 A W−1) and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of graphene based photodetectors (5 × 10−4 A W−1).17,18 In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is also determined. EQE is the number of extracted free electrons flowing out of the device per incident photon, which is expressed as: (8)where h, c, and λ are Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the wavelength of light, respectively. The peak EQEs in InS, InSe, and InTe monolayers are up to 50.9%, 62.5%, and 52.6%, respectively, suggesting powerful potential in optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.
To investigate the influence of the strains on the photoresponse characteristics, we calculated the photocurrent of the InSe monolayer as a function of photon energy under different strains (ε). As shown in Fig. 6, when the compressive strain is applied, the photocurrent is enhanced due to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition at the Γ point. The corresponding Rph and EQE are 0.21 A W−1 and 71.9%, respectively, which are about 15% higher than those of the unstrained InSe monolayer. On the other hand, when the system undergoes a tensile strain, it offers a broader spectral response in the visible-ultraviolet (UV) regions. The corresponding Rph and EQE are 0.19 A W−1 and 63.5%, respectively. Thus, one can expect that appropriate strain is always favorable, which can improve the performance of InX monolayers in fields such as optoelectronics, FETs, and solar energy conversion.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated the electronic structures and optoelectronic properties of InX (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayers. Our results show that upon the application of strain, the band gaps of InX monolayers can be modified and tuned over a relatively large range. A transition between indirect and direct band gaps is observed in the InSe monolayer under the compressive strain, which is favorable for the adsorption of the light. In addition, the predicted electron mobility exceeds 103 cm2 (V s)−1, which is consistent with previous experimental results. Though the mobility of holes is relatively slow, it can be greatly improved by applying the compressive strain.
For the first time, the performance of the photoresponse of InX monolayers is evaluated based on the NEGF-DFT calculations. Under illumination, the InX based systems exhibit high photoresponsivity and EQE, with the values up to 0.18 A W−1 and 62.5%, respectively. Such values can be further enhanced by the strains. Owing to such excellent electronic and optoelectronic merits, InX monolayers will become not only promising candidates for fabricating advanced appliances of photodetectors and low power consumption FETs, but also essential components for configuring 2D heterostructure devices.
