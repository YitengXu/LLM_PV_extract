    , Accepted 30th June 2020First published on 1st July 2020AbstractPlanar-heterojunction lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their simple and low-temperature fabrication process. Unfortunately, the electron transport layer (ETL) in these planar devices still suffer low electron mobility due to inefficient photoelectron extraction and carrier recombination, leading to low stable efficiency with high J–V hysteresis. Here, we prepared chlorine-capped tin oxide nanocrystals (SnO2-Cl) by facile treatment of SnO2 nanoparticles with chloroform-D/2-methoxy ethanol solvent. By introducing halogen (Cl), the hydrophobic surface increases the grain size and crystallinity of perovskites, which dramatically reduces the charge trap density and suppresses the charge recombination. Combining the high work function, SnO2-Cl as an ETL exhibits superior electronic properties by mitigating non-radiative recombination with faster charge carrier transfer. The results show that SnO2-Cl based planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells produce remarkably higher performances compared with untreated SnO2, increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 15.07% to 18.1% free of hysteresis. This simple method, providing the effect of halogen modified electron transport layer interface, paves the way for its application in interface engineering on ETL/perovskites for PSCs with enhanced photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
During the last decade, the state-of-the-art efficiency of organometal trihalide perovskite photovoltaic (OTPV) devices has markedly risen from 3.8% to 25.2%.1–4 The planar structure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted widespread attention due to their low-cost and simple device fabrication processing.5–7 The electron transport layer (ETL) is extremely important to extract light-generated electrons and block holes, which is beneficial to ameliorate the directed transfer of carriers. The SnO2 ETL has been made into planar perovskite solar cells because of its high electron mobility (240 cm2 V−1 s−1), suitable bandgap (above 3.6 eV), and low conduction band minimum, suggesting a highly efficient electron extraction and transfer rate.8 Very recently, researchers have reported that stable SnO2-based devices acquire high efficiency exceeding 20%, rivaling the performance of the advanced TiO2 ETL-based perovskite solar cells.9–11 This proves that SnO2 as the ETL is a good candidate for highly efficient perovskite photovoltaic devices.
Nonetheless, low-temperature processed SnO2 films suffer from untightness due to low crystallinity, which is detrimental to the growth of perovskite on the substrate of the electron transport layer.12 Metal ion dopants, organic materials insertion and bilayer ETL strategies have successfully improved the quality and stability of the perovskite film.13–15 By doping noble metals, such as yttrium, strontium, gold, niobium, and antimony into tin oxide to improve the number of carriers, the performance of the device has shown to be improved. However, the expensive price and barren storage limit the development of its commercialization.16–20 Although the diverse polymer interfacial materials have also been used to passivate defects and enhance stability, they always suffer from the complex processing of synthesis.21,22 The stability is still the biggest challenge to the commercialization of PSCs. Charge carrier accumulation on the contact interface breeds the notorious recombination of the carrier by ion migration in the perovskite layer.23 Therefore, a trap-free perovskite film is especially essential to improve the carrier transport efficiency. Tan's group has reported a proved interfacial Cl atom contact passivation strategy.24 Although the surface defects of the perovskite film are passivated, a large number of defects still exist at the grain boundaries.
In this work, a Cl-doped SnO2 ETL was obtained by simply adding SnO2 nanocrystals into the 2-methoxy ethanol and chloroform-D mixture solvent. We demonstrated that Cl-doped SnO2 can produce a smooth and hydrophobic electron transport interface, guaranteeing perovskite films with high crystallization and large grains. Additionally, a more aligned band level between the perovskite and the ETL leads to faster charge carrier extraction and transportation. As a result, the prepared PSCs deliver a maximum PCE of 18.1% with obvious improvements of short-circuit current density (23.6 mA cm−2).
Experimental
Preparation of SnO2-Cl solution
For this, 1 g of SnCl4·5H2O (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in 20 ml of ethylene glycol with vigorous stirring for 1 h. After that, 2 ml of acetic acid and 2 ml of tetramethylammonium hydroxide were added into the solution drop by drop. Meanwhile, the mixed solution was immersed in an oil bath. A white cloudy mixture was obtained by continuous stirring at 100 °C. Then the solution was refluxed at 170 °C for 2 h. The solution was washed three times with deionized water by centrifugation, and then the deposit was dried overnight. Then, 5 mg of SnO2 powder was dispersed into 1 ml of anhydrous chloroform-D (Adamas) and 1 ml of 2-methoxy ethanol (Alfa Aesar).
Device fabrication
The glass/FTO substrate (15 Ω sq−1, Kaivo Co., Ltd) was sequentially washed with isopropanol, acetone, distilled water, and isopropanol. The FTO substrates were cleaned by a UV–ozone cleaner for 30 min. The SnO2-Cl (SnO2) solution was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate in ambient air and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min, and then the electron transfer layer (ETL) substrates were put into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For the perovskite film, the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 precursor solution (1.5 M) in DMF and DMSO (4:1 volume ratio) was spin-coated on the ETL at 500 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 50 s continuously, then annealed at 110 °C for 20 min. After being cooled, the spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL) was whereafter spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Then, 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD (Xi’an Polymer Light) and 1 ml of chlorobenzene were mixed upon addition of 17.5 μl of Li-TFSI salt (520 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) and 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (100 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene). Finally, 100 nm of Au electrode was deposited on the HTL by electrical evaporation.
Characterization

J–V measurements of the solar cells were obtained under a solar simulated (Newport Corporation, Japan) AM1.5 G spectrum illumination using a source meter (Keithley Model 2400). The EQE spectra were investigated by a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10). Characterization of SnO2-Cl nanoparticles was obtained by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). The surface morphologies of the SnO2 film, the perovskite film and the cross-section of the devices were obtained by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5900LV). Both the SnO2 film and the perovskite film were investigated using Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectra (UV-vis, TU-1810PC) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nano-Scope NS3A) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Haoyuan DX-2700XRD). Steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were performed with a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (FluoTime 300, PicoQuant GmbH).
Results and discussion
The schematic illustration of the SnO2-Cl preparation procedure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The SnO2 nanocrystals were dispersed in 2-methoxy ethanol and chloroform-D mixed solutions with a volume ratio of 1:1 to obtain a transparent yellowish SnO2-Cl solution. Both SnO2 and SnO2-Cl solutions were coated on the FTO substrate by a spin-coating process. Both the cross-sectional SEM images of SnO2 (Fig. S1, ESI†) and SnO2-Cl ETLs (Fig. 6b) show that the thickness of the ETLs are 36 nm, indicating that the trace amount of chlorine will not affect the deposition of the ETL. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of the SnO2-Cl film was detected. In Fig. 1(b), the spectrum of Cl 2p can be split into Cl 2p1/2 and Cl 2p3/2 with binding energies of 198.1 eV and 199.9 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the Cl− in SnO2-Cl.25 From Fig. 1(c), the binding energies of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 at 495.23 eV and 486.75 eV, respectively, are consistent with Sn4+ in SnO2.26 The satellite peak with a binding energy of 497.26 eV can also be observed, which can be ascribed to the Sn2+ in SnO2.27

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of SnO2-Cl is shown in Fig. 2(a). The particles are uniformly distributed on the FTO substrate with an average diameter of ∼4 nm. From the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2(b)), SnO2-Cl exhibits high crystallinity with a spacing of about 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (110) lattice, of the SnO2 rutile phase.28Fig. 2(c) shows the electron diffraction circles corresponding to (110), (111) and (022) crystal planes of SnO2-Cl, confirming its high crystallinity. The chlorine was successfully incorporated into SnO2, proved by the energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) that showed peaks in connection with O, Sn and Cl (Fig. 2(d)), which is consistent with the XPS survey spectrum of SnO2-Cl (Fig. S2, ESI†). Furthermore, the scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (STEM-EDX) elemental mappings of SnO2-Cl shown in Fig. 2(e) show that (f) O, (g) Sn, and (h) Cl were homogeneously distributed in the SnO2-Cl ETL film.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pure SnO2 and SnO2-Cl films, respectively. Pure SnO2 exhibits a rough surface with pinholes. Nevertheless, SnO2-Cl nanoparticles form a dense and smooth film. The compact and pinhole-free ETL plays an important role in the performance of the device.29 The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the SnO2 film shows an inhomogeneous film with a very large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 7.1 nm (Fig. 3(c)), and a smoother film is observed for SnO2-Cl as reflected by the dramatically decreased RMS roughness of 3.6 nm (Fig. 3(d)), which coincide with the surface of SEM images. A smooth ETL surface is expected to effectively suppress the non-uniform nucleation of the perovskite layer.

(g) J–V characteristics and (h) evolution of the photocurrent of the devices with FTO/SnO2/Au and FTO/SnO2-Cl/Au structures, with a bias voltage of 0.8 V. 
The transmittance spectra of SnO2 and SnO2-Cl films exhibit high transmission values of more than 80% (Fig. 3(e)). The SnO2-Cl film shows slightly better transmission in the visible range than the SnO2 film, allowing more photon flux to reach the perovskite light absorber layer for the generation of charge carriers. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the pure SnO2 and SnO2-Cl films are shown in Fig. 3(f), which show the absorption onset edge at 357 nm and 363 nm, respectively. As displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the band gaps of pure SnO2 and SnO2-Cl are 3.65 eV and 3.61 eV, respectively, determined by linear extrapolation of the leading edges of the Tauc plot.30 In addition, J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 3(g), indicating that the electrical conductivity of SnO2-Cl is higher than that of the pure SnO2 film. This result is supported by the smooth and flat SnO2-Cl surface with fewer defects. To study the steady current output of the ETL, the steady-state photocurrent (Fig. 3(h)) was measured utilizing the FTO/SnO2 (SnO2-Cl)/Au structure by holding a constant bias voltage (0.8 V). The curve of SnO2 has a little fluctuation, while the curve of SnO2-Cl is relatively flat, indicating that the SnO2-Cl ETL has a more stable photocurrent output.
High-quality perovskite films are the prerequisite for the superior performance of solar cells. Heterogeneous nucleation of large grain perovskite films has been demonstrated in Fig. 4(a) that the non-wetting surface could suppress heterogeneous nucleation due to the smooth surface and suitable contact angles of the coated solution.31,32 The non-wetting and smooth ETL has fewer nucleation sites and larger nucleus spacing leading to larger grain size and fewer grain boundaries. Therefore, large perovskite grains have enough space to grow in the enlargement of nucleus spacing. Fig. 4(b) shows the wetting angle of the perovskite solution on SnO2 (5.8°) and SnO2-Cl (106.6°) ETLs, suggesting that the SnO2-Cl film surface is more hydrophobic. This indicates that the dragging force between perovskite and ETL films is reduced from γS1 to γS2 as the surface wettability decreases. More pieces of evidence have shown that the dragging force easily forms small perovskite grains on the ETL surface during annealing.33 It can be attributed that the grain boundaries on the wetting surface are anchored by defects on the ETL surface, hindering the grain boundary migration. Thus, the hydrophobic SnO2-Cl ETL aroused by the addition of Cl indicates the promoted quality of the perovskite active layer.

SEM images of perovskite films deposited on (c) SnO2 and (f) SnO2-Cl. AFM images of perovskite films deposited on (d and e) SnO2 and (g and h) SnO2-Cl with an FTO substrate. 

Fig. 4(c) and (f) show the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite thin films based on SnO2 and SnO2-Cl, respectively. According to the surface morphology, the average perovskite grain size on SnO2-Cl/FTO is about 500 nm, which is larger than that on SnO2/FTO (∼200 nm). This can be explained by the smooth and non-wetting ETL surface, which suppresses heterogeneous nucleation and enhances grain boundary migration. This result confirms that the hydrophobic surface makes it possible for perovskite to enlarge grain sizes. The large grain sizes possess fewer grain boundary defects thus reducing charge non-radiative recombination on the perovskite/ETL interface.
As shown in the AFM images of perovskite films deposited on SnO2/FTO (Fig. 4(d) and (e)) and SnO2-Cl/FTO (Fig. 4(g) and (h)), the average perovskite size has increased significantly, which is consistent with the SEM results. The RMS roughness of the perovskite surface increases from 9.8 nm to 22.2 nm, which is beneficial to the connection between the perovskite surface and the hole transfer layer (HTL) during spin-coating spiro-MeOTAD. A tightly-coupled HTL is able to effectively facilitate hole separation and extraction, thus boosting the PEC of the device.
The phase analysis of perovskite based on SnO2 and SnO2-Cl ETL surfaces was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 5(a)), which shows similar characteristic peaks at 13.98°, 28.16° and 31.8° that can be indexed to (110), (220) and (310) planes of the perovskite phase, respectively. The result confirmed that the presence of chlorine does not affect the perovskite phase. Fig. 5(b) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite coated on SnO2 and SnO2-Cl films. As can be seen, the perovskite/SnO2-Cl/FTO shows a very similar absorption characteristic with a higher absorption rate in the region below 800 nm in comparison with the perovskite/SnO2/FTO.

To gain the valence band maximum (VBM) of SnO2 and SnO2-Cl films, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was measured as shown in Fig. 5(c). Their VBM values were −7.8 eV and −7.65 eV, respectively, according to the cutoff edge and the Fermi edge.34,35 The bandgap values of SnO2 and SnO2-Cl were extrapolated to be 3.65 eV and 3.61 eV from the UV-vis absorption spectra. The schematic of band levels between perovskite and ETLs is shown in Fig. 5(d). Apparently, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of SnO2-Cl (−4.04 eV) is more suitable than SnO2 (−4.15 eV) to align with the CBM of the perovskite (−4.01 eV).36 The good band alignment between the SnO2-Cl ETL and perovskite could improve charge transfer. Fig. 5(e) shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films where a stronger quenched PL can be observed in the perovskite/SnO2-Cl/FTO than in pristine perovskite/SnO2/FTO. This result indicates that the perovskite coated on the SnO2-Cl ETL has faster charge transfer and more sufficient electron extraction, which are consistent with the band alignment between SnO2-Cl and perovskite. To deeply investigate the carrier transport, time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Fig. 5(f)) was used and the corresponding fitted TRPL parameters in perovskite films are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The fast decay (τ1) decreases from 16.04 ns to 4.46 ns, indicating more rapid interfacial charge transfer in the SnO2-Cl ETL-based device.37 The slow decay (τ2) decreases from 14.08 ns to 2.56 ns due to a lower recombination rate, indicating a high-quality perovskite film by the chlorine surface modification. The unique nature of the extended carrier lifetime is because that capturing of carriers are hampered in large grain perovskite. The enhanced transfer and suppressed recombination of charge carriers in the SnO2-Cl ETL-based device achieve better, more stable efficiency.38,39
The illustrative schematic of the PSC device architecture image is shown in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(b) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the completed device, wherein the ∼400 nm thick perovskite film was deposited using a one-step spin-coating method. The electron-only devices with the glass/FTO/SnO2 (with or without chlorine)/perovskite/spiro-OMETAD/Au structure as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(c) were used to calculate defect density using the space charge limited current method.40,41 The typical dark J–V curves with/without chlorine passivating treatment are shown in Fig. 6(c); the voltage of the intersection between the Ohmic region and the trap-filling limited region determines the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL). The trap density of perovskite (Dt) can be calculated according to eqn (1):42 (1)where e is the elementary charge, ε0 stands for vacuum permittivity, and ε and L represent the relative dielectric constant and thickness of perovskite. The trap density of perovskite based on the SnO2-Cl layer is calculated to be 1.54 × 1015 cm−3, whereas that of the device based on the SnO2 film is 5.14 × 1016 cm−3. The decrease of defects is ascribed to the large size of perovskite by the Cl surface modification ETL, thus improving the photoelectric properties of solar cells.

(d) J–V characteristics of devices with SnO2 and SnO2-Cl ETLs measured at forwarding scan (from 0 V to 1.1 V) and reverse scan (from 1.1 V to 0 V) at the scan rate 0.1 V s−1.

Fig. 6(d) shows the J–V curve of the device with SnO2 (SnO2-Cl) as ETLs investigated at forward scan (from 0 V to 1.1 V) and revers scan (from 1.1 V to 0 V) at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. Obviously, the device with chlorine treatment shows no observed hysteresis effect, which is much slighter than that for the device without chlorine treatment. The J–V parameters and hysteresis index values are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The modified J–V hysteresis index is determined by eqn (2):43 (2)where JRS (0.8VOC) and JFS (0.8VOC) represent the photocurrent density at 80% of VOC for the reverse scan and forward scan, respectively. The device based on SnO2 shows a large hysteresis index of 0.104 HI, and a small hysteresis index of 0.013 HI is observed for the SnO2-Cl based device, which indicate that the defect density based on perovskite/SnO2/FTO, which is higher than that based on perovskite/SnO2-Cl/FTO, may cause severe hysteresis.

Fig. 6(e) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the champion devices using different ETLs. The integrated photocurrents from the EQE are in good agreement with the measured JSC values for the devices based on SnO2 and SnO2-Cl, respectively. A good deal of solar cells using different ETLs were investigated to verify that the superficial Cl atoms enhance the device performance. The histogram of PCEs is shown in Fig. 6(f). A large number of SnO2-Cl based devices with high PCEs highlight the device reproducibility. The average device performance parameters (Table S3, ESI†) are attained from more than 30 solar cells. The average short-circuit current (JSC) increases from 21.02 mA cm−2 to 23.02 mA cm−2 with the incorporation of Cl, which is apparently due to the higher electronic extraction and faster carrier transportation. The average fill factor (FF) increased from 59% to 69%, which is primarily contributed by the improvement in the conductivity. The increase in VOC is resulted by the band alignment between SnO2-Cl and perovskite and lower carrier recombination. It is confirmed that an average PCE of 17.35% devices can be fabricated.
Long-term stability is another key index for PSCs, which is yet to be improved toward realistic device applications. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the photocurrent and PEC of the champion device based on SnO2-Cl were further examined at a constant bias of maximum output power point, and it can be seen that the device exhibits a stable PCE of 18.1% for almost 100 s. Fig. 7(b) shows the decay curve of PCEs (normalized to initial efficiencies) stored in nitrogen environment. After 500 h of conservation in the dark, 80% of the initial performance is maintained for the device based on SnO2-Cl while the device based on SnO2 has only 40% of the original PEC. It is apparent that the SnO2-Cl based device exhibits better stability than that of the SnO2 based one. The significant improvement in long-term stability in the device based on SnO2-Cl suggests an SnO2 ETL with chlorine surface modification, thus boosting the stability of the PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, an SnO2-Cl ETL was prepared through a simple chloroform-D solution mixing process. The grain sizes are significantly increased and the interfacial recombination of the perovskite film is effectively alleviated due to the hydrophobic surface of SnO2-Cl. In addition, the PCE was improved from 15.07% to over 18.1% free of hysteresis. Owing to the non-wetting surface as well as a better aligned CBM between the perovskite and ETL layers, the perovskite film with excellent performance can be grown at the SnO2-Cl surface. Our work shows that high solar cell performance could be obtained by the surface modification of the electronic selective layer. The surface modified electronic selective layer of halide elements provides a reliable reference for the preparation of high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
