    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractFlexible and transparent electrodes based on one-dimensional Ag nanowire@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 core–shell nanostructures with a tunable composition were fabricated by electrodeposition. The highly conductive Ag nanowire (NW) network was considered as a current collector, and the NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 nanostructures could grow on the surface of the Ag NWs, providing active materials with the synergistic effect of Ni and Co elements. The core–shell nanostructures integrate the advantages of metallic NWs for effective charge transport, the NiCo alloyed layer for a stable structure, and NiCo(OH)2 for high electrochemical performance. The composite electrode with a transmittance of 54.3% delivers a high areal capacitance of 22.2 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, and an excellent capacitance retention rate of 91.9% at 100 mV s−1 after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor composed of the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 cathode and the Ag NW/graphene anode achieves a maximum areal capacitance of 9.6 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2, high energy density of 3.0 W h kg−1 and power density of 3.5 W kg−1. The Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 core–shell nanostructured electrode shows great potential for flexible and transparent energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, transparent conductive films (TCFs) based on indium tin oxide (ITO) are in great demand for touch screens, displays, thin film solar cells and wearable devices.1–4 However, their intrinsic brittleness, high costs of the fabrication process and raw materials limit further development of ITO-based TCFs in the next-generation photoelectric devices.5–7 Therefore, emerging substitutes for ITO have been developing, such as graphene,8–10 carbon nanotubes,11 conductive polymers,12–14 MXenes,15 metal meshes,16–21 and metal nanowire percolation networks.22–24 Furthermore, with the rapid development of transparent and flexible electronic devices, their energy conversion and storage systems not only require large power/energy density, but also put forward high transparency and flexibility demands. Transparent and flexible supercapacitors (TFSs) as one of the ideal energy storage devices are the most promising to be realized by guaranteeing the transparency and flexibility of the electrodes and electrolyte.25
Generally, there are two strategies to fabricate the electrodes for TFSs. One method is to use the above-discussed TCFs as both the current collector and active materials simultaneously, e.g., conductive polymers and carbon materials. Higgins and Coleman spray-deposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene-4-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on a flexible polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET) substrate for TFS electrodes. The fabricated film with an area of 1 cm2 displayed an areal capacitance of 1 mF cm−2 and transmittance of 80%.26 Ajayan et al. prepared mechanically flexible and transparent carbon films using porous templates. The highly textured graphitic films acted as both the current collector and active materials, which were integrated with a solid polymer electrolyte to function as a TFS.27 Another method is to use the TCFs as a current collector, onto which the active materials are deposited to obtain electrochemical performance. Wang et al. prepared the electrode by depositing MnO2 island active materials on the surface of ITO films. The TFS based on the fabricated electrodes exhibited an areal capacitance of 4.73 mF cm−2 and transmittance of 44%.28 Lai et al. constructed TFSs based on Ag NW conducting networks and a PEDOT:PSS layer, which showed high transparency (>50%), good mechanical flexibility and high cycling stability with only slight areal capacitance decays after 100 times of bending (∼25%) and 5000 charge–discharge cycles (∼15%).29
The former method fabricates the electrodes by merging the current collector and active materials. However, the commonly used conductive polymers and carbon materials with limited photoelectric properties would restrict the electron transport efficiency of the electrodes, resulting in the decrease of TFS performance. Furthermore, in order to guarantee high transparency of the energy storage devices, the active material loading has to be reduced, and vice versa. In the latter method, the construction of a current collector and active materials is separated. Thus, an enhanced electrochemical performance and a large electrochemical window of the TFS can be achieved by properly selecting TCFs with excellent photoelectric properties and diversified active materials. As is well known, the TCFs based on metallic NW interconnected networks exhibit high conductivity and good transparency, which are considered as a potential current collector with high efficiency for electron transport.29 However, it is still a great challenge to resist the oxidation and corrosion of the metallic NWs during the processes of active material growth and TFS charge–discharge.30,31 Therefore, how to effectively attach active materials to the metallic NW surfaces without damaging their structures and consequently improve the electrochemical performance of the TFS electrodes is one of the urgent issues to be addressed.
It has been reported that the binary NiCo hydroxide exhibits much improved electrochemical performances by offering more redox reactions and higher stability, as compared to a single Ni or Co hydroxide.32 The electrodeposition of the NiCo hydroxide on the metallic NW surfaces can be implemented below the decomposition potential of Ag, which can not only avoid the damage of metallic NWs, but also form a protective layer of the NWs from air and electrolyte.33,34
Herein, we successfully fabricated a composite electrode consisting of Ag NWs and NiCo hydroxides with a unique core–shell nanostructure by electrodeposition. It is very interesting that a NiCo bi-metallic layer was formed between the Ag NW and NiCo hydroxide. The distinct one-dimensional Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 structure is supposed to offer multiple advantages. First, the NiCo layer not only assists to improve the electron transport efficiency at the interfaces, but also serves as an interlayer to decrease the lattice mismatch of the core and shell nanostructure. Second, the existence of the NiCo layer slows down the hydroxide expansion during the charge–discharge process, promoting the electrochemical cycling stability of the electrode. Third, the alloyed NiCo can further transform into active NiCo(OH)2 in an alkaline environment to contribute high electrochemical performances of the electrodes. Through properly tuning the Ni to Co ratio, this gives rise to a high areal capacitance of 22.2 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 and only a slight capacitance decay (<10%) after 5000 charge–discharge cycles, benefitting from the excellent stability of NiCo hydroxides. Additionally, the asymmetric TFS with a potential window of 1.2 V was assembled by utilizing the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 electrode as a positive electrode and the Ag NW/graphene composite electrode as a negative electrode.35 The device exhibited excellent electrochemical performances compared with the others using metallic networks as the current collectors.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the Ag NWs
Ag NWs with a high aspect ratio were prepared by a hydrothermal method as previously reported.35–37 First, 3 mmol silver nitrate, 4 mmol glucose and 0.6 mmol ferric sulfate were, respectively, fully dissolved in 20, 40 and 40 mL deionized water. After that, the above silver nitrate solution was dripped into the glucose solution, followed by the introduction of the ferric sulfate solution into the mixture. Then 4.5 g poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, K30) was completely dissolved in the above solution. Finally, 40 mL of the resultant solution was transferred to a 100 mL autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, gray–green Ag NWs were collected by centrifugation.
2.2 Preparation of the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 core–shell nanostructure
The fabrication process of the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 core–shell nanostructure is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, a PVA thin film with a solution concentration of 0.005 g mL−1 was deposited onto a clean PET substrate via a spin-coating method. The Ag NW dispersion in ethanol was then dropped on the surface of the PVA film with a controlled thickness of ∼10 μm to construct Ag NW percolation networks by another spin-coating process. The optical transmittance spectra of the blank PET before and after depositing the PVA layer are displayed in Fig. S1,† revealing that the transparent PVA layer has no obvious impact on the film transmittance. Subsequently, the film was laminated using a mechanical pressure of 25 MPa for 3 min to enhance the connections of the NWs and consequently improve the network conductivity.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the fabrication process of the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 electrode. 
The Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 core–shell nanostructure was prepared by the electrodeposition method. The freshly prepared 0.1 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M cobalt acetate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) solutions were used as the sources of Co and Ni. The concentration ratios of Ni to Co were controlled at 1:0, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, 0.25:0.75 and 0:1, of which the products were denoted as Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3, Sample 4 and Sample 5, respectively. The counter and reference electrodes for the electrodeposition were graphene rods and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Electrodeposition was conducted at a constant potential of −0.9 V (vs. SCE) for 5 min. The transmittance spectra of the electrode with different deposition times are presented in Fig. S2,† indicating that the transmittance gradually decreased with the extended deposition time due to the increase of the active material loading. Considering the transparency and electrochemical performance of the electrode, 5 min is consequently used as an optimized deposition time. The deposited electrodes were repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol, and ultimately dried at 50 °C.
2.3 Fabrication of a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device
To assemble an ASC device, a flexible and transparent Ag NW/graphene composite film studied in our previous research was used as the anode,35 while the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 film was applied as the cathode. Furthermore, the PVA/LiClO4/KOH gel was prepared as the polymer electrolyte according to the following procedure: 2 g PVA powder was dissolved and stirred in 20 mL deionized water at 85 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, 0.01 mol KOH and 0.01 mol LiClO4 were added to the PVA solution with stirring for 30 min. The electrode was cut into a rectangle with an area of 1 × 2 cm2 and a copper conductive tape was stuck to one side of the electrode. The electrolyte was dropped onto the surface of the anode and cathode, and then two electrodes were gently assembled to obtain a sandwich-structured supercapacitor. The device was then treated at 50 °C for 4 h until the electrolyte gel layer became colorless to obtain a flexible and transparent ASC.
2.4 Structure and morphology characterization
The phase compositions of the films were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X'pert Pro MFD, Panalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns were recorded on an ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo Scientific, USA) instrument using monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284.6 eV. The surface morphologies of the electrodes and the corresponding mapping analyses were obtained from a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Sigma 500, Germany). The microstructures and elemental mapping images of the composite nanowires were obtained with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL2100F, Japan). The transmittances of the films and devices were measured from a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan).
2.5 Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical performances of the electrodes and devices were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, CH Instruments Inc., China). A two-electrode system was applied to characterize the performance of the devices, while a three-electrode configuration was used to test a single electrode.
The areal capacitance (Ca) of the electrodes based on CV curves was calculated according to eqn (1):38 (1)
The areal capacitances of the electrodes and the devices based on GCD curves were calculated by eqn (2) and (3), respectively:38 (2) (3)
The specific capacitance (Cs) was calculated based on the mass and areal capacitance (Ca) values according to eqn (4):38 (4)where s (cm2) is the area of the electrode, v (V s−1) is the potential scan rate, ΔV (V) represents the potential window, Δt (s) refers to the discharge time, I (A) is the discharge current, and m (g cm−2) corresponds to the loading mass per unit area.
The energy density (E) and power density (P) of the devices were evaluated using the following eqn (5) and (6), respectively:39 (5) (6)where Ccell (F g−1) represents the specific capacitance of the device, ΔV (V) refers to the potential window, E (W h kg−1) and P (kW kg−1) are the energy density and power density, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The overall fabrication process for the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 core–shell nanostructure is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1. It is worth noting that a PVA layer between the substrate and the Ag NW conductive network is beneficial for improving the network adhesion and electrode stability. Fig. S3† displays the cycling stability of the electrodes with and without the PVA layer. The electrode without the PVA layer is unable to run after 1200 cycles; however, it maintains a high capacitance retention of 97.6% after 5000 cycles with the PVA layer. The improved stability is contributed by the increased adhesion of the Ag NWs to the substrate and decreased exfoliation of the active materials during the charge–discharge process.37

Fig. 2a shows a typical SEM image of the Ag NW film, indicating that the diameter of the prepared Ag NWs ranges from 80 to 150 nm. The deformation of the NWs caused by the mechanical press can be clearly observed as marked using red dashed circles. This reveals close contacts of the NWs, which could decrease the resistance of electron transport among the NWs.37 To investigate the synergistic effects of Ni and Co elements, we applied different Ni to Co ratios during the electrodeposition process. The microstructures and the corresponding elemental distributions of five samples are presented in Fig. 2b–f. The surfaces of the Ag NWs are uniformly covered by the active materials, and the average diameter of the NWs increased to approximately 500 nm. Moreover, the ratio of Ni to Co has a crucial influence on the surface morphology of the NWs. As the amount of Co increased, the one-dimensional structure became looser. The active materials were not only deposited onto the NW surfaces but also partially collapsed on the PET substrate for Sample 5 without the addition of Ni, as seen in Fig. 2f. Therefore, the stable surface structure can be achieved by regulating the ratio of Ni to Co.

XRD was conducted to elucidate the crystalline nature of the deposited materials. As shown in Fig. 3a, the diffraction peaks of 2θ located at 38.07°, 44.30°, 77.42° and 81.54° in the patterns of five samples match well with the (111), (200), (311) and (222) reflections of metallic Ag (JCPDS no. 04-0783). In Samples 3, 4 and 5, there are three diffraction peaks at 44.48°, 51.86° and 76.37°, which can be identified as the (111), (200) and (220) reflections of metallic Co (JCPDS no. 05-0727). As the amount of Ni increased, the peaks corresponding to metallic Ni (JCPDS no. 65-2865) are observed in the patterns of Samples 1, 2 and 3. It can be inferred that Ni and Co elements existing on the surface of Ag NWs are mainly in metallic states.

The XPS measurement was conducted to probe the surface chemical compositions and valence states of the deposited materials. Fig. 3b shows the XPS spectra of Samples 1, 3 and 5, revealing the presence of Ag and Ni elements in Sample 1, Ag, Ni and Co elements in Sample 3, and Ag and Co elements in Sample 5, in addition to the C and O elements. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p, Ni 2p and O 1s for Sample 3 are displayed in Fig. 3c–e. The bands of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 accompanied with satellite peaks in Fig. 3c can be de-convoluted into multiple peaks, which centered at 780.36, 781.96, 796.12, and 797.90 eV, respectively, resulting from the existence of Co2+.34,40 Two peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 at 855.2 and 872.8 eV, and two shake-up satellite peaks at 861.3 and 879.6 eV reveal the characteristic of Ni2+, as illustrated in Fig. 3d.41 In addition, the spectrum of O 1s can be de-convoluted into two peaks at 531.07 and 531.77 eV (Fig. 3e), confirming that the O element comes from metal hydroxyl and the PET substrate, respectively.40 The XPS analysis indicates the co-existence of NiCo hydroxides on the surface of the one-dimensional nanostructure.
It seemed confusing that XRD patterns suggested the generation of metallic Ni and Co, while XPS spectra revealed the formation of NiCo hydroxides. This could be attributed to the different detection depths of XRD and XPS, i.e., dozens of micrometers and several nanometers, respectively. Therefore, it could be assumed that the metallic Ni and Co grow on the Ag NW surface, and the outer layer of the composite nanowires consisted of NiCo hydroxides. These results disclosed that the one-dimensional nanostructure was Ag NW@NiCo modified by NiCo(OH)2, as illustrated in Fig. 3f.
The composition and microstructure of the core–shell nanostructure were further confirmed using TEM, taking Sample 3 as an example. As shown in Fig. 3g, the Co and Ni elements are homogeneously distributed throughout the surface of the Ag NW. The diameter of the core structure with a dark color is 119 nm, and the thickness of the shell structure with a light color is 204 nm. Fig. 3h displays a high-resolution TEM image of the area marked in Fig. 3g, and the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern inserted in Fig. 3h suggests the polycrystalline structure of the shell. Fig. 3i and j, respectively, correspond to the enlarged image of green and yellow dashed cubes. The lattice fringe spacing in the internal area is calculated as 0.20 nm, which can be indexed to the (111) reflection of metallic Ni (d = 0.2035 nm) and the (002) plane of metallic Co (d = 0.2023 nm), implying that the layers bonded to the Ag NWs are composed of crystalline Ni and Co.42 Correspondingly, the lattice fringe spacing in the external area is evaluated to be 0.23 nm, which is identified as the (011) reflection of Ni(OH)2 (d = 0.2339 nm) and (102) plane of Co(OH)2 (d = 0.2364 nm), revealing that the nanostructure in the outer area of the NWs is the NiCo hydroxide.42 Thus, it is further confirmed that the core–shell nanostructure is Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2.
The transparency of the composite electrodes was also investigated. Fig. 4a depicts the optical transmittance spectra of the electrodes with different ratios of Ni to Co. The transmittance of 79.49% at 550 nm for the Ag NW film is provided for comparison. It is evident that the transmittance of the deposited film decreases from 63.39% to 45.89% with the amount of Co increasing. It is mainly attributed to the enlargement of the NW diameter and collapse of the loose structure. The electrode maintains high transmittance and good flexibility after electrodeposition of Ni and Co (Fig. 4b and c). Fig. 4d presents the optical photographs of the Ag NW film and Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 films with letters clearly seen underneath the films.

To investigate the synergistic effects of Ni and Co elements, the electrochemical performances of the electrodes with different ratios of Ni to Co were elaborately characterized. Fig. 5a displays the CV curves of five samples at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a potential window of −0.1 to 0.6 V. All electrodes show distinct faradaic redox peaks around 0.1 V and 0.3 V, indicating that the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes is mainly caused by the reversible valence state changes between Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+.34,41 The CV curve of Sample 1 without Co addition has another oxidation peak at 0.5 V but there is no corresponding reduction peak, revealing that the irreversible reaction occurs during the reaction process. Additionally, the CV curves of the Samples 2, 3 and 4 display two reduction peaks at around 0.1 and 0.13 V, demonstrating the electrochemical characteristics of Co and Ni hydroxides.43 Among all samples, the peak intensity of Sample 3 with a Ni–Co ratio of 0.5:0.5 is the highest, suggesting the largest electrochemical activity due to the synergistic effects between the transition metal components.40 To ascertain the transformation of the NiCo alloy layer during the charge–discharge process, the XRD pattern of Sample 3 after 5000 cycles is provided in Fig. S4,† presenting that the peaks of metallic Ni and Co were displaced by those of NiCo hydroxides. Therefore, the metallic Ni and Co convert into hydroxides in an alkaline environment, which contribute to the improved electrochemical performance. The GCD curves of five samples are depicted in Fig. 5b. All the electrodes possess large charge–discharge platforms, confirming that the energy storage is dominated by the redox reactions of NiCo(OH)2.44 The GCD curve of Sample 3 shows the longest charging and discharging time, demonstrating the best electrochemical properties. Fig. 5c illustrates the areal capacitances of the composite films calculated from the GCD curves at 0.1 mA cm−2 as a function of Ni content. With the increase of Ni content, the areal capacitance initially increases from 20.2 mF cm−2 to maximum 22.2 mF cm−2, and then decreases to 16.6 mF cm−2.

(f) SEM images (from left to right: Samples 1 to 5) with a high resolution for five samples before and after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. 
To understand the diffusion effect on the electrochemical performances of the electrodes, the EIS spectra of the electrodes were recorded in a frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz (Fig. 5d). All impedance spectra consist of two parts with a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight slope in the low frequency region.45 An equivalent circuit of the electrochemical system in the inset was used to analyze the charge-transfer resistance.40,46 The internal resistance (Rs) values of the five samples are 8.0, 6.3, 6.7, 6.7, and 10.5 Ω, while the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values are 19.3, 15.9, 10.1, 12.2, and 28.6 Ω, respectively. The excellent conductivity of the electrodes is mainly attributed to the core–shell nanostructure with fast charge transfer, as well as the NiCo metallic layer with a low interface resistance. Additionally, the electrodes with Ni and Co co-doping exhibit higher electrical conductivity to boost the reactions with the electrolyte than those with Ni or Co single-doping due to the synergistic effect. Furthermore, the slopes of the EIS plots of Samples 2, 3 and 4 are close to perpendicular, which are greater than those of Samples 1 and 5, revealing an ideal capacitive behavior and good ionic conductivity by co-doping Ni and Co. Fig. 5e shows the cycling stabilities of the composite electrodes measured by repeating the CV process between −0.1 and 0.6 V at 100 mV s−1 for 5000 cycles. It is worth noting that Samples 2, 3 and 4 exhibit ultrahigh electrochemical durability with areal capacitance retentions of 88.9%, 91.9% and 97.6% after 5000 cycles, which are markedly larger than the 53.2% of Sample 1 and the 70.7% of Sample 5. The improved electrochemical stability of the electrodes not only lies on the synergistic effect of NiCo hydroxides, but also is attributed to the stable structure of the core–shell Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2.
In order to explore the relationship between structure variation and electrochemical stability of the electrodes during the charge–discharge process, the SEM images with a high resolution of five samples before and after 1000 charge–discharge cycles were taken as shown in Fig. 5f. After 1000 electrochemical cycles, the deposited materials formed compact layers on the Ag NW surfaces. Owing to the existence of the NiCo alloy layer, the expansion and collapse of NiCo hydroxides were not obviously observed after 1000 cycles. The Ag NWs could also be perfectly protected from the air and electrolyte to maintain high electron transport of the NW network. In addition, Samples 2, 3 and 4 maintained the original morphologies to a large extent, revealing more stable structures than Samples 1 and 5. The compact and stable core–shell structures during the charge–discharge process effectively guarantee the electrochemical stability of the electrodes. Moreover, the transmittance spectra were recorded while the electrode was charging and discharging. As shown in Fig. S5,† the transmittance of Sample 2 decreased from 42.92% to 41.83% during the charging process, while it increased to 42.91% after discharging. The result indicates that the transmittance remained stable during charging and discharging processes. It should be mentioned that the transmittance data here included the contributions from the quartz reactor (with a transmittance of about 80%). The optical transmittance spectra of Sample 2 after 100, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 charge–discharge cycles are also displayed in Fig. S6.† The transmittance of the electrode at 550 nm was decreased from 60.74% to 50.72% after 3000 cycles, and then slightly increased to 53.50%. The transmittance was close to a saturated value after 1000 cycles, which was due to the fact that the alloyed NiCo layer had completely transformed into hydroxides in an alkaline environment, and the expansion and collapse of NiCo hydroxides tended to stabilization, supporting a stable core–shell structure. The results also agree well with the analysis of XRD and SEM.
Furthermore, the CV curves at various scan rates and GCD curves at various current densities of five samples are presented in Fig. S7.† The CV curves exhibit good reversibility at a scan rate ranging from 5 to 80 mV s−1, and the anodic and cathodic peaks shift slightly to higher and lower potentials with the scan rate increasing. This might be due to the faster movement speeds of the OH− at a higher scan rate, resulting in the occurrence of a fast redox reaction.47 The GCD curves of five samples display a similar change tendency with the current density ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mA cm−2. The flexibility of the electrode was also investigated (Fig. S8†). The similar CV curve profiles of the electrode with bending angles of 0, 30°, 60° and 90° indicate that the structural integrity of the electrode is not destroyed after large bending, and the areal capacitance of the electrode with various bent states still maintains a relatively constant value, demonstrating promising applications in flexible energy storage devices.
From above discussions, it can be concluded that the high electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of co-doping Ni and Co, effective charge transfer of the core–shell structure, and the compact and stable structure obtained via appropriately designing the Ni–Co ratio. Specifically, in view of the transmittance and electrochemical performance of each sample, Sample 3 with a Ni–Co ratio of 0.5:0.5 is an optimum cathode for the ASC device. The previously reported Ag NW/graphene film was used as the anode.35 The perfect capacitance matching between the cathode and anode is confirmed according to the three-electrode test results in a mixed PVA gel of 1.0 M LiClO4 and 1.0 M KOH solution, as presented in Fig. 6a. The inset displays a schematic illustration of the ASC structure. The transmittance spectra of the Ag NW film, two composite electrodes and the resultant device are depicted in Fig. 6b. At a wavelength of 550 nm, the transmittance of the Ag NW film decreases from 79.49% to 60.33% and 50.73% after combining with NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 and graphene. The assembled supercapacitor exhibits a further decreased transmittance of 36.2% due to the usage of two composite electrodes and electrolytes. Fig. 6c shows the CV curves obtained in different potential windows at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The fabricated ASC device can be stable up to an operation voltage window of 1.2 V. Fig. 6d displays the GCD curves of the supercapacitor at various current densities ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mA cm−2, confirming good triangle shapes with a small IR drop. The CV curves of the device collected at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 80 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. S9,† which indicate quasi-rectangular shapes without obvious redox peaks. The absence of the redox peaks is mainly due to the fact that the charge–discharge process is conducted at a pseudo-constant rate.38 This can also be confirmed by the nearly symmetric and linear GCD curves (Fig. 6d). Fig. S10† shows the EIS spectra of the ASC recorded using a two-electrode mode in a frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz, suggesting excellent charge transfer and ion diffusion.

Comparison with the adapted data originally published in the most recent studies is also shown.29,47–50 
The plots of the current density against the areal capacitance and capacitance retention of the device obtained from the GCD curves are presented in Fig. 6e. The ASC device achieved a maximum areal capacitance of 9.6 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2, which then decreased to 1.19 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2, demonstrating the outstanding rate capability. Fig. 6f illustrates the comparison of the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 electrode with the ones using metallic networks as the current collectors in the TFSs, which have been reported in the literature.29,48–51 Notably, the areal capacitance of the device based on the Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 electrode is much higher than the values obtained from the recent reports for the TFSs based on the electrodes for Au wires@MnO2, Ag NWs/PEDOT:PSS, Ag/Au/PPy, Ag/Ni NWs and Ag/Au NWs.29,48–51 The relationship of the energy and power density for the assembled device is shown in Fig. S11,† which is calculated from the GCD curves. The maximum energy density can reach 3.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2.6 W kg−1. A series connection of four devices is used to light up a red light-emitting diode (LED) (the inset in Fig. S11†), suggesting their potential applications as a micropower source.
4. Conclusions
In summary, an Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 electrode was obtained by electrochemical deposition. The photoelectric and electrochemical performances of the electrode can be optimized by adjusting the ratio of Ni to Co. The best electrochemical performance of the electrode with a transmittance of 54.3% at 550 nm can be achieved when the ratio of Ni to Co is 0.5:0.5. Its areal capacitance reached a maximum of 22.2 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. The corresponding areal capacitance retention rate is 91.9% at 100 mV s−1 after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled with Ag NW/graphene as the anode electrode and Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 as the cathode electrode. A high areal capacitance of 9.6 mF cm−2 was achieved, and the potential window could be as large as 1.2 V. The energy density of the supercapacitor is 3.0 W h kg−1 with a power density of 2.6 W kg−1. The results gave sufficient evidence to confirm that the fabricated Ag NW@NiCo/NiCo(OH)2 electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performances and it showed potential for application in flexible and transparent energy storage devices.
