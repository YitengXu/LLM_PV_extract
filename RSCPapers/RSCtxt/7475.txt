    , Accepted 31st October 2022First published on 4th November 2022AbstractSubhani et al. found that Sm-doping in CsPbIBr2 decreased its bandgap from 2.05 eV to 1.8 eV; thus, the efficiency of CsPbIBr2 solar cells was improved by ∼30%. However, Sm is a vital strategic resource with high costs. Metal Sn is much more abundant and cheaper than Sm; meanwhile, it has been proven that Sn can adjust the bandgap of CsPbIBr2 in a broader range, 2.05 eV to 1.64 eV. Therefore, Sn-doping in CsPbIBr2 may improve the efficiency of CsPbIBr2 solar cells, even to a greater extent. In this work, we established the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface model by gradient Sn-doping in CsPbIBr2 and investigated the impacts of such gradient doping on the carrier separation behaviors at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface from the aspects of the cross-interface electric field, bandgap, and band matching, based on first-principles calculations. It is found that gradient Sn-doping can transfer more electrons from TiO2 to perovskites, thus creating an enhanced cross-interface electric field conducive to the separation of carriers at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface. Affected by the existence of the interface, the bandgap of each perovskite layer gradually increases as it moves away from the interface; in addition, due to the gradient Sn-doping, the steps between the bandgaps of adjacent perovskite layers become smaller and more uniform, which is favorable for the separation of electrons. In summary, gradient Sn-doping can improve the carrier separation at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface.
1. Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made outstanding achievements.2–4 The highest certified photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 25.7%.5 However, the commercial development of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs is severely limited by their instability.6–9 All-inorganic cesium-based perovskite materials show much better stability than organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.10 Meanwhile, their bandgaps ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 eV11,12 are also very suitable for fabricating solar cells. Therefore, all-inorganic cesium-based PSCs have been widely studied during these years.13–17
The most commonly used cesium-based perovskites are CsPbIxBr3−x. Of them, CsPbI3 has the most suitable bandgap of ∼1.73 eV, and the PCE of CsPbI3-based PSCs has reached 19.03%.13 But CsPbI3 will undergo a phase transition at room temperature and thus is unstable.14 CsPbI2Br is unstable under air conditions.15,16 CsPbBr3 shows desirable stability but has a large bandgap of ∼2.3 eV, limiting its light absorption in the visible region. Only CsPbIBr2 combines stability with an appropriate bandgap of ∼2.05 eV and thus is most suitable for fabricating solar cells.
However, the PCE of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs is not as high as expected.17 The main reasons limiting the PCE of PSCs based on CsPbIBr2 include its large bandgap, the mismatch between its band structure and that of the electron transport layer (ETL), and plenty of defects at the ETL/perovskite interface. Many general methods could tune the electronic properties of materials, e.g., by introducing defects18 or heteroatom-doping.19 Subhani et al. have used SmBr3 to modify the interface of TiO2/perovskite.1 They found that Sm-doping could passivate the interface and improve the crystallization of the perovskite layer. Meanwhile, based on first-principles calculations, they discovered that Sm-doping could reduce the bandgap of CsPbIBr2, thus expanding the light absorption range. As a result, the PCE of Sm-doped CsPbIBr2 PSCs reached 10.88% under one sun illumination.
In first-principles calculations in Subhani et al.'s report, Sm is distributed uniformly in CsPbIBr2;1 however, as evidenced by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, Sm should form a gradient doping within CsPbIBr2. Such gradient doping may bring additional effects, such as introducing a gradient energy bandgap and an extra built-in electric field which can help inhibit the non-radiative recombination. It is of great significance in exploring the improvement mechanism of gradient doping on the performance of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs.20
Metal Sn is a much more abundant element on earth, thus much cheaper than Sm. In recent years, Sn-doping has also been widely used in improving the performance of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs.21–23 It has been found that Sn-doping can also narrow the bandgap of CsPbIBr2, improving the morphology of the perovskite layer and reducing the interface defects. However, no matter in the experimental or the first-principles calculation research, the effect of the “gradient” Sn-doping on the carrier separation behaviors at the TiO2/perovskite interface was not considered in detail.
This work investigated the cross-interface electric field, bandgap, and bands matching at the TiO2/gradient Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 interface based on first-principles calculations. It is found that gradient Sn-doping could transfer more electrons from TiO2 to perovskites, thus creating an enhanced cross-interface electric field conducive to the separation of carriers. Meanwhile, the band energy structures of CsPbIBr2 at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface will be affected by both the existence of the interface and the gradient Sn-doping, and the gradient Sn-doping will bring minor and more uniform energy steps in the conductive band energy levels between adjacent CsPbIBr2 layers, which is favorable for the separation of electrons.
2. Computational details
The cubic phase CsPbIBr2 and rutile phase TiO2 with experimental lattice parameters were used in building the interface model. According to the recent report,1 the CsPbIBr2(001) plane can contact the TiO2(110) plane. So next, we built the models of CsPbIBr2(001) and TiO2 (11) slabs. The Sn-doping strategy must be determined first in building the CsPbIBr2 (001) slab. The experimental results show that doping atoms are only incorporated into the perovskite lattice to a small extent by gradient diffusion.1 Therefore, we assume that Sn atoms only replace Pb atoms in 4 layers near the interface, and 14 Sn atoms substitute 14 Pb. From the upper layer of CsPbIBr2 to the bottom layer, the proportions of Pb atoms replaced by Sn are 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100%, respectively.
The TiO2/non-doped CsPbIBr2 and TiO2/gradient Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 models are illustrated in Fig. 1(a and b), respectively. For a stable heterojunction, the lattice mismatches should be less than 5%. Therefore, the CsPbIBr2 (001) and TiO2 (110) faces should be large enough. The stoichiometry of the perovskite is Cs32Pb18Sn14I32Br64, and the surface lattice constants of the optimized CsPbIBr2 and TiO2 are given in Table 1. The lattice mismatches in the (u, v) directions for the non-doped and gradient Sn-doped cases were (−2.50%, −2.52%) and (−2.93%, −2.89%), respectively. In addition, a vacuum layer of ∼10 Å along the non-periodic direction is added. The model used is large enough to explore the electronic properties of the interface.23

After the interface models were established, geometry optimization (GO) and electronic property calculations were carried out. In the calculations, the outermost surface and subsurface atomic layers at the top and the bottom were fixed, and the other layers were allowed to relax. All the calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) software.24 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was used to express the exchange-correlation energy functional.25,26 As there are heavy elements in our system, the spin–orbital coupling should have a great effect on electronic properties such as the energy band and formation energy;27 therefore, the SOC effect was considered. To describe the strong electron correlation effect, the Hubbard U correction was used, and the value of U for Ti-3d was set to 3 eV, which has been carefully tested.28
The plane wave cut-off energy was set to be 500 eV with a 1 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for optimization until the residual stress of each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1, and the total energy convergence criterion was 10−5. A 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh was used for the calculation of electronic properties.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural stability of the interfaces
The optimized surface lattice constants, u and v, of the CsPbIBr2(001) face with non-doping and gradient Sn-doping are listed in Table 1. They match well with the surface lattice constants of TiO2(110), which ensures that the perovskite slab can form a stable heterojunction with the TiO2 slab. The bond lengths and the binding energies between the CsPbIBr2 and TiO2 slabs were calculated after GO, as shown in Table 1. The shorter Sn–O bonds compared with Pb–O bonds can be attributed to the smaller size of Sn atoms. The binding energy, Ebind, is defined as follows:Ebind = Etotal − Eperovskite − ETiO2where Etotal is the total energy of the interface and Eperovskite and ETiO2 are the energies of the perovskite and the TiO2 slab (with the same configuration as they are in the interface), respectively. It can be seen that these two models are stable, but the TiO2/non-doped CsPbIBr2 interface is slightly more stable than the TiO2/gradient Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 interface.
3.2 Enhanced cross-interface electric field
Sn-doping will result in differences in the interfacial charge displacement, thus different cross-interface electric fields. The cross-interface electric field will, in turn, affect the separation of carriers at the interface. The charge density differences (CDDs) of the TiO2/non-doped CsPbIBr2 and TiO2/gradient Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 interfaces are shown in the left side of Fig. 2(a and b). The isosurface is set as 0.0095 bohr−3, and the electron accumulation and depletion regions are represented in red and green, respectively. The CDD images show that the electron will be accumulated on the perovskite side while it will be depleted on the TiO2 side; therefore, an additional electric field from TiO2 to the perovskite layer will be formed. Such a cross-interface electric field will be helpful for the separation of carriers at the interface.

From the CDD images, we can also observe the different interfacial charge displacements. For the non-doped case (Fig. 2a), the neatest Pb–O bonds will be formed, which indicates that the interfacial charge displacement is the most uniform across the interface. However, in the cases of gradient Sn-doping (Fig. 2b), the interfacial charge displacement becomes complicated, as the chemical environment for the Sn atoms at the interface is not identical due to the atomic adjustment caused by Sn-doping. About half of the Sn atoms formed Sn–O bonds with the O atoms, which mainly contribute to the interfacial charge displacement.
To quantify the extent of charge displacement across the TiO2/perovskite interface, we have plotted the charge displacement curves (CDCs) in the right side of Fig. 2(a and b).29,30 The CDC contains two curves, Δq and ΔQ,    where ρ is the charge density difference, x and y are the directions parallel to the interface, and z is vertical to the interface.31 Δq indicates the deviation between the charge distribution of the interface and the respective parts (i.e., the TiO2 and perovskite surface), caused by the charge transfer due to the formation of the interface, where the integration in the x and y directions means that only the distribution of the deviation in the z direction (perpendicular to the interface) is considered. ΔQ stands for the value of the integral of Δq in the z direction, which reflects the accumulation of charges along the z direction.
For both the interface models, the Δq curves have large fluctuations near the interface, which indicates a significant charge transfer at the interface. It can be seen obviously that the electrons are extracted from TiO2 and accumulated on the perovskite side. Therefore, a built-in electric field is formed from the TiO2 layer to the perovskite layer.
In the case of gradient Sn-doping, the fluctuations of Δq near the interface are much more significant, which means that the extent of charge displacement across the TiO2/perovskite interface is enhanced. Meanwhile, with gradient Sn-doping, the values of ΔQ deviate from 0 significantly in regions away from the interface, indicating an intense interface polarization. These two phenomena corroborate, confirming the enhancement of the cross-interface electric field by gradient Sn-doping, which is more conducive to the separation of carriers.32
3.3 Optimized bandgap and band matching
The effects of Sn-doping on the carrier separation at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interfaces can be analyzed in more detail based on the density of states (DOS). Fig. 3 shows the DOS of the interfaces and each perovskite layer for both the non-doped and gradient Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 cases. It can be first observed that the existence of the interface affects the band structures of the perovskite layer. The influence range and extent of the interface can be seen from the DOS of each perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The identifiers 1–4 correspond to those in Fig. 1: layer 4 is the layer closest to the interface. It can be observed that the perovskite layer closest to the interface (layer 4) is more susceptible than other layers. The conductive band energy level of the perovskite layer gradually increases as it moves away from the interface, as does the valence band energy level. However, the increase in the valence band energy level is smaller. As a result, the bandgap of the perovskite layer gradually increases as it moves away from the interface, as shown in Fig. 4. The DOS figures of the 1st and 2nd layers tend to be stable, representing the bulk perovskite. In the non-doped case, the bandgaps of the 1 and 2 layers are both 2.05 eV, which is consistent with that of the bulk CsPbIBr2, 2.05 eV.

 Fig. 4  Bandgaps of each perovskite layer in the interface model and the bulk CsPb1−xSnxIBr2. 
Next, we discussed the effect of gradient Sn-doping on the bandgap, the continuity of energy levels, and the resulting electron–hole separation, by comparing the DOS maps of each layer in the case of gradient doping and non-doping. Although the bandgap of the perovskite layer widens from near to far from the interface for both the non-doping and gradient Sn-doping cases, the widening speed and the final value of the bandgap are different in the two cases. At first, in the gradient Sn-doping case, the bandgap of layer 1 is only 1.78 eV, which is significantly smaller than the value of the non-doping case, 2.05 eV, proving that Sn-doping indeed leads to a smaller bandgap.
In addition, in the case of non-doping and gradient Sn-doping, the bandgaps of the perovskite layers 4–1 are 1.45, 1.82, 2.05, and 2.05 eV and 1.40, 1.50, 1.68 and 1.78 eV, respectively. To provide a criterion for the effect of Sn-doping on the bandgap of CsPbIBr2, we have calculated the bandgaps of the bulk CsPb1−xSnxIBr2. The obtained bandgaps of the bulk CsSnIBr2, CsPb0.5Sn0.5IBr2, CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2, and CsPbIBr2 are 1.25, 1.51, 1.74, and 2.05 eV, respectively. To be more intuitive, we have drawn the bandgaps of each perovskite layer in the interface model and the bulk CsPb1−xSnxIBr2 together as shown in Fig. 4. In the case of gradient Sn-doping, the bandgap of each perovskite layer is affected by both the interface and Sn-doping. But for layer 4, maybe because Sn-doping leads to an even smaller interface deformation than the non-doping case (which can be observed in Fig. 2), its bandgap is less affected by the interface. Comprehensively, the bandgap steps between the perovskite layers are smaller and more uniform in the case of gradient Sn-doping.
In both gradient Sn-doping and non-doping cases, the interface effect and Sn-doping will affect the positions of the conduction band and valence band at the same time. In Fig. 5, we plotted the band structure at the interface for the two cases. It can be observed that the gradient Sn-doping will provide more uniform energy steps (the conduction band energy levels of layer 1 to layer 4 are 1.0, 0.9, 0.4, and −0.25 eV, respectively; while in the non-doping case, the values are 1.30, 1.30, 0.48, and −0.40 eV, respectively) for the movement of electrons toward TiO2. For the transfer of electrons from the perovskite side to the TiO2 side, in the gradient Sn-doped system, the driving potential, ∼0.13 eV, is also some larger than in the non-doped system, ∼0.05 eV, which is consistent with the stronger interfacial electric field mentioned above.
 Fig. 5  Band structure at the interface for the gradient Sn-doping and non-doping cases. 
This work mainly investigated the effect of the interface and Sn-doping on the band structures of the perovskite layers; therefore, only a few TiO2 layers were used, which had undergone large deformation, as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently, the obtained bandgap of TiO2 is very different from the experimental results. Besides, Sn-doping will introduce more pronounced defect levels at layer 4, as seen in Fig. 3. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that only half of the Sn atoms formed Sn–O bonds with the O atoms in the gradient Sn-doping case, as shown in Fig. 2b. Such additional defects require attention in fabricating Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 solar cells and further experimental investigations.
4. Conclusions
To investigate the impacts of gradient Sn-doping on the carrier separation behaviors at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface, we have calculated and analyzed the charge displacement and band structures at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface.
For both the TiO2/non-doped CsPbIBr2 and TiO2/gradient Sn-doped CsPbIBr2 interfaces, the electrons will be extracted from TiO2 and accumulated on the perovskite side, which means that a built-in electric field from TiO2 to perovskites is formed. Gradient Sn-doping will bring a larger electron transfer, thus an enhanced cross-interface electric field. Besides, by the impact of the interface, both the conductive and valence band energy levels of the perovskite layer gradually increase as it moves away from the interface; however, the magnitude of the increase in the valence band energy level is minor. Therefore, the bandgap of the perovskite layer gradually increases as it moves away from the interface. In addition, due to the influence of gradient Sn-doping, the steps between the bandgaps of adjacent perovskite layers become smaller and more uniform, and the steps between the conductive band energy levels, i.e., the channel for the extraction of the electron, of adjacent perovskite layers are also smaller and more uniform. In conclusion, from the aspects of the cross-interface electric field, bandgap, and band matching, gradient Sn-doping should be helpful for the electron separation at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface.
