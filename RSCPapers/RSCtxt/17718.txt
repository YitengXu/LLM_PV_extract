    , Accepted 7th September 2020First published on 7th September 2020AbstractLead halide perovskites with mixtures of monovalent cations have attracted wide attention due to the possibility of preferentially stabilizing the perovskite phase with respect to photovoltaically less suitable competing phases. Here, we present a theoretical analysis and interpretation of the phase stability of binary (CH6N3)x[HC(NH2)2](1−x)PbI3 = GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 and ternary CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures. We first estimate if such mixtures are stable and if they lead to a stabilization of the perovskite phase based on static Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In order to investigate the finite temperature stability of the phases, we also employ first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It turns out that in contrast to the FA+-rich case of FA/Cs mixtures, although mixing of FA/GUA is possible, it is not sufficient to stabilize the perovskite phase at room temperature. In contrast, stable ternary mixtures that contain 17% of Cs+ can be formed that lead to a preferential stabilization of the perovskite phase. In such a way, the enthalpic destabilization due to the introduction of a too large/too small cation that lies outside the Goldschmidt tolerance range can be (partially) compensated through the introduction of a third cation with complementary size. This allows to suggest a new design principle for the preparation of stable perovskite structures at room temperature with cations that lie outside the Goldschmidt range through mixtures with size-complementary cations in such a way that the effective average cation radius of the mixture lies within the stability range.
1 Introduction
Solar cells based on organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites1–7 are achieving nowadays power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25%.8 The unique properties of this kind of materials, including high absorption coefficients,9 small exciton binding energies,10 large charge-carrier diffusion lengths,11 low-trap densities12 and the low production costs when produced by low-temperature solution processes,13 make them commercially attractive for photovoltaic technologies. Nevertheless, in spite of their exceptional performance, perovskite solar cells still face some unresolved issues, one of them being their limited long-term stability.
Indeed, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), CsPbI3 and [HC(NH2)2]PbI3 (FAPbI3), the three most widely studied perovskite materials exhibit limited stability for different reasons. More specifically, MAPbI3 films, with a band gap of 1.5 eV,3 which is close to the single-junction optimum, (1.34 eV according to Shockley and Queisser's detailed balance considerations, for air mass coefficient (AM) 1.5 G illumination and T = 298.15 K),14,15 decompose rapidly at 423 K, due to the high volatility of MAI which is prone to be attacked by polar solvents, in particular water.7 The perovskite phase of FAPbI3, has a band gap that according to different experimental measurements lies within the range of 1.43–1.48 eV,7,16,17 which is even closer to the single-junction optimum, however at room temperature it adopts a non-perovksite hexagonal δ-phase (yellow phase) that is unsuitable for photovoltaic applications due to the large band gap.18 This δ-phase only undergoes a phase transition to a black perovskite α-phase at 333 K,18 but a metastable β-FAPbI3 phase (P3 trigonal space group) that FAPbI3 adopts at 150 K has also been reported.18 The γ-phase of the purely inorganic CsPbI3, on the other hand, has a band gap of 1.73 eV,19–22 which is close to the optimum top cell band gap for tandem solar cells of 1.7–1.8 eV.23 However, as in case of FAPbI3, it crystallizes in a non-perovskite insulating hexagonal δ-phase (yellow phase) at room temperature.18
Consequently, to overcome the problems of limited thermal, structural and phase stabilities, different strategies have been proposed. Indeed, it has been shown that mixing two different monovalent cations can result in a preferential stabilization of the perovskite phase at room temperature.24–26 Many of the devices that have achieved high PCEs include mixtures of monovalent cations.24,25,27 Pellet et al.,24 successfully added MAPbI3 in order to stabilize the perovskite phase of FAPbI3 at room temperature, however at higher temperatures the compound is prone to decomposition due to the presence of MA+. Additionally, Lee et al.,26 prepared mixtures of cesium and formamidinium with enhanced thermal and humidity stability achieving a PCE of 16.5% and in one of our previous works, we have shown that Cs0.2FA0.8PbI2.84Br0.16 solar cells yield a PCE of over 17% exhibiting excellent long term stability in ambient air.25 This design protocol of using mixed cations has been further extended. Saliba et al.,28 proposed that the incorporation of Cs+ into mixtures of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 results in an improved thermal stability achieving a PCE of 18%.
As a rule of thumb, ions that are within the range of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t29 (, where RA, RX and RB are the ionic radii, of the monovalent cation (A), anion (X) and divalent cation (B), respectively); (t ≈ 0.8–1.0), are potential candidates for forming a stable perovskite structure. In the case of lead/iodide systems, this allows for a selection of monovalent cations with radii that are roughly 164 to 259 pm.30 This rule has been extended by Kieslich et al.,31,32 to organic (molecular) cations assuming a rigid sphere model and full freedom for rotation around the center of mass leading to a set of effective ionic radii for mixtures of monovalent cations.27,33 CH6N3+ (guanidinium–GUA+) for example is an organic cation with a zero dipole moment and a Goldschmidt tolerance factor which is slightly above the upper limit for forming a stable lead iodide perovskite structure.31,34 Indeed, no perovskite phase formation has been reported so far for pure CH6N3PbI3 (GUAPbI3); a tetraiodide GUA2PbI4 is formed instead for which a continuous phase transition at 307 K takes place and a low-dimensional (1D) triiodide GUAPbI3 that undergoes two phase transitions at 255 and 432 K has also been reported.35,36
Following the design protocol of mixing two different monovalent cations in order to form a stable perovskite phase at room temperature, GUA+ has been mixed with MAPbI3.37,38 The devices based on this mixed GUAxMA(1−x)PbI3 solar cells resulted in an average PCE of 19.2% and enhanced stability, breaking in that way new ground in the exploration of cations with radii beyond the tolerance factor limit.38 Originally, it has been proposed that upon mixing, GUA+ is not directly incorporated into the perovskite structure but acts as a passivating agent,37 however, a later study demonstrated an increased micro-strain and distortions of the lattice upon GUA+ doping of MAPbI3 providing evidence for direct incorporation.38 This was further confirmed by recent solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements that supplied atomic-level evidence that GUA+ is directly incorporated into the MAPbI3 lattice.39
Nevertheless, in spite of the formation of stable room temperature perovskite phases in the case of MA/FA, FA+-rich FA/Cs and GUA/MA mixtures, GUA/FA mixtures follow another trend. Kubicki et al.,39 through solid-state NMR studies revealed that although black GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 is initially formed, it is thermodynamically unstable, turning yellow within hours after annealing. Furthermore, mixtures of guanidinium with cesium, in different stoichiometries, are adopting layered crystal structures (CsGUAPbI4, CsGUAPbBr4 and Cs2GUAPb2Br7) that are thermally stable and do not decompose up to 573 K.40 In addition to this, a 2D perovskite structure of a mixture of formamidinium and guanidinium (FAGUAPbI4), is thermally stable up to 528 K, exhibiting photoluminescence at room temperature and pronounced photoconductivity.41 In an attempt to stabilize GUA/FA mixtures in the perovskite phase, compositions of triple cation mixtures have been proposed.42,43 For instance FA0.33GUA0.19Cs0.47Pb(I0.66Br0.34)3 and FA0.58GUA0.10Cs0.32Pb(I0.73Br0.27)3 have been proposed as possible candidates for tandem multijunction devices, since they have band gaps of 1.84 eV and 1.75 eV, respectively.42 In addition, the incorporation of 2% of GUA+ into FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 resulted in an increase of the device efficiency from 14% to 17% under one sun illumination.43 Thermal stability tests performed in the same study, predicted an enhanced stability for 5% to 10% GUA+ doping. However, for concentrations higher than 20% of GUA+ doping, secondary δ-like phases are formed.43
In this work, through a theoretical analysis, we investigated the relative stability of binary GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures with GUA+ up to 50% and ternary CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures with Cs+ up to 17%. The relative stability of the mixtures with respect to the pure FAPbI3, GUAPbI3 and CsPbI3 phases was calculated by estimating the free energy of mixing. In addition to this, we estimated the phase stability of the mixtures by calculating the relative energetics between the different phases. Our approach differs from the one followed by Giorgi et al.,34 where the stability was calculated through the relative substitution energies suggesting that the binary GUA/FA mixtures are not stable with respect to demixing while our approach that takes the mixing entropy into account predicts stable mixtures. Furthermore, we also consider the δ-phase and we observe that there is a preferential stabilization of the δ-phase over the perovskite phase for the binary GUA/FA mixtures, in agreement with experimental studies that do not only show that δ-phase is more stable but also that the mixture is not demixing (in contrast to Giorgi et al., suggestions).39 For all mixed compounds the structural characteristics as well as the electronic properties have been determined.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Stability
DFT44,45 calculations using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)46 functional have been employed to determine the relative stability at 0 K of the perovskite over the non-perovskite phase for GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures with up to 50% of FA+ substituted by GUA+. In addition, we investigated triple cation mixtures CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 with 8% or 17% Cs+ when up to 50% of the FA+ cations in the FAPbI3 lattice were substituted by GUA+. The DFT-optimized structures of the pure compounds are shown in Fig. 1.

The small energy difference among various substitution pattern that is of the order of 0.005 eV for the β and 0.006 eV for the δ-phase, respectively, justifies the use of the analytical formula for ideal alloys for the estimation of the mixing entropy contribution to the free energy as given by eqn (1).47 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, N is the number of components and ci is the atomic fraction of component i. Eqn (1) leads to eqn (2) in case of the triple CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 cation mixture. TΔSphase(CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3) = −kBT[ylny + xlnx + (1 − y − x)ln(1 − x − y)](2)where y is the concentration of Cs+, and x is the concentration of GUA+ incorporated in the FAPbI3 structure. On the other hand, the relative energetics of the mixtures with respect to the pure FAPbI3, GUAPbI3 and CsPbI3 compounds is computed by eqn (3). In both eqn (2) and (3), the subscript phase corresponds to one of the two, β or δ phases. ΔEphase(CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3) = Ephase(CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3) − [yEphase(CsPbI3) + xEphase(CsPbI3) + (1 − y − x)Ephase(FAPbI3)].(3)
As one can see in Fig. 2 where the energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy of mixing are plotted as a function of x for the two phases, the replacement of FA+ with GUA+ cations leads to an energetic destabilization in the β-phase for all GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 compositions. However, the overall mixing free energies are essentially zero (certainly when considering the accuracy of the calculations and the variations due to different substitution pattern that are of the order of 0.005 eV). On the other hand, the δ-phase is energetically stabilized and the mixing entropy further favors the stabilization of the mixtures, leading overall to negative mixing free energies. These observations are in contrast to FA+-rich FA/Cs mixtures where mixing leads to a preferential stabilization of the perovskite phase and a distinct destabilization of the δ-phase.25

To estimate the relative stability of perovskite versus non-perovskite phases, the 0 K relative energetics per stoichiometric unit between the δ and the β phases are shown for binary GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures (Table 1). Mixing is affecting the relative stability of the two phases in the direction of further stabilization of the δ-phase.

We next investigated how the 0 K stabilities are changing at finite temperature, especially due to the inclusion of vibrational entropy. However, in the case of lead halide perovskites the calculation of such corrections is not trivial. Indeed, the initial calculations of harmonic and quasi-harmonic phonons led to imaginary modes.48 This contradiction seemed to be resolved in the case of double perovskites, by calculating the finite-temperature phonon-spectrum, including the anharmonic phonon–phonon interaction, showing that phonon entropy at finite temperatures plays a critical role in phonon spectrum renormalization.49,50 However it has been shown that for all-inorganic lead halide perovskites vibrational instabilities are present and are associated with octahedral tilting in the high-temperature and symmetry phase.51 Finding the actual minimum and using frozen phonon calculations, Marronnier et al.,52 abolished the soft modes at the Γ point of the highly symmetric high-temperature cubic phase of CsPbI3, however the remaining phonon instabilities at the M and R points at the edge of the Brillouin zone did not disappear.
Therefore, to assess the relative phase stability at finite temperature, we opted for another approach and performed instead MD simulations at 300 K for both β and δ GUA0.17FA0.83PbI3 phases. As shown in Fig. 3 where the potential energy for both the β and the δ phases is shown, we observe that at 300 K the mixture is more stable in the δ-phase. This is consistent with the observations from solid state NMR measurements, where although black mixed-cation GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 phases do form temporarily, they are thermodynamically unstable and become yellow within hours from annealing.39

In contrast to FA+-rich FA/Cs mixtures, where mixing leads to a stabilization of the perovskite phase at room temperature,25 we conclude that the addition of GUA+ into FAPbI3 does not lead to a sufficient stabilization of the perovskite phase and the δ-phase remains the thermodynamically most stable form. We also explored if this trend can be reversed through the addition of a third cation. In particular, we tested the hypothesis if the energetic penalties induced by substitution of a large cation such as GUA+ could possibly be balanced through addition of a small cation such as Cs+. For this reason, we probed the possible stabilization of the perovskite phase in ternary CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures, where we expect the permutational entropy to induce a further stabilization due to the addition of an additional species, helping to stabilize the mixtures over wider concentration ranges albeit not directly affecting the relative phase stability.

Fig. 4(a), shows that in the δ-phase, addition of 8% Cs+ to GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures with different GUA+ content leads to an energetic destabilization over all the GUA+ range, but for 17% of GUA+ where the calculated mixing energy is so small that the value is below the variations due to different substitution pattern that are of the order of 0.006 eV. However the energetic destabilization is compensated by the mixing entropy contribution. For the β-phase, on the other hand, mixing is energetically disfavorable for x > 0.17, and for lower GUA+ concentrations the mixing energy is below the variations due to different substitution pattern that are of the order of 0.005 eV for the β-phase. However, permutational entropy induces a further stabilization, leading to an overall negative mixing free energies for the β-phase. In contrast to the binary GUA/FA mixtures the stabilization in the perovskite phase is similar to the δ-phase counterpart and is thus not able to induce a reversal in the relative stability order. The trends are further enhanced by adding 17% Cs (Fig. 4(b)). For the δ-phase, mixing leads to an energetic destabilization that the mixing entropy contribution can no longer compensate, in the sense that the mixing free energy is essentially zero. In contrast, in the β-phase, mixing leads even to an energetic stabilization for the lower GUA+ concentration range (up to 17%) and adding the mixing entropy contributions leads to a free energy that has negative values for all β-Cs0.17GUAxFA(0.83−x)PbI3 mixtures. It is worth mentioning that the pronounced stability of the ternary CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures in the perovskite phase is consistent with recent experiments on GUA+ doping into FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3. According to these measurements, a remarkable enhanced thermal stability of the perovskite phase is observed for 5% and 10% GUA+ doping content. For higher concentrations than 20% GUA+ doping, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements show the formation of secondary δ-like phases, that due to lack of structural information have not been considered in this study.43

(a) The concentration of Cs+ is 8% (y = 0.08). (b) The concentration of Cs+ is 17% (y = 0.17). 
2.2 Structural characteristics
In FA+-rich FA/Cs mixtures,25 the preferred stabilization of the perovskite phase upon mixing has been rationalized in terms of the structural similarity or dissimilarity of the perovskite and the δ phases of the pure compounds, respectively. Here, we employed a similar analysis and traced the evolution of the volume per stoichiometric unit and average Pb–I–Pb angles upon mixing for different binary and ternary GUA/FA mixtures plotted in Fig. 5, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Volume evolution of GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures, when FA+ is substituted by GUA+ in the FAPbI3 lattice. 
As a function of x, the volume is increasing for the β-phase, while it is oscillating for the δ-phase, leading to an overall volume increase when 50% of FA+ is substituted by GUA+. The overall volume increase is consistent with the incorporation of a larger cation into the lattice. Especially, in the case of the non-perovskite phase, the crystal structure consists of edge-sharing octahedra that are surrounded by monovalent cations. For low GUA+ concentrations, the volume hardly changes due to the available space between the rods and expands to a new value when a critical concentration is reached. In the case of the perovskite phase on the other hand, the lattice expands isotropically. In Fig. 6, the DFT optimized structures of pure FAPbI3 and mixed GUA0.5FA0.5PbI3 in the β-phase are shown. Upon mixing, the space between Pb–I octahedra of the β-phase which is originally characteristic for an orthorhombic phase, tends towards a more cubic like behavior (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the trend of the volume evolution in the orthorhombic like phases, where the incorporation of a larger cation leads to an expansion of the lattice and an increased population at ∼0 tilting angle.53 This observation is also supported by the average Pb–I–Pb angles. Fig. 7 shows that for the β-phase, the average Pb–I–Pb angles tend to a more cubic like behavior with increasing GUA+ content. The projected density of states (PDOS) of several systems shown in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†) reveals that the valence band maximum (VBM) consists of an antibonding overlap between the I 5p and Pb 6s orbitals and the conduction and minimum (CBM) of an antibonding overlap between the Pb 6p and I 5s orbitals. We also observe that the character of the band edges is preserved for a wide range of different chemical and crystallographic variations.22,53 Because of the antibonding character of the VBM, the reduction of the lattice distortion leads to an increase of the antibonding overlap between the I p and Pb s orbitals which in turn leads to an energy increase (destabilization) of the mixed perovskite phases.

 Fig. 7  Average of Pb–I–Pb angle of β-GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures, when FA+ is substituted by GUA+ in the FAPbI3 lattice. 
For the ternary CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures, the volume evolution upon substitution of FA+ by Cs+ and GUA+ in the FAPbI3 lattice for both Cs+ concentrations also leads to an overall increase of the lattice volume, as shown in Fig. 8. This is consistent with the incorporation of a larger cation, however, it is important to note that the incorporation of both Cs+ and GUA+ cations counterbalances the overall volume increase to some degree, since the space required for the larger GUA+ is compensated by the smaller space required by Cs+. This seems to be only effective when the concentrations of GUA+ and Cs+ are in a similar range. For GUA+ concentrations that are higher than the ones of Cs+, the change of the volume as a function of concentration is dominated by the incorporation of the much larger GUA+.
 Fig. 8  Volume evolution of CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures for Cs+ concentrations of 8% and 17%. The volume evolution of the binary β-GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixture is replotted for the sake of comparison. 
The volume increase is accompanied by a widening of the average Pb–I–Pb angles, as shown in Fig. 9 proposing again that the substitution of FA+ by Cs+ and GUA+ leads to a more cubic-like structure at high GUA+ concentrations. However, in contrast to the binary GUA/FA mixtures, for a concentration range which is similar for both cations (low GUA+ concentration) the average Pb–I–Pb angle is lower for CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures, (this behavior is more pronounced for 17% of Cs+) indicating that the incorporation of a smaller cation such as Cs+ leads the system to adopt a more orthorhombic-like structure. In this case because of the antibonding character of the VBM, the increase of lattice distortion leads to a decrease of the antibonding overlap between the I p and Pb s orbitals which in turn leads to an energy decrease (stabilization) of the mixed perovskite phases.

2.3 Optical properties
Although the perovskite phase of some of the mixtures might only be metastable, it is of interest to understand how mixing affects the optical properties. The use of the hybrid functional PBE0 in combination with explicit spin orbit coupling (SOC) effects54 calculated for PBEsol optimized geometries,55 has been shown to be a successful protocol for an accurate description of the band gaps of halide perovskites.56,57 In addition, our benchmarks shown in Table S1 (ESI†), demonstrate that the above mentioned protocol is indeed superior for an accurate description of the band gaps compared to other schemes and functionals. The results using this protocol are summarized in Table 2. The band structures of a few systems are shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†).

The calculated band gap for pure FAPbI3 is in good agreement with the experimental results, that according to different experimental measurements lies within the range of 1.43–1.48 eV.7,16,17 In case of β-GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures, the band gap remains almost unaffected upon mixing and stays very close to the single-junction optimum. However, as shown above, mixtures in the β-phase are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the δ-phase, and thus of limited practical interest.
We also calculated the band gaps of the triple cation CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures. As can be seen in Table 3, as for the binary mixtures, the band gaps are close to the single-junction optimum and are essentially unaffected upon substitution of FA+ by GUA+ for both Cs+ concentrations considered. Given that for β-Cs0.17GUAxFA(0.83−x)PbI3 systems, mixing in the perovskite phase seems favorable for low GUA+ concentrations, these compounds could be potential candidates for efficient solar cell applications. Recent experiments on GUA+ doping into FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3, showed that the incorporation of less than 10% of GUA+ into FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 resulted in a band gap around 1.54 eV, which is suitable for single-junction solar cells and especially the incorporation of 2% of GUA+ resulted in an increase of device efficiency from 14% to 17% under one sun illumination.43 However, for concentrations of GUA+ higher than 20%, an additional absorption peak at ≈ 600 nm has been observed due to the formation of secondary δ phases.43 If under certain preparation condition CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures can be stabilized, their optical properties are very interesting and these materials should be further investigated as candidates for solar cell applications.

3 Conclusions
We have demonstrated that in contrast to FA+-rich FA/Cs mixtures,25 in binary GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 mixtures, the addition of GUA+ alone into FAPbI3 does not lead to a sufficient stabilization of the perovskite phase and on the contrary, a further stabilization of the δ-phase is observed. Consistently, MD simulations performed at room temperature revealed that the binary mixtures are more stable in the δ-phase, in agreement with experimental results.39 At difference to MA/FA, FA+-rich FA/Cs, and GUA/MA mixtures, mixing with one additional monovalent cation is not sufficient for stabilising the perovskite phase, for this reason we also examined the phase stability of triple cation CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures for both 8% and 17% of Cs+. It turns out that for 8% of Cs+, mixing is favorable in both β and δ phases. However, for 17% of Cs+, mixing only favors the perovskite phase, suggesting that the inclusion of a third cation into an unstable or metastable binary mixture could pave the way for materials that are thermodynamically stable in the perovskite phase at room temperature at least for a concentration range which is similar for both substituted cations.
Analyzing the resulting structural characteristics upon mixing (volume and average Pb–I–Pb angle evolution), we concluded that the inclusion of a larger cation leads to a volume increase and structures with cubic-like characteristics. However, in the case of ternary mixtures and for a concentration range which is similar for Cs+ and GUA+, the incorporation of Cs+ leads to a distortion of the lattice towards a more orthorhombic structure, which in turn lowers the antibonding overlap of the I p-orbitals with the s-orbitals of Pb of the VBM and thus leads to a lower energy and an overall stabilization. This observation allows us to propose a design principle for the preparation of stable mixed cation lead halide perovskites at room temperature according to which mixing monovalent cations that would be outside the stability range with cations that can compensate the size, so that the average radii of the mixed cations lies within the suitable Goldschmidt tolerance range can lead to ternary perovskite mixtures with enhanced stability.
Calculations of the band gaps showed that for both binary and ternary mixtures, the band gap remains unaffected upon mixing and close to the single-junction optimum. Taking into account the pronounced stabilization of the perovskite phase for mixtures with 17% of Cs+, solar cells based on these materials can constitute possible candidates for single-junction solar devices as also demonstrated in recent experiments.43
4 Computational details
DFT calculations44,45 have been performed using the Quantum Espresso suite of codes.58,59 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to DFT in the PBE46 formulation has been used for geometry and cell relaxations. The Kohn–Sham orbitals have been expanded in a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 40 Ry and a density cutoff of 240 Ry. The Brillouin zone has been sampled with a Monkhorst Pack k-points grid60 that varied from 2 × 2 × 2 points for the β-phase to 2 × 2 × 1 for the δ-phase, respectively. All these values have been chosen after performing convergence tests for the total energy, the band gap, the pressure, the stresses and the atomic forces. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials have been used for the interactions between valence electrons, core electrons and nuclei.61 To compare the absolute energy of Kohn–Sham orbitals and total energies, we followed the protocol suggested by Meloni et al., in which the energies were aligned with respect to the energy of the Pb5d semicore state.53 For an accurate description of the band gaps, the band gaps of the pure phases and binary and ternary perovskite mixtures were calculated using the hybrid functional PBE054 on the PBEsol55 geometries, taking SOC effects (PBE0 + SOC) into account. In this case, fully relativistic norm-conserving pseudopotentials61 have been used and the Kohn–Sham orbitals have been expanded in a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 80 Ry and a density cutoff of 320 Ry.
For the pure perovskite phase of FAPbI3 our 0 K static DFT calculations revealed that among the α and β FAPbI3 phases, β-FAPbI3 has a lower energy, for this reason, the β-phase was considered in our analysis. For the preparation of the mixtures, FA+ has been successively replaced by GUA+. In particular, for each concentration when allowed by the composition in both the β and the δ phases, we considered 10 different possible replacements for the substituted cations, starting from the best configuration at the energetically most favored previous next lower GUA+ content, in order to find the structure with the lowest energy. The maximum standard deviation of the difference in energy per stoichiometric unit for different substitution pattern for each composition is of the order of 0.005 eV for the β and 0.006 eV for the δ phase, respectively. We also performed calculations with different GUA+ and FA+ orientations, where the maximum standard deviation of the difference in energy per stoichiometric unit was of the order of 0.007 eV. Once the lowest-energy β-GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 and δ-GUAxFA(1−x)PbI3 structures were found, FA+ was replaced by Cs+, for the construction of ternary CsyGUAxFA(1−y−x)PbI3 mixtures. One should mention here that to estimate the relative energetics of the different phases at 0 K, the alignment procedure requires an identical number of stoichiometric units. For this reason, the δ and the β phase superlattices contain 12 stoichiometric units since the crystal structure of β-phase consists of 12 stoichiometric units (144 atoms). To this end, it was not possible to employ the experimental δ-GUAPbI3 structure35,36,62 in order to compare the mixed compounds with the corresponding pure ones in our calculations since there is no way to create supercells that could have the same number of stoichiometric units with the β-phase. For this reason, we prepared δ-GUAPbI3 structures starting from the known δ-FAPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 structures by substituting FA+ or Cs+ by GUA+. We have concluded that the pure δ-GUAPbI3 structure, constructed from δ-CsPbI3 by substituiting Cs+ with GUA+ is the lowest energy structure and in turn the structure that was used in our calculations. One should also mention here that both experimental δ-GUAPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 structures are similar since they consist of edge-sharing octahedra that are surrounded by cations. Finally, to compare the mixed perovskite compounds with the corresponding pure ones, we considered different 3D perovskite GUAPbI3 phases that we constructed by substituting FA+ by GUA+ in the α and β FAPbI3 phases, considering also different orientations of the cations. We concluded that the structure with the lowest energy and thus the most stable one at 0 K is arising from the α-FAPbI3, with each GUA+ molecule having the same orientation.
Car–Parrinello MD simulations for a trajectory of 6 ps in the NVT ensemble at 300 K were performed using the CPMD code63 for systems of 150 atoms. The wavefunction cutoff was set to 90 Ry and Goedecker normconserving pseudopotentials were used.64–66 A time step of 3 a.u. was used with a fictitious mass parameter of 550 a.u. The temperature was controlled by five different Nosé–Hoover thermostats, one for each species, with a coupling frequency of 1500 cm−1.67–69 The analysis of the relative energetics has been performed for an equilibrated trajectory of 4.3 ps.
