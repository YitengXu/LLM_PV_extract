The monoclinic structure of these compounds was confirmed by XRD. The luminescence properties were investigated by measuring up-conversion luminescence spectra and decay curves. KGd(WO4)2 crystalline powders doped with Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ exhibit effective multicolour up-conversion luminescence in the VIS and NIR spectral ranges under 980 nm excitation. The vibrational properties of the materials were investigated using μ-Raman spectroscopy. The assistance of low energy phonons of the KGd(WO4)2 matrix in the energy transfer processes between the excited manifolds of the Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and/or Ho3+ ions during the up-conversion process was discussed. These results indicate that KGd(WO4)2 powders doped with selected Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions may be potentially used as single-component multicolour or white emission phosphors.
Introduction
In spite of it being 50 years since the up-conversion (UC) luminescence of rare earths was described for the first time,1 increasing interest in UC materials is still observed because of their potential applications in many fields of life and science such as medicine, pharmacy, biology, optoelectronics, material engineering, physics and chemistry. UC is a process in which two or more low energy near-infrared (NIR) photons lead to the generation of higher energy photons, via sequential absorption and non-radiative energy transfer processes. The efficiency of such a UC process depends on the physical properties of the host matrix and the combination of rare earth (RE) dopants. Typically, most of the intermediate excitation states of RE ions non-radiatively relax to lower-lying energy levels and the accompanying energy transfer to the host matrix may significantly hamper the UC luminescence efficiency. Generally, the host matrix for UC luminescence should possess relatively low phonon energy to avoid efficiency losses via multiple absorption and non-radiative energy transfer processes of RE ions (phonon quenching effect). Many recent studies on increasing the efficiency of UC luminescence that focus on reducing the electron–phonon coupling were carried out using a range of different host materials.
Inorganic RE activated UC crystalline materials are currently in the focus of research due to their high efficiency in visible (VIS) and/or near infrared (NIR) frequency conversion under NIR excitation. These UC materials can be used as light sources or energy converters in many integrated opto-electronic devices such as optical sensors,2–4 photovoltaic solar cells,5,6 3D multicolour displays7–9 or light emitting diodes (LEDs).10–12 In particular, these phosphors are expected to be the next generation of white light emission materials.13–16 The RE-doped UC white light emitting crystalline materials have some advantages over conventional white light sources because of the low costs of the technology, their low energy excitation, their long life-span, and them being environmentally/eco-friendly.17 White light can be obtained by simultaneous mixing of the primary colours red, green and blue in defined proportions. The choice of dopants in the white emitting UC materials is determined by the condition of the resonance of the energy levels between the sensitizer and activator ions. Many RE ions such as Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+ are very efficient in producing the primary colours due to the specific structure of their electronic levels, which is convenient for realizing the conversion of NIR to VIS light. In most of the RE-doped UC materials, Yb3+ ions are usually used as a sensitizer owing to their strong absorption around 980 nm. Moreover, the efficiency of such a UC process depends on the physical properties of the host matrix. There are many representative RE-doped crystalline materials such as fluorides (Ba2GdF7,18 NaLuF4,19 and NaYF420–25) or oxides (Na4ZnW3O12,26 Lu3Al5O12,27 LiNbO3,28 NdPO4,29 and Y2O330) doped with different combinations of Yb3+, Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+ ions, which are effective for the UC process. Among others tungstate KGd(WO4)2 (KGW) crystals have been recognized as one of the most efficient UC host materials when doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ ions due to their excellent structure and optical properties31,32 and relatively low phonon energy. In our previous papers we reported the UC properties of a series of KGW single crystals33–35 and powders36 triply-doped with different combinations of Er3+, Tm3+, Tb3+, Pr3+ Ho3+ or Yb3+ ions.
In the present paper, we report the results of spectroscopic studies of KGW:RE3+ powders doubly-doped with different combinations of RE ions: Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+. In all of these samples the Yb3+ ions were used as sensitizers owing to their strong absorption around 980 nm and the UC luminescence originating from the transitions between the energy states of the co-dopants (Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+), which act as the activator ions. All of the possible energy transfer processes involved in these UC mechanisms were discussed. Some vibrational properties of the KGW single crystals and powders doped with various combinations of RE ions were reported previously in our papers.35,37 In this work, the vibrational properties of the KGW powders doped with Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ ions were investigated using μ-Raman spectroscopy. The energies of the stretching and bending vibrations of the WO42− tetrahedra, and WOW and WOOW oxygen bridges corresponding to the Raman active modes were determined. These low energy lattice vibrations assist the effective energy transfer process between the RE3+ ions in the studied samples, which leads to the non-radiative relaxation rate between the excited manifolds of the dopant ions and relatively long excited state lifetimes. The results show that the presented KGW crystalline powders KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ exhibit multicolour UC emission, and could be used as very effective NIR to VIS energy converters.
Experimental
Synthesis of KGW:RE3+ powders
RE3+-doped crystalline powders KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ were synthesized by means of the modified Pechini method.38 This technique allows the relatively easy substitution of Gd3+ ions by other RE3+ lanthanides giving a uniform distribution of dopants at the atomic scale. The synthesis procedure of the KGW:RE3+ crystalline powders applied in this work was similar to that described in our last paper.36 Stoichiometric amounts of metal precursors K2CO3, Gd2O3, Yb2O3, Tm2O3, Er2O3 and Ho2O3 were dissolved in diluted HNO3 solution under heating and stirring in the presence of citric acid (C6H8O7, complexing agent) at 70 °C. Subsequently, WO3 was slowly dissolved in hot ammonia water with the addition of citric acid. The overall amount of metal ions to complexing agent was set to 1:3 (molar). When both homogeneous and clear solutions were obtained, their pH values were set to be 8–9 and they were mixed together. A suitable amount of mannitol (C6H8(OH)6, polymeric agent) was then added into the solution. Complexing and polymeric agents were taken at the molar ratio of 3:1. After complete dissolution, the temperature was increased to 90 °C and the mixture was continuously stirred for about 2 h to enhance the polyesterification. The solution was then transferred into an alumina crucible, put inside a furnace and kept at 140 °C for 20 h to evaporate the solvents. A greyish, foamy-like viscous gel was obtained. The temperature was then increased to 350 °C for 3 h to dry the gel until it turned into a black resin. The pyrolysis process of the obtained matter was carried out at 700 °C for 24 h. After calcination the crucible content was crushed and ground in an agate mortar and very fine KGW:RE3+ powders were obtained. The doping concentrations of Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions in the mentioned above systems KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ were 3/3, 5/1 and 3/3 at%, respectively. The choice of RE3+ ion compositions was made on the basis of KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ containing a 5:1 molar composition according to well-known results of ytterbium sensibilization of Er ions for single crystals.39 The remaining compositions were chosen taking into account the results of our previous investigations to obtain a UC intensity of the samples comparable to the UC intensity of the Yb3+/Er3+ sample. The obtained samples, after controlled mixing, were used in the investigations of the resulting UC emission.
Experimental methods
Powder diffraction data for the obtained KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ compounds were recorded using a BRUKER D8 Discover diffractometer with standard CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) and an anode working at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current in operating mode. The Bragg–Brentano diffraction geometry for the 2θ range of 10–70° was applied, with a 0.015° step size and an acquisition time of 2 seconds per step at 298 K.
An ASEM Jeol 7001TTLS scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the morphology of the obtained powders. The accelerating voltage used in the experiment was 5 kV. The samples were first put on carbon tape and then covered/pre-treated with a thin layer of gold.
The Raman measurements were performed in back-scattering geometry using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope equipped with a confocal DM 2500 Leica optical microscope and a CCD detector. The unpolarized Raman spectra were recorded under excitation with an Ar laser emitting light at 488 nm in a single scan with a 60 s exposure time. The applied power of the laser beam before focusing was lower than 0.5 mW. The position of the Raman peaks was calibrated before data collection using a Si reference sample as an internal standard with the peak position at 520.3 cm−1. The diffraction-limited optical spatial resolution depends on the excitation wavelength and for the 50× LWD objective it was approximately equal to 0.8 μm. The instrumental resolution of the spectrometer was better than 2 cm−1. The spectral analyses were performed with the software packages WiRE 3.4/Renishaw.
The room temperature UC spectra of the rare earth doped KGW powders were measured under excitation with an IR laser diode (IR LD, CNI Lasers) at 980 nm (which corresponds to the 7F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+). The UC spectra and decay times were measured using an FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments with monochromators in the Czerny Turner configuration and a Hamamatsu 928 PMT as a detector. For excitation during the decay time measurements, a 975 nm IR laser diode (IR LD, CNI Lasers) modulated with a HandyScope HS3 oscilloscope was used.
Results and discussion
Structure characterization
The phase uniformity of the synthesized powder samples was investigated by means of XRD measurements (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Experimental XRD patterns of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders and reference ICDD PDF-2 of KGW. 
As it is shown, all the diffraction patterns are in agreement with the PDF-2 standard card no. 01-073-4353 (undoped KGW) taken from the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). The produced phases are monoclinic with space group C2 (no. 15) which is centrosymmetric. No diffraction lines originating from impurities are observed. The texturation of the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ powders is revealed by the disproportionation of the intensity relation between subsequent peaks, with reference to the PDF-2 card. It is caused by the shape anisotropy of the growing crystallites, when it goes towards the privileged directions (like orthogonal to the (−111) or (020) planes and their families). As a result, the planes mentioned above are more populated and the other ones (i.e. (110), (200), (−202), (111), (−311) or (220)) are less numerous, so their corresponding intensities are suppressed. For most cases, the texturation can be eliminated using repeated, thorough mixing and grinding of the as-prepared powders. The results for the RE3+-doped samples show that the crystal structure with the monoclinic system remains undisturbed when the dopant ions are incorporated into the KGW matrix. The lattice constants were calculated by means of Rietveld refinement using the MAUD ver. 2.32 program and are shown in Table 1, including reference data from the ICDD card. The average crystallite sizes calculated from the XRD data using the Scherrer formula were also included in Table 1.

The observed differences in lattice constants are the consequence of different ionic radii of the doping RE3+ ions and local lattice strain due to the size effect/crystallite size decreasing. The effective ion radius of Gd3+ is 1.053 Å, therefore substituting it in its positions with selected lanthanides Yb3+ (0.985 Å), Tm3+ (0.994 Å), Er3+ (1.004 Å) and Ho3+ (1.015 Å) should lead to unit cell shrinkage, as observed for Yb3+/Er3+.40 In the case of Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ this relation is not maintained, although the doping level is the same and equals 6 at% in each case. This may be the result of the slightly different spatial orientation of the bonding orbitals in particular RE ions. Such differences may influence the volume of the unit cells in which Gd ions are substituted with other RE3+ ions. It is a well-known fact that in some cases the spatial distribution of bonding orbitals can even make it impossible to incorporate RE3+ ions into the crystal matrix. Such a situation occurs in the case of α-BiB3O6 and δ-BiB3O6 phases. The orthorhombic δ phase can be easily doped with many RE3+ ions while the monoclinic α phase, despite its lower density, cannot be effectively doped with RE ions.41
Scanning electron microscopy measurements
The morphology of the KGW:RE3+ powders was investigated using the SEM technique. Fig. 2a–c show the SEM micrographs of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders. As it is seen, the KGW:RE3+ powders were highly inhomogeneous with the tendency to agglomerate. In the case of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ powder (Fig. 2a), structures with two different morphologies are visible. The KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals (Fig. 2b) differ significantly from the two other powder structures. There are two fractions of particles: well and homogenously distributed micro- (broad range of sizes 1–30 μm) and nano-sized. The KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powder particles were porous with a tendency to agglomerate (Fig. 2c).

μ-Raman investigation
KGd(WO4)2 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with C2/cC62h space group symmetry at room temperature with Z = 4 formula units in the unit cell. In this structure, W and O atoms form octahedral ionic complexes of C1 symmetry. The K+ and Gd3+ ions occupy the equivalent crystallographic positions of C2 symmetry. In the rare earth doped KGW powders, Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions substitute for the Gd3+ ions and the local symmetry of their position is C2.32
The room temperature unpolarized Raman spectra of KGW:Yb3+/Er3+, KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ were recorded in the spectral range of 70–1100 cm−1 covering the region of internal and external vibrations (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders recorded at room temperature. 
As presented in Fig. 3, there are some Raman bands in the spectra characteristic for tungstate crystals assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of WO42− tetrahedra and single WOW and double WOOW oxygen bridges. The dominant sharp peaks at about 901 cm−1 are attributed to the symmetric stretching vibrations of WO42− tetrahedra. The modes located at about 808 cm−1 are assigned to the coupling of stretching vibrations of WO42− and WOW. The very low intensity modes at 931 cm−1 and relatively low intensity bands positioned at about 758 and 746 cm−1 are attributed to the coupling of stretching vibrations of WO42− and WOOW. The bands detected at about 768, 686 and 529 cm−1 are assigned as the stretching vibrations of the WOOW oxygen bridge bonds. The deformation bending vibrations were recorded at 438, 401 and 313 cm−1 (vibrations of the WOW groups), 372, 349 and 343 cm−1 (vibrations of WO42− tetrahedra) and 296 cm−1 (coupling vibrations of WO42− and WOOW molecular groups). Below 250 cm−1 the lattice modes were detected. The modes located at about 236 and 206 cm−1 correspond to the translations of K and Gd/RE atoms, respectively. The bands positioned at 174, 148, 142 and 121 cm−1 are attributed to the coupling of bending vibrations of the WOOW units and translations of K atoms, whereas the peaks at 112 cm−1 correspond to cooperative vibrations/librations of the WO42− tetrahedra and bending vibrations of the WOW groups. Moreover, below 260 cm−1, the Raman spectrum of the KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ micro-crystals shows a broad luminescence band, excited with a 488 nm wavelength, characteristic of rare earth ion excitation in the crystalline lattice of KGW. These luminescence bands cover the range of the remaining lattice vibrational motions of the investigated KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powder and disturbed the determination of Raman bands in this spectral range. All of the wavenumbers of the Raman bands given above were determined for the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ micro-crystals. On the basis of the analysis given for the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ Raman spectra, we can conclude that the presence of the RE dopants in the KGW micro-crystals does not change the position and the relative intensity of the Raman bands of the investigated systems. The determined low energy lattice vibrations of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders assist in the energy transfer process between the rare earth ions introduced into the KGW host matrix, which can lead to a partially non-radiative relaxation between the excited manifolds of dopants ions.
UC luminescence spectra
The room temperature UC luminescence spectra of the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+, KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ samples were measured under 980 nm excitation. In the presented UC spectra of the investigated powders the bands associated with blue, green, red and/or NIR UC luminescence were assigned to the respective f–f transitions (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  The luminescence spectra of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ micro-crystals after excitation at 980 nm with a 2430 mW laser pump power. 
As shown in Fig. 4, efficient blue, weak red and relatively high intensity NIR luminescence bands were detected in the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ spectrum under 980 nm excitation. These emissions detected at 476 nm (21008 cm−1), 654 nm (15291 cm−1) and 800 nm (12500 cm−1) are due to the 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4 and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of the Tm3+ ions, respectively. The efficient green emission of the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ powders detected as a strong, double structure band with the maximum intensity at about 527 and 550 nm (18975 and 18182 cm−1) was produced by the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ions. The low intensity red emission band at 660 nm (15152 cm−1) was assigned to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+ ions. In the spectrum of KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+, green and red emission bands at about 544 nm (18382 cm−1) and 654 nm (15291 cm−1) were observed with comparable, relatively high intensity. The green emission corresponds to the 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8 transition, the red emission is observed due to the 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+ ions, while a weak NIR feature at about 754 nm (13263 cm−1) is due to the 5S2, 5F4 → 5I7 of the Ho3+ ions. It should be noted that the blue UC luminescence bands appear only in the UC spectra of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+. While the green UC luminescence bands appear in the spectrum of KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ with higher intensity than for the KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powder (the values of integral intensity are equal to 760000 and 390000 a.u., respectively after excitation at 980 nm with 2430 mW laser pump power (Fig. 4)).
Moreover, the intensity of all emission bands in the UC spectra depends on the 980 nm laser diode excitation power, which corresponds to the 7F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions of Yb3+. The UC spectra of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders were measured at room temperature under different pumping powers (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  The luminescence spectra of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ (a), KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ (b) and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ (c) micro-crystals after excitation at 980 nm with varying laser pump power. 
The UC luminescence spectra of all the investigated systems were analyzed on the basis of the standard Dieke's diagram of energy levels of trivalent lanthanides.42 The efficiency of the energy transfer process between the Yb3+ and Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+ luminescence ions depends on the relative location of their electronic energy levels with respect to that of Yb3+, which can be revealed after the analysis of the UC spectra. In the considered systems, Yb3+ ions contribute to the UC emission by energy transfer from the excited Yb3+ ions (2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions). The excited Yb3+ ions can transfer the energy to the excited states of other dopants by a series of Excited States Absorption (ESA) processes and then by the transitions from the excited to ground states of the excited Er3+, Tm3+ or Ho3+ ions, giving the multicolour UC luminescence. Such a cooperative energy transfer mechanism is responsible for the UC emission in all of the systems considered. The energy level diagram of the Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ or Ho3+ ions and a schematic presentation of the possible mechanisms responsible for the generation of UC luminescence in the systems studied are given in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Energy level diagram of Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+ and/or Yb3+ ions and the proposed UC emission mechanism KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ systems. The Yb3+ ions at the 2F7/2 ground state pumped by 980 nm excitation are populated to the 2F5/2 level and possible energy transfer processes to the excited states of Er3+, Ho3+ and/or Tm3+ ions are represented by dashed arrows. 
As mentioned above the intensity of UC emission grows with the increasing laser pump power for all of the investigated powders. Moreover, the change in the UC luminescence intensity is proportional to the excitation pump power and this dependence is crucial to investigating the UC mechanism. According to the theory, in the range of an unsaturated UC luminescence the integral intensity I of the UC emission bands depends on the excitation power P as I ∼ Pn, where n is the number of absorbed infrared photons needed for the emission of one visible or infrared photon.43,44 To determine the mechanism of photon activation during the UC process, the dependences of the logarithm of the integral intensity I of the emission bands on the logarithm of the excitation power P of the laser diode were calculated. The slope of the corresponding linear fit is equal to the number of photons (n) participating in the UC processes.45Fig. 7a–c show the integrated intensities of the UC luminescence bands for the blue, green, red and/or NIR of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ as a function of the pump intensity in a logarithmic scale.
 Fig. 7  Dependences of the logarithm of intensity of up-conversion emission bands on the logarithm of excitation power at 980 nm of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ (a), KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ (b) and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ (c) micro-crystals. 
As shown in Fig. 7a–c, in the materials studied two or three-photon processes occur for blue, green, red and/or NIR UC luminescence. The UC processes can be realized when the excited Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to the excited states of the Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+ ions, which can be populated through a series of phonon assisted ESA process. Then, the UC luminescence can be a result of the proper excited to the ground state transitions.
The analysis of the data presented in Fig. 7a suggests that in the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ samples, UC luminescence is a two- or three-photon process. The fitted slope is 2.73, 2.53 and 1.99 for the blue, red and NIR emission bands, respectively. This indicates that a three-photon process is necessary to produce the blue and red UC emission, while the NIR UC emission should be a consequence of a two-photon process. The blue emission at 476 nm originates from the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+ ions, while the red emission at 654 nm originates from the 1G4 → 3F4 transition. The 1G4 state of Tm3+ ions can be populated through a three-photon process that involves excited Yb3+ ions and intermediate levels of Tm3+ ions. In particular, the excited Yb3+ ions can transfer their energy to the Tm3+ ions and excite them from the ground 3H6 level to the excited 3H5 level. Then the Tm3+ ions non-radiatively relax and populate the 3F4 level. The next excited Yb3+ ions can transfer their energy to pump the Tm3+ ions on the 3F4 level for populating the 3F2,3 levels. Again, the Tm3+ ions in the 3F2,3 levels non-radiatively relax to the 3H4 level. And then, once again, the Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to pump the Tm3+ ions on the 3H4 level for populating the 1G4 level. Finally, the excited Tm3+ ions in the 1G4 level relax to the ground state 3H6, by producing the blue emission at around 476 nm and a small number of the excited ions relax to the 3F4 level by yielding the red emission at around 654 nm. The NIR emission at 801 nm originates from the emission of Tm3+ ions through their 3H4 → 3H6 transitions. In the case of a two-photon process an energy transfer takes place, when the energy of the two excited Yb3+ ions (the excited Yb3+–Yb3+ pair) goes to the excited states of closely located 3F2,3 and next after the non-radiative relaxation to the 3H4 level of the Tm3+ ions.
In the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ samples (Fig. 7b) the two-photon process occurs. The fitted slope is 1.84 and 1.81 for the green emission bands and 1.78 for the red emission bands. The slope of the green UC luminescence at 527 and 550 nm is comparable, which implies that both green UC emissions are similarly sensitive to the change in pumping power. The efficient green UC emission at 527/550 nm in the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ powders is produced by the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ions. The weak red luminescence at 660 nm is due to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+ ions. In these emissions the energy of the excited Yb3+–Yb3+ pair is transferred to the excited states of the Er3+ ions and transitions from the excited to the ground states of these ions take place. In particular, under 980 nm excitation, the excited Yb3+ ions can transfer energy to an adjacent Er3+ ion, which populates the 4I11/2 level of Er3+ from the 4I15/2 ground state. The energy transfer from the next Yb3+ ion can then populate the 4F7/2 level of the Er3+ ions and then non-radiatively relax to the 4S3/2 level and part of this energy can non-radiatively relax to the 4F9/2 level, resulting in the observed green and red emission by the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, transitions respectively.43,46
In the KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders (Fig. 7c), two-photon processes take part in the UC luminescence. The fitted slope is 1.51, 1.53 and 1.42 for the green, red and NIR (at 754 nm) emission bands, respectively. The slope of the green and red UC luminescence is comparable, which implies similarly sensitivity to the change in pumping power. Moreover, the UC energy transfer process associated with the green and red emission is evidently more efficient than that of NIR emission in the KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders. The green 544 nm emission corresponds to the 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8 transitions of the Ho3+ ions, whereas the red 654 nm emission is due to the 5F5 → 5I8 transition of the Ho3+ ions. The contribution to the weak NIR feature at about 754 nm is produced by the emission from the 5S2, 5F4 states of the Ho3+ ions. The 5S2, 5F4 and 5F5 levels can be pumped by the Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs as well as through ESA processes. In this case the phonon-assisted energy transfer can lead to non-radiative relaxation between the excited manifolds of the Ho3+ ions. In particular, the Yb3+ ions transfer the excitation energy to the Ho3+ ions and make the Ho3+ ions populate the 5I6 and 5I7 levels. Then with the aid of energy transferred from the excited Yb3+ ions once again the 5S2, 5F4, 5F5 and 5I4 levels of Ho3+ can be populated effectively through the ESA process. Finally, green, red and NIR (at about 750 and 800 nm) UC luminescence can be generated as a result of the 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8, 5S2, 5F4 → 5I7 and 5I4 → 5I8 transitions, respectively.
The CIE (Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage 1931 chromaticity) coordinates for the UC emission spectra measured under 980 nm excitation at 1.5 W for the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ phosphors are located in the blue, green and orange regions, as given in Fig. 8, respectively.
 Fig. 8  The CIE chromaticity diagram of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ phosphors. 
The CIE chromaticity coordinates are (0.1338, 0.1078) for Tm3+, (0.2728, 0.7033) for Er3+ and (0.4971, 0.4961) for Ho3+ which demonstrated that KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ have a high colour purity of blue, green and orange colour.
Decay kinetics
The lifetimes of different emitting states of the Er3+, Tm3+ or Ho3+ ions in the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders were measured at room temperature using 975 nm excitation (Fig. 9a–c). The luminescence lifetimes of the investigated powders show a single-exponential time dependence for all of the transitions of the luminescent ions and were fitted by single exponential curves (labelled τ1 and τ2). The rise τ1 and decay τ2 times are related to the transfer rate constants between Yb3+ and Tm3+, Er3+and Ho3+ and to the intrinsic lifetimes of the states involved.
 Fig. 9  The decay curves at room temperature of the excitation power at 975 nm of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ (a), KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ (b) and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ (c) powders. 
As is seen from Fig. 9a the blue, red and NIR luminescence of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ powders (the 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4 and 3H4 → 3I6 transitions of the Tm3+) has a rise time τ1 of about 21, 8 and 30 μs and a single exponential decay with a lifetime τ1 of 120, 138 and 206 μs, respectively. The green luminescence of the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ powders (2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+) has a rise time τ1 of about 32 and 27 μs and the decay times τ2 of 132 and 133 μs, respectively. The red luminescence of the KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ powders (4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+) undergoes rise and decay with a lifetime of 38 and 147 μs, respectively (Fig. 9b). The green luminescence of the KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders (5S2 + 5F4 → 5I8 transition of the Ho3+) has a rise time τ1 equal to 15 μs and a decay time τ2 equal to 82 μs. The red luminescence of the KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders (5F5 → 5I8 transition of the Ho3+) has a rise and decay with a lifetime equal to 37 and 200 μs, respectively (Fig. 9c). The confirmation of the proposed energy transfer mechanisms can be given by the up-conversion emission decay profile measurement. For all the ions it is observed that the rise time in the case of up-conversion emission is the result of energy transfer from Yb3+. Because the energy levels in all the samples, from which we observe luminescence, are not in resonance with the 7F5/2 state of Yb3+ some additional processes such as ESA, EEET or ETU are involved in the emission from the excited levels of Tm3+, Er3+and Ho3+ and at the end of the excitation pulse a typical rise and decay of the emission is observed. Moreover, for all the samples it can be observed that emission at shorter wavelengths (Tm3+:1G4 → 3H6,1G4 → 3F4, Er3+:2H11/2,4S3/2 → 4I15/2, Ho3+:5S2 + 5F4 → 5I8) decays faster than that at longer wavelengths (Tm3+:3H4 → 3I6, Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and Ho3+:5F5 → 5I8) This is observed because the emission at short wavelengths is decaying by both emission and relaxation to longer wavelengths.
Tuning of the white emission
KGW:Yb3+ phosphors co-doped with different ions (Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+) giving luminescence in blue, green and red regions create wide possibilities of emission color tuning. To demonstrate the colour tuning of the investigated phosphors, samples of mixed powders consisting of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and/or KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders were prepared. In particular, the blue and green colours originate from the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ up-conversion emission, while orange (mix of green and red colours) originates from KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ up-conversion emission. The most important factor taken into account in the final colour generation is the ratio of the particular ions that give the multicolour emission in the VIS regions. By changing the weight ratio of particular ions it is possible to obtain emission with different colours. In Fig. 10a the luminescence spectra of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+&KGW:Yb3+/Er3+&KGW:Yb3+Ho3+ powders mixed in ratios of 90:1:120 (sample A), 170:1:120 (sample B) and 2:0:1 (sample C) are presented. Moreover, as was mentioned, the multicolour up-conversion emissions of all the powders are dependent on the incident laser power. To check also the impact on the emission colour of the mixed powders, the appropriate measurements were made for different excitation powers (Fig. 10b). As is seen from the spectra (Fig. 10b) for the highest excitation power, the emission from Tm3+ ions (1G4 → 3H6) was strongest. With decrease in the laser power it was observed that the emission intensity ratio of the blue luminescence of Tm3+ (1G4 → 3H6) to the green and red (5S2 + 5F4 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions) luminescence of Ho3+ also decreases. This gives the possibility of tuning the emission colour by changing the power of the incident IR laser.
 Fig. 10  The luminescence spectra of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+, and KGW:Yb3+Ho3+ powders mixed in different weight ratios 90:1:120 (sample A), 170:1:120 (sample B) and 2:0:1 (sample C) (a) and power dependence of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+&KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders mixed in 2:0:1 ratio (sample C) (b). 
For the mixtures of the powders, the CIE coordinates were calculated and shown on the CIE 1931 diagram (Fig. 11). For the powders with the emission closest to the white colour, power dependent luminescence was measured and for all spectra CIE coordinates were calculated. It can be observed that for the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+&KGW:Yb3+/Er3+&KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ mixture, emission colour closest to the white emission coordinates (x: 0.33, y: 0.33) was observed for the highest excitation laser power. In the case of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+&KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders, the colour of the emission changed from orange (low power), through white (x: 0.35, y: 0.34) up to blue (highest power). This experiment shows that there are at least two factors (weight ratio of the powders with different dopants and excitation power) that have an impact on the emission colour and allow tuning of the luminescence.

Conclusions
In this paper spectroscopic studies for a series of novel KGW powders doped with different combinations of rare earth ions, Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+, were presented for the first time. These double-doped KGW powders were synthesized by means of the modified Pechini method. The monoclinic phase of the crystalline powders was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The SEM images showed that the porous powder particles tended to agglomerate with an average size of the micro-crystals smaller than 1 μm, except for KGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Er3+ powders that contain both micro- and nano-fractions of particles. The vibrational properties of the investigated powders were studied using μ-Raman spectroscopy. The phonons corresponding to the vibrations in the KGW matrix assist in energy transfer processes between the excited manifolds of the Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and/or Ho3+ ions and lead to non-radiative relaxation. Excitation of the Yb3+ ions by 980 nm laser irradiation in KGW doped with the Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ ions leads to effective phonon-assisted UC processes. The investigated systems show effective multicolour emission in the VIS/NIR spectral range originating from the excitation of the Er3+, Tm3+ and/or Ho3+ ions. The colour coordinates for UC emission of the investigated samples presented in the CIE chromaticity diagram show the effective blue, green and orange UC luminescence of the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+, KGW:Yb3+/Er3+ and KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders, respectively. For the KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+&KGW:Yb3+/Er3+&KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ mixture the white emission coordinates (x: 0.33, y: 0.33) were observed for the incident laser power equal to 2980 mW. In the case of KGW:Yb3+/Tm3+&KGW:Yb3+/Ho3+ powders, the power-dependent colour of the emission changed from orange, through white (x: 0.35, y: 0.34) up to blue. As a result, we obtained very promising micro-crystalline materials with effective UC emission in the VIS/NIR spectral range, which can be used in a new generation of optoelectronic devices for multicolour emission.
