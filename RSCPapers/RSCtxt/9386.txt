    , Accepted 29th January 2018First published on 29th January 2018AbstractThe existing photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are almost based on oxide semiconductors. Compared with n-type oxide photoanodes, p-type oxide photocathodes are rather rare and most are not suitable for unassisted water reduction because of their inappropriate band edge positions. Thus, it is highly desirable to exploit more kinds of p-type semiconductors for Z-scheme PEC cells. Commonly, organic semiconductors are p-type with a more negative band edge, which will give more options for photocathodes and provide new paths for sustainable overall water splitting. Herein, we report a PEC cell in which TiO2 and the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester bulk heterojunction (P3HT:PCBM BHJ) are connected by copper wires to achieve solar-driven overall water splitting in the absence of an external bias. The photocurrent density of the TiO2–P3HT:PCBM system is about 145 μA cm−2 and remains constant in a 9 h test duration under continuous illumination. The average H2 and O2 evolution rates of this system are about 2.38 μmol h−1 and 1.16 μmol h−1, respectively. The charge-to-chemical faradaic efficiency is 88.7%. These results confirm that a PEC cell for overall water splitting can be achieved by coupling the most representative inorganic semiconductor TiO2 and the most considered organic material P3HT:PCBM.
1. Introduction
The construction of Z-scheme photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is a promising approach for unassisted overall water splitting.1 In a Z-scheme PEC cell, the indispensable components are photoelectrodes, which include a photoanode and a photocathode, respectively. The existing photoelectrodes for PEC cells are almost based on oxide semiconductors2–5 with wide distribution and good stability in the atmosphere. It is known that most oxide semiconductors are n-type, the valence band maximum (VBM) of which is determined by O 2p orbitals and is more positive than +3.0 V vs. NHE, so they are suitable for the water oxidation half-reaction as the photoanode. In contrast, p-type oxide semiconductors are rather rare, and their conduction band minimum (CBM) is usually more positive than the reduction potential of water (H+/H2, 0 V vs. NHE). As a result, they are not suitable for the unassisted water reduction half-reaction as photocathodes.6,7 Obviously, it is highly desirable to exploit more kinds of p-type semiconductors for unassisted overall water splitting in Z-scheme PEC cells.
In recent years, organic semiconductors have acquired much attention because of their attractive advantages such as a high optical absorption coefficient, moderate bandgap (2.0–3.0 eV) for visible light absorption, and more negative lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).8 More importantly, most organic semiconductors are intrinsically p-type, thus showing great potential for water reduction. So it can be predicted that if p-type organic semiconductors can match well with n-type inorganic semiconductors in the Z-scheme PEC system, it will give more options for photocathodes and provide new paths for realizing the sustainable production of H2 and O2. In a wide variety of organic semiconductors, only a few have been studied for water reduction at present, typically including poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Some results have presented high cathode photocurrent densities.9–13 However, introducing p-type organic semiconductors into the Z-scheme PEC system coupled with n-type inorganic semiconductors to realize overall water splitting has rarely been reported.
On the other hand, TiO2 is a prime representative of n-type metal oxide photocatalysts and one of the most utilized photoanode materials.14 Nevertheless, the inability to absorb visible light, and the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes are still major bottlenecks for the practical use of TiO2 in the field of water splitting.15 Especially, a critical shortcoming of TiO2 is that TiO2–Pt based PEC cells often require a significant additional bias to realize water splitting. The reason is that when TiO2 comes into contact with the electrolyte, a solid–liquid junction is formed. Band bending at the TiO2/electrolyte interface makes the CB of TiO2 more positive than the water reduction potential,15 which causes the electrons of TiO2 to encounter an energy barrier to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, how to utilize TiO2 photoanodes in an overall water splitting system working without additional bias and sacrificial agents is a great challenge.
In this work, the organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) P3HT:PCBM was chosen as the photocathode and connected with the n-type TiO2 photoanode directly in a tandem configuration to construct a Z-scheme PEC cell. P3HT is the most widely studied organic semiconductor in the fields of PEC water splitting and organic solar cells. The LUMO level of P3HT is at −1.5 V vs. NHE, which is quite suitable for the HER. In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of P3HT is at −0.4 V vs. NHE which can match well with the CBM of TiO2 to form a Z-scheme structure. However, the separation of excitons in P3HT is difficult. Therefore, PCBM was introduced to form a BHJ with P3HT to improve carrier separation. This P3HT:PCBM BHJ has always been a common structure in organic solar cells for high efficiency charge separation. Besides, a layer of organic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as the hole transport layer to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. The configuration of the PEC cell is shown in Fig. 1. This system realized solar-driven overall water splitting without any external bias and sacrificial agents. Besides, it made full use of sunlight, maintained the high oxidation and reduction power of photogenerated minority carriers in each photoelectrode and separated the products of H2 and O2 to improve the efficiency and safety of the photocatalytic reaction.

2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanorod arrays
TiO2 nanorods (NRs) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method.16 Firstly, a TiO2 seed layer was deposited onto an FTO (F:SnO2) substrate through the ion-beam sputtering method in a vacuum to eradicate the reaction between the acidic electrolyte and the FTO substrate. Then 30 mL of deionized water was mixed with 30 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5–38% by weight) to reach a total volume of 60 mL in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The mixture was stirred under ambient conditions for 5 min before the addition of 1 mL of titanium dioxide. After stirring for another 5 min, FTO substrates were placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 12 h. After the synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature under flowing water. The FTO substrates were taken out, rinsed with deionized water, dried in ambient air and then annealed in air at 500 °C for 5 h.
The IrOx nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesised according to Zhao et al.'s method.17 50 mL of 2.0 mM potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) hexahydrate (K2IrCl6·6H2O) aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 13 by adding 10 wt% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution, and then heated at 90 °C for 20 min. The resulting solution was then quickly transferred into an ice bath, adjusted to pH 1 by rapidly adding 3 M nitric acid (HNO3) solution and stirred continuously for another 80 min until the solution became deep blue. The solution was stored in a refrigerator at 2 °C. The IrOx nanoparticles were loaded onto the TiO2 NRs by soaking the TiO2 NRs into five-times diluted IrOx solution several times, during which the IrOx nanoparticles were adsorbed onto the surface of the TiO2.
2.2 Preparation of P3HT:PCBM based photocathodes
The photocathodes were prepared with the following procedure. By a spin coating method, the cleaned FTO substrate was covered with a 30 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:PSS layer was subsequently annealed in a vacuum at 140 °C for 20 min. The photoactive component containing P3HT and PCBM which had been dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1 and stirred at 70 °C for 16 h in a nitrogen filled glove box system was spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer with a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) filter (0.45 μm). Thermal treatment was performed by heating the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM device on a hotplate at 130 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. At last, the Pt film was deposited onto the P3HT:PCBM layer through the ion-beam sputtering method in a vacuum. In order to improve the performance of the photocathode of the tandem PEC cell, another two photocathodes, PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt18 and CuI/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt,10 were also prepared, respectively. In the CuI/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt photocathode, the CuI hole transport layer was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate.10 In the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt photocathode, the TiO2 was deposited between the photoactive component and Pt layer by the ion-beam sputtering method to promote the transport of electrons.18
2.3 Structural characterization
The observation of the morphology of the TiO2 sample was conducted using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi SU 8010, Japan). The average size and the distribution of IrOx nanoparticles were observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at 2θ = 20–80° with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302N) at room temperature. Before each measurement, high-purity Ar gas was purged into the electrolyte for 40 min to expel the remaining air. In the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, the TiO2 and P3HT:PCBM based photoelectrodes were directly used as the working electrodes. A Pt plate electrode and Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. LSV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Chronoamperometric measurements were performed using the same experimental setup at a constant potential. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at 0.6 V vs. RHE in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were recorded at a fixed frequency of 10 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. In the short-circuit measurement, the electrochemical workstation directly connected the two electrodes working as an ammeter to record the current signal. The two photoelectrodes were placed at both ends of the reactor as illustrated in Fig. 1. An indium-gallium alloy was applied between the photoelectrodes and the electrode holders to improve electrical conductivity. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport, Oriel, 91160, China). The light intensity was maintained at 100 mW cm−2. All the curves were recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4, which has been widely used for the P3HT:PCBM based photocathode, without iR compensation. All potentials measured were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.235 V + 0.059 pH.(1)
2.5 Photocatalytic measurements
For H2 and O2 evolution measurements, a gas-closed circulation system equipped with a vacuum line, a reaction cell and a gas sampling port was directly connected to a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2018).19 Before (60 min) and during the measurement, an Ar stream (20 mL min−1) was continuously flowed into the system to ensure complete degassing. The two photoelectrodes immersed in the electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4) were placed at both the ends of the reactor with an ion-conductive membrane in the middle of the reactor to realize macroscopic separation of H2 and O2. An indium-gallium alloy was applied between the photoelectrodes and copper wire to improve the electrical conductivity of the PEC cell. The photocathode was irradiated with simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) transmitted through the photoanode. The electrodes were encapsulated with epoxy resin. The outlet gas was analyzed every 60 min using a gas chromatograph for 5 hours.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the photoanodes
Fig. S1† shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared TiO2 NR array. The predominant diffraction peaks at 36.3°, 54.5°, 63°, and 69.1° are associated with the (101), (211), (310), and (301) reflections of the pristine TiO2 NRs, respectively. A typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the as-synthesized TiO2 NRs is illustrated in Fig. S2a,† in which the rectangular nanorods can be observed clearly. It shows that the nanorods are separated from each other and have smooth surfaces. The average side-length of the nanorods is approximately 125 nm.
Since the pristine TiO2 is not active enough for water oxidation, photoelectrode modification is necessary to realize oxygen evolution on the TiO2 photoanode and to obtain a high quality electrode with higher photogenerated carrier density, lower onset potential and smaller charge transfer resistance. In this work, the TiO2 photoanode was optimized by adsorbing cocatalyst IrOx NPs which not only served as electron sinks to accelerate charge separation, but also provided abundant active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).20,21 The TEM image of the TiO2–IrOx nanorod is shown in Fig. S2b.† It can be seen that the IrOx nanoparticles are attached to the NRs with an average diameter of 2 nm.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out to evaluate the photocurrent density and the onset potential of the photoanode. The onset potential is defined as the potential where the photocurrent reaches 50 μA cm−2 under 1 simulated sun illumination. Fig. 2a shows the LSV curves of TiO2-based photoanodes scanned positively at 50 mV s−1 scan rate under dark and illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The photocurrent density at +1.23 V vs. RHE reaches 1113 μA cm−2 and the onset potential is about +0.44 V vs. RHE for the pristine TiO2 photoanode. For the TiO2–IrOx case, a photocurrent density of 1098 μA cm−2 is produced at +1.23 V vs. RHE while the onset potential is about +0.35 V vs. RHE, which shifts negatively compared with the pristine TiO2 NRs. The fill-factor of the photocurrent increases which corresponds to the improved charge separation and enhanced surface catalytic activity of oxygen evolution.2

(b) Transient photocurrents recorded for pristine TiO2 NRs and TiO2–IrOx NRs at a constant bias of 0.43 V vs. RHE under chopped simulated irradiation. (c) M–S plots of the pristine TiO2 NR array and TiO2–IrOx NR photoanode. (d) EIS of the pristine TiO2 NR array and TiO2–IrOx NR array. 
To further reveal the effect of IrOx deposition on the TiO2 photoanode, the corresponding photocurrent response to light on-off cycling at a constant bias of 0.43 V vs. RHE was measured. The bias of 0.43 V vs. RHE is chosen because the onset potential of the TiO2–IrOx photoanode is about +0.35 V vs. RHE and the onset potential of the pristine TiO2 photoanode is about +0.44 V vs. RHE. At the bias of 0.43 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of the TiO2 photoanode does not reach 50 μA cm−2 while the photocurrent density of the TiO2–IrOx photoanode reaches a high value which provides an obvious comparison of the onset potentials of the two photoanodes. The results are shown in Fig. 2b, in which a steady and prompt photocurrent generation can be observed during on and off cycles of illumination. The photocurrent density of the TiO2–IrOx photoelectrode at 0.43 V vs. RHE is about 200 μA cm−2, which improves greatly compared with 40 μA cm−2 of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode.
The M–S plots of the two photoanodes are presented in Fig. 2c which were measured in a three-electrode cell under dark conditions. The M–S plots are used to calculate the flat band potential (Efb) and the carrier density (Nd), and describe the derivation of the capacitance of the electrodes at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.22 In Fig. 2c each sample gives a positive slope, suggesting that all of them are n-type semiconductors. The Efb of a semiconductor can be estimated by extrapolation of the linear fitting to a capacitance of zero according to the Mott–Schottky equation:23 (2)
It is clear that the flat band potential of TiO2–IrOx NRs is more negative than that of TiO2 NRs. The values of Efb for TiO2–IrOx NRs and TiO2 NRs are about −0.2 V and 0.1 V vs. RHE, respectively. According to the equation: Eb = E − Efb,(3)the applied potential determines the magnitude of band bending Eb in the semiconductor and the flat band potential Efb.24 As Efb shifts negatively, the absolute value of Eb increases because the applied potential E is always positive in the anodic water oxidation reaction. The negative shift of Efb will lead to larger band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. As a consequence, charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is promoted.25
The slope of the M–S plot is used to calculate Nd according to the equation: (4)where C is the space-charge capacity of the semiconductor, e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of TiO2, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, Nd is the carrier density, and V is the applied bias at the electrode. The smaller slope for the TiO2–IrOx NR sample reflects a higher carrier density.26,27 The electron densities of the TiO2 and TiO2–IrOx photoanodes are calculated to be 2.7 × 1016 cm−3 and 3.78 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. The carrier density in the TiO2–IrOx photoanode is increased because the recombination of the photogenerated carriers is inhibited. On one hand, the larger band bending at the TiO2–IrOx photoanode surface improves charge separation; on the other hand, the IrOx nanoparticles enhance the collection of carriers at the TiO2/IrOx interface and promote charge transfer at the IrOx/electrolyte interface which will contribute to the effective suppression of the recombination of photogenerated carriers.28
EIS provides information about the conductivity and the interfacial properties of the photoelectrodes.29 The semicircle diameter of the EIS plot equals the electron transfer resistance (Ret), which controls the electron transfer kinetics at the electrode interface.30 The EIS measurements were carried out under both dark and illumination conditions. The semicircles of EIS plots (Fig. 2d) for both TiO2–IrOx and TiO2 samples measured in the dark are much larger than those measured under illumination conditions, demonstrating that the charge-transfer resistance under illumination conditions is lower than that under dark conditions, which may be related to the higher carrier transfer mobility in the presence of light.31 In addition, the EIS plot of TiO2–IrOx NRs has a smaller diameter than that of the TiO2 NRs both under dark and illumination, which indicates a remarkably increased electrical conductivity between TiO2–IrOx NRs and the electrolyte on the electron-transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction.32 These EIS results further confirm that the incorporation of IrOx is important for extending charge carrier lifetime and inhibiting the e−/h+ pair recombination, subsequently, leading to an improved PEC performance.1
3.2 Characterization of the photocathodes
The results in Subsection 3.1 present that the onset potential of the TiO2 NR photoanode reduces significantly by IrOx modification. However, unassisted overall water splitting based on a single photoanode is still not achieved due to the demand for an external bias as shown in Fig. 2a. So it is necessary to select an appropriate photocathode to construct a Z-scheme PEC system to provide additional energy. Here, the organic photocathode P3HT:PCBM was chosen owing to its advantages of a moderate bandgap for visible-light absorption, and appropriate band edge matching with TiO2 for water reduction. Fig. S3† shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the structure of the photocathode. It can be observed that the photocathode has a well-defined layered structure and each layer is distinct and smooth. The thicknesses of the P3HT:PCBM layer and PEDOT:PSS layer are about 100 nm and 30 nm, respectively.
Because of the hydrophobicity of the organic P3HT:PCBM film which prohibits the photogenerated carriers from transferring to water, the photocatalytic efficiency of the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM photocathode will be very low. In addition, the conjugated polymers are highly sensitive to water-oxidation or photo-bleaching. So it is necessary to encapsulate the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM to prevent the exposure of the photoactive layers to oxygen and water.33 Therefore, optimization of the P3HT:PCBM photocathode for good performance and long-term photostability is necessary. In this work, Pt was used as the surface modification layer and the cocatalyst to improve the hydrophilicity of BHJ and to provide more reaction active sites for water reduction. Moreover, the Pt layer encapsulated the BHJ to reject the oxygen and water to improve the stability of P3HT:PCBM based photocathodes.

Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of the photocathodes. The maximal value of the photocurrent density of the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt photocathode is about −73 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE and the onset potential which is defined as the potential where the photocurrent density reaches −50 μA cm−2 is about +0.52 V vs. RHE. After depositing a thin layer of Pt onto the top of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ to form a PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt structure, the photocathode presents a better PEC performance. Its water reduction onset potential is increased to about +0.69 V vs. RHE and the saturated photocurrent density reaches about −240 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE.

Long-term photostability is another important criterion of a HER photocatalyst for its future practical applications.34,35 Stability tests of the organic photocathodes were carried out by chronoamperometric measurements at a constant potential of 0 V vs. RHE in a three-electrode configuration. The photostabilities of the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt and PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM photocathodes were evaluated by continuously monitoring the photocurrent over an irradiation period of 9 h. The results are presented in Fig. 3b. It is found that PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt exhibits promising stability with the photocurrent remaining at the same value for almost 8 h after a little rise in the first hour. By contrast, the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM electrode maintains its stability only in the first two hours, then degrades quickly and only maintains 31% of its initial photocurrent after the 9 h test.
The M–S measurements were applied in a three-electrode cell under dark conditions.36 As shown in Fig. 3c, the negative slopes in the linear region verify the p-type conductivity of the organic photoelectrodes. The PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt electrode exhibits an Efb of +0.69 V vs. RHE, whereas the Efb of the bare FTO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM is about +0.50 V vs. RHE. As the Efb increases positively, the absolute value of band bending increases. The larger band bending at the electrode/electrolyte interface induces faster charge separation and transport.37,38 The possibility of carrier recombination or surface trapping can also be diminished.24 Moreover, the carrier densities of the organic photoelectrodes are estimated from the slopes of the M–S plots. The Pt-loaded photoelectrode shows higher carrier density than the photoelectrode without Pt. The higher carrier density caused by the loading of Pt is attributed to the fact that the recombination of photogenerated carriers is effectively suppressed. The Pt layer not only improves the charge transport and separation at the Pt/electrolyte interface, but also serves as electron sinks to effectively extract the electrons from the LUMO of P3HT:PCBM to restrain electron–hole recombination in the inside of the organic semiconductor.39 The loading of cocatalyst Pt changes the surface electrochemical properties of the photocathode and increases active catalytic sites for the HER.
EIS measurements of the photocathodes were performed at a bias of 0.6 V vs. RHE. The P3HT:PCBM photocathode displays a larger semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 3d), corresponding to the larger resistance of direct charge transfer between the P3HT:PCBM and electrolyte.40 In contrast, the P3HT:PCBM-Pt photocathode exhibits a smaller semicircle. The significantly diminished resistance at the P3HT:PCBM-Pt photocathode/electrolyte interface indicates that the decorated Pt on the surface of the P3HT:PCBM electrode not only acts as an effective mediator, which greatly enhances the charge transfer kinetics and the charge transfer rate, but also enables effective electrical integration to minimize parasitic ohmic losses between the illuminated P3HT:PCBM-Pt electrode and electrolyte, leading to the fast reduction of H+ to H2.41
3.3 Wire-linked photoelectrodes for water splitting
By independently characterizing the photoanode and photocathode, the expected performance of this Z-scheme PEC system without external bias can be estimated. The intersection of the J–V curves of the two photoelectrodes predicts the photocatalytic performance of the tandem PEC cell.42Fig. 4a shows the J–V curve intersection of the photoanode and photocathode. The intersection of +0.47 V vs. RHE and +215 μA cm−2 predicts that when the two photoelectrodes are connected in series, immersed into the electrolyte and illuminated, a photocurrent would flow from P3HT:PCBM to TiO2 which would induce solar-driven overall water splitting without sacrificial reagents, redox couples and any other external energy supply.2

Experimentally, to further verify the overall water splitting effect of the PEC cell, a prolonged J–t test for 9 h was carried out by directly linking the TiO2–IrOx photoanode and the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt photocathode with a copper wire in the tandem configuration. The measurement was conducted in a non-sacrificial environment and without external bias. The J–t curve of the PEC cell is shown in Fig. 4b. The photocurrent density rises in the first 2 h from 110 μA cm−2 to 150 μA cm−2 and then keeps constant at an average value of 145 μA cm−2 in the remaining 7 h, which indicates that the PEC cell has a good stability under continuous illumination. The solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency is calculated to be ∼0.16%. It should be noticed that because of the series resistance between the copper wire and the FTO substrate as well as the solution resistance, this photocurrent density is lower than the J–V intersection of 215 μA cm−2 shown in Fig. 4a which is the photocurrent density under the ideal conditions.
Consequently, an UV-vis light driven overall water splitting PEC cell has been realized in the electrolyte. Fig. 5 displays H2 and O2 gas evolution as a function of illumination time during a 5 h testing period. The average H2 and O2 evolution rates are about 2.38 μmol h−1 and 1.16 μmol h−1, respectively, with the hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio approaching 2:1. Moreover, the charge-to-chemical faradaic efficiency is calculated to be 88.7%. These results confirm that overall water splitting in the electrolyte can be realized by separating the photoanode and photocathode and replacing the ohmic contact layer with a copper wire in a Z-scheme configuration. Meanwhile, the undesirable back-reaction is limited. It is worth noting that coupling the most representative inorganic photocatalyst TiO2 and the most considered organic material P3HT:PCBM together to form a PEC cell for water splitting has been seldom reported.

Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram of the band edge positions of the photoelectrodes and photogenerated carrier transport process in the PEC system. The LUMO of the organic semiconductor is more negative than the H+/H2 potential, so the photoelectrons with sufficient energy in the P3HT:PCBM will be used to reduce water without the additional assistance by the external voltage.

Through the valid matching of the photoelectrodes, the carriers can be effectively separated and transferred by the energy band alignment. The energy band gradient in the separated electrodes prompts the photogenerated electrons in TiO2 to migrate to the external circuit and then move to the HOMO of the PEDOT:PSS layer to recombine with the holes of the P3HT:PCBM. Meanwhile, the holes in TiO2 and the electrons in the P3HT:PCBM BHJ migrate to the electrode–electrolyte interface to realize PEC water splitting which is in good accordance with the Z-scheme concept.43 As a result, unassisted overall solar water splitting based on TiO2 and the organic material is realized with spatially separated H2 and O2 evolution in the absence of external bias. This system makes full use of sunlight, maintains the overpotential of photogenerated minority carriers in each photoelectrode and spatially separates the products of H2 and O2.
3.4 Further improvement of the PEC performance
According to the above results, the organic–inorganic hybrid PEC cell has realized spontaneous photocatalytic overall water splitting successfully. However, the final photocurrent density is only 145 μA cm−2 and the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency is only ∼0.16%, and one important reason for this is that, based on the J–V curves in Fig. 4a, the saturated photocurrent density of the organic photocathode is small which limits the overall PEC performance. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the photocurrent density of the organic photocathode. Some previous reports have shown that via the modification and optimization, the photocurrent density of P3HT:PCBM-based photocathodes can rise to the level of mA cm−2.10,18,44 So at the end of this work, on the basis of the previous reports, we have made some effort to optimize the photocathode. Firstly, TiO2 was used as the interfacial modification layer to improve the electrical conductivity of the BHJ. Secondly, CuI was used to replace PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer. As a result, two new kinds of photocathodes, PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt18 and CuI/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt,10 were obtained. The PEC performances of the individual photocathodes and the whole Z-scheme systems are shown in Fig. S4 and S5,† respectively. The relevant discussions are presented in Section S2 in the ESI.† It shows that although the photocurrent densities of these two photocathodes have been improved greatly, the onset potential and the photocurrent densities around the onset potential are still low. So the maximum operating current density (Jop) is still small for the TiO2–IrOx–PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt and TiO2–IrOx–CuI/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2–Pt PEC cells according to the low intersections of the J–V curves of the photoelectrodes in Fig. S5.† It can be predicted that by further improving the onset potential of the organic photocathode, reducing the onset potential of the photoanode, and decreasing the series resistance and the solution resistance, the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of the Z-scheme system will be greatly improved in the future.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a tandem PEC cell with an IrOx modified TiO2 NR photoanode and a PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM-Pt photocathode has been developed for spontaneous overall water splitting without external bias. The average H2 and O2 evolution rates of this system are about 2.38 μmol h−1 and 1.16 μmol h−1, respectively with a charge-to-chemical Faradaic efficiency of 88.7%. The hydrogen and oxygen obtained in this system are separated without further refinement. This kind of spatially separated configuration simplifies the fabrication process and better separates the products compared with an integrated all-solid-state Z-scheme device, thus being more suitable for future applications. Moreover, introducing an organic semiconductor into the Z-scheme system further expands the application of organic semiconductors in the field of photocatalysis which provides more choices for p-type semiconductors.
