    , Accepted 14th March 2018First published on 15th March 2018AbstractHerein, ternary nickel cobalt selenide (NixCoySe) films with controllable stoichiometric ratios were prepared in situ on a conductive substrate. When the total amounts of metal salts and selenium are kept constant, the stoichiometric ratio of NixCoySe nanoparticles in situ growing on the conductive substrate can be controlled by adjusting the feed ratios of metal salts in the reaction solution. When the in situ-grown NixCoySe films are directly used as counter electrodes of quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (QSDSSCs), the electrocatalytic properties of NixCoySe and the corresponding photovoltaic performances depend on the Ni/Co molar ratio. The QSDSSC device with the Ni0.12Co0.80Se counter electrode achieves the best power conversion efficiency of 8.61% among those with the counter electrode at other stoichiometric ratios. Impressively, the ternary Ni0.12Co0.80Se is superior to the binary selenides and the Pt control in terms of both electrocatalytic activity and solar cell performance; this is attributed to the synergetic effect between nickel and cobalt atoms in the ternary compound.
Introduction
As a kind of third-generation solar cell, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising alternative to the traditional silicon-based solar cells due to its simple manufacturing processes with low-cost instruments and theoretically high power conversion efficiency.1,2 As an essential part of DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) catalyzes the reduction of I3− to I− in the electrolyte to close the electric circuit.3,4 The noble metal platinum (Pt) with outstanding electrocatalytic activity is usually used for laboratory research of DSSCs; however, its low abundance ratio in the earth and poor electrochemical stability against iodine-based electrolytes seriously restrict the large-scale application of DSSCs. Therefore, development of novel CE materials with low-cost, high electrocatalytic performance, and good electrochemical stability is a big challenge in the field of DSSCs. In the past few years, many kinds of low-cost CE materials, such as noble metals and alloys, carbon materials, inorganic compounds, conductive polymers and their composites, etc., have been studied to replace Pt.5–9 Among these materials, inorganic compounds, such as oxides,10,11 carbides,12,13 nitrides,14 sulfides,15,16 selenides,17–19 and so on,20,21 have diversity and morphology controllability, which are propitious to improve the electrocatalytic performance.
Since their first application as CEs of DSSCs, metal selenides have gained significant attention as CE materials of DSSCs due to their remarkable electrocatalytic performance.17 Since multinary chalcogenides possess higher electrical conductivity than binary chalcogenides, the former are more advantageous than the latter as electrocatalysts.22–24 Furthermore, the co-existence of two or more different cations in one crystal structure can offer rich active sites for electrocatalytic reactions.25 Therefore, multinary chalcogenides have, in-principle, higher electrocatalytic performance than the relevant binary compounds. However, only a few multinary selenides have been reported as CEs of DSSCs, and their performances are still not satisfactory (Table S1, ESI†).26–35 In addition, some of these reported ternary selenides are basically a mixture of relevant binary selenides according to their hybrid crystal structures.31,35 Therefore, it is still a big challenge to develop single-phase ternary selenide CE materials that have excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability.
In this study, ternary nickel cobalt selenide nanoparticles with different stoichiometric ratios have been synthesized through in situ growth on the FTO surface by tuning the atomic ratio of nickel and cobalt, and the influence of the Ni/Co molar ratio in NixCoySe on the electrocatalytic activity and photovoltaic performance for quasi-solid-state DSSCs (QSDSSCs) has also been studied. The results indicate that the Ni0.12Co0.80Se electrode possesses highest electrocatalytic activity among the relevant ternary and binary selenides. Therefore, the QSDSSC based on the Ni0.12Co0.80Se CE achieves the highest PCE (8.61%) among those based on other investigated CEs.
Experimental

In situ synthesis of NixCoySe films
Herein, 0.2 mmol SeO2, a mmol Ni(Ac)2·4H2O, and b mmol Co(Ac)2·4H2O (a + b = 0.15, a:b = 1:5, 1:2, and 2:1) were dissolved in 10 mL of benzylalcohol under ultrasonification; the mixture was then transferred to a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. A piece of cleaned FTO was immersed in the solution and placed against the wall of the Teflon liner with the conductive face down. When FTO was placed with the conductive face downwards, the sample could grow spontaneously on the FTO surface; this was crucial to form a uniform and robust film. However, when FTO was placed with the conductive face upwards, the film could be formed by spontaneous growth and gravitational deposition as well. In this case, the formed film was not uniform and had weak adsorption on the FTO surface. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 20 h followed by natural cooling to RT. The NixCoySe film grown on the FTO surface was taken out from the autoclave and washed several times with ethanol and acetonitrile followed by drying with nitrogen gas. The precipitate in the autoclave was filtered and washed several times with ethanol, and the powder was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. For comparison, CoSe and NiSe nanoparticles were also prepared via the same solvothermal method. Typically, 0.16 mmol Co(Ac)2·4H2O and 0.2 mmol SeO2 reacted in 10 mL benzylalcohol to form CoSe, and 2 mmol Ni(Ac)2·4H2O and 0.2 mmol SeO2 reacted in 10 mL benzylalcohol to yield NiSe.
Fabrication of QSDSSCs
Herein, 17 μm-thick TiO2 films containing bottom transparent (12 μm) and top scattering (5 μm) layers were fabricated on FTO glass substrates via a screen-printing method. The TiO2 films were sintered at 500 °C for 1 h, which were then treated with an aqueous TiCl4 solution (0.05 M) at 70 °C for 30 min followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 films were immersed in a solution of N719 dye (0.3 mM in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol with a volume ratio of 1:1) for 24 h. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was attached to the CE using a 30 μm-thick hot-melt Surlyn film as the spacer, which was then sealed up by hot pressing. The gel electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, 0.6 M DMPII, and 5 wt% PVDF-HFP in 3-methoxypropionitrile) was heated at 100 °C to form a hot gel solution and then injected into the internal space of the device through pre-drilled holes on the back of the CE. Finally, the holes were sealed with a piece of Surlyn film covered with thin cover slips under heat.
Characterizations
The atomic ratios and loading amounts of the as-prepared CE materials were determined via inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectra (ICP-AES, Thermo Electron Corp. Adv. ER/S). The crystal structures of the as-prepared metal selenides were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The morphology of the as-prepared metal selenides in situ grown on the FTO substrate was examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The microstructure and crystal structure of the as-prepared metal selenides were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The chemical composition and the valence states of elements in the in situ-grown metal selenides on the FTO substrate were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra Dld). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out via a CHI660E electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode system with the as-prepared CE film as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the CE, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The electrolyte for CV contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 in anhydrous acetonitrile. The scan rate was fixed at 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization were performed using an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany) by assembling a dummy cell with two identical as-prepared CEs (CE/electrolyte/CE) separated by a 30 μm-thick Surlyn film. The active area of the dummy cell is 0.36 cm2. EIS spectra were obtained in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 300 kHz at a 0 V bias and an amplitude of 10 mV. The Tafel polarization measurements were performed in the voltage range from −1 V to 1 V at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs were obtained using a Keithley 2420 source meter under simulated AM1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2) from an AAA solar simulator (Newport-94043A). A black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was applied on the surface of QSDSSCs to avoid stray light completely. The incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the solar cells were obtained using an SM-250 system (Bunkoh-Keiki, Japan).
Results and discussion
Composition, structure, and morphology
The compositions of all the as-prepared metal selenides were determined by ICP-AES. The atomic ratios of CoSe and NiSe films in situ grown on FTO were determined to be Co:Se = 0.93:1 and Ni:Se = 1.07:1, close to the stoichiometric ratios of CoSe and NiSe, respectively. The precipitate samples of CoSe and NiSe have the atomic ratios of Co:Se = 0.94:1 and Ni:Se = 1.06:1, which agree well with those of the in situ grown films, respectively. This indicates that the in situ-grown film on FTO and the yielded precipitate powder in the autoclave have the same chemical composition for both CoSe and NiSe. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared CoSe and NiSe powder samples are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The XRD diffraction peaks can be well indexed to Freboldite CoSe (JCPDS No. 89-2004) and Sederholmite NiSe (JCPDS No. 65-9451). Very close XRD peak positions for CoSe and NiSe indicate a similar crystalline structure for them.
The ICP-AES results show that the atomic ratios of the precipitated NixCoySe samples are similar to the feed ratios of raw materials (Table S2, ESI†). Interestingly, the in situ-grown NixCoySe samples exhibit significantly different stoichiometric ratios as compared to the precipitated samples (Table S2, ESI†). For example, when the feed ratio of Ni:Co:Se is 1:2:4, the atomic ratio is 0.24:0.54:1 (= 1:2.3:4.2) for the precipitated sample, but the atomic ratio changes to 0.12:0.80:1 (= 0.5:3.2:4) for the in situ-grown film. As compared to the case of the precipitated sample, the Ni content decreased, whereas the Co content increased significantly for the in situ-grown film. Even when the feed ratio of Ni:Co increased to 2:1, the Ni content was still lower than the Co content for the in situ-grown sample (Table S2, ESI†). This result shows that there is a competition between Ni and Co ions in the reaction with selenide ions during film formation. Co ions exhibit higher reactive activity than Ni ions in the formation of ternary metal selenides on the FTO substrate. For all the in situ-grown samples, the atomic ratios of M:Se (M = Ni + Co) are close to 1:1, which suggest that the as-prepared ternary nickel cobalt selenide is formed by replacing one metal with the other in the crystalline structure of the binary selenide. This can be verified by comparing the XRD patterns for the ternary and binary metal selenides (Fig. S1, ESI†). The almost same XRD pattern for them indicates that they have the same crystalline structure.

Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of CoSe (Fig. 1a and b), NiSe (Fig. 1c and d), and Ni0.12Co0.80Se (Fig. 1e and f) in situ grown on the FTO substrates with different magnifications. In the low-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1a, c and f), it can be seen that all the as-prepared samples exhibit a spherical nanoparticle morphology. The nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the FTO surface without obvious aggregation. The enlarged SEM images (Fig. 1b, d and e) reveal that the diameters are 100–200 nm for CoSe nanoparticles, 200–300 nm for NiSe nanoparticles, and 100–200 nm for Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticles. The EDS spectrum (Fig. S3a, ESI†) reveals that the Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticles are composed of Ni, Co, and Se, and the elemental mapping (Fig. S3b–d, ESI†) illustrates the homogeneous distribution of Ni, Co, and Se in the Ni0.12Co0.80Se film in situ grown on the FTO substrate surface.

The morphologies and crystalline structures of the as-prepared metal selenide nanoparticles were further characterized through TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, the CoSe nanoparticles have hollow structures with sizes of 50–100 nm, which are composed of many small nanoparticles with an average diameter of 30 nm, agreeing well with the previous study.36 Clear lattice fringes shown in the HRTEM image of CoSe nanoparticles (Fig. 2b) correspond to an interplanar distance of 0.276 nm for the (101) plane of Freboldite CoSe (JCPDS No. 89-2004). As shown in Fig. 2c, the as-prepared NiSe exhibits solid spheres with sizes of 200–300 nm. The HRTEM image of NiSe nanoparticles (Fig. 2d) shows clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.319 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of Sederholmite NiSe (JCPDS No. 65-9451). Fig. 2e shows that Ni0.12Co0.80Se has a solid sphere morphology with diameter in the range of 100–200 nm. The HRTEM image of Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticles (Fig. 2f and g) shows lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.319 nm, 0.279 nm, 0.208 nm, and 0.183 nm, which can be readily indexed to the (100), (101), (102), and (110) crystal planes of Freboldite CoSe (JCPDS No. 89-2004) or Sederholmite NiSe (JCPDS No. 65-9451), respectively. The corresponding SAED pattern in Fig. 2h shows several well-defined diffraction rings, suggesting the polycrystalline nature of the Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticles. The corresponding crystal planes of the diffraction rings are consistent with those obtained for the as-prepared CoSe nanoparticles and NiSe nanoparticles (Fig. S1, ESI†). These results indicate that the in situ-grown ternary nickel cobalt selenides (Ni0.12Co0.80Se) have a crystalline structure consistent with that of the relevant binary selenides (CoSe and NiSe). Thus, based on the XRD results, it was concluded that the ternary nickel cobalt selenides were formed on the basis of binary selenides (CoSe or NiSe), where some atoms of one metal element were replaced by those of other metal elements. Therefore, the formed ternary metal selenide maintains the original crystalline structure of the binary selenide; thus, the role of Se should be same in these binary and ternary metal selenides. Since these ternary and binary metal selenides differed in the type of metal, we herein explored the synergetic effect between Co and Ni.

The element valence states of the metal selenides in situ grown on the FTO substrate were analyzed by XPS, and all the spectra were calibrated by setting the C 1s peak to 284.5 eV. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Co 2p spectra of CoSe have four peaks at 777.5 eV, 780.7 eV, 792.5 eV, and 796.6 eV, which are assigned to Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2, and Co2+ 2p1/2,37 respectively. The presence of Co3+ is attributed to the oxidation of Co2+ on the surface. Moreover, two satellite peaks marked as Sat. appear in the XPS spectrum.37 The electron binding energy of Co 2p (Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2) for Ni0.12Co0.80Se shows a ∼0.3 eV increase as compared to those in CoSe. As shown in Fig. 3b, the peaks at 855.6 eV and 873.3 eV correspond to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2 for NiSe,38 respectively, indicating that the valence state of Ni is 2+ in NiSe. Fig. 3c displays the Ni 2p XPS spectrum for Ni0.12Co0.80Se. The peak fitting analysis in Fig. 3c reveals that the chemical species of Ni can be identified as Ni2+ 2p3/2 (855.3 eV), Ni3+ 2p3/2 (856.5 eV), Ni2+ 2p1/2 (873.0 eV), and Ni3+ 2p1/2 (874.3 eV). The electron binding energy (855.3 and 873.0 eV) of Ni2+ in Ni0.12Co0.80Se shows a decrease of 0.3 eV as compared to that for NiSe (855.6 and 873.3 eV), respectively. The red shift in the electron binding energy for Co 2p and the blue shift in the electron binding energy for Ni 2p in Ni0.12Co0.80Se as compared to those in the relevant binary selenides (CoSe and NiSe) signify electron transfer between Co and Ni atoms in the ternary compound39,40 that is beneficial to produce a synergetic effect between two metal atoms in the ternary nickel cobalt selenides. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Se 3d peaks are split into two peaks at 53.9 eV and 54.7 eV, which are attributed to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, reflecting the existence of Se2−. The broad peak at 61.9 eV is related to the high oxidation state (4+) of Se in SeO2 on the surface.41 Moreover, the peaks located at 59.0 eV and 60.0 eV are attributed to Co 3p3/2 and Co 3p1/2, respectively.41 The XPS analysis indicates that the surface of Ni0.12Co0.80Se is mainly distributed with Co2+, Co3+, Ni2+, Ni3+, and Se2−.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared CE materials on the quasi-solid-state electrolyte and the electron transfer process at the CE/electrolyte interface, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization of the symmetric cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) fabricated with two identical electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Nyquist plots for all CEs show two semicircles. According to the Randles-type circuit (inset of Fig. 4a), the intercept on the real axis in the high frequency region represents the series resistance (Rs), the left arc appearing in the high frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE), and the right arc located in the low-frequency region reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte. The performance parameters determined by fitting the impedance spectra using the Z-view software are listed in Table 1. Generally, Rs reveals the total resistance including the intrinsic resistance of the FTO substrate and the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/FTO interface. The Rs value of CoSe (3.0 Ω cm2) is higher than that of Pt (2.0 Ω cm2) and NiSe (2.1 Ω cm2); this indicates that the electric contact between NiSe (or Pt) and FTO is better than that between CoSe and FTO. Furthermore, the Rs value (Table 1) decreases with an increase in the Ni:Co atomic ratio for the as-prepared ternary nickel cobalt selenides (NixCoySe); this indicates that the presence of Ni is likely able to improve the contact between the CE material and the FTO substrate. The Rs value of Ni0.12Co0.80Se is 2.3 Ω cm2, which is between the Rs value of NiSe (2.1 Ω cm2) and CoSe (3.0 Ω cm2). The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface is directly related to the electrocatalytic activity of CE materials; the lower Rct value represents higher electrocatalytic activity of CE materials and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1, the Rct values of the as-prepared CEs decrease in the order of Pt (1.5 Ω cm2) > NiSe (1.0 Ω cm2) > CoSe (0.3 Ω cm2) = Ni0.07Co0.91Se (0.3 Ω cm2) > Ni0.29Co0.63Se (0.2 Ω cm2) > Ni0.12Co0.80Se (0.1 Ω cm2). It is concluded that the ternary nickel cobalt selenides (NixCoySe) have higher electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− than the binary CoSe and NiSe CEs, and CoSe is better than NiSe in electrocatalytic performance. For different NixCoySe CEs (Fig. 4b and Table 1), the Rct value is 0.3 Ω cm2 when the Ni:Co atomic ratio is 0.07:0.91 (= 1:13.2), which is reduced significantly to 0.1 Ω cm2 when the Ni:Co molar ratio increases to 0.12:0.80 (= 1:6.7), but increases to 0.2 Ω cm2 when the Ni:Co molar ratio is further increased to 0.29:0.63 (= 1:2.2). This result indicates that there is an optimal Ni:Co atomic ratio in the ternary selenide for the electrocatalytic performance, and the Ni0.12Co0.80Se (Ni:Co = 1:6.7) CE exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity among various stoichiometric ratios.

It is interesting to explore the influence of Ni:Co atomic ratio on the photovoltaic performance of various NixCoySe applied as the CEs of QSDSSCs. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of QSDSSCs based on thin TiO2 films (5 μm thick), and the photovoltaic performance parameters, such as short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†) for a clear comparison. For the two extreme cases, CoSe is superior to NiSe in terms of PCE (Fig. 4c). As compared to the case of CoSe, the PCE begins to increase at the Ni:Co atomic ratio of 0.07:0.91 and reaches highest at a Ni:Co ratio of 0.12:0.80 for NixCoySe. However, the PCE begins to decrease from the maximum point with a further increase in the Ni:Co ratio and declines to the lowest value for NiSe (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that Ni0.12Co0.80Se is the best CE among these electrodes in terms of photovoltaic performance. This indicates that there is a best synergetic effect between Co and Ni. The basic reason for the best atomic ratio is not clear to date. However, theoretical calculations on the interactions between Co and Ni may uncover the cause behind the optimal atomic ratio, which deserves further investigation. A comparison of Fig. 4b and c reveals that there is an inverse correlation between Rct and PCE.

Fig. 4d shows the Tafel polarization curves for the symmetrical cells based on Pt, CoSe, NiSe, and ternary metal selenides. In the polarized region, the steeper slope for the anodic or cathodic branches implies a higher charge exchange current density (J0). It is apparent from Table 1 that J0 follows the order Ni0.12Co0.80Se (22.8 mA cm−2) > Ni0.29Co0.63Se (21.5 mA cm−2) > Ni0.07Co0.91Se (20.7 mA cm−2) ≈ CoSe (20.5 mA cm−2) > NiSe (13.3 mA cm−2) > Pt (11.9 mA cm−2), indicating that Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticles have the highest electrocatalytic activity. J0 is inversely proportional to Rct obtained from the EIS spectra based on the relationship of J0 = (R × T)/(n × F × Rct), where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n (n = 2) is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, and F is the Faraday's constant. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity sequence derived from Tafel polarization agrees well with that obtained from the EIS result.
The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CE materials was further evaluated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in a three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 5, all CV curves of the as-prepared CEs have two pairs of redox peaks. The left and right pairs correspond to the reactions expressed by eqn (1) and (2), respectively. The peak-to-peak separation (Epp) and the peak current densities for the left pair peaks are employed to evaluate the electrocatalytic activities of CE materials. A good electrocatalyst has a lower Epp value and higher peak current density and vice versa.17 As observed from Epp and peak current, the electrocatalytic performance sequence derived from the CV data is consistent with the EIS result. The Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticle CEs exhibit the narrowest Epp value of 0.190 V (Fig. 5 and Table 1) and highest peak current densities (Fig. 5) among these CEs. The abovementioned results clearly indicate that the Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticle is the best electrocatalyst among these materials. I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)

Electrochemical stability is an important parameter to evaluate the application potential of CE materials. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the change tendency of impedance spectra for the symmetric cells subjected to sequential scans of CV and EIS for 15 cycles. After conducting the CV–EIS scans for 15 times, the Rct value of Pt CE increases from 1.5 to 4.1 Ω cm2 due to iodine corrosion (Fig. S4a, ESI†).17,19 Fig. S4b (ESI†) shows the corresponding CV plot, where a significant drop in current is observed. However, the Rct value only increases by 0.04 Ω cm2 for the Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticle CE under the same conditions (Fig. S4c, ESI†). The corresponding CV curves shown in Fig. S4d (ESI†) reveal a small decrease in current. The electrochemical stability of the electrodes is also tested in a three-electrode system, and 10-cycle CV curves are displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The Ni0.12Co0.80Se electrode yields a smaller current decrease than the Pt electrode after 10-cycle scans. These results indicate that the Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticle CE has stronger resistance to corrosion by the iodine-based electrolyte and exhibits better electrochemical stability than the Pt CE.

Fig. 6a shows the J–V curves of the QSDSSCs based on different CE materials and thick TiO2 photoanodes under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), and the performance parameters with standard deviation errors are summarized in Table 2. The loading amounts of CoSe, NiSe, and Ni0.12Co0.80Se on the FTO substrate were determined to be 12.5 μg cm−2, 16.4 μg cm−2, and 14.0 μg cm−2, respectively. The CoSe CE generates a higher FF of 0.70 and PCE of 8.01% than the NiSe CEs (FF = 0.68 and PCE = 7.95%) due to the higher electrocatalytic activity on the quasi-solid-state electrolyte. As compared to the binary CoSe and NiSe CEs, the ternary metal selenides produce higher PCE due to the lower Rct. Among these CEs, the Ni0.12Co0.80Se CE yields the highest PCE of 8.61% (Voc = 762 mV, Jsc = 15.80 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.71). Since CoSe is better than NiSe, the photovoltaic performance for the ternary Ni0.12Co0.80Se is expected to be between the two binary selenides considering their identical crystal structure and similar loading amount. However, this is not the case. The ternary Ni0.12Co0.80Se achieves better solar cell performance than the relevant binary selenides. This is attributed to the synergetic effect between the Ni and Co atoms in the crystal structure, where electron transfer between the two metal atoms, as revealed from the XPS result, can provide more active sites for electrocatalysis and is conducive to achieve the electrochemical performance. For this reason, the ternary Ni0.12Co0.80Se possesses higher electrocatalytic activity and better photovoltaic performance than each binary metal selenide.

Fig. 6b displays the IPCE spectra of the QSDSSCs based on the as-prepared CEs. All the IPCE spectra exhibit similar shape and peak position (530 nm) due to the same photoanode for all the DSSC devices. The IPCE sequence in the visible region is consistent with the order of Jsc obtained under 1 sun illumination.

Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the photovoltaic performance parameters for QSDSSC based on Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticle CE soaked under one sun for more than 1500 h. During the first 96 h, all parameters remained almost constant. Upon further increase in the illumination time, the Voc gradually increased and reached 809 mV after 1512 h illumination. By contrast, Jsc decreased with the illumination time and dropped to 13.70 mA cm−2 after 1512 h of illumination. FF showed a slight increase with illumination time and achieved 0.73 at 1248 h. The increase in FF with time is attributed to the improved infiltration of the quasi-solid-state electrolyte into the pores of TiO2. The final PCE of 8.04% still remained 93.4% of the initial efficiency after 1512 h of one sun soaking; this indicated good long-term stability for the QSDSSC device based on the Ni0.12Co0.80Se nanoparticle CE, which was very important for practical applications.

Conclusions
Ternary NixCoySe nanoparticle films with controllable stoichiometric ratios were prepared though in situ growth on the FTO substrate by a facile one-step solvothermal method, which were directly used as CEs of QSDSSCs. The electrocatalytic activity and photovoltaic performance of the selenides depend on the Ni:Co molar ratio. Ni0.12Co0.80Se with a Ni:Co ratio of 0.12:0.80 achieves the best performance among the studied metal selenides. The electron transfer between nickel and cobalt atoms in the Ni0.12Co0.80Se crystal structure produces more electrocatalytic sites and causes a synergetic effect, which accounts for its higher performance than the binary CoSe and NiSe. The QSDSSC device based on the Ni0.12Co0.80Se CE yields a remarkable PCE of 8.61%, which is higher than those obtained for the devices based on binary CoSe (8.01%) and NiSe (7.95%) CE and that of the Pt control (7.82%). The ternary Ni0.12Co0.80Se CE not only has good electrochemical stability but also exhibits good long-term stability in the solar cell device. These results are helpful for composition optimization of the ternary metal selenides towards higher electrocatalytic and photovoltaic performance. Our finding sheds light on why the ternary metal selenides are better than the corresponding binary metal selenides in terms of photovoltaic performance.
