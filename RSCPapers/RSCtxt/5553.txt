    , Accepted 25th January 2022First published on 26th January 2022AbstractIndium selenides (InSe and In2Se3) have garnered enormous interest owing to their favourable carrier mobility and high photoresponsivities, exhibiting great application potential in high performance photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. Selective synthesis of InSe and In2Se3 materials from the same molecular precursor is a challenging task. In this study, we prepared and characterized an air and moisture stable tris(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidylselenolato)indium(III) complex, as a single source molecular precursor, to synthesize stoichiometric indium selenides (InSe and In2Se3) in the nano-regime with precise control, through proper choice of the reaction solvents. The crystal structure, phase purity and composition of the materials were determined by pXRD and EDS analysis, whereas the electron microscopic studies revealed that the reaction conditions have a profound effect on the morphology of the nanostructures. The UV-DRS analysis showed a blue shift relative to the bulk band gap and falls in the range suitable for solar cell applications. Finally, efficient photoresponsitivity was achieved in the as-prepared cubic InSe and hexagonal In2Se3 nanocrystal-based prototype devices.
1. Introduction
Owing to the presence of finite band gaps, two dimensional layered metal chalcogenides have been extensively investigated as suitable alternatives to graphene in flexible nanoelectronic devices.1 The presence of a band gap, which graphene is devoid of, is crucial for achieving a high ON/OFF switching ratio in photo-devices.2 In this category, 2-D transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively explored and have attracted significant interest from researchers due to their promising optoelectronic properties.3 A recent addition to the family of van der Waals layered two dimensional metal chalcogenides are indium selenides, which possess unique optoelectronic and photo-physical properties, and excellent non-linear effects.4 Unlike layered transition metal chalcogenides, indium selenides possess higher carrier mobilities and high photoresponsivities.5 Furthermore, contrary to transition metal dichalcogenides which possess a direct band gap, indium selenides feature both indirect and direct band gaps depending upon the thickness of the nanosheets.6
The physical characteristics of indium selenides are a function of their intrinsic structural features, including composition and phases. Indium selenides exist in different compositions depending upon the In/Se stoichiometric ratios, such as InSe, In4Se3, In6Se7, In3Se4 and In2Se3. Moreover, different crystal structures and phases may exist for the same stoichiometric ratio, for instance, In2Se3 and InSe crystallize in rhombohedral and hexagonal phases.7 Besides this, InSe also acquires a cubic phase which is quite rare.8 The paucity of reports on cubic InSe, both in the bulk and nano domain arises from the synthetic difficulty originating from the limited accessibility of cubic InSe in the In–Se phase diagram. The band gaps of In2Se3 and InSe lie in the range of 1.28 to 1.5 eV with an electron mobility close to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, which makes them suitable for optoelectronic devices.9 The anisotropic bonding characteristics, comprising strong intra-layer covalent bonding between In and Se and van der Waals inter layer interaction, makes them favourable for thermoelectric applications.7 Besides this, InSe and In2Se3 exhibit a plethora of other interesting properties, like ferroelectricity,10 phase changes for data storage11 and suitability as anode materials for lithium ion batteries.4b
In view of these exciting properties and applications, a number of strategies have been developed to access various stoichiometries of indium selenide. These include conventional solid state synthesis,12 physical vapour deposition,13 chemical vapour deposition14 and the liquid exfoliation method.4b However, these methods rely on harsh growth conditions, high temperature and complicated craftsmanship. Another attractive strategy is colloidal chemistry, which offers a low temperature route to nanomaterials.15 It comprises a dual source route and single source molecular precursor (SSP) route. Preformed bonds between the desirable elements in the single source molecular precursor route often provide better control over the stoichiometry and lead to materials with better phase purity and lower defect concentration in comparison to the dual source route. However, the achievement of this approach has been limited by the non-availability of suitable precursors. To date, only a handful of molecular precursors have been developed for the preparation of indium selenide structures. For instance, Gysling and Wernberg utilized Me2InSePh for the deposition of an In2Se3 thin film, which was found to be contaminated with amorphous selenium, whereas Cheon et al. employed [In(SeC(SiMe3)3)3] to deposit hexagonal In2Se3.16 Different groups have employed pyridyl selenolate-based complexes of In(III) to obtain In2Se3.17 O’Brien et al. have successfully prepared hexagonal InSe quantum dots under different reaction conditions using tris(diethyldiselenocarbamato)indium(III) and diisopropyldiselenophosphinatoindium(III) complexes.18 In another report, Nockemann and co-workers utilized a diphenyl diselenide precursor for the synthesis of In2Se3 without the use of a capping agent to arrest the growth of the nanocrystals.19 In a recent study, Dey and co-workers have explored a coordination polymer of indium and copper selenolates for the preparation of the respective metal selenides.20 Considering the advantages that SSPs provide in material synthesis and the dearth of the same for indium selenides provides ample scope for the quest for suitable SSPs. Previously, our group has successfully demonstrated the utility of a 5-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate complex of In(III) for the preparation of the rare cubic phase of InSe.21 However, producing phase pure and highly photoresponsive In2Se3 and InSe from the same SSP is a dream not yet realized.
In this work, we present for the first time ever, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, a molecular precursor: tris(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidylselenolato)indium(III), In(Sepym(Me-4,6)2)3, which upon thermolysis, leads to the formation of highly photo-responsive cubic InSe and hexagonal In2Se3 with precise control. Utilization of this precursor paves the way for a robust synthetic route that demonstrates control over the composition of the indium selenide nanostructures through proper choice of a high boiling-point solvent. The results of this work are described herein.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
InCl3, oleylamine (OAm), 1-octadecene (ODE), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) and analytical grade solvents were procured from commercial sources. bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidyl)diselenide ([Sepym(Me-4,6)2]2); 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 2.37 (s, Me); 6.71 (s, CH-5). 13C{1H} NMR (CDCl3) δ: 23.7 (Me); 117.2 (CH-5); 165.7 (C-2); 167.5(C-4,6). 77Se{1H} NMR (CDCl3) δ: 486 ppm) was prepared according to the literature method.22 Elemental analyses were carried out on a Thermo Fischer Flash EA-1112 CHNS analyser. The 1H, 13C{1H} and 77Se{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance-II NMR spectrometer operating at 300, 75.47 and 57.24 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are relative to the internal chloroform peak for the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra and external Ph2Se2 (δ: 463 ppm relative to Me2Se) in CDCl3 for the77Se{1H} NMR spectra.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Nitzsch STA 409 PC-Luxx TG-DTA instrument, which was calibrated with CaC2O4·H2O. The TG curves were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of argon. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Philips PW-1820 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. Optical diffuse reflectance measurements in the range of 200–1100 nm (1.12 eV to 6.2 eV) were performed on a JASCO V-670 two-beam spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance (DR) attachment consisting of an integration sphere coated with BaSO4, which was used as a reference material. Measured reflectance data were converted to absorption (A) using the Kubelka–Munk remission function.23 The band gaps of the samples were estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of the plot to the X (energy) axis. SEM and EDS measurements were carried out on ULTRA 55 FESEM of Zeiss and Oxford Inca instruments, respectively. A Zeiss Libra 200 FE Transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used for TEM studies. The samples for TEM and SAED were prepared by placing a drop of sample dispersed in acetone/toluene on a carbon coated copper grid.
Intensity data for In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 (1) were collected from a single crystal at 298(2) K on a XtaLAB Synergy, Dualflex, HyPix four-circle diffractometer with a micro-focus sealed X-ray tube using a mirror as a monochromator and a HyPix detector. The diffractometer was equipped with a low-temperature device and used Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The unit cell parameters (Table 1) were determined from 25 reflections measured by a random search routine. All data were integrated with CrysAlis PRO and a multi-scan absorption correction using SCALE3 ABSPACK was applied.24 The structures were solved by iterative methods using OLEX 1.2 and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods against F2 using SHELXL-2017/1.25 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically on calculated positions using a riding model with their Uiso values constrained to 1.5 times the Ueq of their pivot atoms for terminal sp3 carbon atoms and 1.2 times for all other carbon atoms. Disordered moieties were refined using bond length restraints and displacement parameter restraints. Molecular structures were drawn using ORTEP.26

2.2 Synthesis of In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 (1)
A methanolic solution of NaSepym(Me-4,6)2 was freshly prepared by reducing {Sepym(Me-4,6)2}2 (300 mg, 0.8 mmol) with NaBH4 (60.6 mg, 1.6 mmol) in 20 mL dry methanol under inert conditions using the Schlenk line technique at room temperature. To this solution, solid InCl3 (118 mg, 0.53 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 3 h. The solvents were then evaporated under vacuum and the residue was washed thoroughly with diethyl ether followed by water to remove sodium chloride. The final product was dried under reduced pressure and recrystallized from dichloromethane to afford colorless crystals (yield: 489 mg, 90.1%), m.p. 248 °C (dec.).

2.3 Preparation of indium selenide nanostructures
The indium selenide nanostructures were prepared using In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 (1) as a molecular precursor by the hot injection method, facilitated by high boiling-point solvents like OAm, ODE or DDT and by solid state pyrolysis. In a typical hot injection method, 9 ml of high boiling-point solvent (OAm, ODE or DDT) was taken in a three-necked round bottom flask and degassed at 110 °C under nitrogen flow for 30 min. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 250 °C. In the pre-heated solvent, the required amount of the precursor 1 (200 mg, 0.29 mmol), dispersed in OAm (1 mL) was rapidly injected. Decomposition was observed after one minute of injection and the solution changes its colour to brownish black, which indicates the decomposition of the complex and the formation of nanostructures. The reaction temperature dropped by around 20 °C upon injection; however, the set temperature was attained swiftly. The temperature was maintained for 5 minutes after which the heat source was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 70 °C and methanol (5 mL) was added to ensure complete precipitation of the nanostructures. The synthesized material was collected after repeated washing with methanol and toluene mixture (5:1, v/v) followed by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 minutes) to remove excess capping agent. In the case of pyrolysis, the title complex was furnace heated in an alumina boat at 300 °C for 30 minutes under flowing argon to afford a black residue.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical cell experiment
The photoresponsiveness of the nanostructures was measured in a photoelectrochemical cell prepared by using the silicon/InSe or silicon/In2Se3 geometry as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter and pseudo reference electrodes, and Na2S (0.6 M):Na2SO3 (0.8 M) (1:2) as the electrolyte. Working electrodes of silicon/InSe and silicon/In2Se3 were prepared by drop casting a colloidal solution of InSe or In2Se3 nanostructures, respectively, in chloroform on the rough surface of an n-type Si wafer of (100) orientation having a thickness of 200 μm and resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm. The drop casted film was dried at 140 °C for 3 h. The process was repeated many times until a uniform coating was obtained on the silicon surface. A fluorescent white lamp (36 W, UV content <3%) was used as a radiation source with the light intensity at the cell being 200 μW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and spectroscopy
The colorless crystalline indium selenolate complex, In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 (1), was obtained by the reaction of sodium 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidyl selenolate with 99.9% pure InCl3 in 3:1 stoichiometric ratio (Scheme 1). The complex was characterized by elemental analysis, UV-Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The electronic spectra of the complex displayed a single band in the UV region (λmax = 333 nm) which is red shifted with respect to the absorption band obtained for the corresponding bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidyl)diselenide (Fig. S1, ESI†). The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra show the expected resonances and the signals for the pyrimidyl ring protons are shifted upfield as compared to the same in the diselenide. The 77Se{1H} NMR spectra displayed a single resonance at 286.2 ppm (Fig. S1, ESI†).

The title complex crystallizes in toluene with the unit cell (Z = 8) having an orthorhombic crystal system with space group Pbca(61) (Fig. 1b). The complex exists as a discrete monomer with distorted octahedral geometry around the central In atom, which is coordinated through three 4,6-dimethylpyrimidylselenolate monoanionic species forming a four membered chelating ring defined by the N atom and the exocyclic Se atom. The distortion may be attributed to the small bite angles of the pyrimidylselenolate ligand. The ligands are oriented in such a way so as to give the mer (meridional) isomer of the complex, which is understood from the fact that the plane containing the three donor Se or N atoms passes through the central In atom. This observation is quite interesting in terms of the fact that most of the similar types of chelated tris indium complexes containing heteronuclear selenolate ligand (pyridyl/pyrimidyl) crystallize to give fac (facial) isomers.17,21,27 Only one meridional isomer of such a complex has been reported so far for tris(8-selenanylquinolinato)indium(II)tetrahydrate by Pech et al.28 Moreover, in the present case, only two In–Se (2.55 and 2.57 Å) and In–N (2.44 and 2.38 Å) distances are in agreement with those reported for similar types of complexes such as [In(SeC5H4N)3], In[SeC5H3(3-SiMe3)N]3, In[SeC5H3(Me-3)N]3 and In[SeC5H3(Me-5)N]3.17,21 The third pyrimidylselenolate moiety chelates to the central In atom with In–Se and In–N distances of 2.6115(6) and 2.731 Å, respectively, which are noticeably longer than the average In–Se and In–N distances for isostructural In complexes. This behaviour of the third selenolate ligand arises from the steric effect rendered in the molecule by methyl group hydrogens attached to C17 and C5, which are in close proximity. The steric effect amongst the ligands can be further realized from the disparity between the Se–In–Se bond angles. While two of the bond angles 108.57(2) and 110.95(2)° for Se(2)–In(1)–Se(3) and Se(1)–In(1)–Se(3), respectively, fall in line with those reported for [In(SeC5H4N)3], In[SeC5H3(Me-3)N]3 and In[SeC5H3(Me-5)N]3,17,21 the third bond angle of 136.94(3)° for Se(1)–In(1)–Se(2) is considerably larger than the same for the aforementioned complexes. The average Se–In–N bond angle (66.12°) is also comparable with those reported for similar complexes cited earlier in this section.
The crystal packing diagram of the complex (Fig. 2) exhibits that the monomeric In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 molecules are interlinked together in the 3D structure through short contacts between the H18A atoms of one unit to the N2 atoms of the next unit. These intermolecular C18–H18A⋯N2 distances (2.571 Å) are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms involved i.e., H and N (2.7 Å) indicating strong non-bonding secondary interactions between the two monomeric units. The observed short bond lengths could be due to the packing effect of the molecule in the crystal structure.

3.3 Thermal studies
The thermal analysis of the complex In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 (1) was performed to evaluate its thermal stability. Moreover, a thermogravimetric (TG) study also provides valuable information about the decomposition pattern and composition of the residue formed during the decomposition. From the TG and DTG signature of 1 presented in Fig. 3, it was inferred that the complex remains stable up to 286 °C. Beyond that point, it undergoes single step decomposition. The weight loss observed (62.2%) matches well with the calculated weight loss (64.35%) of In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 (1) for its transformation into In2Se3. In order to consolidate In2Se3 formation, the TG experiment was replicated where the complex was heated up to 350 °C and the residue was collected. The pXRD pattern of the residue confirms the formation of hexagonal In2Se3 (JCPDS file no. 71-0250), as shown in Fig. 3 inset. Furthermore, it was also observed that there was a gradual weight loss even after 286 °C, which continues to 630 °C until a plateau is attained. This restrained and nominal weight loss is roughly estimated to be due to the loss of Se, which volatilizes at higher temperature.29

3.4 Preparation and characterization of nanostructures
Having understood the thermal behaviour of the complex 1 from TG and DTG analysis and its subsequent conversion into indium selenide material, it was inferred that the title complex can be employed as a suitable single source precursor for the synthesis of technologically important indium selenide nanostructures. Therefore, In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 has been thermolyzed by employing the hot injection method in different high-boiling point solvents to prepare colloidal indium selenide nanostructures. Certain criteria of the solvent have to be realized in order to obtain colloidal nanoparticles through thermolysis. The solvent must possess a suitable high boiling point and should have coordinating ability in order to cap the nanostructures for obtaining a particular size, composition and phase. In the present study, OAm, DDT and ODE (9 mL) are chosen as reaction solvents and capping agents. These solvents differ in terms of their coordinating ability and capping mechanism, and OAm (1 mL) was employed as the injecting solvent owing to the better solubility of the precursor in OAm. From this point onwards, in the manuscript, the nanostructures thus synthesized will be designated by the reaction solvents used, i.e., nanostructures synthesized in OAm, DDT and ODE. These solvents are known to have different effects on the phase, composition and morphology of nanostructures.30
It is well reported that the presence of capping agents has a marked effect on the particle size, morphology and performance of metal chalcogenide nanoparticles and these properties get altered significantly in the absence of capping agents also.31 So, in order to investigate the composition and morphology of indium selenide under solvent-free conditions, solid state decomposition (pyrolysis) of 1 was also carried out at 300 °C for 30 minutes under flowing argon atmosphere in a tubular furnace. The crystal structure, morphology, homogeneity and optical band gap of the nanostructures were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), SEM, TEM, selective area electron diffraction (SAED) and solid-state diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).
The pXRD pattern of the nanostructures synthesized from 1 is presented in Fig. 4. The pXRD pattern for the materials synthesized in OAm and DDT features four distinct broad peaks at around 26.8, 44.7, 52.9 and 65.0°. These diffraction peaks can be assigned to the reflections originating from the (111), (220), (311) and (400) planes of cubic InSe material (ICDD file no. 00-065-0100). Conversely, the pXRD pattern for materials obtained in ODE and a furnace showed Bragg's reflections at 2θ = 15.0, 17.0, 25.0, 27.6, 28.5, 29.3, 30.3, 37.5, 38.8, 39.8, 43.9, 45.4, 47.6, 49.3, 51.4, 52.7 and 54.6°. These diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the reflections emerging from (101), (102), (110), (006), (113), (201), (202), (116), (121), (122), (300), (125), (208), (1010), (220), (306) and (218) planes of hexagonal In2Se3 material (ICSD No. 82203/JCPDS71-0250). It should be noted that in all cases, the pXRD patterns do not contain reflections from any other phases of indium selenide, which confirms that in all the cases phase pure indium selenide nanostructures have been obtained. The broadening of the pXRD peaks in all cases indicates that the dimensions of the particles are in the nano domain. The average crystallite size calculated from the Scherrer equation32 was found to be ∼8.9 and 6.38 nm for cubic InSe synthesized in OAm and DDT, respectively, and ∼25.4 and 35.9 nm for hexagonal In2Se3 synthesized in ODE and a furnace, respectively. The results of the pXRD analysis are aptly supported by the EDS analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†). From the EDS spectra of the materials synthesized in OAm and DDT, the In:Se atomic percentage ratio comes out to be 47.26:52.74 (1:1.11) and 49.55:50.45 (1:1.01), respectively, which supports the formation of InSe, whereas the In:Se atomic percentage ratio for materials synthesized in ODE and a furnace was observed to be 39.5:60.5 (1:1.53) and 39.3:60.7 (1:1.54), respectively, which validates the formation of In2Se3. Thermodynamics calculations on the In–Se binary phase diagram performed by Lu et al. prove that In2Se3 is a thermodynamically more favoured phase compared to InSe, owing to the high effective heat of formation in the former case.33 Interestingly, it is worth noting that in the present study, the SSP 1 was able to produce both these stoichiometries of indium selenide in phase pure form just by adopting suitable reaction conditions.

The formation of different stoichiometric indium selenide in different solvents can be explained on the basis of their varying coordinating/surface capping ability and reducing nature. The presence of amine (–NH2) and thiol (–SH) groups in OAm and DDT, respectively, makes them strong capping agents and they are known to coordinate nanomaterials through their lone pair of electrons. Moreover, OAm is believed to possess mild reducing ability at higher temperature.34 It is also reported that at higher temperature, the thiol (–SH) group in DDT gets deprotonated to give the corresponding thiolate (–S−) in the presence of OAm.35 These features of OAm and DDT furnish a reducing environment during the synthesis of indium selenide nanostructures and consequently, also stabilize the lower oxidation state of indium to form InSe. It should be noted that the average crystallite size of InSe synthesized in OAm is somewhat larger compared to DDT. This phenomenon can be explained considering the mechanism of interaction of these capping agents with InSe. Indium is considered as a soft acid in the HSAB system, whose high affinities for soft ligands such as thiols are well documented.36 Thus, DDT will surely have faster capping kinetics in the case of InSe, whereas the presence of a hard amine group in OAm will provide comparatively slower capping kinetics. A faster and better capping interaction of InSe with DDT yields a smaller average crystallite size of the material as it provides less time for the Ostwald ripening process and thereby particle growth as compared to OAm.37 In contrast to OAm and DDT; ODE, being devoid of any functional groups, interacts with the nanomaterials through the terminal alkene/vinyl group.38 The neutral capping nature of ODE favours the formation of In2Se3, where In is present in its most stable oxidation state of +3. The formation of In2Se3 in a furnace with higher average crystallite size as compared to that of ODE is well rationalized as in the former case, no capping agent/solvent was involved.
The morphology of the InSe and In2Se3 nanostructures as obtained from 1 was studied by the SEM technique. The SEM images show that though InSe was obtained in both OAm and DDT, they differ considerably in morphology. InSe synthesized in OAm (Fig. 5a) depicts the presence of a hierarchical structure consisting of long but ultrathin nanosheets. The average thickness of the nanosheets was found to be ∼4 nm (Fig. 5a inset). However, InSe synthesized in DDT represents a flocculent type morphology comprising only ultrathin nanoflakes oriented in a random fashion (Fig. 5b). The morphology of In2Se3 synthesized in ODE and a furnace was also found to differ significantly. In2Se3 synthesized in ODE features irregularly shaped nanoplatelets (Fig. 5c) with an average thickness of ∼8 nm (Fig. 5c inset) and the same yielded in a furnace reveals agglomerated nanoparticles (Fig. 5d). The morphologies of these nanostructures are well corroborated by the bright field TEM studies. The TEM images given in Fig. 6a and c represent InSe nanostructures prepared in OAm and DDT, which confirms the presence of irregularly stacked ultrathin nanosheets and flocculents, respectively. Some of the sheets which are quite transparent to the electron beam can be clearly observed at the edges. On the other hand, the TEM image of In2Se3 obtained in ODE (Fig. 6e) revealed the presence of nanoplatelets. Interestingly, upon careful examination, the TEM image of In2Se3 obtained in the furnace reveals the presence of nanorods of varying size and width (Fig. 6g). It was realized that the morphology of In2Se3 obtained in the furnace as determined from SEM was the result of the agglomeration of these In2Se3 nanorods which can be easily interpreted since no capping agent was involved in the synthetic process. These agglomerates probably get segregated in the process of ultrasonication during the preparation of the TEM sample, which explains the difference in SEM and TEM images of the In2Se3 nanostructures prepared in the furnace. The inter planar spacing of 3.31 and 3.29 Å calculated from the HRTEM images presented in Fig. 6b and d represents the (111) plane for InSe synthesized in OAm and DDT, respectively, whereas the HRTEM images of In2Se3 synthesized in ODE and a furnace (Fig. 6f and h) show lattice spacings of 3.53 and 3.54 Å, respectively, which can be indexed to the (110) plane of the material. The results are in agreement with the reflections observed in the pXRD patterns of the respective materials. In the corresponding SAED pattern shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), concentric diffused rings are observed for the InSe materials obtained in OAm and DDT, which reflect the polycrystalline nature of the material, whereas well defined discrete spots were observed in the case of In2Se3 prepared in ODE and a furnace (Fig. S3c and d, ESI†) which are indicative of the highly crystalline nature of these nanostructures. A summary of the nanomaterial crystallite size, morphology and optical properties obtained under different reaction conditions is given in Table 3.

3.5 Optical properties
InSe and In2Se3 have shown impressive performance in optoelectronics, nonlinear optics and photovoltaic devices owing to their suitable narrow band gap along with efficient absorption and sensitivity.39 The bulk direct band gaps of InSe and In2Se3 are reported to be in the range 1.24–1.30 eV.39,40 Considering the importance of optical band gap in nanoelectronics, the optical properties of the synthesized nanostructures were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and the optical band gaps of these materials were determined by using a plot of the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R) as given in the following equation:[F(R)hν]n = A(hν − Eg)where hν is photon energy, A is a constant, Eg denotes the band gap, and n depends on the nature of the optical transition.
The direct band gap of the materials was calculated using Tauc's model (n = 2). From the diffuse reflectance spectra presented in Fig. 7, it was observed that the direct optical band gaps of cubic InSe synthesized in OAm and DDT are 1.56 and 1.72 eV, respectively, whereas the same for hexagonal In2Se3 prepared in ODE and a furnace was evaluated to be 1.79 and 1.63 eV, respectively. The band gap trend can be easily understood as the average crystallite size for InSe synthesized in DDT is smaller than that of OAm, which in turn results in a higher band gap in the former case. The same argument is valid for In2Se3 also. The direct band gap values for InSe and In2Se3 are distinctly blue shifted as compared to their bulk counterpart (Eg = 1.24 and 1.3 eV for bulk InSe and In2Se3), which may either be due to lattice distortions or surface lattice defects, or quantum confinement or surface effects of the carriers.41

3.6 Photo response measurements of Si/InSe and Si/In2Se3 based liquid junction photoelectrochemical cells
The photo-response of the as-prepared nanostructures: InSe synthesized in OAm and In2Se3 (prepared using ODE) has been evaluated by fabricating prototype photoelectrochemical cells with a three electrode system. The working electrode was fabricated by spin coating a chloroform solution of InSe or In2Se3 nanomaterials over a Si substrate followed by evaporation of the solvent to give a film of the material (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the preparation of the working electrode (InSe/In2Se3 over Si substrate) by spin coating. 
In the present work, cubic InSe and hexagonal In2Se3 obtained in OAm and ODE were selected as two representative materials and the photo responses of these two materials were investigated. For both cells, the current voltage I–V characteristics showed nonlinear behaviour (Fig. 8a and b). The nonlinear I–V characteristics exhibit junction properties with an increase in current under illumination conditions relative to that of the dark current due to the photo-generated carriers. Photoresponsivity and photo-stability are important criteria to select an absorber material for photovoltaic and photodetector applications. The photo response of both the nanostructures as a function of time was measured under a white light intensity of 200 μW cm−2 with a bias voltage of −1.5 V. When the light was turned on, photo-excited electrons from the valence band reached the conduction band resulting in increased photoconductivity. However, saturation is reached and no change in current is observed when the cell was exposed to light for a considerable amount of time. When the light was turned off, the “carrier generation process” abruptly stops while the “carrier loss process” continues resulting in a sudden decrease in the conductivity. On comparing the switching signature of both the nanostructures, it was observed that hexagonal In2Se3 shows better switching characteristics during the repeated cycles of on–off experiments (Fig. 8c and d). Under illumination, the current is increased and the photocurrent (Ipc= Ilight− Idark) observed for cubic InSe is 3 μA, whereas the same for In2Se3 synthesized in ODE was calculated to be 50 μA. The photoresponsivity (R) or photocurrent generation efficiency is the ratio of generated photocurrent and incident optical power (R = Ipc/PS)4a which is expressed as the photocurrent (Ipc) generated by the light power density (P = 200 μW cm−2) on the effective area of a photodetector (S = 0.785 cm2 in the present case). In this study, the photoresponsivity was calculated to be 19 mA W−1 and 318 mA W−1 for cubic InSe and hexagonal In2Se3, respectively. In the InxSey type material, the phase and stoichiometry play a pivotal role in determining the photoresponsivity. In the case of In2Se3, due to the higher oxidation state of Indium, there is a possibility to form more charge carriers (electrons) than in InSe. Moreover, as reported by Sreekumar et al., the photoconductivity of indium selenide materials exhibits a strong dependence on the concentration of indium in the material.42 Their report suggested that the photoconductivity decreases with an increase in indium concentration due to the introduced defect levels above the valence band, which can prevent photogenerated carriers from reaching the conduction band during illumination. Hence, in the case of InSe where the stoichiometry is 1:1, the photoconductivity may be expected to be low compared to In2Se3 with In:Se stoichiometry of 0.67:1. In a previous study, Jacobs-Gedrim et al. have reported a responsivity of 395 A W−1 at 5 V using monochromatic light with a light power density of 0.469 W m−2 at 300 nm for In2Se3 nanosheets.43 According to this report, the high photocurrent response of In2Se3 was attributed to the direct band gap structure which leads to efficient absorption allowing real-time detection under very low-light conditions.

From the repeated cycles, one of the cycles has been chosen to calculate the rise time (the time required for the current to increase from 10% to 90% of the peak value) and fall time in each case. The rise and fall times for cubic InSe synthesized in OAm are 18.6 and 8.8 s (Fig. 8e) while the same for hexagonal In2Se3 prepared in ODE are 10 and 8.7 s, respectively (Fig. 8f). The difference in rise times and fall times may be due to the involvement of trap states or defects in the switching process.
Conclusion
In this report, the potential of a novel indium complex In[Sepym(Me-4,6)2]3 as a versatile SSP to afford phase pure cubic InSe and hexagonal In2Se3 nanostructures by optimizing the reaction conditions was demonstrated. These nanostructures exhibit band gaps suitable for solar cell and optoelectronic applications. The photoelectrochemical studies revealed the high photoresponsive behaviour of these nanostructures. In summary, this work presents an efficient approach in the form of a single source molecular precursor to synthesize highly crystalline InSe and In2Se3 nanostructures with enhanced stability and photoresponsitivity, offering more opportunities for their potential applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics.
