    , Accepted 19th April 2018First published on 20th April 2018AbstractHerein, we report the photovoltaic performance studies of four D–π–A configured carbazole based co-sensitizers, P1–4, in DSSCs sensitized with Ru-II complexes, i.e.NCSU-10/N3. The organic co-sensitizers (P1–4) comprise carbazole as a donor scaffold, a phenylene ring as a π-spacer and electron withdrawing functional groups, viz. cyanoacetic acid (P1), rhodanine-3-acetic acid (P1–2), barbituric acid (P3), and thiobarbituric acid (P4) as acceptor/anchoring units. From the results, it is evident that the device fabricated using co-sensitizer P1 carrying cyanoacetic acid, at the concentration of 0.2 mM NCSU-10, exhibited an enhanced photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.19% with a JSC of 21.20 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.658 V and FF of 65.85%, while P3 containing barbituric acid displayed a PCE of 8.75% with a JSC of 22.23 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.671 V and FF of 58.64%, whereas NCSU-10 (0.2 mM) alone displayed a PCE of 8.28% with a JSC of 20.38 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.665 V and FF of 61.09%, but the dyes P2 carrying rhodanine-3-acetic acid and P4 containing thiobarbituric acid showed considerably lower performance. The co-sensitized devices of N3 with P1–4 displayed inferior photovoltaic performance compared to N3 itself, probably due to inefficient suppression of back current. The observed results have thrown new light upon the selection of appropriate and matchable co-sensitizers for improving photovoltaic performance of Ru-II based sensitizers.
1. Introduction
The development of photoactive organic materials has received tremendous impetus in recent years owing to their potential applications in electronic devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).1–3 Among the aforesaid applications, DSSCs, which are a thin film photovoltaic technology, have received much attention after the pioneering work presented by the Grätzel group.4 One of the four important components of DSSCs, i.e. the photosensitizer (dye), plays a vital role in the overall performance of the photovoltaic cell, which includes photon harvesting and initiating the electrochemical processes in the cell for power generation.5,6 To date, the majority of investigations on metal-based sensitizers in n-type DSSCs have been centred on ruthenium(II) complexes due to their attractive photophysical and electrochemical properties.7 Although the best performing cells exploit Ru(II) complex based chromophores such as N3, N719, black dye and NCSU-10 as active sensitizers, there are certain limitations such as the use of rare noble metals, their availability, high cost, environmental hazards and problems associated with purification that have restricted their further development.8–11 In contrast, metal-free organic dyes possess several advantages over the former class, such as design versatility, high molar extinction coefficients, tunable photophysical spectral behavior and cost effectiveness in their synthesis.12–15 However, when compared to Ru(II) complexes, the metal-free sensitizers demonstrated low photovoltaic performance due to their narrow absorption profiles and the absence of metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands observed for the former class. In addition, it is well-established that, the photovoltaic performance mainly depends on the light harvesting ability of the sensitizers used in the devices.13 Essentially, for a dye to act as an ideal sensitizer, it should possess a broad and intense absorption characteristic in the UV-Visible and near IR regions. Moreover, it should have favorable anchoring functionalities to adsorb on the surface of a semiconductor. From these perspectives, in the literature, several design strategies have been reported for the development of effective organic co-sensitizers.
Among them, co-sensitization is an efficient approach to achieve panchromatic absorption of DSSCs, which involves the merits of both Ru(II) complex dyes and metal-free organic sensitizers in the same fabricated device and thereby enables the cell to harvest the maximum number of incident photons.16,17 Interestingly, many heterocyclic dyes based on indole, carbazole, phenothiazine, thiophene etc. have been reported to be effective co-sensitizers.12 One exciting example is the co-sensitization of black dye with a thiophene based organic dye Y1, which brings about an improvement in the PCE of 11.28%.18 Later, Luo and his coworkers reported two new thiophene and furan based D–π–A configured dyes carrying cyanoacetic acid as effective co-sensitizers for N719-based DSSCs.19 Recently, our group reported new carbazole based co-sensitizers carrying barbituric acid as an effective anchoring group for NCSU-10 sensitized cells, which displayed improved photovoltaic performance compared to that of NCSU-10 alone.20–22 Due to the bulky size of Ru(II) complexes, metal-free organic co-sensitizers could fill the gap among the main sensitizers on the TiO2 surface to harvest the maximum number of photons. The defect structure plays an important role in electrical properties and is also utilized in other kinds of energy harvesters such as supercapacitors.23 Consequently, the organic dyes, in order to be used as ideal co-sensitizers in DSSCs, should possess some key requirements, such as (i) they should not adsorb completely with the main sensitizer while efficiently suppressing the dye aggregation on the surface of mesoporous TiO2, (ii) they should possess a large molar extinction coefficient near the IR region or below 450 nm and (iii) they should be able to form a compact monolayer on the surface of TiO2, reducing the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.16,17
Against this background, and in continuation of our previous work,24 we have investigated four new dyes, P1–4, with a structurally favorable D–π–A architecture carrying different anchoring/accepting units, as co-sensitizers along with efficient Ru(II) complexes, i.e.NCSU-10 and N3, as sensitizers in DSSCs. It is hoped that these dyes as co-sensitizers would enhance the photovoltaic performance by reducing the undesired recombination process occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface of the cell. Further, it is assumed that, because of the difference in the molecular geometry of Ru(II) complexes and the organic co-sensitizers P1–4, the surface of TiO2 can be covered more effectively, resulting in an improved efficiency in the fabricated cell.
Chemical structures of the carbazole based co-sensitizers P1–4 and sensitizers N3 and NCSU-10 are depicted in Fig. 1.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
The organic dyes P1–4 carrying different anchoring/acceptor units, viz. cyano acetic acid, rhodanine-3-acetic acid, barbituric acid and thiobarbituric acid, were synthesized following the procedures reported in our previous publication.24 The DSSCs were fabricated using the standard N3/NCSU-10 sensitizer alone. Further, they were co-sensitized using dyes P1–4 in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent on the TiO2 photoanode. The Doctor Blade method25–27 was used for fabrication and its details are given in the electronic supplementary information. The IPCE experiments were conducted on the fabricated devices using a spectral response measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurements). Finally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were recorded over a frequency range of 100 mHz to 200 kHz at 298 K with a Bio-Logic SP-150 impedance analyzer under the illumination of light using a solar simulator (SOL3A, Oriel) equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp (91160, Oriel). The applied voltage was set at the VOC of the DSSCs with AC amplitude fixed at 10 mV. The obtained plots were fitted via Z-Fit software (Bio-Logic).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photovoltaic performance
In order to evaluate the co-sensitization behavior of carbazole dyes P1–4 with the well-known Ru-II (NCSU-10/N3) based sensitizers, the dyes carrying different anchoring/acceptor units, viz. cyano acetic acid, rhodanine-3-acetic acid, barbituric acid and thiobarbituric acid, were employed as co-sensitizers in the fabrication of new DSSCs. The obtained results showcase the prominent role of the structures of co-sensitizers in the cell performance.

Fig. 2 and 3 display the J–V and IPCE characteristic curves of the photovoltaic devices sensitized with NCSU-10 alone and co-sensitized with dyes P1–4. Their resultant photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 1. From the results, it is evident that the DSSCs fabricated using NCSU-10 along with co-sensitizer P1 carrying cyanoacetic acid and P3 carrying barbituric acid outperformed the device sensitized with NCSU-10 alone. Whereas, the devices co-sensitized with P2 carrying rhodanine-3-acetic acid and P4 carrying thiobarbituric acid showed a lower PCE than that of NCSU-10 alone. These co-sensitizers containing a sulphur atom in their structures are capable of forming a dye–iodine complex, thereby resulting in a decrease of photovoltaic performance.28,29 As the results indicate, the cells employing NCSU-10 along with co-sensitizers P1–4 yielded PCEs of 9.19, 6.36, 8.75 and 7.69%, respectively, while that with NCSU-10 alone showed a PCE of 8.28%. It is interesting to note that the P1 co-sensitized device with NCSU-10 and P3 co-sensitized device with NCSU-10 displayed an improved photocurrent density and JSC of 21.19 and 22.22 mA cm−2, respectively, whereas the sensitized device with NSCU-10 alone showed a JSC value of 20.38 mA cm−2. The JSC values of the other devices with P2 carrying rhodanine-3-acetic acid and P4 containing thiobarbituric acid were considerably low with respect to the DSSCs fabricated with NSCU-10 alone.28,29 The observed reduction in JSC values may be due to the fact that the co-sensitizers probably reduce the dye loading up to 60% in the co-sensitized devices. Although the device with co-sensitizer P1 displayed enhanced JSC and PCE values, its VOC value was found to be lower than that of the device with NCSU-10 alone, indicating a higher electron re-combination rate. However, the FF only improved when P1 and P4 were employed as co-sensitizers for NCSU-10, while for others, the FF dropped. This is due to the fact that the binding strengths between TiO2 and different anchoring groups are different. The binding strengths of cyanoacetic acid (P1) and thiobarbituric acid (P4) are stronger than the other two, leading to the increase of FF. With poor binding strengths, P2 and P3 caused defects on the TiO2 surface and decreased the FF. Further, the co-adsorbent, CDCA, acts as a proton buffer between the sensitizer and co-sensitizer, ‘regulating’ the dye proton content and hence facilitating improved dye adsorption on the surface of photo-anode TiO2.22,23 It also helps in suppressing the dye aggregation and shielding the TiO2 surface, thereby causing a decrease in the electron recombination process with redox electrolyte.

Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) study was performed for the fabricated devices. Fig. 3 shows IPCE characteristic curves of the photovoltaic devices sensitized with NCSU-10 alone and co-sensitized with dyes P1–4. From the results of IPCE experiments, it is interesting to note that the NCSU-10 based cells fabricated with co-sensitizer P3 carrying barbituric acid displayed an IPCE of about 70% in the broad range of 380–700 nm, showing the peak at 550 nm. The increased IPCE value can be explained in terms of its enhanced JSC value. Also, co-sensitizer P1 carrying cyanoacetic acid showcased a better photocurrent density of 21.19 mA cm−2 than that of the NCSU-10 sensitized device, due to its enhanced IPCE value. In the case of NCSU-10 sensitizer, the presence of the ancillary carbazole ligand caused a good quantum efficiency of 62% in the plateau region.30 Because of the fact that co-sensitizers P1 and P3 structurally match with the standard NCSU-10 sensitizer, their co-sensitized devices demonstrated an enhanced IPCE up to 72%.
Further, J–V and IPCE data pertaining to new DSSCs co-sensitized with dyes P1–4 and sensitized with N3 alone are tabulated in Table 1. Their corresponding J–V and IPCE traces are presented in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. All the co-sensitized devices displayed lower photovoltaic performances than the cell sensitized with N3 dye alone and they were found to be in the order of N3 > P3 > P4 > P2 > P1. The observed decrease in the VOC values is mainly attributed to an unwanted back reaction that arises within the cell. Also, their JSC values were found to be lower than that of the device sensitized with N3 alone. Perhaps this is due to the competitive adsorption of the co-sensitizer and N3 molecules, thereby resulting in a decrease in the adsorption of N3 molecules on the TiO2 surface.26 Moreover, inappropriate matching of co-sensitizers with standard N3 sensitizer might have caused the inferior photovoltaic performance.

3.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the standard techniques used to understand carrier transportation behavior and interfacial charge recombination processes in fabricated photoelectrochemical devices.31,32 It measures the dielectric properties of materials used in the devices and their interface, as a function of frequency. In the present study, the EIS spectra were recorded for the fabricated devices using a Bio-Logic SP-150 impedance analyzer under the illumination of light using a solar simulator. The obtained Nyquist and Bode plots of fabricated devices using co-sensitizers P1–4 along with NCSU-10/N3 are depicted in Fig. 6–9, respectively.

DSSCs co-sensitized by P1–4 along with NCSU-10. 
The EIS measurements of the fabricated devices using co-sensitizers P1–4 along with NCSU-10 sensitizer showed two separate semicircles in the case of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 6) and clear frequency peaks in the Bode plots (Fig. 7). In the Nyquist plot, all the devices showed two distinct semicircles, located in the high and middle frequency regions. Here, the first semicircle corresponds to the recombination resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface, while the second semicircle is related to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In the Nyquist plots, the radii of the second semicircle of the fabricated DSSCs were found to be in the order of P3 > NCSU-10 > P1 > P4 > P2. The obtained results indicate that the dark current/back reaction in the P3 co-sensitized DSSC has been effectively suppressed. But, as evidenced from the J–V characteristic curves, the device co-sensitized with P3 displayed a lower PCE than that of P1 co-sensitizer. Further, a larger difference in the impendence behavior in the fabricated devices is due to the nature of impedance involved. Here, the impedance of devices fabricated using co-sensitizers P1, P2 and P4 as well as the sensitizer NCSU-10 can be ascribed to Nernst impedance, whereas the impedance of the device co-sensitized with P3 may be attributed to Gerischer impedance.33 The aforementioned results are consistent with the experimental VOC values obtained for the fabricated cells tabulated in Table 1.
In the Bode frequency curves for devices sensitized with NCSU-10 dye alone and co-sensitized with P1–4 (Fig. 7), the frequency response in the range of 1–100 Hz is an indicator of the electron recombination between TiO2 and electrolyte in the device and is directly related to the electron lifetime in the CB edge of TiO2. The electron lifetime (τeff) values of the fabricated devices are calculated using eqn (1). (1)Here, τeff is the lifetime of electrons in the CB edge of TiO2 and f is the mid-frequency in the Bode plot. The electron lifetime depends on the density of the charge traps in the CB of TiO2, which is directly related to the experimental VOC of the devices. In other words, a longer τeff indicates better suppression of the back reaction, leading to the improvement of the VOC values. From Fig. 7, it is apparent that the mid-frequency of the DSSC co-sensitized with P3 has slightly shifted to a lower frequency than that of NCSU-10, indicating a longer recombination lifetime for P3. As a result, P3 showed a slightly higher VOC of 0.671 V than NCSU-10 (0.665 V). The calculated electron lifetimes were found to be in the decreasing order of P3 (2.60 ms) > NCSU-10 (2.52 ms) > P1 (2.17 ms) > P4 (1.99 ms) > P2 (1.43 ms). From the results, it is clear that the calculated lifetimes for all the dyes are in good agreement with the observed VOC values of the devices34,35 (Table 1). Conclusively, the co-sensitizer P3 carrying barbituric acid as an acceptor/anchoring moiety is considered to be reasonably efficient in suppressing the unwanted charge recombination process on the TiO2 surface.


DSSCs co-sensitized by P1–4 along with N3. 
Nyquist and Bode plots of the fabricated devices using co-sensitizers P1–4 along with N3 as well as the device sensitized with N3 alone are depicted in Fig. 8 and 9, respectively. In the Nyquist plots, all the devices displayed two distinct semicircles. It can be observed that in the Nyquist plots, the radii of the second semicircles increase in the order of N3 < P3 < P1 < P2 < P4, indicating that their electron recombination resistance decreases as N3 > P3 > P1 > P2 > P4. The VOC values of the DSSCs were found to be in the decreasing order of N3 (0.629 V) > P3 (0.620 V) > P4 (0.610 V) > P2 (0.590 V) > P1 (0.585 V). As evidenced from the J–V characteristic curves, all the co-sensitized devices showcased inferior photovoltaic performance compared to that of N3. The results clearly indicate that the co-sensitizers are inefficient in the suppression of dark current/back reaction in the fabricated DSSCs. The aforementioned results are consistent with the observed VOC values for the fabricated cells, as tabulated in Table 1.
Further, using the Bode plots, the electron lifetimes (τeff) in the CB edge of TiO2 in the fabricated devices were calculated. The calculated values of τeff were found to be in the decreasing order of N3 (2.12 ms) > P3 (1.61 ms) > P4 (1.18 ms) > P2 (1.09 ms) > P1 (1.02 ms). In the present study, it has been noticed that the VOC values (Table 1) of the DSSCs increase in accordance with their electron lifetimes.34,35 Consequently, the co-sensitizers P1–4 are inefficient in suppressing the unwanted back reaction between TiO2 and electrolyte in the fabricated devices.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated devices using four D–π–A configured carbazole based dyes P1–4 as co-sensitizers in DSSCs sensitized with NCSU-10 and N3 dyes. Their photovoltaic studies indicate that, under the same conditions, the device fabricated using co-sensitizer P1 carrying cyanoacetic acid as an anchoring/accepting moiety, at the concentration of 0.2 mM NCSU-10, exhibited an enhanced PCE of 9.19% with a JSC of 21.20 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.658 V and FF of 65.85%, while P3 containing barbituric acid as an anchoring/accepting unit displayed a PCE of 8.75% with a JSC of 22.23 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.671 V and FF of 58.64%, whereas NCSU-10 (0.2 mM) alone showed a PCE of 8.28% with a JSC of 20.38 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.665 V and FF of 61.09%. Further, from the EIS studies, it is clear that the NCSU-10 based device co-sensitized with P3 carrying barbituric acid is efficient in suppressing the undesired charge recombination in the DSSCs, thereby resulting in a higher VOC. Further, the device fabricated using co-sensitizers P1–4 along with N3 displayed lower photovoltaic performances than N3 alone. Obviously, these results provide insights into how to choose appropriate and matchable co-sensitizers for further enhancing the photovoltaic performance of devices sensitized with Ru-II complexes.
