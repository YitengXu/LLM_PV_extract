ChinaReceived 4th June 2013, Accepted 6th September 2013First published on 9th September 2013AbstractSolution-based deposition processes have taken a leading role in producing high efficiency devices from Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) systems. The Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films deposited from our ethanol-based process currently provide a high reported efficiency for this material system at 5.36%. In this paper, we report a detailed study of the ethanol-based solution deposition route from the chemistry occurring in the precursor solution to the transformation from solid state framework to the CZTS phase during a subsequent annealing treatment. The homogenous CZTS precursor solution is a mixture of three different metal–thioacetamide (TAA) complexes, which has been proven by the analysis of UV-vis-near-IR absorption spectra and FT-IR absorption spectra. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy have been employed to track every stage of the reaction route. It is found that the complexes build up an ordered framework upon drying and transform to a CuSn3.75S8 phase and finally to the CZTS phase after subsequent annealing treatments. The relative simplicity of this formation mechanism is beneficial for the performance of the CZTS based solar cells.IntroductionResearch of thin film solar cells has made substantial progress towards developing commercially viable low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is one of the most promising materials for thin film solar cells. It is a p-type semiconductor with a direct energy band gap of about 1.5 eV as well as an optical absorption coefficient higher than 104 cm−1, and is composed of earth abundant and non-toxic elements.1 To date, the highest performance Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) device with 11% power conversion efficiency has been fabricated using unique precursor compounds available through the application of liquid-phase hydrazine-based solvent systems.2 As a solution-based fabrication technique, hydrazine solution processing facilitates the deposition of low-cost and high throughput high quality thin films for solar cells.3–5 The existence of a liquid-phase process capable of outperforming its vacuum-based counterpart is an unusual occurrence in the development of thin film solar cells. The success of the hydrazine-based solution process can be partially attributed to its ability to control volatile species within the film and suppress the formation of secondary phases, which are identified as the present major challenges.In many respects, hydrazine is an ideal solvent, since it is both a small and volatile molecule and tends not to coordinate strongly and also a strong reducing agent. In the hydrazine-based processing technique for chalcogenide precursor films, many metal chalcogenides, as well as elemental sulfur and selenium, can be effectively dissolved in hydrazine solutions.6–11 For example, copper(I) sulfide and tin(II) sulfide/selenide readily dissolve in hydrazine with extra chalcogen added.9,10 However, zinc sulfide/selenide typically shows negligible solubility in hydrazine-based solvent systems under ambient conditions.12 Therefore an issue faced by the hydrazine-based process is how to solve the problem regarding the dissolution state of the zinc source in hydrazine solvents. Recently, an ingenious solution was presented to incorporate soluble zinc constituents into hydrazine in a completely dissolved form, stable in the presence of dissolved copper and tin complexes. Here a hydrazine derivative (that is hydrazinocarboxylic acid) was used to form soluble zinc complexes in hydrazine-based precursor solutions.4However, the major drawback of the hydrazine-based process is the use of large amounts of hydrazine, which is explosive, hepatotoxic, and carcinogenic.13,14 Hydrazine should therefore be used only with adequate protective measures in place to avoid contact with either the vapor or liquid and/or ignition sources.15,16 To address the hydrazine issue, different types of precursor solution were introduced by selecting suitable solvents. The requirements for selecting a solvent should be good solubility to metal and sulfur sources, non-toxicity, and small molecular weight. In addition, solvents, which have very high vapor pressure, may dry too quickly, obstructing the deposition equipment or creating defects in the layer. Solvents with low vapor pressure may require heating during the drying step. While this is a common procedure, in some cases heating of solvents with too low vapor pressure may reduce viscosity and induce surface tension that can cause layer non-uniformity.17At first, a pyridine-based precursor solution of copper(I) iodide, zinc(II) acetate, tin(II) chloride and thioacetamide dissolved in pyridine was used to prepare CZTS films.18 Afterwards, a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based and a methanol-based precursor solution of Cu, Zn, Sn salts and thiourea, were proposed to synthesize CZTS thin films, respectively. Here the DMSO-based CZTS device achieved an efficiency of 4.1%.19,20 Recently, our research group developed an ethanol-based precursor solution by dissolving copper(II) chloride, zinc(II) chloride, tin(II) chloride, monoethanolamine and thioacetamide (TAA) in ethanol, for producing CZTSSe thin films, providing a better conversion efficiency for this material system at 5.36%.21 At the same time, a 2-methoxyethanol-based solution composed of CuCl2, Zn(ac)2, SnCl2, and thiourea was adopted to prepare CZTS thin films.22 All these solvents including pyridine, DMSO, methanol, 2-methoxyethanol and ethanol, are non-toxic, have a low molecular weight, have good solubility of metal salts and have a suitable boiling point.The targeted solution-based deposition process relies on forming a soluble molecular-based precursor solution, therefore, it is necessary to identify the structure of the involved precursor species and their interactions within the liquid-phase solution in order to have a better understanding of the phase formation mechanism in as-deposited films and ultimately improve the photovoltaic performance of resulting devices. Firstly, if not all of the precursor materials are fully soluble in the resulting liquid, then the use of this precursor solution to deposit films is colloquially referred to as a slurry deposition. Secondly, as the deposited films are dried, the metal chalcogenide precursor complexes act as building blocks to construct a three-dimensional framework incorporating both the chalcogenide materials and the coordinating agent molecules. How these precursor complexes pack with solvent molecules to form extended ordered frameworks has drawn significant research interest for many years. And it remains unclear how precursor complexes combine into a single multimetallic CZTS phase during the crystallization process.In this paper, we report a detailed study of the reaction route, from the chemistry occurring in an ethanol-based precursor solution to the solid state reaction of the precursor material. The route involved two main parts: the formation of a precursor solution and the transformation from a solid state framework to the CZTS phase during subsequent annealing treatment.ExperimentalChemicalsAll chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2·2H2O, >99.9%), zinc(II) chloride (ZnCl2, >99.9%), and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2·2H2O, >99.9%), were from Tianjin Chenfu Chemical reagent limited company. Thioacetamide (TAA, >99.5%) was from Alfa Aesar, and ethanol (absolute) was from Tianjin Chenfu Chemical reagent limited company.Synthesis of the precursor solutionAt first, after dissolving 10 mmol CuCl2, 6.82 mmol ZnCl2 in 20 mL ethanol with constant magnetic stirring and 5.68 mmol SnCl2 were added to the solution and it was stirred to dissolve the solids for 10 min at room temperature. During this step, the color of the ethanol solution changed from a deep green to milk-white. In the next step, 37.5 mmol of TAA was added to the above solution and stirred until the white slurry disappears. The color of the precursor solution changed from milk-white to transparent yellow. So, the final solution contains 0.5 M CuCl2, 0.341 M ZnCl2, 0.284 M SnCl2 and 1.875 M of TAA. The ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn:S was kept at an appropriate range [Cu:(Zn + Sn):S = 0.8:1:3, and Zn:Sn = 1.2].Synthesis of CZTS thin filmsThe Mo coated glass substrate was dip-cast from the precursor solution, drying at 130 °C in air for 10 min, resulting in shiny black CZTS precursor film. To reach the targeted thickness of the CZTS precursor film, several successive layers were coated following an intermediate heat treatment. The obtained films were then annealed to form a compact CZTS absorber film in a graphite box at 430 °C for 30 min. After the heat treatment, the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature under an inert atmosphere.CharacterizationThe coordinating environments in solution were characterized by using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer at room temperature. The formation of the precursor solution in the precursor solution was studied using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FT-IR) (Thermo, Nicolet 6700) and the KBr disk method. The thermal decomposition of a precursor powder was studied by thermogravimetric analysis using a NETZSCH STA 449F3 (with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 in flowing nitrogen). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) profiles were measured with a German Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5405 Å, graphite monochromator, scintillation counter, step width 0.02°, constant counting time of 10 s/step, measured range of 20–70° in 2θ). The Raman spectra were obtained using a LabRam HR800, the wavelength of the laser excitation for Raman measurements was 488 nm, and the laser power was ∼100 mW.Results and discussionAlthough a number of liquid-based protocols are available for the deposition of CZTS precursor materials, the solution-based process is the one that provides a true solution with the metal and sulfide species homogeneously dissolved, rather than bound in stable precursor compounds and particles. It is critical to understand the mechanism of the dissolution process for the purpose of optimizing device preparation and to investigate the possibility of developing a more benign solvent system to facilitate truly large-scale production.During the ethanol-based precursor solution formation process, ethanol is used to dissolve copper(II) chloride, zinc(II) chloride, tin(II) chloride, and excess TAA to form precursor complexes at room temperature. Here having an excess amount of TAA is essential for the formation of a transparent yellow precursor solution, and metal chlorides and TAA are used as metal and sulfur sources, respectively. The major issue encountered by this approach relates to the benign coexistence of copper with tin, as large quantities of white slurry appear when Cu(II) encounters Sn(II) in the ethanol solution. Here we present a way to incorporate soluble copper and tin constituents into ethanol in a completely dissolved form. By forming complexes using a TAA coordinating agent, copper and tin can be efficiently incorporated into ethanol-based precursor solutions as a soluble reactant.UV-vis-near-IR absorption is a very simple method and applicable to explore the structure change and formation of the complex.23 In order to analyze the coordinating environment of metal ions with TAA by using spectrophotometry, ethanol solutions containing copper chloride were prepared in the presence of different amounts of TAA as a typical example. Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis-near-IR absorption spectra of a 0.01 mol L−1 CuCl2 ethanol solution in the presence of different amount of TAA, and the absorption spectra consist of two parts. Fig. 1  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra and (b) near-IR spectra of a 0.01 mol L−1 CuCl2 ethanol solution in the presence of different amounts of TAA. In the ultraviolet-visible region between 200 and 400 nm, intense charge-transfer bands can be observed, whereas the weaker d–d transition (d9 electronic configuration of Cu(II)) is absorbing in the red and near-infrared region between 700 and 1500 nm. In the sample of pure CuCl2 ethanol solution, one main peak at 286 nm is observed in the UV-vis part of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1a). With increasing TAA content, the absorption band with a maximum high intensity is observed at 267 nm due to π → π* transitions, which shows a hypsochromic shift in the spectra of mixed CuCl2 with TAA due to the polarization within the chromophore, most likely caused by the metal–ligand interactions. In the meantime, a low intensity maximum at 314 nm is also observed, which is tentatively assigned to the n → π* orbital.24,25 The d–d transition is much broader than the charge-transfer bands, and the general trend is that the intensity of the transition decreases upon increasing the TAA content. In the near-IR absorption spectrum of copper(II) chloride in ethanol, with a concentration of 0.01 mol L−1 (Fig. 1b), a broad band with a maximum at around 890 nm is exhibited, which gradually decreases and eventually disappears with increasing concentrations of TAA, from 0.005 mol L−1 to 0.04 mol L−1. This large difference in intensity can be attributed to the fact that Cu(II) in ethanol converts to a Cu–TAA complex with the increase of TAA concentration. The coordination between Zn(II), Sn(II) and TAA has a similar trend in the absorption spectra to that of Cu(II) with TAA, which proves that the position of absorption bands does not appear to be affected much by the nature of the metal ion in the complex.24 These results support the strong coordination between copper(II) and TAA and lead to the formation of stable complexes in ethanol.When Cu(II) encounters Sn(II) in the ethanol solution containing chloride ions, large quantities of white slurry appear, then a transparent precursor solution can be seen after adding excess TAA. So the formation process of the precursor solution has been proposed to follow eqn (1)–(5). 2Cu2+ + Sn2+ + 2Cl− → 2CuCl↓ + Sn4+(1) CuCl + 2TAA → [Cu(TAA)2]Cl(2) Sn4+ + 2TAA + 4Cl− → [Sn(TAA)2]Cl4(3) Zn2+ + 2TAA + 2Cl− → [Zn(TAA)2]Cl2(4) [Cu(TAA)2]Cl + [Zn(TAA)2]Cl2 + [Sn(TAA)2]Cl4 → CZTS precursor solution(5)The overall redox chemical reaction (1) in ethanol explains the reason why the white slurry appears. As we know that the oxidation–reduction reaction between Cu(II) and Sn(II) happens, since the standard redox potential value φθ of Cu2+/Cu+ is slightly bigger than that of Sn4+/Sn2+.25 Here CuCl could not be dissolved in ethanol, due to the solubility value of CuCl (Ksp) being less than 10−5.26 After adding excess TAA to the above solution, the CuCl white precipitate disappears quickly because of the strong coordination between CuCl with TAA which forms stable complexes, according to reaction (2). Under the same conditions, Zn(II) and Sn(IV) could coordinate with TAA in ethanol, as described by reactions (3) and (4). Note: an excess amount of TAA was added in order to both guarantee the formation of a stable precursor solution, and prevent secondary phases (such as Cu2S, ZnS, and SnS) and S loss.27 Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the homogenous CZTS precursor solution is the mixture of three different metal–TAA complexes (see eqn (5)).To ascertain the structure of metal–TAA complexes, which is useful for understanding the following discussion about the formation mechanism of CZTS precursor substances, the IR spectra of TAA and its metal complexes are also presented in Fig. 2. The band at 720 cm−1 in pure TAA solution (Fig. 2a) is assigned to the CS stretching vibration. The bands at 1480 cm−1 and 1650 cm−1 should be related to coupled vibrations of C–N stretching and N–H bending, respectively.28 In the sample of Cu–TAA (Fig. 2b) and Sn–TAA (Fig. 2d) ethanol solution, those three bands shift toward an obvious lower frequency on complexation. In the sample of Zn–TAA (Fig. 2c), the three bands shift a very small distance. The CS stretching band shifts towards lower frequency to 680 cm−1 in the spectrum of the Cu–Zn–Sn–TAA precursor complex (Fig. 2e). It indicates that the band order CS in precursor complex has been reduced. The other two bands of C–N stretching and N–H bending undergo red shifts and move to 1450 cm−1 and 1620 cm−1 in the spectrum of Cu–Zn–Sn–TAA complex precursor, respectively. Besides, peaks at 720, 1480, and 1650 cm−1 belonging to pure TAA, can also be seen; this is because excess TAA was added in the process of preparing the precursor solution. The shifts in absorption bands indicate that TAA strongly interacts with metal ions through both sulfur and nitrogen sites. Thus, in each complex, TAA coordinates to the central metal ion through N and S atoms. It is concluded that the TAA acts as both a bidentate chelating agent and the sulfur source. Our results are in agreement with other reports,29 in which IR spectra and the electronic spectra were carried out to determine the structural formula of cobalt(II), nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of TAA. Based on the results of both the UV-vis-near-IR spectra and the IR absorption spectra, it is reasonable to ascribe the structure of three metal–TAA complexes in ethanol in Fig. 3. Fig. 2  FT-IR spectra of (a) pure TAA, (b) Cu–TAA, (c) Zn–TAA, (d) Sn–TAA, and (e) Cu–Zn–Sn–TAA complex precursor solution.  Fig. 3  Proposed structures of the metal–TAA complexes, M = Cu, Zn, or Sn, x = 1, 2 or 4. The procedure of ethanol-based deposition technology for CZTSSe absorber film can be described in four steps: preparing a transparent precursor solution, dip-coating, drying and annealing under Se vapor. Underneath this simple description, however, the formation of high quality chalcopyrite films is governed by drying temperature and annealing temperature, at which the precursor complexes in solution decompose to CZTS precursor film and finally to CZTS film.In the ethanol-based solution system, extra TAA is incorporated into the precursor solutions, a substantial amount of which is chemically bonded to metal atoms even prior to deposition. As the deposited films are dried, the metal–TAA precursor complexes in solution act as building blocks to construct a three-dimensional framework, incorporating the three different metal–TAA coordination compounds.A portion of precursor powder obtained by drying the precursor solution at room temperature is used for the TG analysis (Fig. 4). The TG data represent the decomposition of the metal–TAA frameworks and formation of the CZTS phase from room temperature to 650 °C. The structure of precursor frameworks is maintained up to about 100 °C before being subjected to dramatic weight loss, which means that the precursor complex can be easily decomposed at lower temperature. An excess amount of TAA was added in the ethanol solution system in order to form a stable precursor solution, which means that there are many coordinated TAA and free TAA molecules co-existing in the precursor solution. The first stage of weight loss starts at around 100 °C up to 250 °C and is likely caused by the thermal decomposition of free TAA, a small amount of coordinated TAA, and the solvent residue. Note: the complex usually has a higher melting point compared with pure TAA, which means that coordinated TAA is more stable than the free one. The second major weight loss centered around 300 °C in the TG data and largely corresponds to the total thermal decomposition of metal–TAA complexes, which leads to the release of volatile species and the formation of the CZTS precursor substance (such as Cu2S, ZnS, and SnS), and finally the transformation from the CZTS precursor substance into the CZTS phase. Further annealing from 350 to 650 °C does not lead to significant weight loss, indicating the possible formation of the CZTS phase. According to the TG result, the structure of metal–TAA complex frameworks is maintained up to about 100 °C, so the thermolysis temperature of the precursor film can be regulated from 100 to 250 °C. Fig. 4  Thermogravimetric analysis of the precursor powder obtained by drying the precursor solution at room temperature. The FT-IR analysis can also help to determine the thermolysis temperature of the precursor film. Some portions of precursor powder, prepared by drying the precursor solution at different temperatures, were subjected to FT-IR characterization. Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra of complex precursor powder dried at 25, 120, and 130 °C, respectively, and pure TAA. The assignment of absorption bands to different vibrational modes is given in Table 1. The bands at 690, 1450, and 1620 cm−1 in the spectrum of the precursor solution dried at 25 and 120 °C (Fig. 5b and c), are in good agreement with the IR absorption analysis in Fig. 2, which correspond to CS, C–N, and N–H bonds in precursor complexes. These three absorption bands undergo a red shift in comparison with those of pure TAA (Fig. 5a). The absorption bands at 690 cm−1 disappear when the precursor solution was dried at 130 °C (the assignment of the dotted area in Fig. 5), which indicates that the metal–TAA complex begins to obviously decompose at 130 °C. These results are in agreement with the TG analysis. Fig. 5  FT-IR spectra of (a) pure TAA, and precursor powders prepared by drying the precursor solution at (b) 25 °C, (c) 120 °C, (d) 130 °C.

However, a higher thermolysis temperature can lead to cracks and porosity in films due to sudden release of volatile products from layers underneath. It is found that drying at 130 °C for 10 min is sufficient for the conversion of a transparent metal–TAA complex layer into black shiny CZTS precursor films.Regardless of the difficulties related to its structural and compositional characterization because of the precursor's amorphous nature, the unique precursor formed by drying ethanol-based precursor solutions enables the transformation to the chalcopyrite phase to occur at exceptionally low temperatures. When subjected to thermal annealing, the as-deposited amorphous CZTS precursor yields a partially crystalline chalcopyrite phase at temperatures as low as 350 °C as stated in TG analysis and the following XRD analysis. XRD patterns of several precursor films fabricated using different final annealing temperatures are applied to illustrate the low-temperature formation of the CZTS phase.XRD patterns of the as-dried precursor film after annealing at 200, 300, 350, 400 and 430 °C are shown in Fig. 6, and the background of the Mo substrate has been deducted in advance. For the XRD patterns of the precursor film annealed at 200, 300 and 350 °C, three obvious peaks at 28.5°, 47.3°, 56.1° appear, and at the same time, three obvious peaks at 14.7°, 34.4°, 49.57° could also be observed, which are indexed to the CuSn3.75S8 phase (JCPDS 75-2266). At 400 °C, three intense peaks at 28.5°, 47.3°, 56.1° corresponding to the three reflections (112), (220), and (312) of the kesterite CZTS structure became apparent (JCPDS 26-0575). At 430 °C, the pattern essentially follows that of the pattern obtained at 400 °C, except with a decrease of full-width at half-maximum, which indicates an increase in grain size. Based on the observations in the XRD patterns at various temperatures, the reaction pathway of this ethanol-based CZTS is different from that of other liquid-phase coating methods, which generally utilize dispersing agents to suspend nano- or micro-scale metallic, oxide, sulfide, or selenide particles,17,30 at elevated temperature. This molecular-scale homogeneity of the precursor solution enables the capacity to form a homogeneous kesterite CZTS phase without the need for long range diffusion between different precursor phases, as might be expected in these inhomogeneous slurry systems.4 Upon drying of the homogenous CZTS precursor solution on the Mo coated glass substrate, which is a mixture of three metal–TAA complexes, the amorphous compound can be obtained. This amorphous precursor then decomposes into the chalcopyrite phase starting at temperatures as low as 200 °C. This lower annealing temperature can be beneficial to achieve uniform distribution of Cu, Zn, and Sn over a large area, which is an important factor for improving the efficiency of CZTS solar cells. Fig. 6  X-ray diffraction of the as dried precursor films after annealing at 200, 300, 350, 400, and 430 °C. Reflections of CZTS are marked with (#), and CuSn3.75S8 are marked with (*). It should be noted that three XRD diffraction peaks at around 2θ = 28.5°, 47.3°, and 56.1° overlap with those of Cu2S, Cu2SnS3 and ZnS, so the crystallization of the CZTS phase cannot be confirmed solely by XRD analysis. The Raman spectra shown in Fig. 7 are supportive of these suggested reaction procedures and the absence of binary phases. The precursor film annealed at 200 °C exhibited a strong and broad peak at 475 cm−1, which corresponds to the Cu2S phase. Meanwhile, peaks at 336 and 352 cm−1 featuring the Cu2SnS3 phase and the cubic ZnS phase peak located at 348 cm−1 were also observed. These undesirable phases disappear completely when annealed at 430 °C, which is in good agreement with the XRD and TG results. For samples annealed at 400 and 430 °C, a very strong peak at 338 cm−1 was observed corresponding to a kesterite CZTS phase. There was no SnS2 phase peak located at 310 cm−1 after the annealing treatment. Raman analysis combining XRD and TG analysis indicate that from 130 to 350 °C, the reaction proceeds from Cu2S and ZnS to CuSn3.75S8 and finally to the CZTS phase. Above 400 °C, CZTS keeps stable up to at least 500 °C. Fig. 7  Raman spectra of the as dried precursor films after annealing at 200, 300, 350, 400, and 430 °C. Many reports have detected ternary chalcogenide (e.g. Cu2SnS3) as an intermediate phase or have claimed that the similar formation of kesterite is governed by the following solid-state reaction:Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursor → Binary and ternary chalcogenides → CuSn3.75S8 + ZnS → Cu2ZnSnS4 phaseThe ethanol-based process, which is the same as the hydrazine process, steps directly into a state between CuSn3.75S8 + ZnS and Cu2ZnSnS4 phase after the removal of TAA ligands. The remaining reaction route is hence simple and feasible.In comparison with coevaporation or the two-stage selenization process governed by solid-state reactions, temperatures beyond 500 °C are needed in order to augment long-range atomic diffusion and obtain a homogeneous chalcopyrite film from the precursor phases Cu2S, ZnS, and SnS or from stacked layers of Cu/SnS2/ZnS metallic precursors.31–33 The rapid phase evolution even at relatively low temperatures suggests a small activation energy for the decomposition of the original precursor complex. The observed low reaction temperatures can be reduced to weaken the co-ordination between metal ions and TAA and highly volatile ethanol and also metal–TAA complexes spontaneously decompose to directly form the chalcogenide phases. These results are in agreement with the decomposition of the hydrazine-based precursor systems.1,4,34ConclusionsWe have studied the reaction mechanisms of the ethanol-based solution process, involved in the overall transformation from the homogenous precursor solution to the solid-state framework and finally to the CZTS phase during deposition and subsequent thermal treatment. Here we have found that, the homogenous CZTS precursor solution is a mixture of three different metal–TAA complexes by adding excess amounts of TAA into the mixed three metal chloride ethanol solution. The complexes formed in the precursor solutions facilitate the formation of the CZTS phase at relatively low temperatures, which could greatly reduce the sulfur loss during pyrolysis so as to ensure the film composition, and also without the need for long-range diffusion by any of the involved species. The complexes build up an ordered framework upon drying and transform to a CuSn3.75S8 phase and finally to a CZTS phase after subsequent annealing. Since solar cells, fabricated with the CZTSSe thin film deposited from an ethanol-based solution, exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 5.36% in our previous study, the present homogenous ethanol-based solution processing has tremendous potential for application in low-cost, high-quality semiconductor films at relatively low fabrication temperatures. Furthermore, ethanol is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and stable chemical, which might be used as alternative solvent for hydrazine. However, further study is needed in order to improve the stability of ethanol-based precursor solutions, as the present ethanol-based precursor solution is metastable, which can keep stable for at most 5 h in air and then turns into large quantity of white slurry accompanied by color changes from yellow to purple red.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by the Beijing Postdoctoral Research Foundation, the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing (no. 2122005), and Tianjin City Application Foundation and Advanced Technology Research Program (12JCZDJC21700).Notes and referencesW.-C.
