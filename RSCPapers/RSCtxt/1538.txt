    , Accepted 17th December 2014First published on 18th December 2014AbstractBulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a solution-processed ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) were fabricated, and the effects of surface modification of the ZnO ETL by H-plasma treatment on the device performance were systemically investigated. It was found that the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the BHJ solar cells was dramatically improved after H-plasma treatment, while the short-circuit current density (JSC) exhibited a consistent decrease with increasing H-plasma treatment time. Both Kelvin probe force microscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate that the improved VOC is attributed to the reduced work function of ZnO caused by H-plasma treatment, while photoluminescence spectra suggest that the inefficient exciton dissociation associated with the H-plasma treatment leads to a decrease in JSC with tH. After 2.5 min of H-plasma treatment, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells was increased from 3.03% to 3.84% with a high VOC of 0.670 V, corresponding to an improvement of 27%. This work provides a novel and efficient route to improving the VOC and thus the efficiency of BHJ solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure have attracted considerable attention because of their light weight and potentially low cost from coating at low temperatures on flexible substrates. In conventional BHJ solar cells, a blend of a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and a low work-function metal cathode, such as Al. In such a configuration, direct electrical contacts between the interfaces of the active layer and electrodes result in significant recombination loss and inferior photovoltaic performance. To address this issue, an interfacial layer (IFL) has been adopted to modify electrode contacts, providing for work function control and, in some cases, selective collection of holes and electrons at opposite contacts.1–3 For instance, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs for more efficient hole collection via alignment of the work functions of the P3HT and ITO anode, as well as improvement of device stability by planarizing the ITO surface.1–3
Besides HTL, the performance of BHJ solar cells can also be improved by adding an electron transport layer (ETL) that facilitates the electron transport from the active layer to the top metal electrode and blocks holes from reaching the top electrode, as well as protecting the active layer from oxygen and water from the atmosphere.1–3 Due to their chemical resistance to oxygen and moisture, high electron mobility, and excellent optical transparency, wide band-gap metal-oxide-semiconductors, such as TiO2 and ZnO, have emerged as an important class of electron transport materials.4–20 ZnO is an n-type, wide band-gap semiconductor with a conduction band (CB) of 4.1 eV relative to vacuum. The CB edge of ZnO is lower than the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM (3.9 eV), therefore facilitating electron extraction from the P3HT:PCBM active layer. Furthermore, ZnO is also expected to perform as a hole blocking layer because of its low-lying valence band (VB) (7.5 eV). Other advantages of using ZnO as an ETL include its high electron mobility and solution processability, as well as the tunable electrical properties of ZnO films. Actually, improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and lifetime were widely reported when a solution-processed ZnO was adopted as an ETL in both conventional and inverted BHJ solar cells.7–14 The PSCs with solution-processed TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), Cs-doped TiO2 NP- and ZnO NP-based ETLs were systematically studied with several low band-gap polymers by You et al.20 They found that the device performance correlates strongly with the effect of the ETL on series resistance, and the ZnO NPs were the best in every category and in considering the overall performance. Solution processable ZnO was even successfully applied to roll-to-roll processing of inverted PSCs.21
Recently, modification of ZnO ETLs has been used for altering the work function and surface properties to further improve device performance.16–19 The contact properties between the ZnO and metal electrodes can be systematically tuned by interfacial modification with a series of carboxylic-acid-based dipolar self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).16,17 With appropriate choice of SAM modifiers, the efficiency of PSCs is greatly improved, and even high-work-function metals, such as Ag and Au, can be used efficiently as cathodes.18,19 Furthermore, by using a surface-modified ZnO–polymer nanocomposite ETL, Small et al. have demonstrated improved charge collection efficiency in inverted PSCs based on a low band-gap polymer with a certified PCE of 7.4%.22 We previously reported that H atoms can diffuse into ZnO films by H-plasma exposure and remarkably modify their electrical and optical properties.23,24 The incorporated H atoms not only introduce shallow donor states, but also passivate most of the defects. As a result, the H-plasma treatment can both enhance the conductivity of ZnO films and improve their transmittance.23 In addition, the field emission characteristics of the H-plasma treated ZnO films were considerably improved, implying the work function of ZnO can be tuned by H-plasma treatment.24 Obviously, these properties of ZnO from modification by H-plasma treatment have the potential to improve the performance of BHJ solar cells, via a ZnO thin layer introduced as the ETL.
In this work, BHJ solar cells with a solution-processed ZnO ETL were fabricated, and the effects of surface modification of the ZnO ETL by H-plasma treatment on the device performance were systemically investigated. P3HT:PCBM was used as the active layer, because it is one of the most commonly investigated material for PSCs and it is easy to fabricate. It was found that H-plasma treatment for an appropriate time leads to a significantly improved open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.670 eV, which is the highest value reported so far for PSCs based on the P3HT:PCBM system.25 The reduced work function of ZnO due to the H-plasma treatment was experimentally confirmed and is considered to be the primary reason for the increased VOC. On the other hand, the inefficient exciton dissociation associated with the H-plasma treatment results in a decrease of short-circuit current density (JSC). This work provides a novel and efficient route to improving the VOC and thus the efficiency of BHJ solar cells.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Fabrication of polymer solar cells
The PSCs with an active area of 0.04 cm2 used in this study have the following architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/Al, as shown in Fig. 1a. An energy level diagram of the corresponding device is presented in Fig. 1b. Prior to the fabrication of devices, the ITO-coated (15 Ω sq.−1) glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried with nitrogen. Then, a 35 nm anodic buffer layer was deposited through spin-coating PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083, H. C. Stark) onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s and then thermally annealing them at 130 °C for 15 min in air. Next, the samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box to prepare the P3HT:PCBM active layer. A mixed solution of P3HT (Rieke Metals, 10 mg ml−1) and PCBM (Lum Tec. Co. Ltd, 8 mg ml−1) dissolved in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on top of the buffer layer, resulting in a ∼120 nm thick photoactive layer. Subsequently, the ETL was deposited through spin-coating a butyl alcohol solution of ZnO nanoparticles, which was prepared with zinc acetate dihydrate and KOH as reported previously.26 The thickness of the ZnO layer was about 35 nm, as measured by a surface profilometry. To complete the device, a 100 nm Al cathode was deposited on the ZnO ETL by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.5 nm s−1. Finally, the device was annealed at 130 °C for 20 min on a hotplate under nitrogen.

2.2 Surface modification of ZnO ETL
For modifying the ZnO ETL, before deposition of the Al cathode, we directly immersed the devices in a radio-frequency (13.56 MHz) H-plasma in a capacitively coupled plasma reactor. Prior to plasma treatment, the chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 1.0 × 10−4 Pa and then filled the chamber with H2 to a working pressure of 150 Pa. During plasma treatment, the radio-frequency power and the substrate temperature were kept at 30 W and room temperature, respectively.
2.3 Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were taken with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) in air. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions after illuminating the cells with a monochromator. The surface morphologies and surface potential data were mapped by atomic force microscopy (AFM, NT-MDT Solver P47) using a standard two-pass procedure in air in which each topography line acquired in tapping mode is followed by the acquisition of a Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) line in a lift mode. Both a DC signal and an AC signal at the resonant frequency of the cantilever were applied to the metal-coated AFM probe while the tip was lifted 10 nm above the sample surface. Assuming a perfectly metallic capacitor, the surface potential Vsur is the difference in work function of the tip and the sample divided by the elementary charge. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out using synchrotron radiation at beam line 4B9B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of samples on silica substrates were recorded with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer in a double-beam mode. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using the 532 nm excitation wavelength with a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 spectrometer at room temperature. Raman spectra were acquired with the same spectrometer using the 514 nm excitation line. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku Dmax 2500 diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray source.
3. Results and discussion
Surface modification of ZnO ETLs plays an important role for improving the performance of BHJ solar cells. In this work, to further improve the device performance, the ZnO ETLs were exposed to H-plasma for various times before deposition of the Al cathode. In each ITO substrate, 8 solar cells were fabricated, which were defined by the overlapped areas of the Al layer and ITO layer. Among the 8 solar cells in the same ITO substrate, if the maximum PCE deviation was less than 3% in at least 6 solar cells with higher PCE values, then their performance parameters were recorded. The highest PCE values in the records were adopted here for comparison. Fig. 2a depicts the corresponding J–V characteristics of these treated devices recorded under AM 1.5G illumination. For comparison, the J–V curve of the reference device without H-plasma treatment is also included in Fig. 2a, and the performance data of all the devices are summarized in Table 1. The reference device has a VOC of 0.612 V, a JSC of 9.90 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.500, resulting in a total PCE of 3.03%. The value of VOC is found to show an initial rise when the H-plasma treatment time (tH) is less than 2.5 min, giving rise to a maximum value of 0.670 V, and then displays a slight decrease as the tH further increases. Importantly, all the H-plasma-treated devices exhibit a much higher VOC (0.640–0.670 V) than that of the reference cell (0.612 V). The FF exhibits a similar dependence on tH to the VOC, and the highest FF value of 0.615 is obtained for the 2.5 min treated device. However, unlike the VOC and FF, the JSC gradually decreases from 9.90 mA cm−2 to 8.53 mA cm−2 with increasing tH. Furthermore, from the EQE spectra shown in Fig. 2b, it can be found that the value of EQE reduces with tH, displaying the same variation tendency as with JSC. Ultimately, due to the H-plasma treatment, the PCE increases from 3.03% for the reference cell, to a maximum of 3.84% for the 2.5 min treated device, then decreases to 2.75% when the tH further increases to 10 min. Furthermore, we also note that the JSC calculated from integrating the EQE spectra against the AM 1.5 solar spectrum is lower than the values reported in Table 1. The discrepancy between the two measurements is ascribed to the spectral mismatch between the EQE source and the solar simulator, as well as the limited wavelength range of the EQE source (λ < 370 nm), which underestimates the current from the EQE spectra.27 Moreover, the JSC values are sensitive to the angle of incidence of illumination. The EQE measurements use a tightly focused source, while the solar simulator has a slight angular distribution, which also leads to the lower current from the EQE measurements.27

The above results indicate that the VOC and the FF of BHJ solar cells are significantly improved by modifying their ZnO ETLs with H-plasma treatment. It is well known that the VOC of BHJ solar cells correlates closely with the work function of the electrodes and IFLs.1–3,28 In order to evaluate the effects of the H-plasma treatment on the work function of ZnO, KPFM measurements were performed on the Si/ZnO films treated with H-plasma for 0, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 min, and the corresponding KPFM images are displayed in Fig. 3a–e. As seen in Fig. 3a, there are some bright spots in the surface potential image for the reference sample, indicating that the surface potentials of these spots are higher than the other regions. After H-plasma treatment, fewer bright spots can be seen and the surface potential distribution is more homogeneous, as shown in Fig. 3b–e. For the reference sample, the average value of surface potential is 232 mV within the scanning area of 3 μm × 3 μm, while it reduces to 36 mV for the 2.5 min treated sample, suggesting that the H-plasma treatment results in a work function shift of the ZnO film.29,30 In principle, the work function of ZnO film can be determined according to the measured surface potential Vsur, which is actually the contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample surface and the actual probe. However, the CPD method relies on the stability of the work function of AFM probes and is also sensitive to the measurement environment. Thus, we took the Vsur shift (ΔVsur = Vsur (after treatment) − Vsur (without treatment)) to characterize the relative change of the ZnO work function, where Vsur is the averaged value over an area of 3 μm × 3 μm and the as-grown ZnO film was used as a reference standard. In Fig. 3h, the ΔVsur is plotted as a function of tH. It can be clearly seen that the ΔVsur gradually decreases to about −0.20 V for tH less than 2.5 min and as the tH further increases, the ΔVsur increases slightly. Furthermore, the AFM height images of the ZnO films, as shown in Fig. 3f and g, indicate that the surface roughness and morphologies of the ZnO films treated with H-plasma for 5 min are similar to those of the reference sample without treatment. Therefore, the KPFM data suggest that the work function of ZnO can be tuned by H-plasma treatment and the surface potential measurements are consistent qualitatively with the change in VOC after H-plasma treatment, as given in Table 1.

The variation trend of ZnO work function with tH is clearly demonstrated by KPFM measurements. However, it is difficult to obtain an absolute work function value with KPFM because contamination can alter the work function of a surface. To quantitatively determine the work function of the ZnO films, the UPS spectra were obtained under ultra-high vacuum conditions using 30 eV photon energy for both the H-plasma treated Si/ZnO film and the reference Si/ZnO sample, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be clearly seen that both films reveal the characteristic peak with binding energy at ∼6 eV caused by the O 2p valence band, at ∼8.5 eV caused by the Zn 4s, and at ∼11 eV from the Zn 3d bulk feature.31 For the as-grown ZnO film, the valence band edge is located at 3.29 eV below the Fermi level, which is similar to the previous report.32 Importantly, the secondary electron cutoff in the treated sample shifts toward a higher binding energy, indicating that H-plasma treatment reduces the work function of ZnO. The work function Φ of ZnO can be determined from: Φ = hν − (Ecutoff − EF), where hν is the photon energy (30 eV), EF is the Fermi level, and Ecutoff is the inelastic high-binding-energy cutoff, which can be extracted using a linear extrapolation of the high-binding-energy cutoff region of the UPS spectra. The work functions of the ZnO films are calculated to be 4.13 ± 0.05 eV and 3.98 ± 0.05 eV before and after H-plasma treatment, respectively, corresponding to a work function reduction of 0.15 eV by the H-plasma treatment. To confirm the origin of the work function change, the H-plasma treated ZnO film was in situ annealed under vacuum at 500 °C for 30 min, and the UPS spectrum was then taken for the annealed sample, as shown by the top curve in Fig. 4. After annealing, the secondary electron cutoff obviously shifts to lower binding energy compared with that of the H-plasma treated sample. The work function of the annealed ZnO film is found to be 4.09 ± 0.05 eV from the photoemission cutoff, which is only slightly lower than the initial value of the as-grown sample. It has been reported that annealing at 500 °C is sufficient to evolve H atoms out of ZnO.23,33 As a result, the H concentration on the ZnO surface decreases after annealing due to H diffusion and desorption processes, and the work function recovery of ZnO is attributed to the release of H atoms caused by annealing.

The results of both KPFM and UPS measurements reveal that the work function of the ZnO film is indeed reduced by H-plasma treatment, and it can be tentatively explained by the following. First, exposing ZnO to H-plasma leads to the formation of surface dipoles through the interaction of H with the ZnO surface, which gives rise to a reduction of the ZnO work function. Actually, a lower and even negative electron affinity (thus lower work function) was usually observed at the surface terminated with H atoms for various wide band-gap semiconductors, e.g., diamond and boron nitride.34,35 Besides, compared with the as-grown ZnO film, the H-plasma treatment leads to an increase of the electron concentration,23 and thus the up-shift of the Fermi level, resulting in the lower work function of ZnO. In a word, the reduction in ZnO work function after H-plasma treatment is attributed to the formation of surface dipoles and/or the up-shift of the Fermi level. However, the slight decrease in work function at longer tH (Fig. 3f) is unclear at this stage and will be subjected to further investigation.
Although the VOC of the BHJ solar cell was remarkably improved after H-plasma treatment, the JSC was obviously decreased with increasing tH. As demonstrated in our previous study,23 the conductivity and transmittance of ZnO films are enhanced after H-plasma treatment, which should be favorable to the improvement of JSC. Moreover, it has been reported that H atoms can diffuse into ZnO films with a depth of more than 1 μm by H-plasma exposure.24 In the present case, H atoms may penetrate through the entire ZnO layer and diffuse into the P3HT:PCBM active layer, because the thickness of ZnO ETL is only about 35 nm. Therefore, we propose that the reduction of JSC might result from the degradation of active layer materials induced by these incorporated H atoms. To investigate the effects of H-plasma treatment on the properties of the active layer, various techniques were used to characterize the active layer. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO film on quartz substrates for various H-plasma exposure times were obtained, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the absorption intensities of these films are very close to one another, with a variation below 4%. The small difference in absorption intensity for these films may be attributed to the slight deviation of the film thickness, and thus the influence of H-plasma treatment on the light absorption can be excluded. The XRD patterns of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO film obtained before and after H-plasma treatment are shown in Fig. S1 in ESI.† For both samples, besides the diffraction peak of the ITO substrate at 21.25°, only one peak at 5.33° originating from P3HT crystallites with a-axis orientation (backbone parallel and side-chains perpendicular to the substrate) is observed.36,37 Importantly, the intensity and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the P3HT (100) peak are almost unchanged, indicating that the crystallinity and size of P3HT are not influenced by the H-plasma treatment.36,37 Furthermore, the Raman spectra of the Si/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO film obtained before and after H-plasma treatment (ESI, Fig. S2†) are also nearly the same, implying that the H-plasma treatment has little effect on the molecular structure of P3HT or the phase separation of the P3HT:PCBM blend films.38

Fig. 6 shows the room temperature PL spectra of the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO films on Si substrates for various H-plasma exposure times. Two emission peaks of P3HT are centered at 635 nm and 692 nm, and the PL intensity continuously rises with increasing H-plasma exposure time. In general, PL intensity changes can be caused by light absorption and/or exciton quenching.2 Herein, the possibility of changes in light absorption is eliminated, because the light absorption of the active layer does not change significantly after H-plasma treatment, as demonstrated in Fig. 5. On the other hand, the change in PL intensity can provide evidence for exciton recombination, because once the singlet exciton has been dissociated, it can no longer decay radiatively to the ground state.39 Increasing PL intensity with tH means that the exciton generated in the photoactive layer has not been efficiently dissociated. In addition, a sharp emission peak at 576.5 nm is observed in Fig. 6 (the PL was excited at 532 nm), which can be attributed to the Raman signal of CαCβ stretching of the aromatic thiophene ring (∼1450 cm−1).38 As seen from the inset of Fig. 6, the peak intensities for all the samples are nearly the same, implying that the thicknesses of the P3HT:PCBM films are almost identical. This result indicates that the observed change of the PL intensity indeed results from the exciton quenching, rather than the difference in film thickness or other factors. However, the exact mechanism for the change in exciton dissociation rate is still unclear and may be related to defects induced by the H-plasma treatment. Further investigation is required to clarify this speculation. Regardless of the mechanism, the PL spectra results show that the decrease in JSC with tH is associated with less efficient dissociation of photo-generated excitons.

As described above, due to the reduction of the ZnO work function caused by the H-plasma treatment, the VOC of device was improved dramatically, which can be easily understood based on its energy level diagram as shown in Fig. 1b. On the contrary, the less efficient dissociation of photo-generated excitons associated with the H-plasma treatment results in a decrease in JSC with tH. Furthermore, it also should be noted that the FF is remarkably improved after H-plasma treatment for a suitable time and it then decreases as the tH increases further. There are several factors, such as series resistance (Rs), shunt resistance (Rsh), diode factor n, and reverse saturation current density, that can significantly influence FF, and these factors are very intricately tied to one another.40 In this work, the relatively low FF value of 0.500 for the reference device may be ascribed to the high Rs because of the low conductivity of ZnO. Our previous work indicated that the conductivity of ZnO films can be improved by two orders of magnitude after H-plasma treatment.23 The enhanced conductivity of a ZnO film by H-plasma treatment is favorable for reducing the Rs and thus improving the FF. Moreover, an increase in VOC itself will also lead to a higher FF, as discussed previously.40 However, on the other hand, the slightly enhanced recombination due to inefficient exciton dissociation related with the H-plasma treatment will result in lower FF. Because of the trade-off between the positive and negative effects, the highest FF of the BHJ solar cells was achieved at tH = 2.5 min.
4. Conclusions
The effects of surface modification of ZnO ETLs by H-plasma treatment on the performance of bulk heterojunction PSCs have been systemically investigated. It was found that the VOC of the PSCs was dramatically improved after H-plasma treatment, while the JSC exhibited a gradual decrease with increasing tH, resulting in a highest efficiency of 3.84% with a maximum VOC of 0.670 V for the 2.5 min treated device. The improved VOC is attributed to the reduced work function of ZnO caused by the H-plasma treatment, which was clearly revealed by both KPFM and UPS measurements. PL spectra indicate that the inefficient exciton dissociation related with the H-plasma treatment is responsible for a decrease of the JSC. The method we report herein provides a novel and efficient route for developing high performance PSCs by improving the VOCvia H-plasma treatment.
