    , Accepted 28th September 2022First published on 29th September 2022AbstractThe commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs) requires the realization of highly efficient devices from low-cost polymer donors with excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility and universality matching with different electron acceptors. Herein, PTTzF, a structurally simple linear conjugated polymer with a donor–acceptor alternating structure toward practical application is developed. The polymer can be synthesized within ten steps of the reaction from cheap raw chemicals, making it much more easily accessible than the existing high-performance polymer donors. Meanwhile, the polymer is able to produce over 18% efficiency in OSCs, which renders it one of the most efficient polymer donors reported to date. Besides, PTTzF exhibits excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility benefiting from the good control of molecular weights within a certain range through rational selection of the comonomer with appropriate polymerization reactivity, which is beneficial for future scale-up synthesis from laboratory to factory. The polymer also exhibits good universality with different acceptors, including fullerene derivatives, A–D–A and A–DA'D–A type non-fullerene acceptors, which offer a capability to match with the currently existing and future potential acceptors. The merits of low cost, high efficiency, excellent reproducibility, and good universality make PTTzF an ideal polymer donor for real world applications of OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising next generation photovoltaic technology due to their light weight, solution processability, and their prospect in fabricating large-scale flexible devices. However, the commercialization of OSCs is limited by the challenges in reproducible fabrication of high-efficiency devices from photoactive materials with low synthetic complexity and good up-scalability. In this work, we report a structurally simple linear conjugated polymer PTTzF, which can be synthesized easily from cheap raw chemicals and offered an impressive power conversion efficiency of 18.01% in OSCs. Besides, this polymer showed a highly reproducible photovoltaic performance due to well-controlled molecular weights through rational selection of a comonomer with appropriate reactivity. Moreover, the polymer exhibited good universality with different acceptors, which offers a capability to match with the currently existing and future potential high-performance acceptors. The merits of low synthetic complexity, high efficiency, excellent reproducibility, and good universality make PTTzF a promising candidate for large-scale manufacturing and practical application of OSCs.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), a promising next generation solar energy conversion technology, have received widespread attention and achieved rapid development due to the advantages of light weight, solution processability, and mechanical flexibility.1–5 Significant breakthroughs of OSCs have been achieved in the past few years benefiting from the innovation of photovoltaic polymer donors and non-fullerene small molecular acceptors,6–10 the progress of device engineering,11,12 and in-depth studies on morphology regulation.13–20 Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have achieved great enhancement, the limitations in device stability,21 scale-up manufacturing,22 green solvent processing,23 and low production cost24–27 remain urgent problems to be addressed for the practical application of OSCs. Notably, the reproducible fabrication of efficient photovoltaic devices from photoactive materials with low-cost and scalable synthesis is one of the prerequisites for the industrialization of OSCs. Therefore, much effort should be devoted to the design and synthesis of polymer donors toward the practical application of OSCs.
In view of this, the polymer donors for real world application should meet a few general requirements. First, the polymer donors should be readily accessed via simple synthesis without sacrificing device efficiency. Nowadays, the high-performance polymer donors that can afford over 18% efficiency are almost monopolized by thiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) polymers, such as PM6,7 D18,10 PBQx-TF,28 and PBQx-TCl29 (Fig. 1a). The one fly in the ointment of these efficient BDTT-based polymers is the verbose synthetic routes and complicated purification processes, which inevitably lead to a high production cost and bring difficulties for the popularization of OSCs.24,25 Second, the polymer donors should exhibit stable batch-to-batch reproducibility, which is an important merit for scale-up synthesis from laboratory to factory. The photovoltaic conjugated polymers are usually synthesized via a Stille cross-coupling reaction, which is a step-growth polymerization mechanism and is uncontrollable in reaction dynamics. Therefore, the polymer molecular weights are difficult to control during the highly reactive polymerization. The fluctuation in molecular weights and molar-mass dispersity (ĐM = Mw/Mn) is the origin of batch-to-batch variability, which brings uncertainties in solution processing, miscibility adjustment of donor/acceptor combination, morphology regulation in blend films, and multiple stability issues of photovoltaic devices,30–34 thus impeding the industrial production of polymer donors with stable device performance. For example, PM6, the highly efficient and most widely used BDTT-based polymer donor, provides high-efficiency OSCs in the number-average molecular weight (Mn) range of 50–70 kDa,30,33 but it can be varied within 30–100 kDa depending on the reaction conditions.33 A large batch-to-batch variation also exists in PM7, which is the chlorinated counterpart of PM6.35 A similar molecular weight effect is found for another highly efficient BDTT-based polymer donor D18 and its chlorinated analog D18-Cl, which work well with Mn around 70 kDa, but perform much poorer with slightly higher or lower molecular weights, resulting in a severe batch-to-batch variation.32,36 To date, only a handful of polymers can provide a stable device performance over a wide range of molecular weights.35,37–39 Third, it would be even better if the polymer had good compatibility with different kinds of acceptors, which would open up the possibility of pairing with the existing and the potentially future efficient acceptors. Photovoltaic polymer donors possessing all of these merits are extremely scarce, although a few polymers partially satisfy the aforementioned requirements.7,8,10,35,36,38,40–43 Among them, PTQ10 (Fig. 1a and Fig. S5, ESI†) is an efficient, low cost, yet universal polymer donor for OSCs,8,16 but the batch-to-batch reproducibility of this polymer has never been reported, casting a cloud over its commercial application.

We thus focus on developing new polymers that meet the above-mentioned requirements through rationale design and exquisite synthesis. Previously, a simple linear conjugated polymer, PTTz-3HD (Fig. 1b), based on thiazolothiazole (TzTz) and terthiophene has been demonstrated, which can afford comparable short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) with state-of-the-art BDTT-based conjugated polymers.44 The major drawback of PTTz-3HD is the shallow highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (−5.36 eV), which resulted in a low open circuit voltage (Voc) in OSCs. Herein, we report a new linear conjugated polymer PTTzF (Fig. 1b) by replacing the thiophene unit in PTTz-3HD with the 3,4-difluorinated thiophene in the polymer backbone. The polymer can be synthesized within ten steps of the reaction from cheap raw chemicals, which is much more easily accessible than the BDTT-based high-performance polymer donors. Owing to the electron-withdrawing effect of backbone fluorination,45 the newly developed polymer PTTzF exhibited a deep-lying HOMO level (−5.64 eV), which is highly important to improve the Voc and reduce energy loss (Eloss) in OSCs. As a result, a remarkable PCE of 18.01% has been achieved by PTTzF, which renders PTTzF one of the few polymers that can afford over 18% efficiency in OSCs. Besides, due to the larger steric hindrance and the higher electronegativity of the fluorine atom compared with the hydrogen atom, the reactivity of the corresponding stannanes is decreased, thereby reducing the possibility of violent reaction during Stille cross-coupling polymerization (Fig. 1c). We have synthesized four batches of PTTzF under different polymerization conditions. Thanks to the mild reactivity of difluorothiophene bis(trimethyltin), all the polymers exhibited similar molecular weights and showed a highly reproducible device performance in OSCs. This characteristic proves that the polymer molecular weight can be well regulated by controlling the reactivity of monomers, which is beneficial to the scale-up synthesis of the polymer with reproducible device performance. Moreover, PTTzF exhibited good universality with a large variety of acceptors including fullerene derivative, A–D–A and A–DA'D–A type non-fullerene acceptors, offering a capability to match with the existing and future high-performance acceptors. The easy synthesis, high efficiency, excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility, and good universality with different acceptors suggest that PTTzF is an ideal polymer donor for the practical application of OSCs, which will take OSCs a critical step forward from laboratory to factory.
Results and discussion
The polymer PTTzF was synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction from the corresponding bis(trimethyltin) and bibrominated monomers. The detailed synthetic route of the polymer is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The polymer PTTzF can be obtained within ten steps of the reaction from inexpensive raw chemicals, which is significantly simpler than BDTT-based conjugated polymers (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†). During the Stille cross-coupling reaction between organostannane and organic electrophile, the Sn–C bond in organostannane undergoes electrophilic cleavage with the Pd2+ complex acting as the electrophile, which is also known as the transmetalation step in the reaction (Fig. S6, ESI†).46,47 Therefore, the electron donating ability of the carbon atom adjacent to the tin atom plays an important role in the reaction. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the larger steric hindrance and higher electronegativity of fluorine atoms compared to hydrogen atoms make the electron donating ability of the α-carbon atom in difluorothiophene bis(trimethyltin) significantly reduced, thereby weakening the reactivity of this organostannane and preventing the molecular weight of PTTzF from violently increasing during polymerization. Based on this rationale, four batches of PTTzF were synthesized under different polymerization conditions (Table S1, ESI†). To obtain a narrow ĐM, we tried a stepwise-heating methodology in Stille cross-coupling polymerization.48 As expected, all the batches of PTTzF exhibited similar molecular weights (Mn = 32 ± 6 kDa) and ĐM values (Fig. S7, ESI†). This Mn corresponds to a polymerization degree of Xn = 36 ± 6, which is close to that of the PM6 batches with good device performance. The controllable polymer molecular weight by rational selection of comonomers is an important merit that is beneficial to the industrial scale-up synthesis of high-performance conjugated polymers. The resulting polymer showed excellent solubility in organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature, which provide convenient solution processability.
The geometric conformation of PTTzF was studied on three repeat units by density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Gaussian at the B3LY/6-31G(d,p) level,49 where the alkyl chains were simplified into methyl groups. As illustrated in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the model trimer exhibits a perfect coplanar conformation, where the dihedral angles between the adjacent units are close to zero degrees. The excellent coplanar conformation results from the F⋯S non-covalent interaction, which would help stabilize the conformation of the conjugated backbone and increase the intermolecular aggregation.50 This preferential coplanar conformation is favorable for electron delocalization, interchain π–π interaction, and charge transport of the polymer.51 The thermal properties of PTTzF were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. PTTzF shows great thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 407 °C at 5% weight loss (Td) (Fig. 2a), sufficiently stable for OSC manufacturing and long-term operation. In addition, PTTzF exhibited obvious melting and crystallization peaks during the heating and cooling process (Fig. 2b), corresponding to a melting temperature (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc) of 320 and 306 °C, respectively. The high Tm and Tc indicate a strong interchain interaction and polymer crystallinity of PTTzF.

The energy levels of PTTzF were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S9, ESI†).52 As shown in Fig. 2c, PTTzF exhibited a HOMO level of −5.64 eV, which is deeper-lying than the most widely studied polymer donor PM6 (−5.53 eV) and will thus favor a higher Voc and a lower Eloss in OSCs. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum showed that PTTzF exhibited a major absorption band in the range of 400–650 nm, which is slightly blue-shifted with respect to PM6 (Fig. 2d). The absorption onset of PTTzF is located at 642 nm, corresponding to a wide optical bandgap of 1.93 eV. The light absorption spectra of PTTzF complements very well with the prevailing narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptor Y6, which offers the capability to fully utilize photons from the visible to near-infrared range to generate a high Jsc under a standard solar spectrum. The temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PTTzF and PM6 in diluted chlorobenzene solutions (0.02 mg mL−1) were further acquired to study the aggregation behaviors of the polymers. The newly developed polymer PTTzF showed similar temperature dependent aggregation characteristics as PM6 (Fig. 2e and f). Both polymers disaggregated in chlorobenzene solution with weak 0–0 absorption peaks at high temperature, and gradually pre-aggregated with the 0–0 absorption peaks being increased and redshifted as the temperature decreased. This brings great convenience for the formation of a favorable morphology that contains a crystalline, sufficient pure phase, yet with a reasonable phase separation during the device fabrication process.13
The photovoltaic performance of PTTzF was evaluated in OSCs with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag. The device performance was fully optimized in terms of solvent additives, annealing conditions, and polymer:Y6 weight ratios (Table S2, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices under AM1.5G irradiation are shown in Fig. 3a, and the numerical device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PTTzF:Y6 binary device exhibited a high PCE of 17.30% with a Voc of 0.855 V, a Jsc of 26.73 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.757. In comparison, the PM6:Y6 binary OSC showed an inferior PCE of 16.24% due to the simultaneously decreased device parameters (Voc = 0.833 V, Jsc = 26.52 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.736). A ternary strategy has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for optimizing device performance.17,53,54 Therefore, we further incorporated a small amount of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyl acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) into the host binary system (Table S3, ESI†). Encouragingly, the PTTzF:Y6:[70]PCBM ternary device showed a more impressive PCE of 18.01% owing to the simultaneously improved Jsc (27.52 mA cm−2) and FF (0.773). The performance of the PM6:Y6:[70]PCBM ternary OSCs has been improved as well (PCE = 17.28%), but is still inferior to that of PTTzF:Y6:[70]PCBM devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the optimal OSCs are displayed in Fig. 3b. All the EQE spectra exhibited a high response in the range from 450 to 850 nm, indicating efficient utilization of the incident photons, which can account for the high Jsc of the OSCs. The values of Jsc integrated from EQEs were comparable to those acquired from J–V measurements with less than 5% deviations. These results render PTTzF one of the very few polymers that can achieve over 18% PCE in OSCs. Considering the easier synthesis, PTTzF is a powerful competitor with BDTT-based polymers.

The exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination behaviors of the OSCs were studied to understand the outstanding photovoltaic performance of PTTzF. As shown by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the neat polymer films exhibited a strong luminescence emission in the range of 600–750 nm with excitation at the wavelength of 530 nm. The PL dramatically decreased after blending with acceptors, indicating efficient charge transfer at the interfaces of the donor and acceptor. Furthermore, we investigated the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) in the devices by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the devices. The charge generation and collection probabilities were calculated using the equation Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jph is the difference of the current density under AM1.5G and in the dark (Jph = JL − JD), and Jsat is the saturation current density of the devices.55 Both the binary and ternary OSCs based on PTTzF and PM6 exhibited Pdiss over 97% (Fig. S11, ESI†). The high Pdiss values suggested that the photo-induced excitons could separate into free charges efficiently at the donor/acceptor interfaces, which are consistent with the high PL quenching efficiencies.
The mobility of the neat polymers and blend films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S12–S14 and Table S4, ESI†). The electron-only devices were fabricated with a device architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag, and the hole-only devices were fabricated with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The polymer PTTzF exhibited a hole mobility (μh) of 3.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of PM6 (1.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hole and electron mobility of the binary and ternary blends based on PTTzF and PM6 are compared in Fig. 3c. The μh and electron mobility (μe) of the PTTzF:Y6 devices were higher and more balanced than the PM6:Y6 devices, which were further enhanced and better balanced with the introduction of [70]PCBM in ternary devices. The fast and balanced charge transport contributed significantly to the higher FF in the PTTzF-based OSCs. The charge carrier recombination was investigated by analyzing the J–V characteristics of the devices under varied light intensity (Plight).56–58 The relationship between Voc and Plight can be described as Voc ∝ −nkT/qln(Plight), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. When n is close to 1, the bimolecular recombination is the major recombination pathway,56 while geminate and trap-assisted recombination come to control when n is close to 2.57,58 As shown in Fig. 3d, the n values were 1.132 and 1.262 for the OSCs of PTTzF:Y6 and PM6:Y6, respectively, which were decreased to 1.086 and 1.205 upon adding [70]PCBM. The lower n values indicated that the trap-assisted recombination was more efficiently suppressed in the PTTzF-based devices, which agreed well with the higher charge carrier mobility and better FF in the devices. The efficient exciton dissociation, fast and balanced charge transport, and low charge carrier recombination synergistically enable an outstanding photovoltaic performance of PTTzF.
In view of the difference in Voc of the OSCs, we carried out high-sensitive EQE and EL measurements to deeply understand the energy loss (ΔEloss) in the OSCs (Fig. S15, ESI†). The total energy loss can be divided into three contributions (ΔEloss = ΔErad,SQ + ΔErad,tail + ΔEnonrad).59,60 ΔErad,SQ is the intrinsic radiative-recombination loss in the Shockley–Queisser limit, the value of which is close in magnitude to the loss caused by solid-angle mismatch between the incident and emitted photons. ΔErad,tail originates from the additional radiative-recombination loss caused by red-shifted absorption of sub-gap states, whose value mainly depends on the slope of exponential absorption tails.61 As to ΔEnonrad, it is the measure of the amount of non-radiative recombination loss and can be calculated by the formula ΔEnonrad = −kBTln(EQEEL), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, EQEEL is the EQE of electroluminescence. The ΔErad,SQ, ΔErad,tail, and ΔEnonrad were calculated according to the established method.62 The results are compared in Fig. 3e and the numerical data are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). The ΔErad,SQ and ΔErad,tail have no obvious difference among the four systems. However, the PTTzF-based devices exhibited higher EQEEL than the PM6-based devices (Fig. 3e). As a result, the ΔEnonrad decreased from 0.24–0.25 eV of the PM6-based devices to 0.22 eV of the PTTzF-based OSCs. Clearly, the decreased ΔEnonrad is the cause of the higher Voc of the PTTzF-based OSCs, which finally contributed to the higher PCEs.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate the molecular packing in the neat polymer and blend films.63,64 The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the one-dimensional (1D) line-cut profiles of the neat polymers are shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The corresponding lattice parameters are listed in Table S6 (ESI†). The PTTzF neat film showed strong (010) diffraction in the out-of-plane (OOP) and weak (010) diffraction in the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting the coexistence of both face-on and edge-on orientation in this polymer.64 The π–π stacking distance of PTTzF is 3.55 Å, which is considerably smaller than that of PM6 (3.68 Å). The crystalline coherence length (CCL) for the OOP (010) diffraction of PTTzF is 28 Å, which is apparently larger than that of PM6 (19 Å). These results are consistent with the excellent coplanar conformation of PTTzF and should account for the higher hole mobility of PTTzF with respect to PM6. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns and 1D-GIWAXS line-cut profiles of the blend films are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. All the blend films showed intense (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction and (100) diffraction peaks in the IP direction, indicating a face-on dominated molecular orientation with respect to the substrate.63,64 The PTTzF:Y6 binary blend exhibited compact π–π stacking with a distance of 3.52 Å and CCL of 29 Å, which were changed to 3.48 and 30 Å for the PTTzF:Y6:[70]PCBM ternary blend. Notably, PTTzF led to more compact and more ordered π–π stacking than PM6 in both binary and ternary blends (Table S6, ESI†). In the IP direction, the more obvious peaks at q = 0.22 Å−1 and 0.43 Å−1 in PTTzF-based blends originated from Y6 (Fig. S16, ESI†), which indicates a higher phase purity and is beneficial to the charge carrier transport in blend films. Consistently, the CCLs of the (100) diffractions of the PTTzF-based films were always longer than that of PM6, indicating a more ordered lamellar stacking as well. The favorable face-on orientation, and compact and ordered molecular packing are beneficial to charge transport in the vertical direction, which is consistent with the charge carrier mobility obtained in single carrier devices.

The bulk and surface morphology of the active layer were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. All the blend films showed fibrillary network structures and bi-continuous phase-separated morphology, but the PTTzF-based blend films exhibited a slightly smaller phase separation than the PM6-based counterpart blend films (Fig. 4c). Consistently, the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the PTTzF:Y6 blend (1.49 nm) was smaller than the PM6:Y6 blend (2.34 nm) (Fig. 4d). A similar difference in RMS roughness can also be found between the PTTzF:Y6:[70]PCBM and PM6:Y6:[70]PCBM ternary blends. Meanwhile, the aggregated domains with a smaller size of PTTzF-based blend films can be observed in the AFM phase images (Fig. S17, ESI†), which is consistent with the surface roughness. The favorable phase separation, fibrillary bi-continuous interpenetrating networks, and smooth surface morphology ensured efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport,65 which are consistent with the high Jsc and FF of the OSCs based on PTTzF.
As mentioned before, the molecular weights of PTTzF were precisely controlled at 32 ± 6 kDa through the rational selection of comonomers, which should have small batch-to-batch variation theoretically. Therefore, the photovoltaic performance of the four batches of PTTzF were evaluated in both binary and ternary OSCs. The J–V characteristics and EQE curves of the binary OSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and b, and the detailed device parameters are listed in Table 2. Encouragingly, all the polymer batches afforded excellent performance with the PCE in a very narrow range of 17.00–17.30% for the binary devices and 17.47–18.01% for the ternary devices (Fig. S18 and Table S7, ESI†) along with comparable Voc, Jsc, and FF. These results suggest that the polymer PTTzF possesses excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility in device performance. To the best of our knowledge, PTTzF is the only polymer donor that exhibits over 18% efficiency and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility simultaneously reported to date. Such a merit is highly desired for industrial scale-up synthesis and large-scale module manufacturing of OSCs. These results also suggest that the rational selection of a comonomer is an effective strategy to control polymerization dynamics and polymer molecular weights.

In view of the suitable energy levels, good light absorption property, and strong pre-aggregation characteristic in a solution of PTTzF, we chose a few different acceptors including fullerene ([70]PCBM), A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptor (IT-4F), and A–DA'D–A type non-fullerene acceptors (Y6-BO, eC9, L8-BO) to study the universality of this polymer. The J–V characteristics and EQE curves of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 5c and d. The detailed device parameters are listed in Table 3. Encouragingly, the OSCs based on PTTzF and the prevailing A–DA'D–A type non-fullerene acceptors (Y6-BO, eC9, L8-BO) all afforded PCEs surpassing 16% associated with EQE > 80% and FF > 0.7, suggesting the good morphological miscibility between PTTzF and these acceptors. Moreover, the polymer can offer 7.09% and 13.36% efficiency when blended with [70]PCBM and IT-4F, respectively, which are comparable with high-performance BDTT-based wide bandgap polymers. These results imply that PTTzF is a universal polymer donor for a large variety of acceptors, which provide a capability to match with the existing and potential high-performance acceptors in the future.

Eco-compatible processing with non-halogenated solvents is also an important prerequisite for the industrialization of OSCs. Considering the solubility in non-halogenated solvents, we chose Y6-BO as the acceptor to explore the potential of PTTzF for non-halogenated solvent processing.66 Encouragingly, the PTTzF:Y6-BO device processed from toluene achieved a decent PCE of 16.51% with a Voc of 0.843 V, a Jsc of 26.63 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.735 (Fig. S19, ESI†), which is fully comparable to that of chloroform-processed devices (Fig. 5c and Table 3). Moreover, the aggregation behavior of the polymer in non-halogenated solvents can be conveniently modulated by adjusting the alkyl chains, thus offering a more favorable active layer morphology with a bi-continuous penetrating network. Therefore, PTTzF has a promising prospect to fabricate high-efficiency OSCs via eco-compatible processing.
Conclusions
A polymer donor abbreviated as PTTzF with a linear donor–acceptor alternating structure toward practical application of OSCs is reported. The polymer exhibiting an outstanding photovoltaic performance with a remarkable PCE = 17.30% in a binary device and a PCE = 18.01% in a ternary device is being achieved. These results render PTTzF one of the very few polymers that can achieve over 18% PCE in OSCs. Importantly, the synthesis of PTTzF is much easier than the prevailing high-performance polymer donors, which is beneficial to reducing the production cost of photovoltaic materials. Moreover, the polymerization of PTTzF is very controllable with appropriate polymer molecular weights within a narrow range of 32 ± 6 kDa being obtained via rational selection of the comonomer with moderate reactivity. As a result, the polymer exhibited outstanding batch-to-batch reproducibility in device performance, which is a favorable characteristic for the scale-up synthesis from laboratory to factory. Besides, PTTzF showed good universality with different kinds of electron acceptors in fabricating high-efficiency OSCs, providing a capability to match with the current and future high-performance acceptors. These merits collectively make PTTzF a promising polymer donor for the large-scale manufacturing of OSC modules. Moreover, this work represents the real renaissance of structurally simple linear donor–acceptor alternating conjugated polymers, which will further contribute to the real-world application of OSCs in the near future.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising next generation photovoltaic technology due to their light weight, solution processability, and their prospect in fabricating large-scale flexible devices. However, the commercialization of OSCs is limited by the challenges in reproducible fabrication of high-efficiency devices from photoactive materials with low synthetic complexity and good up-scalability. In this work, we report a structurally simple linear conjugated polymer PTTzF, which can be synthesized easily from cheap raw chemicals and offered an impressive power conversion efficiency of 18.01% in OSCs. Besides, this polymer showed a highly reproducible photovoltaic performance due to well-controlled molecular weights through rational selection of a comonomer with appropriate reactivity. Moreover, the polymer exhibited good universality with different acceptors, which offers a capability to match with the currently existing and future potential high-performance acceptors. The merits of low synthetic complexity, high efficiency, excellent reproducibility, and good universality make PTTzF a promising candidate for large-scale manufacturing and practical application of OSCs.
