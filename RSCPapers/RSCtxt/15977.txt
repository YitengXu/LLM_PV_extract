1. Introduction
In the last several decades, with the rapid development of industrialization and the expansion in the human population, global energy issues and environmental pollution have increased.1,2 The need for a drastic reduction in the use of non-renewable fossil fuels and increasingly more serious environmental pollution problems have led to the expansion of research activities concerning new clean energy sources and efficient energy conversion and storage techniques. Unfortunately, at present the utilization of renewable forms of energy, including solar, tide, wind, geothermal, hydrothermal and bioenergy, is still quite limited.
Thermal energy storage (TES) techniques and systems can be used to effectively reduce the mismatch between energy supply and demand via sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical reactions, which in turn relieves energy shortages and environmental issues.3 Among various forms of thermal energy storage, latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs), which store and release latent heat reversibly with small variations in temperature during the melting and solidification processes, has received much attention and has been proved to be one of the most promising techniques for storing thermal energy originating from the surrounding environment, solar irradiation, industrial waste heat and surplus heat.4–6 PCMs exhibit tremendous potential for applications in the thermal management of electronics/batteries,7–10 energy conservation in buildings,11,12 smart textiles and clothing systems,13,14 waste heat recovery systems,15 air-conditioning systems,16 heating and domestic hot water systems,17 off-peak electricity storage systems,18 solar energy systems,5 and so on.19
According to the mode of the phase transition, PCMs can be classified into solid–solid, solid–liquid, solid–gas and liquid–gas systems. Although solid–gas and liquid–gas PCMs exhibit a very high latent heat of phase transition, their applications are restricted in TES systems owing to the large volume change during the phase transition.20,21 Solid–solid PCMs, which store heat via the phase transition from one crystalline form to another similar form, have received attention owing to their advantages of no generation of liquid or gas, no leakage above the phase transition temperature, no encapsulation and small volume changes.22–24 However, solid–liquid PCMs generally exhibit a higher heat of phase transition in comparison with solid–solid PCMs. Owing to their high energy storage densities and excellent latent heat storage capacities, TES associated with solid–liquid PCMs has attracted a great deal of interest.
Solid–liquid PCMs can be broadly divided into organic and inorganic PCMs.25 Inorganic PCMs, which mainly comprise salt hydrates,26 eutectic mixtures27,28 and metal alloys,29 possess the advantages of high storage densities, high thermal conductivities and low costs. However, inorganic PCMs suffer from fatal shortcomings such as supercooling and phase separation. Organic PCMs include a wide range of materials, such as paraffin wax (PW, or n-alkanes),30,31 fatty acids,32,33 alcohols34,35 and glycols such as polyethylene glycol (PEG),36,37 which exhibit high energy storage densities, wide ranges of melting temperatures for convenient use, non-toxicity, isothermal characteristics, no phase separation, a low or negligible degree of supercooling, desirable thermal or chemical stability for long-term use, and abundant natural resources.18,38–41 Consequently, organic solid–liquid PCMs have been extensively studied for fabricating high-performance and multifunctional composite PCMs for promising applications in advanced thermal management and energy-related systems. However, although PCMs exhibit great potential for improving the utilization efficiency of energy, practical applications of organic PCMs have been hindered by leakage of the melt during the phase transition, an inherently low thermal conductivity of about 0.2 W m−1 K−1, low electrical conductivity for electricity–heat conversion and weak photoabsorption ability for solar energy conversion.42–45
The leakage of liquid and low thermal conductivity may lead to potential dangers and slow thermal charging/discharging rates, respectively, during operation.46–49 Many efforts have been made to solve these issues by incorporating 3D functional architectures to fabricate composite PCMs with enhanced properties. Form-stable or shape-stabilized composite PCMs are composed of the working substance and supporting materials. As well as interfacial adhesion and hydrogen bonding interactions, 3D functional architectures, as preferred supporting materials, provide an additional capillary force due to the porous network structure.
Originally, thermally conductive fillers were directly introduced into the matrix by solution or melt blending to fabricate thermally conductive composite PCMs, but the increase in thermal conductivity was limited. In other words, large amounts of fillers have to be added to increase the thermal conductivity, especially in the case of non-carbon fillers, which in turn reduces the energy storage density. To balance the enhanced performance and intrinsic energy density and make full use of the properties of functional fillers, the introduction of 3D structural materials into organic PCMs is becoming the focus of research. To make further progress, interconnected 3D skeletons with well-ordered structures have been developed. 3D structural materials have evolved into quite competitive candidates for the fabrication of form-stable composite PCMs with high thermal conductivity.
It is of significant importance to achieve energy conversion and storage with PCMs, which will promote the development of sustainable energy infrastructures. For example, electricity-to-heat conversion exhibits great potential in the utilization of off-peak electricity storage systems and in the application of power systems such as portable electronics and hybrid vehicles.45 On the other hand, solar energy, as the most abundant, renewable and environment-friendly energy resource, is most likely to be an alternative to conventional fossil fuels.50 However, it is also a serious challenge to make use of intermittent and discontinuous solar radiation energy. Solar energy conversion using novel photodriven composite PCMs is an effective solution to the problem of discontinuity and imbalances in time and space.51 However, the low electrical conductivity and weak photoabsorption ability of pristine PCMs restrict their applications in direct energy conversion. One prospective way of achieving electrical and solar energy conversion comprises the introduction of carbonaceous materials owing to their high conductivity and excellent photoabsorption. It has been proved that a small amount of carbon materials can effectively form a conductive percolation network and improve the photoabsorption of composite PCMs.
Although a number of studies of high-performance composite PCMs have been performed recently and the relevant progress has been well summarized,2,25,52–59 a systematic review of the use of composite PCMs based on macroscopically 3D structural materials for energy conversion has not been presented. Here, by focusing on recent advances in the construction of 3D functional materials to improve the comprehensive performance of organic PCMs, we highlight their architectural design and processing–structure–property relationships. We first discuss the influence of 3D network structures on improvements in shape stability. After that, we summarize the progress in thermally conductive composite PCMs and the routes of efficient energy conversion. In closing, we present the perspectives and challenges in the development of high-performance composite PCMs in the future.
2. 3D structural materials
In recent years, 3D structural materials have attracted a great deal of interest in the fabrication of high-performance and multifunctional composites related to a range of fields,60 including electrically conductive materials,61–65 thermally conductive materials,66–73 thermally insulating materials,74–77 flame retardant materials,74,78 electromagnetic shielding and microwave-absorbing materials,79–86 dielectric materials,87,88 absorbers,89–94 biomedical materials,95,96 shape memory materials,97,98 sensors,99–102 catalysts,103 photothermal materials for solar steam generation,104–107 and energy materials.108–116 In PCMs, 3D structural materials are employed as supporting materials and thermally conductive networks to greatly improve their shape stability during the phase transition and thermal conductivity, respectively. In this review, we focus on the preparation of high-performance composite PCMs with the aid of 3D structural materials, such as metallic foams,117 cellulose-based aerogels,118 carbon foams (sponges),119 carbon nanotube (CNT) sponges,39 graphene aerogels (foams),120–123 and porous scaffolds.124–126 It has been proved that 3D structural materials can be effectively constructed via emulsion foaming,127,128 biomass carbonization,45,119 self-assembly (the “sol-cryo” method,60 hydrothermal processes,129–131 and chemical reduction44,132,133) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)134–136 techniques, as shown in Fig. 1.

3. Shape-stabilized PCMs
To the best of our knowledge, methods for assessing the shape stability of PCMs have not yet been unified. A dynamic rheometer and a thermomechanical analyzer are usually utilized to perform a shape stabilization test by determining the dimensional stability of materials quantitatively. In brief, the size or dimension of a gap is adjusted sensitively and automatically when compressed by a constant normal force as the temperature is increased. The change in the size or dimension of the gap is smaller, which indicates that the shape stability of a PCM is better.121,138–141 In addition to monitoring changes in the size of a gap using rheological measurements, the difference in the storage modulus (G′) between the neat matrix and composite samples has been used to determine the shape stabilization effect via a dynamic temperature ramp test.120 In most qualitative studies performed by means of a leakage test, the samples were placed directly on a hot stage and then heated to different temperatures while monitored by tracking photography using a digital camera.45,121,142–148 It is more reasonable to record changes in weight before and after a leakage test in combination with photography.119,139 In addition, Shi et al.149 measured the dropping point of PCMs to determine the shape stabilization effect.
To maintain the shape of materials and prevent leakage throughout the phase change process, shape-stabilized PCMs composed of the working substance and supporting materials were developed in the late 1990s.150 The microencapsulation of PCMs is one of the most popular techniques for improving the shape stability of PCMs. Typically, a core–shell structure is constructed to prepare microencapsulated PCMs, in which the core and the shell are the PCM and the supporting material, respectively. Polymers such as polystyrene,151 poly(methyl methacrylate)152 and melamine–formaldehyde153 have been employed as the shell owing to their light weight, strength and flexibility. However, the widespread application of polymer shell materials is restricted by their weak thermal response and flammability. Inorganic shells with high thermal conductivity can also be used, and silica has been the most widely investigated inorganic shell material owing to its high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion coefficient. Unfortunately, the inorganic shells exhibit brittleness and poor compatibility.154 On the other hand, effective supporting materials, such as diatomite,155–157 porous wood flour,158,159 expanded vermiculite,160,161 expanded perlite,162–164 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),165,166 and carbon materials (activated carbon,48,167 expanded graphite (EG),146,148 GO,138,168,169 and biomass-derived carbon170,171), have been directly introduced into organic PCMs to improve their shape stability, whereas aggregation, sedimentation and the large amount of supporting materials have to be taken into account during processing. The macroscopic assembly and construction of 3D ordered structural materials has been significantly developed in recent years, especially in the case of carbon-based materials. Obviously, the strong interfacial adhesion of low-dimensional nanomaterials, the network structure (capillary force) of 3D structural materials and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between PCMs with oxygen-containing functional groups and cellulose or GO are able to endow PCMs with enhanced shape stability, as shown in Fig. 2.118,121,129,130,172

3.1. Cellulose-based aerogels
Cellulose, which is an almost inexhaustible and sustainable biopolymer resource, has been considered as a next-generation material to meet the increasing demand for environmentally friendly, biocompatible and functional products owing to its fascinating biocompatibility, biodegradability and stability.173 In a study by Senturk et al.,174 cellulose was used as the supporting material to fabricate PEG-based composite PCMs with enhanced shape stability owing to the hydrogen bonding interactions between PEG and cellulose, as revealed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. In the FT-IR spectra, the characteristic peaks corresponding to O–H or C–O groups in the composite PCMs shifted to lower wavenumbers (i.e., a red shift) in comparison with those of the control sample, which indicated that there were hydrogen bonding interactions.169,175 Since several attempts to fabricate cellulose-based aerogels with high porosity and large surface areas have been undertaken,176–179 in particular, using a typical solvent for cellulose (aqueous solutions of an alkali hydroxide and urea used at low temperatures), as presented by Cai et al. in 2008,180 cellulose-based functional aerogels have spread significantly in the last decade, and PCMs are no exception.79,91,95,181–184
Yang et al.118 reported that lightweight cellulose/GNP aerogels and the corresponding composite PCMs were fabricated by combining a cellulose solvent composed of alkali hydroxide-urea and vacuum-assisted impregnation methods, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The cellulose/GNP aerogels could effectively encapsulate PEG and prevent leakage of the PEG melt owing to their strong 3D networks and hydrogen bonding interactions between PEG and cellulose, as shown in Fig. 2b. The shape stability of neat PEG and the composite PCMs was characterized via TMA and digital photos. The results demonstrated that solid PEG was liquidized and could not maintain its shape when heated to the melting point of PEG, whereas composite PCMs embedded in cellulose/GNP aerogels changed little and maintained a stable shape, even when compressed by a weight of 500 g (50 kPa).

3.2. Bio-carbon aerogels (foams)
Owing to their superior properties, such as renewability, earth-abundant sources, excellent electrical or thermal conductivity and stability, biomass-derived carbon aerogels (foams) have been widely studied for use in different advanced technologies, including energy storage systems,112,185 electromagnetic shielding materials,186 and absorbers.93 Lightweight carbonaceous materials can be directly produced from melons, potatoes, sugarcane stalks, bread, and so on via a well-established carbonization process.45,187,188 Some biomass-derived materials have been introduced into PCMs to fabricate shape-stabilized composite PCMs.45,119,137,189,190 Li et al.45 prepared carbon aerogels from various types of melon (winter melon, watermelon and pumpkin) via a hydrothermal carbonization and post-pyrolysis process, followed by the introduction of PW into the carbon aerogels using vacuum infusion, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. When heated to 100 °C (above the melting temperature of PW), PW melted completely to form a liquid, whereas no leakage of liquid from the composites occurred except that a small portion of PW on the surface of the composite PCMs melted, even after 20 melting and freezing cycles. This was because PW was collectively absorbed in the microscale pores of the carbon aerogels, and leakage was prevented by the existence of a capillary effect.

A melon aerogel (4) and a carbon aerogel (5) were obtained by freeze-drying and pyrolysis, respectively, followed by impregnation with wax to form a composite PCM (6).45 (b) Fresh leaves of Adromischus cooperi (1) were freeze-dried and then pyrolyzed so that an SCA (2) was formed. The SCA was infused with melted paraffin (3) and was further cooled to room temperature so that a composite PCM was formed (4).137 Reproduced from ref. 45 and 137 with the permission of the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Similarly, Zhao et al.119 investigated the form stability of composite PCMs composed of PEG and biological porous carbon obtained via a carbonization method using potatoes and white radishes as raw materials in an oven at 80 °C for 40 h. In macroscopic photographs of the composite PCMs, no leakage of liquid was observed. The results showed that weight losses of only 6.3% and 8.5% were observed in porous carbon from potatoes and white radishes, respectively. Wei et al.137 used succulents with a water content of up to 98% to fabricate biomass carbon scaffolds and the corresponding leakage-proof PCMs, as sketched in Fig. 4b. According to the idea that if PCMs replace the water in the leaves of succulents, the resulting composite PCMs can exhibit a high energy storage density owing to the high loading of the working substance. As expected, the encapsulation efficiency of the succulent-based carbon aerogel (SCA) reached 95 wt%. A leakage test revealed that little leakage of liquid occurred from SCA/paraffin composite PCMs after being heated at 80 °C for 5 h, and the mass loss from composite PCMs with the maximum loading (95 wt%) was only 5.0 wt%. The pronounced leakage-proof property can be ascribed to the strong capillary force of the pores with their closed-cell structure and the protective layers originating from the tightly arranged palisade cells and dense epidermal cells.
3.3. Graphene aerogels (foams)
There is no doubt that graphene has moved into the spotlight in the field of materials science since the successful exfoliation of monolayer graphene in 2004 and the development of nanotechnology.191 Two-dimensional (2D) graphene, as a monolayer crystal of carbon atoms in the form of a hexagonal lattice, exhibits highly attractive properties such as an extremely large specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1), excellent mechanical properties, and high thermal and electrical conductivity.192 Therefore, graphene and its derivatives are promising candidates for applications including polymer-based composites,193–196 energy storage materials,197–200 macroscopic functional products,201–205 and many more. It is noteworthy that 3D graphene aerogels can effectively accommodate PCMs, which is mainly attributed to their favorable porous structure and ultralight weight. As a solid material, the density of an aerogel can be as low as 0.16 mg cm−3, i.e., much less than the density of regular air, which has a density of 1.2 mg cm−3, and thus it exhibits great superiority in maintaining the energy storage density of PCMs.60
GO nanosheets with large amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups, as supporting materials, are promising for the fabrication of shape-stabilized organic PCMs such as PEG because of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between GO and PEG via C–O and O–H groups, as shown in Fig. 2c.138,169,175,206 Tang et al.122 synthesized a series of GOs with various oxygen-containing functional groups and chemical structures by adjusting the dosage of the oxidant.207 GO aerogels with 3D interconnected porous frameworks were directly prepared by freeze-drying a GO suspension. After that, PEG was incorporated into the GO aerogels that were obtained and assembled from GO with different degrees of oxidation. The authors found that the shape stability of the composite PCMs improved as the degree of oxidation increased, and a balance was reached with a further increase in the level of oxidation, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. After the reduction of GO, the reduced GO (rGO) nanosheets with a restored conjugated structure self-assembled into a graphene foam via hydrophobic and π–π interactions, as illustrated in Fig. 6a.132 The graphene foam was used as a supporting skeleton to accommodate wax. Fig. 6b and c reveal that the wax fully occupied the pores of the graphene foam owing to the strong affinity between the hydrocarbon chains of the wax and the rGO nanosheets. A leakage test, as shown in Fig. 6d and e, was conducted to confirm the shape stability of graphene foam–wax composite PCMs. Furthermore, Yang et al.208 confirmed that a high-quality graphene aerogel obtained by means of high-temperature annealing at 2800 °C was also a candidate as the supporting material for 1-octadecanol. Ye et al.120 fabricated a graphene aerogel with a core–shell-like structure by encapsulating paraffin via a modified hydrothermal method, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. In contrast to the fabrication of composite PCMs by conventional vacuum impregnation, paraffin was encapsulated in hollow graphene shells during the formation of 3D graphene aerogels that were reduced and self-assembled from GO. The encapsulation ratio of paraffin in the final composite PCMs reached 97%. Interestingly, the samples produced by the modified hydrothermal method exhibited a greater ability to prevent leakage of the paraffin melt in comparison with control samples prepared by the hydrothermal method and an impregnation process, as shown in Fig. 5e. This superior shape effect originated from the construction of core–shell-like structures, the restricted space available for the volume expansion of paraffin particles and the capillary effect of micrometer-scale pores in the graphene aerogels. Later, Liang et al.33 reported that graphene/GO complex aerogels prepared by combining a reduction reaction and a freeze-drying technique were introduced into lauric acid via vacuum-assisted impregnation to fabricate shape-stable composite PCMs. A comparative investigation of the shape stability of pure lauric acid, lauric acid/GO aerogel composite PCMs and lauric acid/graphene complex aerogels composite PCMs was performed, and the results indicated that the pure PCMs gradually melted to form a liquid as the temperature was increased, whereas two specimens of the composite PCMs exhibited superb shape stability, with only a very small amount of molten lauric acid on their bottom, during the whole heating process. A closer inspection of digital images revealed that the lauric acid/graphene complex aerogels composite PCMs exhibited greater shape stability than the lauric acid/GO aerogel composite PCMs owing to a much stronger interlocking effect.

Yang et al.121 prepared hybrid graphene aerogels that comprised GO and GNP and embedded them into a PEG melt in a vacuum drying oven at 90 °C. TMA results demonstrated that the enhancement in shape stability was remarkable when the GNP loading in the hybrid graphene aerogels was increased, which could be explained by the fact that a denser 3D supporting network was formed. In this line of interest, Yang et al.130 prepared high-density graphene hybrid aerogels by the self-assembly of rGO and GNP, followed by an air-drying process. The integrated 3D network constructed from rGO shrank during the air-drying process, whereas GNP played the role of a reinforcing agent in avoiding excessive volume shrinkage. Note that the mechanical strength of the hybrid aerogels increased as the rGO loading increased, which was ascribed to the denser rGO network that originated from π–π stacking of rGO sheets and volume shrinkage during the hydrothermal reduction and air-drying processes, respectively. Hence, it was easy to impregnate 1-octadecanol into the porous hybrid graphene network to manufacture composite PCMs. The authors revealed that the rGO/GNP porous network encapsulated a 1-octadecanol melt well, as shown by TMA tests (Fig. 5c), and the final composite PCMs maintained their original shape without any obvious leakage when compressed by a weight of 1 kg at ca. 70 °C because of the strong 3D skeleton of the graphene hybrid aerogels (Fig. 5d).
The pores of graphene foams obtained by template-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are large, with sizes of up to a few hundred micrometers, and open, which is detrimental to improvements in shape stability. Therefore, improved CVD techniques have been developed to optimize the 3D network structures of graphene foams by constructing hierarchical structures and hybridizing graphene aerogels with graphene foams.123,136 A modified CVD method assisted by a nickel foam template was used to produce a hierarchical graphene foam and a graphene foam/graphene aerogel hybrid microstructure. The synthesis strategies used for the hierarchical graphene foam shown in Fig. 8a and the graphene foam/graphene aerogel hybrid microstructure shown in Fig. 8b were based on the pretreatment of a nickel foam template by filling it with nickel powder and hybridizing a graphene aerogel with the nickel foam, respectively, followed by CVD growth and chemical etching of the nickel template. Then, the as-prepared hierarchical graphene foam and graphene foam/graphene aerogel hybrid architectures were immersed in molten PW in a vacuum oven at 80 °C to obtain composite PCMs. As expected, the final composite PCMs with the hierarchical graphene foam and graphene foam/graphene aerogel hybrid microstructure exhibited greater shape stability in comparison with composite PCMs with a graphene foam directly obtained by a CVD method assisted by an unmodified nickel foam template.

One prominent feature of the above shape-stabilized composite PCMs based on graphene aerogels is that they exhibit relatively high energy storage densities (phase change enthalpies) because only a small amount of the working substance is replaced by the 3D graphene-based supporting materials.
3.4. Other porous scaffolds
As well as the above three kinds of aerogels or foams, 3D spongy attapulgite was also used as a host material to absorb n-carboxylic acids by a vacuum impregnation method.172 The average pore diameter of spongy attapulgite assembled from purified attapulgite micropowder was 13.3 nm, which resulted in strong capillary forces in the 3D supporting network. The high heat storage capacity of the composite PCMs was also maintained. Li et al.127,128 successively fabricated and introduced porous titanium oxide (TiO2) foams and porous aluminum oxide (Al2O3)@graphite foams into paraffin to obtain high-performance composite PCMs, and the maximum encapsulation ratio of reserved paraffin in the composite PCMs, without any leakage, reached 80 vol% and 66 wt%, respectively.
4. Thermally conductive PCMs
As well as poor shape stability, low thermal conductivity is also an urgent problem for organic PCMs. The thermal conductivities and thermophysical properties of representative neat organic PCMs are listed in Table 1. An increase in thermal conductivity can accelerate thermal charging/discharging rates and thereby improve the efficiency of thermal energy storage devices and systems.209 In combination with a 3D supporting network, two approaches for increasing thermal conductivity have been developed. One comprises the direct construction of thermally conductive pathways, and the other comprises the introduction of thermally conductive pathways into the 3D supporting network to form hybrid network structures.

To increase the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs, thermally conductive materials of various types, which mainly comprise metallic materials (copper210,211 or silver160,212,213), ceramic materials (BN,49,214,215 Al2O3,216,217 aluminum nitride (AlN),218,219 Si3N4,4 TiO2,220,221 or Ti4O7222) and carbon materials (CNTs,209,223,224 carbon fibers (CFs),225 EG,148,226–228 graphite or graphene nanoplatelets,140,229,230 graphene,43,231 or GO232), are introduced into the neat PCMs. The thermal conductivities of materials frequently used for increasing the thermal conductivity of PCMs are shown in Table 2. In particular, one-dimensional (1D) CNTs and 2D graphene exhibit extremely high thermal conductivities, which originate from the strong covalent sp2 bonds between carbon atoms that favor phonon transport through the lattice plane, of up to ca. 2000–6000 and ca. 5300 W m−1 K−1, respectively.

The thermal conductivity of composites has universally been measured using the hot disk and laser flash techniques. Note that increasing numbers of researchers have used an infrared thermal imager to record the temperature distribution of samples when heated or cooled at a constant temperature, which also reflects the thermal response rate during heating and cooling. Generally speaking, the dispersion of thermally conductive fillers is random in a solution or melt blending method, which results in a disordered conductive network in the composites. In contrast, 3D structural materials can endow the composites with ordered conductive networks. It is not difficult to understand that the models of thermally conductive pathways can be roughly classified into three types, namely, honeycomb-like networks, hierarchical networks and aligned networks, as shown in Fig. 9. Table 3 shows the thermal conductivities of representative composite PCMs with various 3D structural materials, and more details will be discussed later in this review.

4.1. Metallic materials
Metallic materials exhibit excellent thermal conductivity, and specific values of their thermal conductivity are listed in Table 2. 3D metal foams have been widely studied and used for heat sinks and heat exchangers because of their attractive advantages, including excellent mechanical properties, ultralow relative densities with highly open porosity, and particularly high thermal conductivity due to their continuous skeleton structure.7,117,251 Consequently, porous metal foams (copper foam, nickel foam and aluminum foam) have been used to fabricate composite PCMs with high thermal conductivity.54,248,252–254 For example, Xiao et al.248 prepared paraffin/nickel foam and paraffin/copper foam composite PCMs by a vacuum impregnation method, and metal foams with different pore sizes were used (Fig. 10). It was demonstrated that the thermal conductivities of the paraffin/nickel foam and paraffin/copper foam composite PCMs dramatically increased and reached nearly 1.2 and 4.9 W m−1 K−1, i.e., about 3 times and 15 times higher, respectively, than that of neat paraffin, namely, 0.31 W m−1 K−1. The thermal conductivities of composite PCMs comprising copper foams with a pore size of 25 PPI (pores per inch) were 5.04 W m−1 K−1, 11.33 W m−1 K−1, and 16.01 W m−1 K−1 for foams with porosities of 96.95%, 92.31%, and 88.89%, respectively, and the thermal conductivities of composite PCMs comprising nickel foams with a pore size of 25 PPI were 1.24 W m−1 K−1, 1.70 W m−1 K−1, and 2.33 W m−1 K−1 for foams with porosities of 97.45%, 94.24%, and 90.61%, respectively.117 The reason for the large difference between the thermal conductivities of these two composites is that copper has a higher intrinsic thermal conductivity than nickel, as listed in Table 2. The thermal conductivity of paraffin was greatly increased owing to the addition of thermally conductive aluminum foam, which was experimentally investigated by Wang et al.254

4.2. Carbon materials
Owing to their low thermal expansivity, high temperature resistance, and high electronic and thermal conductivities, carbon materials are considered to be ideal and attractive candidates for the preparation of high-performance composites.67,255 Considering their excellent thermal properties, low-dimensional carbon materials have been assembled into 3D macroscopic and lightweight structural materials, including carbon foams, CNT aerogels, and graphite/graphene foams (aerogels), to increase the thermal conductivity of composites, thermal interface materials and PCMs.
Xiao et al.249 reported that the thermal conductivity of paraffin-based composite PCMs increased after the incorporation of a carbon foam and was about three times higher than that of the pure matrix. Apart from ready-made products that are purchased directly, carbon foams or aerogels generally originate from the carbonization of biomass. Some research has been devoted to low-cost and sustainable 3D carbon-based materials that can act as thermally conductive frameworks. Fang et al.256 employed a chitosan-derived carbon aerogel as the supporting material to fabricate form-stable PCMs. Interestingly, the carbon aerogel exhibited a typical layer structure, and the interlayer spacing was in the range of 50–200 μm. It is worth noting that the content of high-purity graphitic carbon in the aerogel was increased and amorphous carbon was removed to increase the thermal conductivity of the 3D carbon framework. Owing to the anisotropy of the as-prepared carbon aerogel, there was a significant difference in thermal conductivity between the parallel and perpendicular directions. In comparison with that of pure 1-hexadecanol, the thermal conductivities of composite PCMs with a loading of nearly 2 wt% carbon aerogel increased by 107.9% and 29.5%, respectively, in the parallel and perpendicular directions.
Karthik et al.235 pioneered the fabrication of graphitized carbon foam using polymeric precursors and polyurethane foam as the carbon source and sacrificial template, respectively (Fig. 11a). The SEM images in Fig. 11b and c show that the macroporous interconnected 3D graphitized carbon foam exhibited an open-cell reticulated porous architecture. During the carbonization process, it was found that amorphous carbon was converted into well-defined graphitic carbon, which resulted in an increased thermal conductivity of 3.77 W m−1 K−1 in the case of composite PCMs with a relatively high impregnation ratio (75 wt%), which was about 424% higher than that of neat erythritol (0.72 W m−1 K−1). Zhao et al.119 synthesized biological porous carbon with a honeycomb-like microstructure by carbonizing potatoes and white radishes (Fig. 11d–f). Then, composite PCMs were fabricated by infiltrating PEG into the biological porous carbon, and a high thermal conductivity of up to 4.5 W m−1 K−1 at a loading of 14.6 wt% was achieved. Yang et al. reported novel carbonized wood-based composite PCMs with a thermal conductivity of 0.669 W m−1 K−1 in the axial direction.257 Wood slices were carbonized at 500 °C and sintered at 1000 °C to obtain carbonized wood with unique anisotropic porous structures, as shown in Fig. 11g–j. The small pits on the inner surfaces of the lumens contributed to thermal transport in the open channels. The unique anisotropic porous structures endowed the composite PCMs with different thermal conductivities in the radial and axial directions. Owing to the greater importance of phonon conduction for radial heat transport, the thermal conductivity in the radial direction was lower than that in the axial direction.

The assembly of CNTs into an aerogel creates a new ultralight 3D bulk material that integrates the intriguing properties of CNTs and aerogels and enables an extensive range of potential applications.258 A sponge-like CNT skeleton was employed to make electrically conductive PW-based composite PCMs with increased thermal conductivity.39 The thermal conductivity of composite PCMs with a PW loading of 80 wt% was about 1.2 W m−1 K−1, which represented a nearly sixfold increase in comparison with that of pure PW. It is noteworthy that the thermal conductivity decreased slightly after the solid-to-liquid phase transition to reach ∼1 W m−1 K−1. Zhang et al.259 introduced a CNT array (CNTA) into RT100 to prepare composite PCMs with anisotropic thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivities of RT100/CNTA in the xy- and z-directions were 4.17 and 12.3 W m−1 K−1, respectively, which can be explained by the fact that the axial thermal conductivity of CNTs is much higher than their radial thermal conductivity. It was remarkable that the thermal conductivity of the as-prepared composite in the z-direction was 51 times higher than that of neat RT100 (0.24 W m−1 K−1). In addition, Su et al.260 constructed GO/CNT hybrid carbon foams to prepare form-stabilized composite PCMs with increased thermal conductivity, in which GO and the CNTs acted as the supporting framework and thermally conductive bridges, respectively. They found that PEG/multiwalled CNT composite PCMs exhibited higher thermal conductivity (1.54 W m−1 K−1) than PEG/single-walled CNT composite PCMs (1.16 W m−1 K−1) at the same volume ratio of GO to CNTs.
The 3D interconnected framework of graphene can be used not only as a supporting material to improve the shape stability of composite PCMs but also as a thermally conductive network to increase their thermal conductivity. In comparison with conventional melt processing and solution blending, 3D graphene products can provide interconnected thermal transfer pathways inside the composites and reduce the interfacial thermal resistance. The self-assembly of 2D graphene nanosheets and CVD are typical approaches for producing 3D graphene-based structural materials. Vitamin C and ethylenediamine were employed as reducing agents to prepare two kinds of graphene aerogels, which were denoted as VGA and EGA, respectively.236 The graphene aerogels obtained by chemical reduction were introduced into tetradecanol, which is a type of fatty alcohol, to prepare form-stable composite PCMs. Although the thermal conductivity of EGA (1.823 W m−1 K−1) was lower than that of VGA (3.031 W m−1 K−1), the final tetradecanol/EGA composite PCMs exhibited a thermal conductivity (1.092 W m−1 K−1) that was slightly higher than that of the tetradecanol/VGA composite PCMs (1.031 W m−1 K−1) at the same loading of 10 wt% because the degree of vibrational coupling between the carbon atoms of EGA, which contained more functional groups (–OH, –CO, and –NH), and tetradecanol increased, which resulted in a reduction in interfacial phonon scattering and a decrease in the interfacial thermal resistance. The assembly of graphene sheets into a 3D graphene aerogel with low density and chemical inertness was achieved by Zhong et al.129via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. After that, composite PCMs were fabricated by infiltrating octadecanoic acid into a graphene aerogel under the action of capillary forces (Fig. 12a). A high thermal conductivity of ∼2.635 W m−1 K−1 was achieved for the resulting composites with a loading of ∼20 vol%, which was about 14 times higher than that of the pure matrix (0.184 W m−1 K−1). Similarly, Li et al.131 synthesized spongy graphene via a hydrothermal reduction reaction to manufacture docosane/graphene composites with increased thermal conductivity. Notably, the presence of spongy graphene, which acted as a nucleating agent, contributed to an enhancement in the crystallinity of docosane, which resulted in a simultaneous increase in latent heat.

In general, composite PCMs based on 3D structural materials are prepared by low-cost and time-effective vacuum impregnation. However, Xia et al.234 found that an inhomogeneous distribution of the pristine PCMs in porous materials might arise if this method was used. Therefore, they developed a combined method based on solution and vacuum impregnation to fabricate a series of novel n-octadecane/graphene aerogel composite PCMs with a homogeneous distribution of the matrix, as depicted in detail in Fig. 12b. The results demonstrated that the 3D graphene aerogel endowed the composite PCMs with increased thermal conductivity (1.636 W m−1 K−1versus 0.1505 W m−1 K−1) at a loading of 25 wt%.
Graphene aerogels are creatively synthesized via chemical reduction and hydrothermal reduction reactions using GO as a precursor, whereas the thermal conductivity of GO is significantly reduced with an increase in oxygen coverage.261 Considering the above fact, the aerogel products have to be heat-treated or annealed at an extremely high temperature to efficiently remove residual oxygen-containing groups from GO and eliminate structural defects.262 For example, Yang et al.208 utilized highly processable GO pastes as precursors to prepare a high-quality graphene aerogel by freeze-drying. The GO aerogel was processed into different shapes and complicated architectures by a moulding method and by hand, which indicated that the processability of the GO pastes was remarkable and their viscosity was high. After high-temperature annealing at 2800 °C, the quality of the rGO sheets was greatly improved according to their Raman spectra (Fig. 13a). Raman spectroscopy is widely used to elucidate the structures of carbon materials, including diamond, CNT, graphite and graphene. The D band at ∼1350 cm−1 and the G band at ∼1570 cm−1 originate from the A1g breathing mode and first-order scattering of the E2g mode, respectively. The D band is ascribed to the conversion from sp2 to sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms, which provides evidence of the presence of defects in the graphite material such as vacancies and edge defects. The 2D band at ∼2700 cm−1 and the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) are crucial parameters for assessing the stacking order of graphite along the c-axis and the quality of graphene.207,263 Hence, the final composite PCMs with a loading of only ∼5 wt% of nearly defect-free graphene exhibited a superior thermal conductivity of ∼4.28 W m−1 K−1 in comparison with that of neat 1-octadecanol (0.23 W m−1 K−1). For a close comparison, composite PCMs with graphene sheets annealed at 1300 °C exhibited a limited thermal conductivity of ∼1.29 W m−1 K−1 at a loading of 5 wt%. Although large amounts of oxygen-containing groups on GO sheets can be removed when they are heat-treated at 1300 °C, defects, which act as phonon-scattering centers, are still present, which severely limits thermal conduction in graphene sheets. Furthermore, high-quality anisotropic graphene aerogels were prepared by directional freezing of polyamic acid salt/GO slurries, followed by imidization at 300 °C and graphitization at 2800 °C.264 After the introduction of the anisotropic graphene aerogels into PW, the resulting composite PCMs exhibited high transverse and longitudinal thermal conductivities of up to 2.68 and 8.87 W m−1 K−1, respectively. Exceptionally, the latent heat retention of the composite PCMs reached 98.7%.

To avoid an additional thermal annealing process and save cost, Yang et al.121 employed a facile way to construct hybrid graphene aerogels using GO as the supporting material and GNP as a thermally conductive filler. In brief, a mixed solution of GO/GNP was prepared via ultrasonic bath treatment and magnetic stirring. The hybrid aerogels were directly prepared by vacuum freeze-drying from the aqueous solution rather than from hydrogels. GO nanosheets formed a 3D skeleton, and GNP was dispersed uniformly along the skeleton to form a thermally conductive pathway. The incorporation of hybrid graphene aerogels remarkably enhanced the comprehensive performance of PEG-based composite PCMs with only ∼0.45 wt% GO and ∼1.8 wt% GNP, which exhibited a high thermal conductivity of 1.43 W m−1 K−1. Yang et al.130 subsequently fabricated high-density rGO/GNP hybrid graphene aerogels after air-drying rGO/GNP hydrogels under ambient conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 12c. The thermal conductivity of composite PCMs with a loading of 12 wt% was exceptionally increased to 5.92 W m−1 K−1 from 0.23 W m−1 K−1, which was mainly attributed to the preformed 3D conductive network. Consequently, composite PCMs composed of a neat rGO aerogel and 1-octadecanol exhibited a relatively low thermal conductivity of ∼0.39 W m−1 K−1.
Obviously, the weak physical crosslinks in a graphene aerogel/foam obtained via a self-assembly strategy are mainly formed by π–π stacking interactions, which leads to a pronounced contact thermal resistance at junctions between nanosheets. Fortunately, CVD has been proved to fabricate an ultrathin diamond or graphite foam monolith, which can provide continuous pathways for phonon transport. A chromium-modified copper foam was used as the template for CVD to grow a high-quality 3D diamond foam.233 The thermal conductivity of the final paraffin/diamond foam composite PCMs with a latent heat of 124.7 J g−1 was greatly increased in comparison with those of pure paraffin (0.25 W m−1 K−1), diamond particles/paraffin (0.45 W m−1 K−1) and copper foam/paraffin (2.56 W m−1 K−1) and reached 6.70 W m−1 K−1, which was ascribed to the highly conductive pathways for heat transfer in the continuous diamond network structure. As well as diamond foam, it has been reported that metals (copper, nickel, and so on),265 alloys266 and inorganic materials267,268 can be used as substrates to grow graphene.269,270 Huang et al.268 prepared a 3D macroscopically robust graphene network using interconnected porous SiO2 as a substrate. The thermal conductivity of composite PCMs increased to 0.44 W m−1 K−1 after the introduction of a PCM with a thermal conductivity of 0.15 W m−1 K−1. The increase in thermal conductivity was limited because there were some defects in graphene grown on the silica substrate on the basis of the appearance of a relatively strong D peak in the corresponding Raman spectrum (Fig. 13b).207 Ji et al.134 used nickel foam as a template to grow high-quality graphite foam (Fig. 13c). The thermal conductivity of composite PCMs with a low loading of 3.6 wt% reached 3.61 W m−1 K−1. The graphite foam copied and inherited the structure of the metal template and exhibited an interconnected 3D macroporous structure with a pore size of hundreds of micrometers. Hence, there was a high thermal resistance to heat transfer from the PCMs in the large pores.
To reduce the thermal resistance of the PCMs in the large pores, Kholmanov et al.135 and Qi et al.123 grew long CNT networks and dense interconnected hollow graphene networks, respectively, directly on struts of graphene foam into the pore space to further increase the thermal conductivity, as intuitively illustrated in Fig. 9b. The thermal conductivity of the final composite PCMs increased by a factor of as much as 1.8 from 2.9 W m−1 K−1 to 4.1 W m−1 K−1 after the growth of 0.8 wt% long CNT networks into the pores of a 3D graphite framework with a loading of 1.8 wt% via a water-assisted catalytic CVD method (Fig. 12d). Interestingly, the composite PCMs exhibited a greatly reduced degree of subcooling owing to the increase in heterogeneous nucleation sites provided by the increased surface curvature and point defect density after the growth of long CNTs on the struts of graphene foam. A hierarchical graphene foam was constructed by growing hollow graphene networks into the pores of a graphene foam to increase the thermal conductivity to 2.28 W m−1 K−1 from 1.22 W m−1 K−1. In addition, the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 13d clarify whether there were defects on the surface of graphene. The results demonstrate that hierarchical graphene consisting of graphene foam grown from nickel foam and hollow graphene networks grown from nickel powder was overall of high quality.
It is worth mentioning that the thermal conductivity and shape stability discussed above can be significantly improved simultaneously by constructing a denser network on the basis of an interconnected 3D graphene foam obtained via a CVD technique. Besides constructing a 3D hierarchical graphene foam structure, the authors136 developed another way to form a denser network structure. Composite PCMs with enhanced comprehensive performance were produced by hybridizing a graphene aerogel with a graphene foam, which provided a new insight into the rapid development of high-performance composite PCMs via the integration of multiple structures and various techniques.
4.3. Inorganic ceramic materials
In comparison with metallic and carbon materials, inorganic ceramic materials, such as BN and Al2O3, mainly possess electrical insulation properties, which make them suitable for the fabrication of thermally conductive composite PCMs that require electrical insulation. BN, as a typical 2D layered material, possesses a graphite-like structure that comprises six-membered rings consisting of alternating B and N atoms in equal amounts and exhibits anisotropic thermal conductivity (600 and 30 W m−1 K−1 in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively).242,271 Owing to the significant anisotropies in geometry and thermal conductivity, the orientation of BN plays a significant role in increasing the thermal conductivity of BN-filled composites. Notably, it is more troublesome to exfoliate and functionalize BN than graphite because the B–N bonds are partially ionic, which arises from the higher electronegativity of N atoms.272 Therefore, the manufacture of a macroscopically 3D network structure from pristine BN without the assistance of accessory materials is much more difficult than from graphene. It has been proved that polyvinyl alcohol,69 sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO3),71 sodium carboxymethylcellulose,66 cellulose181 and graphene73 can be employed as binders or supporting materials to form frameworks based on a 3D BN network architecture.
Yang et al.125 adopted a strategy based on ice-templated assembly to construct hybrid porous scaffolds comprising GO and BN (Fig. 14a). The freezing compartment of a domestic refrigerator and liquid nitrogen were used to regulate the grain size of ice inside the scaffolds (Fig. 14b and c). Two different scaffolds with honeycomb-like porous microstructures were obtained by changing the freezing temperature. It was found that scaffolds prepared at a higher freezing temperature possessed well-ordered microstructures and thermally conductive pathways owing to the self-assembly of BN driven by ice-templated growth (Fig. 14d and e). Consequently, the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs reached 1.84 W m−1 K−1 at a BN loading of less than 20 wt%. To make full use of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of BN, a vertically aligned 3D BN structure was developed by a unidirectional ice templating strategy, as illustrated in Fig. 15a.124,126 During the ice-templated growth process, BN microplatelets were repelled by oriented ice fingers to form interconnected 3D porous scaffolds. The thermal conductivity of paraffin-based composite PCMs with a loading of 26 wt% increased to 1.33 W m−1 K−1 from 0.12 W m−1 K−1 when Na2SiO3 was used as a binder. The thermal conductivity of PEG-based composite PCMs with a loading of 23 wt% increased to 2.36 W m−1 K−1 from 0.33 W m−1 K−1 when GO was employed as a supporting material. The increase in thermal conductivity can be ascribed to the aligned 3D BN scaffolds, which provided continuous conductive pathways for phonon transport.

Furthermore, an optimized 3D BN scaffold with an aligned network structure was rationally designed by Yang et al.250 A series of GO/BN hybrid porous scaffolds with various microstructures were fabricated along a freezing temperature gradient (i.e., −120, −80, −50 and −30 °C), as illustrated in Fig. 15b. Various thermally conductive pathways (Fig. 15c) were constructed as the freezing temperature was increased from −120 to −30 °C. The thermal conductivities of the porous scaffolds and the resulting composite PCMs increased and reached a maximum value at −50 °C, and composite PCMs with a relatively low BN loading of ∼28.7 wt% exhibited a thermal conductivity of 3.18 W m−1 K−1. Unexpectedly, the thermal conductivity decreased when the freezing temperature was increased from −50 to −30 °C because the growth of large ice crystals at the higher freezing temperature resulted in the destruction of a well-formed network structure and high thermal resistance from the interlayer matrix. Although the thermal conductivities of composites have been greatly increased by a unidirectional ice templating strategy, the degree of orientation of BN is limited and remains to be further improved. In addition, great efforts have been dedicated to manufacturing a pure BN aerogel,273–276 which will promote the development and application of 3D-BN-filled composites.
As well as BN, TiO2 and Al2O3 have been used as thermal conductivity promoters to form 3D porous foams. Li et al.127 synthesized porous TiO2 foams (PTF) via a particle-stabilized emulsion method (Fig. 16a). In comparison with pristine paraffin, the thermal conductivity of prepared paraffin/PTF composites with a loading of 25 wt% increased to 0.302 W m−1 K−1 from 0.21 W m−1 K−1. Considering the limited increase in thermal conductivity, a coating of a carbon layer with a thickness of 2 nm on the surface of TiO2 particles was successfully created to further increase the thermal conductivity of composites. A significant increase in thermal conductivity, which reached 1.059 W m−1 K−1, was achieved owing to the high thermal conductivity of carbon materials. Similarly, the authors prepared porous Al2O3@graphite foams (PAGFs) by a particle-stabilized foaming method, and the process of preparation is shown in Fig. 16b.128 The thermal conductivity of paraffin/PAGF composite PCMs reached a maximum of 0.76 W m−1 K−1. Zhou et al.277 proposed a hybrid architecture of graphene-coated porous Al2O3 ceramics (G-Al2O3) prepared via a CVD method. G-Al2O3 with an interconnected macroporous graphene framework exhibited an extremely low electrical resistance of as little as 0.11 Ω sq−1 and a high thermal conductivity of up to 8.28 W m−1 K−1 in comparison with that of porous Al2O3 (1.84 W m−1 K−1). After the introduction of stearic acid into G-Al2O3, composite PCMs with a latent heat of 130 J g−1 exhibited a faster thermal response than uncoated composites, according to temperature distribution images. On the basis of these studies, the method of incorporating carbon materials into low-priced traditional ceramic fillers is feasible for further increasing the thermal conductivity of composites.

5. Energy conversion
Energy materials, devices and systems have attracted substantial attention with the development of the economy, the growth in population, the depletion of fossil fuels and the deterioration of the environment. Energy storage materials play a significant role in reducing the mismatch between the supply of energy and the demand for energy and achieving sustainable development. The conversion, storage and utilization of energy using PCMs have become the focus of attention in the past few years, especially solar energy (a lasting, renewable and carbon-neutral energy source) and surplus heat or heat from industrial waste. Energy conversion using PCMs can be achieved by electrical-to-thermal,39,44,45,278,279 light-to-thermal,280–283 magnetism-to-thermal,284,285 heat-to-electrical286,287 and light-to-electrical49,132,288 routes.
It is universally acknowledged that organic PCMs are excellent insulators and exhibit poor photoabsorption. It is impossible to directly convert electrical or light energy into heat using the pristine PCMs. In general, conductive fillers or structures have been used to increase their electrical conductivity.39,45 Carbon materials,142,148,206,289,290 dyes,291,292 polydopamine,293 and Ti4O7222,294 have been introduced into PCMs to improve their photoabsorption. It has been proved that composite PCMs based on 3D structural materials can achieve electrical-to-thermal, light-to-thermal, heat-to-electrical and light-to-electrical energy conversion, as shown in Fig. 17.
 Fig. 17  Energy conversion using composite PCMs based on 3D structural materials. 
5.1. Electricity-to-heat conversion
Chen et al.39 reported multifunctional composite PCMs in which energy conversion can be driven by low voltages (e.g., 1.5 V). The electricity-to-heat storage efficiency reached ca. 40.6% and 52.5% at voltages of 1.5 V and 1.75 V, respectively, owing to a highly conductive CNT sponge (Fig. 18a). The energy conversion efficiency (η) was calculated from the ratio of stored heat in the PCMs with respect to the electrical energy applied during the heating process and was defined as η = mΔH/UIt, where m is the mass of the sample, ΔH is the phase change enthalpy of the sample determined by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), U and I are the applied voltage and current, respectively, and t represents time.

(g) Evolution curves for electrical current passing through an empty CNTA and a CNTA-C20 composite PCM at a voltage of 1 V.

Furthermore, Liu et al.278 from the same group employed CVD and melt impregnation methods to fabricate hybrid composites of an aligned CNTA with a highly conductive network and n-eicosane (C20), as illustrated in Fig. 18b. In particular, the density of the CNTA was tailored by uniaxial compression in the lateral direction at predefined strains of 0, 20% and 40%, and the resulting composite PCMs were denoted as CNTA-C20, CNTA-C20-c20% and CNTA-C20-c40%, as shown in Fig. 18c–e, respectively. From temperature evolution curves (Fig. 18h–k) recorded after electricity-to-heat conversion (Fig. 18f and g) under applied voltages of 1.0–2.0 V, they found that an increase in the density of CNTs could significantly reduce the voltage required for triggering the phase transition because of the decrease in bulk resistance and the improvement in heat transfer in composite PCMs with densified nanotubes. The maximum value of the electricity-to-heat energy conversion efficiency of CNTA-C20-c40% composites reached 74.7% at 1.3 V.
Li et al.45 infiltrated wax into a highly electrically conductive carbon aerogel to obtain electrically driven composite PCMs. With an electrical conductivity of 3.4 S m−1, the composite PCMs could be triggered by a low electrical potential (15 V with a current of 1.2 A) with an estimated electricity-to-heat conversion and storage efficiency of 71.4%.
Li et al.44 proposed a novel strategy for synthesizing a high-performance anisotropic graphene aerogel that originated from ordered GO liquid crystals via a combination of vapor diffusion and a sol–gel method, followed by supercritical-fluid drying and annealing at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere in sequence, as illustrated in Fig. 19a. Fig. 19b shows the fabrication process of a composite PCM, which can be driven either electrically or optically to perform energy storage and release by filling the graphene aerogel with the molten PCM. The electricity-to-heat conversion efficiency of the resulting composite PCMs reached 85% when a low voltage (1–3 V) was applied.

5.2. Light-to-heat conversion
Not only can electrical energy be converted into heat, as in the examples listed above; light energy can also be utilized. A CNT sponge, a carbon aerogel and a graphene aerogel were used to absorb solar radiation and convert it into thermal energy, and the heat was stored in composite PCMs. A GO aerogel derived from GO with various degrees of oxidation, hybrid graphene aerogels consisting of GO and GNP and a hierarchical graphene foam obtained by CVD were developed to fabricate versatile PEG- or PW-based composite PCMs with improved photoabsorption.121–123,136 The graphene-based 3D structural materials contributed to the achievement of light-to-thermal energy conversion by pristine PCMs. The experimental setup and the phase change process involved in light-to-heat conversion and storage are illustrated in Fig. 20. It is advisable that the intensity of simulated solar illumination should be controlled and verified using filters and an optical power meter before a test is conducted. During light irradiation, the temperature of the composite PCMs abruptly increased and then a plateau in the temperature evolution curves appeared, which indicated that a solid–liquid phase change process and storage of thermal energy in the form of latent heat had taken place. Upon the removal of the light source, the temperature of the composite PCMs fell immediately until another plateau appeared, and the stored heat was released to maintain the temperature in the solidification process.
 Fig. 20  Schematic illustration of experimental setups for (a) light-to-heat conversion and (b) light-to-heat conversion and storage.121 Reproduced from ref. 121 with the permission of Elsevier. 
Taking into account the fact that the samples were directly exposed to their surroundings without insulation and the real energy conversion efficiency can thus be affected, an energy conversion process in an insulated environment has been developed by Wei et al.137 A light-to-thermal energy conversion test on composite PCMs was performed in a vacuum oven at a low pressure (ca. 20 Pa). Using a photothermal calculation method, the energy conversion efficiency of composite PCMs with a biomass carbon aerogel was calculated to be about 73% according to the equation η = mΔH/ρSΔt,142 where ρ is the light irradiation intensity, S is the surface area, and Δt is the phase change time, in an insulated environment. Although light-to-heat conversion associated with PCMs has made great progress, the rational design of advanced energy conversion devices and systems for practical applications remains in its infancy.
5.3. Heat-to-electricity energy conversion
As another energy-harvesting system, a major breakthrough in heat-to-electricity energy conversion systems has been achieved by combining high-performance PCMs and n/p-type semiconductors. Jiang et al.286 proposed a proof-of-concept design with the assistance of a commercial thermoelectric device to generate electricity. According to the principle of the Seebeck effect, this energy-harvesting system can convert stored heat from PCMs into electricity once a temperature difference comes into being between the hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric generator. Yu et al.287 designed a thermoelectric energy-harvesting system composed of shape-stabilized PCMs with embedded rGO/GNP aerogels and an n/p-type semiconductor, as shown in Fig. 21. Note that two phase change materials (i.e., PEG and 1-tetradecanol) with different phase change temperatures were chosen as hot and cold sources to control the temperature gradient (ΔT), which was also the method adopted by Zhang et al.288 The maximum power obtained during the heating and cooling processes was so low that an LED lamp was not lit. After the integration of a voltage start-up converter into the device, the LED lamp was successfully turned on by the output electrical energy. On the basis of the experimental results and numerical predictions, the heating and cooling energy conversion efficiencies were calculated to be 52.81% and 30.29%, respectively.

5.4. Light-to-electricity energy conversion
Although light-to-thermal and heat-to-electrical energy conversion routes have been described in several publications, reports about one-step light-to-heat-to-electrical energy conversion are relatively rare. That is to say, making full use of heat energy from solar irradiation remains challenging. To achieve light-to-electricity energy conversion, a prerequisite is that the composite PCMs should exhibit excellent photoabsorption for light-to-thermal energy conversion and serve as a heat source. In addition, a commercial Seebeck thermoelectric generator is used for the stage of heat-to-electricity energy conversion, and a cold source should be provided to establish a certain temperature difference.
Yang et al.125,126,250 introduced GO/BN porous scaffolds constructed by an ice templating strategy into PEG and successfully performed light-to-electricity energy conversion using the final composite PCMs (Fig. 22a–c). The results demonstrated that the shapes of the curves of current (I) versus time for both the pure matrix and the corresponding composite PCMs were in accordance with the curves of temperature versus time for the light-to-thermal energy conversion process. A steady-state plateau in the value of I appeared before and after the incident light was turned off owing to the storage and release of energy during the melting and solidification processes, respectively. Zhang et al.132 reported 3D graphene foam-based composites for the seamless combination of solar heat conversion and thermal energy storage for sustained energy release. The composite PCMs effectively collected solar energy and converted it into heat, and then the stored thermal energy in the PCMs was released in the form of electricity with the assistance of a commercial thermoelectric device for sustained utilization. Interestingly, the generated electricity was used to power an electric fan in the absence of light, which provided a buffer effect against the influence of temporary blockages of incident light and reduced power fluctuations, as shown in Fig. 22d–h. Therefore, the route of light-to-electricity energy conversion based on photodriven PCMs promotes the development of promising applications in advanced energy-related devices and systems for the utilization and storage of solar energy.

6. Conclusions and perspectives
Recent progress in this decade has led to the development of 3D structural materials for fabricating organic solid–liquid composite PCMs with the aim of promoting the development of high-performance composite PCMs as potential candidates for energy conversion and storage. In particular, as-prepared 3D structural materials, such as carbon foams, graphene aerogels, and porous scaffolds, can simultaneously endow the final composite PCMs with enhanced shape stability and thermal conductivity. 3D structural materials greatly improve the shape stability of composite PCMs, which is mainly ascribed to the strong interfacial adhesion, hydrogen bonding interactions and capillary forces between the porous materials and the matrix. Thermally conductive pathways constructed from functional fillers by various modes of assembly, as well as their spatial arrangement, pore configuration, mode of bonding, degree of orientation, and synergistic effects, play a significant role in reducing the systematic thermal resistance and increasing the thermal conductivity of composites. In addition, this review provides an insight into efficient energy conversion using organic PCMs via light-to-thermal, electrical-to-thermal, heat-to-electrical and light-to-electrical routes.
In our opinion, several critical issues and challenges worthy of further investigation are as follows. (i) Although the qualitative relationship between 3D network structures and thermal conductivity has gradually been established, a quantitative theory is still lacking. How a 3D network structure determines the thermal conductivity needs to be further clarified. Existing studies indicate that the thermal conductivities of graphene aerogel and GO/BN porous scaffolds are 2.18 and 0.21 W m−1 K−1, respectively, whereas the thermal conductivities of the corresponding composite PCMs are 2.64 and 1.84 W m−1 K−1.125,129 The thermal conductivities of porous carbons derived from different biomass sources are 0.29 and 0.49 W m−1 K−1, whereas the thermal conductivities of the corresponding composite PCMs are 4.49 and 1.75 W m−1 K−1.119 It is urgently necessary to establish the quantitative relationship between the thermal conductivities of the 3D framework and final composite for various systems. (ii) In many cases, the energy storage density of pristine PCMs is more or less sacrificed to improve their properties. It is difficult to reach a balance between high energy storage density, zero leakage, superior thermal conductivity and efficient energy conversion. That is to say, the intrinsic properties of functional materials have not been fully exploited. For example, when ceramic materials are employed as thermally conductive fillers, it is essential to add a relatively high loading or an additional carbon material. In particular in the case of BN, which is a 2D material with great potential for the fabrication of thermally conductive composites, it is desirable to prepare high-quality and defect-free BN nanosheets with large lateral sizes and pure 3D BN architectures. (iii) The interfacial thermal resistance inside the 3D structural materials, as well as between the framework and the matrix, still exists, and the degree of orientation of anisotropic materials remains limited. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to optimize the interfaces and aligned structures. It is highly advisable to develop a novel strategy that combines a method of orientation and a mode of assembly. (iv) On the basis of existing results that the pore size seriously affects the thermal conductivity and shape stability of the final composite PCMs, the pore size and structure should be further optimized. The construction of 3D architectures with relatively small pore sizes to significantly increase their thermal conductivity would be a good way to fabricate composite PCMs with enhanced comprehensive performance. (v) Currently, the equations η = mΔH/UIt and η = mΔH/ρSΔt are used to calculate the electrical-to-thermal and light-to-thermal energy conversion efficiencies, respectively. However, the vast majority of experimental setups used for energy conversion are directly exposed to their surroundings without insulation, which results in the loss of heat from the energy conversion system. It is better to perform energy conversion tests in insulated surroundings to avoid the loss of converted heat. More importantly, methods for calculating the magnetism-to-thermal and light-to-electrical (or heat-to-electrical) energy conversion efficiency have not been proposed thus far. It is desirable that an effective system for the evaluation of energy conversion should be established in further work. (vi) The development of multifunctional and smart composite PCMs is still in the mainstream,295 and more efforts will be made to exploit combined or innovative manufacturing techniques and expand the field of application of PCMs.
