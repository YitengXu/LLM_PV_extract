    , Accepted 23rd June 2014First published on 24th June 2014AbstractOne-dimensional quantum confined nanorod heterostructures (such as CdSe/CdS and ZnSe/CdS dot-in-rod) have been intensively investigated as light harvesting and charge separation materials for solar energy conversation because of the possibilities of rational incorporation of catalysts and achieving long distance charge separation though the selection of component materials with desired band alignment and dimension (diameter and length). To establish design principles for these materials, we have examined the redox mediator (methyl viologen, MV2+) photoreduction process using ZnSe/CdS type II dot-in-rod nanorods. We show that the steady state MV2+ photoreduction quantum yields, in the presence of mercaptopropionic acid as electron donor, were 34% at 550 nm and 90% at 415 nm, respectively. Using transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence decay, we followed the rates of electron and hole localization within the rod, interfacial transfer to acceptors, and charge recombination processes. It was shown that 550 nm excitation generated excitons in the charge transfer state with holes in the ZnSe seed and electrons at the CdS bulb region surrounding the seed. Electron transfer to MV2+ formed a charge separated state with relatively small electron–hole spatial separation, leading to a larger charge recombination loss and a smaller steady-state quantum yield of MV2+ photoreduction. The excitons generated in the CdS rod region by 415 nm excitation underwent three charge separation pathways. The majority pathway led to long-distance charge separation with the electrons in the reduced MV2+ adsorbed on the rod and holes localized in the ZnSe seed, which suppressed recombination and resulted in the observed higher steady state quantum yield. We discuss possible approaches to control the branching ratios of different exciton localization/dissociation pathways and to improve the quantum efficiency of photoreduction.
Introduction
The advancement of solar-to-fuel conversion technologies requires not only efficient catalysts but also novel materials and approaches for light harvesting and charge separation. In recent years, quantum confined semiconductor nanocrystals have received intense interest as light harvesting and charge separation components in photocatalytic systems because of their tunable chemical, optical and electronic properties.1 Compared with conventional single composition quantum dots (QDs), semiconductor nanoheterostructures, which combine two or more materials in one nanoscale system, provide additional opportunities for controlling their functionalities.1a,1c,2 The electron and hole distributions and dynamics in heterostructures, which dictate their charge separation and photocatalytic properties, can be controlled by the conduction and valence band offsets of constituent materials as well as their geometries and dimensions. Among many reported morphologies, anisotropic one-dimensional nanorod (NR) heterostructures, e.g. ZnSe/CdS, CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods (DIRs), are particularly intriguing because of their potential for long-distance charge separation and efficient photocatalysis.1b,1i,3 For example, in a recent study, we reported a near unity quantum yield (QY) for redox mediator (MV2+/MV+˙) generation and efficient H2 evolution with CdSe/CdS nanorods at 455 nm excitation, significantly higher than other nanostructures including CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, CdSe quantum dots and CdS nanorods.1b
Due to the band offset between ZnSe and CdS, it is expected that in type II ZnSe/CdS dot-in-rod NRs, the lowest energy valence band (VB) hole is localized in the ZnSe seed and the lowest energy conduction band (CB) electron is located in the CdS rod.4 Such spatial separation of CB electrons and VB holes, a key attribute of these type II and related quasi-type II CdSe/CdS NRs, is thought to lengthen the lifetime of charge separation.1b,1i,3a,3b,3d,5 However, recent experimental and theoretical studies of CdSe/CdS quasi-type II NRs suggest that the electron wavefunction is largely localized near the hole (confined in the seed) due to strong e–h Coulomb interaction in these 1D structures.4a,6 Furthermore, the strong 1D exciton binding energy and presence of surface hole traps in CdS leads to multiple spatially separated long-lived exciton species in CdSe/CdS nanorods and the branching ratio among these species depends on the excitation wavelength.6d,6e It is anticipated that such complex carrier distribution and excitation wavelength dependent exciton dynamics are likely a common feature of many dot-in-rod nanorods such as CdSe/CdS and ZnSe/CdS. Therefore, it is important to investigate its effect on the charge separation properties and photocatalytic performance of these nanorods.1b,1i,3
Herein, we investigated the excitation wavelength dependent performance and mechanism of MV2+ photo-reduction using type II ZnSe/CdS nanorods. This reaction was chosen because MV2+/MV+˙ is a well known redox couple (−0.45 vs. NHE in aqueous solution) that can be further coupled with H2 evolution1b,7 or CO2 reduction8 catalysts for direct solar-to-fuel conversion. ZnSe/CdS, with a clear type II band offset between ZnSe and CdS, is chosen as a model for type II dot-in-rod NRs, offering an interesting comparison with the more extensively studied quasi-type II CdSe/CdS nanorods.4 We report for the first time that under steady state illumination conditions and in the presence of an electron donor (mercaptopropionic acid, 0.814 vs. NHE1e), ZnSe/CdS nanorods showed dramatic wavelength dependent MV2+ photoreduction QY (∼90% at 415 nm and ∼34% at 550 nm). Using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay, we measured the rate of the elementary steps, including exciton localization and trapping, interfacial electron and hole transfers, as well as the competing recombination processes, involved in the overall photoreduction process. We discuss how charge transfer pathways and their rates are influenced by the excitation wavelength dependent spatial distributions of electrons and holes and how they affect the observed steady state MV2+ photoreduction QYs.
Results and discussion
Static absorption and emission spectra
ZnSe/CdS dot-in-rod NRs were synthesized by a seeded-growth approach starting with a ZnSe seed of ∼2.9 nm in diameter (see ESI S1†).4b,9Fig. 1a shows a representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the ZnSe/CdS NRs used in this study. According to the TEM image, the ZnSe/CdS NRs had an average length of 20.3 ± 2.5 nm and non-uniform diameters along the rod: a thinner rod (diameter ∼3.7 nm) with a significantly thicker part (“bulb”) near one end (diameter ∼5.8 nm). This bulb feature has been observed in many seeded-grown ZnSe/CdS4b,4c and CdSe/CdS nanorods,6d,10 and has been attributed to the growth of a CdS shell surrounding the ZnSe or CdSe seed during the growth of the CdS rod.4a,4b,10

(b) UV-Vis absorption (black solid line) and emission (blue solid line) spectra of ZnSe/CdS NRs in toluene solution. The y-axis is in the unit of (left) absorptance (the ratio of absorbed to incident light) for the absorption spectrum and (right) intensity for the emission spectrum. Inset: comparison of absorptance spectrum (black line) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum (red dashed line). These spectra have been scaled to the same intensity at 550 nm. 
The static UV-Vis absorption (in the unit of absorptance – the ratio of absorbed to incident photons) and emission spectra of ZnSe/CdS nanorod dispersed in toluene are displayed in Fig. 1b. The ZnSe/CdS nanorod shows a lowest energy exciton absorption peak at 550 nm with emission centered at 575 nm. The amplitude of the Stokes shift (∼60 meV) is similar to reported values of other ZnSe/CdS nanorods,4b although the origin of the shift remains unclear. This exciton band is well below the bandgap of either ZnSe or CdS and can be assigned to the lowest energy charge transfer (CT) transition from the lowest energy hole level (1Sh) in the ZnSe seed to lowest energy electron level in the CdS in this type II nanoheterostructure.4d,11 Here, we have assumed, for convenience, that the confinement potentials for electrons and holes in ZnSe seed and CdS bulb region still have spherical symmetry and the lowest energy electron and hole levels can be labelled as 1Se, and 1Sh, respectively. It will be shown below that the electron level involved in the lowest energy CT band, depicted as B3 in Fig. 1a inset, is the 1Se level in the surrounding CdS bulb. The absorption spectrum also shows a clear exciton peak at ∼457 nm, which can be attributed to quantum confined 1Σ excitonic transition in the CdS rod (B1 in Fig. 1a inset).6d,12 In addition to these two pronounced excitonic transitions, there is also an absorption feature at ∼480 nm, which can be clearly observed from the transient absorption spectra (see below). This transition has a lower energy (shifted by ∼130 meV) than the 1Σ peak in CdS rod region and can be assigned to the lowest energy transition in the CdS shell within the bulb region (B2 in Fig. 1a inset). A similar bulb feature is observed in CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod NRs.6d,10 This indicates a smaller confinement energy in the bulb region, compared to the CdS rod, which is likely caused by its larger size and a much smaller confinement potential at the ZnSe/CdS interface (∼0.7 V) than the CdS/solvent interface (∼3.7 V). Its strength is small in the static absorption spectrum because of its relatively small volume compared to the CdS rod. From the TA spectra measured with direct excitation of the B3 transition at 555 nm (see below), the B2 bleach feature shows the same instantaneous formation and long-lived decay kinetics as the B3 bleach, indicating that these two transitions share the same electron level, i.e. the 1Se level in the CdS shell in bulb region. From the B1 and B2 transition energy difference and electron–hole effective masses in CdS bulk material, we estimate that the lowest energy electron level in CdS rod is ∼100 meV higher than that in the CdS bulb. Therefore, instead of extending throughout the whole rod, the lowest energy conduction band electron level for the ZnSe/CdS nanorod localizes in the CdS bulb region surrounding the ZnSe seed. Based on conduction/valence band edges of bulk ZnSe and CdS materials1a (black dashed lines in Fig. 1a inset) and the energies of B1, B2 and B3 transitions, the lowest energy electron and hole levels throughout the nanorod can be deduced, which are shown in Fig. 1a. We have neglected the electron–hole Columbic binding energy in this estimate.
The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum (detected at the emission maximum at 575 nm) of ZnSe/CdS nanorods is also shown and compared with the absorptance spectrum in Fig. 1b inset. NR absorption at wavelengths shorter than B2 is dominated by CdS rod because of its much larger volume and dielectric confinement effect.13 If all excitons generated in the CdS rod can relax to form the B3 exciton, the ratio of PLE and absorptance should be unity throughout the absorption/PLE spectrum. The ratio of absorptance to PLE reflects the exciton localization efficiency from the state of excitation to the lowest energy B3 exciton state (the emissive state).4b,6d,9a As seen from Fig. 1b, the normalized PLE intensity is about 17% smaller than the absorptance in CdS rod absorption region, indicating that only 83% of excitons created in the CdS nanorod region relax to the B3 exciton state in the seed. The remaining 17% are trapped at the CdS rod surface.6d,6e Although this can also be caused by the presence of CdS nanorods without seed in the sample solution,4b its contribution is negligible according to the findings of the transient absorption studies to be discussed below.
Carrier localization dynamics in ZnSe/CdS nanorod
To support the above assignment and gain more insight into carrier distribution and relaxation dynamics, we performed femtosecond TA measurements on ZnSe/CdS nanorods. Excitation wavelength dependent TA studies have been proven to be an effective way to reveal the electronic structures and carrier dynamics in semiconductor nanoheterostructures.5c,6d,14 The TA spectra and kinetics of ZnSe/CdS NRs at early delay times (0–20 ps) after 555 nm and 400 nm excitations are displayed in Fig. 2 upper (a and b) and lower panel (c and d), respectively. To ensure that the TA kinetics can be compared with steady state photoreduction results, all TA measurements were carried out under single exciton conditions. Under such or lower excitation fluence, the contribution of the multiple exciton state is negligible, and the exciton dynamics are not dependent on the fluence. The former is evident in Fig. 2, which shows a lack of bi-exciton decay features on the 10–100 ps time scale.14 TA signals of semiconductor nanocrystals contain two contributions: the state filling induced bleach of exciton bands (main component) and carrier induced Stark effect signals (minor component) that are derivatives of exciton features.15 Similar to CdX (X = S, Se, Te) nanocrystals, the state filling induced TA signal in the ZnSe/CdS nanorod is dominated by conduction band electrons with negligible hole contributions because of much denser hole states and valence band fine structures.15 This assignment will be further validated by the electron transfer study described below. Under 555 nm excitation, which is in resonance with the lowest energy CT exciton transition (B3) in the bulb region, both B3 and B2 bleach features form instantaneously within the instrument response limit and decay in the same way in nanosecond time scale (not shown), confirming that these transitions share the same lowest energy electron level (1Se) in the conduction band. The occupation of electrons in the 1Se level doesn't lead to B1 bleach, confirming that its wavefunction is localized in bulb region without extending into the CdS rod.4a

The black solid lines are fits according to a model described in the ESI S2.† 
Under 400 nm excitation, which generates excitons in the CdS rod domain, B1 bleach forms quickly (∼50 fs formation time, see below) and then decays in the next few ps. Its decay leads to the growth of B2 and B3 bleach, indicating electron transport and localization from the lowest energy 1σe level in the CdS rod to the 1Se level in CdS bulb region. This electron localization process is clearly shown by the kinetics in Fig. 2d. These kinetics can be well fitted by a multiexponential model described in S2 and the fitting parameters are listed in Table S1.† According to the fit, both B2 and B3 bleaches show a biphasic rise with a ∼91% fast component (417 ± 42 fs for B2 and 487 ± 61 fs for B3) and a ∼9% slower component (9.02 ± 1.25 ps for B2 and 9.70 ± 0.82 ps for B3), and a much slower decay on the nanosecond time scale (Fig. S1†). It should be noted that the contribution of the B2 band at the B1 bleach position has been accounted for in the fit since the line-shape of the B2 bleach has been independently obtained in the TA spectra measured at 555 nm excitation (in which only the B2 bleach is present). The formation time of the B1 bleach, 53 (±11) fs, is assigned to the electron relaxation process from the initially excited 1π to 1σ level in the CdS NR.6d,12 The B1 bleach recovery contains two components: fast and slow (≫ 1 ns) recovery components with 81(±4)% and 19(±4)% of the total amplitudes, respectively. The fast B1 bleach decay component can be well described by a bi-exponential decay process (0.498 ± 0.057 ps, 89(±3)%; 9.09 ± 1.02 ps, 11(±3)%) that agrees well with the growth of B2 and B3, indicating that ∼81% of the initially created electrons in CdS rod decay to the bulb region. The ∼19% slow component can be attributed to exciton that is localized to the CdS rod. This rod-to-bulb electron localization efficiency is consistent with the 83% rod exciton localization efficiency determined from the PLE measurement shown in Fig. 1b. Similar competition of band alignment driven exciton localization and hole trapping induced exciton trapping has been reported in CdSe/CdS nanorods and tetrapods,6d,6e,16,17 and has been attributed to local energetic heterogeneities and strong e–h interaction arose from the dielectric contrast effect in one dimensional (1D) nanorods.6d,13a,13b The fast (∼490 fs) rod-to-bulb exciton localization component in the ZnSe/CdS nanorod can be assigned to free (untrapped) excitons. This exciton localization time is close to previously reported values in CdSe/CdS quasi-type II nanorods.5d,6d The origin of the smaller (9%) and slower (∼10 ps) component is unclear, although it could be attributed to excitons in shallow traps. A similar bi-phasic exciton localization process with two distinctly different rate constants has been observed in CdSe/CdS nanorods.5d It should be noted that because of the heterogeneities of nanorod properties (dimensions and trap densities), there are likely distributions of rate constants for these processes. Therefore, these apparent bi-phasic processes are likely a result of limited data quality and dynamic range, which prevents accurate determination of the distributions of these rate constants.
Steady state MV+˙ radial generation
The presence of multiple exciton species at different regions of the nanorod and their excitation wavelength dependent branching ratios suggests wavelength dependent photochemistry. To investigate this effect, we studied MV2+ photoreduction using these nanorods at two illumination wavelengths: 415 nm, where the absorption of CdS rod dominates, and 550 nm, which is in resonance with the ZnSe to CdS CT band in the bulb region. The samples contain MPA capped ZnSe/CdS NRs, MV2+ (2 mM) and excess MPA (50 mM) as electron donor in anaerobic pH = 7.5 aqueous solutions (see S1† for details). Upon 415 nm illumination, MV+˙ radicals formed quickly, as indicated by the growth of a distinct 605 nm band in the difference spectra shown in Fig. 3a (see Fig. S2† for results under 550 nm illumination). Both MPA and MV2+ have negligible absorption in this spectral range. In the absence of NRs or illumination, no MV+˙ radicals were observed. Using the reported extinction coefficient (13700 ± 300 M−1 cm−1 at 605 nm),18 the amount of MV+˙ radicals can be calculated to obtain the radical concentration and formation kinetics, which are shown in Fig. 3b.
 Fig. 3  Steady-state photoreduction of MV2+ using ZnSe/CdS NRs (a) UV-vis difference spectra (after–before irradiation) of a solution containing ZnSe/CdS NRs, MV2+ and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) after indicated duration of 415 nm illumination, showing the generation of MV+˙ radicals. Similar spectra for 550 nm illumination are shown in Fig. S2.† Experimental conditions: 2 mM MV2+, 50 mM pH 7.5 phosphate buffer, 50 mM MPA as sacrificial electron donor, total solution volume 2 mL. For illuminations at 415 nm (5.09 mW) and 550 nm (5.15 mW), the concentrations of MPA-capped ZnSe/CdSe NRs were adjusted to have an absorbance of 1.46 (OD) and 0.32 (OD), respectively, at the illumination wavelengths to maintain similar photon absorption rates in these measurements. (b) MV+˙ radical generation kinetics under 415 and 550 nm excitations. (c) Initial quantum yields of MV+˙ radical generation at 415 nm and 550 nm excitation. 
To quantify and compare the photoreduction performance under 415 and 550 nm excitations, we calculated the photon-to-MV+˙ conversion quantum yields, defined as ΦMV = Δ(MV+˙)/Δ(hν), where Δ(MV+˙) is the MV+˙ radical generation rate and Δ(hν) is the photon absorption rate. The latter was calculated from the illumination power and absorbance at the illumination wavelength (see S1† for details). As seen from the slope of MV+˙vs. illumination time plots in Fig. 3b, the MV+˙ radical generation rate was largest at the beginning of the reaction and decreased slowly due to the consumption of electron/hole acceptors and light absorption loss from generated MV+˙ radicals. Therefore, only the initial quantum yields, calculated from initial MV+˙ radical generation rates (first three points), are compared in Fig. 3c. Interestingly, the MV2+ photoreduction quantum yields were ∼34% under 555 nm excitation and ∼90%, at 415 nm excitation, showing a dramatic wavelength dependence.
Charge separation and recombination under 555 nm excitation
To investigate the origin of the wavelength dependent MV2+ photoreduction quantum yields and identify the loss mechanisms, we conducted TA measurements on the complete photoreduction systems under conditions similar to those for the steady-state MV2+ photoreduction (see ESI† for details). The NR concentrations have been increased by ∼5 times to allow measurement in a thinner cell (1 mm). For convenience, the transient absorption measurements were conducted with 400 nm and 555 nm excitation to mimic the steady state measurements at 415 nm and 550 nm illumination, respectively. The TA spectra of reaction solution without (denoted as MPA-DIR) and with (denoted as MPA-DIR–MV) MV2+ at 30 ps after 555 nm excitation are compared in Fig. 4a and the corresponding kinetics of B2 bleach in the first 20 ps in Fig. 4b. These spectra were recorded under the same single exciton excitation conditions, at which the contributions of the NRs with multiple excitons were negligible. At this excitation wavelength, the lowest energy CT exciton (B3) band in MPA capped ZnSe/CdS NRs was excited. The resulting TA spectra in the MPA-DIR sample were similar to those of ZnSe/CdS NRs in toluene (Fig. 2a), showing long-lived bleaches of B2 and B3 exciton bands. Because of more pronounced scattering of the excitation light for the water soluble nanorod solution, the B3 bleach was not fully resolved and we used B2 to monitor the fate of excited electrons in NRs since they probed the same electron level.
 Fig. 4  TA spectra and kinetics of a reaction solution under 555 nm excitation. The reaction solution was the same as that for the steady state MV+˙ radical generation measurement (see Fig. 2a) except for a (∼5 times) higher NR concentration. (a) TA spectra of MPA-capped ZnSe/CdS NR reaction solution without (blue solid line, denoted as MPA-DIR) and with (red solid line, denoted as MPA-DIR–MV) MV2+ at 30 ps delay time. Also shown are the spectra of the excitation pulse (dark gray line), MV+˙ radical spectrum obtained from CdS QD–MV2+ complexes (black dashed line) and the 1st derivative of B2 absorption band (green dashed line). (b) Comparison of B2 kinetics in ZnSe/CdS NRs without (blue solid line) and with (red solid line) MV2+. Also shown are the MV+˙ radical formation kinetics (dark green symbols), which have been scaled and displaced vertically for better comparison. (c) Comparison between MV+˙ radical decay kinetics (black solid line) and SE signal (470 nm) (red dashed line) in MPA-DIR–MV reaction solution and fluorescence decay kinetics (blue solid line) of MPA-DIR solution. 
Compared with MPA-DIR, the TA spectrum of MPA-DIR–MV at 30 ps shows a much smaller bleach amplitude and pronounced derivative feature (with a negative peak at 470 nm and a positive peak at 490 nm) at B2 exciton band, as well as an additional positive absorption band centered at ∼610 nm. The broad absorption band at ∼610 nm agrees well with the MV+˙ radical spectrum (black dashed line in Fig. 4a, obtained from CdS QD–MV2+ complexes) and can be assigned to the MV+˙ radical. The derivative feature at B2 exciton band agrees with the 1st order derivative spectrum of B2 absorption band (green dashed line in Fig. 4a) and can be assigned to Stark effect (SE) induced exciton peak shift in the charge separated state (with the electron in MV+˙ radical and hole in ZnSe seed), similar to other nanocrystal–MV2+ complexes.1b,6d,12,14a,19 It will be shown below that the SE signal is dominated by the effect of the ZnSe valence band hole on the exciton bands and can be used to follow the valence band hole population in the charge separated state. As shown in Fig. 4b, compared with B2 in MPA-DIR, which shows negligible bleach recovery in the first 20 ps, the B2 bleach in MPA-DIR–MV has fully recovered in the same time period, suggesting a short-lived conduction band electron in the presence of MV2+. Furthermore, the B2 bleach recovery kinetic agrees well with the MV+˙ radical formation kinetics in MPA-DIR–MV, indicating electron transfer from the NR to MV2+ molecules to form the MV+˙ radicals. The MV+˙ radical formation kinetics can be fitted by a single exponential function with a time constant of 3.2 ± 0.2 ps (Fig. S5†). Previous studies have reported non-single-exponential electron transfer kinetics from QDs to adsorbates due to heterogeneities in the number of acceptor, QD size and QD–acceptor interaction.19b,20 Similar heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics can be expected in our NR–MV2+ complexes. The apparent single exponential kinetics are likely a result of limited S/N ratio of the data. This electron transfer rate in MPA-DIR–MV is much faster (>1000 times) than the nanosecond intrinsic lifetime of electrons in MPA-DIR, which suggests a unity QY of the initial exciton dissociation/interfacial electron transfer process if we assume that the addition of MV2+ to the NR sample doesn't introduce other electron loss pathways. This assumption is consistent with the high steady state quantum yield shown in Fig. 3 and the near unity quantum yield reported previously for CdSe/CdS NRs.1b The ultrafast electron transfer rate also suggests that MV2+ acceptors are adsorbed on the NR surface.
The observed unity QY of initial electron transfer from NR to MV2+ (deduced from the measured electron transfer rate above) suggests that the nonunity steady state MV2+ photoreduction QE (Fig. 3) must result from charge recombination of the MV+˙ radical with the hole. To monitor the MV+˙ radical recombination loss, the TA kinetics of MV+˙ radical and SE signal (at 470 nm) from 10 ps to 10 μs are compared in Fig. 4c. The maximum value of the MV+˙ radical has been normalized to one to reflect the unity yield of initial electron transfer. The normalized MV+˙ radical signal amplitude represents the time dependent transient QY in the reaction solution, reflecting the extent of recombination loss. The MV+˙ radical transient QY decreases gradually with time, showing a half-life time of ∼170 ns. The transient QY is ∼38% at 10 μs, close to the steady state MV2+ photoreduction quantum yield, indicating that the charge recombination loss is the main cause for the low steady state quantum yield under 550 nm illumination.
The lifetime of the MV+˙ radical is determined by the competition between back electron transfer from the radical to the hole in the ZnSe valence band (i.e. charge recombination) and hole removal by electron donors. The latter process can be probed by the band edge fluorescence decay kinetics of MPA-DIR, as shown in Fig. 4c. Because transient absorption kinetics of MPA-DIR show a long lived CB electron with a half-life time of ∼10 ns, the measured PL decay can be attributed to the removal of ZnSe valence band holes by MPA.1b,3e The fluorescence decay shows a half-life time of ∼2 ns, which is ∼4 time longer than the previously reported value in ZnSe/CdS NRs,3e probably due to a thicker CdS shell surrounding the ZnSe seed in our ZnSe/CdS NRs. The intrinsic charge recombination rate of the MV+˙ radical with the hole in ZnSe valence band can also be measured in ZnSe/CdS–MV2+ complexes, in the absence of electron donor. As shown in Fig. S3,† the SE signal shows identical decay kinetics as MV+˙ radical with a half-life time of ∼22 ns, reflecting the charge recombination process between the VB hole in ZnSe seed and the electron in MV+˙ radical.
As shown in Fig. 4c, the SE signal decay is faster than the decay of MV+˙ radicals in MPA-DIR–MV and the PL decay in MPA-DIR. It suggests that the charge separation induced SE signal is due to the presence of holes in the ZnSe seed, instead of electrons in MV+˙ radical. This assignment is further supported below in the kinetics measured with 400 nm excitation, in which we show that the SE decay follows the hole removal kinetics by MPA while the MV+˙ radical show negligible decay during the same time period. Under 550 nm excitation, the SE decay in MPA-DIR–MV contains the contributions of ZnSe valence band hole removal by both transfer to MPA and charge recombination with MV+˙ radicals. As a result, the SE signal decays faster than the MV+˙ radical decay in MPA-DIR–MV and PL decay in MPA-DIR. It should be pointed out that the loss of MV+˙ radical persisted even after the complete removal of ZnSe valence band holes (monitored by SE decay), suggesting recombination with the trapped holes or oxidized MPA molecules on hundreds of nanosecond time scale. The short spatial separation of the electron (in MV+˙ radicals) and hole (in ZnSe seeds or oxidized MPA) in the charge separate state is the key reason for the relatively low steady state quantum yield of MV2+ photoreduction under 555 nm excitation.
Charge separation and recombination under 400 nm excitation
Shown in Fig. 5 are the comparison of TA spectra and kinetics in MPA-DIR and MPA-DIR–MV measured with 400 nm excitation. These spectra were recorded under the same single exciton excitation conditions. As shown in ESI S6,† MPA-DIR in water shows similar TA spectra and B1, B2, B3 kinetics as DIR in toluene (without MPA) in the first 50 ps. Therefore, the early time exciton localization dynamics for MPA capped NRs in water are similar to ZnSe/CdS NRs in toluene discussed above. At a later delay time, the exciton bleach decay kinetics for MPA-DIR are faster than NRs in toluene, which may be attributed to faster electron trapping or electron–hole recombination caused by the ligand exchange process. Compared with MPA-DIR, the B1 bleach in MPA-DIR–MV had a smaller (∼58%) initial amplitude and nearly completely recovered in the first ∼1 ps; the B2 (B3) bleach showed an initial amplitude of only ∼14% of the free NR and a relatively slow decay on the a few ps time scale. The decay of these exciton bleaches was accompanied by the formation of derivative-like Stark effect features at those exciton bands and a MV+˙ radical absorption band at 600 nm. These spectral signatures are similar to those observed under 555 nm excitation and can be also attributed to electron transfer from the NR to the MV2+ molecules.

The MV+˙ radical formation kinetics can be fitted by a biexponential function with amplitudes and time constants of (87 ± 3%, 132 ± 23 fs) and (13 ± 3%, 3.0 ± 0.4 ps), respectively. The electron transfer time of the fast component is ∼4 times faster than the exciton localization time from the CdS rod to the bulb region, suggesting that 87% of the exciton generated in the CdS rod undergoes ultrafast transfer to MV2+ before exciton localization. For the slower MV+˙ radical growth component, its percentage agrees with initial amplitude of B2/B3 bleach and its formation time is the same as the electron transfer time from the conduction band 1Se level of the bulb region, which has been measured with 555 nm excitation (Fig. 4). This indicates that in MPA-DIR–MV, only ∼13% of the excitons initially generated in CdS rod localize into the bulb region where they dissociate by electron transfer (∼3 ps) to MV2+ molecules. The much faster electron transfer rate from CdS rod than from the bulb region can be attributed to a larger quantum confinement along radial direction in the CdS rod region.
These results suggest that excitons generated in the CdS rod region of ZnSe/CdS NRs have three charge separation pathways, which are summarized in Fig. 6. Because of ultrafast electron transfer from the CdS nanorod to MV2+ (faster than exciton localization), under the presence of MV2+, only 13% of the excitons localizes to the ZnSe/CdS bulb region, where they dissociate by electron transfer to MV2+ with a time constant of ∼3 ps to form charge separated state A. The other 87% of the excitons undergo ultrafast electron transfer (∼132 fs) to MV2+ adsorbed on the CdS rod. Among them, 17%, which are trapped on CdS rod due to hole trapping, leads to charge separated state B. The remaining 70% generates holes in the valence band of CdS rod, which is followed by rapid localization to the ZnSe seed because of the valance band offset. This pathway produces a charge-separated state C with a much larger distance between the electron (in MV+˙ radical) and the hole (in ZnSe or MPA ligand surrounding the bulb). Here we have assumed that the adsorption of MV2+ does not affect the hole trapping rate on CdS rods.
 Fig. 6  Schematic depiction of charge separated states A, B and C generated in MPA-DIR–MV complexes after excitation at the bulb and rod regions. (A): hole localized in ZnSe and electron transferred to MV2+ adsorbed on the bulb region. (B and C): electron transferred to MV2+ adsorbed on the rod region with the hole trapped in the CdS rod (B) and localized in the ZnSe seed (C). Also shown is the branching ratios of these pathways and their steady state quantum yields for MV2+ photoreduction. 
This model is further supported by a comparison of charge separated state spectra at 30 ps measured with 400 and 555 nm excitations (inset of Fig. 5b). At this delay time, the charge separation process is completed and the charge recombination and hole removal processes haven't started yet. It shows a ∼20% smaller SE signal for the spectrum measured at 400 nm excitation. Because of the 1:1 relationship between MV+˙ radical and ZnSe seed localized hole (which leads to SE signal) at 555 nm excitation, the smaller SE signal at 400 nm excitation suggests only 80% of the hole is localized at the ZnSe seed, consistent with the branching ratios to pathway A and C, while 20% of the hole is trapped on the CdS rod domain, corresponding to pathway B. Because of the strongly localized nature of trapped holes on CdS rod and their spatial separation from the seed region in ZnSe/CdS nanorod, they have negligible contribution to the B2 Stark effect signal in the charge separated state.
The ultrafast exciton dissociation and MV+˙ radical formation kinetics shown in Fig. 5 suggest a unity initial MV+˙ radical generation QY at 400 nm excitation. To explain the steady state QY shown in Fig. 3, we again measured the TA spectra of MPA-DIR–MV up to 10 μs after 400 nm excitation to monitor the charge recombination loss. The TA spectra from 0.05 ns to 10 μs are shown in Fig. 7a, which shows the pronounced SE signal and MV+˙ radical absorption from charge separated states. A normalized comparison of the kinetics of SE signal at 470 nm and MV+˙ radical signal at 610 nm is shown in Fig. 7b. Also compared is the band edge PL decay kinetics of MPA-DIR, which monitors the removal of the ZnSe valence band hole by MPA molecules. SE decay in MPA-DIR–MV agrees with the PL decay kinetics of MPA-DIR, with a half-life time of ∼2 ns. This agreement indicates that the SE signal is caused mainly by the holes in the ZnSe seed and hole transfer to MPA is the dominant hole decay pathway in MPA-DIR–MV at 400 nm excitation. The MV+˙ radical decays much more slowly compared to the kinetics measured with 555 nm excitation. The transient QY at 10 μs is 88%, which is consistent with the high steady state QY (90%, Fig. 3) and indicates an efficient suppression of the charge recombination process at this excitation wavelength. As will be discussed below, efficient suppression of charge recombination can be attributed to the presence of longer distance charge separated state (pathways B and C) upon the excitation of the CdS rod region.

Mechanism of wavelength dependent MV2+ photoreduction yield
The time-resolved studies of the elementary steps involved in the overall MV2+ photoreduction reaction provide insight into the mechanisms for wavelength dependent MV+˙ radical generation QY under steady state illumination. As shown in Fig. 6, direct excitation of the bulb region at 550 nm (or wavelength longer than B2), generate charge transfer excitons in the bulb region with holes confined in the ZnSe seed and electrons localized in the CdS bulb. These excitons dissociate by electron transfer (∼3 ps) to adsorbed MV2+ molecules with unity quantum yield. Due to the proximity of the electrons with the holes left in the ZnSe seed (or transferred thiol), the charge recombination loss is high, leading to relatively small steady MV+˙ radical generation QY (∼35%). As discussed above, TA study at 400 nm (Fig. 5) reveals that illumination at B1 or shorter wavelength generates excitons in CdS nanorod domain that undergo three pathways of charge separation. As shown in Fig. 6, the CS state in pathway A (13%) is similar to the direct excitation of the CT band, which should lead to a steady state MV+˙ radical generation QY of 34%, similar to that measured at 550 nm excitation. Pathway B (17%) is similar to that observed in the CdS rod (without the ZnSe seed), the QY of which is estimated to be ∼66% based on a previous measurement of CdS rods.1b The remaining 70% of excitons proceed by pathway C, which generates a charge separated state with long e–h spatial distance to effectively suppress charge recombination loss. Assuming a MV+˙ radical generation QY of 100% for pathway C, we can estimate a total quantum yield of ∼86% for 400 nm illumination, which is close to the measured value (90%).
Similar competition of exciton trapping on the CdS rod and localization to the seed region has also been observed in CdSe/CdS NRs and rod-to-seed exciton localization efficiency ranging from ∼53% to unity has been reported by different groups.6d,9a,16 We previously observed near unity quantum efficiency of MV+˙ radical photogeneration using CdSe/CdS nanorods, which suggests that pathway C is the dominating charge transfer process in that sample.1b This difference may be attributed to sample dependent branching ratios among the multiple pathways, which likely depend on the synthetic conditions (trap density and distribution), nanorod shape and dimensions (size and length of the rod, as well as the size of seed and shell thickness of the bulb region),6d,9a,16 and variation of electron acceptor binding affinities in different regions of the NR. Furthermore, in the presence of catalysts, these MV+˙ radical photogeneration systems can be used for light-driven H2 evolution1b,7 or CO2 reduction.8 Therefore, wavelength dependent quantum yields of photocatalysis can be expected in systems that employ these nanorods as light harvesting components.
Further optimization of the system can be achieved by enhancing the branching ratio of pathway C and/or improving the efficiencies of pathways A and B. Through selective etching of the CdS outer shell in the bulb region,3d the removal of the hole in the seed by an electron donor can be enhanced, which should improve the MV+˙ generation efficiency for pathway A.3d Trapping of excitons on CdS nanorod surface represents another major loss. Surface passivation (e.g. Cd2+ layer termination) to remove the hole trapping sites could be one way to reduce the contribution of pathway B.21 In addition, it is found that shorter nanorods and nanotetrapod heterostructures can decrease exciton trapping in the CdS rod domain,9a which can also boost the efficiency of this redox mediator based solar-to-fuel conversion approach. The high efficiency of pathway C requires ultrafast electron transfer to acceptors to compete with fast exciton localization to the seed region. To achieve efficient charge separation to acceptors with slow electron transfer rates (such as catalysts), it would be helpful to explore more sophisticated nanoheterostructures that have been designed for long distance electron and hole separation within the nanoheterostrutures.
Conclusions
We have investigated the wavelength dependent exciton localization and photoreduction mechanisms in type II ZnSe/CdS dot-in-rod nanorod heterostructures by transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence decay. It was shown that excitation of the lowest energy charge transfer band generated a long-lived exciton state with the hole localized in the ZnSe seed and the electron localized in the surrounding CdS bulb region. Despite the type II band alignment, the conduction band electron did not extend substantially to the CdS rod, which was likely caused by smaller diameter (larger electron confinement energy) of the latter region and strong Coulomb interaction with the hole in the ZnSe seed. For ZnSe/CdS nanorods studied here, 83% of excitons generated in the CdS rod localized rapidly to the charge transfer exciton state in the seed/bulb region and the remaining 17% remained in the CdS rod, likely caused by rapid hole trapping.
Under continuous illumination in the presence of MPA electron donor, the wavelength dependent exciton distribution led to a dramatic wavelength dependent steady state QY of MV2+ photoreduction in aqueous solution: 34% and 90% for 550 nm and 415 nm excitation, respectively. Direct excitation of charge transfer exciton band at 550 nm created excitons in the bulb region, whose dissociation by electron transfer to MV2+ generated charge separated state A with the hole in the ZnSe seed and the electron in the MV+˙ radical adsorbed in the bulb region. The spatial proximity of the electron and hole gave rise to large recombination loss, accounting for the lower steady state QY of MV2+ photoreduction at 550 nm illumination. Excitation of the CdS rod led to three types of charge separated states. The majority of excitons (70%) dissociated by ultrafast electron transfer to MV2+, followed by rapid hole localization into the ZnSe seed to generate charge separated state C. Due to the large spatial separation of the electrons (in MV+˙ adsorbed on the rod region) and holes (localized in the seed), this charge separated state suppressed recombination, leading to near unity steady state quantum yield of MV2+ photoreduction. The remaining pathways generated charge-separated states with both electrons and holes in the bulb/seed region (A) or in the rod region (B). The smaller e–h spatial separation in these pathways led to larger recombination loss and lower steady-state quantum yield. Since competition among these pathways is likely a general property, the observed wavelength dependent exciton distribution and photocatalysis QY can also be expected in many other linear and branched nanoheterostructures (e.g. Cd or Zn based nanorod, nanowires, tetrapods, dumbbells). Furthermore, the branching ratios among these competing pathways depend on the synthetic conditions and shapes and dimensions of the nanoheterostructures, which suggests possible approaches for rational improvement of their performance in light-harvesting and charge separation applications.

The y-axis is in the unit of (left) absorptance (the ratio of absorbed to incident light) for the absorption spectrum and (right) intensity for the emission spectrum. Inset: comparison of absorptance spectrum (black line) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum (red dashed line). These spectra have been scaled to the same intensity at 550 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  TA spectra and kinetics of ZnSe/CdS NRs in toluene at early delay time (0–20 ps) after 550 nm (upper panel) and 440 nm (lower panel) excitations. TA spectra at indicated delay times (a and c) and formation and decay kinetics of bleaches at B1 (green squares), B2 (blue triangles), and B3 (red circles) transitions (b and d). The black solid lines are fits according to a model described in the ESI S2.†	 

 	Fig. 3  Steady-state photoreduction of MV2+ using ZnSe/CdS NRs (a) UV-vis difference spectra (after–before irradiation) of a solution containing ZnSe/CdS NRs, MV2+ and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) after indicated duration of 415 nm illumination, showing the generation of MV+˙ radicals. Similar spectra for 550 nm illumination are shown in Fig. S2.† Experimental conditions: 2 mM MV2+, 50 mM pH 7.5 phosphate buffer, 50 mM MPA as sacrificial electron donor, total solution volume 2 mL. For illuminations at 415 nm (5.09 mW) and 550 nm (5.15 mW), the concentrations of MPA-capped ZnSe/CdSe NRs were adjusted to have an absorbance of 1.46 (OD) and 0.32 (OD), respectively, at the illumination wavelengths to maintain similar photon absorption rates in these measurements. (b) MV+˙ radical generation kinetics under 415 and 550 nm excitations. (c) Initial quantum yields of MV+˙ radical generation at 415 nm and 550 nm excitation.	 

 	Fig. 4  TA spectra and kinetics of a reaction solution under 555 nm excitation. The reaction solution was the same as that for the steady state MV+˙ radical generation measurement (see Fig. 2a) except for a (∼5 times) higher NR concentration. (a) TA spectra of MPA-capped ZnSe/CdS NR reaction solution without (blue solid line, denoted as MPA-DIR) and with (red solid line, denoted as MPA-DIR–MV) MV2+ at 30 ps delay time. Also shown are the spectra of the excitation pulse (dark gray line), MV+˙ radical spectrum obtained from CdS QD–MV2+ complexes (black dashed line) and the 1st derivative of B2 absorption band (green dashed line). (b) Comparison of B2 kinetics in ZnSe/CdS NRs without (blue solid line) and with (red solid line) MV2+. Also shown are the MV+˙ radical formation kinetics (dark green symbols), which have been scaled and displaced vertically for better comparison. (c) Comparison between MV+˙ radical decay kinetics (black solid line) and SE signal (470 nm) (red dashed line) in MPA-DIR–MV reaction solution and fluorescence decay kinetics (blue solid line) of MPA-DIR solution.

The reaction solution is the same as that for steady state MV radical generation except for a higher (∼5 times) NR concentration. (a and b) TA spectra of MPA-capped ZnSe/CdS DIR reaction solution without (a) and with (b) MV2+ at indicated delay times. Inset in Fig. b: comparison of TA spectra at 30 ps measured with 400 nm and 555 nm excitation. (c–f) Comparison of B1, B2, B3 and MV+˙ kinetics (615 nm) between MPA-DIR and MPA-DIR–MV.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic depiction of charge separated states A, B and C generated in MPA-DIR–MV complexes after excitation at the bulb and rod regions. (A): hole localized in ZnSe and electron transferred to MV2+ adsorbed on the bulb region. (B and C): electron transferred to MV2+ adsorbed on the rod region with the hole trapped in the CdS rod (B) and localized in the ZnSe seed (C). Also shown is the branching ratios of these pathways and their steady state quantum yields for MV2+ photoreduction.
