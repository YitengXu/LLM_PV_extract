    , Accepted 23rd May 2018First published on 30th May 2018AbstractLinear small molecules have been proved to be promising donor materials for high performance small molecular solar cells (SMSCs). In this paper, a series of narrow-band gap, π-conjugated small molecules (SMs) with a D(A–Ar)2 linear framework, denoted as FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, based on fluorinated 2,2′-bithiophene (FBT) as an electron-donating (D) central core, pyridine-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (PyDPP), isoindigo (IID) or thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) as electron-accepting (A) units, and 2-octylthiophene (Ar) units as end-capping units, have been designed and synthesized for application as donor materials in solution-processed SM organic solar cells (OSCs). The impacts of different acceptor units and fluorinated central cores on bulk properties, such as the optoelectronic properties, carrier mobility, the HOMO/LUMO energy level, and the morphologies of blend films, as well as optimization on device performance via appropriate solvent vapor annealing (SVA) are systematically investigated. The as-cast devices based on FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 exhibit PCEs of 5.04%, 5.68% and 6.86%, respectively. Encouragingly, after a SVA treatment with carbon disulfide (CS2) for 20 s, an impressively improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 6.86% to 9.00% with an increase of 35% was obtained in the FBT(TDPP-T)2/PC71BM (w/w, 1:1) based cells due to an enhanced short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.14 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 73.52%, which is among the highest reported for D(A–Ar)2-type SM-based solar cells with a PCE up to 9.0% so far. Our research results reported here clearly demonstrate that highly efficient SM-OSCs can be obtained via rational design of their molecular structure and optimization of the phase-separated morphology through an appropriate solvent-vapor annealing process.
1. Introduction
As a promising next generation energy source technology, bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) based on polymers or small molecules (SMs) as donors and fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC71BM) as acceptors have received an extensive amount of attention in the past few decades due to their remarkable advantages, such as light weight, low cost, flexibility and large-scale fabrication.1–7 So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction BHJ-OSCs have rapidly increased to over 13% and 11% for polymers and SMs as donors, respectively.8,9 Especially over the past two years, as a result of rapid improvements in both innovative materials and device architectures, high PCEs exceeding 12.0% have been achieved for SM BHJ-OSCs.10,11 Particularly, since the narrow bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH combined with a SM-nonfullerene acceptor showed a high PCE of 6.31%,12 an outstanding achievement has already been made in polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on SM-nonfullerene acceptors, and record PCEs of 14.08% and 14.9% have been achieved for ternary and tandem PSCs,13,14 respectively. Unquestionably, these successes might highlight their advantages in the future commercialization of OSCs.
Though great progress has been made recently in PSCs,5–7,12–14 some unsolved problems, such as purification, reproducibility and the undefined relationship of the structure, are still arduous challenges to enhance photovoltaic performance.15–18 Nevertheless, compared to their polymeric counterparts, SMs have many prominent merits, such as easy purification and high reproducibility ascribed to the defined structure and thus less batch to batch variation,16–18 which can provide a deeper understanding of how to design efficient photovoltaic materials and thus ensure greater reproducibility in the device performance. Therefore, solution-processed, SM-based OSCs have attracted dramatically increasing attention over the past few years, approaching the records of the best PSCs reported so far.11,19–25 For example, solution processed SM-OSCs have demonstrated PCEs exceeding 10% recently.11,22 However, the relationship of the molecular structure and properties, and the design method of SMs with high photovoltaic performance still remain unclear. Therefore, in SM OSCs, donor material innovation is regarded as the key point to achieve high-performance devices.
To obtain high PCE in SM OSCs, numerous narrow-band gap SMs composed of electron-rich donor (D) and electron-deficient acceptor (A) units have been extensively synthesized and applied in OSCs, due to their easily tunable energy levels, planarity and solubility.22–32 BHJ OSCs based on A–D–A or A–π–D–π–A structured SMs as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors have shown the highest PCEs of 12.7% and 11.3%, respectively.10,22 Recently, another family of SMs with a linear D(A–Ar)2 skeleton has also made significant progress, which exhibited maximum PCEs from 2.90 to 8.30%.33–45 Particularly, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit is often used as the A unit, mainly because of its relatively rigid molecular structure, strong electron withdrawing ability, high carrier mobility, strong light absorption and good planarity, and some SMs with a D(A–Ar)2 skeleton containing DPP units as acceptor arms have been reported,38–45 which lead to a high short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) in SM-OSCs and thus enhance the photovoltaic properties. For example, OSCs based on a SM named BDTT–(DPP)2–CF3 with DPP acceptor arms coupled with alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) donors showed a PCE value up to 8.30%.42 Recently, OSCs based on DFPh(DPP-Py)2 with DPP as acceptor units coupled with 1,4-difluorobenzene (DFPh) rigid donor cores exhibited a splendid PCE of 7.54% as reported by our group.45 Meanwhile, thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) and pyridine-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (PyDPP) were selected to make a comparison as acceptor units, in which both of them not only possess good coplanarity, but also show totally different energy levels.46 Furthermore, isoindigo (IID) units have been widely used in the dye industry because of their following advantages: strong electron-withdrawing ability, broad absorption spectra, high extinction coefficients, low HOMO levels and better planar architectures.47,48 Clearly, significant progress in the D(A–Ar)2 skeleton system could be comparable to that achieved in PSCs, indicating its promising future in practical applications.
Fluorine (F) atom substitution on polymers has been a powerful strategy to improve their PSC performances.49–57 For instance, a device based on fluorinated PNTz4TF2 as the donor exhibited a higher PCE of 10.50% than nonfluorinated PNTz4T as the donor with a PCE of 3.7%.56 Particularly, combining the fluorinated polymer PM6 with the fluorinated nonfullerene acceptor IT-4F, the corresponding PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 13.5%, which is among the highest values in the literature for PSCs to date.57 Recently, various SMs containing F atoms as photovoltaic donor materials have been reported.46,55,60 For example, by changing the donor material of nonfluorinated TTH-D3TRh to the fluorinated TTF-D3TRh, the PCE of the corresponding OSCs was tremendously elevated from 5.89% to 7.14% with an increasing of 21%.55 This is mainly due to the intramolecular interactions between fluorine and sulfur atom (F⋯S) noncovalent bonds, which are beneficial for enhancing the planarity of the molecular backbone and crystallinity.46–56 As we all know, the fluorinated 2,2′-bithiophene (FBT) unit has been used as a donor unit in SMs and polymers for photovoltaic applications.44,51,58–60 The FBT moiety was employed as the central core mainly owing to its good rigid skeleton structure, which can reduce the torsion angle between conjugated units and lead to the improvement of molecular co-planarity. Therefore, the corresponding SMs and polymers exhibit an improved π–π packing with enhanced backbone aggregations, which would also induce an enhanced charge carrier mobility.44,51 For example, DFDT(DPP)2 exhibited a PCE value as high as 7.87%.63 Apparently, the development of innovative donor materials plays a key scientific roll in achieving high-performance devices.
To systematically explore the influence of the different A arm units and molecular framework on the photovoltaic performance of SMs with a D(A–Ar)2 framework, in this work, a series of spatially symmetrical narrow-band gap SMs with a D(A–Ar)2 skeleton, named FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, containing FBT as the central D core and a 2-octylthiophene terminal as the Ar unit coupled with different A units, such as pyridine-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (PyDPP), isoindigo (IID) or thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP), were designed and synthesized, respectively (Chart 1). The strategy of combining fluorination on the core unit and different A units would provide a reasonably lower-lying HOMO energy level and higher carrier mobility to increase the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the related SM-OSCs.55,62 As expected, the devices with PC71BM as the acceptor exhibited the PCEs of 5.04%, 5.68% and 6.86% for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively. After an appropriate solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment with carbon disulfide (CS2), extensively improved PCEs of 6.40%, 7.78% and 9.00% were achieved for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively. Compared with FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2, FBT(PyDPP-T)2 shows a lower band gap, better planarity, higher carrier mobility and better film morphology. Ultimately, the BHJ OSCs based on FBT(TDPP-T)2/PC71BM present an outstanding PCE up to 9.00%, attributed to the enhanced Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 75.32% simultaneously.45,60 To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 9.0% and Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2 are the highest values that have been recorded so far for D(A–Ar)2-type SM-based BHJ-OSCs. The results reveal that high PCE in OSCs based on SMs can be noticeably enhanced through careful engineering of the molecular structure and optimization of the morphology of blend films by CS2-SVA treatment. As we all know, the treatment using different solvents also has important effects on other types of solar cell devices; for instance, solvent-treated hybrid perovskite-based solar cells have attracted more attention due to their high device performance.64,65 Meanwhile, organic π-conjugated molecules have been applied in hybrid perovskite solar cells to realize efficient passivation and charge-extraction.66 This synthesized narrow band gap FBT(TDPP-T)2 may be applied in perovskite solar cells to achieve higher performance or to optimize some parameters due to its higher thermal stability, better crystallization and improved light-harvesting ability.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis, thermal properties and crystallinity
As shown in Scheme 1, three FBT-based SM donors, namely FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, had been synthesized and characterized. The target SMs were prepared through Stille coupling reactions. Good solubility in common organic solvents was observed for these FBT-central SMs, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), and dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at room temperature. All compounds were purified by silica gel column chromatography, and their structures were consistent with molecular formulas characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF and elemental analysis (see the ESI†).
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) graphs of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 are respectively shown in Fig. 1a, and the detailed corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Under nitrogen protection, the onset temperature with 5% weight loss temperature (Td) is 395 °C for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, 385 °C for FBT(IID-T)2 and 414 °C for FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively, which indicated that the thermal stability of these FBT-based SMs is enough for long-term photovoltaic application with a 5% weight loss Td over 380 °C. Meanwhile, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves are also shown in Fig. 1b, and the relational data are also depicted in Table 1. An endothermic transition and an exothermic transition appeared in these SMs. The endothermic/exothermic transition temperatures of 228/205 °C for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, 248/206 °C for FBT(IID-T)2, and 216/193 °C for FBT(TDPP-T)2 are obviously observed, respectively. Compared with FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2, FBT(TDPP-T)2 shows an obvious sharper melting peak and crystal peak, indicating that FBT(TDPP-T)2 has a more tendency towards crystallization than the other two SMs.60 Obviously, the better crystallinity property helps to improve the Jsc and FF of the corresponding device.38,45

3.2. Optical properties
To investigate the correlation between their structural modifications and corresponding photophysical properties, the UV-vis absorption spectra of these SMs both in diluted chloroform solution (10−5 M) and in thin solid films obtained by spin-coating are recorded in Fig. 2, and the detailed characteristics of absorption are listed in Table 2. As depicted in Fig. 2a, the absorption spectra of these compounds in diluted chloroform solutions exhibit a typical absorption band in the short-wavelength range from 300 to 500 nm, which could be ascribed to the π–π* electron transition of the conjugated backbone. Meanwhile, a strong absorption band in the long-wavelength range from 500 to 700 nm should be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between their donor units and acceptor moieties,35–38 which benefited from their appropriate conjugation length and D–A molecular structures with FBT and various A arm units. In comparison with the absorption plots of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, the absorption spectra of both FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 are red-shifted toward longer wavelengths and show a broader absorption region. In addition, the absorption spectra of SMs in dilute chloroform solutions and in blend films with PC71BM at an optimized ratio of 1:1 (w/w) are shown in Fig. S12a and b,† respectively. As shown in Fig. S12a,† the maximum molar absorption coefficient (ε) value of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2, and FBT(TDPP-T)2 was calculated to be 7.08 × 104 (590 nm), 6.08 × 104 (595 nm), and 1.20 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (660 nm) in chloroform solution, respectively. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S12b,† FBT(TDPP-T)2:PC71BM exhibits a larger absorption coefficient than those of FBT(PyDPP-T)2:PC71BM and FBT(IID-T)2:PC71BM in the range of 600–850 nm, which mainly comes from the stronger absorption of FBT(TDPP-T)2. Obviously, the improved light-harvesting ability of FBT(TDPP-T)2 is beneficial to enhancing Jsc values in the OSCs.

As shown in Fig. 2b, in the solid state, the absorption spectra of these SMs in films are red-shifted and showed an enhanced 0–0 vibrational peak in comparison with their absorption in solutions, which might be attributed to the higher π-electron delocalization and more planar conjugated backbone by π–π packing in the solid films. As a result, the films of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 exhibited red-shifts of 50, 59, and 70 nm, respectively, in comparison with the absorption maxima in solutions. Furthermore, additional shoulder peaks at 640, 654, and 730 nm appear in the FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 films, respectively, which may be assigned to the strong interchain aggregation. As shown in Fig. S13 (see the ESI†), according to the Tauc plot equation: (Ahν)2 = B(hν − Eoptg),67 the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the films were estimated to be 1.81 eV for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, 1.74 eV for FBT(IID-T)2, and 1.59 eV for FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively, as listed in Table 2. Obviously, the introduction of the TDPP arms not only yields the lowest band gap and a wider absorption, but also increases the absorption coefficient of the corresponding FBT(TDPP-T)2, which is helpful to obtain higher Jsc in the devices. Therefore, we can properly adjust the optical bandgaps of the D(A–Ar)2 type SMs by combining with narrower bandgap acceptors, which results in broadening the absorption spectra and getting more opportunities to harvest light. Furthermore, the aggregation of these SMs is further confirmed by temperature-dependent absorptions (from 30 up to 90 °C) in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution. As shown in Fig. 3, with the increase of solution temperature from 30 to 90 °C, all ratios IA0–1/IA0–0 preliminary decrease, and their corresponding A0–1 maximum intensities showed a certain blue-shift. Obviously, the ratio of IA0–1/IA0–0 combined with the blue-shift observed is in good agreement with the fact that rising temperature generates molecular disorder and weakens π–π stacking interactions. Especially for FBT(TDPP-T)2, when the temperature rises to 70 °C, the obvious shoulder peak disappears entirely, which demonstrates that FBT(TDPP-T)2 can form a stronger intermolecular aggregation than those of the other SMs.45,52

3.3. Electrochemical properties
To further investigate the electrochemical properties of these SMs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to test the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels according to our previous method.42,60 As shown in Fig. 4a, all SMs exhibit reversible oxidation and reduction waves. The onset oxidation/reduction potentials of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 are estimated to be 1.05/−1.07, 1.09/−0.99 and 0.85/−1.10 V, respectively. These results imply that these SMs possess good abilities in transporting positive and negative charges.58,59 Based on empirical equations: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.38) eV and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.38) eV,41 the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO/ELUMO) of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 are calculated to be −5.43/−3.31, −5.47/−3.39 and −5.23/−3.28 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the electrochemical band gaps (Eeleg) are detected to be 2.12, 2.08 and 1.95 eV for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively, which are well consistent with the values from the absorption measurements (Eoptg).67 From the data we can see that the introduced IID units can more effectively reduce the HOMO level of FBT(IID-T)2, which is expected to achieve a relatively higher Voc from its OSCs fabricated later. As a comparison, the electronic energy level diagram of the SMs and the fullerene acceptor [6,6]-phenylC71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) used in this work is presented in Fig. 4b and the corresponding electrochemical data of these SMs are also listed in Table 2. The LUMO energy offsets are 0.69, 0.61 and 0.72 eV for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 in comparison with the LUMO energy of PC71BM, respectively, which would provide enough driving force (>0.3 eV) to ensure efficient exciton dissociation at the D/A interface, and thus enhance energetically favorable electron transfer in SM-OSCs.58–60,63

3.4. Theoretical calculations
To further understand the micro-influence of the F⋯S conformation lock and the influence brought about by different A units in these SMs on the backbone and energy levels, the density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP; 6-31G*) method was employed to estimate the HOMO and LUMO distributions of these SMs as shown in Table 1. The top-view and side-view of their optimized geometric structures and the experimental energy levels and the electron-state-density distributions in the molecular orbital are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The dihedral (DH) angles between the FBT central core and the acceptors were calculated to be 19.432°, 21.175° and 11.616° for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively. Moreover, the DH angles between the two fluorinated thiophenes of the three SMs were calculated to be 0.199, 0.358° and 0.091° for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively. Obviously, from the dihedral angle (DH) data of the top-view together with the side-view, we can conclude that FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 have a better molecular planarity than FBT(IID-T)2; especially, the planarity of FBT(TDPP-T)2 is outstanding among the three SMs, which can promote intermolecular π–π stacking and further facilitate the increase of their FF value. Fig. 5b shows that electron densities are delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone in the HOMO and LUMO for FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, and the electron densities are mainly delocalized on the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units in the HOMO and LUMO for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, and the high level of overlap of the HOMO and LUMO is helpful to generate strong ICT effects in the molecules.35–38 Furthermore, the calculated HOMO energy level of FBT(IID-T)2 is lower than that of FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2, which is in agreement with the results of the CV instrument.

3.5. Hole mobilities
The hole-only mobility (μh) of the blend films is considered as an important parameter for the Jsc and FF of the related SM-OSCs.56 Herein, the μh of these SMs was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique in vertical hole-only devices. Under optimized conditions, the hole-only devices were fabricated with ITO/PEDOT:PSS (5000 rpm, 140 °C, 30 min)/SMs:PC71BM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (100 nm) structures, respectively.62 A photosensitive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating a solution of SM/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) in chloroform (CF) with 0.4% CN (CN/CF, v/v) on the PEDOT layer with a typical concentration of 10 mg mL−1 at room temperature, followed by CS2 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 20 s. The SCLC could be estimated using the Mott–Gurney equation.54,58 The J–V curve of the hole-only devices is shown in Fig. 6, and the calculated data are summarized in Table 3. Without SVA treatment, the μh of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 devices was estimated to be 1.50 × 10−5, 3.3 × 10−5 and 1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After treatment with CS2-SVA for 20 s, the improved μh of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 devices was calculated to be 7.39 × 10−5, 1.53 × 10−4 and 2.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Suggesting that CS2-SVA treatment can improve molecular ordering degree, obtain more ordered nano-fibrillar morphology, and improve the molecular stacking nature, which contribute to the improvement of μh in devices. Practically, FBT(TDPP-T)2 shows a higher coplanarity of the molecular backbone than FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2. These results demonstrate that the improvement of μh is responsible for the improvement in Jsc and FF parameters of the related SM-OSCs.58–62

3.6. Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of these SMs used as donor materials, OSCs were fabricated with a typical device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (5000 rpm, 140 °C, 30 min)/SM:PC71BM (2000 rpm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) and investigated under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The device area is 0.1 cm2 as defined with a shadow mask. The active layer of SMs/PC71BM was obtained from chloroform (CF) solution at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. As demonstrated, the photovoltaic performances of SMs are strongly affected by the processing parameters, and various D/A ratios, with SVA treatment and 1,8-diiodooctane (CN) additive concentrations of 0.2, 0.4 to 0.6 (%), and spin-coating rates were investigated to optimize the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Fig. S14–S19† show the J–V characteristics of the SMs:PC71BM-based devices at different CN additive concentrations and the results after CS2-SVA treatment for 20 s, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1–S6,† respectively (for details, please see the ESI†). As a result, the optimum conditions for the SMs:PC71BM-based devices are as follows: D/A ratio of 1:1, CN additive concentration of 0.4%, spin-coating rate of 2000 rpm, and then CS2-SVA treatment for 20 seconds to optimize the surface morphology of the active blends, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQE curves of the best SM devices are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively, and their corresponding photovoltaic data are also summarized in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 7a, without SVA treatment, the measured Jsc and FF values of the devices fabricated using FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 were 12.03/54.46, 12.54/57.06, and 14.61/61.75 (mA cm−2/%), respectively, and the PCEs of FBT(PyDPP-T)2-, FBT(IID-T)2- and FBT(TDPP-T)2-based cells were 5.04%, 5.65% and 6.86%, respectively. After the CS2-SVA treatment for 20 s, their corresponding devices exhibited significantly improved PCE values of 6.40, 7.78 and 9.00%, respectively. This large improvement in the PCEs could be due to the simultaneous increase of Jsc and FF values, and the Voc was basically kept at the same level. The results indicated that the elevated Jsc and FF values of the devices fabricated using FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 were 13.53/61.81, 14.74/67.26, and 16.14/73.52 (mA cm−2/%), respectively, which could be attributed to the much better film morphology formed in the active blend layer, facilitating effective charge carrier mobility.41,59 More excitingly, an impressive highest PCE of 9.00% along with a synergistically enhanced Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.52% was obtained for the FBT(TDPP-T)2 device, which may be ascribed to its better coplanarity, higher hole-only mobility and better morphology of the blend. To the best of our knowledge, such Jsc and PCE values are the best recorded compared to previously reported D(A–Ar)2-type SMs in single-junction SM-OSCs.33–45 Meanwhile, the FBT(TDPP-T)2-based device shows a smaller series resistance (Rs) and a larger shunt resistance (Rsh), which indicated that it has better exciton separation and less exciton recombination which is responsible for the improvement in Jsc and carrier mobility.44,59 The results provide a simple and valuable strategy through subtle changes and tailoring of the molecular structure and device engineering for developing highly efficient SM-OSCs.

To further confirm why the devices based on FBT(TDPP-T)2 exhibit better Jsc than FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2, the EQE curves of the devices with the SMs/PC71BM blend under the optimized conditions are measured and shown in Fig. 7b. The spectral response ranges of EQEs are covered from 300 nm to 740 nm for FBT(PyDPP-T)2/PC71BM, 300 nm to 760 nm for FBT(IID-T)2/PC71BM and 300 nm to 800 nm for FBT(TDPP-T)2/PC71BM films, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum EQE values of 73.3% at 602 nm, 76.5% at 641 nm and 78.4% at 659 nm are found for these devices based on FBT(PyDPP-T)2/PC71BM (1:1), FBT(IID-T)2/PC71BM (1:1) and FBT(TDPP-T)2/PC71BM (1:1) blend films after SVA treatment, respectively. Obviously, compared to the blend films without CS2-SVA treatment, an improvement in absorption intensity can be clearly seen in the blend films with CS2-SVA treatment. The Jsc dramatically improved from 12.03 to 13.53 mA cm−2 for the FBT(PyDPP-T)2:PC71BM cell, 12.54 to 14.74 mA cm−2 for the FBT(IID-T)2:PC71BM cell and 14.81 to 16.14 mA cm−2 for the FBT(TDPP-T)2:PC71BM cell, respectively. Meanwhile, the calculated Jsc values are 12.86, 14.25 and 16.02 mA cm−2 calculated from the EQE values for the FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 blend films, respectively, and obviously, the calculated Jsc values obtained by the integration of the EQE data for these devices matched well with the measured Jsc values from J–V assessments (within 5% error), which could explain why the FBT(TDPP-T)2:PC71BM device can achieve higher Jsc.44,57
3.7. XRD analysis and film morphologies
As is well known, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are used to further investigate the crystalline nature and molecular orientation in the solid state. The XRD patterns in the thin films of SMs were obtained to investigate the molecular interactions in detail and are shown in Fig. 8. The three SMs display distinct strong peaks around 6.5°, which are related to the distance between the planes of the main conjugated backbones separated by alkyl chains, indicating that these SMs possessed good crystallinity. Compared with FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2, the sharper 100 peaks of FBT(TDPP-T)2 indicate that it has the best crystallinity, and the results are consistent with the trend of the above DSC results. As shown in Fig. 8, FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 showed a strong peak at 2θ = 24.5°, 2θ = 24.3° and 2θ = 24.6°, respectively, which were ascribed to the (100) diffraction from a lamellar packing configuration. Furthermore, the corresponding π–π stacking distances (dπ) between the coplanar SM skeletons are also calculated to be 3.63 Å for FBT(PyDPP-T)2, 3.66 Å for FBT(IID-T)2 and 3.62 Å for FBT(TDPP-T)2, respectively. Obviously, FBT(TDPP-T)2 exhibited a much smaller dπ value in comparison with those of FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2, which indicated that the introduced TDPP unit effectively improved the π–π packing properties of FBT(PyDPP-T)2, thereby enhancing the carrier mobility. The results match well with the DFT theoretical calculations and the obtained μh values mentioned above, which is helpful to improve its Jsc and FF values in OSCs.45,59,62
 Fig. 8  XRD patterns of the pure SMs films on silicon wafers. 
Given the significance of the film morphology of the active blend in determining the device performance of OSCs, the surface morphologies of these SM blend films were recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in a surface area of 5 × 5 μm2 using the tapping mode. As shown in Fig. 9, for the pristine film without SVA treatment, the prepared FBT(PyDPP-T)2, FBT(IID-T)2 and FBT(TDPP-T)2 blend films all displayed a relatively smooth surface with average root mean square (RMS) roughness values of 1.62, 1.96 and 2.22 nm, respectively, indicating that all of these SMs have a good miscibility with PC71BM. After CS2-SVA treatment for 20 s, the blend films exhibit rougher surfaces with a slightly increased RMS of 2.03, 2.25 and 2.51 nm, respectively, which are similar to those of previous reports,25,68,69 and thus can form a well-interpenetrating network with clear donor–acceptor phase separation, which is in agreement with the characteristics of the optical properties of the blend films upon CS2 vapor annealing. Apparently, the solvent vapor annealing offers a driving force to afford domain growth, leading to more evident phase segregation between the donor and acceptor, and a more ordered film morphology of the active layer at the nanoscale, which would be conducive to reasonable improvements of both Jsc and FF values.25,68,69 Furthermore, the relatively excellent morphology is consistent with the better molecular ordering degree and enhanced μh mentioned above, resulting in a high PCE value.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a family of narrow-bandgap π-conjugated SMs with a D(A–Ar)2 linear framework based on FBT as the central core, coupled with various acceptor arms and 2-octylthiophene as terminal units, has been synthesized for BHJ-OSCs. The modification of axisymmetric electron-deficient acceptor groups furnished valuable parameters to tune charge transport, energy levels, and the morphology of the blend thin film, which had a critical influence on the device performance. The TDPP unit made FBT(TDPP-T)2 possess better molecular packing and higher mobility in comparison with those of FBT(PyDPP-T)2 and FBT(IID-T)2. The better PCEs, Jsc and FF values based on these SMs showed an apparent improvement upon SVA treatment in comparison with the values of the initial devices. Especially, an impressively improved PCE from 6.86% to 9.00% with an increase of 35% was obtained in the FBT(TDPP-T)2/PC71BM (w/w, 1:1) based devices after a SVA treatment for 20 s, which is about 1.16 and 1.40 times higher than those of FBT(PyDPP-T)2/PC71BM and FBT(IID-T)2/PC71BM based devices, respectively, which is the highest PCE and Jsc of solution-processed BHJ solar cells based on SMs with a D(A–Ar)2 framework reported so far. Obviously, this type of SM design strategy reported here indicates that the PCE of solar cells based on SMs can be dramatically enhanced via careful engineering of the molecular structure and optimization of the morphology of blend films.
