    , Accepted 18th December 2020First published on 19th December 2020AbstractThe effects of proton irradiation on the electrical and optical properties of hybrid perovskite photodetectors have been investigated in this paper. Our results reveal that no significant changes in the photoelectric properties of the perovskite photodetectors are observed when the proton fluence accumulates to 1 × 1012 p cm−2. However, with further increase of proton fluence, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the perovskite photodetectors begins to decrease notably. This can be attributed to the introduction of deep defect levels within the bandgaps of the CH3NH3PbI3 active layer and the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer after proton irradiation. Based on time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, the deep defect levels in the active layer behave as nonradiative recombination centers, resulting in a reduction of carrier lifetime. According to our first-principles calculations, the deep defect levels in the PCBM layer act as electron trap centers, leading to an accumulation of photo-generated electrons. Most interestingly, when the proton fluence reaches 1 × 1014 p cm−2, a transient inverse current in the perovskite photodetectors is observed after stopping illumination. This abnormal phenomenon is due to the accumulation and release of electrons trapped in the PCBM layer, which can diffuse to the perovskite active layer and form the inverse current.
1 Introduction
In recent years, photodetectors that convert incident light into electrical signal have been attracting great interest in both industrial and scientific applications, including image sensing,1 environmental monitoring,2 and chemical/biological detection.3 A semiconductor material absorbing incident photons and generating electron and hole pairs is an essential part of a photodetector and acts as an active layer. Until now, a large variety of semiconductor materials have been used in photodetectors including Si, GaAs, InP, and GaN. However, these materials are usually synthesized via relatively expensive and complex methods. Nowadays, a new class of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials with a formula of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) has attracted an explosive growth of interest in photoelectric fields, such as solar cells,4–6 photodetectors,7–9 light emitting diodes and laser diodes.10,11 With the unique features of long carrier lifetime and diffusion length,12 low density of defects and trap levels in bandgap,13 and high absorption coefficient,14 the organic–inorganic perovskites display excellent optical and electrical properties.15,16
Besides these advantages mentioned above, another exciting characteristic of organic–inorganic halide perovskite has been discovered that is they show much higher radiation hardness compared to Si, GaAs, and GaN materials.17–19 This suggests that photoelectric devices based on perovskites have a huge application potential in aerospace fields and radioactive pollution territories. Therefore, investigation of the radiation effects and mechanisms on perovskite thin films and devices has become a hot topic. Felix Lang et al. reported the radiation effects of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells exposed to high energy protons and found out that the post-irradiated perovskite active layer has a self-healing ability, making the solar cells withstand a proton dose of 1012 p cm−2,17 which is much higher than that of Si-based solar cells.20 Viktor V. Brus et al. pointed out that the electrical and photoelectrical properties of perovskite solar cells such as open circuit voltage, fill factor, and carrier lifetime are improved after high energy proton irradiation.18 The authors revealed that the point defects induced by proton irradiation in the Pb–I framework have shallow defect energy levels in bandgap and can compensate for carrier trap centers in the organic fragments in the perovskite material.18 These interesting discoveries demonstrate that novel radiation effects and mechanisms of perovskites deserve further in-depth research. A phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) thin film is an excellent electron collection material and is often used in perovskite photoelectric devices as an electron transport layer for the improvement of the device performance.12,14 Therefore, in addition to the perovskite active layer, the radiation effect of the PCBM layer also has a great impact on the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and solar cells. High-energy electrons and heavy ions have been employed to study the radiation effects of PCBM thin films.21,22 Seung Hwa Yoo et al. found out that bandgap of PCBM film increases after electron irradiation,21 whereas Trupti Sharma et al. reported that bandgap decreases after exposured to heavy ions.22 These results tell us that the organic material PCBM is sensitive to the type of irradiated particle, and different types of high-energy particles can introduce different defect structures within it.
Overall, to the best of our knowledge, most of the radiation effects and mechanism analyses are carried out on perovskite thin films and solar cells, but the investigation of radiation effects and radiation hardness evaluation of perovskite photodetectors are rarely reported. In addition, there is still a lack of a systematic analysis of the radiation effects on both the perovskite active layer and the PCBM electron transport layer in perovskite optoelectronic devices. Therefore, in this study, a low energy proton beam was employed to investigate the radiation effects and evaluate the radiation effect and hardness of a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite photodetector. Statistically, protons with energy between 50 and 200 keV have larger flux and damage levels than high energy protons23,24 so that 150 keV protons are chosen in our irradiation experiments. Stopping and Ranges of Ions in Matter (SRIM) software is used for the proton displacement damage and penetration depth simulation. The key figure-of-merit parameters of the photodetector, such as external quantum efficiency (EQE), responsivity (R), detectivity (D*) and transient photocurrent response are analyzed in detail with different proton fluences. Except for devices, the perovskite active layer and the PCBM electron transport layer are both irradiated at the same time to assist the radiation mechanism analysis of the perovskite photodetector. An abnormal photoresponse dynamics phenomenon of perovskite photodetector induced by irradiation is reported and explained by the band structure evolution of PCBM layer via first-principles calculations.
2 Experiments
2.1 Perovskite photodetector fabrication process
The glass substrates with indium tin oxide (ITO) were cleaned with detergent, deionized water and ethanol in an ultra-sonic bath (30 min for each step), respectively. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates were dried via nitrogen gas flow and further cleaned in a UV-Ozone cleaner for 10 min. After that, a thin layer (20 nm) of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios A1 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO surface and annealed at 120 °C for 20 min in air. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Afterward, the perovskite precursor solution containing PbI2 and CH3NH3I (1:1 molar ratio) was prepared in a mixed solvent of DMSO:γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (3:7, v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrates by two consecutive spin-coating steps at 2000 and 4000 rpm for 20 and 60 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, chlorobenzene (CB, 400 μL) was quickly dropped onto the rotating substrate to create CH3NH3PbI3 active layers, which had a thickness of about 300 nm. After drying the substrate at 100 °C for 5 min, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 50 nm) solution was spin-cast onto the perovskite layer at 1500 rpm. Then, the samples were transferred into a vacuum evaporation chamber. Finally, the layers of bathocuproine (BCP, 10 nm) and silver (Ag, 100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa to form the hole-blocking layer that can reduce the dark current in the photodetectors and the contact electrodes. The structure and energy band diagram of the perovskite photodetector are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively, where ITO is the anode, PEDOT:PSS is the hole-extraction layer, CH3NH3PbI3 is the active layer, PCBM is the electron transport layer, BCP is the hole-blocking layer and Ag is the cathode. The CB and VB in Fig. 1(b) represent the conduction band and the valence band, respectively.

2.2 Proton irradiation experiments
The proton irradiation experiments were carried out in a proton accelerator in Harbin Institute of Technology. The energy of proton particles was 150 keV. The irradiation area was 4 cm × 4 cm, and the whole perovskite photodetector can be covered by the proton beam during irradiation. The samples were irradiated in a vacuum accelerator chamber under 10−4 Pa at room temperature. No DC bias was added to the photodetector during proton irradiation, and the temperature rise in the chamber after irradiation was within 20 K, which had little effect on the photodetector. Three groups of perovskite photodetectors were chosen for the proton irradiation experiments. They were irradiated by proton beams with fluences of 1 × 1012, 1 × 1013, and 1 × 1014 p cm−2, respectively. A group of reference photodetectors kept in ambient N2 atmosphere during irradiation experiments were employed in our experiments for comparison with the irradiated ones so that we could exclude the variation of the samples caused by the intrinsic decay of the photodetector itself.
2.3 Photoelectric property characterization methods
EQE values of perovskite photodetectors were measured using a Zolix Solar Cell Scavan 100 measurement system. The light source employed in these measurements was a xenon lamp and the spectral resolution was 10 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these photodetectors under dark conditions were acquired by a Keithley 2400 source meter. The transient photocurrent response characteristics of photodetectors were measured using an oscilloscope Tektronix DPO 4104 with an input impedance of 50 Ω. In this test, the excitation source was a light-emitting diode with a photon wavelength of 525 nm, and the light-emitting diode was modulated by a function generator generating square waves with a frequency of 200 kHz. Steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the perovskite films and PCBM films were carried out using a FLS920 Fluorescence Spectrometer with excitation wavelengths of 433 and 405 nm, respectively. The transmittance spectra of the glass/ITO substrates were measured using PG2000 Pro Ideaoptics Spectrometer with an HL2000 light source. All of the measurements above were performed at room temperature in an ambient environment without any encapsulation.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 SRIM simulations of proton irradiation
The penetration depth and damage profile of the protons in the perovskite photodetector were estimated via SRIM simulations.25 The thickness and density of each layer listed in Table 1 were used to build the model of the photodetector. The proton beam with an energy of 150 keV was set to irradiate vertically from the Ag pad side. Fig. 2(a) shows the proton distribution in the perovskite photodetector, and displays that most of the protons were stopped in depth ranging from 1300 nm to 1800 nm. Since the total thickness of all the function layers (except the glass/ITO substrate) is only 480 nm, it can be concluded that most of the protons had penetrated the whole perovskite photodetector and were finally deposited into the substrate. Fig. 2(b) shows the simulated radiation damage of the protons in a photodetector. It is clear that although most of lattice damages occur in the glass substrate, a certain amount of vacancies in BCP, PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3 layers were induced by incident protons. In summary, based on the SRIM simulations, although the doping effect in the perovskite photodetector is negligible, the lattice damages in these function layers should be considered in the radiation effect analysis.

The glass/ITO in the photodetector functions as a transparent substrate that allows the light to pass through and access the function layer. To verify the effect of radiation-induced defects on the transmittance properties of the glass/ITO substrate, the transmittance spectra were measured, as displayed in Fig. 3. Our results demonstrate that compared with the transmittance spectrum of the reference glass/ITO substrate, almost no change is observed in the transmittance spectra of the irradiated ones. This suggests that the proton irradiation has almost no influence on the transmittance property of the glass/ITO substrate, so the degradation of the photodetector is not related to the glass/ITO substrate but is associated with the damage of the function layers in the photodetectors.

3.2 Radiation effects on external quantum efficiency (EQE), responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) of perovskite photodetector and related mechanisms
EQE, R and D* are critical parameters for characterizing the properties of the perovskite photodetector, which can be defined as follows.
EQE is defined as the ratio of the number of the charge carriers collected by the electrodes to the number of incident photons and evaluates the conversion rate from photons to charge carriers.26

R is the ratio of the photocurrent to the incident-light power and indicates the efficiency that a detector response to an optical signal. Using the EQE results, the specific responsivity R can be calculated according to R = EQE × q/(hν)(1)q is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant, and ν is the frequency of incident light.7,27

D* represents the weakest optical signal that the photodetector can detect, so the detectivity D* can be expressed as D* = R/(2qJd)1/2(2)where Jd is the dark current.12,27 In this study, Jd is set to be the current at the reverse voltage of −0.1 V.

Fig. 4 shows the EQE, R and D* spectra of the perovskite photodetectors with and without proton irradiation. The original spectra represent the results measured immediately after finishing the fabrication of the photodetectors, and the reference spectra display the results of the photodetectors kept in an ambient N2 atmosphere and measured after irradiation experiments. It can be observed that the EQE, R and D* spectral differences between the original photodetector and the reference photodetector are small, meaning that the perovskite photodetectors can remain stable for a period after preparation. The high stability of these photodetectors ensures that all variations in photodetectors can be attributed to the proton irradiation effects. The original data in other parts are not shown in this paper.
 Fig. 4  The variation of EQE (a), R (b), and D* (c) with the wavelength of the reference perovskite photodetector and the irradiated ones with proton fluences of 1 × 1012, 1 × 1013, and 1 × 1014 p cm−2. 

Fig. 4(a) shows the EQE spectra of the perovskite photodetectors with and without proton irradiation. It shows that the reference photodetector shows a high EQE value of about 80% in photon wavelength ranging from 375 to 760 nm. Only a slight decrease of the EQE occurs when the photodetector is exposed to the proton fluence of 1 × 1012 p cm−2, demonstrating that CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite photodetector has high radiation hardness. However, when the proton fluence reaches 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2, the EQE decreases sharply to about 30% and less than 10%, respectively. It is interesting to note that although the photoelectric conversion efficiency of photodetector degenerates as the proton fluence increases, the range of the absorption spectra shows almost no variation. Fig. 4(b) shows the responsivity spectra of these photodetectors. According to the definition of R, the variation tendency of R with proton fluence is consistent with the EQE. Fig. 4(c) shows the detectivity spectra of photodetectors according to the measurements of R and Jd. Different from the radiation hardness of EQE and R, the D* show obvious deterioration at the proton fluence of 1 × 1012 p cm−2, which is mainly caused by the increase of the Jd after irradiation. Overall, radiation hardness of the perovskite photodetectors is evaluated through the EQE, R and D* spectra with different proton fluences. Due to the different radiation sensitivities of the optical and electrical properties, EQE and R show higher hardness than D*.
To provide an in-depth understanding of the proton irradiation effects on perovskite photodetectors, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 active layers, and PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 active layers and PCBM electron transport layers were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Depending on our SRIM simulations, most of the atom displacement damages occurred in the active and electron transport layers, so we focus our attention on these two layers to reveal the radiation mechanisms of the photodetectors.
 Fig. 5  (a) XRD patterns of the reference CH3NH3PbI3 active layer and the irradiated ones with proton fluences of 1 × 1012, 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2; (b) PL spectra of the reference CH3NH3PbI3 active layer and the irradiated ones with proton fluences of 1 × 1012, 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2; and (c) PL spectra of the reference PCBM electron transport layer and the irradiated ones with proton fluences of 1 × 1012, 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2. 

Fig. 5(a) shows the XRD patterns of the pre- and post-irradiated CH3NH3PbI3 active layers. The typical diffraction peaks at 14.15°, 20.08°, 23.47°, 24.55° and 28.56° correspond to the (110), (112), (211), (202) and (220) planes of the tetragonal phase perovskite structure, respectively. By comparing the pre- and post-irradiated XRD spectra, we can see that there is almost no change in the peak position and full width at half maximum, indicating that the point defects introduced by proton irradiation have little effect on the whole perovskite crystal structure. For the CH3NH3PbI3 active layers in Fig. 5(b), the reference PL spectrum profile is good, but the PL intensities decrease by about 19.1% and 46.5% after being exposed to the proton fluences of 1 × 1012 and 1 × 1013 p cm−2, respectively. They are even totally quenched when proton fluence reaches 1 × 1014 p cm−2. For the PCBM electron transport layers in Fig. 5(c), two distinct PL peaks at 725 and 530 nm are observed. As reported, the lower energy photon emission at 725 nm corresponds to a bandgap of 1.7 eV and originates from an intramolecular transition in a PCBM molecule, while the higher energy photon emission at 530 nm corresponds to a bandgap of 2.3 eV and is coming from an intermolecular transition between PCBM molecules.28 After proton irradiation with fluences of 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2, the intensities of the two PL peaks decrease sharply at the same time, indicating that both intramolecular and intermolecular photon emissions are suppressed by proton beam irradiation. The deterioration of the PL spectra in the CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM layers imply the generation of lattice defects that can introduce deep defect levels within the bandgap. The deep defect levels induced should be one of the main reasons for the performance degradation of the photodetector. In addition, it is clear that deterioration level of PCBM (decreases by about 77.5% of the PL intensity at the proton fluence of 1 × 1013 p cm−2) is much more serious than that of CH3NH3PbI3. This should be attributed to the radiation hardness of the organic–inorganic halide perovskite and larger damage to PCBM under proton irradiation, which has been revealed by our SRIM simulation in Fig. 2(b).
To further explore the effects of proton irradiation on the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite active layers, the carrier ultrafast dynamics characteristic is analyzed by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. As shown in Fig. 6, the TRPL curves of CH3NH3PbI3 films at a constant detected PL wavelength of 770 nm are fitted by smooth double exponential curves, following the blow formula29,30 (3)where I(t) is the decayed PL intensity at time t, τ1 (τ2) represents the fast (slow) decay time, and A1 (A2) represents the amplitude of the fast-decay (slow-decay) component at t = 0. The fitted values of τ1 and τ2 are listed in Table 2. Since the nonradiative recombination process is much faster than the radiative process at room temperature, the fast decay time τ1 can represent the nonradiative recombination lifetime in the perovskite active layer. As shown in Table 2, the reference perovskite layer exhibits a long τ1 value of 26.29 ns. τ1 slightly reduces to 23.19 ns after 1 × 1012 p cm−2 proton irradiation, while it sharply decreases to 3.24 ns and 2.36 ns when exposed to proton fluences of 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2, respectively. These results give direct evidence of the generation of nonradiative recombination centers (NRCs) in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer due to the atom displacement damage.

3.3 Photoresponse characteristics of perovskite photodetectors
Transient photocurrent is an electrical signal converted from an optical signal by photodetectors. Observing the change of the transient photocurrent with irradiation fluences is an intuitive way to observe the performance variation of the photodetector. Fig. 7 displays the transient photocurrent density curves of the reference and irradiated photodetectors. It is well known that there are plenty of charged defect ions in the perovskite layer. Under external bias, these charged defect ions can move and form noise current. The noise current is the origin of the spikes as displayed in Fig. 7.31 Response time is an another important factor for evaluating the photodetector performance and reflects the response speed of a photodetector to the incident light. Generally, the response time of a photodetector is defined as7 τ = τrise + τfall(4)where the rise time τrise and the fall time τfall are defined as the time between 10% and 90% of the maximum transient photocurrent. For the reference photodetector, as shown in Fig. 7(a), the transient photocurrent density increases from 10% of the maximum value to 90% of the maximum value after a rise time of 420 ns. And after a fall time of 434 ns, the transient photocurrent density declines from 90% of the maximum value to 10%. Thus, the photodetector response time is 854 ns. Fig. 7(b) shows the transient photocurrent density curve of the photodetector after being exposed to 1 × 1012 p cm−2 proton irradiation. The transient current density waveform of the irradiated photodetector is consistent with the reference one, indicating that the irradiated photodetector can still work normally. However, the rise time (595 ns) and fall time (714 ns) of the irradiated photodetector increase, resulting in a longer response time (1309 ns) than that of the reference photodetector. This result tells us that the performance of the photodetector decreases slightly after 1 × 1012 p cm−2 proton irradiation.
 Fig. 7  Transient photocurrent densities of the perovskite photodetectors exposed to different proton fluences: (a) reference sample, (b) 1 × 1012 p cm−2, (c) 1 × 1013 p cm−2, and (d) 1 × 1014 p cm−2. 
The transient photocurrent density waveforms of the irradiated photodetectors change as the proton fluence increases, demonstrating a further deterioration of the photodetector, as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). The definition of the response time is no longer applicable in the highly irradiated photodetectors due to the variation of the transient photocurrent density waveform, so we do not consider it here. Under the irradiation fluence of 1 × 1013 p cm−2, the transient photocurrent density of the photodetector cannot maintain a stable value any more, but gradually decreases with the increase of the light time after reaching a maximum value. In particular, when the proton fluence reaches 1 × 1014 p cm−2, the transient photocurrent density is reduced from the maximum value to zero even under illumination, suggesting a failure of the photodetector. However, an abnormal phenomenon occurs under this irradiation fluence, that is, a reversed transient current is observed after stopping illumination, as shown in Fig. 7(d). This anomaly demonstrates that there are electrons in the photodetector that can flow from the PCBM layer to the perovskite layer after stopping illumination.

Fig. 8 shows the energy band and carrier transport evolution diagrams of the perovskite photodetector used to reveal the physical mechanism of the sharp degradation of the transient photocurrent density exposed to 1 × 1013 p cm−2 and 1 × 1014 p cm−2 irradiation fluences. Here, the first conduction band (1CB) and the second band (2CB) of PCBM and the irradiation induced deep defect levels in the first and second bandgaps are drawn in Fig. 8, which are used to explain the variation of the bands and the effects of the defect levels on the electron transport. The band structure diagram of the reference CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM layers is shown in Fig. 8(a). As the position of the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite layer is higher than that of the PCBM layer, photo-generated electrons in the perovskite layer can directly transfer from the perovskite conduction band to the PCBM conduction band, and then transport through the PCBM layer forming transient photocurrent. However, after high-fluence proton irradiation, the properties of the perovskite layer and PCBM layer are seriously degenerated. According to the analysis of the PL spectra, deep defect levels have been introduced into the bandgaps, as displayed in Fig. 8(b). These deep defect levels in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer play as NRCs, resulting in a reduction in the photo-generated carriers. As for the PCBM layer, they behave as electron trap centers (ETCs), leading to a degradation of the electron transport. Therefore, a decline in transient photocurrent is observed under illumination.
 Fig. 8  Energy band and carrier transport evolution diagrams of the perovskite photodetector. (a) Energy band and carrier transport diagram of the reference photodetector. The photodetector works normally under illumination. (b) Energy band and carrier transport diagram of the irradiated photodetector. Deep defect levels are introduced in the bandgaps of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and PCBM layer. They act as a nonradiative recombination center (NRC) and electron trap center (ETC) in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and PCBM layer, respectively. Part of electrons excited to the conduction band under light can transit to the valence band through NRC, reducing the number of photo-generated carriers. Some of the electrons transporting to the PCBM layer can be trapped by ETC, leading to a lift of the PCBM energy band. (c) Energy band and carrier transport diagram of the photodetector exposed to a high proton irradiation fluence. More deep defect levels are introduced into the bandgaps of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and PCBM layer, resulting in a further reduction of photo-generated carriers and a lift of the PCBM energy band. In this case, the energy band of the PCBM layer moves up to a higher position than that of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. (d) Energy band and carrier transport diagram of the photodetector exposed to a high proton irradiation fluence. In this situation, illumination is stopped, and electrons trapped in the deep defect levels in the second bandgaps of the PCBM layer can transfer to the CH3NH3PbI3 layer by tunneling the barrier and form a reversed transient current. 
In addition, it should be noted that with the accumulation of trapped electrons, the energy band of the PCBM layer is gradually lifted, as displayed in Fig. 8(b), so the barrier height between the PCBM layer and the perovskite layer gradually decreases, thereby reducing the probability of electron transition between the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and the PCBM layer. This is another factor that leads to the reduction of the transient photocurrent. With the increase of the radiation fluence, the number of trap centers in the PCBM layer increases, so the accumulation of the trapped electrons increases accordingly. Eventually, the CBM position of the PCBM layer can be lifted to a higher position compared to that of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, as shown in Fig. 8(c). In this case, a barrier is built for electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 layer to the PCBM layer. This is the reason why the transient photocurrent rapidly drops to zero during the illumination period at 1 × 1014 p cm−2 fluence. On the other hand, the higher CBM position of PCBM layer also demonstrates that the defect levels in its second energy gap become closer to the CBM position of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, so electrons captured on these defect levels can easily transit into the CH3NH3PbI3 layer after stopping illumination and form a reversed transient current displayed Fig. 8(d), which is observed in Fig. 7(d).
To verify the energy band variation of the PCBM layer under proton irradiation, dark current was measured under a positive bias as shown in Fig. 9. When the photodetector operates under a positive bias, electrons will transfer from the PCBM layer to the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The lifting of the conduction band of PCBM is beneficial for the electron transport. Fig. 9 shows that the dark current curves of the reference photodector and the irradiated photodectors with proton fluences of 1 × 1012 and 1 × 1013 p cm−2 have typical rectification character and can be divided into three distinct regions: leakage current regime at low voltages, and diffusion current regime and space charge limited current regime at high voltages.32 However, the rectification character of the photodetector disappears when the proton fluence reaches 1 × 1014 p cm−2 and an ohmic-like contact behavior forms. The ohmic-like contact character indicates that the barrier height between PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3 is small or disappears, further confirming the lift of the conduction band of PCBM. Accordingly, the assumption that the accumulated electrons can lift the energy band position of the PCBM layer is reasonable.

3.4 Radiation damage mechanism of PCBM material
As the radiation damage in the PCBM layer is one of the dominant factors for the degradation of perovskite photodetector and is also the origin of the reversed current under high irradiation fluence, first-principles simulations were employed to reveal the microscopic damage mechanism of the PCBM layer and give a deep insight into the deterioration of the perovskite photodetector.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)33 were used in these investigations. Projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were chosen to describe the electron–ion interactions34 and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parameterization method was used for the exchange–correlation function.35 As the PCBM crystal structure is stabilized by weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions,36 DFT-D3 damping parameters36,37 were used to describe the intermolecular interactions for the structure optimization and electronic structure calculations. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set is 600 eV and the structural relaxation is permitted until the force acting on each atom is less than 0.02 eV Å−1. The screened hybrid exchange–correlation functional HSE0638–40 was used in the electronic structure calculations so as to get an accurate band structure. The HSE06 mixing parameter was set to 25%.
A monoclinic crystal structure of PCBM, as shown in Fig. 10(a), was used in the calculations. The calculated lattice constants were a = 13.49 Å, b = 15.16 Å, c = 19.10 Å, and β = 107.12°, in good agreement with the previous theoretical values41 and the experimental values.42 Due to the large system of the PCBM structure consisting of 352 atoms, only gamma point in the Brillouin region was employed for the calculations. S. H. Yoo et al. reported that bonds between C and O in PCBM are easily broken under irradiation,21 and so defects, such as oxygen vacancy (VO) and methoxy radical vacancy (VOCH3), are introduced. Here, an oxygen atom (methoxy radical), as shown in Fig. 10(b), was removed to simulate the defect of VO (VOCH3).

Fig. 11(a) is the band structure of the ideal PCBM. The distance between the first conduction band minimum (the second conduction band minimum) and the valence band maximum in the band structure corresponds to the energy gap of 1.7 eV (2.7 eV), which is consistent with the bandgap of 1.7 eV (2.3 eV) measured by the PL spectra as shown in Fig. 5(b). The 1CB of PCBM is localized in the PCBM molecule, and electrons excited to these bands can transfer within the PCBM molecule through Frenkel exciton,28 as shown in Fig. 11(b). The 2CB of PCBM is more delocalized, and electrons excited to these states can make transitions between PCBM molecules through Mott–Wannier excitons,28 as displayed in Fig. 11(b), which is the main carrier transport mechanism in PCBM.

Fig. 12(a) is the band structure of the PCBM with a defect of VOCH3. It shows that VOCH3 introduces defect levels in both of the first and second energy gaps, labeled as A1 and A2, respectively. As the A1 and A2 defect levels are located above the Fermi level and unoccupied by electrons, they are acceptor levels. Additionally, because the positions of the A1 and A2 energy levels are near the middle of the bandgap, they are deep acceptor levels and can trap electrons. The optimized defective PCBM molecule with the defect of VOCH3 is the molecule displayed on the right side of Fig. 12(b) and (c). Because of the absence of the methoxy radical OCH3, one dangling bond occurs in the carbon atom which has a bond with the oxygen atom in OCH3 in an ideal crystal structure. After relaxing, the carbon atom forms a bond with one of the carbon atoms in the nearest PCBM molecule displayed on the left side of Fig. 12(b) and (c). Partial charge densities associated with the defect energy levels of A1 and A2 are also displayed in Fig. 12(b) and (c). With the connection between the defective PCBM molecule and the nearest ideal PCBM molecule, charge densities of the defect levels of A1 and A2 mostly distribute in the nearest ideal PCBM molecule. For the lower defect level A1, most of the charge density is localized in the region of the ideal molecule near the defect of VOCH3. For the higher defect level A2, most of the charge density is localized in the region of the ideal molecule far from the defect of VOCH3.
 Fig. 12  (a) Band structure of the PCBM with a defect of VOCH3. The green dashed line demonstrates the Fermi level. Partial charge densities associated with the defect levels A1 and A2 of VOCH3 in the bandgap at gamma point are displayed in (b) and (c), respectively. Both of the isosurfaces of the charge densities are 5.21 × 10−4 e Å−3. The optimized defective PCBM molecule (right) with the defect of VOCH3 and the ideal PCBM molecule (left) nearest to the defective PCBM molecule are both displayed in (b) and (c). 

Fig. 13(a) is the band structure of the PCBM with a defect of VO. It reveals that VO introduces a defect level in the first energy gap, which is labeled as D. Since the position of the level D is below the Fermi level and near the top of the valence band, it is a deep donor level and cannot trap carriers. The optimized defective PCBM molecule with the defect of VO is the molecule displayed on the right side of Fig. 13(b). Differently from the optimized structure of VOCH3, the carbon atom which has a bond with the removed oxygen atom in an ideal crystal structure does not form a bond with one of the carbon atoms in the nearest PCBM molecule displayed on the left side of Fig. 13(b). The charge density associated with the defect level of D is therefore localized around the defect itself, as shown in Fig. 13(b). Electrons occupying the energy level of D are distributed in this region.
 Fig. 13  (a) Band structure of the PCBM with a defect of VO. The green dashed line demonstrates the Fermi level. (b) Partial charge density associated with the defect level D of VO in the bandgap at gamma point. The isosurface of the charge density is 5.21 × 10−4 e Å−3. The optimized defective PCBM molecule (right) with the defect of VO and the ideal PCBM molecule (left) nearest to the defective PCBM molecule are also displayed in (b). 
From the above analysis, it can be deduced that the defect of VOCH3 is the origin of the electron trap center in PCBM. Electrons trapped on the defect levels of A1 and A2 cause the lift of the PCBM band position, resulting in a reduction in the barrier height between the PCBM layer and the perovskite layer. This will hinder the migration of electrons from the perovskite layer to the PCBM layer, resulting in a reduction in the photocurrent of the photodetector.
As discussed above, plenty of defects are introduced under high irradiation fluences, so a large number of electrons are trapped by defect levels of A1 and A2. In this case, the CBM of PCBM layer can be lifted to a position that is higher than that of the perovskite layer, and thus the defect level of A2 becomes closer to the CBM of the perovskite layer. Accordingly, it becomes easier for electrons trapped on the A2 level to transport to the conduction band of the perovskite layer and form the reversed transient current after stopping illumination, as observed in Fig. 7(d).
In summary, two kinds of defects, VO and VOCH3, are introduced in the PCBM layer under proton irradiation. VO has no effect on the properties of PCBM, while VOCH3 degrades the material properties. On the one hand, VOCH3 traps electrons in the PCBM layer and degrades the performance of the photodetector; on the other hand, after stopping illumination, electrons trapped on the defect level of A2 will jump to the perovskite layer and form a reversed transient photocurrent.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, the electrical and optical properties of hybrid perovskite photodetectors under different proton irradiation fluences are investigated. Organic–inorganic halide perovskite photodetectors show excellent radiation hardness under low-energy proton irradiation. A reversed transient current in the perovskite photodetectors is observed under a high proton fluence of 1 × 1014 p cm−2 when the light is turned off, which is induced by the accumulation and release of the electrons trapped by the irradiation-induced deep defect levels in the PCBM layer. A model coupled with the variation of the PCBM energy band and the carrier transport behavior is built to explain the origin of the reversed transient current. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of the irradiation response of hybrid perovskite materials and photodetectors.
