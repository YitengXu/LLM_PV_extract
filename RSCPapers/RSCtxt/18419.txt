Utilizing water-free ALD Al2O3 passivation, a minimum of ten-fold increase in stability against relative humidity (RH) 85% was achieved along with a dramatically improved thermal resistance (up to 250 °C). Moreover, we extend this approach to synthesize nh-TiO2 directly on hybrid perovskites to establish its potential in inverted photovoltaic devices as a dual stabilizing and electron accepting layer, as evidenced by photoluminescence (PL) quenching.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite halides have now proven their merit as high performance light absorbers due to their tunable gap, exceptional optoelectronic properties and simple processing.1–7 While still in its infancy, hybrid perovskite-based photovoltaics outperform a number of mature photovoltaic technologies in a lab setting with certified power conversion efficiencies as high as 20.1%.8
However, a significant challenge to the practical application of most hybrid perovskites remains. Specifically, the presence of hygroscopic ionic small molecules – alkylammonium cations – has been identified as a primary source of the absorber's notorious sensitivity towards moisture and temperatures above 150 °C.9–13 CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), for instance, rapidly degrades upon exposure to modest relative humidity at room temperature via:CH3NH3PbI3(s) → PbI2(s) + CH3NH3I(aq)
A related, but distinct, decomposition pathway is induced by heating above 150 °C even under an inert and dry environment, where methylamine14 and hydroiodic acid15 exist in the gas phase:CH3NH3PbI3(s) → PbI2(s) + CH3NH2↑ + HI↑
Various attempts have been made to improve system stability – modification of organic cation or halide chemistry,16–18 two dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites,19 and macroscopic encapsulation.20 While these measures may impede degradation processes the effect is often modest, transient, and adds device complexity. Synthetically-compatible, pinhole-free functional overlayers, in contrast, provide a simple route to surface chemical passivation as well as a physical barrier to diffusion in or out of the absorber. As such, integral/functional overlayers are expected to improve long-term stability as well as improve subsequent processing compatibility (e.g. processing environment, chemical compatibility) of hybrid perovskite-based devices for a wide range of applications.
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a chemically diverse vapour-phase deposition technique with the capability to synthesize ultra-thin and pinhole-free films with well-defined surface chemical control and precise physical thickness.21–23 The vast majority of oxide ALD processes24 invoke water (H2O), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or ozone (O3) as oxygen sources, often at temperatures equal to or greater than 150 °C. Unfortunately, these chemicals and temperatures are predicted to be in direct conflict with most hybrid perovskite halides and therefore appear to preclude the integrated overlayer approach. However, in this communication, we employ low temperature non-hydrolytic (i.e. waterless) ALD to establish stabilizing overlayers of Al2O3 or TiO2 directly on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) films. We demonstrate not only that oxide ALD conditions exist that are compatible with hybrid perovskite halides, but that the resulting systems exhibit dramatically improved stability against moisture (85% RH) and enhanced resistance to considerably higher temperatures (250 °C). We further demonstrate the capability of nh-TiO2 to serve a dual role – stabilizing the absorber underlayer and accepting electrons in future inverted photovoltaic devices. Moisture and thermal stability of non-hydrolytic Al2O3 (nh-Al2O3) passivated films are examined both in realistic and accelerated environments using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and spectroscopic techniques.
Mixed perovskite halide, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx), films were spin-coated on glass substrates by one step process in a nitrogen (N2) filled glove box as reported previously.18,25 Briefly, a 1:3 molar ratio of PbCl2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) mixture was dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The solution was then spin coated onto glass substrates followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. A representative optical image of an as-deposited MAPbI3−xClx is depicted in Fig. 1a. The samples indicate single phase MAPbI3−xClx in absence of perovskite halides of the form CH3NH3PbI2Cl, CH3NH3PbICl2 or more importantly, PbI2 in agreement with previous reports (Fig. 1e).9,12

Al2O3 was chosen as a model overlayer material, owing to its good barrier properties26,27 and precedence for passivation in thin film form.28,29 At least 21 distinct ALD processes are known for Al2O3,24 the most common of which involves reaction of trimethylaluminum (TMA) with either ozone (O3) or water (H2O). Although TMA is exceedingly reactive,30–32 we speculated that the oxidants would be most detrimental to the halide perovskite. Therefore, we first examined the stability of MAPbI3−xClx films at modest temperature under vacuum and under additional exposure to common ALD oxygen sources. As-deposited MAPbI3−xClx films were exposed to O3 and H2O (half ALD cycles only) in an ALD reactor at 100 °C. The amount of precursor delivered into the chamber was chosen to reflect realistic Al2O3 synthetic conditions, 100 × 0.015 s exposures for H2O and 100 × 0.75 s exposures for O3. Exposure to O3 quickly induces visible degradation of mixed halide hybrid perovskites to PbI2 (yellow), Fig. 1b. XRD analysis reveals a nearly complete decomposition to PbI2 and loss of all MAPbI3−xClx crystallinity (Fig. 1e). While H2O triggers a similar effect, changes in the optical constants are more subtle, suggesting only partial degradation. Indeed, a significant formation of PbI2 was observed, yet some MAPbI3−xClx crystallinity is retained under the brief and low-partial pressure exposure as verified by XRD (Fig. 1e). The effects of full ALD cycles (metal and oxygen sources) on MAPbI3−xClx films was also investigated to probe the extent to which metal/ligand half cycles may protect against subsequent exposures to O3 or H2O. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, samples exposed to TMA/O3 appear equally degraded by the naked eye. However, a closer look at the XRD data reveals an even more complete loss of film crystallinity (see also Fig. S1, ESI†). An analogous effect was observed with TMA/H2O and TTIP/H2O (TiO2), Fig. 1c. In contrast to the samples exposed to H2O alone, visible changes became more apparent, implying an accelerated process of degradation, perhaps attributed to local heating due to the strongly exothermic reactions that result from full ALD cycles of TMA and H2O.33,34 We note that the ALD of Al2O3 directly on hybrid perovskite halides using TMA and O3 has recently been reported, however, the formation of PbI2 is evident after a single full ALD cycle.35
In an attempt to avoid O3- or H2O-induced degradation, we developed a novel non-hydrolytic (nh) Al2O3 ALD process that is analogous to a previous report of nh-TiO2 growth.36,37 We substitute aluminum triisopropoxide (AIP) for titanium tetraisopropoxide, but retain acetic acid (AA) as the source oxygen. At 100 °C the controlled growth of Al2O3 occurs at a rate of ∼0.1 Å per cycle (Fig. S2, ESI,† full ALD variable space analysis will be published elsewhere). We observe that MAPbI3−xClx films exhibit remarkable resistance to at least 200 × 0.015 s exposures of acetic acid (Fig. 1d) at 100 °C. The halide perovskite remains single phase without visible transformation or measurable loss of crystallinity as revealed by XRD (Fig. 1e). Building on this observation, we performed nh-ALD full cycles with AIP/AA (Al2O3) and TTIP/AA (TiO2) on as-deposited MAPbI3−xClx films. Again, we observe no significant optical change that might reveal absorber degradation (Fig. 1d). A careful analysis of the XRD data reveal complete suppression of PbI2 formation without loss of hybrid perovskite halide crystallinity (Fig. 1e). Therefore, in contrast to the archetypal Al2O3 ALD processes (e.g. TMA/O3, TMA/H2O), nh-ALD provides an effective route to depositing oxide overlayers directly on mixed halide hybrid perovskites without damaging this sensitive underlayer.
The stabilizing effect of Al2O3 overlayers was investigated as a function of thickness with three sets of samples: unpassivated MAPbI3−xClx, 3 nm nh-Al2O3/MAPbI3−xClx, and 18 nm hb-Al2O3/MAPbI3−xClx (Table 1). As nh-Al2O3 is a relatively slow ALD process (∼0.1 Å per cycle), we employ a hybrid ALD (hb-ALD) process that utilizes both nh-ALD and subsequent TMA/H2O ALD to deposit an additional 15 nm of Al2O3. This approach allows for more rapid barrier layer growth without damage to the hybrid perovskite underlayer. Subsequently, 5 μL of water was drop-cast onto the three samples (Video S3, ESI†). The still images in Fig. 2 clearly reveal the extent to which the MAPbI3−xClx degraded after each sample is allowed 2 minutes in contact with liquid water. As expected, the unpassivated MAPbI3−xClx film degrades instantaneously upon contact with water.

 Fig. 2  Effect of 5 μL water droplet on MAPbI3−xClx thin films as a function of time. (a) and (b) correspond to t = 0 s and 120 s, respectively. 
Although slightly slowed, the 3 nm nh-Al2O3 passivated film still breaks down with seconds. The 18 nm hb-Al2O3 passivated film, in contrast, reveals no signs of degradation for at least 15 minutes. The resistance of a perovskite halide stack to liquid water has previously only been reported for a much thicker (ca. 200 nm) polymer film that doubled as metal-like current collector.38 The stack indicated no signs of visible degradation after exposure to a stream of running water for 15 seconds. Of course, the effects of a liquid water droplet are quite different from exposure to water vapour in the ambient and likely above and beyond the requirement for most applications. As such the effect of Al2O3 overlayers were also examined in a more relevant accelerated environment of 85% relative humidity (RH). As others have previously reported,10,39 we see unpassivated films visibly degrade under 85% RH at room temperature, revealing substantial decomposition in less than 12 hours (Fig. S4, ESI†). The 3 nm nh-Al2O3 and 18 nm hb-Al2O3 passivated films, however, remained stable for 24 and over 200 hours, respectively, demonstrating more than an order of magnitude improvement (18 nm hb-Al2O3) in moisture-resistance over the control. The visible assessment of film degradation was corroborated by XRD and UV-vis spectroscopy throughout the degradation process in 85% RH (Fig. S5, ESI†). While the 3 nm nh-Al2O3 passivated films eventually degrade upon prolonged exposure to RH 85%, the 18 nm hb-Al2O3 passivated films have yet to visibly degrade after 3 weeks. Even the best barriers will allow slow diffusion of small molecules including water. As such, it appears likely that these ALD overlayers also induce a level of surface chemical passivation that may lead to longer-term stability, especially if coupled with macroscopic device encapsulation. The extent of chemical interaction is currently under investigation in our lab.
A striking improvement in thermal stability of MAPbI3−xClx films was also observed with ALD Al2O3 stabilizing overlayers. Samples from the same set (Table 1) were annealed on a hot plate at 250 °C in a N2 filled glove box with H2O and O2 levels below 0.1 ppm (Video S6, ESI†). Upon heating, the unpassivated film begins visibly decomposing in ∼30 seconds, whereas the decomposition of the 3 nm nh-Al2O3 passivated film initiates around 1 minute. Remarkably, the 18 nm hb-Al2O3 passivated films exhibited 60× increase in thermal stability, remaining stable for at least 30 minutes prior to developing local regions of degradation (Fig. 3). To verify the extent of degradation, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and XRD measurements were performed on pre- and post-annealed samples (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). As can be seen in the FTIR spectra, characteristic vibrational modes of the methylammonium (CH3CH2+) ions in MAPbI3−xClx40 disappear in unpassivated films upon heating, which is in agreement with the reported mechanism of thermal degradation.12 In contrast to unpassivated films, passivated films retained CH3CH2+ ions in the structure throughout the heating process. These results were further verified by XRD measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†) performed after 70 s at 250 °C. In agreement with the FTIR results, the unpassivated films exhibit XRD peaks that suggest complete decomposition into PbI2, whereas the 3 nm nh-Al2O3 passivated films only showed partial degradation. Moreover, the 18 nm hb-Al2O3 remained as single phase MAPbI3−xClx confirming exceptional endowed thermal stability even at 250 °C. Although the primary role that the Al2O3 overlayers play in the high temperature stabilization of CH3CH2+ ions in MAPbI3−xClx remains unclear, we speculate that surface chemical passivation may again play a role in addition to inhibited diffusion of CH3NH2 and HI out of MAPbI3−xClx. Further investigation is currently underway to understand these mechanisms.

Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing nh-ALD for forming non-insulating overlayers with the potential to both stabilize the absorber and move charge, for example in photovoltaic applications with the well-known electron accepting material, TiO2. Here, nh-TiO2 was synthesized below or above MAPbI3−xClx films to examine extent of photoluminescence (PL) – a marker for electron acceptor behaviour in this system. In both configurations, proximal nh-TiO2 layers result in dramatic quenching of MAPbI3−xClx PL, Fig. 4. These studies provide the first steps toward hybrid perovskite photovoltaics with a metal oxide electron acceptor in a stable inverted cell geometry.

Conclusions
We have established a simple and effective approach to significantly improve the tolerance of hybrid perovskites to both moisture and temperature. A novel non-hydrolytic surface chemistry was introduced to grow ultrathin oxide barriers directly on hybrid perovskites without deposition-induced damage. Al2O3 passivated films reveal striking improvements in both moisture and thermal stability under accelerated aging environments, which we expect to provide enhanced durability in both future device use and device processing. nh-TiO2 overlayers further reveal the potential for integrated optoelectronic device application, including hybrid perovskite-based photovoltaics.
