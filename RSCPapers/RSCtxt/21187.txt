    , Accepted 19th March 2013First published on 5th April 2013AbstractWe explore the inter-relationship between the phase behavior and photovoltaic performance for two blend systems comprising poly(3-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as the electron donating moiety and two newly developed small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors. Binary non-equilibrium temperature/composition phase diagrams of the two systems are prepared from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of blends of different compositions. The phase behavior is correlated with the optoelectronic performance of corresponding binaries in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The thermal and optoelectronic blend characterization is supported with optical microscopy and specular X-ray diffraction (sXRD) experiments. For both electron-accepting compounds the composition yielding the maximum photocurrent generation in devices was found to be in the hypoeutectic regime, i.e. at compositions that are shifted from the eutectic towards the small molecule rich region in the phase diagrams. We demonstrate that measuring the thermal properties of the blends is useful for rapid component ratio optimization and the evaluation of unexplored materials combinations.
Introduction
Driven by the growing demand for inexpensive, flexible, and lightweight solar cells, solution processable organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have seen rapid progress in materials development,1–3 processing techniques,4–6 and device architectures.7–10 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells – in which an electron donating (p-type) and an electron accepting (n-type) organic semiconductor are blended into a bi-continuous active network – have shown particular promise in the past few years.8,11 In particular, a large variety of new OPV semiconductors compatible with solution processing have been developed and characterized. Although the main focus has been primarily on the synthesis of the electron donating components such as narrow optical gap (so-called “low-bandgap”) compounds,1,11,13–15 recent research has targeted the development of non-fullerene electron accepting counterparts.2,16–25 The reason for the development of the alternate acceptors is that the commonly employed fullerene derivatives have weak absorption in the red and feature relatively high electron affinities, often resulting in substantial energy losses (manifesting as reduced operational voltages).26 The main method for evaluating new materials and novel donor–acceptor combinations is to fabricate and test devices whereby the optimum blend ratio is determined empirically – this is an intricate and time-consuming procedure. One of the reasons that optimum compositions cannot generally be selected from the outset is the fact that in BHJ OPVs, the nano- and microstructure of the blend has a critical impact on the photovoltaic performance; particularly, the degree of phase separation between the individual components which evolves either spontaneously or is induced by post-deposition processing. The basic microstructural criteria for BHJs is to maximize the interfacial area between the donor and acceptor molecules for efficient exciton separation, without sacrificing the bi-continuous donor–acceptor charge transporting percolated network. The blend ratio is thereby one of the key means to manipulate the phases and thus the interface structure between the two components. Identifying the blend ratio range leading to the best photovoltaic performance before device fabrication would enable more efficient use of materials and a focus on processing protocols such as solvent, film fabrication techniques, and annealing. Müller et al. have reported such a rationale for optimal blend compositions based on binaries of poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) and fullerene derivatives such as the [6,6]-phenyl-C61(or C71)-butyric acid methyl esters (PCBMs). The materials combinations explored possessed simple eutectic phase behavior in which the optimum composition (the composition that gave the best device performance), copt, was in the hypoeutectic regime (with respect to the polymer), i.e. at compositions that are shifted from the eutectic towards the small molecule rich region in the phase diagram.12 The need for the best performing blend ratio to be hypoeutectic was attributed to the fact that it was necessary for the small molecule component to be at sufficient concentration to form primary crystals and percolating pathways for charge extraction.
In this current article we explore whether these observations on the inter-relationship of phase behavior, microstructure and photocurrent generation for the P3AT:PCBM blends is more general, and in particular is applicable to small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors. We have made a detailed investigation of bi-component blends comprising poly(3-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as the ‘electron donating’ species and two newly developed small-molecular compounds as the ‘electron accepting’ moieties. P3HT was selected as the p-type component, as its optoelectronic properties are well understood, thus allowing the extraction of the key properties of the binaries made with new n-type materials.27,28 The two acceptor molecules feature benzothiadiazole and dicyanovinyl units that impart a high electron affinity with structure differentiated by their solubilizing units; di-n-propylated dithienylsilole in the case of YF25 and di-n-propylated fluorene for K12 (chemical structures shown in the insert of Fig. 2a). Both YF25 and K12 have good solubility in common organic solvents, thus, allowing efficient blend processing from solution.29,30
Results and discussion
We first explored the phase behavior of the P3HT:YF25 and P3HT:K12 binaries. P3HT and the respective electron acceptor were co-dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene using different weight ratios to give varying blend compositions and films were formed by drop casting under ambient conditions. The completely dried films were then removed from the glass substrates and the thermal properties analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Binary non-equilibrium temperature/composition phase diagrams were constructed using the first heating thermograms of, respectively, neat components and blends of various donor–acceptor ratios (see Fig. 1a for the full complement of DSC thermograms). The first important result was that both systems featured a simple eutectic phase behavior in a similar way to the P3AT:PCBM blends. The eutectic temperatures (Te) and eutectic compositions (ce) were ∼202 °C and ∼60 wt% P3HT for P3HT:YF25, and ∼212 °C and ∼75 wt% P3HT for P3HT:K12 binaries, respectively. The lower values of Te and ce found for YF25 can be largely attributed to its lower melting temperature (Tm) compared to K12 [Tm(YF25) ≈ 212 °C; Tm(K12) ≈ 237 °C] (cf.Fig. 2a and DSC thermograms of neat YF25 and K12 in Fig. 3a).

(b) The second heating curves demonstrate relatively featureless thermograms for P3HT:K12 blends with a donor loading between ∼50 wt% and ∼75 wt%, indicating the formation of persistent amorphous solids in the respective composition regime (shaded area). For P3HT:YF25 blends a similar behavior was not observed. Thermograms of blends representing eutectic compositions are highlighted with bold lines and exothermic crystallization transitions in thermograms of hypoeutectic binaries are indicated with arrows.

Both systems feature simple eutectic phase behavior (P3HT:YF25, Te ≈ 202 °C, ce ≈ 60 wt% P3HT; P3HT:K12, Te ≈ 212 °C, ce ≈ 75 wt% P3HT). Te was determined from the peak eutectic transition temperatures and liquidus transitions corresponding to the end melting temperatures of neat compounds and primary P3HT, YF25 or K12 crystals, identified in the first DSC heating thermograms. Grey shaded areas indicate the composition range of optimum photovoltaic device performance. The composition regime where crystallization of P3HT:K12 binaries is hindered and persistent amorphous solids are formed is labeled “glassy”. For clarity, eutectic points are highlighted with arrows.

 Fig. 3  (a) DSC thermograms of neat YF25 and K12 and of two slightly hypoeutectic blends, i.e. P3HT:YF25 55:45 (ce ≈ 60 wt% P3HT) and P3HT:K12 70:30 (ce ≈ 75 wt% P3HT). Second heating thermograms of the neat compounds and the P3HT:YF25 binary feature an exothermic transition (arrows) followed by an endothermic (melting) transition at elevated temperatures. However, none of these features were observed for the P3HT:K12 blend, indicating the formation of a persistent glassy solid upon cooling from the melt, even at relatively moderate cooling rates of 10 °C min−1. (b) X-ray diffraction patterns of a P3HT:YF25 55:45 blend and P3HT:K12 70:30 binary. For both systems “as cast” layers were compared with films that were rapidly cooled from the melt, followed by a heat treatment at 80 °C for 20 min (“melt processed”). For the P3HT:YF25 binary the two diffraction patterns recorded exhibit clear signals from both blend components with increased overall crystallinity for the “melt processed” film, as seen by an additional YF25 second order signal around 15°. Diffraction patterns of the P3HT:K12 binary, on the other hand, only feature P3HT and K12 signals for “as-cast” films. Negligible reflections were observed for “melt processed” layers, reflecting the vitreous nature of the blend. 
The next step in the study was to prepare photovoltaic devices under identical conditions to enable correlation of the observed phase behavior of our two systems with their performance. The devices were comprised of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blended active layer/Al with the active layer spin coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The devices were fabricated under carefully controlled conditions in an inert environment glove box and were annealed at 65 °C for 20 min in the same atmosphere before the device performance was measured. Devices were tested under standard AM1.5G conditions (in an inert environment) as outlined in the Experimental section, with great care taken to maintain calibration and illuminate at the correct intensity. The P3HT:YF25 and P3HT:K12 blend solar cells featured a clear maximum in composition dependent short-circuit current densities (Jsc) as well as in power conversion efficiencies (PCE) (Fig. 2b and c). For the P3HT:YF25 binaries, optimum photocurrent generation with Jsc,max = 4.0 mA cm−2 and PCEmax = 0.99% was found for a P3HT loading of ∼42 wt%. Whereas the P3HT:K12 blends were optimal, with a Jsc,max = 2.4 mA cm−2 and PCEmax = 0.73% at a donor content of ∼33 wt% (the device results are averages over a minimum of 6 devices). Hence, for both systems the blend composition for optimum photovoltaic performance was found to be in the hypoeutectic regime with respect to P3HT, i.e. in a composition range where the P3HT content (c) is <ce, analogous to the behavior of the P3AT:PCBM binaries.
To understand why the eutectic point occurs at a higher P3HT concentration in the blend with K12 relative to YF25, and yet the P3HT:K12 devices require a greater weight percent of the small molecule to reach optimum performance, it is necessary to consider the microstructures formed during blend solidification. Binaries of hypoeutectic compositions (relative to the polymer) form so-called primary crystals of the acceptor component when cooled from the homogeneous liquid (L) below the liquidus temperature to the two-phase region comprised of L and the solid acceptor; i.e. L + SYF25 (or L + SK12) (Fig. 2a). During cooling, the remaining liquid becomes poorer in acceptor content and the composition of L shifts toward the eutectic point. Once the eutectic temperature, Te, is reached, upon further cooling, the P3HT and small molecules that remain in the liquid phase, in thermodynamic equilibrium, solidify simultaneously, forming a fine grained (eutectic) microstructure.31–34 Accordingly, the resulting solid SYF25 + SP3HT (or SK12 + SP3HT) contains primary crystals of the small molecule electron acceptor (formed in the L + SYF25 or L + SK12 regime) surrounded by a fine-grained eutectic structure. These primary crystals are critical for device performance. In an active layer processed from hypoeutectic blend compositions, the interconnected primary crystals of YF25 and K12 support the percolation of electrons in the acceptor phase and, hence, the formation of a bi-continuous donor–acceptor network for balanced charge transport and extraction at the electrodes. Note that the P3HT donor phase is not dependent on the presence of primary crystals, as the polymeric nature of this species provides percolation even at very low polymer content.35 The fine-grained eutectic structure, on the other hand, provides a large interfacial area between the two components, resulting in effective exciton separation.
Turning now to the specific cases discussed here: for the P3HT:YF25 binary mixture the shift between the eutectic point and the optimum blend composition for best device performance is about 18 wt%, which is within the range found for the P3AT:PCBM blends.12 In contrast, the gap between ce and copt of about 42 wt% in the P3HT:K12 blends is considerably larger. The phase diagrams do not feature any characteristics which provide information regarding the different behavior found for the two binaries explored. In addition, both neat electron acceptors display very similar thermal behavior, as indicated by the DSC thermograms presented in Fig. 3a. Both, YF25 and K12 exhibit clear endothermic signals in the first heating thermograms, representing their melting transitions; a relatively featureless first cooling curve, indicating the formation of largely amorphous solids upon cooling from the isotropic melt; and in their second heating run show a Tg, followed by an exotherm indicating re-crystallization in the solid state, and finally, an endothermic melting transition at elevated temperatures. Therefore, the phase behavior of the single acceptor constituents seem not to account for the anomalous shift found between ce and copt in the P3HT:K12 blends. However, a key observation is that the DSC data shows that on the first cooling there is a strong tendency of the neat acceptor materials to form glassy solids. In a two-component system, this effect is likely to be enhanced, as each of the blend components can disrupt the packing of the other.
To understand the nature of the glassy state of the binaries of P3HT with K12, we performed a simple diffusion experiment with the two donor–acceptor systems. In this experiment a small piece of P3HT was placed in the melt of the respective small molecule and the two components were allowed to mutually diffuse into each other for about 5 min. After rapidly cooling to room temperature using a metal surface, the films were annealed at 80 °C for 20 min. The optical micrographs in Fig. 4 represent the whole range of compositions, spanning from 0 to 100 wt% P3HT. A clear observation is that each compound significantly affects the others crystallization, which is visible by the distinctly reduced crystal size found over a large range of blend compositions. Most importantly, in terms of our understanding of the difference between the P3HT:YF25 and P3HT:K12 binaries is that the latter features a composition regime that yields a largely amorphous solid. That is, in this region the crystallization process of both components (see arrows in Fig. 4) is suppressed. To confirm the observation made in optical microscopy that some of the P3HT:K12 binary compositions can form a persistent glassy solid at particular ratios, we undertook DSC studies on solution processed blends of slightly hypoeutectic compositions, i.e., P3HT:K12 and P3HT:YF25 with ratios of 70:30 and 55:45, respectively (Fig. 3a). Both blends show very similar features in their first heating and cooling thermograms, i.e., endothermic transitions representing the melting of the eutectic phase and of primary crystals on heating and a relatively featureless behavior on cooling. However, in the second heating curves there are distinct differences; for the P3HT:K12 70:30 blends no exothermic or endothermic transitions are found while for the P3HT:YF25 55:45 binary and for the neat acceptor components there are distinct transitions (Fig. 3a). In fact, vitrification of the P3HT:K12 blends is observed over the composition range from ∼50 to ∼75 wt% P3HT (see Fig. 1b). Clearly, the formation of a crystalline microstructure in this range is significantly hampered once the two blend components have been brought into an intimately mixed and vitreous state, as is typically induced by high solidification kinetic processes such as spin coating or (rapidly) cooling from the melt. Finally, the formation of glassy solids in melt processed slightly hypoeutectic P3HT:K12 binary compositions was also confirmed by specular X-ray diffraction (sXRD) experiments. In these investigations, a drop cast P3HT:K12 70:30 film was formed and analyzed by sXRD. The film was then heated to a homogeneous melt, rapidly cooled, and then annealed at 80 °C for 20 min before conducting a second sXRD measurement. It can be seen in Fig. 3b that the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as cast films feature distinct signals for P3HT and K12, but after melt processing negligible reflections were observed, reflecting their glassy characteristics and limited tendency to crystallize. The sXRD diffraction patterns of the as cast P3HT:YF25 55:45 blend shows a similar structure to the P3HT:K12 film. However, after undergoing the same thermal history there are still reflections, demonstrating the absence of persistent glass formation in this system. Furthermore, there are higher order signals for YF25 indicating that the melt processed P3HT:YF25 binaries feature increased overall crystallinity as compared to their as cast counterparts. For the interpretation of the sXRD results it is important to note that we have assumed the fraction of out-of-plane oriented crystals in the orientation distribution was identical for each of the samples studied.
 Fig. 4  Optical micrographs [unpolarized (top)/polarized (bottom)] of (a) P3HT:YF25 and (b) P3HT:K12 composition gradients. Films were fabricated by placing a small piece of P3HT (right-hand side of the image) in the melt of the respective small molecule (left-hand image side) and the compounds were allowed to mutually diffuse into each other. To interrupt the diffusion process, films were then quenched to room temperature and annealed at 80 °C for 20 min. As the blend components are miscible in the liquid phase (cf. phase diagrams in Fig. 2a), the presence of P3HT strongly influences the resulting microstructure of the electron acceptors and vice versa. Most remarkably, the P3HT:K12 system features a composition regime where the formation of a crystalline microstructure is strongly hampered, resulting in a largely amorphous, i.e. non-birefringent, interval (arrows). For P3HT:YF25 binaries, in contrast, such an effect is absent. Note that the concentration gradient between P3HT and the small molecule acceptors might not be linear. The polarizer/analyzer system is indicated with white arrows. 
Clearly, the formation of vitreous solids (glasses) in the hypoeutectic composition range of ∼50 and ∼75 wt% of P3HT in P3HT:K12 blends means that at these concentrations it is not possible to establish a crystalline percolation in the electron acceptor network. To achieve this it is necessary to have the K12 content to be adjusted to higher loading levels where crystallization is less hindered. Based on our thermal analysis data and eutectic phase diagrams this occurs at compositions where c < 50 wt% P3HT. Assuming that the formation of the primary acceptor crystals begins to occur at a K12 content of around 50 wt% (as indicated by DSC second heating thermograms in Fig. 1b), and given that copt for both the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:YF25 is shifted by about 10 to 20 wt% from the point of primary crystal formation (in these two cases it is the eutectic point), one would have predicted ipso facto that the optimum blend ratio for the P3HT:K12 ratio for device performance would be located between 30 and 40 wt% P3HT – fitting the observed experimental maximum found at copt = 33 wt% P3HT (Fig. 2) and illustrating that understanding of the phase behavior assists in identifying the optimum composition range for device performance from the outset.
Summary and conclusion
In summary we have demonstrated the inter-relationship between phase behavior and photovoltaic performance for two blend systems comprising P3HT as the electron donating moiety, and small molecule non-fullerene compounds as the electron acceptors. For both binaries the composition yielding a maximum photocurrent generation was found in the hypoeutectic regime, i.e. at compositions c < ce. For P3HT:YF25, the shift between the optimum blend ratio and the eutectic composition is similar to that established for P3AT:PCBM binaries. In contrast, the P3HT:K12 blend features a considerably larger interval between ce and copt, which has been shown to be due to the formation of a persistent P3HT:K12 glassy solid over a range of hypoeutectic compositions with respect to P3HT starting at the eutectic point of the mixture. Our work enables a rapid focus on the ratio range that will give the best performance. Although there can be variations in performance within that range, the method provides a rapid determination of the sweet spot in terms of device output, advancing the evaluation of unexplored materials combinations for high performance OPVs.
Experimental
Materials
2-[{7-(4,4-Di-n-propyl-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithien-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl}methylene]malononitrile (YF25) and 2-[(7-{9,9-di-n-propyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl}benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)methylene]malononitrile (K12) were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.29,30 Poly(3-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) ( = 94100 g mol−1, regio-regularity ∼96%) was purchased from Merck Chemicals, United Kingdom.
Sample preparation
Blended films for thermal analysis and specular X-ray diffraction were prepared by co-dissolving P3HT and the respective electron acceptor in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mg ml−1 total content) at 100 °C, followed by drop casting and solvent evaporation at ambient conditions.
Concentration gradients of P3HT:YF25 and P3HT:K12 for optical microscopy studies were prepared by placing ∼1.5 mg of the respective small molecule and a small grain of P3HT on a glass substrate. The materials were then covered with a microscopy cover slide and the assembly heated to 240 °C for P3HT:YF25 and 250 °C for P3HT:K12, respectively. Mutual diffusion of the two components into each other was promoted at the same temperatures for about 5 min. Subsequently, the resulting layers were quenched to room temperature using a metal surface and then annealed at 80 °C for 20 min.
Pre-etched ITO substrates for bulk heterojunction device fabrication were purchased from Kintec and cleaned in a 90 °C warm Alconox solution. Subsequently, the substrates were scrubbed with a soft cloth followed by sequential ultrasonication in Alconox, de-ionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol. After drying the substrates under a nitrogen flow, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophne):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P VP Al 4083) film was spin-coated at 8000 rpm. The resulting 30 nm thin layer was baked at 180 °C for 20 min in air. Stock solutions of P3HT, YF25 and K12 (15 mg ml−1 each) were prepared in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and mixed by blending P3HT:YF25 and P3HT:K12 in various ratios. The active layers were spin-coated in a nitrogen atmosphere onto the pre-treated substrates at 1000 rpm for 25 s and immediately covered with a Petri dish until dry. Subsequently, films were annealed at 65 °C for 20 min. Finally, 80 nm thick aluminum electrodes were thermally deposited under a vacuum of ∼10−6 mbar. The resulting device active area was 0.2 cm2.
Thermal analysis
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted under a N2 atmosphere at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 with a PerkinElmer® Pyris Diamond DSC. For analysis of neat materials and dried blend films, ∼5 mg of the material was sealed in aluminum crucibles. Eutectic transitions were taken to be the peak maxima in respective thermograms, whereas liquidus transitions correspond to the end melting temperatures of the neat materials and binaries.
Optical microscopy
Transmission optical microscopy was carried out with an Olympus BX61 polarizing microscope.
Specular X-ray diffraction
Specular X-ray diffraction (sXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Diffraction patterns were recorded using a θ/θ reflection geometry with an angular range between 2° and 30°, an angular resolution of 0.02° per step and a typical counting time of 2 s per step.
Photovoltaic device characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were acquired in a N2 atmosphere using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The simulated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) illumination was provided by an Abet Sun 2000 Solar Simulator. The intensity used throughout was 1000 W m−2 as determined by an NREL-calibrated silicon reference cell.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) first heating thermograms of P3HT:YF25 (left) and P3HT:K12 (right) blends employed for the construction of binary non-equilibrium temperature/composition diagrams (Fig. 2a). (b) The second heating curves demonstrate relatively featureless thermograms for P3HT:K12 blends with a donor loading between ∼50 wt% and ∼75 wt%, indicating the formation of persistent amorphous solids in the respective composition regime (shaded area). For P3HT:YF25 blends a similar behavior was not observed. Thermograms of blends representing eutectic compositions are highlighted with bold lines and exothermic crystallization transitions in thermograms of hypoeutectic binaries are indicated with arrows.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Binary non-equilibrium temperature/composition diagrams of P3HT:YF25 (left) and P3HT:K12 (right) blends fabricated by co-dissolving the components in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, followed by solvent evaporation at room temperature. Both systems feature simple eutectic phase behavior (P3HT:YF25, Te ≈ 202 °C, ce ≈ 60 wt% P3HT; P3HT:K12, Te ≈ 212 °C, ce ≈ 75 wt% P3HT). Te was determined from the peak eutectic transition temperatures and liquidus transitions corresponding to the end melting temperatures of neat compounds and primary P3HT, YF25 or K12 crystals, identified in the first DSC heating thermograms. Grey shaded areas indicate the composition range of optimum photovoltaic device performance. The composition regime where crystallization of P3HT:K12 binaries is hindered and persistent amorphous solids are formed is labeled “glassy”. For clarity, eutectic points are highlighted with arrows. L denotes the homogenous liquid phases and SP3HT, SYF25 and SK12 solid phases of P3HT, YF25 and K12, respectively. (b) Short circuit current densities and (c) power conversion efficiencies as a function of the corresponding blend composition. Data points and error bars in (b and c) represent the average and standard error of several devices. Chemical structures of the small-molecular electron acceptors are presented in the insert of (a). Dashed lines are drawn as a guide to the eye only.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) DSC thermograms of neat YF25 and K12 and of two slightly hypoeutectic blends, i.e. P3HT:YF25 55:45 (ce ≈ 60 wt% P3HT) and P3HT:K12 70:30 (ce ≈ 75 wt% P3HT). Second heating thermograms of the neat compounds and the P3HT:YF25 binary feature an exothermic transition (arrows) followed by an endothermic (melting) transition at elevated temperatures. However, none of these features were observed for the P3HT:K12 blend, indicating the formation of a persistent glassy solid upon cooling from the melt, even at relatively moderate cooling rates of 10 °C min−1. (b) X-ray diffraction patterns of a P3HT:YF25 55:45 blend and P3HT:K12 70:30 binary. For both systems “as cast” layers were compared with films that were rapidly cooled from the melt, followed by a heat treatment at 80 °C for 20 min (“melt processed”). For the P3HT:YF25 binary the two diffraction patterns recorded exhibit clear signals from both blend components with increased overall crystallinity for the “melt processed” film, as seen by an additional YF25 second order signal around 15°. Diffraction patterns of the P3HT:K12 binary, on the other hand, only feature P3HT and K12 signals for “as-cast” films. Negligible reflections were observed for “melt processed” layers, reflecting the vitreous nature of the blend.	 

 	Fig. 4  Optical micrographs [unpolarized (top)/polarized (bottom)] of (a) P3HT:YF25 and (b) P3HT:K12 composition gradients. Films were fabricated by placing a small piece of P3HT (right-hand side of the image) in the melt of the respective small molecule (left-hand image side) and the compounds were allowed to mutually diffuse into each other. To interrupt the diffusion process, films were then quenched to room temperature and annealed at 80 °C for 20 min. As the blend components are miscible in the liquid phase (cf. phase diagrams in Fig. 2a), the presence of P3HT strongly influences the resulting microstructure of the electron acceptors and vice versa. Most remarkably, the P3HT:K12 system features a composition regime where the formation of a crystalline microstructure is strongly hampered, resulting in a largely amorphous, i.e. non-birefringent, interval (arrows). For P3HT:YF25 binaries, in contrast, such an effect is absent. Note that the concentration gradient between P3HT and the small molecule acceptors might not be linear. The polarizer/analyzer system is indicated with white arrows.
