    , Accepted 6th April 2022First published on 7th April 2022AbstractHalogenation has been proved to be one of the most efficient chemical modification strategies to manipulate the energy levels and molecular assembly, while the study of the positional effect of halogen atoms for the polymer donor is limited. In this work, we systematically synthesized three wide bandgap polymer donors 35EH, 23EH and 26EH with 3,5-, 2,3-, and 2,6-difluorobenzene groups in conjugated phenyl side chains, respectively. The controlled positions of the two fluorine atoms in conjugated side chains induced different steric hindrances in three polymer donors which significantly affected the optical bandgap, energy level, surface energy as well as the crystallization behavior. Due to the smaller steric hindrance and good crystallinity, polymer 35EH achieved high performance in polymer solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 11% when paired with acceptor IT-4F. Furthermore, by varying the alkyl side chain on the difluorobenzene to siloxane-terminated alkyl side chain, three relevant polymer donors named 35Si, 23Si and 26Si were synthesized. The introduction of the siloxane-terminated alkyl chain effectively enhanced the aggregation of 35Si and decreased the domain size in the blend film. As such, the 35Si:IT-4F based PSCs displayed the best PCE of 12.97%. Our work reveals that the combinatorial strategy of optimal difluorination and the siloxane-functionalized side chain could provide an effective pathway to modify the polymer properties for efficient photovoltaic application.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) as one of the third generation solar cells have attracted considerable attention owing to their advantages such as simple solution processing, light-weight, as well as potential application in large area, transparent or flexible devices. Nowadays, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the binary and ternary PSCs reach 18%,1–3 benefiting from the reasonable design of donor and acceptor materials and the modified fabrication method for devices. For conjugated polymers composed of alternating donor and acceptor units, the tunable chemical structure of the building block can manipulate the optical absorption bands, molecular energy levels, as well as the three-dimensional molecular conformations. Many strategies have been developed to fine-tune the molecular structure of the polymer donors for high efficiency PSCs, such as terpolymerization of D–A polymers with different donor or acceptor building blocks as the third component,4 the introduction of heteroatoms in the polymer backbone,5–15 variation of the category or the length of the alkyl side chain16–18 and introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents on 2-dimensional conjugated side chains.19,20 In 2016, the 3,5-difluorobenzene group was introduced as the 2-dimensional conjugated side chain on the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit to compose a polymer donor (PTFBDT-BZS) by Bo et al. for the first time.21 The fluorine substitution of the alkylphenyl conjugated side chain effectively reduced the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and modified the molecular conformation. Ying et. al further constructed a high-performance polymer donor P2F-EHp with the 3,5-difluorophenyl substituted BDT unit and imide-functionalized benzotriazole (TzBI). By finely tuning the morphology of the photoactive layer, the single-junction device based on P2F-EHP:Y6 achieved a high PCE of over 16%.22 Although difluorination has been successfully introduced into high-performance photovoltaic materials, the positional effect of the fluorine atoms in the difluorobenzene side chain has not been investigated.
The siloxane-terminated side chain facilitates the formation of the optimal film morphology, and the preferential face-on orientation of the polymer chain, resulting in well-balanced charge carrier mobility of the blend films.23–30 Since 2011, the siloxane-terminated side chain has been widely investigated to induce face-on orientation for several conjugated polymers to achieve high performance ambipolar OFETs.26,31–33 As the face-on orientations of the polymer donor and acceptor are crucial to improve device performance, it is desirable to develop new photovoltaic material systems with the siloxane-terminated side chain for high performance PSCs.34–37 Moreover, both the theoretical calculation and the experimental methods have proved that the introduction of a certain amount of siloxane-terminated side chains into the polymer donors can efficiently decrease the surface energy of the corresponding polymers which provides a driving force for controlling bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology by manipulating the miscibility between the polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors.38,39 Therefore, the siloxane-terminated side chain modification is an effective way to further optimize the blend morphology including crystallization behavior and phase separation. So far, improved photovoltaic performances have been observed in many classical material systems such as PTB7-Th,38 PTQ10,40 J52,41 PDCBT-Cl,39 N2200,35 and FBT-Th4(1,4)36 by precisely introducing a certain number of siloxane-terminated side chains. However, the synergistic effect of the siloxane-terminated side chain and difluorobenzene group has not yet been disclosed.
In this study, three new polymer donors derived from the difluorobenzene substituted BDT and benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) units were designed and synthesized. By changing the fluorination position of the phenyl side chain, we examined the effects of the 3,5-, 2,3-, and 2,6-difluorobenzene side chains on the properties of the corresponding polymers 35EH, 23EH, and 26EH, respectively. We also replaced the alkyl side chain of the BDT unit with the siloxane-terminated alkyl side chain, resulting in three relevant polymers named 35Si, 23Si, and 26Si, respectively. The polymer donors of different difluorobenzene side chains exhibited gradually decreased HOMO energy levels, from −5.46 eV for 35EH, to −5.49 eV for 23EH, and then to −5.62 eV for 26EH. Furthermore, the polymer donors exhibited different aggregation behavior in solution and different absorption ranges in the solid state. 26EH and 26Si polymer-based devices exhibited the lowest photovoltaic performances, while the devices based on 35EH and 35Si achieved the highest PCEs. Eventually, the PSC device based on polymer 35Si displayed the best PCE of 12.97% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 20.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.58%.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of the six polymers and the non-fullerene acceptor (3,9-bis(1-oxo-2-methylene-3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-n-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3d:2′,3′d′]-s-indaceno[1,2b:5,6b′]dithiophene) (IT-4F) are shown in Chart 1 and the detailed synthesis procedures of the monomers and polymers are described in Scheme 1. The six difluorobenzene substituted intermediates were synthesized through the lithiation of the difluorobenzene groups, and then reacted with the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione, followed by the reduction of SnCl2. For direct comparison, EH, ET and Si represented the alky, ethenyl-terminated and siloxane-terminated alky side chains, respectively, and the relative positions of two fluorine atoms on benzene were marked according to the 3,5-, 2,6- and 2,3-substitutions. The regioselective formation of anionic species for 2EH, ET and 3EH, ET probably caused by the synergistic effect of the ortho–para directing groups (both the alkyl side chain and the halogen atoms) and the steric hindrance of the alkyl side chain. Compounds 4Si, 5Si and 6Si with two siloxane-terminated solubilizing chains were obtained in good yields of >90% by the hydrosilylation of the terminal alkene with 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane in the presence of the Karstedt catalyst (Scheme S1, ESI†). Finally, all the monomers were obtained by lithiation and the subsequent reaction with chlorotrimethyltin. The chemical structures of the various difluorobenzene substituted intermediates were fully characterized and confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Fig. S2–S13, ESI†). The polymers were synthesized through the Stille polymerization of the new bis(trimethylstannane) monomers (M1EH, M2EH, M3EH, M1Si, M2Si, and M3Si) and 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (M4). The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent (Table S1, ESI†). All newly synthesized polymers showed good solubility in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The thermal properties were measured by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S14, ESI†). As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), the six polymers could demonstrate excellent thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures between 430–452 °C.

2.2 Photophysical properties
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in CB solutions and solid films are shown in Fig. 1. For the three polymers with ethylhexyl (EH) side chains on the difluorobenzene units, the different fluorination positions show different impacts on aggregation behavior of the films (Fig. 1a). Specifically, the 35EH solution shows two prominent absorption peaks at 566 and 606 nm, respectively (Table 1). For the 23EH solution, the two peaks slightly blue-shift to 560 and 600 nm, respectively. However, 26EH solution exhibits only a broad single peak at 520 nm. As such, it is implied that closer difluorination to the polymer backbone may decrease the aggregation tendency, which remained in the film absorption. After replacing the alkyl with the siloxane-terminated alkyl of 2D conjugated side chain, the aggregation tendency is strengthened, as evidenced by the two well-reserved peaks in all the polymer films (Fig. 1b). Additionally, derived from the film absorption onsets, the polymers 35EH, 23EH and 26EH express extended optical bandgaps (Eoptgs) of 1.89, 1.90 to 1.91 eV, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the trend is generally inherited by their siloxane-terminated alkyl substituted counterpart polymers as the Eoptgs of 35Si, 23Si and 26Si are 1.89, 1.89 to 1.95 eV, respectively.

The temperature-dependent absorption spectra of the solutions were measured to deeply investigate the aggregation behavior of the polymers in dilute CB solutions. As shown in Fig. 2, when the temperature of polymer solution was elevated from 20 to 100 °C with an interval of 10 °C, the intensity of the absorption peak at ∼610 nm for 35EH and 23EH were gradually reduced. Different from the variation of absorption spectra for 23EH solution, in the absorption spectrum of 35EH solution at 100 °C there still remains a distinct shoulder peak at long wavelengths, which can be ascribed to the strong aggregation as well as the strengthened intermolecular interaction. Moreover, for 35Si solution, the relative intensity of the 0–0 peak is increased at room temperature, demonstrating the increased polymer aggregation in solution caused by the introduction of the siloxane-terminated side chains which has been observed in other polymer systems.36 However, for 23EH and 23Si, the polymer aggregation in solution is decreased after introducing the siloxane-terminated side chain in the BDT moiety, implying that the siloxane-terminated side chain may disturb the intermolecular interaction of adjacent polymer segments in solution. In addition, both 26EH and 26Si solutions exhibit no shoulder peaks in the absorption spectra, demonstrating negligible aggregation of the polymers in solution. These results reflect that the difluorination of different positions can lead to different aggregation behaviors in solution, which may provide a driving force to control the morphology.

2.3 Electrochemical and charge carrier mobility
The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed for determining the HOMO energy levels of the polymers (Fig. S15, ESI†). From the CV results, the HOMO energy levels of 35EH, 23EH and 26EH correspond to descending values of −5.46, −5.49 and −5.62 eV, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). After introducing the siloxane group, the HOMO energy levels are up-shifted to −5.37, −5.37, and −5.57 eV for 35Si, 23Si and 26Si, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for the polymers are calculated from the HOMO levels and Eoptgs (Table 1). Moreover, the ionization potentials (IPs) of polymers were determined through photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements (Fig. 3b). The estimated IP values confirm the validity of CV results (Table 1). It should be noted that the larger IP values measured for polymer donors 26× should translate into higher VOC values in BHJ solar cells. To evaluate the positional effect of the fluorine atoms in difluorobenzene side chains on the charge mobility of the polymers, we measured the hole mobility of the pristine polymer films in hole-only devices by space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S16, ESI†). The calculated hole mobilities (μh) of the polymer films are listed in Table 1. With the position of the fluorine atoms closer to the main chain, the hole mobility of the pristine polymer film was decreased from 2.77 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1 for 35EH to 1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 23EH and then to 1.80 × 10−5 cm2V−1 s−1 for 26EH. With the introduction of the siloxane-terminated side chain, the hole mobility of the corresponding polymer is slightly increased, and a similar tendency is also observed because the mobility is decreased from 3.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 35Si to 1.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 23Si and then to 4.41 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 26Si.

2.4 DFT calculations
To investigate the molecular geometries of the different positions of difluorinated polymers, we performed density functional theory (DFT) analysis with the B3LYP (6-31G (d,p)) basis set. As shown in Fig. 4, the dihedral angles between difluorinated phenyl groups and BDT central core gradually increased from 58.59° for 35F to 61.03° for 23F and then to 65.05° for 26F as illustrated by blue arrows. The planarity of the polymer along the side chain direction gradually becomes worse as the position of the two fluorine atoms move close to the BDT core. Furthermore, the dihedral angles between the BDT unit and the adjacent thienyl unit is 8.34° for 35F, 10.00° for 23F, and 14.59° for 26F as marked by the red arrows. Combined with the side view of the repeating unit, it is clear that the planarity of the polymer skeleton is getting worse from 35F to 26F. We speculated that the different difluorinations of the phenyl side chains may become an important feature that influence the aggregation state of the polymers in solution and solid films, especially for polymer 26EH and 26Si. In detail, the closer substitution of the fluorine atoms increases the steric hindrance and enlarges the torsional degree of the polymer skeleton. The DFT results well explain the aggregation behaviors that are illustrated by UV-vis absorption.

2.5 Molecular packing of neat polymer films
The grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to investigate the crystallinity and molecular orientation for the pristine polymer films. The patterns and the line-cut profiles are illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. S17 (ESI†), and the summarized average parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). In the pristine film, 35EH exhibited preferential face-on packing orientation with a (100) peak located at 0.280 Å−1 on the in-plane (IP) direction, and a (010) peak located at 1.723 Å−1 on the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to the lamellar stacking distance of 22.43 Å and π–π stacking distance of 3.64 Å, respectively. Similar peaks, with decreased intensities, can also be observed in the 23EH-based pristine film, which demonstrates the decreased crystallinity. Moreover, there are no distinct peaks in the 26EH-based pristine film, implying quite poor crystallinity. As illustrated by DFT simulation, the severe steric hindrance effect of the side chain along with a large torsional degree of the polymer skeleton is detrimental to polymer crystallinity. Furthermore, the GIWAXS patterns of 35Si, 23Si, and 26Si are shown in Fig. 5d–f and all the three polymers showed a dominant face-on orientation. The locations of the (100) peaks on the IP direction for 35Si and 23Si and (100) peaks on the OOP direction of 35Si are slightly decreased compared with the alkyl side chain substituted polymers, which is a common variation for polymer donors with a siloxane-terminated side chain.38,42

2.6 Surface energy of the neat polymer and IT-4F films
To predict the influence of different difluorinations of the phenyl side chains on phase separations of the polymer:IT-4F based blend films, we calculated the surface energy (γ) of polymers 35EH, 23EH and 26EH and acceptor IT-4F according to the Wu model by measuring the contact angles of water and diiodomethane on their pristine films (Fig. S18, ESI†). The calculated data are listed in Table 2. Obviously, γ values firstly decreased from 37.41 mJ m−2 for 35EH to 35.99 mJ m−2 for 23EH and then increased to 41.64 mJ m−2 for 26EH. It may be ascribed to the different difluorination positions of the phenyl side chains and the degree of face-on arrangement that influence the exposure of fluorine atoms to the surface of the pristine polymer films. Furthermore, the surface energies of 35Si, 23Si, and 26Si were calculated by measuring the contact angles of water and ethylene glycol. As listed in Table S3 (ESI†), all polymers exhibited reduced surface energy after the introduction of the siloxane-terminated side chain which was similar to the trend observed before.38–42 The γ of the IT-4F film (44.13 mJ m−2) was also determined for comparison. The dimensionless Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χD,A) has been used to evaluate the miscibility of organic components in BHJ blend films. The estimation for χD,A can be derived using the empirical equation χD,A = , where K is a constant while γD and γA are the surface energies of the polymer donor and small molecular acceptor films, respectively. As listed in Table 2, the χD,A values of the blend films increased from 0.277 K for the 35EH:IT-4F based blend film to 0.414 K for the 23EH:IT-4F based blend film and then dramatically decreased to 0.036 K for the 26EH:IT-4F based blend film. The results suggest that the 23EH:IT-4F blend film should possess the largest phase separation, and the 26EH:IT-4F blend film may achieve the best miscibility. Consequently, different substitution of the fluorine atoms on phenyl side chains of the polymer donor can strongly influence the miscibility between the polymer and the acceptor, which could be used to fine tune the BHJ morphology.

2.7 Photovoltaic properties
The PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:IT-4F/MoO3/Al. For device optimization, we firstly focused on the devices based on polymer 35Si due to its best planarity. The J–V plots and corresponding parameters of the as-cast devices using different acceptors are shown in Fig. S19 and Table S4 (ESI†), and the 35Si:IT-4F based devices exhibit the best PCEs compared with the devices based on other acceptors. Subsequently, the D:A ratio of 35Si:IT-4F based devices was found to be 1:1, and the optimal efficiency was obtained by changing the volume of the additive DIO and the post-annealing temperature. The J–V plots are shown in Fig. S20 and S21 (ESI†) and the related photovoltaic parameters are listed in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†). In this regard, the devices based on other polymers were fabricated under the optimal conditions of the 35Si:IT-4F based device with 0.5% of DIO, and under the thermal treatment at 110 °C for 10 min. The J–V plots of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 6a, with their corresponding photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 3. The 35EH-based devices yielded a decent PCE of 11.56% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 19.89 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.21%. The 23EH-based device produced a much worse PCE of 6.46% mainly due to a lower JSC of 18.08 mA cm−2 and a lower FF of 42.44%. Even though the 26EH-based device owns a high VOC of 1.07 due to its deeper HOMO, the extremely poor JSC of 2.81 mA cm−2 and FF of 25.25% lead to the worst PCE of 0.76%. Moreover, the introduction of a siloxane-terminated side chain largely improves the JSC and FF of the 35Si-based device, showing the best PCE of 12.97%. However, there is only a slight enhancement for the 23Si-based device with a PCE of 6.93%. In contrast, the PCE of 26Si-based device drops to 0.31%. To unveil the differences in JSC, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded accordingly. As presented in Fig. 6b, the 23EH- and 23Si-based devices displayed a similar high photoresponse from 500 nm to 800 nm. In addition, the photoresponse of the 23EH-based device at 300–500 nm exhibited a shoulder peak at 460 nm, and the peak moved to 390 nm for the 23Si-based device corresponding to their absorption spectra in neat films. Furthermore, the 35EH- and 35Si-based devices exhibit higher EQE values in the range of 550–800 nm, contributing to the enhanced JSCs. Whereas, the photoresponse of the 26EH- and 26Si-based devices are much weaker with the EQE values of only 10–15%. Even with the huge differences in the photoresponse, all the JEQE (calculated from the EQE spectra) values match well with the values obtained from the J–V curves.

To study the differences in the photovoltaic properties, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded to evaluate the exciton generation and charge transfer between the donors and acceptors. All the neat and blend films were excited at different wavelengths of light, according to the film absorption of the polymers and IT-4F. As shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†), the PL quenching efficiencies from the polymer to the acceptor were calculated to be 92.7% and 96.2% for 35EH- and 35Si-based optimized blend films, which is higher than other blend films, demonstrating more effective electron transfer from the polymer to IT-4F in 35EH:IT-4F and 35Si:IT-4F blend films.13 Whereas the quenching efficiencies from the acceptor to donor were also calculated to be 98.2% 95.2% 98.4%, and 95.4% for 35EH-, 23EH-, 35Si- and 23Si-based optimized blend films, respectively, indicating effective hole transfers from IT-4F to the polymers. Due to the insufficient HOMO level offsets between the IT-4F and polymers, the 26EH- and 26Si-based blend films exhibited a lower quenching efficiency of 32.1% and 20.9%, respectively, suggesting weak hole transfer for the corresponding excitons. The results demonstrated that the blend films based on 35EH and 35Si could effectively transfer charges between the donor and acceptors, and the negligible charge transfer between the donor and acceptor in the 26EH and 26Si based blend films may become a nonnegligible reason for their low photovoltaic performances.
To understand the influence of the different difluorination of the phenyl side chains for these polymers on the exciton dissociation process in blend films, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the 35EH, 23EH, 35Si, and 23Si based devices was measured (Fig. 7a). The Jph is defined as Jph = Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage.34 For the optimized polymer:IT-4F based devices, the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat) at a bias voltage of 2 V for 35EH, 23EH, 35Si, and 23Si based devices and at 5 V for 26EH and 26Si based devices, suggesting that all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free carriers and collected by the electrodes. Moreover, the Jph of the 35EH- and 35Si-based devices reach the saturation state much faster than other devices, indicating more efficient charge transport and collection in the active layer. The exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) can be estimated from the Jph/Jsat ratio under short circuit conditions, which are 90.3%, 79.8%, and 15.2%, for 35EH-, 23EH-, and 26EH-based devices, and it decreases with the position of the fluorine atoms from to the polymer skeleton. After introducing the siloxane-terminated side chain, the P(E,T) of 35Si- and 23Si-based devices are slightly increased to 94.5% and 80.0%, corresponding to their improved photovoltaic properties. While, the 26Si-based device gets the lowest P(E,T) of 6.6%, indicating the terrible exciton dissociation in the active layer. To explore the effects of different side chains of polymer donors on the recombination mechanism involved in the devices, we measured the dependence of VOCversus different illumination intensities (Plight). The relations of VOC on light intensity can be described as VOC ∝ Sln(Plight), where the slope S can be used to estimate the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the devices. The trap-free carrier recombination is predicted to have a kT/q dependence on light intensity.37 As shown in Fig. 7b, the slopes of polymer:IT-4F based devices under optimal conditions were 0.98kT/q and 1.01kT/q for 35EH- and 35Si-based devices. With the change in the side chains of the polymer donors from 3,5-difluorobenzene to 2,3-difluorobenzene, the 23EH- and 23Si-based optimized devices achieved higher slopes of 1.09kT/q and 1.22kT/q. Moreover, the slopes are finally increased to 5.00kT/q and 4.93kT/q for 26EH- and 26Si-based devices as the position of the fluorine atoms moved to the second and sixth position of the phenyl side chain. The trap-assisted recombination is well suppressed in the 35EH- and 35Si-based devices consistent with their large JSC.

We measured the carrier mobilities of the blend films under the optimized condition. As shown in Fig. S23, S24 (ESI†) and Table 4, the 35EH- and 35Si-based blend films exhibited high and balanced hole and electron mobilities with a small μh/μe of 1.43 and 1.13, respectively, corresponding to their high JSCs and FFs. On the other hand, the 23EH- and 23Si-based blend films exhibited decreased hole and electron mobility and higher μh/μe of 9.17 and 4.23, respectively, demonstrating the unbalanced charge transfer and lower FFs in the devices. Furthermore, the dramatically decreased hole mobility for 26EH- and 26Si-based blend films further confirmed the miserable charge transfer from the acceptor to the polymer donor, which is probably due to the unmatched energy levels and the terrible intermolecular interactions between the polymer donor and small molecular acceptor.

2.8 Film morphology analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to further probe the morphology of the active layers. As shown in Fig. 8, the 35EH:IT-4F blend film exhibited fibril-like domains with the largest root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 3.24 nm, the 23EH:IT-4F blend film exhibited a smaller RMS of 1.34 nm, and the further decreased RMS of 1.23 nm is presented in the 26EH:IT-4F blend film. This result may attribute to the enhanced crystallinity of polymer 35EH. Furthermore, the variation of the alky side chain from the siloxane-terminated alkyl side chain slightly decreases the roughness of the 35Si:IT-4F blend film (2.45 nm). A similar variation can also be observed from the TEM images (Fig. 9). The 23EH:IT-4F blend film exhibited the heterogeneous phase separation with the biggest bulk domain among the three blend films, corresponding to the poor compatibility between the polymer donor and acceptor revealed by the largest χD,A value. The 26EH:IT-4F blend film shows uniform surface morphology, demonstrating the best miscibility between the polymer and acceptor. While the 35EH:IT-4F blend film achieved the medium bulk domain. After introducing the siloxane-terminated alkyl side chain, the 35Si:IT-4F blend film displays improved phase separation with obviously decreased domains size. In the literature, nanoscale fibril-like bicontinuous phase separation is the prerequisite for achieving efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.43 Therefore, the favorable morphology of the 35EH:IT-4F and 35Si:IT-4F films lead to good photovoltaic performance in devices. The insufficient phase separations were formed in the 26EH:IT-4F and 26Si:IT-4F blend films, corresponding to the poor photovoltaic performance of their devices.

In addition to phase separation, photovoltaic performance of a BHJ PSC also closely correlates with the crystalline structures of the active layer. Thus, GIWAXS characterization was carried out for the polymer:IT-4F blend films to reveal their structure orders. The GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding line-cut profiles are depicted in Fig. 10 and Table S4 (ESI†). In detail, for the 35EH:IT-4F blend film, both the polymer and acceptor exhibited good crystallinity with distinct diffraction peaks. IT-4F exhibited a preferential face-on orientation according to an IP (100) peak at qxy of 0.322 Å−1 and an OOP (010) diffraction peak at qz of 1.770 Å−1, corresponding to the lamellar and π–π stacking distances of 19.50 and 3.50 Å. While 35EH exhibited similar diffraction peaks with the pristine film with a strong IP (100) diffraction peak at a qxy of 0.280 Å−1 and an OOP (100) diffraction peak at a qz of 0.305 Å−1, corresponding to the lamellar stacking distances of 22.43 and 20.59 Å, respectively. For the 23EH:IT-4F blend film, the weak diffraction peaks of IT-4F can still be observed, while the diffraction peaks of 23EH can hardly be recognized, probably due to the decreased intermolecular aggregation of the polymer. And for the 26EH:IT-4F blend film, no distinct peaks can be observed, attributed to the torsional polymer skeleton of 26EH which further destroys the crystallinity of both the polymer and the acceptor. Moreover, when replacing the alkyl side chains with siloxane-terminated alkyl side chains, the 35Si:IT-4F blend film displayed a much stronger IP (100) peak at a qxy of 0.202 Å−1, and an OOP (100) diffraction peak at a qz of 0.225 Å−1 with the calculated lamellar stacking distances of 31.09 Å and 27.91 Å, indicating the formation of a stronger bimodal packing orientation for the polymer molecule. And for the acceptor, a distinct IP (100) peak at a qxy of 0.324 Å−1 and an OOP (010) diffraction peak at a qz of 1.821 Å−1 was observed, corresponding to the decreased lamellar and π–π stacking distances of 19.38 and 3.45 Å. For the 23Si:IT-4F blend film, the OOP (010) peak was weakened, probably leading to a decrease of charge mobilities as listed in Table 4. The results demonstrated the improved crystallinity of both the polymer donor and acceptor in the 35Si:IT-4F blend film, which is beneficial for the charge mobility in the BHJ films, and supports the best photovoltaic performance of the 35Si:IT-4F based PSCs.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we systematically investigated the influence of different difluorination positions of the phenyl side chains for BDT-based polymer donors 35EH, 23EH and 26EH. DFT calculations and temperature dependent UV-vis absorption spectra demonstrated that the different difluorination positions of the phenyl side chains can significantly influence the planarity as well as the aggregation behavior of the polymers (in the order of 35EH > 23EH > 26EH). Moreover, the HOMO energy levels of the polymer donors gradually decreased as the fluorine atoms move closer to the BDT central core but resulted in an increased optical bandgap. Among the three polymers, the 35EH:IT-4F based device showed the highest PCE of 11.56% due to increased JSC and FF. Furthermore, when the alkyl side chains of 35EH were changed to the siloxane-terminated alkyl side chains, the morphology of the blend films could be further modified and resulted in higher JSC and FF. As a result, the PSC devices based on the polymer 35Si exhibited the highest PCE of 12.97% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 20.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.58%. Our results suggest that such a combinatorial strategy of difluorination and the siloxane-functionalized side chain is an effective pathway to modify the polymer properties for efficient photovoltaic applications.
