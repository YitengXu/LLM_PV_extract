    , Accepted 5th June 2018First published on 6th June 2018AbstractSolar-driven production of chemical fuels through photocatalysis holds great promise for addressing the ever-increasing energy and environmental issues. However, its practical application is limited due to low light harvesting efficiency, fast charge recombination, and low stability of current photocatalysts. Here, we introduce a high-performance solar energy conversion platform constructed by the intimate coupling of two different complementary semiconductors (MoS2 and CdS) and morphology-controlled plasmonic metal nanocrystals (concave cubic Au nanocrystals) in a controlled manner. The sequential Au nanocrystal anchoring and CdS growth on two-dimensional exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets successfully yielded intimately coupled plasmonic metal–semiconductor ternary hybrids. The prepared hybrid photocatalysts exhibited superb hydrogen evolution capability under visible-light irradiation, which can be attributed to the synergistic integration of the advantages of semiconductor–semiconductor coupling, such as the broadening of light absorption and the retardation of charge recombination, and plasmon energy transfer from Au nanocrystals to semiconductors via the hot electron transfer mechanism.
Introduction
The development of photocatalysts to efficiently convert solar energy to chemical fuels is receiving increasing attention because of the demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources.1–5 Nanostructured semiconductor materials are typical photocatalysts that have been commonly used in a variety of photocatalytic reactions, including the generation of hydrogen by water splitting6–8 and the production of hydrocarbon fuels by CO2 reduction.9–11 However, despite recent advances that have improved the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor materials through control over their surface structure, crystal structure, and shape,12–14 the inherent limited light harvesting efficiency and rapid charge recombination of semiconductor photocatalysts15 still hamper their practical use in a wide range of applications.
To overcome the drawbacks of semiconductor photocatalysts, numerous approaches have been proposed. One promising strategy is to produce hybrids of two different types of semiconductors.16–18 Distinct from single-component semiconductors, two-component semiconductor hybrids constructed from a combination of semiconductors with complementary band structures can broaden the optical absorption range, thereby effectively increasing light harvesting efficiency.19,20 Furthermore, the finely controlled valence band (VB)/conduction band (CB) alignment of hybrids can lead to efficient charge separation and migration, resulting in the retardation of electron–hole recombination.21,22 On the other hand, the incorporation of plasmonic metal nanocrystals (NCs), such as Au NCs, into semiconductors to generate metal–semiconductor hybrids has also proved to be effective for improving photocatalytic performance due to strong interaction with resonant light via the excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of plasmonic metal NCs.23–25 Highly amplified near-fields around plasmonic NCs and plasmon-induced hot electrons in NCs resulting from resonant excitation can be transferred to the semiconductor domains of metal–semiconductor hybrids, which in turn boost the light harvesting efficiency of the semiconductor.26–29 Given that the characteristics of plasmon energy formed from the LSPR excitation of plasmonic NCs are highly sensitive to the morphology of NCs,30–32 control over the morphology of metal NCs in metal–semiconductor hybrids can give a promising opportunity to further enhance the solar energy conversion efficiency. For instance, the employment of shape-controlled Au NCs with multiple high-curvature sites, such as vertices and edges, in the formation of metal–semiconductor hybrids could result in great enhancement in photocatalytic performance because plasmon energy is highly concentrated around the high-curvature sites of NCs, the so-called “hot spots”.33 Besides, to fully exploit the plasmonic functions of metal NCs, intimate coupling between constituent materials in plasmonic metal–semiconductor hybrid photocatalysts in a controlled manner is of paramount importance.33–36
Based on these previous findings, we inferred that ternary hybrid photocatalysts constructed by the intimate coupling of two different complementary semiconductors and morphology-controlled plasmonic metal NCs in a controlled manner can enable the synergistic integration of the advantages of semiconductor–semiconductor coupling and plasmon energy transfer from metal NCs, thus leading to prominent solar energy conversion efficiency. However, the realization of such ternary hybrids is a highly challenging task due to tremendous difficulties in controlling both the manner of coupling between constituent materials and the shape of plasmonic metal NCs. Although there have been a few reports on the preparation of ternary hybrid photocatalysts consisting of metal NCs and two different types of semiconductors, such as TiO2–CuO–Cu, ZnS–(CdS/metal), and CdS–Au–TiO2 photocatalysts,37–39 metal NCs have been embedded in hybrids for the transfer of charge carriers between two semiconductors or the promotion of surface reactions as a co-catalyst rather than for plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis. Furthermore, roughly spherical or irregularly-shaped metal NCs have been employed, which cannot allow the full exploitation of plasmon energy in photocatalysis. Therefore, the development of a rational synthetic strategy to generate ternary plasmonic metal–semiconductor hybrids with precisely controlled topologies will pave a new way to design advanced photocatalyst systems.
Here, we report a noble synthesis route toward the fabrication of ternary plasmonic metal–semiconductor hybrids with a combination of two complementary semiconductors and shape-controlled Au NCs with multiple sharp surface sites and demonstrate their great potential for efficient solar energy conversion. For the construction of ternary hybrids, CdS and mechanically exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 nanosheets (e-MoS2) were selected as semiconductor components. Since CdS can effectively absorb visible-light due to its band gap energy (Eg) of 2.4 eV (ref. 40 and 41) and the position of its CB edge is more negative than the potential of hydrogen evolution by water splitting, it has been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, CdS photocatalysts suffer from photo-corrosion and rapid charge recombination during photocatalysis, which severely deteriorate their catalytic function. Apparently, the introduction of MoS2, for which Eg is 1.2–1.8 eV,42–44 into CdS can overcome the limitations of single CdS photocatalysts because different band edge positions of CdS and MoS2 facilitate the migration of charge carriers, thus effectively retarding charge recombination. In addition, hybrids of CdS and e-MoS2 will have a wide range of optical absorption from UV to visible-light due to their distinct band structures, which can enhance light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, due to its 2D morphology, e-MoS2 can be very effective for the construction of hybrids with exposed surfaces of both MoS2 and CdS. As a plasmonic metal component, concave cubic Au NCs (Au CNCs) with 8 sharp corners and 12 edges as well as 6 corners and 24 edges on their concave faces were chosen as they can generate strong plasmon energy compared to conventional spherical or convex polyhedral Au NCs due to the high density of high-curvature sites.45,46 The coupling of Au CNCs onto the surface of 2D e-MoS2 followed by the selective overgrowth of CdS on Au CNC surfaces successfully generated e-MoS2–AuCNCs–CdS (e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS) ternary hybrids. Our approach could facilitate intimate coupling between constituent materials. Apparently, the prepared ternary hybrids exhibited excellent visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity compared to their binary hybrid counterparts and single-component photocatalysts. A series of control experiments and mechanistic studies demonstrated that the pronounced solar energy conversion efficiency of the ternary hybrids can be attributed to the (1) efficient plasmon energy transfer, (2) wide range of light absorption, and (3) retardation of charge recombination resulting from the synergism between intimately coupled constituents.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of ternary hybrids
The synthesis process for e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids is depicted in Fig. 1a (see the Experimental section for synthesis details). For the preparation of ternary hybrids, e-MoS2 was first obtained from bulk MoS2 by a physical exfoliation method (Fig. 1b). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of e-MoS2 distinctly show the crystalline structure of e-MoS2 (Fig. S1a and b†). The average thickness of the prepared e-MoS2 measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) was about 3 nm, which corresponds to 4–5 MoS2 layers (Fig. S1c and d†). To compare the light absorption properties of e-MoS2 with those of bulk MoS2, the diffuse reflectance spectra of the prepared e-MoS2 and bulk MoS2 were measured, and their Eg values were estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. S2a and b†).47 The Eg values of e-MoS2 and bulk MoS2 were 1.58 and 1.19 eV, respectively. Based on the fact that the CB edge positions of e-MoS2 and bulk MoS2 were measured to be −0.24 and 0.07 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH = 0, respectively, by electrochemical Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S2c†),48 the wider band gap of e-MoS2 compared to bulk MoS2 can be attributed to the up-shift of the CB edge as a consequence of the quantum confinement effect.49 The upward shifted CB edge of e-MoS2, whose potential is more negative than the reduction potential of H+, can allow e-MoS2 to effectively trigger photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (vide infra). Thanks to its characteristic electronic structure and 2D morphology, e-MoS2 could be used as an effective platform for the formation of ternary hybrids. Indeed, anchoring of the as-synthesized Au CNCs with an average edge length of 52 ± 4 nm and a characteristic LSPR peak centered at 650 nm (Fig. S3†) on the prepared e-MoS2 through electrostatic interaction50,51 successfully yielded e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids (Fig. 1a and c, and S4†). Then, the selective overgrowth of CdS on the Au CNCs in the e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids led to the formation of final e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS ternary hybrids (Fig. 1a and d, and S5a†).

(e) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of an e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrid. (f) XRD pattern of e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. The positions of Au, MoS2, and CdS references were taken from the JCPDS database (Au: 04-0784, MoS2: 37-1492, CdS: 41-1049). 
The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images of the prepared e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids show that CdS shells with an average thickness of 28 ± 5 nm grew preferentially on the surface of the Au CNCs, while the growth of CdS was scarcely observed on the e-MoS2 surfaces (Fig. 1e). The selective overgrowth of CdS on the Au CNC surfaces may be attributed to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) used in the synthesis of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. Given its disposition to form a bilayer structure on a solid support,52,53 CTAB could impede the nucleation of CdS on the 2D e-MoS2 surfaces. In contrast, CTAB could not effectively hinder the nucleation and thus the growth of CdS on the Au CNCs because the Au CNCs have many high-curvature surface sites, at which CTAB generally exhibits sparse coverage.54,55 In fact, when the amount of CTAB was decreased 4-fold in the synthesis, CdS randomly deposited on both Au and MoS2 surfaces (Fig. S6†). The HAADF-STEM image of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids further shows the formation of highly porous CdS shells (Fig. 1e and S5b†), which could allow the transport of reactive species to the surface of the Au CNCs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids demonstrates that the hybrids are composed of hexagonal MoS2, face-centered cubic Au, and hexagonal CdS structures (Fig. 1f and S7†).
To investigate changes in the electronic structures of Mo, Cd, and Au upon hybrid formation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for the Mo 3d, Cd 3d, and Au 4f core levels of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids were carried out and the results were compared with those of e-MoS2, CdS nanoparticles (NPs), and Au CNCs (Fig. S8†). CdS NPs were prepared without e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrid templates under otherwise similar synthesis conditions to those employed in the formation of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids (Fig. S9a†). Notably, the Mo 3d and Cd 3d binding energies of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids red-shifted compared to those of e-MoS2 and CdS NPs (Fig. S8a and b†), while the Au 4f binding energy of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids blue-shifted compared to the pristine Au CNCs (Fig. S8c†). These changes in the electronic structures signify that the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS ternary hybrids formed through the intimate coupling of the constituent e-MoS2, Au CNCs, and CdS, which is crucial to fully harness the advantages of ternary hybrid formation.
To further confirm the intimate coupling between the constituents in the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, dark-field scattering spectroscopy measurements were performed for individual Au CNCs in the Au CNCs, e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids, and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids samples loaded on cover glasses under ambient conditions (Fig. 2). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples show that the Au CNCs of e-MoS2–AuCNC and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids and pristine Au CNCs are highly separated (Fig. S10†), which can make possible the collection of scattered light from individual Au CNCs. The single Au CNC exhibited a LSPR peak around 632 nm, which is associated with its dipolar plasmon resonance. In the scattering spectra of the e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids, slightly red-shifted LSPR peaks of Au CNCs with an average peak position of 644 nm were observed. The LSPR peaks of Au CNCs in the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids further red-shifted to 706 nm. These changes in the LSPR peak position of Au CNCs upon hybrid formation could be due to the closely-coupled MoS2 and CdS, whose dielectric constants are higher than that of air.56,57 The results of dark-field scattering measurements thus confirm that the proposed approach for the formation of hybrids can facilitate intimate coupling between the constituent materials, as revealed by the XPS measurements.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with ternary hybrids
The photocatalytic activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS ternary hybrids toward hydrogen evolution was investigated and benchmarked against those of binary hybrids and single-component catalysts, such as e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids, AuCNC–CdS hybrids, e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, CdS NPs, e-MoS2, bulk MoS2, and Au CNCs, as well as a physical mixture of e-MoS2 + Au CNCs + CdS NPs, to explore the structural and compositional advantages of the ternary hybrids for solar energy conversion. AuCNC–CdS and e-MoS2–CdS hybrids were prepared by growing CdS on Au CNCs and e-MoS2, respectively, with a method similar to that used in the synthesis of e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids from e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids (Fig. S9b and c†). Hydrogen evolution experiments were performed by detecting the amount of hydrogen produced from an aqueous solution of catalysts containing Na2S and Na2SO3 as hole scavengers under the irradiation of visible light (>400 nm) using a 300 W Xe lamp (power density = 100 mW cm−2). Apparently, the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts distinctly depended on their morphology, components, and the manner of coupling (Fig. 3). Notably, the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids showed the most pronounced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution among the different catalysts, corroborating the abovementioned inference that the formation of ternary hybrid photocatalysts consisting of two different complementary semiconductors and plasmonic metal NCs can result in prominent solar energy conversion efficiency. The hydrogen evolution rate of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, 237.90 μmol g−1 h−1, was 1.8, 2.7, 2.6, 6.2, 5.7, 33, and 3.2 times higher than those of the e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids, AuCNC–CdS hybrids, e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, CdS NPs, e-MoS2, bulk MoS2, and e-MoS2 + Au CNCs + CdS NP mixture, respectively (Fig. 3b). Hydrogen evolution was not detected with the Au CNCs or without catalysts. The higher hydrogen evolution rate of e-MoS2 in comparison to bulk MoS2 is in good accordance with its upward shifted CB edge in comparison to bulk MoS2. Evidently, the much inferior photocatalytic activity of the physical mixture of the constituent materials of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids compared to the ternary hybrids reveals the importance of intimate coupling between the constituents of the ternary hybrids for achieving enhanced photocatalytic activity. The e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids almost maintained their original hydrogen evolution activity and morphology after repeated photocatalysis cycles, demonstrating their good recyclability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (Fig. S11†). The good recyclability of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids further indicates that the photocorrosion of the metal sulfides in the hybrids could be effectively suppressed during the photocatalysis, which can be attributed to the rapid consumption of holes in the metal sulfides by the hole scavengers in the reaction solution (vide infra).58,59

To further demonstrate the superb visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, the hydrogen evolution activities of a commercial TiO2 photocatalyst (P25) and P25-plasmonic metal hybrid photocatalysts, such as P25-Au and P25-Ag, were examined under identical photocatalysis conditions and compared with that of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. As shown in Fig. S12†, the pristine P25 showed very low hydrogen evolution activity (3.48 μmol g−1 h−1) due to its large Eg.60 Although the prepared P25-Au and P25-Ag photocatalysts exhibited higher hydrogen evolution activities in comparison to the P25 as a result of plasmon energy transfer, their hydrogen evolution rates were 16.4 and 8.1 times lower than those of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, respectively. These results distinctly verify the pronounced photocatalytic activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids for hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation. In addition, we extensively measured apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids toward hydrogen evolution under monochromatic light irradiation from 450 to 750 nm (interval = 50 nm) and compared the results with those of previously reported semiconductor-plasmonic metal (Au or Ag) hybrid photocatalysts51,61–64 (see Fig. S13†). Notably, the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids showed prominent AQEs compared to the reported hybrid photocatalysts, especially under >600 nm irradiation, which can be attributed to their high light harvesting efficiency. Interestingly, the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids exhibited an AQE value of 0.52% under 650 nm irradiation, which is hard to achieve with conventional photocatalysts.65
Promotional effects of Au CNCs and e-MoS2–CdS coupling on photocatalysis
As shown in Fig. 3, Au CNC-containing hybrid photocatalysts, such as the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS, e-MoS2–AuCNC, and AuCNC–CdS hybrids, showed superior hydrogen evolution activities over their semiconductor counterparts, such as e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, e-MoS2, and CdS NPs, respectively. This finding unambiguously indicates the promotional effect of the Au CNCs on the improvement of hydrogen evolution activity. Given that the action spectra of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids collected under monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. S13†) show a close correlation between the AQEs and the LSPR spectra of the hybrids (Fig. 2d), the promotional effect of the Au CNCs can be attributed to their capability to generate strong plasmon energy upon irradiation that can be transferred to adjacent semiconductors.24,33,51
To further verify the significance of the plasmonic function of Au CNCs in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, we prepared metal–semiconductor hybrids using spherical Au NCs with an average size of 78 ± 5 nm, which is comparable to those of the Au CNCs, namely e-MoS2–Ausphere–CdS, e-MoS2–Ausphere, and Ausphere–CdS hybrids (Fig. S14†). Then, we compared their photocatalytic performance to that of the Au CNC-containing hybrids. In comparison to the Au CNCs, which have multiple high-curvature sites that can act as hot spots, spherical Au NCs produce weaker plasmon energy upon irradiation. As such, hybrids of spherical Au NCs would show inferior photocatalytic performance relative to Au CNC-containing hybrids if the plasmonic function of Au NCs is critical to boost the photocatalytic activity. Indeed, the electromagnetic (EM) field enhancements (|E|/|E0|) around e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and e-MoS2–Ausphere–CdS hybrids simulated by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method reveal that the e-MoS2–Ausphere–CdS hybrids induce weaker (6.3-fold) EM field enhancements at the metal–semiconductor interfaces compared to the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids (Fig. 4a). Apparently, the hybrids of spherical Au NCs exhibited lower hydrogen evolution activities than their Au CNC-containing counterparts, which is in line with our expectation (Fig. 4b). The e-MoS2–Ausphere–CdS, e-MoS2–Ausphere, and Ausphere–CdS hybrids showed 27, 30, and 18% lower hydrogen evolution rates than those of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS, e-MoS2–AuCNC, and AuCNC–CdS hybrids, respectively. These results explicitly indicate that the characteristic plasmonic function of the Au CNCs imparted by their morphological features greatly contributes to the amplification of the photocatalytic activity of the hybrids.

The scale bars in I and II are 20 nm. The excitation wavelength was selected based on the FDTD-simulated extinction spectra of the hybrids and the surrounding water, with a refractive index of 1.33, was used as a dielectric medium. (b) Comparison of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates between Au CNC- and spherical Au NC-containing hybrids. 
On the other hand, the importance of the coupling of the complementary semiconductors, e-MoS2 and CdS, in the promotion of the photocatalytic function of the hybrids is evidenced by the much higher hydrogen evolution activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids in comparison to the hybrids containing a single semiconductor component, i.e., the e-MoS2–AuCNC and AuCNC–CdS hybrids (Fig. 3 and S13†). In fact, the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than single e-MoS2 and CdS catalysts (Fig. 3). The superior photocatalytic performance of the hybrids with the e-MoS2–CdS couple over their counterparts containing a single e-MoS2 or CdS component can be partly ascribed to the extension of their extinction cross-section resulting from the combination of e-MoS2 and CdS. This is corroborated by the comparison of the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids with those of the e-MoS2 and CdS NPs (Fig. 5a). The CdS NPs absorb below about 500 nm due to their band gap (Eg = 2.52 eV, Fig. S15a†), while the e-MoS2 showed an absorption edge around 720 nm with a slight decrease in the absorbance below 600 nm due to its band structure. Compared to the pure semiconductors, the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids exhibited more efficient light absorption capacity, which can lead to improved light harvesting efficiency.

Together with the broadening of the optical absorption range, the coupling of the complementary e-MoS2 and CdS can facilitate charge separation and migration, resulting in the retardation of electron–hole pair recombination. Regarding the migration of photogenerated charges in hybrids of CdS and MoS2, it is widely accepted that photogenerated electrons in the CB of CdS transfer to MoS2 due to the more negative potential of the CB edge of CdS in comparison to that of MoS2.66,67 To prove the promotion of electron/hole transfer efficiency upon the combination of e-MoS2 and CdS, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements on various catalyst systems, such as CdS NPs, a physical mixture of e-MoS2 and CdS NPs, e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, under excitation at 375 nm with the hole scavengers. As shown in Fig. 5b, the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids exhibited much weaker PL emission than the CdS NPs and e-MoS2 + CdS NP mixture, distinctly indicating the slower recombination of photogenerated charges in the intimately coupled hybrids of e-MoS2 and CdS compared to the CdS NPs and e-MoS2 + CdS NP mixture. The decrease in the PL emission of the physical mixture of e-MoS2 and CdS NPs relative to the CdS NPs may be ascribed to partial charge migration by temporal physical contact between the CdS NPs and e-MoS2. Interestingly, the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids showed a further decrease in PL emission intensity compared to the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids. This demonstrates that the incorporation of the Au CNCs into the e-MoS2–CdS couple can promote photocatalytic activity through not only their characteristic plasmonic function but also the further acceleration of the migration of photogenerated charges.
Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with ternary hybrids
Understanding the underpinning mechanism of photocatalysis with e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids is desirable to elucidate the synergism between the constituent materials of ternary plasmonic metal–semiconductor hybrids, which can provide a great opportunity to develop advanced photocatalyst systems for efficient solar energy conversion. To explore the behavior of photogenerated electrons and holes in ternary hybrids, we constructed a band diagram of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids based on the band gaps and CB edge potentials of the e-MoS2 and CdS NPs as well as the Fermi energy (EF) of Au (0.5 V vs. NHE at pH = 0) (Fig. 6a).68 The CB edge potential of the CdS NPs was estimated to be −0.41 V vs. NHE at pH = 0 from their Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. S15b†). Based on the band structure of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids together with the results and findings in the photocatalysis experiments, plausible migration routes for the photogenerated charge carriers could be proposed as shown in Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  Band structures and electron/hole transfer processes in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for (a) e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and (b) e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids. 
As revealed by the control experiments, the plasmonic function of the Au CNCs can boost the photocatalytic activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. This may be due to the transfer of the photogenerated plasmon energy of the Au CNCs to the semiconductors via the migration of plasmon-induced hot electrons in the Au CNCs to the CB of the semiconductors, namely hot electron transfer (HET, path I),26,27 and/or EM field-assisted plasmon energy transfer (EMT), which can lead to an increase in the charge carrier density of the semiconductors.28,29 To identify a plausible pathway for plasmon energy transfer in the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, we prepared ternary hybrids containing thin insulating SiO2 layers between the Au CNCs and semiconductors, i.e., e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids, using AuCNC@SiO2 core–shell NCs consisting of Au CNC cores and 1–2 nm SiO2 shells (Fig. S16†), and their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was compared with that of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. The HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of the product show the successful generation of SiO2-embedded hybrids (Fig. 7a). Since thin (<5 nm) insulating SiO2 layers can inhibit the HET process without a significant deterioration of the EMT process (Fig. 6b),28,33 the photocatalytic activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids should be definitely decreased in comparison to that of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids if the contribution of the HET process to the plasmon energy transfer is dominant. Notably, the e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids exhibited a 72% decrease in hydrogen evolution activity relative to the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids (Fig. 7b and c). The hydrogen evolution rate of the e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids normalized to the mass of semiconductor entities (e-MoS2 + CdS), 69.78 μmol g−1 h−1, was even lower than that of the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, 91.50 μmol g−1 h−1. Evidently, these results confirm that the plasmon energy transfer proceeds overwhelmingly through the HET process (path I). In addition, the lower photocatalytic activity of the e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids compared to that of the e-MoS2–CdS hybrids further verifies the abovementioned secondary promotional effect of the Au CNCs on the photocatalytic activity, i.e., the acceleration of charge migration.

(b) Amounts of hydrogen evolved during the photocatalysis with e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS, e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS, and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdSthick hybrids, which are normalized to the total mass of catalysts and (c) corresponding hydrogen evolution rates. 
Taken together, we can conclude that photoexcited electrons upon the irradiation of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids are accumulated at the CB of e-MoS2 through the injection of plasmon-induced hot electrons (path I) and the electron transfer from the CB of CdS (path II), which was evidenced by the PL measurements, as well as the photoexcitation of VB electrons in e-MoS2 (path III) (Fig. 6a). These accumulated electrons then produce hydrogen by reducing H+.69,70 Meanwhile, photogenerated holes in each e-MoS2, CdS, and Au CNC domain are supposed to be consumed by reaction with the hole scavengers, Na2S/Na2SO3, in the reaction solution. Regarding the hole consumption at the Au CNCs, it can be inferred that the presence of pores in the CdS shells of the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids can allow the transport of the hole scavengers to the surface of inner Au CNCs. As such, restoring charge balance to the Au CNCs can be achieved, which is essential for a sustainable HET. To corroborate our inference, change in the photocatalytic activity of the hybrids with an increase in the CdS shell thickness was examined using ternary hybrids with thicker CdS shells (46 ± 9 nm) compared to the standard e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, namely e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdSthick hybrids, which were synthesized by adjusting the growth time of CdS. The prepared e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdSthick hybrids had a similar morphology and compositional structure to the typical e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids, except for the thickness of the CdS shells (Fig. S17†). Notably, the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdSthick hybrids showed a 37% decrease in the hydrogen evolution rate compared to the e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids (Fig. 7b and c). Indeed, this can be attributed to the lessened accessibility of the hole scavengers to the surface of Au CNCs with the increase in the CdS shell thickness, thus confirming the suggested mechanism.
Conclusions
We have developed a rational synthetic strategy for the realization of ternary hybrid photocatalysts with a combination of two different semiconductors having complementary band structures and shape-controlled plasmonic metal NCs for efficient solar energy conversion. The sequential Au NC anchoring and CdS growth on 2D exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets successfully yielded intimately coupled plasmonic metal–semiconductor ternary hybrids. The prepared ternary hybrids exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capability over their binary hybrid counterparts and single-component catalysts, which can be attributed to the synergistic integration of the advantages of semiconductor–semiconductor coupling, such as the broadening of light absorption and the retardation of charge recombination through facilitated charge migration, and the plasmon energy transfer from Au NCs to semiconductors via the hot electron transfer mechanism. The present work highlights the significance of the rational design of metal–semiconductor hybrids with precisely controlled topologies to fully harness the inherent function of constituent materials and thus to devise high-performance solar energy conversion platforms. We envision that our approach can be extended to the generation of a new class of multicomponent hybrid materials with desired functions for various applications.

Other chemicals, unless specified, were of reagent grade and highly purified water with a resistivity of greater than 18.0 MΩ cm was used in the preparation of aqueous solutions.
Preparation of Au CNCs
For the synthesis of Au CNCs, Au NC seeds were first prepared by injecting 0.5 mL of HAuCl4 (5 mM) and 0.6 mL of NaBH4 (10 mM) into a 10 mL aqueous solution of CTAC (100 mM) with vigorous stirring for 1 min. The reaction solution was left at room temperature for 5 h. The prepared Au NC seed solution was diluted to have a specific concentration for the preparation of various Au NCs with different shapes and sizes. In a typical synthesis of Au CNCs, 2 mL of HAuCl4 (5 mM), 0.2 mL of AgNO3 (10 mM), 2 mL of HCl (1.1 M), and 1 mL of AA (100 mM) were sequentially injected into a 20 mL aqueous solution of CTAC (100 mM). Then, 0.1 mL of Au NC seed solution diluted 100-fold with CTAC (100 mM) was added. The resultant solution was stored at room temperature for 12 h.
Preparation of e-MoS2
In a typical preparation of e-MoS2, 60 mL of isopropyl alcohol was added to 60 mg of bulk MoS2 (1 mg mL−1) and the resultant mixture was sonicated for 14 h. The color of the mixture changed from black to dark green during the exfoliation of bulk MoS2. After the sonication, the mixture was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 60 min. To separate e-MoS2 from un-exfoliated MoS2, two-thirds of the supernatant was collected and dried in an oven at 50 °C.
Preparation of e-MoS2–AuCNC and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids
In the first step, 4 mL of an aqueous solution of Au CNCs (0.075 mMAu) was added to 1 mL of e-MoS2 NMP solution (1 mg mL−1). The resultant solution was sonicated for 2 h to anchor Au CNCs on e-MoS2 to form e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids. After the sonication, e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The obtained e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids were re-dispersed into 5 mL of CTAB (400 mM). Then, 1 mL of AA (100 mM), 1 mL of HMTA (100 mM), 40 μL of thioacetamide (50 mM), and 10 μL of cadmium acetate (50 mM) were sequentially injected into 5 mL of e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrid solution. The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 3.5 h in an oven to form e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. The final product was washed three times with highly purified water and then dispersed in methanol.
Preparation of spherical Au NC-containing hybrids
For the preparation of spherical Au NCs, 2 mL of HAuCl4 (5 mM), 1 mL of AA (300 mM), and 0.1 mL of the Au NC seed solution diluted 10-fold with CTAC (100 mM) were sequentially injected into a 20 mL aqueous solution of CTAC (100 mM), and then the solution was stored at room temperature for one day to produce second Au NC seeds. In a typical synthesis of spherical Au NCs with an average size of 78 nm, 0.5 mL of HAuCl4 (5 mM), 0.25 mL of second Au NC seed solution, and 1 mL of AA (300 mM) were sequentially added to a 20 mL aqueous solution of CTAC (100 mM), and then the solution was heated at 100 °C for 16 h in an oven. By using the prepared spherical Au NC solution (0.046 mMAu), e-MoS2–Ausphere and e-MoS2–Ausphere–CdS hybrids were synthesized using synthesis conditions identical to those employed for the preparation of e-MoS2–AuCNC and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids.
Preparation of CdS NPs and e-MoS2–CdS hybrids
In a typical synthesis of CdS NPs, 20 mL of AA (100 mM), 20 mL of HMTA (100 mM), 0.8 mL of thioacetamide (200 mM), and 0.2 mL of cadmium acetate (200 mM) were sequentially added to 100 mL of CTAB (100 mM), and then the solution was heated at 100 °C for 1 h in an oven. For the synthesis of e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, an e-MoS2 solution was prepared by dispersing e-MoS2 (2 mg) into 5 mL of CTAB (100 mM). Then, 1 mL of AA (100 mM), 1 mL of HMTA (100 mM), 40 μL of thioacetamide (100 mM), and 10 μL of cadmium acetate (100 mM) were sequentially added to the e-MoS2 solution. The solution was heated at 80 °C for 3 h in an oven. The final product was washed three times with highly purified water and then dispersed in methanol.
Preparation of AuCNC–CdS and Ausphere–CdS hybrids
For the synthesis of AuCNC–CdS hybrids, 20 mL of AA (100 mM) and 20 mL of HMTA (100 mM) were added to 100 mL of Au CNC solution (0.06 mMAu) containing CTAB (50 mM). Then, 0.8 mL of thioacetamide (50 mM) and 0.2 mL of cadmium acetate (50 mM) were sequentially added to the solution. The solution was kept at 80 °C for 2 h in an oven. The final product was washed three times with highly purified water and then dispersed in methanol. Ausphere–CdS hybrids were prepared with a scheme identical to that used for the synthesis of AuCNC–CdS hybrids using spherical Au NCs instead of Au CNCs.
Preparation of AuCNC@SiO2 core–shell NCs and e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids
In a typical synthesis of AuCNC@SiO2 core–shell NCs, 0.2 mL of APTMS (10 mM) was injected into a 20 mL aqueous solution of Au CNCs (0.5 mMAu) and the resultant solution was vigorously stirred for 1 h. Then, 0.1 mL of sodium silicate solution (5.4 wt%) at pH 10–11 was added. The solution was heated at 90 °C for 1 h. Sodium silicate solution (0.1 mL, 5.4 wt%) at pH 10–11 was additionally injected twice at an interval of 1 h. The final product was washed two times with highly purified water and then dispersed in 20 mL of CTAC (100 mM). e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids were prepared with a protocol identical to that used for the synthesis of e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids using AuCNC@SiO2 core–shell NCs instead of Au CNCs.
Characterization
Extinction spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using the Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer with an ISR-3100 integrating sphere. PL spectra were recorded with an Edinburgh Instruments FL920 spectrometer. TEM and HAADF-STEM-EDS measurements were conducted using a double Cs-corrected transmission electron microscope (FEI Titan cubed G2 60-300) operated at 300 kV after placing a drop of sample solution on a carbon-coated Cu grid (200 mesh). XRD patterns were obtained with a RIGAKU D/MAX-RC thin-film X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (0.1542 nm) radiation. XPS spectra were obtained with a Thermo VG Scientific Sigma Probe. XPS data were calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. AFM images and height profiles were obtained in air at room temperature by using a Park System XE-100 scanning probe microscope. Dark-field scattering images and spectra were obtained with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with an oil-immersion dark-field condenser (Olympus U-DCW, NA = 1.4-1.2), a ×40 objective lens (Olympus UPlanSapo, NA = 0.95), and a 100 W halogen lamp (Olympus U-LH100L-3). Samples were loaded on a 24 × 24 mm cover glass using a spin coater, and then mounted onto the microscope. Dark-field scattering images were recorded with a Canon EOS 60D digital camera. To obtain the dark-field scattering spectra of individual Au CNCs, scattered light from a single Au CNC was collected through an iris diaphragm and focused onto the entrance of a spectrometer (Ocean Optics QE 6500). The scattering intensity of a sample (IS) was corrected with the scattering intensity of the background (IBG) and white light (IWL) by following the equation: (IS − IBG)/IWL. Mott–Schottky analyses were conducted using a CH Instruments Model 760D potentiostat in a three-electrode cell. A fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate covered with a mixture of a sample (1 mg mL−1) in 100 μL isopropanol and a 50 μL of 5% Nafion solution was used as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Mott–Schottky plots were measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 at a potential range of −1.0 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at 1000 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The potential values vs. Ag/AgCl (EAg/AgCl) were converted to those vs. NHE at pH = 0 (ENHE, pH=0) according to the Nernst equation: ENHE, pH=0 = EAg/AgCl + E0 + 0.05916 pH, where E0 is 0.1976 V at 25 °C.
FDTD simulation
EM field distributions around nanostructures were simulated by using a 3-dimensional FDTD method with the commercial FDTD-Lumerical™ simulation package. Mesh size for the calculation was 0.5 nm and the excitation wavelength was 800 nm. The shape of CdS shells in hybrids was modeled as a cube to simplify the calculation and other structural parameters were determined based on the experimentally obtained morphological parameters of hybrids.
Photocatalysis experiments
For photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, 2 mg of photocatalysts was dispersed into a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 0.25 M of Na2S and 0.35 M of Na2SO3, and the resultant solution was transferred to a quartz cell. Before irradiation, the solution was purged with Ar gas for 30 min in the dark. Then, the cell was irradiated with visible light by using a 300 W Xe lamp (Newport 66902) equipped with a UV-cutoff filter (>400 nm) and a liquid filter for removing IR light. The intensity of light in the cell was measured to be 100 mW cm−2. The amount of hydrogen evolved was measured by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890 B). To estimate AQEs, band pass filters with center wavelengths of 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 nm ± 2 nm (full width at half maximum = 10 ± 2 nm) were used. AQEs were calculated by following the equation: AQE (%) = [2N(H2)/N(photons)] × 100 = [2n(H2) × NAhc]/[S × P × t × λ] × 100, where N(H2) is the number of evolved H2, N(photons) is the number of incident photons, n(H2) is the number of moles of evolved H2, NA is the Avogadro's number, h is the Plank's constant, c is the speed of light, S is the irradiation area, P is the intensity of light, t is the irradiation time, and λ is the excitation wavelength.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the fabrication of e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. Typical TEM images of (b) e-MoS2, (c) e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids, and (d) e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. (e) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of an e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrid. (f) XRD pattern of e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids. The positions of Au, MoS2, and CdS references were taken from the JCPDS database (Au: 04-0784, MoS2: 37-1492, CdS: 41-1049).	 

 	Fig. 2  Dark-field scattering images of (a) Au CNCs, (b) e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrids, and (c) e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids loaded on cover glasses. The inset in each image shows an enlarged image of the red-circled area. (d) Three representative dark-field scattering spectra of individual Au CNCs in Au CNCs, and e-MoS2–AuCNC hybrid and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrid samples. Average peak wavelengths are denoted with bars.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Amounts of hydrogen evolved during the photocatalysis with different catalysts, which are normalized to the total mass of catalysts and (b) corresponding hydrogen evolution rates.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) FDTD-simulation models of ternary hybrids, which were constructed based on their morphological parameters, and corresponding EM field enhancement (|E|/|E0|) distributions around (I) e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and (II) e-MoS2–Ausphere–CdS hybrids with an excitation of 800 nm. The scale bars in I and II are 20 nm. The excitation wavelength was selected based on the FDTD-simulated extinction spectra of the hybrids and the surrounding water, with a refractive index of 1.33, was used as a dielectric medium. (b) Comparison of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates between Au CNC- and spherical Au NC-containing hybrids.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Diffuse reflectance spectra of e-MoS2, CdS NPs, and e-MoS2–CdS hybrids. (b) PL spectra of CdS NPs, e-MoS2 + CdS NP mixture, e-MoS2–CdS hybrids, and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS hybrids.	 

 	Fig. 6  Band structures and electron/hole transfer processes in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for (a) e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS and (b) e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) HAADF-STEM and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS hybrids. (b) Amounts of hydrogen evolved during the photocatalysis with e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdS, e-MoS2–AuCNC@SiO2–CdS, and e-MoS2–AuCNC–CdSthick hybrids, which are normalized to the total mass of catalysts and (c) corresponding hydrogen evolution rates.
