    , Accepted 19th March 2019First published on 20th March 2019AbstractGuanidinium (GA) has been proposed as an effective organic cation in improving the stability of lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the reported efficiency of GA based PSCs is far behind traditional GA-free devices. Herein, a novel GA doped quadruple cation perovskite, Cs0.05(FA0.83(MA1−xGAx)0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (CsFAMA1−xGAx), is presented. It is found that the introduction of GA induces a phase separation of 3D CsFAMA1−xGAx, 2D FAGAPbI4, and 1D δ-FAPbI3. By tuning the content of GA, a δ-FAPbI3/CsFAMA1−xGAx (1D/3D) perovskite with superior optoelectronic properties is demonstrated. The novel 1D/3D perovskite shows an overall improvement in stability. The corresponding solar cell exhibits a PCE of 20.29% with negligible hysteresis, being the highest reported efficiency for GA based PSCs thus far. This study introduces a new perovskite model toward efficient and highly stable PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHP) have attracted tremendous attention from both academic and industrial communities since the first development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reported in 2012.1 In the succeeding years, based on peculiar optoelectronic properties, such as strong light absorption,2 tunable band gap,3 small exciton binding energy,4 and excellent charge carrier mobility and diffusion length,5 PSCs have witnessed a steady development.6–8 To date, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7%, which is comparable to that of commercial crystalline silicon solar cells, has been achieved.9 However, the poor stability of OIHP materials remains the key obstacle toward practical utilization.10–13 To overcome this, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = halide) have been proposed as an alternative to fabricate stable devices.14–16 In addition, doping and encapsulation of hydrophobic groups have been investigated for preventing moisture ingress.17–19 Unfortunately, there remain some challenges, such as low efficiency and high temperature fabrication requirement for all-inorganic PSCs,20,21 and light induced degradation, especially by UV irradiation, for traditional methylammonium based perovskites.22 Therefore, further investigation on designing stable PSCs with high photovoltaic performance is urgently needed.
Recently, a growing number of studies have focused on two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper phase perovskites by replacing the small hydrophilic cations, such as methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), and cesium (Cs), with larger organic cations.23,24 Compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, such as MAPbI3, 2D perovskites tend to have better stability due to the stronger van der Waals interaction and hydrophobicity of large organic cations.25,26 To date, cations, such as phenylethylammonium (PEA), butylammonium (BA), aminovaleric acid (AVA) and guanidinium (GA), have been reported to yield more stable PSCs.27–30 In particular, GA-cation based perovskites have been proposed as attractive absorbers for devices with high efficiency and superior stability.31–34 Analysis of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) reveals that pure GAPbI3 has a t value of 1.03, indicating that it is slightly too large to be incorporated into the cavity formed by the corner-connected PbI6 octahedra to form a 3D perovskite structure.26,34 However, by using a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method, Kubicki et al. indicated that GA can be incorporated into the lattice of MAPbI3, forming a GAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite phase. This kind of perovskite shows potential to increase the charge carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage.32 Similarly, Jodlowski et al. reported that moderate concentration of GA can be incorporated into the crystal lattice of MAPbI3 forming a GA-cation based perovskite with enhanced thermal and environmental stability, delivering a stable power output above 19%.33 Further, Nazarenko et al. synthesized a novel 2D FAGAPbI4 perovskite by using a glycerol bath method. They revealed that this kind of perovskite is thermally stable, photoconductive, and exhibits photoluminescence in the red region.35 These studies have provided some insights into GA-cation based perovskites and revealed that GA is an attractive candidate to fabricate novel PSCs with superior performance. However, the efficiency of GA-cation based PSCs remains much lower than that of traditional PSCs. Besides, the investigations on GA-cation based PSCs thus far have all concentrated on GAxMA1−xPbI3 or GAxFA1−xPbI3. As a consequence, GA-cation based perovskites with other components, possessing attractive optoelectronic properties, are yet to be investigated.
Herein, we demonstrate a novel quadruple cation based perovskite, with a chemical formula of Cs0.05(FA0.83(MA1−xGAx)0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (abbreviated as CsFAMA1−xGAx), towards efficient and highly stable PSCs. The perovskites with different x values ranging from 0 to 1 were explored by gradually replacing MA with GA, and the corresponding phase, chemical composition, optical properties, morphology, optoelectronic properties and stability were systematically investigated. Our findings reveal that moderate contents of GA can be incorporated into the crystal unit, forming a 3D perovskite with enhanced carrier life time. However, excess GA tends to induce the formation of 2D phase FAGAPbI4 and 1D yellow phase FAPbI3 (denoted as δ-FAPbI3), which are proposed to have both advantageous and disadvantageous effects on device performance. On the one hand, a few of these new phases can passivate the defects and deliver an improved device performance. While on the other hand, an excess of these phases in the perovskite layer reduces the absorbance of the films, leading to deterioration in device performance. By finely tuning the content of GA, a champion device with an efficiency of 20.29% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.12 V was obtained, which are much larger than the PCE of 18.45% and Voc of 1.08 V of the GA-free reference device. Moreover, stability tests revealed that GA-cation based PSCs provided an overall improvement in stability. The results revealed a phase separated quadruple cation based CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite layer, which is important for efficient and stable PSCs.
Results and discussion
As depicted in Fig. 1, GA is obtained by substituting the C–H hydrogen in FA with an –NH2 group. On its own, GA comprises one carbon and three –NH2 groups, with an ionic radius of about 278 pm, larger than that of FA (253 pm) and MA (217 pm). Previous studies have demonstrated that GA can be directly incorporated into the lattice of MAPbI3 or FAPbI3, forming pure 3D GAxMA1−xPbI3 or GAxFA1−xPbI3 phases.32,33 In an attempt to extend the same strategy to construct more ideal GA doped perovskites, a triple cation based perovskite (Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3, CsFAMA) was adopted as the model system.36,37 To obtain GA doped perovskites, some of the MABr molecules were replaced by GABr, and their ratio was carefully controlled as described in the Experimental section. The analysis of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) indicates that it is possible to form a series of 3D GA doped quadruple cation based perovskites (Table S1†).

The equation shown in Fig. 2 illustrates the perovskite formation. In this study, the perovskite films differ in the x value, for example, x = 0 denoted as w/o GA, and x = 1 as 1 GA. To gain insight into the structure of the perovskites, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the CsFAMA1−xGAx family of perovskites with different x values. It is noted that the diffraction intensity of the peak at around 14.1°, corresponding to the (110) plane of the perovskite phase, gradually decreased with the increase of the x value. At the same time, new diffraction peaks, which are attributed to 1D δ-FAPbI3 (11.5°), 2D FAGAPbI4 (12.1°) and cubic PbI2 (12.8°) phases, were observed.35,38,39 This indicates that the introduction of GA suppressed the formation of a tetragonal perovskite and introduced new phases of δ-FAPbI3, FAGAPbI4 and PbI2. The formation of different phases is mainly due to the different precipitation kinetics of MA-based, FA-based and GA-based hybrids because of their different ion radii and numbers of hydrogen bonds in the Pb–I framework.40 However, a closer inspection of the (110) and (220) perovskite lattice planes shown in Fig. 2b reveals a peak shift to lower angles. According to Bragg's law: 2dsinθ = nλ, where a smaller θ contributes to a larger interplanar distance (d), the lower angle shifted peaks reveal a gradual expansion of the crystal unit, indicating incorporation of the larger GA cation. Thus, a comprehensive comparison of XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2a and b can lead to the following three points. First, moderate contents of GA (x < 0.2) can be wholly incorporated into the crystal, forming pure 3D CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskites. Second, excess GA would introduce phase separation into δ-FAPbI3/CsFAMA1−xGAx (1D/3D) when x is 0.2–0.4, and δ-FAPbI3/FAGAPbI4/CsFAMA1−xGAx (1D/2D/3D) when x is >0.4. Third, over excess GA (x > 0.6) cannot incorporate into the crystal unit (Fig. 2b, unchanged XRD peaks), but contributes to the formation of 1D phase δ-FAPbI3 and 2D phase FAGAPbI4, leading to a significant decrease of the (110) diffraction of the 3D CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite.

Chemical compositions and environments of the films were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S1,† films with different x values (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) reveal clear peaks of N, Pb, I and Br. The absence of the Cs peak is mainly attributed to the very low content of the Cs cation. However, detection of Cs 3d core spectra shown in Fig. S1b† verified the existence of Cs. No observation of other peaks indicates pure composition of the films. Fig. 2c–f show the corresponding N 1s, Pb 4f, I 3d and Br 3d core spectra, respectively. Noticeably, the photoemission spectra of N 1s (Fig. 2c) tend to be fitted into two peaks attributed to the NH3+ group in MA (402.2 eV) and the NH2+ group in FA and GA (400.4 eV), where the corresponding peak intensity changes with the value of x. The atomic ratios of N between NH3+ and NH2+ groups in different films were estimated based on the XPS spectra, and the relevant results are summarized in Table S2.† The similar atomic ratio values derived from XPS spectra and perovskite precursors indicate a stoichiometric composition between MA, FA and GA. The core spectra of Pb 4f are presented in Fig. 2d, in which two main peaks at 138.5 eV and 143.4 eV are observed, consistent with the binding energies of lead halides (PbI2 and PbBr2).41 Interestingly, two extra peaks at 136.7 eV and 141.6 eV were observed in the 0.8 GA and 1 GA films, as shown in the inset. The new peaks are assigned to metallic lead (Pb0), which is generally regarded as a recombination center of carriers in the film, leading to deterioration in device performance.42 Further, the I 3d and Br 3d XPS core spectra shown in Fig. 2e and f reveal that GA content has insignificant influence on the chemical environments of iodine(I) and bromine (Br).
Optical properties of the perovskites with different x values were systematically investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Photographs of the films shown in Fig. 3a reveal a color change from black to brown then to reddish brown, indicating different phases of the films. Fig. 3b shows ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption of the films, revealing a distinct effect of GA. It is clear that films with x values < 0.4 give similar absorbance spectra with an absorption band edge at around 780 nm. However, a further increment of the x value leads to a significant decrease of light absorbance in the visible region. The decreased absorbance is mainly due to the large quantities of photoinactive 1D δ-FAPbI3 and 2D FAGAPbI4, which restrict the formation of the 3D CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite. Particularly, when x > 0.6, two absorption transitions at 510 nm and 450 nm were observed with an emission peak at 543 nm (Fig. S2†), further confirming the presence of 2D FAGAPbI4, which is consistent with a previous study.35 Besides, a blue shift of the absorption edges was observed as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, indicating widening of the band gap along with the incremental increase of the x value (Fig. 3c). This can be attributed to the distortion and expansion of CsFAMA1−xGAx crystals due to the different number of hydrogen bonds provided by GA. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) results shown in Fig. 3d reveal a shift in the emission peak from 782 nm to 760 nm when the x value increased from 0 to 0.6, which is in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 3c. However, a further increase of x from 0.6 to 1 did not cause any change in the emission peak (Fig. 3e), revealing the same composition of 3D CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskites. This indicates that excess GA does not incorporate into the crystal unit, which is in good agreement with XRD results. Additionally, it is noted that the PL intensity of the films increased and then decreased with the increase of the x value, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. The strongest PL intensity of the 0.2 GA film (Fig. 3d) suggests that the nonradiative recombination is significantly suppressed, indicating a reduced bulk defect film. This can be attributed to the passivation effect of δ-FAPbI3 formed during the introduction of GA (Fig. 2a).40 A further increase of the x value contributes to a significantly decreased PL intensity due to the reduced 3D perovskite phase (CsFAMA1−xGAx) and the presence of metallic lead (Pb0), as suggested by XRD and XPS results.

To further investigate the effect of GA on the morphology, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was carried out. Fig. 4a–f show the SEM images of perovskite films (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1). It is clear that all films have grown with full coverage of substrates. Compared with the reference w/o GA film (Fig. 4a), Fig. 4b showing the 0.2 GA film reveals a larger average grain size (Fig. 4g) due to the expansion of the crystal unit for incorporating GA as discussed earlier. On the other hand, a further increase of the x value led to a relatively poor morphology with unclear grain boundaries and pinholes, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. More interestingly, some plate-like or nanorod-like crystals distributed around the grain boundaries were clearly observed in Fig. 4e and f for 0.8 GA and 1 GA films, respectively. As discussed earlier, excess GA (x > 0.6) cannot incorporate into the crystal unit, but contributes to the formation of FAGAPbI4 and δ-FAPbI3. In this case, the emerging plate-like or nanorod-like crystals are assigned to 2D FAGAPbI4 and 1D δ-FAPbI3, respectively. The results indicate that a moderate content of GA is conducive to the formation of uniform and pinhole free perovskite films with larger grains, whereas excess GA would lead to a poor morphology with apparent pinholes and new phases. To further study the distribution of 2D FAGAPbI4 and 1D δ-FAPbI3 in the CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite film, grazing incident XRD (GIXRD) was performed with varying incident angles from 0.5° to 7°. It is known that at low incident angles, wave penetration is limited, thus, most of the diffraction signal is collected from the topmost layer. Fig. 4h and i show the GIXRD results for 0.2 GA and 0.6 GA films, where the peak intensities were normalized to the (110) diffraction of the CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite. Noticeably, the peak intensity of 1D δ-FAPbI3 in both films decreased gradually with the increase of incident angle from 0.5° to 7°, indicating that δ-FAPbI3 is present with slightly higher distribution on the surface. However, the almost unchanged diffraction peak for 2D FAGAPbI4 shown in Fig. 4h reveals a uniform distribution in the film.

To study the photovoltaic properties of CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskites, conventional planar devices with a simple configuration of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as illustrated in Fig. 5a, were fabricated. The corresponding cross-section SEM image shown in Fig. 5b reveals a dense, compact and uniform perovskite film with a thickness of ≈400 nm. Fig. 5c and S3† show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with different x values under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and S3.† External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices showed blue shifted photoresponses with an increase of the x value (Fig. 5d), which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption and PL results (Fig. 3). Fig. 5e and S4† show the statistical distribution of the photovoltaic parameters collected from 15 solar cells for each x value. Clearly, the short current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) showed small difference for x < 0.4, but gradually decreased with the increasing x value. This can be ascribed to the reduced absorbance (Fig. 3b), as supported by the EQE spectra (Fig. 5d). In addition, open circuit voltage (Voc) reveals an incremental increase at first reaching a maximum at x = 0.3, but decreased with a further increase of the x value. The initial increase in Voc can be attributed to the broadening of the band gap (Fig. 3c) and the passivation effect of δ-FAPbI3, while the decrease is due to the presence of metallic lead (Pb0) (Fig. 2d). As a result, PCE initially increased and then decreased (Fig. 5e).

In order to gain further insight into the effect of GA on device performance, time-resolved PL (TRPL), light intensity-dependent J–V, dark J–V, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted. The TRPL curves shown in Fig. 6a can be fitted with a biexponential equation:43Y = Y0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), in which a faster decay component (τ1) refers to defect-induced nonradiative recombination while a slower decay component (τ2) relates to radiative recombination.16,44 The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S4.† A longer average carrier lifetime (τave) for the 0.1 GA film (14.2 ns) than that of the w/o GA film (11.1 ns) was observed. This confirms that the introduction of GA enhances carrier lifetime, which is in agreement with a previous study.45 Strikingly, the 0.2 GA film shows a remarkable carrier lifetime of 22.7 ns, which is twice as much as that of the w/o GA film. The unexpected prolongation of carrier lifetime can be explained by the suppressed nonradiative recombination due to the passivation effect of the formed 1D δ-FAPbI3.38 However, a further increase of the x value leads to a decrease of the average carrier lifetime due to the presence of metallic lead (Pb0) (Fig. 2d) and a large quantity of grain boundaries (Fig. 4d–f).46,47Fig. 6b shows Jscversus light intensity based on w/o GA, 0.2 GA and 0.6 GA perovskite films. According to the power law equation:48Jsc ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity and α is a factor related to bimolecular recombination, and all devices revealed a linear correlation with the α value close to unity, indicating negligible bimolecular recombination.49 However, the most ideal α value (0.913) for the 0.2 GA film suggests a reduced trap density.50 Besides, the Vocversus light intensity results shown in Fig. 6c reveal that the device based on the 0.2 GA film exhibits the smallest slope at 1.23 KT/q. Previous studies concluded that a deviation between slope and KT/q indicates trap-assisted recombination, which is one of the main reasons for the loss of Voc.47,51 Therefore, the smallest slope suggests that the trap-assisted recombination process is effectively suppressed in the 0.2 GA film. Further, the trap density of the perovskite films was studied using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. Fig. 6d shows the dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. The trap density (Nt) is determined using the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) based on the equation Nt = 2VTFLεrε0/qL2, where εr is the relative dielectric constant for the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, q is the elemental charge and L is the thickness of the perovskite film.52,53 It is found that while the 0.2 GA film has a smaller VTFL (0.129 V) compared with the w/o GA film (0.177 V), the 0.6 GA film has the largest VTFL of 0.292 V, indicating a significantly reduced trap density in the 0.2 GA film, which can be attributed to its morphology and the δ-FAPbI3 passivation effect, as discussed earlier.54 Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results (Fig. S5†) indicate that the 0.2 GA film has the largest recombination resistance. These results suggest that the introduction of moderate GA can not only enhances carrier life time, but also reduce trap density, and suppress charge recombination, leading to enhanced device performance.

The J–V curves of the reference w/o GA film and 0.2 GA film based devices presented in Fig. 7a reveal a PCE of 18.45% with a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 22.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 76.3% for the reference device. In comparison, the 0.2 GA film based device shows overall enhancement in Voc (1.12 V), Jsc (23.1 mA cm−2) and FF (78.4%), with a PCE of 20.29%, which is the highest efficiency reported for GA doped perovskites, as concluded in Table 2. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 7b, where the 0.2 GA film based device shows higher EQE in the effective region. The integrated Jsc is in good agreement with the measured value. Fig. 7c shows the steady-state Jsc and PCE at the maximum power point as shown in Fig. 7a. The PCEs of the devices based on w/o GA and 0.2 GA films stabilize at 18.1% and 20.05% with a Jsc of 21.8 and 22.7 mA cm−2, respectively, which are close to the values obtained from the J–V curves. Additionally, Fig. S6† shows the J–V curves from reverse and forward scans. It is notable that the 0.2 GA film based device has negligible hysteresis, which is attributed to its film morphology and the passivation effect of δ-FAPbI3.37,39

The stability test results acquired after exposing the bare devices to an environment of 25 °C and 25% humidity (Fig. 7d) indicate an improved long-term stability for GA doped devices. The corresponding UV-vis absorption and XRD results (Fig. S7†) reveal that the reference (w/o GA) film is more easily decomposed. The enhanced stability of GA doped perovskites is attributed to the incorporation of the large GA cation providing additional hydrogen bonds, which have been proved essential for a stable perovskite framework.55 Further, thermal stability was studied by exposing the bare devices to an environment of 80 °C and 40% humidity (Fig. 7e). It can be observed that the 0.6 GA and 0.2 GA film based devices retain over 70% and 60% of their initial PCEs after 60 days, respectively, whereas the reference device only retains 30% of its initial PCE. This provides evidence for the enhanced thermal stability of the GA doped films, which is in agreement with the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results (Fig. S8†). Besides, the slightly higher stability of the 0.6 GA film over the 0.2 GA film is mainly attributed to the stronger passivation effect of 1D δ-FAPbI3 and 2D FAGAPbI4. In addition, light-soaking stability of the devices under AM 1.5G illumination has been evaluated in the ambient environment. As shown in Fig. 7f, the PCE of the reference device decreased rapidly to 75% of its initial value after light soaking for 300 min, while the 0.2 GA film based device only decreased by 10%, revealing a superior light-soaking stability.
Conclusions
In summary, a quadruple cation based CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite was developed. The crystalline phase, chemical composition, morphology, optoelectronic properties, and stability were systematically investigated. By finely tuning the content of GA, a δ-FAPbI3/CsFAMA1−xGAx (1D/3D) perovskite with longer carrier life time, less trap density, and reduced charge recombination was obtained. Moreover, this novel 1D/3D perovskite demonstrated improvement of long-term, thermal and light-soaking stability. The corresponding device exhibited a PCE of 20.29%, which is the highest efficiency reported for GA doped perovskites.
Experimental section
Materials
The SnO2 colloid was purchased from Alfa Aesar (tin(IV) oxide). Methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and cesium iodide (CsI) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was purchased from Dyesol Ltd. (Queanbeyan, Australia). Lead iodide (PbI2, 99%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%), guanidinium bromide (GABr, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), and chlorobenzene (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Device fabrication
Devices were fabricated on FTO substrates (15 Ω sq−1) with dimensions of 20 × 20 mm. The substrates were thoroughly cleaned with a detergent solution, acetone, and isopropanol, and finally treated in a plasma cleaner for 5 min. Then, a layer of SnO2 (purchased from Alfa Aesar) was deposited in ambient air as the electron transport layer at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen filled glove box.
To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.05 M), MABr (0.2(1 − x) M), GABr (0.2x M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) were first dissolved in anhydrous DMF:DMSO 4:1 (v:v) for FA/MA/GA solution, where x ranges from 0 to 1. Then an appropriate amount of CsI (1.5 M in DMSO) was added to the FA/MA/GA solution for the target quadruple cation based CsFAMA1−xGAx perovskite precursor. Before use, all perovskite precursors were stirred at room temperature for 3 hours in a glove box and filtered with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter.
Then, 60 μL of the prepared perovskite precursor was dropped on the substrate and spin-coated at 600 rpm for 5 s and then at 4000 rpm for 40 s. During the second procedure, 150 μL of toluene was dropped on the spinning substrate 15 s before the program ended. The resulting films were transferred to a hot plate at 120 °C and dried for 15 min. Subsequently, a traditional spiro-OMeTAD layer, which consisted of 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μL of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile), and 1 mL of chlorobenzene, was deposited on the perovskite films as the hole transport layer. Finally, an approximately 80 nm thick Au electrode was fabricated using a shadow mask under high vacuum by thermal evaporation.

J–V characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured using a solar simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A Class AAA, 64023A) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel, USA) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated to AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) by using a reference Si solar cell (Newport). The devices were masked with a metal aperture of 0.06 cm−2 to define the active area. The J–V measurements were all conducted in ambient air with a scanning protocol of 1.2 to −0.05 V for the reverse scan (−0.05 to 1.2 V for the forward scan) with a 24 mV voltage step.
Stability measurements
For long-term stability, w/o GA and 0.2 GA films or corresponding unencapsulated devices were stored in a dry cabinet with 25% humidity at 25 °C in the dark. The UV-vis absorption and XRD of the films were measured every 7 days. The J–V curves of the devices were recorded every day. Thermal stability was studied by exposing the devices to the ambient environment of 80 °C and 40% humidity and measuring the J–V curves every day. For light-soaking stability test, unencapsulated devices were exposed to continuous 1 sun illumination generated by an LED lamp without UV light. The J–V curves of the devices were recorded every 5 or 10 min. Between each measurement, the cells were maintained at the maximum power point.
Other characterization
The XRD patterns (2θ scans) were obtained on a Bruker Advanced D8 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation. The compositions and chemical environments of the films were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI Model 5802). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis-DRS, Shimadzu UV-3600) was used to collect the absorbance spectra of the perovskite films. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301pc with an excitation wavelength of 523 nm. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 7100F) was used to study the surface and cross-section morphology. Grazing incident XRD (GIXRD) patterns were obtained by using a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with the incidence angle ranging from 0.5° to 7°. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured under a constant white light supplied by an array of white-light emitting diodes. The excitation beam from a 300 W xenon lamp was focused through a double-monochromator and chopped at 10 Hz. The monochromatic light intensity for the measurement was calibrated using a reference silicon photodiode. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured using a PL system (DW-PLE03). TGA analysis was conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/DSC 1 STARe System). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium Zahner, Germany). A bias of the open-circuit voltage was applied during the measurement at frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 1 Hz.
