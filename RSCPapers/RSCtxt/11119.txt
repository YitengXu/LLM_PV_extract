In this paper, we calculate the crystal structures, optical properties and carrier mobility for three phases of non-toxic perovskite halide CH3NH3SnCl3 by applying density functional theory with the nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) correlation. The results show that CH3NH3SnCl3 has superior performance in terms of its optical absorption coefficient, which reaches as high as 105 cm−1 and has proven itself to be a perfect solar light harvester. Most importantly, the results of intrinsic carrier mobility of CH3NH3SnCl3 show that the electron mobility of the triclinic phase can achieve a large magnitude of 1700 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is mainly due to the small effective mass. We ascribe the superior photoelectric property to the ferroelectricity, which may be caused by the distorted octahedral SnCl6−.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), owing to their low cost, flexibility and ease of fabrication, have become the most promising third-generation photovoltaic device.1,2 However, dye degradation, leakage of the solvent, and solvent evaporation bring about some development problems, which prevent the photovoltaic application of DSCs. Currently, the hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) solar cells have replaced the DSCs as promising materials in the optical absorption coefficient.3–8
CH3NH3PbI3 have a low photo-conversion efficiency of 3.8% in liquid DSCs as sensitizing materials.4,9 Recently, the efficiency value has reached to 15% as the perovskite-based solar cells have been investigated by some researchers.10,11 Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3), is considered as a promising material for ssDSCs with an expected photo conversion efficiency of 20%.5,12,13 Many researchers have reported the high power conversion of the ABX3 hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite experimentally and theoretically, respectively. Experimentally, many technologies have been developed to make different sandwich-type absorbers to obtain the direct band gap, large absorption coefficient and high carrier mobility.14,15 Burschka et al. studied solution-processed photovoltaics with unprecedented power conversion efficiency and high stability by developing the two-step method.10 The PbS/CH3NH3PbI3 quantum dots have been fabricated to be used in high performance QD-sensitized solar cells by Seo et al.16 Theoretically, the physical properties (e.g., electronic structures and optical properties) of some hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have been calculated to explain the high performance of solar energy conversion.10,17,18 The electron and hole effective masses, optical properties and carrier mobility of CH3NH3SnX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have been investigated by some researchers.16,19–21 Zhu et al. have investigated the optical absorption coefficient of the CH3NH3PbI3 film.22 Jing et al. have investigated the crystal structure and optical properties of orthorhombic CH3NH3SnCl3.23 Hao et al. reported the photovoltaics of tetragonal CH3NH3SnI3.24
As we know, lead poisoning is a type of metal poisoning and a medical condition in humans and vertebrates, caused by increased levels of the heavy metal lead in the body.25 However, all of these advanced materials contain the toxic element lead, which would eventually hinder the commercialization of the products based on these materials. It is necessary for us to look for obvious alternative candidate elements. The hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite CH3NH3SnCl3 may be a kind of alternative material in the field of solar cells. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the tin iodide system because it is promising as a source of solution-processable electronic materials. Replacement of Pb by the more environment-friendly Sn would facilitate the large uptake of perovskite-based photovoltaics. However, optical properties and the carrier mobility of this material, which are key to the photovoltaic performance, are relatively little understood. To our knowledge, the only photovoltaic application of Sn-based perovskites is the use of CsSnI3 as a solid hole transporter in the DSCs.26 More importantly, the above discussed experimental and calculated work are mainly concentrated on the macroscopic ways of tuning the carrier mobility and absorption efficiency experimentally, which still lack the microscopic theoretical explanations.
Therefore, in this report, we perform DFT calculations with the inclusion of vdW correction on the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the three phases and study the carrier transport properties using approaches upon the deformation potential theory of CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskites.27 Through first-principles calculation, we demonstrate that the optical absorption coefficient and carrier mobility of CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskites can reach large magnitudes of 105 cm−1 and 102 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. We investigate the effective masses of holes and electrons of the three phases. The results show that the three phases have relatively small effective masses. Therefore, all above results have proven CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskites to be perfect solar light harvesters. Moreover, the triclinic phase of CH3NH3SnCl3 has more superior performance in perovskite solar cells than the cubic and monoclinic phases. Furthermore, the relation between structure, electronic, optical properties and carrier mobility should be fully investigated during these phase changes.
2. Details and methods
The calculation details and some crystal structures of CH3NH3SnCl3 are presented in the ESI.† CH3NH3SnCl3 shows successive phase transitions from cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic and monoclinic to triclinic phase by cooling.19–21,28–30 The complicated phase transition behaviors are attributed to disordering of (CH3NH3)+ cations and the distortions of (SnCl3)−, which may have significant impact on the electronic property. Therefore, a nonlocal density functional, the vdW-DF31 correlation is critical to provide appropriate descriptions of the interaction between the organic and the inorganic parts, as implemented in VASP by Klimes et al.32–34 In this paper, we calculate the electronic structure, effective masses and optical properties by first-principles with the nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) correlation of the cubic, monoclinic and triclinic CH3NH3SnCl3.35–37 Moreover, theory predicts the carrier mobility by deformation potential theory of the three phases.27
We calculated the effective mass by fitting the band edge according to the following equation: (1)where the k is the wave vector and the ε(k) represents the eigenvalues of energy band.
The spherical averaged effective mass of hole or electron is given by: (2)where Si are defined as the inverse of the effective mass of the i principal direction. S1 = 1/m*[1 0 0], S2 = 1/m*[0 1 0], S3 = 1/m*[0 0 1]. The φ and θ refer to the polar angle and azimuthal angle in spherical coordinates, respectively.
The optical properties are calculated by eqn (3): (3)where α is the absorption coefficient, ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the dielectric functions dependent on the optical frequency ω.
The carrier mobility and charge transport behaviors of CH3NH3SnCl3 are assessed based on the deformation potential theory27 according to the following equation: (4)
in which ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, e is the element charge, Cii is the elastic matrix constant, m* is the effective mass of charge, kB is the Boltzmannn constant, T is the temperature, and E1 is the deformation potential (DP) constant, which is defined as the energy shift of the band energy position (ΔE) with respect to a small lattice dilation (Δl) along a lattice (l0) direction, i.e., E1 = ΔE/(Δl/l0) respectively.38,39 Room temperature (T = 300 K) is used in the calculation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure of CH3NH3SnCl3
The first-principle calculations with CH3NH3SnCl3 are presented: the structure and electronic properties are analyzed and related to the particular choice of both the Cl halogen and the Sn embedded in the corner-sharing SnCl6 octahedra network. For CH3NH3SnCl3, each Sn atom coordinates to six Cl atoms, with four Cl atoms in the equatorial and two Cl atoms in the apical direction. The optimized structures of the three phases are depicted in Fig. 1. Different phases are considered, and the structures of the three phases under different temperatures is elucidated. The complicated phases transition behaviors of the CH3NH3SnCl3 structure is due to the distortions of (SnCl3−) octahedra and the disordering of (CH3NH3+) cations at finite temperature.28–30,32 We study three phases of CH3NH3SnCl3. The cubic phase at high temperature (463 K), the triclinic phase at room temperature (297 K) and the monoclinic phase at low temperature (<318 K). For cubic phase, the Sn–Cl–Sn bonds are all in a straight line in the equatorial direction and apical direction, respectively. This shows that the C–N bonds direction in the methylammonium ions are identified to distribute along the bc plane, ab plane or ac plane. The results show that the cubic phase has an undistorted perovskite structure. For the monoclinic phase, it is obvious that the Sn–Cl–Sn bonds are in a straight line in the equatorial direction and a broken line in the apical direction, which implies that the structure has changed. The orientation of C–N bonds exhibits a slight deflection from the ab plane, ac plane or bc plane and they look a little messy. For the triclinic phase, the Sn–Cl–Sn bonds are all in a broken line in the equatorial and apical direction. The C–N bonds direction are similar to that in the monoclinic phase. We can see that the C–N bonds direction in methylammonium ions and Sn–Cl–Sn bonds in each unit cell of CH3NH3SnCl3 have different distributions. For the three phases of C–N bonds direction, it was found that the C–N direction of rotation is related to temperature. The phase change of CH3NH3SnCl3 is mainly due to the strong dynamic movement of the organic base. The orientation of the C–N axis in the MA cations has rotational freedom that leads to a high degree of disorder. Previous work reveals that methylammonium ion (here abbreviated to MA+) distributions along the different principal directions play a vital role in the stability and electronic structures.18 Thus, the weak force between organic and inorganic molecule must be considered in our computation by implying the nonlocal vdW density functional.33 Moreover, for the polyhedron, the particular distortion and tiling SnCl6 octahedra can be clearly described (Fig. 1). The SnCl6 octahedra structure exhibits a coaxial octahedron rotation along the same direction. For the cubic phase, the SnCl6 structural unit has perfect cubic symmetry. By lowering the temperature, the tilting and distortion of SnCl6 octahedra create the local potential wells for the cations, suppressing the dynamical disordering of (CH3NH3)+ cations. These graphs reveal that octahedral SnCl6− (ref. 1) distortion is more severe than that of corresponding CH3NH3PbI3.18 The detailed tilting and distortion of SnCl6 octahedra may induce the ferroelectricity, which might play a key role in the efficient separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Researchers have shown that the distorted octahedra may drive the ferroelectricity.40 All the results show that the triclinic phase is the most distorted structure. It is really an interesting issue for us to investigate and tune the effective masses, absorption efficiency and carrier mobility of the triclinic phase compared with the cubic and monoclinic phases.

The left is a side view, and the right panel shows the structure in polyhedron diagrams (grey: tin; green: chlorine; blue: carbon; brown: nitrogen; pink: hydrogen). 
The Sn–Cl bond lengths and angles of different structures are calculated and shown in Table 1. It is interesting that both the bond lengths and angles are greatly affected by the phases and the distribution of the MA+. For the high temperature of the cubic phase, the calculated bond lengths of Sn–Cl are about 2.53–3.41 Å in the equatorial direction and 2.61–3.29 Å in the apical direction. The corresponding Sn–Cl–Sn angles are 166°–173° in the equatorial direction and 172° in the apical direction, respectively. The direction is rather uniform and with a regular untilted octahedra network. When the structure changes from cubic to monoclinic phase, SnCl6 octahedra are not regular, which leads the Sn–Cl bonds to be nonuniform; the SnCl3− (ref. 1) anions form a trigonal pyramid (Sn–Cl bonds 2.57 Å, 2.62 Å, and 2.73 Å) having three long interactions (Sn–Cl distances: 3.24 Å, 3.27 Å and 3.41 Å); the Cl–Sn–Cl angles are 147°–169° in the equatorial directions and 145° in the apical direction. For the triclinic phase, the calculated Sn–Cl bond lengths are 2.56–3.28 Å and 2.56–3.31 Å in the equatorial and apical directions, respectively, while the calculated bond angles of Cl–Sn–Cl are 146°–173° and 153°–160° in the equatorial and apical directions, respectively. The optimized lattice constants of CH3NH3SnCl3 are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The lattice constants of the three phases are larger than the experimental values.41,42 It is widely known that for semiconductors, ionic solids, and metals one usually overestimates the lattice constant by applying the PBE functional.43 Moreover, a different bond length and bond angle can lead to a change in the lattice constant.

3.2. Electronic structure
The band structures of the three phases are shown in Fig. 2. For the cubic phase, it exhibits the direct band gap at the M (0, 0.5, 0.5) point, but for two other phases, the calculated direct band gap locates at the Г (0, 0, 0) point of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for the cubic phase, the band structure of the valence band has a relatively flat slope along Г–Y–M, but this becomes a relatively large slope along M–Г. The zero energy is arbitrarily set to the valence band maximum (VBM). The calculated band gap from cubic to triclinic phase is 3.14, 3.36 and 2.94 eV, respectively (Table 2). The band gap of the triclinic phase is smaller than that of the cubic and monoclinic phases. The result also predicts that the triclinic phase is the most distorted phase of the three structures. The results show that the interaction between the inorganic matrix and MA+ affect the electronic structure of CH3NH3SnCl3. It indicates that the band gap of CH3NH3SnCl3 is greatly affected by not only the phases but also the distribution of the MA+. However, it is obvious that the band gap of CH3NH3SnCl3 is larger than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (Table 2).5 Some researchers have reported the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 is about 1.6 eV.44 Although the band-edge performance of CH3NH3SnCl3 lags behind that of CH3NH3PbI3, it does not contain the poisonous lead. Therefore, we can reduce the band gap of CH3NH3SnCl3 by raising the pressure in our next work, so as to improve its performance with respect to its band-edge. This is the reason that our group has calculated the band gap of CH3NH3GeCl3 through increasing pressure in the previous work.45 It shows that the band gap can be reduced through increasing the pressure. Moreover, because of this the band gaps of CH3NH3SnI3 and CH3NH3SnBr3 reached 1.7 eV and 2.1 eV, respectively.23 Hao and co-workers have found that the band-gap of CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx is between 1.7 eV to 2.1 eV.24 The chlorine can displacement doping by iodine or bromine degenerated into the CH3NH3SnCl3−xIx and CH3NH3SnCl3−xBrx should be done in our next work, which reduce the gap to improve the performance. The effective masses of electron and hole are calculated in Table 2. The effective masses of CH3NH3SnCl3 from cubic to triclinic phase at direct band gap points along three principal directions, i.e., [1 0 0], [0 1 0] and [0 0 1] directions, by eqn (1) as the effective masses of carriers are relative to the slope of the band-edge. Obviously, the effective masses are changed by the different phases. The calculated results (Table 2) reveal that the hole and electron effective masses of the three principal directions are anisotropic. For the triclinic and monoclinic phases, the effective masses of carriers at the Г point along the (1 0 0) direction are significantly larger than those of the (0 1 0) and (0 0 1) directions. It might be reasonable to conclude that the strong anisotropy in hole and electron effective masses are mainly caused by its heavy carriers along the (1 0 0) direction. For cubic CH3NH3SnCl3, it shows that the heavy electron and hole along the (0 1 0) direction lead to the strong anisotropy in the effective masses of carriers. The spherical averaged effective mass is calculated using eqn (2). The values for the hole and electron are given in Table 2. It shows that the spherical averaged effective masses of electron and hole decreases from the monoclinic to the triclinic phase. The results show that the triclinic phase has smaller effective masses of the electron and hole than cubic and monoclinic phases. The effective masses of CH3NH3SnCl3 are compared with CH3NH3SnBr3 and CH3NH3SnI3, as listed in Table 2. To our surprise, the three phases of CH3NH3SnCl3 have smaller effective masses with a larger band gap than CH3NH3SnI3 and CH3NH3SnBr3. This anomalous result may be caused by the distorted octahedral SnCl6−, which is derived from the ferroelectricity. Some researchers have investigated the ferroelectricity of CsGeCl3 due to the distortion of GeCl6−.43 Thus, it may be that the ferroelectricity of CH3NH3SnCl3 corrects the imperfections and improves the efficiency of separation of electron and hole, which generate smaller effective masses. Moreover, the extremely low effective masses are much different from the previous report by Jing et al.23 On the one hand, the researchers calculated the orthorhombic phase of CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskite. However, in the paper, we calculated the cubic, monoclinic and triclinic phases of CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskite. The previous report has calculated the effective masses of electron and hole in the different phases CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites.44 It is obvious that the effective masses exhibit great changes in the different phases of Pb-based perovskites. Generally, the different structures have a different space group to cause different results for the effective masses of electron and hole. On the other hand, our group has calculated the effective masses of monoclinic, orthorhombic and trigonal phases of CH3NH3GeCl3 using the same method.45 The effective masses of monoclinic, orthorhombic and trigonal phases of CH3NH3GeCl3 also exhibit a great change in the three principle directions. Therefore, we believe that our approach is feasible.

Further insight can be obtained by analyzing the total density of states (DOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) for the three phases, the DOS and PDOS are shown in Fig. 2. The DOS of the three structures is in black. The PDOS reveals that the organic cation only contributes to the flat bands, whereas no cation contribution to the dispersed bands of the near band-gap region comes out. In these graphs, the contribution of the Sn atoms to the total DOS is shown, and the Sn-s and Sn-p valence orbitals are considered. Similarly, the contribution of the halogen (Cl) is represented in Fig. 2. From the electronic densities of states of CH3NH3SnCl3, they are more or less similar to each other. The results reveal that the valence band maximum (VBM) for the three phases is mainly the contribution of the p orbitals of the Cl atom and partly the contribution of the s orbital of Sn, while the p orbitals of the Sn mainly contribute to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Such results indicate that the CBM and VBM can effectively separate the electron and hole once the electrons on Cl-p and Sn-s (VBM) are excited to the Sn-p orbitals (CBM) under the light irradiation. The spatial distribution of the CBM and VBM can effectively enhance the lifetime of the electron and hole.
3.3. Optical properties
Beside the special electronic structure, CH3NH3SnCl3 has an excellent ability of light absorption in the visible zone. The optical absorption coefficients of the three phases are shown in Fig. 3. We focus on the optical properties of three phases by eqn (3). From the monoclinic to the triclinic phase, the shapes of the three structures are quite similar. The absorption coefficient curve moves from the violet spectrum to the red spectrum exhibiting a red shift phenomenon. From Fig. 4, it is clearly that the triclinic phase has the more superior absorption performance than that of the cubic and monoclinic phases. For the triclinic phase, the optical absorption edge is 550 nm, which is caused by the radiative transition from Cl 3p states and Sn 5s states to Sn 5p states. This wavelength is in the visible light range. Thus, CH3NH3SnCl3 can absorb light at less than 550 nm. The absorption of the triclinic phase is significantly intense, which indicates that CH3NH3SnCl3 has superiority in utilizing solar energy. For the optical absorption spectrum, the absorption coefficient cures are all located in the violet region, which has little visible absorption range. This result may be attributed to the larger band gap. Our group has calculated the absorption efficiency curve of CH3NH3GeCl3 through increasing pressure.45 The result shows that it can improve the absorption performance through pressure. Therefore, it is important to improve the absorption performance of CH3NH3SnCl3 by increasing pressure in our next work. From Fig. S1 (ESI†), all the dynamical dielectric response functions of the three phases are calculated by applying the PBE method. The shape of the dielectric function curves are quite close to each other for the three phases, corresponding to the absorption coefficient spectrum.

3.4. Mobilities of electrons and holes
We choose the three phases and make theoretical predictions on the carrier mobility. Charge transport properties in these new perovskite materials have become the center of interests, because of their strong light absorption performance. Table 3 shows the carrier mobility of the electron and hole at the Г-point of the Brillouin zone. The results are calculated by eqn (4). To calculate the DP constant E1 and the elastic matrix constant Cii, additional band structures are calculated at lattice constants of 0.990l0, 0.995l0, 1.005l0 and 1.010l0 so as to perform finite differentiation to achieve both E1 and C. All of the calculated results of carrier mobility, the deformation potential, elastic constant and effective masses for the three phases are shown in Table 3, and the band edge positions of the VB and CB with respect to the lattice dilation Δl/l0 along the three directions are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

The theoretically calculated carrier mobilities are around 30–1700 (cm2 V−1 s−1) for the three phases. Our group have calculated the averaged carrier mobility of orthorhombic CH3NH3SnI3 (1700 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is according to the previous experimental values (2320 cm2 V−1 s−1).21 Therefore, our calculation method is reliable. Certainly, the carrier mobility of CH3NH3SnCl3 is smaller than that of CH3NH3PbI3.46 On the one hand, the band-edge and optical absorption performance of CH3NH3SnCl3 are inferior to the CH3NH3PbI3. On the other hand, from the eqn (4), it should be noticed that the carrier mobility anisotropy of electron and hole is mainly due to the effective masses (Table 2). Our group have calculated the effective masses of CH3NH3GeCl3 with changing pressure; the results show that the effective mass can be reduced through increasing pressure.45 Therefore, it is essential to reduce the effective mass through increasing pressure in our next work, which will improve the carrier mobility of CH3NH3SnCl3. The carrier mobility of triclinic phase in (0 1 0) and (0 0 1) directions are larger than monoclinic and cubic phases (Table 3) because of the small effective masses. Generally speaking, the lower mobility is due to the heavier effective masses. However, the small carrier mobility in the (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) directions of the cubic phase and in the (0 0 1) direction of the monoclinic phase are due to the small elastic matrix constant. Moreover, for the triclinic phase, the electron mobility is higher than that of the hole. We analyze the conduction band minimum (CBM), finding it is mainly from Sn-5p (amount to 80%) and Cl-3p (20%) states and the VBM is composed of Cl-3p (80%) and Sn-5s (30%) states. The deformation potential of the hole is larger than that of the electron. We investigate the DP constant by analyzing the band-edge. The band-edge upon stretching is from the change of site energy. The site energy of VBM decrease is mainly due to the Sn-5s and Cl-3p anti-bonding interaction, and the CBM is influenced by the decrease from Sn-5p and Cl-3p anti-bonding. From Table 3, the CBM site energy is relatively difficult to change upon dilation with respect to the VBM. The DP constant is a feature of the coupling strength of the hole and electron to the acoustic phonon.47 The hole scattered by the acoustic phonon is more strong than the electron. Therefore, the electron has a higher mobility than the hole, despite the carriers (electron and hole) along the band-edge having similar effective masses.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we calculate the structural, electronic, optical properties, and theoretically predict the carrier mobilities of the cubic, monoclinic and triclinic phases in CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskite. The results suggest that the carrier mobility of triclinic phase in the (0 1 0) and (0 0 1) directions have higher values than those of the cubic and monoclinic phases, which is mainly due to the small effective masses. The phase transition from the cubic to triclinic phase derives from the different torsion and arrangement of the SnCl6 octahedra. The calculated direct band gap of methylammonium tin halides ranges from 2.94 to 3.36 eV. It shows that the CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskite has a large band gap with small effective masses of electron and hole, which may derive from the ferroelectricity. The PDOS reveals that the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly the contribution of the p orbitals of the Cl atom and partly the contribution of the s orbital of Sn, while the p orbitals of the Sn mainly contribute to the conduction band minimum (CBM). The light absorption coefficient shows that the triclinic phase exhibits the most strong absorption performance, which is consistent with the same ordering of the band gap change. Although the band-edges, optical properties, effective masses, and carrier mobility performances of CH3NH3SnCl3 lag behind CH3NH3PbI3, we can improve these performances through increasing pressure or doping. Therefore, our next work will improve the optical coefficient and carrier mobility of CH3NH3SnCl3 through pressure.
