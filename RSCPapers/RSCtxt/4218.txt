The pyridine group can endow these polymers with solubility in methanol (MeOH) in the presence of trace acetic acid (AcOH), which is beneficial for the realization of PSC fabrication by low-cost solution processing without interfacial mixing. In addition, the pyridine group can not only build interfacial dipoles at the CIL/cathode interfaces, leading to reduced cathode work functions and improved open-circuit voltages, but also n-dope the fullerene acceptors, which decreases the interfacial energy loss at the cathode side. As a result, for conventional PSCs based on poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), these resulting polymers can increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5.38% (without any CIL) and 5.50% (with MeOH/AcOH treatment) to 6.54%–6.97%. For the inverted PSCs based on poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7):PC71BM, these resulting polymers can improve the PCE from 3.64% (without any CIL) and 4.25% (with MeOH/AcOH treatment) to 7.21%–7.96%. Therefore, these pyridine-functionalized polymers are promising candidates as CILs for high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have become significantly promising candidates for light-to-electricity conversion, as a result of their mechanical flexibility, light weight and potential for large-area and low-cost fabrication by low-temperature solution processing methodologies.1,2 Typically, the basic device architecture of a BHJ PSC adopts a “sandwich structure” comprised of a light-harvesting blend active layer sandwiched between the hole-collecting anode and electron-collecting cathode. With the aim of improving the PSC performance, significant efforts have been devoted to developing novel electron donors and acceptors,3–5 interfacial engineering6,7 and device optimization.8,9 So far, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been boosted to over 12% for both single-junction10–12 and tandem13,14 PSCs.
Interfacial engineering, which means introducing anode or cathode interfacial layers (AILs or CILs) between the active layer and anode/cathode to improve the interfacial contact, has been widely proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the photovoltaic performance, including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and thus, the PCE.6,7,15–17 For CILs, general metal or metal oxide cathodes (e.g., Al,18 Ag,19 indium tin oxide [ITO]20 and so on) often possess high work functions (WFs) and build unfavorable energy level alignments at the cathode side that induce small built-in potentials (Vbi) across the devices, which are not beneficial for performance improvement. In order to address these problems, inorganic materials (e.g., LiF,21 Cs2CO3,22 ZnOx23 and TiOx24) have been preliminarily used as CILs to modify the cathode WFs and promote electron transport and extraction. However, these inorganic species exhibit intrinsic disadvantages, such as incompatibility with organic active layers, surface adsorption of oxygen and sensitivity to UV irradiation.2,25
Water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs), composed of conjugated backbones and polar functional groups, have been successfully demonstrated to work as effective CILs for BHJ PSCs.26 Their conjugated backbones provide them with good optoelectronic properties and the polar functional groups endow them with versatile water/alcohol solubility.27,28 Their unique solubility in high polar solvents allows for the fabrication of multilayer devices by solution processing methods without interface erosion, since the adjacent active layers are usually only soluble in low polar solvents. Furthermore, the interfacial dipole effects induced by the interactions between polar functional groups and metal cathodes may lower the cathode WFs, and thus enlarge the Vbi across the devices and increase the Voc of PSCs.15,27 In addition, previous studies indicated that the lone-pair electrons or anions existing in the polar functional groups may n-dope fullerene derivative acceptors at the active layer/CIL interfaces, subsequently increasing the electron mobility of blended active layers and reducing the interfacial energy loss.27,29,30
Among the reported WSCPs, polyfluorene (PF) derivatives have attracted the most attention because of their merits in facile synthesis, good film-forming abilities and large band gaps (Eg).15,31 Various polar pendant groups (e.g., amino,32 quaternary ammonium,33 phosphate,26 carboxyl34 and zwitterionic17,35 groups) can be feasibly introduced into PFs through facile alkylation and side chain modification in fluorene moieties. Interestingly, PFs, as versatile CILs, have greatly promoted PSC performance. For instance, the most famous alcohol-soluble PF derivative, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)], has been extensively used as a CIL in BHJ PSCs and significantly enhanced the photovoltaic performance.30,32,36–40
It is well known that amino groups can endow WSCPs with excellent cathode modification properties.15,41 The working mechanisms of amino groups may include forming interfacial dipoles with cathodes and n-doping fullerene acceptors via lone-pair electron-induced charge transfer processes.27,42 Alternatively, since pyridine groups have similar chemical properties to amino groups (e.g., both Lewis bases), we proposed that pyridine-functionalized WSCPs may also possess efficient cathode modification abilities for PSCs. In this work, we presented the development of a novel class of PF-based WSCPs with pyridine groups functionalizing the side chains of fluorene scaffolds, and demonstrated their applications as CILs in both conventional and inverted BHJ PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 exhibits the synthetic routes for the relevant monomers and polymers. 2,7-Dibromo-9,9-bis(6-(pyridin-4-yl-oxy)hexyl)fluorene (1) was given by the simple reaction between 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis(6-bromohexyl)fluorene43 and pyridin-4-ol in the presence of anhydrous K2CO3. Another monomer, 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-bis(6-(pyridin-4-yl-oxy)hexyl)fluorene (2), was synthesized by reacting 1 with n-butyllithium at −78 °C under nitrogen, followed by quenching with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane, and the crude product was purified through recrystallization from acetone. A palladium(0)-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction was used for copolymerization between 1 and either monomer 2, 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene (3),44 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)fluorene (4)45 or 1,4-phenyldiboronic acid (5) to obtain the target polymers poly[(9,9-bis(6-(pyridin-4-yl-oxy)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFPy), poly[(9,9-bis(6-(pyridin-4-yl-oxy)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFPy-FO), poly[(9,9-bis(6-(pyridin-4-yl-oxy)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)fluorene)] (PFPy-FEO) and poly[(9,9-bis(6-(pyridin-4-yl-oxy)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-1,4-phenylene] (PFPy-P). Their chemical structures were verified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S4†). The number average molecular weights (Mn), estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent, are 10300 (with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.5) for PFPy, 12500 (PDI = 1.5) for PFPy-FO, 11700 (PDI = 1.4) for PFPy-FEO and 10100 (PDI = 1.6) for PFPy-P, respectively. These polymers are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, toluene and chloroform, and are partly soluble in methanol (MeOH) in the presence of trace acetic acid (AcOH) due to the interaction between the pyridine group and AcOH.17 Therefore, these resulting polymers offer an opportunity as CILs to fabricate multilayer PSCs by solution processing without interfacial mixing/erosion.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of these polymers were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 1. For the TGA, the testing temperature was ramped from 30 to 650 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. All the polymers possess good thermal stabilities and the 5% weight loss temperatures are 346, 303, 323 and 281 °C for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively. Their high thermal stabilities are beneficial for CIL applications in PSCs.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the resulting polymers in THF and in film form are displayed in Fig. 2, and the related data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption peaks of PFPy, PFPy-FO and PFPy-FEO in THF are located at 390, 389 and 381 nm, respectively. By contrast, PFPy-P shows a blue-shifted absorption band with a dominant peak at 368 nm. These similar trends can also be observed in their corresponding PL spectra. Specifically, the emission bands of PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P in THF are located at 412, 404, 416 and 388 nm, respectively. The optical properties of the polymers in the solid film were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. As compared to their absorption spectra in solution, their absorption spectra in film form display broader and red-shifted profiles, with absorption maxima at 399, 399, 383 and 375 nm for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively, suggesting the intermolecular aggregation of these polymers in film form. Alternatively, their PL emission peaks are located at 417, 423, 427 and 410 nm for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively. Note that the absorption and PL peaks of PFPy-P in film form are also blue-shifted relative to the other three polymers, due to the smaller conjugation length of phenyl compared to the fluorene unit, which can increase the optical band gap (Eoptg) of PFPy-P. The Eoptg values of these polymers were estimated from the absorption onset in film, with values of 2.88, 2.87, 2.90 and 2.97 eV for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The oxidation potential (E1/2) of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was measured to be 0.43 V to the saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode under the same experimental conditions. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of the polymer films were characterized to be 1.11, 1.08, 1.08 and 1.29 V for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively. As a result, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (EHOMO) of PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P were calculated to be −5.48, −5.45, −5.45 and −5.66 eV, respectively, according to the empirical equation of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80 − 0.43) (eV).46 In addition, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (ELUMO) estimated from the Eoptg and EHOMO (ELUMO = Eoptg + EHOMO) are −2.60, −2.58, −2.55 and −2.69 eV for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively. PFPy, PFPy-FO and PFPy-FEO show very similar EHOMO and ELUMO values due to their similar conjugated backbones. Accordingly, the EHOMO and ELUMO of PFPy-P are slightly deeper than those of the other three polymers, since phenyl is a weaker electron-rich and larger band-gap unit compared to fluorene.

Photovoltaic performance of conventional PSCs
To investigate the cathode modification abilities of these polymers, poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)-based conventional BHJ PSCs were preliminarily fabricated with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/CIL/Al. The polymeric CILs were prepared by spin-coating their MeOH (in the presence of trace AcOH) solutions with a concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1 on the surface of the active layers. As a comparison, PSCs without any CIL, and with MeOH/AcOH solvent washing the active layer and with poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) CIL were also fabricated and tested. The energy level diagram of each component in the PSCs is shown in Fig. 4a. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs with different CILs under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 4b, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 2. The reference PSCs without any CIL display a maximal PCE of 5.38%, with Voc, Jsc and FF values of 0.88 V, 10.70 mA cm−2 and 57.1%, respectively, which are consistent with the previous reports.47,48 The MeOH/AcOH treatment slightly elevates the PCE to 5.50%. However, after inserting one of the resulting polymers into the active layer/Al interface, obvious enhancements of Voc and FF and a slight increase of Jsc can be realized, leading to maximal PCEs of 6.54%, 6.75%, 6.67% and 6.97% for the PFPy-, PFPy-FO-, PFPy-FEO- and PFPy-P-modified devices, respectively. Among these polymers, PFPy-P displays almost comparable cathode-modification ability with the famous PFN CIL that helps achieve a maximal PCE of 6.98%. These results suggest the versatile cathode-modifying properties of the pyridine group. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs with different CILs are shown in Fig. 4c. These devices exhibit similar EQE spectral profiles, with integral photocurrents of 11.09, 10.70, 10.78, 10.77, 10.73 and 10.94 mA cm−2 for the bare Al, MeOH/AcOH-washed, PFPy-, PFPy-FO-, PFPy-FEO- and PFPy-P-modified devices, respectively. These integral photocurrents are all close to the experimentally measured Jsc values. From Table 2, all the series resistance (Rs) values of the devices with the polymeric CILs are lower than those of the bare Al and solvent-treated devices, and the shunt resistances (Rsh) of the interfacial polymer-modified PSCs are higher than those of the bare Al and solvent-treated PSCs. These results indicate that the resulting polymers indeed distinctly improve the cathode contact properties.

To investigate the working mechanisms of the resulting polymeric CILs, the J–V characteristics of the PSCs in the dark were also studied, as shown in Fig. 5a. It can be observed that under reverse bias and low forward bias, all the dark currents of the polymer-modified devices are lower than those of the bare Al and solvent-treated devices. As J in this region depends mainly on the thickness and quality of the active layer, the decreased reverse and leakage currents may result from the fact that these polymeric CILs act as protective layers to prevent Al from diffusing into the active layers.49 Among these four polymers, PFPy-P shows the lowest leakage current, which may result in the highest photovoltaic performance for PSCs. Moreover, a previous study reported that the depressed reverse dark current contributed to the Voc enhancement when using WSCPs as CILs in PSCs.50 Hence, the improvements in Voc after introducing these polymeric CILs may result from the reduction in reverse dark current. In the range of 0–2 V, the turn-on voltages for the bare Al, solvent-treated, PFPy-, PFPy-FO-, PFPy-FEO- and PFPy-P-modified devices are ∼0.91, 1.02, 1.18, 1.17, 1.15 and 1.12 V, respectively. These results mean that the Vbi values across the PSCs are enhanced when these polymers are introduced as CILs, which is possibly the main reason for the improvements in Voc. Furthermore, the reason for the Vbi enhancements may be ascribed to the reduction of cathode WFs induced by the interfacial dipoles formed at the CIL/cathode interfaces, as discussed later. Finally, under high forward bias, the injection currents of these polymer-modified devices are higher than those of the bare Al and solvent-washed devices, suggesting that electron injections from the cathodes to active layers are improved after inserting these CILs.49

It is well known that amine-functionalized CILs can n-dope PC71BM via the lone-pair electron-induced charge transfer process, which generated more efficiently conductive pathways to improve electron transport and extraction in PSCs.27 Similar to amine groups, pyridine groups are also a kind of versatile Lewis base that possesses lone-pair electrons in the sp2 orbital of the nitrogen atom. In order to investigate the probable n-doping effect from the pyridine groups in these resulting polymers to PC71BM, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained, as shown in Fig. 5b. No detectable anionic PC71BM absorption signal is observed for the pure PC71BM compound. However, when PC71BM is mixed with any one of the resulting polymers, EPR signals can be detected, confirming the electron transfer process from pyridine groups to PC71BM. This n-doping effect may reduce the charge transport loss at the cathode side and thus increase the FF.
To evaluate the apparent charge transport properties of PSCs with different CIL treatments, the J–V characteristics of electron-only devices were tested and the results were fitted with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, as shown in Fig. 6. The structure of the electron-only device is ITO/ZnO/PCDTBT:PC71BM/CIL/Al. The deposition conditions for the active layers and CILs were the same as those adopted for the PSC devices. Apparent electron mobilities of 2.6 × 10−5, 1.8 × 10−4, 3.7 × 10−4, 9.5 × 10−5 and 5.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were determined for the bare Al, PFPy-modified, PFPy-FO-modified, PFPy-FEO-modified and PFPy-P-modified devices, respectively. These results show that the electron transporting properties at the cathode side of the PSCs are improved by these polymer CILs, leading to the reduced Rs and increased FF. Among them, the PFPy-P-modified device shows the highest electron mobility, and these outstanding electron-transporting properties of PFPy-P are possibly contributed to the high Jsc and FF and thus the best PSC performance.

J–V curves of electron-only devices with different CILs fitted from the SCLC model. 
To analyze the influence of these polymeric CILs on the morphologies of the underlying active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to study the surface morphologies of PCDTBT:PC71BM layers subjected to different treatments, as shown in Fig. 7. The pristine active layer exhibits a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.18 nm. After treatment with MeOH/AcOH, the morphology does not change obviously, with a RMS roughness of 1.20 nm. When the resulting polymers were spin-coated on top of the active layer, the surfaces display RMS roughness values of 0.923, 1.29, 0.727 and 0.891 nm for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively, suggesting that these polymers can form smooth films on the surfaces of active layers. These homogeneous CILs may form an excellent interfacial contact between the active layer and Al cathode for achieving enhanced FF and Voc values.

Photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs
It has been well demonstrated that inverted PSCs can realize high-performance PSCs.34,51–53 Recently, it has been reported that most of the utilized electron-transporting layers (ETLs) in inverted PSCs are metal oxides, which need high temperature treatment during the formation of metal oxide layers.54 As a comparison, conjugated polymer-based ETLs possess room-temperature processing and flexible merits, therefore versatile ETLs for efficient utilization in inverted PSCs are fabricated.55–57 With the aim of gaining more understanding of the cathode-modification properties of these resulting polymers, we also used them as CILs for inverted PSCs based on poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7):PC71BM active layers. The device structure is ITO/CIL/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Al, as shown in Fig. 8a. The polymeric CILs were prepared by spin-coating their MeOH (in the presence of trace AcOH) solutions with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 on the surface of ITO substrates. As a comparison, PSCs without any CIL and with MeOH/AcOH washing the ITO were also fabricated and tested. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs with different CILs under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 8b, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 3. The PSC without any CIL shows a PCE of 3.64%, with Voc, Jsc and FF values of 0.55 V, 14.58 mA cm−2 and 44.7%, respectively. In contrast, the MeOH/AcOH-treated device exhibits a slightly improved performance, with Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values of 0.66 V, 13.94 mA cm−2, 46.0% and 4.25%, respectively. Interestingly, after inserting one of the resulting polymers as CIL into the ITO/active layer interface, the PSC performance displays significant improvement. Specifically, the PFPy-, PFPy-FO-, PFPy-FEO- and PFPy-P-modified devices show increased Voc values of 0.72, 0.74, 0.73 and 0.73 V, and enhanced Jsc values of 17.34, 16.99, 16.57 and 17.29 mA cm−2, as well as enlarged FF values of 61.1%, 63.0%, 59.6% and 63.1%, which result in improved PCEs of 7.63%, 7.92%, 7.21% and 7.96%, respectively. Note that the PFPy-P-modified device also shows the best performance among these four polymers, which is possibly assigned to the larger band gap and better electron-transporting properties of PFPy-P, as discussed above. Fig. 8c shows the EQE spectra of PSCs with different CILs and the integral photocurrent densities are 15.07, 14.87, 16.95, 16.53, 16.30 and 16.85 mA cm−2 for the bare Al, MeOH/AcOH-washed, PFPy-, PFPy-FO-, PFPy-FEO- and PFPy-P-modified devices, respectively. Note that these values are all close to the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves.

To understand the working mechanism of the polymers as CILs in inverted PSCs, the J–V characteristics of the PSCs with different CILs in the dark were characterized, as shown in Fig. 9a. Under reverse and low forward bias, it can be found that the CIL modifications enable a reduction in the leakage currents of devices, which lead to the improvements in FF and Voc.50 Alternatively, in the range of 0–2 V, the bare Al, PFPy-, PFPy-FO-, PFPy-FEO- and PFPy-P-modified devices display turn-on voltages at about 0.83, 0.90, 0.85, 0.88 and 0.89 V, respectively. The enlarged turn-on voltages suggest the enhancements in Vbi across the PSCs when these polymers are introduced as CILs, and the reasons for this will be discussed in detail.

To study the transmittances of the resulting polymers on ITO substrates, the UV-vis transmission spectra of different substrates were recorded, as displayed in Fig. 9b. The deposition conditions for these polymer films are the same as those for the PSC fabrication. It can be observed that all the ITO/CIL substrates display transparencies over 80% from 340 to 700 nm, and the transmittances reach 90%–100% over 420 nm. The high transparencies of these polymer CILs will not obviously reduce the photon harvesting of active layers, which are beneficial for realizing higher Jsc values.
It is well known that amino groups in CILs can induce interfacial dipoles at the active layer/cathode interfaces. These interfacial dipoles can decrease the WFs of electrodes and thus enlarge the Vbi of devices, which is the main reason for Voc improvements in PSCs.27,35 In order to verify whether the pyridine group could form a dipole interaction with the cathode, we measured the WFs of ITO subjected to different treatments by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, as shown in Fig. 10a. The pristine ITO gives a WF of 4.86 eV, and the solvent treatment slightly changes the ITO WF to 4.82 eV. However, when ITO is covered with one of the resulting polymers, its WF reduces to 4.36, 4.48, 4.54 and 4.59 eV for PFPy, PFPy-FO, PFPy-FEO and PFPy-P, respectively. These results mean that interfacial dipoles may be built at the polymer/ITO interfaces (Fig. 10b), which lead to the enhancements in Vbi, Voc and FF. Moreover, the interfacial dipoles may also exist between the polymer/Al interfaces, resulting in the improvements in Vbi and Voc of the conventional PSCs discussed above. The reduced WFs of ITO can build better energy alignments and Ohmic contacts with the active layer (Fig. 10c), which promote electron transport and extraction at the cathode side, thus increasing the Jsc.57

Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers with pyridine groups in the side chains of fluorene scaffolds are developed and used as CILs in high-performance conventional and inverted PSCs. Similar to amino groups, the pyridine group can build interfacial dipoles at the CIL/cathode interfaces, which can efficiently reduce the WFs of cathodes and thus increase the Voc of PSCs. Moreover, the pyridine group can n-dope fullerene acceptors via a lone-pair electron-induced charge transfer process, leading to improved electron transport for active layers. As a result, these newly developed WSCPs can significantly improve the performance of both conventional and inverted PSCs. For the conventional PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM, these resulting polymers can increase the PCE from 5.38% (without any CIL) and 5.50% (with MeOH/AcOH treatment) to 6.54%–6.97%. For the inverted PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM, these resulting polymers can improve the PCE from 3.64% (without any CIL) and 4.25% (with MeOH/AcOH treatment) to 7.21%–7.96%. Among these polymers, PFPy-P displays the best interfacial modification performance, possibly attributed to the larger band gap and higher electron-transporting properties in PSCs. Therefore, these pyridine-functionalized polymers are promising candidates as CILs for high-performance PSCs.

After being cooled to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 200 mL of MeOH, and the precipitate was collected by filtration. Then the material was washed with hexane and acetone in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h, after which the solid was dissolved in 8 mL of THF, followed by filtration with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTEE).

General measurements and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz (for 1H) and 75 MHz (for 13C) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. APCI-MS analyses were performed using an Acquity Waters UPLC equipped with a Waters Acquity TQ detector (Thermo Finnigan LCQ Fleet system). Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument (Elementar Co.). Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by using a Waters GPC 2410 in THF using a calibration curve with polystyrene standards. TGA were conducted using a NETZSCH TG 209 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded on an Instaspec IV CCD spectrophotometer (Oriel Co.). CV were characterized on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a standard three electrode cell based on a Pt wire counter electrode and a platinum (Pt) working electrode, against SCE as a reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 within a nitrogen-saturated anhydrous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphates (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile, versus Fc/Fc+ as the internal reference.
Polymer solar cell fabrication

Fabrication of conventional PSCs. 
A patterned ITO-coated glass substrate was used as the anode. After the substrate was cleaned carefully, dried and plasma treated with oxygen, a 40 nm thin layer of PEDOT:PSS by spin-coating was used to modify the ITO substrate, followed by baking at 200 °C for 10 min. The substrate was then taken in a nitrogen-filled glove box, and a 100 nm blend active layer of PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) was deposited by spin-casting from its solution in a solvent mixture of chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:3, v/v). The resulting polymer CIL was spin-coated from 0.2 mg mL−1 solution in MeOH (in the presence of trace AcOH) at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an 80 nm thin layer of Al was thermally deposited as the cathode through a shadow mask (defined active area of 0.16 cm2) in a chamber. The Al cathode thickness was monitored upon deposition by using a crystal thickness monitor (Sycon).


Fabrication of inverted PSCs. 
The resulting polymer CIL was spin-coated from MeOH (in the presence of trace AcOH) solution with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 on the surface of the pre-cleaned ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. An 80 nm blend active layer of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) was spin-coated from its solution in a solvent mixture of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (97:3, v/v). A 10 nm MoO3 layer and a 100 nm Al layer were subsequently evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the device (∼0.16 cm2) and form the anode.

Polymer solar cell characterization
The thickness of the organic film was determined with profilometry (Veeco Dektak150). Device fabrication was completed in an N2 atmosphere dry-box (Vacuum Atmospheres Co.). The J–V characteristics were measured with a Keithley 236 source meter. The spectral response was recorded with a commercial photomodulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel). A calibrated Si photodiode was used to determine the photosensitivity. PCE was measured under an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). The power of the sun simulation was calibrated before testing using a standard silicon solar cell.
