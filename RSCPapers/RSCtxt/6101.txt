    , Accepted 13th November 2013First published on 15th November 2013AbstractElectrode materials with efficient capabilities for ionic and electronic transport are key to high performance supercapacitors. Here, we demonstrate a simple and comparatively low temperature synthesis of functionalized multilayer fullerenes so called carbon nano-onions (CNOs) as the electrode for high performance electrochemical supercapacitors. The exohedral type supercapacitor formed due to nonporous CNOs showed higher specific capacitance than conventional graphitic/mesoporous/activated carbons. Surface redox functionalities of these CNOs add up to significant pseudocapacitance. Further in situ incorporation of MnO2 nanoparticles to these CNOs increased the specific capacitance up to 1207 F g−1, which is close to the theoretical value of pseudocapacitive MnO2.
Introduction
Carbon nanostructures with outstanding mechanical, thermal, electronic, and electrical properties, coupled with chemical robustness, have spurred a broad range of applications.1–6 Several stable forms of structural organization of carbon atoms can exist on the nanoscale that includes zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials viz. carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerenes, graphene, carbon quantum dots, nanodiamond and carbon nano-onions (CNOs) etc.7 With the recent advances in synthesis, fabrication and assembly techniques, carbon nanomaterials are experiencing renewed interest from researchers as a basis of numerous scalable technologies especially in the energy conversion and energy storage fields e.g. electrochemical capacitors.8,9
Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, store energy using an accumulation of ions of opposite charge in a double layer at an electrochemically stable, highly specific. surface area electrode that is a non faradic process or by a faradic process which is charge-transfer-reaction pseudocapacitance.10,11 These are considered to be very attractive energy storage devices, as they have high power density and cycling stability and are used to power hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronic equipment and other devices.12 However the limitations of supercapacitors in delivering high energy densities restricts their use in high-power applications.
As per the equation E = 1/2(CV2), two important parameters that define the energy density (E) of supercapacitors are cell potential (V) and capacitance (C).13 Both these are significantly determined by electrode and electrolyte, thus making the electrode material an important aspect to research, in order to increase the energy density of supercapacitors.
Carbon nanomaterials have been extensively researched, either in an electric double layer capacitor as the carbon electrode or in pseudocapacitors that employ a composite of highly conducting carbon with a material such as a metal oxide.14 Porous activated, templated15 and carbide-derived carbons,16 multi- and single-walled carbon nanotubes17 and multilayer graphene18 have been used as the electrode materials in supercapacitors. A significant portion of the research is concentrated on CNTs and graphene based composite electrodes due to their excellent electrical and mechanical properties, chemical stability and high specific surface area.19–21 Capacitance as high as 200–400 F g−1 can be obtained from composites of graphene/CNTs with pseudocapacitive materials like metal oxides or polymers.22,23
Inorganic pseudocapacitive materials such as MnO2, RuO2 store charge via redox reactions.24 Such inorganic electrochemical capacitors use an aqueous electrolyte to reduce the risk of explosion at high temperatures, improve the power density, and show higher efficiency than organic based supercapacitors.
Although considerable effort has been devoted to enhance device performance so far, inefficient ionic and electronic transport in pseudocapacitive electrodes has led to capacitance fading over cycling or at high rates.25 In fact ionic and electronic transport kinetics are extremely important aspects in energy storage systems26 and that implies the critical significance of the electrode material's structure and morphology in achieving high power and energy densities, long cycle life, and high rate capability.
In case of nanoporous carbon supercapacitors counterions enter pores to form endohedral supercapacitors, which have a negative surface curvature. Graphene based materials have zero curvature, and one dimensional capped CNTs have a positive surface curvature, whereas, counterions can only reside on the outer surfaces, leading to exohedral supercapacitors.27,28 These positive surface curvature carbon electrodes can be charged at a high rate, approaching electrolytic capacitors.28 Although CNTs have been studied extensively for this purpose, there are very few reports of positive surface curvature materials i.e. CNOs.29–32
CNOs are quasi-spherical nanoparticles consisting of multi-layered concentric graphitic shells also called multilayer fullerenes.33 They offer a moderate specific surface area compared to that of activated carbons, but this surface is fully accessible to ion adsorption because there is no porous network inside the particles.32 There are quite a few methods by which CNOs can be produced; the most widely used method is by the annealing of detonation nanodiamond powders in an inert atmosphere at temperatures above 1400 °C which leads to their graphitization and formation of CNO.34 However the efficiency of this technique is limited because of the unmanageable reaction, complex equipment, and high cost.
The CNOs obtained from nanodiamond soot were shown to have specific capacitance in the range of 20–40 F g−1 and further functionalization with polyaniline improved it to 640 F g−1.34 Functionalized CNOs have improved wettability and thus the electrolyte has good diffusion into the electrode material. A composite of CNO-supported metal oxide redox supercapacitors such as RuO2 are reported to have specific capacitance of 334 F g−1.35
In the present paper we unfold a cheaper, less complicated and green approach for the synthesis of CNOs inspired from the Indian traditional technique of making kohl using pure ghee (clarified butter).36 Clarified butter is composed of long chain polyunsaturated triglycerols.37 Kohl is a carbon black used in eye makeup and is prepared by collecting soot of vegetable or butter oil. It contains mainly polyaromatic hydrocarbons.36
We demonstrate a supercapacitor based on these CNOs which provides a higher specific capacitance than conventional graphitic/mesoporous/activated carbons. We further synthesized a composite of these CNOs with MnO2 and showed a nearly five times enhancement in specific capacitance of this supercapacitor with high rate capability and long cycle life.
Experimental
Materials
Clarified butter popularly known as ‘ghee’ in the Indian subcontinent and was obtained from AMUL (Anand Milk Union Limited, an Indian dairy cooperative). Potassium permanganate (KMnO4), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are used as received (S. D. Fine-Chem Ltd, India).
Methods

Synthesis of CNOs and MnO2/CNOs. 
CNOs were prepared by collecting thermal black carbon on a glass or ceramic plate directly from the flame of burning ghee. For 25 g of ‘ghee’ the carbon black collected was ∼0.5 g. The collected carbon was then annealed at 800 °C under an inert atmosphere to get activated multishell graphitized CNOs. After annealing the final yield of CNOs was ∼1% of used precursor.
The MnO2/CNOs composite was prepared by microwave hydrothermal reaction. 50 mg of thermal carbon black was dispersed in 160 ml of DI water; 2.5 mg of KMnO4 was added to it and the mixture was sonicated for 1 h followed by probe sonication for 10 minutes. Then the hydrothermal reaction was carried out in a microwave oven (ANTON PAAR) at 200 W, 130 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the composite was separated out by vacuum filter and annealed at 800 °C under an inert gas for 4 h.


Structural and elemental characterization. 
XRD was obtained from diffractometer system, XPERT-PRO with Goniometer, PW3050/60 (θ/θ) equipped with a CuKα radio generator and the scan range (2θ) was between 10 and 80°. Morphology of CNOs and MnO2/CNOs was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Tecnai F30 FEG machine and Raman spectra were recorded on a HR 800 Raman spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon, Horiba, France) using 632.8 nm red laser (NRS1500W). XPS spectra were recorded on VG Microtech Multilab ESCA-3000 spectrometer equipped with a non-monochromatic MgKα X-ray (1253.6 eV) source. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum GX FT-IR spectrometer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the as prepared thermal carbon black and composite MnO2/CNOs using a Perkin Elmer STA 6000 simultaneous thermal analyser.


Electrochemical measurements. 
CNOs and MnO2/CNOs composite materials were then loaded on to carbon paper (capacitance of about 0.02 F, ESI, Fig. S1†) to make electrodes for the electrochemical measurements. A slurry of electrode material was made with THF as the solvent (without binder) and brush coated on to a 1 × 1 cm area of current collector carbon paper on both sides. Finally it was dried under IR light for 10 min. The total weight of the electrode material coated on both sides of carbon paper was kept constant i.e. ∼1 mg for all electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a SP-300 multichannel electrochemical workstation (Biologic Science Instruments) at room temperature. Electrochemical studies based on cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were done by a conventional three electrodes system with Hg/HgSO4 as the reference electrode and platinum (Pt) foil as the counter electrode in aqueous 0.5 M and 2.5 M of H2SO4. Galvanostatic charge discharge was done by a two electrode system in 0.5 M of H2SO4 electrolyte. All the calculated values were normalized with weight of the electrodes.

Results and discussion
Various structural and morphology analyses demonstrated that these CNOs consisted of multilayer fullerene shells at a dimensional size of a few nanometers, with a specific surface area of 486 m2 g−1 (ESI, Fig. S2†). TEM images of activated graphitic carbon revealed a continuous chain structure consisting of quasi-periodic CNO beads with a characteristic diameter of 40–45 nm (Fig. 1a). HRTEM images show CNOs with multiple graphitic shells (Fig. 1b). It is postulated that carbon actually preferentially forms spherical shells when faced with the necessity of satisfying its valence requirements without the aid of other atoms.38 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are present in high concentrations in the ghee flame36 and therefore adopt pentagonal rings as they grow so as to generate spheroidal structures which maximize the number of C–C linkages. As is seen in the HRTEM images these spheroidal rings are mostly completely closed but not in all places. Some of the rings are fused with another CNO ring; obviously it is unlikely that many of these aromatic carbon nets will succeed in closing perfectly to form even spheroids (more HRTEM images in ESI Fig. S3†). The rapidly growing carbon net is likely to close imperfectly and begin a second shell before the first is finished.33 From the SAED pattern of CNO d-spacing obtained, about 3.5 Å matches to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon. From the TEM images of thermal carbon black (ESI, Fig. S4†) it is revealed that CNOs are formed in the first step of synthesis but that TGA of the as collected thermal carbon black (ESI, Fig. S5†) showed further reduction in weight until 445 °C and then stabilized. Therefore this product was annealed at 800 °C to obtain pure graphitic CNOs. In this case graphitization occurred at very low temperatures typically <800 °C because the formation of CNOs begins in a highly strained form that is rich in defects and which can lower the energy barrier for graphitization.39
 Fig. 1  TEM and HRTEM images of (a and b) CNOs and (c and d) MnO2/CNOs. Insets are the corresponding SAED patterns. 
TEM images of MnO2/CNOs composite demonstrated that the MnO2 nanoparticles are formed on CNO beads (Fig. 1c). HRTEM of the composite revealed that the MnO2 nanoparticles had a diameter of around 10 nm and showed lattice fringes and a d-spacing value of 0.239 nm corresponding to the (311) plane of λ-MnO2 (Fig. 1d). The SAED pattern in the inset shows lattice points for crystalline MnO2 and clear cycles for CNOs. The TGA of composite (ESI, Fig. S5†) showed that the as prepared MnO2/CNOs composite contains 39% of MnO2.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of CNOs and MnO2/CNOs are shown in Fig. 2a. Diffraction peaks at 24 and 44 degrees of 2θ correspond to (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon40 and peaks at 18, 36, 38 44 and 60 degrees of 2θ correspond to (111), (311), (222), (400) and (511) planes of λ-MnO2 (JCPDS number 44-0992), respectively.

Raman scattering measurements were carried out on CNOs and MnO2/CNOs to investigate the lattice vibrational properties at room temperature. It is well known that Raman spectroscopy allows high throughput identification of various forms of carbon as well as fingerprints for single layers, bilayers, and a few layers reflecting changes in the electron bands of graphitic carbon.41 As seen in Fig. 2b the D band observed at 1325 cm−1 can be assigned to defects in the CNOs lattice including sp3 hybridized carbon, and the G band at 1600 cm−1 originates from the vibrations of the sp2 hybridized framework. Intensity ratio (ID/IG) for CNOs is 1.89 indicating surface defects due to the abundant presence of surface functional groups like –CH, –OH, C–NO2etc.42 For the MnO2/CNOs composite the ID/IG ratio is 1.64, indicating a decrease in the number of surface defects as these oxygen containing functional groups of CNOs are involved in reaction with KMnO4 for the formation of MnO2 nanoparticles.43 Another peak appearing at 640 cm−1 in case of MnO2/CNOs hybrid material is the characteristic peak of the MnO2 lattice.
The surface condition and properties of carbon nanomaterials depend very much on preparation and conditioning procedures e.g. the type of initial organic compound from which pyrolytic carbon is generated. FTIR studies of multilayer fullerenes i.e. CNOs are carried out to ascertain the functional groups present on its surface (Fig. 2c). The spectra reveals presence of O and N impurities in the form of functional moieties such as –OH, C–NO2etc. which might have been created during synthesis. Predominant absorption exhibited at 2985 cm−1 can be assigned to aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations and the peak at 1460 cm−1 can be assigned to C–H bending vibrations. The peaks between 1150, and 1255 cm−1 are due to stretching vibrations of C–O single bonds in the ether and phenolic structures whereas, the peak at 1380 cm−1 can be attributed to NO stretching vibrations in C–NO2 structure. The peak at 1070 cm−1 can be assigned to C–OH stretching vibration mode. The FTIR spectrum of composite MnO2/CNOs shows the appearance of an extra peak at 517 cm−1 the same is attributed to the vibration due to the displacement of the oxygen anions of Mn–O–Mn along the direction of the octahedral chains. The pseudocapacitance exhibited by the CNOs as revealed by CV may thus be attributed to these surface functional moieties. The XPS spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 2d) has been deconvoluted into four peaks at 284.5, 285.7, 286.4 and 286.6 eV. The strong intense peak obtained at 284.5 eV is evidence of the binding energy of the sp2 hybridized state that corresponds to the strong C–C bond; the other peaks at 285.7 eV, 286.4 and 286.6 eV are for sp3 hybridized states related to C–C, C–O (epoxy), and C–OH bonds in CNOs, respectively.
The electrochemical performance of CNOs and MnO2/CNOs was evaluated as capacitive electrodes using a conventional three-electrode system with Hg/HgSO4 as the reference electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode in an aqueous electrolyte solution of 2.5 and 0.5 M H2SO4. The samples were characterized with CV, EIS and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements.

Fig. 3a shows capacitance vs. potential curves for CNOs at the scan rates of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 100 mV s−1. The cyclic voltammogram of CNOs is reasonably rectangular but shows reversible redox peaks centered at −0.1 and +0.1 V. This suggests that these CNOs display characteristics of electric double layer capacitance as well as pseudocapacitance. In case of redox surface functionalities, a significant redox pseudocapacitance (Cφ) arises as well as the predominant double layer capacitance (Cdl). In fact with some carbon materials it appears that Cφ can amount to 5–10% of total realizable capacitance and scales approximately with the Cdl value.38 Additionally, functional groups present on the surface of CNOs improve wettability by the electrolyte which results in increased specific capacitance. Even mild changes in surface functional groups can change specific capacitance dramatically.44

Specific capacitance from CV measurements have been calculated by using following formula;  (1)where, Ccv is the specific capacitance, I is the response in current, v the potential window, m is mass of loaded active electrode material and V the potential applied in mV s−1.
The average specific capacitance of the CNOs electrode was calculated from the CV curves which show an initial decrease with increasing scan rate from about 237 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 to 118 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 3a) in a 2.5 M electrolyte. When 0.5 M H2SO4 is used as the electrolyte, CNOs showed specific capacitance of 184 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1.

Fig. 3b shows rate dependent CVs of MnO2/CNOs composite supercapacitor electrode. When compared to CNOs, at the same scan rate of 1 mV s−1 the hybrid electrode of MnO2/CNOs shows very high capacitance of 1207 F g−1 retained to 216 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1. This suggests that functionalized multilayer fullerene type carbon-support enhances the electrochemical utilization of MnO2 and results in specific capacitance near to its theoretical value. Fig. 3c shows comparative CV curves of CNOs and MnO2/CNOs composite at 5 mV s−1 and specific capacitance obtained by CNOs and MnO2/CNOs hybrid electrodes plotted in Fig. 3d. This demonstrates that the hybrid MnO2/CNOs electrode yields a highly improved performance with 4 to 5 times increase in specific capacitance compared to that of only CNOs even at very high scan rates.
The capacitive performance was further investigated with galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling experiments. Fig. 4a shows comparative galvanostatic discharge curves for CNOs and hybrid MnO2/CNOs electrodes and Fig. 4b shows the corresponding galvanostatic discharge curves for the hybrid MnO2/CNOs electrode at various current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1. The specific capacitance for the two-electrode system was calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge values by using the following equation:  Cs = 2I/(−[dv/dt]m)(2)where Cs is the specific capacitance (F g−1), I is the current applied, m is the active mass, and [dv/dt] is the slope obtained from the discharge curve and numerical factor 2 represents two equivalent single electrodes connected in series.45,46

Owing to the significant pseudocapacitance contributions from MnO2, the hybrid MnO2/CNOs electrode exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 575 F g−1 (based on the active material) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 4a). The IR drop (difference between the second discharge point to the beginning of discharge) is 0.0134 V at 0.5 A g−1 and capacitance evaluation was carried out by subtracting the IR drop. As seen in Fig. 4b specific capacitance retained significantly even at a current density as high as 10 A g−1 indicates the great potential of the CNOs based hybrid electrodes for high power operation.
Specific capacitance calculated by both CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge methods are given in Table 1.

Excellent cycling stability is crucial for real supercapacitor operation. To test the electrochemical stability of the MnO2/CNOs hybrid electrode, the charge–discharge cycling was performed at a relatively high current density of 10 A g−1. It is stable up to 94% even for the 2000th cycle at a constant current density 10 A g−1; there was only 6% capacity loss after 2000 consecutive cycles, indicative of excellent long-term electrochemical stability (Fig. 4c). CNOs also exhibit good stability with a capacitance retention of about 89.4% at the 2000th cycle at 10 A g−1.

Fig. 4d shows Nyquist plots of CNOs and the MnO2/CNOs hybrid in the frequency range from 0.1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The MnO2/CNOs electrode has good conductivity and low internal resistance which has been manifested from the intercept of the Nyquist curve on the real axis (Z′ Ω) which is 1.4 Ω. Furthermore the charge transfer resistance is 5.657 Ω for MnO2/CNOs, whereas the CNOs have electrode resistance of 12.3 Ω. The more vertical shape at lower frequencies for MnO2/CNOs indicates the more capacitive behavior of this electrode. The composite shows more capacitive behavior than CNOs probably because CNOs have abundant oxide groups on the surface. In case of the composite, these oxygen containing functional groups are involved in the formation of MnO2 nanoparticles and hence the composite electrode showed a lower resistance and more capacitive behavior.35
To evaluate further the electrochemical performance of the as developed MnO2/CNOs hybrid electrode based supercapacitor, the energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated from galvanostatic charge–discharge curves by using following formulas:  E = 1/2CV2, C = I/−[dv/dt](3) P = E/t(4)where, E and P are energy density and power density, respectively, C is capacitance obtained from discharge curve, V is applied voltage and t is discharge time in hours from the end of the IR drop to the end of the discharge curve.

Fig. 5 shows the Ragone plot of our specific E versus P values considering the total mass of active materials from the positive and negative electrodes. The maximum energy density for CNO obtained was 33.22 W h kg−1 with power density of 0.561 kW kg−1 and the maximum power density was 15.6 kW kg−1 with an energy density of 9 W h kg−1. In the case of the hybrid electrode a maximum power density of 17.94 kW kg−1 was achieved at the energy density of 30.13 W h kg−1 and the maximum energy density of 143 W h kg−1 was achieved at the power density of 1.08 kW kg−1. Another reason for the high capacitance from these electrodes may be the interparticle porosity generated by tiny gaps between CNO beads in a chain. Although the CNOs themselves are not porous, porosity measurements (ESI, Fig. S2†) revealed that these CNO chains have pores of size of around 1.4 nm. In the case of CNOs in chain structures, along with the exohedral type of ion adsorption, interparticle porosity could also contribute towards efficient ion adsorption and lead to enhanced capacitance.

Conclusion
We have developed a simple method to produce an efficient class of multilayer fullerene electrodes for fabricating high-performance supercapacitors. We found that the positive surface curvature of these CNOs provided a good balance between the surface area and the electrolyte accessibility with improved capacitance. The redox surface functionalities of the as synthesized CNOs add up significant pseudocapacitance. The in situ synthesis of MnO2 nanoparticles on these CNOs results in a composite that has led to a more conductive network with further improved capacitance (1207 F g−1). These results significantly exceed those of other reported carbon nanoforms as electrodes for supercapacitors.
