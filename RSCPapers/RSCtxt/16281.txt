    , Accepted 22nd June 2020First published on 25th June 2020AbstractThe development of inexpensive, selective and rapid-response chemosensors for detecting Cs+ in waste water is highly desirable in the nuclear power industry. Here we demonstrate an efficient Cs+ optical sensor based on the N-linked disalicylaldehyde H2Qj with excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), and it will transform into the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process in the presence of Cs+, resulting in dramatically enhanced fluorescence together with a distinct change of color from light-green to green-yellow. Simultaneously, it is found that CH2Cl2 can serve as the quencher of LMCT-enhanced fluorescence, thus enabling selective CH2Cl2 detection in a turn-off fluorescence approach. Further detailed studies reveal that both Cs+ and CH2Cl2 sensing processes are rapid within 60 seconds. The corresponding limit of detection (LOD) values for sensing Cs+ and CH2Cl2 are as low as 0.37 mM and 0.37%. Moreover, it was also verified that Cs+ sensing is applicable in the range of pH = 7–11 and the reversibility of sensor H2Qj can be easily achieved by modulating pH values, and H2Qj is also assessed for its Cs+ sensing performces in real water samples. This H2Qj-Cs sensing system must provide a valuable reference for further Cs+ sensors.
Introduction
Cesium (Cs) with low abundance on Earth is often regarded as a highly reactive metal, which can be used in photoelectric cells to increase the solar energy conversion efficiency,1 atomic clocks to improve timing precision,2 catalysts to promote organic reactions3 medicine to treat cancers,4etc. Compared with heavy metals (such as Pb, Cd, and Hg),5 Cs is mildly toxic, but its radioactive isotopes are extremely hazardous pollutants in the environment and also bad for human health due to adverse biological effects.6 As is known to all, there are two Cs counterparts, i.e., 134Cs and 137Cs, and the latter is especially of serious concern.7 Because of its high reactivity and solubility, radioactive 137Cs can move into the human body by environmental air, water and crops, and it will cause cell damage which finally results in cardiovascular, neurological and gastrointestinal diseases,8–11 and even cancer. Commonly, radioactive 137Cs in nature mainly comes from the fission12 of U, Th and Po during nuclear weapon testing, accidental nuclear power plant leakage, and nuclear material waste.13–16 The nearest example is the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, leading to the direct discharge of 1.12 million tons of 137Cs-containing waste water in the Pacific causing various hazards for at least 30 years. Nowadays, about 400 nuclear power plants around the world generate lots of Cs+-containing waste water every day, and it is roughly estimated that its annual release of tank waste in one generator set is 90 million gallons in the US alone.17 Therefore, there is huge demand to develop efficient materials and techniques for rapid, selective and sensitive Cs+ sensing in environmental and biological systems.
Compared with instrumental analysis techniques,18 the optical detection based on a specific chemosensor is a more advantageous method owing to its simple operation, low cost, high selectivity and sensitivity.19–22 The expected sensors for various analytes often derive from elaborate chemical modifications of highly luminescent fluorophores (rhodamine,23,24 fluorescein25,26 BODIPY,27,28etc.) or absorptive chromophores which could provide matched binding sites to interact with targeted analytes and subsequently produce distinguished fluorescent or colorimetric changes. Particularly, these photophysical property changes should be easily correlated to the targeted analyte recognition or quantification. In fact, during the past decades, researchers have devoted much effort to develop fluorescent and colorimetric sensors18,29–32 for selective and sensitive Cs+ detection, such as crown ethers,33–38 calixarenes39–44 and cryptophanes,45–47 and other supramolecular hosts.48–55 In general, they are well designed and constructed in advance to give a variety of cavity microenvironments. Although these microenvironments have different shapes, all of them have a suitable size and matched chelation sites to encapsulate dissociative Cs+ (ionic radii: 181 pm),56 and it seems that most of the photophysical changes in these studies are induced by the encapsulation properties. Indeed, it is really a very accurate strategy to selectively sense and capture Cs+ while it is also a much more expensive technique because of the complicated synthesis route. Moreover, the Cs+ sensor recycling, i.e., the breakup of the Cs+ complex to release free sensors, is another desired target which could further reduce the cost. The easiest approach for reversible Cs+ capture could be achieved by the pH modulation method. Previous studies57–59 reveal that Cs+ has a strong affinity for oxygen atoms, and its corresponding affinity decreases in sequence from phenolate oxygen (Ar–O−) and phenolic hydroxyl oxygen (Ar–OH) to protonated phenolic hydroxyl oxygen (Ar–OH2+). So the Cs+ capture and release are often regulated by different pH values based on the oxygen-chelated sensors.
Thus, we are keen to explore whether a low-cost sensing system could be designed and synthesized that involves several well-organized chelation atoms and a novel Cs+ sensing approach, if successful, to carefully study its sensing properties for Cs+. Among various organics, salicylaldehyde-derivatives,60 containing formyl and hydroxyl as two recognition groups, have been very successful61–64 in optical sensing due to their favourable light-harvesting salicylaldehyde chromophore to increase the binding ability toward many cations and anions, which may give rise to particular potential for Cs+ sensing. So far, there are few studies reported on the design and application of substituted salicylaldehydes for reversible Cs+ sensing which is really a challenging work. Herein, our work describes an innovative thought for detecting Cs+ based on the N-linked salicylaldehyde derivative in which the salicylaldehyde fragment acts as the fluorescent and colorimetric sensing unit. Accordingly, we synthesized the extended disalicylaldehyde H2Qj using economical reagents and procedures which is comprised of two salicylaldehyde units and used as the Cs+ optical sensor in solution. Further research reveals that this molecule is capable of fluorescent and colorimetric detection of Cs+ with high selectivity. Further investigations prove that this efficient sensing process is related to the ‘dual key & lock’, i.e. Cs+ and solvent, and the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) enhanced fluorescence with CH2Cl2 served as the only fluorescence quencher. Finally, Cs+ and CH2Cl2 detection is successfully achieved using H2Qj, and its responsive properties and potential applications are in accord with our expected targets, containing excellent fast-response, selectivity, sensitivity and reversibility, which are valuable to monitor Cs+ in environmental and biological systems.
Results and discussion
Synthesis, spectral characterization and crystal structure of disalicylaldehyde H2Qj
Our targeted Cs+ sensor H2Qj was an N-linked large-sized disalicylaldehyde composed of two salicylaldehyde fragments and one pendant arm, as described in Scheme 1. The number of designed salicylaldehyde portion was based on the fact that a salicylaldehyde only could provide two oxygen chelation atoms65 and the Cs+ often had a six-coordinated centre.66 In H2Qj, two salicylaldehyde fragments containing four oxygen atoms served as coordination segments for sensing analytes, and the role of the pendant arm was a steric hindrance controller against the coordination segment. Taking phenyl alkyl groups [Ph(CH2)n–] as examples, the less methylene (n = 1–4) we modified in the pendant arm, the bigger the hindrance N-linked disalicylaldehyde produced, and it would result in different configurations of two salicylaldehyde fragments in disalicylaldehyde together with different binding abilities for analytes. Considering that we have obtained two analogous disalicylaldehydes (methylene number n = 2 and 4),67,68 we used the benzyl (PhCH2–, n = 1) group as the pendant arm in this paper. According to reported methods, the large-sized disalicylaldehyde H2Qj was successfully synthesized in two steps by the bromoethylation69 of original 5-chlorosalicylaldehyde in the presence of aluminum chloride followed by the nucleophilic substitution reaction70 with benzylamine in the presence of K2CO3 serving as the proton acceptor.

As a typical organic compound, H2Qj was carefully characterized by several common spectral techniques. Firstly, the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S1†) was recorded, and it revealed that the total number and chemical shifts of protons in H2Qj were in accord with theory values with two aldehyde group protons at 10.03 ppm. Secondly, a strong FT-IR absorption peak was observed at 1674 cm−1 (Fig. S2†) which was attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of the CO bond in aldehyde groups. Thirdly, the UV-vis spectrum (Fig. S3†) was recorded with H2Qj dissolved in MeOH ([M] = 50 μM). It was shown that H2Qj had the absorption band centered at 342 nm, which originated from the characteristic π–π* transition of two salicylaldehyde chromophores and resulted in a light-green solution. Lastly, in the ESI mass spectrum with the positive ion mode (Fig. S4†), the formation of disalicylaldehyde H2Qj was also verified by a positive peak at m/z = 444.08, which was assigned to the [M]+ species. In addition, single crystals of H2Qj for X-ray diffraction analyses were successfully obtained from its corresponding chloroform mixture by slow evaporation in air at room temperature.
In Fig. 1, the definitive atom-numbering drawing for disalicylaldehyde H2Qj, assigned to the triclinic P space group, is shown and it could clearly confirm the N-linked disalicylaldehyde, which must be described as the propeller architecture. The dihedral angles between the pendant-armed benzene ring (gray plane) and two salicylaldehyde units (green plane) were 69.6(5) and 72.5(6)°, respectively, while it was 43.3(5)° for two salicylaldehyde units, which meant that they were farther away from the pendant arm area. At the same time, two weak intramolecular hydrogen bonds O3–H3⋯O4 and O2–H2⋯N1 (Table S3†) were determined in H2Qj which should be used to stabilize the whole molecular structure in the crystal. Particularly, the hydrogen bond O2–H2⋯N1 resulted in completely asymmetric orientations of two salicylaldehyde units. Considering that these two hydrogen bonds could be affected by different solvents with different dipole moments, thus it was speculated that absorption or fluorescence signals of H2Qj might change in different organic solvents.

Responsive properties of H2Qj for alkali metal ions and organic solvents
In our view, N-linked disalicylaldehyde H2Qj can provide double chelation sites than salicylaldehyde which might more easily show specificity for cation sensing, giving signal variations. Because of their similar chemical properties and diverse ion radii, five alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) were selected here as the sensing analytes. At the same time, it was found that H2Qj was soluble in most polar organic solvents, but not in H2O and apolar organic solvents. Considering possible potential applications, the response experiments of H2Qj sensing five alkali metal ions were performed in a MeOH/H2O (v/v = 9:1) mixture at room temperature by recording the fluorescence and absorption spectra. Corresponding nitrate salts were used to provide alkali metal ions and eliminate possible disruptions of anions because of the extremely weak influence of NO3−. As shown in Fig. 2 and S5a,† initially, H2Qj had an emission band centered at 492 nm with a weak fluorescence intensity, and it did not change so much in first four ions. However, in the Cs+ mixture, we observed a new emission band at 507 nm which exhibited a 15 nm bathochromic shift and 4.5 times enhanced fluorescence, resulting in obvious fluorescence changes from light-green to green-yellow color (Fig. 2: insert). Moreover, the absorption band of the Cs+ mixture at 378 nm exhibited a 36 nm bathochromic shift with the color changing from colorless to yellow (Fig. S5b†). It was also observed that H2Qj exhibited a 40 nm hypsochromic shift from 342 nm to 302 nm in the case of Li+, but it was hard to be observed by the naked eye for its spectral change was in the ultraviolet region. Time-dependent sensing experiments for Cs+ were further carried out using fluorescence spectra with a 60 second interval. In Fig. S6a,† it was clearly suggested that the fluorescence intensity of H2Qj could be quickly strengthened by Cs+ within 60 seconds, which proved the fast response of H2Qj for Cs+ stimuli. A series of fluorescence spectra shown in Fig. 3a illustrated that efficient Cs+ sensing still could be achieved in highly basic waste water containing abundant OH− and CO32− anions. Meanwhile, a mixture composed of the above four cations (Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+) was labeled as mixture-A. As shown in Fig. 3b, characteristic Cs+-induced fluorescence enhancement and bathochromic shift still could be observed when Cs+ was added into mixture-A, and it must be noted that Cs+ was competitive to be preferentially detected in mixed alkali metal ions. However, interferences of coexisting alkaline earth and transition metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Al3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Cd2+ Sn4+ Hg2+ and Pb2+), labeled as mixture-C, would destroy the selectivity of H2Qj for Cs+, proven by the disappearance of Cs+-enhanced fluorescence (Fig. 3b) which should be due to the weaker coordination ability of Cs+. After the addition of moderate Na2CO3 and NaOH together with neutralization by HNO3, the mixture-C changed into mixture-C-T and it was found that interferences of the above cations were eliminated and Cs+ could be detected again.

Most volatile organic solvents are harmful to human health even at trace levels. For example, CH2Cl2, used in the metal surface degreasing and electronics industry, often could cause respiratory and central nervous system disorder, and show chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity.71 Although researchers have developed many analytical techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),72 photoionization detection (PID)73 and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS),74 to detect them, there is still a need for rapid and easy detection methods. Inspired by the above spectral studies, we selected the H2Qj-Cs sensing system as an optical sensor to examine its potential for detecting organic solvents. The responsive properties of H2Qj for Cs+ were also recorded and compared in ten organic solvents, i.e., CH2Cl2, CHCl3, EtOH, THF, EA, acetone, MeOH, MeCN, DMF and DMSO. As shown in Fig. S7a,† the fluorescence emission band of H2Qj was observed at 492 nm in both protic solvents (MeOH and EtOH) while it was in the range of 456–468 nm under other eight aprotic solvents, and it was evidently suggested that the protic solvents associated with concomitant hydrogen bond interactions would result in greater emission wavelength and intensity for H2Qj. Meanwhile, H2Qj had the same maximum absorption wavelength (about 342 nm) in all solvents but different absorption values (Fig. S7b†) owing to the solvent-dependent molar extinction coefficient ε (L mol−1 cm−1). By contrast, after the addition of enough Cs+, the emission wavelength and intensity of H2Qj significantly increased in six solvents (EtOH, acetone, MeOH, MeCN, DMF and DMSO), which should be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) together with the solvent-induced enhancement effect, and they were also reflected in the absorption spectra, shown in Fig. S7c and 7d.† Particularly, the fluorescence intensity of H2Qj dramatically increased in the presence of Cs+ for all solvents except CH2Cl2 (Fig. 4), namely, Cs+ had little influence on the emission of H2Qj in CH2Cl2, which could be regarded as a quencher. In a word, the above fluorescence modulation approach could be represented as the ‘dual key & lock’ mode, proposed by Yuan and co-workers.75 It meant that the distinguishable LMCT-enhanced fluorescence of H2Qj (‘lock’) only could be observed in the presence of interdependent Cs+ (first ‘key’) and polarity solvents (second ‘key’, μ > 1.14). The greatest advantage of this dual stimuli-dependent sensing mode lies in the fact that it could remove many false positive signals and greatly increase the selectivity for Cs+ in complex solution systems, such as the serum and real water samples. But it was difficult to obtain similar results by colorimetric analysis techniques because of irregular absorption variations. Meanwhile, it was also found that the CH2Cl2 fluorescence response was fast and it could be finished within 60 s, as proved in Fig. S6b.† Finally, all of these results allowed the assumption that disalicylaldehyde H2Qj was a highly selective and rapidly responsive fluorescence sensor with the ‘dual key & lock’ sensing mode for Cs+ and CH2Cl2 in solution (Scheme 1), specifically, it was a turn-on fluorimetric sensor for Cs+ and turn-off fluorimetric sensor for CH2Cl2.

Linearity and LOD of the sensor for Cs+ and CH2Cl2
In order to deeply investigate the Cs+ and CH2Cl2 sensing systems, further titration experiments were undertaken; sensor H2Qj and series of proportional Cs+ were dispersed in mixed MeOH and H2O ([M] = 50 μM) serving as the standard emulsion. In Fig. 5a, after the addition of Cs+, it was firstly found that the fluorescence intensity of mixtures gradually increased while the emission centre shifted from 492 nm to 507 nm step by step, and they were almost unchanged when the Cs+ concentration reached 100 mM. Under the 492 nm emission band, the linear response range of sensor H2Qj for Cs+ was determined in the range 0–10.0 mM (Fig. 5b). Its corresponding limit of detection (LOD) to evaluate the sensing sensitivity was determined as 0.37 mM based on the linear calibration curve of (I − I0)/I0versus the Cs+ concentration (y = 0.0171x + 0.0033, R2 = 0.9978, Fig. 5b: insert) together with the reported method and equation.76 Meanwhile, we also observed that the initial absorption band of sensor H2Qj at 342 nm was gradually decreased and a new LMCT absorption band centered at 391 nm was continuously increased (Fig. 5c), resulting in the changed color from light-green to green-yellow (Fig. 5c: insert). The concomitant isosbestic points confirmed that the sensor H2Qj has finished a homogeneous transformation and changed into a sole new species. There was also a good linear relationship (Fig. 5d: insert, y = 0.0066x + 0.0015, R2 = 0.9894) between A0 − A and Cs+ content in the range of 0–5.00 mM, and the LOD was calculated as 0.51 mM.

(b) Changes of emission intensity (λem = 492 nm) with the inset showing the linear calibration curve between the (I − I0)/I0 and Cs+ concentration [Cs+]. (d) Absorption variations and the plot of (A0 − A) vs. Cs+ concentration [Cs+] at 342 nm. 
The responsive behavior of Cs+-associated sensor H2Qj for CH2Cl2 was also carefully evaluated in several organic solvents, containing several proportional CH2Cl2 contents. In consideration of the solvent effect and dipole moment, here we separately detected CH2Cl2 in three representative protic or aprotic organic solvents (DMSO, MeOH and THF). It was clearly observed that the 502 nm emission band and 418 nm absorption band of the Cs+-H2Qj mixture were gradually decreased (Fig. 6a and b) along with the increment of the CH2Cl2 content from 0 to 40% v/v in DMSO, and the good linear range between emission intensity ratios (I0 − I)/I0 and CH2Cl2 content was in the range of 0–10% v/v (y = 0.0165x + 0.0050, R2 = 0.9900) (Fig. S8a†), which could be used to precisely determine the CH2Cl2 content in DMSO. The LOD was calculated to be 0.37% (v/v) which was an excellent result and comparable to other reported examples.77–79 In the absorption spectra, the good linear relationship (y = 0.0190x + 0.0027, R2 = 0.9915, Fig. S8b†) between the A0 − A and CH2Cl2 content was only found in 0–5%, and the corresponding LOD was 0.43% (v/v). Derived from changed fluoresce and absorption spectra (Fig. 6c and d) in MeOH, the favorable linear relationships were both in the range of 0–50%, verified by two well-defined calibration curves (y = 0.00295x + 0.00057, R2 = 0.9992, Fig. S8c† and y = –0.00089x + 0.00053, R2 = 0.9978, Fig. S8d†). Their LOD values were 0.73% and 1.13%, respectively, indicating the lower sensitivity in MeOH. It was also found that changes of fluorescence intensity were only involved in the emission band at 502 nm for two solvents. At the same time, the colorimetric variations in DMSO were just found in the absorption band at 418 nm while the absorption values of two bands at 342 nm and 391 nm changed. What was surprising was that the CH2Cl2 sensing was performed in THF, the optical signal changed a little whether in fluorescence or absorption spectra (Fig. 6e and f), and it was hard to determine the CH2Cl2 content in THF. The different sensing results of this Cs+-associated sensor H2Qj demonstrated that the sensor fluorescence in organic solvents with the larger dipole moment was more easily affected by the CH2Cl2, and it should be due to the LMCT. Moreover, whether in DMSO or MeOH, we observed two concomitant isosbestic points, thus it could be concluded that the transformation of charge transfer was homogeneous. All of these results verified that this Cs+-associated sensor H2Qj could provide an effective platform capable of precise determination of the CH2Cl2 content in organic solvents with the large polarity due to the turn-off fluorescent and colorimetric response.

Sensing mechanism
To understand the sensing mechanism for Cs+ and CH2Cl2 in solution, 1H NMR studies were firstly conducted to monitor their sensing processes in different solvents. As shown in Fig. 7, when sensor H2Qj was mixed with excess Cs+ in CDCl3, no chemical shift of protons changed in aromatic rings while significant chemical shift changes were found in phenolic hydroxyl and formyl groups. Particularly, the formyl proton peak shifted from 10.01 to 10.11 ppm, and the sharpened hydroxyl proton peak shifted from 11.46 to 11.59 ppm, revealing the unchanged structure of H2Qj and new coordination interactions between four oxygen atoms of H2Qj and Cs+. Similar phenomena were also found in CD3OD. Interestingly, after the addition of equally proportional CD2Cl2 in CD3OD, the peak of formyl protons at 10.11 ppm was split into two new high field peaks (10.06 and 9.94 ppm), and no chemical shifts were observed in CD2Cl2 for all protons, even for the two formyl protons. Undoubtedly, it was proven that CD2Cl2 molecules could destroy the above-mentioned coordination interactions. Then we also used the ESI mass spectra to evaluate new species in CH3OH. In contrast, the original positive peak of sensor H2Qj (Fig. S4†) disappeared after the addition of Cs+, and it revealed the structure transformation which was also verified by a strong positive peak at m/z = 1284.41 (Fig. S9†), assigned to the species of [M + 3CH3OH]+. Thus, here the mechanism of selective Cs+ sensing was ascribed to the coordination interactions between H2Qj and Cs+ (Scheme 1) which transformed the sensor H2Qj into its corresponding Cs-complex. At the same time, when the same analytes were mixed in CH3OH–CH2Cl2 (v/v = 1:1), we only observed two positive peaks at m/z = 547.11 and 912.12 (Fig. S10†), assigned to the adducts of H2Qj, against the peak at m/z = 1284.41 which verified the hindrance role of CH2Cl2 for the Cs-H2Qj complex in CH3OH. This was the main reason for CH2Cl2 detection using the H2Qj-Cs sensing system.

Upon evaluating the 1:1 stoichiometry and absorption spectra, the association constant Ka between sensor H2Qj and Cs+ in MeOH and H2O mixture was determined as 183.7 M−1 by the Benesi–Hildebrand method (Fig. S11†),80 suggesting the weak bonding ability of Cs+. Geometry optimizations were performed using the density functional M06-2X81 implemented in Gaussian 09.82 For Cs the Stuttgart/Dresden effective core potential (SDD) was used, and for the rest of the atoms cc-pvdz basis sets were used. Optimization and frequency analyses were performed in methanol with the SMD polarizable continuum model.83 In contrast, the energy value of second and third structures (Fig. 8a and b) was about 0.101 and 0.257 eV higher than the first one (Fig. 8c), respectively, which indicated that the first structure was more stable and the coordination interaction between Cs+ and two oxygen atoms of a salicylaldehyde fragment was the preferred interaction mode. The Cs–O bond distances, corresponding to hydroxyl and formyl groups, were 3.077 and 3.188 Å, respectively.

In Fig. S7a and S7c,† the distinct bathochromic shift of the emission band could be observed in both H2Qj and its Cs-complex accompanied by the increased solvent polarity, which proved the existence of the ICT state in them. However, their charge transfer types were very different from each other. We found that H2Qj experienced much larger red shift and fluorescence increase in MeOH and EtOH than DMSO and DMF. It must be suggested that the ICT process of H2Qj in solvents was achieved from the electron donating hydroxyl group to the electron-withdrawing formyl group. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the H2Qj-Cs complex was much higher than H2Qj, and its maximum emission wavelength was the same 502 nm in MeOH, EtOH, DMF and DMSO. It was proven that there were no dissociative hydroxyls and all of them coordinated with Cs+. Therefore, after the addition of Cs+, the solvent-induced fluorescence enhancement was undoubtedly due to the LMCT process with the charge transfer from H2Qj to Cs+.84
pH effect and reversibility studies
For further potential applications, we have studied pH effects on the sensor H2Qj by absorption spectra in the absence and presence of Cs+ at various pH values (pH = 1–12), shown in Fig. S12.† In Fig. 9, it could be concluded that H2Qj was stable in the range of pH = 7–10 with the 342 nm maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) while it also experienced protonation at pH = 3–6 (λmax = 291 nm) and deprotonation at pH = 11–14 (λmax = 400 nm). Interestingly, under the same conditions (pH = 7–10), the addition of Cs+ resulted in a 49 nm bathochromic shift from 342 nm to 391 nm. Obviously, the involved LMCT absorption could be stabilized in a wide pH range which was beneficial for the good visual response of H2Qj for Cs+ in possible applications. At the same time, the λmax values of the H2Qj-Cs+ mixture were almost the same as the H2Qj in the weak acid (pH = 3–6) and strong basic (pH = 12–14) pH environments. All of these results verified the partial deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl groups in H2Qj during the formation of the H2Qj-Cs complex. Furthermore, considering that most of the pH ranges in biological systems were weak alkaline and Cs-containing waste water was strong alkaline, we have studied the reversibility of this Cs+ sensor between pH = 7 and 12. As described in Fig. 10, sensor H2Qj showed good reversible responses to Cs+ over 8 cycles, which was also beneficial for detecting the Cs+ in fluctuating pH environments. Overall, sensor H2Qj exhibited satisfactory Cs+ sensing abilities when the pH value was in the range of 7–10, indicating that H2Qj possessed high sensing ability in similar environments.

Cs+ monitoring in real water samples
Using deionized water as the blank sample, we have performed several Cs+ monitoring experiments in tap water and sea water to evaluate whether the sensor H2Qj was valuable to detect Cs+ in real water samples. Considering that tap and sea water samples contained many additional components,85 for example, alkaline earth metal ions, bacteria and green algae, which could result in many false positive fluorescence signals. In the process of analytical sample preparation, a certain amount of H2Qj and Cs+ were mixed in CH3OH–H2O (v/v = 19:1), and all mixtures were required to equilibrate for 30 min before fluorescence measurements. As shown in Fig. 11, the emission band of H2Qj at 492 nm did not shift, but the corresponding emission intensities were different in different water samples. After the addition of excess Cs+, we observed two new emission bands at 504 and 507 nm with weakened fluorescence intensities which simultaneously exhibited 12 and 15 nm bathochromic shifts in tap and sea water, respectively. Although the H2Qj-Cs complex was still formed, its fluorescence intensity was quenched at different levels because of some coexisting disturbances in real water samples. We also defined the other two solutions as the Cs+-tap water-T and Cs+-sea water-T, which were derived from the corresponding Cs+-tap water and Cs+-sea water after the alkaline and filtration treatments at pH = 11 using NaOH together with neutralization by HNO3, and two emission bands at 504 nm with increased intensity could be observed again. Thus, it was revealed that disalicylaldehyde H2Qj was a promising fluorometric sensor in rapid real water sensing for Cs+.

Experimental section
Materials and instrumentation
All starting materials under 99% purity were commercially acquired from the TCI Shanghai Company and directly used without any further purifications.
Elemental analyses were measured with a PerkinElmer 1400C analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm−1 on a Nicolet FT-IR 170X spectrophotometer using KBr plates. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 MHz spectrometer at room temperature, and chemical shifts were reported as parts per million from TMS. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3150 double-beam spectrophotometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific LCQ-Fleet mass spectrometer in a scan range of 500–2000 amu. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature on a HORIBA JOBIN YVON FluoroMax-4 fluorometer equipped with a R928P PMT emission detector in the visible region.

Syntheses of H2Qj. 
The synthesis procedure of H2Qj was the same as that of the previous example70 except that benzylamine (0.268 g, 2.50 mmol) and 5-chloro-3-bromomethyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1.504 g, 6.03 mmol) were used here, and H2Qj was finally obtained in the yield of 71% (0.788 g) by silica gel column chromatography using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (v/v = 1:5) as the eluent. Mp: 184–185 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 10.03 (s, 2H), 7.50 (d, J = 2.6 Hz, 2H), 7.41 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 2H), 7.39 (s, 1H), 7.36 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 7.33 (dd, J = 8.3, 2.2 Hz, 2H), 3.75 (s, 4H), 3.73 (s, 2H). Anal. calc. for C23H19Cl2NO4: C, 62.17; H, 4.31; N, 3.15%. Found: C, 62.11; H, 4.27; N, 3.11%. Main FT-IR absorptions (KBr pellets, cm−1): 2853 (w), 1674 (s, –CHO), 1445 (m), 1384 (m), 1279 (m), 751 (w). ESI-MS (positive mode, m/z): 444.08 {H2Qj}+. UV-vis spectrum, λ/nm (ε/L·mol−1·cm−1) in MeOH: 342 (7180). Light-green single crystals of disalicylaldehyde H2Qj in block shape were successfully obtained from its chloroform solution by slow evaporation in air at room temperature for five days.

Cs+ and CH2Cl2 sensing experiments
Disalicylaldehyde H2Qj was firstly dispersed in MeOH ([M] = 0.5 mM) during sensing Cs+ experiments, and then solved in CH2Cl2 ([M] = 0.5 mM) for sensing Cs+ under different solvents. 1 ml of the prepared H2Qj suspension was transferred to volumetric flasks, followed by the addition of a specific content of alkali metal ions ([M] = 5 mM) and the same volume of MeOH using a precise pipette to maintain the total volume of mixtures at 10 mL. At the same time, under the specific content of Cs+ ([M] = 5 mM), same volumes of different organic solvents were added to the 1 ml of H2Qj and CH2Cl2 suspension for studying the solvent effect, and different volumes of CH2Cl2 were added into 1 ml of H2Qj suspension (DMF, MeOH and THF) for studying the CH2Cl2 sensing. Shake treatments were applied to these mixtures to keep uniform dispersion for further spectral measurements. The final concentration of H2Qj in all mixed solutions remained at 50 μM.
Crystal structure determination and refinement
The single-crystal sample of dialdehyde H2Qj was covered with glue and mounted on glass fiber for data collection. Crystallographic data were collected at 293(2) K on a Bruker SMART 1 K CCD diffractometer, using graphite monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Absorption corrections were performed for all data and the structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares method on Fobs2 by using the SHELXTL-PC software package.86 All non-H atoms were anisotropically refined and all hydrogen atoms were inserted at the calculated positions assigned by fixed isotropic thermal parameters and allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms. A summary of the crystal data, experimental details and refinement results for H2Qj is listed in Table S1.† Selected bond lengths and bond angles of H2Qj are tabulated in Table S2,† and hydrogen-bonding parameters are shown in Table S3.†
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel optical sensor for rapid and selective Cs+ and CH2Cl2 detection based on the N-linked disalicylaldehyde H2Qj. Except for visual absorption changes induced by coordination interactions, the efficient Cs+ sensing depends on the fluorescent switch of H2Qj involving the LMCT-enhanced fluorescence in solution, which is also associated with the dipole moment of the solvent, resulting in a significant turn-off fluorescent response to CH2Cl2. Further titration experiments prove that LOD values for detecting Cs+ and CH2Cl2 are about 0.37 mM and 0.37% (v/v). It was also found that this LMCT-induced Cs+ sensing process is effective in the range of pH = 7–11 and the sensor H2Qj can show satisfactory reversibility after several cycles by pH regulation. Cs+ sensing is also investigated in real water samples. We believe that our proposed H2Qj-Cs sensing system may provide new insights into not only the quick and reusable detection of Cs+ in Cs-containing waste water of the nuclear power industry but also convenient and easy methods for monitoring CH2Cl2.
