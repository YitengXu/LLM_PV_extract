    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 17th August 2018AbstractPhotocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CH4, a promising approach to reduce the depletion of fossil fuels and concomitant global warming, is greatly limited by the production of CO and H2 by side reactions. Rational design of co-catalysts holds promise to address this grand challenge. In this paper, via the transformation from a random A1 alloy phase to an ordered B2 intermetallic phase, order engineering is performed on PdCu co-catalysts to realize enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity in reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4. Based on the experimental results of PdCu co-catalysts with different ordered degrees of atomic arrangement obtained through tuning the annealing temperatures and Pd/Cu molar ratios, two effects are proposed to contribute to this enhancement: (1) the strong electronic interaction between Pd and Cu atoms in the periodic structure increases the electron trapping ability of ordered PdCu co-catalysts; (2) the periodic structure increases the number of isolated Cu atoms in the ordered PdCu co-catalysts, which act as highly active catalytic sites in the reduction of CO2 to CH4. This work represents a step toward the design of high-performance photocatalysts through lattice engineering of the co-catalysts with atomic precision.
Introduction
The utilization of solar energy for the conversion of CO2 into valuable organic products, such as methane (CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O), is one of the best solutions to address the increasing energy and environment related concerns resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels as well as the resulting emission of CO2.1–5 Since the discovery by Inoue et al. in 1979,6 various semiconductor materials have been developed as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction reactions, such as TiO2,7,8 C3N4,9,10 WO3 (ref. 11 and 12) and Zn2GeO4.13 Considering that the photocatalytic activities of pristine semiconductors are greatly limited by the serious photo-generated electron–hole recombination in the bulk as well as the low absorption and activation ability of stable CO2 molecules on the surface,14 metal co-catalysts, including Pt,15,16 Pd,17,18 Au,19 Ag20 and Ru,19,21 have been integrated with semiconductors for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels. Co-catalysts not only trap the photogenerated electrons from light-harvesting semiconductors for promoting the electron–hole separation, but also offer alternative surface catalytic sites for CO2 reduction reactions.22,23 Nevertheless, owing to the lack of rational design of co-catalysts, multiple reaction routes (e.g. CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O) as well as side reactions (e.g. 2H+ + 2e− → H2) take place simultaneously on the surface of co-catalysts, greatly decreasing the yield and selectivity of CH4.24,25
During the design of co-catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions, composition is one of the most important parameters.26,27 The composition of co-catalysts not only determines the adsorption configuration of CO2 molecules, but also steers the d-band centers of active sites, which can thus be tailored to tune the photocatalytic activity and selectivity. Recently, alloy co-catalysts have been developed to improve the photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction reactions through the synergism of different atoms.19,28–30 For instance, a previous report has shown that the incorporation of Cu atoms into the lattice of Pd co-catalysts creates paired Cu–Pd sites for enhanced CO2 adsorption and elevates the d-band center of isolated Cu sites for improved CO2 activation for realizing high-selectivity CH4 production.28 However, atomic distribution is statistically random and disordered in alloy co-catalysts. Thus various local atomic arrangements are present in the lattice of alloy co-catalysts, which greatly reduce the synergism of different metal atoms and prevent the acquisition of a clear structure–activity relationship.
Considering the limitation of composition adjustment, lattice engineering through precise positioning of atoms in a crystal lattice is also indispensable during the surface structure optimization of alloy co-catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the transformation of disordered PdCu alloy co-catalysts into long-range ordered intermetallic PdCu co-catalysts not only enhances the electron trapping ability, but also boosts the number of isolated Cu sites for improved photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CH4. As a proof of concept, the designed ordered Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts supported by C3N4 nanosheets achieve excellent photocatalytic CH4 production with an average evolution rate of 4.95 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and selectivity of 96.5% under visible light irradiation. This work offers a versatile approach to realize the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals with high activity and selectivity through precisely controlling the lattice of co-catalysts.
Experimental
Synthesis of C3N4–PdCu, C3N4–PdCu-250 and C3N4–PdCu-375 samples
In a typical synthesis of C3N4–PdCu samples, PdCu alloy nanoparticles were first synthesized and then self-assembled with exfoliated C3N4 nanosheets. In a typical synthesis of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles, Pd(acac)2 (7.6 mg), Cu(acac)2 (13.3 mg), and 5 mL of oleylamine were added into a 10 mL vial, which was further ultrasonicated for 60 min. The homogeneous mixture was then heated at 200 °C for 12 h. The as-obtained nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with a cyclohexane/ethanol mixture. Pd1Cu1 and Pd2Cu1 nanoparticles were synthesized under the same experimental conditions as Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles except different amounts of Pd(acac)2 and Cu(acac)2 were used (11.4 mg of Pd(acac)2 and 9.8 mg of Cu(acac)2 for the synthesis of Pd1Cu1 nanoparticles; 15.2 mg of Pd(acac)2 and 6.5 mg of Cu(acac)2 for the synthesis of Pd2Cu1 nanoparticles, respectively). The as-obtained PdCu nanoparticles were re-dispersed in cyclohexane with a determined molar concentration of 5 mmol L−1. To realize the deposition of PdCu nanoparticles on C3N4 nanosheets, 20 mg of C3N4 nanosheets were redispersed in 10 mL of the cyclohexane/ethanol mixture (1:1 volume ratio). Subsequently, 1 mL cyclohexane suspension of PdCu nanoparticles was added to the dispersion. The mixture was further ultrasonicated for 10 min, and the as-obtained C3N4–PdCu samples were separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and acetic acid three times, respectively. The final product was then dried at 45 °C for 12 h. The C3N4–PdCu samples were then annealed at 250 and 375 °C under a 5% H2/95% N2 atmosphere for 1 h to obtain C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375, and C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
3.0 mg of the as-synthesized products were dispersed in a mixture of 10 μL ethanol and 10 μL Nafion, which were then uniformly spin-dropped onto 1 cm × 1 cm indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass using a spin coater (SC-1B, China). Subsequently, the ITO-coated glass was heated at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. The photocurrents were measured on a CHI 760E electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China) under ambient conditions and irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight, China). Visible light was used as the illumination source, which was realized by using both a 420 nm cutoff filter (long-wave-pass) and a 780 nm cutoff filter (short-wave-pass). The power density of this light was measured to be 100 mW cm−2 by using a radiometer (FZ-A, China). A three-electrode cell was used to perform the electrochemical measurements. The working electrode was the ITO-coated glass. A Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt foil were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. These three electrodes were inserted in a quartz cell filled with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The photoresponse of the prepared photoelectrodes (i.e., I–t) was obtained by measuring the photocurrent densities under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 60 s) at a bias potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 400 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the 10−1 to 105 Hz frequency range with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at an applied potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction measurements
To investigate the photocatalytic activities of C3N4-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, the photocatalysts were first baked in a vacuum oven at 200 °C for 2 h to remove possible carbonaceous residues prior to tests. Then, 15 mg of the photocatalysts were dispersed on a flat glass plate at the bottom of a 100 mL reactor purchased from Beijing Perfectlight Company (China). And 5 mL H2O was added, which surrounded the plate. Prior to the test, the reactor loaded with the catalyst was first purged with high purity CO2 (0.15 MPa) for 20 min. Then the light-irradiation experiment was performed by using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight, China) with visible light as the illumination source. The power density of visible light (780 > λ > 420 nm) was measured to be 100 mW cm−2 using a radiometer (FZ-A, China). The photocatalytic reaction was performed under visible light irradiation with stirring at 300 rpm for 4 h. After completion of the reaction, the products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu) with Ar as the carrier gas. The amount of H2 was determined using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The amount of CH4 was measured by using a flame ionization detector (FID). CO was converted to CH4 using a methanation reactor and then analyzed using the FID. During the stability test, the photocatalysts were collected and heat-treated at 160 °C for 3 h after each run and then reused for photoreduction of CO2. In the activity measurement of TiO2-based photocatalysts, UV light (λ < 420 nm) using a 420 nm cutoff filter (short-wave-pass) with a power density of 10 mW cm−2 was used instead of visible light with other experimental conditions unchanged. The samples were also tested in 0.15 MPa fresh Ar in the absence of CO2 but in the presence of H2O, which showed no activity to generate carbon products and thus confirmed that our following measurements were free of any carbon contaminants.
Results and discussion
Order engineering of PdCu co-catalysts based on different annealing temperatures
During the design of photocatalysts, graphitic-phase C3N4 (g-C3N4) nanosheets are used as visible light-harvesting semiconductor supporters, which have been widely used as photocatalysts in various applications.31–33 The C3N4 nanosheets are prepared via the ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4 synthesized according to a previous report (Fig. 1 and S1a†).34 The wrinkled C3N4 nanosheets are in nanoscale thickness and have a micrometer-sized edge length (Fig. S1b†). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of C3N4 (Fig. 2a) exhibits a weak (100) peak at 13.1° and a strong (002) peak at 27.4°, which corresponds to the in-planar repeating tri-s-triazine unit and characteristic interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic segments, respectively.35 The large surface area of the two-dimensional C3N4 facilitates the loading of co-catalysts, while its low thickness shortens the average transfer distance of photogenerated electrons from semiconductors to co-catalysts.36 Moreover, the unique conjugated structure of C3N4 ensures intimate contact between semiconductors and co-catalysts for highly efficient interfacial charge transfer.17

In the second step, Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles are pre-synthesized using a wet-chemical approach with a molar ratio of Pd(acac)2 to Cu(acac)2 of 1:2, which are then deposited on the surface of C3N4 nanosheets by sonicating the mixture of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles and C3N4 nanosheets in the cyclohexane/ethanol solution (Fig. 1a). After washing with ethanol several times, acetic acid treatment is used to remove the residual surfactant coating. The strong electrostatic interaction between PdCu and C3N4 is helpful for the high stability of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles on the C3N4 as well as the effective electron transfer between them.37,38 As shown in the TEM images of the as-obtained C3N4–Pd1Cu2 (Fig. 1b and c), Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the surface of C3N4 nanosheets, indicating that C3N4 nanosheets effectively prevent the Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles from aggregation after the removal of capping agents. The average size of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles is determined to be 5.5 nm (Fig. S2†). In the XRD pattern of the C3N4–Pd1Cu2 (Fig. 2a), in addition to the peaks of C3N4, all other peaks correspond to the face-centered cubic (fcc, A1) phase of the PdCu alloy (ICDD 01-071-7854). Continuous lattice fringes are shown in the HRTEM image of Pd1Cu2 (Fig. 2d), indicating the single-crystal nature of these nanocrystals. The d-spacing of the lattice fringes is 2.2 Å, which is assigned to the (111) plane of the A1 phase. As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the actual molar ratio of Pd to Cu in the as-synthesized C3N4–Pd1Cu2 is 46.9:53.1, suggesting that more Pd is reduced in comparison with Cu during the formation of the PdCu alloy (Table S1†). Moreover, the loading amount of Pd1Cu2 in the C3N4–Pd1Cu2 is measured to be 1.72 wt% (Table S1†).
Thirdly, monodisperse Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles on C3N4 nanosheets are readily converted into structurally ordered intermetallic ones through a simple annealing treatment in a 5% H2/95% N2 atmosphere for 1 h, which is performed at 250 and 375 °C to obtain C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375, respectively. As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 1e, f, h and i), C3N4 nanosheets maintain the uniform distribution of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles without any aggregation/sintering during the heating treatment. After this treatment, there is no obvious change in the average size of Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals in the C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 samples (Fig. S2†). In spite of this, there is an obvious change in the crystal structure of Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals. In comparison with the XRD pattern of C3N4–Pd1Cu2 (Fig. 2a), the peaks of the A1 phase become weaker in that of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250, while new peaks corresponding to the ordered body-centered cubic (bcc, B2) phase of intermetallic PdCu (ICDD 01-078-4406) appear, suggesting that the disordered Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals have been partially converted to ordered ones to obtain a structure with mixed A1 and B2 phases. Moreover, resulting from the ordered atomic arrangement in the B2 phase, the newly formed peaks are much sharper as compared with those of A1 ones. The HRTEM image of the Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles in C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 (Fig. 1g) is consistent with the XRD results, in which the 2.2 Å spacing can be indexed to the (111) plane of the PdCu A1 phase, while the 2.1 Å spacing is in agreement with the (110) plane of the B2 phase. When the annealing temperature further increases to 375 °C, the peaks of the A1 phase disappear, while the peaks of the B2 phase become stronger, indicating that the disordered PdCu alloy nanocrystals have been completely converted to ordered intermetallic PdCu ones. This state is further confirmed by the HRTEM image (Fig. 1j), in which unique periodicity can be observed in the ordered monocrystalline structure. The d-spacings of lattice fringes are measured to be 3.0 and 2.1 Å for different PdCu nanoparticles, which are in good agreement with the {100} and {110} planes of the PdCu B2 phase, respectively. It can be concluded that the ordered degree of Pd and Cu atoms in Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals increases with the increase of annealing temperature, indicating that this ordering process is a diffusion-dependent transformation process. The higher annealing temperature accelerates atomic diffusion rates and overcomes the required activation barrier for ordering. The ordered Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals supported by C3N4 nanosheets are further verified using the scanning TEM (STEM) image of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 (Fig. 1k) as well as the corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 1l–o) results. The ICP-MS results show that there is no obvious change in the loading amount of PdCu and the Pd:Cu molar ratio in the C3N4–Pd1Cu2 after the annealing treatment (Table S1†).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) are further used to obtain the chemical composition and structural information of the C3N4 based samples. As shown in Fig. 2b, the FTIR spectra of the three samples only exhibit the characteristic peaks of C3N4, including the breathing mode of triazine units (810 cm−1), aromatic C–N heterocycles (1000–1800 cm−1) and N–H stretching (3000–3600 cm−1),39 suggesting that the deposition of Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals as well as the following annealing treatment does not change the chemical structure of C3N4. Survey XPS spectra indicate the presence of C, N, O, Pd and Cu elements in the three samples (Fig. S3a†). The O1s peak is overlapped by that of Pd3p, which can only be detected in the spectrum of pristine C3N4. The small amount of O is ascribed to the adsorbed H2O and C–O stemming from the incompletely reacted oxygen-containing intermediates during the synthesis of C3N4.40 Through comparing the survey XPS spectra of different samples, it can be seen that there is no obvious change in the content of the four elements after the annealing treatment, which is consistent with the above FTIR and ICP-MS results. The high-resolution C1s spectra of the samples can be deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 284.5, 286.2 and 287.8 eV, corresponding to graphitic carbon (C–C), residual C–O and sp2-bonded carbon (N–CN), respectively (Fig. 2c).41 In the high-resolution N1s spectra, three peaks centered at 398.4, 400.3 and 404.1 eV are observed, which are attributed to sp2-hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms (CN–C) involved in the triazine rings, quaternary N bonded to three carbon atoms in the aromatic rings [N–(C)3], and π-excitations, respectively (Fig. 2d).41 In comparison with the C1s and N1s high-resolution spectra of C3N4 (Fig. S3c and d†), some C1s and N1s peaks of the C3N4–Pd1Cu2 samples are at lower binding energies, suggesting the occurrence of an electronic interaction between C3N4 and Pd1Cu2.42 The palladium species are determined from the high-resolution XPS spectra in the Pd3d region, which can be split into two doublets (Fig. 2e). The main doublet centered at binding energies of 335.0 and 340.3 eV is in agreement with the Pd3d5/2 and Pd3d3/2 lines of zero-valence palladium, while the shoulder one at 336.3 and 341.6 eV is ascribed to Pd(II).43 Similarly, the high-resolution Cu2p spectra can also be split into two doublets (Fig. 2f). The Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 peaks centered at 932.5 eV and 952.4 eV can be indexed to Cu(0), and the other two at a 1.6 eV higher binding energy are the characteristic peaks of Cu(I).43 In addition to Cu2p, Cu LMM Auger spectra are also used to analyze the valence state of Cu, which can be deconvoluted into 914.2 and 918.2 eV, corresponding to Cu(I) and Cu(0), respectively (Fig. S4†).44 It is clear that the majority of Pd and Cu atoms in these PdCu nanocrystals are in the metallic state. When the high-resolution XPS spectra of the three samples are compared, it can be seen that there is no obvious difference in the relative intensities of different peaks in the C1s and N1s regions, further highlighting the stable chemical structure of C3N4. Nevertheless, in the high-resolution Pd3d spectra, the ratio of Pd(0)/Pd(II) increases from C3N4–Pd1Cu2 to C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and then to C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375. In contrast, the molar ratio of Cu(0)/Cu(I) in the Cu2p and Cu LMM spectra is in the opposite trend. The reason is that the ordering of Pd and Cu atoms in PdCu nanoparticles enhances the electronic interaction between Pd and Cu.45 The more uniform distribution of Cu and Pd atoms in the ordered Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles contributes to the high coordination of Pd and Cu atoms, thus leading to a strong change in the electronic structure. The altered electronic structures of ordered PdCu nanocrystals may not only enhance the photo-generated electron trapping ability, but also provide a better opportunity for the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules for enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Considering that the ultimate activity of photocatalysts is greatly dependent on the generation and transfer of photo-induced electrons, the charge kinetics of the C3N4-based samples are investigated prior to the photocatalytic performance analysis. UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra are first used to reveal the light absorption abilities of the C3N4-based samples. As shown in Fig. 3a, the C3N4–Pd1Cu2, C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 exhibit the same absorption edge at around 460 nm, consistent with the optical bandgap of 2.7 eV for C3N4.46 Moreover, optical absorption beyond the absorption edge of C3N4 is also observed for the three samples, which is ascribed to the absorbance of Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals through exciting the bound electrons to high energy levels via interband transitions.47 During the photocatalytic reactions, C3N4 rather than Pd1Cu2 is the light-harvesting component considering that the Pd1Cu2 is a nonplasmonic metal in the visible region and cannot be excited by photons to produce hot electrons. As shown in Fig. S5a,† the suspension of pure Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles exhibits a black color with a weak plasmonic absorption band in the UV region. As a result, the three samples in gray color exhibit comparable light absorption abilities in the visible region owing to the similar contents of C3N4 in them (Fig. S5b†), guaranteeing their equivalent abilities for generating photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, as revealed by the valence-band XPS spectra (Fig. S3b†), the valence band of C3N4 is in the same position for the three samples, revealing that the electronic structure of C3N4 in the C3N4–Pd1Cu2 is not altered after the annealing treatment.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra of C3N4, C3N4–Pd1Cu2, C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375; (b and c) photocurrent vs. time (I–t) curves (b) and EIS Nyquist plots (c) of C3N4, C3N4–Pd1Cu2, C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl under visible light (420 < λ < 780 nm) irradiation; (d) PL spectra of C3N4, C3N4–Pd1Cu2, C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 excited at 390 nm. 
With the comparable capability for generating photo-induced charge carriers, photocurrent measurements are further used to compare the electron–hole separation abilities of the C3N4-based samples. As shown in Fig. 3b, the loading of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles significantly boosts the photocurrent density of C3N4 under visible light irradiation, confirming the electron trapping behavior of the Pd1Cu2 in promoting the electron–hole separation in C3N4. This statement is further confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra. The smaller arc radii on the EIS Nyquist plots as compared with that of pure C3N4 suggest much lower interfacial charge transfer resistances for the three samples (Fig. 3c). Meanwhile, the PL intensity of C3N4 at 435 nm is dramatically quenched after the introduction of Pd1Cu2, indicating that the Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles efficiently inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes through radiative pathways (Fig. 3d). The work functions of Pd (∼5.1 eV) and Cu (∼4.7 eV) are larger than that of C3N4 (∼4.3 eV), ensuring the transfer of photo-induced electrons from C3N4 to Pd1Cu2 through forming a Schottky junction.17,48 More importantly, the photocurrent responses are found to be in the sequence of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 > C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 > C3N4–Pd1Cu2, suggesting an improved electron–hole separation efficiency in the presence of ordered Pd1Cu2 (Fig. 3b). This statement is further confirmed by the reduced radii of the semicircular Nyquist plots and increased PL quenching degree from C3N4–Pd1Cu2 to C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and to C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 (Fig. 3c and d). Based on the above results, it can be concluded that intermetallic Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles with a higher ordered degree of atomic arrangement realize more efficient trapping of electrons from C3N4 for facilitating the separation of photo-excited electrons and holes. It should be noted that C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 actually exhibits a PL signal, which cannot be clearly seen in Fig. 3d owing to it being much weaker in comparison with that of C3N4.
Order engineering of PdCu co-catalysts based on different Pd/Cu molar ratios
In the above discussion, order engineering is performed on Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles with the determined composition. To further explore the influence of chemical composition on the order transformation of PdCu as well as the ultimate photocatalytic performance, Pd1Cu1 and Pd2Cu1 nanoparticles are also synthesized under the same experimental conditions as Pd1Cu2 except the molar ratio of Pd(acac)2 to Cu(acac)2 is tuned to 1:1 and 2:1, which are then deposited on the surface of C3N4 nanosheets to obtain C3N4–Pd1Cu1 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1 samples, respectively (Fig. 4a). Ultimately, C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375 are obtained through annealing the corresponding samples at 375 °C in a 5% H2/95% N2 atmosphere (Fig. 4a). The TEM images of the four samples further display their nanosheet-supported nanoparticle structures (Fig. 4b, c, e, f, h, i, k and l). Both the Pd1Cu1 and Pd2Cu1 nanoparticles before and after the annealing treatment are evenly anchored on the C3N4 nanosheets without any change in the morphology. The diameters of the PdCu nanoparticles are measured to be 9.1, 7.5, 8.8 and 8.0 nm for C3N4–Pd1Cu1, C3N4–Pd2Cu1, C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375, respectively (Fig. S6†). The molar ratios of Pd to Cu in the C3N4–Pd1Cu1, C3N4–Pd2Cu1, C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375 samples are 66.6:33.4, 78.7:21.3, 65.2:34.8 and 79.2:20.8, respectively, and the loading amounts of PdCu in the four samples are much similar (Table S1†).

XRD patterns exhibit the fcc phase of PdCu nanoparticles before the annealing treatment (Fig. S7†), which is also proved by the highly crystalline features of the PdCu nanoparticles with adjacent fringes of 2.2 Å in the HRTEM images, corresponding to the (111) plane of the A1 phase (Fig. 4d and g). After the annealing treatment, there is no obvious change in the distance between lattice fringes (Fig. 4j and m), revealing the failure in the complete conversion of the A1 to the B2 phase. This statement is further confirmed by the comparative XRD patterns of C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375 with that of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375. As shown in Fig. 5a, both the peaks of the A1 and the B2 phase are found in the C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375, while only the peaks of the A1 phase are found in the pattern of C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375. Moreover, the intensities of the B2 peaks of C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 are much weaker as compared with those of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375. The XRD results suggest that the order degree of PdCu declines with the increase in the content of Pd. Moreover, it can be found that there is no obvious difference in the positions of the XRD peaks of B2 phase between C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 and C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375. In contrast, the XRD peaks of the A1 phase slightly move to lower angles from C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 to C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375. The shift of the A1 peaks can also be seen in the comparative XRD patterns of C3N4–Pd1Cu1 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1 before the annealing treatment (Fig. S7†). Generally, in the disordered A1 phase of PdCu, Pd atoms and Cu atoms are randomly distributed to form an alloy structure. Thus the combination of more Pd atoms with Cu atoms slightly increases the lattice constant considering the smaller atomic radius of Cu in comparison with Pd, which is in accordance with the shift of A1 peaks to a lower angle with the increased Pd content (Fig. 5a and S7†), while in the PdCu B2 phase, the ordered arrangement of Pd and Cu atoms leads to the formation of an intermetallic structure. Considering the determined atomic arrangement mode in the PdCu B2 phase, the molar ratio of Pd/Cu is a fixed value in the intermetallic PdCu structure. The given structure and composition of the B2 phase contribute to the unchanged positions of the XRD peaks. The stable composition of the B2 phase also gives an explanation for the composition-dependent order degree. As discussed before, the disorder–order phase transformation is carried out through atomic diffusion.49 When the Pd/Cu molar ratio of the PdCu precursor is consistent with the composition of the B2 phase, A1 PdCu can be completely converted to the B2 phase. When there is a certain gap in the Pd/Cu molar ratio between the PdCu precursor and B2 phase, only a part of Pd and Cu atoms can be reconstructed to form the regions of the B2 phase, while the others exist as the residual A1 phase. When the composition of the precursor is far away from that of the B2 phase, the conversion cannot be realized through a solid–solid transformation. Given the molar ratios of Pd:Cu in the C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375, C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375 are 48.4:51.6, 65.2:34.8 and 79.2:20.8, respectively (Table S1†), the actual molar ratio of Pd:Cu in the B2 PdCu phase may be less than the theoretical value of 1:1. This result is in agreement a with previous report, in which the A1 PdCu nanoparticles with an atomic ratio of 1:1 can be transformed into nanoparticles composed of an ordered B2 PdCu core and a segregated Pd thin shell.49

The chemical compositions and structures of the C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 samples are further compared with those of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 via FTIR and XPS characterization. As revealed by the FTIR spectra (Fig. 5b), there is no obvious difference in the structure of C3N4 between the three samples, which can also be reflected by their similar C1s and N1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5c and d and S8a†) as well as valence-band XPS spectra (Fig. S8b†). Nevertheless, the different Pd/Cu molar ratios in the samples are emphasized by the Pd3d and Cu2p spectra. As shown in Fig. 5e and f (also in Fig. S8a and c†), from C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 to C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and to C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375, the intensities of Pd3d peaks gradually increase, while the intensities of Cu2p and Cu LMM peaks decrease, indicating the ever-increasing Pd/Cu molar ratio.
We then compare the charge kinetics of the C3N4–PdCu and C3N4–PdCu-375 samples with different Pd/Cu molar ratios. As shown in Fig. 6a, all the samples exhibit a similar light absorption behavior, which is attributed to the approximative content of C3N4—the light-harvesting component in the gray samples considering there is no plasmonic absorption in the visible region for PdCu nanoparticles with different Pd/Cu molar ratios (Fig. S9†). What's more, as revealed by the photoelectrochemical measurements, it is interesting that the photocurrent responses are in the order of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 > C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 > C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375, while the results of C3N4–PdCu samples without annealing treatment are in the opposite order (C3N4–Pd2Cu1 > C3N4–Pd1Cu1 > C3N4–Pd1Cu2) (Fig. 6b). It is widely accepted that the electron trapping ability of a metal is largely determined by its work function. In virtue of the work function of Pd (∼5.1 eV) being larger than that of Cu (∼4.7 eV), the higher content of Pd contributes to the stronger electron trapping ability of PdCu,43 which is in agreement with the photocurrent results of C3N4–PdCu samples. The different photocurrent results of C3N4–PdCu-375 samples further underline that the electron trapping ability of PdCu after the annealing treatment is not only dependent on the composition, but also dependent on the order degree of atomic arrangement. As discussed above, the order degree of the annealed PdCu nanoparticles decreases with the increase in the content of Pd, contributing to the decline in the electron trapping ability. The composition and order degree-dependent electron trapping abilities of PdCu before and after the annealing treatment are further confirmed by the changes in the arc radius of Nyquist plots and the PL intensity of the samples (Fig. 6c and d).

Photocatalytic performance and mechanism analysis
Given the detailed structural and charge kinetic information, the as-obtained C3N4-based samples are then used as photocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction, which are irradiated using visible light in the mixed vapor of CO2 and H2O, and the products are subsequently measured by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. 7a, the loading of PdCu before and after the annealing treatment significantly prevents the formation of H2 in pure C3N4 and increases the production of CO and CH4. The electron trapping behavior and altered surface catalytic kinetics confirm the co-catalytic roles of them during the photocatalytic process. Through comparing the photocatalytic activities of C3N4–PdCu samples before the annealing treatment, it can be seen that the average production rate of CH4 gradually increases from 0.26 μmol gcat−1 h−1 of C3N4–Pd1Cu2 to 0.40 μmol gcat−1 h−1 of C3N4–Pd1Cu1 and to 0.90 μmol gcat−1 h−1 of C3N4–Pd2Cu1. As a result, the selectivity for CH4 production increases from 57.6% to 63.9% and to 83.4%, which is calculated according to the average evolution rates of the products as well as the electrons required to generate reduction products using the following equation:Selectivity(%) = [8ν(CH4)]/[2ν(H2) + 2ν(CO) + 8ν(CH4)] × 100%when the order engineering is performed on Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts, the average CH4 production rate increases to 3.00 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and 4.95 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375, respectively. Meanwhile, the average formation rate of CO increases first and then decreases with C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 reaching the maximum value. Consequently, the selectivities for CH4 production are calculated to be 93.4% and 96.5% for C3N4–Pd1Cu2-250 and C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375, respectively. Namely, both the photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CH4 production increase with the increase in the order degree of Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles. The ordered atomic structure-dependent photocatalytic activity of the co-catalysts is further confirmed by the comparative photocatalytic results of C3N4–PdCu-375 samples with different Pd/Cu molar ratios. The annealed Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts with higher atomic ordering contribute to the superior average production rate and selectivity for CH4 production as compared with the annealed Pd1Cu1 (1.79 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 with 89.4% selectivity) and Pd2Cu1 (0.94 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375 with 85.0% selectivity) ones. Namely, the average production rate of CH4 increases by 19.1, 4.5 and 1.1 times for C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375, C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375 after the heat treatment, respectively, emphasizing the positive contribution of the surface atomic ordering of co-catalysts to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 7  (a) Average H2, CO, and CH4 evolution rates with C3N4-based samples as photocatalysts as well as their selectivities for CH4 production under visible light (420 < λ < 780 nm) irradiation; (b) average CH4 evolution rates with C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 as the photocatalyst in four successive cycles under visible light (420 < λ < 780 nm) irradiation; (c) average H2, CO, and CH4 evolution rates with TiO2-based samples as photocatalysts as well as their selectivities for CH4 production under UV light (λ < 420 nm) irradiation. 
The highest average evolution rate and the exciting selectivity of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 for CH4 production indicate that the ordered Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles are ideal co-catalysts in reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4, which is further confirmed by the higher average rate and superior selectivity for CH4 production in comparison with those of previously reported state-of-the-art C3N4-metal photocatalysts (Table S2†).16,17,21,25,50 Furthermore, the designed C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 also realizes an excellent photocatalytic stability without an obvious decline in the CH4 production after four cycles (Fig. 7b). The TEM images show that ordered Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles are still firmly attached to the C3N4 nanosheets without any change in their shape after the cycles (Fig. S10†). Moreover, the same positions and relative intensities of the peaks in the XRD patterns and XPS spectra show that there is no obvious change in the chemical composition and structure of C3N4 and ordered Pd1Cu2 after the cycles (Fig. S11†). It should be noted that O2 as an oxidation product is also detected in the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the occurrence of H2O + 2h+ → 1/2O2 + 2H+. Furthermore, in the absence of CO2 (under an Ar gas atmosphere), the formation of CO and CH4 is negligible for the photocatalysts, confirming that CO and CH4 are formed from photocatalytic CO2 reduction rather than light-driven carbonaceous residue decomposition.51
To further confirm the contribution of atomically ordered structures of intermetallic PdCu co-catalysts to the enhanced photocatalytic performance in the conversion of CO2 to CH4, TiO2 nanosheets as UV-excitable semiconductor supporters are further integrated with Pd1Cu2 nanoparticles followed by the annealing treatment at different temperatures to obtain TiO2–Pd1Cu2, TiO2–Pd1Cu2-250 and TiO2–Pd1Cu2-375 (Fig. S12, see experimental details in the ESI†), and their photocatalytic performances are then measured under UV light irradiation. Note that the loading amounts of the Pd1Cu2 on TiO2 (ca. 1.0 wt%) are lower than those on C3N4 owing to the smaller specific surface area of thicker TiO2 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 7c, both the average rate and selectivity for the CH4 production are in the order of TiO2–Pd1Cu2-375 > TiO2–Pd1Cu2-250 > TiO2–Pd1Cu2, suggesting that the relationship between the order degree of PdCu co-catalysts and the photocatalytic performance is independent of the semiconductor supporter, the loading amount of co-catalysts and the light excitation wavelength.
Then the question is why the order engineering of the PdCu co-catalysts contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic performance. Generally, the activities and selectivities of semiconductor-based photocatalysts are greatly determined by the comprehensive behaviors of light absorption, charge transfer and separation, and the surface catalytic reaction.14 Considering the approximative light absorption abilities of the C3N4-based samples, the different electron trapping abilities and surface reactive kinetics of the co-catalysts may be the main reasons. According to the previous discussions on photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions, the high electron trapping ability of co-catalysts may facilitate the 8-electron reduction of CO2 to CH4 as compared with the 2-electron reaction for producing CO.2,5 As illustrated in Fig. 8a, in terms of the C3N4–PdCu samples without annealing treatment, due to the larger work function of Pd, the higher electron trapping ability of PdCu co-catalysts with the increased content of Pd contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic activity in CH4 production. On the other hand, according to the atomic model of the ordered intermetallic structure of PdCu, each Pd atom is surrounded by eight Cu atoms and vice versa (inset of Fig. 8a). The periodic structure facilitates the diffusion of photogenerated electrons to the surface of the co-catalysts. Meanwhile, the intimate contact between Pd and Cu atoms in this periodic structure improves the electronic interaction between them. As a result, the electronic structure of the ordered PdCu is changed and the electron trapping ability of the co-catalysts is enhanced, which increase the reducibility of the surface of the co-catalysts and are beneficial for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.52 The atomic ordering-dependent electron trapping mechanism well explains the best photocatalytic performance of C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 considering that other PdCu co-catalysts obtained at different annealing temperatures or Pd/Cu molar ratios exhibit lower order degrees or lower amounts of the ordered intermetallic phase (Fig. 8a).

In addition to the electron trapping ability, varied surface reaction kinetics of the co-catalysts may be another important reason for the ordering engineered photocatalytic performance. Generally, the surface structure of co-catalysts has a great significance on the catalytic reaction pathway and exerts an influence on the photocatalytic activity and selectivity.53 As mentioned before, a previous report has shown that the Cu atoms isolated in the Pd lattice provide highly active catalytic sites for the enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation to achieve the high-selectivity CH4 production.28 Through analyzing the surface atomic structures of PdCu alloy co-catalysts without annealing treatment, it can be seen that a higher Pd/Cu molar ratio facilitates the formation of nearly isolated Cu atoms in the Pd lattice when Pd and Cu atoms are randomly distributed. Thus the photocatalytic activity and selectivity in CH4 production increase with the increase in the Pd/Cu molar ratio, which is in conformity with the photocatalytic results of C3N4–PdCu samples (Fig. 8a). In particular, in the Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts with an actual Pd/Cu molar ratio of nearly 1:1, the random atomic arrangement in the A1 phase leads to the formation of many catalytically inactive Cu-rich regions. As for the annealed Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts, the order transformation produces the B2 intermetallic phase where Cu sites are completely isolated by Pd atoms. With the increase in the annealing temperature, the higher order degree of Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts increases the number of isolated Cu sites for superior photocatalytic performance (Fig. 8a). It should be noted that further increasing the annealing temperature leads to sintering of the Pd1Cu2 nanocrystals, which prevents the complete conversion of the A1 phase to the B2 phase and decreases the photocatalytic activity and selectivity in CH4 production (Fig. S13†).49 Similar to the annealed Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts, the number of isolated Cu sites may also increase in the lattice of Pd1Cu1 and Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts after the annealing treatment. When all the Cu atoms in the annealed co-catalysts are considered as the isolated ones, the number of isolated Cu atoms in the annealed PdCu co-catalysts is only determined using the content of Cu. Namely, the number of Cu sites reduces from C3N4–Pd1Cu2-375 to C3N4–Pd1Cu1-375 and to C3N4–Pd2Cu1-375, which is in line with the decreased photocatalytic activity and selectivity in CH4 production with the increase of Pd/Cu molar ratio (Fig. 8a). Note that further decreasing the Pd/Cu molar ratio disfavors the formation of the ordered B2 phase considering the determined Pd/Cu molar ratio of the B2 phase. As shown in Fig. S14,† the higher Cu content not only reduces the number of isolated Cu sites in the Cu rich Pd1Cu3 nanocrystals before and after the annealing treatment, but also decreases their electron trapping abilities, thus leading to lower photocatalytic activities and selectivities in CH4 production.
Based on the discussion, two effects are believed to contribute to the atomic ordering-dependent photocatalytic activity and selectivity in the conversion of CO2 to CH4. On one hand, the order engineering improves the electronic interaction between Pd and Cu atoms and increases the electron trapping ability of PdCu co-catalysts, which facilitate the 8-electron reduction reaction in CH4 production. On the other hand, the order engineering boosts the number of isolated Cu sites in the surface lattice of PdCu co-catalysts, which act as highly active catalytic sites in the reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4. Owing to the highest order degree in the atomic arrangement, the annealed Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts achieve the highest electron trapping ability from C3N4 and the largest amount of isolated Cu sites for achieving the best photocatalytic performance in CH4 production (Fig. 8b).
Conclusions
In summary, order engineering is performed on PdCu co-catalysts for improved photocatalytic activity and selectivity in the conversion of CO2 to CH4, which is achieved through the annealing-driven disorder–order transformation from A1 alloy PdCu to B2 intermetallic PdCu. The atomic order degree of the as-obtained PdCu co-catalysts is greatly dependent on the annealing temperature and Pd/Cu molar ratio. Based on the experimental results of PdCu co-catalysts with different ordered degrees, it is found that the order engineering not only increases the electronic interaction between Pd and Cu atoms for enhanced electron trapping ability of PdCu co-catalysts for facilitating the 8-electron reduction reaction in CH4 production, but also produces the B2 intermetallic phase where Cu sites are completely isolated by Pd atoms, thus boosting the number of isolated Cu sites on the surface of PdCu co-catalysts in the reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4. Moreover, the electron trapping ability and the number of isolated Cu sites increase with the increase in the order degree of the co-catalysts. As a result, the annealed Pd1Cu2 co-catalysts with the highest electron trapping ability and the largest amount of isolated Cu sites achieve the highest average evolution rate of 4.95 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for CH4 production with a selectivity of 96.5% under visible light irradiation. This work demonstrates the importance of the lattice design of co-catalysts with atomic precision to maximize the synergistic effect between different atoms for enhanced solar-driven CO2 conversion.
