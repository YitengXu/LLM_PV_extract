    , Accepted 6th June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractRecently, in the arena of finding substitutes for lead-containing perovskite solar cells, the oldest selenium solar cells (SSCs) have been reconsidered by many scientists due to their suitable energy level structure and less-toxic nature. A lot of research efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of SSCs through seeking suitable substrates and modifying the process of Se crystallization. However, little attention has been paid to investigating the stability of SSCs. In addition, one crucial point that is neglected by researchers could be the potential applications of low-cost SSCs in complicated and tough environments, owing to the intrinsic physicochemical resistance of the Se material. To address these issues, in this research, SSCs with an elaborately designed architecture have been presented, and the highest efficiency (3.7%) among SSCs with organic hole transport layers was achieved. Additionally, a dozen of P3HT-based SSCs were demonstrated to maintain 92% efficiency after more than 1500 hours. The favorable long-term stability of the SSCs allowed us to carefully analyze the changes in each dynamic parameter during aging and helped explore the factors that affect the device behaviors. These results would pave the way for the application of the ultra-stable SSCs in harsh conditions.
Introduction
When measuring the resistance of selenium (Se) bars in 1873, Willoughby found that its conductivity increased greatly when a light was shined on the bars.1 In 1883, Fritts designed and fabricated the first Se-based cell with high photosensitivity.2 Almost 100 years later, Nakada et al. introduced the sputter-deposited TiO2 layer in SSCs and pushed the efficiency to 5.01%.3 In 2017, with the reliable MoOx as the hole-selective interlayer and ZnxMg1−xO (ZnMgO) as the buffer, the heterojunction SSCs reported by Todorov et al. achieved an efficiency of 6.51% with much better stability compared with perovskite solar cells.4 One reason for their better stability is the usage of only inorganic materials as the charge carrier transport layers.5 However, inorganic materials have obvious drawbacks compared with their organic counterparts,6 such as difficulties in solution processing and the modification of their energy level and band gap.6 Given that one of the possible reasons for the success of perovskite solar cells is the combination of reliable inorganic electron transport layers (ETLs) and diverse organic hole transport layers (HTLs) in one system,7–10 such hybrid sandwich structures have also been adopted in SSCs, and they could maintain a 3.52% efficiency after the one-month shelf-life test.11,12 However, multiple factors that influence the long-term performance of SSCs with organic HTLs have not been deeply investigated.5b In this work, strategies to improve the stability of SSCs are presented, and the possible factors that degrade SSCs have been discussed by analyzing the aging process.
To build highly stable SSCs, suitable charge carrier transport materials with excellent charge carrier extraction and transport abilities are necessary. TiO2 has been widely adopted as an ETL in organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells13–19 due to its large band gap, suitable energy levels for charge injection and extraction, and the long lifetime of the excited electrons.13,20 However, TiO2 suffers from serious internal weaknesses, such as low electron mobility (only about 3.3 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1), instability of mesoporous TiO2-sensitized solar cells arising from the light-induced desorption of surface-adsorbed oxygen, the existence of charge traps caused by bulk oxygen vacancies, titanium interstitials, and reduced crystal surfaces.21–24 In contrast, SnO2 possesses higher mobility (1.9 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1), wider bandgap, better optical transparency, less UV light absorption, and lower hygroscopicity and acidity resistance compared to the traditional TiO2.7,25–27 Brabec et al. applied SnO2 together with C60-SAM and PCBM in the hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells and achieved an efficiency of more than 21%.28 Under continuous 1 Sun illumination in a home-built chamber filled with N2, this unencapsulated device could maintain almost 95% of its efficiency after 1000 hours.28 However, even though SnO2 has better stability and similar carrier transport properties compared with TiO2, it has rarely been used to replace TiO2 in SSCs.3,29–31 Thus, in this work, we chose SnO2 as the ETL and substrate to grow Se polycrystalline films for the construction of SSCs. We found that the efficiency of SSCs gradually increased in a certain period. The phenomenon was similar to the results reported by Ito et al. using CdSe as the substrate5b and by Todorov et al. employing ZnMgO as the buffer layer.4 Furthermore, by analyzing the aging dynamic process, we could understand stress formation in the Se crystal and provide some guidelines to avoid it in the future.
Compared with small molecules, polymers have the advantages of π-electron delocalization along the conjugated chains, high regioregularity and greater stability,32,33 among which PTAA and P3HT are widely used as hole transport materials.34–39 For example, when doped with a fluorine-containing hydrophobic Lewis acid, PTAA-based perovskite solar cells showed long-term stability of up to 70 days under air exposure without encapsulation.40 Seo et al. reported that P3HT-based perovskite solar cells with a modified perovskite layer exhibited substantial long-term stability, maintaining more than 95% of the initial PCE for 1370 h.37 The efficiency of PTAA- and P3HT-based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells were found to decrease only slightly under continuous 1 Sun light soaking at 85 °C for 1000 h.41 Since both PTAA and P3HT have shown promising long-time stability and are not supposed to be the “short slab” of the whole devices, it was logical for us to employ them as HTLs in SSCs.
In this research, SSCs with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/Se/HTL/Ag were designed and fabricated with P3HT or PTAA in the HTLs. Notably, SSCs with such a specific and simple structure have not been reported before. The device performances with P3HT and PTAA as HTLs were compared, and the P3HT-based SSC showed an open-current voltage (Voc) of 758.18 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.43 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 57.50%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.7%. To the best of our knowledge (Table S1, ESI†), this PCE value is the highest reported among the SSCs with organic materials as HTLs, and SSCs with SnO2 as the ETL showed better performance than SSCs with TiO2 ETLs. The reasons that the P3HT-based devices showed better performance were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, dark current–voltage curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Furthermore, the PTAA-based SSCs showed very poor stability due to serious aggregation and the inferior film quality of PTAA, while the P3HT-based devices could maintain their performance for more than 1500 h. Additionally, the aging process was divided into three stages for detailed analysis. At the initial stage, with the release of the internal stress inside the Se film, the fill factor was enhanced, and the corresponding efficiency slightly increased. At the second stage, the tensile stress continued to release, while the Voc started to decrease due to degrading factors, such as the diffusion of metal atoms from the anode. In this situation, the efficiency started fluctuating. At the final stage, with the complete release of stress, the associated degrading factors became dominant, leading to decreased Voc and PCE. These achievements in our work could greatly benefit the development of SSCs with organic carrier transport layers.
Results and discussion
The device architecture is shown in Fig. 1a; SnO2 was spin-coated as ETL on the ITO-coated glass substrate. The SnO2 precursor was prepared from the commercially available SnO2 aqueous colloid. A discontinuous thin Tellurium (Te) layer was thermally deposited on the surface of SnO2 before the Se layer to enhance the adhesion of the Se layer.3 Then, a 200 nm-thick Se layer was deposited on the SnO2/Te substrate to form an amorphous thin film. After following the gradient annealing process reported by Kanatzidis et al., the Se film was transformed into dark polycrystalline t-Se with a smooth surface.42 Then, a HTL, P3HT or PTAA, was spun on the Se active layer without any doping. The metal electrode used here was Ag due to its better conductivity. The energy level diagram of SSCs with the above-mentioned structure is shown in Fig. 1b. The energy level data was obtained from previously reported works.21,41,42 The conduction band (−3.8 eV) of the Se layer was much higher than that (−4.6 eV) of the SnO2 layer, which meant that the photo-generated electrons would easily transfer to the SnO2 layers. The valence band of the SnO2 layer (−8.0 eV) was much lower than that of the Se active layer (−5.64 eV), which would block the drifting of holes inside the absorber layer. The LUMOs of P3HT (−5.0 eV) and PTAA (−5.1 eV) were much higher than the valence band of the Se layer, which could benefit hole extraction from the Se layer. Thus, the energy levels of the charge carrier transport layer matched well with that of the Se active layer, and no charge carrier energy barriers existed. The adaption of suitable HTLs in SSC's may lead to further improvement of reported SSCs.5,43Fig. 1c and d show the chemical structures of P3HT and PTAA. The thickness of the Se layer was measured by the quartz crystal monitor of the evaporation equipment. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the Se-based solar cell were measured under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). No light soaking was used. The devices were measured immediately when they were fixed on a holder. The measurements were made under ambient conditions (temperature: 25 °C, humidity: 80%). The scan scope was 0–1.2 V, and the step size was 50 mV.

The C–V characteristics of SSCs with P3HT and PTAA as HTLs are shown in Fig. 2a, and their photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. The P3HT-based SSC exhibited the PCE of 3.70% with a Voc of 758.183 mV, a Jsc of 8.43 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 57.50%, while the PCE of the PTAA-based SSC was 1.90% with a Voc of 474.00 mV, a Jsc of 8.08 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 50.10%. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), previously reported devices with TiO2 as the ETL were listed and compared, including those SSCs with the same HTLs, namely PTAA and P3HT. With the same fabrication process (thermal evaporation) as that used this work, the efficiency (0.62%) of SSC with the FTO/TiO2/Se/PTAA/Ag structure was much lower than that of the SSC with the ITO/SnO2/Se/PTAA/Ag structure in this work (1.90%). The PCEs of SSCs with the FTO/TiO2/Se/P3HT/Ag structure were also lower than that found in this work (3.70%) for the ITO/SnO2/Se/P3HT/Ag structure. Therefore, the comparison with previously reported works proved the advantages of SnO2 fully and could serve as a reference for further research. The overall performance of the P3HT-based SSC was much better than those of the PTAA-based devices. The reasons could be the smooth P3HT film on the SnO2/Se substrate and good passivation of the Se surface by the thiophene units in P3HT. The charge carrier extraction and transport properties of the P3HT- and PTAA-based SSCs were investigated through dark current measurements and EIS investigation. Fig. 2b shows the comparison of the dark current density–voltage curves of the P3HT- and PTAA-based devices. The saturated dark current density J0 was determined as the intercept of the linear regression at zero voltage in the semi-logarithmic J–V plot in the region close to the diode turn-on voltage.44 From Fig. 2b, the J0 of the device with PTAA as the HTL was estimated to be larger than those of the devices with P3HT as the HTL. High J0 indicated high leakage current density and significant carrier recombination outside the depletion region, which would negatively affect Voc and the fill factor.44 The impedance behaviours in the different HTL-based SSCs are shown in Fig. 2c, and the data is summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The equivalent circuit is provided in Fig. 2c. In Table S2 (ESI†), the series resistance R1 of P3HT-based device (28.64 Ω) is smaller than that of the PTAA-based device (41.77 Ω), which could explain the larger Jsc and fill factor of the P3HT-based device. Fig. 2d shows that the recombination resistances R2 of the P3HT-based devices were an order of magnitude higher than those of the PTAA-based devices under varying voltage. Higher recombination resistance means low recombination rate, and the difference between these two kinds of devices was only the HTLs, which indicated that P3HT could efficiently passivate the surface of the Se active layer and suppress surface trap recombination.45 The reason could be that the sufficiently weak Lewis base, thiophene unit, of P3HT has the ability for the electronic passivation of the under-coordinated Se atoms within the lattice. Similar to the Pb atoms in the perovskite solar cells and according to Snaith's postulation, the loss of Se molecules during a high-temperature annealing process may result in unsaturated or under-coordinated metal ions to be frequently found on the surface and at the grain boundaries of the crystals.46 This under-coordination of the Se atom could result in the formation of a net positive charge on the atom, which would then create favourable conditions for coordination or bond formation with electron-rich molecules containing an available lone pair of electrons, such as the thiophene group. The electrostatic attraction between the positive charge on the metal and the lone pair electrons would facilitate the formation of a coordinate or dative covalent bond.46 Passivating these defect sites would lead to suppressed surface recombination, which increases the value of the recombination resistance R2 and Voc of the P3HT-based devices.

Fig. 2e–h compare the performance of fifteen P3HT- and PTAA-based SSCs. As seen in Fig. 2f and g, the Voc and fill factor of the P3HT-based SSCs were greatly larger than those of the PTAA-based SSCs, which could be attributed to the lower series resistance of the P3HT-based SSCs and better passivation of the Se surface by P3HT, as discussed above. Moreover, the values of Voc and the fill factor of the P3HT-based SSCs varied slightly around the average value; however, these parameters changed dramatically for the PTAA-based SSCs, as shown in Fig. 2f and g, which proved that P3HT-based SSCs showed better repeatability. The reason is related to the morphology of the ETLs.
The morphology of P3HT on the Se substrate was explored by AFM measurements. Fig. 3a and b show the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) polycrystalline structure of the Se surface on the SnO2 substrates. The grains of polycrystalline Se were very smooth and clearly identifiable due to the distinguished grain boundary. The Se grain size was as large as 600 nm, which exhibited good Se film qualities, similar to that in perovskite thin films.36–38 SnO2 was thus proven to be a suitable substrate to grow Se films and can be used in other kinds of SSCs, which need deeper work functions. Fig. 3c and d show the 2D and 3D AFM images of the P3HT film on the Se substrate. As shown in Fig. 3c, P3HT could homogeneously cover the falling/rising Se grains without exposing the grain boundary of the Se film, which implied that P3HT could greatly prevent direct contact between Ag and Se atoms. In Fig. 3d, no grain boundary could be found. All the bumpy areas were evenly covered by the amorphous P3HT molecules, and there was no obvious aggregation, which indicated that P3HT was evenly distributed on the Se surface. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the Se film was 29.629 nm, and the RMS roughness of the P3HT film on the Se substrate was 22.969 nm, which implied that P3HT could smoothen the rough Se substrate and form a compact contact with the metal cathode. With respect to the morphology of the PTAA film, PTAA had aggregated seriously on the Se surface and formed dark points (Fig. S1, ESI†). The high roughness and uneven surface made it impossible to conduct AFM measurements. Therefore, only the enlarged microscopic image is provided in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The shiny area at the left bottom corner was due to the Ag electrode. The area above represented the PTAA film on the Se substrate, where lots of dark points were visible due to the aggregation of PTAA on the Se substrate. Moreover, the rough PTAA surface made it difficult to form sufficient contact with the metal anode, which would greatly impede the carrier transport process, leading to high series resistances in the PTAA-based SSCs. Additionally, the serious aggregation of PTAA inevitably caused insufficient coverage on the Se film, which made it easier for the Ag atoms to diffuse through the relatively thinner part of the PTAA films (such as grain boundaries) and reach the Se surface.47 An important piece of evidence was the reduction in Voc with the diffusion of Ag, which matched with our results.47 This would also be the reason for the high J0 of the PTAA-based SSCs. In contrast, P3HT was evenly distributed on the Se surface, and no grain boundaries were exposed, because of which the Ag atoms could hardly diffuse into the Se layer, leading to the improved stability of the whole device. Furthermore, the unpredictability of the serious aggregation in the PTAA film would also cause huge differences between individual devices and hence, poor repeatability.

The crystalline properties of the annealed Se layer and the effect of HTLs on the surface of polycrystalline Se were studied through XRD measurements. Fig. 4 shows the XRD pattern of the annealed Se layers with/without HTLs on the ITO/SnO2/Te substrates. The desired phase with an efficient photovoltaic effect was the t-Se phase, which had the main typical reflections at 23.5° (100), 29.7° (101), 41.36° (110), 45.40° (111) and 51.76° (201).42 In Fig. 4, all of the three Se layers with/without HTLs show typical t-Se peaks, and the strongest intensity peak located at 23.5° suggested that these three kinds of Se layers were preferably oriented along the (100) plane, parallel to the substrate. The favourable qualities of the crystalized Se layer on the SnO2 substrate guaranteed the good performance and stability of the SSCs. The weaker peak of the PTAA-covered Se film at 41.36° (110) may be influenced by the strongly-aggregated and unevenly-distributed rough PTAA layers.

The long-term stability test for the P3HT- and PTAA-based SSCs without encapsulation was conducted in the nitrogen atmosphere. The devices were kept under dark conditions during storage. Unlike the previous stability tests, where only one device was tracked, a dozen of devices were measured and recorded to rule out other occasional factors, seek the possible issues that affect the stability, and provide the whole picture about the stability of the SSCs. The measurement atmosphere was in the ambient condition (temperature of 25 °C and humidity of 80%), which was different from the storage environment. The reason that a nitrogen environment was required for storage was that the device fabrication unit in our lab is next to and connected to the organic chemical synthesis lab, where the air is filled with organic solvents. All kinds of solvents, together with moisture, would bring untraceable damages to our devices. Therefore, to maintain a consistent condition for storage and study the internal degradation processes, the inert environment was adopted as the storage environment. The duration of each measurement was about half an hour. The percent variations of the property parameters during the aging of SSCs are presented in Fig. 5. The efficiency of those 12 devices were maintained at 92% after more than 1500 hours. The device dynamics during aging were analysed. From Fig. 5d, one could find out that the PCE of the SSCs gradually increased for more than 700 hours, and the reason could be the stress relief in the Se crystal lattice.5 Here, we proposed that the source of crystal stress inside the Se film might be a lattice mismatch. Se, which exists as a polycrystalline layer in SSCs, might have the lattice mismatches with the crystalized metal oxide substrate. The lattice mismatch would then cause the formation of internal stress and defects during the crystallization process of Se, which would result in the poor performance of the as-fabricated devices. But after releasing the stress for a certain time, the cell characteristics would gradually increase and reflect in the fill factor performance. In Fig. 5c, the fill factor can be seen increasing until 816 h (strain releasing). By comparing our results with other works, which have shown increased efficiency after aging, we observed that the lattice constants (a and b) are supposed to have a negative relationship with the stress releasing time of the Se film (Table S3, ESI†). In other words, the bigger difference in the lattice constants between the Se film and the substrate, the longer is the time needed to release the tensile stress. After 1000 hours, the PCE slightly decreased to 92% of the initial value. The reason for this may be related to the diffusion of Ag.46 In contrast, PTAA-based devices showed very poor stability (Fig. S3, ESI†). The reason could be the poor quality of the PTAA films covering the Se substrate, which makes it much easier for the Ag atoms to diffuse towards the Se surface and destroy the Se surface.

Fig. 6a and b show the AFM images of P3HT covering the Se layer after 1920 hours, which are similar to the initial AFM images (Fig. 3c and d) from immediately after the devices were fabricated. These results prove the superior qualities of the SnO2/Se/P3HT configuration. One more interesting thing is that the RMS roughness of the P3HT film spun on the Se substrate after 1920 hours was 16.897 nm, which is smaller than that of the newly formed P3HT layer. The reason was that after the release of stress in the Se crystal lattice, the Se surface was more uniform and smoother, which further improved the flatness of the P3HT film. As seen in Fig. 6c, the recombination resistance of the P3HT-based devices slightly decreased after 1800 hours, which might be because, after the diffusion of the Ag atoms towards the Se surface, a Se–Ag alloy was formed, and under-coordinated Se ions were generated, which could increase the surface traps and non-radical recombination, as well as decrease the Voc slightly.

From the above discussions, we could divide the aging process into three stages. At the first stage (yellow part in Fig. 5), with the tensile stress of the well-passivated Se film releasing and protection by the P3HT HTL, the efficiency slightly increased in the first 816 h. In the second stage (purple part in Fig. 5), although the stress was released, the PCE performance started to fluctuate due to the counteraction of degrading factors, such as the diffusion of Ag atoms. The detailed process could be explained by the Gaussian distribution of device performance (Fig. 5); the efficiency at 936 h dropped but the fill factor raised slightly compared with the performance at 816 h, which meant that the speed of strain release could not counteract the degradation of the Se films. The efficiency at 1036 h greatly increased, the highest efficiency was similar to that at 720 h, and the median of the Gaussian distribution was slightly higher than that at 816 h, which indicated that during these hundreds of hours, the strain release was dominant, and the efficiency recovered. At the third stage (green part in Fig. 5), the PCE decreased to 92% of the initial value after another 500 hours since the stress relief process ended, and the degrading factors became dominant. The C–V curves for the same device at the different stages of the aging (stress release) process are provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†) in two different presentation styles in ESI.† Even though the trend in Fig. S2 (ESI†) was not as clear as that in Fig. 5, Voc in Fig. S2 (ESI†) showed some fluctuation at the beginning and ended in a decreasing trend, which approximately matched with Fig. 5b. Thus, the factors that could affect the stability of SSCs with polymer HTLs are summarized below: (i) the intensity of tensile stress inside the polycrystalline Se film and its releasing rate; (ii) the interaction between the HTL and Se layers; (iii) the morphology and stability of the polymer-based HTL and the diffusion of the atoms from the metal anode; (iv) high quality of the Se polycrystalline layer. Degradation of electronic devices is inevitable; however, in the future, finding a suitable inorganic ETL, which controls the stress releasing rate to counteract the natural degradation rate of the whole device, could lead to SSCs that possess very steady efficiency and ultra-long-term stability.
Conclusions
In this work, we adopted SnO2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL to fabricate well-performing SSCs with long-term stability (more than 1500 h). The commercially available SnO2 was proven to be a suitable substrate for growing polycrystalline Se films. In addition, the efficiencies of the polymers P3HT and PTAA as HTLs were compared. P3HT showed lesser aggregation and sufficiently covered the uneven Se grains, as well as grain boundaries, which is the one of key points to achieve better efficiency and long-term stability than those of PTAA-based SSCs. The proper stability of SSCs with organic HTLs in this work enabled us to further study the strain releasing process in the Se active layer and its interaction with the external degrading factors. The possible elements influencing the tensile strain inside the Se films were discussed, and the relationship between the morphology of HTL and the stability of the whole device was explored. This work indicates that with careful optimization, low-cost SSCs with high stability can be fabricated for extensive industrial applications.
