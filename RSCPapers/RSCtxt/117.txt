    , Accepted 12th June 2017First published on 13th June 2017AbstractA titanium oxide-selenide (TiO1.1Se0.9) composite material was successfully obtained on a flexible substrate of carbon cloth (CC); this TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode was used as the counter electrode (CE) in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Each carbon fiber in the CC was wrapped with a composite layer of TiO1.1Se0.9, and the composite layer contained TiO1.1Se0.9 nanospheres and one-dimensional (1D) nanorods. Thus, each carbon fiber with its TiO1.1Se0.9 layer has a hierarchical core–shell structure, in which the carbon fiber acts as a one-dimensional conductive core for electron transfer and the TiO1.1Se0.9 layer around the fiber functions as an electro-catalytic shell. In iodide-based electrolyte, the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC exhibits a power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.47%, which is higher than cells with CEs of Pt/CC (7.75%) and pristine TiO2/CC (4.90%). Under dim light conditions, the best TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode rendered its cell an η of 10.00% at 0.5 sun and the best η of 10.39% at 0.1 sun. In cobalt-based electrolytes, a DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC shows an attractive η of 10.32% at 1.0 sun, the best η of 10.47% at 0.5 sun, and an impressive η of 10.20% at 0.1 sun. The earth abundant and low-cost TiO1.1Se0.9 is a promising alternative to Pt for the CE of a DSSC in both iodide and cobalt electrolytes.
1. Introduction
Since dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered to be potential renewable power resources for outdoor and indoor applications, many scientists/engineers have devoted themselves to their perfection, with the intention of their rapid industrialization.1 Research studies in this regard are aimed at improving their conversion efficiency (η) and stability, reducing their production cost and thereby achieving their large-scale production, and making them viable for multiple applications. Research on the part of the counter electrode (CE) of a DSSC is aimed at not only improving the η of the cell, but also reducing the production cost of the cell. Generally, a platinum (Pt) film provides great electro-catalytic ability to the counter electrode of a DSSC, and thereby results in a high power conversion efficiency for the DSSC. However, Pt is expensive, rarely available, and already in demand for various chemical and electrochemical industries; it often reacts with the iodide electrolyte used usually in a DSSC.2 In the recent past, a lot of non-platinum electro-catalysts, e.g., alloys,3–5 conducting polymers,6 carbon-based materials,6,7 and transition metal compounds,2,6 have been developed as substitutes for platinum. Transition metal compounds (e.g., carbides, nitrides, phosphides, oxides, sulfides, selenides, and tellurides) have caught a lot of attention owing to their attractive advantages, e.g., low-cost, abundant availability, excellent electrochemical activity, good conductivity, and good stability.2,6 Among them, transition metal selenides (TMSe) are found to give the best electro-catalytic ability to their counter electrodes and thereby provide the highest cell efficiencies to the DSSCs. The following tendencies of the cell efficiencies of such DSSCs reveal this fact: NbSe2 (7.73%)8 > Nb2O5 (5.82%)9 > NbN (3.68%)2 > NbC (2.46%);2 MoSe2 (9.00%)10 > MoS2 (8.69%)10 > Mo2N (6.38%)11 > MoC (5.83%)2 > MoP (4.92%)12 > MoO2 (2.79%);13 FeSe2 (9.01%)14 > FeS2 (7.97%)15 > Fe3C (7.36%)16 > Fe3O4 (6.80%)17 > Fe2N (2.65%);18 CoSe2 (10.20%)19 > CoS (7.67%)20 > CoTe (6.92%)21 > Co3O4 (1.42%);20 NiSe2 (8.69%)22 > NiN (8.31%)23 > NiS (7.84%)24 > Ni2P (7.32%)25 > NiTe2 (7.21%)21 > NiO (5.04%);26 SiSe2 (8.20%)27 > Si3N4 (8.18%)27 > SiC (7.25%)28 > SiS2 (7.02%)27 > SiO2 (5.98%);27 Ru0.33Se (9.22%)29 > RuO2 (6.42%).30 As summarized in Table 1, TMSe materials exhibited many kinds of morphologies and are sometimes found to result in better efficiency of their DSSCs than Pt-based cells. Thus, TMSe materials can be considered as a promising substitute for Pt.

Moreover, titanium compounds and their composites, as counter electrode films, have been reported to result in high efficiencies of their cells, as high or even higher than those of cells with platinum films. Some such compounds and composites are titanium nitride (TiN),31–33 titanium carbide (TiC),2,34 titanium oxide (TiO2),35 titanium sulfide (TiS2),36 N-doped TiC,2etc. Thus, utilization of titanium selenide (TiSe) as the electro-catalyst for the counter electrodes of DSSCs appears to be a reasonable way to further increase the cell efficiency and reduce the fabrication cost of the DSSCs. In this work, we aimed to synthesize TiSe on a cheap, low-weight, flexible, and conductive carbon cloth (CC) as the counter electrode (Scheme 1). Employment of a CC as the conductive substrate is a good strategy to reduce the cost of the DSSC, because those most commonly used transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates (i.e., fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)) is rather an expensive component in a DSSC.37 We have coated a film of titanium dioxide on the CC (TiO2/CC) via a simple dip-coating process, and partially converted the TiO2 film into a titanium oxide-selenide (TiO1.1Se0.9) film on CC via a selenization treatment. The electrode of TiO1.1Se0.9-wrapped carbon cloth was thus described to have one-dimensional (1D) conductive cores of carbon fibers and electro-catalytic shells of TiO1.1Se0.9 for the reduction of I3− to I−. Within the core–shell structure of the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode, a hierarchical electron transfer route was established to provide lots of electro-catalytic active sites and 1D electron transfer pathways (vide infra).

2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of the counter electrode
The carbon cloths (CCs) were cleaned by soaking them for a week in an acidic mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid (H2O2:H2SO4 = 7:3 by volume). The CCs were then washed with de-ionized water several times, and dried at 50 °C before use. A titanium precursor solution containing titanium tetraisoproproxide (TTIP) and 2-methoxyethanol (at a weight ratio of 1:3) was used to prepare the TiO2 films on the cleaned CC substrates via a simple dip-coating process. By controlling the dip-coating cycles from 1 to 5, different TiO2 films with different amounts of TiO2 were obtained on the CCs; each dip-coating cycle was an immersion of the CC in a fresh titanium precursor solution for 5 min and then the drying on a hot-plate at 50 °C for 5 min. The obtained TiO2/CC electrodes prepared by different dip-coating cycles (1 to 5 cycles) were further converted to TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrodes by selenization. The elemental molar ratios in the electrodes of TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC were obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS analysis reveals that the Ti/O ratio in the TiO2/CC is stoichiometric (i.e., Ti/O = 1/2) and the Ti/O/Se ratio in the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC is 1/1.1/0.9. Therefore, the thus-obtained electrodes were denoted as TiO1.1Se0.9-1/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-2/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC, where the number represents the number of dip-coating cycles. The selenization was carried out via a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process in a tubular furnace under a flush of high purity argon (Ar, 100 sccm). The selenization steps were as follows: (1) the TiO2/CC electrode was put in a graphite box containing two selenium pellets, (2) the graphite box was slightly closed and placed at the center of the furnace, (3) the temperature of the furnace was rapidly elevated in 10 min to the selenization temperature of 400 °C, and (4) the box was kept at that temperature for 30 min and then allowed to naturally cool down.
The TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrodes were thus obtained. For the purpose of comparison, a pure TiO2/CC electrode was prepared by the above-mentioned dip-coating process applying 3 dip-coating cycles, and a Pt/CC electrode was prepared by using a method of direct current (DC)-sputtering;55 that is to say, no selenization was used in these cases.
2.2. DSSC assembly
A 15 μm-thick TiO2 film, containing an 10 μm-thick transparent layer (home-made transparent paste) and a 5 μm-thick scattering layer (home-made scattering paste), was prepared on a cleaned FTO glass via the reported procedure.55 After being sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air, the TiO2 film having an active area of 0.16 cm2 was immersed in a N719 dye (5 × 10−4 M in acetonitrile/tert-butanol = 1/1 by volume) at room temperature for 24 h. Finally, dye-adsorbed TiO2 was assembled with a counter electrode, using a 60 μm-thick Surlyn® as the spacer. The iodide-based electrolyte contained 1.2 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.035 M iodine (I2), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile/3-methoxypro-pionitrile (8/2 by volume). For the cobalt-based electrolyte system, a 12 μm-thick TiO2 film, containing an 8 μm-thick transparent layer (home-made transparent paste) and a 4 μm-thick scattering layer (home-made scattering paste), was prepared via the same procedure. Here, another kind of the home-made scattering paste for the cobalt-based electrolyte was prepared by adding 250 wt% of commercial TiO2 particle (US3547, w.r.t. the weight of TiO2 nanoparticle) in previous home-made transparent paste. The post-treatment of titanium chloride (TiCl4) was carried out in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution in ethanol and de-ionic water (EtOH:DIW = 1:9 by volume) at 70 °C for 30 min. The sintered TiO2 film was immersed in 3 × 10−4 M HL5 (ref. 56) dye solution (with 10 mM of chenodeoxycholic acid as the co-adsorbent) at room temperature for at least 12 h using a mixed solvent of acetonitrile/tert-butanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (ACN/TBA/DMSO = 3.5/3.5/3 by volume). The cobalt-based electrolyte used in this work contains 0.35 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (CoII(Phen)3(TFSI)2), 0.05 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt tris(trifluoromethanesulfon-imide) (CoIII(Phen)3(TFSI)3), 0.8 M TBP, and 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) in acetonitrile. The ESI† gives details of materials and analytic techniques used in this study.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectra
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy was used to derive crystalline phases of the electrodes of titanium oxide/CC (TiO2/CC) and titanium oxide-selenide/CC (TiO1.1Se0.9/CC), while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to explore the elemental bindings in these electrodes. The synthesized TiO2/CC electrode consisted of a white TiO2 film on the black carbon cloth, while the newly synthesized TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode consisted of a red film on the black carbon cloth, as shown in the right hand side photos in Scheme 1. Here, an obvious color change from white to red happened after the selenization treatment of the TiO2/CC; this indicates that certain changes occurred in the crystalline phase or elemental binding in the TiO2. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2/CC (lower black curve) and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC (upper red curve). In agreement with the database of Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS, card No. 73-1764) for XRD peak identification, both of the TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrodes exhibit the crystal phase of anatase TiO2, based on the peaks at 25.4°, 37.1°, 37.9°, 38.7°, 48.2°, 54.1°, 55.2°, 62.9°, 69.0°, 70.5°, and 75.3° (marked with black squares). Besides, TiO1.1Se0.9/CC shows extra peaks at 29.8°, 32.8°, 42.2°, and 51.7° (marked with red stars), indicating the presence of hexagonal TiSe2 (JCPDS, card No. 74-1142). Since the newly synthesized TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode consists of anatase TiO2 and crystalline TiSe2, the CC can be considered as covered with the composite material of these two compounds.
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of the TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC; XPS spectra of (b) titanium 2p orbital of the TiO2/CC, (c) titanium 2p orbital of the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC, (d) selenium 3d orbital of the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC, (e) oxygen 1s orbital of the TiO2/CC, and (f) oxygen 1s orbital of the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC. 

Fig. 1b and c show titanium (Ti) 2p orbitals of the TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrodes, respectively. Fig. 1b has two peaks at 464.5 eV (for Ti 2p1/2 orbital) and 458.7 eV (for Ti 2p3/2 orbital), both referring to the Ti–O bonds of TiO2. Fig. 1c has four peaks: (1) two peaks at 464.5 eV (for Ti 2p1/2 orbital) and 459.0 eV (for Ti 2p3/2 orbital), both referring to the Ti–O bonds of TiO2, (2) one peak at 458.2 eV (for Ti 2p3/2 orbital), referring to the Ti–Se bond of TiSe, and (3) one peak at 457.3 eV (for Ti 2p3/2 orbital), referring to the Ti–C bonds between the titanium-based compounds and the carbon cloth. With reference to the TiO2/CC electrode (Fig. 1b), the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode (Fig. 1c) exhibits additional bonds of Ti–Se and Ti–C; the former indicates that the selenization caused crystalline transformation from TiO2 to TiSe, and the latter points out the bond formation between the TiO1.1Se0.9 film and its CC substrate. Fig. 1d shows selenium (Se) 3d5/2 orbital of the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode. The peak at 56.2 eV refers to Se–C bond of TiSe with carbon, and the other peak at 55.3 eV indicates the Se–Ti bond of TiSe. The bond formation between Se and Ti once again verifies the presence of TiSe2 crystals in the crystalline composite material of TiO1.1Se0.9.

Fig. 1e and f show oxide (O) 1s orbitals of the TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC, respectively; both of them exhibit one peak at 530.4 eV, referring to O–Ti bond of TiO2. It can be seen that the selenide in the TiO1.1Se0.9 has a bond with the CC substrate (Se–C bond), and the oxide in the TiO1.1Se0.9 has no bond with it. Thus, the adhesion between the CC substrate and the film of TiO1.1Se0.9 is supposed to have occurred essentially due to the bindings between the TiSe and the CC, rather than due to an adhesion between the TiO2 and the CC. In brief, the chemical bindings in the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC not only confirms the formation of the composite of TiO1.1Se0.9, but also confirms the adhesion of the composite to the CC substrate.
3.2. Morphology
The conductive carbon cloth (CC) used in this study is a foldable and low-weight substrate (Scheme 1, left-side photos); as shown in the scheme, the CC has an extremely low weight that a very soft flower with needle-like petals can withstand its weight without enduring the slightest strain. In the CC substrate, many bundles of the carbon fibers are interlaced to form a conductive network (Scheme 1, middle image); each carbon fiber in the CC provides fast and one-dimensional (1D) electron transfer pathways.47,57,58 When different electro-catalysts (Pt, TiO2, and TiO1.1Se0.9) are deposited on the CC substrates, uniform electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC can be obtained (Scheme 1, right-side photos). The surface morphologies of the electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), as shown in Fig. 2a–c, respectively. Fig. 2a shows an ultra-thin and discontinuous Pt film, composed of tiny Pt nanoparticles, on a carbon fiber in CC. Fig. 2b shows a film of TiO2 wrapped around a carbon fiber in CC, and plenty of interconnected TiO2 nanospheres are located on the TiO2 film. Fig. 2c shows the film of TiO1.1Se0.9 wrapped around a carbon fiber, and many nanospheres and nanorods of TiO1.1Se0.9 are grown on the TiO1.1Se0.9 underlayer. The TiO1.1Se0.9 nanorods are rather perpendicular to the surface of the carbon fiber; they, therefore, are expected to facilitate a fast and 1D electron transport from the CC substrate to the I3− at the interface of the CC with the electrolyte.47,59,60
 Fig. 2  FE-SEM images of the electrodes of (a) Pt/CC, (b) TiO2/CC, and (c) TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC; the insets were obtained at higher resolution. 
In accordance with the above-mentioned morphological observations, the electron transport routes in the electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC are schematically presented in Scheme 2. Scheme 2a shows Pt nanoparticles deposited on a 1D carbon fiber in CC; the Pt nanoparticles around the CC can act as the electro-catalytic active sites for I3− reduction, and the conductive carbon fiber of the CC can transport a main stream of electrons along its 1D direction. Scheme 2b and c show, respectively, the films of TiO2 and the composite of TiO1.1Se0.9 wrapped around 1D carbon fibers. Thus, both electrodes of TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC have similar core–shell structures, in which each 1D carbon fiber in CC is a conductive core and its wrapped film (TiO2 or TiO1.1Se0.9) is an electro-catalytic shell. The interconnected TiO2 nanospheres on the TiO2/CC electrode can be considered as the extended electro-active sites for I3− reduction; similarly, the nanospheres and nanorods of TiO1.1Se0.9 on the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode also stretch out as the extended electroactive sites. Accordingly, compared to the electrode of Pt/CC, the electrodes of TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9/CC certainly have rougher surfaces, more active sites, and multiple electron transfer pathways, indicating their preferable electrochemical morphologies. Compared to the electrode of TiO2/CC containing only TiO2 nanospheres on its TiO2 film (Fig. 2b, Scheme 2b), the newly synthesized composite film of TiO1.1Se0.9 contains many nanospheres and 1D nanorods (Fig. 2c, Scheme 2c). The TiO1.1Se0.9 nanospheres can work as electro-catalytic active sites, and the TiO1.1Se0.9 nanorods can function not only as electro-catalytic active sites but also as fast electron transport channels. In all, the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode was expected to provide lots of electro-catalytic active sites and hierarchical electron transfer routes, in which each carbon fiber in the CC serves for conducting the main stream of electrons through its 1D direction, and the wrapped film of TiO1.1Se0.9 (with many nanospheres and 1D nanorods) provides secondary channels of electrons for executing the reduction of I3− (Scheme 2c). Now, unlike the TiO2/CC electrode, the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode has 1D nanorods, thereby suggesting its additional ability to facilitate charge transfer at its surface with the electrolyte. It can be envisaged that the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode acts as a better counter electrode for a DSSC than the TiO2/CC electrode.
 Scheme 2  The core–shell sketches of the electrodes of (a) Pt/CC, (b) TiO2/CC, and (c) TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC. The correctional images show the hierarchical electron transfer route in these three electrodes, where the carbon fiber in the CC serves for transporting the main stream of electrons through its 1D direction, and the deposited electro-catalysts (Pt, TiO2, and TiO1.1Se0.9) provide secondary channels of electrons for executing the reduction of I3−. 
FE-SEM images of the electrodes of TiO1.1Se0.9-1/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-2/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC were obtained at different resolutions, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). All images in the first column of Fig. S1† show carbon cloths covered with different amounts of TiO1.1Se0.9. In the second column, owing to higher resolution (5 μm), one to three carbon fibers wrapped with the TiO1.1Se0.9 films can be seen in the images. In the third column, owing to much higher resolution (1 μm), single CC fibers wrapped with the TiO1.1Se0.9 films can be seen in all the images. The increase in the amount of TiO1.1Se0.9 is quite obvious, when one looks from the top to bottom FE-SEM images in the first column. The FE-SEM images of the TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC at 400 μm (first column) exhibit loosely attached TiO1.1Se0.9 films on the CC; this indicates a disproportionate or rather weak attachment of these TiO1.1Se0.9 films to the CC. The middle and right columns in Fig. S1† exhibit a lot of nanopspheres and nonorods of TiO1.1Se0.9 wrapped around single CC fibers, where the nanospheres often cover the nanorods (as in Scheme 2c). With the increase in the amount of TiO1.1Se0.9, a clear increase can be seen in the number of nanospheres and nanorods in the middle and right columns. As the nanospheres cover the nanorods heavily, the latter is rarely observed in the cases of the TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC electrodes.
Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray was employed to deliver an elemental distribution map for oxide (O) and selenide (Se) on the synthesized TiO1.1Se0.9 film, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In Fig. S2,† the green dots represent the signal of oxygen, which refers to the TiO2 parts in the TiO1.1Se0.9 film. It is observed that the green dots are uniformly distributed in all the three parts of TiO1.1Se0.9 film, which is the TiO1.1Se0.9 underlayer, nanospheres, and nanorods. Similarly, the red dots in Fig. S2† represent the signal of selenide, the TiSe2 parts in the TiO1.1Se0.9 film. The red dots also distributed equally in the underlayer, nanospheres, and nanorods of TiO1.1Se0.9 film. In other words, the underlayer, nanospheres, and nanorods on the TiO1.1Se0.9 film are all uniformly composed of the TiO1.1Se0.9 composite material. It can be said that the selenization reaction from the bare TiO2 to the TiO1.1Se0.9 film is uniformly transformed.
3.3. Photovoltaic performance
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with the counter electrodes of different TiO1.1Se0.9/CC (i.e., TiO1.1Se0.9-1/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-2/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC) are shown in Fig. 3a, and J–V curves of the DSSCs with the counter electrodes of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC (best cell) are shown in Fig. 3b. Accordingly, the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1† and 2, respectively. It is to be remembered here that the integer number in a TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode represents the number of dip-coating cycles of CC in titanium precursor solution, and thus the larger number means the more amount of TiO1.1Se0.9 materials on the CC substrate.

First of all, the DSSC with the counter electrode of a pure CC substrate without loading any catalyst was used to evaluate the substrate effect. The DSSC with pure CC shows a poor conversion efficiency (η) of 2.14%, as show in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The DSSCs with different TiO1.1Se0.9/CC CEs show good power conversion efficiencies (η) of 7.28–9.47% (Table S1†), indicating that the TiO1.1Se0.9 film wrapped on the CC substrate exhibited a much better electro-catalytic ability than the CC substrate and thus to improve the cell efficiency from 2.14% to at least 7.28%. It is reasonably established that the wrapped TiO1.1Se0.9 film functions as the electro-catalytic shell for I3− reduction in a TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode (Scheme 2c). When the dip-coating cycle number increases from 1 to 3, i.e., when the amount of TiO1.1Se0.9 increases on the CC, the values of open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) have all increased rather steadily. Due to the increase of this composite on the CC, the surface area of the pertinent counter electrode increases (see Fig. S1†), and its electro-catalytic activity increases for the reduction of I3− to I−. The increases in the catalytic abilities of the CEs with the increases in the dip coating cycles (1–3) are the main reasons for the increases in the JSC, VOC, and FF of the corresponding DSSCs.
In the cases of higher dip-coating cycles (TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC), the photovoltaic parameters decrease compared to those of the best DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC. We have observed this in the above FE-SEM images of the TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC that the composite TiO1.1Se0.9 materials in these electrodes are not well and completely attached to their CC substrates, and that the nanospheres of the composite materials cover their nanorods. Owing to these disadvantages, the electrodes of TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC are not expected to have better electro-catalytic performance, compared to TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC; consequently, their corresponding DSSCs are expected to show lesser performance than the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, indeed as is observed in Table S1.† On the whole, the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC shows the best performance and gives the best η of 9.47%, and this DSSC is therefore used for further comparison with those cells with the Pt/CC and TiO2/CC.
The DSSC with the Pt/CC exhibits an η of 7.75% with a VOC of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 16.76 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.66; the DSSC with the TiO2/CC shows an η of 4.90% with a VOC of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 14.53 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.48 (Table 2). All the DSSCs with the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC CEs show higher power conversion efficiencies (1.6–2.0 times) than that of the DSSC with the TiO2/CC. This phenomenon may be attributed to four advantages of the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode over against the TiO2/CC electrode: (1) a much rougher surface, and therefore much more electro-catalytic active sites (compare Fig. 2b and c), (2) a faster 1D charge transport channel due to the presence of nanorods on the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC surface (compare Fig. 2b and c), (3) better intrinsic electro-catalytic ability of the TiO1.1Se0.9 composite material (vide infra), and (4) higher conductivity of the TiO1.1Se0.9 composite (vide infra). Thus, these advantages provide a higher electro-catalytic ability to the TiO1.1Se0.9/CC electrode, compared to that of the TiO2/CC electrode. Interestingly, many DSSCs with the composite TiO1.1Se0.9/CC CEs (e.g., TiO1.1Se0.9-2/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, TiO1.1Se0.9-4/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-5/CC) all exhibit a higher VOC, higher JSC, similar FF, and thus higher η's than these values of the cell with the Pt/CC CE, indicating the outstanding electro-catalytic ability and attractive potential of this newly synthesized TiO1.1Se0.9 as a substitute for the noble Pt. Finally, the best TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode renders for its DSSC the highest η of 9.47%, with a VOC of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 17.22 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.70; this η is even 1.22 and 1.93 times higher than those of the cells with the Pt/CC and TiO2/CC CEs, respectively.
The performances of the cells with the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC were substantiated by their incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 3c. Under short-circuit conditions, the IPCE values of these DSSCs show a performance tendency of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC > Pt/CC > TiO2/CC, which agrees well with the tendency of the JSC values of these cells. The DSSC with the best TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode shows the highest IPCE value of about 95% in the visible light range from 400 to 600 nm, while the DSSC with the Pt/CC electrode shows a lower value of about 90% in the same wavelength range. Therefore, it can be said that this low-cost, highly efficient, TCO-free TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode has the potential to replace the expensive Pt electrode in DSSCs.
3.4. Electro-catalytic performance of various electrodes
To investigate electro-catalytic abilities of various electrodes toward the I−/I3− redox couple, their cyclic voltammograms (CV) and Tafel polarization curves were obtained in a dilute and concentrated iodide electrolyte, respectively. The analytical details are given in the ESI.† In the case of CV analysis, a dilute iodide electrolyte was used to explore the intrinsic and overall electro-catalytic abilities of the electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC. In Fig. 4a, the CV curves of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes all show symmetrical oxidation and reduction peaks, indicating that these electrodes are capable of catalyzing the I−/I3− redox reaction with good reversibility. In a DSSC, a counter electrode is supposed to quickly regenerate I−/I3− redox couple; in other words, a counter electrode is required to convert triiodide ions (I3−) into iodide ions (I−) rapidly at its interface with the electrolyte.6,61 Otherwise, the excess I3− could trap the photo-induced electrons at the photoanode and thereby cause poor cell efficiency. The overall electro-catalytic ability of an electrode is evaluated using two parameters:2,6 (1) the cathodic peak current density (Jpc) and (2) the peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp). The values of Jpc for the electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC were obtained by estimating their net peak heights from the cathodic current peaks to the peak backgrounds (blue-lined part in Fig. S4 in the ESI†), and the values of ΔEp for these electrodes were extracted from the potential differences between their anodic and cathodic peaks (green-lined part in Fig. S4†). Generally, the higher Jpc indicates the larger surface area on an electrode to conduct I3− reduction, while the smaller ΔEp reflects the fact that the lower overpotential is required to trigger the overall I−/I3− redox reaction and thereby the better intrinsic redox capability of an electrode toward I−/I3−. In other words, the Jpc is directly proportional and the ΔEp is inversely proportional to the overall electro-catalytic ability of an electrode.2,6
 Fig. 4  (a) Cyclic voltammograms, (b) Tafel polarization plots, and (c) electrochemical impedance spectra of the electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC. 
In Table 2, the Jpc values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes are 5.67, 1.25, and 8.16 mA cm−2, respectively, where the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC exhibited a much higher Jpc than those values of the Pt/CC and TiO2/CC electrodes. This result was attributed to the fact that the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC provided the most rougher surfaces (the most amount of electro-catalytic active sites) and lots of 1D nanorods as the faster electron transport channels (Fig. 2 and Scheme 2). The ΔEp values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes were 0.61, 0.84, and 0.61 V, respectively. The TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC showed a smaller ΔEp than that of the TiO2/CC electrode, indicating its better intrinsic redox capability toward I3− reduction. Since the heteroatom-doped TiO2 often rendered extra vacancies and defects as the electro-catalytic active sites,62–65 the newly synthesized TiO1.1Se0.9 composite material was fair to have better intrinsic redox capability than that of the pure TiO2.
Besides, the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC had comparable ΔEp to that of the Pt/CC electrode, implying that the TiO1.1Se0.9 composite material possessed similar intrinsic redox capability to that of Pt. From the Jpc and ΔEp values, it is certain that the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC has the highest electro-catalytic ability among the three types of electrodes, and thus it resulted in the highest JSC and the best η for its DSSC.
In the case of Tafel analysis, a concentrated iodide electrolyte was used to explore the practical overall electro-catalytic abilities of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes in an electrolyte used for DSSC. The Tafel plots of the electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC are depicted in Fig. 4b; these plots of logarithmic current density (LogJ) vs. voltage (V) were obtained by using a symmetric cell composed of the same electrode for both the anode and cathode. A Tafel plot can be divided into three zones: the first part at low potentials (|V| < 120 mV) represents the polarization zone, the second part at middle potentials (with a sharp slope) represents the Tafel zone, and the third part at high potentials (horizontal part) represents the diffusion zone.66 From the Tafel zone, the exchange current density (J0) of an electrode, tantamount to its electro-catalytic ability, is read from the cross point of two lines at 0 V; one is the extrapolation line of the anodic curve, and the other is the extrapolation line of the cathodic curve.66 The J0 values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC are 4.27, 1.41, and 6.46 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 2), indicating the electro-catalytic abilities of these electrodes indeed followed an order of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC > Pt/CC > TiO2/CC. From the diffusion zone, the Tafel curves of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC show almost the same limiting current density (Jlim), indicating that the diffusion of I3− is not dependent on the electrode and is nearly the same in all these electrodes.2 The electro-catalytic abilities of the electrodes are thus vindicated by their Jpc, ΔEp, and J0 values.
Moreover, the J0 value can be further used to calculate the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct-Tafel) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface.66 A smaller value of Rct-Tafel indicates a larger amount of electrons transferring through the electrode/electrolyte interface; this Rct-Tafel value is thus influenced by the electron conductivity and the charge transfer capability of the electrode.2Table 2 shows that the Rct-Tafel values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC are 3.01, 9.09, and 1.99 mA cm−2, respectively. The charge transfer at the electrolyte/TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC interface is much faster than that at the electrolyte/TiO2/CC interface; this is owing to the TiO1.1Se0.9 nanorods which can transport the electrons in one direction and thereby make the electron transfer faster. The charge transfer at the electrolyte/TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC interface is also better than that at the electrolyte/Pt/CC interface; it can be attributed to two reasons: (1) the TiO1.1Se0.9 nanorods on the electrode gave faster 1D charge transfer routes; (2) the well-wrapped TiO1.1Se0.9 film on each CC resulted in a more effective charge transfer network.
3.5. Electrical and impedance analyses of various electrodes
To investigate the electrical and impedance properties of the electrodes, a four-point probe and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were employed, respectively. By using the four-point probe technique, the electrical conductivities (σ) of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes were estimated to be 4.92, 0.68, and 9.83 S cm−1, respectively. The TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC has a much higher conductivity than the TiO2/CC, i.e., the composite film of TiO1.1Se0.9 has much higher conductivity than the pure film of TiO2. Besides, the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC also shows better conductivity than the Pt/CC. Although Pt is one of the most conductive metal materials, the ultra-thin and dis-continued Pt film only partially covered on each carbon fiber on CC and thus rendered a relatively lower conductivity to its electrode of Pt/CC, compared to the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode well covered by the TiO1.1Se0.9 film containing lots of 1D nanorods. It is to be noted that the electrical conductivities of the electrodes are in agreement with the fill factors of the corresponding DSSCs, i.e., both the electrical conductivities and fill factors follow the tendency of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC > Pt/CC > TiO2/CC.
In the case of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis, the interfacial resistances (e.g., the series resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct-EIS)) for the electro-catalytic film were investigated using the symmetric cell composed of the same electrode as both the anode and cathode. An iodide electrolyte, containing 1.2 M DMPII, 0.035 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN, and 0.5 M tBP in ACN/MPN (8/2 by volume), was used for the EIS analysis.
More details are given in the ESI.† Normally, the EIS using a symmetric cell exhibits two semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz.67,68 The onset of the left-hand side semicircle in the high frequency region (106 to 105 Hz) represents the series resistance (Rs) at the electro-catalytic film/substrate interface; the radius of the left-hand side semicircle obtained in the middle frequency region (105 to 101 Hz) reflects the charge transfer resistance (Rct-EIS) at the electro-catalytic film/electrolyte interface; the diameter of the right-hand side semicircle obtained in the low frequency region (101 to 10−1 Hz) refers to the Warburg diffusion resistance (Rdiff) in the iodide electrolyte.67,68 In Fig. 4c, the EIS spectra of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes showed the obvious differences in their left-hand side semicircles, but gave almost the same right-hand side semicircle. This indicates that the charge transfer phenomenon of the I−/I3− redox couple varies greatly for the three electrodes at their interfaces with the electrolyte, while the diffusion of I−/I3− redox couple was almost the same for these three electrodes.
The values of Rs and Rct-EIS were evaluated by fitting the equivalent circuit69 shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. In Table 2, the Rs values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes are 9.68, 5.84, and 5.69 Ω cm2, respectively; the lower Rs value reflects a better ohmic contact between the CC substrate and the electro-catalytic film. As compared to the Pt/CC, both of the TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC exhibit lower Rs values; this is due to better adhesion of TiO2 and TiO1.1Se0.9-3 to their CC substrates, compared to that of Pt to its CC substrate. The slightly better adhesion of TiO1.1Se0.9-3 to its CC substrate, compared to that of TiO2 to its CC substrate, may be attributed to the fact that the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC has extra chemical bonds between TiSe and carbon, compared to TiO2/CC (Fig. 1c and d). Both TiO2/CC and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC were prepared by the dip-coating process, indicating the low-cost and non-vacuum dip-coating process provided not only a good coverage of the film on the carbon fiber, but also a strong adhesion between the CC substrate and the film. The Rct-EIS values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes are 3.28, 9.38, and 1.20 Ω cm2, respectively (Table 2); a lower Rct-EIS implies a better electro-catalytic ability for the electrode; this in turn means that a larger amount of charge could pass through the electro-catalytic film/electrolyte interface.
On the other hand, the EIS technique was also used to evaluate the interfacial resistances in the DSSCs coupled with the counter electrodes of Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, measured under a simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light illumination. In Fig. S5,† three semicircles were observed in all samples; the diameter of the first semicircle on the left-hand side indicates the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at the electro-catalytic film/electrolyte interface in accordance with the equivalent circuit of DSSC (the inset of Fig. S5†).69,70 The Rct1 values of the Pt/CC, TiO2/CC, and TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrodes are 3.35, 9.57, and 1.28 Ω cm2, respectively (Fig. S5†), which agree well with their Rct-EIS values.
In summary, the electro-catalytic abilities of these electrodes are once again verified to follow the order of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC > Pt/CC > TiO2/CC; this trend is consistent with the tendency of JSC values of the pertinent DSSCs (Table 2). It is notable that the values of Rct-Tafel and Rct-EIS agree well for each electrode; these values also agree well with the values of Jpc, ΔEp, and J0. In summary, the electro-catalytic ability, conductivity, and interfacial resistivity of the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode, obtained by CV, Tafel, four-point probe, and EIS techniques, all agree well with the photovoltaic parameters of the best DSSC. All these values strongly justify the highest cell efficiency of the pertinent DSSC.
3.6. Photovoltaic performance in iodide-based and cobalt-based electrolytes at dim light
To reach higher cell efficiency, the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the best counter electrode of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC were measured at 1.0 sun (100 mW cm−2), 0.5 sun (50 mW cm−2), and 0.1 sun (10 mW cm−2), using the iodide-based (Fig. 5a) and cobalt-based (Fig. 5b) electrolytes. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. More details about the cobalt-based electrolyte are given in the ESI.† In an iodide-based electrolyte, the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC exhibits an η of 9.47% at full sun light (1.0 sun), a better η of 10.00% at medium light (0.5 sun), and the best η of 10.39% at dim light (0.1 sun). In a cobalt-based electrolyte, the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC gave an η of 10.32% at 1.0 sun, the best η of 10.47% at 0.5 sun, and an impressive η of 10.20% at 0.1 sun. As shown in Fig. 2b and S6,† the best electrode of the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC results in its DSSC having the better efficiencies not only in the iodide-based electrolyte (9.47% at 1.0 sun) but also in the cobalt-based (10.32% at 1.0 sun) electrolyte, compared to the cell efficiencies of the DSSCs with the Pt/CC (7.75% and 8.47% in the iodide-based and cobalt-based electrolytes, respectively). It may be concluded that the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC is a promising electro-catalytic material to replace the expensive platinum in a DSSC.

3.7. Durability test
To evaluate the durability of our newly synthesized electrode of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, we performed electrochemical and photovoltaic measurements. First of all, a long-term cyclic voltammetry analysis using the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC as the working electrode was performed at a continuous electrochemical scan for 300 cycles in the iodide-based and cobalt-based electrolytes (Fig. 6a). After scanning for 300 cycles, the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode shows the unfailing anodic and cathodic peak heights in both of the iodide-based and cobalt-based electrolytes. It is no doubt that the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical cycling stability.
 Fig. 6  (a) Long-term cyclic voltammograms of the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode, measured at the continuous 300 cycles of scanning in the iodide-based (pink lines) or cobalt-based (green lines) electrolyte. (b) Photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSSC with the counter electrodes of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC before and after being bent 500 times, measured in the iodide-based (pink lines) or cobalt-based (green lines) electrolyte at 100 mW cm−2. (c) The at-rest long-term durability data of the DSSC with the counter electrodes of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC, measured in another iodide-based electrolyte using binary ionic liquids as the solvent at 100 mW cm−2. 
Intending to further confirm the mechanical durability of the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode, the flexible counter electrode of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC was bent, when a long-term cyclic voltammetry was executed in the iodide-based electrolyte (Fig. S7†). After scanning for 300 cycles, the good cycling stability of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC confirms its mechanical durability. Besides, the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC was manually bent 500 times and then used to assemble the iodide-based and cobalt-based DSSCs (Fig. 6b). As summarized in Table S2,† the bent TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC results in its DSSCs having comparable cell performances to those of the DSSCs using the un-bent TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode. This clearly demonstrates the good mechanical durability of the flexible TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode.
Finally, the long-term durability measurement of the DSSC with the flexible TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC counter electrode was performed in another iodide-based electrolyte using binary ionic liquids as the solvent (see details in ESI†); thus the efficiency loss caused by the vaporization of liquid solvent could be minimized.36 Due to the instability of the cobalt redox species,71 the long-term durability test of the cobalt-based DSSC was very hard to be performed at this stage. According to the reported sealing process,57 the photoanode coated on the FTO substrate was coupled with the flexible and soft TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode using the epoxy glue. To prevent the leakage of the electrolyte, a soda-lime glass was used to cover the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode, as shown in the inset photo in Fig. 6c. The at-rest long-term durability data (Fig. 6c) of this DSSC are based on the cell efficiency measured for 50 days. In Fig. 6c, the DSSC with the counter electrode of TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC shows good long-term durability, verifying that the composite TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC is a stable electro-catalytic counter electrode for DSSCs.
4. Conclusions
The newly synthesized electrode of titanium oxide-selenide wrapped carbon cloth (TiO1.1Se0.9/CC) successfully provides a hierarchical electron transfer route for I3− reduction in a DSSC. Each carbon fiber in the CC serves as a conducting core for transporting the main stream of electrons through its 1D direction, and the wrapped thin film of TiO1.1Se0.9 (with many nanospheres and 1D nanorods) provides secondary channels of electrons for executing the reduction of I3−. Compared to the cells with the Pt/CC (7.75%) and TiO2/CC (4.90%) electrodes, the highest power conversion efficiency of the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC (9.47%) is experimentally verified to be due to several advantages of TiO1.1Se0.9: (i) large active sites, (ii) excellent intrinsic electro-catalytic ability, (iii) fast charge transfer capability, (iv) good conductivity, and (v) good adhesion to the CC substrate. In a cobalt-based electrolyte, the DSSC with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC even reached a higher η of 10.32%, which is much higher than the cell with the Pt/CC (8.47%). Thus, it's clear that the low-cost and highly efficient TiO1.1Se0.9 material exhibited promising potential to replace Pt not only in the iodide-based electrolyte, but also in the cobalt-based electrolyte. Under dim light conditions, the pertinent DSSC exhibited 10.39% in the iodide-based electrolyte at 0.1 sun and 10.47% in the cobalt-based electrolyte at 0.5 sun. The high efficiencies of the cell with the TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC at low light intensities broaden the horizon of the DSSC applications in indoor electronics. Although the DSSC in this work is not flexible due to the technical difficulty in fabricating a flexible photoanode with high efficiency, low cost, easy-to- fabricate, and a TCO-free TiO1.1Se0.9-3/CC electrode still benefits the future development of DSSCs for various applications in wearable, foldable, or mobile electrochemical devices.
