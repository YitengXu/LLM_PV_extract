    , Accepted 19th June 2015First published on 19th June 2015AbstractImpurity doping is a simple and efficient modification method to improve the photocatalytic performance of wide band gap photocatalysts. However, some basic and important issues about the mechanism of impurity doping modification still need to be further confirmed and explained. In the present work, Pr-doped TiO2 with a mono-phase crystal structure was prepared by a sol–gel method. Then, the crystal structure, binding information, optical absorption, and photocatalytic activity were systematically investigated. The experimental results show that Pr doping could significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, and the effects of modification on rutile TiO2 are more obvious than for anatase TiO2. In order to understand the underlying mechanism, density functional theory was utilized to calculate the crystal structure and electronic structure of pure and Pr-doped TiO2. The differences in electronic structure between anatase and rutile phases lead to the above photocatalytic performance. The experimental measurements and theoretical calculations mutually support each other in the present work. Two points are confirmed: the position of the band edge determines the redox activity of the photocatalyst, and the shallow energy bands induced by impurity doping could improve the photocatalytic performance.
1. Introduction
Photocatalysis technology is attracting more and more attention, because it could convert solar energy into chemical energy to solve the issues of energy shortage and environmental pollution: producing hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting, converting CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels or decomposing organic pollutants by photocatalytic reactions.1–4 However, the development of photocatalysis technology suffers from a narrow spectral response range for sunlight or a low quantum conversion efficiency for solar energy. Nowadays, research is concentrating on the following two aspects: the development of novel photocatalysts or photocatalytic systems (for example, 2D layered compounds, metal-free polymeric photocatalysts),5,6 and the modification of traditional photocatalysts (such as TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, etc.). TiO2-based photocatalysts are still receiving considerable attention, due to their various advantages: multi-functionality, non-toxicity, long-term stability, and low-cost.7–10 Moreover, TiO2 acts as the typical representative material and the prototype for photocatalysts. However, as a wide band gap semiconductor (3.2 eV for anatase, 3.0 eV for rutile), it is only activated by UV-light irradiation, energy which only accounts for about 4% of the whole solar energy, because the electron excitation requires incident photon energy which must be larger than the band gap energy.11,12 To obtain a more efficient utilization of solar energy for TiO2-based photocatalysts, researchers have adopted various modification methods (including impurity doping,13–15 cocatalyst loading,16,17 dye-sensitizing,18,19 semiconductor compositing,20–22 and so on), to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 under visible-light irradiation.
Among these modification methods, impurity doping is easily carried out, and its modification effects are obvious, attracting extensive attention. First, impurity doping could form impurity states in the forbidden band, which can not only make the electrons excited by visible-light, but also can capture photo-generated electrons or holes, reducing the probability of the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs or prolonging the lifetime of photo-generated carriers.9,23,24 To extend the TiO2 photocatalytic activity in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of impurity states in the forbidden band is very important: the lower energy photon could excite electrons from the valence band to these impurity states, and then another lower energy photon could excite them to the conduction band. By this relay excitation, TiO2 could show photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation. Secondly, impurity doping could change the local crystal structure to produce local crystal distortion and the electrons’ distribution. Thus, the centers of positive charges and negative charges no longer coincide, which can produce the local internal electric field. As the directions of the electric force on electrons and holes are opposite, this local internal electric field could further promote the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.8 For impurity doping, the basic requirements are: producing impurity energy states in the band gap, processing higher energy levels than the H2/H2O level, and having impurity energy states sufficiently overlapping with the conduction band or valence band.25 After years of extensive investigation, the impurity doping modification of TiO2 has made considerable progress: transition-metal mono-doping,26,27 non-metal mono-doping,8,28,29 and the co-doping of different impurities,30–32 both in experimental and theoretical investigations. This progress deepens our fundamental understanding of the modification mechanism of impurity doping, and establishes the foundation for the further development of photocatalysis technology.
However, some open questions remain despite the above mentioned research progress: (i) the underlying mechanism of impurity doping modification is not completely clear, especially the relationships with crystal structure and electronic structure; (ii) impurity doping may enable TiO2 to absorb visible-light, but may reduce the redox activity at the same time; (iii) some conclusions in different reports are inconsistent, owing to different synthesis routes or different evaluation criteria. In published reports, Huang et al. prepared Pr-TiO2 photocatalyst samples by a sol–gel method, and found that praseodymium doping could bring about remarkable improvement in the photoactivity under UV-light irradiation. The high activity was believed to produce the lattice distortion and efficiently inhibit the recombination of the electron–hole by Pr3+.33 Wu et al. synthesized Pr + N co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles by a sol–gel method combined with a microwave chemical method, and observed a synergistic effect between Pr and N resulting in remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.34 Because of the unique 4f electron configuration and spectrum properties, rare earth ions are ideal dopants for the modification of the crystal structure, electronic structure, optical properties and surface absorption of TiO2 and form some promising novel photocatalysts.35,36 In the field of photocatalysis, rare earth ion dopants could provide adequate and matched energy states with the host energy band, meaning they have more opportunity to meet the advantages of impurity doping effects. In our previous work, we found that Pr-doping could form impurity energy states below the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2, which meets the basic requirements of impurity doping as mentioned above.36 But this work did not consider the spin–orbital coupling effects that are very important for rare earth elements, and only studied the doping effects in anatase TiO2. Based on the above reasons, we chose praseodymium as a dopant to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, in order to preliminarily solve these open problems. In other words, the initial purpose of this article is to explore in-depth the underlying modification mechanism of praseodymium doping for TiO2 in different crystal structures. In the present work, we first synthesized and characterized Pr-doped TiO2 samples, and then further adopted density functional theory (DFT) with the GGA+U method to calculate and compare the doping effects of Pr in anatase and rutile TiO2. Combining experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the detailed Pr modification mechanism for TiO2 will be discussed, and this work will provide an example for future research into photocatalysis technology.
2. Experimental and computational methods
A. Materials
Tetrabutyl titanate [Ti(OC4H9)4] (98%, Aldrich), praseodymium nitrate [Pr(NO3)3·6(H2O)] (99%, Aldrich), concentrated nitric acid [HNO3] (99%, Aldrich), and anhydrous alcohol [C2H5OH] were all of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water was obtained from a laboratory purification system.
B. Preparation of samples
The Pr-doped TiO2 samples were synthesized by a conventional process, the sol–gel method. Firstly, 5 mL of Ti(OC4H9)4 was added dropwise in 100 mL of anhydrous alcohol, under constant magnetic stirring at room temperature, obtaining yellow transparent solution (denoted solution “A”). Secondly, a mixture of 10 mL of anhydrous alcohol and 1.5 mL deionized water (denoted solution “B”) was slowly added dropwise into solution “A”. Then, the “A + B” mixed solution was hydrolyzed at room temperature, under vigorous magnetic stirring for 2 hours, obtaining a pale yellow transparent sol. During this process, the pH value was maintained at 3 by adjustment with dilute nitric acid. Then, the sol was aged for 4 days at room temperature to prepare a gel, and the derived gel was dried at 80 °C for 24 hours to remove the solvents. Finally, the dry gel was carefully ground into a powder, and annealed at temperatures of 500 °C (for samples with anatase phase) and 950 °C (for samples with rutile phase) in a muffle furnace in air for 3 hours to obtain the desired pure TiO2 samples. The Pr-doped TiO2 samples were synthesized with the same method mentioned above, except for the addition of praseodymium nitrate solution into solution “B”. The doping concentrations were kept at a constant mol fraction (Pr/(Ti + Pr) = 0.5 mol%).
C. Characterization of samples
The structures of the as-prepared samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu-Kα: λ = 1.542 Å, D8 Advance, German), where the diffracted X-ray intensities were recorded as a function of 2θ. The accelerating voltage was 35 kV and the applied current was 25 mA, and the sample was scanned from 10° to 90° (2θ) in steps of 0.02°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250, USA) measurement was carried out to analyze the valence state of compositions. The binding energies of all investigated elements were calibrated against the C1s peak at 284.6 eV for the adventitious carbon. The target power was 280 W and the accelerating voltage was kept at 13.5 kV. The optical properties of absorption were measured by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO4 as the reference standard at room temperature in air.
D. Photocatalytic performance evaluation
A methylene blue (MB) degradation technique was employed for investigating the photocatalytic activity of pure and Pr-doped TiO2 in aqueous solution under simulated sunlight. A common fluorescent lamp (30 W, spectral range: 350–750 nm) was chosen as a solar simulator. In a typical photocatalytic degradation experiment, 50 mL of an aqueous solution of 10 mg L−1 MB solution was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer with 0.20 g of powdered sample in a 100 mL glass beaker. Before irradiation, the suspension was equilibrated in the glass beaker by stirring in the dark for one hour to equilibrate the adsorption of MB onto the surface of the samples. An air cooler and thermostat were connected to the solar simulator to maintain the temperature of suspension at room temperature (∼25 °C). Aliquots (4 mL) were withdrawn from the suspension under simulated sunlight irradiation at regular irradiation intervals of one hour. These aliquots were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 40 minutes to separate the photocatalyst from the mixture. The absorption spectra were recorded using a JH722N UV-Vis spectrophotometer, in which the absorption constant at 664 nm of the MB aqueous solution was measured to determine the MB concentration. The photocatalytic degradation constant of MB in the solution was calculated by the following formula: , where C0 is the initial concentration of MB after one hour stirring in the dark, and C is the concentration of MB after a time t.
E. DFT calculations
In the present work, all of the calculations were carried out using periodic density functional theory package Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code.37 The core electrons (Ti: [Ar], O: [He], Pr: [Xe]) were treated with an ultrasoft pseudopotential. The exchange–correlation effects of valence electrons (Ti: 3d24s26p3, O: 2s22p4, Pr: 4f35d06s2) were described by the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof solid (PBEsol) generalized gradient approximation (GGA).38 In order to obtain an accurate electronic structure, the GGA+U method was adopted to overcome the well-known shortcoming of GGA.39 A U value of 4.2 eV was applied to the Ti-d states, Pr-f states, and the O-p states. Using these values, accurate band gaps could be obtained that could be compared with experimental measurements, as well as keeping the main features of the electronic structure obtained by standard DFT calculations. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme K-point grid sampling was set as 4 × 4 × 2 for the irreducible Brillouin zone. A 60 × 60 × 80 mesh was used for fast Fourier transformation. An energy cutoff of 380 eV was used for expanding the Kohn–Sham wave functions. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) minimization algorithm was chosen.40 Its convergence criteria were set as follows: the force on the atoms was less than 0.03 eV Å−1, the stress on the atoms was less than 0.05 GPa, the atomic displacement was less than 1 × 10−3 Å, and the energy change per atom was lower than 1 × 10−5 eV. A 3 × 3 × 2 supercell (for the anatase phase) and 2 × 2 × 3 supercell (for the rutile phase) were used for constructing the Pr-doped TiO2 models, in which a Ti atom in the supercells was replaced by a Pr atom. In the supercells, the total number of atoms reached 108 (for the anatase phase) or 72 (for the rutile phase).
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Crystal structure of pure and Pr-doped TiO2

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pure and Pr-doped TiO2 samples. All the peaks could be exclusively indexed on the basis of the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272, space group I41/amd) or rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1276, space group P42/mnm), respectively. This result indicates that all samples exhibited well crystallized mono-phases (anatase or rutile phase). No other peaks corresponding to Pr metal or related compounds were observed in the Pr-doped TiO2. As shown in Fig. 1, the position of the main diffraction peaks show no appreciable variation or shifting, suggesting that the lattice distortion induced by Pr doping is very slight. In fact, the stability of the RE-doped TiO2 depended on the doping level, and the doping level is very small (0.5 mol%) in the present work. So, the Pr-doped TiO2 was stable in the annealing temperature range. Furthermore, the main diffraction peaks of Pr-doped anatase TiO2 weakened and broadened compared with the corresponding pure anatase TiO2; while the main diffraction peaks of the Pr-doped rutile TiO2 kept the sharp and strong features exhibited by pure rutile TiO2. According to Scherrer equation, Pr doping may reduce the crystallinity of anatase TiO2, and has no obvious influence on the crystallinity of rutile TiO2, under the present preparation conditions. The particle size of the samples is another important factor to determine photocatalytic performance, especially at the nano-scale. So, in the present work, we tried our best to keep the particle size at a comparable scale as much as possible. As shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† the average particle size of the samples is listed as follows: 45.31 ± 5.41 nm for pure anatase TiO2; 68.43 ± 7.10 nm for Pr-doped anatase TiO2; 67.38 ± 2.24 nm for pure rutile TiO2; 56.41 ± 3.65 nm for Pr-doped rutile TiO2. These comparable particle sizes imply that the particle size effect could be ignored in the present work.
 Fig. 1  The XRD patterns of pure TiO2 and Pr-doped TiO2. 
XPS measurements of the Pr-doped TiO2 were performed to obtain information on the oxidation state of the Pr impurities in the TiO2 host lattice. The survey and high-resolution XPS spectra of the 0.5 mol% Pr-doped TiO2 samples are illustrated in Fig. 2, which are compared with pure TiO2. The four survey spectra have similar curves, revealing that there is not any change in the chemical valence of Pr ions both in the anatase and rutile phases (Fig. 2(a)). Such conclusion can also be supported by the high-resolution spectra of Ti-2p as well as Pr-3d in Fig. 2(b) and (c). The binding energy of Pr-3d5/2 and Pr-3d3/2 appeared at ∼932 and ∼952 eV corresponding to the energy of the Pr3+ photoelectrons; the Ti-2p spectral peaks at ∼460 and ∼465 eV were assigned to the binding energies of Ti-2p3/2 and Ti-2p1/2, respectively, for the Ti4+ ions.41–43 Except for the slight displacements, the position and shape of the Ti-2p peaks in Pr-doped TiO2 are similar to the corresponding peaks in pure TiO2, indicating that Pr doping does not change the chemical valence states of Ti. On the other hand, the differences in the Pr-3d peaks between the anatase and rutile phases suggest that the Pr3+ cations have different local chemical environments at different crystal phases (anatase or rutile).

3.2 Optical properties and photocatalytic performance of pure and Pr-doped TiO2
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the pure and Pr-doped TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 3. For the pure TiO2 samples, the strong absorption band at low wavelengths near ∼400 nm for pure anatase TiO2, or ∼420 nm for rutile pure TiO2, indicating the presence of Ti species as tetrahedral Ti(IV). The fundamental absorption edge of pure and Pr-doped anatase TiO2 samples are located at about 390 nm; while those of rutile and Pr-doped TiO2 samples are located at 410 nm. The absorption edge slightly extends to shorter wavelengths for Pr-doped TiO2 samples, and an absorption tail in the visible-light region over 440–520 nm and strong absorption band in the UV-light region is clearly observed. It is well known that the impurity doping could impact the electronic structure of the host, namely the band gap energy. For Pr-doped TiO2 samples both with anatase and rutile phases, their fundamental absorption edges are slightly blue-shifted. However, the blue-shifts are too slight, and coincide with those of pure TiO2. These observations indicate that Pr doping could not obviously change the band gaps of TiO2 both with anatase and rutile phases. In addition, in the range of 440–520 nm and 570–620 nm, there are two absorption bands that are only observed in Pr-doped TiO2 samples, and they could be assigned to the electron transitions of 3H4 → 3P2 (455 nm), 1I6 (466 nm), 3P1 (479.5 nm), 3P0 (496 nm), and 1D2 (603.5 nm) of Pr3+ by visible-light excitation. If the Pr doping content increases, these absorption peaks will be more obvious, as shown in Fig. S2 in ESI.† However, for the Pr doping with 0.5% content, these absorption peaks are too weak to impact the optical properties of TiO2. Thus, it may be considered that the improvement in photocatalytic performance caused by variation of optical absorption can be neglected.

The methylene blue (MB) photocatalytic degradation by pure and Pr-doped TiO2 under simulated sunlight irradiation is presented in Fig. 4. After one hour of continuous stirring under dark conditions, MB reached an equilibrium between adsorption and desorption at the samples' surfaces. The concentration of MB decreased from 10 mg L−1 to ∼8.25–8.38 mg L−1, meaning that all the samples have a similar absorption capacity for MB and that size or pore effects could be ignored in the present work. After five hours photocatalytic degradation, the concentration of MB gradually decreased to: 3.58 mg L−1 with pure anatase TiO2, 2.83 mg L−1 with Pr-doped anatase TiO2, 6.45 mg L−1 with pure rutile TiO2, and 5.56 mg L−1 with Pr-doped rutile TiO2, respectively. Compared with the initial concentration at the moment the light was turned on, the corresponding photocatalytic degradation degree of these samples is 57.01%, 65.66%, 23.03%, and 33.54%, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 is higher than that of rutile TiO2, and Pr doping could obviously improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under simulated sunlight irradiation.
 Fig. 4  The MB concentrations and photocatalytic degradation rate as a function of time in pure TiO2 and Pr-doped TiO2. 
In order to further analyze the reaction kinetics, the photocatalytic degradation data were fitted, and the fitting equations and curves are presented in Fig. 4. The results showed that the process of photocatalytic degradation of MB on TiO2 follows a first order reaction kinetics model, and the apparent first order activation constant is linear to reaction time: (1) (2)where C′ and D′ represent the pre-exponential factor, k represents the chemical reaction rate constant, and CL and DL represent the limiting concentration or limiting degradation rate. CL and DL indicate the final limitation when the time tends to infinity. As the fitting curves show, the reaction rate constant and limiting concentration (or limiting degradation rate) of anatase TiO2 are higher than those of rutile TiO2, and Pr doping could enhance these reaction parameters. On the other hand, there are still differences between anatase and rutile cases. By Pr doping, the reaction rate constant of anatase TiO2 increased by 0.014 h−1, and the limiting degradation rate increased by 9.07%; while the reaction rate constant for rutile TiO2 increased by 0.03 h−1, and the limiting degradation rate increased by 12.17%. These results suggest that the modification effects of Pr doping are more obvious for rutile TiO2 than for anatase TiO2.
3.3 Electronic structures of pure and Pr-doped TiO2
To better understand the above experimental results for Pr-doped TiO2 photocatalysts, we further adopted the DFT method to investigate the underlying mechanism. In the case of pure anatase TiO2, the calculated lattice parameters are listed as follows: a = b = 3.7739 Å, c = 9.5822 Å. Additionally, in the case of pure rutile TiO2, the calculated lattice parameters are listed as follows: a = b = 4.5958 Å, c = 2.9457 Å. These calculated lattice parameters are consistent with the experimental measurements,44 suggesting that the calculation method adopted in the previous work is reliable. Given the different valence states and ionic radius, Pr doping will distort the TiO2 crystal lattice. As shown in Table 1, the Pr–O bond length is larger than the Ti–O bond length, and thus the volume of the crystal cell of Pr-doped TiO2 slightly increases. In the case of Pr-doped anatase TiO2, the calculated lattice parameters are listed as follows: a = b = 3.7800 Å, c = 9.6392 Å. Additionally, in the case of Pr-doped rutile TiO2, the calculated lattice parameters are listed as follows: a = b = 4.6616 Å, c = 2.9725 Å. Compared with the lattice parameters of pure TiO2, we found that the lattice distortion caused by Pr ions doping is very slight. In the XRD measurements (as shown in Fig. 1), the main patterns did not exhibit significant offset, which suggest the experimental measurements and theoretical calculations support each other in the present work.

To examine the relative difficulty for Pr impurities to incorporate into different host lattice sites, the impurity formation energies (Ef) are herein discussed. The formation energy was calculated according to the formula defined by Van de Walle et al.45 The smaller Ef value means that the corresponding doping process could be more easily carried out. In the present work, we found that the Ef value of Pr-doped anatase TiO2 is smaller than that of Pr-doped rutile TiO2, which indicates that Pr doping into the anatase phase is easier than in the rutile phase. In the experimental section, the annealing temperature for the Pr-doped anatase TiO2 sample is smaller than that of the Pr-doped rutile TiO2 sample, which could partly be explained by this calculated result. Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, the atomic or bond populations (namely charge distributions) are decreased by Pr doping, except for the bond population of longer Ti–O bonds. The changes of bond length, crystal volume, and atomic or bond populations will lead to local lattice deformation, resulting in formation of a built-in inner local electric field. This is an efficient effect to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.
The calculated band structures are illustrated in Fig. 5, with the corresponding density of states. The band gap energy (between the valence band maximum, VBM, and the conduction band minimum, CBM) of pure anatase and rutile TiO2 are 3.196 and 2.996 eV, respectively, which are in agreement with experimental measurements. Additionally, the band gap energy of Pr-doped anatase and rutile TiO2 are 3.130 and 2.991 eV, respectively. Comparing these results, we found that Pr ion doping could slightly reduce the band gap of TiO2. However, these differences are too small to distinguish. These calculated results confirmed the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy observations shown in Fig. 3. In the case of Pr-doped anatase TiO2, there are two impurity energy levels above the valence band, 0.358 eV from the VBM (with a bandwidth of 0.136 eV); while in the case of Pr-doped rutile TiO2, there is an impurity energy level above the valence band, 0.308 eV from the VBM (with a bandwidth of 0.092 eV), at the same time, there is an another impurity energy level below the conduction band, 0.266 eV from the CBM (with a bandwidth of 0.037 eV). The information about the bonding mechanism could be provided by the local partial density of states. For both crystal phases (anatase and rutile), the top of the valence band is mainly dominated by the characteristics of O-2p non-bonding states, while the bottom of the conduction band is mainly dominated by the characteristics of Ti-3d non-bonding states. Importantly, the Pr-4f states (spin-up states) hybridized with the O-2p states (spin-up states), form the impurity energy levels above the valence band; while the impurity energy level below the conduction band is predominately composed of the Pr-4f states (spin-up states) in the case of Pr-doped rutile TiO2. Other Pr-related impurity energy levels are mainly located in the energy range of −5 to 0 eV and contribute to the formation of the valence band, and are located in the energy range of 3–5 eV and contribute the formation of the bottom of conduction band.

Combining the experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we can better understand the above observations. First, the ability of a photocatalyst to undergo photo-generated electron transfer to adsorbed species on its surface is governed by the band energy position of the semiconductor and the redox potentials of the adsorbate. The relevant potential level of the acceptor is thermodynamically required to be below (more positive than) the conduction band potential of photocatalyst. The potential level of the donor needs to be above (more negative than) the valence band position of photocatalyst.46 For example, for photocatalytic water splitting, a suitable photocatalyst material requires that its CBM energy is higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 and its VBM energy is lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O, in addition to its band gap exceeding the incident photon energy. This condition guarantees that photo-generated electrons can take part in the reduction reaction, and that photo-generated holes can take part in the oxidation reaction.47 So, we calculated the band edge position of TiO2 according to the methods defined in ref. 48–51, as shown in Fig. 6. The approximate CBM potential of anatase TiO2 is −0.303 eV with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. Subsequently the approximate VBM potential of anatase TiO2 is determined as 2.893 eV based on its calculated band gap, which is very consistent with the band energy position of anatase TiO2 in ref. 46. For rutile TiO2, the VBM potential is up-shifted by about 0.668 eV, while the CBM potential is up-shifted by about 0.468 eV, compared with anatase TiO2. This result indicates that the oxidation ability of photo-generated holes in anatase TiO2 is higher than that in rutile TiO2. By Pr doping, the VBM potential is slightly up-shifted by about 0.086 eV, while the CBM potential is slightly up-shifted by about 0.020 eV, compared with pure anatase TiO2; and the VBM potential is slightly up-shifted by about 0.107 eV, while the CBM potential is slightly up-shifted by about 0.102 eV, compared with pure rutile TiO2. This result suggests that Pr doping has no obvious impact on the redox ability of TiO2, so the photocatalytic ability of Pr-doped anatase TiO2 is still higher than that of Pr-doped rutile TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4. Second, for the doping modification method, the shallow impurity energy band could act as the capture center for photo-generated carriers.25 In both cases of anatase and rutile TiO2, Pr doping induces an impurity energy band above the top of the VB, which can capture the photo-generated holes resulting in suppression of the recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is enhanced by Pr doping, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, there is an another impurity energy band below the bottom of the CB in the case of Pr-doped rutile TiO2, which can capture the photo-generated electrons, resulting in further suppression of the recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. This result could explain why the modification effect of Pr is more obvious for rutile TiO2 than that for anatase TiO2.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of Pr-doped TiO2 samples with anatase and rutile phases were synthesized by a sol–gel method and were systematically characterized. Pr doping does not obviously change the crystal structure and optical absorption of TiO2, but does enhance the photocatalytic activity in the present work. For anatase TiO2, Pr doping induces a shallow acceptor energy band above the top of the valence band; while for rutile TiO2, Pr doping induces a shallow acceptor energy band above the top of the valence band and a shallow donor energy band below the bottom of conduction band. These shallow energy bands could act as the capture center for photo-generated carriers, resulting in suppression of the recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, in the case of Pr-doped rutile TiO2, Pr doping induces not only a shallow acceptor energy band but also a donor energy band; thus, its modification impact for photocatalytic activity is more obvious than that of Pr-doped anatase TiO2. In the present work, the experimental observations were well confirmed and explained by the theoretical calculations. These observations clarify some unclear issues, and provide guidance for research and applications of ion doping to improve the photocatalytic performance in the future.
