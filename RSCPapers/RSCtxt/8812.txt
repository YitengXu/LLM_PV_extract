    , Accepted 8th September 2011First published on 6th October 2011AbstractThe electron donor of a D-π-A dye is known for its capability to tune both the electronic trait and packing mode of dye molecules chemisorbed on titania nanocrystals of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), bringing on the opportunity to impact cell performance by modulating the physicochemical characteristics at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface. In this paper, we scrutinize the influences of arylamine electron donors on the optoelectronic features of thin-film DSCs employing a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte, by use of four cyclopentadithiophene dyes (C218, C244, C245 and C246) with the respective dihexyloxy-, diphenothiazinyl- or di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted triphenylamine and N-hexyl-carbazole electron donors. Amongst these electron donors, dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine is found to present the strongest electron-donating capacity, endowing the corresponding C218 dye with evidently red-shifted light absorption in comparison with the other three congeners. Transient absorption measurements show that all DSCs exhibit expeditious dye regeneration, guaranteeing efficient long-distance charge separation at the titania/dye/redox couple interface. Furthermore, it is worthwhile noting that the C218 dye prompts the highest open-circuit photovoltage amongst these chromophores, which is primarily attributed to the positive effect of slow cobalt(III) interception of titania electrons, highlighting the superiority of applying dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine as the electron donor for a cyclopentadithiophene dye.

Broader context
Amongst various strategies to improve the capacity of dye-sensitized solar cells to convert sunlight to electrical power, successful molecular engineering of some photosensitizers has remarkably contributed to the performance progress of this photovoltaic technology. Generally, an elaborately engineered photosensitizer is supposed to meet two requirements: (i) enhancing the overlap between the spectral coverage of dye molecules and the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum through energy level engineering and (ii) concomitantly achieving high open-circuit photovoltage with reduced energy losses. In this context, special care has to be taken to construct photosensitizers featuring desirable electronic and steric properties. Herein, we report the impact of different arylamine electron donors upon the optoelectronic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox couple. Our results show that using the dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine to construct a push-pull cyclopentadithiophene dye confers the corresponding DSC with both a high photocurrent and photovoltage, enlightening the future design of more powerful photosensitizers.

1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells1 are attracting enormous scientific interest for their capability to harness solar light for efficient electricity production with an organic/inorganic nanoheterostructure, the key components of which being superior cost-effectiveness compared to those of the conventional crystalline semiconductor technology. In this photoelectrochemical device, a photosensitizer functions as one of the kernel elements for charge photogeneration.2 To date, the combination of some polypyridyl ruthenium3–5 or zinc porphyrin6 complexes or a multiple dye system7 with an iodine-containing redox electrolyte has afforded ≥11% power conversion efficiencies. On the other hand, rational design of organic photosensitizers with proper electronic structures and steric features has very recently led to consecutive efficiency progress of dye-sensitized solar cells with a non-corrosive one-electron redox system based on some cobalt,8iron9 or copper10 complexes, which has valuably opened up new opportunities to achieve further efficiency enhancement of DSCs. Thereby, it is of great significance to understand the dye structure-performance relationship of iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cells.
It is well known that within a typical D-π-A chromophore for DSCs, the electronic and steric traits of the electron donor not only play a pivotal role in determining the molecular energy levels, which intimately correlate with the light harvesting capacity of a photosensitizer and some dynamic processes such as exciton dissociation and dye regeneration, but also affects the physicochemical interactions of multiple components at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface, which also have profound effects on the ultimate power output of a DSC. This recognition in the last decade has translated into massive efforts in designing push-pull organic dyes featuring various electron donors, including triarylamines,11carbazoles,12coumarins,13 indolines14 and heteroanthracenes (e.g.phenothiazine),11e,15etc. With such a wide spectrum of electron donors, there arises an urgent need to systematically clarify the effect of an electron donor variation in dye molecules on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs, and unveil the energetic and kinetic origins laying behind it.
Herein, we employ four cyclopentadithiophene-cyanoacrylic acid dyes (Fig. 1) based on different arylamine electron donors, i.e.dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine (DHO-TPA, C218), diphenothiazinyl-substituted triphenylamine (DPT-TPA, C244), di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted triphenylamine (DTB-TPA, C245) and N-hexyl-carbazole (NHC, C246), to investigate the electron donor influence on photovoltaic performance of DSCs deploying a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte. Our preliminary calculations have shown that apart from the apparently different steric characters, these arylamine electron donors also confer the push-pull chromophores with distinctive molecular orbital alignments. It is expected that these electron donor differences could have a major impact on some important photovoltaic parameters such as photocurrent and photovoltage, which will be further scrutinized via a joint photophysical and electrical analysis.

All other solvents and reagents, unless otherwise stated, were of analytical grade and used as received. 4-Tert-butylpyridine (TBP), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), tris(4-iodophenyl)amine, bis(4-iodophenyl)amine, and 2-cyanoacetic acid, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 6-Bromo-4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde,11i2-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane,169-hexyl-3-iodocarbazole (11)17 and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI)18 were synthesized according to literature methods. The scattering TiO2 paste (WER2-O) was received as a gift from Dyesol.
2.2. Synthesis
The synthesis of the C218 dye has been reported in our previous publication.11i The synthetic route and synthesis of intermediates of C244, C245 and C246, and the synthesis of tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II) di[tetracyanoborate], tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) tri[tetracyanoborate] are detailed in the Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI).† The synthesis of the C244–C246 dyes are described as follows.

General synthesis procedure of dyes. 
To a stirred solution of carbaldehyde (0.50 mmol) and cyanoacetic acid (1.50 mmol) in chloroform (30 mL) was added piperidine (3.50 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed under argon for 12 h and then terminated by acidifying with 2 M hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (30 mL). The crude product was extracted into chloroform, washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removing solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by flash chromatography with chloroform and methanol/chloroform (v/v, 1/10) in turn as the eluent to yield the product.

2.3. Absorption and voltammetric measurements

Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. Transient absorption measurements were performed with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer pumped with a nanosecond wavelength tunable OPOLett-355II laser. The sample was kept at a 45° angle with respect to the excitation beam. The probe light was passed through a bandpass filter (center wavelength: 782 nm), detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer, and the excitation wavelength and fluence were carefully controlled to guarantee that ∼6.9 × 1013photons were absorbed by the testing dye-coated titania film during every laser pulse. Square-wave voltammograms of dye-coated titania films were measured on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation, using a Pt gauze counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) auxiliary electrode.
2.4. 
          Cell fabrication
A 2.3 μm-thick, transparent layer of 22 nm-sized TiO2 particles was first screen-printed on FTO glass and further coated with a 2.7 μm-thick second layer of scattering titania particles to produce a bilayer titania film, which was used later as the negative electrode of a DSC. The preparation procedures of TiO2 nanocrystals and paste for screen-printing were reported in a previous paper.19 The film thickness was monitored with a bench-top Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. After sintering at 500 °C and cooling to 80 °C, a circular titania electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a solution of 150 μM dye dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile/tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1) for 5 h. The dye-coated titania electrode was then rinsed with acetonitrile and dried by air flow, and was further assembled with a thermally platinized FTO positive electrode by a 25 μm-thick Surlyn (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was perfused with an electrolyte with the aid of a vacuum-back-filling system. Our cobalt electrolyte is composed of 0.25 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II) di[tetracyanoborate], 0.05 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) tri[tetracyanoborate], 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile.
2.5. Photovoltaic characterizations
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used to record photocurrent action spectra, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s under full computer control. A white light-emitting-diode was employed to illuminate the testing cell, generating a 1 mA cm−2 background current. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated in The National Institute of Metrology, China. A model LS1000-4S-AM1.5G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. J–V curves were obtained by applying a bias potential to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2602 source meter under full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) is adhered to the DSC photoanode during IPCE and J–V measurements.
2.6. Electrical impedance spectroscopy measurement
Electrical impedance measurements were carried out with an IM6ex electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range of 20 mHz–100 KHz and a potential modulation of 10 mV. A white-light-emitting diode was used to supply an equivalent 1 sun irradiation on the testing cell, onto which a metal mask (aperture area: ∼0.158 cm2) was adhered. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.) in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit. The potential bias V was calibrated through subtracting the IR drop caused by the series resistance from the applied potential bias.
3. Results and discussion
The influence of different arylamine electron donors on the light harvest capacity of a dye molecule was first evaluated by recording the UV-visible electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 2A) of our dyes dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile/tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1), and some spectroscopic parameters were collected in Table 1. Amongst these photosensitizers, our C218 dye with the DHO-TPA electron donor presents the longest maximum absorption wavelength of 517 nm, with a maximum molar absorption coefficient of 58.9 × 103 M−1 cm−1. By comparison, constructing cyclopentadithiophene dyes with DPT-TPA, DTB-TPA and NHC electron donors generally leads to blue-shifted maximum absorption wavelengths but enhanced maximum molar absorption coefficients (Table 1), among which the use of the NHC electron donor confers the C246 dye with the highest molar extinction coefficient of 66.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1.

The optoelectronic performance of our dyes was first evaluated by plotting the incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) against wavelength of the DSC, as shown in Fig. 2B. It can be noticed that the C218 dye presents a ∼50 nm red shift of photocurrent onset wavelength relative to that of the C244 dye, and a ∼30 nm red shift with respect to the C245 and C246 dyes, which is roughly consistent with the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 2C) of dye-coated titania films. Note that the IPCE maxima of these four dye-sensitized solar cells embody no remarkable differences, varying in a scope of 81–86%. However, it is otherwise worth noticing that in contrast to the IPCE maximum plateaus of the photocurrent action spectra of our C218, C244 and C245 cells, the external quantum efficiency of the C246 cell declines from its peak at 470 nm. The IPCE of a DSC can be formulated as IPCE(λ) = Φcs × ηlh(λ) × ηcoll(λ), where Φcs is the wavelength-independent net charge separation efficiency, and the light-harvesting, ηlh(λ), and charge collection, ηcoll(λ), efficiencies collectively dictate the wavelength-dependent feature of a photocurrent action spectrum. Thereby, considering the close-to-unity electronic absorption (Fig. 2C) from 470 to 520 nm of a C246 dye-coated titania film, it can be derived that the use of the C246 photosensitizer has led to an inferior charge collection, which to a certain extent should limit the photocurrent generation.
Nanosecond transient absorption measurements were carried out to shed light on the dye-correlated dual-channel charge transfer dynamics of oxidized dye molecules, i.e. their electron accepting abilities from either titania nanocrystals or the reductive cobalt(II) ions in the electrolyte, and assess its possible contribution to the non-ideal maximal external quantum efficiencies.20–22 Spectroelectrochemical measurements were first performed with a dye-coated titania film by recording the absorption change before/after applying a potential bias to it. It is noticed from Fig. 3 that positive signals arise in the near-infrared region for all our dyes, primarily owing to the stronger electronic absorption of oxidized dye molecules than their neutral counterparts within this wavelength coverage. On account of the sensitivity of our photomultiplier tube, a monochromatic 782 nm light was selected as the probe light in the subsequent kinetic measurements.
 Fig. 3  Wavelength-dependent absorption change upon applying a positive potential bias to a 2.3 μm-thick, dye-coated titania film immersed in EMITFSI. 
A control cell was first fabricated with a 10 μm-thick, dye-coated titania film in conjunction with an inert electrolyte composed of 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile, the absorption decays (traces a–d in Fig. 4) of which could be ascribed to the charge recombination between oxidized dye molecules and photoinjected electrons in titania. Furthermore, constructing DSCs with the realistic cobalt electrolyte brought forth noticeably accelerated absorption decays (traces e–h in Fig. 4), indicative of rapid electron transfer from cobalt(II) ions to oxidized C218 and C244–C246 dye molecules. To gain a relatively quantitative comparison of these dye-correlated charge transfer dynamics, the absorption traces were fitted to a stretched exponential function ΔA ∝ Aexp(−(t/τ)α), where the obtained characteristic stretched exponential lifetime τ and stretched exponent α were further used to calculate the mean reaction times of charge recombination (<τ>rec) and dye regeneration (<τ>rege) through 〈τ〉 = (τ/α)Γ(1/α), where Γ(x) is the gamma function.22,23 As summarized in Table 1, all our dyes exhibit millisecond <τ>rec values, suggesting slow interception of titania electrons by oxidized dye molecules.
 Fig. 4  Kinetic absorption traces of 10 μm-thick, dye-coated titania films in contact with the inert (a–d) and realistic (e–h) electrolytes. Probe wavelength: 782 nm. Laser pulse fluence and excitation wavelength: a, 44 μJ cm−2 at 658 nm; b, 47 μJ cm−2 at 621 nm; c, 46 μJ cm−2 at 637 nm; d, 45 μJ cm−2 at 635 nm; e, 43 μJ cm−2 at 666 nm; f, 46 μJ cm−2 at 629 nm; g, 45 μJ cm−2 at 642 nm; h, 45 μJ cm−2 at 643 nm. Smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 800 laser shots. 
On the other hand, we find that in contrast to some literature reports where accelerated dye regeneration occurred with a photosensitizer possessing a more positive ground-state redox potential VD+/D,24 no apparent correlation is noticed between the dye regeneration kinetics (<τ>rege ranging from 4.5 to 19.3 μs) and the VD+/D values (positively shifting from 0.28 V to 0.43 V vs. Fc+/Fc, Fig. S1 in ESI†) of our dyes, as shown in Table 1. According to the Marcus electron transfer theory,2,25 the kinetics of dye regeneration could be influenced by (i) the reaction free energy ΔG which thermodynamically drives the electron transfer process, (ii) the electron coupling term HDA of the electron donor and acceptor states and (iii) the reorganization energy λ which largely depends on the polarity of the surrounding solvent as well as the electronic/steric characters of a dye molecule. On the basis of these analyses, we may derive that the different electronic and steric traits of these arylamine electron donors have probably affected the distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and/or the spatial orientation26 of dye molecules grafted on titania nanocrystals, which may complicate the influence of HDA and λ on the electron transfer process involving cobalt(II) ions and oxidized dye molecules, leading to the as-presented dye-dependent dye regeneration kinetics. Further quantum calculation study is needed to address this issue. Overall, albeit the dye-correlated dual-channel charge transfer kinetics, the kinetic branch ratio of <τ>rec to <τ>rege exceeds 130 for all the four dyes, ensuring efficient long-distance charge separation upon electron injection at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface.

Fig. 5 presents the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of our iodine-free DSCs measured at the simulated AM1.5G conditions, and the photovoltaic parameters were collected in Table 2. Being consistent with the integrals of IPCEs over the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum, the C218 dye yields the highest short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) amongst these four photosensitizers. With an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.95 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74, a C218 cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.3% upon the employment of our cobalt electrolyte. Moreover, it is also noticed that the cellVoc consecutively decreases from C244 to C246, being 0.95, 0.93 and 0.87 V, respectively. Note that all C244–C246 cells present lower η values than their C218 counterpart, primarily owing to relatively low photocurrents. Our photovoltaic characterization evidently demonstrates the superiority of dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine over the other three electron donors when applied in cyclopentadithiophene-cyanoacrylic acid organic dyes.

The validity of our data is further confirmed by comparing the overlap integral of the measured IPCE spectrum with the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum and the experimental Jsc, showing a less than 5% error. Also note that our cells have a liner dependence of photocurrent on light intensity.

As commonly understood, the Voc of a DSC intrinsically represents the difference between Fermi-levels of titania electrons (EF,n) and holes of electrolyte (EF,redox), i.e. Voc = (EF,n − EF,redox)/e, where e is the elementary charge, and EF,n is associated with the titania conduction band edge Ec and free electron density n in the semiconductor film:27 (1)
It is important to note that the electron density of an open-circuited DSC is kinetically balanced by the flux of charge photogeneration and that of charge recombination,28 the latter of which being mainly caused by electron transfer from titania nanocrystals to cobalt(III) ions in electrolyte, while the recombination flux of titania electrons/oxidized dye molecules can be neglected in view of the highly efficient charge separation as revealed with our transient absorption measurements.
Although there is no distinction of the Voc values of our C218 and C244 cells, it is also valuable to unveil the dye structure-correlated energetics and charge recombination kinetics at the titania/electrolyte interface, which can be influenced by the different electronic/steric properties of DHO-TPA and DPT-TPA groups. In this regard, we first analyze the chemical capacitance29Cμ (Fig. S2A in ESI†) of a dye-coated mesoscopic titania film, which is modeled from impedance spectroscopies recorded under an equivalent 1 sun irradiation, to derive the conduction band edge (Table 2) of a dye-coated titania film (see ESI for derivation details†). It is noticed that although the identical Voc values of our C218 and C244 cells, a C218 dye-coated titania film presents a 0.09 eV lower Ec relative to that of C244. By referring to eqn (1), it can be anticipated that the negative effect of a lower Ec on Voc of the C218 cell must be compensated for by the positive effect of a much larger n value. Furthermore, in view of the slight influence of dye-dependent photocurrent generation on cell photovoltage (Fig. S3A in ESI†), we can actually conclude that the larger n of a C218 cell is primarily contributed by a slow charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface.
Thereby, we further detail the kinetics of charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface by analyzing the charge transfer resistance Rct (Fig. S2B in ESI†), which is also modeled from the impedance spectroscopies. With the obtained reaction order β and apparent reaction rate constant k0 of titania electrons (see ESI for derivation details†), the dependence of charge recombination rate (Un) on n is determined through the β-recombination model:30 Un = k0nβ(2)
Note that at the open-circuit condition, the flux of photocurrent generation is compromised by that of charge recombination, i.e. Jsc ≈ edUn, where d of 2.3 μm is the thickness of the transparent layer of a bilayer titania film.
With eqn (2), we can virtually illustrate the relationship between the free electron density and flux of photocurrent generation of an open-circuit DSC, as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Simulated plots of free electron density against flux of photocurrent generation. 
At a given flux of photocurrent generation, the C218 cell possesses evidently more charge than the C244 counterpart, benefiting from its relatively slow interfacial charge recombination kinetics. Furthermore, from Fig. 6 we could actually estimate the n values of the C218 and C244 cells at their respective Jph (taken as Jsc) to be 4.8 × 1015 and 1.9 × 1014 cm−3. Using eqn (1) it is calculated that the higher n level in the C218 cell tends to introduce a ∼0.08 eV higher EF,n with respect to the case with C244, which roughly counteracts the aforementioned 0.09 eV lower Ec level. It is valuable to note that this result not only explains the physical origins of the identical Voc values of our C218 and C244 cells, but otherwise authenticates our impedance measurements performed at an equivalent 1 sun irradiation.
Moreover, using the same protocol to analyze Cμ and Rct of DSCs based on C244, C245 and C246 dyes, it is found that with respect to the C244 cell, the C245 and C246 counterparts display 0.06 and 0.17 eV downward Ec displacements (Table 2), respectively, in contrast to the 0.02 and 0.08 eV downward EF,n shifts. On account of the negligible Voc difference induced by the dye-correlated fluxes of charge photogeneration (Fig. S3B in ESI†), it is thereby deduced that the recombination kinetics should gradually decelerate as C244 > C245 > C246, which is supposed to result in increasing n values. This analysis is further proved by Fig. 6, where an augmentation of n is indeed observed from C244 to C246. Note that the observed Voc decrease from C244 to C246 cells generally stem from the dye-correlated Ec variations, which overwhelm the positive effect of suppressed interfacial charge recombination on Voc.
With the above clarification of dye-correlated energetics and charge transfer kinetics, we further visualize the energetic diagram (Fig. 7) of a dye-coated titania film sinking in our cobalt electrolyte. It can be intuitionistically seen that the Ec level stepwise decrease shifts from C244 to C246, which probably provides a thermodynamic understanding of the gradually decelerated titania/electrolyte interface charge recombination kinetics. On the other hand, noting that the titania conduction band edge can be regarded as the highest energy level that the electron Fermi level may reach, we find that the energy loss Ec − EF,n decreases from C244 to C246, which agrees well with the increasing n values. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that in comparison to the cases of our C244–C246 dyes, the employment of the most-efficient C218 dye has evoked both a moderate titania conduction band edge and a relatively small energy loss amount due to slow titania/electrolyte interface charge recombination, otherwise suggesting that an exclusive pursuit of high conduction band edge may not be a rational strategy for performance optimization; instead, an integrated consideration of tuning interface energetics and charge recombination kinetics could probably open up an avenue to enhance the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency.

4. Conclusions
We have investigated the influences of different arylamine electron donors upon the optoelectronic features of dye-sensitized solar cells based on four cyclopentadithiophene-cyanoacrylic acid dyes, C218, C244, C245 and C246, which are characteristic of the respective dihexyloxy-, diphenothiazinyl-, di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted triphenylamine and N-hexyl-carbazole electron donors. It is found that cyclopentadithiophene dyes with these electron donors generally exhibit highly efficient dye regeneration, despite the noticeably different ground-state redox potentials of dye molecules. Furthermore, impedance study of these cells discloses that using dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine as the electron donor in a cyclopentadithiophene dye desirably slows down titania/electrolyte interface charge recombination kinetics, contributing to a high open-circuit photovoltage. Our work should enlighten the future design of push-pull photosensitizers for more efficient iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cells.

Broader context
Amongst various strategies to improve the capacity of dye-sensitized solar cells to convert sunlight to electrical power, successful molecular engineering of some photosensitizers has remarkably contributed to the performance progress of this photovoltaic technology. Generally, an elaborately engineered photosensitizer is supposed to meet two requirements: (i) enhancing the overlap between the spectral coverage of dye molecules and the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum through energy level engineering and (ii) concomitantly achieving high open-circuit photovoltage with reduced energy losses. In this context, special care has to be taken to construct photosensitizers featuring desirable electronic and steric properties. Herein, we report the impact of different arylamine electron donors upon the optoelectronic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox couple. Our results show that using the dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine to construct a push-pull cyclopentadithiophene dye confers the corresponding DSC with both a high photocurrent and photovoltage, enlightening the future design of more powerful photosensitizers.
