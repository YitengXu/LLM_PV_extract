    , Accepted 2nd September 2016First published on 2nd September 2016AbstractScalable and continuous roll-to-roll manufacturing is at the heart of the promise of low-cost and high throughput manufacturing of solution-processed photovoltaics. Yet, to date the vast majority of champion organic solar cells reported in the literature rely on spin-coating of the photoactive bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer, with the performance of printed solar cells lagging behind in most instances. Here, we investigate the performance gap between polymer solar cells prepared by spin-coating and blade-coating the BHJ layer for the important class of modern polymers exhibiting no long range crystalline order. We find that thickness parity does not always yield performance parity even when using identical formulations. Significant differences in the drying kinetics between the processes are found to be responsible for BHJ nanomorphology differences. We propose an approach which benchmarks the film drying kinetics and associated BHJ nanomorphology development against those of the champion laboratory devices prepared by spin-coating the BHJ layer by adjusting the process temperature. If the optimization requires the solution concentration to be changed, then it is crucial to maintain the additive-to-solute volume ratio. Emulating the drying kinetics of spin-coating is also shown to help achieve morphological and performance parities. We put this approach to the test and demonstrate printed PTB7:PC71BM polymer solar cells with efficiency of 9% and 6.5% PCEs on glass and flexible PET substrates, respectively. We further demonstrate performance parity for two other popular donor polymer systems exhibiting rigid backbones and absence of a long range crystalline order, achieving a PCE of 9.7%, the highest efficiency reported to date for a blade coated organic solar cell. The rational process transfer illustrated in this study should help the broader and successful adoption of scalable printing methods for these material systems.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a promising thin film photovoltaic technology with single junction power conversion efficiency (PCE) now surpassing 10%.1–3 One of the key benefits of this PV technology is its solution processability which means it can be manufactured using continuous, high throughput roll-to-roll coating techniques.4,5 Despite this promise, spin-coating remains by far the most widely used method for photoactive materials screening, device optimization and for producing champion devices.6 This is not surprising as spin-coating is a simple and rapid method which can easily produce uniform films on small substrates with the desired thickness and nanoscale morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer.7,8 Achieving high efficiency has required a highly empirical optimization of processing conditions and formulations that is very much specific to the spin-coating process and is not easily transferred to printing, making the lab-to-fab push more difficult.9–11 A key characteristic of spin-coating is that the ink-to-film phase transformation occurs rapidly owing to a combination of solution ejection, outflow, including possible preferential outflow of different solute components, and rapid solvent drying.12–14 These result in a quenched BHJ morphology and microstructure which can be addressed with the use of solvent additives and/or post-deposition thermal or solvent vapor annealing treatments.15–19 Changing the BHJ thickness in spin-coating is usually done by changing the spinning speed and/or formulation concentration and/or solvent, all of which can impact the BHJ nanomorphology. By contrast, printing processes such as blade-coating, knife coating, solution shearing and slot-die coating entrain the solution on the substrate, forming a trailing meniscus and the film forms without ejection loss of any solute, or accelerated solvent drying without the use of external drying agents.20–33 BHJ thickness can be easily tuned without altering drying kinetics or the formulation, hence maintaining the BHJ nanomorphology intact. The differences in fluid dynamics and drying kinetics between spin-coating and printing methods can consequently result in a different outcome of the solution-to-solid phase transformation process. This might explain why champion OPV device performance obtained by spin-coating the BHJ formulation does not automatically translate into highly efficient solar cells when moving the same formulation to printing and related methods.4,5,25,26 Another aspect of printing is that the parameters related to solution and the interaction between the solution (ink) and the surface are far more critical than in spin-coating.6
Despite these differences and challenges, there have been reasonably successful reports on printed polymer solar cells. For example, Krebs et al. built up a full printing system which enables in situ studies of wet ink deposition and drying mechanisms.34–37 Blade-coating of the active layer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBM) has achieved PCE of 4%,23,25–28 while blade-coating of POD2T-DTBT:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid (PC71BM) has achieved a PCE of 6.7%.30,38 The photovoltaic performance of the air-processed poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b0]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th):PC71BM devices has also successfully improved to PCE = 8.3% using a post-treatment with alcohol-based solvents after blade-coating.39 However, with the exception of P3HT:PCBM and poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD):PC71BM, none of the more modern printed polymer systems come close to matching the performance of the champion spin-cast BHJ.3,40,41
Significant progress has also been made in the area of printed tandem OPVs with exceptionally high fill factors and respectable PCE values of 7.66% (on glass) and 5.56% (on a flexible substrate).42 Fully printed tandem OPV devices have also been reported,36,43 with PCEs of 5.81% and 4.85% on glass and flexible substrates, respectively.44 Fluid flow was also introduced for controlling phase separation during solution printing using an all-polymer bulk heterojunction solar cell, leading to an improved morphology and PCE reaching 3.2%.45 More work has likely gone on in industrial laboratories over the past 10 years, but there is still a dearth of reports in the scientific literature on highly efficient organic solar cells and even fewer reports on how to bridge the performance gap between spin-cast and printed BHJ layers in terms of replicating the intricate nanomorphology of the BHJ layer crucial to the photovoltaic action of the solar cell.26,36
Here, we demonstrate how performance parity with champion spin-coated solar cells can be achieved by blade-coating the BHJ layer and we put forth a methodology for bridging the performance gap with champion solar cells. PCE up to 9.7% is achieved by blade-coating through careful adjustment of the BHJ layer processing and formulation, the highest efficiency thus far for a scalably printed BHJ layer. To achieve this performance parity with spin-cast BHJs we have investigated in situ the solution thinning behaviors in the different processes and identified the effect of processing parameters and solution formulation on the BHJ thickness as well as on its nanoscale and interfacial BHJ morphologies. The investigation included a combination of in situ optical reflectometry and ellipsometry performed during spin-coating and printing, as well as a comparison between spin-cast and printed BHJ layers using energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) and photoluminescence (PL) quenching. Based on this insight, we have rationally adjusted the processing conditions, the temperature and formulation in order to achieve morphological and – ultimately – performance parities with spin-cast BHJ solar cells. Importantly, we find it crucial to maintain the solute-to-additive volume ratio as this dictates the nanomorphology formation, suggesting that spin-coating can continue to be a suitable screening and pre-optimization method for printing OPVs. Our investigation also indicates that solvent evaporation kinetics, which are different in the contexts of spin-cast and printed solutions, may need to be adjusted to help achieve nanomorphological similarity. The performance parity is achieved for three material systems, namely poly{[4,8-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl-thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-alt-[2-(2′-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-4,6-diyl]} (PBDTTT-CT):PC71BM, poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM, where we show PCE approaching 10%, the highest efficiency reported to date in blade coated organic solar cells. We also demonstrate printed PTB7:PC71BM solar cells with PCE of 6.5% on a flexible PET substrate.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Blade-coating and spin-coating the same formulation
We have fabricated inverted solar cells using PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer in a glass/ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag geometry (Fig. 1a) and have used spin-coating conditions and a formulation previously optimized in our laboratory.46 The active layer with a thickness of 102 ± 3 nm was spin-cast in an inert atmosphere and under ambient air conditions on a room-temperature (25 °C) substrate from a warm solution (60 °C) prepared in chlorobenzene (CB) at a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 and a DIO additive concentration of 3% by volume. The spin-coated cells under both inert and ambient atmospheric conditions show excellent performance with an average PCE of 8.7–8.8% (Fig. 1b), and highest PCE of 9.0%, as summarized in Table 1. The excellent efficiency achieved in air is reassuring and demonstrates that blade-coating can also be carried out in air.

J–V characteristics of a representative champion spin-cast PTB7:PC71BM device are shown in (b and c), along with (b) blade-cast devices prepared at different blade speeds at a fixed angle of attack (45°, with respect to the substrate plane), (c) at different angles of attack at 7 mm s−1 and (d) at different angles of attack at 15 mm s−1. In all cases, the formulation used (25 mg mL−1 of PTB7:PC71BM in CB with 3 v/v% DIO) was the same as the one devised for champion spin-cast solar cells.

As a first step, we have performed blade-coating experiments using the same formulation as developed for spin-cast PTB7:PC71BM solar cells in our lab, exploring a wide range of speeds from 0.5 to 100 mm s−1 at a fixed angle of attack (45°, with respect to the substrate plane) (Fig. 1b) and different angles of attack (30–90°) at two coating speeds, namely 7 mm s−1 (Fig. 1c) and 15 mm s−1 (Fig. 1d). In all cases, the temperatures of the starting solution and substrate were kept identical to those of the spin-coating process. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the different blade-coated devices plotted alongside the champion spin-cast solar cell show that the blade-coated devices approach the performance of spin-cast devices, but do not achieve parity. The resulting device figures of merit and film thickness are summarized in Tables 1, S1,†2 and in Fig. 2.

 Fig. 2  PCE of blade-coated PTB7:PC71BM solar cells with different active layer thicknesses by (a) different coating speeds at a fixed angle of attack (45°) and (b) different angles of attack for coating speeds of 7 mm s−1 and 15 mm s−1, using the same formulation as the champion spin-cast solar cell. 
The inset of Fig. 2a shows the plot of BHJ thickness with respect to the blade-coating speed, ranging in thickness from 18 nm to 430 nm. The increasing thickness with coating speed indicates that the coating is in the Landau–Levich regime.47 The dependence of solar cell performance with film thickness varied through the speed and angle of attack is summarized in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The PCE of blade-coated devices shows a non-monotonic dependence on thickness with the highest PCE reaching 8.3% for a film thickness of 132 nm, still underperforming the champion spin-cast device (PCE: 9.0%) with a nominal thickness of ∼100 nm. We find that increasing the angle of attack at a fixed speed can also help adjust the thickness over a broad range, making this a suitable handle over the thickness and for device optimization. For instance, varying the angle between 30° and 90° at a low speed (7 mm s−1) leads to a three-fold thickness variation from 20 to 70 nm, whereas at 15 mm s−1 the same range of angles leads to a smaller, but still substantial two-fold thickness variation from 75 to 130 nm. The device achieves PCE 8.2% at a film thickness of 130 nm, also underperforming the champion spin-cast device (PCE: 9.0%).
The ability to tune the thickness through the speed and angle of attack for a fixed formulation identical to the optimized one for spin-coating allows the BHJ thickness to be tuned without modifying drying conditions. As a result, the BHJ nanomorphologies are essentially identical in the BHJs produced by blade-coating for all intents and purposes. This is easily verified by performing PL quenching measurements on blade-coated films of different thicknesses, as this measurement is related to the degree of exciton quenching at the D:A interface. The thickness-normalized PL spectra for the 90–220 nm thickness range is shown to be identical for all films (ESI Fig. S1†), indicating that all BHJs in the study exhibit the same effective interfacial area and interfacial molecular interactions. It is worth pointing out that achieving the same degree of independent control of nanomorphologies for films of different thicknesses can be difficult by spin-coating. To illustrate this, we have performed spin-coating experiments which yield thinner BHJ films by increasing the spin speed (Table 2). The spin-cast device with the same active layer thickness (68 nm) shows a significant mismatch of Jsc up from 12.6 mA cm−2 (blade-coating) to 15.5 mA cm−2 (spin-coating), and reduced FF from 69.6% (blade-coating) to 63.1% (spin-coating), with the result that PCEave (PCEmax) increases less strikingly from 6.5% (6.7%) to 6.8% (7.1%) (see Fig. S2† for J–V characteristics). The differences in the device figures of merit in terms of Jsc (−19%) and FF (+10%) point to meaningful differences between the BHJ layers of identical thickness prepared by spin- and blade-coating. However, the smaller net difference in PCE (−4%) can easily mask this effect or lead it to be ignored. The thickness-corrected PL data for the spin-cast films at low and high speeds show significant difference (Fig. S3†) supporting the notion that the BHJ phase separation changes with spin-coating conditions.
2.2 Rational process transfer via formulation adjustment
The apparent sensitivity of BHJ nanomorphology as well as device figures of merit, such as the Jsc and FF, to the spin-coating speed when using identical formulations points to the solution drying kinetics being an important parameter in mediating the BHJ formation. Spin-coating and blade-coating of the same formulation at the same temperature will always favor faster drying in the case of spin-coating. This factor may explain the performance differences of the blade-coated and spin-coated BHJs despite having the same physical thickness through controlling the speed and angle of attack. We therefore direct our effort towards understanding the relationship between the formulation, coating process, film formation and nanomorphology to achieve performance parity between blade-cast and champion spin-cast solar cells.
There can be a very large combination of processing conditions (speed, angle, concentration, temperature) which are likely to lead to the same thickness but different BHJ nanomorphologies. We have opted to illustrate how the initial formulation should be adjusted to achieve nanomorphological parity between spin-coating and blade-coating in situations where the coating conditions cannot achieve the same physical thickness, thus requiring the formulation to be adjusted. We therefore take the view that for a given formulation selection, there is a rational choice of film forming conditions. To describe in more detail how processing influences the solution thinning and BHJ film formation, we have monitored the time-evolution of solution thinning during spin-coating (optimized case) and blade-coating (7 mm s−1) using simultaneous spectroscopic reflectometry and ellipsometry (Fig. 3a), as well as in situ UV-Vis absorption measurements (Fig. 3b) to monitor the amount of solute present in the solution and thin film. The spin-coating process of a 25 mg mL−1 solution (75 μL) reveals solution thinning from a 10 μm bulk solution (∼1 s after spinning starts), reaching the additive evaporation-dominated regime at ca. 15 s with a wet thickness of ca. 235 nm. By contrast, blade-coating of the same solution (5–7 μL) thins out from an initial thickness of ca. 4 μm (∼1 s after the blade passes) and enters the additive evaporation-dominated regime at ca. 18 s, reaching a wet thickness of ca. 135 nm. In situ UV-Vis absorption reveals a significant decrease of absorption intensity during spin-coating indicative of solution loss, while the absorption intensity remains constant throughout the process for blade-coating, highlighting the overall low material waste in comparison to spin-coating. As expected, the blade-cast film exhibits much weaker absorption indicating a deficiency of solute, consistent with the thinner wet and dry films. The UV-Vis absorption spectra indicate a strong absorption covering the range from 300 nm to 800 nm. However as PTB7 is reported to exhibit little change in local order between solution and solid states,48 it is difficult to detect changes in the vibronic progressions correlated with local or long range structural evolution during the solution to solid phase transformation (Fig. S4†). This is in contrast to the case of P3HT:PCBM in which P3HT is semi-flexible and its structural evolution is highly sensitive to differences in local and long range order both in solution and in solid states.33,49–52
 Fig. 3  Time-evolution of (a) solution thickness and (b) UV-Vis absorption at λ = 683 nm during spin-coating and blade-coating using the same formulation (25 mg mL−1, 3 v/v% DIO and base temperature 25 °C) (solid black square and solid red circle), as well as blade-coating with an adjusted formulation (50 mg mL−1, 3 v/v% DIO and base temperature 60 °C) (solid blue triangle). The inset shows the end of the solvent evaporation regime, when the wet and additive-laden film is formed. Blade-coating experiments were performed in air at a fixed angle of attack (60°) and a speed of 7 mm s−1. 
The final dry thickness measured by ellipsometry (ca. 100 nm for spin-cast and ca. 65 nm for blade-cast) is reflected in the weaker absorption and reduced wet thickness at the end of the solvent drying stage, where the volume swelling is ca. 50%, indicating that the same relative amount of additive remains in the final wet film.
The solvent drying rate in the blade-coating process is approximately 3 times slower than in spin-coating, where ca. 9.7 μm thickness was lost in 15 s (0.65 μm s−1) vs. ca. 3.9 μm in 18 s (0.22 μm s−1) for blade-coating. The kinetic differences observed herein can influence the BHJ nanomorphology and require further investigation as well, as these are all known factors influencing device performance in BHJ solar cells.53–55 We have performed photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements on the different BHJ films and summarize the results in Fig. 4a. The thickness-corrected PL intensity decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude when introducing DIO in the spin-cast formulation, indicating significant increase in D:A interactions and possibly an increase of the interfacial area.56,57 The blade-cast BHJ using the formulation optimized for spin-coating exhibits weaker PL intensity than the optimal spin-cast BHJ, confirming that solvent drying acts as an important parameter in mediating the BHJ formation.
 Fig. 4  (a) Thickness-corrected photoluminescence spectra (PL) and (b)–(f) RGB composite images obtained from plan-view EFTEM analysis of spin-cast and blade-cast films prepared using different formulations. Blade-coating experiments were performed in air. The angle of attack is fixed at 60°. 
Plan-view energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was performed on as-cast BHJ films prepared by spin-coating and blade-coating, together with thickness-corrected elemental mappings of carbon (284 eV) and sulfur (165 eV) which are associated predominantly with PC71BM and PTB7 rich phases, respectively. In Fig. 4b–f we summarize the composite images of sulfur (green) and carbon (red) mapping for films prepared with different processing conditions. Looking more in detail at the phase separation in Fig. 4b and c, we find excessively large (100–300 nm) globular fullerene domains surrounded by PTB7 in the absence of additives in the CB solution, with solar cells yielding no more than 4.1% PCE (Fig. S5†). The DIO additive results in significantly finer domains with dimensions in the 30–100 nm range, in agreement with previous reports.49,58 This confirms that the additive is a key parameter controlling phase separation in spin-cast films, as it controls the nucleation density of phases during solution drying. With the knowledge that the DIO additive drives the formation of finer domains, it is possible to adjust the formulation and processing conditions to achieve morphological similarity between spin-cast and blade-cast films.
The BHJ morphology obtained by blade-coating the same formulation as optimized for spin-coating (Fig. 4d) but at 7 mm s−1 is significantly finer than the spin-cast BHJ layer, in agreement with the enhanced PL quenching observed in Fig. 4a. We attribute this to the slower drying kinetics of the solution on the stationary substrate as opposed to the fast-spinning substrate (Fig. 3a). The slower solvent drying rate likely delays the liquid–liquid phase separation and inhibits formation of large fullerene domains.13 Hence, the slow drying in the presence of the same amount of additive promotes additional mixing of the donor and acceptor, in agreement with PL observation.
We now set out to increase the film thickness and change the drying speed of the solution at the same blade-coating speed with the aim of achieving a thicker film with slightly coarser morphology. We do so by doubling the solute concentration to 50 mg mL−1 and by raising the base temperature to 60 °C, making it match the starting solution temperature and effectively compensating for cooling effects. In these experiments, the concentration of the additive is maintained unchanged at 3%. The change of concentration allows us to increase the film thickness to ca. 100 nm, matching the spin-cast BHJ thickness. This experiment yields a coarser BHJ morphology than desired, as seen by EFTEM (Fig. 4e) and yields a PCE of 7.6% (Fig. S6†). The elevated base temperature keeps the material well-dissolved and reduces the viscosity of the solution, which is most likely why the film thickness increases only by 50% when doubling the concentration. As a result of heating, the solution thinning also occurs more rapidly, as seen in Fig. 3a, proving that maintaining the substrate at 60 °C keeps the solution warm and greatly enhances its evaporation as compared to when the warm solution is cast on a room temperature substrate. In fact, the ca. 3 μm solution reaches the solvent evaporation-dominated regime in ca. 4 s (ca. 0.75 μm s−1), slightly faster than the spin-cast solution. The observation of substantially faster evaporation when casting a warm solution on a warm stationary sample as opposed to casting a warm solution on a cold but spinning sample highlights remarkable differences that such process details may have on the drying kinetics of the solution.
With an eye on achieving morphological similarity with the spin-cast BHJ layer and recalling the sensitivity of BHJ nanomorphology to the additive content, we have further doubled the amount of DIO in the solution to 6% by volume so as to maintain the same ratio of additive to solute in the spin-cast and blade-cast formulations. In doing so, we achieve a nearly perfect match of the PL intensity and of the qualitative morphology as seen by EFTEM with the champion spin-cast BHJ layer (Fig. 4a and f). In Fig. 5a we have plotted the J–V characteristics for typical spin-cast and blade-cast cells with the re-optimized processing conditions. The optimized blade-cast cells show an identical average PCE of 8.8% with a maximum PCE of 9.0% (see Fig. S7† for the statistical distribution of PCE). The solar cells also achieve very similar external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) as seen in Fig. 5b. It is worth noting that we have also investigated the optimal additive-to-solute ratio for PTB7:PC71BM for blade coating experiments at different temperatures ranging between room temperature and 90 °C (not shown) and found the optimum ratio to be the same as that of the optimal spin-cast formulation. This achievement in effect proves that, by understanding the process- and formulation-dependent film thickness, the roles of the additive and the kinetics of evaporation, we can successfully upscale the processing parameters and bridge the performance gap between the printed solar cell and champion spin-cast solar cell.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of spin-cast and blade-cast films are shown in the inset of (b). 
Encouraged by the successful demonstration of morphological and performance parities for PTB7:PC71BM solar cells fabricated by spin-coating and blade-coating, we have extended our understanding of upscaling parameters to other widely studied polymer:fullerene systems. We have investigated the comparatively lower viscosity PBDTTT-CT:PC71BM system compared to PTB7:PC71BM (Fig. S8†) and fabricated devices with the so-called standard architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/Ca/Al. The comparatively higher viscosity PTB7-Th:PC71BM system (Fig. S8†) was used to fabricate so-called inverted devices of glass/ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag. The spin-cast PBDTTT-CT:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells achieve a PCE of 6.5% (Fig. 6a) and 8.6% (Fig. 6b), respectively (see also Table 3). All solutions were based on CB with a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 and 3% DIO by volume and were cast on a room temperature substrate.

In the lower viscosity case of PBDTTT-CT:PC71BM, the simple transfer of the optimal spin-cast formulation to blade-coating was unsuccessful and resulted in a significant mismatch of Jsc, down from 11.96 mA cm−2 to 3.56 mA cm−2, and reduced FF from 67.8% to 42.5%, with the result that PCE decreased from 6.5% to 1.1% (Fig. 6a and Table 3). The lower viscosity is responsible for a reduced mismatch of BHJ thickness. To achieve the same thickness without changing the speed of blade-coating, we have tripled the solute concentration and the DIO volume fraction commensurately to 9%, but find that the performance does not improve sufficiently. We attribute this to the significantly slower evaporation of the solvent and additive. We have therefore increased the base temperature to 60 °C with the aim to obtain faster solution drying kinetics. In doing so, we have matched the PL spectrum of the champion BHJ prepared by spin-coating (Fig. S9†), indicating first order morphological parity. The blade-cast devices achieve a Jsc of 12.38 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.77 V, a FF of 68.5%, resulting in a PCE of 6.5%, which is on par with the spin-cast solar cells.
In the higher viscosity case of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the blade-cast film based on the same formulation as spin-coating yields a slightly lower PCE of 9.4%, which is due to a slightly lower FF, 65.9% in comparison to 69.8%. The major reason for the decreased FF is due to ca. 30 nm higher thickness of the blade-coated film, which we attribute to entrainment of the highly viscous solution of high molecular weight of PTB7-Th (154 kDa) on a cold sample stage. To reduce the viscosity, we have increased the base temperature to 45 °C, with the aim of maintaining most of the polymer dissolved in solution and not altering the drying kinetics too drastically. The resulting blade-cast solar cells achieve a similar thickness to the spin-cast ones and performance parity with a PCE of 9.7%, a Jsc of 17.14 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V, and a FF of 70.5%.
As a final demonstration of the potential of this work to translate to flexible substrates, we have fabricated PTB7:PC71BM solar cells with the architecture of PET/ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag using the optimized blade-coating and spin-coating formulations. A photograph of the flexible device is shown in Fig. 6c. The flexible devices fabricated from spin-cast and blade-cast BHJ layers exhibit a slight decrease in Voc from 0.72 V to 0.69 V but a significant decrease in FF from 66.7% to 60.5%, with the result of the PCE decreasing from 7.4% to 6.3%. The lower PCE of 6.3% for blade-cast cells, which is 70% of the rigid device's performance, comes from the lower transparency of PET but also from a decrease in Voc and FF, which could partially be associated with the higher series resistance (2.48 Ω cm2vs. 1.54 Ω cm2) and lower shunt resistance (4.3 kΩ cm2vs. 26.24 kΩ cm2) of the blade-cast devices as compared with spin-cast ones. Other contributions to the loss of FF could also be the non-uniformity of the electron transporting layer (ZnO) in the flexible cells and slight differences in the active layer on the rigid glass and flexible PET substrate, including thickness and nanoscale morphology which could arise from the different thermal conductivities of the rigid glass and flexible PET substrates as well as larger optical loss of the flexible PET substrate. In spite of these shortcomings, this is to our knowledge the only report in the literature of a flexible organic solar cell with a printed photoactive layer yielding PCE >6% in a single junction configuration.58–60
In contrast to the case of P3HT, which has a semi-flexible chain,61 the modern donor systems studied herein exhibit a rigid backbone. The vibronic progressions of such systems are thus remarkably insensitive to whether the polymer is solvated and dissolved or aggregated in the solution or solid states, as shown in Fig. 3 and S4,† in stark contrast to P3HT.52,62,63 The local and long range orders of P3HT are extremely sensitive to the formulation and its pre-treatment, to the presence of fullerene, to the processing conditions and to the drying kinetics.51,64–68 By contrast, the modern polymers examined in this study do not exhibit long range crystalline order and appear to be less sensitive to processing conditions. In fact, while phase separation in P3HT:PCBM BHJs is predominantly driven by the crystallization of P3HT,12 it is believed that liquid–liquid phase separation plays a far more important role in the growth of domain size for the more modern polymers studied herein, which can be well-controlled by tuning the additive amount.13 The extreme sensitivity of the BHJ nanomorphology to the amount of additive present in the solution, as shown in Fig. 4, confirms the notion that the latter is the main factor responsible for drying kinetics and the relationship between nucleation and growth of polymer and liquid–liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, achieving nanomorphological parity and device performance parity required that we adjust the drying kinetics through heating of the sample holder, thus allowing the blade coating process to match the faster drying kinetics inherent to spin coating.
3. Conclusions
We have investigated various approaches to overcome the performance gap between printed and champion spin-cast BHJ layers for polymers exhibiting a rigid backbone and little or no long range crystalline order. Our investigation shows that achieving thickness parity is not necessarily tantamount to performance parity. Additional adjustments are needed in the process in order to achieve performance parity. We investigate a hypothetical scenario where the thickness can only be increased by adjusting the formulation, namely the concentration. We find that to maintain morphological parity with spin coating it is crucial to maintain the additive-to-solute volume ratio if adjusting the concentration of solute and in many cases we see a benefit in adjusting the drying kinetics of the solution to match that of spin coating by increasing the process temperature. We have demonstrated that successful transfer from spin-coating to scalable processing can be achieved through a rational approach which should pave the way for more easy process upscaling with minimal performance loss.
4. Experimental part
4.1 Solution preparation and thin film processing
PTB7 (1-material), PTB7-Th (Mw = 154 kDa, 1-material), PBDTTT-CT (Solarmer Material), and PC71BM (American Dye Source) were used as received. The PTB7:PC71BM blend and PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend solutions were prepared by dissolving separately in the ratio of 1:1.5 (by weight), with a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (CB) containing 3% (by volume) of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive and stirring overnight at 60 °C before solution-casting. The PBDTTT-CT:PC71BM blend solution was prepared by dissolving in the ratio of 1:1.5 (by weight), with a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 CB containing 3% (by volume) of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive and stirring overnight at room temperature before solution-casting. The spin-coating experiments were conducted at the optimized speed of 900 rpm for 60 s for the PTB7:PC71BM sample, at the speed of 1500 rpm for 60 s for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM sample, and at the speed of 800 rpm for 50 s for the PBDTTT-CT:PC71BM sample in a N2-filled glove-box and under ambient conditions. Blade coating experiments were performed using a home-built setup previously described in ref. 69–71. In the case of optimization of blade-coating fabrication the solutions were prepared by adjusting the solute concentration and DIO concentration. The blade-coating experiments were performed immediately after dropping the solution into the gap under ambient conditions for all solutions, with the gap height fixed at 100 μm but different angles of attack of the blade, blade speed, base temperature and solution properties. A single crystal Si wafer with a native oxide was used as the blade. It was treated with an OTS self-assembled monolayer and cleaned prior to coating to make sure no contamination was introduced into the ink. All as-cast PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM samples were immediately transferred to a vacuum chamber while PBDTTT-CT:PC71BM samples were kept in a N2-filled glove-box for a 20 min delay followed by device fabrication (see below). Inverted (or regular) solar cells were fabricated on pre-patterned glass/ITO (or PET/ITO) substrates. The substrates were cleaned in detergent (SDS), ultrasonicated in DI water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and exposed to UV-ozone. The zinc oxide precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar ratios of zinc acetate dihydrate (ZAD) (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Sigma Aldrich 99.9%) and monoethanol amine (MEA) (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Sigma Aldrich 99.8%) in 2-methoxy ethanol and stirring overnight at room temperature. The precursor solution was continuously stirred at room temperature for 24 hours to induce hydrolysis in air. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated on cleaned glass/ITO (or PET/ITO) substrates with thickness ca. 15 nm. The as-cast films were then thermally annealed in air at 100–110 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool down to room temperature for inverted solar cells fabrication. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron-P 4083, filtered by a 0.25 μm membrane) solution was spin-coated on cleaned glass/ITO film with thickness 20–30 nm and thermally annealed at 130 °C for 10 min for regular solar cell fabrication.
4.2 Device fabrication
Device fabrication was completed by placing the samples in a high vacuum metal evaporator in the N2-filled glove-box and by depositing electrodes of Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) for regular solar cells and MoOx (7 nm)/Ag (80 nm) for inverted solar cells. The active area of the devices was 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 under a simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded using an Oriel Quantum Efficiency Measurement Kit (Newport).
4.3 Electron microscopy
A transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 300 kV (Titan Cryo Twin, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) was used to acquire plan-view micrographs using a 4k × 4k charged couple device (CCD) camera model US4000 and an energy filter model GIF Tridiem from Gatan, Inc. (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). The GIF was utilized in energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) mode to image the carbon and sulfur distribution in the sample. The carbon edge located at 284 eV and sulfur edge at 165 eV were selected to generate the EFTEM maps using a 3-window method. The elemental maps of carbon and sulfur were corrected assuming a sample thickness of 100 nm. The samples were prepared by floating the thin film in water and picking it up using a 400 mesh copper grid.
4.4 Optical metrology

Ex situ UV-visible absorption spectra were acquired on a Cary 5000 (Varian) instrument. Ex situ variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) was performed using a M-2000XI rotating compensator (J. A. Woollam Co., Inc.) to determine the dry thickness. In situ optical measurements were performed using a F20-UVX spectrometer (Filmetrics, Inc.) equipped with tungsten halogen and deuterium light sources (Filmetrics, Inc.) over the wavelength range of interest from 400 nm to 800 nm. Most measurements are performed with an integration time of 0.5 s per absorption spectrum. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded in backscattering geometry on a LabRAM Aramis (Horiba Jobin Yvon) Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser used as the excitation source. A 100× objective lens with a numerical aperture (N. A.) of 0.90 was used to focus the laser beam and collect scattered light. The typical acquisition time was 1 s, and the laser power was kept at 0.006 mW to avoid the heating effect. The PL intensity was thickness-corrected assuming a film thickness of 100 nm.
4.5 Rheology measurements
Rheology measurements were carried out on an Anton Paar MCR-301 rheometer with a Peltier temperature control system and a cone-and plate geometry with 25 mm diameter plates and a 11 cone angle. The three investigated blend solutions (25 mg mL−1, 3 v/v% DIO as the additive) were measured under ambient conditions.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of the donor polymer and acceptor and schematic representations of the inverted organic solar cell, the spin-coating and blade-coating processes. J–V characteristics of a representative champion spin-cast PTB7:PC71BM device are shown in (b and c), along with (b) blade-cast devices prepared at different blade speeds at a fixed angle of attack (45°, with respect to the substrate plane), (c) at different angles of attack at 7 mm s−1 and (d) at different angles of attack at 15 mm s−1. In all cases, the formulation used (25 mg mL−1 of PTB7:PC71BM in CB with 3 v/v% DIO) was the same as the one devised for champion spin-cast solar cells.
