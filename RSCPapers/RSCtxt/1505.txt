    , Accepted 19th December 2020First published on 22nd December 2020AbstractIn this work, a type-II heterojunction was constructed between g-C3N4 and BiOI by ultrasonically assisted hydrothermal synthesis for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The g-C3N4 was decorated on BiOI microspheres with a well-defined heterostructure, which reduced the charge recombination process, consistent with the data from photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material exhibits enhanced photocurrent density, ∼13-fold higher than that of g-C3N4 and ∼2 fold higher than pristine BiOI. Furthermore, high stability was achieved for the g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material with 6 wt% g-C3N4 for up to 6000 s at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the photo-conversion efficiency reached 14-fold higher than that of g-C3N4 and 1.6 times higher than that of BiOI microspheres. The high photoelectrocatalytic performance achieved by the 6% g-C3N4/BiOI material was attributed to the formation of type-II heterojunction between the g-C3N4 and BiOI interfaces that could facilitate the photoinduced charge separation–migration and thereby minimize the charge recombination process.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an emerging architecture for the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) process in which sunlight converts water into hydrogen through the visible light active semiconductor as a photocatalyst.1–3 In 1972, after the invention of TiO2 semiconductor photocatalyst, numerous semiconductor materials4 have been employed in PEC water splitting.5–7 Recently, bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, and I) materials have been extensively implemented in visible light active photocatalytic applications due to their excellent optical, electrical properties, and unique layered tetragonal crystal structures.8 Among them, the BiOI semiconductor has been recognized as the most capable visible light active photocatalyst with an appropriate bandgap of 1.6 to 1.9 eV.9 Huang et al. reported BiOI nanosheets vertically aligned with hierarchical BiOI microplates that enhanced the visible light activity through photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B.10 Moreover, the BiOI photocatalyst could be utilized in organic solar cells11 and for CO2 reduction under visible/NIR light irradiation as reported by Ye et al.12 Also, Huang et al. investigated the photocatalytic applications of BiOI-based 3D hierarchical structures,13 and a p–n junction with Bi12O17Cl214 and g-C3N4.15 Nevertheless, the BiOI photocatalytic activity was restricted due to several drawbacks, such as high charge recombination, poor charge separation, and sluggish charge transfer. Hence, many strategies such as doping, co-catalyst addition, and heterojunction formation16–19 are explored to improve the photocatalytic activity of BiOI. Many BiOI-based heterojunction materials are employed in photocatalytic and PEC water splitting, such as BiOI/ZnO,20 BiOI/WO3,21 BiOI/TiO2,22 and BiOI/BiVO4.23 Similarly, polymeric carbon-based semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a non-toxic, metal-free, cost-effective, active material in the visible region24–26 with a bandgap of 2.7 eV; hence, it has been extensively used in solar energy-related applications.27–29 Di et al. reported the sphere-like BiOI uniformly formed over the g-C3N4 nanostructure to alleviate the photocatalytic degradation of toxic chemicals.30 To date, except for photocatalytic studies on BiOI, Hahn et al. have only reported PEC water splitting in the acetonitrile/NaI electrolyte with a photocurrent density of 0.9 mA cm−2.31 Hence, the aforementioned g-C3N4/BiOI heterojunction properties have inspired the evaluation of PEC activity through water splitting studies. Based on the above consideration, here, we report the ultrasonically-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid materials and used it in the photoelectrochemical water splitting. Based on the analytical characterization and photoelectrochemical experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

3. Results and discussion
The DRS spectra of g-C3N4, BiOI, and g-C3N4/BiOI (Fig. 1A) illustrates the band edge positions observed at 476, 689, and 678 nm, respectively. The absorption peaks within the range of 300–400 nm correspond to π–π* transition of the conjugated aromatic system. The absorption peak at approximately 600 nm is attributed to the n–π* transition between the lone-pair of electrons in the triazine rings. Moreover, in 3, 6, and 9 wt% g-C3N4 incorporated BiOI, the absorption edge blue-shifted in the visible region (Fig. S1A, ESI†). These results indicated that the visible light response of BiOI was influenced by the introduction of the g-C3N4 content.30 The XRD patterns (Fig. 1B) of g-C3N4 are consistent with those in the JCPDS card no. 00-87-1526. The peaks at 2θ values of 12.8° (100) and 27.8° (002) plane correspond to the interlayer structural packing and interplanar stacking of the aromatic system, respectively.32,33 The XRD pattern of BiOI is consistent with data from the JCPDS no. 00-010-0445. The four major planes (102), (110), (200), and (212) were associated with 2θ values of 30.1°, 32.2°, 45.9°, and 55.7°, respectively.34 Besides, g-C3N4/BiOI there is no significant appearance of g-C3N4 peaks due to the small content (3, 6, and 9 wt%) of g-C3N4 (Fig. S1B, ESI†). FT-IR peaks at 810 and 1640 cm−1 are ascribed to triazine unit and vibration modes of CN stretching, respectively,35 for g-C3N4 (Fig. 1C). The peaks at 1246, 1324 and 1414, could be allocated to aromatic C–N stretching, and 3175 cm−1 due to the stretching mode of terminal NH groups.36 The BiOI microspheres have the Bi–O stretching that could be observed at 501 cm−1.37 For g-C3N4/BiOI, a slight shift at 510 cm−1 was observed, which indicates an interaction between g-C3N4 and BiOI. It could also be observed in 3, 6, and 9 wt% of g-C3N4 contained in g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid materials (Fig. S1C, ESI†). The peak at approximately 1615 cm−1 indicates the H-OH bending mode of BiOI; this was seen in the g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid, which implies the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiOI.38 The high PL intensity (Fig. 1D) of g-C3N4 represents the high charge recombination of g-C3N4 compared with that of BiOI and g-C3N4/BiOI it leads to poor charge separation. While g-C3N4 integrated with BiOI (Fig. 1D (inset)), the g-C3N4 recombination could be highly hindered by the heterojunction formation of g-C3N4/BiOI.39 However, the amount of g-C3N4 increases into BiOI microspheres, the PL intensity increased due to the high recombination property of g-C3N4 (Fig. S1D, ESI†).

The bandgap of the synthesized materials was predicted by Tauc's plot relation of (αhν)1/2vs. hν, where hν stands for photon energy and α represents the absorption co-efficient. The bandgap energies were found as 2.6 and 1.8 eV for g-C3N4, and BiOI microspheres, respectively (Fig. S2A, ESI†). After incorporating different amounts of g-C3N4 into BiOI, the bandgap energy was reduced owing to an increase in the visible light absorption (Fig. S2B, ESI†). The Raman spectra indicate that g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/BiOI exhibited two significant peaks at 1350 and 1650 cm−1 represented as D and G bands, respectively, indicating the graphitic nature of g-C3N4.40 BiOI exhibits strong peaks at 154 cm−1 was assigned to the Bi–I vibration in BiOI (Fig. S2C, ESI†). The amount of g-C3N4 increased into BiOI, the intensity of D and G bands increased (Fig. S2D, ESI†).
The morphologies of BiOI and g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid were investigated using SEM and HRTEM techniques. The sphere-like structure indicates microsphere morphology for BiOI (Fig. 2A and B) and this morphology was not disturbed when the g-C3N4 was introduced into the BiOI (Fig. 2C and D). The HR-TEM image (Fig. 3A) showed a microsphere like morphology for BiOI and Fig. 3B showed 71 to 89 nm size-layered structures of BiOI. Fig. 3(C–E) confirm the successful incorporation of g-C3N4 into BiOI. Moreover, the lattice fringes related to the BiOI microspheres were recognized (Fig. 3F) and lattice fringes of g-C3N4 were slightly observed (Fig. 3F (inset)) due to the huge amorphous nature of g-C3N4 compared to that of BiOI microspheres. From the lattice fringes, d-spacing values matched very well with (102) and (002) planes, as seen from the XRD patterns of BiOI and g-C3N4. Hence, the heterojunction formation of BiOI microspheres and g-C3N4 was confirmed. The HAADF-STEM mode images and its consequent elemental mapping for the g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material were captured and shown in Fig. 3(G–N). The combination of individual elements such as C, N, Bi, O, and I (Fig. 3G–N) confirmed the formation of g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material, and it was found free from any other impurities. The oxidation state and surface composition of BiOI (Fig. S3, ESI†) and g-C3N4/BiOI (Fig. 4) were analyzed using XPS spectroscopy. The survey spectrum implied that C, N, Bi, O, and I (Fig. 4A) were observed in g-C3N4/BiOI. Fig. 4B shows the C 1s core-level spectrum with different peaks at 284.5, 287.4, and 292.3 eV that could be assigned to C–C (sp2-bond),41 N–CN, and a satellite peak for π–π* aromatics,9,42 respectively. The N 1s core-level spectrum indicates that the CN–C,43 N–(C)3, and C–N–H44 amino functions are associated with their binding energies 397.6, 398.3, and 399.8 eV, respectively45,46 (Fig. 4C). The peaks at the binding energies of 158.7 and 164.1 eV were due to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively. The peak at 158.7 eV for Bi 4f7/2 (Fig. 4D) was due to the trivalent oxidation state (Bi3+) of bismuth. However, bare BiOI exhibited Bi 4f7/2 at 158.6 eV and Bi 4f5/2 at 163.9 eV (Fig. S3B, ESI†) representing the 0.2 eV shift and confirming the formation of a heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiOI.47 The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4E) is ascribed to lattice oxygen (529.2 eV), surface hydroxyls (530.7 eV), and adsorbed water molecules (532.7 eV). The two characteristic peaks positioned at 618.3 and 629.9 eV binding energies (Fig. 4F) are assigned to I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2, respectively.30

PEC experiments were conducted with fabricated photoelectrodes in different electrolytes including 0.5 M Na2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 0.5 M of NaHCO3 + Na2SO3 solution. There was no significant PEC activity observed in 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 1 M KOH. The obtained photocurrent densities in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at 10 mV s−1 scan rate were 0.63, 0.29, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.61 μA cm−2 for g-C3N4, BiOI, 3, 6, and 9% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid materials, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, from 1 M KOH with 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, the obtained photocurrent densities were 1.88, 0.84, 0.57, 0.78, and 2.53 μA cm−2 (Fig. S5, ESI†) for g-C3N4, BiOI, 3, 6 and 9% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid materials, respectively. Fig. 5A shows the dark response of g-C3N4, BiOI, and 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid with the minimum current. Nevertheless, during the light illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), the current was significantly increased for 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material (Fig. 5B), which implied that the fabricated semiconductor photoanode material could be highly photoactive capable of water splitting into oxygen atoms as the working electrode. In chopped conditions, the 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material transient photocurrent response could be higher than that of g-C3N4 and BiOI microspheres (Fig. S6A, ESI†).

Moreover, the transient photocurrent response was obtained using chronoamperometry under light on–off conditions, leading to the evaluation of the charge-carrier separation and migration efficiency of coated photoelectrode materials. From Fig. S6B (ESI†), it can be seen that the photocurrent intensity has been drastically enhanced up to 25 μA cm−2 compared to those of g-C3N4 (5 μA cm−2) and BiOI (15 μA cm−2) microspheres for 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material. This indicates that more photoexcited charge carriers were transferred to the external circuit in 6% g-C3N4/BiOI under the optimized experimental environment48 in which these results were consistent with the photoluminescence spectra. The photocurrent densities for g-C3N4, BiOI, 3, 6 and 9% g-C3N4/BiOI in a mixture of 0.5 M NaHCO3 + Na2SO3 with 100 mW cm−2 light illumination at 10 mV s−1 scan rate were 9.73, 76.3, 93.8, 131.6, and 16.8 μA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 6A and B). Furthermore, the NaHCO3 with Na2SO3 could co-exist in the same aqueous electrolyte. However, NaHCO3 acts as the electrolyte and Na2SO3 serves as a sacrificial electron donor. Hence, the photogenerated holes could be rapidly consumed49 and it enhances the charge separation and reduces the electron–hole pair recombination. Hence, the high photocurrent density was obtained for 6% g-C3N4/BiOI as compared to that for other fabricated photoelectrodes. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid was significantly enhanced by the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiOI.37,50

The flat-band potential was calculated using Poisson's equation and the details are given in the ESI.† The flat-band potentials of g-C3N4 and BiOI were found to be 0.02 and 0.11 V vs. RHE, respectively (Fig. 7A and B). More cathodic flat-band potential of BiOI could facilitate the charge separation and charge transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface; hence, the overall PEC efficiency was increased.51,52

The ABPE of fabricated photoelectrodes was calculated from eqn (1)53 ABPE (%) = [Jphoto × (Erc − Eapp)]/Pphoto(1)where Jphoto and Pphoto stand for the measured photocurrent in mA cm−2 and power density of illuminated light AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), respectively. Erc and Eapp represent standard cell potential (1.23 V vs. RHE) and applied potential, respectively.54 The ABPE (%) plot vs. applied potential shows that the maximum efficiency of 4.9 × 10−3 could be reached for 6% g-C3N4/BiOI (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, it could be 14 times higher than that for g-C3N4 (0.35 × 10−3) and 1.6 times higher than that for BiOI (3.1 × 10−3). In addition, the electrode material stability was investigated with 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material in 0.5 M Na2SO3 + NaHCO3 aqueous electrolyte at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Thus, steady and long-time photocurrent durability curves show that the photoelectrode material was stable up to 6000 s during light irradiation (Fig. 8B).

Table 1 summarizes various BiOI-based materials employed in PEC water splitting. None of them reported the stability of the BiOI based material during PEC water splitting with light illumination. However, the performance of the 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material indicated that it could be a highly stable material for PEC water splitting.

The electrode/electrolyte interfacial charge transfer behaviors of the fabricated photoanodes were investigated by EIS under light illumination with frequency ranges from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz (Fig. 8C). The Nyquist plot implies that the g-C3N4 and BiOI possess a high semicircle arc that represents high charge transfer resistance values of 22.2 and 37.2 kΩ, respectively, which implies a sluggish charge transfer for both bare photoanode materials. However, the 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material exhibits a smaller arc radius of charge transfer resistance of 18.7 kΩ, which portrays a rapid interfacial charge transfer compared to both bare photoanodes under visible light illumination.59 The solution resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values of fabricated photoanodes are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Hence, g-C3N4/BiOI heterojunction significantly boosts the photogenerated charge carriers transfer into the electrolyte, which leads to enhancement of the PEC performance.60–62Fig. 8D shows the peak fitted EIS curve with an equivalent circuit for the 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material. It could be fitted (Fig. 8D inset) with a combination of solution resistances (Rs) connected with series charge transfer resistance (Rct), Warburg impedance (W), and parallelly connected with double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The Nyquist plot exhibits two ranges that could be attributed to Rct as a semicircle at high frequency and W as a straight line at low frequency.
The g-C3N4/BiOI charge transfer mechanism was proposed based on the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potential levels of g-C3N4 and BiOI using eqn (S2) and (S3) given in the ESI.† The g-C3N4 and BiOI absolute electronegativities are 4.73 and 5.01 eV, respectively.63,64 Hence, the VB potential was reported to be +1.63 and +2.41 eV for g-C3N4 and BiOI, respectively. Moreover, the VB potential of BiOI (+2.41 eV) could be positive than that of g-C3N4 (+1.63 eV) and CB of g-C3N4 (−0.97 eV) would be more negative than that of BiOI (+0.61 eV). Consequently, the g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure follows the photogenerated electrons that were transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of BiOI. Furthermore, the holes were moved from the VB of BiOI to the VB of g-C3N4. Therefore, the g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure follows type-II mechanism65–67 that could be favorable for PEC water splitting68,69 (Fig. 9).

4. Conclusion
This work describes the ultrasonically assisted hydrothermal synthesis of g-C3N4, BiOI microspheres and g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid materials. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid is 13 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and ∼2 times higher than that of BiOI under visible light illumination. Moreover, 6% g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid material exhibits high stability of up to 6000 s at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the ABPE efficiency 14-folds higher than that of g-C3N4 and 1.6 times higher than that of BiOI microspheres. The heterojunction effectively induces charge separation, migration, and hinders charge recombination; hence, g-C3N4/BiOI hybrid materials illustrates new opportunities for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting.
