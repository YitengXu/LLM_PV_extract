    , Accepted 14th December 2016First published on 15th December 2016AbstractTwo novel asymmetric thiophene/pyridine flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymers, named PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were designed, synthesized and applied in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). In contrast to the reported bipyridine flanked DPP, the asymmetric DPP polymers incorporating thiophene/pyridine flankers exhibited narrower bandgaps of ∼1.5 eV and deeper HOMO energy levels, thus leading to a broadened absorption from 500 to 850 nm and were potentially beneficial for low-energy photon harvesting. Both polymers displayed promising ambipolar semiconducting properties. The hole and electron mobilities of PPyTDPP-TT reach 0.48 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1; and PPyTDPP-BT reach 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Intriguingly, due to their ambipolar properties, two polymers can play an ambipolar role, both as electron donors and acceptors with PC71BM and P3HT in PSCs. Photovoltaic devices based on PPyTDPP-BT as the donor material reach PCEs of 7.56% and achieve 0.59% as the acceptor material, while those based on PPyTDPP-TT reach 5.48% with PC71BM and 0.82% with P3HT, respectively. These results suggest that the adoption of asymmetric flanker DPP polymers can effectively tune the absorption properties of polymers as excellent ambipolar transporting polymers towards high performance in both OFETs and PSCs.
1 Introduction
Conjugated polymers have been regarded as promising materials for organic electronics since the first report of semiconducting polythiophenes.1,2 One of their attractive advantages is that their critical physical properties, such as energy levels, bandgaps and optical absorption can be easily tuned by backbone modification to suit the different application fields. As a result of the tremendous efforts in the past, many new building blocks have been successfully designed and applied in developing novel conjugated polymers to construct optoelectronic devices, such as organic field effect transistors (OFETs)3,4 and polymer solar cells (PSCs).5–11 Among the most promising building blocks, electron deficient thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based copolymers have been widely studied due to their potential towards the high performance of both OFETs and PSCs.12–16 It has been discovered that DPP based polymers generally exhibit intense intermolecular π–π interactions between their main chains,17 the good aggregating properties of which are attributed to the strong electron deficiency and good planarity of the DPP core. Since the first DPP-based semiconducting polymer reported by the Winnewisser group,18 to date, various DPP polymers have been synthesized and demonstrated high charge carrier mobilities in OFETs16,19–22 and excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in PSCs.23–25 For example, a prominent polymer PDPP-TT consisting of thiophene-flanked DPP with ring fused thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (TT) showed a high hole mobility of up to 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.26 A remarkable PCE has also been achieved of up to 9.4% for the blend system of PDPP-TT (2-decyltetradecyl group as the alkyl chains) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).27
Due to the attractive excellent optoelectronic properties of thiophene-flanked DPP polymers, other DPP copolymers flanked by five-membered aromatic rings (selenophene, furan, thiazole etc.) or six-membered aromatic rings (benzene, pyridine etc.) have also been extensively investigated.11 These studies indicated that the replacement of flanking groups in conjugated backbones could effectively tune the photoelectric properties of DPP based polymers under the effect of different electron donating natures of the flanking groups. Recently, Jo’s group reported an electron-accepting symmetric pyridine flanked DPP (PyDPP) (Scheme 1) based polymer, PPyDPP-BT, which was obtained by polymerization of PyDPP with 2,2′-bithiophene (BT).28PPyDPP-BT had a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.77 eV, which provided a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and displayed an optical bandgap of 1.93 eV in thin films. However, PSCs fabricated from PPyDPP-BT gave the best PCE of only 4.9%, which is notably lower than their counterparts with narrow band gap DPP polymers, which is probably due to its relatively wider band gap. As we know, generally, an optical band gap of 1.4–1.5 eV is required for DPP PSCs with PCEs above 7.0% to harvest photons with lower energy.27
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of symmetric PyDPP and asymmetric PyTDPP units. 
Compared with the symmetric conjugated building blocks, asymmetric conjugated units have recently received increasing attention due to their ability for easily tuning the molecular physicochemical properties towards high performance semiconducting polymer materials.29–34 With this in mind, in this study, we present two novel asymmetric thiophene/pyridine flanked DPP (Scheme 1) based copolymers, PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT (Scheme 2), with the consideration of altering HOMO and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels via the synergistic effect of thiophene/pyridine in the conjugated unit for ambipolar OFETs and high performance in PSCs.29 As expected, two novel DPP polymers, PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT exhibited typical ambipolar properties, with hole mobilities of 0.48 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPyTDPP-TT and hole mobilities of 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPyTDPP-BT, respectively. We attribute the ambipolar characteristics of PyTDPP polymers to the relatively small band-gap (∼1.5 eV) with appropriate HOMO energy levels of −5.14 to −5.28 eV and LUMO energy levels of −3.60 to −3.75 eV, which potentially render them qualified as both electron donors and acceptors in devices. In terms of PSCs, as the donor materials, PPyTDPP-TT:PC71BM and PPyTDPP-BT:PC71BM solar cells gave PCEs of 5.48% and 7.56%, respectively. As the acceptor materials, the PPyTDPP-TT:P3HT and PPyTDPP-BT:P3HT solar cells gave PCEs of 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. These results suggest that the asymmetric thiophene/pyridine flanked diketopyrrolopyrroles are promising building blocks for developing ambipolar conjugated polymers towards high performance optoelectronic devices.

2 Experimental
Materials and synthesis
The asymmetric DPP monomer 6 was obtained through the modification of a reported synthetic route.29–31 Starting from the commercial available 2-acetylthiophene, after decarboxylation and substitution reaction, followed by cyclization of intermediate 2, the desired methyl 5-oxo-2-(thiophen-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate 3 was obtained. The asymmetric DPP 4 was prepared by condensation reaction of 3 with 5-bromopicolinonitrile. N-Alkylation of 4 and subsequent bromination of 5 afforded the asymmetric monomer 6. The synthesis of monomers 3 and 4 was according to ref. 32 Finally, polymers PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were synthesized via Stille polymerization. The detailed synthetic route as well as structural characterization is described in the ESI.†
Synthesis of PPyTDPP-TT: under an argon atmosphere, a mixture of two monomers (0.10 mmol, respectively) and Pd(PPh3)4 (3.5 mg, 0.003 mmol, 3 mol%) was dissolved in degassed toluene (6 mL) in a Schlenk tube. The reaction was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h, followed by addition of 2-bromothiophene (0.5 mL) to react with the trimethylstannyl end group. The mixture was further stirred at 110 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was precipitated into chilled methanol (20 mL). Then the crude polymer was collected by filtration and purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane and the remaining product was dissolved with refluxing chlorobenzene. The chlorobenzene solution was then concentrated by evaporation and precipitated into methanol, and dried over a vacuum. Finally, the desired polymer was obtained. 97% yield; GPC (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 120 °C): Mn = 120 KDa, Mw = 352 KDa, PDI = 2.9; anal. calcd for C69H107N3O2S3, C, 74.88; H, 9.74; N, 3.80, found: C, 74.55; H, 9.53; N, 3.83.
Synthesis of PPyTDPP-BT: the synthetic procedure was similar to that described for PPyTDPP-TT. 98% yield; GPC (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 120 °C): Mn = 123 KDa, Mw = 286 KDa, PDI = 2.3; anal. calcd for C71H107N3O2S3, C, 75.41; H, 9.54; N, 3.72, found: C, 75.05; H, 9.49; N, 3.74. The detailed synthetic route as well as structural characterization is described in the ESI.†
Fabrication of OFET devices
Commercially available polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets with a thickness of 200 μm were used as substrates. The substrates were cleaned using deionized water, alcohol, and rinsed in acetone and dried by nitrogen before device fabrication. PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with a concentration of 4 mg mL−1, respectively. The polymer solution was spin-coated onto PET sheets with a pre-patterned 20 nm gold source and drain electrodes (channel width 4500 μm, channel length 50 μm) at 2000 rpm. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) dissolved in n-butyl acetate (60 mg mL−1) was spin-coated above the active layer as the dielectric layer and dried at 90 °C for 30 min, giving a 900 nm film with a capacitance of ∼3.2 nF cm−2. Finally, 70 nm aluminium was thermally deposited on PMMA to complete the OTFTs. The field-effect characteristics of the devices were determined in nitrogen using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer.
Fabrication of organic photovoltaic cells
Polymer donors were obtained according to our previously reported methods. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.295 g of zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%, Aldrich, U.S.A.) and 0.082 g of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.5%, Aldrich, U.S.A.) in 3.359 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%, J&K Scientific, Canada). Patterned ITO glass was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co, Ltd. (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential sonication in soap DI water, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min at each step. After ultraviolet/ozone (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, U.S.A.) treatment for 10 min, a ZnO electron transport layer was prepared through spin coating at 4000 rpm from a ZnO precursor solution. Then the ZnO substrates were subsequently baked in air at 200 °C for 30 min. Active layer solutions (D/A ratio = 1:2) with polymer concentrations of 6 mg mL−1 were prepared in ortho dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with 5% (volume fraction) of DIO. Active layers were spin coated in a N2 glovebox at 1000 rpm. A thin layer (5 nm) of MoOx was deposited as the anode interlayer, and 160 nm of Ag was deposited as the top electrode at a vacuum level of below 2.0 × 10−6 mbar. Device J–V characteristics was measured under AM1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport Thermal Oriel 91159A solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated using a Newport Oriel PN 91150 V Si-based solar cell. J–V characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. Typical cells had device areas of approximately 4 mm2. EQEs were performed in air using an Oriel Newport system (Model 66902). Monochromatic light was generated using a Newport 300 W lamp source.
3 Results and discussion
As shown in Table 1, the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements show similar average molecular weights (Mn) of 120 kDa and 123 kDa for PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT, respectively. The high molecular weights are beneficial for efficient charge transport in OFETs and PSCs due to the easy formation of polymer chain networks. The two polymers show good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) of higher than 390 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), a good parameter for potential application in optoelectronic devices.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two polymers in thin films and solution are shown in Fig. 1. The PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT have similar optical absorption due to the similar backbones, and only slight red-shifts are observed in the absorption peaks of PPyTDPP-TT, due to increased conjugation with the thienothiophene moieties. As for the thin films of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT, they both displayed a slightly broader absorption peak and the maximum absorption peaks (λmax) were red-shifted by around 10 nm compared to their solution spectrum, suggesting the formation of effective π–π stacking in the solid state. Additionally, PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT have relatively wide absorption bands at 500–850 nm, which are wider than that of PPyDPP-BT (500–750 nm) due to the extended conjugation.32 The optical bandgaps calculated from the absorption edges of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were 1.53 eV and 1.54 eV, respectively, which are around 0.4 eV lower than that of their symmetric counterparts.28

The HOMO of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were determined to be −5.28 eV and −5.14 eV, respectively by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)35 and the LUMO energy levels of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were estimated to be −3.75 eV and −3.60 eV using the optical bandgaps (shown in Table 1) measured from their thin films absorption onset. Meanwhile, we also performed cyclic voltametry (CV) on the o-dichlorobenzene solutions of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT, and the calculated LUMO levels were −3.55 eV and −3.50 eV for PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT, respectively, which are relatively lower (0.1–0.2 eV) than the values obtained from the combination of UPS and UV-vis, probably due to the differences of their solutions and films. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the LUMO levels of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were enhanced in comparison with that of PPyDPP-BT. Moreover, PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT exhibited narrower bandgaps (∼1.55 eV) than PPyDPP-BT (∼1.91 eV). The appropriate HOMO/LUMO levels of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT combining the narrow bandgaps may enable them to behave as promising ambipolar semi-conductors36,37 towards high performance optoelectronic devices. More detailed physicochemical characteristic information and molecular weights for PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT are summarized in Table 1 and the detailed experimental conditions are included in the ESI.†
Ambipolar transporting properties
In order to investigate the semiconducting properties of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT, top-gate/bottom-contact OFETs were fabricated based on the spin-coated PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT thin films. The representative transfer and output curves of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT-based thin film OFETs are shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, it can be seen that both PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT-OFETs demonstrate ideal field-effect modulating characteristics with typical ambipolar transporting properties even when tested under ambient conditions. The observation of the good electron transport properties of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT is probably due to the relatively deep LUMO levels and the protection of the top PMMA gate, avoiding the environmental influences such as those of H2O and O2. From the transfer curves, the calculated highest saturated electron (μe) and hole mobilities (μh) for PPyTDPP-TT are 0.48 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PPyTDPP-BT demonstrates a hole mobility of 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The difference in charge carrier mobility for PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT is related to the different effects of molecular structures, leading to the different molecular crystallinities and film morphologies, which is also reflected by their PSC performance in the following. Anyway, there will be space for further improving their charge transport properties by optimizing the molecular packing of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT, as indicated by GIXRD results in the following part of structure characterization.

As both electron donors and acceptors in polymer solar cells
Judging from their LUMO/HOMO levels (see Fig. 1) and OFET characteristics (Fig. 2 and Table 2), PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT are verified to be promising ambipolar copolymers with relatively high electron and hole charge carrier mobilites, which might make them suitable as both electron acceptors and donors towards effective PSCs. PSC devices of PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were fabricated using an unconventional conguration of ITO/ZnO/PPyTDPP-TT:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag (where PPyTDPP-TT as the donor materials) and ITO/ZnO/PPyTDPP-BT:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag (where PPyTDPP-BT as the donor materials). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The blend films with different donor/acceptor ratios were systematically adjusted to optimize the device performance. The results demonstrated that the blending thin films of both PPyTDPP-TT:PC71BM and PPyTDPP-BT:PC71BM exhibited the best photovoltaic performance at a 1:2 weight ratio (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI†). The PPyTDPP-TT:PC71BM thin film based PSCs can attain a PCE of 5.48%, with a Voc of 0.820 V, Jsc of 10.8 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.7%. The devices that utilize PPyTDPP-TT as an acceptor, and P3HT as a donor can also attain a PCE of 0.82% and a high Voc of 0.816 V (Table S2, ESI†). The optimized device that uses PPyTDPP-BT as a donor can obtain a PCE of 7.56%, with a Voc of 0.825 V, Jsc of 14.14 mA, and a FF of 64.8%. The devices that employ PPyTDPP-BT as an acceptor, P3HT as a donor can attain a PCE of 0.59% and a high Voc of 0.901 V (Table S2, ESI†). In comparison, PSCs fabricated from PPyDPP-BT provided the best PCE of 4.9% with a Jsc of 9.6 mA cm−2.26 The higher PCE of 7.56% and Jsc of 14.14 mA m−2 for PPyTDPP-BT-based PSCs than that of PPyDPP-BT-based devices is due to its much wider absorption band based on the asymmetric molecular backbone structures. More importantly, both PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT polymers could also be used as the acceptor materials in OPVs, mainly due to their relatively highly balanced ambipolar properties.

Fig. 3 shows the best current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT for the PC71BM system. The enhancement of the absorption coefficient generates the increased Jsc values. A broad and near-unity spectral range of 300–820 nm can be acquired precisely in the EQE results shown in Fig. 3(b). These observations are in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra for these polymers in Fig. 1. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE curve are approximately 13.09 and 9.75 mA cm−2, for PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT-based devices, respectively. For clarity, the detailed device performances for PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT-based OFETs and PSCs are summarized in Table 2. We believe that much higher optoelectronic devices could be further achieved based on such series of PPyTDPP-copolymers by improving the order of degree of intermolecular arrangements and further improvement of molecular design.

Solid state structures and film morphology characterization
In order to investigate the molecular stacking and orientation of the active layer of PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT in devices, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) techniques were applied on the blend polymer films (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4c, the out-of-plane diffraction patterns of PPyTDPP-BT (red line) show primary peaks locating at 2.64 nm−1 and 5.41 nm−1, which are assigned to the diffractions of the (100) and (200) planes. In comparison, only a weak (100) diffraction peak could be observed for PPyTDPP-TT (Fig. 4c, black line), suggesting the relatively higher crystallinity of PPyTDPP-BT than that of PPyTDPP-TT in the solid state films. Moreover, compared with PPyTDPP-TT, PPyTDPP-BT also shows a pronounced π–π stacking peak at 17.4 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction, which facilitates the charge transfer for higher OPV performance. On the other hand, in the in-plane diffraction patterns, very weak (100) and (200) diffractions are also observed for PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT, but without π–π stacking, suggesting mixed molecular packing for them with preferable face-on stacking in the films, which is actually unfavorable for efficient two-dimensional charge transport in the planar OFETs. Thus, there is large space for further improvement of the charge carrier mobility for PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT-based OFETs by optimizing their solid state molecular packing.

To verify the discrepancy of the morphologies of the blend films of PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images are depicted in Fig. 5. PPyTDPP-BT-based blend thin films demonstrated the mixed microstructure morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ∼2.0 nm. In comparison, PPyTDPP-TT-based blend thin films showed a nanostructure surface morphology with around hundreds nanometers of nanoparticles and an increased RMS roughness of ∼2.76 nm. There is no obvious separation between the two components in the blend films, which is beneficial for enlarging the interfacial area for effective charge separation due to the reduced exciton migration to the D–A (donor–acceptor) interface and the enhanced charge separation and collection.

In this work, two new asymmetric thiophene/pyridine flanked DPP based copolymers, PPyTDPP-TT and PPyTDPP-BT were designed and synthesized for achieving ambipolar polymers towards high performance polymer optoelectronic devices. As expected, the two polymers both exhibited the narrow bandgap of ∼1.5 eV with a wide absorption range of 500–850 nm and relatively deep HOMO levels. Studies of OFETs based on PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT thin films showed typical ambipolar charge transport properties with a hole mobility of 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPyTDPP-TT and a hole mobility of 0.48 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPyTDPP-BT, rendering them to both donor and acceptor materials in PSCs. The PCE of PSCs with PPyTDPP-BT and PPyTDPP-TT as donor materials blended with PC71BM as the acceptor can reach values of 7.56% and 5.48%, respectively, while with them as the acceptor materials blended with P3HT, the PCE values can also reach 0.59% and 0.82%, which could be further improved by optimizing the device structures. These results demonstrate that DPP polymers with asymmetry in the flanking aromatic rings are a successful approach towards ambipolar transporting materials for both OFETs and PSCs.
