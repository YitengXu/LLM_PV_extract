    , Accepted 8th March 2018First published on 8th March 2018AbstractWe report the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-enhanced triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) of polymeric acceptors containing high percentages of acceptor units. A poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(glycidyl methacrylate)] copolymer series with increasing glycidyl methacrylate ratio was prepared using reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. After post-modification of the glycidyl group with anthracene, the acceptor unit, a series of poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(2-hydroxypropyl-9-anthroate methacrylate)] (polyACA) was produced with different numbers of acceptor units. These polymeric acceptors were grafted to silver nanoparticles in order to enhance the TTA-UC intensity in the polymers with higher percentages of acceptor units, where concentration quenching usually dominates. With the assistance of the silver nanoparticle LSPR, TTA-UC intensity was enhanced from the polymeric acceptor nanocomposites using platinum octaethylporphyrin as the sensitizer to form the TTA-UC systems. This method is anticipated to improve TTA-UC in the solid-state, where higher percentages of acceptor units are required, but usually cause chromophore concentration quenching, reducing TTA-UC efficiency.
Introduction
Improving the efficiency of solar cells has attracted a wide array of research interests with differing focuses. Since single bandgap photovoltaic cells have a maximum conversion efficiency described by the Shockley–Quisser limit,1,2 much of the focus has been on creating multi-junction, multi-material cells3–5 that can harvest a greater portion of the solar spectrum. Using these strategies, the maximum reported conversion efficiency with power density of one-sun was nearly 40%.3 Further improvements to conversion efficiency could make solar cells better positioned to augment current leading energy sources. Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) has been widely investigated6,7 and proposed as a way to further improve the efficiency of solar cells by integrating TTA-UC into the solar cells to recycle unused photons.8–11
TTA-UC, as depicted in Fig. 1, is a bimolecular process in which two lower energy (longer wavelength) photons are upconverted to a higher energy (shorter wavelength) photon.12–14 The process occurs via Dexter-type energy transfer processes between excited sensitizers and acceptors (TTET), which requires close interactions of one chromophore to another. In triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), two triplet-excited acceptors collide and energy is transferred from one to the other, generating a singlet-excited acceptor. The singlet-excited acceptor subsequently fluoresces an upconverted photon. TTA-UC is highly dependent on the diffusion of the chromophores to one another, as well as fluorescence of the acceptor molecules. Solid-state materials are more practical for application in solar cells, however, TTA-UC is much weaker in solid state than in solution due to the limited mobility and increased phase separation of the chromophores in solid state, which thus requires high concentrations of the chromophores for TTA-UC to occur.15–18 The higher concentrations of chromophores have led to aggregation resulting in concentration quenching and lowered overall upconversion efficiency.
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the energy-level diagram of the TTA-UC process. Upon excitation (Ex), the singlet excited state of the sensitizer (1S*) is populated, where intersystem crossing (ISC) occurs to populate the triplet excited state of the sensitizer (3S*). Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from sensitizer to acceptor populates the triplet excited state of the acceptor (3A*). Subsequently, two 3A* can collide to form a singlet excited state of the acceptor (1A*) and a ground state (GS) acceptor. The 1A* can then fluoresce (F) an upconverted photon. Concentration quenching contributes to the non-radiative decay (nr) of the excited states and incomplete TTET results in phosphorescence (P) of the sensitizer. Solid colored arrows indicate radiative excitation/decay (Ex, P, F), dotted vertical grey arrows indicate non-radiative decay (nr), and dotted black arrows indicate non-radiative energy transfer (ISC, TTET, TTA). For simplicity, the GS of sensitizer and acceptor have the same energy. 
Many recent studies have investigated ways to mitigate concentration quenching and improve TTA-UC intensity in the solid-state by embedding the chromophores in a polymer matrix19–24 or covalently attaching the chromophores to each other,25–27 a polymer backbone,28–31 or a nanoparticle.32–34 These strategies decrease phase separation of the chromophores in the solid state, as well as reduce the need for diffusion. However, a common trend observed in acceptor-modified polymers is the greater concentration quenching associated with increased acceptor ratio, i.e., the higher percentage of acceptor units per polymer chain.28,29
It was recently demonstrated that TTA-UC of a system containing Rose Bengal covalently conjugated to a gold nanoparticle, serving as the sensitizer, generated higher upconversion emission, compared to a corresponding system not containing gold nanoparticles.33 The enhanced TTA-UC was likely attributed to the overlap of the gold plasmon band with the Rose Bengal absorption, providing enhanced plasmon-sensitizer resonance coupling. However, it was not shown in that study whether the emission of acceptor can also be influenced by the plasmonic nanoparticles, as the acceptor was not attached to the gold nanoparticle. Additionally, it is well known that noble metal nanoparticles can enhance the fluorescence of organic fluorophores at the nanoparticle surface, when there is overlap between the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the absorbance of the fluorophore.35–38
With the intention of combining these and other effective strategies, herein we report a proof-of-concept, easily adaptable, polymeric-acceptor nanocomposite system for TTA-UC, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The system relies on metal-enhanced TTA-UC system containing post-modified polymers conjugated to silver nanoparticles serving as acceptors. It will be demonstrated that greater TTA-UC enhancement is observed in systems with higher percentages of acceptor units per polymer.

Experimental
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased at the highest available purity and used as received unless stated otherwise. All solvents, HCl, NaOH, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and trisodium citrate dihydrate were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Silver nitrate (AgNO3), 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (ACA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN), 1-dodecanethiol, anhydrous carbon disulfide, triethylamine (TEA), Aliquot 336, and Tween-20 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and anhydrous sodium sulfate were purchased from Oakwood Chemical. Platinum octaethylporphyrin was purchased from Frontier Scientific. AIBN was recrystallized from ethanol. DDMAT was synthesized according to previously published work,39 and specifics are reported in the ESI.†
Synthesis of poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(glycidyl methacrylate)] (PMMA-co-GMA)
As an example of the synthesis of PMMA-co-GMA, the following is the procedure for the 28% GMA copolymer. A mol ratio of 24/76 GMA to MMA was used in the feed. A round bottom flask was charged with GMA (0.327 mL, 2.40 mmol), MMA (0.809 mL, 7.60 mmol), DDMAT (36.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), AIBN (1.6 mg, 0.01 mmol), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (5.00 mL). The mixture was chilled in an ice bath and purged with nitrogen gas for 15 minutes to remove molecular oxygen, and then cannulated to a microwave reaction flask with septum cap. The mixture was reacted in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 28 minutes under nitrogen pressure. The polymerization was stopped by exposure to air. The polymer solution was condensed and precipitated in cold methanol twice to remove unreacted starting materials. The resulting light yellow solids were air dried, giving 0.3577 g of product. The other copolymers were synthesized in a similar fashion, however with appropriate mol ratios of GMA and MMA, listed in Table S1.†
Synthesis of poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(2-hydroxypropyl-9-anthroate methacrylate)] (polyACA)
Using the ratio of GMA per PMMA-co-GMA polymer and the solid mass, each GMA monomeric unit was treated as one mol equivalent. A representative synthesis of 28% ACA polyACA follows, adapted from Khalafi-Nezhad et al.40 28% GMA PMMA-co-GMA (0.1435 g polymer, 0.35 mmol GMA units), ACA (0.1507 g, 0.70 mmol), TBAB (22.5 mg, 0.07 mmol), TEA (9.73 μL, 0.07 mmol) and sodium sulfate-dried N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (5.00 mL) were added to a microwave reaction vessel. The mixture was reacted in a microwave reactor at 150° C for 25 minutes. The mixture started a light yellow color, but after the reaction, turned a dark orange/brown color. The solution was condensed and precipitated in cold methanol to remove unreacted starting materials. The resulting beige solid polyACA was air dried, resulting in 0.1767 g of product. The other polyACA copolymers were synthesized in a similar fashion, however with appropriate amounts using a mol ratio of 1/2 GMA unit to ACA. The polyACA series was further characterized by 13C NMR, UV-vis, IR, and fluorescence spectroscopies, with data included in the ESI.†
Synthesis of polyACA-grafted silver nanoparticles (Ag@polyACA)
Silver nanoparticles were synthesized following a modified Turkevich method.41,42 Additionally, thiol-terminated polyACA were prepared by reduction of the trithiocarbonate end-group using a NaBH4 reduction method.43 Specifics for these reactions are given in the ESI.† To a portion of prepared silver nanoparticles (5.00 mL), polyACA solution (1.00 mL) was added dropwise, and the mixture was left to stir for four hours. The mixture turned from a transparent yellow color to a slightly turbid yellow/orange solution with a slight sheen. The polyACA solution was prepared with THF to obtain an approximate 5-fold more concentrated solution than the nanoparticle solution, so that upon mixing, an approximate 1/1 mol ratio of polyACA to nanoparticle would be obtained. After the reaction completed, the nanocomposites were centrifuged, washed with 1/1 ultrapure water and THF solution twice, and then the supernatant was replaced with THF.
Instruments and methods
UV-visible absorption spectra were collected with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (USB4000-ISS, Ocean Optics). TTA-UC spectra were obtained using a home-built photoluminescence system described in the ESI.† Fluorescence measurements were taken using a QM-40 spectrometer (PTI) equipped with a photomultiplier tube and a high-performance InGaAs photodiode. Spectra were collected using FelixGX software and analyzed using OriginLab software. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with Si(CH3)4 standard, using a 400 MHz Bruker Ultrashield (100 MHz for 13C) instrument and processed using MestReNova software. FTIR spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with ATR accessory and processed using OMNIC 32 software. TEM micrographs were collected using a Phillip BioTwin 12 TEM and images were processed using ImageJ software. TEM samples were prepared by applying a drop of the aqueous solution (unmodified silver nanoparticles) or a drop of the THF solution (Ag@polyACA nanocomposites) on a carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh, EMS) and let dried.
Spectroscopic measurements
TTA-UC measurements were carried out at ambient temperature. Samples were prepared in septum-capped glass vials. Solutions for each polyACA polymer or Ag@polyACA nanocomposite contained a fixed [ACA unit] = 0.40 mM and [PtOEP] = 10 μM, prepared in THF. Molecular oxygen was purged from the samples by bubbling nitrogen gas through the solutions for 15 minutes. All spectroscopic measurements were taken using a 532 nm laser for excitation, with an acquisition range of 350–750 nm. The upconversion luminescence is displayed between 350–530 nm and PtOEP phosphorescence (shown in the ESI†) is between 550–750 nm.
Fluorescence measurements were carried out at ambient temperature. Samples were prepared in quartz cuvettes. Solutions for each polyACA polymer or Ag@polyACA nanocomposite contained a fixed [ACA unit] = 0.275 mM, prepared in THF. Samples were excited at 380 nm and emission was collected between 390–700 nm.
Results and discussion
Poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(glycidyl methacrylate)] (PMMA-co-GMA) was synthesized with varying monomer ratios using reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization (Scheme 1a). RAFT polymerization was chosen due to its greater control over the molecular weight and end-groups of the resulting polymers. A higher percentage of GMA was incorporated into the copolymers than intended by the feed ratio, probably due to the higher reactivity ratio of GMA compared to MMA. However, the reactivity ratio product (rGMArMMA) is close to one, suggesting the polymerization would occur in a random manner with no composition drift.44 The absence of composition drift is one of the reasons post-modification of the PMMA-co-GMA copolymer with the bulkier anthracene group was used.

The varying monomer ratios allowed for post-modification with 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (ACA) to provide copolymers with the ratios of ACA/MMA similar to the GMA/MMA ratios, ranging from ∼5 to ∼52 mol% of ACA (Table 1). The resulting copolymers are poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(2-hydroxypropyl-9-anthroate methacrylate)] (polyACA).

The post-modification reaction involved the acid-catalyzed ring opening addition of ACA to the glycidyl group (Scheme 1b), which is evident by 1H NMR (Fig. 3). In PMMA-co-GMA copolymers (black trace), five peaks are present (d, d′, e, f, f′), each corresponding to one glycidyl proton. After modification of the epoxide ring with ACA to form polyACA, two peaks are present, one integrates for two protons (f, f′) and the other integrates for three protons (d, d′, e). This pattern would be observed for addition of ACA to the more substituted side of the epoxide ring, as the d and e protons would be fairly similar due to their proximity to carboxyl groups and the f protons would be different, as they would be near the hydroxyl group. The regioselectivity for acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening reactions is addition to the more substituted side of the epoxide.

Due to the nature of the glycidyl group, post-modification of the PMMA-co-GMA copolymers could potentially be done with a variety of acceptors and sensitizers. The only requirement of the chromophore for modification is a nucleophilic moiety for attachment and ring-opening of the glycidyl group. Additionally, upon ring opening, a hydroxyl group is generated, which could be used for attachment of a second molecule or cross-linking of the polymer. These two features make PMMA-co-GMA copolymers a highly adaptable platform for linkage of a variety of chromophores and functionalities for TTA-UC. Both avenues are currently being investigated in our group.
Results of the TTA-UC measurements using the polyACA series, with PtOEP as the sensitizer, are shown in Fig. 4a. Similar to the trend observed previously for anthracene-polymers28 and diphenylanthracene-polymers,30,45 TTA-UC intensity increased for acceptors containing a smaller acceptor ratio in the polymer, and rapidly decreased with increasing acceptor ratio in the polymer, shown in Fig. 4b. The maximum TTA-UC intensity was observed from the polyACA containing 6% ACA. With increasing acceptor ratio in the polymer, there was pronounced concentration quenching of the acceptor fluorescence (Fig. S6†) that caused the steep decrease in TTA-UC intensity.

Excitation power density was 433 mW cm−2. (b) The relationship between the upconversion intensity and ACA ratio for each polyACA. 
In order to mitigate the concentration quenching and enhance the upconverted fluorescence, the polyACA series were bound to silver nanoparticles via terminal thiol groups. The thiol groups were produced by the reduction of the terminal trithiocarbonate groups present from the RAFT chain transfer agent.43 Colloidal silver nanoparticles were synthesized, following the well-known Turkevich method,41,46 and modified with the thiol-terminated polyACA series,42 producing polyACA-grafted silver nanoparticle-core nanocomposites (Ag@polyACA). The stoichiometry of the reaction was set so that an estimated average of one polymer chain per nanoparticle was obtained. The estimated nanoparticle concentration was calculated from mean nanoparticle size and the starting silver nitrate concentration, as described in greater detail in the ESI.† The Ag@polyACA samples were characterized by UV-vis and IR spectroscopies, with results shown in the ESI.† The nanoparticle size distribution was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), also shown in the ESI.†
To determine the fluorescence enhancement, fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on Ag@polyACA samples in THF, shown in Fig. 5a. When compared to polyACA samples at equivalent ACA unit concentration (Fig. 5b), addition of polyACA to the silver nanoparticle resulted in enhanced fluorescence, with the exception of the 10% ACA Ag@polyACA sample with no change in the fluorescence intensity and the 16% ACA Ag@polyACA sample that showed decreased fluorescence intensity. Since the fluorescence intensity is trending down at first, this may indicate that similar to the polymer samples, concentration quenching of fluorescence is dominating as ACA ratio is increasing. The decreased fluorescence from the 16% ACA Ag@polyACA may have occurred due to the proximity of the polymer to the nanoparticle surface. Although it has been demonstrated that noble metal nanoparticles enhance fluorescence of chromophores in close proximity, there is a distance-dependence for the enhancement. It has been reported that fluorescence from chromophores within 5 nm of a nanoparticle surface is quenched and that from chromophores greater than 5 nm from a nanoparticle surface is enhanced.35,37 The 16% ACA Ag@polyACA may be the crossover point where concentration quenching is more pronounced and the ACA units in the polymer are within a distance to the nanoparticle surface where electronic interaction between the ACA and the metal nanoparticle results in non-radiative decay pathways, reducing the fluorescence. In the lower ACA ratio samples, despite the proximity of the polymers to the nanoparticle surface, concentration quenching is reduced and the fluorescence is enhanced. However, even though greater concentration quenching is expected in the Ag@polyACA samples with greater than or equal to 28% ACA ratios, the fluorescence intensity increases with increasing ACA ratio. This indicates that as expected, fluorescence enhancement by the nanoparticle LSPR appears to dominate the concentration quenching. In the higher ACA ratio samples, the polymer is larger and may extend further from the nanoparticle surface, reducing non-radiative decay and permitting enhanced fluorescence.
 Fig. 5  (a) Direct fluorescence emission (excited at 380 nm) of the Ag@polyACA samples with specified ACA ratio: 5% ACA (black), 6% ACA (red), 10% ACA (green), 16% ACA (blue), 28% ACA (cyan), 40% ACA (magenta), and 52% ACA (yellow). (b) The fluorescence emission intensity related to the ACA ratio in Ag@polyACA samples (red) compared to polyACA samples (black). 
Results of the TTA-UC measurements of Ag@polyACA samples, with PtOEP as the sensitizer, are shown in Fig. 6a. The nanocomposite with the maximal upconversion was 10% ACA Ag@polyACA. The general trend for the upconversion intensity of 10% and higher ACA Ag@polyACA samples, shown in Fig. 6b, followed that of direct fluorescence measurements (Fig. 5b). Note that the upconversion intensity in the samples with higher ACA ratio was generally enhanced by the presence of the silver nanoparticle, albeit not significantly enhanced according to a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. However, the upconversion intensities from 5% and 6% ACA Ag@polyACA were significantly quenched. Since TTA-UC is a diffusion-dependent process, intermolecular TTA-UC of the nanocomposite system is likely reduced since the entire nanoparticle would have to diffuse to one another for ACA units on different polymers to interact. In the samples with lower ACA ratio, the distance may be too great between acceptor units in the same polymer chain in order for the intramolecular TTA-UC to occur as significantly as the samples with higher ACA ratio. In these cases, the LSPR enhancement of the TTA-UC intensity may not be sufficient to compensate for the fewer TTA events occurring.
 Fig. 6  (a) TTA-UC of the Ag@polyACA series with specified ACA ratio: 5% ACA (black), 6% ACA (red), 10% ACA (green), 16% ACA (blue), 28% ACA (cyan), 40% ACA (magenta), and 52% ACA (yellow). Excitation power density was 433 mW cm−2. (b) The TTA-UC intensity related to the ACA ratio in Ag@polyACA samples (red) compared to polyACA samples (black). 
A double logarithmic plot of the TTA-UC intensity for both acceptor systems as a function of the excitation power density (Fig. S4†) showed a transition from a slope of ∼2 to a slope of ∼1, which is indicative of the TTA-UC mechanism. The transition point from the quadratic trend to the linear trend, termed intensity threshold (Ith), is a figure of merit indicating the efficiency of the TTA-UC system.47 The Ith for 10% ACA Ag@polyACA and 10% ACA polyACA were compared since those two acceptors gave nearly identical TTA-UC intensity at high excitation power densities. The Ith for 10% ACA Ag@polyACA was smaller than that for 10% ACA polyACA, indicating a more efficient TTA-UC process with decreasing excitation power densities. This finding supports the LSPR enhancement of TTA-UC. In addition to an increase in the efficiency of the TTA-UC, the phosphorescence of the PtOEP also increased in the presence of the silver nanoparticles. This increase is likely due to spin–orbit coupling between the silver and the PtOEP, enhancing the formation of triplet states. A comparison of the TTA-UC quantum yields (QY) for the two acceptor systems, shown in Fig. S3,† further supports the LSPR enhancement of TTA-UC. It can be seen that at higher ACA ratio, the presence of the silver nanoparticles increases the TTA-UC QY. The QY value is nearly doubled at 52% ACA Ag@polyACA compared to 52% ACA polyACA.
Conclusions
In summary, we report the LSPR-assisted enhancement of TTA-UC, where polymers with different acceptor ratio were grafted onto plasmonic silver nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that the emission of acceptor can be influenced by the plasmonic nanoparticles. Plasmonic enhancement increases with increasing acceptor ratio per polymer, which would improve TTA-UC in the forthcoming solid state investigations, where high acceptor ratios are required and self-quenching need be avoided. Furthermore, we report an easily adaptable polymer platform for covalent attachment of a variety of TTA-UC relevant chromophores. As these chromophores are generally bulky, direct polymerization of chromophore monomers is usually more sluggish and difficult to control. The described post-modification method would allow for use of a variety of functionalities with monomeric ratios controlled by stoichiometry. The end-groups of the polymer can also be controlled through the RAFT process, which can be used for grafting to a variety of surfaces. This strategy is of great potential to create a wide range of polymer composite materials that could give insight into improvements for the TTA-UC process.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Illustration of the energy-level diagram of the TTA-UC process. Upon excitation (Ex), the singlet excited state of the sensitizer (1S*) is populated, where intersystem crossing (ISC) occurs to populate the triplet excited state of the sensitizer (3S*). Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from sensitizer to acceptor populates the triplet excited state of the acceptor (3A*). Subsequently, two 3A* can collide to form a singlet excited state of the acceptor (1A*) and a ground state (GS) acceptor. The 1A* can then fluoresce (F) an upconverted photon. Concentration quenching contributes to the non-radiative decay (nr) of the excited states and incomplete TTET results in phosphorescence (P) of the sensitizer. Solid colored arrows indicate radiative excitation/decay (Ex, P, F), dotted vertical grey arrows indicate non-radiative decay (nr), and dotted black arrows indicate non-radiative energy transfer (ISC, TTET, TTA). For simplicity, the GS of sensitizer and acceptor have the same energy.
