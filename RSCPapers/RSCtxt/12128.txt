    , Accepted 27th August 2015First published on 31st August 2015AbstractA series of donor–acceptor type of conjugated polymers were designed and synthesized via palladium catalyzed Stille copolymerization. These copolymers consisted of the electron-donating benzodithiophene or indacenodithiophene units and the electron-deficient cyclic imide substituted quinoxaline derivatives. It was noted that all copolymers exhibited typical dual-absorption characteristics in both solution and as thin films with an optical band gap in the range of 1.61–1.72 eV. In comparison with the copolymers based on the electron-deficient unit of 5,9-di(thien-2-yl)-2,3-diphenyl-7-octyl-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione (TPQD) as the electron-accepting unit, the resultant copolymers based on the enlarged coplanar N-octyl-10,13-di(thien-2-yl)-2,7-dioctyldibenzo[a,c]phenazine-11,12-dicarboxylic imide (TBPDI) unit exhibited an obviously enhanced absorption coefficiency. All polymers showed relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels ranging from −5.40 to −5.52 eV. It was also realized that the hole mobility of copolymers based on TBPDI is much higher than those based on the TPQD unit as measured by the space charge limited current method. Polymer solar cells with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al demonstrated that TBPDI-based copolymers exhibited higher performances than TPQD-based copolymers. The best device performance with a power conversion efficiency of 4.60% was achieved by using the indacenodithiophene-alt-TBPDI copolymer as the photoactive layer. Further optimization of devices by introducing a cathode interfacial layer and solvent vapor annealing in chloroform led to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 5.58%. These observations indicated that the developed TBPDI unit that has enlarged coplanarity can be a promising building block for the construction of highly efficient conjugated polymers for solar cell applications.
Introduction
Over the past two decades, bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their specific advantages such as light-weight, flexibility and potential mass production on the basis of the low-cost roll-to-roll process.1 The BHJ photoactive layer typically consists of blends of a conjugated polymer as the electron-donor and a fullerene derivative as the electron-acceptor. With the long-term exploration and unremitting efforts of researchers, an encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% has recently been achieved by single-junction devices.2 It is well-established that the design and synthesis of novel donor materials has played a crucial role in the development of PSCs, where the ideal electron-donating conjugated polymers are supposed to have a low optical band-gap to attain excellent sunlight harvesting, a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to maximize the open-circuit voltage, an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level to effectively split the excitons, as well as a high hole mobility to allow for efficient charge transport.1c,3 To address these requirements, electron-donating polymeric materials are typically designed by using an alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) architecture in the backbone, wherein the hybridization of molecular orbitals offers facilely tunable band-gaps and energy levels.1g,4 In this respect, large quantities of D–A type of conjugated polymers have been developed and have exhibited excellent photovoltaic performances by carefully choosing an electron-rich unit, such as indacenodithiophene (IDT), dithienosilole (DTS), benzodithiophene (BDT), etc. and an electron-deficient unit such as benzothiadiazole (BT), benzotriazole (BTA), quinoxaline (Qx), etc.1d,5
As a widely used electron-deficient species for constructing D–A conjugated polymers, much attention has been attracted by the quinoxaline moiety owing to the strong electronegativity of the two nitrogen atoms.6 For example, Hou and coworkers designed and synthesized a [bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene]-alt-[bis(2-thienyl)-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline] copolymer that exhibited a PCE of 5.0%.7 Wang et al. reported a D–A type of low band-gap polymer based on thiophene as the electron-donating unit and quinoxaline as the electron-accepting unit, named poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl], which exhibited an impressive PCE of 6.0% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.5 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 64%.8 Chen and coworkers reported a fluorinated quinoxaline-based conjugated polymer by using benzodithiophene derivatives as the electron-donor, and a comparatively high PCE of 8.0% has been attained by adding 1,8-diiodooctane as the solvent additive.9
Recently, the cyclic-imide fused benzodiathiazole unit has emerged as an electron-deficient unit for the construction of narrow band-gap conjugated polymers. The introduction of the electron-withdrawing cyclic imide can simultaneously decrease both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers,10 and the N atom on the imide can offer a straightforward opportunity toward the alkylation of the imide unit that can enable good solubility of the resultant polymers. Very recently, Wang et al. reported an electron-deficient cyclic imide fused quinoxaline unit, 5,9-di(thiophen-2-yl)-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione (PQD), which was copolymerized with the electron-donating BDT unit to give the D–A type of conjugated polymers with a relatively high PCE of 4.9%.11
With the motivation of developing new semiconducting polymers based on the cyclic imide fused quinoxaline unit for PSC applications, here we designed and synthesized a series of D–A copolymers. These copolymers consisted of the electron-rich units of benzodithiophene (BDT) and indacenodiathiophene (IDT) as the electron-donating species,12 and the electron-deficient units of the cyclic imide fused quinoxaline (TPQD) or, with its two phenyl rings covalently connected, dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (TBPDI) as the electron-accepting species. It was supposed that the enlarged coplanarity of TBPDI can be favorable for its molecular packing due to the inhibition of the rotation of the two pendent phenyl units. The PSC devices using the TBPDI-alt-IDT-based alternating copolymer (P4) exhibit a maximum PCE of 5.58% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 10.73 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 56.48%.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomers and copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. 4,6-Di(thien-2-yl)-thieno[3,4-c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (1), benzil (1′), 2,7-dioctyl-9,10-phenanthraquinone (2′), 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (9) and 2,7-bis(trimethyltin)-4,9-dihydro-4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (10) were prepared according to the reported procedures.13–17 4,7-Di(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylate (2) was prepared via the Diels–Alder reaction of compound 1 with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate in xylenes. The hydrolysis of compound 2 in ethanol gave 4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic acid (3), which was then converted to the intermediate compound 4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride (4) by means of intramolecular dehydration reaction in the presence of acetic anhydride. The alkylation of compound 4 with octylamine gave N-octyl-4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic imide (5), which was then reduced by iron powder to give the compound N-octyl-4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-5,6-diamino-isoindoline-1,3-dione (6). It is worth mentioning that our initial efforts of integrating compound 6 with 9,10-phenanthraquinone unexpectedly gave the product with comparatively poor solubility that cannot be purified for the following polymerizations. Therefore, in order to improve the solubility of the target compound, we tried to incorporate two octyl substituents into the 2,7-positions of 9,10-phenanthraquinone. The synthesis was carried out by aromatic condensation of compound 6 with 1′ and 2′ in acetic acid, which led to compounds 5,9-di(thien-2-yl)-2,3-diphenyl-7-octyl-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione (7) and N-octyl-10,13-di(thien-2-yl)-2,7-dioctyldibenzo[a,c]phenazine-11,12-dicarboxylic imide (8) in good yields, respectively. Then the target monomers of 5,9-di(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,3-diphenyl-7-octyl-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione (Br2-TPQD) and N-octyl-10,13-di(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,7-dioctyldibenzo[a,c]phenazine-11,12-dicarboxylic imide (Br2-TBPDI) were synthesized in good yields through the bromination of compounds 7 and 8 by using N-bromosuccimide (NBS), respectively.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of monomers and polymers. 
The target D–A type of conjugated copolymers, P1–P4, was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille copolymerization of monomer TPQD or TBPDI with monomer 9 or 10. The resulting copolymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction by successively using methanol, acetone and n-hexane as the eluent to remove the small molecular weight fractions and catalyst residues. The molecular structures of all intermediates, monomers and copolymers were verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see the ESI†). The resulting copolymers can be readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as toluene, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of copolymers were estimated by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene as the standard. The Mn of P1, P2, P3, and P4 are 15.4, 22.7, 11.7, and 17.8 kDa, respectively, with the corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) in the range of 2.2–3.7.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were utilized to evaluate thermal properties of the resulting copolymers. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, copolymers P1, P2, P3, and P4 exhibited the decomposition temperatures (defined as the 5% weight-loss temperature, Td) of 289, 389, 437, and 459 °C, respectively, indicating their excellent thermal stabilities. However, no discernible thermal transition was realized by DSC analysis in the scanning range from 100 to 300 °C (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Detailed data of the molecular weight and thermal properties of these copolymers are summarized in Table 1.

Optical properties
The UV–vis absorption spectra of all copolymers in toluene solution with a concentration of 1 × 10−5 mg mL−1 and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2. All copolymers exhibited dual absorption profiles corresponding to the typical features of the donor–acceptor type copolymers based on quinoxaline,18 where the maximum absorbance was observed at a short wavelength that can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, and the relatively weak absorbance peaked at a longer wavelength can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects from the donor to the acceptor.19 As shown in Fig. 2a, copolymers P1 and P2 showed the ICT peaks at 551 and 580 nm, respectively in toluene solution. In contrast, since the connection of the ortho positions of two substituted pendent phenyl rings in quinoxaline units through a covalent bond leads to significantly enlarged coplanar-moieties18c in copolymers P3 and P4, thereby two such ICT peaks distinctly bathochromically shifted to 575 and 623 nm, respectively. It is also recognized that the absorption co-efficiency of P3 is slightly higher than that of P1, and a similar trend is also observed for copolymers P4 and P2, illustrating the increased light-harvesting ability of a single polymer chain of TBPDI-based polymers with respect to those of TPQD-based counterparts.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in toluene solution (1 × 10−5 mg mL−1) (a) and as thin films (b). 
As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the absorption peaks of all copolymers as thin films at a longer wavelength obviously red-shifted relative to those in solution, demonstrating the increased intermolecular interactions in the solid state. We noted that the maximum absorption (λmax) of P4 at the lower energy band exhibited a bathochromic shift of ∼50 nm relative to that of P2, which can be ascribed to the enlarged planarity of the TBPDI unit that can lead to an improved stacking motif. In contrast, we also noted an unanticipated hypsochromic shift with λmax of the low energy band absorption from 612 nm for P1 to 602 nm for P3, along with the hypsochromic shift of the absorption onset from 775 nm for P1 to 721 nm for P3. This fact can be understood by the significant steric hindrance, which originated from the incorporated 2-octyl substitutions in the TBPDI units and the branched side alkyl chains that are tethered in the side thiophene units of the BDT units. The existence of such unexpected steric hindrance would impede the close stacking of the molecular chains,17 and in turn lead to a hypsochromic shift of the absorbance of P3. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of copolymers as estimated from the absorption onset in film are in the range of 1.61–1.72 eV. Detailed results of the optical properties are summarized in Table 2.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to evaluate the frontier molecular orbitals of the resulting conjugated copolymers, with the corresponding electrochemical characteristics of copolymers shown in Fig. 3. The measurements were carried out in a tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) solution (0.1 M in acetonitrile) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, by using Ag/AgCl and a platinum wire as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. An ITO glass electrode coated with thin copolymer films was used as the working electrode. The onset of oxidation potential (Eox) of P1, P2, P3 and P4 referred to ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was determined to be 0.66, 0.60, 0.68 and 0.72 V, respectively. Assuming that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV under vacuum, thus the corresponding calculated HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) can be calculated according to the equation: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) eV. The calculated EHOMO was −5.46, −5.40, −5.48 and −5.52 eV for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively. When considering that the Voc is proportional to the gap between the EHOMO of the electron donors and the ELUMO of the electron acceptors, the relatively high Voc can be expected due to the deep EHOMO of these copolymers.20 The onset of reduction potential (Ered) referred to Fc/Fc+ was determined to be −1.09, −1.22, −1.17 and −1.06 V for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively. According to the equation: ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) eV, the LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) are calculated to be −3.71, −3.58, −3.63 and −3.74 eV for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively. Detailed electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2.

Theoretical calculations
In order to further understand the molecular orbital geometry and electrical properties of the polymers, we carried out the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on model compounds of the donor–acceptor repeating units of the resulting copolymers at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level by using the Gaussian 09 package.21 The repeating units of copolymers P1, P2, P3 and P4 are denoted as M1, M2, M3 and M4, respectively. Note that the alkyl side chains in these repeating units are replaced by a methyl group to simplify the calculation.5h,i The calculated frontier molecular orbitals are illustrated in Fig. 4. The LUMOs are predominantly located at the electron-deficient TPQD and TBPDI units, while the HOMOs are mainly located at the electron-donating BDT and IDT units. The comparison of the calculated molecular orbitals of M1 and M3 reveals that the covalent connection of the ortho positions of two substituted pendent phenyl rings in quinoxaline units did not significantly disturb the HOMO levels, while the LUMO levels obviously decreased from −2.75 eV to −2.94 eV, indicating the improved electron affinity of the TBPDI based copolymer P3 compared to P1. The combinations of the nearly unchanged HOMO levels along with the decreased LUMO are supposed to result in reduced HOMO → LUMO band gaps from 2.95 eV for M1 to 2.05 eV for M3. However, it is not consistent with the observations of UV-vis absorption and CV measurements. This may be due to the fact that the DFT calculation assumed ideal conditions, while the significantly enlarged coplanarity of TBPDI may potentially have steric hindrance with the adjacent thiophene substituents in the BDT units.

On the other hand, for compounds M2 and M4 that comprise IDT as the electron-donating unit, the HOMO was primarily located at the IDT unit, while the LUMO was primarily located at the electron-deficient unit. We noted that both HOMO and LUMO levels obviously decreased after the covalent connection of the two phenyl-substituents of the quinoxaline unit, while the more pronounced decrease in LUMO from −2.54 eV to −2.94 eV led to a reduced HOMO → LUMO band gap. This observation was in good agreement with the CV results.
Hole mobility
As the charge carrier mobility across the cell plays a key role in the device performance of polymer solar cell devices,22 we fabricate a hole-only device with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al to investigate the hole transport properties of the copolymers blended with PC71BM in an optimized weight ratio of 1:3 (wt:wt). The hole mobilities were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, with the corresponding characteristics shown in Fig. 5. The hole mobility was calculated by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which is described by the equation: JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εrμ0(V2/L3), where J is the current, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The hole mobilities of P1, P2, P3, and P4 calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves were 8.35 × 10−5, 1.39 × 10−4, 2.23 × 10−4 and 4.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is worth noting that the hole mobilities of P3 and P4 based on the enlarged electron-deficient TBPDI unit were higher than those of P1 and P2 based on the TPQD unit, respectively, illustrating that the enlarged coplanarity of the electron-deficient TBPDI unit was due to a more effective charge carrier transport unit.

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of these resulting copolymers, we fabricated polymer solar cell devices with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The photoactive layer was spin-coated from an o-dichlorobenzene solution with a pre-optimized copolymer:PC71BM weight ratio of 1:3 (wt:wt) and a film thickness of about 90 nm. All devices were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 6 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3.

It was noted that all devices based on these copolymers exhibited a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78–0.92 V, which was in good agreement with the deep EHOMO of these copolymers. The device based on P1 consisting of a two-phenyl substituted quinoxaline (TPQD) moiety as the electron-deficient unit showed a moderate PCE of 1.86% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.96 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 35.54%. In contrast, the device using copolymer P3 comprising the electron-deficient unit of dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (TBPDI) as the photoactive layer, exhibited a dramatically improved PCE of 3.38% by virtue of the simultaneously increased Jsc of 8.30 mA cm−2 and FF of 45.79%. It is worth pointing out that despite the absorbance of P3 exhibits a slightly hypsochromic shift compared to that of P1, the obviously enhanced absorption coefficiency can allow for more efficient harvesting of sunlight, which is beneficial for the achievement of a higher short circuit current. The distinctly increased Jsc can also be correlated with the enhanced hole mobility of P3 relative to P1 as confirmed by SCLC measurements.
A similar trend of the improvement in device performances by using TBPDI as the electron-deficient unit was also realized for devices based on copolymers containing IDT as the electron-rich unit. As shown in Table 3, the device based on P4 exhibited an impressive PCE of 4.60% (Voc = 0.91 V, Jsc = 9.59 mA cm−2 and FF = 52.74%), which was much higher than 2.25% for copolymer P2 (Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc = 8.07 mA cm−2 and FF = 35.70%). The obviously increased performance of copolymer P4 can also be attributed to the enhanced hole mobility across the photoactive layer along with the well-extended absorbance that can enable more efficient light-harvesting properties. We note that the fill factors for devices based on P1, P2, and P3 are relatively low, which can be correlated with the comparatively low mobility of these polymers as evaluated by the SCLC method, or the formation of unfavorable phase separation (see Fig. 7) that can lead to the accumulation of charge carriers and cause increased non-geminate recombination.6a,23 The device based on P4 was optimized by the incorporation of a thin layer (∼5 nm) of poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN), which has been proven to be an effective cathode interlayer that can facilitate charge collection.24 It was observed that the PCE of the device can be improved to 5.07% as a result of the concurrently increased Jsc of 10.32 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.94%. Further optimization of the device performance was carried out by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) using chloroform before the deposition of the interfacial layer and cathode, which has been widely used as the effective strategy to facilitate the formation of a more favorable phase separation.25 After the photoactive layer was treated by SVA for 60 seconds, we indeed noted the increased PCE of 5.58% with simultaneously increased parameters of Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 10.73 mA cm−2 and FF = 56.48%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest PCEs of the donor–acceptor type of conjugated polymers based on dibenzo[a,c]phenazine derivatives as the electron-deficient unit.

Morphology
Insight into the surface topography of the bulk heterojunction copolymer:PC71BM blend films was provided by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the blend films of copolymer:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:3 were spin-coated on the top of the prefabricated PEDOT:PSS layer under exactly the same conditions as those for the solar cell devices. From Fig. 7 one can observe that the blend films based on copolymers P1 (Fig. 7a) and P2 (Fig. 7b) comprising the electron-deficient TPQD moiety exhibited comparatively smooth topography with root mean square (RMS) values of 0.71 and 0.57 nm, respectively. In contrast, the blend films based on P3 and P4 consisting of TBPDI exhibited a slightly rougher surface topography. It can be clearly seen that the blend film based on P3 exhibited nanoscale fibrous textures across the entire film (Fig. 7c) while the blend film based on P4 exhibited spherical features with a size of 60 ± 15 nm (Fig. 7d). After treating the blend film of P4:PC71BM by chloroform vapor annealing for 60 s, one can observe that the surface morphology can indeed be modified with the emergence of slightly enlarged granular characteristics (Fig. 7e).
Further morphology characterization of polymer:PC71BM blend films was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which is illustrated in Fig. 7(f–j). It was noted that blend films of P1:PC71BM (Fig. 7f), P2:PC71BM (Fig. 7g) and P3:PC71BM (Fig. 7h) did not show distinctive features. This unfavorable phase separation cannot provide effective pathways for charge carrier transport, which may lead to the accumulation of charge carriers and ultimately increased non-geminate recombination that is detrimental to fill factors.6a,23 In contrast, the blend films based on copolymers P4:PC71BM exhibited distinct interpenetrating features (Fig. 7i), which was more pronounced after solvent annealing with chloroform for 60 s (Fig. 7j). Note that this interpenetrating fibrous feature is favorable for charge transport in the photoactive layer, which can lead to an increased short circuit current and a decreased probability of non-geminating recombination.26 These observations are in excellent agreement with the significantly increased short circuit current along with the enhanced fill factors.
Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a series of donor–acceptor type of conjugated copolymers based on the electron-donating benzodithiophene or indacenodithiophene units and the electron-deficient cyclic imide substituted quinoxaline derivatives via Stille polymerization. It was noted that the copolymers comprising the enlarged electron-deficient TBPDI unit exhibited an obviously enhanced absorption coefficiency along with an increased hole mobility with respect to their TPQD-based polymer counterparts, leading to the obviously improved photovoltaic performances of the former. The champion power conversion efficiency of 4.60% was obtained by the solar cell device on the basis of the copolymer indacenodithiophene-alt-TBPDI (P4) as the photoactive layer. Further optimization of the solar cell device based on P4 by using a water/alcohol interlayer and solvent vapor annealing resulted in a much higher power conversion efficiency of 5.58%. These observations demonstrated the great potential of using the TBPDI unit as the building block for the construction of conjugated polymers for highly efficient photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
Measurement and characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker-400 spectrometer operating at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, in a deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K. Chemical shifts were reported as the δ value (ppm) relative to an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard. The number-average molecular weights (Mn), weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of copolymers were determined at 150 °C by using a PL-GPC 220 type in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using a calibration curve with standard polystyrene as a reference. Differential scan calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Netzsch DSC 204 under N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a cooling rate of 20 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Netzsch TG 209 in nitrogen, with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded on a CHI 660A electrochemical workstation. CV was performed in a solution of tetrabutyl-ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) in acetonitrile, using Ag/AgCl and a platinum wire as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. An ITO glass electrode coated with a thin copolymer film was used as the working electrode. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument (Elementar Co.). Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NanoScope NS3A system (Digital Instrument) or a Bruker Muitimode 8 system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2100F instrument.
Solar cell device fabrication and characterization
The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. Then a hole transport thin layer (∼40 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated on the precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 5000 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 15 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into an argon-filled glove-box. Subsequently, the BHJ composite with a thickness of approximately 90 nm was then spin coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer from a solution of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) of polymer and PC71BM (polymer:PC71BM = 1:3, w:w). Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) was carried out by dropping 100 μL CHCl3 around the as-cast BHJ layer and covering with a Petri dish in a way that the film is exposed to the CHCl3 atmosphere for 60 s. Finally, a bi-layer cathode structure of Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) or PFN (5 nm)/Al (80 nm) was deposited on top of the polymer:PC71BM layer. The cathode metals were deposited in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 3 × 10−6 mbar. The thin layer of PFN (∼5 nm) was spin-coated from a methanol solution in the presence of a trace amount of acetic acid, and was pumped under vacuum overnight before deposition of Al. The area of the Al electrode defined the active area of the device as 0.0516 cm2.
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G spectrum from a class solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1). The light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 as calibrated by using an NREL certified reference monocrystal silicon cell (Hamamatsu).
Fabrication and characterization of hole-only devices
The SCLC method was used to estimate the hole mobility of polymers in the BHJ composite with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (wt:wt = 1:3)/MoO3/Al. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-cast onto the pre-cleaned ITO glass followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into an argon-filled glove-box. Subsequently, the BHJ composite films were prepared on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates using the same method as that for solar cell device fabrication. Finally, MoO3 (∼10 nm) and Al (∼80 nm) were sequentially thermally deposited on the top of the active layer in a vacuum system.
