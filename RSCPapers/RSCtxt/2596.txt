    , Accepted 10th November 2022First published on 12th November 2022AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-area sunlight collectors, and they are able to reduce the cost of electricity and are suitable for application in building integrated photovoltaics. The key factor determining the optical efficiency of the LSC is the optical properties of the fluorophores. Among various types of fluorophores, carbon quantum dots (C-dots) have attracted great attention because of their size/shape/composition dependent optical properties and high stability. Although LSCs based on C-dots have been reported recently, it is still a big challenge to produce highly-bright cost-effective C-dots on a large-scale via a simple approach for efficient LSC fabrication. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent-free heating method using metal salts as dehydrating agents to produce C-dots in a large-quantity (100 gram per batch). The as-prepared C-dots have a typical absorption ranging from 300 to 500 nm, a large Stokes shift of 0.73 eV, a quantum yield (QY) as high as 70% and a small absorption/emission spectral overlap. The metal cation can not only contribute to the dehydration of the precursors, but also cap the C-dot surface by forming a stable structure, leading to a strong absorption peak at 405 nm and a large Stokes shift because of the intermediate energy states. Compared to Cu, Fe, Mg, Al, and Sr cations, Ca2+/Ba2+ capped C-dots exhibited the highest QY because of the efficient surface passivation. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricated the laminated LSCs using the as-obtained C-dots as fluorophores. The optimized LSC based on C-dots produced using BaCl2 or CaCl2 exhibits an external optical efficiency as high as 3.2% with a lateral size of 100 cm2. These results indicate that the solvent-free heating method can provide high-quality C-dots as building blocks for potential LSC applications.
1. Introduction
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-scale sunlight collectors, and can absorb sunlight and convert solar energy into concentrated fluorescence. By coupling solar cells at the edges of the LSCs, the emissions can be converted into electricity. Compared to photovoltaic (PV) devices, the LSCs could decrease the cost of electricity when the external optical efficiency (ηopt, the power ratio between the power at the edges and the surface of the LSCs) of the LSCs is higher than 6.5%.1 A typical LSC consists of an optical waveguide integrated with luminescent materials.2–5 Benefiting from their transparent or semitransparent properties, they could be widely used as building integrated PVs (BIPVs).6–8 Nowadays the large obstacle prohibiting the commercial applications of the LSCs is their low ηopt values and the cost of the fluorophores. The key factor affecting the optical efficiency and the cost of the LSCs is the optical properties of the luminescent materials, which should have broad absorption matching well with the Sun's spectrum, high quantum yield (QY), and small overlap between their absorption and emission spectra and can be produced via a simple and cost-effective method.6,7 To date, various types of luminescent materials have been used as building blocks for LSCs.4,6,7,9–19 Compared to traditional dyes/polymers, colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have attracted a lot of attention because of their size/shape/composition dependent optical properties.5,20 Among several types of QDs that have been reported as fluorophores for LSC applications, carbon quantum dots (C-dots) exhibit great potential for LSCs because C-dots have high QY, containing mainly C/N/O elements without heavy-metals and they can be synthesized using relatively low-cost precursors and mild reaction conditions.4,16,21–32 During the last five years, several groups have reported efficient LSCs based on C-dots.4,16,21–24,26–32 For example, Gong's group first produced nitrogen-doped C-dot based LSCs.16 Zhao et al. developed an LSC (15 × 15 × 0.5 cm3) with an ηopt value of 2.2% under natural light irradiation of 60 mW cm−2.32 Cai et al. reported boric acid-functionalized graphene QD based LSCs (10 × 10 × 0.63cm3), exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.4%.33 Guo et al. reported LSCs (5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3) having an ηopt value of 3.1% by using yellow-color C-dots, which have a QY of 98% and a large Stokes shift.34 In their reaction, they used an organic solvent (toluene), which is toxic and not cost-effective.34
For LSC applications, a large-scale reaction is required for producing high-quality C-dots. Hydrothermal, solvothermal, and microwave methods have been used to produce high-quality C-dots, however, it is a challenge to produce in a large-scale reaction considering the large-sized autoclave and microwave reactor.35–38 Recently, a solid-state reaction has been used for the production of high-quality C-dots.39–41 In such a reaction, C-dots can be produced without using any kind of solvent. For example, Ding et al. reported the synthesis of C-dots using o-phenylenediamine with the catalysis of KCl.41 Zhang et al. synthesized C-dots by utilizing the dehydration self-carbonation effect of the HSO3 group in 3,4-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid.40 However, the above-mentioned precursors are still relatively expensive and toxic compared to citric acid (CA) and urea, which are widely used precursors for C-dot production.34,42 While it is still a challenge to synthesize high-quality C-dots on a large scale using CA and urea.
Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient LSC based on metal cation-capped C-dots synthesized using a solvent-free heating approach. We are able to produce ∼100 grams of C-dots per batch using calcium citrate or citric acid/CaCl2 in the presence of urea without using any solvents. The as-prepared C-dots have an absorption spectrum ranging from 300 to 500 nm with high QYs ranging from 37 to 70% depending on the type of metal cations (e.g. Ca, Ba, Mn, Al, and Mg). As a proof-of-concept, we fabricated LSCs using the as-prepared C-dots. The laminated LSC (100 cm2) based on C-dots produced by Ca2+ or Ba2+ exhibits the highest ηopt values of 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively, under sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2).
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Citric acid monohydrate, calcium citrate (CaCA), magnesium citrate (MgCA), copper citrate (CuCA), ferric citrate (FeCA), sodium citrate (NaCA), urea, calcium chloride, cesium chloride, barium chloride, manganese chloride, potassium chloride, aluminum chloride, dichloromethane, ethanol, and methanol were all purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used directly without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of C-dots
C-dots were synthesized via a solvent-free heating approach. Typically, a mixture containing 5 g of CA and 10 g of urea were ground with a mortar and pestle for 10 min. Subsequently, the mixed powder was transferred into a beaker, and heated to 200 °C in an oven. After kept the mixture at 200 °C for 1 h, the beaker was taken from the oven and cooled down to 25 °C naturally. A similar method was used to produce C-dots using the metal citrate as a precursor by replacing CA with an equal molar of metal citrate. For the synthesis of C-dots using metal chloride, typically, 5 g of CA, 10 g of urea and 5 g of metal chloride (e.g. MgCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, BaCl2, MnCl2, KCl, AlCl3) were mixed and ground fully. Then the mixture was heated to 200 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C. The reaction temperature was maintained at 200 °C for 1 h. The slurry was naturally cooled down to 25 °C.
For the large-scale synthesis of C-dots using CaCA/urea or CA/urea/CaCl2 (or other metal chlorides) as precursors, 200 g of CA/200 g of CaCl2 (BaCl2) or 520 g of CaCA were mixed with 400 g of urea and used for the production of C-dots. Other reaction parameters (200 °C, 1 h) were kept identical as mentioned above. After mixing the precursors, the mixture was firstly ground in a grinding mortar and then the obtained white powder was transferred to a 500 mL glass beaker for the reaction. After the reaction (200 °C, 1h), the beaker was taken from the oven and the mixture was cooled down to 25 °C naturally. Then the powder was collected.
2.3. Purification
The as-produced powder was ground first and then dispersed in water/ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 1:1. The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected. The supernatant was further purified using silica gel column chromatography.43 In detail, the chromatographic silica gel was placed in the column, and then a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane (volume ratio of 1:1) was used as an eluent. The C-dots mixture in water/ethanol was added into the chromatography column. The methanol was further added into the column. The collected mixture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min and the obtained supernatant was freeze-dried and the yellow powder was collected and kept at 4 °C for further characterization and use in LSC fabrication.
2.4. LSC fabrication
The C-dot powder was dispersed in methanol solution (5 mg mL−1, 10 mL) was mixed with 1 g of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) K30 and 0.5 g of PVP K90.32 After stirring the mixture for 30 min, the mixture was sonicated for 10 min. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 g to avoid any bubbles and undissolved polymers. The as-obtained yellow solution (10 mL) was poured on pre-cleaned glass (10 × 10 × 0.4 cm3). After casting, the uniformed thin film was formed after 4 h of drying at room temperature. For the preparation of laminated LSCs, two glass slides with the same thickness of PVP/C-dots layer were attached together and kept for 12 h with 1 kg weight.25
2.5. Characterization
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) characterization of the C-dots was carried out using a JEOL 2100F TEM assisted with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Absorption spectra were acquired with a Lambda 750 UV/visible Spectrometer (PerkinElmer). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out for C-dots using an AXIS Supra photoelectron spectrometer. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) characterization of the C-dots were performed on an Edinburgh FLS1000 instrument. The QYs of the C-dots were measured using an integrating sphere. The refractive index of glass and the PVP film was measured using a WAY-2S Albert refractometer (INEA).
For a typical measurement, an epoxy glue was used to attach four commercial silicon solar cells on the edges of the LSC. The ηopt values of the LSCs were measured by using a solar simulator at AM 1.5G (100 mW cm2, Newport). The power meter (Newport Model 843-R) was directly coupled to the edge of the LSC. The calibrated PV cell (Zolix QE-B1) was used to measure the PCE of the LSCs. Typically, a commercial silicon solar cell (a JSC of 33 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.609 mV, a fill factor of 0.76 and a PCE of 15%) was attached on four edges of the LSC and the current density was collected upon natural sunlight illumination (Noon, Qingdao, China). The light intensity was measured by using a commercial calibrated Zolix QE-B1 solar cell. To avoid any light from directly diffusing into the solar cells, the unattached parts of the solar cells were covered by black tape. To avoid the side-effect of the solar cell on the efficiency of the LSC, we also measured the dark current of the solar cell.44 When we calculated the PCE of the LSC, we used the obtained power from the edges to deduce the coupled solar cells.44
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and structure of C-dots
Many approaches have been used to produce C-dots using CA and urea as precursors, such as vacuum-heating and hydrothermal methods.33,34,46 While these methods still need to use solvents, in this work, we used a solvent-free heating method using CA/metal citrate and urea as precursors using metal salts as dehydrating agents including Fe3+, Al3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Mn2+ and K+. The metal citrate precursors have been used for the synthesis of C-dots.42 However, in their synthesis, they used water as a solvent assisted with microwave heating, the as-obtained C-dots have a low QY (less than 30%).42 Compared to CA or NaCA, the divalent or trivalent metal cation (may form a more stable complex with urea (Fig. 1a), which might contribute to the dehydration of the precursors.44 For comparison, we also used the CA/urea as the precursor, but added a metal chloride (e.g. MgCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, BaCl2, MnCl2, AlCl3) as the dehydration agent, as the metal chloride could serve as a linker between CO(O−) and the NH2 group (Fig. 1b). The typical reaction process is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The white mixed precursors were changed to black after heating at 200 °C for 1 h. By dispersing the slurry in water/ethanol solution, a brown colour solution was obtained after purification. Upon illumination at 400 nm, a clear green light can be seen, indicating the successful preparation of C-dots (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The reaction can be easily scaled up by 40 times (Fig. S2, ESI†). For example, using 200 g of CA/400 g of urea and 200 g of CaCl2, we are able to obtain ∼150 g of C-dots with a reaction yield of 25%. Using 520 g of CaCA/400 g of urea, we are able to obtain ∼100 g of C-dots with a reaction yield of 11%. The low reaction yield using CaCA may be due to the shorter diffusion distance of the CaCA compared to CA during a solvent-free reaction. By only considering the cost of the chemicals, we calculate the price of the C-dots, which is as low as 0.08 $ per g (Table S1, ESI†). This low cost of as-prepared C-dots endows the large-scale use of C-dots for LSC and other optoelectronic applications.

As shown in Fig. 1c–e, all C-dots produced via a solvent-free heating approach exhibit a quasi-spherical shape with a size between 3 and 6 nm. A high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image is shown in Fig. 1f. The measured d spacing is around 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of the hexagonal graphene structure, which was further confirmed by SAED patterns (Fig. S3, ESI†). XPS was further used to measure the chemical composition of the C-dots using different precursors. All samples consist of C/N/O elements. Based on the high resolution C1s and N1s spectra, all QDs have CN and CO groups (Fig. S4, ESI†). The peak located at 248.8 eV was assigned to the C–C/CC groups and the peak located at 288.2–288.8 eV was assigned to the CO/C–O groups (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile FT-IR measurement also confirmed the presence of CN and CO groups in the C-dots produced by CaCA (Fig. S5, ESI†). The presence of the Ca cation in the C-dots was proved by XPS analysis (Fig. S6, ESI†). The Ca content in the CaCA sample (3%) is less than that in the CA/CaCl2 sample (5%), indicating that the C-dots were capped with a Ca cation through the interaction between CO and Ca2+ as reported previously.43
3.2. Optical properties of C-dots
As shown in Fig. 2a, all C-dots have an absorption spectrum ranging from 300 to 500 nm with an absorption peak located at 405 nm. There is a strong absorption peak located at 310 nm for the sample prepared at 160 °C (Fig. 2a), originating from the molecular-like structure.44 The intensity of this peak (310 nm) becomes weaker for the reaction temperature higher than 200 °C, indicating the good carbonization of the C-dots.45 All C-dots exhibited relatively narrow PL spectra with a PL peak position of ∼520 nm (Fig. 2b and Fig. S7, ESI†). The large Stokes shift of 0.67 eV indicates that the C-dots prepared via a solvent-free reaction present a great potential for LSC application.32,47 The QYs of the C-dots are among 18–65%, depending on the type of precursors used in the synthesis. For example, the Ca cation capped C-dots have the QYs of 65 ± 5% (CA/CaCl2) and 57 ± 5% (CaCA), which are higher than those of C-dots produced by using CA (25%), NaCA (30%), MgCA (47%), FeCA (40%) and CuCA (18%). The high QY is comparable to those reported using vacuum heating and a hydrothermal approach.43,45 Consistently, the Ca capped C-dots have longer lifetimes (16.5 ns of CA/CaCl2 and 15.7 ns of CaCA) compared to the C-dots produced using CA (4.3 ns) or NaCA (12.1 ns). The long lifetime is consistent with their high QYs. The as-synthesized Ca capped C-dots shows robust stability, which shows no significant variation in PL spectra and PL intensity after six-month storage at 4 °C.
 Fig. 2  Absorption (a), PL spectra (b) and PL decay curves (c) of C-dots synthesized using different precursors. The excitation wavelength is λex = 400 nm and the C-dots were dispersed in methanol for all measurements. 
Based on the above data, we also synthesized a series of C-dots using metal chloride as a dehydrating agent by keeping all other reaction parameters the same. As seen in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and Fig. 3a, using different metal chlorides, the as-prepared C-dots showed a similar absorption range and have an excitation independent PL emission. The PL peak covers from 510 to 540 nm by using different cations, which could be due to the different metal cation capping and the different carbonization degrees as the different metal cations have different interactions with urea and CA. The Al3+ capped C-dots have a PL peak centered at ∼510 nm and the Mn2+ capped C-dots have a PL peak centered at ∼540 nm, which are also due to the different carbonization degrees. In addition, Ba2+ capped C-dots showed a highest QY of 70 ± 5%, which is much higher than other bivalent cations (Fig. 3b). As the QY of the C-dots depends on the core carbonization degree, the surface functional groups and the interaction between the functional groups and cations.43 The C-dots produced using single and trivalent cations showed a much lower QY, indicating that they cannot interact well with the surface functional groups of the C-dots, leading to trap-state assisted nonradiative decay (Fig. 3c) as we also detected trap-state related absorption even they are quite weak (Fig. S9, ESI†). For bivalent cations, it is quite possible that the Ca and Ba cations offer better surface passivation compared to Mg/Sr/Mn cations. In fact, we further optimised the reaction temperature and reaction time, which would affect the carbonization degree of the C-dots, and found that the Mn capped C-dots have a QY of 60% (220 °C, 1 h), which indicates that the higher temperature improves the carbonization degree of the C-dots, thus restrict the defects inside the core region. We summarized the absorption and PL mechanism in C-dots produced using a solvent-free reaction. The initially formed molecular-like structure is gradually transformed into C-dots with the help of metal cations, which serve as dehydration agents. Some of the metal cations might interact with the CO group, contributing to a stable absorption state located at 405 nm.43 Because of the different capping abilities, the QY varies significantly among the C-dots capped with different cations. Typically, the optical properties of the C-dots strongly depend on their core size/composition and their surface functional groups.42 Compared to inorganic semiconductors,48,49 the C-dots exhibited molecular-like behaviors. Thus, we still use the LUMO and HOMO for their energy structures as shown in Fig. 3c. The Stokes shift of the C-dots is small if the recombination of the e–h pair is through the bandgap (Fig. 3c, left), while the Stokes shift could be large if the e–h pair recombines through the surface energy states as shown in Fig. 3c, middle. Large Stokes shift in semiconductors might be due to the self-trapped exciton or the electron delocalization.48,49 In our case, the metal cation capped C-dots might have a stable intermedium surface energy state, contributing to a large Stokes shift.32 Depending on the type of cation, the traps could be formed during the synthesis process, which serve as a recombination center (Fig. 3c, right), leading to a low QY of the C-dots.

3.3. Fabrication and efficiency of LSCs based on C-dots.
The optical efficiency of the LSCs is dominantly dependent on three factors: (i) the absorption of the fluorophores which can absorb part of the sunlight; (ii) the QY of the fluorophores; and (iii) the Stokes shift of the C-dots. As the real LSC could be as large as several square meters, the reabsorption because of the spectral overlap between the absorption and emission will largely decrease the optical efficiency of the LSC. Compared to the small Stokes shift in C-dots produced using solvent,35,38 the currently prepared C-dots have a large Stokes shift and high QY, which is suitable as a fluorophore for high efficiency LSCs. In this work, a thin layer of C-dots/PVP methanol solution was drop-cast on a glass substrate (10 × 10 × 0.4 cm3) with a thickness of 300 μm (Fig. S10, ESI†). Attaching two identical C-dots/PVP glass substrates forms a laminated LSC (Fig. 4a). The PVP polymer can be dispersed in methanol and many researchers have reported the use of PVP for LSC preparation.22 The typical geometrical factor (G, the ratio of the surface area to the area of four edges) for the laminated LSC is around 2.9 and the G value of the single-layer LSC is 5.8. The as-prepared LSCs are semi-transparent as we can clearly see the words on the bottom of the LSC (Fig. 4b–f). Upon one sun illumination, a clear concentrated green light can be seen from the edges (Fig. 4b–f), indicating the successful fabrication of LSCs.
 Fig. 4  (a) Scheme of a laminated LSC. Photographs of the LSC based on C-dots synthesized using different precursors: (b) CA; (c) NaCA; (d) CaCA; (e) CA/CaCl2 and (f) NaCA under one sun (100 mW cm−2) (b–e) and ambient (f) illumination. LSC dimensions, 10 × 10 × 0.86 cm3. (g) PL spectra recorded at different optical paths for C-dot based LSCs: top, CA/CaCl2; bottom, CaCA. The excitation wavelength is 400 nm. 
Because the PL spectrum of the LSC is strongly sensitive to reabsorption,13 the PL signals from the LSC were recorded at a certain distance between the edge and a vertically illuminated spot at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm to predict the absorption effect in the LSCs. In the measured L (1–7 cm), there is a very slight spectral variation as a function of the optical paths (Fig. 4g). Compared to the LSC based on CA/CaCl2, the LSC based on CaCA exhibited a very slight spectral red-shift (Fig. 4g bottom). In fact, we found that the C-dots produced in a solvent-free reaction have a relatively larger Stokes shift compared to the C-dots produced using a solvothermal reaction.35,38 This is due to the localized reaction in the solid-state, leading to a narrow size distribution. By carefully controlling the concentration of C-dots in the PVP methanol solution, the LSC based on C-dots produced by using different types of precursors have an absorption ranging from 300 to 500 nm, absorbing 10% portion of the solar energy (Fig. 5a and b). We measured the ηopt value of the LSC by directly coupling a power meter at the edge of the LSC. For all of the measurements, the LSC (dimension: 10 × 10 × 0.86 cm3) was illuminated perpendicular to its surface by sunlight (100 mW cm−2, April, noon, Qingdao, China). ηopt can be calculated as:1,48  where Pout is the power intensity of the LSC on the edge, Pin is the power intensity of the LSC on the surface under direct illumination, Aedge is the area of the edges of the LSC, ALSC is the area of the top of the LSC and G is 2.9 for the laminated LSC and 5.8 for the single-layer LSC. Under the same measurement conditions, the laminated LSCs based on C-dots exhibit ηopt values of 0.7 ± 0.05%, 1.1 ± 0.05%, 2.2 ± 0.1% and 2.9 ± 0.05%, using CA, NaCA, CaCA and CA/CaCl2 as precursors, respectively. For the single-layer LSC (10 × 10 × 0.43 cm3, G of 5.8) based on C-dots (CaCA), ηopt reaches 2 ± 0.05%. The obtained ηopt value is comparable with those reported for the LSCs based on C-dots with a similar G factor and dimension.16,30,33,34 To further predict the potential ηopt in LSCs based on C-dots, we calculated ηopt using the methods reported in the literature.10 The ηopt of the LSCs can be expressed as:10ηopt =ηAbs·ηintervalwhere ηAbs is the absorption efficiency of the LSC and ηinternal is the internal quantum efficiency of the LSC. The detailed calculation was included in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5c, the ηopt values of LSCs using C-dots drop exponentially with the increase of length. When the length of the LSC is longer than 30 cm, the ηopt value drops to 3%, which is mainly due to the reabsorption effect as the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of the C-dots, even the Stokes shift, is large. And this reabsorption effect is pronounced for large-scale LSCs. The theoretical ηopt value is larger than that of the measured ηopt value of the LSCs (Fig. 5c), which might be due to the uneven surface of the C-dots/PVP film.

(d) J–V response of silicon PVs attached on the edge of the LSCs under the natural sunlight (50–100 mW cm−2). 
The PCE of the LSCs was measured by using a commercial silicon PV with a JSC of 33 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.609 mV, a fill factor of 0.76 and a PCE of 15%. The J–V curves of the LSCs based on C-dots are shown in Fig. 5d. The LSC based on C-dots (CA/CaCl2) exhibited PCEs of 1.7% (natural sunlight, 50 mW cm−2) and 1.3% (natural sunlight, 100 mW cm−2). For the LSCs based on other types of C-dots, upon natural sunlight (100 mW cm−2), the LSC exhibits PCEs of 1.1% (CaCA), 0.5% (NaCA) and 0.3% (CA), respectively. We keep the LSCs based on C-dots produced by CaCA and CA/CaCl2 under ambient conditions, and the LSC still maintains 100% of its ηopt after 2 months. We further also fabricated the LSC based on the Mn2+ or Ba2+ capped C-dots (Fig. 6a, b and Fig. S11, ESI†). The LSC based on Ba2+ capped C-dots has an external optical efficiency of 3.2% ± 0.1%, which is higher than that of the Mn2+ capped C-dots (2% ± 0.1%). Meanwhile by illuminating the LSCs in natural sunlight (Sep. 2022, noon, China, 50 mW cm−2), the LSCs exhibited PCEs of 1.9% ± 0.1% (Ba2+) and 1.0% ± 0.1% (Mn2+). Even though the obtained efficiency is still over 6.5%, we still demonstrated an efficient LSC based on low-cost C-dots. Further improving the efficiency of the LSCs is still possible by optimizing the composition of the C-dots and the surface capping cations.

We further measured the photostability of the LSCs by exposing LSCs to a UV lamp (500 mW cm−2) in outdoor environments (25 °C, humidity of 40%). After 1 h of illumination, there is no notable PL peak position variation observed for all LSCs, and the integrated PL area gradually decreases to 88%, 95%, 96% and 94% of its initial value for the LSCs based on C-dots produced by using CA + CaCl2, CaCA, NaCA and CA, respectively (Fig. 7a–c and Fig. S12, ESI†). These results indicate that the as-fabricated C-dots/PVP based LSCs have good photostability in outdoor environments.

4. Conclusions and perspectives
We demonstrated a solvent-free heating approach for the large-scale production of C-dots over one hundred grams of C-dots per batch with a QY as high as 70%. Compared to other cations, Ca/Ba capped C-dots exhibited much higher QYs because of the efficient surface passivation. The as-produced C-dots have broad absorption from 300 to 500 nm with a large Stokes shift of 0.73 eV, benefiting from the improved surface passivation by metal cations. C-dots/PVP based laminated LSCs (100 cm2) exhibit an ηopt of as high as 3.2% under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) and a PCE of 1.9% under natural sunlight illumination (50 mW cm−2). In view of the simple synthesis procedure, low cost and excellent optical properties, the C-dots produced by a solvent-free reaction represent a practical emitter for large-area, high efficiency LSCs and could be promising candidates for other types of optoelectronic devices.
