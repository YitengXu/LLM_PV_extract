    , Accepted 29th September 2021First published on 30th September 2021AbstractThiophene substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) is widely used as the building block of promising donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). Fluorination on the lateral-chain thiophenes of BDT-T is a considerable strategy to further improve the performance of BDT-T based small molecule (SM) donors. However, how lateral-chain thiophene fluorination affects the morphology and hole mobility (μh) of SM donors has not been well understood. In the present work, we systematically study the effects of the positions and numbers of fluorinations on the morphology and μh of a promising SM donor named DRTB-T (referred as 0F) via multiscale simulations. We find that the crystallinity of DRTB-T is weakened because of fluorination. Face-on configurations are dominated in 0F and 1F-substituted molecules. In contrast, edge-on configurations are dominated in 2F-substituted molecules. The trend of μhs in these fluorinated molecules is consistent with that of the proportions of face-on configurations, and matches well with the available experimental results. We find that functionalizing the lateral-chain thiophenes of side BDT-Ts (1F-side) or all BDT-Ts (1F-all) with only one F atom is efficient to fine-tune the morphologies and μh of DRTB-T based SM donors simultaneously.
1. Introduction
Exciting progresses have been made in the research field of organic solar cells (OSCs) in recent years, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has been up to 18% by combining polymer donors and non-fullerene small molecule (SM) acceptors.1–4 Compared to polymers, SMs have a well-defined structure, high purity, and good reproducibility for mass production.5–10 Hence, all SM OSCs based on both SM donors and acceptors have received considerable attention.5–10 For SM acceptors, until five years ago, the most popular acceptors in OSCs were fullerene and their derivatives because they possess strong electron affinity and high electron mobility.11,12 However, fullerene materials have intrinsic disadvantages such as weak and narrow photo absorption, poor adjustability of energy levels, and easy aggregation, which greatly limit the development of fullerene-based OSCs. Therefore, researchers developed non-fullerene SM acceptors, especially the fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) such as Y6 and ITIC, which show advantages such as tunable energy levels, near-infrared absorption, and low energy loss.13–16 Thus, all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs based on both SM donors and non-fullerene SM acceptors may be promising candidates of new-generation high performance OSCs.8,10,17–23
To date, the highest PCE of binary ASM OSCs has reached 15.8%,24 but it is still lower than that of polymer-based OSCs (∼18%).1–4 Because the potential of the best non-fullerene FREAs has been proved in the high efficiency polymer-based OSCs, for ASM OSCs, the main task now is to improve available SM donor materials or find new promising SM donors. The latter is always hard if going over the development history of OSCs. Hence, improving the available SM donors is an efficient and useful way. So far, the most popular building block of promising donor materials including SMs and polymers is benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT). Owing to its rigid and planar conjugated structure, the donor with a BDT unit as the core of backbone generally has tunable molecular energy levels and energy gaps as well as high hole mobilities.25,26
To further improve the donors with BDT units, researchers have functionalized BDT with two lateral-chain thiophenes to improve charge delocalization from one to two dimensions and introduced more active sites for molecular modification.26 Actually, most of the efficient donor materials have thiophene substituted BDT (BDT-T) as a core building block, instead of just BDT. On the other hand, as one of the simple and efficient strategies of molecular engineering, fluorination can downshift the molecular energy level, enhance intermolecular interaction, and tune blend the morphology of the active layer.27–29 Hence, fluorinations on the lateral-chain thiophenes of BDT-T have been tested, and several impressive experimental progresses have been made. To date, fluorinated BDT-T can be found in the high-performance polymer donors such as D181 and PM6.30 Also, it has been introduced into many promising SM donors, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S1. For instance, Zhu et al.31 synthesized a new donor material named BSFTR by using fluorinated BDT-T as an electron-donating moiety; the PCE of the OSC based on BSFTR (donor: D) and the well-known non-fullerene acceptor Y6 (acceptor: A) reached 13.7%.14,17 By carefully controlling the number of fluorination on one lateral-chain thiophene of BDT-T of a SM donor DCAO3TBDTT, Ge et al. synthesized two new molecules named BTEC-1F and BTEC-2F; they found that the PCEs of SM OSCs increase with the number of substituted F atoms on the BDT-T unit, that is, BTEC-2F > BTEC-1F > DCAO3TBDTT, and the PCE is up to 13.34%.18 Besides, Yang et al. designed an asymmetric C-shaped SM donor named TBD-S4 with a fluorinated BDT-T unit. A remarkable PCE of 15.1% was obtained when incorporating TBD-S4 into Y6.32 Very recently, Qiu et al. synthesized a new donor named DRTB-FT by fluorinating the lateral-chain thiophene of the center BDT-T unit of DRTB-T; interestingly, the highest PCE (7.66%) of the DRTB-FT (D): F-2Cl (A) OSC is much lower than that (10.76%) based on the prototype molecule DRTB-T.33,34 Clearly, fluorination on BDT-T core units of SM donors does not always increase the PCE of an OSC. Therefore, one question that arises here is how fluorination on the core BDT-T unit of the donor affects its performance.
Until now, there are rare studies on the relations between lateral-chain thiophene fluorination of the BDT-T core and the performance of BDT-T based SM donors. Especially, how lateral-chain thiophene fluorination affects morphology, which is crucial but hard to study by experiments, is still not well understood. To shed some light on this issue, in this article, we choose a promising SM donor named DRTB-T designed by Hou et al.7 as an example to study the effects of lateral-chain thiophene fluorination of the BDT-T unit on morphology and hole mobility. DRTB-T contains three repeated BDT-Ts as donor units, end-capping with two 2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinones (rhodanines) as acceptor units. The structure of DRTB-T provides us abundant active sites to explore the effects of different numbers and positions of fluorinations. In addition, the highest PCE of ASM OSCs based on the DRTB-T donor is up to 11.24%.35 This further motivates us to choose DRTB-T to perform this study. Hence, we design a series of fluorinated DRTB-T derivatives by changing the positions and numbers of the lateral-chain thiophene fluorinations on the core BDT-T units, and comprehensively investigate their molecular stacking and hole mobility by means of multiscale simulations.
By functionalizing the lateral-chain thiophenes of three BDT-Ts of DRTB-T with fluorine atoms, we have modelled six molecules, namely: 1F-center, 1F-side, 1F-all, 2F-center, 2F-side, and 2F-all, as shown in Fig. 1. Here, “1” or “2” means the number of F atoms substituted on each lateral-chain thiophene, and “center” or “side” denotes the center or both side positions of the fluorinated thiophene ring, respectively. Plus, “all” means that all lateral-chain thiophene rings of three BDT-T units are fluorinated. The prototype DRTB-T is referred to as “0F,” hereafter for consistency and clarity.

Because classical molecule dynamics (CMD) simulation has been successfully applied for obtaining the details of morphology of organic photovoltaic materials,36–39 we use it to investigate the molecular packing of DRTB-T and its fluorinated derivatives in amorphous forms. Then, quantum chemical calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (KMC)40,41 are utilized to obtain the hole mobility in thin films of these materials.
The purposes of this project are two-fold:
(1) To study the effects of the positions and numbers of fluorinations of the lateral-chain thiophenes of the core BDT-T units on the morphology of these donors.
(2) To gain an insight about the relationship between fluorination and hole mobility.
2. Computational details
MD simulations
All CMD simulations were run with GROMACS 5.1.3 software package,42 and all quantum chemical calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 Rev. E01 package.43 The general AMBER force field (GAFF)44,45 was used to accomplish CMD simulations, and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charge was utilized for atomic charge.46 The combination of GAFF and RESP charges has been widely applied to simulate organic molecules.36–38 The RESP charge, frontier molecular orbital (FMO), and electrostatic potential (ESP) on the van del Waals surface were obtained by using the Multiwfn Rev 3.7 program47–49 based on the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory, which has been proved capable to well reproduce experimental structures.50,51 The torsion potential parameters between the side alkyl chain and the backbone and between the BDT-T and the ending group were re-parameterized via DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S2. To simulate the molecular packing in amorphous films, all CMD simulations were performed with the following procedures: (1) 400 molecules were put into a large cubic box (50 nm × 50 nm × 50 nm) to make sure that these molecules orientate randomly; (2) 2000 steps of energy minimization based on the steepest descent method were run to remove undesired forces and structural distortion; (3) 5 ns simulation under 500 K and 100 bar were performed to close the gaps between these molecules; (4) 10 ns simulation under 500 K and 1 bar, and then cooling down to 300 K gradually in 5 ns to simulate the experimental thermal annealing (TA) process; (5) 20 ns simulation at 300 K and 1 bar to obtain an equilibrated system. The size of the final box is about 11 nm, corresponding to the density around 1150 kg m−3, which is in the reasonable density range (1100–1150 kg m−3).37 All simulations were performed under 3D periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) by using a leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1.0 fs. The cut-off of van der Waals interactions, short-range electrostatic interactions, and the particle-mesh Ewald solver for long-range electrostatic interactions were set to 1.2 nm. The velocity rescaling thermostat52 and the Berendsen barostat53 were used except for the last 10 ns simulation in step 5, in which the Nosé–Hoover thermostat54,55 and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat56 were utilized to gain better equilibrium systems.36–38 In addition, the NPT ensemble was used in all CMD simulations. After the last 10 ns simulation, an additional 30 ps simulation was added, and we sampled every 30 fs for the statistics of the radical distribution functions (RDFs) and torsion angles.
Hole mobility calculations
We selected the hopping model57 to obtain hole mobility because the reorganization energies in our modelled systems are generally larger than electronic coupling. In the low-field limit, hole mobility can be obtained with the Einstein formula:58 (1)Here, D is the charge diffusion coefficient, and it is defined as the ratio of the square of a displacement to diffusion time: (2)where ‘n’ means the n-dimensional system, and r(t) is the diffusion displacement. Thus, we need to calculate the slope of r(t)2 and t for hole mobility. A kinetic Monte Carlo simulation was run to mimic the hole hopping process in the amorphous films, which were obtained from the previous CMD simulations. For the details of the KMC simulation processes, please see our previous work.59,60 For all molecular pairs in KMC simulations, we treated the center-of-mass (COM) of each molecule as the hopping point. Initially, one molecule (i) was randomly selected in the CMD simulation box. Then, a hole transfers between molecule i and its adjacent molecule (j). The probability of this charge hopping is defined as , in which kij is the hopping rate from molecule i to j and can be obtained with the semi-classical Marcus formula:61 (3)where Vij denotes the electronic coupling of the molecular pair (the ith and jth molecules), and was obtained with the Zerner's intermediate neglect of the differential overlap (ZINDO) method;62 ℏ and kB are the reduced Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively; T means the absolute temperature and was set to 298.15 K; ΔGij represents the free energy difference of hole transfer between the ith and jth molecules, and was set to zero in our calculations; λ denotes the reorganization energy and here we only considered the inner reorganization energy. We calculated the reorganization energy of hole transfer with the following equation:63 (4)Here,  is the total energy of the neutral molecule with the optimized geometry of the charged/neutral molecule; correspondingly,  denotes the total energy of the charged molecule with the optimized geometry of the neutral/charged molecule, respectively. The hopping time and distance are defined as 1/kij and the molecular COM(i)–COM(j) distance, respectively. For each hopping step, if  (r: a random number between 0 and 1), then the hole is allowed to move from molecule i to the ath adjacent molecule j. This procedure was repeated by the next hopping step starting from this molecule. To end, the hopping coordinate and time were utilized to build the relationship between r(t)2 and t to obtain the charge diffusion coefficient.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular structure of monomers
We first discuss the effect of fluorination on the physical properties of modeled SM donors, including the FMO energy level, ESP, dipole moment, and molecular planarity. The figures and energy levels of FMOs are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S3. As expected, the HOMO and LUMO energies of fluorinated SM donors are downshifted and energy gaps (Egs) are slightly widened with respect to prototype 0F. The decrease of HOMO energy can improve the VOC of OSCs, but may lessen the driving force for hole transfer at the donor–acceptor interface. Therefore, it is hard to make a judgement for the change of performance of the OSCs based on these fluorinated donors by simply comparing FMOs.
Next, the ESP distributions on the van der Waals surfaces are presented in Fig. 2a as they are essential to explore the molecular stacking in amorphous forms. For 0F, the ESP on three BDT-T units is slightly negative, and the range is around −8 to 0 kcal mol−1. Besides, the highest ESP is located at the joint area between side BDT-T and the terminal acceptor unit, and is up to 18.3 kcal mol−1. In contrast, the ESP minimum (−29.9 kcal mol−1) locates on one nitrogen atom of the terminal acceptor unit. For fluorinated molecules, because of the strong electronegativity of the fluorine atom, the fluorination on the lateral-chain thiophene can increase the ESP of the entire molecule. Hence, the surface area with positive ESP increases with more fluorinations (see Fig. 2b). Overall, the averaged ESP of all fluorinated molecules has the following order: 1F-all > 2F-all > 1F-side > 2F-side > 2F-center > 1F-center > 0F. Due to the small atomic radius of fluorine and its lone pair electrons, it seems that more fluorinations (from 1F- to 2F-substitutions) do not always increase the averaged ESP.
 Fig. 2  (a) Electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of seven modeled molecules. (b) The percent of area with ESP in a specific region. (c) Dipole moments and the estimated backbone bending of seven molecules. 
For center-fluorinated molecules (1F-center and 2F-center), all F atoms locate on the same side of molecule planes (see Fig. 2a). However, for the side-fluorinated molecules (1F-side and 2F-side), the F atoms locate on both sides (the front and reverse sides) equally. These different orientations of lateral-chain thiophenes after fluorinations have effects on dipole moments. The differences between the numbers of F atoms on the front and the reverse sides of molecular planes are 0/2/0/2/4/0/4 for 0F/1F-center/1F-side/1F-all/2F-center/2F-side/2F-all, respectively. These unbalanced distributions of F atoms on two sides of molecular planes would increase the dipole moments and molecular backbone bending. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2c, the dipole moments of 0F, 1F-side, and 2F-side with balanced fluorinations are quite small, and they are 0.33, 0.47, and 0.55 D, respectively. Generally, the dipole moments of 2F-substituted molecules are about twice those of a 1F-substituted molecule, except for 1F-side and 2F-side, which have balanced F distributions. Besides, due to the unbalanced distribution of F atoms and different numbers and positions of F substitutions, the backbone bending of the center-fluorinated molecules is stronger than that of the side- or all-fluorinated molecules, as shown in Fig. 2c (the estimation method of backbone bending is given in the ESI,† Fig. S4).
3.2 Molecular packing in amorphous films
Now we switch to the results of molecular dynamics simulations. First, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the COM of the donor unit (three BDT-T units only, excluding alkyl chains) are given in Fig. 3a. The sharp peaks of donor–donor RDFs at ca. ∼0.54–0.58 nm denote the parallel backbone π–π stacking along molecular long axes with the inter-planar distance at ∼0.36–0.42 nm. This is in good agreement with the experimental results of 0F (0.36 nm) based on grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements.35 On the other hand, the values (<1.5) of RDFs of ending groups (see the ESI,† Fig. S5) are much smaller than those of donor units, indicating that the acceptor–acceptor stacking is not dominant in amorphous forms. This finding is different from the previous MD simulation results of the A–D–A type of FREA ITIC, in which the terminal A–A stacking is dominant.36
 Fig. 3  (a) COM RDFs of donor units (three-BDT-T units without alkyl chains) of seven molecules in amorphous films. (b) The number of pairs per donor unit as a function of donor–donor COM distance. 
In Fig. 3a, 0F shows the strongest RDF peak at 0.54 nm with a shoulder peak at 0.60 nm, demonstrating the best crystallization among all simulated molecules. Besides, 1F-side also shows the second strongest RDF peak at 0.56 nm, but without obvious shoulder peak. Though the RDF peak of 1F-all is not so strong as both of 0F and 1F-sides, its larger RDF value between 0.45 and 0.50 nm demonstrates that its crystallization is not bad too. Compared to other molecules, the RDF peak of 2F-all is clearly lower than others. In addition, the numbers of pairs (Npairs) of donor units as the function of the COM distance between two donor parts of two adjacent molecules are shown in Fig. 3b. When the distance cut-off is about 0.70 nm (the first valley of RDFs), the Npairs of all fluorinated molecules are smaller than that of 0F. Hence, we can conclude that the crystallinity of DRTB-T is weakened by fluorination. For 1F substitutions, the Npair of 1F-all is similar to that of 1F-side, and 1F-center shows the smallest Npair among 1F-substituted molecules, implying its worst crystallization among all 1F-substituted molecules. For 2F substitutions, the trend of Npairs is different, and the order is 2F-side > 2F-center > 2F-all. Notably, for the same substitution positions, the Npairs of 2F-substituted molecules are smaller than those of 1F-substituted molecules, indicating worse crystallinity with more fluorinations. This can be attributed to the repulsion between negative charges on F atoms (see Fig. 2) and the increased torsion angles (ESI,† Fig. S6) between lateral-chain thiophenes and BDTs in 2F-substituted molecules, which can greatly impede the backbone π–π stacking. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S6, for 0F and 1F-substituted molecules, the dihedral angles between lateral-chain thiophene and BDT unit mainly distribute at around 57°. But for 2F-substituted molecules, they increase to around 65° due to the Coulomb repulsion between the negative ESP around fluorine and sulfur atoms. Obviously, functionalizing the lateral-chain thiophene of BDT-T with two F atoms would enlarge the torsion angles between lateral-chain thiophene and BDT. Furthermore, the Npairs of 1F-center/2F-center are smaller than those of 1F-side/2F-side, respectively. This can be attributed to the unbalanced ESP and large backbone bending of center-substituted molecules (see Fig. 2), which hinder the backbone π–π stacking between adjacent molecules.
To obtain more detailed analyses for amorphous forms studied in the present work, we characterize the dimer configurations formed by two neighboring molecules with three parameters: the COM distance between two molecular backbones (d), the dihedral angle between two molecular planes (φ), and the angle between the molecular long axes (θ), as schematized in Fig. 4a. The density contour maps of d–φ and φ–θ in seven final MD boxes are presented in Fig. 4d. Note that we do not draw the density for d > 2.5 nm because it is very low. By carefully analyzing the d, φ, and θ of all molecular pairs (the bimolecular systems with the shortest atomic distances between two molecular backbones less than 0.5 nm are defined as pairs) in the final simulated box,38 we find five representative types of dimer configurations. The structures and classifications of these configurations A–E are given in Fig. 4b. The typical configuration A (d around 0.6 nm and both θ and φ < 20°) generally has the strongest parallel π–π stacking between backbones along long axes. The configuration B (d around 1.2 nm and both θ and φ < 20°) has less intermolecular overlapping along the long axes than configuration A. For configurations C and D, their θ and φ are larger (>20° but <45°) so that the d (1.3–2.1 nm) is longer than those in A and B configurations. The θ and φ of configuration E are larger than 60° and the d is longer than 1.5 nm. Overall, according to the value of φ, the dimers can be roughly classified into face-on (φ < 45°) and edge-on (φ > 45°) configurations. Therefore, we approximately classify the molecular pairs, B, C and D as face-on configurations, and E as edge-on configuration. Note that the meaning of face-on or edge-on here is different from that in the experimental studies. The latter describes the orientation (parallel or perpendicular) of molecular π–π stacking to its substrate.64 Here, face-on denotes that two adjacent molecules have face-to-face orientations of backbones (the dihedral angle between the planes of two backbones is generally smaller than 45°), and edge-on means that two adjacent molecules have edge-to-edge orientations (the dihedral angle between the planes of two backbones is generally not less than 45°). This naming method has been reported in many theoretical studies.38,65,66

(b) Illustration of the five representative configurations: A, B, C, D, and E. Note that the side alkyl chains and hydrogen atoms are omited for clarity. (c) Proportions of face-on and edge-on dimer configurations in the final MD boxes. (d) Density contour maps of d–φ and φ–θ of molecular pairs in the final MD boxes. The two molecules with the shortest atomic distance between the atoms of two backbones smaller than 0.5 nm are defined as a pair. 
Clearly, the density of configurations A, B, and C is much higher than that of D and E in the 0F final box because of its smallest average ESP and its small bending (see Fig. 2). This is consistent with the RDF analyses. For 1F substitutions, the density of configuration A in 1F-side and 1F-all boxes is similar to that of 0F, while the density of configuration A in the 1F-center box is much smaller. Besides, the density of configuration E with both θ and φ > 60° in the 1F-center box is much higher than that in the other two boxes. This can be attributed to the unbalanced distribution of F atoms on the BDT-T core and the large backbone bending in the 1F-center molecule, as discussed above. The density of configurations A, B, and C in the 1F-all box is comparable to that in the 0F box. However, different from 0F, in the 1F-all box, there also shows the high density of configurations D and E because of its increased ESPs and large bending (see Fig. 2). Overall, we can see that the face-on configurations increase with more fluorinations in 1F substituted boxes, as shown in Fig. 4c. For the dimer configurations in the 2F-substituted boxes, the situation is quite different from the 1F-substituted boxes. The density of configurations A, B, and C in 2F-substituted boxes is clearly smaller than that in 0F and 1F-substituted boxes, and high-density spots move to the upper right corner. This can be attributed to the coulomb repulsion between negative charges on two F atoms and the enlarged torsion angles (ESI,† Fig. S6) between lateral-chain thiophenes and BDTs in the 2F-substituted molecules, which can greatly hinder the backbone π–π stacking. Moreover, compared to the 0F and 1F-substitutied boxes, the final 2F-substituted boxes have much more edge-on configurations. This is reasonable because face-on configurations are impeded by the repulsion between negative ESPs on F atoms and the large torsion angles (see the ESI,† Fig. S5) between lateral-chain thiophene and BDT in 2F-substituted molecules. And the decrease of face-on configurations is in turn beneficial to the edge-on configurations. Generally, the proportions of face-on configurations decrease with more fluorinations in 2F-substituted boxes.
The proportions of face-on and edge-on configurations are shown in Fig. 4c. As expected, compared to the 0F box, the proportions of face-on configurations in all boxes of fluorinated molecules are lowered by fluorination. Specifically, the face-on proportion in the 0F box is up to 56.4%. In contrast, the proportions of face-on configurations in 1F-center/1F-side/1F-all/2F-center/2F-side/2F-all boxes are 50.8%/52.6%/54.1%/49.4%/47.0%/45.7%, respectively. Thus, the trend of face-on proportions is 1F-all > 1F-side > 1F-center in the final 1F-substituted boxes, whereas the trend is 2F-all < 2F-side < 2F-center in the final 2F-substituted boxes. Interestingly, there are 1738/1766/1721/1744/1814/1863/1928 counted molecule pairs in the final simulated box of 0F/1F-center/1F-side/1F-all/2F-center/2F-side/2F-all, respectively. This means that the edge-on molecular packing can generally improve the coordination numbers of these molecules, though it is harmful to π–π stacking.
3.3 Electronic coupling, reorganization energy, and hole mobility
The charge transport of organic simiconductors in amorphous forms is determined by the mesoscopic electrical networks, which depend on the number of nearest neighbors and the strength of intermolecular electronic couplings (Vij).67 The averaged electronic connectivity (Nc) per molecule, which is defined as the average number of neighbors for each molecule with Vij larger than a given threshold VT, is helpful to study the strength of electrical networks.37 For a given VT, the Nc per molecule can be calculated by: Nc(VT) = Npair(Vij > VT) × 2/N, where Npair(Vij > VT) is the number of molecule pairs with Vij > VT, and N is the number of molecules in the simulated box. Generally, a continuous and robust electrical network can be formed only when each molecule has over 2 connected neighbors, i.e. Nc > 2.37 For seven final MD boxes in this work, the Nc per molecule is shown in Fig. 5a. As we can see, the Nc generally dcreases sharply with the increase of VT. When VT = 1 meV, the Nc of 0F/1F-center/1F-side/1F-all/2F-center/2F-side/2F-all is 2.38/1.96/2.46/2.49/2.27/2.30/2.05, respectively. Besides, when Nc = 2, the VTs in all boxes are smaller than 2 meV, indicating that the electrical networks are mainly formed by moleculear pairs with Vij around 1 meV. In general, 1F-all and 1F-side show the strongest and the second strongest electrical networks, respectively, while 1F-center shows the smallest Nc among all molecules. In addition, when VT < 20 meV, the Nc of 2F-side is clearly smaller than those of 0F, 1F-side, and 2F-center. However, when VT > 20 meV, the Nc of 2F-side is almost the same as those of 1F-side and 0F, and is clearly larger than those of 2F-center, 2F-all, and 1F-center.

(c) The number of pairs with Vij > 1 meV as the function of dihedral angle φ. (d) The inner reorganization energies of seven molecules. 
The Vijs as the function of the backbone–backbone COM distance d of molecular pairs extracted from the final MD boxes are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S7. Due to the disorder in amorphous forms, most of the molecular pairs have small Vijs (less than 1 meV). These molecular pairs with Vij < 1 meV contribute little to the continuous and robust electrical networks. To further explain the distinct differences of electrical networks among these final MD boxes, we analyze the number of pairs (Npair) with Vij > 1 meV as the function of backbone COM distance d or dihedral angle φ. As shown in Fig. 5b, in the regions A and B, the order of the Npairs is generally 0F > 1F-side > 1F-all > 2F-side >2F-center > 1F-center > 2F-all, which generally agrees well with the RDFs shown in Fig. 3. Among them, the Npair of 1F-side increases sharply and becomes the largest in region C, while the Npair of 1F-all becomes the largest in regions D and E. As a result, the order of the final Npairs is 1F-all > 1F-side > 0F > 2F-center > 2F-side > 2F-all > 1F-center. Notably, though 1F-center shows a higher RDF peak than 2F-center, 2F-side, and 2F-all (see Fig. 3), it has the worst electrical network among all molecules. This can be attributed to its strongest disorder (the areas with high values in the density contour map of Fig. 4d are far away from each other or not continuous) of the configurations in the 1F-center box, which leads to a bad electrical network. The Npairs with Vij > 1 meV of 1F-center and 2F-all are always smaller than others; in the meantime, the Npairs with Vij > 1 meV of 2F-side and 2F-center are quite close in all the range. In Fig. 5c, there are still many pairs with Vij > 1 meV when φ is in the range of 50°–90°, indicating that configuration E also contributes to electrical networks. As expected, most of Npairs with Vij > 1 meV are contributed from face-on configurations.
Next, the reorganization energy λ for hole transfer of seven monomers is given in Fig. 5d. The λ of 0F is 0.149 eV, and the λ of the fluorinated molecules are generally not less than 0F except for 1F-center (0.146 eV). The trends of λ of 1F- and 2F-substituted molecules are always center < all < side. Also, for the same substitution position, the λ of the 2F-substituted molecules is always larger than that of the 1F-substituted molecules. The differences among these λ can be explained with the HOMO distributions, as shown in the ESI,† Fig. S2. Generally, the extended delocalization of FMOs can attenuate the inner reorganization energy.51,68 For 1F-side and 2F-side, the HOMOs are mainly localized on the center BDT, while both of 1F-center and 2F-center are well delocalized on three BDTs. Hence, the λ values of 1F-side (0.156 eV)/2F-side (0.166 eV) are slightly larger than those of 1F-center (0.146 eV)/2F-center (0.150 eV), respectively. In addition, the HOMO delocalization of 2F-substituted molecules is worse than that of the 1F-substituted molecules.
Finally, the hole mobilities (μh) and other key results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 1. The calculated μh of prototype 0F is 1.89 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one magnitude larger than the experiment result measured by the SCLC method (1.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).35 It is acceptable because the experimental thin films were obtained by solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The quasi-ordered structure in the experimental work is harmful to form continuous electrical networks because there are many gaps between ordered regions, as reported by previous theoretical results.37 Compared to 0F, because of the strongest and second strongest electrical networks and different reorganization energies (1F-all < 1F-side), 1F-all (3.19 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 1F-side (3.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) show the fastest and the second fastest μhs, respectively. Overall, the trend of μhs is 1F-center < 1F-side < 1F-all in the 1F-substituted molecules, whereas it is 2F-center > 2F-side > 2F-center in the 2F-substituted molecules. This is in good agreement with the proportions of face-on configurations (see Fig. 3c). It is reasonable because it is well-known that the face-on configuration is beneficial to large Vij. Notably, the crystallinity and electrical network of 2F-center are weaker than those of 0F, but the μh of the 2F-center (2.23 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is larger than that of 0F. It can be attributed to the number of configurations C and D of 2F-center, which is much larger (see Fig. 4d) than that of 0F. In general, a short charge transfer distance is beneficial for enhancing electronic coupling, while a large charge transfer distance is favorable for large carrier mobility, as shown in eqn (2). Thus, achieving large charge carrier mobility should ensure enhanced electronic coupling and long charge transfer distance simultaneously.69 Though the Vijs of configurations C and D may be smaller than those of configurations A and B, they can provide longer charge transfer pathways. So, the configurations C and D are also important to improve μh. In contrast, though the electrical network of 2F-side is comparable to 2F-center when VT < 20 meV, and is even better than that of 2F-center when VT > 20 meV, the μh of 2F-side (1.65 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is slightly smaller than those of 0F and 2F-center. This is because 2F-side has less configurations C and D as well as larger reorganization energy than 2F-center. Similarly, though the electronic coupling of 2F-all is slightly stronger than that of 1F-center, the λ of 2F-all (0.163 eV) is larger than that of 1F-center (0.146 eV), hence, the μh of 2F-all (0.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is slightly smaller than that of 1F-center (1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, due to the much weaker electrical networks of 1F-center and 2F-all, their μhs are smaller than that of prototype 0F.

We also note that recent reports show that the μh of 0F:F-2Cl blend is 2.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and it is clearly larger than that of 1F-center:F-2Cl blend (8.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).33,34 This trend is consistent with our result that the μh of 0F (1.89 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is faster than that of 1F-center (1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Besides, our results show that the μh of 2F-center (2.23 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is superior to both of 0F and 1F-center. This is also in good agreement with the previous experimental results that the BTEC-2F:Y6 blend exhibited a higher hole mobility of 5.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than prototype DCAO3TBDTT:Y6 (4.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and BTEC-1F:Y6 (4.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (BTEC-1F and BTEC-2F are obtained by functionalizing the lateral-thiophenes of the center BDT-T unit of DCAO3TBDTT with 1 and 2 F atoms, respectively) in the study by Ge et al.18 In brief, the available experimental results confirm the reliability of our methods to predict the trends of hole mobility of fluorinated BDT-T based donor materials, as shown in the ESI,† Table S1.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied the effects of the numbers and positions of fluorinations on the morphology and hole mobility of the DRTB-T donor by using multiscale simulations. We find that the crystallinity and face-on configurations of DRTB-T (0F) are weakened by fluorination, and the molecular stacking patterns also change significantly by the number and position of fluorination. The trend of face-on configurations proportions in the 1F-substituted molecules is 1F-center < 1F-side < 1F-all, whereas it is 2F-center > 2F-side > 2F-all in the 2F-substituted molecules. The face-on configurations are dominated in 0F and 1F-substituted molecules. However, the edge-on configurations are dominated in 2F-substituted molecules because of the repulsion between the negative ESP on F atoms and the large torsion angles between lateral-chain thiophene and BDTs, which greatly impede the backbone π–π stacking. Besides, due to the changes of HOMO delocalization and molecule packing, the reorganization energy and electrical network also change greatly, respectively. As a result, the hole mobility greatly varies in different fluorinated donors, and the trend of the obtained μhs matches well with the experiments. We find that by carefully adjusting the number and position of fluorination on the lateral-chain thiophenes of DRTB-T, because of the enhanced electrical networks and similar reorganization energies, the μhs of 1F-all (3.19 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 1F-side (3.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) are clearly faster than those of 0F (1.89 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and other fluorinated molecules. In contrast, due to the limited backbone π–π stacking and weak electrical networks, the μhs of 1F-center (1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 2F-all (0.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) are slower than that of 0F. Furthermore, the trend of μhs is 1F-center < 1F-side < 1F-all in the 1F-substituted molecules, whereas it is 2F-center > 2F-side > 2F-all in the 2F-substituted molecules. This is consistent with the proportions of face-on configurations. Finally, we find that functionalizing the lateral-chain thiophenes of side BDT-Ts (1F-side) or all BDT-Ts (1F-all) with only one F atom is efficient to fine-tune the morphologies and hole motilities of DRTB-T based SM donors at the same time.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of seven modeled molecules. (b) The percent of area with ESP in a specific region. (c) Dipole moments and the estimated backbone bending of seven molecules.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) COM RDFs of donor units (three-BDT-T units without alkyl chains) of seven molecules in amorphous films. (b) The number of pairs per donor unit as a function of donor–donor COM distance.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Scheme of the three selected geometry parameters of dimer configurations: the backbone COM distance: d, the dihedral angle between two molecular planes: φ, and the angle between long axes: θ. (b) Illustration of the five representative configurations: A, B, C, D, and E. Note that the side alkyl chains and hydrogen atoms are omited for clarity. (c) Proportions of face-on and edge-on dimer configurations in the final MD boxes. (d) Density contour maps of d–φ and φ–θ of molecular pairs in the final MD boxes. The two molecules with the shortest atomic distance between the atoms of two backbones smaller than 0.5 nm are defined as a pair.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The averaged electronic connectivity per molecule as a function of VT in seven final MD boxes. (b) The number of pairs with Vij > 1 meV as the function of backbone COM distance. (c) The number of pairs with Vij > 1 meV as the function of dihedral angle φ. (d) The inner reorganization energies of seven molecules.	 

 	Fig. 6  Hole mobilities (μh) of seven simulated molecules, obtained with molecular dynamics simulation and KMC.
