    , Accepted 22nd August 2017First published on 22nd August 2017AbstractDue to their high absorption efficiency, great carrier diffusion length, and low surface recombination velocity, lead halide perovskite micro- and nano-lasers have been extensively studied for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices and photonics integration. But it is still a challenge to achieve a stable and controllable lasing action, especially for single-mode lasing. Herein, solution-processed single-crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microsheets and microwires were synthesized to realize Fabry–Pérot lasing at room temperature. Based on their high crystalline quality and high optical confinement, the lasing actions were investigated systematically. The lasing mode regulation was carried out from multiple modes to the single mode via reducing the width of CH3NH3PbBr3 microstructures.
Organometal halide perovskites have been recently attracting tremendous attention for solar cell applications because of their excellent photophysical properties such as high absorption coefficient, large exciton binding energy, long carrier lifetime, and low Auger recombination rate.1–3 These advantages can also make them serve as extraordinary lasing media. In particular, their very good lasing performances have been achieved using Fabry–Pérot (F–P) and whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators based on single crystals of nanostructured perovskites.4–7 For instance, Zhu et al. reported the lasing performances of a solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 nanowire as a single crystal with a low threshold of 220 nJ cm−2, high quality factor (Q) of 3600, and near-unity quantum yield.8 In addition, Xiong et al. fabricated a series of polygonal perovskite-based F–P or WGM resonators by using the vapor phase deposition method and analyzed their lasing behaviors.7,9 Interestingly, widely tunable lasing modes from the near-infrared to visible range have been obtained for the single-crystal nanowires or nanoplates of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) at room temperature by being able to change the percentage of halides.10 However, the semiconductor nanowires usually exhibit higher wave-guiding losses even at low surface roughness.11 Moreover, it is not easy to operate them owing to their relatively small size, and poor photostability and thermal stability.12
As one of the most stable organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, CH3NH3PbBr3 in the form of microdisks, micro/nanoplates and nanowires has been employed to generate microlasers.13 Single-mode lasing using this perovskite has been obtained via micromanipulation as well as by obtaining a desirable substrate configuration to suppress the competing parasitic modes.14,15 However, how to yield a stable and controllable lasing action is still a challenging issue. In this work, CH3NH3PbBr3 microsheets/microwires were synthesized by using the anti-solvent crystallization technique.16 The high crystalline quality and good light confinement effect of these microsheets/microwires together with tuning the width of the CH3NH3PbBr3 F–P cavities resulted in the effective conversion of amplified spontaneous emissions into multi-mode and single-mode lasing emissions.
To synthesize the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite, 0.2 M of CH3NH3Br and a Pb(NO3)2 solution were mixed together with a volume ratio of 3:1 in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and then gently shaken until their complete dissolution. Even though Pb(NO3)2 is poorly soluble in DMF, it acts as a good complexing agent for CH3NH3Br, and they hence form CH3NH3PbBr3 with desirable diffusion. The CH3NH3PbBr3 solution was then administered onto a glass substrate and sealed in a beaker to control the evaporation rate. After about 24 hours at room temperature, CH3NH3PbBr3 microsheets were obtained on the substrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the CH3NH3PbBr3 microstructures were obtained by using a Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope operated at 1.5 kV and a powder X-ray diffractometer with a goniometer radius of 285 mm (Ultima IV with Cu Kalpha radiation, Rigaku Corporation), respectively. Samples were excited using a femtosecond laser at a wavelength of 325 nm with a pulse duration of 150 fs and a repetition rate of 1000 Hz in a micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) system, and the PL spectra were collected by using a spectrometer (SpectraPro-2500i, Acton Research Corporation).

Fig. 1a shows an SEM image of the CH3NH3PbBr3 microsheets. The microsheets were observed in this image to have very smooth surfaces and to have dimensions ranging from a few microns to hundreds of microns. The crystal structure of the microsheet product was revealed by the XRD pattern we acquired from this product, shown in Fig. 1b. Strong diffraction peaks were observed at 15.34°, 21.52°, 30.46° and 46.19°, which were attributed, respectively, to the (100), (011), (002), (021) and (003) crystal planes of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite.17–20 The EDS spectrum acquired from the product is shown in Fig. 1c; the atomic ratio of Br/Pb was estimated to be 3:1. The mapping of the elements (Fig. 1c) confirmed the presence of C, N, Pb and Br elements and their uniform distribution in the microsheets. All of these XRD, SEM and EDS results demonstrated the high crystal quality of the CH3NH3PbBr3 microstructures.

Fig. 2 shows the PL behaviors of a large single CH3NH3PbBr3 microsheet, specifically with areal dimensions of 171 μm × 98 μm. A typical spontaneous emission spectrum of this microsheet (Fig. 2b) exhibited an asymmetric broad band at a low excitation power of 0.089 mW. A Gaussian deconvolution of this band yielded two emission peaks, at wavelengths of about 532 nm and 546 nm with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values of 12.25 nm and 26.6 nm, respectively; these two peaks were attributed to two phase-related interband emissions.21 Also, the band narrowed to an FWHM of 4.2 nm (and centered at 552.2 nm) as the excitation power was increased to 0.131 mW (Fig. 2c and d). This result clearly demonstrated the conversion from spontaneous emission to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The ASE happened in the long-wavelength region because of the greater gain in this region than that in the shorter-wavelength region. Plots of the output intensity and FWHM value as a function of excitation power are shown in Fig. 2d, and indicated a threshold of 0.137 mW corresponding to a gain sufficient to overcome the loss. Above this threshold, the emission intensity increased and line width decreased dramatically in the stimulated emission process. It is difficult to observe lasing emission in such a big microsheet due to insufficient gain from the small excited spot (∼12 μm in diameter).

PL spectra were obtained from this microsheet at various excitation powers (shown in Fig. 3b) in order to investigate the lasing action. The PL spectrum obtained using the lowest excitation power tested showed a broad inhomogeneous and spontaneous emission, an emission similar to that obtained from the larger microsheet and shown in Fig. 2b. As the excitation power was increased to 0.209 mW, the sharp emission peaks appeared with dramatically enhanced intensities, which indicated the generation of lasing in the microcavity. The sides of the microsheet showed a bright green emission (Fig. 3b), which indicated an effective waveguiding behavior as well as typical F–P-type microcavity. At a higher excitation power of 0.251 mW (Fig. 3c), several sharper and stronger lasing modes occurred at a wavelength of about 554 nm with an FWHM of 0.41 nm and Q factor of 1352. The Q factor was calculated according to the equation of Q = λ/δλ, where λ and δλ are the lasing mode wavelength and FWHM, respectively.

Fig. 3d shows output intensity and FWHM values of the cavity for the various excitation power levels tested. As the excitation power was increased from 0.044 mW to 0.251 mW, the output intensity markedly increased, and the spectral linewidth dramatically decreased from 25 nm to 0.41 nm. The conversion kink at 0.209 mW was estimated to be the lasing threshold.
Multimode lasing was observed in other microsheets, as shown in Fig. 4a. From the lasing spectra and the fitting curves of Fig. 4b, it can be noted that the spacing (Δλ) between the adjacent lasing modes was observed to decrease as the width of the microsheet was increased. The experimental mode spacing values matched well with the calculated values according to eqn (1). In principle, for a F–P cavity, the mode spacing Δλ vs. cavity length L obeys the equation (1)where λ is the resonant mode wavelength, n is the refractive index and [n − λ (dn/dλ)] is the effective refractive index. Based on the linear fitting relationship between λ2/2Δλ and L (shown in Fig. 4b), the value of [n − λ (dn/dλ)] of CH3NH3PbBr3 at 554.4 nm was calculated to be 5.7, which confirmed that F–P-type longitudinal cavity effects occurred for these lasing modes. Owing to this higher effective refractive index, the optical field can be tightly confined and guided along the width of the microsheet with low optical loss.4,5,22,23

Controlling the size of the resonator cavity is an effective and convenient strategy to regulate the lasing modes. A single mode lasing would be obtained when the free spectral range of a cavity size exceeds the spectral width of the gain medium.24 The size-dependent lasing characteristics were investigated systematically by decreasing the width of CH3NH3PbBr3 microsheets/microbelts in the range 779 nm to 14.35 μm, as shown in Fig. 5. The number of resonant modes decreased as the width was reduced from 14.35 μm to 2.7 μm, and a single resonant mode occurred when the width was further reduced to 2.35 μm. Only amplified spontaneous emission was observed for widths less than 2.35 μm, and we attributed this result to the increased optical loss in the smaller cavities.

Fig. 6 depicts typical single-mode lasing behaviors from a CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire with dimensions of 2.43 μm × 380 μm. The lasing action was entirely constituted by a single longitudinal mode at 558 nm, and the threshold was estimated to be 0.357 mW. The FWHM value of the single mode was observed to be as narrow as 0.29 nm, which indicated a high Q-factor of 1924. Due to this whole width of the microwire has been effectively excited. The nice lasing performance of the microwire is attributed to the width of the cavity well match with the lasing mode wavelength caused the more efficient gain.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of large CH3NH3PbBr3 microsheets containing micro-cavities were fabricated and the lasing modes were suppressed by reducing the cavity size. In the systematic study of lasing mode regulation, a high-quality single-mode lasing was obtained in a microwire with a width of 2.43 μm, which displayed an excellent optical gain with a favorable Q-factor.
