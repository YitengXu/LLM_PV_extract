    , Accepted 4th July 2013First published on 4th July 2013AbstractA versatile electrochemical system for the non-aqueous electrodeposition of crystalline, oxide free p-block metals and metalloids is described, and it is demonstrated that by combining mixtures of these reagents, this system is suitable for electrodeposition of binary semiconductor alloys. The tetrabutylammonium halometallates, [NnBu4][InCl4], [NnBu4][SbCl4], [NnBu4][BiCl4], [NnBu4]2[SeCl6] and [NnBu4]2[TeCl6], are readily dissolved in CH2Cl2 and form reproducible electrochemical systems with good stability in the presence of a [NnBu4]Cl supporting electrolyte. The prepared electrolytes show a wide potential window and the electrodeposition of indium, antimony, bismuth, tellurium and selenium on glassy carbon and titanium nitride electrodes has been demonstrated. The deposited elements were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The compatibility of the reagents permits the preparation of a single electrolyte containing several halometallate species which allows the electrodeposition of binary materials, as is demonstrated for InSb. This room temperature, ‘bottom-up’ electrochemical approach should thus be suitable for the one-pot deposition of a wide range of compound semiconductor materials.
Introduction
Physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) are widely used in the preparation of many semiconductor materials for applications, such as phase change memory materials,1–3 thermoelectric films,4–6 topological insulators7 and solar cells.8,9 However, the push towards device miniaturisation and increase of data storage density often requires the deposition of these materials onto complex nanostructured substrates. PVD, CVD and thermal ALD are ‘top-down’ deposition methods which are widely used for growing high quality thin metallic and semiconductor films. Filling high aspect ratio structures by PVD or CVD presents a significant challenge. ALD can be highly effective here, but the inherent slow growth rates of ALD are not ideal. Electrochemical ALD is an alternative solution based flow method that allows filling of 3-D structured electrode substrates, although it requires relatively large electrolyte volumes and the layer-by-layer fabrication method is also relatively slow.10 ‘One-pot’ electrodeposition, in which the precursors containing the required elements are present together in a single solution, eliminating the need for flow conditions, provides an alternative ‘bottom-up’ approach which is also, in principle, well suited for selective filling of micro- or nanostructured templates.11 Electrodeposition also offers a lower cost alternative to the vapour deposition techniques as it does not require UHV equipment or high temperatures.
The electrodeposition of p-block metals and metalloids, integral for the preparation of the aforementioned materials, has been studied in a variety of aqueous systems, ionic liquids and, in a few cases, in organic solvents.
The electrodeposition of indium (from chloride electrolytes),12 bismuth (from nitric acid electrolytes),13–15 selenium (from LiCl electrolytes),16 antimony (from chloride electrolytes)17,18 and tellurium (from acidic sulfate or nitrate electrolytes)19,20 was described from aqueous systems. The effect of the electrolyte composition on the deposition process and the properties of the deposits were probed and well-defined films were generally obtained. However, the discussion of the preparation and quality of elemental films from aqueous systems over the past decade is very scarce and the majority of the literature discusses the preparation of alloys containing these elements.
Ionic liquids or molten salts have also been employed to deposit the elements discussed in this paper. Indium (from piperidinium-based ionic liquid),21 antimony and bismuth (from AlCl3–NaCl–KCl molten salt),22 selenium (from 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium trifluoromethylsulfonate or 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ionic liquids)23,24 and tellurium (from AlCl3–NaCl–KCl or aluminium chloride-1-methyl-3-ethylimidazolium chloride electrolytes),22,25 were all successfully deposited. Again, the deposits could be controlled by the composition of the electrolytes and the deposition temperature.
Although the electrodeposition from both systems works well, they also have certain disadvantages: aqueous systems often require the use of acidic electrolytes in order to dissolve the metal precursors and provide a limited (narrow) potential window. Ionic liquids provide extremely wide potential windows, which make the electrodeposition of elements with very negative deposition potentials, such as germanium, silicon or aluminium achievable.26 However, they tend to be viscous and can be both moisture sensitive and difficult to prepare.
The use of organic solvents for electrodeposition processes has not received as much attention. A 2009 review by Simka et al. discusses the electrodeposition of several elements from a range of organic solvents and ionic liquids.27 In their review they presented the electrodeposition of tellurium, antimony and bismuth. The electrodeposition of tellurium was discussed from methanol, acetonitrile and propylene carbonate in the context of ZnTe deposition.28 Antimony, bismuth and tellurium electrodeposition was discussed from ionic liquids.22,29,30
The use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the deposition of thermoelectric materials, such as Bi2Te3 and Bi0.5Sb1.5Te2, has been discussed in the literature.31,32 The high solubility of the precursors in DMSO was considered an advantage over aqueous systems, removing the need for complexing agents, although DMSO is a rather viscous solvent with high surface tension. Bismuth selenide and bismuth antimonide films have also been prepared from DMSO based electrolytes.33,34
The electrodeposition of indium from ethylene glycol has been studied by Kumar et al.35 They investigated the ethylene glycol electrolyte system as an alternative to aqueous electrolytes for the deposition of ternary alloys.
Typically these publications discuss the electrodeposition from commercially available metal chloride or metal iodide precursors dissolved directly in the electrolyte solutions. The solvents and supporting electrolytes used also varied significantly between the different examples, making the preparation of alloy or compound materials more challenging.
In this paper we present an electrolyte system based on tetrabutylammonium halometallate salts dissolved in dichloromethane under inert atmosphere conditions. These well-defined and easily synthesised reagents show very high solubility in organic solvents, allowing the preparation of high-concentration electrolytes. The low surface tension of CH2Cl2 also makes it a promising solvent for the electrodeposition of materials into nanopatterned substrates, provided sufficiently high conductivities can be achieved. The presented precursor complexes are chemically very similar (i.e. chlorometallate salts) and thus are likely to be mutually compatible, allowing alloyed materials to be obtained by combining the relevant chlorometallates in appropriate ratios.
The electrolyte system prepared from tetrabutylammonium chlorometallates ([NnBu4]x[MCly]) with tetrabutylammonium chloride ([NnBu4]Cl) as the supporting electrolyte, proved suitable for the electrodeposition of a wide variety of p-block elements including selenium, indium, antimony, tellurium and bismuth. The electrodeposition of further p-block metals and metalloids, where chlorometallate salts can be formed, may also be feasible using a similar approach.
The electrodeposition of InSb is also discussed to demonstrate the ability of the electrolyte system to deposit binary materials. The wide range of elements accessible with this versatile electrolyte system and the compatibility of the precursors opens up the possibility for the deposition of compound semiconductor materials by combining the relevant precursors under appropriate conditions.

Electrochemical characterisation
The electrolyte preparation and the electrochemical experiments were performed in a dry nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box (Belle Technology), allowing efficient exclusion of air and moisture. Dry dichloromethane was used as the solvent. All electrolytes were prepared with 0.01 mol dm−3 of the tetrabutylammonium chlorometallate salts as the redox species and 0.1 mol dm−3 tetrabutylammonium chloride (Fluka, ≥99.0%) as the supporting electrolyte. A Pt gauze was used as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode (in 0.1 mol dm−3 [NnBu4]Cl in CH2Cl2) was used as the reference electrode. Glassy carbon working electrodes were used for the voltammetric characterisation of the compounds. Films were deposited potentiostatically onto either freshly polished glassy carbon electrodes (3 mm diameter rod) or onto titanium nitride film electrodes (4 mm diameter exposed circular area). The latter is of interest from a practical point of view, since TiN is commonly used as a conductor and a diffusion barrier in electronic applications. The electrochemical experiments were performed in a one-compartment electrochemical cell. A microAutolab 3 potentiostat and the Autolab GPES software were used for the electrochemical measurements. The conductivity of the pure supporting electrolyte was measured using a handheld conductivity meter (Fisher).
Film characterisation
The deposited films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to probe the structure and composition of the deposited films. A Philips XL30 ESEM microscope equipped with a Thermo Scientific UltraDry EDS Detector and a Thermo Scientific NORAN System 7 X-ray Microanalysis System were used for the SEM and EDX analyses. All films, apart from the selenium film on glassy carbon, were imaged in high-vacuum mode. The selenium film was imaged against a water back pressure of 0.6 Torr.
XRD patterns for In, Sb, Te and Bi films were collected using a Bruker D8 GADDS diffractometer (Cu-Kα1), in grazing incidence configuration where appropriate (Te, Bi; θ1 = 5°). Where preferred orientation was observed (Sb film) a series of fixed angle scans were carried out with incident angle θ1 equal to 2θ/2 for each reflection in order to observe preferred orientation perpendicular to the plane of the film. For Se films, XRD patterns were collected in grazing incidence (θ1 = 2°) using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer (Cu-Kα1).
Raman scattering spectra were measured at room temperature on a Renishaw InVia Micro Raman Spectrometer using a helium-neon laser with a wavelength of 633 nm. The incident laser power was adjusted to ∼0.1 mW to minimize heating and consequent changes in the crystalline state or oxidation of the samples. The laser beam diameter on the sample was smaller than 2 μm using a 50× objective.
TiN electrodes
While the majority of the presented electrochemical work was performed on glassy carbon, the electrodeposition onto TiN electrodes is also discussed due to the significance of TiN as a substrate in electronics applications.42 In order to obtain well-defined electrode areas, a two-step lift-off process was employed for the electrode preparation. A cartoon describing the process is presented in Fig. 1. A TiN layer was first deposited onto a Si wafer patterned with a grid structure of resist. After removal of the resist the intended electrode and contact areas were protected with a second layer of resist and a layer of SiO2 was deposited on top of the TiN to mask the non-relevant areas of the electrode chips. The cyclic voltammetry of [NnBu4][SbCl4] and [NnBu4][BiCl4] were measured on TiN electrodes insulated using polyimide adhesive tape (Tesa).
 Fig. 1  Cartoon of the steps involved in the preparation of area-defined TiN electrodes. Top and cross section-views, not drawn to scale. A first layer of resist was applied to the silicon wafer (A) in order to define individual electrode chips and avoid current leaking at the electrode edges (B). A TiN film was then deposited onto the patterned wafer (C). This was followed by a lift-off process which removed the resist using acetone and exposed the grid regions (D). A second layer of resist was applied to define the contact and electrode areas (E) before a layer of SiO2 was deposited as insulator (F). A second lift-off process was performed, by removing the resist with acetone (G). The TiN electrodes were cut into individual chips and washed with acetone and isopropanol before the electrochemical experiments. 
Titanium nitride films with a thickness of 125 nm were deposited onto resistive Si wafers by medium frequency plasma assisted magnetron sputtering (Leybold Optics HELIOS Pro XL) at room temperature. This process combines reactive middle frequency sputtering with an additional RF plasma source. During each rotation of the plate holding the substrate, a thin layer of Ti was deposited from dual magnetron metal targets (99.99% purity) using a power of 3000 W in an Ar atmosphere. The thin film was then transformed into a nitride layer by passing the substrate underneath the N2 plasma of the RF source. The N2 and Ar flow rates were maintained at 30 and 35 sccm, respectively and a high drive speed of 180 rpm was applied to enhance the film uniformity. The deposition rate was 0.161 nm s−1. The sheet resistance of the TiN film was measured by the 4-probe technique (Jandel 4-probe analyzer) and was found to be 6.8 ± 0.4 Ω/□. The calculated resistivity was 85 ± 5 μΩ cm. Lift-off processes were performed by washing the substrate with acetone.
A 200 nm layer of SiO2 was deposited as a masking layer by medium frequency dual magnetron sputtering using pure Si targets (99.99% purity) at an MF magnetron power of 4350 W in an O2/Ar atmosphere. The O2 and Ar flow rates were maintained at 20 and 40 sccm, respectively. The layer was then further oxidized using an O2 plasma in the additional RF plasma source operating at 2000 W with an O2 flow rate of 30 sccm. A drive speed of 180 rpm yielded a deposition rate of 0.3 nm s−1. After a subsequent lift-off process, the wafer was cut along the initial grid lines to obtain the individual electrodes. Before the electrochemical experiments the TiN electrodes were cleaned by dipping into acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
This work is concerned with exploring the electrochemical deposition of selected heavy p-block elements from organic solvents using tetrabutylammonium chloride as the supporting electrolyte. Potential reagents to introduce the p-block elements need to be readily prepared, highly soluble in the organic solvent, and preferably a single species in solution. Since the electrolyte provides a substantial excess of Cl− ions, it may be possible to introduce the elements as their binary chlorides, and form chlorometallate anions in situ. However, the chlorides SbCl3, SeCl4, BiCl3, InCl3 and TeCl4 all show some degree of moisture sensitivity, with SbCl3 and SeCl4, in particular, being very hygroscopic. Hence, the chlorometallate anions were prepared as [NnBu4]+ salts (Experimental), which are much less moisture sensitive and easier to manipulate as powdered solids. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy from dichloromethane solutions showed that the speciation of [NnBu4]2[TeCl6] and [NnBu4]2[SeCl6] were unchanged in the presence of excess chloride.43 In contrast 115In NMR spectroscopy showed that sequential addition of [NnBu4]Cl to a solution of [NnBu4][InCl4] (δ(115In) = 447) shifted the resonance to low frequency as increasing amounts of [InCl5]2− and [InCl6]3− were formed.44,45 No suitable nuclei are available for similar studies of Sb and Bi systems, and the species present on adding [MCl4]− salts to an excess [NnBu4]Cl solution are unclear. A very wide range of stoichiometries and structures are known for halometallates of these two elements in the solid state,46 but the solution speciation is likely to involve much simpler, probably mononuclear, species [MCl3+x]x− in rapid equilibrium.
Electrochemical characterisation of tetrabutylammonium chlorometallate precursors
The voltammetry of the individual precursors is comparable to the voltammetry of the same elements in other media, including aqueous solvents. This indicates that the [NnBu4]Cl – dichloromethane system is well suited for the deposition of these elements.12,15,20,47 The voltammetric characteristics of the different elements are presented in Fig. 2. The grey scans included in the figures correspond to the voltammetric response measured in the pure supporting electrolyte, highlighting the width of the potential window available in the [NnBu4]Cl – dichloromethane system. The current densities in the voltammograms of the supporting electrolyte remain below 0.1 mA cm−2 for the glassy carbon electrodes and below 0.02 mA cm−2 for the titanium nitride electrodes between −1.5 and +1.5 V, indicating that the electrolyte provides a good potential window. Conductivity measurements on a 0.1 mol dm−3 solution of [NBu4]Cl in CH2Cl2 also showed a conductivity (σ) comparable to 0.01 mol dm−3 KCl (σ ≈ 1 mS cm−1). Fig. 2 also highlights how the voltammetry of the different elements depends strongly on the periodic group.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms of 0.01 mol dm−3 [NnBu4][InCl4] (A), [NnBu4][SbCl4] (B), [NnBu4][BiCl4] (C), [NnBu4]2[SeCl6] (D) and [NnBu4]2[TeCl6] (E) in dichloromethane containing 0.1 mol dm−3 [NnBu4]Cl as the supporting electrolyte measured on glassy carbon working electrodes. The light grey scans correspond to the pure supporting electrolyte. The potential scan rate was 50 mV s−1. 
The voltammetry of [NnBu4][InCl4] presented in Fig. 2(A) is characterised by a significant nucleation overpotential and a well-characterised stripping peak. The nucleation onset was at approximately −0.63 V. The peak deposition potential was observed in the reverse scan with a peak at −1.0 V. The voltammogram suggests that indium is reduced directly from the In(III) oxidation state to In(0). The stripping onset occurred at −0.55 V. There are significant discrepancies between the charges observed for the deposition and the stripping peak. While the total reduction charge is 37.17 mC cm−2, the stripping peak only yielded a charge of 12.55 mC cm−2. The three-fold larger deposition charge suggests that the stripped indium species might differ from the original In(III) species used in the electrolyte preparation. The species generated may be In(I) species, such as [NnBu4][InCl2], [NnBu4]2[InCl3] or In[InCl4] which may also be stable in the electrolyte.48–50 Another striking feature in the voltammetry of [NnBu4][InCl4] is the set of oscillations between −1.1 and −1.2 V. These were observed in several independent experiments and remain visible over several consecutive scans. They may be associated with an oscillating deposition reaction affecting the conductivity of the electrode surface. Upon repetitive cycling of the electrode the oscillations disappear, suggesting that they are related to the glassy carbon surface, rather than the adsorbed indium. Once a sufficient amount of indium nuclei have formed, further growth only occurs on these and thus, the oscillations disappear.
Cyclic voltammograms obtained from the Group 15 elements antimony and bismuth are presented in Fig. 2(B) and (C). The voltammetry of both, [NnBu4][SbCl4] and [NnBu4][BiCl4] is characterised by a steep deposition onset followed by a peak and subsequent diffusion-limited deposition behaviour in the reverse scan. Lower valent halometallate species are unlikely for antimony and bismuth, hence the appearance of the single reduction wave suggests that the Sb(III) and Bi(III) species are directly reduced to the elements. The deposition current remains diffusion-limited in the anodic scan direction until the stripping onset is reached. The nucleation overpotentials are significantly smaller than observed in the case of indium. The deposition onset, peak deposition current and stripping onset were −0.30 V, −0.75 V and −0.1 V for Sb and −0.13 V, −0.51 V and 0.03 V for Bi. The charges obtained from the deposition and the stripping were 89.1 mC cm−2 and 38.7 mC cm−2 for Sb and 78.4 mC cm−2 and 71.4 mC cm−2 for Bi. The difference in charge for the Sb voltammetry may be related to the low adherence of the deposits to the glassy carbon surface. The deposited material could detach from the electrode surface during the scan and account for the discrepancy in the deposition and stripping currents. The quantities involved would be in the order of two micrograms and thus invisible to the naked eye.
The deposition of the Group 16 elements selenium and tellurium differed significantly. Both, [NnBu4]2[SeCl6] and [NnBu4]2[TeCl6], featured reduction and oxidation potentials that were much more positive and the stripping onset was close to the anodic edge of the potential window. Cyclic voltammograms for selenium are presented in Fig. 2(D). The selenium reduction started at 0.77 V and decreased gradually until a peak was observed at −0.25 V. Another sharp peak at −0.69 V followed by a plateauing current was observed. This peak could also be related to a small peak at −0.46 V in the reverse scan direction, but its origin is uncertain. No nucleation overpotential was observed for the selenium voltammetry. The voltammetry of [NnBu4]2[TeCl6] is presented in Fig. 2(E). The second and third scans differ significantly from the first scan indicating modification of the electrode surface due to fast tellurium deposition. In the first scan the deposition onset potential was 0.11 V and the deposition current reached a peak at −1.15 V. A current plateau was observed in the reverse scan direction and the stripping onset was at −0.46 V. In the second and third scans the deposition onset shifted towards more positive potentials, indicating a change in the electrode surface. For both the tellurium and selenium compounds only the onset of the stripping peaks were observed in the investigated potential window. In the case of selenium the voltammetry remained very stable and the electrode appears unchanged upon visual inspection. In the case of the tellurium containing electrolyte, where the voltammetry changes significantly with each successive scan, the electrode was covered in an opaque black film after three scans.
The voltammetry of the different electrolytes was also investigated on TiN electrodes. The voltammograms are presented in Fig. 3 for illustration. They are comparable with those on glassy carbon electrodes, most likely involving the same redox processes. As described in the experimental section, the area of the TiN electrodes was defined by a layer of SiO2 deposited on top of the TiN layer. The electrodes showed a very low background current and less well-defined peaks than were observed for the glassy carbon electrodes. This is particularly obvious for the selenium voltammetry in Fig. 3(D). It should be noted that despite the non-ideal voltammetric characteristics of the TiN electrodes (possibly due to their higher resistivity) they were very suitable for electrodeposition and films often showed superior adhesion properties on the TiN compared to the glassy carbon electrodes (below).

The light grey scans correspond to the pure supporting electrolyte. The potential scan rate was 50 mV s−1. 
Electrodeposition
The individual p-block elements were deposited potentiostatically onto freshly polished glassy carbon electrodes or titanium nitride film electrodes. The same electrolytes as for the voltammetric characterisations were used. The deposition potentials and times were tailored to each element in order to obtain films of sufficient thicknesses for EDX and XRD analysis. The electrodes were first held at a potential where no reaction occurred for 5 s and were then switched to a constant deposition potential. For glassy carbon electrodes In, Sb and Bi were deposited at their respective deposition peak potentials. Se was deposited at −1.0 V, beyond the potential of the more cathodic peak and Te was deposited at the peak potential observed in the third scan in Fig. 2(E). The deposited films were analysed by SEM, EDX and XRD. Deposition times and potentials are given in the figure legends. The films produced had thicknesses typically of a few microns.

Fig. 4 shows SEM images of the resulting films. Indium, antimony, bismuth and tellurium were all deposited readily and formed thick films with different morphologies, depending on the crystal structure and the deposition potential. The insets show that the electrodes are not all covered homogeneously. This is mainly associated with the weak adhesion of the films to the glassy carbon electrode. Indium, antimony and selenium in particular showed very poor adhesion, causing the films to detach during rinsing.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of electrodeposited films of In (A), Sb (B), Bi (C), Se (D) and Te (E) on glassy carbon electrodes. The scale bars represent 10 μm. The insets show overview images of the whole electrodes with the scale bars representing 1 mm. The deposition potentials and times were −1 V and 3600 s for indium (A), −0.75 V and 1800 s for antimony (B), −0.59 V and 1800 s for bismuth (C), −1 V and 57600 s for selenium (D) and −0.4 V and 3600 s for tellurium (E). The electrolytes are described in Fig. 2. 
The indium film shown in Fig. 4(A) was composed of individual particles. The main micrograph was obtained on the thickest area seen in the inset. Antimony formed a uniform film composed of aggregated globular features ranging in size from several micrometres to a few hundred nanometres (see Fig. 4(B)). Bismuth formed an extremely thick deposit with a dendritic morphology (Fig. 4(C)). Selenium was deposited inefficiently and did not adhere well to the glassy carbon substrate. Thus, extremely long deposition times had to be employed in order to obtain a significant deposit. However, electrodeposition for several hours at −1.0 V resulted in a visible selenium deposit on the rim of the electrode. In the inset of Fig. 4(D) the bare area in the centre of the glassy carbon electrode is clearly visible. The origin of this void is unclear, but since the adhesion of selenium was quite poor, the structure might simply be a consequence of the electrode agitation during removal from the electrolyte. The tellurium deposit appeared very smooth and consisted of a homogeneous nanoparticulate film (Fig. 4(E)).
EDX spectra of the films shown in Fig. 4 are presented in Fig. 5. All deposited elements were detected in large quantities. The only contamination stemmed from chloride, which most likely originated from a small amount of trapped electrolyte species. It is expected that upon optimisation of the procedure these contaminations will be removed.

The film adhesion was better on the TiN electrodes than on the glassy carbon electrodes and more homogeneous films were obtained. Fig. 6 presents micrographs of the various deposits. In general, the films are very uniform.

The insets show overview images of the whole electrodes with the scale bars representing 1 mm. The deposition potentials and times were −1.3 V and 3600 s for indium (A), −1.2 V and 1800 s for antimony (B), −0.97 V and 1800 s for bismuth (C), −1 V and 3600 s for selenium (D) and −0.8 V and 1800 s for tellurium (E). The electrolytes are described in Fig. 3. 
EDX spectra of the deposited films on the TiN substrates are shown in Fig. 7. As for the films on glassy carbon, the only other significant peaks stem from the substrate. Chloride contamination is minimal (typically <1%). The only significant chloride content was found in the selenium film which was also the most challenging to deposit due to the non-metallic nature of elemental selenium.

The structures of the obtained elemental films were investigated using XRD. The diffraction data confirmed that the films were crystalline as-deposited and were similar on both, glassy carbon and TiN. Representative patterns for all deposited elements are presented in Fig. 8 and were consistent with previously reported data for the bulk elements. The experimental and literature data are presented in Table 1.

Electrodeposition of binary compounds
The preparation of materials, such as compound semiconductors or phase change materials, requires the preparation of binary or ternary compounds. The electrodeposition of indium antimonide (InSb) is thus presented as an example of a binary compound material deposited from this electrolyte system. Indium antimonide is a narrow band gap semiconductor used for infrared detectors. It has been electrodeposited previously from aqueous systems56 and from ionic liquids.57 Indium antimonide was deposited from an electrolyte containing 0.01 mol dm3 [NnBu4][InCl4], 2 × 10−3 mol dm−3 [NnBu4][SbCl4] and 0.1 mol dm−3 [NnBu4]Cl. The electrolyte composition was adjusted in order to get stoichiometric InSb according to EDX and XRD analysis. Using higher concentrations of [NnBu4][SbCl4] resulted in the presence of excess Sb in the deposits. The deposition time was also taken into account, as crystalline indium metal could be formed during longer deposition times.
A thin film of crystalline InSb was obtained at a constant deposition potential of −1.2 V. The deposition time was 100 s. An SEM image of the film, obtained on a TiN electrode is shown in Fig. 9(A). The obtained film is composed of a uniform powdery material. EDX analysis confirmed that the material was composed of In1Sb1 (50.6% In:49.4% Sb) (Fig. 9(B)). Some Cl (∼3%) is also evident. The XRD pattern showed that InSb was obtained in the cubic F3m form with a = 6.47(18) Å (Fig. 9(C)). The literature values for InSb were a = 6.4794(3) Å.58 The Raman spectrum also coincides well with that reported for InSb.59,60
 Fig. 9  SEM image (A), EDX spectrum (B), XRD data (C) and Raman spectrum (D) of an InSb film deposited onto a TiN electrode. The scale bar in (A) represents 10 μm, the inset shows an overview image of the whole electrode surface with the scale bar representing 1 mm. The XRD data were corrected to the zero point by a +0.25° shift. The red lines represent allowed reflection positions for InSb and the peaks labelled with blue Miller indices are due to the underlying TiN substrate. 
Conclusions
We present a simple and versatile electrolyte system consisting only of tetrabutylammonium chloride and tetrabutylammonium chlorometallate salts, suitable for the electrodeposition of a range of (crystalline) p-block elements from dichloromethane at room temperature. EDX and XRD analyses showed that the obtained films are of a high purity and could be deposited onto various conducting substrates, such as glassy carbon and titanium nitride. The formation of oxides is avoided by working with anhydrous electrolytes and under an inert atmosphere. The versatility of the system for electrodeposition of binary alloys was also demonstrated. Crystalline InSb was obtained. By combining the two chlorometallate precursors in the electrolyte solution in appropriate ratios and by adjusting the deposition potential, the desired 1:1 stoichiometric phase was obtained.
This electrochemical system opens up the possibility to prepare other binary and ternary materials useful for electronics applications, such as compound semiconductors, thermoelectric and phase change materials. The ‘bottom-up’ electrodeposition process could also allow the preparation of these materials onto complex nanostructured substrates, providing significant advantages over conventional techniques, such as CVD and PVD. Optimisation of the deposition of specific alloys and their electrical characterisation will be the focus of our further work.

 	Fig. 1  Cartoon of the steps involved in the preparation of area-defined TiN electrodes. Top and cross section-views, not drawn to scale. A first layer of resist was applied to the silicon wafer (A) in order to define individual electrode chips and avoid current leaking at the electrode edges (B). A TiN film was then deposited onto the patterned wafer (C). This was followed by a lift-off process which removed the resist using acetone and exposed the grid regions (D). A second layer of resist was applied to define the contact and electrode areas (E) before a layer of SiO2 was deposited as insulator (F). A second lift-off process was performed, by removing the resist with acetone (G). The TiN electrodes were cut into individual chips and washed with acetone and isopropanol before the electrochemical experiments.
