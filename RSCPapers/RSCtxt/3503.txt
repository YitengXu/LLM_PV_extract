    , Accepted 22nd October 2012First published on 6th November 2012AbstractWe introduce a straightforward route to the fabrication of metal sulfide semiconductor (e.g. CdS, Sb2S3, Bi2S3) sensitised TiO2 films. Our approach is based upon the controllable thermal decomposition of a single-source metal xanthate precursor on a mesoporous metal oxide film. The growth of the metal sulfide deposit is confirmed by Raman and UV-Vis steady-state absorption measurements. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements provide evidence for charge separation across the metal sulfide/TiO2 interface. Moreover, a high yield of long-lived photogenerated charges is observed in a three-component TiO2/metal sulfide/spiro-OMeTAD film, thus demonstrating the potential of such multicomponent films for solar energy conversion devices.
Semiconductor-sensitised mesoporous metal oxide films are currently attracting considerable attention for the development of low-cost, scalable and robust solar cell technologies.1–5 Interest in the use of inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (e.g. quantum dots) as light harvesting materials has been driven by the potential to extend the light harvesting capability of conventional molecular dye-sensitised devices from the visible to the near-IR region of the solar spectrum thereby improving the photocurrent response of the device. Specifically, the use of such inorganic semiconductors offers the attractive possibility of tailoring the light absorption profile by choosing between the wide range of available semiconductors and/or taking advantage of the band-gap modification induced by quantum size effects. So far, a wide variety of inorganic nanocrystals have been used as light absorbers in semiconductor-sensitised solar cells (SSSCs) including metal sulfides, selenides and phosphides.2,6–8 For example, solar-energy to electrical power conversion efficiencies exceeding 6% (under AM 1.5 solar illumination) have been recently reported for SSSCs based upon antimony sulfide sensitised TiO2 films employing a low band-gap hole transport material (HTM) ((PCPDTBT) (poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole)).9 In the quest to exploit these new materials to the optimum it has become evident that the interfacial charge transfer processes (charge separation and recombination) in such nanocrystal-sensitised films play a key role in determining the performance of SSSCs.10 As such, the realisation of efficient SSSC devices ultimately requires the development of fabrication and processing methods for SSSC photoactive layers that allow control of interface structure and function.
At present, there are two main methods used to fabricate quantum dot sensitised mesoporous metal oxide films: (i) chemical solution deposition,11 which includes SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction) and chemical bath deposition, and (ii) the adsorption of pre-synthesised nanoparticles,4 either of which may be followed by thermal annealing. Chemical solution deposition is based upon the reaction between the anion and the cation of the desired product leading to nucleation and growth of the semiconductor on the surface of the mesoporous metal oxide film.2 The key advantages of chemical solution deposition are the simplicity of its implementation and the range of accessible materials. However, such fabrication routes offer little or no control on key properties such as size and shape of the particles formed. Moreover, in the case of SILAR, multiple cycles are typically required to achieve sufficient optical absorbance needed for efficient device performance, thereby making this route too time-consuming to implement in large-scale device fabrication. The second method widely used to fabricate semiconductor sensitised metal oxide films involves the adsorption of quantum dots (QDs) synthesised in solution, typically by hot injection methods.12 Here, the surface of the mesoporous metal oxide film is typically coated with a bifunctional linker such as mercapto propionic acid followed by adsorption of the QD on the linker layer. Although this method offers better control of the chemical environment (relative to chemical solution deposition) at the QD/metal oxide heterojunction, the use of a bifunctional linker to couple QDs to surfaces has been shown to have a strong influence on the primary charge separation reaction at such QD/metal oxide interfaces, thereby limiting device performance.13 Furthermore, a low surface coverage is usually obtained when following this fabrication route, potentially limiting the light harvesting efficiency and device performance.
In this paper we present an alternative approach for the fabrication of semiconductor sensitised TiO2 films. Our strategy is based upon the thermal decomposition of metal xanthates on the TiO2 surface. Xanthates, or O-alkyl dithiocarbonato metal complexes, have been widely used as complexing agents for metals as well as for mineral extraction from ores.14 More recently, they have been employed as precursors for chemical vapour deposition (CVD)15 and metal sulfide nanoparticles synthesis.16–18 Additionally, metal xanthate based precursors have been used for the in situ formation of cadmium sulfide and copper indium disulfide nanoparticles in semiconducting polymers, providing a facile route to the formation of hybrid bulk heterojunctions for solar photovoltaic conversion.19–22 However, the use of metal xanthates to generate metal sulfide semiconductors on metal oxide surfaces has not been explored to date. In this paper we investigate the use of such xanthate based precursors for the preparation of metal sulfide sensitised/TiO2 films. To demonstrate the versatility of our method we fabricate CdS/TiO2, Sb2S3/TiO2 and Bi2S3/TiO2 films. Raman and steady-state absorption spectroscopy studies confirm the presence of the metal sulfide deposit on the mesoporous TiO2 film. Transient absorption spectroscopy studies demonstrate efficient and charge photogeneration and long charge lifetimes at the TiO2/metal sulfide and TiO2/metal sulfide/spiro-OMeTAD ((2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) heterojunctions.
Our simple fabrication method for metal sulfide/TiO2 films is illustrated in Fig. 1. The metal xanthates employed in this study are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The pyridine adduct of cadmium ethyl-xanthate, Cd(S2COEt)2(C5H4N)2, antimony ethyl xanthate, Sb(S2COEt)3, and bismuth ethyl-xanthate, Bi(S2COEt)3 were synthesised according to published procedures.19,23,24 They were recrystallised from hot chlorobenzene, washed with diethyl ether and dried under a nitrogen flow. Nanocrystalline nanoporous TiO2 films were prepared on glass substrates by doctor blading a commercial paste (Solaronix T37) as previously reported.2 The metal xanthate was dissolved in chlorobenzene, at a concentration of 400 mg ml−1 for the cadmium xanthate, 300 mg ml−1 for the antimony xanthate, and 300 mg ml−1 for the bismuth xanthate, and spun cast into the pores of the TiO2 film as illustrated in Fig. 1. The as-spun films were then thermally annealed at 200 °C (the decomposition temperatures of the xanthates used having been determined to be below this temperature19,25) or above on a hotplate in a nitrogen filled glovebox for 30 minutes to generate the metal sulfide on the TiO2 film as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  (a) and (b) Show the chemical structures of the metal xanthate compounds used in this study (where M = Bi or Sb). (d) Shows a schematic representation of the method developed herein to obtain semiconductor sensitised mesoporous titanium dioxide films; together with a picture (c) of the films obtained after annealing at 200 °C (from left to right: bare TiO2 film, TiO2/CdS film, TiO2/Sb2S3 film, TiO2/Bi2S3 film). 
To obtain evidence for the formation of the metal sulfide crystallites on the mesoporous TiO2 film Raman spectroscopy studies were undertaken. Experimental details of the Raman measurements are given in the ESI† of this paper. Typical Raman data obtained are shown in Fig. 2. In all cases the peaks due to the TiO2 film are evident (marked by asterisks). For the cadmium xanthate sensitised sample (Fig. 2(i)), a strong longitudinal phonon peak at 300 cm−1, consistent with previous work,26 and the much weaker overtone near 600 cm−1, partially masked by one of the anatase TiO2 peaks, indicates the presence of cadmium sulfide CdS. Fig. 2(ii) shows the Raman spectrum of the Sb2S3 sensitised TiO2 film. The three sharp peaks observed at ∼240, ∼280 and ∼310 cm−1 are consistent with the presence of antimony sulfide.27 The bands at 280 and 310 cm−1 have been attributed to Sb–S symmetric stretching vibration and anti-symmetric stretching modes respectively, while the 240 cm−1 one can be assigned to a symmetric S–Sb–S bending mode.28 Similarly, Fig. 2(iii) shows the Raman spectrum of the bismuth sulfide sample annealed at 200 °C showing two strong peaks, at ∼240 cm−1 and 260 cm−1, characteristic of Bi–S anti-symmetric stretching vibration in bismuthinite, Bi2S3.28 Thus we can conclude that in each case the deposition process has resulted in films containing crystalline grains of the metal sulfide.

The steady state UV-visible absorption spectroscopy performed after annealing is shown in Fig. 3. Bare TiO2 films are transparent and colourless in the visible region, showing a characteristic absorption increase below approximately 400 nm due to the onset of TiO2 band-gap excitation; the reduced transmission at wavelengths above 400 nm being mainly due to scattering of the film. Fig. 3(ii–iv) shows the characteristic absorption spectra of the CdS, Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 TiO2 films respectively. The absorption spectrum of the CdS/TiO2 displays a peak, at ∼460 nm, which indicates the presence of particles exhibiting quantum confinement effects.29 On the other hand, the absorption onset is located at 510 nm, thus a distribution of particle sizes can be expected in this sample. It is also apparent from the data shown in Fig. 3 that the resulting Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 deposits consist of a broad and inhomogeneous distribution of crystallite sizes, as highlighted by the absence of a discrete absorption peak. However, it is pertinent to note that the amplitude of absorption of the metal sulfide coated samples is similar to those fabricated by a SILAR procedure involving 10–15 cycles,30 underlining the efficiency of our method in sensitising mesoporous TiO2. The effect of thermal annealing temperature of metal xanthate precursor was further investigated. The results of these studies are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). It is evident from the data presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) that the absorption of CdS is both increased and red-shifted with increasing temperature indicating an increase in coverage and mean particle size (i.e. decrease in quantum confinement). Moreover, TAUC analysis (see Fig. S2, ESI†) of the absorption spectra leads to an estimated band-gap of 2.44 eV and 2.07 eV for the Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 sensitised samples respectively. It is noteworthy that these values are only indicative due to a particle size distribution as discussed above. However, these values are in agreement with literature values (e.g. for antimony sulfide films or powders,31,32 and for Sb2S3 thin films thermally evaporated onto ZnO).33 SEM images are also included in Fig. S3 (ESI†) showing a typical TiO2 film before and after sensitisation with the metal sulfide.

We now turn to the interfacial charge transfer kinetics in the metal sulfide/TiO2 films in the absence and presence of a spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting material. Specifically, microsecond to millisecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used to probe the charge generation and recombination in the cadmium and antimony sulfide sensitised films. Details of the transient absorption apparatus have been described previously34 and are provided in the ESI† of this manuscript. Fig. 4a and b (insets) show the transient absorption spectra of CdS and Sb2S3 sensitised TiO2 films respectively, recorded 10 μs after photoexcitation. The spectra obtained for both samples exhibit a broad absorption band centred at ∼650–750 nm, consistent with the formation of holes located on the sulfur orbitals of the metal sulfide35,36 as a result of electron injection from the nanocrystal sensitiser into the conduction band of TiO2. Similar features have been reported for other metal sulfide/TiO2 composites formed using SILAR procedures.30 In order to obtain further evidence for charge separation in our metal sulfide/TiO2 composites, control experiments were conducted using a mesoporous ZrO2 electrode (in place of TiO2). The conduction band of ZrO2 lies ∼0.5 eV above that of TiO2, and is known to prohibit electron transfer from both dye and nanoparticle sensitisers.37,38 The absence of any transient absorption signal for the ZrO2 based samples further confirms the presence of photoinduced charge separation in the CdS/TiO2 and Sb2S3/TiO2 samples. The charge recombination dynamics were monitored by observing the decay of the photoinduced absorption band at ∼650–700 nm. The decay trace shown in Fig. 4a follows the charge recombination between the photogenerated electrons, transferred to the TiO2, and holes in CdS. Likewise, the data shown in Fig. 4b follows the charge recombination between the photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 and the holes in the Sb2S3. We note that no rise in the transient absorption signal is observed indicating that the charge separation reaction occurs on timescales faster than the instrument response of our laser system (instrument response function ∼250 ns); consistent with the reported ultrafast nature the of electron injection process at sensitiser/TiO2 interfaces.39 The recombination half time, t50% (defined as the time taken for 50% of the initial photogenerated carrier population to decay back to the ground state) is found to be ∼100 μs and 80 μs for CdS and Sb2S3 samples respectively. These findings clearly demonstrate the presence of long-lived charge separation across the donor–acceptor heterojunction. We note that, no noticeable injection could be recorded for Bi2S3/TiO2 composites. This observation is consistent with an unfavourable energy level alignment at the Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction, in agreement with previous work.40

(b) Shows the transient absorption kinetics trace recorded at 700 nm for Sb2S3/TiO2 (black) and Sb2S3/ZrO2 (red) using an excitation wavelength of 510 nm and a laser fluency of 20 μJ cm−2.

In order to further characterise charge separation in these systems, and to assess their potential in solar energy conversion systems (e.g. SSSCs), samples comprising a hole transporting material (HTM), namely spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, Merck), were investigated. The hole conductor was introduced into the pores of the metal sulfide sensitised TiO2 films by spin-coating, from a chlorobenzene solution containing 0.17 M Spiro-OMeTAD, 10 mM Li(CF3SO2)2N (bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonamide and 19 mM tert-butylpyridine as previously reported.41Fig. 5 (inset) shows the typical transient absorption spectrum obtained following pulsed excitation of the metal sulfide/TiO2 films at 450 nm. The spectrum shown in Fig. 5 is consistent with the formation of oxidised spiro-OMeTAD as a result of hole transfer from the metal sulfide to the organic hole transporting material.42 The decay traces shown in Fig. 5 (main panel) follow the charge recombination reaction between the photoinjected electrons in the TiO2 and holes in the spiro-OMeTAD. The electron–hole recombination half-time (t50%) across the TiO2/metal sulfide/spiro-OMeTAD heterojunction was determined to be t50% ∼ 20 and 10 ms for CdS and Sb2S3 samples respectively. The amplitude of the signal (ΔOD) in Fig. 5 is related to the number of absorbing species (in this case spiro-OMeTAD+) and therefore is a measure of the yield of charge photogeneration. Moreover, an extinction coefficient of 22800 M−1 cm−1 at 1600 nm has been reported for the oxidised spiro-OMeTAD allowing the determination of the number of holes generated per photon absorbed.41 In this way, we find that the spiro-OMeTAD+ yield for both TiO2/CdS/spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD is ∼50%, as calculated by methods previously reported.43 The reason for an observed reduced yield in this study in comparison to other systems, which report numbers in excess of 80%,41 could be due to either limited electron injection from the sensitiser to the metal oxide, resulting in a reduced number of holes available to be transferred to the HTM, or could be due to an inherent low hole transfer yield. Suboptimal energy level alignment between the sensitiser and the metal oxide could be the cause of the limited electron injection, which could likely be improved by either replacing TiO2 with a more suitable alternative such as SnO2,43 or, for example, by tuning the density of states using lithium salts.44 We note that further improvements in the yield of charge separation at the TiO2/metal sulfide/spiro-OMeTAD heterojunction can be expected through the implementation of a range of interface engineering strategies recently developed for dye-sensitised solar cells.10 It is noteworthy that the lifetime of hole species are remarkably long-lived in comparison with typical DSSCs, which should help to obtain a large Voc in devices.

(inset) Shows the transient absorption spectrum at 10 μs recorded for the TiO2/CdS/HTM sample. 
In summary, we have reported a straight-forward method for the fabrication of metal sulfide sensitised mesoporous TiO2 films. Our approach is based on the controlled thermal decomposition of a metal xanthate on the surface of the metal oxide films. We have used this approach for the design and fabrication of CdS, Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 sensitised TiO2 films. Transient absorption spectroscopy studies confirm charge separation in TiO2/metal sulfide and TiO2/metal sulfide/spiro-OMeTAD films. The present findings demonstrate that the in situ thermal decomposition of single-source precursors such as metal xanthates offers a versatile and scalable route to inorganic and hybrid nanocomposites for solar energy conversion devices. Finally, we conclude that our simple method may be applicable to the design and fabrication of a range of alternative metal sulfide materials and metal sulfide/TiO2 composites.
