The transmittance change spectrum acquired immediately after pumping is dominated by a bleach blue-shifted by ∼200–300 nm from the photoluminescent emission band. Comparison with a tight-binding model of the electronic structure allows this feature to be attributed to the filling of band edge states. The form of the pump-induced transmittance transients is dependent on the excitation rate and the rate of sample stirring. For moderate pumping of stirred samples, the transmittance transients are well-described by a mono-exponential decay associated with biexciton recombination, with a lifetime of 49 ± 2 ps. For samples that are strongly-pumped or unstirred, the decay becomes bi-exponential in form, indicating that trap-related recombination has become significant. We also present a new analysis that enables fractional transmittance changes to be related to band edge occupation for samples with arbitrary optical density at the pump wavelength. This allows us to identify the occurrence of multiple exciton generation, which results in a quantum yield of 1.36 ± 0.04 for a photon energy equivalent to 3.1 times the band gap, in good agreement with the results of the model.
1. Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with a near-infrared band gap, Eg, have a number of potential applications.1,2 In particular, their absorption edge can be size-tuned to the optimum spectral region for exploitation of the solar spectrum, approximately 900–1100 nm.3,4 In recent years, a number of different types of near-infrared QDs have been investigated as the potential photo-absorbers in solar cells, including PbX (X = S, Se, and Te),5–14 InAs8,15,16 and HgTe.4,17–25 Of these, HgTe QDs are unique because bulk HgTe is a semi-metal with a small negative band gap, Eg, of −0.15 eV17,26 i.e. the valence and conduction bands overlap by a small amount.27,28 In HgTe QDs quantum confinement causes a size-dependent increase in the effective Eg, moving it from a negative value towards an increasingly positive one as the size of the QDs decreases.17,29 Thus the Eg of HgTe QDs, in contrast to those of PbX and InAs QDs, is dominated completely by confinement, enabling size-tunability across the IR and NIR4,19–24,26,30–35 and hence optimization for solar cell efficiency.
Furthermore, a recent theoretical study36 has also shown that the process of multiple exciton generation (MEG) is predicted to be particularly efficient in semimetal QDs. MEG (sometimes known as carrier multiplication) is the process by which some or all of the energy of an absorbed photon in excess of Eg is used to create additional electron–hole pairs instead of being wasted as heat.37 The equivalent effect in bulk materials is impact ionization, an inverse Auger process, which is exploited in cadmium mercury telluride avalanche photodiodes.38 The additional excitons created by MEG can contribute to photocurrent and thus improve the efficiency of solar cells based on colloidal QDs.8 However, the overall efficiency of a QD-based solar cell depends on the recombination rate of photo-generated charges within the dots, which can be dominated by non-radiative sub-nanosecond processes.39,40 Furthermore, the assessment of MEG efficiency requires a full understanding of multi-exciton dynamics and interactions.40–42 Hence, we present here for the first time a study of sub-nanosecond exciton dynamics in HgTe QDs, which we use to identify the occurrence of MEG and determine its efficiency.
2. Methodology
2.1 Preparation of samples
HgTe QDs were synthesised in water using a technique described previously.18 The materials used were mercury perchlorate hydrate, mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), tellurium, concentrated sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide (all from Sigma Aldrich) and 18.5 MΩ deionised water.
A small amount of an aqueous solution of MPA (52 mM) was prepared and deaerated by stirring and bubbling through a stream of argon (or oxygen-free nitrogen) for about 1 h. After that an amount of mercury perchlorate was added so that the metal salt concentration was fixed at 18 mM and the pH, which was adjusted with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution, was fixed at 10.8. The flask was then sealed and deaerated for a further hour until the metal salt was fully solvated and the solution remained clear and colourless. An electrolysis cell was prepared beforehand in a separate three neck flask for the generation of hydrogen telluride gas. This cell was fitted with a sleeved platinum electrode (anode) filled with a gas vent to allow the oxygen by-product to be removed from the cell before making any contact with the main body of the electrolyte solution. This solution was made up of 50% concentrated sulphuric acid solution. Alternatively other mineral acids may also be used.43 The cathode was fabricated from a fused rod of tellurium that protruded from the end of a glass tube which was sealed above the tellurium plug. It was positioned in a place so that the tip was dipped a few mm below the mean level of the electrolyte. The electrolyte was purged prior to use by passing argon in series through the electrolysis cell and following that through the main reaction flask. Deaeration is required throughout the operation, which typically takes several hours.
HgTe QDs were grown by passing hydrogen telluride, buffered in an argon gas stream, through the main reaction flask. The gas was produced at the electrolysis cell cathode along with hydrogen in approximately 0.45:0.55 ratio. To drive the electrolysis cell, a power supply (TTi PL303 QMD-P 30 V, 3 A) was used operating in current-regulated mode. The operating currents typically ranged from 10 to 30 mA depending upon the reaction volume. The total dose of H2Te used was far below the stoichiometric ratio to fully complete the conversion of the metal salt to HgTe. A range of QD sizes and thus bandgap energies can be obtained by taking aliquots at various time intervals during the growth. Initially, the monitored fluorescence peak appeared at around 750–800 nm and then shifted to longer wavelengths by between 50 and 100 nm per day under the conditions used. For this study, samples with an absorption edge within the optimum range for exploitation of the solar spectrum were grown, and were prepared in cuvettes by diluting the synthesised solutions with water or D2O so that the band-edge absorbance was ∼0.2–0.5. The steady-state absorption spectra of the HgTe QDs were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra using an Edinburgh Instruments F900 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a Hamamatsu InP/InGaAs photomultiplier tube.
2.2 Experimental technique
Ultrafast transient absorption is a pump–probe experiment which has been used to study sub-nanosecond exciton dynamics and multi-exciton effects for a number of years.8,14,44,45 This spectrally and time-resolved method measures the transmittance of a sample in the presence of a pulsed pump beam providing information on electronic energies, carrier cooling and recombination, and the distribution of photoexcited carriers.44 Initially, a pump beam forms hot excitons then a pulsed probe beam with low intensity measures the average number of excitons per QD. The number of excitons is measured here as a function of the time delay between the arrival of the pump and probe beams which is controlled by varying the difference of the optical path length of the beams.8
The set-up of the ultrafast transient absorption experiment has been described elsewhere10,37,39,40 and so here we provide only a brief overview. Mode-locked (100 fs) laser pulses at 800 nm produced by a Ti:sapphire oscillator (Spectra-Physics Tsunami) were amplified using a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spectra Physics SpitfirePro) in order to produce pulses with 100 fs width and energy of 1 mJ at 1 kHz. The laser output was then split into two parts: the first of which contains 95% of the beam and was used as the pump beam either directly or after nonlinear conversion to a wavelength of 400 nm. The remaining 5% was passed through a 2 mm thick sapphire crystal generating a white light continuum which was then split into sample and reference arms. The former was focussed to a 1 mm spot size at the sample under investigation whereas the latter bypassed the sample. Both reference and sample beams were balanced without any pump beam using a variable neutral density filter and then were guided to a monochromator (SpectraPro 2500i) in order to be detected by two silicon photodiodes. The samples under study were stirred using a magnetic stirrer (Thermo Scientific, Variomag Mini) at 1000 rpm throughout the experiment, unless otherwise stated. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the pump pulses were modulated using a mechanical chopper at 500 Hz synchronised to a digital lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830) which hence only amplified any pump-induced difference in the signal between sample and reference beams. A 200 mm long delay stage (Newport ILS) controlled the time-delay between pump and probe beams.
2.3 Calculations
A tight-binding model presented previously46 was used to calculate the electronic structure of a spherical HgTe QD 3.5 nm in diameter corresponding to Eg = 1.0 eV. In turn, this was used to calculate the density of states and the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of QDs of this size. To simulate the effect of size dispersion in an ensemble of QDs, absorbance and PL spectra were calculated with Gaussian peaks located at the spectral position corresponding to each transition. The width, w, of each peak was found to increase linearly with energy, E, as 
w = a + b(E − E1)
(1)where E1 is the energy of the band edge transition, and a and b are fitting parameters.
The tight-binding model was also used to calculate the MEG quantum yield, MEG QY, following closely the methodology described in ref. 47. We simulate numerically first the absorption of a photon in a QD and second the cooling of photo-excited carriers either by impact ionization or by emission of phonons, the two processes being in competition. At a given photon of energy, hν, we consider the large number of configurations of the electron–hole pair allowed by the optical absorption process. The probability to be in a certain configuration is given by the oscillator strength of the transition. Then, for each excited carrier and each initial state of energy Ei, we consider all possible impact ionization relaxation channels leading to MEG. The impact ionization rate is calculated using the Fermi golden rule to be W = 2π|Vif|2ρf(Ei)/ℏ where ρf(Ei) is the density of final states and Vif is the matrix element of the screened Coulomb interaction.48 The final states correspond to the situations where the hot electron is relaxed to lower energy and where an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band, the situation being symmetric for the hole. The initial and final states are defined by Slater determinants built from the single-particle states calculated in tight-binding. The screened electron–electron interaction is calculated in the random-phase approximation49,50 including the full frequency dependence.36,51 The QD surfaces are completely passivated by pseudo-hydrogen atoms,46 reflecting the good passivation of our samples. As shown in ref. 47 for PbSe QDs, the state-density function ρf largely determines the energy dependence of the impact ionization rate in HgTe QDs. Using the calculated impact ionization rates, we have simulated numerically the relaxation of the hot carriers to deduce the MEG QY. We assume that the lifetime of the phonon-assisted relaxation, τph, is a constant independent of the energy of the carrier. Previous studies on PbSe and PbS nanocrystals have shown that τph in the picosecond range provides results in good agreement with experiments.47,52,53
This approach to simulate the MEG is based on the impact ionization model47,54,55 initially developed for bulk materials.51 However, other models were proposed to explain the MEG in QDs as reviewed in the introduction of ref. 53. The direct photo-generation of bi-excitons through virtual (bi-)exciton states was proposed56,57 but detailed calculations predict a low efficiency of this process.53,58 Excitation to a coherent superposition of multi-exciton states was also suggested59 but this model neglects important dephasing effects in the multi-exciton state.60 A recent work53 including all these models as limiting cases has concluded that there is no interference between multi-exciton photo-generation pathways (fast dephasing) and therefore the impact ionization remains the main mechanism of MEG, supporting our present approach.
All the calculations presented here concern spherical QDs. However, we have shown in ref. 46 that the energy gap and the optical absorption spectrum of HgTe QDs with cubic, tetrahedral, or octahedral shape are very close to that of spherical QDs with the same volume. As a consequence, the MEG QY is almost the same for all these QD shapes because the impact ionization rate is mainly governed by the density of final states ρf which does not depend too much on details of the density of single-particle states.52,61 Of course, this statement is only true when the shape of the QDs is not too far from a sphere, it cannot be applied to nanorods for example.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Electronic structure
Fig. 1 shows the absorption and PL spectra of a typical sample of HgTe QDs. In this case, the PL peaks at 1176 nm and has a full width half maximum of about 200 nm, whilst the absorption spectrum shows a broad shoulder Stokes-shifted from the PL peak by 200–300 nm to shorter wavelengths; the second derivative of this shoulder (see Fig.S1, ESI†) has a minimum at about 900 nm indicating the presence of a peak there. Empirical relationships established by others between QD size and the position of this shoulder23or the PL peak,22 supported by the results of our tight-binding model reported previously,46 allow the average QD diameter to be estimated to be 3–4 nm for the sample shown in Fig. 1.

A comparison with the results of our electronic structure calculations allows these spectral features to be understood. Fig. 2a shows the calculated density of states as a function of energy for a spherical HgTe QD of diameter 3.5 nm. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valance band maximum (VBM) are separated by Eg = 1.0 eV in this case. The CBM has a relatively low density and is at significantly lower energy than the next lowest conduction band state (CBM-1). In contrast, the states at and near the VBM are much more closely spaced whilst broadly growing in density the further they get from the VBM. The effect of this band structure on absorption and photoluminesence is evident in Fig. 2b which shows the spectra calculated for a single QD and also for an ensemble of QDs with a distribution of sizes.
 Fig. 2  Calculated (a) density of states, and (b) absorption and PL spectra of HgTe QDs; the black and green lines represent the spectra of a single QD of 3.5 nm diameter whilst the red and pink lines correspond to an ensemble of QDs with an average diameter of 3.5 nm but whose spectra are broadened by size dispersion. 
The excellent agreement between the experimental spectra and those calculated for the ensemble demonstrates that our model describes the electronic structure of HgTe QDs well, and allows us to attribute a value of Eg = 1.0 eV for the sample. In particular, Fig. 2 shows that absorption at the band edge (i.e. a VBM to CBM transition) is comparatively weak whilst the absorption shoulder occurs at an energy that allows transitions to CBM-1 (as well as to the CBM from deeper within the valance band). We thus attribute the steady-state PL shown in Fig. 1 to a band edge, CBM-to-VBM transition, whilst the peak of the absorption shoulder corresponds either to a VBM to CBM-1 transition or to a transition to the CBM from deeper within the valance band (or to a combination of both).
Fig. 3 shows the pump-induced transmittance change, ΔT/T, spectrum of a sample of HgTe QDs taken at the time when it is at its maximum amplitude (typically ∼6 picoseconds after pumping). Similar spectra (see Fig. S2, ESI†) taken for samples of pure water, D2O and MPA show no response over the same spectral region, confirming that the spectrum shown in Fig. 3 is due to the response of the HgTe QDs only. As shown in Appendix A, state-filling produces a bleach (i.e. positive ΔT/T) in the transmittance spectrum of QDs which depends on the product of the absorption cross-section at the probe wavelength and the occupation of the states involved, which is at a maximum after the photo-generated charges have cooled to the band edge and before significant recombination has occurred. The ΔT/T spectrum in Fig. 3 shows a relatively weak bleaching at the band edge and much stronger bleach at wavelengths corresponding to the peak of the absorption shoulder seen in Fig. 1. This is consistent with the calculated dependence of absorption strength on wavelength and also demonstrates that the absorption shoulder corresponds to a transition involving either the VBM or CBM because by this time carrier cooling is complete and therefore other states in the valance and conduction bands are unoccupied by holes and electrons, respectively.

3.2 Excitonic dynamics
Fig. 4 shows the bleach transients induced by a range of average pump powers between 0.4 mW and 1 mW, where the pump and probe wavelengths are 400 nm and 900 nm, respectively. The decline of the peak value is well-described by a mono-exponential decay to a plateau, and a global fit to the transients shown yields a time constant of 49 ± 2 ps. Similar transients were also obtained for a pump wavelength of 800 nm (see Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Fractional transmittance change, ΔT/T, transients induced in HgTe QDs by a pump beam of wavelength 400 nm with a range of average powers. A global mono-exponential fit to the decays is also shown. 
The absorption cross-section at the shoulder, σ, for a HgTe QD has been determined previously23 and can be used to estimate the average number of photons absorbed per QD per pump pulse, 〈N〉 – see ESI† for details. For example, for pumping at a wavelength of 400 nm with an average power of 1 mW, which corresponds to the largest amplitude transient shown in Fig. 4, this calculation yields 〈N〉 ∼ 0.6. This value can be used to calculate the expected ratio of the peak and plateau amplitudes, R, if the mono-exponential decay is due to recombination of biexcitons:5 
(2)where QY corresponds to the average number of excitons generated per absorbed photon; without MEG QY = 1, and with MEG QY > 1. (The approximate expression on the right-hand side is valid for 〈N〉 ≪ 1.) For 〈N〉 ∼ 0.6, eqn (1) gives R/QY ∼ 1.3, which is consistent with the experimentally observed ratio for a QY value also of ∼1.3. We therefore attribute the decay of pump-induced bleaches shown in Fig. 4 to the recombination of biexcitons with a lifetime of 49 ± 2 ps, and the plateau value of the bleaches is attributed to the remaining single excitons, the lifetime of which is typically longer than 1 ns in QDs.62 The low ΔT/T values of these 〈N〉 suggest that the VBM to CBM-1 transition dominates at the absorption shoulder because, as shown in Fig. 2, the VBM has a significantly greater density of states than the CBM, resulting in a lower occupation and hence bleach for the same value of 〈N〉.
For higher pump powers the form of the bleach decay changes indicating that another process becomes significant under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, the transient develops an additional initial decay component of significant amplitude, and is now no longer well-described by a mono-exponential. A bi-exponential fit to the transient obtained for 2 mW of pump power and a stirred sample is also shown in Fig. 5, where one of the time constants was fixed at the bi-exciton lifetime of this sample, i.e. 49 ps. Under these conditions, the fit yielded a value of 4.7 ± 0.2 ps for the additional time constant.

The processes other than multi-exciton recombination that can lead to sub-nanosecond bleach decays have been studied in a number of different QD types, including: CdSe,42,63 InAs/ZnSe,40 ZnTe/ZnSe,39 and PbSe.12,64 It has become clear from these studies that two distinct processes, both associated with surface states, can be the cause of significant bleach decay on this time-scale. The first such process to be identified was trion decay, and was responsible for the experimental artefacts that led to much of the controversy surrounding early reports of MEG.12 Here one or the other of the photo-generated charges becomes trapped on the QD surface for a period longer than the time between pump pulses, with the geminate charge remaining within the volume of the QD. Thus, when a photon is absorbed during a subsequent pump pulse, a trion is pumped from the exciton just formed and the geminate charge. Trions, like multi-excitons but unlike single excitons, can recombine via an efficient Auger process and have a lifetime similar to that of a biexciton. They thus can produce a bleach decay on the sub-nanosecond time-scales investigated in this study. However, studies12,41,64 have shown that vigorous stirring or flowing of the sample can reduce or eliminate trion formation by continually sweeping previously pumped QDs from the excitation volume and thus preventing the accumulation of long-lived surface-trapped charges. The second process39,40,63 to be identified is the direct de-population of electrons (holes) from the conduction (valence) band to a trap-site on a sub-nanosecond time-scale, which results in a reduction in state-filling and thus a decay in the observed bleach. This differs from the first process in that it does not rely on the accumulation of trapped charges that persist in the excitation volume between pump pulses and hence is not affected by stirring or flowing the sample. The presence of a photo-induced absorption (PA), i.e. a negative ΔT/T, near the band-edge has also been shown to be associated with samples for which this process of direct, sub-nanosecond depopulation of the bands is significant.39,40,63
Fig. 5 compares the bleach transients obtained at different pump powers for static samples and samples stirred at 1000 rpm. There is a significant difference between the stirred and static transients at high pump powers (corresponding to high rates of surface-trapping), which is consistent with the bi-exponential form of the decay at these excitation rates. At low pump powers, however, stirring has no significant effect on the transient, which retains the mono-exponential form of its decay even when the sample is static. From these results, coupled with the absence of any PA (see Fig. 3) and the consistency of the observed value of R with the calculation of 〈N〉, we conclude that for this sample the bleach decay is dominated by bi-exciton recombination at low pump powers but at high pump powers trion recombination also becomes significant.
3.3 Multiple exciton generation
The formation of additional electron–hole pairs by MEG is limited by the conservation of energy; the threshold pump photon energy required to form one additional pair is at least equivalent to 2Eg, and each additional pair beyond that requires further energy at least equal to Eg. Thus for photon energies between 2Eg and 3Eg, MEG can result only in the formation of a bi-exciton which, as discussed above, subsequently decays into a single exciton on a sub-nanosecond time-scale. In transmittance transients, this is manifested as a sub-nanosecond mono-exponential decay from the peak to a plateau observed for pump fluences corresponding to a negligible probability of a QD absorbing more than one photon per pump photon (at high pump fluences, a biexciton can also form by the absorption of two photons per pulse by an individual QD). Moreover, as can be seen from eqn (1), for vanishing pump fluences, and hence 〈N〉 values, the value of R is equivalent to QY, with a value >1 corresponding to MEG.
As described in the previous section, trap-related processes can also produce sub-nanosecond decay components that may be confused with biexciton recombination. However, our analysis of the bleach dynamics enables MEG in HgTe QDs to be reliably identified and the resulting QY is assessed. In particular, our HgTe QDs that do not exhibit PA were stirred vigorously throughout and pumped only at sufficiently low powers such that the bleach transient was always well-described by a mono-exponential decay to a plateau with a constant characteristic lifetime (or, in the case of low fluence pumping below the photon energy threshold for MEG, just a plateau). The production of biexcitons by the absorption of two photons by a single QD per pump pulse must also be allowed for to ensure that only biexcitons produced by MEG contribute to the calculation of QY. Previous studies have identified whether MEG has occurred by one of the two methods: (i) comparison of transients pumped above and below the threshold for MEG at similar levels of average excitation, i.e. 〈N〉,65 and (ii) extrapolation to the response for vanishing fluence from the R values obtained over a range of excitation levels.5 Since the pump-induced fractional transmittance change, ΔT/T, depends not only on 〈N〉 but also on the optical density of the sample at the pump wavelength, to ensure that the excitation levels for above and below MEG threshold pumping are indeed comparable, the first method requires taking into account the variation of sample absorbance of the pump, A, with wavelength. However, the dependence of ΔT/T on arbitrary values of A has not been established to date. This has necessitated the preparation of different samples for each pump wavelength, with the concentration of each adjusted to compensate for the increase of absorption coefficient with decreasing wavelength so that A for each is the same.65 In Appendix A, we derive a relationship between ΔT/T and the small values of 〈N〉 relevant here for arbitrary A. This enables experimental transients to be expressed in terms of only the occupation of the probed state, F = 〈N〉/g, where g is the degeneracy of that state, and thus allows the transients obtained for different pump wavelengths to be directly compared. Fig. 6 shows such a comparison of occupation transients obtained for pump beams of the same power but at different wavelengths, corresponding to excitation below and above the photon energy threshold for MEG. After initial excitation, the below threshold transient is a plateau, showing no decay on the time-scale of the experiment. This demonstrates that the sample is free of the trap-related processes that result in sub-nanosecond transmittance decay transients and confirms that F is sufficiently low to ensure that the probability of two photons being absorbed by a single QD during a pump pulse is negligible. In contrast, when the sample is pumped above the MEG threshold to an occupation level of the same order then a large biexciton decay feature is evident, corresponding to a magnitude of R significantly greater than 1.15 accounted for by the value of 〈N〉 ∼ 0.3 estimated for the transients shown. Fig. 6 also shows how R varies with ΔT/T for above threshold pumping. These data fit very well to eqn (2), further supporting the attribution of the observed decay feature as being caused by biexciton recombination. This fit also allows QY to be determined, and yields QY = 1.36 ± 0.04 for excitation at 3.1Eg, confirming the occurrence of MEG.
 Fig. 6  Peak to plateau ratio, R, of the transmittance transients induced by a pump beam of wavelength 3.1Eg for HgTe QDs as a function of pump-induced transmittance change, ΔT/T; the fit shown is for eqn (2). Inset: comparison of the occupation transients induced by a pump power of 0.5 mW and wavelengths 1.6Eg and 3.1Eg. The fit shown is to mono-exponential decay function with a time constant of 49 ps. 
Fig. 7 shows the calculated QY as a function of pump photon energy for three different values of τph; also shown for comparison is the experimentally measured QY. There is good agreement between measurement and calculation, and these results indicate that τph is ∼6 ps for these QDs. This value is consistent with the bleach rise-time after excitation by a pump pulse, as shown in Fig. 8, which corresponds to the time taken for hot excitons to cool to the band edge. Fig. 7 also shows that, while MEG occurs for a photon energy, hν, greater than 2Eg, the minimum allowed by conservation of energy, the QY does not begin to rise significantly until hν ∼ 2.5Eg. Nevertheless, the MEG performance of these HgTe QDs compares well with that of most other QD types studied to date. (As noted in ref. 8, the influence of the sub-nanosecond trap-related decay processes discussed above was not fully appreciated in the early studies of MEG, and hence only data from later studies which took measures to suppress them are reliable.) HgTe QDs perform better than the commonly studied Pb-chalcogenide QDs, the QY for which is typically ∼1.2 at hν ∼ 3Eg.66 The efficiency of InP QDs37 is similar to that reported here for HgTe QDs but their Eg lies outside the optimum range for exploitation of the solar spectrum. A QY ∼ 2 for hν > 2.6Eg has recently been reported67 for closely-packed arrays of Si nanocrystals in SiO2. However, in that case the authors propose that the additional excitons are directly generated in nanocrystals neighbouring the one that absorbed the photon. This proposed mechanism is thus distinct to the process occurring here in colloidal QDs, which are isolated from one another.

Fig. 7 also illustrates the important influence of the rate of carrier cooling on the QY of MEG. There has been an on-going debate about the relative efficiency of MEG in QDs compared to impact ionization in the corresponding bulk material and the role played by quantum confinement. Some authors claim that MEG is inherently more efficient than impact ionization in bulk materials,6 whilst others argue that the QY is actually reduced in QDs but there is nevertheless a potential benefit to solar cell efficiency because quantum confinement increases the effective band gap which enhances the photo-voltage obtainable from a device.52,68,69 It has also been argued8,70,71 that surface-mediated carrier cooling can be significant in QDs that are imperfectly passivated and that this can increase the total rate of carrier cooling, which competes with MEG, and thereby reduces QY and complicates its comparison to the efficiency of bulk impact ionization. Understanding and controlling the chemistry of the QD surface is thus key to optimising MEG QY. HgTe QDs, in common with many other colloidally grown QDs, tend to form metal-rich surfaces, i.e. the net stoichiometry of the dots is slightly weighted in favour of the metal. For our HgTe QDs (washed three times by precipitation and centrifugation to remove free metal ions) of this size, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy measurements typically yield Hg/Te ratios ranging from 1.3–1.4. The resulting overall positive charge arising from the metal/chalcogenide imbalance is compensated by the negative charge on the surrounding thiolate, formed by the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group of MPA at high pH. The overall charge on the QD–ligand complex is negative and it is this charge that prevents aggregation of the colloid. The lack of photo-induced absorption features in the transmittance change spectrum (Fig. 3) associated with surface traps, and the mono-exponential decay dynamics (for low pump powers) characteristic of trap-free recombination (Fig. 4) indicate that MPA is an effective passivant for HgTe QDs. However, significantly improved performance of a PbS QD-based solar cell has been achieved recently by passivation with chloride ions rather than an organic ligand;72 chloride ion passivation may also be a profitable approach for HgTe QDs, potentially further reducing surface-mediated cooling and thus improving MEG QY.
Apart from combining a high QY compared to other materials with a Eg that can be size-tuned to the optimum value for exploitation of the solar spectrum, HgTe QDs also benefit from an insensitivity to water and air exposure. All the samples studied here were prepared in aqueous solution and open to the atmosphere; in comparison, other QDs studied to date are susceptible to oxidation10 necessitating the use of anhydrous solvents and preparation under inert atmospheres. In particular, the PbSe QDs used in the first demonstration of a solar cell with an efficiency enhanced by MEG73 have been shown74 to rapidly oxidise on exposure to the ambient atmosphere. This process can result in the conversion of the outer 50% of the volume of the QD into an oxide shell with a large Eg, which surrounds a core of unoxidised PbSe now smaller than the original QD. This has the effect of significantly blue-shifting the absorption edge and introducing a barrier to charge extraction from the QD core, both of which can adversely affect solar cell performance. For this reason, the devices reported in ref. 73 were prepared under a helium atmosphere. The requirement of such procedures during production and a device design that ensures the QDs are sealed from the atmosphere for the lifetime of a device is likely to significantly increase the cost of solar cells based on this type of QD. The chemical stability of HgTe QDs, on the other hand, relaxes the need for these costly steps and so is likely to be an advantage for the manufacture of solar cells based on QDs.
4. Summary and conclusions
Exciton dynamics in HgTe QDs have been studied using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and elucidated using a tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The bleach feature in the pump-induced transmittance change spectrum was found to correspond not to the band edge transition but rather involved the VBM or CBM and states lying further away from the band edges. The decay of the transmittance transients observed corresponded to biexciton recombination for well-stirred samples pumped at moderate fluences. However, for higher pump powers or for unstirred samples the decay transients were found to correspond to a combination of biexciton recombination and surface-trapping.
The understanding of the exciton dynamics developed in this way, coupled with a new analysis of the dependence of transmittance change on optical density at the pump wavelength, has enabled the first identification of multiple exciton generation in HgTe QDs and a reliable assessment of their efficiency at hν ∼ 3Eg.
Appendix A
We derive an expression for ΔT/T taking into account the change in pump beam fluence due to absorption along its path through the sample. We start our derivation with the Beer–Lambert law in the following form 
J(z) = J0e−αz = J0e−σnz
(3)where J(z) is the fluence of the probe beam at a distance z, through the sample, J0 is the initial fluence of the probe beam, α and σ are the absorption coefficient and cross section at the probe wavelength, respectively, and n is the total number of QDs per unit volume. Hence, for unexcited samples we write 
(4)However for an excited sample of QDs, state-filling reduces the absorption and after multi-exciton decay a band edge state with degeneracy, g, will be either empty or singly occupied. Hence 
(5)where ni is the number of QDs per unit volume containing i excitons (i = 0,1), and at this time n1 =1 − n0. Assuming the probability of a QD not absorbing a photon, P0, is determined by Poisson statistics n0 = nP0 = ne−〈N〉, eqn (5) becomes 
(6)For strong pump absorbance, 〈N〉 varies significantly along the path of the pump beam as 
〈N〉=σpJp = σpJ0pe−∝pz
(7)where J0p is the initial fluence of the pump beam, and σp and ∝p are the absorption cross-section and coefficient at the pump wavelength, respectively.
Also from the Beer–Lambert law we can write 
(8)Thus the fluence change with 〈N〉 is 
(9)Substituting eqn (6) and (8) into (9) gives 
(10)Rearranging eqn (10) yields 
(11)Integrating both sides of eqn (11) for small 〈N〉 yields 
(12)We use two boundary conditions: when the pump beam just enters the sample cuvette at z = 0 and when it just leaves the sample i.e. z = l where l is the path length of the beams in the sample. At z = 0, J = Jin and 〈N〉 = 〈N〉0 = σpJ0p where 〈N〉0 is the value of 〈N〉 as the pump enters the sample. Thus eqn (12) becomes 
(13)Similarly, at z = l where J = Jout and 〈N〉 = 〈N〉0e−∝pl: 
(14)Subtracting eqn (13) from (14) gives 
(15)where T* is the transmittance through the excited QDs. For the unexcited QDs, 〈N〉0 = 0 and so in this case eqn (15) becomes 
(16)where T is the transmittance through the unexcited QDs. Subtracting eqn (16) from (15) we get 
(17)which for small ΔT/T is approximately 
(18)where Apr is the sample absorbance at the probe wavelength. For A ≪ 1, i.e. for samples with low optical density, this expression simplifies to ΔT/T ≈ FApr.
In the same way as above, after cooling and before recombination occurs with the assumption that P2 ∼ 0 we can write 
(19) 
(20)where the probability of MEG η = QY − 1. Hence 
(21)where β = 1 − QY/g. Integrating with respect to 〈N〉 as before yields, for small 〈N〉 
(22)Proceeding as before yields 
(23)Dividing this result by eqn (18) gives the peak-to-plateau ratio 
(24)which in the limit of low fluence, i.e. 〈N〉 → 0, is equivalent to QY.
