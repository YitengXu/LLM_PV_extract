All of the polymers were found to be soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene with excellent film forming properties. Their structures were verified by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy, the molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the thermal properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The polymers exhibited tunable absorptions and energy levels on incorporation of different electron accepting units. All the copolymers showed high field hole mobility up to 10−2 order, and their blends with PCBM exhibited mobility as high as 10−1 order by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Preliminary photovoltaic cells based on the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTDTBO:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/Ca/Al showed a power conversion efficiency of 5.9% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V and a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.45 mA cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency for dithienyl benzooxadiazole (DTBO)-based polymer solar cells.1. IntroductionIn the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have intrigued much interest because they allow the fabrication of light-weight, large-area, flexible devices by low-cost solution processing methods, etc.1–3 To achieve highly efficient PSCs, conjugated polymers with relatively broad absorption, suitable energy levels, and good solubility in organic solvents are important prerequisites.4,5 Power conversion efficiencies up to 8% have now been achieved.6–8 The design and synthesis of new conjugated polymers play a crucial role during the development of PSCs. Conjugated polymers containing alternating donor (D) and acceptor (A) units in their main or side chains have been widely used in PSCs because of their easily tunable electronic properties.9–11 It is important to choose suitable D and A units while designing D–A copolymers with high photovoltaic performance.To improve the polymer solubility while maintaining the polymer's coplanarity, we choose three typical acceptors with alkyl or alkoxyl groups: (4,7-di(5-bromothien-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxy benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (M1), 4,7-di(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (M2), and 2-octyl-4,7-di(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (M3). Our research group has reported that the copolymers from copolymerization of M1, M2 or M3 with alkoxyl substituted benzodifuran (BDF) or benzodithiophene (BDT) units exhibit good photovoltaic properties with a PCE reaching 4.5%.12–15 From the studies on polymer photovoltaic materials, it is obvious that the change of donors can affect greatly device performance by well tuning of absorption, energy levels, morphologies, etc.During the process of searching excellent donors, some recent reports attract us. Some groups have reported alkylthienyl substituted BDT (BDTT)-based copolymers showing great potential in PSCs with PCEs over 6%.16,17 For example, Hou and coworkers synthesized a BDTT based polymer-PBDTTT-C-T, indicating a PCE of up to 7.6% with a high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.48 mA cm−2,16 furthermore, they synthesized another BDTT based polymer-PBDTDTTT-S-T with a PCE over 7%.18 BDTT seems an excellent donor and BDTT based polymers show better photovoltaic properties than those of their corresponding BDT or BDF based copolymers. Conjugated alkylthienyl unit replacing alkoxy group as side chain has proven to be a good strategy to improve the absorbance and mobility of BDT-based polymers.19 However, it is still necessary to do further research on the influence of the BDTT unit on photovoltaic properties of different D–A polymer systems.To further explore BDTT based polymers towards highly efficient photovoltaic applications, we designed and synthesized three new BDTT based copolymers with M1, M2 and M3 as electron accepting units, namely poly{4,8-bis(2′-ethylhexylthiophene)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole)} (PBDTTDTBO), poly{4,8-bis(2′-ethylhexylthiophene)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)} (PBDTTDTBT) and poly{4,8-bis(2′-ethyl hexylthiophene)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2-octyl-2′,1′,3′-benzotriazole)} (PBDTTDTBTz). All the polymers were found to be soluble in common organic solvents with good film forming properties. Their thermal, absorption, and electrochemical properties and hole mobilities were well characterized. Preliminary photovoltaic cells based on the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTDTBO:PC71BM (1:1, w/w)/Ca/Al showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.9% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V and a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.45 mA cm−2. These investigations indicate that the photovoltaic properties can be well tuned by combining with different electron accepting units. More importantly, this work also provides some guidance about the molecular design towards high performance optoelectronic materials.2. Experimental2.1 Materialsn-BuLi, Pd(PPh3)4 and Sn(CH3)3Cl were obtained from Acros Organics and used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as analytical-grade quality and used without further purification. M1,12 M2,20 M3 (ref. 15) and M4 (ref. 19) were prepared according to the reported procedures. All the other compounds were synthesized following the procedures described herein.2.2 Characterization1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer, chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard. The number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights were measured by the GPC method, using polystyrene as a standard and THF as the eluent. TGA was performed on a PE TGA-7 at a heating rate of 20 K min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. For solid state measurements, polymer solution in chloroform was cast on quartz plates. The optical bandgap was calculated from the onset of the absorption band. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation using platinum disk coated with the polymer film, Pt wire and a Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) reference electrode in an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined from the oxidation and reduction onset from the CV curves. Electrochemical onsets were determined at the position where the current starts to differ from the baseline. AFM images were obtained using a Veeco's Dimension V atomic force microscope (AFM) in the tapping mode.2.3 Fabrication of OFET devicesThin-film OFETs were fabricated with top-contact configuration. Thermally oxidized (100) silicon wafers (n++ doped) with a SiO2 thickness of 300 nm were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. Then hydrophilic treatment of these silicon wafers was performed according to the standard procedure. Briefly, the substrates were soaked in a mixture of deionized water, 25% ammonium hydroxide and 30% H2O2 (5:1:1 by volumetric ratio) for 20 min at 80 °C, then rinsed with deionized water and dried with a nitrogen flow. Octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMOS) was self-assembled on the surface of hydrophilic-treated substrates according to the reported method. Thin polymer films were prepared by spin coating of the copolymers in chlorobenzene onto the OTMOS modified SiO2/Si substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm (revolutions per minute) for 40 s at room temperature. After annealing at 150 °C under N2 for half an hour, the gold film (50 nm) was deposited on the organic layer to form the drain and source electrodes, for a typical device, the drain–source channel length (L) and width (W) are 80 μm and 8800 μm, respectively. OFET measurements were performed at room temperature using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer under ambient conditions.2.4 Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cellsThe PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co. LTD (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. The PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Baytron P 4083, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s onto the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 15 min in air to give a thin film with a thickness of 40 nm. A blend of the polymer and PCBM (different weight ratios, 10 mg mL−1 for polymer) was dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), and spin-cast at 3000 rpm for 45 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The substrates were then dried at 70 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the photoactive layer is in the range of 70–80 nm as measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A bilayer cathode consisting of Ca (∼20 nm) capped with Al (∼100 nm) was thermally evaporated under a shadow mask with a base pressure of ca. 10−5 Pa. The active area of the PSCs is 4 mm2. The devices were fabricated in a glovebox. Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 67005, 500 W) calibrated by a standard silicon cell. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 236 digital source meter.2.5 Synthesis of the polymersSynthesis of PBDTTDTBO. M1 (0.14 g, 0.2 mmol), M4 (0.18 g, 0.2 mmol) and 12 mL of dry toluene were put into a two-necked flask. The solution was flushed with N2 for 10 min, then Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mg) was added into the flask. The solution was flushed with N2 again for 20 min. The oil bath was heated to 115 °C carefully, and the reactant was stirred for 24 h at this temperature under N2 atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 100 mL of methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. Finally, the blue solid was obtained (0.161 g, yield: 70%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.70–7.28(br, 4H), 7.17–6.73(br, 6H), 4.40–3.90(br, 4H), 3.35–2.68(br, 6H), 2.20–0.60(br, 58H).

Finally, a deep-purple solid was obtained (0.12 g, yield: 66%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.80–7.37(br, 6H), 7.12–6.76(br, 4H), 4.40–4.00(br, 4H), 3.31–2.76(br, 6H), 2.20–0.63(br, 58H).

Results and discussion3.1 Synthesis and characterizationThe synthetic routes of the three copolymers are depicted in Scheme 1. The polymers were prepared from the BDTT ditin derivative (M4) and dibromide (DTBO, DTBT and DTBTz or M1, M2 and M3) through Stille cross-coupling reactions. The synthesized polymers were purified by continuous extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform, and the chloroform fractions were recovered. The chemical structures of the polymers were verified by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Fig. S1.† The polymers exhibited broad resonance and overlapped peaks. The proton signals of the alkyl chain dominated in the region of 0.71–2.40 ppm, the proton signal of the alkyl chain linked to the thiophene ring showed at 3.30–2.70 ppm, the proton signals of –NCH2 or –OCH2 of the alkoxyl group appeared at 4.00–4.90 ppm, and the proton signals of the aromatic group were between 6.50 ppm and 8.00 ppm. The number of aromatic and aliphatic protons estimated from integration of the peaks is generally consistent with the expected repeating unit of the copolymers. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results (using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent) have shown that the polymers have weight-average molecular weight (Mw) values ranging from 10.6 to 70 kDa with polydispersities (PDIs) of around 1.5–3.1. The obtained copolymers from chloroform fractions are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, dichlorobenzene, etc. Scheme 1  Synthesis and molecular structures of the copolymers. 3.2 Thermal stabilityFig. 1 displays the TGA thermograms of the PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz. The TGA analysis reveals that, under the protection of an inert atmosphere, the onset points of the 5% weight loss of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz are ca. 315 °C, 331 °C and 430 °C, respectively. Relatively high thermal stability of the resulting copolymers prevents the deformation of the copolymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under applied electric fields. Table 1 lists the polymerization results and thermal data of the polymers. Fig. 1  TGA plots of the polymers with a heating rate of 20 K min−1 under inert atmosphere.

The polymers show two absorption bands, the peaks in the long wavelength region locate at 590 nm, 583 nm and 540 nm, and the peaks in the short wavelength region lie at 425 nm, 429 nm and 352 nm for PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz, respectively. The long wavelength absorption is due to a strong D–A charge transfer state, which led to the extended absorption. Compared to the solution, three polymers are more red-shifted and have broader absorption in the film states. The broader and better absorption in the solid state is originated from better planarity of the polymer and stronger electronic interaction between the individual polymer chains in the film states.21 From the onset of the thin film absorptions, we can estimate the optical bandgaps to be 1.75 eV, 1.73 eV and 1.82 eV for PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz, respectively. As listed in Table S1,† compared with their alkoxyl substituted BDT or BDF based copolymers,12–15 BDTT based polymers show comparable or redshifted absorption, which is originated from the extended conjugation by replacing alkoxyl group with alkylthienyl unit. PBDTTDTBO and PBDTTDTBT exhibit similar broad and strong absorption, which is beneficial for obtaining high efficiency polymer solar cells, and PBDTTDTBTz is blue shifted by about ca. 80 nm compared to those of the other two polymers in the solid films, which is due to decreased internal charge transfer from a relatively weaker electron-withdrawing nature of the benzotriazole unit compared to the other two electron accepting units.13 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz: (a) solutions in dilute CHCl3 and (b) films on quartz cast from CHCl3 solution.

We calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers according to the equations:22 HOMO = −e(Eoxon + 4.71) (eV) and LUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.71) (eV). The onset oxidation potentials of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz are 0.54 V, 0.44 V and 0.21 V, respectively. The corresponding HOMO levels of the polymers are −5.25 eV, −5.15 eV and −4.92 eV, respectively. As well known, Voc is limited by the difference between HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor (usually PCBM as the acceptor). Therefore, different HOMO levels lead to different Voc while blending with PCBM. The onset reduction potentials of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz are −1.43 V, −1.41 V and −1.70 V, respectively. The corresponding LUMO levels of the polymers are −3.28 eV, −3.30 eV and −3.01 eV, respectively. From the typical CV curves, the energy levels of the copolymers can be well tuned by altering the electron withdrawing units. PBDTTDTBO has the deepest HOMO level due to the stronger electron accepting ability of benzooxadiazole compared to other two electron accepting units, which ensured good air stability and a high Voc in the polymer solar cell applications. As expected from the structures of the polymers, polymers with different electron withdrawing units have different HOMO values, which is proved by our earlier work.13 The electrochemical bandgaps, estimated from the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, were 1.87 eV, 1.85 eV and 1.91 eV for PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz, respectively. As listed in Table S1,† compared with their alkoxyl substituted BDT or BDF based copolymers, PBDTTDTBO shows a deeper HOMO level, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz exhibit comparable or lower-lying HOMO levels. Electrochemical bandgaps are larger than optical bandgaps, this discrepancy might have been induced by the presence of an energy barrier at the interface between the polymer film and the electrode surface.23 For a clear comparison, we have summarized the electrochemical data in Table 2. Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz films cast on platinum wire in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/CH3CN solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 3.5 Hole mobilityFor polymer solar cells (PSCs) using PCBM as the acceptor, power conversion efficiency (PCE) is proportional to the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Voc is closely related to the HOMO level of the polymers. More importantly, Jsc and FF are directly limited by the hole mobility. Higher charge mobilities enable better charge transport within an active layer without large photocurrent loss due to recombination of opposite charges. Therefore, besides the absorption and energy levels, hole mobility is another important aspect for photovoltaic applications. We measured the hole mobilities of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz blended with PC71BM by the SCLC method which is based on the Poole–Frenkel Law with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/Au.24 SCLC is described by (1)The results are plotted as ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, J stands for current density, d is the thickness of the device, and V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential. According to eqn (1), the hole mobilities of the blends of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz with PC71BM are 0.49 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.24 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobilities of PBDTTDTBO and PBDTTDTBTz are relatively higher than that of PBDTTDTBT under the same conditions, however, with the same order of 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. High hole mobilities are comparable or higher than that of an other reported BDTT based polymer (PBDTTT-C-T with a mobility of 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1).19 To further verify such high hole mobilities of these polymers, we investigated the typical field effect transistors (FETs) of the three polymers, FET hole mobilities of the polymers are ca. 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S2†), which are lower than those from the SCLC model. The reason might be the unoptimized FET device fabrications and different mechanisms of PSCs from FETs or the addition of PCBM facilitating charge transport. The polymers show high hole mobility, which may be mainly determined from the BDTT unit.19 As listed in Table S2,† compared to the corresponding benzodithiophene or benzodifuran (BDT or BDF), with alkoxyl groups, based copolymers, this kind of BDTT based polymers demonstrated at least one order of magnitude higher hole mobilities.12–15 Especially, PBDTTDTBO showed four and three orders of magnitude higher hole mobilities compared to its corresponding BDT and BDF based copolymers, respectively.12,13 In one word, the three copolymers used in this work demonstrated surprisingly high hole mobilities among the polymeric photovoltaic materials as listed in Table 3.25,26 Fig. 4  ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5 plots of the blends of PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT, PBDTTDTBTz with PC71BM for measurement of the hole mobilities by the SCLC method.

Fig. 5a shows the typical J–V curves of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and the corresponding Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are also summarized in Table 3. The blends of the polymers and PCBM at different weight ratios of 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, respectively, were used to optimize the device performances. Fig. S3† shows the current density versus voltage (J–V), external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices and the detailed device results are summarized in Table S3.†PBDTTDTBO demonstrates much higher photovoltaic performance over PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz. When the donor (D)/acceptor (A) weight ratio of the PBDTTDTBO and PC61BM blend is 1:1, the PCE reaches 5.83% with a high Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 10.68 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.61, when the D/A weight ratio of PBDTTDTBO and PC61BM increases to 1:1.5, the PCE decreases to 5.75%. For PBDTTDTBT based solar cells, the PCEs are above 4% at different weight ratios, and the PCE of PBDTTDTBT reaches up to 4.76% when the D/A weight ratio of PBDTTDTBT and PC61BM is 1:1. When PBDTTDTBTz is blended with PC61BM at a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5, the best device efficiency is just 2.45%, and the large decrease of the PCE of PBDTTDTBTz compared to PBDTTDTBO and PBDTTDTBT is mainly originated from the reduction of Voc and Jsc. We replaced PC61BM with PC71BM to improve the Jsc of the devices because PC71BM has better absorption than PC61BM with a similar energy level. Compared with PC61BM as an acceptor, in all cases, PCEs of the devices based on PBDTTDTBO and PC71BM blends of above 5.0% are obtained. When the copolymers are blended with PC71BM, the best D/A weight ratio is 1:1.5. Under these conditions, PBDTTDTBO exhibits a PCE of 5.9% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 11.45 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.61. Among the three polymers, PBDTTDTBO shows the best photovoltaic properties because of high Jsc and Voc, although the absorption of PBDTTDTBO and PBDTTDTBT is similar, PBDTTDTBO has a relatively higher Jsc due to higher hole mobility and better morphology as shown in Fig. 6. PBDTTDTBO exhibits the highest Voc due to the deepest HOMO level among the three BDTT based polymers used in this work. For the PBDTTDTBT/PC71BM blend, the best PCE of ca. 5% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 10.29 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.64 is obtained. PBDTTDTBTz has the lowest PCE of 3.1% among the three copolymers when blended with PC71BM, mainly due to a very low Voc of ca. 0.54 V from a high HOMO level and relatively lower Jsc from a relatively broad bandgap of 1.78 eV. PBDTTDTBTz has the lowest Jsc, resulting from the compromise of higher hole mobility and blueshifted absorption compared to the other two polymers. All of three copolymers demonstrate very high FF above 0.60, which indicates that the devices have relatively balanced charge transport and low serial resistance. As listed in Table S2,† the polymers used in this work show better photovoltaic properties than those of the corresponding BDT or BDF based copolymers,12–15 which is mostly from higher Jsc. For PBDTTDTBO and PBDTTDTBTz based devices, they exhibit two times higher PCE than those of their corresponding BDT or BDF based polymers, due to their greatly improved Jsc although of comparable or a little higher Voc and FF. Compared to its counterparts, the enhanced Jsc for PBDTTDTBO is concerned with a large increase of the hole mobilities with the similarity of their absorption. The increased Jsc of PBDTTDTBTz is related to the red-shifted absorption and much higher hole mobility. For PBDTTDTBT, compared to its analogues, the devices show a little higher PCE, because the hole mobilities are not much improved compared to those of PBDTTDTBO or PBDTTDTBTz, which led to the little difference in Jsc between PBDTTDTBT and its counterparts. In one word, improved photovoltaic properties of the polymers used in this work are mainly from higher Jsc mostly due to the greatly increased hole mobilities compared to their corresponding BDT or BDF based polymers. The accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements can be confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices. Fig. 5b shows the typical EQE plots of the PSC devices fabricated under the same conditions as those for the J–V measurements. The higher values of EQE are consistent with the higher Jsc measured in the solar cells. The EQE results indicate that the photovoltaic results are reliable. The EQE values above 40% from 350 nm to 650 nm of PBDTTDTBO led to higher Jsc up to ca. 11.45 mA cm−2. The maximum EQE plateau reached 58% from 500–600 nm. From the photovoltaic measurements, the difference of PCEs used in this work is mainly from Voc due to varying HOMO levels of the copolymers as mentioned in the electrochemical discussion part, the change in the trend of Voc is similar to the corresponding BDF based polymers reported by us.13 Fig. 5  Typical J–V curves (a) and EQE spectra (b) of polymer solar cells based on polymer:PCBM.

To better explain different photovoltaic properties and determine if the devices were fully optimized, we investigated the morphologies of the three polymers and PC71BM blends spin-coated from their o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution by using a tapping-mode atomic-force microscope (AFM). Fig. 6 shows the height and phase images of polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) films. From the height image (Fig. 6a–c), the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of the blend films for PBDTTDTBO, PBDTTDTBT and PBDTTDTBTz are 1.04 nm, 1.24 nm and 0.77 nm, respectively. All the blends form very smooth high quality films when spin-cast from o-dichlorobenzene. The films are very homogenous with little apparent phase separation and low surface roughness. From the phase images of the copolymer and PCBM blends (Fig. 6d–f), the connectivity is sensitive to the structures of the polymers. The fine and nanoscale phase separation can be seen more clearly in the PBDTTDTBO/PC71BM blend and the PBDTTDTBO blend nanostructure is most pronounced among the three polymer blends, implying that long and good connected pathways have been formed, which further explains the better performance of PBDTTDTBO based solar cells. For BHJ PSCs, the nanoscale phase separation is a practical way to form a bicontinuous donor–acceptor network.27,28 AFM images indicate that all the BDTT based polymers possess good morphology for PSCs. It is believed that the photovoltaic performance of this type of copolymers can be further improved by the optimization of film morphology and device fabrication conditions.4. ConclusionsIn conclusion, we have synthesized three new BDTT based copolymers. The copolymers have been well characterized by TGA, UV-vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry. The opto-electronic properties of the polymers can be finely tuned by differing the electron accepting units. The polymers exhibit surprisingly high hole mobilities (10−1 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). The energy levels, absorption, morphology, etc., have been greatly affected by the introduction of different electron accepting units, resulting in different photovoltaic performances. The PCE of 5.9% from PBDTTDTBO based polymer solar cells with Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 11.45 mA cm−2 and FF = 61.3% was recorded without any device modifications or post-treatment. These results indicate that PBDTTDTBO is a promising candidate for high-efficiency polymer solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by NSFC (no. 51173206, 21161160443), National High Technology Research and Development Program (no. 2011AA050523) and the Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies (SunYat-sen University) (KF2010-MS-01).Notes and referencesJ.
