The improved electrical conductivity and solvent resistance of these ETLs have significantly enhanced the performance of PSCs.

Broader context
In order to realize the full promise of polymer solar cell technology for low cost and scalable renewable energy, it is important to develop solution processible charge-transporting materials that can efficiently extract charge carriers from the active layer to the electrodes and are compatible with multi-layer fabrication process. Here we show a conductive, thermally stable, and solvent resistant electron-transporting layer (ETL) made from a fulleropyrrolidinium salt embedded in an in situ crosslinkable fullerene matrix. The charge extraction and energy alignment of ETL are simultaneously optimized due to enhanced conductivity of doped fullerene layer to afford high efficiency devices. This methodology can be applied to broad organic electronic applications.

By virtue of comprehensive investigations of active materials, interfacial materials, and new device architectures, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk hetero-junction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs) has been significantly improved over the past few years.1 As one of the key elements in PSCs, interfacial layers play a crucial role in transporting charge carriers from the active material to the electrodes and preventing interfacial charge recombination.2–4 An ideal interfacial layer usually serves several functions in PSCs such as (i) reducing the interfacial energy barrier between electrodes and active layer to achieve Ohmic contact,5,6 (ii) defining the polarity of the electrodes for better charge selectivity to minimize interfacial charge recombination and improve the rectification of the current–voltage response with unipolar charge extraction,7,8 (iii) controlling the surface morphology of the active layer by altering the surface energy of the interfacial layers to obtain appropriate vertical phase segregation in the BHJ active layer,9–13 and (iv) improving chemical and mechanical stability of devices.14,15 However, it is quite challenging to simultaneously fulfill all these functions with a single interfacial material for PSCs.
Recently, several organic interfacial materials such as polyethyleneimine (PEI),16 ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE),17 polyfluorene derivatives (PFN),18,19 and fullero-pyrrolidium iodide (FPI)20,21 have been used for PSCs in addition to the commonly used inorganic electron-transporting layer (ETL) (TiOx, ZnO, etc.). In particular, a thin layer of non-conjugated polyelectrolytes (PEI and PEIE) can efficiently reduce the work function of the ITO from 4.8 to ∼4.0 eV to increase the built-in potential and concomitantly enhance open-circuit voltages (Voc) of the devices.16,17
In addition to these developments, molecular doping of conjugated polymers and small molecules has also been explored to form an interfacial layer (IFL) to improve the performance of PSCs.22–24 The main purpose for doping of a solution processible semiconducting IFL is to increase its conductivity and create Ohmic contact at the interfaces between electrodes and the active layer.25,26 However, this approach often encounters certain problems such as low solvent resistance and increased possibility of creating poor morphology due to an incompatibility between inorganic dopants and semiconductors at high doping concentrations. Furthermore, the metal ions in inorganic dopants can diffuse through semiconducting transport layers during device processing and operation to limit device lifetime.27
For example, the in situ doping of crosslinked fullerene28 and naphthalene diimide29 thin films has been shown to be able to improve the performance of the PSC. However, we also found that the diffusion of inorganic dopants caused severe phase separation to result in rough surface morphologies. In addition, severe dewetting of the conductive layer was also found to occur at high doping concentration.28 To circumvent these problems benzoimidazole based organic n-dopants were used in conjunction with a bis(perfluorophenyl) azide crosslinker to create in situ n-doping and crosslinking of polynaphthalene di-imide-based ETLs.29 Nevertheless, it is quite challenging to achieve desired electrical and mechanical properties of the ternary blend that includes dopants, crosslinkers, and n-type polymers, which requires tedious optimization.
More recently, we have found that the iodide on FPI and the common tetrabutyl ammonium salts can dope fullerene cores through anion-induced electron transfer (AIET). High conductivities of up to 2.0 S m−1 could be obtained.30,31 However, the feasibility of using FPI as an ETL for inverted PSCs is limited because it can be dissolved easily in both nonpolar (chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene) and polar (methanol) solvents. Thus, it is imperative to improve its solvent resistance while still maintaining its high conductivity.
Herein, we report the development of efficient and robust ETLs by incorporating a conductive fullerene dopant into a thermally crosslinkable fullerene matrix. The in situ doping and crosslinking has improved both the conductivity and solvent resistance of the ETLs to result in significantly enhanced PCE from 2.43 to 5.26% in proof-of-concept devices. These ETLs were studied in detail by characterizing their charge transporting properties through an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) device platform and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to correlate enhanced electrical conductivities and energy level alignment with the improved device performance in PSCs.
We have functionalized styrene as a small but reactive group onto 1,4-di(vinylbenzyl)fullerene for crosslinking (hereafter referred to as Full-s) in order to maintain compact packing after crosslinking for high electron mobility. We stress that this is one of the simplest structures among all crosslinkable fullerenes reported so far.32
The synthesis of Full-s is achieved through a one-pot reaction from C60 (Fig. 1a). The reduction of C60 with potassium/1-methylnaphthalene at room temperature in THF afforded C60 dianion as a dark red solution. The reaction of the dianion with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride afforded Full-s in 45% yield, and the compound was characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, proton and carbon NMR (SI), as well as single crystal analysis. The Full-x films were prepared by spin-coating a solution of Full-s in chlorobenzene (CB) on ITO substrates and then thermally crosslinked them at 210 °C for 30 min.

(c) The chemical structure of bis-FPI (left) and its doping mechanism through an anion-induced electron transfer (AIET) process (right). (d) Schematic representation of the device structure of PSCs with bis-FPI dispersed Full-x layers. 
The single-crystal analysis of Full-s shows that the fullerene cores were tightly packed together with the closest fullerene's centroid-to-centroid distance of ∼9.92 Å (Fig. S1, S2 and Table S1†), which is even shorter than the reported value for PC61BM crystals (∼10.13 Å).33 A densely packed molecular structure can be seen in Fig. 1b, showing that fullerene and vinylbenzyl groups are orderly segregated in the crystalline phase, which is ideal for facilitating the cross-linking of styrene, while maintaining the tightly packed fullerene channel to enable efficient charge transport.
The bis-FPI doped Full-x films were prepared by simply spin-coating a solution of bis-FPI and Full-s in chlorobenzene onto ITO substrates and then thermally crosslinked them at 210 °C for 30 min to result in a thin film with good solvent resistance. Concurrently, doping occurs through AIET in the solid state from the iodide on bis-FPI to the fullerene core (Fig. 1c (right)). The chemical structure of bis-FPI is shown in Fig. 1c (left). Fig. 1d shows the schematic representation of the device structure of PSCs with bis-FPI dispersed Full-x layers.
The redox potential of Full-s was studied by using cyclic voltammetry. The result shows that there are three stable and reversible reduction peaks. The first reduction potential (Ered11/2) was observed at −1.08 V. This value is similar to that of PCBM (Ered11/2: −1.07 V) (Fig. 2a), which suggests that Full-s has a similar LUMO level to PCBM.

(c) Thin film absorption spectra of Full-x (25%, bis-FPI) before and after washing with chlorobenzene. (d) AFM images of Full-x (25%, bis-FPI). 

Fig. 2b shows the thermal properties of Full-s studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). There is a distinct exothermal peak at 230 °C, which is ascribed to the thermal crosslinking of the styrene groups on Full-s. Note that there is no obvious transition peaks in the second scan, indicating that Full-s is fully crosslinked after thermal annealing. The solvent resistance of the crosslinked Full-x film was studied by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The Full-x films containing 25 mol% of bis-FPI, hereafter referred to as Full-x (25%, bis-FPI), were prepared by spin-coating the solution of the mixed fullerenes in CB and crosslinking at 210 °C for 30 min in a dry nitrogen filled glove box. Fig. 2c shows the absorption spectra of the Full-x (25%, bis-FPI) films before and after washing with CB, which shows that the Full-x (25%, bis-FPI) films have good solvent resistance. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to investigate the topography and surface roughness of the Full-x (25%, bis-FPI) films. Fig. 2d shows the height images of the Full-x films with a surface roughness of 0.5 nm, indicating that the film is smooth and homogeneous.
As a proof-of-concept, we have fabricated inverted PSCs using Full-x films with various bis-FPI concentrations. Solar cell devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/ETL/PIDT-PhanQ:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, and tested under simulated AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 in a dry N2 filled glove box. The active layers were deposited by spin-coating the PIDT-PhanQ:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) solution (40 mg ml−1 in DCB) on top of the ETL and then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in the glove box. A MoO3 (5 nm) and metal electrode (Ag) (100 nm) were then deposited via thermal evaporation. Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics of devices fabricated with different concentrations of bis-FPI. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The thickness of the ETL was optimized to be 12 nm. Note that the J–V curves show the clear trend as a function of the bis-FPI concentration. By increasing the concentration of bis-FPI from 0 to 25%, the PCE increases from 2.43 to 5.26% as a result of increased Jsc, FF, and most notably Voc (from 0.53 to 0.83), which is mainly attributed to the decreased interfacial resistance and the concurrently reduced interfacial recombination at the ETL.

Previously, it has been reported that ethylene oxide groups on a surfactant tend to reduce the work function of ITO due to the formation of interfacial dipoles, which results in improved Voc due to increased built-in potential to decrease interfacial resistance.34,35 Therefore, one can argue that the increased Voc is due to the modulation of the ITO work function from the interfacial dipoles formed between the ethylene oxide side-chains and ITO, when the concentration of bis-FPI was increased in the ETL. To verify this, we have fabricated the reference devices using bis-FP which is the neutral fulleropyrrolidine with the same ethylene oxide side-chains and a similar chemical structure to bis-FPI except without ammonium iodide (the inset in Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1, only subtle fluctuations of the Voc and other device parameters were observed when bis-FP is used. This result clearly shows that the interfacial dipole effect from ethylene oxide functional groups is negligible in these devices.
The thickness of the ETL is also critical in determining the device performance because it plays an important role in affecting both series resistance28 and the spatial distribution of the optical field within the device.36 Two films with different thicknesses were fabricated by changing the spin-coating speed (5k rpm for 12 nm and 2k rpm for 24 nm). The PCE of the devices fabricated with 25% bis-FPI was improved from 3.36 to 5.26% by decreasing the thickness from 24 nm to 12 nm (Fig. S3 and Table S2†). The estimated series resistance (Rs) values for 12 nm and 24 nm of ETLs are 3.36 and 4.26 Ω cm−2, respectively. This indicates that the thickness of the ETL is very critical in determining series resistance and charge collection efficiency. From our previous work, we have found that the thickness below 10 nm often causes shorting of the devices in doped ETLs.29 Therefore, the minimum thickness of the ETL was set to be ∼10 nm. It is well known that the doped semiconducting layer will reduce Ohmic loss at the metal/doped semiconductor interface due to increased electrical conductivity. It also helps in extracting photogenerated charge carriers by lowering the energetic barrier at the interface to achieve proper energy alignment. To further investigate the electrical conductivity of the Full-x (bis-FPI) films and their energetic alignment, we have fabricated OTFT devices to measure their charge mobility and conducted XPS measurements to measure the work function.
All Full-x (bis-FPI) films studied in OTFT and XPS were prepared by using the same method to fabricate ETLs in solar cell devices. The OTFT devices were fabricated with a p++Si/SiO2/BCB/Full-x (bis-FPI)/Ag structure, and were characterized in a glove box with an Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer. A thermally crosslinked divinyltetramethylsiloxane-bis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB) layer was used to passivate the surface hydroxyl groups on the SiO2 gate dielectric. Charge carrier mobility was calculated with a linear fit of the saturation region of the square root of Idsversus Vgs using the standard equation: Ids = [(μWC0/2L)/(Vg−Vt)2], where W, C0, and L are the channel width, capacitance of gate dielectrics and channel length, respectively.
The electrical conductivity was estimated from the Vd–Id curves measured at zero gate bias as reported previously.31 As shown in Fig. 4a and Table 2, the undoped Full-x exhibited a typical n-type transfer curve with an electron mobility of 3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on–off ratio of 9.6 × 103, indicating that it is a typical n-type semiconductor. Upon increasing the concentration of bis-FPI to 25%, all devices show a negative shift in threshold voltage, decrease of on–off ratio, and increase of output current. This suggests that n-doping via AIET occurred. The electrical conductivity of Full-x films increased to ∼10−4 S m−1 upon increasing the concentration of bis-FPI (Table 2).

It is worth noting that the AIET process has already occurred in Full-s (bis-FPI) films even before thermal annealing, which is similar to our previous study.31 Note that Full-s refers to films before thermal crosslinking. For example, the conductivity of Full-s (12%, bis-FPI) and Full-s (25%, bis-FPI) is 9.1 × 10−3 and 2.0 × 10−3 S m−1, respectively (Fig. S4 and Table S3†). The conductivity of Full-s (25%, bis-FPI) is one order of magnitude higher than that of the Full-x (25%, bis-FPI) films. This is probably due to the fact that crosslinking at relatively high temperature causes the degradation of electrical properties of bis-FPI. Nevertheless, it represents one of the rare examples of doped fullerene films that can be processed and survive such harsh processing conditions (annealing at 210 °C for 30 min). The OTFT data clearly show that the three orders higher conductivity after adding bis-FPI into a Full-x matrix is the origin for the improved solar device performance.
Since the electronic structure of the doped ETL also plays an important role in increasing the efficiency of charge extraction, the energy level of the ETL should line up properly with that of PCBM to minimize Voc and Jsc losses. As shown in Fig. 4b, the work function of the films measured from X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was reduced from 4.49 eV (Full-x) to 4.15 eV for Full-x after doping with 25% of bis-FPI. These results show that appropriate energy alignment and enhanced conductivity are both important for efficient extraction of charge carriers from the active layer.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that a thermally stable conductive fullerene can be incorporated into a crosslinkable fullerene matrix to form a robust ETL with enhanced conductivity and mechanical properties. This material can be generally applicable to broad organic electronic applications. This opens up the feasibility of using all-organic ETLs to replace the commonly used inorganic ETLs for making high efficiency devices.

In order to realize the full promise of polymer solar cell technology for low cost and scalable renewable energy, it is important to develop solution processible charge-transporting materials that can efficiently extract charge carriers from the active layer to the electrodes and are compatible with multi-layer fabrication process. Here we show a conductive, thermally stable, and solvent resistant electron-transporting layer (ETL) made from a fulleropyrrolidinium salt embedded in an in situ crosslinkable fullerene matrix. The charge extraction and energy alignment of ETL are simultaneously optimized due to enhanced conductivity of doped fullerene layer to afford high efficiency devices. This methodology can be applied to broad organic electronic applications.


 	Fig. 1  (a) The synthesis procedure of Full-s and its thermally crosslinked Full-x. (b) The single crystal analysis of Full-s. Molecular packing of Full-s shows that fullerene and vinylbenzyl groups segregated in a crystalline phase. (c) The chemical structure of bis-FPI (left) and its doping mechanism through an anion-induced electron transfer (AIET) process (right). (d) Schematic representation of the device structure of PSCs with bis-FPI dispersed Full-x layers.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of Full-s and PC71BM in ODCB/MeCN (5:1 v/v) (0.5 mM) containing TBAH (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. (b) Thermal properties of Full-s. (c) Thin film absorption spectra of Full-x (25%, bis-FPI) before and after washing with chlorobenzene. (d) AFM images of Full-x (25%, bis-FPI).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) J–V characteristics of PCSs fabricated using Full-x with different concentrations of bis-FPI. (b) The chemical structure of bis-FP (inset figure) and the device performance of the devices made with bis-FP. Note that bis-FP is the neutral fulleropyrrolidine without ammonium iodide. Therefore, there is no doping effect on the devices.
