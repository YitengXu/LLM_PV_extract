    , Accepted 23rd October 2019First published on 24th October 2019AbstractIndoor photovoltaic (IPV) cells receive increasing attention because of their promising applications as power sources for devices of the Internet of Things ecosystem. Under indoor artificial light illumination with narrow emission spectra, short-circuit current density is limited, and thus the IPV efficiency is highly dependent on open-circuit voltage (VOC). However, the VOC of various IPV cells, including silicon, III–V semiconductor, dye-sensitized, organic/polymeric, and perovskite photovoltaic cells, is mainly lower than 1 V due to their small optical bandgaps. Here, we report the first all-polymer IPVs using a blend of polymer donor and polymer acceptor as the active layer. Owing to the medium bandgap (Eg = 1.93 eV) and proper energy level alignment of the two polymers, the all-polymer IPV cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 27.4% with an unprecedentedly high VOC of 1.16 V under fluorescent lamp illumination. This work opens up a research field of all-polymer photovoltaics for indoor light-harvesting applications.
Introduction
Photovoltaics are expected to play an important role in energy harvesting for a “low-carbon society”. In the past several decades, outdoor photovoltaics, such as solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity, have received great academic and industrial attention. On the other hand, indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) harvest photon energy from household lighting facilities or ambient dim-light environments.1–4 They can be used in local powering of low-power consumption electronic devices. Important examples of these devices are sensors and actuators of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, which allow communication between small wireless electronic devices via internet and can lead to next generation smart offices, homes, retailers, medical services and manufacturing lines. It is predicted that tens of billions of wireless devices will be installed in the coming decade.4 Available sources of local energy to power these devices include thermal electricity, mechanical vibration energy, radio-wave energy and indoor photovoltaics. Among them, IPVs have the great advantages of high voltage and high power densities to provide sustainable and reliable electric power. Therefore, it is important to develop high-efficiency IPVs working under artificial light sources or dim-light conditions.
The requirements of photoactive materials for IPVs are different from those of outdoor solar cells. According to the theoretical calculation, the ideal bandgap of photoactive materials is 1.3–1.4 eV for outdoor solar cells and 1.9–2.0 eV for IPVs.5 To effectively harvest photons from sunlight, the photoactive materials for outdoor solar cells should possess small bandgaps with wide absorption spectra to overlap the solar spectrum at the cost of decreased open-circuit voltage (VOC).6–8 In contrast to the wide solar spectrum, the emission spectra of artificial light sources are narrow and exclusively lie in the visible range. For a good spectral match, the photoactive materials for IPVs should have a medium bandgap with narrow absorption spectra in the visible range.5,9 Most importantly, the increased bandgap of photovoltaic materials results in high VOC, which is helpful to improve the IPV efficiency. In other words, the small-bandgap materials with low VOC are suitable for outdoor solar cell applications, while the medium-bandgap materials with high VOC are suitable for IPV applications. Various kinds of photovoltaic devices have been used under indoor light conditions, such as silicon,10,11 III–V semiconductor,9,12 dye-sensitized,13–15 organic/polymeric,16–24 and perovskite photovoltaic cells,25–29 and some of them exhibit high IPV efficiency. However, most of the IPV cells reported so far show VOC less than 1.0 V. This is due to the small bandgap of the photoactive materials.
Among various kinds of photovoltaics, organic/polymeric photovoltaics have received great attention because the bandgap of organic/polymeric materials can be easily tuned by tailoring their chemical structures. Moreover, organic/polymeric photovoltaics have the great advantages of low-cost solution processing and light weight.30–32 A record PCE of 28% under fluorescent lamp (FL) irradiation has been reported for organic IPVs recently,19 which is comparable to the highest value of other kinds of IPVs (PCE = 30–35%).12,14,27 One kind of organic/polymer photovoltaics is all-polymer photovoltaics, which use a blend of polymer donor and polymer acceptor as the active layer. Besides the advantages of solution processing and tunable bandgap, all-polymer photovoltaics possess the great merits of superior flexibility, stretchability and mechanical properties.33–37 Although all-polymer photovoltaics in outdoor applications (solar cells) have been intensively investigated, their applications in IPVs have never been reported yet.
In this manuscript, we demonstrate that all-polymer photovoltaics are promising for indoor applications because of their unprecedentedly high VOC. Previously, our group has developed a new kind of polymer acceptor containing boron–nitrogen coordination bonds (B←N),38–41 which possess medium bandgaps and tunable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (ELUMO/EHOMO). Herein, we use a blend of a polymer acceptor containing B←N with a bandgap of 1.95 eV and a polymer donor with a bandgap of 1.93 eV as the active layer. Although the all-polymer photovoltaic device only exhibits a moderate PCE of 7.9% under simulated solar illumination, it shows a high IPV efficiency of 27.4% at a VOC of 1.16 V under indoor artificial lighting sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on all-polymer IPVs, and the VOC of 1.16 V is the highest value reported for all kinds of IPV cells. This PCE is also comparable to that of the most efficient IPVs.12,14,19,27
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the device structure of the photovoltaic cells and the chemical structures of the photoactive materials. We select poly[5,10-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-2-(5-(2,5-difluoro-4-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-4,4,9,9-tetrafluoro-7-methyl-4,5,9,10-tetrahydro-3a,5,8a,10-tetraaza-4,9-diborapyrene-3a,8a-diium-5,11-diuide] (PBN-10) as the polymer acceptor and choose poly[4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-((2-butyloctyl)thio)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole] (CD1) as the polymer donor to construct all-polymer photovoltaic cells.42 For comparison, we also select an intensively studied small-bandgap small molecular acceptor, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC, see Fig. 1),43 to combine with CD1 for photovoltaic devices. Indeed, organic solar cells based on the blend of the donors with similar structures of CD1 and the acceptor ITIC have been previously reported by Li et al.44,45

As shown in Fig. 2, CD1 and PBN-10 show absorption spectra locating in the visible range. The onset absorption wavelengths of CD1 and PBN-10 are 643 nm and 636 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.93 eV and 1.95 eV, respectively. The emission spectra of artificial light sources, such as white light emitting diodes (LEDs) and FLs, lie in the narrow wavelength region from 400 to 650 nm (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the absorption spectra of the two polymers overlap very well with the emission spectra of the FL and LED, indicating that the CD1:PBN-10 blend can effectively utilize the photons emitted from the two artificial light sources. As shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption spectrum of ITIC exhibits a peak at 700 nm and a shoulder at 640 nm with an onset absorption wavelength of 760 nm. Obviously, the overlap between the absorption spectrum of ITIC and the emission spectra of the FL or LED is moderate.

(b) The absorption spectra of CD1, PBN-10 and ITIC thin films (spin-coated from chloroform solution). (c) Energy level diagram of CD1, PBN-10 and ITIC. 

Fig. 2c shows the ELUMO/EHOMO alignment of CD1, PBN-10 and ITIC. The ELUMO and EHOMO offsets between CD1 and PBN-10 are larger than 0.3 eV and are adequate for the photoinduced electron and hole transfer between the two polymers.46,47 Moreover, the large difference between the ELUMO of the acceptor PBN-10 and the EHOMO of the donor CD1 is expected to give a high VOC in the resultant photovoltaic cells.48–50 In contrast, the ELUMO of ITIC is 0.41 eV lower than that of PBN-10. Therefore, the photovoltaic cells of the CD1:ITIC blend should exhibit a much lower VOC than those of the CD1:PBN-10 blend. Besides the ideal absorption spectra and matched energy levels, CD1 and PBN-10 also exhibit excellent charge transport properties. As measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method, the hole mobility (μh) of CD1 is 1.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the electron mobility (μe) of PBN-10 is 5.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
We fabricated the photovoltaic cells with a normal device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/CD1:PBN-10 or CD1:ITIC/Ca/Al (Fig. 1a). Fig. 3a–c display the current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the two devices using different light sources. Table 1 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Under AM1.5G illumination from a solar simulator, the device based on the CD1:ITIC blend shows a VOC of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.39 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 58.3%, and a PCE of 8.69%, while the CD1:PBN-10-based device displays a VOC of 1.29 V, a JSC of 10.10 mA cm−2, and an FF of 60.8%, leading to a PCE of 7.93%. Compared with the CD1:ITIC device, the CD1:PBN-10 device shows a higher VOC but lower JSC. The higher VOC is attributed to the larger difference between the ELUMO of the acceptor and the EHOMO of the donor caused by the high-lying ELUMO of PBN-10 (Fig. 2c), while the lower JSC is due to the poor utilization of solar light, which is limited by the narrow absorption spectrum of PBN-10 (Fig. 2b). Despite the slightly inferior PCE under AM1.5G illumination, the CD1:PBN-10-based device greatly outperforms the CD1:ITIC-based device under artificial light sources. Under FL illumination with a light intensity of 1000 lux, the CD1:PBN-10-based device shows a VOC of 1.14 V, a JSC of 0.120 mA cm−2, an FF of 66.2%, and an output power density (Pout) of 0.091 mW cm−2, leading to a PCE of 26.2% (the power density of the incident light, Pin, is estimated to be 0.345 mW cm−2). In comparison, the CD1:ITIC-based device exhibits a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 0.116 mA cm−2, an FF of 68.1%, and a Pout of 0.062 mW cm−2, leading to a PCE of 17.9%. A similar trend is also observed when the two photovoltaic devices are operated under LED illumination. The CD1:PBN-10- and CD1:ITIC-based devices show the PCEs of 21.7% and 15.4%, respectively, under LED illumination. The excellent device performance of the CD1:PBN-10 system under FL and LED illumination can be explained using the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. As shown in Fig. 3d, the CD1:PBN-10 based device shows a high photoresponse from 390 to 630 nm with the maximum EQE value of 69%. This EQE spectrum matches well with the emission spectra of FL and LED. In contrast, the CD1:ITIC-based device exhibits a wide photoresponse extending to 800 nm, but the lack of photons from the near-infrared region would limit the photocurrent of this device under LED and FL illumination. Therefore, compared with the CD1:ITIC-based device, the CD1:PBN-10-based device shows a lower JSC under AM1.5G illumination but comparable JSC under FL and LED illumination. Besides the effective light harvesting from FL and LED, the high VOC of the CD1:PBN-10-based device also contributes to its high PCE. It is worth mentioning that the VOC of the CD1:PBN-10-based device is as high as 1.14 V under FL or LED illumination. This VOC is the largest among the reported indoor photovoltaics.10,12,14,19,23,24,27 Compared with AM1.5G illumination, the indoor illumination from FL and LED leads to a lower VOC but higher FF in the photovoltaic devices. The decreased VOC is due to the few photo-generated charge carriers under low-intensity illumination, while the increased FF results from the reduced bimolecular charge recombination with low charge carrier density.

We investigated the effect of indoor light intensity on the IPV performance of the two photovoltaic cells. The dependence of PCE on light intensity under FL and LED illumination is shown in Fig. 4. The detailed device data are provided in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), and the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). Both the VOC and JSC of the two cells continuously increase as the light intensity changes from 200 lux to 6000 lux, which is attributed to the increased number of collected charge carriers in the electrodes due to the significantly increased intensity of the incident light. The dependence of VOC on illumination intensity has been clearly explained by So et al.51 The FF increases at low illumination intensity and then decreases at high illumination intensity. The increase is attributed to the filling-up of traps by the charge carriers in the active layer, which enhances the fraction of free charge carriers collected in the electrodes, while the decrease is due to the more serious bimolecular recombination at high charge carrier density. Different changes in VOC, JSC and FF make the PCEs of both IPV cells increase initially and then decrease with increased light intensity (Fig. 4). It is important to note that the IPV cell based on the CD1:PBN-10 system shows a higher PCE than that based on the CD1:ITIC system despite the indoor light sources and light intensities. Compared with the CD1:ITIC based device, the CD1:PBN-10 based device shows the larger increase in PCE as the light intensity increases to 2000 lux, which may be because there are more traps to be filled in the CD1:PBN-10 based device. As a result, the IPV cell based on CD1:PBN-10 shows the highest PCE under FL illumination with a light intensity of 2000 lux. It displays a VOC of 1.16 V, a JSC of 0.244 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66.7%, resulting in a PCE of 27.4%. This PCE is among the highest values reported for organic/polymeric IPVs.19,23,24,51

We studied the charge transport and recombination behaviours of the two photovoltaic cells. The μh and μe of the CD1:PBN-10 active layer measured by the SCLC method are 1.44 × 10−4 and 2.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, corresponding to a μh/μe ratio of 0.58 (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†). The high and balanced charge carrier mobilities are beneficial for charge transport in the active layer. The dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) of the CD1:PBN-10 device was measured to estimate the charge collection properties (Fig. S5a, ESI†).52,53 As Veff increases, Jph increases dramatically at low voltage and saturates at high voltage, displaying a Jph,SC/Jph,sat value of 91.7% (Jph,SC is the Jph at short-circuit and Jph,sat is the Jph at saturation), indicating a high charge collection efficiency. The light intensity dependent JSC curve exhibits a power-law exponent value (α) of 0.95 (Fig. S5b, ESI†), which suggests that the bimolecular recombination is effectively suppressed under short-circuit conditions.54,55 All these results are consistent with the excellent photovoltaic performance of the CD1:PBN-10 blend.
The morphology of the CD1:PBN-10 active layer was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and two-dimensional grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the CD1:PBN-10 film shows a smooth surface morphology with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.63 nm. The film is comprised of interpenetrated fibre networks with a fibre diameter of ca. 40 nm and fibre length of hundreds of nanometres. These bicontinuous fibre networks were also observed in the TEM image (Fig. 5c). The nano-scale phase separation of the polymer donor and acceptor can increase the donor/acceptor interfacial area, which is helpful for the exciton dissociation. The 2D-GIWAXS results in Fig. 5d and S6† show that the CD1:PBN-10 blend film displays a strong reflection at a q of 0.25 Å−1 (dspacing is 25.1 Å) with a coherence length (CL) of 10.85 nm in the in-plane direction and a reflection at a q of 1.7 Å−1 (dspacing is 3.7 Å) with a CL of 3.02 nm in the out-of-plane direction, which are attributed to the (100) and (010) reflections of the polymers, respectively. This suggests that CD1 or PBN-10 polymers have some degree of crystallinity and adopt the face-on orientation in the active layer. In contrast, the CD1:ITIC blend film only shows lots of globular aggregates without the obvious long fibres in spite of the similar RMS roughness of 0.71 nm (Fig. S7†) and exhibits a lower molecular order than the CD1:PBN-10 blend film (the corresponding CL of the (100) and (010) reflections is 5.42 and 2.32 nm for the CD1:ITIC blend film, as shown in Fig. S6 and S7,† respectively). The interpenetrated ordered fibre networks and the preferable face-on orientation of the CD1:PBN-10 blend provide the efficient charge transport channels in the vertical direction. This excellent active layer morphology agrees well with the high photovoltaic efficiency of the CD1:PBN-10 based photovoltaic device.

In Fig. 6, we summarize the PCE, VOC and optical bandgap of different types of photovoltaic cells for indoor applications, including microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si), perovskite, gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. The detailed data are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). Generally, the larger the bandgap of the photoactive materials is, the higher the VOC and PCE of the IPVs are. According to the prediction by Freunek et al.,5 to maximize the PCE of the IPVs, the ideal bandgap of photoactive materials should be between 1.9–2.0 eV. As shown in Fig. 6, all the photoactive materials for IPVs reported to date have a bandgap smaller than the optimal value. As a result, most of the relevant IPVs show VOC lower than 1.0 V. Only the all-polymer photovoltaic cell reported here employs the photoactive materials with the bandgap of the ideal value. Therefore, the all-polymer photovoltaic cell exhibits unprecedentedly high VOC and holds great promise for high PCE. Although it is improper to directly compare the PCE of different indoor photovoltaic cells because there is no widely acceptable standard for indoor spectral quality and integrated irradiance, we believe that the PCE of the all-polymer IPV is comparable to that of other kinds of high-efficiency IPVs. As this is the first report on all-polymer IPVs, we also believe that there is much room for PCE enhancement because of the ideal bandgap of polymer materials.

Conclusions
In summary, we report all-polymer IPV cells with a blend of polymer donor and polymer acceptor with medium optical bandgaps as the active layer. Thanks to the excellent utilization of the incident indoor light and the proper energy level alignment of the two polymers, the all-polymer photovoltaic device exhibits a high VOC of 1.16 V under FL or LED illumination. Although the all-polymer device exhibits a moderate PCE of 7.9% under solar illumination, it shows a PCE as high as 27.4% under FL illumination of 2000 lux. This work opens up a new research field of all-polymer photovoltaics for indoor light-harvesting applications.
