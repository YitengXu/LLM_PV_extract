    , Accepted 3rd August 2016First published on 3rd August 2016AbstractHeteroatom substitutions are an effective means of tuning the optoelectronic, conformational, and molecular packing properties of donor–acceptor conjugated copolymers, with a view to efficient photovoltaic performance. We investigate the effects of systematic sulfur/selenium substitutions into thiophene (donor) and benzothiadiazole (acceptor) units using complementary Raman spectroscopy, density functional theory, and X-ray diffraction to characterise the resulting copolymers. We find that, in each case, the heavy atom substitution is detrimental to photovoltaic performance and undertake to understand this in terms of fundamental optoelectronic properties of the copolymers. Specifically, we find that, due to mesomeric effects, the selenium atom donates electron density into the donor unit (selenophene) more strongly than sulfur, but also withdraws electron density more strongly from the benzene ring in the acceptor unit (benzoselenadiazole). In both cases, the selenium substitution reduces the optical energy gap but is unfavourable for intermolecular packing in thin films and so results in poor charge carrier mobility. We identify a complex interplay between the electronic properties of the substituted donor and acceptor units relating to the frontier molecular orbital energy levels, molecular conformation, and intermolecular packing of the copolymers. In particular, we find that the pairing of a strong acceptor unit with a weak donor unit results in relatively low electron density on the conjugated backbone, leading to high inter-unit torsion and weak optical absorption in the visible range. The methods and insights developed here have broad applicability to the design of other donor–acceptor copolymers for optoelectronic device applications.
1. Introduction
Donor–acceptor copolymers are an important class of conjugated molecule for a wide range of organic semiconductor device applications.1–5 One particularly attractive property is that the optoelectronic properties can be chemically tuned by modifying the structures of the constituent electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units.6–8 For photovoltaic applications it is desirable to produce polymers with narrow optical energy gaps and high absorption coefficients to optimise harvesting of the solar spectrum, whilst maintaining large ionisation potentials to maximise the output voltage of the device.9,10 The D–A copolymer strategy offers an achievable route to this goal.11–15
Whilst many different D–A copolymers have been synthesised with a broad range of optoelectronic properties there remains a degree of uncertainty regarding the mechanism by which these effects arise.7,16–19 Increasingly it has become apparent that small changes (substitution of a single atom) in chemical structures have much more widespread implications than simply tuning energy levels.6,8,20–27 In this study, we seek to address the question of how heteroatom substitutions relate to the optoelectronic and molecular conformational properties of a polymer and how these in turn affect the thin film morphology and device performance.
In the light of the complexity of these materials and the limitless possible variations, we focus on a simple series based on an alternating D–A copolymer of two well-known units: thiophene as the electron donor, and benzothiadiazole as the electron acceptor. In this case, solubility is provided by two alkoxy side chains bonded to the acceptor unit. We investigate the effects of systematically substituting the sulfur (S) atoms in the donor and acceptor units for selenium (Se) providing a series of four materials, as illustrated in Fig. 1, which introduces the nomenclature used for these materials hereafter.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the S/Se substituted D–A copolymer series: PSBS, PSBSe, PSeBS, and PSeBSe. 
It is generally agreed that Se substitution in either the donor or acceptor unit results in a reduced optical energy gap, though reports conflict on how the frontier energy levels are separately affected.6,8,11,21,27–32 These effects appear to depend on the specific chemical structures of both the donor and acceptor units and so it remains a challenge to understand in a general way how the heteroatom substitutions relate to the optoelectronic properties of the copolymer. We advance this understanding with a detailed, systematic study of this archetypal D–A copolymer series.
We make use of Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to provide a powerful means of probing the changes in electron density and chemical structure resulting from the atomic substitution. This enables us to understand how these factors relate to the observed optoelectronic properties of interest for thin film device applications. We find that the Se substitution into the thiophene donor unit increases the electron density on the conjugated part of that unit,29,33,34 whereas Se substitution into the benzothiadiazole acceptor unit results in reduced electron density on the benzene ring.8 Since the electronegativities of S (2.58) and Se (2.55) are essentially identical, these observations are ascribed to mesomeric (or resonant), rather than inductive effects.8,34 The overall effect in each case is a reduction in the optical energy gap, but the optoelectronic and morphological properties of the copolymer are sensitive to the specific pairing of the S and Se donor and acceptor units. For this copolymer series, heteroatom substitution from S to Se is an effective means of tuning the electronic energy levels but less favourable for the intermolecular packing in thin films desired for high charge carrier mobility and good device performance.
2. Experimental methods
Materials
Details of the synthesis for the copolymer series are provided in the ESI.† Molecular weights (Mn), polydispersities (PDI), and estimated degrees of polymerisation (DP) of the copolymers are as follows: PSBS Mn = 20 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.6, DP = 42; PSBSe Mn = 18 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.2, DP = 35; PSeBS Mn = 19 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.5, DP = 37; PSeBSe Mn = 12 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.5, DP = 21. These values were calculated using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene standards for calibration. These data are provided in the ESI.†
Sample preparation
Samples for spectroscopy were deposited on Spectrosil 2000 substrates by spin coating from chlorobenzene solution to thicknesses of around 80 nm (measured with a Tencor Alphastep profilometer). Polymer:fullerene (1:2 weight ratio) blend films were deposited using the conditions described below for the active layer in photovoltaic devices. Pristine films were prepared from chlorobenzene solution without any additive and without the thermal annealing step. For X-ray diffraction measurements silicon substrates were used with a 40–50 nm interlayer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) annealed at 140 °C for 20 minutes, and the polymer deposited on top.
Transistor devices were prepared in a bottom contact architecture (channel length 12 μm, width 120 μm). Source and drain contacts were made of gold (100 nm thick), and the dielectric was silicon dioxide (300 nm thick). The SiO2 surface was pre-treated with octyltrichlorosilane in toluene for 2 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere prior to polymer deposition by spin coating (60 ± 10 nm). Hole mobilities were calculated in the saturation regime.35
Photovoltaic devices were prepared with the structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The active layer (100 ± 10 nm) was a blend of polymer and PC71BM deposited from chlorobenzene solution with 3% (by volume) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was purchased from EM-index. The optimised device performance was obtained with a polymer:fullerene blend ratio of 1:2 by weight (1:3 ratio for PSBSe), and annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes after deposition of LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) by evaporation under vacuum (3 × 10−6 Torr). The active area of the devices was 0.09 cm2.
Spectroscopy
UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer. A 785 nm diode laser excitation (130 mW, 50 s exposure) was used for the presented spectra, and other lasers (457, 488, 514, and 633 nm) were used for resonant excitations. Measurements were taken with the sample in a nitrogen atmosphere. Background photoluminescence was subtracted using a polynomial baseline fitting.
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry was performed with a CH Instruments Electrochemical Analyser using acetonitrile solution containing tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as the electrolyte. The reference electrode was Ag/AgNO3, and platinum was used for the counter electrode and working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry data are shown in the ESI.†
Density functional theory calculations
Molecular geometry optimisation was carried out for symmetric segments of the conjugated polymer backbone (alkyl side chains truncated to methyl groups to save computational time) using GAUSSIAN09 software.36 The B3PW91 hybrid functional was used with the 6-311G(2df,p) basis set, since these have been found to give accurate results for organoselenium compounds.37–42 Frequency analysis was used to aid the identification of Raman-active vibrational normal modes (see ESI†).
X-Ray diffraction
2D grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on beam line 9A of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory with 1.1010 Å wavelength X-rays. An incident angle of 0.15° was used to provide complete penetration into the polymer film.
Atomic force microscopy
Surface topography maps were measured using a Park NX10 in non-contact mode with a PPP-NCHR probe.
Photovoltaic device characterisation
Photovoltaic device performances were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from a K201 Lab50 solar simulator (McScience Inc.) calibrated with a standard Si photodiode (K801S-K11; McScience Inc.), which was calibrated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a K101 Lab20 photovoltaic power meter (McScience Inc.).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Absorption spectroscopy
Thin film absorption spectra for all four polymers are given in Fig. 2. Each of these materials has two clear absorption bands within the measured range: a low energy band at 450–800 nm and a high energy band around 300–450 nm. This type of absorption spectrum is characteristic of benzothiadiazole containing D–A copolymers where the low energy band is described as having partial intramolecular charge transfer character and the high energy band has strongly π–π* character.16,19,22,43 In each case there is some discernible vibronic structure, though this is most clearly resolved for PSBS, and less so for the other polymers, particularly PSBSe. This qualitatively corresponds with the degree of energetic disorder (lowest for PSBS and highest for PSBSe) in the thin films.

The spectral positions of the absorption onsets and the relative absorption coefficients for the two absorption bands of these four materials provide insight into the impacts of the various Se substitutions on their optical properties. In contrast to expectations from similar studies, we observe minimal difference in the positions of the absorption onsets of PSBS, PSBSe, and PSeBS and a large shift for PSeBSe indicating a significant narrowing of the energy gap resulting only from the combined substitution of Se into both donor and acceptor units.6,8,11,21 The high energy absorption band (π–π* transition) of PSeBSe also shows a similar shift in its spectral position, which indicates that the atomic substitutions affect the electronic wavefunction distribution along the whole conjugated backbone (through both the donor and acceptor units). In addition, there are significant differences in the absorption coefficients of the two bands for the different polymers. The high energy absorption band shows little variation in strength for the different materials, though the polymers with matching pairs of heteroatoms (PSBS and PSeBSe) have slightly stronger peaks than the mis-matched cases (PSBSe and PSeBS). The low energy absorption band shows a much clearer variation in strength; in particular, we find that the PSBSe peak absorption coefficient is roughly half that of the other polymers. PSBS has the strongest low energy absorption, and PSeBSe and PSeBS are comparable to each other. However, the absence of a simple correlation between the heteroatom substitutions and the absorption coefficients reveals a complex relationship, which we continue to probe in greater depth throughout this manuscript.
Some insight can be gained by considering the natures of the high and low energy absorption bands: above, we identified the high energy absorption transition as having strongly π–π* character, and the low energy absorption transition as having charge transfer character (from the donor to the acceptor unit). As a result, we would expect the strength of the low energy transition to be especially sensitive to the degree of localisation of HOMO and LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest occupied molecular orbital), and the interunit torsion between the donor and acceptor units, since both of these factors will reduce the HOMO–LUMO overlap integral.44 This suggests that the weak low energy absorption measured for PSBSe can be understood to arise from a particularly strong localisation of the LUMO on the BSe unit, and/or a strong interunit torsion. The same effect is not observed for PSeBSe, suggesting that it is not caused by the Se substitution in the acceptor unit, but rather must result from the specific pairing of the Se-containing acceptor unit with the S-containing donor unit. A large interunit torsion, in this case, would also explain the high degree of energetic disorder in PSBSe (noted above), additionally, the DFT optimised geometries (discussed in detail below) support this analysis, showing a larger inter-unit dihedral angle for the PSBSe molecule (12.8°) compared with the others (5.3–6.1°).
The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated using cyclic voltammetry (see ESI† for additional data), whilst the energy gap (Eg) was extracted from the absorption spectra (see Fig. 2). These measurements were then combined to give an approximate LUMO value. The values obtained are given in Table 1 alongside HOMO energy levels calculated using DFT (HOMODFT).

These results show that PSBS exhibits the largest energy gap (1.77 eV), and that a single Se substitution in either the acceptor (PSBSe) or donor (PSeBS) unit results in similar reductions to (1.70 and 1.69 eV respectively). The fully substituted polymer (PSeBSe) has the smallest energy gap (1.52 eV). The general trend is that Se substitution in both the donor and acceptor units leads to a narrowing of the optical energy gap, primarily by reducing the HOMO energy level.6,28,45,46 The HOMO energy levels calculated using DFT match the trend of the experimental results though the absolute values and relative impacts of Se substitution in the donor and acceptor units are not accurately reproduced (PSeBS is calculated with deeper HOMO than PSBSe). The consistent reduction in the measured HOMO energy levels upon Se substitution indicates a destabilisation of the HOMO resulting from the heavier atom, and this effect is stronger for substitution in the donor unit (−5.36 to −5.21 eV for PSBS to PSeBS) than for the acceptor unit (−5.36 to −5.30 eV for PSBS to PSBSe).
The calculated LUMO energy levels are relatively unaffected by the Se substitution, except for the case of PSeBS, which has a shallower LUMO than the others (−3.52 compared with −3.59 eV). We note that this contrasts with the both the simple case of polyselenophene, which has a stabilised LUMO relative to polythiophene, and a theoretical study finding that benzoselenadiazole has a slightly stabilised LUMO relative to benzothiadiazole.8,47 The modest destabilisation of the LUMO observed here arises only in the case of Se substitution in the donor unit (PSeBS), and is not observed when a further substitution is made of Se in the acceptor unit (PSeBSe). These observations clearly indicate an interplay between the donor and acceptor units such that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels must be thought of as properties of the whole molecule rather than being set by particular units. Specific insight into these mechanisms is provided experimentally by considering the distribution of π-electron density across the donor and acceptor units using Raman spectroscopy.
3.2. Raman spectroscopy
The semiconducting properties of conjugated polymers derive from their delocalised π-electronic structure, which can be probed very effectively using Raman spectroscopy.48–50 Raman scattering cross sections are strongly linked with molecular polarisability such that we typically observe strong scattering from vibrational modes localised on regions of high π-electron density.51 We can, therefore, use this technique to elucidate how the heteroatom substitutions cause redistribution of the π-electron density on the polymer molecule.52,53Fig. 3 compares the Raman spectra of thin film samples of the four copolymers. These spectra are measured using 785 nm excitation which satisfies a similar pre-resonant condition for all the materials except for PSeBSe. (See ESI† for discussion of resonant Raman spectra.)
 Fig. 3  Thin film Raman spectra measured using 785 nm excitation comparing (a) PSBS and PSBSe, (b) PSBS and PSeBS, and (c) PSBS and PSeBSe. All spectra normalised to strongest peak (1430 cm−1). 
We consider vibrational modes in the range 1200–1600 cm−1, which correspond with carbon bond stretches. For comparing Raman shifts between different polymers we take the value for PSBS as a label for the mode. The strongest peak for all four polymers is measured around 1430 cm−1, which we identify as the in-plane symmetric CC ring stretching mode of the thiophene unit.49,50 This is accompanied by a smaller mode at 1380 cm−1, which is described as a C–C stretching mode in the thiophene ring. There is also a strong mode around 1494 cm−1, corresponding with a benzene ring stretching mode of the benzothiadiazole unit.54,55 In the range 1250–1350 cm−1 we measure a band of modes, containing at least three components. These are various C–C stretching modes coupled to different C–H wagging modes but are difficult to distinguish unambiguously. The strongest of these modes, at 1294 cm−1 in PSBS, is identified as having a strong component on the C–C bonds in the centre of the benzothiadiazole unit. The 1380, 1430, and 1494 cm−1 modes, which are most important for our analysis, are well-known from similar published materials and the identifications of all four modes agree with DFT frequency analysis (see ESI†). The vibrational mode assignments are illustrated in Fig. 4 with arrows indicating the primary molecular motions.
 Fig. 4  Diagram illustrating primary bond stretches associated with the main Raman modes centred at 1294, 1380, 1430, and 1494 cm−1 in PSBS. 
Comparing first the Raman spectra for PSBS and PSBSe (Fig. 3a) we observe that this Se substitution in the acceptor unit causes significant shifts in the 1294 and 1494 cm−1 peaks to 1271 and 1480 cm−1 respectively. Both of these modes are localised on the acceptor unit, and so the shift to lower frequency indicates that the Se substitution results in a reduced effective force constant for vibration of these bonds. This can be understood as a reduction in the π-bonding strength in the benzene ring, which suggests a reduced π-electron density. By contrast, the modes localised on the donor unit (1380 and 1430 cm−1) show no significant change in frequency. The relative intensity changes of the Raman modes provide further information about the molecular structure and conformation. The 1380 cm−1 thiophene ring C–C peak has reduced intensity relative to the 1430 cm−1 thiophene CC ring stretch, which has been associated previously with increased inter-unit dihedral torsion for polythiophenes (in agreement with the discussion of absorption spectra, above).49 We also find that the two acceptor unit Raman peaks (1294 and 1494 cm−1) have reduced intensity relative to the thiophene 1430 cm−1 ring stretch. Since the Raman scattering intensities in conjugated polymers arise from the polarisability of the π-electrons, they provide further evidence that the benzene ring in the benzoselenadiazole unit has a reduced π-electron density than for the benzothiadiazole analog (both relative to the donor unit). We conclude that this Se substitution draws π-electron density out of the acceptor unit benzene ring, which is understood in terms of the mesomeric effect resulting from a weaker coupling with the neighbouring N atom as a result of the N–Se bond being longer than the N–S bond.8 This has minimal impact on the adjacent thiophene unit except for the increase in inter-unit torsion, which might be expected to further minimise the interaction between the donor and acceptor units, though the causal relationship is not clear from this measurement (see discussion of DFT results below).
In Fig. 3b we consider the effects of Se substitution in the donor unit by comparing the Raman spectra of PSBS and PSeBS. In this case, we also observe minimal shifts in the acceptor unit peaks: the 1494 cm−1 mode shifts to 1491 cm−1, and the 1294 cm−1 shows no measurable peak shift (though the reduced intensity makes it difficult to separate from its neighbours). However, there is now a broadening of the donor unit 1430 cm−1 peak towards lower frequency (FWHM increases from 19 to 23 ± 1 cm−1) accompanied by a shift in the 1380 cm−1 peak to 1383 cm−1 both of which are characteristic of increased π-electron delocalisation and backbone coplanarity.49,53 The increase in intensity of the 1380 cm−1 mode is also characteristic of this effect, but the reduction in the relative intensities of the 1294 and 1494 cm−1 benzothiadiazole ring stretching modes suggests that the Se substitution in the donor unit results in a lower overall proportion of the π-electron density on the acceptor unit ring. In this case, we suggest that the Se atom effectively donates electron density into the donor ring (relative to the S atom), which is understood in terms of selenophene having lower aromaticity than thiophene.34 This effect has minimal impact on the neighbouring acceptor unit, and so the Raman scattering intensity is enhanced much more strongly for the donor unit ring modes than for the acceptor unit.

Fig. 3c demonstrates the combined effects of Se substitutions into both the donor and acceptor units (PSBS and PSeBSe). In this instance we find that the main ring stretching modes for both the donor and acceptor units (1430 and 1494 cm−1) show strong shifts to 1417 and 1473 cm−1. The acceptor unit mode at 1294 cm−1 shifts to 1279 cm−1 and the weaker donor unit 1380 cm−1 mode shifts to 1382 cm−1. These observations are similar to the effects discussed above for the two separate Se substitutions, but more extreme, and so represent both an increase of π-electron density localised on the donor unit and a reduction in π-electron density on the benzene ring of the acceptor unit. This also results in a particularly low intensity of the acceptor unit ring stretch peak (1494 cm−1) relative to the donor unit ring stretch peak (1430 cm−1).
3.3. Density functional theory calculations
Additional support for the experimental observations above regarding the effects of the S/Se substitutions on the molecular conformations and π-electron distributions of these materials is provided by DFT calculations of the optimised geometries. Fig. 5 shows the optimised geometry and frontier molecular orbitals for PSBS, which are representative of all four polymers (see ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) distributions of PSBS (isovalue is 0.02 in atomic units; green and red show positive and negative regions). 
The frontier molecular orbitals in Fig. 5 show that the HOMO is delocalised along the conjugated polymer backbone with minimal density on the heteroatoms. In contrast, the LUMO shows a large electron density on the nitrogen and S/Se atoms with a lower electron density on the conjugated structure. The LUMO is clearly delocalised over multiple units of the polymer but shows a relatively high density on the acceptor units compared with the donor units, which is typical for D–A copolymers.16,56
The most significant differences in the modelled molecular geometries are presented in Table 2. The direct influence of the Se substitution is shown by the increases in the C–Se and N–Se bond lengths relative to C–S and N–S, for the donor and the acceptor units respectively. In both cases the bond is much longer for the Se atom (1.772 and 1.886 Å compared to 1.609 and 1.740 Å), which we attribute simply to the larger size of the Se atom. Experimental evidence for this increase in bond length is provided by Raman spectroscopy (see ESI†), where the vibrational frequencies of these bonds shift to lower energy.

All four polymers show a relatively high degree of planarity compared with other D–A copolymers e.g. F8BT.8 In large part this is attributed to our use of alkoxy solubilising groups to minimise steric hindrance. This may also explain why the calculated LUMOs are relatively delocalised for these polymers. PSBS, PSeBS, and PSeBSe all have very similar calculated dihedrals in the range 5.3–6.1°, whereas PSBSe gives a substantially larger value of 12.8°. If this torsion of the backbone were caused by the large size of the substituted Se atom we would expect similar effects for all three of the Se-containing materials, but this is not the case. Rather, it seems that the increased torsion arises from the specific pairing of the thiophene donor unit with the benzoselenadiazole acceptor unit.
Some insight into the factors determining the D–A inter-unit torsion can be gained from the calculated inter-unit bond length. Both PSBS and PSBSe have indistinguishable inter-unit bond lengths (1.452 and 1.453 Å) but very different torsion angles (5.3 and 12.8°), which shows that bond length and torsion angle do not necessarily correspond when chemical substitutions are concerned. It also indicates that the acceptor unit Se substitution has minimal effect on this torsion angle. By contrast, we find that the donor unit Se substitution causes a clear decrease in the inter-unit bond length to 1.448 (1.449) Å for PSeBS (PSeBSe). We might expect the larger atom substitution to have a deplanarising effect on the polymer backbone due to steric interactions,57 but instead this shortening of the inter-unit bond length suggests that the donor unit substitution causes an increase in the double-bond character of this bond, resulting in a high degree of planarity.53 The planarity of selenophene containing polymers is understood to arise from the reduced aromaticity caused by the large Se atom.34,53
Raman spectroscopy (above) has already provided experimental evidence for the redistribution of π-electron density resulting from the heteroatom substitutions, but these results are further supported by the DFT calculations. A simple estimation of the charge distribution is given by the Mulliken method of assigning electron density to each atom (see Table 2).58 When the donor unit S is replaced with Se (PSBS to PSeBS) the positive charge on this atom increases from 0.162 to 0.430 e. There is also a corresponding decrease in the charge on the conjugated part of the donor unit (sum of Mulliken charges on the four carbon atoms in the donor unit becomes more negative) from −0.236 to −0.463 e. This supports the suggestion that the Se substitution causes a stronger donation electron density into the conjugated part of the donor unit relative to the S-containing case.
These calculations also suggest that the increased electron density on the conjugated part of the donor unit, caused by the Se substitution, extends into the benzene ring of the acceptor unit too, as evidenced by the reduction in the positive charge on this ring from 0.832 to 0.790 e (PSBS to PSeBS). As a result, the Se substitution increases the electron density along the whole conjugated backbone rather than just the donor unit, and so we attribute the shortening of the inter-unit bond length and its small torsion angle to this effect.
For the case of Se substitution into the acceptor unit (PSBS to PSBSe), we again find that the Se atom has a larger positive charge (0.365 increases to 0.558 e), but in this position, the corresponding electron density is donated into the NC bond resulting in a mesomeric decrease in electron density on the conjugated part of the unit i.e. the benzene ring (positive charge increase from 0.832 to 0.892 e). This electron withdrawing effect correlates with the increase in inter-unit bond length and increased torsion angle between the D and A units, as noted before, but when both the donor and acceptor unit have the Se substitution the electron donating effect restores the planarity of the polymer backbone. We therefore conclude that this torsion arises from the specific pairing of the thiophene donor and benzoselenadiazole acceptor units rather than simply the introduction of the large Se atom. Here we point out an important design rule for D–A copolymers based on these observations: that the pairing of a weaker electron donor unit with the stronger electron accepting unit (i.e. PSBSe) results in the lowest overall electron density on the main conjugated backbone and is unfavourable for backbone planarity, also compromising the absorption coefficient of the low energy absorption band.
We also note that the Mulliken charges on the conjugated backbone correlate with the measured LUMO energy levels. We find that PSeBS has the least positive Mulliken charge (0.790 e) on the conjugated part of the acceptor unit, which may correspond with the shallow LUMO (−3.52 eV) measured for this polymer, though a causal link is not necessarily obvious.12,20 The trends in the HOMO energy levels were also predicted fairly accurately by the DFT calculation (Table 1), as discussed previously.
The results of these DFT geometry optimisation calculations (bond lengths, inter-unit dihedrals, and charge distributions) provide strong support for the experimental analyses of the molecular conformation and optoelectronic properties of the D–A copolymers with different heteroatom substitutions, as discussed above. This consistency also serves to demonstrate the applicability of these methods in understanding the complex factors dictating the properties of D–A copolymers.
3.4. Thin film morphology and device performance
The thin film properties of these materials are of particular significance to device applications, where charge transport is strongly dependent on the molecular conformation and solid state packing. Here we use grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) in conjunction with thin film transistor device characterisation to relate the above results (the polymer conformation at the molecular level) to the macroscopic thin film packing and charge transport in neat films of these copolymers.

Fig. 6 shows 2D GIXRD patterns for thin films of each of the copolymers. All four polymers show an intense arc at around q ≈ 0.2 Å−1 corresponding with the (100) lamellar spacing, and an arc at q ≈ 1.4 Å−1 which is more intense along the qz axis than the qxy axis (except for PSeBS) and corresponds with the (010) π–π spacing. These identifications are based on typical values for other conjugated polymers.59,60 Values for these parameters are given in Table 3 (see ESI† for corresponding scattering line-cut data).

The most clearly defined GIXRD pattern is measured for PSBS indicating that this material has the highest quality of long-range molecular order. The Se substituted polymers all show weaker scattering from the π–π spacing (especially PSeBSe), suggesting that the Se substitution is unfavourable for ordered molecular packing in thin films. All the polymers, except for PSeBS, show long π–π scattering arcs with the maximum intensity in the qz axis, which is characteristic of a low degree of molecular orientation or a slight preference for the molecular backbone to lie in-plane (face-on to the substrate).61 The streak of high intensity above the (100) arc in the qz direction is attributed to specular scattering.60
The measured π–π spacings are around 4.1–4.4 Å, and the lamellar spacings lie in the range 26–38 Å. These values are much larger than the values typically reported for simple conjugated polymers such as regioregular P3HT (3.8–3.9 Å π–π spacing and 15–19 Å lamellar spacing), but match well with values reported for PCDTBT, which has a similar donor–acceptor copolymer structure.52,62 It has been suggested by Lu et al. that PCDTBT adopts a bilayer packing motif in the thin film with an undulating backbone conformation, and it appears that the series of polymers considered in this study follow a similar packing motif.60
Both the π–π and lamellar packing distances increase when Se is substituted for the S atoms. The π–π spacing (measured along the qx axis) is smallest for PSBS (4.10 ± 0.03 Å), and increases when Se is introduced into either the donor or acceptor unit, with a maximum value of 4.36 ± 0.04 Å for PSeBS (4.29 ± 0.04 Å for PSBSe). When Se is substituted into both positions (PSeBSe) the π–π spacing reduces to an intermediate value (4.21 ± 0.04 Å). The increased π–π distance for PSeBS and PSBSe is readily understood as the result of introducing the physically larger Se atom into the molecular backbone, but the reduced spacing for PSeBSe indicates that there is not a simple relationship between the introduction of large atoms and an increase in π–π spacing.11 Similarly, these observations do not correlate clearly with the experimental and DFT results relating to molecular conformation. We found that only PSBSe showed a greater degree of inter-unit bond torsion than the others, but the GIXRD shows that all three Se-containing polymers have a reduced level of long-range molecular order. These results show that the π–π molecular packing distance is not simply related to either the introduction of the larger heteroatom, nor the coplanarity of the polymer backbone, though it is likely that the significant variation in molecular weight and polydispersity of these polymer samples also plays an important role.54,62,63
As well as differences in the π–π spacing, we also measure an increase in the lamellar spacing for the Se containing polymers. Again, the largest packing distance is measured for PSeBS (38.5 ± 3.0 Å), which is much larger than the lamellar spacing in the PSBS film (26.3 ± 2.4 Å). PSBSe and PSeBSe have values close to that of PSeBS, so the clear trend here is that the Se atoms in any position lead to increased lamellar spacing. We note that Se substitution in the simpler case of P3HT does not result in an increased lamellar spacing, so we suggest that the disruption of molecular packing observed here is likely to arise from distortions of the undulating polymer backbone on the scale of several repeat units arising from the heteroatom substitution.29,60,64
The trends observed in the intermolecular packing distances correlate well with the hole mobilities measured for thin films in a transistor architecture (see ESI† for transfer characteristics). PSBS gives the highest mobility (1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1), which we might expect based on it having the shortest π–π spacing and lamellar spacing, as well as the evidence for an overall low degree of energetic disorder. The other three polymers have hole mobilities two orders of magnitude lower, corresponding with their lower quality of intermolecular packing. Interestingly, PSeBS has a similar hole mobility to PSeBSe even though its π–π intermolecular spacing is much larger.
For photovoltaic devices, the polymer is blended with an electron accepting molecule (in this case PC71BM) to create a bulk heterojunction thin film. This represents a much more complex system than the neat polymer films considered so far and is highly sensitive to the processing conditions used. The impact of blending on the device morphology is examined by considering the UV-visible absorption spectra of the blend films, presented in Fig. 7. Here we compare the absorption spectra of a polymer:PC71BM (1:2 weight ratio) blend film with those of the neat materials, and an expected spectrum for the blend assuming a simple linear combination of the spectra for the neat materials in approximately the same blend ratio. Since the optimised photovoltaic device performance was obtained using the DIO additive and thermal annealing (TA), Fig. 7 also compares blend films subjected to these processing conditions with the pristine case deposited from chlorobenzene.
 Fig. 7  UV-visible absorption spectra for polymer:PC71BM (1:2 weight ratio) blend films measured for pristine blend films, and for blend films deposited using the optimised conditions (DIO additive and thermal annealing). These spectra are compared with the expected result based on the assumption that the blend absorption is a linear combination of the neat film spectra (shown as insets) approximately weighted by the blend film ratio. (a) PSBS:PC71BM, (b) PSBSe:PC71BM, (c) PSeBS:PC71BM, and (d) PSeBSe:PC71BM. 
The UV-visible absorption data show that for all four polymers, the measured optical absorption spectrum of the blend film does not match the expected spectrum based on a linear combination of the neat material spectra. This method of calculating ‘expected’ spectra is subject to significant uncertainties based on the densities of the various films and cumulative uncertainties in film thicknesses, but the comparison does indicate that the blend film spectra show a weaker contribution from the lowest energy absorption band of the polymer than expected, and in each the lowest energy absorption shoulder is much less prominent. These observations are indicative of a disruption of the polymer molecular order caused by blending with the PC71BM.48 The addition of DIO combined with thermal annealing has minimal effect on the low energy part of the blend film absorption spectrum associated with the polymer, and a small effect on the higher energy part of the spectrum, which is dominated by the PC71BM absorption. This indicates that this processing has more impact on the morphology of the PC71BM than that of the polymer in the blend film and is most readily understood as the promotion of PC71BM aggregation. We note that this is consistent with some other studies on similar materials, but contrasts with the majority of published results, where the DIO additive and thermal annealing enhance the molecular order of the polymer component.65
Additional insight into the polymer:PC71BM blend film morphologies is gained using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to compare the surface topographies, as shown in Fig. 8 for films deposited using the DIO additive and thermal annealing, which gave the optimised photovoltaic performance. All four blend films show comparable morphologies with similar RMS surface roughnesses (0.32 to 0.47 nm). We do, however, observe that the PSBS:PC71BM blend film exhibits a more clearly developed sub-micrometre domain structure than the others indicating a greater degree of phase separation. All four films (but most clearly, PSBSe and PSeBS) show a number of small, low-lying (dark) spots roughly 100–200 nm across and 1–3 nm deep, which probably represent isolated domains within the more intimately blended matrix of the film. The stronger phase separation in the PSBS:PC71BM blend film can be understood from the relatively high degree of polymer crystallinity for the neat PSBS film shown in the XRD results above, which can drive phase separation.66,67 In contrast, the other neat polymer films exhibited more amorphous XRD scattering results, which correlates well with the lack of a phase separation in the corresponding polymer:PC71BM blend films and is expected to be detrimental to charge generation and transport in photovoltaic devices.26 The current–voltage characteristics for the optimised solar cells are shown in Fig. 9, with numerical parameters given in Table 4.

The photovoltaic performance results clearly show that PSBS produces much more efficient devices (5.2%) than the Se substituted polymers (all <2%). These low efficiencies correspond with reductions in all the key performance parameters (Table 4). The open-circuit voltage (Voc) drops from 0.87 V for PSBS to 0.73 V for PSBSe then further reduces to 0.67 and 0.64 V for PSeBSe and PSeBS. Some of this reduction may be attributed to increases in charge recombination resulting from reduced hole mobility, but it is also in line with the trend in HOMO energy level noted above where shallower HOMO levels for Se substituted polymers are expected to reduce the effective energy gap of the heterojunction.6 Short-circuit currents (Jsc) and fill factors (FF) both show the same trends as the overall power conversion efficiencies (PCE), with the highest values for PSBS, the lowest for PSBSe and intermediate values for PSeBS and PSeBSe. Broadly these indicate that the selenium containing polymers have diminished overall charge transport and extraction capabilities, which is consistent with the weaker phase separation in the blend film observed from the atomic force microscopy (see Fig. 8). Similarly, the XRD and hole mobility data indicate that the molecular packing in the neat polymer for these materials is also unfavourable for charge transport. However, the particularly poor PCE of PSBSe (1.3%) suggests that other effects may be significant since this material had the second highest hole mobility in the neat film and appears to have a similar blend film morphology to PSeBS and PSeBSe. In this case, the low photocurrent is likely to be due (at least in part) to the weak optical absorption in the visible range (see Fig. 2) resulting in poor harvesting of solar photons.7–9
4. Conclusions
The effects of systematic S/Se substitutions into the two different units of a D–A copolymer have been studied in terms of the conformational, morphological, and optoelectronic properties. By combining experimental results with DFT calculations we have been able to understand these effects in terms of differences in the π-electron density distribution resulting from replacement of S with Se.
S/Se atom substitutions have different effects in the donor and acceptor units. In the donor unit, Se mesomerically donates electron density into the conjugated structure compared to S, whereas, when present in the acceptor unit, the Se atom results in a reduction of electron density on the benzene ring within the conjugated backbone. Both of these effects tend to reduce the optical energy gap of the polymer, but the frontier energy level values, absorption transition strengths, intramolecular torsion, and intermolecular packing are strongly dependent on the specific pairing of S/Se containing donor and acceptor units. Based on these complex relationships, which have been discussed in detail, some simple design rules for D–A copolymers can be derived: the pairing of the stronger acceptor unit with the weaker donor (PSBSe) results in particularly low π-electron density on the conjugated backbone and increased intramolecular torsion, resulting in weak optical absorption in the low energy band. This is of particular relevance for photovoltaic applications, where the ‘weak donor-strong acceptor’ strategy has been suggested as a way to obtain a small energy gap and a large open-circuit voltage.12 Our results suggest that this approach compromises the absorption strength and charge transport, and so may be counter-productive. In addition, the larger Se heteroatom is unfavourable for close intermolecular packing in the thin film, resulting in a poor polymer:PC71BM blend film morphology and low charge carrier mobility, and so should be avoided in D–A copolymers for photovoltaic applications.
This study provides a unique insight into the origins of the D–A copolymer properties and reveals that they are determined by a complex interplay between many factors. As a result, we urge caution in the extrapolation of these and other specific conclusions to other copolymer series, but the general relationships and experimental methods have widespread relevance and should be considered for the whole class of D–A copolymers.
