    , Accepted 17th October 2022First published on 31st October 2022AbstractNowadays, the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality has become a global consensus, and electrochemical CO2 reduction to provide high-value power fuel is one of the major technical approaches attracting significant research interests and application prospects. However, the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction in water-based electrolyte systems crowds out the reactive sites of active metals, causing a low CO2 conversion efficiency. In this work, Zn nanosheets were prepared via electrodeposition on the surface of carbon paper and then modified with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to tune the wetting angle of the electrolyte. A CO faradaic efficiency of 90.2% was achieved for Zn NS-8% PTFE (contact angle: 136.8°) at the electrolytic voltage of −1.0 V vs. RHE along with an overall current density of −7.9 mA cm−2. Experimental results and molecular dynamics simulation revealed that PTFE weakened the aggregation of H2O molecules and was more beneficial for capturing and adsorbing CO2 molecules near the electrode surface. The active sites of hydrogen production were transformed into the reaction center for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the hydrophobicity of the electrode, and the accumulation of the local CO2 concentration accelerated the kinetic activity for electrochemical conversion (CO2 to CO). This strategy of tuning the local environment offers an alternative approach for effective electrode manufacturing in liquid electrolytes.
1. Introduction
The incredible rise in CO2 emissions triggered by the expansion of modern human society and industry over the past half-century has resulted in an increasingly severe issues with the greenhouse effect and the melting of polar glaciers.1 Achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutralization of carbon dioxide has become a global consensus among governments. In addition to energy-saving and emission reduction and industrial upgrading to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, there is a need to deplete carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and one promising way to do this is by reducing carbon dioxide into fuels or industrial raw materials with a high commercial value under mild conditions using renewable energy sources such as solar energy and hydropower.2,3 In specific implementations, carbon dioxide can be converted into C1 products, such as HCOOH,4 CH4,5 or CO,6 or other multi-carbon (C2+) products,7,8 where carbon monoxide is not only an important reactant in formaldehyde production and the Fischer–Tropsch process but also a reducing agent for refining nickel,9 tungsten, and other metals in the metallurgical industry, with numerous applications.
Thus far, the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with noble metal-based catalysts has demonstrated the highest performance in terms of the reaction product selectivity. Among these, Guoxiong Wang et al. constructed a Au-CeOx interface by a NaBH4 reduction method with excellent reactivity and faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO);10 Jingli Luo et al. prepared silver nanocubes with side lengths less than 25 nm via a polyol method, which showed a rather surprising FECO of 99.0% at −0.856 V (vs. RHE);11 The NaBH4 reduction technique was again used by Guoxiong Wang et al. to prepare platinum nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼3.7 nm and possessing an FECO of 91.2% at −0.89 V (vs. RHE).12
Compared to noble metals, nonprecious-material-based cathodes of Fe and Co are highly selective for CO2-to-CO conversion.13,14 However, metallic Zn also offers a significant cost advantage and promising prospects in the reductive degradation of carbon dioxide.15 Haotian Wang et al. developed Li electrochemical tuning of Zn nanoparticles on carbon fiber paper through a dip-coating and thermal annealing method, achieving a maximal FECO of 71% at −0.8 V vs. RHE.16 The application, however, still faces several hurdles, especially that the whole reaction takes place in an aqueous system.17 The wettability of zinc with the electrolyte is too good, and the solubility of carbon dioxide in the electrolyte is low,18–20 resulting in the hydrogen evolution reaction occupying its active center. Thus the inhibition of hydrolysis is critical for increasing the reaction efficiency of zinc. According to Henry's law, high pressure can increase the solubility of carbon dioxide,21,22 thereby improving the performance of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. On the other hand, moving the process to a non-aqueous solvent system, that is, utilizing ionic liquids as the electrolyte, could also improve the reaction efficiency.23 However, these extreme operating conditions and the high cost of the above strategies reduce the low-cost advantage of zinc, which is not favorable for the large-scale industrial application of zinc-based catalysts, thus limiting their continued development.
In our previous work, we found that a positive-charged group on the surfactant (hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide) prevents protons from gathering near the electrode surface, thus making it difficult for protons to be reduced to hydrogen on nearby Zn nanosheets. A long carbon chain of the surfactant offers a mass-transfer passage to the electrode surface for CO2.24 Tuning the microenvironment of the electrode can lead to efficient electrochemical conversion (CO2 to CO). PTFE has respectable hydrophobicity, and its combination with zinc may effectively discharge the electrolyte from the electrode surface, thereby increasing the local CO2 concentration and inhibiting the conversion of protons to hydrogen, which would be expected to greatly boost the conversion rate of carbon monoxide. Hongbing Yu et al. added PTFE into the catalyst layer of a gas diffusion electrode with Sn catalyst to accelerate CO2 diffusion for electrochemical conversion (CO2 to HCOOH).25 However, their work lacked sufficient experimental evidence and a deep characterization of the role of PTFE.
In this work, uniform zinc nanosheets were electrochemically deposited on the surface of carbon paper and coated with different concentration of PTFE latex to tailor the local environment for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. The Zn nanosheets with an optimized electrolyte contact angle (136.8°) achieved a carbon monoxide faradaic efficiency of 90.2% at the electrolytic voltage of −1.0 V vs. RHE accompanied by an overall current density of −7.9 mA cm−2. The experimental results showed that the hydrophobicity of the electrode reduced the interaction of the electrolyte/electrode interface and suppressed the hydrogen evolution reaction of the electrolyte after PTFE modification. The CO2 accumulated on the electrode surface and promoted the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that PTFE is inclined to capture and absorb CO2. This technique provides a fresh perspective on effective electrode manufacturing in liquid electrolytes.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemical reagents
Zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4·7H2O, AR), nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O, AR), polytetrafluoroethylene latex ((C2F4)n, 60 wt%) isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O, AR), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, AR), and DMSO (C2H6SO, AR) were all bought from Aladdin. Nafion solution (D-521, 5 wt%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Acetone, hydrochloric acid, and ethanol with analytical purity were all obtained from Sinopharm. All the chemical reagents were not further treated.
2.2 Characterizations
The micromorphology of the prepared electrodes was assessed through SEM on a Hitachi SU8100 system at the voltage of 5 kV. The components in the electrodes were confirmed through XRD on a Shimadzu LabX XRD-6000 system using Cu Kα as the radiation with incident wavelength of 1.54 Å and a scan rate of 5 degree per min. The lattice spacing and elements mapping of the samples were tested through TEM on an FEI TF20 system at the voltage of 200 kV. The element information in the samples was measured by XPS on an Escalab 250XI system from Thermo, and the target was Al Kα radiation with an energy of 1486.7 eV. The functional group of PTFE was probed by FT-IR on a Nicolet iS10 system equipped with an ATR detector. The contact angle was determined on an LSA-100 system from LAUDA Scientific GmbH, and the test liquid was 0.5 mol L−1 potassium bicarbonate solution.
2.3 Manufacture of the working electrode
Carbon paper (HCP020P, Shanghai Hesen) was sequentially ultrasonicated in hydrochloric acid solution (5 M), ethanol, acetone, and deionized water to clean the surface for 30 min. Then, the cleaned carbon paper was put into an oven to evaporate the residual liquid at 60 °C for 12 h.
The Zn NSs were manufactured in 0.5 M ZnSO4 electrolyte through electrodeposition with a Pt foil electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode using the constant current mode (−150 mA cm−2). The electrodeposition time was 60 s, and the electrode area immersed in the electrolyte was 1 cm2. Then, the Zn NS electrode was placed under an infrared lamp to dry out the moisture for 20 min.
The polytetrafluoroethylene latex (60 wt%) was diluted to three concentrations (4, 8 and 16 wt%) with ultrapure water. Diluted polytetrafluoroethylene latex (40 microliter) was dropped onto the Zn NS electrode with a pipette gun to prepare the Zn NS-x% PTFE (where x = 4, 8 and 16) electrode, followed by drying under an infrared baking lamp for 20 min. The Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) electrode was heated in a horizontal furnace with a continuous argon flow at 350 °C, and kept at that temperature for half an hour. In contrast, carbon paper and the Zn NS electrode were heated in a quartz tube under the same conditions as the Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) electrode.
The nickel was grown on carbon paper in 0.5 M NiSO4 solution through electrodeposition at −25 mA cm−2 for 5 min. Nickel coated with PTFE (8 wt%) was prepared as per the above method. The samples were labeled as Ni and Ni-8% PTFE.
The carbon paper coated with PTFE (8 wt%) was fabricated as per the above method. The sample was denoted as CP-8% PTFE.
2.4 Electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical measurements were completed in a typical two-chamber cell (Gaoss Union) using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Instruments). The electrolyte was separated through DuPont Nafion®117, which can only transport protons. Each chamber was filled with 30 mL of 0.5 M KHCO3 solution. The test device was paired with a Ag/AgCl and platinum foil electrode (2 × 2 cm). High-purity carbon dioxide (99.999%) was introduced into the electrolyte with 50 sccm using a mass flow meter (Beijing Sevenstar, D07-7K) for 30 min to saturate CO2 and remove any dissolved oxygen and residual air in the cathode chamber. The pH of the electrolyte was measured with a pH meter (Shanghai INESA, PHS-3E) after introducing carbon dioxide for half an hour. All the applied potentials needed to be converted as below: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. reference) + 0.197 V + 0.05916 × pH.26 LSV plots were executed from −0.6 to −1.1 V (vs. RHE), and the scanning step was 10 mV per s. The ESCA was evaluated via double-layer capacitance (Cdl),27 which was evaluated through linear fitting of the ampere density difference at −0.45 V and scanning steps from 40–120 mV s−1. Single oxidative linear sweep voltammetry was performed with a Ag/AgCl and platinum foil electrode (2 × 2 cm), and the solution was potassium hydroxide solution (0.1 M) after filling with nitrogen for half an hour.28–30 The EIS was tested at −0.7 V.
2.5 Product analysis
The tail gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC9860). The FEs of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were calculated by the following equation:31  where ppm refers to the carbon monoxide and hydrogen concentration obtained from chromatography, the flow rate is for CO2, n is the electron-transfer number, 96485 C mol−1 is for F, 101325 Pa is for P, 8.314 J mol−1 K−1 is for R, T represents the ambient temperature, and Itotal represents the current density.
The electrolyte after the test was analyzed on a 400 MHz Bruker Advance system. The liquid sample consisted of 300 μL catholyte, 200 μL D2O, and 100 μL DMSO (1/1000, v/v). The scan number was 64.
2.6 Molecular dynamics simulation
We built two models: Model 1, which consisted of 3000 H2O molecules and 80 CO2 molecules distributed on the surface of solid Zn; and Model 2, which consisted of 7 PTFE molecules with chain lengths of 20 C, 3000 H2O molecules, and 80 CO2 molecules placed on the surface of solid Zn. Each model was in a periodic orthogonal box. In order to eliminate the influence caused by periodicity, a 6 nm vacuum layer was added under the solid Zn substrate along the z direction. The solid Zn substrate was set to be rigid to ensure that the substrate atoms were fixed during the simulation. The temperature of each model was maintained at 298 K by using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat with a damping factor of 100 fs.32 The two model systems reached equilibrium at 20 ns. For further relaxation and analysis, we simulated another 2 ns. We used the tip3p model for H2O.33 For CO2, we used the force field published by Shi et al.34 For the Zn atom, we adopted the force field published by Gu et al.35 For PTFE, we used the opls-aa force field.36 For different types of atoms, we used the Lorentz–Berthelot mixed potential to deal with the van der Waals interaction.
3. Results and discussion
The PTFE-coated Zn NS was prepared through a two-step process. First, Zn NS was grown on carbon paper through electrodeposition in 0.5 mol L−1 ZnSO4 electrolyte using the constant current mode (−150 mA cm−2) for 60 s; Second, various concentrations of PTFE solution (4%, 8% and 16%) were dripped on the surface of Zn NS with the same volume (40 μL), recorded as Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16), following by heating in an argon atmosphere at 350 °C for half an hour. For comparison, the Zn NS without PTFE modification was also treated in the same condition. The morphology and structure of the prepared samples were first confirmed through SEM and TEM. Before electrodeposition, the surface of the carbon paper was cleaned and smoothed (Fig. S1a and b†). After electrodeposition, the carbon paper was covered with nanosheets (Fig. 1a and b). PTFE coverage on the surface of Zn NS increased as the PTFE concentration increased (Fig. 1c–h). Especially, the surface of Zn NS was almost completely covered by PTFE when the concentration was 16% (Fig. 1g and h). The TEM images displayed that the as-prepared samples from the electrodeposition were composed of the nanosheets structure (Fig. S2a† and Fig. 1i). The lattice distance (0.246 nm) of Zn NS and Zn NS-8%PTFE was equivalent to the (002) of metal Zn (Fig. S2b† and Fig. 1i).37 The distribution of the Zn element in Zn NS and Zn NS-8%PTFE, as well as the F element in Zn NS-8%PTFE, was homogeneous under the HADDF-STEM mode (Fig. 1j–l, Fig. S2c and d†).

The accurate composition of Zn NS and Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) on carbon paper was further confirmed by XRD. The diffraction peaks were only assigned to metal Zn (PDF # 01-1238) and carbon (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that Zn2+ in 0.5 M ZnSO4 solution was reduced to metal Zn through electrodeposition and successfully deposited on carbon paper. The metallic Zn grew along (002) with a lower thermodynamic free energy on carbon paper via electrodeposition, so the Zn (002) intensity was higher than for Zn (101),38 which was consistent with the SEM and TEM results in Fig. 1. In addition, the PTFE modified on the surface of Zn NS did not change the phase of Zn NS. The FTIR spectra of Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) displayed two C–F bond vibration peaks at 1146 and 1201 cm−1 (Fig. 2b),39,40 meanwhile C–F bonds did not appear with the clean carbon paper and Zn NS without PTFE modification, confirming that the C–F bonds only originated from PTFE modified on the surface of Zn NS. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of Zn 2p also proved the deposition of metal Zn on carbon paper (Fig. 2c). Compared with Zn NS, the binding energy of Zn 2p in Zn NS-8% PTFE remained unchanged, revealing that PTFE did not affect the electronic structure of Zn NS (Fig. 2c). The intensity of the XPS spectra of Zn 2p in Zn NS-8% PTFE was weaker than that of Zn NS, which was affected by the PTFE modified on the surface of Zn NS. The signal of the XPS spectrum of F 1s in Zn NS-8% PTFE was also detected with a peak at 689 eV in Fig. 2d, while clean carbon paper displayed no signal peak for F 1s, demonstrating that the photoelectron spectroscopy signal of fluorine only came from PTFE. This conclusion was consistent with the results from the FTIR spectra in Fig. 2b.

To understand the role of PTFE in the electrocatalytic process, we explored the contact angle of the electrolyte and CO2 bubble state over the surface of Zn NS and PTFE-coated Zn NS on carbon paper. The contact angles of the electrolyte on Zn NS and Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) were measured with a drop of approximately 5 μL of 0.5 mol L−1 KHCO3 electrolyte (Fig. 3a–d). The contact angle of the electrolyte on Zn NS (36.1°) was lower than for Zn NS-4% PTFE (128.3°), Zn NS-8% PTFE (136.8°), and Zn NS-16% PTFE (143°), demonstrating that the electrode surface's hydrophobicity was enhanced after modification with various concentrations of PTFE. The CO2 bubble in the electrolyte remained unchanged over the surface of Zn NS within 4 s (Fig. 3e), while it quickly vanished over the surface of Zn NS-8% PTFE in less than 0.062 s (Fig. 3f). It could be inferred that PTFE was favorable for the adsorption and accumulation of CO2 molecules. Thus, we can confirm that the PTFE-modified Zn NS on carbon paper has the potential advantage of reducing the enrichment of electrolytes and increasing the carbon dioxide concentration nearby the electrode surface.

The electrochemical evaluation for the selectivity and activity were accomplished in a conventional H-cell (experimental details in the ESI†). The cathodic polarization curves of Zn NS and Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) on carbon paper were recorded via LSV test, with a potential of −0.6 to −1.1 V (Fig. 4a). The as-prepared samples’ total current density improved as the applied voltage moved toward more negative potential. Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) showed a lower total current density than Zn NS, meanwhile the total current density of Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) decreased with the increase in PTFE concentration over the whole applied potential. This result was caused by the nonconductive PTFE. Multi-potential steps were employed to evaluate the selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 by online GC and NMR. No liquid signals appeared in the NMR spectra (Fig. S3†). The gaseous products were H2 and CO (Fig. 4b and Fig. S4†). Zn NS with a higher intensity of (002) exhibited an FECO below 43.6% during the applied voltage in Fig. 4b, while the hydrogen evolution reaction was apparent in Fig S4.† This is because Zn (002) favored H2 evolution and Zn (101) was inclined to generate CO during electrochemical conversion (CO2 to CO).41 In contrast with Zn NS, the FECO of Zn NS modified with PTFE enhanced the overall potential (Fig. 4b). Especially, the optimal polytetrafluoroethylene-modified Zn NS (Zn NS-8%PTFE) achieved the maximal FECO (90.2%) at the applied voltage of −1.0 V, which showed its superior CO faradaic efficiency in contrast with the reported catalysts in Table S1.† The FECO of Zn NS modified with PTFE increased with the enhancement of the PTFE concentration (4% and 8%). However, the FECO decreased when the PTFE concentration was further increased to 16%, because excessive PTFE occupied the active sites of Zn NS. Furthermore, the jCO of Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) was larger than that of Zn NS (Fig. 4c), indicating the enhancement of activity after PTFE modification. Zn NS-8%PTFE offered a maximal jCO of −10.9 mA cm−2 related to −1.1 V. Due to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature of PTFE, as shown in Fig. 3, the electrolyte concentration on the electrode surface decreased and the carbon dioxide concentration increased, which enhanced the property for CO generation and inhibited the HER. However, excessive PTFE would cover the active sites of Zn NS, resulting in a decrease in the FECO and jCO.

The stability is also an important parameter to evaluate catalysts. Zn NS-8%PTFE was shown to be stable in long-term testing for 12 hours without apparent attenuation of the FECO or the total current density under the potentiostatic mode of −1.0 V (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the XRD patterns and FTIR spectra showed that Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) maintained its initial structure and components after electrocatalytic carbon dioxide conversion to CO (Figs S5 and S6†). The contact angles of the electrolyte on Zn NS significantly decreased from 36.1° to 14.9° after electrocatalytic carbon dioxide conversion to CO, while the contact angles of the electrolyte on Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) slightly decreased (Table S2, Fig. 3 and Fig. S7†). This result revealed the stability of Zn NS modified with PTFE during the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide conversion to CO.
To acquire more insights into the inherent activity and selectivity of Zn NS modified with PTFE for electrochemical carbon dioxide conversion to carbon monoxide, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), EIS plots, Tafel slope analysis, and single oxidative LSV were carried out (Fig. 5). The ECSA was confirmed via the double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The Cdl for Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) was lower than that of Zn NS (804.8 μF cm−2) (Fig. 5a and Fig. S8†), revealing the reduced contact between the electrolyte and the catalyst because of the hydrophobicity of PTFE and because of the carbon dioxide accumulation nearby the electrode surface. The Rct for Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) was larger than that of Zn NS (Fig. 5b), which could be ascribed to the insulated PTFE. The Tafel slope was deduced from 153 to 118 mV dec−1 after PTFE modification (Fig. 5c), and indicated an enhancement of the kinetic activity for electrochemical CO2 conversion over Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16). Moreover, the value of 118 mV dec−1 indicated that the construction of CO2˙−(CO2 + e− → CO2˙−) limited the whole reaction.42,43 The accumulation of the CO2 concentration nearby the electrode surface accelerated the formation of CO2˙− after PTFE was modified on the surface of Zn NS, but excessive nonconductive PTFE hindered charge transfer and led to the increase in the Tafel slope of Zn NS-16% PTFE (125 mV dec−1). Because intermediate CO2˙− is prone to change in aqueous electrolytes, OH− was used as an alternate to assess the binding capability of CO2˙− with the as-prepared samples via single oxidative linear sweep voltammetry plots recorded with 0.1 mol L−1 potassium hydroxide electrolyte, which was dissolved in excessive N2 for half an hour before the test.29,30 The potential for the OH− adsorption ability of Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) was more negative than that of Zn NS (Fig. 5d), which indicated that the OH− adsorption ability of Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) was stronger than that of Zn NS.44,45 Thus, it could be deduced from the above result that CO2˙− was more stable on Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16) than Zn NS, which was valuable for carbon dioxide activation and CO generation over the Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16). The synergistic effect of the enlarged local CO2 concentration and hydrophobicity improved the conversion of CO2 to CO over PTFE-modified Zn NS.

(c) Tafel slopes of Zn NS and Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16). (d) Single oxidative linear sweep voltammetry plots for Zn NS and Zn NS-x% PTFE (x = 4, 8 and 16). 
To confirm whether Zn is critical for the formation of CO, we also tested the performance of carbon paper and nickel coated with PTFE (Fig. S9†). CP-8%PTFE showed a lower current density than CP under the applied voltage (−0.6 to −1.1 V vs. RHE), which was caused by the insulated PTFE (Fig. S9a†). For CP and CP-8%PTFE, the FE of hydrogen was near to 100%, while the FECO was almost zero from −0.7 to −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. S9b†). CP and CP-8%PTFE showed no response for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to CO, and the only gaseous product was hydrogen. There was no signal for other liquid products in the NMR spectrum, except for the water peak and internal standard (Fig. S9c†). The performances of Ni and Ni-8%PTFE were similar to CP and CP-8%PTFE (Fig. S9d–f†). Ni-8%PTFE was active for the hydrogen evolution reaction, but it was not applicable for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to CO. Thus, we can confirm that Zn is vital for the production of CO.
In order to further reveal the effect of PTFE on the diffusion and distribution of CO2 and H2O, we conducted molecular dynamics simulation with LAMMPS software package.46 We constructed two models, one was pure Zn NS, and the other was Zn NS modified with PTFE. In each model, 3000 H2O molecules and 80 CO2 molecules were filled in the simulation box. CO2 molecules were limited in a spherical area and given an initial velocity toward the catalyst. Fig. 6a shows that the system reached the equilibrium condition in 20 ns. However, CO2 molecules remained unchanged in the spherical region and did not diffuse to Zn NS. We continued to simulate for another 2 ns. The CO2 molecules still stayed in the spherical region far away from the Zn NS surface. The diffusion process of CO2 and H2O molecules toward Zn NS-PTFE is shown in Fig. 6b. The CO2 molecules rapidly diffused toward Zn NS-PTFE after a given velocity. The CO2 molecules in the spherical area were captured by PTFE and dispersed on the catalyst surface at 5 ns. When the system relaxed to 20 ns and 22 ns, it reached equilibrium. We also calculated the density of CO2 and H2O molecules in the unit space along the z direction. The peak position of density for H2O molecules (0.3 nm) did not change significantly, but the number of H2O molecules at the peak position decreased significantly and the overall trend of H2O molecules was away from the catalyst surface for Zn NS-PTFE (Fig. 6c). After PTFE was modified on the Zn NS surface, the peak position of the density for CO2 molecules moved forward from 2 nm to 0.3 nm, and then the CO2 molecules were generally closer to Zn NS-PTFE (Fig. 6d). Molecular dynamics simulation proved that the hydrophobicity of PTFE weakened the aggregation of H2O molecules on the electrode surface, and the Zn NS modified with PTFE was beneficial to capture and adsorb CO2 molecules and enhance the local concentration of CO2 on the electrode surface.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we prepared PTFE-modified Zn NS on carbon paper to tune the local environment of electrode for electrochemical carbon dioxide conversion to CO. The Zn NS-8% PTFE on carbon paper demonstrated an FECO of 90.2% with an ampere density of −7.9 mA cm−2 and electrolytic potential of −1.0 V, as well as respectable stability. Contact angle tests, molecular dynamics simulation, and electrochemical performance tests revealed that the appropriate hydrophobicity and enriched CO2 concentration over PTFE-modified Zn NS jointly improved the CO faradaic efficiency. This method provides an alternative direction for the preparation of high-efficiency electrodes for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO.
