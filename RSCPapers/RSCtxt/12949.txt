    , Accepted 10th April 2017First published on 11th April 2017AbstractExcess electrons from photo-excitation, impurities and defects play a significant role in the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite in air. However, this role has not fully been understood. Herein, the interactions between the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface and O2 molecules in the presence of mobile excess electrons were studied by density functional theory calculations. Our results show that molecular O2 only weakly interacts with the perovskite surface. However, a superoxide, which is formed from the reaction between a molecular oxygen and an excess electron, reacts readily with the perovskite surface by forming a Pb–O covalent bond with a surface Pb ion. By further introducing an excess electron, the superoxide is converted into a peroxide and the two O atoms form two covalent bonds with the surface Pb in a side-on configuration. With the additional electron, the activation energy of the O–O bond dissociation is significantly reduced compared to that of the superoxide. During these processes, the local Pb–I octahedral structure disintegrates. The formation of the Pb–O covalent bonds can be the precursor of the PbO in the degradation products. An additional O2 or H2O molecule was found to only physisorb on the degraded surface with no chemical reactions. However, the physisorbed O2 can readily abstract an excess electron to form a superoxide and the resulting superoxide spontaneously forms an additional Pb–O bond with the surface Pb. Through this study, we identify a pathway for the formation of the PbO local structure and demonstrate the key roles of mobile excess electrons and oxygens in MAPbI3 degradation.
1 Introduction
The inorganic–organic hybrid metal–halide perovskite material has attracted great attention in the past few years as one of the most promising three-dimensional (3D) semiconductors for solar cell applications.1–3 The structures of this metal–halide perovskite are generally represented by the chemical formula AMX3, where A is an organic cation (such as CH3NH3+), M is a divalent metal cation (Pb2+, Sn2+, etc.) and X is a halide ion (Cl−, Br−, I−).4,5 The outstanding virtues of perovskite materials are based on their tunable band gap, high electron and hole mobility, as well as strong optical absorption.4–7 In particular, due to the rapidly growing research in perovskite solar cells, the power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have surpassed 22%.8,9
However, one of the major shortcomings of the inorganic–organic hybrid metal–halide perovskites, especially for CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite, is that it is an easily degradable material in humid air and under sunlight.10–13 A number of research groups have reported light-induced fast decomposition of MAPbI3 perovskite under humid air conditions.14–22 Yet, the actual degradation mechanism has been highly controversial. In earlier research, researchers mainly focused on the influence of the humidity (i.e., the amount of moisture) in air and light on the degradation mechanism. The degradation of MAPbI3 was accelerated by increased humidity and irradiation intensity of light.15 Several degradation products (e.g. CH3NH2, HI, MAI, PbI2, I2, MAPbI3·H2O, etc.) have been identified in the experiments.23–26 But, relatively speaking, the study of the detriment of MAPbI3 in the presence of molecular oxygen (O2) is limited. Haque and coworkers27 reported that Al2O3/MAPbPbI3 active layers decomposed in dry air under illumination. They found that superoxide (O2−) species were formed via reactions between photo-generated electrons and molecular oxygens. Later, Ptasinska et al.28 and Tang et al.29 respectively observed a series of lead salts, such as lead monoxide (including α-PbO and β-PbO) and Pb(OH)2, as the degradation products under the humid air conditions and illumination. On the other hand, Bryant et al.30 showed that removing excess electrons in the perovskite film using electron extraction layers slowed down the decomposition of the perovskite in the presence of light and oxygen.
Meanwhile, density function theory (DFT) simulations have been powerful tools to reveal the microscopic details of the degradation mechanism of perovskite materials.31–40 The theoretical study of Grancini et al.40 demonstrated that water molecules can be spontaneously incorporated into the MAPbI3 perovskite lattice (an exothermic process) while oxygen molecules are unfavorably incorporated into the bulk of the perovskite (an endothermic process). Recently, Li and coworkers34 showed that oxygen molecules interact strongly with the PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surface while the interactions between the O2 and the MAI-terminated surface are weak. These studies have provided important understanding of the interaction of water and O2 with the perovskite materials. However, the role of excess electrons together with oxygen in the decomposition process of MAPbI3 have not been investigated in these DFT studies. In fact, excess electrons from photo-excitation, atomic impurities and intrinsic defects are expected to play non-negligible roles in the perovskite degradation under humid air conditions.27,30,41–48 As discussed in previous studies, excess electrons can be delocalized or localized.42,49 For the former, the electrons would be present in the conduction band and are mobile. For the latter, the electrons can be trapped at defects or a regular lattice as polarons. We focus in this work the mobile excess electrons. Studying their behaviors in the decomposition process is crucial for the improvement of the stability of perovskite solar cells.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of mobile excess electrons in the degradation of MAPbI3 in the presence of molecular O2. The paper is organized as follows: the computational methodologies are discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we first studied the behavior of O2 molecules and superoxides on the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface. As discussed earlier, superoxides can be formed on the perovskite surface when molecular oxygens react with excess electrons. After that, we investigated the impact of additional H2O and O2 on the degradation of the MAPbI3 (110) surface. Additional electrons were also introduced to the surface to further study the role of excess electrons in the perovskite degradation. Lastly, we conclude our work in Section 4.
2 Computational methodology
Experimental crystalline MAPbI3 at room temperature has a tetragonal structure with the unit cell dimensions: a = 8.88 Å and c = 12.63 Å.50 In this study, a slab model of the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface was created by cleaving the bulk perovskite cell of four formula units of MAPbI3. Then a  (17.8 Å × 17.8 Å) surface supercell was constructed. This (110) surface was modeled using a repeated slab of 2.5 MAPbI3 layers (a thickness of 15.5 Å) and a vacuum gap of 12 Å. The chemical formula of this pristine surface is (MAPbI3)16(MAI)8, which contains 264 atoms. Decomposition is expected to occur simultaneously on perovskite surfaces of different orientations and different terminations due to its poor stability.10 The MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface was chosen in this work as the prototypical model due to its importance in the performance of perovskite solar cells suggested in previous studies.51–54 Gamma point sampling of the reciprocal space is adequate for this system due to the large size of the supercell. Fig. 1a and b show the top-view and the side-view of the structurally optimized model.

(c) and (d) The O2 molecule physisorption configurations at two adsorption sites. The spin densities are shown as the yellow contour surfaces. 
Density-functional theory (DFT)55,56 calculations were performed with the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package.57 Spin-polarized calculations were carried out using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional,58 and the ultra-soft scalar relativistic pseudopotentials.59 To correct for the spurious dispersion interactions in DFT, the van der Waals (vdw) correction of Grimme et al.60,61 was also adopted in our simulations. A plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cutoffs of 30 and 250 Ry was used for the wave functions and augmented charge density, respectively. Systems with excess electrons were simulated by adjusting the total number of electrons in the simulation cell. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is a plane-wave package with the periodic boundary conditions. In the study of charged systems, a compensating jellium background is introduced to avoid the diverging Coulomb contributions to the total energy. The adsorption energies of different molecular species on the perovskite surface were calculated using the following equation: Eads = E(adsorbates/surface) − E(adsorbates) − E(surface), where E(surface), E(adsorbates), and E(adsorbates/surface) are the total energy of the MAPbI3 surface, the adsorbates (O2 or H2O in this study) and the surface adsorbed with the adsorbates, respectively. The energy profiles of different reactions and diffusion processes in the degradation were obtained using constrained optimization DFT calculations or the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.62 To determine the charge state of the ions in the perovskite structure, the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF)63–65 analysis was adopted using the Wannier90 package.66
3 Result and discussion
3.1 Interaction between an O2 and the MAPbI3 surface
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the most energetically favorable orientation of the top-layer MA (MA = CH3NH3+) cations has their NH3 group pointing downward. As suggested in our previous studies,32,35 this downward orientation allows the formation of more halide–hydrogen hydrogen bonds, leading to a more stable structure. To study the interaction of O2 with the perovskite surface, we introduced an O2 molecule to two stable adsorption sites of the surface (one close to the NH3 group of a MA cation, and the other one close to a Pb in the top layer). Fig. 1c and d show the optimized adsorption configurations for these two cases. We found that there is no chemical reaction between the O2 and the surface in the two cases, which is consistent with the theoretical study of Li and coworkers.34 The physisorption processes are exothermic with the adsorption energies for the configurations in Fig. 1c and d being −20.8 and −12.6 kcal mol−1, respectively. The O–O bond lengths of the O2 is 1.25 Å in both cases. This value is close to the bond length of an isolated O2 in our PBE calculations (d(O–O) = 1.24 Å). The spin density of the two adsorption structures was found to localize entirely at the dioxygen as also shown in Fig. 1c and d further confirming that it is a molecular O2 with the triplet spin state.
3.2 Interaction between a superoxide and the MAPbI3 surface
As discussed earlier, superoxide (O2−) species can be formed via the reaction between molecular oxygens and photo-generated electrons in the perovskites.27 We studied in this subsection the interaction between the resulting superoxide and the MAPbI3 surface. Two different adsorption sites were again considered. In the first case, the superoxide is placed close to the hydrogens of the NH3 group of the MA cation. Upon relaxation, one proton in the NH3 groups is transferred into O2−, forming a hydroperoxyl radical (OOH) (Fig. 2a). The O–O bond length (d(O–O) = 1.33 Å) is longer than that of an O2 molecule on the pristine MAPbI3 surface (d(O–O) = 1.25 Å). This value agrees well with the O–O bond length of an isolated OOH radical in our PBE calculations (d(O–O) = 1.33 Å). Fig. 2a also shows that the spin density of the system which primarily localizes on the two O atoms. The total magnetization of the optimized system is equal to 1.00 bohr mag per cell, showing that there is one unpaired electron in the system. This further confirms that the resulting adsorbate is an OOH radical.

The color code for different atoms is the same as in Fig. 1. The spin densities are shown as the yellow contour surfaces. 
In the second adsorption configuration, the O2− species is placed close to a Pb ion on the surface. Upon relaxation, a Pb–O bond (d(Pb–O) = 2.41 Å) is spontaneously formed (Fig. 2b). The O–O bond length (d(O–O) = 1.33 Å) is longer than that of an isolated O2− species in our PBE calculations (d(O–O) = 1.29 Å), which indicates that the bond is weakened by the formation of the Pb–O covalent bond. This adsorption configuration is more stable than the first one by 9.1 kcal mol−1. To investigate the effects of the supercell size in the study of charged systems, we also performed DFT calculations using a larger supercell with the vacuum gap increased to 16 Å. The comparison of the structural and energetic results is shown in Section SI1 of the ESI.† The results were found to be unaffected by the increase of the supercell size. Fig. 2b also shows the spin density of this configuration which is localized on the two O atoms. Since the overall magnetization of the relaxed structure is also 1.00 bohr mag per cell, the resulting adsorbed species still exhibits the O2− characteristics. It should be noted that the formation of the Pb–O covalent bonds can be the precursor and the local structure of α-PbO and β-PbO which were found in the degradation products.28 In the α-PbO phase, each Pb forms four equivalent Pb–O bonds with the oxygens with the bond length of 2.30 Å.67 For β-PbO, each Pb is involved in three unequal Pb–O bonds with the oxygens of bond lengths 2.21, 2.22, and 2.49 Å.67 In order for this second adsorption configuration to transform into α-PbO or β-PbO, the O–O bond of the O2− would need to break. We calculated the O–O bond dissociation energy using constrained optimization. Fig. 2e shows the bond dissociation energy profile. The transition state configuration (Fig. 2c) has a O–O distance of 1.85 Å, and the activation energy of +30.8 kcal mol−1. The O–O distance in the final structure (Fig. 2d) is 2.38 Å is slightly lower in energy than the initial structure by −0.4 kcal mol−1. The large activation energy suggests that the superoxide O–O bond cleavage is kinetically unfavorable. The spin densities are also shown in Fig. 2c and d. The spin spreads from the two oxygens to a nearby iodide.
3.3 The role of excess electrons in enhanced MAPbI3 degradation
Since the second adsorption configuration discussed in Subsection 3.2 is energetically more favorable than the first one, we focused in the subsequent study on the degradation process from this configuration. To study the role of excess electrons in perovskite degradation, we added one electron to the system before the O–O bond cleavage (Fig. 2b). In fact, we also introduced an electron to the less stable first adsorption configuration (Fig. 2a). Our calculations confirmed that the subsequent reaction pathway is kinetically unfavorable for this case as discussed in Section SI2 of the ESI.†

Fig. 3a shows the optimized structure after the introduction of an electron to the structure in Fig. 2b. The overall magnetization was found to be zero, suggesting that the dioxygen spontaneously abstracted the excess electron to form an O22− species. A proton from a nearby MA cation also spontaneously transferred to the O22− species. An OOH− species was therefore formed via this proton-coupled electron transfer process. Moreover, this resulting OOH− forms two Pb–O covalent bonds with the Pb ion (d(Pb–O) = 2.21, 2.43 Å) instead of one Pb–O bond in the case without the excess electron. The O–O bond length was found to be 1.50 Å, which is longer than that of an isolated OOH− species in our PBE calculations (d(O–O) = 1.43 Å). The O–O bond in the OOH− species is weakened by the formation of two Pb–O covalent bonds.

(c) The optimized structure after the dissociation of the O–O bond in the OOH−. (d) The energy profile along the dissociation of the O–O bond in the OOH−. The color code for different atoms is the same as in Fig. 1. 
We performed constrained optimization to evaluate the energy profile of the O–O bond dissociation. The transition state, the final state and the energy profile are shown in Fig. 3b, c and d, respectively. The activation energy is +11.7 kcal mol−1. The excess electron and the formation of an additional covalent bond with the Pb greatly lowers the barrier for the O–O bond dissociation. The distances between selected atoms in Fig. 3a and c are shown in Table 1. From the table, before the dissociation of the O–O bond, the Pba–I4, Pba–I5 and Pba–I6 ion distances are larger than 3.9 Å, which are significantly longer than the experimental Pb–I bond distance (d(Pb–I) = 3.2 Å (ref. 50)). It shows that the local Pb–I octahedral structure of the perovskite surface is degraded by the OOH− adsorption. After the dissociation of the O–O bond, the perovskite surface further decomposes. Only the Pba–I2 distance (3.12 Å) is close to the experimental value of 3.2 Å. Moreover, one of the oxygens (Ob) also forms a covalent bond with I1 as shown in Table 1. The Pb was found to react readily with the oxygens by displacing the iodide. This is a possible precursor of the formation of a local PbO structure.

3.4 The role of O2 and H2O in the subsequent reactions
As reported in previous studies32,35 and in Subsection 3.1, the pristine MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface is robust against reactions with molecular O2 and H2O. In this subsection, we investigated the possible reaction of these molecules with the degraded. At first, a water molecule is placed close to the local PbO structure in Fig. 3c. The optimized structure is shown in Fig. 4a (top view) and Fig. 4b (side view). The adsorption energy of H2O on the degraded surface is −18.8 kcal mol−1. The distance between the Pb and the O of the H2O molecule is 3.02 Å, which is significantly larger than the experimental Pb–O bond length in α-PbO and β-PbO. We also tried to force the formation of a Pb–O bond between the Pb and the O of the H2O molecule. But the forced Pb–O bond broke after optimization. As shown in Fig. 4c, the projected density of states (pDOS) shows a weak overlap between the electronic orbitals of the oxygen of the H2O and the Pb. On the other hand, there is strong bonding character between the Pb and the two oxygens in the local PbO structure as suggested by their pDOS (Fig. 4d and e).

(d) The pDOS of the Pb ion and the oxygen bonded to both the Pb and I. (e) The pDOS of the Pb and the oxygen of the adsorbed OH− species. The Fermi level is at 0 eV. The color code for different atoms is the same as in Fig. 1. 
We next placed an O2 molecule on the perovskite surface in Fig. 3c. The optimized structure is shown in Fig. 5a (top view) and 5b (side view). The adsorption energy of the O2 is −10.6 kcal mol−1. The distance between the Pb in the local PbO structure and the closer oxygen in the O2 is 2.98 Å, which is the Pb–O distance in the case for H2O adsorption in Fig. 4a. Therefore, there is no bond formation between the Pb and the O2. We also tried to force the formation of a Pb–O bond between the Pb in the local PbO structure and the additional oxygen. But the forced Pb–O bond broke after optimization. We again investigated the effects of the supercell size here. The structural and energetic results from the simulations with the vacuum lengths of 12 Å and of 16 Å are in close agreement. A summary of the results is included in Section SI1 of the ESI.†Fig. 5a and b also show the spin density of the optimized structure which mainly localizes at the O2 molecule. The spin density together with the equilibrium O–O bond distance of 1.26 Å indicates that the adsorbed species remains to be a molecular oxygen.

3.5 Introduction of another excess electron and the subsequent reactions
To further study the role of excess electrons in the degradation process, another electron was introduced to the H2O-adsorbed and the O2-adsorbed structures as shown in Fig. 4a and 5a, respectively. Fig. 6a and b show the relaxed H2O-adsorbed structure after the addition of the electron. Fig. 6c and d show the relaxed O2-adsorbed structure after the addition of the electron. For the former, the adsorption structure of the H2O is not affected by the excess electron. However, a hydrogen spontaneously transfers to the oxygen between the iodine and the Pb, followed by the cleavage of the O–I bond. The O–I distance increases from 2.03 Å in Fig. 4a to 2.55 Å. Fig. 6a and b also show the spin density. The unpaired electron is mainly trapped at the I and its neighboring O (marked as Ob in Fig. 3c), which induces the cleavage of the O–I bond.
 Fig. 6  (a) Top view and (b) side view of the relaxed structure and its spin density of the H2O adsorbed on the degraded surface after the introduction of an excess electron. (c) Top view and (d) side view of the relaxed structure and its spin density of the O2 adsorbed on the degraded surface after the introduction of an excess electron. The color code for different atoms is the same as in Fig. 1. The spin densities are shown as the yellow contour surfaces. 
Upon the additional of an electron to the O2-adsorbed structure shown in Fig. 5a, the O–O bond length of the dioxygen increases to 1.32 Å, suggesting that the molecular oxygen spontaneously abstracted the additional electron to form a superoxide. Moreover, a Pb–O bond between this superoxide and the Pb is formed (d(Pb–O) = 2.63 Å) as shown in Fig. 6c and d. The figures also show the spin density of the system which mainly localizes on the superoxide. Our results show that under humid air conditions, excess electrons would preferentially react with the oxygen molecules than with the H2O molecules. The excess electrons are important in oxygen-induced degradation of MAPbI3, which was also suggested experimentally.30
3.6 Summary of the pathway towards the formation of the local PbO structure and the changes of the charge states of different species
In this subsection, we summarize the pathway that we have identified for the formation of the local PbO structure. The maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) analysis63–65 was employed to obtain the Wannier centers (WCs). The charge states of different atoms were determined by counting the number of WCs assigned to them.68,69 The WCs at different steps along the pathway and the charge states are shown in Section SI3 of the ESI (Fig. SI3–SI7†). The charge states of some selected species are shown in Table 2.

The possible pathway can be summarized in five steps as follows: initially, a superoxide (O2−) is absorbed on the perovskite surface by forming a covalent bond with a top-layer Pb (Fig. 2b and SI3†). Secondly, the O2− absorbs an excess electron and simultaneously abstracts a proton from a nearby MA cation, forming a OOH− species through a proton-coupled electron transfer process. At the same time, the two O atoms form covalent bonds with the Pb in a side-on configuration (Fig. 3a and SI4†). The local PbI octahedral structure is degraded during this process. After that, the O–O bond of the OOH− dissociates with an energy barrier of +11.7 kcal mol−1. While the two Pb–O bonds stay intact, an O–I covalent bond is also formed. By analyzing the WCs, we found that two electrons transfer from this I− ion (I1) to the OOH−, forming I+, O2− and OH− ions (Fig. 3c and SI5†). Then, an oxygen molecule physisorbs on the surface with no changes in the charge states of any of the ions of the degraded surface (Fig. 5a and SI6†). Lastly, the O2 can readily absorb another excess electron, converting to O2− while the charge states of other ions remain the same. This resulting O2− spontaneously forms another Pb–O bond with the top-layer Pb (Fig. 6c and SI7†).
The formation of multiple Pb–O bonds between the oxygens and the surface Pb can be the precursor of the PbO degradation product. As shown in Table 2, the charge state analysis shows that the divalent lead ion (Pb2+) is not oxidized, for example, to the tetravalent lead ion (Pb4+) in the degradation process. Instead, a surface I− ion was oxidized to I+ by the oxygen in step 3 upon O–I bond formation. Therefore, replacing the iodine with other elements that have a larger electronegativity (such as Br, Cl and F) could be a strategy to improve the stability of perovskite materials.
4 Conclusions
Using density functional theory calculations, we studied the interaction between the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface and the molecular O2 in the presence of mobile excess electrons. Our results showed that, without the excess electrons, molecular O2 physisorbs on the MAPbI3 surface with no chemical reactions. On the other hand, superoxide and peroxide species generated by the reactions between O2 molecules and mobile excess electrons can be detrimental to the MAPbI3 surface stability. In particular, the O2− species forms a covalent Pb–O or H–O bond on the surface depending on the adsorption location. Subsequent reactions would involve the dissociation of the O–O bond to form a local PbO structure. However, the activation energy was found to be large. Introducing an additional electron to the surface converts the O2− to an O22− species. This significantly reduces the dissociation energy of the O–O bond. During these processes, most of the Pb–I bonds in the local octahedral structure are broken.
Additional H2O and O2 molecules were then introduced to the degraded surface. Again, the two molecules physisorb favorably on the MAPbI3 surface without any chemical reactions. Then, another electron is introduced to the MAPbI3 surface. Our results showed that the O2 abstracts this electron spontaneously to become a superoxide. It then forms a Pb–O bond with the Pb which is already bonded to two oxygens. However, the adsorbed H2O is unaffected by the introduction of the additional electron. Therefore, under humid air conditions, mobile excess electrons preferentially react with the oxygens and this accelerates the degradation process.
During the degradation reaction, three Pb–O covalent bonds are formed. This local PbO structure could be the precursor of the formation of PbO as one of the degradation products. The formation of this local PbO structure can be divided into five main steps. Analysis of the charge states using MLWF shows that an I− ion is oxidized to I+, upon the formation of an O–I bond in one of the degradation steps. This suggests that replacing the iodine with more electronegative elements (such as Br, Cl and F) could be a strategy to improve the stability of the perovskite materials. Overall, this work contributes to the microscopic understanding of the roles of excess electrons and oxygen in the degradation of the MAPbI3 materials. Such understanding is crucial for the design of more robust perovskite solar cell systems.
