Introduction
With the increasing demand for functional fibrous materials, where fibers not only have the basic characteristics, but also possess environmentally friendly functionalities such as self-cleaning, antimicrobial, and anti-pollution, self-cleaning coating technologies are developing rapidly at present, with a particular focus on self-cleaning fibrous materials.
Self-cleaning surfaces can be classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic. The former, also popularly known as the lotus effect, can be achieved by chemical or geometrical surface modification. The mechanism is that by mimicking the surface natural features of lotus leaves or butterfly wings, surface-attached dirt or fine debris can be removed through the action of rolling water droplets off their hydrophobic surface, hence the cleanliness of the material can be maintained.1,2 On the other hand, hydrophilic self-cleaning, also known as the photocatalytic effect, is a chemical surface modification that uses photoactive substances to induce catalytic purification functions on a substrate surface. These substances chemically decompose adsorbed dirt, contaminants, pollutants or microorganisms through photooxidation and photoreduction reactions in the presence of light.3,4 Moreover, hydrophilic self-cleaning materials not only induce self-cleaning functions, but also confer additional properties such as antimicrobial and deodorization.3,4 Owing to the significant potential of photocatalytic self-cleaning fibrous materials in the global commercial market, the self-cleaning surface functionalization of fibers has universally been receiving increasing attention.
Following recent reports on incorporating nanostructured photocatalysts into flexible substrates,5–11 several studies on the deposition of titanium dioxide particles on fibrous materials have been carried out using various application methods, such as hydrothermal treatment,5 sol–gel processing,5–7 impregnation,8 liquid phase deposition,9 chemical spacers10 or sputtering.11 Although thermally resistant solid materials such as glasses, tiles, silica, ceramics, and quartzes3,4,12 have been identified as suitable base substrates for exploring the potential application of titanium dioxide photocatalyst, the technologies of grafting titanium dioxide on flexible substrates, such as fabrics, plastics, textiles, and papers are limited due to their low chemical and thermal resistance against the post-deposition high-temperature treatment required to promote high crystallinity of the grafted catalyst.5–11,13–15 Moreover, the low surface energy of flexible substrates and their often irregular shapes pose one of the hardest challenges in achieving sufficient interfacial adhesion. Hence, the self-cleaning fibers concept continues to bring in opportunities for future research and development. In this review, current state-of-the-art photocatalytic self-cleaning surface functionalization technologies are reviewed, focusing on recent key developments of self-cleaning fibrous materials and their numerous potential applications. The limitations and future prospects of this research are also discussed.
Photocatalytic self-cleaning surface functionalization treatment
Historical background of photocatalysis
Photooxidation of an organic substance, chlorazol sky blue, through photosensitization of titanium dioxide at λ = 365 nm was first reported by Goodeve and Kitchener in 1938.16 Later on, Kato and Mashio,17 and Filimonov18 extended the study to tetralin and 2-propanol using titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in 1964.17,18 Shortly thereafter, a breakthrough was brought in by Honda and Fujishima who,19 inspired by photosynthesis in plants, investigated photoelectrolysis of water (water splitting) with light energy. They discovered that water can be decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen through photoelectrochemical reaction in the presence of ultraviolet-visible light using rutile titanium dioxide as the anode and platinum as the counter electrode in aqueous electrolyte solutions.3,4,19 In 1972, the conception of solar-activated electrochemical photolysis of ware demonstrated that titanium dioxide semiconductor could be used as an environmental friendly photocatalyst for solar-assisted energy conversion.19
Influenced by Frank and Bard, who were the first to investigate the decomposition of toxic cyanide in water by photocatalysis with titanium dioxide in 1977,20 the detoxication of organic pollutants using titanium dioxide powder without platinization, by way of a photocatalytic process under ambient condition, has attracted worldwide attention. In the middle of 1980s, the fanaticism of using titanium dioxide electrode as a tool for hydrogen production was shifted due to a number of challenges, such as instability, low efficiency and lack of reproducibility.3 Simultaneously, scientific studies on titanium dioxide as a multi-functional photocatalyst had started. Later on, research on photocatalysis focusing on pollutant removal blossomed particularly in the treatment of wastewater and polluted air. Nevertheless, titanium dioxide photocatalysis was not commercially attractive due to the low quantum efficiency caused by immature synthesis technologies and thus almost none of these developments had been commercialized.3,4
Since the discovery of photocatalysis, scientists mostly focused on exploring the potential of titanium dioxide in environmental applications, while the feasibility and compatibility between titanium dioxide, photocatalytic technologies and substrate substances had been overlooked. Until 1990s, there was an increasing interest in the concept of photo-induced self-purification materials through the incorporation of photocatalysts in various substrates in order to introduce a function of disinfection, primarily for water and air treatments.21,22 Knowing its potential in maintaining cleanliness of a surface, the utilization of titanium dioxide coating as self-cleaning surface was explored. The first photocatalytic self-cleaning ceramic was realized by Fujishima et al.23 and Heller24 concurrently in early 1990s. Many researchers and investors conceived similar ideas to explore a number of self-cleaning products, such as self-cleaning lamp covers, self-cleaning glasses, self-cleaning window blinds, self-cleaning tents, etc.4 With more photocatalytic-products available, new application areas have been exploited. In 1995, Fujishima research group, in collaboration with TOTO Ltd., Japan, accidentally discovered that titanium dioxide possesses a high photo-induced hydrophilicity after light irradiation, which widened the application of the photocatalyst as surface coating.3,25 Ever since, industrial products using photocatalytic surface functionalization treatment are marked as hydrophilic self-cleaning coating. Three years later, the photocatalytic antimicrobial property of titanium dioxide-coated materials was ascertained, in which Escherichia coli (E. coli) could be completely decomposed by titanium dioxide under UV irradiation.26
In the twenty-first century, advanced photocatalytic technologies have been continuously pursued. However, the application has greatly been limited due to the high temperature required in the application process.13,14 Until 2004, with the aid of an advanced bottom up nanotechnology approach and the sol–gel process, Daoud and Xin first fabricated self-cleaning cotton through in situ nucleation and growth of anatase titanium dioxide at low temperature and ambient pressure.27 Since then, numerous photocatalytic self-cleaning surface functionalization processes have been proposed for low thermally resistant materials.6–11 Photocatalyst-substrate adhesion, coating homogeneity and photocatalytic efficiency are greatly dependent on the base substrates. With further improvement of the photocatalytic self-cleaning coating techniques,5–11,27 the application of homogenous titanium dioxide coating in different types of materials with reproducible photoactivity has become possible. On the other hand, many endeavors have been devoted to improve the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide.28–30 Methods such as dye/surface sensitization, selective ion doping, composite semiconductor coupling, surface chelation and derivatization have been widely explored,29–32 particularly in (1) extending the effective absorption range of titanium dioxide from ultraviolet to visible-light region; (2) suppressing the recombination of the generated electron–hole pairs through enhancing the charge separation; and (3) modifying the quantum efficiency of the heterogeneous photosensitive catalysts.31,32 To date, attempts are still being dedicated to produce stable visible-light photocatalysts with efficient photochemical reactions in diverse applications.
Mechanisms of photocatalysis
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a photo-assisted catalytic process utilizing a substance that converts light energy into catalytic work through chemical reactions. The photocatalyst acts as a photosensitive substance which possesses a strong oxidation effect with the aid of light energy. The basic mechanism of photocatalysis is contributed by the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the photocatalyst on absorption of light, provided that the energy absorbed from the light source is equal to or greater than the band gap energy (i.e.hv > ΔE) of the photocatalyst.3,4,33
As shown in Fig. 1, under normal conditions and without photonic excitation, the photocatalyst is at the ground state where electrons are localized in the valence band. However, upon photo-excitation, electrons get sufficient energy to overcome the band gap barrier and move to the conduction band. Activated photocatalysts generate electron–hole pairs in the presence of a light source, where highly active electrons (e−) form in the conduction band and positive holes (h+) in the valence band. The formed photogenerated electron–hole pairs can react in three possible pathways as illustrated in Fig. 2. (1) Electron–hole pairs rapidly recombine on the surface or in the bulk of the photocatalyst (recombination); (2) electrons diffuse to the surface of the photocatalyst and react with adsorbed oxygen molecules producing reactive oxygen radicals (−O, −O2, −O3) (photoreduction); and (3) holes oxidize water molecules or adsorbed hydroxide ions forming highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals (−OH) (photooxidation). The radicals generated from the reaction of electron–hole pairs contribute to the powerful photo-electrochemical reactions that are capable of decomposing attached dirt, harmful microorganisms and organic contaminants into carbon dioxide and water without the application of an external voltage at ambient temperature according to the following equations.3,4,19,33 TiO2 + hν → e− + h+(1) e− + h+ → TiO2(2) e− + O2 → O2−(3) O−2 + H+ → HO2˙(4) h+ + H2O → ˙OH + H+(5) h+ + O−2 → 2˙O(6)

Titanium dioxide photocatalyst
Materials, which are able to catalyze reactions with the involvement of light illumination, are known as photocatalysts. There are many photosensitive substances such as SrTiO3, SnO2, ZrO2, ZnO, ZnS, CdSe, CdTe, WO3 and Fe2O3 with small band gap or good light absorption which may work well as photocatalyst. However, studies showed that titanium dioxide has several advantages over all others.34 Not only because it has strong oxidizing ability but also because it is highly stable due to the inactivity of electrons in the absence of illumination. From an economic point of view, titanium is the fourth abundant elements in earth, thus, titanium dioxide possesses potential because of its availability and inexpensiveness. Besides, the range of applications, such as cosmetics, paint and even food additives, gives evidence that titanium dioxide is innoxious. On top of that, titanium dioxide is superhydrophilic and forms a sheet-like layer of moisture upon light exposure and presence of water, which can act as a transparent protector against dirt.34–37 Thus, titanium dioxide photocatalyst can be utilized in applications such as self-cleaning, anti-fogging, antimicrobial, deodorization, and wastewater remediation.
Titanium dioxide photocatalyst, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is found in three common crystalline forms, namely anatase, rutile, and brookite. Amongst the several polymorphs of titanium dioxide, anatase has proved to be the most photocatalytically active.38 Besides, it has been shown that the decrease in the diameter of titanium dioxide particles increases the photocatalytic activity due to a larger surface area per unit mass and volume.39 In the commercial sector, Degussa P-25 (P-25), composed of 70% anatase and 30% rutile, is a benchmark titanium dioxide catalyst due to its advanced photocatalytic ability. However, the application of P-25 is hindered due to its limited dissolution property. Intensive efforts have been incessantly dedicated in exploiting other titanium dioxide synthesis approaches to surpass P-25. Titanium dioxide, in form of powder, solution, gel, and paint material, can be synthetically obtained by a number of methods such as sol–gel process, chemical vapor deposition, impregnation, anodic oxidation and sputtering in present industries.35,36,40–42 Owing to the above-mentioned properties and virtues, titanium dioxide has been the most commonly used photocatalyst in self-cleaning coatings.
Recent developments of photocatalytic self-cleaning surface functionalization of fibrous materials
Definition of photocatalytic self-cleaning fibers
Photocatalytic self-cleaning fibers are fibrous materials formed by imparting photocatalytic function through surface functionalization treatment, wherein the fibers are able to clean themselves when exposed to light. The mechanism of the self-cleaning action of fibers is shown in Fig. 3. Photocatalytic self-cleaning fibers do not only possess self-cleaning property, but also antimicrobial, deodorizing and UV blocking functions.
 Fig. 3  Mechanism of self-cleaning action of fibrous materials. 
Self-cleaning cellulosic fibers
The concept of self-cleaning fibers was firstly introduced by Daoud and Xin27 who successfully developed self-cleaning cotton by applying anatase titanium dioxide nano-colloid to cotton fibers using the conventional dip-pad-cure process (Fig. 4). The ethanol-based nanocrystalline anatase colloid was nucleated from titanium tetraisopropoxide through a facile sol–gel process.27,28,43 The principal reactions are shown below: Ti(OPr)4 + 4EtOH → Ti(OEt)4 + 4PrOH(7) Ti(OPr)4 + H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 4PrOH(8) Ti(OEt)4 + H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 4EtOH(9) Ti(OH)4→TiO2 + 2H2O(10)
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of dip-pad-cure surface coating. 
Cotton fibers were dipped in the as-prepared titanium dioxide nano-colloid and then pressed at a pressure of 2.75 kg cm−2 at a roller rotation speed of 7.5 rpm. The pressed samples were dried for 10 min in a preheated oven at 80 °C followed by curing at ∼100 °C for 5 min. The anatase crystalline form was then induced by hydrothermally treating the fibers in a boiling water bath for 3 h.27,44 The identification of the anatase characteristics on cotton surface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) verified the success of anatase titanium dioxide deposition on cellulosic materials with a strong anatase-cotton adhesion.27,28,43 The phase and size of crystallites are two major factors affecting the photoactivity and optoelectronic properties of titanium dioxide. By increasing the temperature and reaction time of the synthetic process to 60 °C and 16 h, respectively, nanocrystalline single-phase anatase particles with a diameter of 5 nm were produced leading to a substantial improvement in the photoactivity.5,7 Using this approach, anatase could be grown on cellulose substrates without the need for the post-hydrothermal treatment.5,7 It was demonstrated that anatase-coated cotton has the ability to decompose organic contaminants, dirt and microorganisms when exposed to UV irradiation.5,7,27,43,44Fig. 5 shows an example of the antimicrobial property of self-cleaning cotton in decomposing staphylococcus aureus.

In addition, the photo-stability and UV protection of cotton were significantly improved after coating due to the ability of titanium dioxide to absorb ultraviolet light.7 Dong et al. also tried to grow titanium dioxide nanoparticles on cotton fabrics for decomposition of gaseous airborne pollutant using polyglycol-based P-25 dispersion.8 The authors reported that the dosage of titanium dioxide dispersion affected the efficiency of ammonia decomposition, where dyed cotton displayed similar results as undyed cotton.8 Over the past 5 years, various sol–gel synthesis conditions, such as temperature, reaction time, precursors and stabilizers, were adopted and modified to prepare titanium dioxide colloids for the formation of photocatalytic cellulose fibers.45–53 The synthesis conditions of these methods are summarized in Table 1.

On the other hand, Zhang et al. successfully coated anatase on the cotton surface via microwave-assisted liquid phase deposition with hexafluorotitanate ammonium ((NH4)2TiF6) as a precursor,9 where highly crystalline anatase was clearly evident on the cotton surface.9 The liquid phase deposition method received attention because of its simplicity in forming titanium dioxide on various substrates with a large surface area at low temperature which makes it also suitable for thermally sensitive substrates. The authors depicted that high photocatalytic activity and stable self-cleaning performance were achieved as evidenced by degradation of methylene blue within 3 h. Meanwhile, Kiwi et al. investigated the possibility of producing self-cleaning cellulosic fibers by loading P-25 on cotton surface using non-toxic chemical spacers.10 The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 6. The surface of cotton fibers was activated by immersion in different spacer solutions including succinic acid, 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid for 1 h. The dried fibers were immersed into P-25 sonicated suspension at 75 °C for 1 h, followed by 1 h drying at 100 °C.10 The study demonstrated that, while no degradation of the fiber surface was observed, the titanium dioxide-spacer-cotton was able to mineralize a variety of stains, including red wine, concentrated coffee, make-up solution and simulated human perspiration (a mixture of L-histidine-chloride, sodium chloride and sodium phosphate), through the photo-generated reactive species during the photocatalysis process.10 In general, the use of spacer showed success in incorporating titanium dioxide with cellulose materials; however, optimization of binding condition, such as spacer concentration and multilayer loading, was needed to achieve sufficient photocatalytic performance.
 Fig. 6  Schematic diagram of application of chemical spacers. 
In other contributions, Kiwi et al. incorporated the dip-coating method with different pre-treatment processes to produce highly functional self-cleaning cotton textiles.48–50 With the aid of radio frequency (RF) plasma (vacuum/atmospheric), microwave (MV) plasma or vacuum/atmospheric UV irradiation surface activation pre-treatments, negatively charged functional groups (e.g. carboxylic, percarboxylic, epoxide and peroxide groups) could be introduced to the cotton surface through the formation or interaction of active/excited oxygen species (anion-radical O−, atomic O, singlet 1O2, cation-radical O+) to anchor titanium dioxide.45 The surface of bleached and mercerized cotton samples was activated differently depending on the type of systems used. Generally, the plasma approach (RF- and WV-plasma) introduces active oxygen species or ionized gas (atomic oxygen, positive or negative oxygen ions, excited oxygen radicals) on fiber surfaces forming chelating groups for titanium dioxide binding, while the UV irradiation approach (vacuum and atmospheric) excites the upper layer of the cellulose fibers using only atomic oxygen and excited oxygen species through UV light.48,50 After the surface activation pre-treatment, cotton fibers were able to bind in titanium dioxide in both forms, powder suspension and colloidal solution. Comparing to the chemical spacer technique,10 UV pre-treated cotton demonstrated two-fold improvement in decomposing red wine and coffee stains, signifying the prospective of using such technique in improving the adhesion of titanium dioxide to cotton.48 A more uniform titanium dioxide coating was obtained on UV pre-treated cotton than RF- and MV-plasma.48,50 When compared to high-temperature heat treatment or chemical/solvent-based surface modification, RF- and MV-plasma and UV irradiation pre-treatments are environmentally friendly techniques, wherein the short treatment time and the absence of solvents reduce the energy and chemical consumption. However, the drawback of these systems is the requirement of immediate loading of titanium dioxide after pre-treatment due to the short life-time of the surface-generated reactive species.
Doping titanium dioxide with other metals or metal oxides, such as Au/TiO2, SiO2/TiO2, is considered a potential strategy in making titanium dioxide on cellulose strongly photoactive with good reproducibility.51–53 Few researchers proclaimed the use of SiO2/TiO2 colloid coating in boosting the photocatalytic efficiency and its stability.51,52 There is a general agreement that SiO2/TiO2-coated cotton materials possess high photocatalytic performance and outperformed pure titanium dioxide coating, while maintaining cotton's intrinsic property.
Although most of the research on self-cleaning cellulose was conducted on cotton, other cellulosic materials, such as wood, paper and bamboo fibers, have also been investigated.15,54–57 For instance, self-cleaning paper handsheets (wood cellulose fibers) were produced by Marques et al.54 Wood fibers (Eucalyptus globulus), composed of 85% cellulose and 15% glucuronoxylan, were mixed with titanyl oxysulfate (TiOSO4)/sulfuric acid solution at 100 °C for 7 h using the controlled hydrolysis process. Titanium dioxide/cellulose composite fibers were formed after drying at 50 °C for 24 h. The handsheets were prepared by vacuum filtration and hot press according to ISO 5269/1.54 Although titanium dioxide was well retained in the cellulose fibers, the fibers exhibited photodegradation as demonstrated by the photo-yellowing effect after light exposure.54 Lately, the same research group reported an approach to overcome this limitation. Using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS) or trialkoxysilanes (OTMS) as a binder to form TiO2/SiO2/cellulose nanocomposites can reduce the direct contact between titanium dioxide and wood fibers, resulting in protection of the fibers with improved photo-stability.56 However, the complex procedures involved may not be practically favored.
Self-cleaning protein fibers
Although intensive research has been conducted on cellulosic fibrous materials for exploring the potential application of titanium dioxide photocatalyst, little work has been reported on protein fibrous materials. The exploitation and development of such fibers had largely been hampered due to their limited chemical, thermal and photo-stability.6,49,58–65 In 2005, Kiwi and co-workers attempted to bind titanium dioxide with wool-polyamide blended fabrics.6,49 As opposed to cellulose, the surface chemical structure of keratin fibers is irregular and the anchoring surface functional groups for titanium dioxide binding such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups are less than 50% leading to ineffective photocatalytic property. After introducing a variable density of negatively charged functional groups (–COO−, –O–O−) using RF-plasma, MV-plasma or vacuum UV irradiation activation, the titanium dioxide particles could be attached on the modified wool-polyamide surface through electrostatic interaction with positively charged Ti4+.6,49 The modified wool-polyamide surface could work well with different titanium dioxide colloidal solutions. The experimental conditions of this method are summarized in Table 2. The research demonstrated that titanium dioxide loaded wool-polyamide blend possessed photocatalytic self-cleaning ability in decomposing dust, concentrated coffee and red wine stains with fair reproducibility after dry-cleaning.6,49 Although the self-cleaning wool-polyamide exhibited sound photocatalytic ability, plasma and UV irradiation-induced surface activation pre-treatment is expensive and difficult to implement at a large scale.

Later on, Daoud et al. explored the possibility of extending the application of self-cleaning surface functionalization treatment to pure protein keratin-type wool fibers using a modified titanium dioxide colloid and a wet surface modification approach.7,58 The sol–gel formulation was prepared by hydrolysis and condensation reactions of titanium tetraisopropoxide in acidic aqueous solution containing ethanol, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid. Acylation of wool fibers with acid anhydride was introduced to enrich the fibers surface with carboxyl groups, which enhanced the anatase coating and thus the self-cleaning functionality.58 In this approach, the wool fibers were subjected to succinic anhydride solution in DMF at 65 °C for 2 h for the succinylation reaction. The reactivity of the backbone chains of wool fibers was enhanced through the introduction of additional carboxylic groups to keratin's reactive sites such as carboxylic, hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups.58 The deposition of titanium dioxide on wool fiber increased by two-fold as quantitatively evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In later research, ethanol was replaced by water as a medium toward a more friendly process environmentally and industrially.59 Meanwhile, Hurren et al. investigated the photocatalytic reactivity of titanium dioxide-coated wool fabrics particularly in decomposing red wine stains.60 A titanium dioxide colloid was synthesized using titanium butoxide (Ti(OC3H9)4) in acidic aqueous medium containing hydrochloric acid and ethanol under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen for 2 h. Wool fabrics were dipped in the prepared solution for 30 s, followed by drying at 120 °C for 1 min and curing at 60 °C for 16 h. Hurren et al. revealed that while the UV absorption of titanium dioxide-coated wool was in positively proportional with red wine degradation, the titanium dioxide particle size on coated wool was inversely proportional to red wine degradation.
More recently, further research was conducted by Daoud and co-workers, in which the synthesis condition of anatase colloid was modified in terms of acid stabilizers, synthesis time, photocatalyst concentration, and curing conditions, in order to optimize the photocatalytic efficiency of self-cleaning keratins.59,61,62 Single-phase nanocrystalline anatase was successfully nucleated at 60 °C within only 2 h of synthesis time.61–64 Besides, the self-cleaning formulation preparation process was more compatible with industrial conditions. It was found that anatase-coated wool fibers possessed good UV protection property and reproducible photocatalytic ability without the need for surface activation pre-treatment.59,61,62 On top of this, the same research group explicated that the deterioration of the intrinsic physical and mechanical properties of wool fibers after the titanium dioxide coating treatment could be substantially recovered with minimal adverse effect on the photocatalytic self-cleaning performance using a simple post-treatment with silicone.64 Self-cleaning keratins are currently in the stage of further development and optimization for potential commercialization.
Self-cleaning synthetic fibers
The application of photocatalytic substances in pure synthetic fibers, synthetic fiber blends, and other fibrous polymers has also been investigated. In 2005, Kiwi et al. prepared rutile titanium dioxide colloid using the sol–gel process and a hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 16 h. They developed self-cleaning polyester using different pre-treatments, such as RF-plasma, MW-plasma and vacuum-UV, to activate the fiber surface and enhance the photocatalytic performance under visible light.6,49 Titanium dioxide has poor compatibility with synthetic fibers, such as polyester and polyamide, due to the lack of anchoring functional groups. Following a similar approach, Qi et al. activated the polyester surface using a low temperature plasma treatment in an attempt to enhance the chemical bonding between titanium dioxide and polyester fibers.65 Other potential self-cleaning fibrous materials had also been proposed by different research groups.12,66–68 Yu et al. developed self-cleaning glass fiber with stable photocatalytic activity and low deactivation rate by a liquid phase deposition method, in which glass fibers were immersed in TiF4 and H3BO3 mixture at 60 °C for 12 h followed by calcination at 300 °C for 2 h.12 In this method, anatase titanium dioxide with a particle size of 20–70 nm could be uniformly and dispersedly deposited on glass fiber surfaces.12 Concurrently, Jia et al. successfully loaded commercially available P-25 on activated carbon fibers (ACF) by a dip coating treatment followed by calcination at 300 °C for 2 h under ambient pressure.66 Later on, a new soft process method using microwave irradiation was used for depositing titanium dioxide on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers at low temperature. Tetrabutyl orthotitanate was hydrolyzed with tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide forming titanium dioxide colloid, followed by 2 h refluxing for crystallization. The work concluded that the titanium dioxide-coated PVA not only possessed high photocatalytic ability in decomposing methylene blue, but also demonstrated good antimicrobial effect in sterilizing both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) under UV irradiation.67
On the other hand, new approaches toward self-cleaning fibrous materials were suggested. Instead of coating titanium dioxide particles on the substrates' surface, fibers were incorporated with titanium dioxide forming titanium dioxide-fiber composites.69–71 Wei et al. developed titanium dioxide–polypropylene nanocomposite fibers, wherein P-25 nanoparticles were mixed with polypropylene granules powder through tumbler mixer for 30 min, followed by extrusion from pilot-plant scale melt-extrusion equipment through melt-compounding under heat treatment at 230 °C.69 The nanocomposite fibers were found to contain titanium dioxide but the titanium dioxide coverage on polypropylene fiber surface was poor due to the extensive aggregation of titanium dioxide particles. Moreover, the photoactivity of such fibers could not be established as the work lacked quantification of the photocatalytic activity.69 Alternatively, a two-steps synthesis was employed by Zhang et al. in producing titanium dioxide fibers according to Fig. 7.70 More recently, Im et al. attempted to integrate co-doping in titanium dioxide nanocomposite fibers for improving the photodegradation properties under solar light. Carbon, nitrogen, boron and fluorine were co-doped with anatase titanium dioxide and electrospun with PVA forming visible-light active hydrogel fibers.71 However, compared to the surface coating approach, production of titanium dioxide nanocomposite fibers appears rather complex and needs further investigation.

Due to the concurrent significant impetus for further research and development in this area, it is expected that these efforts may lead to a wide range of applications to include more flexible organic materials in the foreseeable future.
Functions of photocatalytic self-cleaning fibers and application thereof
Self-cleaning daily apparels

Anti-fouling, anti-odor and anti-mold. 
Fibrous materials’ structures get dirty and smelly easily, therefore frequent washing is necessary for maintaining cleanness. Researchers reported that the titanium dioxide-coated surface has an excellent soil resistance and deodorizing properties due to its strong oxidation reaction,3,4 which is capable of removing unpleasant smell such as perspiration, shoe odor, vehicle smoke, cigarette smoke, and organic stains, such as coffee, red wine and oil, that cannot be effectively cleaned by laundry or dry-cleaning.3,4,6,7,37 Moreover, fibers such as wool and silk are more liable to attack by microorganisms. Titanium dioxide can decompose the mold spores adhered on the fiber surface using similar mechanism as anti-fouling and deodorizing.3,4,37 Therefore, fibrous materials with titanium dioxide surface coating can act as a protective layer to prevent the growth of mold spores on fibers. On the other hand, delicate clothing, such as chiffon and satin, easily suffers from distortion, dimension change and pilling effect through the washing process, which affect their appearance, properties and general functions. Since the self-cleaning function is triggered by simply exposure to light, washing-induced damage or dimension distortion of clothing can be avoided due to the reduction of wash cycle, contributing to the extension of the life-time of such materials.


Resources saving and cost effectiveness. 
Self-cleaning fibrous materials can be viewed as one of the solutions to concurrent energy and resources crisis. Because clothing or apparels equipped with auto-cleaning property not only offer the aesthetic advantage by maintaining its cleanliness, but also appreciably cut the cost of cleaning and maintenance through reducing the use of chemical detergents and frequency of recurring washing. Moreover, time and power consumption required for the laundry process can also be economized. Self-cleaning fibrous materials provide economic and environmental benefits to our society.

Protective clothing

UV protection. 
Ultraviolet radiation is divided into three categories according to its wavelength: UV-A (400–320 nm), UV-B (320–280 nm), and UV-C (280–100 nm). Owing to air pollution, the depletion of ozone layer allowed harmful UV radiation to pass through the Earth's atmosphere and cause a significant increase in the UV intensity in the atmosphere. Overdose of UV radiation can result in chronic reactions and skin damages such as sunburn, acceleration of premature skin ageing, promotion of photo-dermatosis, genetic (i.e. DNA) damage, and skin cancer.72 Therefore, in the prevention of life threatening skin cancers, efforts are being dedicated to produce sun protective clothing in order to enhance the skin protection against excessive biologically harmful UV radiation, primarily UV-B due to its high skin damage potential.72
Fibrous materials, such as polyester, wool and silk, naturally absorb UV rays due to the presence of aromatic groups in their structure; however, fibers like cotton and polyamide are permeable to the UV radiation.73 Regardless of the fiber type, the change of fabric weight, color, structure, porosity and elasticity are also factors that can undermine the UV absorption or scattering efficiency of fibrous materials. Titanium dioxide-coated self-cleaning fibers can be a good alternative to maintain the UV protection efficiency. As a non-toxic inorganic UV absorber, titanium dioxide is favorable for UV protection due to its chemical and thermal stability.74 Forming a thin transparent layer of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide on the fabric surface can provide excellent UV blocking effect and enhance the skin protection of clothing against harmful UV light, particularly for infant/children wear, summer clothing, and apparels for outdoor occupations. These UV-shielding fibrous materials can also be used in external structural applications such as awnings, sunshades, blinds and related applications.


Medical protection. 
Surgical operation has to be carried out under sterile condition to avoid the chances of infection. Medical fabrics, such as operation gown, hospital patient gown, surgical gloves, mask, surgical cap, must be free from germs. With a titanium dioxide coating, the cleanliness of these fibrous materials can be maintained due to their anti-bacterial property suppressing the growth of the bacteria on the substrates' surface. The chances of infection can be substantially reduced due to the reduction of viable bacteria, germs or virus during surgery.
Cancer is the first disease causing large population of human death. Fujishima et al. applied photocatalyst particles to control the growth of cancer T24.75 In animal experiments and testing, photocatalysis can effectively reduce the affected area through inserting a photocatalyst into the infected cancer area with a UV-optic cable triggering the reactivity.75 It is anticipated that the application can be extended to medical healing fabrics. Instead of using titanium dioxide nanoparticles, photocatalytic medical healing fabrics can be placed in the infected areas for controlling the growth of cancer cells. Thus, the possibility of individual nanoparticles penetrating into the blood stream and damaging human tissue can be avoided.

Household appliances and interior furnishing materials

Antimicrobial and dustproof. 
The photocatalytic self-cleaning surface has now emerged in household products such as kitchen cloths, bath towels, furniture. Traditionally, chemical agents such as bleaching agent and alcohols are used for cleaning and disinfection purposes. However, inhalation of or contact with those chemicals could be harmful to human body. Besides, these agents only provide a short-term effect leading to the need of persistent application. Alternatively, self-cleaning fibrous materials can achieve long-term dustproof and anti-bacterial functions. With the use of low intensity light irradiation, nano-sized titanium dioxide-coated self-cleaning fibers can oxidize surface-adsorbed organic contaminant, and provide effective protection against dust, bacteria and disease-causing microorganisms.4
On the other hand in existing antimicrobial products, the antimicrobial agents leach from the surface to kill microorganism on contact. If this type of antimicrobial agents is applied to fabrics that are in contact with skin, the agents may cross the skin barrier causing allergic reactions and rashes, or even kill useful organisms.72 Furthermore, since these agents are mobile, microorganisms have the opportunity to adapt and become resistant rendering them ineffective. However, titanium dioxide-based coating would not leach from the surface; the generated active radicals only decompose the microorganisms that come in contact with the surface of titanium dioxide. Moreover, self-cleaning fibers cause no harmful effect to the dermis layer since the outermost layer (stratum corneum) of human skin can protect it from absorbing the active oxidizing substances produced from titanium dioxide.76 Since the self-cleaning surface is immobilized, most of the limitations of the leaching-type antimicrobial agents can be overcome.72 A hygienic living environment is a promise for a healthier and more sustainable life, particularly for children and the elderly.


Air purification facilities. 
Air pollution, whether outdoor or indoor, is always a serious problem, which is directly affecting the living quality of all living organisms. Outdoor air pollution is due to the emission of air pollutants, for instance, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and ozone (O3) from motors, power plants, and industries into the atmosphere, while indoor air pollution mainly comes from odor or toxic gases from daily life activity, such as the release of formaldehyde from renovation/construction or nitric monoxide from cigarette smoke.
Air filters are air purifying devices, which mainly apply to building ventilation systems (smokestack, air conditioner, and stovepipe) and engines (motors). Incorporating titanium dioxide into cotton or pleated paper air filters can purify air from airborne organic contaminant. Installation of self-cleaning air filters at the opening of smokestacks and engines can eliminate the emission of harmful gases to the atmosphere; while air purifier and air conditioner with self-cleaning air filters can maintain the indoor air quality reducing the occurrence of air-induced allergies such as sick building syndrome (SBS) or nasal allergy.

Limitations
Environmental concerns
Although nano-sized titanium dioxide offers numerous benefits, there is also potential for adverse consequences related to public health and environment. In view of the increasing demand on photocatalytic self-cleaning fibrous products, health and environmental concerns in the production and use of nano-structured titanium dioxide surface coating have been raised. Due to the lack of comprehensive studies on the potential risks of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide-coated fibrous materials, many scientists worried about the possible effects on human and the environment. One of the concerns is the risk of exposure during manufacture and application. The generation of waste chemical residues or wastewater during the production of self-cleaning fibrous materials or possible leaching/peeling off of titanium dioxide nanoparticles from the fiber surface during washing could lead to contamination of wastewater streams. On the other hand, exposure risks during the end of life disposal would also be of concern. In the event that such materials become widely used, improper disposal of nanomaterials could lead to a large amount of nano-sized titanium dioxide entering the soil. Tomson investigated the possibility of the transfer of nanoparticles to natural environment, and found that nanoparticles can travel through and store into soil.77 Earthworms can absorb nanoparticles from the contaminated soil and move up to the food chain. The research displayed a high possibility that nanoparticles would accumulate in the oceans, soil, plants and living organisms, and ultimately affecting the whole planet. Yet, little is known about the impacts of nanomaterials on the environment, and the potential risks of releasing nanoparticles into the environment might be underestimated.
Potential risk and human safety concerns
The lethal dose (LD50) represents the short-term poisoning potential (acute toxicity) of a substance, measured by the amount of a given substance, given all at once that causes the death of 50% of a group of test animals. Toxicologists reported that the LD50 value of titanium dioxide for rat is above 12 g kg−1 after oral administration.78 Epidemiologists also reported that no carcinogenic effect and nonmalignant respiratory disease for human were observed.79 The studies demonstrated neither significant absorption nor organ storage due to the ingestion of titanium dioxide, suggesting that titanium dioxide has low toxicity.78,79 Therefore, scientists in general, assume the use of titanium dioxide is safe. However, titanium dioxide at the nano-scale behaves differently when compared to its bulk counterpart. It is proven that particles at the nano-scale are toxic to mice lung, indicating the potential to cause similar allergies to human body.80 It is of concern if individual titanium dioxide nanoparticles that may peel off a fiber coating could then be inhaled or penetrated through human skin to blood stream. The titanium dioxide nanoparticles might accumulate in the body causing toxic effects such as allergy or inflammation to lungs or other organs. Although some researchers claimed that titanium dioxide nanoparticles are permanently bonded to the fibrous materials,7,10,59,65 there is no testing standard for proving the safety exposure level regarding the release of titanium dioxide nanoparticles from such coatings. This should also be addressed in the further research of photocatalytic self-cleaning fibrous materials.
Photocatalytic efficiency and stability
Factors such as substrate selection, dispersion technique and light source affect the photocatalytic self-cleaning property and its stability. For some fibers, the attachment of titanium dioxide on the fiber surface is weak because of the insignificant amount and random distribution of anchoring functional groups on the fiber surface. Inadequate and uneven photocatalytically active sites may undermine the efficiency and reproducibility. Although calcination and high temperature curing are common post-treatment techniques for improving the crystallization and bondability of titanium dioxide, these methods are not suitable for low thermally resistant fibrous materials. Low-temperature surface coating techniques have to be used when producing self-cleaning fibers, which brings about difficulty in acquiring stable photoactivity. Therefore, advanced synthesis and dispersion technologies have to be devised in order to acquire highly crystalline titanium dioxide to endure maximum photocatalytic effect and offset the constraints.
Photocatalytic efficiency depends on the branching of the reactive electron/hole pairs into interfacial charge-transfer reactions. Considering the structure of titanium dioxide, the large photonic band gap (3.2 eV in anatase form) limits the photoactivity to a specific excitation source within the UV range.3,4 Moreover, the recombination of the generated electron–hole pairs by a rapid charge-transfer process and low interfacial charge-transfer rates decelerate the redox reaction.3,4 Another limitation of these fibers stems from their passive approach. Although the photogenerated radicals on the titanium dioxide-coated surface may be able to diffuse as far as 20 µm from their microdomins,81 titanium dioxide does not take the initiative to capture all types of contaminants. Since organic contaminants or microorganisms must be adsorbed or come in contact with the self-cleaning surface microzones in order to trigger the decomposition process, this may hinder the photocatalytic efficiency.
Several research groups provided evidence that the photocatalytic efficiency of self-cleaning fibrous materials decreased with repetitive washing or cycling application.6,12,43–45,47 This could be attributed to weak titanium dioxide-fibers bonding,28,43–46 and/or reduction of active sites of titanium dioxide.12 Photocatalytic stability is determined by the amount of active titanium dioxide particles remaining on the fiber surface over time. The lack of anchoring groups for titanium dioxide can result a temporary physical bonding rather than permanent chemical bonding,45,46 leading to short-term photocatalytic stability. In addition, the photogenerated oxidation and reduction sites on titanium dioxide surface may be occupied by the contaminants or byproduct generated during the photocatalysis process,12 causing deactivation of photocatalytic active sites and affecting the stability of the self-cleaning function. Although researchers proclaimed that the deceleration of photocatalysis was within an acceptable range,6,12,28,43–45,47,66 no standard measurement is available for verification. Another concern is that the photocatalytic efficiency and stability of self-cleaning fibrous materials are mainly evaluated by contaminants removal and antimicrobial tests,5–11,13–15,27–32,43–71 which are usually carried out under short-term exposure conditions (<100 h). Such exposure duration may not be long enough for self-cleaning fibers to demonstrate their real stability. It should also be considered to have long-term stability analyses according to the target application.
Future prospects
Visible light-driven photocatalysts
Although numerous research studies have been conducted to maximize the photocatalytic performance, many factors that significantly influence the efficiency of photocatalysts, are yet to receive comprehensive investigation. One of the vital concerns is the limitation of the light absorbability. Current photocatalysts inherently require ultraviolet light irradiation to trigger the advanced oxidation effect. Therefore, the effectiveness of the photocatalytic activity is highly dependent on the UV intensity of incident light. However, the fear of overexposure to health-damaging ultraviolet light is a major concern. Moreover, ultraviolet light constitutes only 0.1% of indoor lighting, which may substantially limit the efficiency of the photocatalytic self-cleaning effect in indoor applications. Therefore, it is essential to widen the effective absorption wavelength range of the photocatalyst to include other regions such as visible light or even infrared for improving the usability of the photocatalysts.
Remote photocatalytic effect
The possibility of remote photodegradation by titanium dioxide was raised by Haick and Paz,81 who suggested that the photogenerated oxidizing active species (e.g. hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide) could diffuse from the surface of irradiated titanium dioxide to mineralize distant contaminants at very short times.81 Although this finding contradicts the general belief of Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics82 that hydroxyl radicals are immobile and the adsorption of contaminant on the surface of photocatalysts is a precondition for photocatalysis,82 the authors presented a new insight in photocatalytic mechanism, that may account for the photoactivity in the vicinity of photocatalysts. Yet, knowledge of such concept is limited. Uncertainties remain regarding the diffusion rate of active species and the stability of such surface migration.
Modification of application process
The methods of preparation of photocatalysts and their application to fibrous materials are important factors in improving the photocatalytic performance and stability. Uneven distribution of the photocatalyst and non-sustainable coating are common problems encountered. These factors may impact on the efficiency and long-term stability of the photocatalytic self-cleaning function. Thus, further investigation is recommended to advance the self-cleaning surface coating process such as through the incorporation of surface activation pre-treatment or post-treatment processes, so as to develop an optimum application sequence to boost the efficiency and stability of the photoactivity.
Empirical measurement methods
Photocatalytic self-cleaning fibrous materials have been witnessing accelerated technological progress in recent years. However, up till now, there has been no recognized international specification in standardizing the testing of efficiency and safety of these materials. Considering the potential of such materials and their wide applications, there is a pressing need to establish a series of universal empirical testing standards for objectively characterizing and evaluating the performance of newly developed self-cleaning fibrous products. In terms of safety, government regulation and labeling requirements for the production and use of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide-functionalized self-cleaning fibrous materials are also necessary.
Conclusions
In this contribution, an overview of the development of photocatalytic self-cleaning fibers and their future prospects is presented. These fibers with their tremendous potential in a wide range of applications may bring about substantial benefits to mankind and the environment through the saving of natural resources consumed during washing and cleaning processes. Although more research is needed to ensure maximum efficiency of the technology at minimum impact on the safety of living organisms and the environment, the scope of this technology may also be extended to as yet unknown fields.
