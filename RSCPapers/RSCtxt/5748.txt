    , Accepted 21st January 2015First published on 21st January 2015AbstractMicro- and nanocrystals with different facets may exhibit different chemical activities that are of great importance in practical applications. The electrochemical performances of Cu2O anodes with different crystal planes are compared. This work comprehensively investigates the effect of the crystal plane on the electrochemical performance of Cu2O. Firstly, Cu2O polyhedra with different morphologies, i.e., cube, octahedron and truncated octahedron, with different degrees of exposed {110} facets, were synthesized. Cu2O cubes show the highest capacity among these Cu2O polyhedra. The present results prove that the {100} facets of Cu2O display high electroactivities toward redox reactions. The electroactivity sequence of the crystal planes is {100} > {111} > {110}. These results confirm that the additional capacity of Cu2O is due to the generation of CuO, which can conduct a two-electron redox reaction. The anode performances of Cu2O polyhedra are dependent on planes, and this can provide a novel route to design high performance electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
1 Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries continue to play a critical role in the development of modern portable digital and wireless technologies.1,2 Further expanding their use in electrically powered vehicles and grid storage requires high energy density batteries.3 Various high performance electrode materials have been developed, such as hollow, core–shell structured materials, 1D and 2D materials.4–6 However, necessary performance improvements still require intensive research efforts aimed at improving active materials, particularly with regard to the ability of the electrode to withstand high discharge rates over an adequate cycle life.7 Electrode materials with different morphologies have shown different electrochemical performances for lithium-ion batteries.8,9 For example, the {010} plane of LiFePO4 has been proven a favorable plane for fast Li+ transfer.10 It is reported that the high surface density of exposed TiO2 {001} facets leads to fast lithium insertion/deinsertion processes in batteries, since the diffusion of Li+ ions in the anatase framework is more efficient along the c axis (i.e., in the [001] direction) than in the ab plane.11 As a conversion-type electrode material, the electrochemical capacities of Co3O4 polyhedra is in the sequence octahedra > truncated octahedra > cubes.12 These results show that Li+ transport in the {111} plane of Co3O4 is more favored than that in the {001} plane, because the {001} plane contains only 2 Co2+, but the {111} plane contains 3.75 Co2+, indicating that the {111} plane has more Co2+ than the {001} plane. These examples confirm that electrode materials with different crystal planes can exhibit different activities toward electrochemical reactions.12 However, the study of the role of the crystal plane of conversion-type electrode materials in electrochemical performance is still rarely reported.
As a direct band gap p-type semiconductor, Cu2O materials have been applied in catalysis, sensors, solar cells, and lithium-ion batteries.13–16 With a cubic crystal structure, Cu2O can crystallize into various morphologies, such as cubes, octahedra, 26-facet polyhedra, and rhombic dodecahedra.17–19 The polyhedra are often controlled by the low index facets of {100}, {111}, and {110}. The surface structure of Cu2O can influence its crystal habit and physical and chemical performances. Various properties of Cu2O materials with low-index and high-index planes have been studied in recent literature. Polyhedral 50-facet Cu2O microcrystals enclosed by {311} high-index planes show enhanced catalytic CO oxidation activity, significantly higher than those of rhombic dodecahedral, octahedral, and cubic microcrystals with corresponding {110}, {111}, and {100} facets.20 In addition, the CO behavior was modeled for the O-terminated Cu2O {100}, as it was found to be more stable than the Cu-terminated surface.21 However, it is not clear if the same enhanced reactivity of Cu2O electrode materials with different facets would be expected in electrochemical reactions with Li+ ions. Since Cu2O is a conversion anode for lithium batteries, the electrochemical performances of cubic, octahedral and 26-faceted polyhedral Cu2O with {110}, {111}, and {100} facets have been studied respectively.22–25 After 50 discharge–charge cycles, the discharge capacities of the Cu2O cube (80 nm) electrodes at a rate of 0.2 C and 1 C were 420 and 236 mA h g−1, respectively.22 The discharge capacities of Cu2O octahedron (40 nm) electrodes after 50 cycles were only 110 mA h g−1.23 However, systematic study of the electrochemical performance of Cu2O polyhedra with different crystal planes has not been well established.
In this work, the lithium-ion battery anode performances of Cu2O polyhedra with exposed {100}, {111}, and {110} crystal planes are reported. Cu2O polyhedra with different morphologies, i.e., cubes, octahedra and truncated octahedra, with different degrees of exposed {110} facets, were formed by a controlled synthesis procedure, and we compared their morphology-dependent lithiation reactions. Cu2O cubes show the highest capacity among these Cu2O polyhedra. The present results prove that the {100} facets of Cu2O display high electroactivity toward redox reactions. The electroactivity sequence of Cu2O crystallographic planes in the lithiation reactions is {100} > {111} > {110}.
2 Experimental
Synthesis of Cu2O cubes
0.5 mmol CuSO4, 0.6 mmol sodium citrate and 2 mmol NaOH were dissolved in 14 ml water. Then, 6 ml ascorbic acid (AA, 0.1 M) was added to the above solution with stirring. After reaction of about 2–3 h, yellow precipitates were filtered out and dried at 50 °C for further characterization.
Synthesis of Cu2O octahedra
0.5 mmol CuSO4, and 2 mmol NaOH were dissolved in 20 ml water. Then, 0.2 ml N2H4·H2O was added to the above solution with stirring. After reaction of about 2–3 h, Cu2O precipitates were obtained.
Synthesis of Cu2O 26-facet octahedra with small-area exposed {110} planes
0.5 mmol CuCl2, 0.6 mmol sodium citrate and 1 mmol Na2B4O7·H2O were dissolved in 14 ml water. Then, 6 ml ascorbic acid (0.1 M) was added to the above solution with stirring. After reaction of about 2–3 h, yellow precipitates were filtered out and dried at 50 °C for further characterization.
Synthesis of Cu2O 26-facet octahedra with large-area exposed {110} planes
0.5 mmol CuCl2, 0.3 mmol sodium citrate and 1 mmol Na2B4O7·H2O were dissolved in 14 ml water. Then, 6 ml ascorbic acid (0.1 M) was added to the above solution with stirring. After reaction of about 2–3 h, Cu2O precipitates were obtained.
The as-obtained products were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S4800) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer.
For the lithium-ion battery anode properties, coin cells (CR2025) were fabricated using Cu2O as the working electrode and lithium metal as the counter electrode. Working electrodes were prepared by mixing a Cu2O sample, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 70:20:10. The mixtures were blended with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and pasted onto the copper foils. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate–diethyl carbonate (EC:DMC:DEC, 1:1:1 vol%) solvent mixture. Charge–discharge tests were performed using a CT2001A cell tester (LAND Electronic Co.) over the potential range 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li and at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D) at a scan rate of 0.3 mV s−1 and over a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li.
3 Results and discussion
Chemical reduction is the often used route to synthesize Cu2O crystals from Cu2+ in aqueous solution.26,27 In this case, we designed a controllable procedure to synthesize Cu2O polyhedra with different exposed facets. Cu2O products can be only formed in alkaline solution, and in the chemical reduction route, the following reactions can occur: Cu2+ + e− → Cu+(1) Cu+ + OH− → CuOH(2) 2CuOH → Cu2O + H2O(3)
Due to the small value of KΘsp(CuOH) = 1 × 10−14, CuOH can form quickly when the reducing agent is added into the copper–alkaline precursor solution. However, CuOH is metastable and should readily decompose into Cu2O according to reaction (3). Because the calculated enthalpy of reaction (3) is ΔH (298.15 K) = −46.1 kJ mol−1, and the Gibbs free energy is ΔG (298.15 K) = −56.4 kJ mol−1, reaction (3) is strongly shifted toward the formation of Cu2O and water.28 In order to control the synthesis of Cu2O, we can adjust the chemical reaction rate of reaction (1) and (2), as shown in Scheme 1 and Fig. S1.† Using different reducing agents, the rate of reaction (1) can be controlled. At the same time, adding different kinds of alkali can influence the rate of reaction (2). The ligand molecules can affect both reactions (1) and (2) by changing the reduction potential and complexation reaction.17 2Cu2+ + 2cit3− + 2OH− → [Cu2cit2H−2]4− + 2H2O(4)
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the chemical reaction and crystallization process based on the reduction synthesis of Cu2O polyhedra from Cu2+. 
The dimer, [Cu2cit2H−2]4−, can have a structure with two equivalent copper(II) ions, both coordinated to three carboxylate and one alcoholate groups.17 Herein H−2 denotes double deprotonation of the hydroxyl group in the citrate molecules. The formation of the Cu2+–citrate complex can prevent the development of Cu(OH)2 precipitates in the precursor solution, which can maintain the occurrence of a homogeneous reduction reaction. The change of the chemical reaction rate can increase or decrease the supersaturation of Cu2O, thus we can manipulate the crystallization process of Cu2O. According to our previous calculations, the thermodynamically stable morphology of Cu2O is an octahedron.29 The alteration of crystallization kinetics can lead to the synthesis of non-equilibrium Cu2O morphologies, such as cubes and truncated octahedra. Therefore, by controlling the equilibrium between reactions (1) and (2) we can synthesize Cu2O crystals with different morphologies. As shown in Scheme 1, we can crystallize different Cu2O polyhedra by using ligand molecules, different reducing agents (ascorbic acid and N2H4·H2O) and alkalis (Na2B4O7 and NaOH). The reducing ability of N2H4·H2O is higher than that of ascorbic acid. With the use of the strong reducing agent N2H4·H2O, the rate of the chemical reaction is increased, leading to enhancement of the crystallization kinetics. Na2B4O7 is a weak alkali, while NaOH is a strong alkali. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the chemical reaction and crystallization can be adjusted by using these different kinds of reducing agents and alkalis.
Without adding the citrate ligand to the precursor solution, thermodynamically stable Cu2O octahedra were formed, indicating the occurrence of thermodynamically-controlled crystallization. When citrate molecules were introduced into the reaction solution, Cu2O cubes and truncated octahedra were formed via a kinetically-controlled crystallization route (Scheme 1, Fig. 1 and Fig. S1†). The term “truncated octahedron” means that the corners and edges of an octahedron are partially cut off, for example, a {110} and {100} truncated octahedron means that this octahedron exposes the {100}, {110} and {111} crystal facets. SEM images and the corresponding drawings of Cu2O polyhedra – cubes, octahedra, and two kinds of {110} and {100} truncated octahedra – are shown in Fig. 1a and b. It should be noted that in our controlled synthesis procedure, the citrate ligand was not used as facet capping agent. Without adding the citrate ligand to the precursor solution, we could still synthesize Cu2O cubes, as shown in Fig. S2.†

(c) Surface structures of Cu2O: side views of the {100}, {111} and {110} surfaces. Orange and red spheres indicate Cu and O atoms, respectively. 
According to our chemical bonding theory of single crystal growth, the Cu2O polyhedra often have different crystal planes.29–32Fig. 1c shows schematic models of the {100}, {111} and {110} surfaces. The Cu2O cubes and octahedra expose the {100} and {111} planes, respectively. The {110} and {100} truncated octahedra include three kinds of crystal planes: {100}, {111} and {110}. The areas of the {110} planes are different in these two kinds of {110} and {100} truncated octahedra. The stacking order of the {100} surfaces along the [100] axis is –O–Cu–O–Cu–, thus the {100} surfaces can be O-terminated or Cu-terminated planes, which consist entirely of either O anions or Cu cations.33 On the {111} surface, the Cu layer is sandwiched between two layers of O atoms that form two adjacent layers in the –O–Cu–O– sandwich structure. The {110} surface can be either a Cu-terminated or an –O–Cu–O– terminated surface (Fig. 1c), where –O–Cu–O–Cu– is the surface {110} layer atom arrangement. The different surface structures can induce different surface properties in Cu2O materials.
Much research has been done to synthesize morphology-controlled Cu2O polyhedra.34–36 For example, two types of Cu2O nanocrystals, cubes and rhombic dodecahedra unifaceted with either {001} or {110} crystal planes have been prepared using n-hexadecylamine as a passivating adsorbate to control crystal morphology, and as a reducing agent to generate monovalent Cu+.18 By simply varying the amount of NH2OH·HCl added, cubic, truncated cubic, cuboctahedral, truncated octahedral, and octahedral Cu2O polyhedra have been synthesized.35 Recently, Cu2O nanocrystals ranging from complete cubes, through truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and truncated cubes, to complete octahedra have been demonstrated by chemical deposition.34 In this case, the controllable synthesis of Cu2O morphologies is attributed to competitive adsorption of citrate and hydroxide anions on the Cu2O {100} and {111} crystal faces and selective stabilization of these faces. In our present work, we have designed chemical reactions, i.e., reduction, complexation and precipitation reactions, to control the synthesis of Cu2O thermodynamically- and kinetically-stable morphologies, without using additives.

Fig. 2 shows low-magnification SEM images of Cu2O crystals. The Cu2O cubes have well-defined shapes and sizes of 50–100 nm (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 2b, these Cu2O octahedra have smooth surfaces and the size of each Cu2O octahedron can reach 100–400 nm. Two kinds of {110} and {100} truncated octahedra can be seen in Fig. 2c and d. The truncated octahedron has 26 facets, including 8 {111}, 6 {100} and 12 {110} planes. On adding a small amount of citrate, truncated octahedra with large-area exposed {110} planes can be obtained. The reduction of the ligand molecules can weaken their complexation with Cu2+, thus Cl− can favor the growth of the {110} planes.36 XRD was used to characterize the phases of the final products (Fig. 3). Pure phase Cu2O can be formed, which matches the cubic phase Cu2O (PDF no. 5-667). Only a small amount of Cu metal is present in the truncated octahedra with small-area exposed {110} planes, showing that the reduction ability is enhanced in this reaction system. The digital images of the obtained Cu2O polyhedra are shown in Fig. S3,† which shows the colors of the Cu2O samples. The Cu2O cubic powder is yellow, while the octahedral and {110} and {100} truncated octahedral powders are yellow-brown.

In order to evaluate the electrochemical properties of Cu2O, these polyhedra were used as electrode materials for lithium-ion battery anodes. The electrodes were prepared by coating a current collector with a homogeneous slurry containing Cu2O polyhedra, acetylene black, and PVDF. Fig. 4 shows the discharge/charge curves of the Cu2O polyhedra, measured in a half-cell with a Li metal counter electrode and at the current density of 100 mA g−1. The first discharge capacities are 784, 284.1, 648.3 and 556.6 mA h g−1 for cubes, octahedra, truncated octahedra with small-area exposed {110} planes, and truncated octahedra with large-area exposed {110} planes, respectively. These values are higher than the theoretical capacity of Cu2O (372 mA h g−1). The cycling performances of these Cu2O polyhedra anodes are displayed in Fig. 5a, S4, and S5.† After 50 discharge–charge cycles, the capacities of the Cu2O polyhedra are 397, 245.8, 201.5, and 197.2 mA h g−1 for cubes, octahedra, truncated octahedra with small-area exposed {110} planes, and truncated octahedra with large-area exposed {110} planes, respectively. The capacity data with large differences indeed confirmed that the anisotropic crystal planes of the Cu2O polyhedra play an important role in searching for high performance lithium-ion battery electrode materials. In all samples, the discharge–charge efficiencies approached 100% after the second discharge–charge cycles. It can be concluded that Cu2O cubes with {100} facets show the highest capacity. Cu2O polyhedra with exposed {110} planes show the lowest capacity. Therefore, the electroactivity sequence of Cu2O crystal planes is {100} > {111} > {110}.

The cycling stabilities of the Cu2O anodes were obtained at a current rate of 100 mA g−1. The CV curves were measured after 50 charge–discharge cycles at the scan rate of 0.3 mV s−1 and over the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li. 
Table S1† shows the lithium-ion battery anode performances of Cu2O polyhedra reported in the literature. After 50 discharge–charge cycles, the discharge capacity of the Cu2O cube (80 nm) electrodes at a rate of 0.2 C was 420 mA h g−1, while Cu2O cubes with sizes of 1–2 μm showed a capacity of 390 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.2 C. The discharge capacities of Cu2O octahedron (40 nm) and 26-faceted polyhedron electrodes were only 110 and 105 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively. These results prove that Cu2O cubes have the highest capacity among the Cu2O polyhedra. Our synthesized Cu2O cubes also show high electroactivity toward lithiation reactions. However, none of these cases compared the electrochemical performances of Cu2O polyhedra with different exposed crystal planes in the same work.
Tarascon et al. studied the size-dependent electrochemical performances of spherical Cu2O particles of 0.15 and 1 μm, and found that small particles lead to large capacity fading.37 As shown in Table S1,† Cu2O cubes with sizes of 1–2 μm can show larger capacities than those of 80 nm Cu2O cubes. It should be emphasized that Cu2O has an exciton radius of 0.7 nm, therefore, only when the diameter of the Cu2O samples becomes less than 1 nm, can their size effect have a function. In this work, the size of the Cu2O polyhedra is bigger than 50 nm (most of them are on the microscale), therefore, the size effect of these Cu2O samples on their electrochemical performances becomes less significant. This is the reason for which we have studied the crystal plane growth effect instead, as this can significantly affect the electrochemical performances of Cu2O polyhedra.
One more interesting result is that the capacity values of Cu2O polyhedra are higher than the theoretical capacity of Cu2O (372 mA h g−1). Previous works have attributed the higher capacity to the reversible formation and decomposition of a polymeric gel-like film on the surface of the Cu2O particles. However, an additional reason can be used to explain the extra capacity. Recent experiments and theoretical calculations have shown that a major contribution to the extra capacity in the RuO2 anode system is due to the generation of LiOH, and its subsequent reversible reaction with Li to form Li2O and LiH.38 Recently, the capacities of Cu2O nanorod arrays increasing from 323 to 1206 mA h g−1 during 500 cycles were reported. In this case, the capacity enhancement is due to a phase transformation from Cu2O to CuO, nano-restructuring of nanorods into fragmented nanoparticles, and the progressive generation of an electroactive polymeric gel-like layer on the surface of the nanoparticles.39 Herein, we believe the formation of the CuO phase during the cycling is the major reason for the high discharge capacity of the Cu2O anode.
In the first discharge curves, two sloping voltage stages, 3.0–1.5 V and 1.5–0.01 V, can be found, which indicate the occurrence of a reduction reaction. The reaction mechanism of the Cu2O anode is based on the conversion (redox) reaction: Cu2O + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ 2Cu + Li2O(5)
The Cu2O phase is reduced to Cu metal during the discharge process, while the Cu metal is re-oxidized to the Cu2O phase during the charge process. This redox reaction transfers one electron per Cu atom, and can only exhibit a capacity of 372 mA h g−1. The electrochemical properties of CuO are also based on the conversion reaction mechanism, and the reversible reaction can be shown as follows: CuO + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Cu + Li2O(6)
This reaction can transfer two electrons per Cu atom, and can exhibit a capacity 2-fold that of the Cu2O electrode, that is 674 mA h g−1. The high first discharge capacities of Cu2O polyhedra, which are twice the theoretical capacity of Cu2O, could be due to the occurrence of a two-electron transfer reaction.
In order to further study the charge storage mechanism of Cu2O polyhedra, we performed CV tests. The CV curves of the Cu2O polyhedra after 50 discharge–charge cycles were measured at a scan rate of 0.3 mV s−1 over the potential range 0.01–3.0 V (Fig. 5b). The larger the area of the CV curve, the larger the capacity is. According to Fig. 5b, Cu2O cubes show the highest capacity among the Cu2O polyhedra. Three reduction peaks and two oxidation peaks can be found in the CV curves (Fig. 5c and d). The three reduction peaks are due to the formation of CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2, Cu2O and Cu, while the two oxidation peaks are due to the formation of Cu2O and CuO. The CV results further prove the formation of the CuO phase in Cu2O polyhedra anodes after multiple discharge–charge cycles. During the discharge–charge cycling, when a voltage of 3.0 V was applied to the cell, the Cu2O phase was easily oxidized to the CuO phase in this cell system with the presence of an organic electrolyte.
During the discharge–charge cycle, the following multi-step electrochemical reactions could occur:40 CuO + xLi+ + xe− → CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2 + x/2Li2O (0 < x < 0.4)(7) CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2 + (1 − x)Li+ + (1 − x)e− → 1/2Cu2O + (1 − x)/2Li2O(8) 1/2Cu2O + Li+ + e− → Cu + 1/2Li2O(9)
The peak intensity of the Cu2O cube anode is higher than those of the other polyhedra, especially the peaks of Cu+ ↔ Cu2+ and Cu+ ↔ Cu. The present results show that Cu2O cubes with {100} planes can easily be transformed into CuO during the in situ electrochemical reaction process. The additional capacity of the electrode is due to the generation of CuO during the Cu2O conversion reaction, which can conduct a two-electron redox reaction. Recent work has proven that during CO catalysis, Cu2O nanocrystals can undergo a surface restructuring process to form CuO.41
The Cu2O phase is more stable in the solid state than the CuO phase, because the Cu+ has a stable d10 structure. However, Cu2O is not stable in solution conditions. An electrolyte and electric field are present in the practical electrochemical reaction system. Thus, the Cu2O phase is easily oxidized to the CuO phase in this cell system. In addition, atom rearrangement and lattice/unit cell reconstruction were needed when the formation of monoclinic CuO from the cubic Cu2O phase occurred. When the {100} surfaces of Cu2O are Cu-terminated planes, the oxidation reaction from the Cu2O phase to the CuO phase is more facile. However, on the {111} and {110} surfaces, which are a mixture of Cu and O atoms, it is difficult for the oxidation reaction to occur. The electrochemical activities of the {100}, {111} and {110} facets are ranked in the order {100} > {111} > {110}. A similar phenomenon can be found in Co3O4 polyhedra, serving as conversion-type lithium-ion battery anodes.12 Because the {111} plane has more Co2+ than the {001} plane, the electrochemical reaction in the {111} plane of Co3O4 is more favored than that in the {001} plane.
It has been found that the first lithiation reaction is very important for subsequent electrochemical performance,42 and the electrode structure formed in situ during the first lithiation reaction can activate electrode materials.43,44 However, the initially-formed morphologies of active materials with high electrochemical performances can affect their in situ formed structures. In our case, Cu2O polyhedra with different exposed crystal planes can have different electrochemical performances, due to the fact that the Cu atom density of the {100} surfaces is the highest among the {100}, {111} and {110} facets. Thus, Cu2O cubes with {100} facets can form an electroactive structure in situ, which shows the best electrochemical performance in our present work.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have compared the electrochemical performances of Cu2O anodes with different crystal planes of {100}, {111}, {110}. Cu2O cubes have the highest capacity of 397 mA h g−1 after 50 discharge–charge cycles. The electrochemical performances of Cu2O polyhedra can be ranked as: cubes > octahedra > truncated {100} and {110} octahedra. The electrochemical activities of the {100}, {111} and {110} crystal facets are in the order {100} > {111} > {110}. The present results prove that the {100} facets of Cu2O display high electroactivity toward redox reaction. In addition, the higher discharge capacities of the Cu2O polyhedra compared to the theoretical capacity of Cu2O could be due to the formation of CuO during the electrochemical reaction. The anode performances of the Cu2O polyhedra are dependent on crystal planes, and this can provide a novel route to design high-performance electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. This research demonstrates a protocol for studying the morphology–performance relationship in battery electrode systems.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the chemical reaction and crystallization process based on the reduction synthesis of Cu2O polyhedra from Cu2+.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM images and (b) schematic drawings of Cu2O with different polyhedra: cubes, octahedra, and two kinds of {110} and {100} truncated octahedra. (c) Surface structures of Cu2O: side views of the {100}, {111} and {110} surfaces. Orange and red spheres indicate Cu and O atoms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of Cu2O with different morphologies. (a) Cubes, (b) octahedra, (c) and (d) truncated octahedra with different degrees of exposed {110} facets. Insets show schematic drawings of the Cu2O polyhedra.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns of Cu2O with different morphologies. (a) Cubes, (b) octahedra, (c) truncated octahedra with small-area exposed {110} planes, and (d) truncated octahedra with large-area exposed {110} planes. The standard XRD pattern of Cu2O (PDF no. 5-667) is also shown. Peaks for metallic Cu are also indicated.	 

 	Fig. 4  Discharge–charge curves of Cu2O with different morphologies. (a) Cubes, (b) octahedra, (c) truncated octahedra with small-area exposed {110} planes, and (d) truncated octahedra with large-area exposed {110} planes. The discharge–charge curves of the Cu2O anodes were obtained at a current rate of 100 mA g−1 and over the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li.	 

 	Fig. 5  Cycling performances (a) and CV curves (b) of Cu2O with different morphologies: cubes, octahedra and truncated octahedra with different degrees of exposed {110} facets. Comparison of reduction peaks (c) and oxidation peaks (d) in CV curves. The insets in (a) show the corresponding SEM images of the Cu2O polyhedra. The cycling stabilities of the Cu2O anodes were obtained at a current rate of 100 mA g−1. The CV curves were measured after 50 charge–discharge cycles at the scan rate of 0.3 mV s−1 and over the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li.
