    , Accepted 5th July 2021First published on 10th July 2021AbstractMesocrystals have received intense attention in the electrochemical energy storage field owing to their favourable electronic conductivity, high crystallinity and large specific surface area. However, a critical limitation to the wide applications of mesocrystals is the lack of a facile synthesis approach for high-performance mesocrystals. Here, we report a one-step self-assembly solvothermal method to prepare 3D hierarchical highly-ordered Nb3O7F nanowire cluster mesocrystals (denoted NOF-NCMs), of which the diameter of each nanowire is within 10 nm. Through kinetic analysis, NOF-NCMs can be confirmed to provide unique intercalation pseudocapacitance, enabling rapid charge transfer. When used as an anode material, the NOF-NCM electrode displays a high capacity of ∼356.7 mAh g−1 at 800 mA g−1, excellent rate performance and a long cycle life with ∼88.3% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. The improved electrochemical properties of NOF-NCMs are attributed to the unique highly-ordered nanowire cluster architectures. A lithium ion capacitor (LIC) is constructed by using well-prepared NOF-NCMs as an anode and commercial AC as a cathode. The NOF-NCMs//AC LIC can hold a maximum energy density of 74.5 W h kg−1 at 87.5 W kg−1, and has a long cycle lifespan with a 92.5% capacity retention after 3000 cycles and low self-discharge rate, demonstrating a bright candidate for applications in both high-energy and high-power electrochemical energy storage.
1. Introduction
Mesocrystals with highly-ordered hierarchical superstructures have drawn considerable interests due to their special and controllable physical and chemical performances and their promising applications in functional materials.1–4 Mesocrystals, an abbreviation for mesoscopically structured crystals, are deemed as a new class of crystal system relative to conventional single-crystal systems and polycrystalline systems.5,6 Interestingly, mesocrystals possess monocrystalline-like atomic structures and similar scattering patterns with a smaller coherence length but with higher porosity compared to classic single crystals. Therefore, mesocrystal materials are regarded as potential substitute materials for single crystal materials and polycrystalline materials, which have been widely applied in photocatalysis, sensitive materials, and electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices (EESCDs).5–9 To date, a vast variety of mesocrystal materials have been discovered and/or prepared.1,8,10–15 Meanwhile, a number of valuable formation mechanism models for mesocrystals have been put forth on the basis of various synthetic driving forces including organic matrices, physical fields and interparticle forces.6,14,16,17 However, the detailed self-assembly formation mechanism of mesocrystals cannot be completely explained and needs to be further studied.
According to previous reports, the solvothermal synthetic method has been proved to be a feasible technique for the synthesis of mesocrystals according to reported structures including Nb3O7(OH) nanowire-network,7 ZnO superstructure,18 zinc–nitrilotriacetic acid mesocrystals,19 and CeO2 mesocrystals.20 Among them, niobium-based materials have attracted intense interest due to their structural diversity, giving rise to their wide range of applications in dye-sensitized solar cells, sensors, photocatalysis, and lithium ion storage.21–24 As a well-known niobium-based material, niobium pentoxide is considered as a promising electrode material for EESCDs owing to its acceptable theoretical capacity, low-strain lattice structure, and unique intercalation pseudocapacitance.24–26 However, Nb2O5 suffers from a low bulk electrical conductivity, resulting in slow transferring of electrons.27 To improve the conductivity, one available route is to synthesize target products with desirable nanostructures. So far, various nanostructured Nb2O5 materials have been prepared for EESCDs, such as nanowires,28 mesoporous structure,29 nanosheets,30 and hollow nanospheres.31 Another possible route is to modify the materials with heteroelements (such as C, N, P, S, and F), leading to a narrowed band gap thus directly ameliorating electronic conductivity.23,32,33 As for Nb3O7F, the improvement in electronic and ionic conductivity is due to the introduction of a fluorine ion as a substitute for the oxygen ion, which can efficiently reduce the electronic polarizability.34 In early 1983, Cava et al. published a report about the Li intercalation properties of Nb3O7F and pointed out its ReO3-like structure.35 In 1992, Permér et al. reported the composites (Li3xNb3O7F, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.5) obtained by chemically inserting Li into Nb3O7F.36 These works demonstrate that inserting Li into Nb3O7F materials is feasible in theory and technology. Very recently, several works have reported the successful synthesis of Nb3O7F.34,37–39 However, there are few reports that explored the formation mechanism and the lithium storage properties of Nb3O7F mesocrystals.
Among lithium storage devices, the lithium ion capacitor (LIC) has attracted much research interest due to its unique ability to bridge the energy and power gap between a battery and supercapacitor.40–42 Respectively adopting battery-type and capacitor-type materials as electrodes, the LIC can feasibly achieve both high energy density and high power output.42 Since the ionic transport rate of the battery-type reaction is slower than that of the supercapacitor-type ionic storage process, kinetic imbalance between the battery-type and supercapacitor-type electrodes is one well-known limiting factor.33 Therefore, searching for a high-power battery-type material is a significant key to construct a high-performance LIC device. Due to their merits of unique structure, mesocrystal materials have also been reported to be prospective materials with high-rate ability for utilization in LIC devices.43,44
In this work, we developed a facile one-step self-assembly solvothermal synthetic method to prepare highly-ordered Nb3O7F nanowire cluster mesocrystals (NOF-NCMs). The NOF-NCMs were harvested by controlling the reaction conditions including temperature and concentrations of HCl and HF, and the formation mechanism was simultaneously revealed. Through kinetic analysis, the NOF-NCMs are proved to have such a unique intercalation pseudocapacitance. Therefore, when constructed as a half cell, the NOF-NCM electrode exhibited a large reversible capacity, excellent rate performance and long cycle life. Moreover, when adopting the well-synthesized NOF-NCM material as an anode and commercial AC as a cathode, a 0–3.5 V LIC device is constructed. With a well-optimized voltage window, the as-constructed NOF-NCMs//AC LIC is able to exhibit a high energy density of 74.5 W h kg−1, long cycling stability and low self-discharge rate.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials synthesis
All the experimental chemical reagents are of analytical grade and can be directly used after purchase without any further treatment. In a typical synthesis process, 0.36 g niobium chloride (NbCl5; 99.99%; Aladdin) was dissolved in 20 mL of isopropanol ((CH3)2CHOH; 99.7%; Aladdin), then 150–400 μL of hydrofluoric acid (HF, ∼50 wt% in water) and 10–90 μL of hydrochloric acid (HCl, ∼37 wt% in water) were added to the solution together. Next, the obtained solution was placed under slow magnetic stirring to obtain a homogenous solution. The solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was heated at 180–240 °C for 0–48 h. After the corresponding reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down to ∼25 °C. Finally, the resulting products were centrifugally collected and washed with absolute alcohol 3 times. The final products (NOF-NCMs) were dried by vacuum drying at 60 °C for 24 h. Materials characterization and electrochemical measurements are displayed in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure characterization
Highly-ordered NOF-NCMs were synthesized by a typical one-step solvothermal synthesis process. For a solvothermal reaction, the reaction conditions (such as temperature, reaction time, concentration of hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid) have a great influence on the crystal formation process. As shown in Fig. S1–S3,† a variety of corresponding morphologies could be achieved under different reaction conditions. Among them, NOF-NCMs with highly-ordered nanowire-clusters appear to be the most unique, since this novel morphology delivers not only high crystallinity but also a large surface area (∼111.4 m2 g−1, Fig. S4†). Based on experimental results and data analysis, the highly-ordered NOF-NCMs can be obtained by using a reaction temperature of 220 °C, a growth time of 24 h, 20 mL isopropanol, 200 μL of hydrofluoric acid and 30 μL of hydrochloric acid. All electrochemical tests were performed by using the samples which were prepared under these conditions.
The XRD characterization result of the as-synthesized product is shown in Fig. 1a. Specifically, all the diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized products are well indexed to the standard card of orthorhombic Nb3O7F (JCPDS#: 74-2363), indicating that orthorhombic Nb3O7F products without any impurities can be obtained under the aforementioned solvothermal reaction conditions. However, the intensity ratio of the peaks located at 22.62° and 23.58°, corresponding to the (001) and (110) crystallographic planes of orthorhombic Nb3O7F, is calculated to be ∼1.66, which is higher than that of the standard one (∼1.36). To calculate the suitable lattice parameters of the obtained products, eqn (1) is proposed as follows: (1/d)2 = (h/a)2 + (k/b)2 + (l/c)2(1)The calculated lattice parameters of the obtained products (for instance: a = 20.71 Å, b = 3.834 Å, and c = 3.934 Å) are very close to the standard ones (a = 20.67 Å, b = 3.83 Å, and c = 3.92 Å). This difference in the lattice parameters could probably be due to the unique morphology of the as-prepared product. Fig. 1b shows that the crystal structure of Nb3O7F is composed of ReO3-structure type blocks, in which the fluorine and oxygen atoms are supposed to randomly substitute with each other.45

The detailed morphologies of the as-prepared NOF-NCMs were observed by FESEM and HRTEM. Fig. 2a and b show that the NOF-NCMs are composed of a large number of ultra-fine nanowires. In the NOF-NCMs, the ultra-fine nanowires are arranged extremely closely along a fixed direction, which gives evidence for preferential orientation growth. The growth pattern for the NOF-NCMs can be found to be the tightly aligned formation of ultra-fine nanowires as shown in Fig. 2b. Furthermore, the ultra-fine nanowires with a length of ∼170 nm are relatively uniform in vertical distribution. Fig. 2c and d show that the size of each nanowire subunit is around 10 nm in diameter. The HRTEM image of the NOF-NCMs (Fig. 2d) reveals that the adjacent lattice fringes distance is around 0.391 nm calculated by the selected fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique, confirming that these Nb3O7F ultra-fine nanowires preferentially grow along the [001] direction. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2d, the SAED pattern reveals “single-crystal-like” diffraction patterns corresponding to orthorhombic Nb3O7F. According to the previous report of Cölfen et al., single-crystal-like nanowire self-assembly into complex superstructures in solution can be categorized as mesocrystals.6 Therefore, the SAED pattern (Fig. 2d) and the nanowire-cluster-like superstructures (Fig. 2a and b) can reasonably demonstrate the successful formation of a mesocrystal structure. Interestingly, Fig. S5† shows that two kinds of SAED patterns (SAED-a1 and SAED-b1) can be obtained by detecting different data acquisition positions. However, there is an apparent difference between SAED-a1 and SAED-b1. Compared with SAED-b1, two sets of similar electron diffraction spot matrices but with different orientations can be observed in SAED-a1. On a closer inspection, the electron diffraction spot matrix with low brightness of SAED-a1 is very similar to that of SAED-b1, especially the orientation of the electron diffraction spot matrix. Thus, we can draw a conclusion that the microscopic crystal growth mechanism of the NOF-NCMs is the preferential growth orientation in the [001] direction while the macroscopic growth mechanism is the growth starting from both sides of reaction precursors. As determined by BET measurement (Fig. S4†), the NOF-NCMs show a relatively high specific area of ∼111.4 m2 g−1 with pore sizes mostly lower than 5 nm (average pore size: ∼3.7 nm). Moreover, a uniform distribution of Nb, O, and F across the ultra-fine nanowire cluster structures is displayed in the EDS elemental mapping patterns (Fig. 2e).

3.2 Orientation formation mechanism
To comprehend the formation mechanism of the NOF-NCMs, the related reaction conditions should be clearly investigated. As is well-known, the extremely intense hydrolysis property of a free Nb5+ ion prevents it from individually existing in aqueous solution, leading to the formation of relevant Nb-containing compounds such as H2NbOF5, Nb(OH)5, H2NbF7 and HNbF6.34,37,46 Since the reaction system contains a large amount of HF, the following reactions possibly take place:46 NbCl5 + 7HF → H2NbF7 + 5HCl(2) 3H2NbF7 + 7H2O → Nb3O7F↓ + 20HF(3)
According to eqn (2) and (3), HF and HCl play an important role in the synthesis of the NOF-NCMs. Following previous reports, HCl functions as a regulator for pH and reaction velocity and mainly provides an acidic environment for the preferred growth orientation in the (001) direction with the help of isopropanol.46,47 We also developed a set of experiments to verify the function of Cl− (Fig. S6†). Interestingly, the NOF-NCMs could also be synthesized in a reaction solution system containing HNO3 or H2SO4. Thus, we conclude that Cl− is not the key factor in the formation of the NOF-NCMs.
Subsequently, the relationships between different reaction conditions and the corresponding morphologies are clearly discussed in the ESI,† as displayed in Fig. S1–S3. Fig. S1† shows that the NOF-NCMs begin to have their embryonic form at 180 °C and it was achieved at 200 and 220 °C, while large bulk-like structures are obtained at a higher temperature of 240 °C. This could be due to that higher reaction temperature leads to higher reaction speed, resulting in the formation of bulk-like structures. Fig. S2 and S3† show the effects of different HF and HCl concentrations on the morphologies of the as-synthesized products, respectively. A similarity between them is that higher concentration gives rise to faster reaction speed, implying a tendency to form bulk-like structures. Various morphologies are gained under different HF concentrations (bulk: 300–400 μL; bulk and nanowires: 250–300 μL; nanowire clusters: 150–250 μL). We find that the morphologies of the as-synthesized products still remain as nanowire-cluster structures with the increase of HCl concentration in spite of the existence of some bulk-like structures at a high HCl concentration of 90 μL. Consequently, the concentration of HF has a more significant effect on the morphology than that of HCl.
Being aware of the important role of HF, the etching duration time (or the solvothermal reaction time) of HF should also be the key for the formation process of the NOF-NCMs. Therefore, to further confirm the formation mechanism, we developed a time-dependent experiment as shown in Fig. 3a. It was noticeable that when the reaction time was 0 h, a bulk structure was formed at room temperature (shown in Fig. 3a). Undergoing the first 1 h of solvothermal treatment, the bulk precursor was slightly etched by HF from both sides, which corresponds to the analysis results in Fig. S5.† As seen in Fig. 3b, a new diffraction peak appears at 22.6° with prolonging the reaction time to 1 h, which can be indexed to the (001) crystallographic plane of Nb3O7F and indicates the initial formation of Nb3O7F. Therefore, the thickness of the middle part was larger than that of the two sides, implying the incomplete etching of HF. The morphology transformation from bulk structures into nanowire structures (only a line-like structure remained in the middle) was observed after a solvothermal synthesis time of 6 h, indicating the nearly full use of the etching effect of HF. When the reaction time reached 12 h, the bulk structures were completely evaporated and the nanowire cluster morphology has basically taken shape. Because of the effect of interparticle forces derived from nanowires, these nanowires of the sample with a solvothermal synthesis time of 24 h were proved to be arranged more tightly than those of the sample with a solvothermal synthesis time of 12 h. Moreover, it can be found that all the diffraction peaks of the sample synthesized after 24 h are well matched with those of Nb3O7F (Fig. 3b), demonstrating the complete formation of pure Nb3O7F. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that the as-synthesized sample consists of four different growth stages: (1) entirely bulk structures, (2) the coexistence of nanowires and bulk structures, (3) complete nanowire structures, and (4) compactly arranged nanowire cluster structures caused by an aggregation process. Furthermore, the schematic pictures are also shown in Fig. 3a, which clearly illustrate the intermediate steps of the solvothermal formation of the NOF-NCMs.

3.3 Kinetics and electrochemical properties
The electrochemical performances of the NOF-NCMs were then investigated in a half cell configuration using Li metal as the counter and reference electrodes. Fig. S7† and 4a and b exhibit the cycling voltammetry (CV) curves of the NOF-NCM electrode in a potential window of 0.01–3 V. The CV curves of the NOF-NCMs at 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. S7†) demonstrate a slight irreversible capacity loss. Such an irreversible loss could be ascribed to the formation of an anode solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the discharging process.48 As displayed in Fig. 4a, the anodic peak located at ∼1.47 V is attributed to the Li+ deintercalation process. Meanwhile, the cathodic reactions could be observed at the peaks around 0.98 and 1.22 V, which is analogous to the CV behavior of orthorhombic Nb2O5.24 A low potential separation can be found in the symmetrical anode and cathode peaks with the increase of sweep rates as shown in Fig. 4b. However, it is worth noting that the shapes of all the CV curves are basically similar during the cathodic and anodic sweep processes. To further reveal the kinetic properties of the NOF-NCMs, the power law relationship (eqn (4) or (5)) was proposed as a general expression for kinetic analysis.25,30,49 i = avb(4)or logi = loga + blogv(5)In eqn (5) and (6), i stands for the current and a and b represent the adjustable parameters. Among them, the b-value, depending on the slope of logi vs. logv, is used to make a distinction between diffusion-controlled and capacitive-limited behaviors. Interestingly, the electrochemical behavior can be confirmed to be controlled by diffusion when the b-value is 0.5.30 In contrast, the b-value is 1, indicating an absolute capacitive behavior.49 As exhibited in Fig. 4c, the b-values of the anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.79 and 0.81, respectively. These imply that the kinetic behavior of the NOF-NCMs is mainly determined by the capacitive factor, revealing their intercalation pseudocapacitance. To further confirm the intercalation pseudocapacitance of the NOF-NCMs, the capacitive contribution can be quantified in detail by the following equation:24,50 itotal = idiffusion + icapacitive = k1v1/2 + k2v(6)
or itotal/v1/2 = k1 + k2v1/2(7)where i, v, and k stand for the current, scan rate, and adjustable parameter, respectively. As presented in Fig. 4d, the capacitive contribution of the NOF-NCMs can be calculated to be 57% of the overall stored charge at 0.5 mV s−1. Besides, a high capacitive contribution of 72% can be reached at 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 4e), implying the capacitive-dominant behavior and fast Li-insertion kinetics. As revealed in Fig. 4f, such remarkable kinetic properties of the NOF-NCMs can originate from its material itself and structural superiorities: 1) nanoscale size shortens the transfer pathway of e/Li+, enabling fast Li-insertion kinetics; 2) open spaces between nanowires contribute to the facile penetration of electrolytes, facilitating a highly reversible Li-insertion reaction. Thanks to these structural superiorities, the as-constructed NOF-NCM anode can undoubtedly hold rapid charge-stored kinetic and realize a high rate property.

(f) Schematic model of the electron/ion transfer pathway. 
To further estimate the electrochemical properties, the NOF-NCMs are subjected to galvanostatic charging–discharging test at different current densities. Fig. 5a exhibits the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles of the NOF-NCM electrode at 800 mA g−1. In the first cycle, the NOF-NCM electrode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of ∼304.3 mAh g−1 and a reversible charge capacity of ∼258.1 mAh g−1 at 800 mA g−1, which correspond to an irreversible loss of ∼15.2%, which is consistent with Fig. S7.† The charging–discharging curve for the 2nd cycle coincides well with the 1000th and 2000th cycles, demonstrating the high reversibility of the NOF-NCMs. We suggest that the unique nanostructures of the NOF-NCMs are beneficial to shorten the transport path of Li ions and promote the lithiation and de-lithiation process. As a result, the high reversibility of the NOF-NCM electrode can be easily obtained. Fig. 5b presents the rate performance of the NOF-NCMs and bulk Nb3O7F at different current densities, respectively. It is worth noting that the NOF-NCMs have a high reversible capacity of ∼356.7 mAh g−1 after 5 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and still retain a capacity of ∼206.2 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 3200 mA g−1. Meanwhile, the bulk Nb3O7F electrode has a capacity of ∼198.9 mAh g−1 after 5 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and only retains a capacity of ∼43.6 mAh g−1 at 3200 mA g−1. As the current density returns back to 100 mA g−1, the NOF-NCM electrode is also able to give a remarkable capacity of ∼384.4 mAh g−1 after 45 cycles. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the rate performance of the NOF-NCM electrode is far superior to that of the bulk Nb3O7F electrode. This improvement can be probably attributed to the novel advanced nanostructures with a large BET surface area of ∼111.4 m2 g−1 and favorable kinetic properties. To well explain such an improvement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technology was adopted. As exhibited in Fig. 5c, the obtained Nyquist plots of both the as-synthesized products are composed of an oblate semicircle in the high-frequency region (corresponding to charge-transfer resistance, Rct) and an inclined straight line in the low-frequency region (corresponding to the lithium diffusion process). Interestingly, the radius of the oblate semicircle for the NOF-NCM electrode is significantly smaller than that for the bulk Nb3O7F electrode. The above result demonstrates that the NOF-NCM electrode with a well-designed architecture possesses lower contacting and charge-transfer impedance than the bulk Nb3O7F electrode. Fig. 5d shows the cycling performances of the NOF-NCMs at 800 mA g−1. As shown in Fig. 5d, the NOF-NCM anode has a long cycle life up to the 3000th cycle with a large discharge capacity of ∼235.0 mAh g−1, corresponding to ∼88.3% of the 2nd cycle discharge capacity. Besides the high rate performance and cycling stability, the coulombic efficiency is also regarded as a critical parameter for the practical applications of lithium ion batteries. As seen in Fig. 5d, the coulombic efficiencies for the initial and second cycles are around 87.5% and 97.5%, respectively. More strikingly, the coulombic efficiency of the NOF-NCM electrode can be invariably stabilized at ∼100% with the exception of the first few cycles. This cycling stability may be caused by the unique microstructure stability of the NOF-NCMs. As seen in Fig. S8,† the microstructure of the NOF-NCM material can still maintain its nanowire cluster after finishing the cycling test, implying its high structural stability.

(e) Average potential comparison of the NOF-NCMs with other LIB anodes. (f) Capacity retention comparison of the NOF-NCMs with other LIB anodes. 
As shown in Fig. 5e and f, we also compared the NOF-NCMs with other state-of-the-art anode materials reported previously, including cube-like TiO2 mesocrystals,51 Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes,52 porous Nb2O5 microspheres,53 “nano-pearl-string” TiNb2O7 nanofibers,54 porous LiNb3O8 nanofibers,55 Fe3O4 nanowires,56 triple-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres,57 porous MoO3 films,58 MoS2 nanotubes,59 and porous SnO2 hollow microspheres.60 The detailed information is also listed in Table S1 (seen in the ESI†). Note that all the obtained data are presented as approximate values. It can be observed in Fig. 5e and f that the NOF-NCMs possess a higher capacity and better capacity retention than the first five anode materials. In particular, the NOF-NCMs show a higher capacity and much longer cycle life than cube-like TiO2 mesocrystals, which are also a typical kind of mesocrystal material. Moreover, a lower but safer average voltage of the NOF-NCM material makes it more suitable as a mesocrystal-type anode for high-voltage LIC devices. Although the NOF-NCMs present a lower capacity compared with Fe3O4, α-Fe2O3, MoO3, MoS2 and SnO2, the NOF-NCMs display a longer cycle life. Therefore, we conclude that the NOF-NCMs should be one of the potentially promising anode materials for LICs.
3.4 Li storage mechanism
To easier comprehend the Li de/intercalation mechanism of the NOF-NCMs electrode, an ex situ XRD measurement (Fig. 6a) was performed. Notably, ex situ XRD measurement could be conducted at the point of the final state of the discharging/charging process. In Fig. 6a, the initial sample is a powder sample while the other samples are all electrode samples. For the 250th cycle, some of the feature peaks of NOF can be observed. However, most of the feature peaks of NOF disappeared, implying that some crystalline phases are transformed into amorphous phases. As exhibited in Fig. 6b, the (110) crystalline plane of NOF can be detected and the amorphous phase of NOF can also be observed, which are in good agreement with the XRD data. All these results demonstrate that the first 250 cycles of the charging/discharging process are a process of gradual amorphization. For the 500th cycle, all of the feature peaks of NOF disappeared (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the HRTEM image and inserted SAED pattern both demonstrate that the crystalline phase is almost non-existent and only the amorphous phase exists. These results imply that the amorphization process is almost fully completed after 500 cycles. Combined with the as-mentioned electrochemical data analysis (Fig. 5d), the Li storage mechanism can be considered as the synergism of the SEI formation and amorphization process. According to previous reports, for Nb-based materials, a conversion reaction which occurs at a low potential (typically <1 V) can lead to the formation of an amorphous phase.61–63 Such an amorphization process caused by the conversion reaction can also explain the high capacity of the NOF-NCMs. Based on this, we propose some feasible conversion reactions, which are shown in Table S2.†Fig. 6c shows a schematic illustration of the Li storage behaviour in the NOF-NCMs electrode. In general, the Li storage behaviour can be divided into two stages: 1) a gradual amorphization process: in this stage, the co-existence of the SEI, amorphous phase, and crystalline phase can be observed; 2) a complete amorphization process: in this stage, only the SEI and amorphous phase can be found.

3.5 Construction and application of the NOF-NCMs//AC LIC
To fabricate a LIC device (schematically illustrated in Fig. 7a), the pre-lithiated NOF-NCMs and AC are adopted as the anode and cathode, respectively. To our knowledge, optimizing the voltage windows of the full cell is one key to obtain a high-performance LIC device. The electrochemical properties of commercial AC were investigated, which are shown in Fig. S9.† As displayed in Fig. 7b, the theoretical limit range of the full-cell voltage window is confirmed to be 0–4.5 V. In consideration to the average potential of the NOF-NCM electrode, the voltage window of the full cell can be more practically feasible at 0–4.0 V. As shown in Fig. 7c, the voltage window of 0–3.5 V shows the minimum electrode polarization. This implies that the voltage window of 0–3.5 V is reasonable and suitable for the NOF-NCMs//AC LIC system. Fig. 7d and S10† show the CV curves at different scan rates. Interestingly, the unique semi-rectangular shape of the CV curves can be observed owing to the synergistic effect of the fast faradaic Li+ insertion reaction and rapid non-faradaic ion adsorption/desorption process. Furthermore, as displayed in Fig. 7e and S11,† the GCD curves of the NOF-NCMs//AC LIC also exhibit symmetric triangular-like shapes, which well correspond to the phenomenon in the CV curves. According to our previous report, the energy density and power density can be calculated from the following equations:30,33,64,65 (8) P = E/t = ΔV × (I/m)(9) ΔV = (V2 + V1)/2(10)where I stands for the charge–discharge current; m is the total active-materials of the anode and cathode; t refers to the discharge time; V1 and V2 are the initial and final voltage of a charge curve. Using the given equations, the maximum energy density of the NOF-NCMs//AC LIC is calculated to be 74.5 W h kg−1 at 87.5 W kg−1 (0.05 A g−1). Even at a high power density of 8750 W kg−1 (5 A g−1), such a LIC device can keep an energy density of 20.4 W h kg−1. The detailed energy–power relationship is clearly displayed in the Ragone plot (Fig. 7f). As clearly displayed in the Ragone plot, the as-constructed NOF-NCMs//AC full cell has a superior energy density to LTO-G//AC (50 W h kg−1),66 TiO2-rGO//AC (50 W h kg−1),67 TiO2-B//AC (23 W h kg−1),68 T-Nb2O5@C NCs//AC (63 W h kg−1),69 and TiNb2O7//AC (43 W h kg−1).70 Besides, a high capacity retention of 92.5% can be realized at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, revealing the outstanding cycleability (Fig. 7g). As is well known, the self-discharge rate can be considered as a significant parameter for evaluating the electrochemical performances of LIC devices. As illustrated in Fig. 7h, the as-fabricated NOF-NCMs//AC LIC holds an initial circuit voltage of ∼2.722 V and can maintain ∼2.664 V after 24 h, indicating an extremely low self-discharge rate of ∼0.0024 V per hour. As a demonstration (inset in Fig. 7h), two NOF-NCMs//AC LIC full cells connected in series can normally light an LED lamp device. The NOF-NCMs//AC LIC having a high energy/power density and long lifespan can satisfy the prospective needs of new generation electrochemical energy storage devices, which can bridge the gap between batteries and supercapacitors.

4. Conclusions
In summary, highly-ordered NOF-NCMs were successfully synthesized by a facile one-step self-assembly solvothermal route. The formation mechanism was proved to be the synergistic effect of the etching action of HF and the aggregation process of nanowires driven by interparticle forces. Owing to the unique nanostructures possessing a large specific area and favorable kinetic properties, the as-prepared NOF-NCMs display outstanding electrochemical properties, exhibiting a high capacity of ∼356.7 mAh g−1 and excellent rate performance. Moreover, the NOF-NCMs also show an outstanding cycling performance, exhibiting ∼88.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 800 mA g−1. All these findings demonstrate that the NOF-NCM materials can be one of the potentially promising anode materials for high power LIC systems. The lithium ion storage of the NOF-NCMs is also studied by ex situ XRD and HRTEM technologies. As a result, the Li storage mechanism can be considered as the synergism of the SEI formation and amorphization process. When adopting the NOF-NCMs as the anode and AC as the cathode, the LIC full cell can be fabricated with a voltage window of 0–3.5 V. With an optimizable voltage window, the NOF-NCMs//AC LIC can exhibit a high energy/power density, low self-discharge rate and long cycling life.
