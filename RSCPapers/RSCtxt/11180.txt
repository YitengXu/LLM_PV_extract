    , Accepted 15th October 2022First published on 20th October 2022AbstractH2O2 is a green and clean oxidant. On-site H2O2 generation is a cost-effective process for long-term and full-scale water remediation without a need for transportation and storage of commercial H2O2. Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (PHP) in water merely needs water and oxygen as starting materials to generate H2O2, accompanied by conversion and storage of solar energy. Therefore, the on-site PHP process in water could be a cost-effective and environment-friendly route for water remediation. First, the most recent advances in photocatalysts toward non-sacrificial PHP in water are discussed, and the strategies for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance are elaborated. Then, an on-site PHP-enabled water remediation system is proposed. Finally, this article discusses the challenges and outlooks of the promising on-site PHP-based H2O2 generation system for water remediation.

Water impact
On-site H2O2 generation is a cost-effective process for long-term and large-scale water remediation without regard to H2O2 storage and transportation. The photocatalytic H2O2 production (PHP) is one of the most promising routes to produce H2O2 on-site, benefiting from the conversion of solar to chemical energy, flexible scalability, and high safety. Our work is expected to spark the ensuing technology investigation and development of PHP for water remediation.

Introduction
Artificial photosynthesis is the holy grail of sustainability to enable the conversion of solar energy into beneficial chemicals and fuels. Since the pioneering work of water photoelectrolysis reported by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,1 numerous high-value chemicals, such as H2, H2O2, NH3, and hydrocarbons, have been successfully photosynthesized from earth-abundant resources, e.g., H2O, CO2 and N2, using semiconducting materials under environmentally benign conditions.2–16 Very recently, the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (PHP) has attracted enormous attention because H2O2 is not only a high-energy chemical for solar energy storage and conversion but also a high-efficiency and green oxidant for environmental remediation.17–21
Hydrogen peroxide is a green and versatile environmental remediation reagent with a strong oxidative ability for water pollutants and a safe final product (i.e., water). Once activated, H2O2 can be transformed into more active species such as hydroxyl radicals.22 For example, as one of the classical Fenton's reagents, H2O2 in the presence of ferrous ions can be decomposed into hydroxyl radicals that possess superior capacity for degrading almost all the organic pollutants in water without producing any residues.23,24 In this scenario, such a unique feature distinguishes H2O2 from many conventional oxidants such as chlorine, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), and potassium permanganate (KMnO4). However, high-concentration H2O2 storage and transportation are expensive and inconvenient, severely increasing the operational costs of water remediation.
On-site H2O2 generation is a feasible route for long-term and large-scale water remediation to significantly mitigate the risks and costs of H2O2 storage and transportation. Nowadays, H2, zero-valent metals and ferrous iron species have been extensively explored as the oxygen reduction chemicals for on-site H2O2 generation.21 Meanwhile, numerous electrochemical catalysts categorized as carbon-based materials, metals, metal oxides and metal alloys have exhibited catalytic activity of H2O2 generation.25 Extensive chemicals and energy are consumed in this on-site H2O2 process. The catalysts favor working in acidic electrolytes rather than in basic ones during electrocatalysis of H2O2, indicating that inconvenience including the separation of H2O2 formed and electrolytes exists for environmental application.26
PHP in water is an economical and sustainable route driven by sunlight irradiation to produce H2O2 directly from water and O2via a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on photocatalysts (e.g. TiO2 and g-C3N4). The concept of PHP in water was first proposed by Shiraishi et al. in 2014,27 using pyromellitic diimide (PDI) modified g-C3N4 (g-C3N4/PDI) as the sunlight-driven photocatalyst to greatly increase the selectivity of the two-electron ORR up to 90%. The attractive findings later led to synthesis of various other photocatalysts (Fig. 1). By compositing with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to enhance charge separation, the solar-to-chemical energy conversion (SCC) efficiency of g-C3N4/PDI was further improved to 0.2%, comparable to the highest level of powdered water-splitting photocatalysts, i.e. (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) and Ru–SrTiO3:Rh/BiVO4, under AM1.5 simulated sunlight (1 sun).28–31 Resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resins are a new type of metal-free photocatalyst promoting the SCC efficiency of PHP in water to 0.5%, 5 times higher than that of photosynthetic plants (∼0.1%).32 Doping polythiophene in RF resins further boosts the SCC efficiency of PHP in water to 1.0% and the production rate of H2O2 to 2.5 mM h−1. Using photocatalysts with a low band gap and high efficiency, the PHP process is rather eco-friendly. For example, Zhao et al.33 have reported that the minimum selling price of H2O2 produced by the PHP process in a basic scenario (the band gap of the photocatalyst is 2.3 eV and the overall efficiency is 30%) is lower than the market price.
 Fig. 1  A brief timeline of the advances in photocatalysts toward PHP in water. 
Currently, in situ PHP has been explored for water remediation. The disinfection performance of in situ PHP was confirmed. TiO2/graphene-based nanocomposites were reported in 2017 as in situ H2O2 generation photocatalysts for inactivating Escherichia coli during water disinfection.34,35 Furthermore, the photocatalyst AuPd/TiO2 with an ability to generate oxygen-based species (e.g., hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl, and superoxide radicals) is more efficient by 107 and 108 times than H2O2 and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) at equivalent doses, respectively, in terms of bacteria inactivation. Ye et al.36 revealed the satisfactory performance of PHP in a water process for wastewater restoration in the laboratory. Moreover, other semiconductor nanocomposites such as Mn3O4/Co9S8, CdSe/Se/BiOBr and FeS2/RF have been designed as in situ H2O2 generation photocatalysts for the removal of various organic pollutants.37–39
Although H2O2 is produced on-site, this aforementioned PHP process adopted for water remediation can be regarded as in situ photocatalytic oxidation, in which the pollutants are mixed with the photocatalysts in the contaminated water. Another classic in situ photocatalytic oxidation process has been widely studied, during which the ˙OH formed from the oxidation of OH− by the h+ on the valence band of photocatalysts is an active species to the degradation of pollutants.40 But the quantum yields of ˙OH production during in situ photocatalytic oxidation are rather low owing to the low visible light utilization and selectivity of photocatalysts.40 Of note, the transmission of solar light in water in the presence of impurities is low and the active sites of photocatalysts would be shielded by pollutants during in situ photocatalytic oxidation. Likely, the performance of the in situ PHP process for water remediation can be challenging.
Here we propose an on-site PHP-based solution to water remediation with unique advantages (Fig. 2). First, only earth-abundant water and oxygen are the feedstocks for the solar light driven-PHP process in water, which offers an environmental and economic friendly route to produce H2O2 on-site. Second, different from the electrochemical route with a reliance on electrolytes, the on-site PHP process in water directly generates H2O2 in the aqueous solution that can straightforwardly be used without any redundant separation and purification process. Third, PHP in water can surmount the aforementioned challenges of conventional photocatalytic oxidation, that is, the fact that the pollutants are separated from the photocatalysts and degraded homogeneously by the H2O2 produced on-site. To date, PHP photocatalysts and their environmental applications have been intensively investigated and systematically summarized, yet most of the PHP processes involve sacrificial reagents and acids for better PHP efficiencies.41 It is crucial that these chemical additives are technically or economically difficult to separate from the PHP resultant H2O2 solutions. Consequently, this additive-involved PHP process is inapplicable to practical on-site water remediation. In this critical review, we discuss the most recent advances in photocatalysts toward PHP in water (non-sacrificial), elaborate different photocatalysts and their improvement strategies, and propose an on-site PHP-enabled water remediation system. Besides the current status of PHP in water, this review further assesses challenges and discusses future research needs of the on-site PHP system for in situ water remediation.

1. Recent advances in photocatalysts toward PHP in water
1.1 The process of PHP in water
A PHP process in water typically comprises sunlight harvesting, the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, and oxygen reduction (Fig. 2). At the onset, semiconductor photocatalysts absorb sunlight to generate photo-excited electrons (e−) and holes (h+) in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively. To ensure that this process is able to make it, enough photon energy should be provided for electrons to overcome the band gaps of photocatalysts. Then, these photo-generated e–h pairs are separated before migration to the photocatalyst surface, though some of these e–h pairs are lost due to recombination to liberate heat. Thereafter, H2O is oxidized into O2 and protons by h+ in the valence band (eqn (1)). As shown in Fig. 2, dissolved O2 is reduced into H2O2 by e− in the conduction band via a highly selective two-electron pathway, which is generally viewed as an indirect sequential two-step single-electron reduction route (eqn (2)–(5)) or a direct one-step two-electron reduction route (eqn (6)). Therefore, the overall PHP process can be summarized as eqn (7), with a positive Gibbs free energy change of 117 kJ mol−1. Recently, some different mechanisms of H2O2 generation have emerged with the rapid development in photocatalytic materials toward PHP. For instance, a new two-electron water oxidation pathway was discovered during PHP using functionalized covalent triazines as photocatalysts.42,43 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+(1) O2 + e− → O2˙−(2) O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙−(3) HO2˙− + e− → HO2−(4) HO2− + H+ → H2O2(5) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2(6) (7)Using sacrificial reagents (e.g., methanol and isopropanol) can accelerate the kinetic rate of H2O2 formation during the PHP process. The sacrificial reagents can consume the photogenerated holes on the photocatalyst surface, thus effectively suppressing the e–h pair recombination.44 Furthermore, electrons would be generated when the sacrificial reagents are oxidized by photogenerated holes, to benefit the oxygen reduction to form H2O2. However, the removal of these sacrificial reagents and their degradation products from the aqueous H2O2 solution remains challenging. The performance of PHP in water is low enough for water remediation, and the products can be dosed directly into the contaminated water. In this case, an on-site PHP process without the addition of sacrificial reagents is rather suitable for water remediation. To promote the development of the PHP process and create a promising water remediation technology, the advances in the non-sacrificial PHP process in water are reviewed.
1.2 Photocatalysts toward PHP in water
Photocatalysts dominate the H2O2 productivity and energy conversion efficiency of the PHP process. Numerous semiconductors have been exploited as PHP photocatalysts in water, among which titanium dioxide (TiO2) and graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) have been intensively investigated. Pure TiO2 is a robust inorganic photocatalyst which is responsible for UV-light absorption, while doping TiO2 exhibits excellent visible-light absorption behavior which is suitable for PHP in pure water under solar irradiation. As the representative carbon-based photocatalyst, g-C3N4 has great potential for PHP in pure water due to its strong visible-light response. Similar to TiO2, many other inorganic semiconductors such as metal oxides and metal sulfides are also utilized in photocatalytic nanocomposite materials to facilitate visible light absorption and charge generation and separation. Besides them, novel catalysts with competitive advantages in material design and synthesis, such as resins, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), have recently been attempted to enable PHP in water. Detailed data of photocatalysts enabling PHP in water are presented in Table 1.

1.2.1 TiO2. 
Titanium dioxide is a classic photocatalytic material with a long and comprehensive history in the energy and environmental disciplines for water splitting for H2 production, CO2 reduction, oxygen reduction for H2O2 production and pollutant degradation in water treatment.45–50 As shown in Fig. 3c, the lower-edge position of the TiO2 conduction band is −0.19 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 0, favoring the 2e− O2 reduction reaction to generate H2O2 (0.68 V). However, the lower-edge position of the TiO2 conduction band is more negative than the potential of H2 evolution, indicating that H2 evolution is a competitive side reaction accompanied by the PHP in water. Second, the band gap of TiO2 is ∼3.2 eV, corresponding to the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light with the wavelength <387 nm, suggesting that, at a maximum, 4% of the solar energy is theoretically available for the H2O2 generation.51 Third, Ti–OH groups on the TiO2 surface can decompose the photogenerated H2O2 to form Ti–OOH complexes. The complexes sequentially consume PHP-generated protons and electrons and suppress the 2e− O2 reduction reaction.52 Therefore, trace H2O2 forms from the PHP in TiO2 photocatalyzed water.53

Surface modification is an effective way to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. Noble metals, carbon dots and conjugated polymers have been utilized as surface tuning materials to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, particularly during the PHP process in water. Loading Au and Ag–Au bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) on TiO2 can form a Schottky barrier to accelerate e–h pair separation by transferring photoexcited electrons in the CB of TiO2 to noble metal NPs. Furthermore, loading rationally designed Au nanoparticles on TiO2 can promote visible light absorption through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).53,54 Based on the Au–TiO2 photocatalyst, more new photocatalysts with more complicated structures have been designed for further enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Nagamitsu et al.55 have introduced an ultrathin RuO2 heteroepitaxial layer on the TiO2 surface of Au–TiO2 to construct a three-component nanohybrid photocatalyst for PHP in water, with a higher photocatalytic activity in comparison with Au–TiO2 (Table 1). The photoexcited holes in the VB of TiO2 are injected into RuO2 through the heteroepitaxial junction between TiO2 and RuO2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the photoexcited electrons in the VB of TiO2 are accumulated in Au NPs (with a diameter ∼7.7 nm) for the generation of H2O2 (Fig. 4a). Teranishi et al.56 have decorated TiO2 with two kinds of Au NPs with bimodal size distribution to initiate PHP in water. The photoexcited electrons transfer from the small-sized Au NPs (with a diameter ∼2.3 nm) to the large-sized ones (with a diameter ∼10.6 nm) through the CB of TiO2 (Fig. 4b). Consequently, the Fermi energy of the small-sized Au NPs decreased, accompanied by the increase of the Fermi energy of the large-sized Au NPs, inducing the OER on the small-sized NPs and the ORR on the large-sized ones, separately. In addition, Au NPs preferentially adsorb H2O2 and catalyze H2O2 decomposition through the electron reduction reaction, resulting in a low H2O2 generation efficiency. The H2O2 decomposition is reported to be strongly associated with the catalyst sizes. For example, the H2O2 decay can be significantly suppressed at the diameter of Au NPs <3 nm or >8 nm.53

The Ti–OH groups on the TiO2 surface can catalyze H2O2 decomposition through the intermediary Ti–OOH groups during the photocatalytic process.41 Surface hybridization is an option to block the H2O2 decomposition pathway for improving the PHP efficiency. The use of copper, zinc, fluorine or carbonate ions capable of occupying the Ti–OH sites on the TiO2 surface via surface complexation can inhibit the formation of Ti–OOH groups.56–59 Besides surface complexation, Hong et al.60 have developed a hydrophobic conjugated polymer coating strategy to prevent the H2O2 decomposition on the TiO2 surface. Coating hydrophobic conjugated poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PFBT) on the TiO2 NPs allows for forming a heterojunction structure (PFBT/TiO2) absorbing the visible light region, rather than the UV region. The as-designed PFBT/TiO2 presents a relatively high H2O2 generation efficiency owing to the heterojunction-induced e–h pair separation and hydrophobicity-induced surface passivation. Moreover, fluorine-substitution can improve the hydrophobicity of PFBT, thus further enhancing the surface passivation to avert the consumption due to H2O2 degradation.
Besides TiO2 NPs, TiO2 nanotubes have also been utilized as photocatalysts for PHP in water. A protonated TiO2 nanotube/carbon dot nanocomposite photocatalyst has been synthesized by Ma et al.61 for the generation of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. Carbon dots deposited on TiO2 nanotubes extend the light absorption capacity of the photocatalysts to the visible-light region. The 2e− oxygen reduction reaction is accelerated by the acidic sites on TiO2 nanotubes for H2O2 generation, whereas the H2O2 decomposition reaction is passivated under irradiation.


1.2.2 g-C3N4. 
Graphite-like carbon nitride, a stacked two-dimensional metal-free photocatalytic material, has been recognized as a promising candidate for PHP in water due to its unique band structure and excellent physicochemical stabilities. As shown in Fig. 3c, the conduction band of g-C3N4 is −1.3 V versus NHE, desirable to the ORR (0.28 V versus NHE) for H2O2 generation. The band gap of g-C3N4 is 2.7 eV, corresponding to strong visible-light absorption. Therefore, the solar-driven production of H2O2 is facilitated. However, the valence band of g-C3N4 is 1.4 eV versus NHE (pH 7), which thermodynamically disfavors the water oxidation (0.8 V versus NHE). Apart from the band gap structure, the PHP performance of pristine g-C3N4 is fatally compromised by the low surface area, insufficient visible-light absorption, and fast recombination of photoexcited e–h pairs of g-C3N4. To address these issues, various material engineering methods, such as nanostructure design, defect control, doping, chemical modification and nano-hybridization, have been explored to synthesize better g-C3N4-based photocatalysts with complex nanostructures for enhancing the PHP process.
Chemical modification is a general method to improve the efficiency of PHP in water via tailoring the chemical structure of g-C3N4. Covalently combining electrophilic aromatic diimides with g-C3N4 can positively shift the VB and CB potentials of g-C3N4 due to their strong electron affinities. When pyromellitic diimide (PDI) is incorporated into g-C3N4, the VB potential of g-C3N4 positively shifts from 1.4 to 1.89 V versus Ag/AgCl (pH 6.6), facilitating the water oxidation reaction (WOR) in the valence band (Fig. 5a).27

In such a PDI-doped g-C3N4 catalyst, the photogenerated electrons and holes are both accumulated on g-C3N4. Therefore, their rapid recombination can severely impede the production of H2O2. Hybridization with two dimensional (2D) materials, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and boron nitride (BN), can further improve the photocatalytic activity of the PDI-doped g-C3N4.62 These 2D materials effectively accelerate the e–h pair separation, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to rGO for the selective 2e− ORR and simultaneous transfer of the photogenerated holes from the VB of g-C3N4 to BN for water oxidation (Fig. 5b). Different from doping PDI, doping biphenyl diimide (BDI) not only positively shifts the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 but also facilitates the charge separation by localizing photogenerated electrons and holes on the g-C3N4 and BDI units, respectively. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity is improved.66 Moreover, N-hydroxymethyl groups (–NH–CH2–OH) and polyethylenimine (PEI) have been introduced on g-C3N4 for efficient H2O2 generation. N-Hydroxymethylation of g-C3N4 significantly improves the H2O2 generation by accelerating H2O dehydrogenation and oxygen absorption on g-C3N4 without the change of the band-gap structure and morphology.67–69 Grafting PEI on g-C3N4 generates a unique intermolecular electronic interaction between cationic PEI chains and g-C3N4 nanosheets and thus promotes H2O2 generation via an effective separation route.68,69
Defect engineering is another effective strategy for improving the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 towards PHP in water by intrinsically regulating the band-gap structure, such as the band-gap width, charge carriers, and trap states. Zhang et al.63 have introduced –CN groups and nitrogen vacancies (N-vacancies) into g-C3N4 to form a dual defect site-modified g-C3N4-based photocatalyst (Fig. 5c). The electronic transition between N-vacancies and –CN groups significantly enhance the visible-light absorption and charge carrier separation. Moreover, N-vacancies accelerate the adsorption and activity of O2, while –CN groups enhance the adsorption of H+. Consequently, the two defect species work in synergy to improve the production of H2O2.
Besides chemical modification and defect engineering, a g-C3N4-based heterojunction has been architected as a photocatalyst for PHP in water. This route is enabled by improving the charge carrier separation and regulating the oxygen reduction pathway. Zhao et al.64 have covalently anchored polyoxometalate (POM) clusters on three dimensionally ordered macroporous g-C3N4via an organic linker to construct an inorganic–organic hybrid POM/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The heterostructured POM/g-C3N4 photocatalyst not only enhanced photoexcited e–h pair separation but also positively shifted the VB and CB potentials to 2.74 V and −0.04 V vs. NHE, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5d, the positively shifted CB potential is lower than the potential of 1e− O2 to ˙OOH (−0.13 V vs. NHE) yet higher than 2e− O2 to ˙OOH (0.69 V vs. NHE) with a sufficient potential difference (0.73 V), leading to the H2O2 generation via a highly selective 2e− ORR pathway. Moreover, the positively shifted VB potential facilitates the water oxidation reaction, while the narrowed band gap enhances visible-light absorption. Both steps promote the H2O2 generation under visible-light irradiation. Different from the POM/g-C3N4, a heterogeneous cobalt-containing POM/g-C3N4 photocatalyst has been also reported by Zhao et al.,70 with a negative shift of the CB potential to enhance the 1e− ORR and then form singlet oxygen. Meanwhile, constructing organic g-C3N4-based heterojunctions is another route to design efficient photocatalysts towards PHP in water. Ye et al.65 have combined boron-doped g-C3N4 with zinc polyphthalocyanine to form a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst for efficient PHP from water open to air (Fig. 5e). The difference between the Fermi levels of the two constituents is merely 0.019 eV, lower than that in the other g-C3N4-based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts. Of interest, such a small Fermi energy difference between the two constituents is responsible for a weak built-in electric field, which regulates the electron transfer direction by tuning the irradiation wavelengths (Fig. 5g).


1.2.3 D–A π-conjugated polymers. 
Organic π-conjugated polymers are promising photocatalysts to achieve a solar-to-chemical conversion.6 Introducing donor–acceptor (D–A) couples into the skeleton of π-conjugated polymers is an effective route to enhance the photocatalytic performance based on the excellent intramolecular charge transfer, because the strong electronic push–pull effect can promote the excitation dissociation, suppress the e–h pair recombination, and narrow the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital)–LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) band gap. High-temperature hydrothermal synthesized resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) resins have been developed as D–A conjugated photocatalysts for PHP in water with a remarkably high SCC efficiency of 0.5%.32 These RF resins composed of π-conjugated benzenoid and quinoid units can serve as electron D–A couples for charge separation (Fig. 3d). The π-stacking interaction of these D–A couples further hybridizes the HOMO–LUMO levels and lowers the band gap. Both significantly improve the SCC efficiency up to 0.5% over the PHP under simulated sunlight irradiation. Of note, these π-conjugated benzenoid–quinoid D–A couples in RF resins are methylene cross-linked, resulting in severe localization of π-orbitals and hindrance of charge transfer. A polythiophene derivative is doped into the RF resin powders as the conjugated conductive linker to connect the dissipated D–A couples. And charge band complexes are created between the HOMO of the dopant and the CB of RF resins, when the dopant donates electrons into the CB of RF resins (Fig. 6a).71 As the polythiophene-doping improves the photogenerated electron transfer, the charge separation in RF is enhanced to favor the occurrence of water oxidation and oxygen reduction. Subsequently, the SCC efficiency is raised to 1.0% under simulated sunlight irradiation.

Acid-catalysis for the synthesis of RF resins is another method to alleviate the resistance of methylene linkers.72 Acid-triggered polycondensation produces RF resins with a low degree of crosslinking and a high structural flexibility, resulting in an enhanced π-stacking interaction between or within the polymer chains, of which the band gap decreases with the increase of conductivity (Fig. 6g). Compared to base-catalyzed RF resins, acid-catalyzed RF resins exhibit excellent visible-light absorption and photocatalytic activity, with a SCC efficiency of 0.7% during PHP in water under simulated sunlight irradiation.


1.2.4 MOFs and COFs. 
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of hybrid materials composed of metal oxides and organic linkers. MOFs are typically characterized with a high specific surface area and a high chemical stability.73–76 Because of their distinctive properties, MOF-based photocatalysts have been developed for the solar-to-chemical conversion for different purposes, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, and H2O2 generation.77–81 As a subcategory of MOFs, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), e.g., ZIF-8 and ZIF-L, have been synthesized as photocatalysts for generating H2O2 from water and oxygen, yet the reactions barely occur under visible light irradiation due to their high band-gap energies.82 However, incorporating ZIF-8 and g-C3N4 to form heterogeneous photocatalyst ZIF-8/g-C3N4 can significantly enhance the efficiency of H2O2 generation from water and air.83 The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and the SCC efficiency of the heterogeneous ZIF-8/g-C3N4 are up to 19.57% (420 nm) and 0.58%, respectively, because the covalent bonds formed between ZIF-8 and g-C3N4 improve the visible-light absorbability.
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of non-metallic π-conjugated polymers with excellent visible-light responsivity, serving as ideal candidates for photocatalysis because of their tunable porosity and crystalline matrix.77,85–90 The highly ordered porosity provides a high specific surface area for the photoreaction, while the rigid π-conjugated skeleton favors charge separation and transportation, thereby facilitating the photocatalysis. Kou et al.43 have designed bipyridine-based COFs (Fig. 7a) for PHP from water and air with a SCC efficiency of 0.57% and 1.08% at 298 K and 333 K, respectively. The as-designed bipyridine-based COFs possess greater visible-light absorption capability and higher specific surface area than the pristine g-C3N4. Furthermore, following the protonation, the amine bonds in bipyridine units promote the 2e− WOR and then enrich oxygen adsorption to accelerate the 2e− ORR and improve H2O2 generation.

CTFs are porous and nitrogen-enriched organic framework materials with photocatalytic potential for solar-to-chemical conversion. The photocatalytic activity can be promoted by modulating the electronic structures and suppressing the charge recombination.91–94 Chen et al.84 have incorporated acetylene and diacetylene into the skeleton of CTFs for enhancing photocatalytic activities (Fig. 7c). The incorporated carbon–carbon triple bonds lower the VB potentials and narrowed the band gap, thus promoting water oxidation and visible-light absorption, respectively. Furthermore, integrating acetylene and diacetylene significantly suppresses the charge recombination to facilitate photocatalytic activities owing to their substantial HOMO contributions and coplanar conformation enhancement. Moreover, the blending of acetylene and diacetylene improves O2 adsorption and thus promotes H2O2 formation via a new pathway involving the 2e− WOR.

1.3 Strategies for photocatalyst design
The electronic structure of the photocatalyst, in particular the band edge position and band gap, is vital to the PHP in water. The VB and CB positions influence whether the potentials of photogenerated electrons and holes are sufficient to initiate the ORR and water oxidation, respectively, while the band gap energy is related to the light absorption wavelength. Doping, defect control and heterojunction formation are the widespread traditional band gap engineering techniques for modulating the electronic structures of photocatalysts. Doping and defect control are versatile tools to maneuver the band gap structures in photocatalysts, while building heterojunctions can assemble different semiconductors to form heterostructured photocatalysts with optimized band gap structures for effective charge separation. Besides the band gap engineering, nanostructure design and surface modification are useful alternatives. Rational nanostructure design can build complex nanostructures to improve the performance of photocatalysts. With advanced synthesis methods and nanoprocessing technologies, it can not only increase the specific surface area for enriching reaction sites but also extend the optical path length to enhance light absorption and utilization. Surface modification can regulate the crucial reactions such as oxygen reduction, water oxidation and H2O2 decomposition to improve the SCC efficiency. Here four strategies are spotlighted to improve the performance of photocatalysts, including doping atoms and vacancies for defect control, constructing heterojunctions, nanostructure engineering, and surface modification with cocatalysts.

1.3.1 Doping atoms and vacancies. 
Doping atoms is a common approach to modulate the electronic structures of photocatalysts by embedding heteroatoms into the photocatalyst structures, thereby significantly ameliorating optical properties and facilitating charge carrier transport.114 Thermal diffusion has been widely used to incorporate metal or nonmetal ions into inorganic photocatalysts for the substitution of elements at the lattice sites or insertion at the interstitial lattice sites, while covalent chemical modification has been employed for doping small organic molecules into π-conjugated polymers to modify the π-electronic system and band gap structure. Typically, the presence of dopants in wide band-gap inorganic photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2 and ZnO) brings about the impurity energy level and decreases the band gap energy, corresponding to a red shift in the spectral response towards the visible-light region.115,116 Doping nonmetal elements into metal sulfide photocatalysts (i.e., CdS) increases the valence band maximum, reduces the oxidative capacity of holes in the valence band, and thereby prevents the photo-corrosion and improves the chemical stability.109,117 Regarding π-conjugated polymers, heteroatom doping is a suitable modification method. For example, the element sulfur has been covalently bound to the CTF backbone to improve visible-light absorption, inhibit charge carrier recombination, and facilitate photoexcited e–h pair separation and transportation.118,119 As the most popular π-conjugated polymer, g-C3N4 has been doped with F, Br, I, N, P, O, S and B to improve the photoactivity by enhancing visible-light absorption, promoting charge transfer, and increasing surface area.120–122
The introduction of vacancies into semiconductor photocatalysts offers another way to electronic structure modulation for enhanced visible-light absorption and boosted charge carrier separation and transportation. Eliminating oxygen and sulfur atoms in the lattice of inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2 and ZnS) can form anion-based vacancies and correspondingly create coordinately unsaturated metal atoms where excess electrons are accumulated with a lower valence state.123,124 In addition to the vacancies in inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts, nitrogen and oxygen vacancies can also be formed by removing N and O atoms in the π-conjugated polymers (i.e., g-C3N4 and polyimide).63,125,126 These nitrogen and oxygen vacancies serve as trapping sites to inhibit charge carrier recombination and effectively extend the lifetime of charge carriers, thus enhancing the photoactivity of π-conjugated polymers. It is worth noting that the vacancies on the surface of photocatalysts are not only active sites for molecular adsorption and activation, but also the traps for localizing and stabilizing charge carriers. Carefully modulating the chemical properties and the density of vacancies on the surface of photocatalysts is an effective way to alter the subsequent photocatalysis pathways.


1.3.2 Constructing heterojunctions. 
Heterojunction engineering is a fascinating and viable approach to construct high-performance heterogeneous photocatalysts by coupling a series of semiconductor materials with different energy band structures.127
Three different heterojunctions can be formed at the interface between two connected semiconductors with different band-gap structures: straddling gap (type I), staggered gap (type II) and broken gap (type III). In type I heterojunctions, photogenerated holes and electrons accumulate on the same semiconductor (Fig. 8a), resulting in a high charge carrier recombination rate. By contrast, type II heterojunctions are able to spatially separate charge carriers. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons transfer to the lower CB level in semiconductor A, while holes transfer to the higher VB level in semiconductor B, thus effectively inhibiting charge carrier recombination (Fig. 8b). Different from type I and II heterojunctions, photogenerated holes and electrons poorly migrate in type III heterojunctions without overlapping band gaps between the two semiconductors (Fig. 8c). Under certain conditions, type III heterojunctions can be activated to type II heterojunction photocatalysts as solar energy conversion systems. For example, the type III heterojunction WO3−x/GdCrO3 can be converted to a type II heterojunction photocatalyst by introducing defect sites at the interface under photothermal conditions.128 The defect-band state W5/4+ at the interface of WO3−x serves as a bridge for migrating photothermal-generated hot electrons to capture the photogenerated holes at the VB of GdCrO3 without sacrificing of high photoredox potentials.
 Fig. 8  Scheme of the heterojunctions for PHP photocatalysts. a) Type-I. b) Type-II. c) Type-III. d) Z-scheme. e) Schottky barrier junction. f) P–n junction. 
It should be noted that the photogenerated holes and electrons in type I and type II heterojunction photocatalysts transfer to the high-potential VB and low-potential CB, respectively, compromising the redox abilities. Furthermore, the electrostatic repulsion impedes charge carrier transfer between type I and type II heterojunction photocatalysts and decreases efficiencies of charge carrier separation. Z-Scheme heterojunctions provide a new insight into the catalyst design by mimicking natural photosynthesis. As shown in Fig. 8d, the Z-scheme heterojunction consumes the electrons at the low-potential CB and the holes at the high-potential VB, while reserving the electrons at the high-potential CB and the holes at the low-potential VB. This results in efficient spatial separation of photogenerated holes and electrons to maintain strong redox abilities. Particularly, electrostatic attraction between the low-energy level electrons and holes favors the charge transfer in Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts, but electrostatic repulsion inhibits charge transfer in type I and type II heterojunction photocatalysts. Liao et al.129 have summarized the g-C3N4-based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for H2O2 production, including AgBr–Br–g-C3N4,130 Bi4O5Br2/g-C3N4,131 g-C3N4/WO3,113 g-C3N4/CuO,132 Cu2(OH)PO4/g-C3N4,98 and Cu2(OH)2CO3/g-C3N4.99 Other g-C3N4-based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts such as ZnO/g-C3N4,133 oxygen-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets/NaBiS2 (ref. 134) and TiO2/B-doped-g-C3N4 (ref. 135) have also been developed for H2O2 generation under visible-light irradiation. Different from these direct Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts, a Ag-containing ZnFe2O4/Ag3PO4 Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst has been designed for photocatalytic H2O2 production.136 Incorporating Ag between ZnFe2O4 and Ag3PO4 as the conductive channel facilitates charge carrier separation and transfer, while integrating Ag on ZnFe2O4 as the co-catalyst promotes H2O2 generation. Moreover, the ZnFe2O4/Ag3PO4 Z-scheme heterojunction significantly enhances the chemical stability of Ag3PO4.
Another type of heterojunction photocatalyst can be developed from the Schottky barrier junction between the metal and the semiconductor (Fig. 8e). In Schottky-like heterojunction photocatalysts, the photogenerated electrons are unilaterally conducted from the semiconductor with lower work functions to metals, leading to efficient spatial charge separation to resist charge carrier recombination. Furthermore, the coupling of noble metals, such as Ag, Au, and Pt, with semiconductors can further enhance visible-light absorption due to their unique surface plasmon resonance effects.53,137,138 Shiraishi et al.110 have constructed Au/BiVO4 heterogeneous photocatalysts for PHP in water. Loading Au NPs enhanced the visible-light absorption and 2e− ORR pathway selectivity and thus improved the photocatalytic performance. Non-noble metal containing Ti3C2 MXene has also been employed as a conductive component for constructing Schottky-like heterojunction photocatalysts for H2O2 generation.139 In Ti3C2/TiO2 nanocomposites, the photogenerated electrons migrate from the CB of TiO2 to conductive Ti3C2, resulting in the spatial separation of charge carriers. Furthermore, Ti3C2 layers also inhibit the formation of Ti–OOH on the surface of TiO2 and suppress H2O2 decomposition. Yang et al.140 have prepared Schottky-like Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts via electrostatic self-assembly. Driven by the built-in electric field originating from the Schottky junction, the photogenerated electrons migrate from the CB of g-C3N4 to Ti3C2 for the reduction of O2via a two-step single-electron pathway. A Ti3C2-based Schottky junction has also been introduced in the Z-scheme g-C3N4/BiOCl heterojunction system to form a Schottky functionalized Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst Ti2C3/g-C3N4/BiOCl.141 The interplay of Schottky and Z-scheme heterojunctions significantly enhances the charge carrier separation and subsequently promotes the ORR for the H2O2 formation. Different from the aforementioned heterojunction photocatalysts built on n-type semiconductors, p–n type heterojunction photocatalysts are composed of n-type and p-type semiconductors (Fig. 8f). Under irradiation, an internal electric field is formed on the interface between the two types of semiconductors, accelerating the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to the CB of the n-type semiconductor and the VB of the p-type semiconductor, respectively. Pal et al.142 have constructed a magnetic p–n heterojunction photocatalyst by precipitating p-type Ag2O on n-type Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The p–n heterojunction lowers the VB position of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thereafter formed a staggered band alignment for H2O2 generation under visible-light irradiation. Zhang et al.37 have reported a p–n heterojunction photocatalyst by compositing p-type Mn3O4 nanorods and n-type Co9S8 nanosheets. The electrons migrate from the CB of the p-type Mn3O4 to combine the holes in the VB of the n-type Co9S8 at the as-formed Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction interface, resulting in an efficient Z-scheme mechanism for charge carrier separation and transportation. Moreover, such a visible-light driven Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction photocatalyst produces H2O2 from water and ambient air via a two-channel pathway involving a major channel of the 2e− ORR on the surface of Co9S8 and an auxiliary channel of ˙OH combination on the surface of Mn3O4.


1.3.3 Nanostructure engineering. 
As a fascinating method to improve photocatalytic activity, rational nanostructure design can considerably support charge carrier separation, increase specific surface areas, and enrich active sites.143,144 Three-dimensional (3D) network carbon nitride aerogels and porous carbon nitride spheres have been bottom-up synthesized for the visible-light irradiation induced H2O2 production.112,145 Different from the bulk carbon nitride, these carbon nitride nanostructures provide great surface areas to separate charge carriers. Furthermore, elements, vacancies, and functional groups can be simultaneously introduced on the surface of these carbon nitride nanostructures during the synthesis process, serving as exciton traps and active sites for synergistically improving the photocatalytic activities. Moreover, an inverse-opal-structured g-C3N4 photocatalyst has been synthesized via a top-down hard-template method.146 The 3D ordered porous nanostructure built the light-harvesting capability with higher specific surface area and more reaction sites. Moreover, the intrinsic carbon vacancies electrostatically anchored Ti3C2 quantum dots to construct Schottky junctions for spatially separating charge carriers. As a consequence, photocatalytic activities were improved. Furthermore, rational nanostructure design can be applied for heterojunction photocatalysts. Kim et al.147 have reported a triphasic metal oxide photocatalyst for converting water and oxygen into H2O2 with high activity, stability and selectivity. A type II heterojunction was constructed from amorphous TiO2 and crystallized Fe3O4 with a core–shell morphology on Co2(OH)2CO3 nanosheets, corresponding to visible-to-UV light absorption. The photogenerated electrons at the CB of Fe3O4 travelled to the CB of TiO2 for selective oxygen reduction, whilst the photogenerated holes at the VB of TiO2 migrated to the VB of Fe3O4 and then further transferred to the VB of Co2(OH)2CO3 for water oxidation.


1.3.4 Cocatalyst decoration. 
Decorating cocatalysts on the surface of photocatalysts is a conventional but efficient way to improve the activities of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Cocatalysts can provide trapping sites for photogenerated charge carriers, thus promoting charge carrier separation while restraining charge carrier recombination. Such a charge carrier trapping effect can also extend the lifespan of holes to compensate for the sluggish surface reaction kinetic behaviors. Furthermore, cocatalysts can reduce the activation energy to accelerate the oxidation and reduction reactions. Cobalt phosphate (CoPi) is an efficient water oxidation catalyst to enhance oxygen evolution in many photocatalytic semiconductor systems. Moon et al.148 have introduced CoPi on reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 composites to significantly reduce the overpotential of the water oxidation reaction. Liu et al.111 have investigated the effects of loading cocatalysts on different facets of Mo-doped BiVO4. Loading CoOx on the oxidative facet promoted the water oxidation kinetics, while loading Pd on the reductive facet regulated the ORR from the 4e− route to the 2e− pathway for H2O2 generation. Furthermore, the cocatalysts of CoOx and Pd are deposited on the oxidative and reductive facets, respectively, facilitating spatial separation of charge carriers.
It should be noted that single-atom catalysis has emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to its extremely high atomic utilization efficiency as well as exceptional catalytic activity, selectivity and stability.149–151 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can be viewed as exotic atoms individually dispersed on or embedded into the surface of appropriate substrates. Paring SACs with photocatalysts is an attractive approach to steer the reaction direction and thus govern the overall reaction kinetics.152,153 Chu et al.107 have reported a high-efficiency 2D g-C3N4-based photocatalyst that coordinated cobalt single atoms above the void center of g-C3N4 and anchored anthraquinone at the edges of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Spatially separated cobalt single atoms and anthraquinone serve as the reaction sites for enhanced water oxidation and oxygen reduction, respectively. Of note, cobalt single atoms present competitive advantages over cobalt nanoparticles due to their atomic sizes permitting facile manipulation of loading sites via metal–ligand coordination. Teng et al.108 have loaded antimony single atoms on carbon nitride for photocatalytic H2O2 production from O2 and water. The Sb atoms accumulated electrons for the ORR in a 2e− pathway, while holes built up by the N atoms of carbon nitride adjacent to the Sb atoms for the WOR. The coherence greatly accelerates the overall kinetics of the H2O2 formation.

2. On-site PHP for water remediation
2.1 On-site PHP systems
Chemical oxidation is a viable method for removing contaminants from real-world environmental/field systems. H2O2 is a safe and efficient oxidant for water treatment. The use of H2O2 in water restoration is hampered by a costly and unsustainable synthesis procedure. In this situation, PHP in clean water provides a low-carbon and environmentally beneficial method of producing H2O2 that does not take much energy and produces almost little waste during the entire process. For example, the whole PHP system may be implemented in mobile or stationary stations along rivers for natural water remediation. Solar energy is a clean and sustainable energy source that might power PHP devices to manufacture H2O2 on-site without the hassle of storing and transporting huge dosages of H2O2. Rather than pricey chemicals, on-site PHP systems are fed with earth-abundant air and water. By using solar panels and wind turbines, solar and wind energy are captured and turned into electrical energy to power the entire system. The generated H2O2 can be stored in tanks or directly dumped into polluted natural water through pipelines for water treatment. Therefore, such an on-site PHP system could be a cost-effective and practical alternative for water cleanup.
The system consists of three units, that is, an energy supply, H2O2 production and storage, and water treatment (Fig. 9). In the part of energy supply, solar light can be utilized in a direct way for photosynthesizing H2O2via the PHP process. To overcome the intermittency and volatility of daily solar irradiation, we also suggest an indirect way as an alternative to convert solar energy into electrical power with photovoltaic (PV) panels, which is stored in batteries such as a battery energy storage system (BESS). Another advantage of the indirect way is that other renewable energy sources (especially wind) can be utilized as an energy supply substitute to drive the on-site PHP system for environmental remediation. Furthermore, the electricity generated from renewable energy can provide electrical power for the following processes such as water production, air pumping, and H2O2 production and storage. Using renewable energy can significantly reduce the energy consumption of on-site production of H2O2 and water remediation. The part of H2O2 production and storage contains water production, air purification, PHP in water, and H2O2 storage. Rainwater and other surface waters can be utilized as sources of water that are purified by filtration or reverse osmosis (RO). Filtration is also needed for preparation of purified air because suspended solids would interrupt visible-light transmission. Under visible-light irradiation, the purified air and water are converted into H2O2 on the surface of photocatalysts through the PHP route. As H2O2 reaches a certain concentration, the as-prepared stock solution would be separated from the photocatalyst and then transferred into the tank. In the part of water remediation, the H2O2 stock solution can be directly dosed into lakes and rivers, or injected into the subsurface for the remediation of polluted surface water and ground water.
 Fig. 9  Scheme of an on-site PHP system for water remediation. 
Separating hydrogen peroxide from the reaction solution is a challenge for the practical application of the on-site PHP process, because organic chemical reagents are usually used in some PHP processes as sacrificial agents in order to improve the performance of PHP. The produced H2O2 can be extracted using organic solvents (e.g. benzyl alcohol); however, this process is not suitable for water remediation because the hydrogen peroxide must be separated from the organic extractant before it can be introduced into the contaminated water.78 Furthermore, extracting H2O2 from organic extractants necessitates an energy-intensive distillation process, and H2O2 decomposes easily in this process because of high temperatures.154 Zhang et al. developed a facile photosynthesis–extraction–separation process for on-site PHP water contamination.154 Unlike traditional aqueous phase synthesis, hydrogen peroxide is synthesized via photocatalysis in a hydrophobic organic phase and then separated from organics via water extraction. Concurrently, an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution is generated, which can be used directly for on-site water treatment.155 The on-site PHP procedure we proposed in this work uses pure water as the reaction solvent and oxygen in air as the raw material, thus it is unnecessary to separate H2O2 from the reaction solvent. After convenient solid–liquid separation of the photocatalyst, the produced H2O2 aqueous solution can be readily used for water treatment, making it ideal for on-site PHP water contamination. When combined with UV irradiation, ozonation or heterogeneous Fenton catalysts during application, the H2O2 treatment can be easily upgraded to powerful AOPs.
2.2 Potential applications for water remediation

2.2.1 Wastewater treatment. 
An on-site PHP-enabled H2O2 generation system can produce fresh H2O2 capable of degrading various organic and inorganic pollutants and inactivating pathogens in water and wastewater due to its strong oxidation capability.23,156 The promising system can address different challenges in water pollution. One example is contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs), such as endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, perfluorinated compounds, microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes, which can induce profound impacts on the public and ecological environment and thus pose a substantial pressure on water treatment plants.157–162 Traditional solutions such as pre-oxidation with KMnO4, NaClO, O3, and ferrate, membrane filtration and the ozone-biological activated carbon process have been explored to degrade EPOCs, yet these processes not only consume considerable energy but also cause secondary pollution (e.g., the formation of disinfection by-products).163–166 In contrast, the process of the on-site PHP system offers a more sustainable and economical alternative for the degradation of CECs in contaminated water.


2.2.2 Rainwater purification. 
Drainage pipes of wastewater or rainwater are another significant collection sites besides wastewater treatment plants for various pollutants (conventional pollutants, emerging pollutants and critical pollutants) in solid, liquid and gaseous phases that come from various sources, which also provides a perfect application scenario for on-site PHP. H2O2 could not only be introduced into the drainage pipes as a green oxidant to degrade pollutants, but could also be used in combination with coagulants to purify combined sewer overflow (CSO) in drainage pipes and reduce secondary risk, because CSO is an important environmental source of hormones and wastewater micropollutants.167,168


2.2.3 Disinfection. 
Disinfection is of great significance to inactivate waterborne pathogens in drinking water, preventing people from diarrhea, malaria, and many other waterborne pathogen caused diseases. The traditional disinfection process with a heavy reliance on chlorine disinfectants (i.e., NaClO and chloramine) is compromised by the balance between the mitigation of acute risks from waterborne pathogens and long-term exposure to the formation of undesirable carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic disinfection by-products (DBPs).169–171 Moreover, these chlorine disinfectants have limited effects on inhibiting the formation of microbial biofilms in the drinking water pipe network, which is viewed as one of the greatest challenges in the water supply infrastructure.172,173 However, the on-site PHP system provides a potential solution, because hydrogen peroxide is a strong alternative for chlorine-based disinfectants. It can not only abate the pathogen-induced risk, but can also minimize the production of chlorine disinfectant-triggered DBPs. Therefore, the use of H2O2 for water disinfection provides a promising way to surmount one of the most challenging issues in water treatment processes. Meanwhile, H2O2 can offer a promising disinfection effect in a water distribution system to destroy the bacterial cell structure and interfere with the formation of microbial biofilms.174 The on-site PHP system can provide fresh H2O2 as the disinfectant for improving the quality of drinking water in a municipal or rural drinking-water supply system.


2.2.4 Natural water remediation. 
When surface water bodies (e.g., river and lake) receive substantial oxygen demanding materials (e.g., untreated sewage) or considerable nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater discharge or storm water runoff, dissolved oxygen tends to be depleted, eventually making odorous black water. Discharging fresh H2O2 aqueous solution into the polluted surface water can degrade unwanted pollutants and increase dissolved oxygen from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, discharging fresh H2O2 aqueous solution into underground water can degrade the pollutants without inducing secondary pollution.175 Therefore, the on-site PHP system has great potential for the purification and restoration of both surface water and underground water.

3. Conclusion
PHP in water provides a green, low-carbon and eco-friendly alternative for on-site H2O2 generation and presents potential applications to in situ water remediation. However, challenges remain in application of the PHP in the next-generation water treatment. First, though various PHP photocatalysts have been developed to produce sufficiently high H2O2 concentration for practical water remediation, the SCC efficiency and the H2O2 yield remain low. Rational design of PHP photocatalysts is a plausible solution to this issue, as discussed in section 2.3. Second, another concern is the technical difficulty in stable and mass production of PHP photocatalysts. Otherwise, the material costs are high to disfavor industrial acceptance of the on-site PHP process. Third, because the PHP process is a heterogeneous system involving the three phases solid, liquid, and gas, the process development and optimization are challenging in different aspects, such as mass transfer and temperature control.
On-site PHP systems for water remediation will be explored in laboratory and pilot scale studies before stepping into full-scale applications. Given that many PHP photocatalysts are available, laboratory-scale demonstration studies are encouraged for evaluation of technical feasibility for on-site PHP-based water remediation systems. To achieve viable H2O2 production, the introduction of a BESS unit into the demonstration system is needed to address the volatility and intermittency problems of renewable energy. The BESS unit serves as an energy transfer station with a dual function. First, it is a reservoir of the generated electricity. Second, despite the instability in the input electricity, the unit can ensure a steady electricity output. The investigation on the energy conversion and transport plays a key role in the success of the demonstration studies for the process development and optimization in terms of energy consumption and water remediation.
Water is the source of all lives, yet human activity resultant pollution has become a global issue for water safety and security. Developing sustainable water remediation technologies is an answer to this challenge. Here we propose that a PHP-enabled H2O2 system can serve as a potential solution to broad-spectrum pollution issues in natural and engineered water systems, such as wastewater treatment, CSO pollution control, water disinfection, restoration of rivers and lakes, groundwater remediation, and storm water treatment. Besides, a potential benefit of the proposed technology is its low costs due to the use of renewable energy and the saved expenses in chemical transport and storage, thereby fostering the market acceptance in both developed and developing countries. Therefore, these unique features allow on-site PHP-based water remediation processes to be among the next-generation water treatment technologies.

Water impact
On-site H2O2 generation is a cost-effective process for long-term and large-scale water remediation without regard to H2O2 storage and transportation. The photocatalytic H2O2 production (PHP) is one of the most promising routes to produce H2O2 on-site, benefiting from the conversion of solar to chemical energy, flexible scalability, and high safety. Our work is expected to spark the ensuing technology investigation and development of PHP for water remediation.
