    , Accepted 6th October 2022First published on 7th October 2022AbstractSynthesizing high-quality films with superior morphological, electrical, and defect properties is the basic requirement for obtaining high-efficiency solar cells. Recently, Sb2Se3 has been the emerging photovoltaic material with a low-symmetry crystal structure and complicated defect properties, giving a unique synthesis challenge for high-performance solar devices. In this work, we developed a novel additive-assisted chemical bath deposition (CBD) technology for producing ideal antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) films using antimony potassium tartrate and sodium selenosulfate as antimony and selenide sources, respectively, with thiourea and selenourea as additives to manipulate the deposition process. We uncover that additive regulated deposition kinetics is essential to improve the film properties. Comprehensively, the physical properties of Sb2Se3 films in terms of morphology, crystallinity, carrier transport properties, and defect density have been significantly enhanced. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency of 10.57% in Sb2Se3 solar cells, which represents the highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells, regardless of the fabrication methods and device structures. Given the scalability to large area production and the low-cost fabrication characteristics of the CBD technique, this study demonstrates not only an effective and implementable method for fabricating highly efficient Sb2Se3 solar cells but also paves the way for industrial production of large-area Sb2Se3 photovoltaic panels in the future.

Broader context
As a kind of new photovoltaic material, antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has attracted attention due to its excellent stability and suitable photovoltaic parameters. As everything has two sides, its disadvantages cannot be ignored; a low-symmetry crystal structure and complicated defect properties are its unique synthesis challenges for high-performance solar devices. Up to now, it is still critical to enhancing efficiency as well as achieving fundamental understanding. Herein, we establish a novel additive-assisted chemical bath deposition (CBD) technology for synthesizing Sb2Se3 films, where the kinetics of the reaction during the deposition process can be elaborately regulated via the use of additives. Mechanistic studies show that the improvement of film quality can be observed from the morphology, crystallinity, and chemical purity through the introduction of additives. Meanwhile, the use of additives significantly suppresses the defect states, which is conducive to improving the efficient extraction and transport of photogenerated carriers as well as reducing the nonradiative recombination of the Sb2Se3 films. Consequently, the additive-based Sb2Se3 device presents an excellent PCE of 10.57%, which has been the highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells to date.

Introduction
The quest to meet the increasing demand for energy storage devices and to develop low-cost, clean, and renewable energy sources drives the development of emerging photovoltaic technologies. Thin-film solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS),1 CdTe,2 GaAs,3 and other inorganic materials have received considerable attention and led to tremendous progress because of their excellent photoelectric characteristics. However, the high price of In and Ga, the toxicity of Cd, and the scarcity of Te reserves may limit their large-scale use. In this context, earth-abundant and non-toxic antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has been considered an alternative photovoltaic material with growing interest due to its superior photoelectric features, including a high absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) in the visible region, a suitable band gap (1.1–1.3 eV), a simple binary composition, and excellent stability.4–7 Being an emerging solar material, developing a suitable method for the synthesis of high-quality Sb2Se3 films with a compact morphology, a large grain size, optimal photoelectrical and defect properties plays a critical role in the final device efficiency improvement. To this end, various film deposition methods have been implemented for the synthesis of Sb2Se3 films, including thermal evaporation (TE),8 rapid thermal evaporation (RTE),4,9 vapor transport deposition (VTD),10–12 co-evaporation (Co-eva),13,14 close-spaced sublimation (CSS),3,15,16 injection vapor deposition (IVD),17 magnetron sputtering deposition (MSD),18–20 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),21 low-temperature pulsed electron deposition technique (LT-PED),22 electrodeposition,23 chemical bath deposition (CBD),24 spin coating,5,25,26 and hydrothermal deposition (HD).27 Most of these methods have led to efficiencies of 7–9%.
Among the above methods, CBD has been demonstrated to be a successful technology capable of creating high-quality semiconductor thin films for both laboratory and industrial applications.28,29 The reactions in CBD take place in solution under mild conditions, allowing for better control of the reaction rate and nucleation process. The dissolved reactants involved in CBD, on the other hand, are ionic rather than atomic, which aids in the formation of a relatively smooth and uniform film morphology. Encouraging results have been obtained using chalcogenide thin films prepared by CBD,30,31 for example, the CBD method has enabled to achieve a PCE of 7.5%32 in Sb2S3 solar cells in 2014, which remains the champion efficiency for Sb2S3 solar cells so far. Furthermore, in comparison to the vacuum method usually involving a high-cost vacuum apparatus, CBD is an economic approach for large-scale film fabrication. However, there are only a few reports on the synthesis of Sb2Se3 films using the CBD technique, and the obtained films are mostly amorphous.33–36 Until now, Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CBD method exhibited a PCE of only 0.13%. It may be ascribed to the lack of understanding of the complicated chemical reactions that occur during the Sb2Se3 film deposition process in CBD, which is critical to manipulating the internal reaction process in order to achieve uniform compactness and good crystallinity with low defect density. This situation calls for a new design of the CBD process for high-efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cell fabrication.
Herein, we demonstrate a novel additive-assisted CBD technology with new reaction precursors for the fabrication of high-quality Sb2Se3 films, in which the kinetics of the reaction during the deposition process can be elaborately regulated by adding additives. Specifically, antimony potassium tartrate (APT) and sodium selenosulfate (SSS) were used as Sb and Se sources, respectively, with thiourea (TU) and selenourea (SU) being used as additives. The effects of regulated reaction kinetics on the physical characteristics of Sb2Se3 films in our newly developed CBD procedures are carefully investigated. Fundamentally, the employment of additives significantly improved the quality of CBD-fabricated Sb2Se3 films, including crystal grains, crystallinity, and chemical purity. Furthermore, the defect states are dramatically reduced, which aids in the effective extraction of carriers in the devices, leading to enhanced charge transport and reduced trap-assisted recombination. As a result of the abovementioned greatly improved film quality and photoelectrical properties, an efficiency of 10.57% was achieved in Sb2Se3 devices synthesized by using the SU-assisted CBD strategy, representing the highest PCE in Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of Sb2Se3 films
As described in the experimental section and Table S1 (ESI†), we applied APT and SSS as Sb and Se sources, respectively. TU and SU were employed as additives to regulate the reaction kinetics in the CBD-fabricated Sb2Se3 films (Supplementary Note 1, ESI†). In a typical film deposition process, the FTO/CdS substrate was immersed into the precursor solution in a reagent bottle, which was subsequently transferred to a thermostat water bath at 95 °C for 2 h. In the following discussion, the Sb2Se3 film without additives is denoted as control-Sb2Se3 and the Sb2Se3 films synthesized with TU and SU as additives are denoted as TU-Sb2Se3 and SU-Sb2Se3, respectively. The structures of the representative Sb2Se3 films were first examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1a, except for the three peaks (marked as ♠) of FTO and the two peaks (marked as ) of CdS, other diffraction peaks can be well-assigned to oriented orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (JCPDS No. 15-0861) in all samples, where the identical crystal phase indicates that the introduction of additives does not affect the crystallographic texture of the Sb2Se3 films. Remarkably, as analyzed from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values listed in Table S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1b, c, the SU-Sb2Se3 film exhibits superior crystallinity when compared to the films synthesized by CBD reported in the literature35,36 and the other two types of films in this work. This enhanced crystallinity is considered to be advantageous for improving photovoltaic performance.

The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for the Sb 3d region of all samples are presented in Fig. 1d. XPS well confirms the formation of Sb2Se3. We also observed additional peaks that originate from Sb–O in the Sb 3d spectrum at higher binding energies in all films. It is noticeable that the Sb–O peaks are reduced after the addition of TU or SU. By comparing the peak areas of Sb–O and Sb–Se (Fig. 1f and Table S3, ESI†), the content of oxides, respectively, decreased from 11.8% in the control-Sb2Se3 film to 2.7% and 2.1% in the TU-Sb2Se3 and SU-Sb2Se3 films in Sb 3d5/2, and 6.2% to 1.5% and 0.7% in Sb 3d3/2, respectively. In terms of the Se 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 1e), the peaks of each sample showed no significant differences in binding energy within all samples. The XRD and XPS results suggest that high-purity Sb2Se3 films were prepared especially with the SU additive.
Subsequently, the surface morphologies (Fig. 2a–c) of the as-fabricated Sb2Se3 films were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2d–f shows the histogram analysis of average grain sizes from the three films. The control-Sb2Se3 film had a thickness of ∼90 nm (Fig. S1a, ESI†) and consisted of small grains (170 nm), along with numerous pinholes (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2, ESI†). These pinholes might cause direct contact with the subsequently deposited hole transport layer, which would result in severe current leakage.37 When TU was incorporated in the CBD synthesis, the TU-Sb2Se3 film uniformly covered on the CdS substrate, with a thickness of about 170 nm (Fig. S1b, ESI†), and the average grain size increased to 290 nm. Furthermore, the introduction of SU induced an enhanced average grain size of 435 nm for SU-Sb2Se3 films, with a thickness of about 260 nm (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The compact surface and well-defined crystalline domains in the SU-Sb2Se3 film result in fewer grain boundaries (GBs), which will be conducive to improving the carrier collection and reducing the shunt pathways. The FWHM values of the XRD peaks (listed in Table S2, ESI† and Fig. 1b, c) for the SU-Sb2Se3 films are in excellent agreement with the results of SEM images as well. To minimize the influence of the film thickness on crystallinity and grain size, we investigated the correlations between the film thickness and deposition time of three films (Fig. S3, ESI†) and attempted to deposit the other two films with the same thickness as the SU-Sb2Se3 film. However, Fig. S2d and S3 (ESI†) show that the control-Sb2Se3 film with an increased thickness exhibits porous rod-like features and is loosely covered on the CdS substrate. For the TU-Sb2Se3 film, in addition to the increased film thickness, a longer reaction duration enlarged the grain size, while it still could not be comparable to that of the SU-Sb2Se3 film. The thicker TU-Sb2Se3 film, however, displays deteriorated crystalline quality as verified by the FWHM values (see Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Taken together, it can be concluded that the introduction of both SU and TU can improve the quality of Sb2Se3 films during CBD growth. Particularly, the incorporation of SU leads to an outstanding improvement in terms of the morphology and crystallinity of films. This enhancement is largely derived from the suppression of the formation of hydroxide compounds and the manipulation of reaction kinetics during the CBD process, which will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

Reaction and the deposition mechanism of Sb2Se3 films
On the basis of the above observation, we propose the synthesis mechanism of Sb2Se3 films as illustrated in Scheme 1. The detailed reaction equations of the CBD process are provided in Supplementary Note 2 (ESI†). In brief, at the beginning of the reaction, the hydrolysis of APT generates (SbO)+. In the alkaline medium introduced by the sodium selenosulfate (Na2SeSO3) solution, the reaction of (SbO)+ would undergo the following two paths: (I) reacting with Se precursors to form Sb2Se3 films and (II) producing antimony hydroxide SbO(OH) (or Sb(OH)3). In an alkaline environment, a significant amount of hydroxide generated via path (II) will act as the nucleation centers for the Sb2Se3 film.38 This deposition process results in an inhomogeneous film growth and might well explain that in the reaction system of APT + SSS, the control-Sb2Se3 film forms small grains with porous characteristics (Fig. S2, ESI†). The most common method of controlling the film's morphology could be the utilization of complexing agents to slow down the release of metal cations and in turn regulate the heterogeneous nucleation. According to Nieboer and Richardson, Sb(III) is classified as a borderline metal and thus interacts with both soft and hard ligands.39,40 A certain number of studies have demonstrated that Sb(III) can be complexed with a large series of oxygen- and sulfur-containing ligands.41 Hence, TU and SU are selected here to manipulate the CBD process (Supplementary Note 1, ESI†). With the addition of additives, the reaction would adopt path (III), that is, (SbO)+ and (OH)− in conjunction with TU or SU form complexion [(SbO)OH(additives)n] as the Sb precursor, instead of forming (SbO)OH. Meanwhile, (SbO)+ ions would be released slowly from the [(SbO)OH(additives)n] chelate as deposition continues, which slows down the homogeneous nucleation of (SbO)+ and SeSO32−, thus effectively facilitating the formation of uniform and compact Sb2Se3 films (Fig. 2).

In some of the CBD syntheses, TU and SU could also serve as sulfur and selenium sources for depositing films, such as CdS and ZnSe films.42,43 Therefore, it is essential to investigate whether TU and SU provide anions in film formation. The result of energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) exhibits that there is no sulfur element detected in the TU-Sb2Se3 film (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that TU is rarely or hardly hydrolyzed as a sulfur source in the CBD process since TU is more likely to form a chelate with metal ions as ligands than direct hydrolysis in an alkaline solution.44,45 Therefore, as expected, TU may only act as a complexing agent in the reaction, which would be conducive to the compact surface and improved device performance. However, distinct from TU, SU possesses higher reactivity and thus only requires traces of the base to trigger its hydrolysis.46,47 Therefore, we speculate that in addition to complexation, SU may provide a partial Se source to participate in the synthesis of Sb2Se3 films, which can be supported by the SEM test (Fig. S7, ESI†). In this case, there should be more Sb2Se3 particles induced by the partial hydrolysis of SU reaching the substrate, which assist the grain growth and coalescence and thus further increase the grain size in turn, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S8 (ESI†). As a consequence, it is proposed that the prominent quality of SU-Sb2Se3 benefits from two aspects: on the one hand, the complexation of SU suppresses the formation of oxide and slows down the homogeneous nucleation to obtain uniform and compact films, and on the other hand, the hydrolysis of a moderate amount of SU promotes further grain growth and well-crystallization. Besides, the beneficial effect on grain growth cannot be observed in the SEM images (Fig. S9, ESI†) of TU-Sb2Se3 films, further indicating that TU may only act as a complexing agent in the reaction. In principle, all these observed enhancements in morphology and crystallinity as well as chemical purity will favor the photovoltaic performance in the Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Photovoltaic performance of the Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells
We fabricated a series of Sb2Se3 devices based on the CBD strategy with a planar structure of glass/FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. A typical cross-sectional image is shown in Fig. 3a. In the device fabrication, we primarily optimized the deposition parameter of different approaches (Fig. S10–S12, ESI†), including the deposition time and the amount of additives added. According to the above optimization, the statistical distribution box diagrams of those devices obtained using the optimized parameters are displayed in Fig. 3b and c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the best devices are summarized in Table 1. First, the control Sb2Se3 solar cell presents a PCE of 5.82% (Fig. 3d). In sharp contrast, an outstanding photovoltaic performance is achieved in the SU-Sb2Se3 solar cell, where the champion PCE is as high as 10.57%, with a VOC of 0.467 V, a JSC of 33.52 mA cm−2, and an FF of 67.64%. The TU-Sb2Se3 solar cell also shows a decent performance with a VOC of 0.454 V, a JSC of 31.23 mA cm−2, an FF of 64.73%, and a PCE of 9.17%. Significantly, the increase in the FF value in additive-based devices is manifested in the decrease in reduced series resistance (RS) and the increase in shunt resistance RSH (Fig. S13, ESI†). The improvement of JSC values is well confirmed from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3e), which exhibit a high response in the 500–1100 nm range, especially in SU-based devices. This can be attributed to the prominent quality of the SU-based absorber, of which the larger grains and better crystallinity facilitated efficient charge transport in the device. Moreover, we have further calculated the voltage deficit (VOC-def) and the Urbach energy (EU) to intuitively assess VOC, as shown in Supplementary Note 3 and Fig. S14 (ESI†). The efficient reduction of VOC-def and EU values in additive-based Sb2Se3 solar cells is likely due to the significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination and defect states, which are commonly related to the morphology and crystallinity of Sb2Se3 films (see the discussion below). It is worth mentioning that VOC-def of our best SU-Sb2Se3 device is only 0.488 V, which represents the lowest VOC-def of Sb2Se3 solar cells. Moreover, SU-Sb2Se3 solar cells exhibited a negligible degree of hysteresis and superior stability (Fig. S15, ESI†).

We also noted that the integrated current densities from EQE curves were 22.41, 28.51, and 30.71 mA cm−2 for the three devices, respectively, which were lower than the JSC obtained from the corresponding J–V curves. This mismatching of JSC between the EQE curves and the J–V curves can also be observed in previous studies of Sb2Se3 solar cells.27,48 According to the literature,48,49 this can be attributed to the deep levels in the junction region, which act as generation–recombination centers. The photogenerated carriers can recombine at these centers at low light levels (EQE measurement). In contrast, under high light intensity (under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2), some of these centers are more likely to be filled due to photoexcitation by sub-band gap photons. As a result, a measurement of JSC under AM 1.5G illumination may result in a value that is much higher than the integrated value of quantum efficiency obtained under low-intensity monochromatic radiation. Besides, on the basis of our previous studies,50,51 we have found that this JSC mismatch seems to depend on the elemental composition, as shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). In particular, our investigations show that the more the S at the anion site, the better the match of calculated JSC values between the EQE and the J–V curves. In brief, it indicates that the mismatch of JSC between EQE and J–V curves in this work is not only simply caused by deep level defects in the junction region but also by the element composition.
For the convenience of comparison, we summarize the PCE of Sb2Se3 solar cells in the literature (Fig. 3f and Table S4, ESI†). It turns out that the PCE of 10.57% obtained in this work with the Sb2Se3 layer synthesized by the CBD method represents the highest PCE among those of all types of Sb2Se3 solar cells reported to date (Fig. 3f). Excitedly and impressively, the PCE of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the newly established CBD process is significantly greater than that of the earlier report based on a similar method (only 0.13%)35 and comparable with or even superior to those of other physical vacuum methods (refs, RTE 7.6%,10 CSS 9.2%,3 and IVD 10.12%52). Given the low cost of CBD processing and the possibility of scaling up, our method is very promising for fabricating highly efficient Sb2Se3 solar modules.
Photoelectrical properties of devices and films
Basically, the enhanced photovoltaic performance is mostly contributed by the improved photoelectric properties of the absorber films, such as charge transfer and recombination. To evaluate the recombination process in these devices and further elucidate the mechanism of improved PCE, the J–V curves of three typical devices in the dark were characterized (Fig. 4a). The diode parameters are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†), and the computational method is described in Supplementary Note 4 (ESI†). First, the shunt conductance (G) was determined from the J–V slope near zero bias (Fig. 4b). Then, the dV/dJ versus J + JSC − GV characteristics were plotted as shown in Fig. 4c. Impressively, the Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated with either TU or SU additives display a lower diode ideality factor (A) and series resistance (RS) compared to the control device, indicating an improvement in the diode's behavior. Furthermore, the reverse saturation current density (J0) values were extracted by fitting the curves of ln(J + JSC − GV) against (V − RJ), as shown in Fig. 4d. Fundamentally, J0 is related to the loss of photo-generated charge carriers at the defects. The control-Sb2Se3 device displayed a high J0 value, suggesting severe carrier recombination and high leakage current density, both of which significantly deteriorate photovoltaic performance. Instead, the reduced J0 values indicate that the use of additives significantly reduced this photo-generated charge carriers’ loss. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, we also measured the J–V curves of the three devices under different light intensities to further unveil the charge extraction and recombination processes. In principle, the slope of the fitting line is associated with the trap-assisted SRH recombination mechanism.53 Interestingly, the reduced slope values can be observed in devices fabricated with additives, implying that the trap-assisted recombination was efficiently suppressed and consistent with the improvement of JSC and PCE in additive-based devices, especially in SU-Sb2Se3 devices.

This suppression of nonradiative recombination was further confirmed from the carrier dynamics studied by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), as shown in Fig. 4f. The parameters of transition dynamics were extracted from pseudo-color TAS (Fig. S17, ESI†) and fitted with a bi-exponential equation,54,55 with the corresponding data listed in Table S6 (ESI†). Compared with the control-Sb2Se3 film, the additive-based films display a longer carrier lifetime, indicating a more efficacious extraction and collection of charges and a slower recombination rate in Sb2Se3 films with the introduction of additives.
Overall, these findings suggest that using additives in the CBD approach improves the effectiveness of carrier separation and collection and inhibits charge recombination in the absorber. Since the poor film quality is responsible for an increase in recombination pathways, these improved photoelectric properties in additive-based samples are likely due to the improvement of the film morphology, crystallinity, and chemical purity via exquisite manipulation of the reaction during the additive-assisted CBD procedures, which is proposed as the primary reason for the increased VOC, JSC, and FF of the devices reported here.
Deep-level defect analysis of the films
Due to the low structural symmetry (Fig. 5a and b), there are two non-equivalent Sb sites and three non-equivalent Se sites in the Q1D Sb2Se3 structure.56,57 When the defects are formed on these non-equivalent sites, the formation energies and charge-state transition levels are significantly different, which results in complicated inherent defects of Sb2Se3. In this sense, it is necessary to probe how the additives affect the defect formation in the Sb2Se3 films. We conducted the optical deep-level transient spectroscopic (O-DLTS) measurements, from which the trap levels (ET), trap density (NT), and defect capture cross-section (σ) can be revealed. The detailed defect parameters extracted from the Arrhenius curves (Fig. 5e) and DLTS signals are summarized in Table 2. As displayed in Fig. 5d, two kinds of hole trap states, which are denoted as H1 and H2, are detected in all devices. To identify the influence of these defects on the device performance, we study the band edge positions and defect levels for the three devices (Fig. 5g–i), for which the energy band information was obtained by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S18 and Table S7, ESI†). According to the first-principles calculations,57–59 H1 and H2 can all be indexed as the selenium antisites (SeSb1 and SeSb2), as shown in Fig. 5c. This can be because the Sb2Se3 films obtained by CBD in this work are Se-rich (Table S8, ESI†). According to Huang et al.,56 under the Se-rich conditions, two SeSb antisite defects have a relatively low formation energy (<1 eV), which makes the replacement of Sb with Se easier in the Sb2Se3 structure.

As a deep-level defect located near the middle of the bandgap, the selenium antisite defect is particularly likely to act as a recombination center compared with the shallow-level defect located close to the band edge.58 Furthermore, the selenium antisite defect is a specific amphoteric defect with similar carrier capture cross-sections for both electrons and holes, which seriously affect the SRH recombination and Fermi level pinning and thus severely impede carrier transport and limit the final photovoltaic performance. The energy level of the H2 defect state is placed deeper in the band gap than that of H1, implying that H2 is the dominant defect in these films. The control-Sb2Se3 device has a higher defect density (6.65 × 1013 cm−3) of H2, consistent with its poor film quality. After regulating the CBD reaction in the deposition processes, the values of NT significantly decrease. Particularly, the H2 defect density of the SU-Sb2Se3 device is reduced by one order of magnitude, resulting in fewer trap-assisted recombination, in agreement with the data from the abovementioned J–V measurements under dark conditions and at variable light intensity. Preferably, the defect densities in H1 also decrease after the TU and SU are introduced. To intuitively assess the influence of the deep-level defect on the devices, we calculated the value of (σ·NT)−1 to evaluate the trap lifetime (τtrap) (τ ∝ (σ·NT)−1). As exhibited in Fig. 5f, the highest (σ·NT)−1 value in the SU-Sb2Se3 device for both defects means a long charge τtrap, which is related to the nonradiative recombination of electrons and holes through defects or trap states in Sb2Se3 films, and is in good agreement with the TAS results (Fig. 4f). In a word, employing TU and SU to manipulate the reactions significantly suppressed the defect states of the CBD-based Sb2Se3 films. Especially for H2 defects, the defect density decreased from 1013 cm−3 to 1012 cm−3. The results discussed above clearly indicate that the exquisite manipulation of the reaction kinetics in our newly reported additive-assisted CBD technique is an effective route for the fabrication of high-quality Sb2Se3 films and high-efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel additive-assisted chemical synthesis technique for producing high-quality Sb2Se3 thin films and high-performance solar devices. To fabricate a homogeneous and compact Sb2Se3 layer, the chalcogen-containing organic compounds (TU or SU) as additives are introduced to regulate the kinetics of the reaction in our newly created CBD procedures. Impressively, by the exquisite manipulation of the reaction process, not only the morphology and crystallinity of the Sb2Se3 films are considerably improved but also the defect states in the films are suppressed. With the decreased defect density by about one order of magnitude, the photo-generated carrier could enjoy a longer lifetime through the decrease of trap-assisted recombination, and the corresponding Sb2Se3 solar cells could exhibit a high VOC, FF, and JSC. Ultimately, the Sb2Se3 planar solar cell fabricated based on the newly developed CBD approach has achieved the highest PCE of 10.57% among all reported Sb2Se3 solar devices so far. This study manifests the superiority of the CBD strategy and the possibility of bridging the gap between large-area, high-quality Sb2Se3 solar cells and their commercial implementation.
Experimental
Preparation of Na2Se2SO3 solution
The synthesis of Na2SeSO3 was conducted by referring to the reported method.27 Specifically, 0.31 g of the Se powder (Beijing Loyaltarget Technology Co., Ltd) was reacted with 2.52 g of sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, Sinopharm Chemical Co., Ltd) in 40 mL of deionized water using a hydrothermal method at 135 °C for 8 h.
Preparation of Sb2Se3 layers
The Sb2Se3 thin films were synthesized by the CBD method directly on the FTO/CdS substrate, in which antimony potassium tartrate (KSbC4H4O7·0.5H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Co., Ltd) and Na2Se2SO3 were used as the source for Sb and Se, respectively. In this work, thiourea (CH4N2S, Sinopharm Chemical Co., Ltd) and selenourea (CH4N2Se, Sigma) were chosen as additives to regulate the growth of Sb2Se3 films. First, 38 mL of deionized water and 15 mmol of KSbC4H4O7·0.5H2O were added to a 100 mL beaker with continuous stirring until complete dissolution is achieved. Then, 2.62–10.51 mmol of CH4N2S or 0.05–0.81 mmol of CH4N2Se and 2 mL of 0.1 M Na2Se2SO3 were simultaneously added to the above solution and stirred. After that, the FTO/CdS substrate was immersed into the precursor solution within the glass beaker, which was subsequently transferred to a hot water bath deposition system for 1–7 h, where the temperature was set at 95 °C. After deposition, the Sb2Se3 films were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water directly and blow-dried with nitrogen. Finally, Sb2Se3 films were further annealed at 375 °C for 5 min in a nitrogen atmosphere to improve their crystalline quality. The detailed recipes and reaction conditions for the synthesis of Sb2Se3 by the CBD method are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
Device fabrication
First, the FTO-coated glass (Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd) was sequentially cleaned with detergent, acetone, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. Then, a CdS buffer layer (∼60 nm) was deposited using the CBD method followed by a CdCl2 post-treatment process according to our reported method.60,61 For the preparation of the hole transport layer (HTL), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di[4–methoxyphenyl] amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd) was deposited by the spin coating method.62 Finally, as an electrode, a 60–70 nm thick Au film was thermally deposited under a pressure of 5.0 × 10−4 Pa.
Characterization
The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the Sb2Se3 films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN, MIRA3). The EDS spectra were recorded on an instrument from Oxford Instruments Nanoanalysis (Aztec Energy). The crystal structure and phase of the Sb2Se3 films were probed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab-3 kW). XPS was conducted on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha. The ultrafast transient absorption measurements were performed on HARPIA, Light Conversion. The energy levels of Sb2Se3 were analyzed using a ThermoFisher system with a bias of −5 V. The absorption spectra were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV mini-1280). The ultrafast transient absorption (TA) measurements were carried out with an ultrafast TA spectrometer (HARPIA, Light Conversion) with a femtosecond laser (a repetition rate of 40 kHz, a 1030 nm central wavelength, and a pulse duration of ∼120 fs, PHAROS, Light Conversion). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) illumination from a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS109 X100R) with a source meter (Keithley 2400). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QE system (Enlitech, QE-R666). The deep-level transient spectra (DLTS) were obtained using a Phystech FT-1230 HERA DLTS system. Temperature scans were made between 120 and 420 K, with 2 K intervals.

Broader context
As a kind of new photovoltaic material, antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has attracted attention due to its excellent stability and suitable photovoltaic parameters. As everything has two sides, its disadvantages cannot be ignored; a low-symmetry crystal structure and complicated defect properties are its unique synthesis challenges for high-performance solar devices. Up to now, it is still critical to enhancing efficiency as well as achieving fundamental understanding. Herein, we establish a novel additive-assisted chemical bath deposition (CBD) technology for synthesizing Sb2Se3 films, where the kinetics of the reaction during the deposition process can be elaborately regulated via the use of additives. Mechanistic studies show that the improvement of film quality can be observed from the morphology, crystallinity, and chemical purity through the introduction of additives. Meanwhile, the use of additives significantly suppresses the defect states, which is conducive to improving the efficient extraction and transport of photogenerated carriers as well as reducing the nonradiative recombination of the Sb2Se3 films. Consequently, the additive-based Sb2Se3 device presents an excellent PCE of 10.57%, which has been the highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells to date.
