    , Accepted 15th November 2010First published on 2nd December 2010AbstractA new diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative 1 exhibits excellent hole mobilities of 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a current on/off ratio of 106 under ambient conditions in bottom-gate, top-contact organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) fabricated by vacuum deposition.
The search for new π-conjugated organic semiconductor materials and their application in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) has emerged as an important research field.1 Although the highest charge carrier mobilities are observed in single crystals,2 thin films appear more promising with regard to applications. Typically, acenes3 and heteroacenes4 as well as oligothiophenes5 are among the best performing p-type organic semiconductors, exhibiting high field effect mobilities μ > 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on/off ratios >105. The outstanding performance of these molecules has been related to rather small reorganization energies upon formation of their radical cations combined with favourable packing in the solid state.6 Although both of these features are appropriately met by acenes,3 more robust and synthetically easier accessible materials are desired from the application point of view.
Diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) are a versatile class of π-conjugated materials, whose most prominent and large scale commercial application is in the area of high grade red pigments, e.g., Pigment Red 254 (“Ferrari red”), that exhibit excellent mechanical and thermal stabilities, bright shades and high colour strengths.7 These pigments containing hydrogen atoms at the lactam nitrogens are insoluble in most common solvents owing to strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions between the lactam units and π–π-stacking between the π-systems.8 Thus, N,N′-disubstituted derivatives bearing alkyl groups,9 dendritic residues,10 or polar and ionic substituents11 have been synthesised to achieve solubility in organic solvents and even in water. Due to their favourable optical properties, DPP derivatives were recently considered for dye-sensitised solar cells12 and as small molecule donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, where remarkably high power conversion efficiencies of 4.4% could be achieved.13 Interestingly, by decreasing the orbital energies with electron-withdrawing substituents, DPPs could also be utilized as an acceptor component in BHJ solar cells.14 Despite exhibiting p-type and n-type charge transport properties in photovoltaic devices, DPPs have received little attention as organic semiconductor materials in OTFTs.15–17 In one example, a DPP pigment with a lactam NH-group has been deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum and compared with the solution-cast and heat-treated Boc-group-protected analogue, both showing only modest hole mobilities of ∼10−5 and ∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.15 In a second example, it was demonstrated that DPPs functionalised at cores with terthiophenes afford hole mobilities of up to 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 in solution-fabricated OTFTs.16 In a further example, OTFTs from solution-processed polymers bearing alternating DPP and quaterthiophene units were shown to possess ambipolar charge transport properties with hole mobilities up to 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities up to 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1.17 Notably, for the last two examples it remains ambiguous to what extent the charge transport properties, in particular for hole transport, are governed by the DPP or the oligothiophene subunits. Because oligothiophenes are very common p-type organic semiconductors, it appears more reasonable to relate the observed hole transport properties to the oligothiophene subunits rather than to the strongly quadrupolar DPPs. Herein, however, we describe a p-type semiconductor based on a pristine DPP derivative (1, Scheme 1) that shows excellent hole transport characteristics in thin film organic field effect transistors prepared by vacuum deposition.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of DPP 1. 
The new DPP derivative 1 was synthesised by cyanation of the respective brominated precursor 218 by performing a Rosemund-von Braun cyano-dehalogenation reaction with copper(I) cyanide in DMF at 130 °C affording 1 with 31% yield (Scheme 1). The product was easily purified by column chromatography as the branched alkyl chains provide good solubility of this material in organic solvents. The molecular structure of DPP 1 was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, high resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.
The redox behaviour of DPP 1 was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane with ferrocene as an internal standard. Two reversible reduction waves at −1.24 V and −1.77 V as well as one reversible oxidation at 0.86 V are observed (Fig. S4, see ESI†). These values correspond to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.66 eV and −3.56 eV if the most commonly used ionization potential of ferrocene (4.8 eV) is applied.19 The optical absorption in dichloromethane shows a maximum at λmax = 586 nm (Fig. S5, see ESI†). An excellent agreement is found for the optical band gap (2.12 eV calculated from λmax) and the electrochemical band gap (2.10 eV from CV).
To investigate the charge transport properties of compound 1 bottom-gate, top-contact TFTs with a 110 nm thick SiO2/AlOx/SAM gate dielectric were fabricated and measured in air. The organic compound was deposited at four different substrate temperatures (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows the output and transfer characteristic of the TFT prepared at TD = 70 °C that exhibits a hole mobility of 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 as determined in the saturation regime and a current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 106. These values are amazingly high if we consider the small size of the π-conjugated scaffold, the quite high amount of electronically inactive alkyl chains and the presence of a mixture of diastereomers (due to the racemic nature of the ethyl hexyl side chains).

The dependence of the mobility on the deposition temperature TD (Table 1) shows an increase of the mobility from 20 °C to 50 °C reaching a maximum at 70 °C, whereas a slight decrease was observed at 90 °C. To correlate these results with the morphology of the organic layer, the latter was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). With increasing deposition temperature, DPP 1 forms larger grains and thus the number of crystalline domains decreases (Fig. 2). A lower number of grain boundaries should be favourable for the charge transport and this leads to an increase of the field effect mobility.

In summary, we discovered an efficient p-channel organic semiconductor material based on the new DPP derivative 1, exhibiting high hole mobilities and on/off ratios in vacuum-deposited TFTs. The easy synthetic access is an additional advantage of this organic material for a wide range of applications and it opens up new prospectives for target molecules in respect of high performance organic semiconductors.
