    , Accepted 21st February 2016First published on 23rd February 2016AbstractThe design of efficient, durable and affordable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is indispensable in regenerative energy conversion and storage systems, such as water splitting, fuel cells and rechargeable metal–air batteries. Here we present a high-performance bifunctional catalyst with cobalt and nitrogen embedded carbon nanotubes (CNCNs), which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR and OER. For comparison, iron and nickel embedded carbon nanotubes (FeNCNs and NiNCNs) are also investigated to reveal the electrochemical performance upon transition metal doping. In the half-cell testing, FeNCN-44 and CNCN-100 show better electrochemical activities towards the ORR, while the compositionally optimized CNCN-44 outperforms other prepared catalysts during the OER including commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. The CNCN-44 exhibits a low oxidation overpotential of 0.38 V and stability with negligible deactivation over extended operation, which make it the best catalyst in overall bifunctional performance. We also test the suitability and durability of CNCN-44 as the oxygen electrode for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. The homemade battery exhibits a high open-circuit potential of 1.45 V and stable charge–discharge durability over 12 hours in 6 M KOH electrolyte at 10 mA cm−2, which make our compositionally optimized CNCN-44 a promising candidate as a cathode material for rechargeable zinc–air batteries.
Introduction
With the growing environmental awareness and rising cost using fossil fuels, the development of renewable energy storage and conversion systems with environmental benignity, low cost and high specific energy has attracted tremendous attention globally. Metal–air batteries have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage technologies besides renewable solar, wind and hydro energy.1–3 Due to the abundance and accessibility of the fuel source, atmospheric oxygen, and high energy density, metal–air batteries hold great potential in powering portable electronic devices and electric vehicles (EV) with long-range capability.4 Building on the fuel reservoir free nature, metal–air batteries can be readily adopted with compact, lightweight but yet efficient design. Among different metal–air batteries, the more recent rechargeable lithium air battery has been studied intensively for its extremely high theoretical energy density (11680 Wh kg−1).5–8 However, solutions to the high cost of its active materials, poor cycling performance and safety concerns are still missing. As opposed to lithium–air batteries, zinc–air batteries are easier to handle and can operate with little safety concern. The primary zinc–air battery has a theoretical energy density of 1084 Wh kg−1, which is about three times higher than the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries.9–11 Although many advances have been made in developing rechargeable zinc–air batteries, their inherent limitations, such as poor cycle life, low practical capacity and power density, hamper their commercialization.12–14
Although all components contribute to the performance of zinc–air batteries, the operation efficiency is mainly restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen electrochemical reactions, i.e., oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), at the oxygen electrode.15–17 So far, precious metal based catalysts, Pt/C and RuO2, have been considered the most active benchmark electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER, respectively.18–20 Their insufficient performance, scarcity and high cost, however, make it critical to explore other efficient and cost-effective bifunctional catalysts to satisfy the required performance in practical applications.21,22 Recently, rationally designed nanomaterials incorporating transition metals have proven to be effective bifunctional catalysts for enhancing the ORR and OER with favorable control of morphology and composition.23,24 For instance, Chen and co-workers synthesized an iron encapsulated N-graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR and OER.25 Upon metal and nitrogen doping, the tailored electronic configuration can provide more active sites while preventing the dopants from degradation during long-term operation.26 It is also noted that the composition of the dopants in the carbon matrix is another important factor in tuning the redox properties. Tammeveski et al. reported the preparation of an N-doped carbon aerogel with different cobalt doping levels.27 Taking advantage of synergistic effects of the optimized metal and nitrogen dopant content, the resultant nanostructure possessed high electroactivity for use as a bifunctional catalyst.
Herein, we focus on the compositional manipulation of cobalt–nitrogen embedded carbon nanotubes (CNCNs) to achieve optimized electroactivity as a bifunctional catalyst and examine their practical performance in rechargeable single-cell zinc–air batteries. The CNCNs with different cobalt and nitrogen contents were synthesized through a facile one-step thermal treatment process.28 This synthesis route can be easily adopted for large-scale manufacturing due to its process simplicity and the accessibility of precursor materials. The unique tubular carbon structure provides an effective physical barrier in stabilizing the embedded cobalt, and excellent electron conductivity with gap-free contact between the dopant metal and inner graphitic layer. The composition-tailored CNCNs outperform RuO2 and Pt/C based catalysts in half-cell tests carried out using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The single-cell rechargeable zinc–air battery test with the optimized CNCN electrode confirms its excellent electrochemical activity and stability in alkaline electrolytes.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), iron(II) chloride hexahydrate, nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate, polytetrafluoroethylene preparation (60 wt% dispersion in H2O), Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water), commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) 20 wt% (Pt loading: 20 wt%, Pt on carbon black) and ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, reagent grade) was bought from Amresco. The zinc electrode strip was purchased from Frey Scientific. Purified water (18.2 MΩ cm) was prepared using a Barnstead Nanopure Diamond system.
Materials characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a Philips CM200 UT (Field Emission Instruments, USA). A FEI Sirion field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used for imaging. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS-165 multi-technique electron spectrometer system with a base pressure of 10−9 Torr. The spectra of the surfaces were obtained with an AXIS-165 manufactured by Kratos Analytical Inc. (Spring Valley, NY, USA) using a monochromatic X-ray radiation of 1487 eV (Al Kα). The spectrometer was calibrated against both the Au 4f7/2 peak at 84.0 eV and the Ag 3d5/2 peak at 368.3 eV. Static charging when present was corrected with a neutralizer (flood gun) by placing the carbon peak (C 1s) at about 285 eV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was conducted with a Rigaku Miniflex 600. The tube was operated at 40 kV accelerating voltage and 15 mA current.
Synthesis of cobalt and nitrogen embedded carbon nanotubes
The synthesis of carbon nanotubes with different compositions of cobalt and nitrogen were achieved by a facile thermal treatment method.28 In a typical process, 1.5 g C2H4N4 and 0.089 g CoCl2·6H2O were ground thoroughly with a pestle and mortar with the addition of 1 mL EtOH. The mixed powder would gradually turn pink with the evaporation of EtOH. The powder was then placed in a tube furnace and heated to 900 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 0.5 h. The heating and cooling rates were 3 °C min−1. The product is denoted as CNCN-44. Samples with various cobalt and nitrogen content, CNCN-5, CNCN-25 and CNCN-100, were synthesized using molar ratios 5:1, 25:1 and 100:1 of C2H4N4 and CoCl2·6H2O. Iron and nickel embedded carbon nanotubes were also synthesized in a similar manner with 1.5 g FeCl2·6H2O and 0.75 g NiCl2·6H2O as metal precursors, respectively. The products are referred to as FeNCN-44 and NiNCN-22.
Electrochemical experiments
The CNCN and commercial Pt/C catalysts (2 mg mL−1) were obtained by mixing the powders into Nafion solution, which contains 8 mL purified water, 2 mL isopropanol, and 0.05 mL Nafion. The mixture was then ultrasonicated to obtain a homogeneous catalyst ink. The working electrode was obtained by dropcasting 20 μL of the catalysts onto a polished and cleaned glassy carbon rotating disc electrode (RDE, 5 mm in diameter) surface and dried at 60 °C. The mass loading is ∼0.2 mg cm−2. The electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 630E potentiostat (CH instruments Co.), with a platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. Prior to each test, the electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) was bubbled with oxygen for 30 minutes and maintained during the measurements to ensure oxygen-saturation. The measured potentials were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.2415 + 0.059 × pH. The oxidation overpotential was calculated using the formula η (V) = ERHE − 1.23 V. All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured at 10 mV s−1. The electrochemical measurements were all IR compensated and conducted at room temperature.
A rechargeable zinc–air battery was tested using a homemade electrochemical cell with two-electrode configuration by pairing a CNCN loaded cathode with a zinc anode in 6 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. The CNCN-44 was loaded on a 5% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) treated carbon paper (Toray Carbon Paper 120 – Wet Proofed, Fuel Cell Store) to achieve a mass loading of ∼1 mg cm−1. The battery measurements were carried out with continuous oxygen feed, which was humidified with 6 M KOH solution prior to entering the battery cell. For comparison, a Pt/C air cathode was also prepared and tested in the same manner.
Results and discussion
It is well recognized that the distribution of the active metal and the morphology of supporting materials have a great influence on their corresponding electrochemical performance.29,30 We first investigate the morphology of CNCNs using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the knotted carbon nanotubes were successfully synthesized with cobalt metal incorporated inside. The structural characteristics match with the other reports using a similar synthesis method.26,28 The size of the doped cobalt nanoparticles is ∼20 nm depending on the diameter of the encapsulating carbon nanotubes. The morphological and size uniformity of CNCN-44 are clearly presented in Fig. 1c and d. The intertwined CNCNs form a conductive network, which enhances the electron transport in electrocatalytic reactions.31 It is worth mentioning that the sizes of carbon nanotubes have negligible change with different cobalt concentrations (not shown here). Iron and nickel embedded carbon nanotubes, FeNCNs and NiNCNs, also exhibit similar nanostructures (Fig. S1†) but with a relatively poly-dispersed tube size compared with their cobalt doped counterparts.

CNCN-25 and CNCN-44 were chosen as examples to reveal the structural change with different metal compositions. As shown in Fig. 2a, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of carbon nanotubes show characteristic peaks of graphite at 2θ = 26.6° and 43.4°. The embedded cobalt species are identified in two forms, Co metal and Co3O4. The cobalt diffraction peaks are distinct and well indexed compared to standard JCPDF file 15-0806. No major peak shift and structural variation are found in the XRD patterns of both compositions, indicating a negligible effect of the doping concentration on the crystal structure.

The trend of surface oxidation states and the bonding configuration of different cobalt/nitrogen ratios were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using CNCN-25 and CNCN-44. As is revealed in Fig. 2b, only carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and cobalt are presented in the XPS spectra. Further quantification analysis of the elemental concentration reveals that the cobalt concentration of CNCN-25 is 1.4 times higher than that of CNCN-44, while the nitrogen content is 1.2 times higher (Table 1). For the core level spectra of Co 2p, the characteristic peaks are found at the binding energies of 779.2 eV (Co 2p1/2) and 795 eV (Co 2p3/2), respectively. For CNCN-44, based on the relative intensity of the Co3+ and Co2+, Co2+ is the dominating cation in the crystal lattice (Fig. 2c). In contrast, CNCN-25 exhibits different characteristics, where the oxidation states of major Co are in the Co3+ form. It is suggested that the propensity of forming Co3O4 is higher with increasing cobalt concentration embedded in the carbon nanotubes. Similar to other cobalt embedded carbon tubular structures, no observable metallic cobalt peaks are found, which further confirms the successful encapsulation of cobalt metal.25 The deconvoluted spectrum of complex N 1s shows the presence of four types of nitrogen species, which correspond to quaternary (N1), pyridinic (N2), pyrrolic (N3), and oxidized nitrogen (N4), respectively (Fig. 2d). Notably, the majority nitrogen forms in both CNCN-25 and CNCN-44 are pyridinic and quaternary, which are well recognized as the active sites towards the ORR.32,33

The electrocatalytic performance towards the ORR and OER was then investigated on a RDE in 0.1 M oxygen-saturated KOH solution with a standard three-electrode system. Expanding our previous ORR study on cobalt and nitrogen co-doped tubular catalysts, CNCN-44 achieves the optimum composition balance as a bifunctional catalyst compared to CNCNs with other compositions.28 We first examine the ORR activities of prepared catalysts using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH solution from −1.0 V to 0.0 V vs. SCE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. In Fig. S2a and b,† CNCN-5, CNCN-25, CNCN-44, CNCN-100, FeNCN-44, NiNCN-22 and commercial Pt/C display distinct ORR peaks in O2-saturated solution for all samples, which demonstrates the good electrocatalytic activity, especially for the CNCN-44 catalyst toward the ORR. Comparison of the oxygen reducing ability of the prepared catalysts was carried out using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and is presented in Fig. 3a. The ORR onset and half-wave potentials of CNCN-44 are ∼0.89 and ∼0.79 V, respectively, which are consistent with our previous study.28 The slightly lower onset and half-wave potentials of CNCN-44 than those of CNCN-100 (∼0.91 and 0.80 V) demonstrate an improved ORR catalytic performance for a lower cobalt doping content. The FeNCN-44 exhibits the best ORR performance comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C, which is indicative of a different catalytic mechanism in oxygen reduction from that observed using cobalt and nickel dopants.33 Further kinetic analysis shows that the transferred electron number per oxygen molecule is close to 4 for CNCN-44, which is a desirable four-electron reaction pathway in the ORR (Fig. 3b). The LSV and corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots of CNCN-44 at different rotation rates are presented in Fig. S3a and b.† The increment of current density at higher rotation rate can be explained by the faster oxygen flux and shorter diffusion length on the electrode surface.34,35 The derived K–L plots show a good linearity between J−1 and ω−1/2, indicating that the number of transferred electrons remains constant at different electrode potentials. The details regarding bifunctional catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts are further investigated by evaluating their OER activities. For comparison, CNCN-5, CNCN-25, CNCN-44, CNCN-100, FeNCN-44, NiNCN-22, commercial Pt/C and RuO2 were measured using LSV in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, and the resultant curves are displayed in Fig. 3c. It is clear that the trend of the OER properties is completely different from their ORR properties. Among them catalysts investigated, CNCN-44 possessed the best OER performance in terms of onset potential and current density. The OER activity is compared with the voltage when the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, which is taken as a metric relevant to solar fuel synthesis.36,37 The optimized CNCN-44 catalyst demonstrates a small overpotential of 0.381 V (vs. RHE), which is better than those of FeNCN-44 (0.48 V), NiNCN-22 (0.481 V), Pt/C (0.65 V), and comparable to that of RuO2 (0.37 V). In the meantime, this value is smaller than those of other reported OER catalysts including the CoxOy/NC nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (0.43 V),38 nitrogen-doped graphene/CNT nanostructures (0.42 V)25 and NixCo3−xO4 nanostructured films (0.52 V).39 Moreover, at an electrode potential of 1.65 V, the optimized CNCN-44 exhibits the highest current density of 40.2 mA cm−2 among all prepared samples. In order to determine the most efficient catalyst for the rechargeable zinc–air battery, we judged the suitability of our candidates based on the overall bifunctional performance. As shown in Fig. 3d, the optimized CNCN-44 for the overall ORR and OER activities is better than the prepared FeNCNs, NiNCNs and Pt/C. Electrochemical parameters, ORR voltage at a current density of −3 mA cm−2 (EORR), OER voltage at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (EOER) and their difference (ΔE = EOER − EORR) of CNCN-44 show obvious superiority to those of various bifunctional catalysts reported to date (Table. S2†). A Tafel plot was also derived to further reveal the OER kinetics of the prepared catalysts (Fig. 3e). Here, the derived Tafel slopes are 66.7, 161, 149.6, 152.5 and 76.4 mV dec−1 for CNCN-44, FeNCN-44, NiNCN-22 and RuO2, respectively (Table 2). The measured Tafel slope of RuO2 is consistent with the reported value.37,40 The optimized CNCN-44 possesses a smaller Tafel slope than those of other catalysts including RuO2, demonstrating a superior OER kinetics and efficiency. In order to address the concern of electrochemical stability for the OER, chronoamperometry tests were performed with CNCN-44 and commercial RuO2 for 12 hours at η (EOER − 1.23 V) when the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 3f). It is worth noting that an enhanced current density is observed for CNCN-44 after the starting current density of 10 mA cm−2, and remains unchanged at the end of the test. In contrast, RuO2 suffers from a substantial loss of electroactivity in a short period and ends with only 25% of its initial current density. The excellent characteristics of high activity, desirable kinetics and outstanding durability manifest that the optimized CNCN-44 holds promising potential as a bifunctional catalyst for the ORR and OER in regenerative energy systems.

To examine the potential of our optimized catalyst in practical application, we assembled and tested our homemade zinc–air battery using CNCN-44 as the oxygen cathode. The battery exhibits a high open circuit potential of 1.45 V in O2-saturated 6.0 M KOH electrolyte, comparable to other state-of-the-art nonprecious metal catalyst (Fig. S4a†).41 Usually, 6.0 M KOH electrolyte is adopted in the zinc–air single cell test due to its high ionic conductivity.42 We first evaluate the static discharge curves of the air cathode by comparing our CNCN-44 and commercial Pt/C catalysts in O2-saturated 6.0 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a). The CNCN-44 based battery shows a discharging voltage plateau of 1.31 V without noticeable decay after long-term galvanostatic discharge, which is comparable to that of the Pt/C-based battery, indicating an excellent catalytic durability for oxygen reduction. For a competitive oxygen catalyst, low charge potential, high discharge potential, and the stability of these are desirable for efficient rechargeable metal–air batteries. Details regarding cyclability are investigated at a constant charge–discharge current density. In Fig. 4b, our CNCN-44 catalyst undergoes a deep charge–discharge (2 hours per cycle) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The overpotential of CNCN-44 only experienced a ∼9% decay at the end of cycling. In contrast, the overpotential of Pt/C suffered an ∼37% decrease after a 12-hour charge–discharge period. With respect to a higher charge–discharge current density, CNCN-44 shows ∼23% loss of activity in terms of overpotential, while Pt/C has a 47% larger gap between charge and discharge voltages (Fig. 4c). The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling for 350 cycles at 5 mA cm−2 was also carried out and shown in Fig. S4b.† Despite the fact that the loss of reversibility is inevitable upon constant exposure to oxygen rich and deficient environments using the same catalyst, the stability of discharging and overpotential are indicative of the high electrocatalytic performance of our optimized CNCN-44 catalyst. Building on the excellent cycling performance, we further investigated the rate capability of our rechargeable zinc–air battery using a galvanodynamic charge–discharge test (Fig. 4d). During the discharging process, our CNCN-44 catalyst displays a similar discharge voltage to that of Pt/C with current densities ranging from 0–100 mA cm−2. This high current density tolerance can be explained by the spacing and different Fermi levels between the metal and carbon support, which are responsible for the enhanced charge transfer and subsequently improved catalytic activities.43 In terms of charge, CNCN-44 demonstrates a lower charging potential at all tested current densities, which becomes clearer at high current densities. Overall, the solid electrochemical durability and excellent rechargeability of CNCN-44 during zinc–air battery operation are consistent with the high catalytic and bifunctional performances in the half-cell testing.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared cobalt, iron, nickel and nitrogen embedded carbon nanotubes with compositional variations of the embedded elements using a facile synthesis method. The investigations of their electrochemical activities have revealed that low cobalt content (CNCN-100) and iron doping (FeNCN) are more favourable towards the ORR. In terms of bifunctional performance, however, CNCN-44 possesses a well-balanced catalytic activity in both the ORR and OER, which outperforms its iron, nickel, commercial Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts in half-cell testing. The optimized ratio between embedded cobalt and nitrogen provides highly active ORR and OER sites, which synergistically enhance its electrochemical performance in half-cell testing. In addition to the high bifunctional activity and favourable kinetics, CNCN-44 also exhibits exceptionally good stability in OER chronoamperometry curves at η when the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2. We also demonstrated the capability of CNCN-44 as an oxygen catalyst in a practical zinc–air battery. Due to the high charge conductivity and catalytic activity, the homemade battery using the CNCN-44 catalyst shows a low overpotential after several charge–discharge cycles. More importantly, the nonprecious metal bifunctional catalyst measured with CNCN-44 displays superior and/or comparable performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. This work has brought to light the importance of compositional manipulation in optimizing transition-metal based bifunctional catalysts for regenerative energy storage and conversion systems, such as metal–air batteries and fuel cells.
