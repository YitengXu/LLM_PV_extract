    , Accepted 18th July 2016First published on 18th July 2016AbstractThe origin of the impact of mobile ions in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has recently become a hot topic of debate. Here, we investigate systematically the structural effect and various recombination pathways in PVSCs with different ion concentrations. By probing the transient ionic current in PVSCs, we extract mobile ion concentrations in a range of 1016 cm−3 to 1017 cm−3 depending on the processing conditions during a two-step process. The PVSC with the lowest ion concentration has both the highest efficiency over 15% and shelf-life over 1300 hours. Interestingly, in contrast to the commonly adopted models in the literature, we find that the crystal size and the bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination are not responsible for the large difference in photovoltaic performance. Instead, by using transient photocurrent and steady-state photoluminescence approaches, we find that the large reduction of short-circuit current (Jsc) in mobile ion populated devices is ascribed to the slow decay in photocurrent and the increasing amount of non-radiative recombination. In addition, we also find that the excess mobile ions trigger the deformation of perovskite to PbI2, which severely reduces the device lifetime. The results provide valuable information on the understanding of the role of excess mobile ions in the degradation mechanism of PVSCs.
1 Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3) has become one of the most attractive light absorbing materials in photovoltaic technology due to the rapid increase of device power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 to a certified 22.1% in 2016.1,2 One of the breakthroughs in the development of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) was made by Park et al.3 and Snaith et al.4 in 2012. They evolved the PVSC from a liquid-electrolyte configuration to an all-solid-state thin film device. Since then, various approaches have been successfully demonstrated to improve the performance with uniform film formation,5,6 defect passivation,7,8 solvent engineering9,10 and interface engineering.11,12 Despite the rapid development in efficiencies, there is rising interest in the fundamental understanding of the impacts of the chemical and electronic properties of perovskite films on the device performance. In particular, long-term stability is considered as one of the most challenging issues hindering the future development of PVSCs.
In order to further improve the stability of PVSCs, a detailed investigation of the device degradation mechanisms is of utmost importance. To date, perovskite degradation is found to be associated with several external factors, such as oxygen, moisture, heat, light soaking, and interlayers. For instance, Haque et al.13 compared the performances of devices based on mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3. They found that devices with mesoporous Al2O3 had lower charge separation yield and severer photo-oxidation. They proposed that the accumulated photo-electrons associated with Al2O3 strongly react with oxygen in the perovskite film and induce degradation. In addition, Kelly et al.14 reported that the perovskite only degraded slowly when the humidity was lower than 50%, while it degraded rapidly within 100 hours with 80% humidity. For the thermal stability, Snaith et al.15 demonstrated an extremely rapid (within 24 hours) degradation of perovskite at a temperature of 80 °C. However, they found that this degradation process was only observed under the combination of moisture and heat. The same group also reported that an encapsulated PVSC based on mesoporous TiO2 degraded rapidly (less than 5 hours) when exposed to UV light.16 They found photoinduced desorption of oxygen in TiO2 under UV irradiation. The desorbed oxygen sites created traps and induced rapid recombination and thus degradation of the device performance. In addition, perovskite is also found to be reactive with several commonly used interlayer materials. A thin film of ZnO nanoparticles has been reported to be reactive with the perovskite film during thermal annealing and it triggers the decomposition of perovskite to PbI2.17 PEDOT:PSS, spiro-OMeTAD and Ag electrodes were also found to be responsible for the degradation of the PVSCs.18–22
Besides the above discussed external degradation mechanisms, the impact of intrinsic properties such as compositional defects and dissociated ions in perovskite films on the device stability has been relatively unexplored. It should be noted that any intrinsic degradation associated with the perovskite crystal stability cannot be eliminated by encapsulation and therefore is detrimental to the viability of the technology.
Since the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal is composed of a coordinated ionic structure,23 residual ions accompanied by crystal defects are unavoidable during the film formation with precursor materials. Therefore, it is important to know (1) how low the excess ion concentration can be controlled during the crystalline film formation; and (2) how those ions alter the efficiency and stability of the device. Recently, ion migration within the perovskite film has been demonstrated to affect the device properties. For example, Huang et al.24 have demonstrated an ionic compositional gradient due to the ion migration, resulting in a p–i–n or n–i–p homojunction within a perovskite layer, thereby altering the diode properties of the device. However, the impact of these mobile ions on the device stability has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we report the impact of mobile ion concentration in perovskite layers on photovoltaic device performance and stability. We find that perovskite films deposited under different conditions exhibit a wide range of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 4.2% to over 15%. Furthermore, morphological, bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination processes are found to be not responsible for such large efficiency variation. Instead, by measuring the transient ionic current, we find 1016 to 1017 cm−3 mobile ion concentrations depending on the film processing conditions, which are further confirmed by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) results. By comparing the ion concentration and photovoltaic performance, it is clearly seen that the mobile ions have significant impacts on both the PCE and stability of the device. The mechanism of the reduced device performance with increasing mobile ion concentration has been proposed by two pathways: (1) mobile ions increase the non-radiative recombination of the charge carriers; and (2) mobile ions reduce the charge carrier transporting properties, which are demonstrated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and transient photocurrent measurements, respectively. In addition, we hypothesize that during the device operation, the mobile ions trigger the deformation of perovskite to PbI2, resulting in the degradation of the device performance. This is further supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of aged devices; the rate of PbI2 content increases faster with more mobile ions. This work addresses the intrinsic issue in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite on device stability which provides insight into the strategy for modifying the chemical composition to achieve highly stable photovoltaic devices.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Photovoltaic performance
As shown in Fig. 1a, the PVSCs in this study have a general structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 30 nm)/perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, 260–300 nm)/C60 (20 nm)/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP, 5 nm)/gold (Au, 80 nm). The corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is shown in Fig. 1b. The PEDOT:PSS and C60 are the hole transporting layer (HTL) and electron transporting layer (ETL), respectively, and the BCP is the hole blocking layer. Fig. 1c depicts the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices fabricated with different MAI loading times, and the detailed photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. The device with 0 s MAI loading time has the lowest PCE of 3.55%, where Voc = 0.76 V, Jsc = 15.34 mA cm−2, and FF = 30.59%. While a significant improvement of PCE to 14.8% is obtained when the MAI loading time is increased to 60 s, with enhanced Voc = 0.96 V, Jsc = 20.73 mA cm−2, and FF = 74.01%. Interestingly, with further increasing the MAI loading time to 90 s, 120 s and 180 s, the PCE has decreased gradually to 12.45%, 9.38% and 4.54%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1d. It should be noted that all the J–V characteristics presented in this study were consistently measured with forward bias scanning (from positive to negative). The hysteresis behaviour has been reported in our previous study.32 It is worth noting that the Voc and FF of the devices with a longer MAI loading time are only slightly decreased, but the Jsc is largely reduced by 2-3 times. To gain a deep insight into the change of Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding devices were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. S1.† Overall, the EQE of all devices have similar spectral characteristics, only the devices with 60 s and 90 s MAI loading times showed higher EQE values across the wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm compared with the other devices. The device with 180 s MAI loading time showed the lowest EQE across the entire wavelengths. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra are consistent with the values measured by J–V scan under 1 sun illumination. According to the previous reports, such a performance dependence of perovskite solar cells on various processing conditions is usually ascribed to the difference in crystal size and morphology of perovskite films.25,26

2.2 Morphological characteristics
We sought to investigate whether the morphology contributed to the device performance variation with different MAI loading times. Fig. 2 shows the topological SEM images of the perovskite films prepared under different conditions, where all the films were deposited on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates to be comparable to the working devices. Apparently, all the films have good surface coverage without pinholes. We calculate the distributions of the grain size of the perovskite crystals with respect to the MAI loading time which are shown in Fig. S2.† Fig. S3† compares the average grain size and the corresponding photovoltaic performance with different MAI loading times. We note that the average grain size of the perovskite crystal has gradually increased from 271 nm to 527 nm with increasing the MAI loading time from 0 s to 180 s. Interestingly, the devices in this study with MAI loading times of 30 s and 60 s have a similar grain size of about 350 nm, while the PCE of the devices has significantly increased from 5% to 15%. In addition, even the grain size has increased with increasing MAI loading time from 60 s to 180 s, while the PCE has dropped from 15% to about 5%. Therefore, although the longer MAI loading time would favor the intercalation of MAI into the PbI2 film to facilitate larger crystal formation, the size of the crystals in this range might not be the dominant factor responsible to the observed the device performance variation.

2.3 Bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination
In order to determine whether the recombination process plays a dominating role in influencing the device photovoltaic performance, devices with 0 s, 60 s and 120 s MAI loading times are evaluated under a wide range of illumination intensities (I) from 100 mW cm−2 down to 1.4 mW cm−2 as shown in Fig. S4.† According to the equation,27 Jsc ∝ Iα(1)the Jsc follows the power law dependence on the light illumination intensity. The corresponding log–log scale relationship between Jsc and I is plotted in Fig. 3a. It is clearly shown that the three devices with different MAI loading times exhibit similar behavior with a fitting slope of 1.05, indicating a similar charge recombination rate. Generally, a power law relationship with α = 1 is attributed to a weak bimolecular recombination (the free electrons and holes recombine within the photoactive layer) as reported in previous studies.27–29 Therefore, in this work, the linear light intensity dependent Jsc with α = 1.05 suggests that bimolecular recombination in all the devices is negligible and the charge carriers could be efficiently extracted to the corresponding electrodes.
 Fig. 3  (a) Measured Jsc of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells prepared with different MAI loading times plotted as a function of light intensity on a logarithmic scale. (b) Measured Voc of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells prepared with different MAI loading times plotted as a function of light intensity. 
It is worth noting that there is a build-in potential under short circuit conditions to assist the photo-generated charge carriers to be swept out of the device and collected as current. Thus, the intensity dependent Jsc is not sensitive to any small amount of traps. However, this would be more sensitive under open circuit conditions where there is absence of internal electrical field. As a consequence, studying the light intensity dependent Voc would give a better insight into the dominant recombination mechanisms in different devices.

Fig. 3b shows the Voc as a function of illumination intensity with the fitting to the following equation:27 Voc = (kT/q)ln(I) + constant(2)where k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the electron charge and T is the temperature in Kelvin. It has been reported that, if there is only bimolecular recombination, the slope of Vocversus ln(I) should be equal to kT/q. The slope greater than kT/q indicates an additional interfacial Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination.27–30 Previous reports have shown that the slope with SRH recombination can be as large as 3kT/q.28 As shown in Fig. 3b, the negligible difference of the slope from 1.12kT/q to 1.29kT/q for perovskite films prepared with 60 s and 120 s MAI loading times suggests a similar SRH trap-assisted recombination rate. The result is expected as all of the devices have the same interlayers (see Fig. 1a), and thus the difference of the HTL/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/ETL interfaces in 60 s and 120 s devices has a negligible effect to the SRH trap-assisted recombination. Considering the significant difference in the photovoltaic performance between these two devices, it is suggested that the recombination process also should not be the most detrimental factor to affect the device performance as shown in Fig. 1c.
We note that the slope of Vocversus ln(I) for the device with 0 s MAI loading time is slightly larger than 1.56kT/q, indicating a relatively stronger SRH trap-assisted recombination process. Bearing in mind the significant difference in the J–V characteristics between the 0 s device and other devices, the unique observed “S-shape” characteristic in the 0 s device could be ascribed to the presence of the PbI2/CH3NH3PbI3 junction due to an incomplete conversion reaction as demonstrated by Lu et al. and our group by spectroscopic analysis.31,32 Therefore, the PbI2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface in the device with 0 s MAI loading time slightly promotes the SRH trap-assisted recombination process.
Based on the morphological characteristics, light intensity dependent J–V results and analysis described above, it can be concluded that the morphology of the perovskite films and both bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination processes should not be the most important factor to induce the significant difference in photovoltaic performance among the devices as shown in Fig. 1c. We hypothesized that other intrinsic factors should be responsible to the device performance variation.
2.4 Probing ion migration in perovskite thin films
Recently, a hypothesis about migration of the mobile ions and the corresponding defects has been proposed to explain the variation of the photovoltaic performance and the hysteresis behavior of perovskite solar cells. Huang et al. have demonstrated the migration of methylammonium (MA+) and iodide (I−) ions within a perovskite layer by photothermal induced resonance measurements, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and XRD measurements.33,34 In addition, the impact of mobile ionic defects within perovskite films on the photovoltaic performance has also been suggested by Azpiroz et al. and Zhao et al. based on theoretical and experimental studies, respectively.35,36 However, it is still not clear how quantitatively the excess mobile ions would affect the device performance and stability.
In order to determine the mobile ion concentration in the perovskite films to investigate its relationship with the device performance, we probe the transient ionic current within the device under operating conditions. Fig. 4a illustrates the ion drift and diffusion processes at Jsc and Voc points. (i) At the Jsc point, the mobile ions are separated by the built-in potential Vbi; (ii) with an external applied voltage at the Voc point, the internal potential becomes a flat band, and the ions diffuse to the opposite side driven by the concentration gradient. (iii) Once the external voltage bias is removed, the ions will be drifted to their respective electrodes under the internal electrical field. The transient ionic currents of the devices with different MAI loading times are shown in Fig. 4a, and the long decay time in the scale of seconds is a strong evidence of ionic motion. Since the measurements are performed under dark conditions, without photo-generated charges, the measured current is ascribed to the transient motion of the mobile ions in the perovskite films.
 Fig. 4  (a) Transient ionic current for extracting mobile ion concentration within perovskite films with different MAI loading times. (i) The ions are separated at built-in potential Vbi; (ii) the diffusion of ions at a positive bias Vbias which compensates the Vbi; and (iii) redistribution of the ions at the Vbi after releasing the positive Vbias, and the corresponding current is recorded. All the measurements are performed under dark conditions. (b) Relationship of the extracted mobile ion concentration within the perovskite film with the MAI loading time. The inset shows the unit cell of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal; a is the lattice parameter. 
Using  (where n is the ion concentration, t is the time, I is the current density, e is the elementary charge and d is the thickness of the perovskite film), one can estimate the mobile ion concentration in the perovskite film from the transient ionic current.37 And the calculated ion concentrations with respect to different MAI loading times are shown in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that the mobile ion concentration with the MAI loading time follows a trend: the mobile ion concentration first decreases from 7.2 × 1016 cm−3 to the smallest value of 1.8 × 1016 cm−3 as the MAI loading time increases from 0 s to 60 s. It then increases to 1.7 × 1017 cm−3 when the MAI loading time further increases to 180 s. The magnitude of the mobile ion concentration is in good agreement with the previous reports.37–39 Interestingly, we note that the device efficiencies with respect to the MAI loading time as shown in Fig. 1d follow an opposite trend, the device with smaller ion concentration has higher photovoltaic performance.
To verify the extracted concentration values, we further calculate the atomic concentration of MA+ and I− in the perovskite crystal. As displayed in inset of Fig. 4b, the unit cell of MAPbI3 has one MA and three I atoms. Since the lattice parameter a = 6.27 Å,40 the volume of the unit cell is V = a3 = 2.46 × 10−22 cm3. Therefore, the atomic concentration of MA and I is 1/V = 4.1 × 1021 cm−3 and 3/V = 1.22 × 1022 cm−3, respectively. It is about five orders of magnitude higher than the mobile ion concentration extracted from the transient ionic current, indicating the rationality of our measurements.
It has been shown that photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) is a powerful technique to probe defects within the sub-bandgap region in semiconducting materials.41,42Fig. 5 shows the PDS results of bare perovskite films deposited on quartz with different MAI loading times. It is clearly shown that the sub-bandgap absorption below 1.5 eV in the perovskite film prepared with 60 s MAI loading time is the smallest among those of the samples. Meanwhile, the similar sub-bandgap absorption between perovskite films prepared with 0 s and 120 s MAI loading times indicates a similar defect density. These results are in good agreement with the trend of the mobile ion concentration determined by transient ionic current. This reinforces our finding that the difference in processing conditions induce different amounts of mobile ions in the perovskite films and thus influence the photovoltaic performance of the devices.

2.5 Correlation between mobile ion concentration and device performance
According to the above results, as shown in Fig. 6a, a correlation between device efficiency and mobile ion concentration in the perovskite films is established. It is clearly shown that the device efficiency is strongly dependent on the mobile ion concentration. The PCE of perovskite solar cells significantly drops by more than 3 times with increasing the mobile ion concentration from 2 × 1016 cm−3 to 1 × 1017 cm−3. Besides the widely reported morphological and recombination effects, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to demonstrate the mobile ion concentration dependent performance of perovskite solar cells.
 Fig. 6  (a) Correlation between the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells and the mobile ion concentration. (b) PCE over time for perovskite solar cells fabricated with different MAI loading times. (c) Correlation between the shelf-life of perovskite solar cells and the mobile ion concentration. (d) Relative steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films prepared with different MAI loading times. (e) Transient photocurrent of perovskite solar cells with different mobile ion concentrations. 
Different from the reported device performance dependence on traps and bimolecular recombination, interestingly, these ion populated perovskite devices still have excellent Voc and FF, but a few times lower Jsc. We speculated that the origin of large reduction of the Jsc with increasing the mobile ion concentration has two possibilities: (1) the mobile ions in the perovskite layer would increase the non-radiative recombination of the photo-generated charge carriers and thus reduce the Jsc and PCE. According to the previous report, the relative non-radiative losses of charge carriers can be probed by the difference in photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the perovskite films.43 Therefore, we conducted the steady-state PL measurements on perovskite films prepared with different MAI loading times. As illustrated in Fig. 6d, the PL spectra of perovskite prepared with 0 s, 120 s and 180 s MAI loading times indeed have lower intensity (about half) compared with the perovskite films prepared with 60 s and 90 s MAI loading times, supporting that the mobile ions would induce stronger non-radiative losses of photo-generated charge carriers. Therefore, herein, the reduction of the Jsc and PCE of devices with a larger amount of mobile ions can be ascribed to the strong non-radiative losses of the photo-generated charge carriers. (2) The mobile ions in perovskite films would introduce potential barriers across the thin film, which hinder the transport process of the photo-generated charge carriers and thereby reduce the Jsc and PCE of the devices. As shown in Fig. 6e, the device with lower ion concentration has a faster decay of the transient photocurrent than the device with higher ion concentration, indicating that the mobile ions in perovskite films would affect the charge carrier transport properties. This requires further detailed investigations on probing both electron and hole mobility to confirm this hypothesis.
In addition, it is found that the stability of perovskite solar cells is also largely affected by the residual mobile ions. During the stability measurements, the devices were stored in a dry box with humidity about 40–50% under ambient light. Details of the stability measurements can be found in the Experimental section. Fig. 6b depicts the evolution of the PCE of the perovskite solar cells with different MAI loading times over a period up to 1800 hours. We note that the devices with 60 s and 90 s MAI loading times show the highest stability. The efficiencies drop to 60% of the initial value after about 1700 hours. On the other hand, the devices with 0 s, 120 s and 180 s MAI loading times have poorer stability. The efficiencies drop to 40% of the initial value within 400 hours.
To further analyze the stability evolution, the relationship between the device shelf-life and the mobile ion concentration is summarized in Fig. 6c. Hereby, the shelf-life is defined as the time that the efficiency drops to 70% of the initial value. We find that the shelf-life follows a similar trend to the PCE against the mobile ion concentration. The trend can be divided into three parts. In region I, devices with the mobile ion concentration below 0.5 × 1017 cm−3 exhibit a relatively better device efficiency and longer shelf-life. However, both drop significantly when the mobile ion concentration increases to the range between 0.5 × 1017 cm−3 and 1 × 1017 cm−3 in region II. Further increasing the ion concentration will keep the device PCE and shelf-life at relatively low values as shown in the region III.
It is believed that the mobile ions in the perovskite film could destroy the stoichiometry of the crystal especially at the contact, leading to self-doping of the perovskite films.24 In order to seek evidence of the structural deformation of the aged devices, we studied the compositional evolution before and after the shelf-life tests by XRD measurements. For the XRD samples before the shelf-life tests, we deposited perovskite films with different MAI loading times on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. For the samples after the shelf-life studies, we peeled off the Au electrode from the devices and performed XRD on the active area (see ESI Fig. S5†). As shown in Fig. S6,† the intensities of PbI2 peaks at 12.7° in all aged devices become higher. The intensity ratio of PbI2 and perovskite for each sample before and after the shelf-life tests is summarized in Fig. S7a,† indicating the decomposition of the perovskite during the shelf-life studies. In order to analyze the increased PbI2 content, we re-plot the increased PbI2/perovskite intensity ratio as shown in Fig. S7b,† according to the following equation:  
Interestingly, the trend of the increased PbI2/perovskite intensity ratio against the MAI loading time is the same as the mobile ion concentration as shown in Fig. 4b. Since all the devices are encapsulated and stored under the same conditions, the variation of the increased PbI2 content is ascribed to the motion of the ions "within the active layer during the device operation. Based on these results and analysis, we conclude that a large amount of ions moving through the perovskite films would facilitate the degradation of the perovskite to PbI2, which is in good agreement with the previous literature reports.34,37 Furthermore, we have compared the EQE results of the devices before and after the shelf-life measurements. As shown in Fig. S8,† it is clearly shown that the EQE of the devices with high mobile ion concentration dropped more significantly after the shelf-life measurements compared with that of the device with low mobile ion concentration. It is worth noting that, different from the device degradation caused by environmental effects, ion induced degradation cannot be avoided by encapsulation. It is strongly dependent on the mobile ion concentration of the perovskite film. Therefore, strategies for modifying the compositional stability and reducing the excess mobile ion concentration play an important role in achieving highly stable photovoltaic devices.
3 Conclusions
To conclude, we have systematically investigated the impact of mobile ion concentration on the photovoltaic performance and stability of planar perovskite solar cells. We find that the amount of mobile ions in the perovskite films depends on the perovskite film preparation conditions (MAI loading time on PbI2 films during a two-step spin-coating process). Besides the widely reported morphological and charge recombination effects, we find that the excess mobile ions have detrimental effects on the photovoltaic performance. By measuring the transient ionic current, we have extracted the mobile ion concentration in an order of 1016 cm−3 to 1017 cm−3. The result is in good agreement with the defect density probed by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS). We find that devices with mobile ion concentration lower than 0.5 × 1017 cm−3 exhibit better device efficiency and stability. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and transient photocurrent measurements show that the mobile ions increase the non-radiative recombination of the charge carriers and reduce the charge carrier transporting properties, resulting in the reduction of the device performance. Microscopically, XRD results on aged devices support that the mobile ions accelerate the decomposition of perovskite to PbI2. This work demonstrates the important role of mobile ions in the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells, which would provide insight into the understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanism.
4 Experimental section
4.1 Materials
Most chemicals such as lead iodide (PbI2), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and anhydrous 2-propanol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Al4083) and CH3NH3I were purchased from Clevios and Lumtec, respectively.
4.2 Device fabrication
ITO glasses were cleaned with deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 15 minutes each and then dried in an oven. Before device fabrication, the ITO glasses were treated in a UV ozone cleaner for 20 min. Afterward, the PEDOT:PSS layer was deposited onto the ITO surface by spin-coating at a spin speed of 4000 rpm for 40 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 minutes in air. The perovskite film was deposited by a two-step spin-coating method with different MAI loading times as reported in our previous work.31 First, the PbI2 solution (462 mg mL−1 in DMF) was coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 70 °C for 10 minutes. Then the CH3NH3I solution (35 mg mL−1 in IPA) was dropped onto the PbI2 film and allowed to stand for different times from 0 s to 180 s and then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s. Subsequently, the perovskite films were covered with a Petri dish on a hot plate and 15 μL DMF solvent was added at the edge of the Petri dish for solvent annealing at 100 °C for 1 hour. Finally, fullerene C60 (20 nm), 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP: 5 nm) and an Au electrode (80 nm) were deposited onto the perovskite films by thermal evaporation. The deposition and annealing processes of perovskite films were sequentially performed inside a nitrogen filled glovebox. The active area of the solar cell was 0.1 cm2.
4.3 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D2 Phaser instrument using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation to investigate the composition profile of perovskite films prepared with different MAI loading times. For the samples after shelf-life tests, the Au electrodes were peeled off from the devices with tapes (see the photographs in the ESI, Fig. S4†). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL30 FEG) was employed to characterize the morphology of perovskite films.
The current–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. To evaluate the recombination process in perovskite solar cells, light intensity dependent J–V characteristics were studied at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 under the illumination with various light intensities ranging from 100 mW cm−2 to 1.4 mW cm−2. In order to identify the mobile ion concentration in the perovskite film, transient ionic current was employed. An external forward bias (at the Voc point) was applied to the devices for 1 minute without illumination, followed by releasing the voltage to 0 V and recording the current as a function of time for another 60 s. All the measurements were performed under dark conditions. For the stability measurements, all the devices were stored inside a dry box with humidity around 40–50% under ambient light. And the devices were taken out to complete the J–V characteristics at set intervals. The shelf-life of perovskite solar cells studied in this work was defined as the time when the efficiencies dropped to 70% of the initial value. For the photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements, perovskite films with different MAI loading times were deposited on quartz substrates. Monochromatic light chopped at 13 Hz as the pump beam was applied to shine onto the samples. Meanwhile, a probe laser was placed on the perpendicular side and a position sensitive sensor connected with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research, Model SR830) is placed on the opposite side to detect the deflection signals. For the transient photocurrent measurements, the devices were connected to a 50 Ω input terminal. A laser pulse (532 nm and 6 ns) was applied to perturb the devices.
