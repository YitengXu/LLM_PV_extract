    , Accepted 31st May 2013First published on 3rd June 2013AbstractA wet-chemical method for increasing the number of quantum dots (QDs) per unit surface area of TiO2 was developed. High density QD surface coating was induced by a surface charge controlled SILAR method, which led to a sixfold increase in photocurrent density from 2.15 mA cm−2 to 15.03 mA cm−2 in a QD-sensitized solar cell based on a Hg-doped PbS sensitized 2.4 μm-thick TiO2 film.
Quantum dot (QD) sensitized solar cells have been extensively studied in recent years due to their potential to surpass the conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, which is because most of the optically active QD materials have higher absorption coefficients than organic dyes and multiple exciton generation (MEG) effect as well.1–3 Very recently, remarkable achievements have been reported, where a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.6% with an unprecedentedly high photocurrent density of 30 mA cm−2 was demonstrated using Hg-doped PbS (PbS:Hg) QDs.4 Meanwhile, PCEs around 10–12% were reported using a non-organic dye such as the organolead halide perovskite sensitizer.5–7
One of the most beneficial optoelectronic properties of QDs is the high absorption coefficient ranging from ca. 104 to 105 cm−1 in the visible wavelength region,8 which is more than one order of magnitude higher than the conventional ruthenium based dye (ca. 2 × 103).9 As a result, a much higher light harvesting efficiency can be achieved even with a very thin TiO2 layer. However, most of the reported QD-sensitized solar cells were based on relatively thick TiO2 films (>10 μm) since QD hardly covered all the TiO2 surface.4,10,11 Thus a lot of efforts have been made to increase the number of QD per unit surface area of TiO2 using chemical bath deposition,12 successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR),4 spin assisted SILAR,13 linker assisted assembly3 and electrostatic adsorption of colloidal QDs.14 However, the problem has not been resolved.
The SILAR method has been frequently used to form QD on the TiO2 surface because of the facile and relatively fast procedure. Various metal chalcogenide QDs such as CdS,15 CdSe,16 PbS,17 and PbS:Hg4 were deposited using SILAR. However, electron microscopic data showed that the deposited QD were sparsely deposited on the TiO2 surface. To increase the density of the coated QD, a new methodology is required. Since the SILAR method is based on sequential adsorption and reaction of ions on the solid TiO2 surface, interfacial interaction between the QD precursor ions and the TiO2 surface should be carefully considered.
Here we report a novel approach to increase the density of QDs on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface by means of control of the TiO2 surface charge during the SILAR procedure. For deposition of PbS:Hg QD, 0.1 M Pb(NO3)2 and 6 mM HgCl2 aqueous solution was used as the cation sources and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution was used as the anion source. For the control of the surface charge of TiO2, 1 M triethanolamine (TEA) was added to the cationic precursor solution. Aqueous polysulfide solution composed of 1 M Na2S, 1 M S and 0.3 M CsOH was used as a redox electrolyte and Cu2S formed on a brass sheet was used as a counter electrode.

Fig. 1 compares UV-Vis spectra of PbS:Hg QD adsorbed TiO2 films prepared from the precursor solution with and without TEA. Compared to the weak absorption intensity in the absence of TEA (Fig. 1(a)), a strong absorption intensity is observed after addition of TEA (Fig. 1(b)), which indicates that the presence of TEA increases the number of the deposited QD. The absorption intensity increases upon increasing the coating cycle (dipping in anion solution followed by dipping in cation solution denotes one coating cycle) when TEA is present, while almost no improvement in the absorption intensity is observed in the absence of TEA. This indicates that the PbS:Hg QD formed after dipping in sulfur anion solution seems to be unstable when it is dipped in the non-TEA cation solution to start the second cycle, whereas the deposited QD is quite stable from the repeated coating cycle in the presence of TEA. It should be noted that the most serious problem is bleaching of the TiO2 films thinner than 4 μm compared to rather thicker TiO2 films (>4 μm)4 during the cation adsorption following anion coating in the absence of TEA. This can also be confirmed by visual inspection (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Based on our experiment, the ca. 2 μm-thick TiO2 film is completely bleached while coating in non-TEA cation solution due to the strong oxidizing property of Hg2+ ions. In the case of presence of TEA, the film is less bleached, which indicates that TEA is likely to protect the oxidative reaction. This underlines that a strong interaction between QD and the TiO2 surface is created by TEA.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis absorption spectra of TiO2 films with PbS:Hg QD as a function of the SILAR coating cycle, depending on the (a) absence and (b) presence of TEA in the cationic precursor solution. Insets show the schematic SILAR coating process of PbS:Hg QDs on the surface of TiO2. Dipping was performed for 1 min and the electrode was rinsed with DI water after each dipping. The thickness of TiO2 was 2.86 μm without TEA and 2.46 μm with TEA. 

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of PbS:Hg QD adsorbed TiO2 nanoparticles. As expected from UV-Vis spectra, QDs are less densely adsorbed on the TiO2 surface in the absence of TEA (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, in the presence of TEA, QDs are more densely deposited as shown in Fig. 2(b). The amount of adsorbed QDs is estimated to be 2.31 × 104 μm−2 and 5.00 × 104 μm−2 without and with TEA, respectively, by counting the number of QDs in the Gaussian box (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). The density of QD adsorption is two times higher in the presence of TEA than that in the absence of TEA. The absorption intensity is, however, more than two times as can be seen in Fig. 1, which underlines that the optical property of the QD formed from coating in the presence of TEA is much better than that of the QD formed from coating in the absence of TEA. This is evident when comparing the optical absorbance and the amount of adsorbed QD in the case of absence of TEA, where almost no improvement in optical absorbance is observed despite an increase in the number of adsorbed QDs from 0.95 × 104 μm−2 to 1.42 × 104 μm−2 for 2 and 4 coating cycles, respectively (Fig. S3(a) and (c), ESI†). On the other hand, in the presence of TEA, the optical absorbance increases proportionally as the QD adsorption amount increases from 1.76 × 104 μm−2 for 2 coating cycles to 3.96 × 104 μm−2 for 4 coating cycles (Fig. S3(b) and (d), ESI†). A closer investigation of the TEM micrograph reveals that the average size of the deposited QD becomes larger (ca. 2.6–2.7 nm without TEA and ca. 3.7–5.7 nm with TEA at the end of 6 cycles) upon coating in the presence of TEA, which is likely to decrease the band gap energy and thereby lead to a shift of onset absorption to longer wavelengths. This is consistent with the UV-Vis spectral result as shown in Fig. 1(b).
 Fig. 2  TEM micrographs of PbS:Hg QD adsorbed TiO2 nanoparticles (a) without and (b) with TEA in the cationic precursor solution. Dipping was conducted for 1 min and the electrode was washed with DI water after each dipping. The thickness of TiO2 was 2.9 μm without TEA and 2.2 μm with TEA, respectively. The SILAR coating cycle was 6. (c) and (d) show a schematic representation of the mechanism of formation of PbS:Hg QDs on the TiO2 surface. The TiO2 surface was charged (c) positively in the absence of TEA and (d) negatively in the presence of TEA. The density of the deposited QD was (c) low due to repulsive interaction but (d) high due to attractive interaction. 
The role of the weak base TEA is to control the TiO2 surface charge. Care should be taken in selection of the base material because mercury oxide is precipitated in the presence of a base such as NaOH. TEA is selected since no precipitation occurs. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the schematic representation of the formation of PbS:Hg QDs, where the presence of TEA changes the pH of the cationic precursor solution from 3.2 to 8.5. Point of zero charge (pzc) is the pH value where a solid material in solution shows zero net electrical charge on its surface. In other words, the surface of the solid material in solution is positively charged when the pH of the solution is lower than pzc, and negatively charged when the pH of the solution is higher than pzc. Considering the pzc of TiO2, which is reported to be ca. 6,18 the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles is positively charged in acidic solution (without TEA, pH = 3.2) and negatively charged in basic solution (with TEA, pH = 8.5). Consequently, the negatively charged TiO2 surface in basic solution with TEA can encourage adsorption of a large amount of Pb and Hg cations. Moreover, strong ionic interaction is expected due to attractive force. In contrast to the basic environment, small amount of deposition and weak interaction are anticipated due to repulsive force under the acidic conditions because of the absence of TEA.

Fig. 3 compares the photovoltaic performance of PbS:Hg QD-sensitized solar cells in the absence and presence of TEA, where QD is deposited over 6 coating cycles. The photocurrent density (JSC) increases significantly from 2.15 to 15.03 mA cm−2, corresponding to more than sixfold enhancement. From Fig. 3(b), it can be observed that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is preponderantly higher in the entire wavelength for the TiO2 film coated with PbS:Hg QD in the presence of TEA. The drawback is the lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) with poor fill factor. The lowered VOC by the coating in the presence of TEA is likely to be due to an increased recombination resulting from the increased surface state of QDs and/or catalytic properties of PbS QD as pointed out in the previous reports,17,19,20 in which the recombination resistance was found to decrease by more than one order of magnitude as the SILAR coating cycle increased. An enormous increase in JSC is similarly observed for different coating cycles as can be seen in Table 1 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Lowered VOCs are commonly observed for all the QDs coated in the presence of TEA, compared to the VOCs for the QDs coated without TEA. The overall conversion efficiency at AM 1.5 G one sun illumination is improved more than threefold from 0.52% (without TEA, 6 cycle) to 2.49% (with TEA, 2 cycle) in spite of the lowered VOC and the deteriorated fill factor, which is mainly attributed to significantly improved JSC. Further experiments were carried out to see the effects of concentration and duration time in the case of absence of TEA. As can be seen in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†), no significant increase in photocurrent and voltage is observed in spite of increasing the dipping time and concentration. These results also strongly support that the surface charge control is crucial to enhance the amount of the adsorbed QDs on the TiO2 surface.

In this study, we developed a novel and facile way to increase the coverage of QDs on the TiO2 surface. To increase the amount of QD and to enhance the chemical interaction between QD and the oxide surface, the oxide surface charge should be adjusted to counter the ionic species to be deposited on the oxide surface. This was simply possible by controlling the pH of the coating solution, where the point of zero charge of oxide should be considered. We propose here that the developed method is believed to be applicable to many other oxides, which is under investigation.
