    , Accepted 2nd March 2020First published on 2nd March 2020AbstractThe necessity of Earth-abundant low-cost catalysts with activity similar to noble metals such as platinum is indispensable in order to realize the production of hydrogen through electrolysis of water. Herein, we report a relatively low-cost NiAg0.4 3D porous nanocluster catalyst whose activity matches with that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C in 1 M KOH solution. The catalyst is designed on the principle of creating an interface between a metal having a positive Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption and a metal of negative Gibbs energy based on the volcano plot, to tune the Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption near zero for enhanced hydrogen evolution. The synthesized NiAg0.4 3D porous nanoclusters are comprised of nanoparticles of lateral dimension ∼50 nm forming a 3D porous network with pores of 10 nm–80 nm. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image reveals the epitaxial growth of Ag (200) on the Ni (111) plane leading to the creation of abundant interfaces between the Ni and Ag lattices. The catalyst needs a low overpotential of 40 mV@10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits a high specific activity of 0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA) at an overpotential (η) of 45 mV which matches with the specific activity of Pt/C 20% wt. catalyst (0.1 mA cm−2@η = 26 mV). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni–Ag interface furnishes a pathway with a reduced Gibbs energy of adsorption of −0.04 eV, thus promoting enhanced hydrogen evolution. In summary, this study reveals excellent HER activity at the Ni–Ag interface.
Introduction
The booming energy demands and excessive pollution due to the use of carbon-based fuels have compelled mankind to expedite the search for renewable energy sources and fuels. Hydrogen is one of the candidates for sustainable energy management for the future. Hydrogen can act as an energy carrier analogous to batteries to store the excess energy harvested from renewable sources like solar and wind, and also can be directly used as a fuel for energy supply. Therefore, low-cost and less energy-intensive production of hydrogen through electrolysis of water is critical to realize sustainable and pollution-free use of hydrogen as a fuel. However, currently, the cost of production of hydrogen through electricity is much higher in comparison with natural gas reforming primarily due to large overpotentials needed for electrolysis. In this context, development of highly active catalysts with low overpotentials, which are inexpensive and Earth-abundant, is critical for commercial viability.
The activity and efficiency of the catalysts are pH-dependent. Although numerous studies of acid electrolysis have been reported, the high cost of a proton exchange membrane and sluggish electron-transfer kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium hinder its feasible application.1 Furthermore, the reported Earth-abundant catalysts for the OER are unstable in the acidic medium2 compared to those in the alkaline medium, which is an important criterion for real-life application. In addition, alkaline electrolysis is favorable owing to broad reactant availability and product purity.3 Therefore, to act on the sluggish kinetics of the OER and stable operation of the catalysts, alkaline electrolysis is preferred. Nevertheless, alkaline electrolysis comes with inherent challenges. The hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium involves a water dissociation step (H2O + e−1 ↔ Hads + OH−1) unlike the discharge of protons in an acid (H+ + e−1 ↔ Hads) due to which the HER activity in alkaline medium is two to three orders of magnitude lower than that in the acidic medium.4 This is evident from the lower activity of Pt in alkaline electrolytes.5 Although Pt and its alloys6,7 have shown remarkable catalytic activity, their high cost, low abundance and sensitivity to poisoning for sulfides and chlorine limit their wide-scale application.5
In the past, alloy catalysts such as a boron-doped RhFe alloy,8 a NiMo alloy in holey graphene,9 Pt3Co nanoparticles,10 IrAg nanotubes,11 and PtNiCo ternary alloy nano frame crystals,7,12 are reported to exhibit remarkable activity for the HER. However, these catalysts are active in acidic medium and few of the reported catalysts in the basic medium12,13 are less active compared to Pt. In addition, the long-term stability of these catalysts is a concern to be addressed for commercial applications. Therefore, it is critical to develop catalysts from Earth-abundant elements with activity similar to platinum-based catalysts for alkaline electrolysis.
In this context, the fundamental understanding of the catalytic activity is essential. In the case of metals, the activity is primarily determined by the electronic structure. The coupling between the adsorbate valence states and the d states of the metal influences the adsorption energy which determines the activity of the catalyst.14 The position of the d states relative to the Fermi energy determines the coupling, where the element with the d state nearer to the Fermi energy exhibits stronger interaction with the adsorbate.15 For the HER, the Gibbs energy of adsorption should be close to zero for the best catalytic performance according to Sabatier's principle, which is evident from the high activity of Pt (ΔGads ≈ −0.1 eV).16 As revealed from previous studies elements such as nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and tungsten have negative adsorption energies (stronger adsorption) while copper, silver, and bismuth have positive energies of adsorption (weaker adsorption).17 In the case of metals, mixing two or more metals can alter the d band center leading to the tuning of the adsorption energies to promote the catalytic activity.18–20 From the above observations, we can argue that doping elements with negative adsorption energies with the elements with positive Gibbs energies of adsorption could generate alloys with adsorption energies near zero.
Among the Earth-abundant metals, a nickel-based catalyst is a preferred choice. Nickel has a Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption near −0.28 eV (ref. 16) which is one of the best among the Earth-abundant metals. Alloying nickel with metals with the positive energy of adsorption is expected to boost it's HER performance. In this study, we chose Ag as the alloying element which has a positive energy of adsorption (ΔG ≈ 0.5 eV). However, Ni and Ag are thermally immiscible in the bulk.21 Therefore, the NiAg alloy nanoparticle synthesis through general routes is not easily achieved. Furthermore, the HER activity of the previously reported NiAg alloy13 is not impressive (η10 ∼ 300 mV). As an alternative, interface engineering of nanostructures is widely regarded as one of the ways to enhance the catalytic activity of nanostructures.6,19,22 Inspired by this, we chose to synthesize NiAg0.4 3D porous nanoclusters with epitaxial interfaces between Ni and Ag. The NiAg0.4 3D porous nanoclusters (hereafter referred to as NiAg0.4 3DPNC) were synthesized by a hydrothermal process followed by thermal reduction under a hydrogen atmosphere. The NiAg0.4 3DPNC comprise nanoparticles of lateral dimension ∼50 nm forming a 3D porous network with pores of 10 nm–80 nm dimensions as revealed by transmission electron microscopy images. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image reveals the epitaxial growth of Ag (200) on the Ni (111) plane leading to the creation of abundant interfaces between the Ni and Ag lattices. The NiAg0.4 3DPNC are highly active towards hydrogen evolution requiring a low overpotential of 40 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution with a Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec−1 whose activity matches with that of the Pt-based catalysts in alkaline medium. The interface between Ni and Ag furnishes a lower energy pathway for the hydrogen evolution reaction as revealed by the density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the HER activity of the NiAg 3DPNC for various Ni/Ag ratios exhibits a trend that closely relates to the interface area between Ni and Ag further uncovering the role of the Ni–Ag interface for the HER activity. Furthermore, the NiAg0.4 3DPNC exhibit a high specific activity of 0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA) at an overpotential of 45 mV and exhibits excellent durability as observed from both the chronoamperometry test for 80 hours and 5000 cyclic voltammetry sweeps. In conclusion, NiAg0.4 3DPNC have the potential to replace Pt-based catalysts for the HER in alkaline electrolytes and this design principle opens the door to the synthesis of highly active catalysts through the creation of interfaces between elements of varying degrees of hydrogen adsorption.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma Aldrich), silver nitrate (AgNO3, 0.1 M, Sigma Aldrich), urea (NH2CONH2, Sigma Aldrich), ethylene glycol (Sigma Aldrich), Pt/C 20 wt% (Fuel cell research) and Nafion (5%, Sigma Aldrich) were used without further treatment.
Synthesis of NiAgx 3D porous nanoclusters
NiAgx (0 < x < 4.5) 3D porous nanoclusters were synthesized through the hydrothermal process. In the first step, 1 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 5 mmol urea were dissolved in 10 ml DI water. To this solution, various volumes of 0.1 M AgNO3 were added ranging from 1 ml to 8 ml corresponding to Ni to Ag molar ratios from 10:1 to 10:8. For the synthesis of NiAg2.75 and NiAg4.42 nanoclusters 0.5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2 and 2.5 mmol urea were mixed in 5 ml DI water with 10 ml and 15 ml of 0.1 M AgNO3 solution respectively. To this solution, 10 ml of ethylene glycol and was added and further with DI water to make the overall solution to 30 ml. This solution was transferred to a 45 ml Teflon coated stainless steel autoclave and heated in an electric oven at 120 °C for 9 hours. The formed black colored product was washed 3 times with DI water and ethanol through centrifugation and dried in an electric oven at 60 °C for 12 hours. The synthesized powder was later transferred to a quartz boat and annealed in a tube furnace with hydrogen gas flow with a ramping rate of 3 °C per minute to 400 °C for 2 hours. The pristine Ni nanoclusters were synthesized by a similar process but without the addition of AgNO3 and pristine Ag nanoparticles were synthesized without the addition of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) to identify the phase of the synthesized samples. The morphology of the samples was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, 7600F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F). The composition of the sample was estimated using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (PerkinElmer Optima 8000) in which average of three measurements was considered for the estimation of concentration of each element. To confirm the uniform distribution of individual elements, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), elemental mapping, and high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were performed using a TEM (JEOL JEM 2100, 200 kV). The surface composition of the samples was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Theta Probe electron spectrometer.
Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical measurements were done using Solartron analytical equipment (Model1470E). For the powder samples, 5 mg of powder was dispersed in 950 μl of isopropanol (IPA) and 50 μl of Nafion solution and ultra-sonicated for 1 hour. This uniformly dispersed slurry was drop cast on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE-3 mm) to sufficiently cover the electrode surface and allowed to dry. To eliminate the effect of loading variation on the electrochemical characterization, overpotentials to reach 10 mA cm−2 at various catalyst loadings were estimated. The tests for HER performance were conducted using a typical 3 electrode system with Hg/HgO as the reference electrode glassy carbon electrode with the sample as the working electrode, and graphite electrode as a counter electrode in 1 M KOH. The HER performance was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from −0.7 V to −1.7 V at a low scan speed of 2 mV per second to eliminate the capacitive current during the measurement. The measured potential was converted to the potential vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the relation Evs. RHE = Evs. Hg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059* pH. The durability of the catalyst was tested by a chronoamperometry test by applying a constant voltage of −76 mV vs. RHE for 80 hours and measuring the current during the process. Furthermore, 5000 cyclic voltammetry sweeps between −0.9 V and −1.7 V versus the Hg/HgO reference electrode were conducted to investigate the durability of the catalyst.
The electrochemically active surface area estimation for catalysts other than Pt was done by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. CV scans were conducted between −0.15 V and −0.25 V versus the Hg/HgO reference electrode with scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV s−1. The difference in the current density (janodic − jcathodic) was plotted against the scan rate. The slope of the plot equals twice the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which gives a good estimate of the ECSA. The roughness factor was calculated by dividing the Cdl by specific capacitance (assumed as 40 μF cm−2). The ECSA normalized current was obtained by dividing the current density corresponding to the geometric area by the calculated roughness factor. The ECSA estimation for the Pt/C catalyst was done by the hydrogen underpotential deposition method. CV scans were carried between −0.924 V and 0.276 V vs. the Hg/HgO electrode at 50 mV s−1. The area under the curve excluding the double layer capacitance in the hydrogen adsorption and desorption range was calculated to estimate the roughness factor for Pt/C assuming monolayer adsorption of hydrogen23 on Pt with a charge density of 210 μC cm−2.
EIS measurements were done in an Autolab PGSTAT302 (Eco Chemie, The Netherlands) potentiostat by varying the frequency from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The solution resistance Rs was estimated from the x-intercept of the plot of −Z′′ vs. Z′ in the high-frequency range which was later used for iR correction. The charge transfer resistance was estimated from the diameter of the circle of the −Z′′ vs. Z′ plot.
DFT calculations
All of the calculations were performed using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) methods based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).24 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe electron–ion interaction. While the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional within a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed, a 400 eV cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set was used for the valence electrons. Self-consistent field (SCF) calculations were performed with an energy and force convergence criterion of 10−6 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled using the 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh in structure optimization for Ni and Ag. To avoid the interactions between two adjacent periodic images, the vacuum thickness was set to be ∼20 Å. In all cases, spin-polarized considerations were taken into account.
The Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) of hydrogen adsorption on metal-doped Ni (111) surfaces was given by ΔGH = ΔEnH + ΔEZPE − TΔSH(1)where ΔEZPE and ΔSH are the difference in zero-point energy and entropy between the adsorbed state and the gas phase, respectively. ΔEnH is the chemisorption energy of the nth H atom, which was calculated from: ΔEnH = EM+nH − EM+(n−1)H − ½EH2(2)where EM+nH and EM+(n−1)H are the total energy of metal doped Ni (111)/Ag (111) surfaces with n-th and n − 1-th H atoms adsorption, respectively. EH2 is the total energy of hydrogen molecule in the gas phase. The calculated frequencies of H2 gas are 4345 cm−1, 58 cm−1, and 42 cm−1, which agree well with previous studies.25,26 The ΔEZPE is calculated to be 0.04 eV for H adsorption on surfaces, which do not differ notably with the adsorption sites and the adatom. And the entropy of hydrogen adsorption can then be written as: ΔSH = ½SH2, where SH2 is the entropy of molecule hydrogen in the gas phase at a temperature of 300 K with a pressure of 1 bar.27 To sum up, the value of ΔEZPE − TΔSH is equal to 0.245 eV.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the synthesized samples
Samples with varying Ni/Ag ratios were synthesized by controlling the precursor ratios from 10:1 to 1:3. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) results listed in Table S1† reveal the concentration of Ni and Ag in different samples. Based on the ICP-OES results we name our samples as follows: Ni 3DPNC, NiAg0.13 3DPNC, NiAg0.25 3DPNC, NiAg0.34 3DPNC, NiAg0.40 3DPNC, NiAg0.44 3DPNC, NiAg0.6 3DPNC, NiAg0.95 3DPNC, NiAg2.75 3DPNC, NiAg4.42 3DPNC, and Ag NPs corresponding to the respective Ni/Ag ratios. Here, 3DPNC refers to 3D porous nanoclusters and NPs refer to nanoparticles. The phase of the synthesized samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis. For the black powder obtained from the hydrothermal synthesis, the X-ray diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.6°, and 77.6° are assigned to the (111), (200), (202), and (311) planes of cubic silver (PDF no. #01-087-0720), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1a. Smaller peaks at 23.9°, 33.63°, 41.30°, 59.8°, and 98.9° correspond to the (002), (110), (103), (300), and (410) planes of hexagonal Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O (PDF no. #00-022-0444), respectively. Thus, the sample from the hydrothermal synthesis consists of Ag and Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O as observed from the XRD studies. The Ag/Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O sample was then processed by thermal reduction under the flow of hydrogen at 400 °C in a tube furnace. The XRD peaks of the thermally reduced NiAg0.40 3DPNC at 44.5°, 52°, and 76.5° (Fig. 1b) are assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of cubic nickel (PDF no. #01-071-4654), which confirms the conversion of nickel hydroxide to nickel. The intensity of XRD peaks corresponding to Ag increased with an increase in the concentration of Ag in the samples as illustrated in Fig. S1a and b.† In this report, the chemical state and morphology of the NiAg0.40 3DPNC are primarily discussed due to their best electrocatalytic activity. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum for NiAg0.4 3DPNC (Fig. S2†) reveals characteristic Ni 3p and Ni 2p peaks of Ni and Ag 3s, Ag 3p and Ag 3d peaks of Ag. Further, the XPS core-level spectrum in the Ni 2p region (Fig. 1c) reveals the peaks at 852.5 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 869.7 eV (Ni 2p1/2) corresponding to the Ni (0) state.28 In addition, the peaks at 855.8 eV (Ni2+ 2p3/2) and 873.1 eV (Ni2+ 2p1/2) alongside the satellite peaks at 860.9 eV and 879.3 eV are the characteristic peaks of Ni2+.29 This indicates the partial oxidation of the surface nickel atoms. Furthermore, the Ag 3d spectrum (Fig. 1d) reveals peaks at 368.1 eV and 374.1 eV corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 with a spin-orbital splitting of 6 eV revealing the Ag (0) oxidation state of silver30 in the NiAg0.4 3DPNC.

The FESEM image (Fig. 2a) of Ag/Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O before thermal reduction shows nanoparticles attached to the nanosheets (Fig. 2a), which is also distinctly seen in the transmission electron microscopy image (Fig. 2b). The HRTEM image of the nanoparticles (Fig. 2c) reveals the d-spacing of 0.235 nm and 0.204 nm corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of cubic Ag (PDF no. #01-087-0720) respectively. Furthermore, the HRTEM image of the nanosheets reveals a d-spacing of 0.231 nm (Fig. S4c†) ascribed to the (200) plane of hexagonal Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O (PDF no. #00-022-0444). Thus, the unique structure of Ag/Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O in which Ag nanoparticles are attached to Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O nanosheets is revealed from HRTEM images. After the thermal reduction in hydrogen gas at 400 °C, hexagonal Ni(OH)2·2/3H2O transforms to cubic Ni, which leads to a change in the morphology of the samples to 3D porous nanoclusters as shown in Fig. 2d and e. The 3D porous nanocluster comprises nanoparticles of ∼50 nm (lateral dimension) and pores of nearly 10 nm to 80 nm as seen from HAADF-STEM (Fig. 2g) and FESEM images (Fig. 2d). Pristine nickel exhibits 3D porous nanocluster morphology similar to NiAg0.4 3DPNC (Fig. S3b†), while the pristine Ag forms nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as shown in Fig. S3a.†

Furthermore, the HRTEM image of NiAg0.4 3DPNC (Fig. 2f and Fig. S4a–b†) reveals the exposed (111) and (200) planes of Ag (PDF no. #01-087-0720) corresponding to the d-spacing of 0.235 nm and 0.204 nm, respectively. The measured angle between the (111) and (200) planes is 54.30°, which is close to the theoretical angle of 54.74°. Also, the adjacent region reveals the d-spacing of 0.204 nm and 0.180 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of Ni (PDF no. #01-071-4654), respectively, with an angle of 54.54° between them. A closer examination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) images (Fig. S4b†) reveals epitaxial growth of Ag (200) on the Ni (111) surface leading to the generation of abundant epitaxial interfaces between Ag and Ni lattices in the nanostructure. It is worth noting that the lattice parameters of Ag (200) and Ni (111) are very close viz. 0.204 nm for Ag (111) and 0.2035 for Ni (111). Also, as revealed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 2f) the growth of Ag (200) on Ni (111) is continuous and no abrupt distortions are observed in the lattice. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2j) exhibits rings corresponding to both Ni and Ag. The innermost ring is assigned to Ag (111) (PDF no. #01-087-0720), while the second ring from the center can be ascribed to either Ni (111) or Ag (200). The third ring corresponds to Ni (200) (PDF no. #01-071-4654), thus confirming the co-existence of Ni and Ag in the nanoclusters. Also, the HAADF-STEM image and STEM-EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. 2g–i) reveal the homogeneous distribution of Ni and Ag in the nanocluster.
HER activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC
The electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity of the synthesized catalysts was determined in a three-electrode cell consisting of Hg/HgO as the reference electrode, graphite electrode as the counter electrode and catalyst loaded glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode. All the measurements were performed in 1 M KOH solution at room temperature. The current densities reported in the following section are based on the geometric surface area of the electrodes. In the later sections, the specific activity based on the electrochemically active surface area is also discussed. Mass loading of the catalyst drastically affects the current density and can contribute to errors in the estimation of overpotential (η) across different samples.31 Therefore, we measured the variation of overpotential@10 mA cm−2 (η10) with different mass loadings for the synthesized samples and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). As observed from Fig. S5a,† for the synthesized catalysts, the η10 gradually decreased with an increase in the mass loading up to 2.5 mg cm−2. Thereafter, η10 remained constant. In contrast, in the case of commercial Pt/C, the decrease in η10 was not observed for mass loadings above 0.5 mg cm−2. Based on these outcomes, we used the mass loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 for all the samples to evaluate HER performance. Fig. S5b† illustrates the HER polarization curves (without iR correction) for various synthesized samples. The η10 for NiAg0.13 3DPNC (11.57% molar percentage of Ag) is 60 mV, which is lower than both pristine Ni 3DPNC (η10 = 132 mV) and Ag NPs (η10 = 280 mV) as depicted in Fig. 3a. On increasing the Ag concentration from 11.57% to 28.11%, the η10 gradually drops to 52 mV and 50 mV for NiAg0.25 3DPNC and NiAg0.34 3DPNC and reaches the lowest value of 45 mV for NiAg0.4 3DPNC. However, on further increasing the Ag content, η10 increases to 51 mV, 61 mV, 69 mV, 110 mV, and 140 mV for NiAg0.44 3DPNC, NiAg0.6 3DPNC, NiAg0.95 3DPNC, NiAg2.75 3DPNC, and NiAg4.42 3DPNC, respectively (Fig. S6a†). Thus, from the above results, we infer that the Ag content in the porous nanoclusters influences the catalytic activity and the NiAg0.4 3DPNC (28.11% Ag) shows the best activity. Furthermore, Fig. 3a and b show the HER activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC (with iR correction) in comparison with the state-of-the-art Pt/C, pristine Ni 3DPNC, and Ag NPs. NiAg0.4 3DPNC exhibit low η10 equal to 40 mV, which is very close to Pt/C (η10 = 28 mV) and significantly lower than that of pristine Ni 3DPNC (η10 = 132 mV) and Ag NPs (η10 = 280 mV). Furthermore, the Tafel slope of NiAg0.4 3DPNC equals 39.1 mV dec−1 similar to that of Pt/C (32.1 mV dec−1). The Tafel slope value of 39.1 mV dec−1 for NiAg0.4 3DPNC suggests that the HER occurs through the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, where electrochemical desorption is the rate-determining step.32,33 In contrast, the Tafel slopes of pristine Ni 3DPNC (86.9 mV dec−1) and Ag NPs (102 mV dec−1) are relatively high, which is indicative of their lower reaction kinetics. Encouraged by this, we also evaluated the HER activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. However, unlike their activity in alkaline solution, NiAg0.4 3DPNC show a higher η10 equal to 178 mV significantly larger than Pt/C (η10 = 22 mV) as observed from the polarization curves illustrated in Fig. S7.† This could be attributed to the high susceptibility of Ni to corrosion in the acidic environment.34

The activity of the catalyst primarily depends on two factors; firstly, the activity of the individual active site, and secondly the number of active sites. The activity of the individual catalytic sites gives profound insight into the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The intrinsic activity of the catalyst can be reasonably estimated from specific activity,35 which is computed by normalizing the geometric current density based on the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Herein, we evaluated the ECSA for the synthesized samples from double-layer capacitance. CV scans were conducted between −0.15 V and −0.25 V vs. the Hg/HgO reference electrode with scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV s−1 (Fig. S8a–c†). The plot of capacitive current (janodic − jcathodic) vs. the scan rate (Fig. 4a) was used to estimate the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which gives a good estimate of the ECSA. The roughness factor, which was computed by dividing the Cdl by the specific capacitance (40 μF cm−2), was used to calculate the ECSA normalized current for each sample.36 For the Pt/C catalyst, the hydrogen underpotential deposition method was used to estimate the roughness factor (Fig. S8d†). The hydrogen underpotential deposition method is more reliable and widely used for the estimation of the ECSA of Pt as it eliminates the contribution of capacitance arising from carbon in Pt/C.37 The calculated Cdl and roughness factor values of all the samples are listed in Table S2.† As revealed from Fig. 4c and d, the η@0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA) for NiAg0.4 3DPNC is 45 mV, which is very close to the η for Pt/C (26 mV@0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA)). In contrast, pristine Ni 3DPNC and Ag NPs require higher η viz. 177 mV and 313 mV (Fig. 4c and d), respectively, to achieve 0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA). Thus, the specific activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC matches with that of Pt/C and is superior to pristine Ni 3DPNC and Ag NPs. Furthermore, electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to investigate the charge transfer resistance of the synthesized samples. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 4b) at −1 V vs. Hg/HgO reveal charge transfer resistances in the following order: 29.6 Ω for Pt/C < 33.9 Ω for NiAg0.4 3DPNC < 114.5 Ω for Ni 3DPNC < 149.1 Ω for Ag NPs. Thus, NiAg0.4 3DPNC and Pt/C offer better charge transfer kinetics compared to pristine Ni 3DPNC and Ag NPs. The above results strongly indicate that the enhanced activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC may be arising from the synergistic effect of both Ni and Ag in the nanoclusters. Epitaxial interfaces may promote optimized hydrogen adsorption as reported previously for NiPS3/Ni2P heterojunctions.22 Therefore, to investigate the origin of the catalytic activity, density functional theory calculations were employed to estimate the Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption at the Ni–Ag interface.

DFT calculations
In order to explore the intrinsic property variation and determine the active site of the pristine Ni/Ag surface and the Ni–Ag interface, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were conducted. Ni and Ag belong to face-centered-cubic (fcc) structures that contain 4 atoms in a bulk unit cell. For Ni, the calculated lattice constants are a = b = c = 3.51 Å and the initial bond length dNi–Ni is 2.48 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental studies and other theoretical data. And for Ag, the calculated lattice constants are a = b = c = 4.16 Å and the initial bond length dAg–Ag is 2.94 Å.38,39
In this work, the Ni (111) and Ag (111) surfaces were used to investigate the HER performance. Because these surfaces have demonstrated the highest stability among all the low-index surfaces of the fcc metals in previous DFT studies40 and both Ni (111) and Ag (111) surfaces were observed in the HRTEM images. The top view and side view of a symmetric Ni (111) surface with a thickness of ∼1.2 nm are shown in Fig. S9a.† The top view and side view of a symmetric Ag (111) surface with a thickness of ∼0.7 nm are shown in Fig. S9c.† Since HRTEM images reveal an epitaxial interface between Ni and Ag, the following two systems were considered for DFT calculations: (i) Ag atoms adsorbed on the Ni (111) surface (Ag/Ni (111)) and (ii) Ni atoms adsorbed on the Ag (111) surface (Ni/Ag (111)). When Ag/Ni atoms adsorb on the Ni/Ag surface, the forming energies (Ef) at three positions viz. S1, S2, and S3 (Fig. S9b and d†) are calculated. The forming energy (Ef) is given by: Ef = Ex+y surface − Ey surface − Ex(3)where the Ex+y surface and Ey surface are the total energy of the surface with and without x adatom, while Ex is the energy of individual atoms in their stable solid phases, where x and y are Ni and Ag. As shown in Fig. S9e and f,† the calculated formation energies are −1.80/−2.02 eV, −2.11/−2.72 eV and −2.12/−2.73 eV for Ag/Ni adsorbed on the S1, S2, and S3 sites, respectively. The negative values of the forming energy indicate that the Ag/Ni adatom prefers to adsorb on the S3 site. Therefore, the S3 absorption structure was used during further research.
Various adsorption sites were investigated to identify the catalytically active sites, in which the most energetically preferable adsorption site was used to describe the related reactions. Due to the symmetry of surface geometry, there are three possible adsorption sites as shown in Fig. 5a and e. For the Ni (111) surface the ΔE at the S2 (−0.50 eV) and S3 (−0.49 eV) sites are more negative than S1 (0.08 eV), indicating that the S2 site is thermodynamically preferred for hydrogen adsorption. Similarly, for the Ag (111) surface, the ΔE at S2 (0.15 eV) and S3 (−0.16 eV) are much smaller than S1 (0.70 eV), indicating that the S3 site is thermodynamically preferred for hydrogen adsorption. The calculated results are in accordance with previous DFT studies.41

According to the thermodynamics, the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) could be a common criterion for evaluating the HER activity. For an optimal catalyst, the ΔGH should be close to zero. The HER free energy diagram for pristine Ni is illustrated in Fig. 5b. The ΔGH are 0.325 eV (S1), −0.258 eV (S2), and −0.248 eV (S3) for pristine Ni (111), which are very far from near zero ΔGH necessary for an advanced HER catalyst. The HER free energy diagrams for the Ag/Ni (111) interface are illustrated in Fig. 5d. Due to the change in the symmetry of surface geometry, the ΔGH for nine active sites is calculated as shown in Fig. 5c. The calculated ΔGH for the S2 site is −0.04 eV, which is close to the optimum value (0 eV). The ΔGH for S3 and S6 sites are −0.20 eV and −0.21 eV, respectively, indicating a small change in the ΔGH for these sites. In contrast, ΔGH for the S7 and S8 sites remain ∼0.26 eV. Interestingly, ΔGH for the Ag site is 1.11 eV, which is larger than those for all the sites. In summary, the adsorption of Ag on Ni (111) alters the ΔGH of the adjacent S2 site close to zero, while the remote sites (S3, S6, S7, and S8) are minimally affected. The H adsorption on S1, S4, and S5 sites is not stable and H moves to S6, S7, and S8 sites after relaxation.
In the case of the pristine Ag (111) surface and Ni/Ag (111) interface, the ΔGH values (Fig. 5e–h) exhibit a similar trend. For the pristine Ag (111) surface, ΔGH are 0.995 eV (S1), 0.446 eV (S2), and 0.441 eV (S3) (Fig. 5f). In contrast, the calculated ΔGH for the S2 site is 0.05 eV, which is close to the optimum value (0 eV). The ΔGH for S3 and S6 sites are ∼0.49 eV, which are slightly larger than that for pristine Ag. The ΔGH for Ni site, S7, and S8 sites are 0.39 eV, 0.45 eV, and 0.42 eV, respectively. Thus, the Ni adsorption on the Ag (111) surface alters the ΔGH of the adjacent S2 site close to zero, while the remote S3, S6, S7, and S8 sites are minimally affected. The H adsorption on the S1, S4, and S5 sites was found to be not stable where the H atom moves to the S6, S7, and S8 sites, respectively after relaxation. Thus, both the Ag/Ni (111) interface and the Ni/Ag (111) interface exhibit Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption close to zero as observed from the DFT calculations. Hence, from theoretical calculations, we can infer that the Ni–Ag interface promotes hydrogen evolution.
The plot of the exchange current density (j0) vs. the Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) for different metals and compounds gives an array of points in the shape of a volcano. Popularly known as the volcano plot, this plot has catalysts with ΔGH near zero at the top with high exchange current densities (j0) and the catalysts with large positive and negative ΔGH exhibiting lower exchange current densities on either side of the volcano peak. The position of a catalyst in the volcano plot provides key information about its activity. In this study, we calculated the j0 for NiAg0.4 3DPNC by using the Tafel plot (Fig. S10†). The estimated j0 for the NiAg0.4 catalyst is equal to 5.10 × 10−5 A cm−2(ECSA). The j0vs. the ΔGH plot for Ni, Ag, and NiAg0.4 3DPNC is shown in Fig. 6a. The NiAg0.4 3DPNC has a higher exchange current density compared to Ni and Ag and a lower Gibbs energy of adsorption (−0.04 eV) and reasonably fits in the volcano plot with its position closer to the volcano peak.

The ΔGH and j0 values of Ni and Ag are taken from ref. 16. (b) Plot illustrating the relationship between the overpotential and entropy of mix (approximate estimate of the interface surface area) with the increasing mole fraction of Ag. (c) Chronoamperometry test of NiAg0.4 3DPNC at −1 V vs. Hg/HgO (76 mV overpotential) for 80 hours, (d) comparison of the HER polarization curves of NiAg0.4 3DPNC before and after 5000 CV cycles. 
Thus, the epitaxial interface created between Ni (the element with a negative ΔGH) and Ag (the element with a positive ΔGH) exhibits a higher exchange current density as observed from the experimental results, which is in line with a lower ΔGH obtained from the theoretical calculations.
Also, rationally a larger interface area between Ni and Ag is expected to drastically improve the HER activity. For instance, if the surface areas of both Ni and Ag are large, the interface area will be large (assuming that Ni and Ag are homogeneously distributed throughout the structure) resulting in a higher HER activity. In contrast, if only one of the Ni or Ag surface areas is high, the interface area will be relatively low resulting in lower HER activity. Herein, we used the entropy of mix for two elements as a measure of interface area. The entropy of mix was calculated based on the mathematical formula for the entropy of mix for a binary solid solution.42 Although our samples do not represent solid solutions, nonetheless the entropy of mix closely relates to the degree of interface between Ni and Ag. In Fig. 6b, the variation of overpotential vs. the mole fraction of Ag is plotted alongside the variation of theoretical entropy of mix vs. the mole fraction of Ag. The entropy of mix is low at both the lower and higher mole fractions of Ag and reaches a maximum at a mole fraction of 0.5. Thus, a higher interface area (hence a lower overpotential) is expected for the samples with the mole fraction of Ag near 0.5. As expected, the overpotential reduces with the increase in the mole fraction of Ag, reaches a minimum at a mole fraction of 0.28, gradually increases until a mole fraction of 0.724, and increases steeply thereafter. It is worth noting that the interfacing of Ag and Ni throughout the nanocluster may not be perfect due to the limitations of the synthesis process. Therefore, the variation of overpotential with the increase in the mole fraction of Ag does not perfectly match with the variation of the entropy of mix. Nevertheless, the variation of overpotential follows a trend similar to that of the entropy of mix to a reasonable extent, thus confirming the origin of the HER activity from the Ni–Ag epitaxial interface.
Since the commercial application of the catalyst necessitates higher activity as well as long-term durability, the chronoamperometry test was carried out at −1 V vs. the Hg/HgO electrode (76 mV overpotential) for 80 hours. As revealed in Fig. 6c, the NiAg0.4 3DPNC exhibit a current density of more than 10 mA cm−2 even after 80 hours of operation. Furthermore, the HER polarization curves measured after the stability test reveal a marginal loss in the performance with η10 equal to 68 mV (Fig. S11†). Also, NiAg0.4 3DPNC were cycled for 5000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles to further inspect the durability of the catalyst. The η10 increased to 70 mV after CV sweeps revealing slight degradation in the activity. However, the HER activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC at higher voltages remained the same as the as-synthesized catalyst (Fig. 6d) revealing the modest durability of the catalyst. The phase, morphology, chemical state, and chemical composition of the NiAg0.4 3DPNC after the chronoamperometry test were investigated to detect any possible transformations in the sample. The phase of the catalyst remained the same as the synthesized sample after 80 hours of chronoamperometry test as observed from the XRD patterns (Fig. S12a†). Furthermore, the SEM images of the sample after the chronoamperometry test revealed a similar 3D porous structure to that of the synthesized sample demonstrating the excellent morphological stability of the catalyst (Fig. S12b†). However, the ICP-OES tests revealed a decrease in the Ni concentration to 68.5% in the post-chronoamperometry test sample, which is 3.39% lower than that of the as-synthesized sample (71.89% Ni) indicating the dissolution of nickel. Although Ni is believed to be stable in alkaline medium, recent reports of cathodic corrosion43,44 hint that dissolution of nickel may have occurred. However, further investigations are necessary before this conclusion can be drawn at this moment. XPS spectra of the sample after the chronoamperometry test are shown in Fig. S12c and d.† Peaks at 852.7 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 867.5 eV (Ni 2p1/2) correspond to the Ni (0) oxidation state, while the peaks at 856 eV (Ni2+ 2p3/2) and 873.1 eV (Ni2+ 2p1/2) alongside the satellite peaks at 862 eV and 879.4 eV are the characteristic peaks of the oxidized nickel (Ni2+), which are identical to those of the synthesized catalysts (Fig. 1c). However, the intensity of the peaks at 856 eV (Ni2+ 2p3/2) and 873.1 eV (Ni2+ 2p1/2) ascribed to the oxidized nickel was higher in the tested sample revealing the surface oxidation of nickel. Furthermore, the XPS spectrum in the Ag 3d region (Fig. S12d†) revealed peaks at 368.1 eV and 374.1 eV corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 with a spin-orbital splitting of 6 eV confirming the unchanged Ag (0) oxidation state of silver as present in the synthesized catalyst. Thus, from the XPS analysis we argue that the surface oxidation of nickel may have caused a marginal loss in the HER activity during the chronoamperometry test. In conclusion, NiAg0.4 3DPNC exhibit modest durability and activity and are superior to many of the recently reported catalysts (Table S3†).
Conclusions
The NiAg0.4 3DPNC were synthesized through the hydrothermal route followed by thermal reduction in hydrogen. The sample has 3D porous nanocluster morphology with abundant epitaxial interfaces between Ni and Ag as revealed from HRTEM images. The catalyst shows excellent HER activity in 1 M KOH exhibiting a low overpotential of 40 mV@10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec−1. The specific activity of NiAg0.4 3DPNC (0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA) at η = 45 mV) matches with that of Pt/C (0.1 mA cm−2(ECSA) at η = 26 mV) revealing similar intrinsic activity as the state-of-the-art catalyst. The excellent activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of both Ni and Ag atoms in the Ni–Ag interface. The DFT calculations reveal reduced Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption close to zero (−0.04 eV) for the sites at the Ni–Ag interface. Furthermore, NiAg0.4 3DPNC exhibit j0 equal to 5.10 × 10−5 A cm−2(ECSA), which is higher than both pristine nickel and silver corresponding to their lower ΔGH. Also, the variation of overpotential at various Ni/Ag compositions suggests the role of an interface in the enhanced catalytic activity. The catalyst exhibits a current density of more than 10 mA cm−2 even after 80 hours of continuous operation at an overpotential of 76 mV showing the modest durability of the catalyst. In conclusion, this study opens door to the possible design of a multitude of catalysts with optimized hydrogen adsorption energy through alloying, doping or interface engineering of elements or compounds with opposing tendencies for hydrogen adsorption. Further research in this direction can lead to the development of new catalytic systems that are highly active towards hydrogen evolution.
