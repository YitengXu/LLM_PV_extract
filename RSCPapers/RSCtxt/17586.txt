    , Accepted 30th November 2017First published on 1st December 2017AbstractGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a metal-free semiconductor photocatalyst has been continually struggling with the high recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers. Developing a heterostructure is an effective way to suppress the photo-induced e−–h+ pair recombination. In this study, a novel heterostructured g-C3N4/hierarchical reuleaux triangle LaCO3OH nanocomposite was controllably fabricated via a one-pot hydrothermal strategy for the first time rather than through the conventional solid state calcination reaction, relying on the dual-functional roles of g-C3N4. g-C3N4, serving as both the structure directing agent and CO32− source in the reaction system, significantly influences the morphology engineering of LaCO3OH. The time-dependent structural evolutions were discussed in detail. The strong interfacial charge transfer and separation are the dominant factors for activity enhancement of g-C3N4/LaCO3OH towards gaseous nitric oxide (NO) degradation under visible light, as confirmed by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. Combined with the identification of reaction intermediates and electron spin resonance (ESR) results, the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of NO over the g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction was proposed. More importantly, this novel self-sacrificial synthesis strategy was successfully extended to synthesize both g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3 and g-C3N4/SrCO3 composites, indicating that it can serve as a general method to synthesize g-C3N4/carbonate compounds.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, overwhelming attention is focused on visible-light sensitive photocatalysts due to the high efficiency for solar-energy utilization.1–3 g-C3N4 as the first metal-free semiconductor has attracted attention in the environmental remediation field, because of its visible-light response, stacking 2D graphite-like layered structure and low cost of production.4–6 Nanoarchitecture engineering,7–9 elemental doping,10–13 and molecular copolymerization14,15 are considered as effective strategies for tuning the electronic band structure of pristine g-C3N4 to improve the visible-light catalytic performance, but these single-phase modified strategies are insufficient to restrain the recombination of photo-induced carriers efficiently. For the recombination process of charge carriers, the excited electrons revert to the valence band, dissipating the redundant energy as heat without participating in the photocatalysis reaction.16 In contrast to single-phase engineering, the construction of g-C3N4-based heterostructures, such as g-C3N4/TiO2, g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3, g-C3N4/Ag2O, g-C3N4/Bi2WO6, etc.,18–22 can effectively suppress the photoinduced e−–h+ pair recombination by interface transfer and synergistic catalytic effects.17
Usually, the hydro-/solvothermal strategy is considered as an important way to synthesize crystal materials, especially for composites, due to the merits of morphology control, crystal face growth rate adjustment and crystallinity improvement. However, most of the g-C3N4-based nanohybrids have to be prepared by the solid–solid calcination method, rather than through the hydrothermal strategy because g-C3N4 can generate impurity groups, CO32− and NH4+, by self-decomposition in hydrothermal reaction. This issue has built a barrier for extending g-C3N4-based composites due to some components obtained only by the hydrothermal method or intolerable quenching treatment. Nevertheless, it gives us an inspiration to investigate whether this disadvantage of g-C3N4 can transform into a merit for g-C3N4/carbonate composite fabrication. In our recent work, the (001) face exposed quadrate Bi2O2CO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction was successfully prepared with the assistance of the g-C3N4 self-sacrificing strategy for the first time.20
LaCO3OH, an important member of the rare-earth hydroxycarbonate family, has been prepared with different morphologies (apple-like structure, plum blossom-like structure, triangular heart structure, microspheres, nanowires, etc.)23–27 with luminescence properties,23,26 and has also served as a morphology-controlled template for the synthesis of La2O3 or La(OH)3 in recent years.28 Fascinatingly, LaCO3OH possesses relatively negative conduction band and positive valence band edges, which ensures sufficient potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production and organic pollutant decomposition. In addition, the combination of narrow band gap semiconductors with the wide band gap LaCO3OH to build a heterojunction is expected to be an effective strategy for charge or hole accelerated separation because of the formation of a built-in electric field at the interfaces. In 2013, Pan et al. firstly reported LaCO3OH as a photocatalyst exhibiting three times higher hydrogen evolution efficiency from aqueous methanol solutions than that of anatase TiO2 under UV light irradiation.29 Very recently, Patil et al. prepared graphene-wrapped Ag3PO4/LaCO3OH heterostructures via an in situ wet chemical method, exhibiting a superior photocatalytic activity for methylene blue degradation under visible-light irradiation.30 Thus far, the application of LaCO3OH in gas-phase pollutant degradation has not been reported.
In light of previous accomplishments, herein, a novel LaCO3OH hierarchical reuleaux triangle nanostructure was tunably fabricated for the first time. During the hydrothermal process, g-C3N4 plays dual roles as a CO32− provider and structure-directing agent. Synergistic effects and intimate interfacial contact of g-C3N4/LaCO3OH are the dominant factors for activity enhancement towards NO degradation under visible light, which was confirmed by experimental characterization and DFT theoretical calculation. More importantly, this novel synthesis strategy was successfully extended to synthesize both g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3 and g-C3N4/SrCO3 composites, indicating that it can serve as a general method to synthesize g-C3N4/carbonate compounds.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of the g-C3N4 sample
10 g of melamine powder was put into an alumina crucible with a cover, and then heated to 550 °C in a muffle furnace for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The resulting powder was collected for use without further treatment.
2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction samples
All chemicals were used without further purification. g-C3N4/LaCO3OH composites (CN–LCOH for short) were synthesized using a hydrothermal approach. In a typical process, 2.0 g of La(NO3)3·6H2O was dispersed in 70 mL of deionized water and stirred for 30 min. Then, 0.9 g of g-C3N4 was added to the above solution. After 45 min of ultrasonic treatment, 0.625 M NaOH was added to adjust the pH to 8.0–8.5. The mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated for 4, 8, or 12 h at 160 °C. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the products were collected by filtration, washed thoroughly three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol alternately, dried at 60 °C for 12 h, and then labeled as CN–LCOH-4, CN–LCOH-8, and CN–LCOH-12, respectively. For comparison, Na2CO3 was used instead of g-C3N4 to synthesize LaCO3OH in the same manner at 160 °C for 12 h. Two parallel experiments of CN–LCOH were done and the products were labeled as CN–LCOH-1 and CN–LCOH-2, respectively. Then, we changed the dosage of La(NO3)3·6H2O from 1.5 to 2.5 g with 0.5 g increments and labeled the products as CN–LCOH-1.5, CN–LCOH-2, and CN–LCOH-2.5, respectively. The content of g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH in the g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction was investigated by elemental analysis (Table S1†) and optimized in terms of photocatalytic activity. According to the results of photocatalytic activity evaluations (Fig. S1†), the CN–LCOH with 75.77% g-C3N4 and 24.23% LaCO3OH was chosen as the research object because of the optimal photocatalytic activity. Based on the elemental analysis results, the nitrogen content in g-C3N4 and CN–LCOH was 63.46% and 48.82%, respectively. Therefore, it can be deduced that the mass content of g-C3N4 was 75.77% in CN–LCOH. A mechanically mixed sample was prepared by a physical ultrasound method with 75.77% g-C3N4 and 24.23% LaCO3OH. This procedure for the preparation of g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3 and g-C3N4/SrCO3 has been repeated using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Sr(NO3)2, respectively.
2.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6490, Japan) was used to characterize the morphology of the obtained products. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EDX elemental mapping were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100HR CM-120 (Japan) transmission electron microscope. The crystal phase was analyzed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 0.05° 2θ s−1 (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA, PANalytical X′ Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer). Elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar Vario EL instrument (Vario EL III, German, detection limit: 0.015%, standard deviation: ≤0.1% abs) with He purging for 20 s prior to testing. Samples were embedded in KBr pellets and then subjected to Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) on a FT-IR absorption spectrometer (Magna-IR 750, Nicolet, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250, USA). All binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. Moreover, a nitrogen adsorption apparatus (ASAP 2020, USA) was used to obtain the BET surface area of the samples, which were degassed at 250 °C prior to analysis. A Varian Cary 100 Scan UV-Visible system equipped with a labsphere diffuse reflectance accessory was used to obtain the reflectance spectra of the catalysts over a range of 200–800 nm. The intermediate and final products, nitrate and nitrite ions, were extracted by immersing the powders (about 0.05 g) in 6 mL deionized water and measured after the photocatalytic activity test by using a Dionex-600 Ion Chromatograph (IC, Dionex Inc., Sunny-vale, CA, USA) equipped with an IonPac AS14A column. The mobile phase was composed of a mixture of 1.8 mM Na2CO3 and 1.7 mM NaHCO3 at a flow rate of 1.20 mL min−1; the volume of the samples was 20 μL. The detection limits for NO2− and NO3− are 0.0050 μg mL−1 and 0.0256 μg mL−1. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy was conducted on a home-made detection system, which includes a source of monochromatic light provided by a 500 W xenon lamp and a double-prism monochromator, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), a photovoltaic cell and a computer. The photovoltaic cell was constructed by pressing the powder sample into two indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to form a sandwich-like structure. The SPV signal was recorded in the wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm. Samples for electron spin-resonance spectroscopy (ESR, ER200-SRC, Bruker, Germany) were prepared by mixing 0.05 g of the as-prepared photocatalyst in a 25 mM 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) solution with a 50 mL aqueous dispersion for DMPO–˙OH or a 50 mL alcohol dispersion for DMPO–˙O2− under irradiation with 420 nm visible light.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity tests
The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were investigated in terms of NO removal at ppb levels in a continuous flow photocatalytic reactor system (Scheme S1†) at ambient temperature. The rectangular reactor, which was fabricated from stainless steel and covered with quartz glass, possessed a volume capacity of 4.5 L (30 cm × 15 cm × 10 cm). A 300 W commercial Xe arc lamp (microsolar 300, Perfectlight, China) was vertically placed outside the reactor. UV light in the light beam was removed by adopting a UV cutoff filter (420 nm). The photocatalyst (0.1 g) was coated onto a dish (10.0 cm in diameter), which was subsequently pretreated at 60 °C to remove water in the suspension. NO gas was supplied by a compressed gas cylinder at a concentration of 48 ppm (N2 balance) in accordance with the standard of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The initial NO concentration was diluted to 400 ppb by an air stream supplied by a zero-air generator (Model 1001, Sabio Instruments LLC, Georgetown, TX, USA), and the flow rate was controlled at 3 L min−1. The lamp was turned on when adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved and the optical power density reaching the sample surface was calibrated to be 25.46 mW cm−2 (Thorlabs PM100D optical power meter). The concentration of NO was continuously measured using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer (Model 42c, Thermo Environmental Instruments Inc., Franklin, MA, USA). This apparatus was used to monitor NO and NO2 concentrations at a sampling rate of 0.6 L min−1. The removal ratio (η) of NO was calculated as η (%) = (1 − C/C0) × 100, where C and C0 are the concentrations of NO in the outlet and feeding streams, respectively.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were evaluated using a Parstat 4000 electrochemical workstation (USA) in a conventional three-electrode cell, with a platinum plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The photoelectrodes with a geometric surface area of 1 cm2 were exposed to periodic front-side illumination from a 420 nm LED. The photocurrent–time curves were measured at 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO3 (pH 12) at ambient temperature. For Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurement, the working electrode was immersed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 12), and subjected to a 5 mV perturbation bias at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz from −0.6 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
2.6 DFT calculations
All the calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using a basis set consisting of plane waves, as implemented in the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP).31 The exchange–correlation energy and electron–ion interactions are calculated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)32 + U33 formulation of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).34 A plane-wave cut-off of 300 eV and 450 eV was used for LaCO3OH and g-C3N4 calculations. The energy and residual force convergence criteria were set to 2.0 × 10−5 eV per atom and 0.05 eV Å−1 for geometry optimization, respectively. We used a 2 × 2 × 1 and a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for geometry optimization of the bulk LaCO3OH and g-C3N4, and a 4 × 4 × 1 mesh to calculate their density of states (DOS). Also, we used a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for geometry optimization of the LaCO3OH/g-C3N4 composites, and a 4 × 4 × 1 mesh to calculate their DOS. Charge transfer was calculated from the electron density difference (EDD) on the basis of Mulliken Population Analysis (MPA).35
3. Results and discussion
The bulk g-C3N4 obtained after drying from La(NO3)3 solution with a layered structure (Fig. 1a) and pure LaCO3OH sheets (Fig. 1b) with different sizes and irregular shapes are investigated by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1c, the LaCO3OH hierarchical self-assembly reuleaux triangle nanostructure with a diameter of about 10 μm implants into the irregular bulk g-C3N4. Furthermore, in the HRTEM image of CN–LCOH (Fig. 1d), amorphous g-C3N4 and the (302) planes of hexagonal LaCO3OH can be observed at the boundary, further suggesting the intimate interfacial contact between them. In order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite material, EDX elemental mapping images were recorded and are displayed in Fig. 1e–i. The results indicate that N (magenta), C (yellow) and O (cyan) elements are distributed uniformly throughout the whole area, and La (red) element is distributed in the arc-shaped area, in agreement with the SEM and TEM results.

The crystal structure and chemical composition information on all samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses and FT-IR analysis. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared LCOH, CN–LCOH, and CN samples. Apparently, the typical diffraction peaks of hexagonal (JCPDS no. 26-0815) LaCO3OH29 and g-C3N4 (ref. 4) can be observed in the CN–LCOH sample, demonstrating that the g-C3N4/LaCO3OH composite has been successfully constructed by self-sacrificing parts of g-C3N4 as the CO32− provider. Based on the elemental analysis results (Table S1†), the nitrogen content in g-C3N4, CN–LCOH, CN–LCOH-1 and CN–LCOH-2 was 63.46%, 48.82%, 48.65%, and 48.53%, respectively. Therefore, it can be deduced that the mass content of g-C3N4 was 75.77%, 75.48%, and 75.30% in CN–LCOH, CN–LCOH-1 and CN–LCOH-2, respectively, implying the good reproducibility and controllability of this self-sacrificial synthesis strategy. The FT-IR spectra of the LCOH, CN–LCOH, and CN samples are shown in Fig. 2b. For pure LCOH, four typical carbonate ion modes and a stretching vibration of OH appear at 873 cm−1 (v1), 843 cm−1 (v2), 1437–1498 cm−1 (v3), 705–776 cm−1 (v4), and 3615 cm−1, respectively.26,29 For pure CN, the intense bands in the 1200–1700 cm−1 region indicate the stretching vibration of the heptazine heterocyclic ring (C6N7) units. The peaks at 807 cm−1 and 890 cm−1 are assigned to the breathing mode of the heptazine ring system and the deformation mode of N–H, respectively, and the broad band at 3400–3600 cm−1 is due to physically adsorbed H2O.7,20 The CN–LCOH sample shows the characteristic absorption bands of both LCOH and CN, thereby confirming the co-existence of LCOH and CN components, which agrees with the aforementioned results. The surface chemical states and composition of the as-prepared samples were further analyzed by XPS. The survey spectra in Fig. S2a† imply the presence of N, C, La, and O in the prepared nanocomposite sample. Fig. S2b† shows that the binding energies of La 3d3/2 and La 3d5/2 are 850.5 and 833.7 eV, and the shake-up peaks located at 838.8 and 855.3 eV correspond to the La(III) oxidation state, respectively.26,36 The distinctive binding energy positive drifts observed in CN–LCOH can be attributed to the change in inner electron density caused by the formation of the g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction. In the C 1s region (Fig. S2c†), the sharp peak at around 284.6 eV is assigned to adventitious carbon species from XPS measurement. The C 1s peaks at around 286.3 and 288.2 eV in CN–LCOH and CN, and 289.5 eV in LCOH can be assigned to C–NH/NH2, sp2-hybridized carbon in triazine rings, and the C–O moiety, respectively.26,37,38 In the N 1s region (Fig. S2d†), the main N 1s peak at a binding energy of around 398.8 eV can be assigned to the sp2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms (CN–C), and the weak peak at 400.3 eV is attributed to the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups or H–N–(C)2 (ref. 38 and 39) in both CN and CN–LCOH samples.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns (a), FT-IR spectra (b) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (c) of pristine LCOH, CN–LCOH and CN, respectively, and Mott–Schottky plots of LCOH and CN (d). 
The textural and band gap structures of the obtained samples were evaluated by nitrogen adsorption measurement, UV-vis DRS and Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurement. The BET surface areas of LCOH, CN, their mechanical mixture, and CN–LCOH were determined to be 6.2, 10.8, 17.5, and 33.2 m2 g−1 by nitrogen adsorption measurement, respectively. That is to say, the in situ fabrication of LaCO3OH with a hierarchical structure with g-C3N4 results in a larger specific surface area than when using Na2CO3. Besides, UV-vis DRS results indicate that the light absorption edges of LaCO3OH and g-C3N4 are located at about 275 nm and 471 nm (Fig. 2c), corresponding to a band gap of 4.50 eV and 2.63 eV, respectively, according to the Kubelka–Munk method.40 In addition, M–S plots can be used to determine the flat band potential of the semiconductors. From the results in Fig. 2d, both g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH are demonstrated to be n-type semiconductors due to the positive slope of the linear plots,41 and their flat band potentials (Vfb) are −1.33 and −1.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 7 (converted to −1.13 and −0.95 V vs. the NHE at pH 7 using the Nernst equation).42 For n-type semiconductors, the Vfb lies very close to the bottom of the conduction band (VCB). Presumably, combined with VCB and the band gap results, the tops of valence band (VB) of g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH are calculated to be 1.50 V and 3.55 V, respectively. On the basis of the above data, the energy band structures of g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH can be staggered and have the potential to form type II alignment,17 as shown in Fig. S3.†
The g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction formation pathways underlying time-dependent structural evolutions are shown in Scheme 1. Simply, the dual-functional roles of g-C3N4 are (1) as a sacrificial agent to supply CO32−. It can suffer from self-decomposition and generate CO32− and NH4+,43,44 similar to mesoporous silica SBA-15. Such a process can be considered to be disadvantageous for materials fabrication because of the impurity group introduced, but can be utilized to fabricate g-C3N4/carbonate composites (the generation of CO32− from the decomposition of g-C3N4 was proved by an experiment and the details are shown in Fig. S4†). The hydrolysis process of the g-C3N4 released CO32− ions gradually by the tail C chain self-sacrifice due to the weaker binding energy (process 1 in Scheme 1), which provided adsorption and growth sites for La3+ ions. (2) Another is as a structure-directing agent to form layered LaCO3OH nanosheets (process 2 in Scheme 1). Briefly, the layer structure of g-C3N4 gradually decomposed along the layer direction and the La3+ combined with CO32− and OH− to form LaCO3OH nanosheets along the direction in which g-C3N4 disappeared. With the time prolonged, the LaCO3OH nanosheets transform into a larger hierarchical layer structure by uniform epitaxial growth due to the stable CO32− supply in the g-C3N4 self-sacrificing reaction system. As the treatment time was extended to 12 h, the hierarchical structure surface of LaCO3OH centripetally sunk to reduce the surface energy and the hierarchical curved edge triangle-like LaCO3OH constructed by numerous nanoplatelets was obtained eventually by Ostwald ripening. The growth pattern of LaCO3OH is different when the alkali system of Na2CO3 was replaced by g-C3N4. Random sized polygon nanosheets of pure LaCO3OH can be formed due to lack of structure direction and stable CO32− concentration (Fig. 1b). It is believed that the structure direction and CO32− supply pattern in the reaction system has a vital influence on the morphology of LaCO3OH.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunctions. 
The as-prepared LCOH, CN–LCOH, and CN samples were employed in the photocatalytic removal of NO under visible-light irradiation in a continuous reactor to demonstrate their potential capability in air purification, as shown in Fig. 3a. The dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibrium of NO over all the samples in the dark was achieved before switching the light source and the direct photolysis of NO without any photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation was excluded by controlled experiments. The pristine LaCO3OH has no photocatalytic activity under visible light because of the large band gap. The removal ratios of NO using pristine CN and the CN–LCOH composite are 19.3% and 30.3% after 30 min of visible-light irradiation, respectively. In order to evaluate the effect of hydrothermal treatment on photocatalytic NO removal, the photocatalytic activity of CN after hydrothermal treatment without other additives is evaluated. From Fig. S5,† it is found that hydrothermal treatment with CN has an ignorable effect on photocatalytic NO removal. These results suggest that the photocatalytic activity was enhanced by the heterostructure fabrication. For comparison, we calculated the content ratio of CN and LCOH in the CN–LCOH sample and mixed the two pure phases proportionally by the physical ultrasound method. The photocatalytic activity of the mechanically mixed sample (25.2%) is 5.1% lower than that of the CN–LCOH heterojunction under the same conditions, indicating the importance of synergy effects by the in situ interfacial connection.45 The reaction intermediate NO2, produced during photocatalytic oxidation of NO, can hinder NO degradation and the photocatalyst application because of the active sites it occupies and its toxicity. Thus, the NO2 by-product is monitored online (Fig. S6a†) and the selectivity is calculated (details about NO2 selectivity is given in the ESI†). The results show that CN–LCOH displays the lowest conversion ratio (11.6%) of NO to NO2 compared to CN (39.5%) and the mechanical mixture sample (40.4%), as shown in Fig. S6b.† The above results imply that the CN–LCOH heterojunction has better potential capability in air purification because of its outstanding performance to prefer the transformation from gas phase NO to particle phase nitrate, rather than toxic NO2. The accumulated products on the surface of the CN–LCOH sample after a single reaction run were extracted with deionized water and measured by the ion chromatography (IC) method. It was found that the amounts of NO3− and NO2− accumulated on the CN–LCOH surface were 12.30 μmol and 0.01 μmol, which indicated that the oxidation of NO to NO3− was the major conversion process. Multiple cycles of repeated experiments over the CN–LCOH were carried out to further test the stability of photocatalytic NO removal. After undergoing five repeated runs, the NO removal ratio of the CN–LCOH heterojunction remains high, and the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S7†) of the recycled sample is almost identical to that of the fresh sample, suggesting the excellent phase stability and performance stability of CN–LCOH. Certainly, the superior photocatalytic activity can be mainly attributed to the effective charge carrier migration and separation ability.

To understand the heterojunction effect on the photocatalytic activity enhancement, transient photocurrent response and surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy measurements were implemented to investigate the photoinduced charge transfer behaviors of the obtained samples. Firstly, as shown in Fig. 3b, all the samples exhibit prompt photocurrent signals with a reproducible response to on/off cycles and the density generated by the CN–LCOH heterojunction (1.2 μA cm−2) is 2.4, 4, and 12 times higher than those of the mechanically mixed sample (0.5 μA cm−2), CN (0.3 μA cm−2), and LCOH (0.1 μA cm−2), respectively. In addition, the SPV respond owing to the incident wavelength meticulously reveals the photoinduced charge separation behaviors within different wavelength ranges. Fig. 3c shows the SPV spectra in which the response intensity is significantly strengthened in the CN–LCOH heterojunction, again indicating the improved separation of photoinduced e−–h+ pairs in the in situ heterojunction structure. More importantly, the SPV signal of CN–LCOH in the visible-light region (∼420 nm) is increased compared to that of CN, which means that the high e−–h+ pair separation rate may be attributed to the transfer of photo-generated electrons from g-C3N4 to LaCO3OH. The mechanical mixture shows a weaker SPV signal than that of the in situ heterojunction due to the lack of intimate interfaces.
To further examine the interaction, especially the charge carrier transfer direction, between g-C3N4 (Fig. S8a†) and LaCO3OH (Fig. S8b†) at the interfaces, a theoretical model was built by matching the respective preferential crystal face, (001) and (001) lattice planes for g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH, respectively. Fig. S8c† shows the pristine structure of the g-C3N4 (001)/LaCO3OH (001) interface, and the geometry optimization result is shown in Fig. S8d.† Different degrees of deformation occur at the two interfaces due to the band structure re-arrangement. To explore how the charge transfer occurs between g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH, the charge density difference was calculated as shown in Fig. 3d and the results show that the charge transfer from g-C3N4 to LaCO3OH is about 1.14 electrons across the interface. So, we conclude that the poor photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is primarily due to its inferior electronic properties, but coupled with LaCO3OH, it can promote effective interfacial charge separation, especially by the in situ growth method.
According to the above experimental and calculation results, it is concluded that the energy level difference forming the built-in electric field between g-C3N4 and LaCO3OH is the driving force that causes the effective electron–hole separation. Based on the above characterizations and analyses, the in situ fabricated g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction exhibiting superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for the NOx photocatalytic oxidation mechanism is proposed. Firstly, g-C3N4 can be excited by visible light and made to generate photo-induced electrons and holes, but LaCO3OH cannot be subjected to identical conditions (process 1 in Fig. 4a). The excited electrons can transfer from g-C3N4 to LaCO3OH because of the electric field force and interfacial contact (process 2). Secondly, compared with the mechanically mixed sample, CN–LCOH possesses the hierarchical layered structure of LaCO3OH, which can favor NO adsorption and intermediate diffusion. More importantly, upward or downward band bending can be created at the intimate interface to balance the Fermi energy level due to the in situ fabrication strategy, which can significantly ameliorate the charge migration and separation compared to that of the mechanically mixed one.46 Finally, the excited electrons are trapped by O2 in the surrounding air to form reactive ˙O2− (process 3) and ˙OH radicals generated via the ˙O2− → H2O2 → ˙OH route (process 4). The EVB of g-C3N4 (1.50 eV) is lower than the standard redox potential of H2O/˙OH (2.37 eV) but is higher than that of HNO3/NO (0.94 eV), indicating that the photogenerated holes of g-C3N4 could not oxidize H2O to active species ˙OH but may oxidize NO,22 which is in agreement with the DMPO-ESR spin-trapping results. As shown in Fig. 4b, four apparent signals of ˙O2− were generated under visible-light irradiation and DMPO–˙OH adduct signals (Fig. 4c) are weaker than DMPO–˙O2− signals, which confirm that ˙O2− is the dominant active species and ˙OH radicals perform a minor function.11 NOx reacts with the photo-generated ˙O2−, ˙OH and h+, and then NO2− and NO3− ions are produced (processes 5–6), in agreement with the IC results. The related mechanisms for NO removal and photocatalytic activity enhancement over the g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction are proposed accordingly as illustrated in Fig. 4a.

In order to explore whether the g-C3N4 self-sacrificing method is applicable to fabricate other g-C3N4 based carbonate composites, we change the metal salt types in comparative experiments and keep the other reaction conditions unchanged, wherein Bi(NO3)3 and Sr(NO3)2 were chosen to replace La(NO3)3. Then, the g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3 nanohybrid was prepared using Bi(NO3)3 as the precursor, in which many quadrate tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 moieties (ref. 47) (JCPDS no. 41-1488, Fig. S9a and S10a†) anchor on the bulk g-C3N4, as shown in Fig. 5a. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 5b–e) indicate that N, Bi and C are distributed on the obtained composite. What's more, the bulk g-C3N4/rod-cluster-like orthorhombic SrCO3 (ref. 48 and 49) (JCPDS no. 05-0418, Fig. S10b†) composite could be fabricated when Sr(NO3)2 was used as the precursor, which can be verified by XRD (Fig. S9b†) and SEM (Fig. 5f). The elemental mapping images (Fig. 5g–j) indicate that N, Sr and C are distributed on the obtained composite. The extra C element in both samples is attributed to the signal from the carbon film on the base grid. The removal ratios of NO over g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3 and g-C3N4/SrCO3 composites are 33.5% and 25.5%, respectively, after 30 min of visible-light irradiation (Fig. S11†), which is higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The aforesaid results sufficiently demonstrate that this novel synthesis strategy has unique merits for g-C3N4-based carbonate composite fabrication.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel heterostructured g-C3N4/LaCO3OH nanocomposite was controllably fabricated via a one-pot hydrothermal strategy for the first time, relying on the dual-functional roles of g-C3N4, namely as a CO32− provider and also as a structure-directing agent. Heterojunction formation pathways underlying time-dependent structural evolutions were discussed in detail. Synergistic effects and intimate interfacial contact of CN–LCOH can be considered as the main reasons for activity enhancement towards NO visible-light degradation due to the more effective interfacial charge separation efficiency. Both NO photocatalytic degradation and activity enhancement mechanisms over the g-C3N4/LaCO3OH heterojunction were proposed. More importantly, this novel synthesis strategy was successfully extended to synthesize g-C3N4/Bi2O2CO3 and g-C3N4/SrCO3 composites, indicating that it can serve as a general method to synthesize g-C3N4/carbonate compound heterojunctions.
