Soc., 1987, 84, 191-204Laser studies on the dynamics of elementary steps with translationally and vibrationally excited reactants(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Jürgen WolfrumAbstractThe reactions D + H2(v= 0, 1)→ HD (v= 0, 1)+ H have been studied by CARS spectroscopy in a fast-discharge flow system. In contrast to previous experiments good agreement has been obtained between experimental values and results of quasi-classical trajectory calculations using the most recent potential-energy surface of the H3 system. Vibrational and rotational energy transfer between H2 and HD has been studied directly using Raman excitation combinated with time-resolved CARS spectroscopy.The reaction H + O2→ OH + O has been studied using translationally hot H atoms at various energies. Absolute total reactive cross-sections, nascent rotational state distributions and information on the distribution of orientations of the OH angular momentum vector using polarized dissociation and analysis laser sources have been obtained.The reaction OH + CO → CO2+ H was studied for translationally hot reactants in both directions. Hydroxyl radicals were produced by laser photolysis of H2O2 at 193 nm. The initial rotational distribution of the OH radical shows a Gaussian-like distribution with a maximum at K″= 12 and with 16% of the total available energy appearing in rotation and <1% in vibration. A total reaction cross-section of 19 ± 10 Å2 at Ecm= 1.32 eV of the OH radicals was measured from the absolute number of H atoms formed.
