Water impact
This comprehensive review emphasizes on the demonstration of electrospun nanofibers based on their fundamental principles and property–parameter interrelationships as useful filtration membranes. Further, a detailed overview of the design, fabrication and physicochemical properties of the electrospun nanofibers followed by their useful contributions to water remediation processes such as microfiltration, desalination, heavy metal ion removal, dye removal and oil–water separation is discussed.

1. Introduction
An exponential growth in global population and rapid urbanization have drawn people to face many challenges such as environmental pollution, climate change (global warming, acid rain, smog formation, etc.) and health risks due to unhygienic food, water and air to name a few.1–3 Thus, harvesting green energy from natural renewable sources and its sustainability could be the key approach to overcome some of these challenges.4–6 In this view, electrospun nanofibers are of great interest due to their fascinating features like a high specific surface area, high interconnected porosity, excellent flexibility and stability properties.7–10 Several techniques are currently available for electrospun nanofiber production namely: 1. template synthesis; in this method nanofibers are fabricated within the micropores of a membrane or within the nano/micro pores or channels of a preconfigured polymer or metal oxide template.11 The only drawback of this method is, in some cases, it is difficult to separate the template and nanofibers. 2. Self-assembly; in this method the formation of nanofibers begins at the molecular level. The molecules organize themselves into ordered structures through non-covalent interactions and form nanostructures and these nanostructures assemble with each other and grow into nanofibers.12–14 3. Solvothermal synthesis; in this method the components are well dispersed in a solvent and transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at the specified temperature for a specified duration. The resultant nanofibrous precipitate is filtered, washed and dried prior to use.15,16 4. Centrifugal jet spinning; this method is also known as rotary jet spinning, in which the polymer solution or melt is taken in a reservoir connected with nozzles, and this system is connected to the motor for high speed rotation; when the reservoir is rotated at an optimum angular velocity the polymer jet expelling from the nozzle gets stretched in the air vertices and collected on the radial array of vertical collector bars.17–20 5. Plasma-induced synthesis; in this method the electrodes are placed in water by maintaining a specified distance between them. When high voltage direct current power is applied to the electrodes, plasma is generated from the discharge between two electrodes; at higher temperature water decomposes to produce energetic radical particles which bombard the electrode surface to vaporize atoms, and these vaporized atoms upon an in situ oxygen reaction form nanofibers.21,22 6. Solution blow spinning; in this method a polymer solution of an optimum concentration is blown through a nozzle having pore size of a few micrometers by applying an optimum pressure using gas.23,24 7. CO2 laser supersonic drawing; in this method the polymer fibers are irradiated with a CO2 laser while drawing them at specified supersonic velocities through an orifice.25 8. Sonochemical synthesis: in this technique, an oxidative polymerization reaction mixture is subjected to ultrasonic irradiation during the early stage of polymerization, which leads to the formation of nanofibers rather than forming some aggregated polymer particles.26–31
Among all these techniques, electrospinning has been accepted as a feasible, efficient and widely applicable technique for producing nanofibers.32,33 Due to the widespread potential use of electrospun nanofibers, their design, production and modification appear to be of prime importance to adapt the performance towards various aimed applications.32,33 For instance, the employment of electrospun nanofibers has proved to be a relevant option in many fields, such as water and gas purification, optical and electrical applications, biomedical and tissue engineering, chemical and biological processes, and energy generation34–36 and storage37 in which nanofibers have been used in different material forms.8,38–41 Moreover, electrospinning has become, over the years, a key technique for the fabrication of filtration membranes, nanometals, photocatalysts, carriers for drugs and enzymes, scaffolds, absorbents, packaging materials and light weight-high strength nanocomposites.42–44
The latest solutions provided by the scientific community for the improvement of experimental designs for production scale up and alignment of nanofibers, and an advantage of choice of a variety of materials (ceramics, polymers, nanometals, functional molecules, metal oxides, and carbon-based nanomaterials) have led to the synthesis of a broad variety of nanofibers. Nanofibers are available with various morphologies such as nanofibers with a hollow interior (hollow fibers),45 nanofibers with nano/micro pores on the surface (porous fibers),46 nanofibers with a core and sheath structure, where both the core and sheath are made of polymers of different physico-chemical properties (core–sheath nanofibers47–49) and nanofibers of various surface properties such as rough and smooth surface nanofibers. Rough nanofibers exhibit spikes, groves or surface pores.50–52 Meanwhile, smooth nanofiber surfaces are free of spikes, groves or pore structures. The fiber roughness mainly depends upon the material nature,53 the solvents used54,55 and the process parameters.56
Though electrospinning is a prevailing technique for the production of nanofibers, understanding the specificities of this technique is still a challenging goal.56 The present review aims at helping to understand the fundamentals and property–parameter interrelationship of electrospun nanofibers. For this purpose, an overview of the experimental variables and potential applications is provided to understand the potentialities for the implementation of electrospun nanofibers in different broad areas of water remediation. Furthermore, the influence of latest developments in electrospinning technology in addressing water purification is especially presented. The use of nanofibers in several membrane processes such as microfiltration, reverse osmosis (RO), membrane distillation (MD), heavy metal and dye removal, forward osmosis (FO) and oil/water separation has been elaborated in detail for applications in desalination and/or pollutant removal.
2. Development of electrospinning
The fabrication of nanofibers via electrospinning was patented for the first time in the year 1934.57 In continuation, significant progress in electrospinning of polymer nanofibers was later initiated by Reneker and co-workers in the later part of 1990.58 This invention, to a great extent, influenced the scientific community to employ polymer nanofibers as potential materials in various research fields, keeping in mind the sustainability factor.58 Energy conservation, pollution control and health are the three most challenging and extensively researched fields for the utilization of electrospun nanofiber-based materials in present times.59,60 As represented in Fig. 1, a typical laboratory electrospinning setup consists of a high voltage power supply, a spinneret (metallic needle) and an electrically earthed metal collector placed at a specified distance from the spinneret.61,62 As a result of applying high voltage direct current, a spherical polymer solution drop suspended at the tip of the needle/spinneret changes to a conical shape; this kind of shape transformation in a droplet is known as Taylor cone formation.63,64 When an optimum voltage is applied, the electrostatic repulsive forces acting on the droplet surface suppress the surface tension, leading to nanofiber jet formation from the Taylor cone to the metallic collector placed at the fixed distance, forming fibers of thickness of a few nanometers.63–65 The conventional instrument has been modified into different electrospinning techniques such as coaxial, flat, multi-needle and needle-less electrospinning to improve the production rate, quality and most importantly to tailor and produce structurally different nanofibers for various applications.66

2.1. Progress in the production of nanofibers to be used as filtration membranes
As per recent developments reported on needle electrospinning, a lot of modifications have been done to spinneret components in order to increase the rate of manufacture of nanofibers.67 Different kinds of spinnerets with parallel arrangement of multiple needles and circularly arranged multiple needles have been popularly used and reported.67 The representative images of these spinnerets are shown in Fig. 2, for a better understanding.68 Out of these, the multi-spinnerets have added advantages such as faster production as well as large area collection of the as-synthesized nanofibers.69 Nevertheless, a common drawback of multi-spinneret electrospinning is that this technique requires alteration in the profile of the electric field induced by the nearby electrospinning jet.70,71 Therefore, in order to overcome the problem of an auxiliary electrode, secondary electrodes are usually used.72 Apart from the advantages and disadvantages, different multi-nozzle spinnerets have different effects on the morphology of nanofibers.72,73 On the other hand, there has been rapid expansion of multi-axial (co-axial or biaxial and triaxial) electrospinning by enabling the production of functional nanofibers such as hollow, core–sheath and composite nanofibers.74,75 In multi-axial electrospinning, nanofibers of two or more different polymer solutions can be spun simultaneously by feeding the solutions through the coaxial capillary (concentrically arranged capillaries) spinneret component.76,77 These hollow and core–sheath functional nanofibers are now extensively relevant in the field of water treatment, as well as in other fields such as nano-electronics, controlled release and sensing applications.78
 Fig. 2  Pictorial representation of various spinnerets used in the needle electrospinning technique.68 
In recent years, for economically viable and large scale fabrication of nanofibers, the needle-less electrospinning technique has been considered as a promising and convenient technique. In this technique, various kinds of needle-less spinnerets have been used and are broadly categorized into rotary spinnerets and static spinnerets. A pictorial representation of various types of rotary and static spinneret components is presented in Fig. 3.79 The spinnerets such as rotatory cylinder, metal ball, spinal coil, rotatory disc, movable bead chain, rotatory cone, etc. come under rotary spinnerets.80 During needle-less electrospinning, the rotary spinneret components are partially dipped into the polymer solution reservoir and rotated with an optimum speed, such that the polymer solution is continuously supplied to the jet forming sites of the spinneret. The spinneret is usually placed below the collector so that the polymer solution does not drip on the nanofibers deposited on the collector during electrospinning.80 There are certain important advantages in needle-less electrospinning such as the rotating spinnerets can naturally provide multiple numbers of jet initiation points, which means a rotating spinneret can provide multiple optimal positions on its surface for jet formation. The needle-less electrospinning also eliminates the drawbacks associated with the conventional needle electrospinning such as needle clogging, the low rate of fiber production and small area deposition of fibers.81

Elmarco, IME Technologies and Inovenso Ltd. are some companies which are well known for manufacturing of needle-less electrospinning equipment for both laboratory and industrial scale production of nanofibers for membranes and other applications. The needle-less electrospinning plant (Nanospider technology) of Elmarco company has a production capacity of several kilograms per hour.77 The production capacity of needle-less electrospinning plants is greatly influenced by the quantitative number of spinnerets involved and jet formation points produced on the rotary spinneret's surface. However, the rotary spinnerets are not capable enough to produce highly aligned, uniformly thick and different morphology nanofibers.82
2.2. Alignment and orientation of nanofiber collectors
On narrowing down further, the alignment of nanofibers in a particular direction is equally important in electrospinning with regard to the aimed application.83 A wide range of collectors developed for improvement of the alignment and orientation of the nanofibers have been reported and they are classified as rotary/dynamic collectors and static collectors (Fig. 4). Generally, drum collectors are used for aligning large scale nanofibers and these collectors can be used to obtain thick mats of nanofibers. However, the fiber alignment will be poor and the drum rotation must be optimized carefully to prevent the breakage of nanofibers.84 Meanwhile, wire drum collectors are used to collect highly aligned nanofibers; however the demerit is the formation of a very thick layer of nanofibers and the quality of alignment of nanofibers gradually decreases with the increase of thickness of nanofiber deposition.85 Other types of drum collectors include, for example, rotating drum collector consisting of a pointed pin/probe interior, that is generally employed for the fabrication of highly aligned nanofiber thin films of larger area.86 Rotating drum collectors employing knife edge electrodes are used for the fabrication of membranes or mats with high quality aligned nanofibers. Because of the high alignment of nanofibers, these collectors are very useful for fabricating thick mats of highly aligned nanofibers.87 Aligned nanofiber membranes of a specified area can also be fabricated by using a rotating drum collector covered with a wire wound. This is also very useful for fabricating highly aligned nanofiber membrane materials. The advantage of this type of collector is the area of the aligned nanofibers can be possibly tailored by changing the wire diameter.88 Another rotating collector developed for the purpose of obtaining highly aligned nanofibers is the disc collector. However, there are certain drawbacks which limit the application of the disc collector. The drawbacks are the need for careful optimization of the disc rotation speed in order to prevent breakage of nanofibers and secondly the disc collector is useful for fabricating small area membranes of aligned nanofibers.89 In certain cases, a water bath is used as a collector, in which the nanofibers are spun directly into water, which helps for cooling as well as solidification of the fibers. The solidified fibers are initially in the twisted and spiral form, and they will be drawn, aligned and spun into yarns by collecting the fibers in a rotating cylinder.90
 Fig. 4  Different types of collectors used for the collection of nanofibers in the electrospinning technique.94 Reproduced from ref. 94 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2017. 
The choice of static collectors also stands important, while the use of plate collectors results only in random patterned nanofibers. Meanwhile, parallel ring collectors are specifically used for the production of nanofiber yarns. In parallel ring collectors, one of the rings will be rotated at an optimum speed, such that the nanofibers acquire a twisted pattern to yield yarns.91 Parallel electrode collectors can also be utilized in order to yield nanofibers with high alignment wherein the resultant nanofiber mats are moved to other substrates easily without damaging the fibers. However, parallel collectors are suitable only for fabricating thin membranes made of short nanofibers; thick and lengthy nanofiber membranes cannot be obtained by these collectors.92 Aside from the use of collectors, in some cases, a minimum amount of magnetic nanoparticles is added into the polymeric solution by further subjecting it to a magnetic field-assisted electrospinning, and it is possible to stretch the nanofibers along the gap between the collectors to orient the aligned fibers to a particular direction.93
2.3. Materials choice-property and applications of nanofibers
Nanofibers are an important class of constituents owing to their various properties, thereby making nanofibers a potential material for several important applications.95,96 The surface and interior properties, as well as thermal-mechano-chemical properties of nanofibers maybe tuned and tailored based on selection of a proper combination of solution components during the synthesis procedure.97 In particular, properties such as high surface volume and porosity are very useful for environmental remediation and energy generation/storage applications.98 To begin with, materials such as composite nanofibers of silicon, carbon and titanium oxide,99,100 composite nanofibers of carbon and sulfur,101 and carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanofibers are commonly used in battery and fuel cell applications.102 Similarly, cellulose–graphene and CNT-based nanofibers are found to be extensively used in supercapacitors and adsorption techniques.103–107 In addition to these, metal oxides like TiO2, ZnO and CNT-based nanofibers have shown promising results in solar cell applications.108–110 Apart from these, highly porous Li3N nanofibers coated with carbon are used for hydrogen storage application.111 In the case of hydrogen generation, composite nanofibers such as PAN–Ag–Pd, TiO2–CdSe, and TiO2 nanofibers functionalized with metal oxides such as Fe2O3 and ZnO are highly used as visible light-assisted water splitting photocatalysts.112 Additionally, mixed metal oxide-based materials such as SrTiO3 nanofibers are also reported as efficient UV light-assisted photocatalysts for hydrogen generation, whereas polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based nanofiber mats and films are familiar for generating piezoelectricity.113,114
Several studies have been reported on the development of highly efficient, stable and non-toxic photocatalytic nanofibers for environmental remediation.115 Amongst these, visible light photocatalysts based on TiO2 are found to be interesting for this application.116 For example, degradation of phenol and rhodamine B through photocatalysis has been implemented by using functionalized TiO2–silver nanoparticle composite fibers.117 The efficient degradation of rhodamine B could be achieved by using a high surface area SnO2–TiO2 nanofiber catalyst supported with the irradiation of UV-visible light. Similarly, under visible light irradiation, efficient degradation of methyl orange (MO) has been also reported using a membrane fabricated by using electrospun nanofibers of TiO2–SiO2 coated with polyaniline.118
On the other hand, nanofibers are also well reported for sensing toxic chemicals, gases and regulating environmental health.119 Comparatively, semiconducting metal oxide nanofibers are more accepted as they are believed to be highly selective and sensitive for oxidizing as well as reducing gases. For instance, C2H5OH (ethanol) sensing was achieved by using Cr2O3 and CO3O4 nanofibers;119 hollow nanofibers of SnO2 (with and without Pr-doping) were fabricated via electrospinning. For CO sensing, SnO2 nanofibers doped with Au were fabricated by sol–gel electrospinning.120 As per previous literature reports, electrospun nanofibers are the most important materials for biological applications.121 Properties such as enhanced cellular attachment and high surface area for adsorbing biomolecules are some of the advantages shown by nanofiber-based materials for various applications in tissue engineering,122 drug delivery,123 wound dressing,124 and functionalized scaffolds.125 Nanofiber-based materials with embedded living cells are also reported for few less studied biological applications.126 Aforementioned, due to their advantages and easy-handling, electrospinning is believed to be a well-adapted technique in order to tune the properties of nanofibers for targeted biological applications.127 Various polymers such as poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), PVP, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), gelatin and chitosan-based polymer blends have reportedly been extensively used for applications in the fields of tissue engineering and drug delivery targets.128
3. Property–parameter interrelationship in electrospinning
It is of pivotal importance to understand the effect of different types of parameter metrics on the properties of nanofibers and electrospinnability.129 These pivotal parameters are generally classified as: 1) solution parameters, 2) processing parameters and 3) ambient parameters.130 In the present effort, firstly, the solution parameters such as the concentration of solution, molecular weight of the polymer, viscosity, and conductivity along with surface charge density will be discussed followed by the processing parameters namely the flow rate and working voltage with specific attention towards the tip to collector distance (TCD). In conclusion, the impact of reaction parameters namely reaction temperature, humidity and pressure will be explored.
3.1. Influence of solution parameters

3.1.1. Effect of concentration. 
It is well-known that variation in the polymeric solution concentration shows a significant influence on the stretching of the polymer droplet on the tip of the needle into the charged uniaxial jet during the electrospinning process.131,132 Usually, under an applied electric field, the fragmentation of polymer entanglements occurs when the polymer solution has a very low concentration, which further leads to the formation of micro or nanobeads. At a slightly higher solution concentration, formation of beaded nanofibers takes place. Furthermore, as the concentration of a polymer solution becomes optimum, the entanglement between the polymer chains gets enhanced, thereby leading to the formation of smooth nanofibers. Therefore, it can be said that, depending upon the increase or decrease in the polymeric solution concentration, the surface tension and viscous properties of solution can easily be tailored and adjusted, which ultimately decides the electrospinnability of the polymeric solution.99
Furthermore, as the polymeric solution concentration goes beyond its critical value, the polymer hinders the free movement of the solution through the spinneret tip popularly known as ‘clogging’. Therefore, as a consequence of this clogging process morphological changes in nanofibers in the form of beads or helix shaped micro ribbons are observed.133,134 For example, Senthil and Anandan studied the influence of the concentration of styrene–acrylonitrile and dimethyl formamide further designated as SAN–DMF polymeric solution on spinnability with different concentrations in the range of 8–30 wt/v%. As displayed in Fig. 5, nanobeads were obtained when the concentration was in the range of 8–10% for the SAN–DMF polymeric solution, a mixture of beads and fibers with the increase in diameter at a SAN–DMF polymeric solution concentration of 12–20% and growth of smooth continuous fibers as the concentration of the SAN–DMF polymeric solution increased to 25–30%.135 Hekmati et al.136 and Noorpoor et al. also observed a similar effect of concentration on polyamide nanofibers.137 In another instance, Matabola and Moutloali used polyvinylidene fluoride and dimethyl acetamide (PVDF–DMAc) solution at different concentrations mostly in the range of 22–28 wt%.138 An elongated bubble-like morphology was obtained at lower concentrations and smooth fibers were obtained at higher concentration with a gradual increase in the nanofiber diameter in the range of 98–397 nm.138 A similar effect was found by Hao Shao and group for PVDF/(DMF/acetone) polymer solution with the increase of solution concentration from 16–26 wt%.139
 Fig. 5  Effect of concentration of SAN–DMF polymeric solution ranging from 8 to 30 wt/v% on electrospun nanofiber morphology.135 Reproduced from ref. 135 with permission from SAGE, copyright 2015. 
Apart from these, the nanofibers prepared with polyurethane solution (5–10 wt%),140 poly acrylonitrile solution (5–8 wt%),141,142 poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) solution (5–9 wt%)143 and poly L-Lactide solution (5–9 wt%)144 have also shown a similar trend towards the influence of concentration on electrospun nanofibers. Furthermore, in the year 2016, Hossain et al. investigated the effect of both the blend ratio and solution concentration on the electrospinnability, diameter and morphology of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) abbreviated as (HP-β-CD/PEO) nanofibers.145 Their study revealed that the morphology and diameter of the nanofibers are significantly affected by the mass ratio as compared to the polymer concentration. Using 8 wt% solution of HP-β-CD/PEO blends in the ratio of 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50 resulted in the formation of uniform nanofibers with average diameters of 264, 244 and 236 nm, respectively.145 All of the above reports confirm that the polymeric solution concentration can deeply affect the physicochemical properties of the electrospun nanofibers, wherein properties such as morphology and diameter are controlled both by the type of polymer and the solution used during the synthesis process.


3.1.2. Influence of viscosity as well as molecular weight. 
Numerous efforts have been made to study the influence of viscosity on nanofibers and their properties.146 It has been found that when the viscosity is high, as a result of hard ejection of the polymer solution, an increase in the jet thickness is observed which leads to the formation of nanofibers with appreciable thickness.147 At lower viscosity, rupture of polymeric entanglements occurs due to the effect of factors like electric field and surface tension which results in either beads or beaded fibers.148 As the viscosity of the polymeric solution increases in a gradual way, the fiber shape changes from bead to spindle.149 Once the critical level of viscosity is attained, viscoelastic forces avoid any further fragmentation of polymer chain entanglements which leads to the production of continuous and uniform nanofibers.149 This concept was extensively studied by Cramariuc et al.147 as well as Zadeh et al.150 Both groups explored the influence of viscosity on the morphological architecture and diameter of electrospun Mullite nanofibers via employing PVA as a template. They obtained continuous nanofibers with cylindrical morphology at a lower PVA concentration of 6 wt%, whereas at a very high viscosity level, the morphology of the nanofibers changed to wide and flat ribbons, after sintering at 1200 °C, as shown in Fig. 6. In addition, the obtained Mullite nanofibers showed a diameter of 85–130 nm.150

Correspondingly, the molecular weight of any polymeric matrix also has a crucial impact on the morphological and physical properties of nanofibers.151–153 Moreover, based on viscosity, the molecular weight of the polymer and the extent of entanglement of clustered polymeric chains vary for solutions with fixed concentration.154 By keeping the concentration constant as well as reduction in the molecular weight, the morphology of nanofibers can be altered from smooth fibers to bead-like structures. In contrast, a subsequent increase in molecular weight tends to form smooth nanofibers.155 Further as the molecular weight increases, the morphology of the polymer changes from nanofibers to micro-ribbons. The corresponding FE-SEM images with respect to the change in molecular weight of the polymer are displayed in Fig. 7.155 In the case of a solution with lower concentration and a polymer with very high molecular weight formation of micro-ribbon-like fiber structures is observed. Nevertheless, for a solution containing oligomers with intermolecular interaction among them, the specific molecular weight is not essential to form uniform nanofibers.155

3.1.3. Effect of solution conductivity. 
Solution conductivity commands significant control on the nanofiber diameter because the solution conductivity can greatly influence the Taylor cone formation.156,157 A Taylor cone is usually formed only when the solution has a conductive nature.158 Ideally, in a non-conductive solution, there is no availability of free moving charges to move up to the surface of the droplet and form a Taylor cone under the effect of an optimum applied working voltage.158 Therefore, owing to unavailability of free moving charges, solutions with low conductivity fail to form a Taylor cone.158 In such cases, a minimum quantity of salt is mixed with the solution in order to facilitate free moving charges required for Taylor cone formation. Nevertheless, by enhancing the conductivity of the solution to a critical level, it is possible to form a Taylor cone due to the presence of abundant free charges and their interaction with the external electric field.158 In other words, it can also be said that a conducting polymer solution contains enough charges to generate electrostatic force between the applied electric field and electrical free charge, unlike non-conducting polymer solutions.159 Finally, once the Taylor cone is well constructed, the initiated jets form thin and homogeneous nanofibers. In addition, when the solution conductivity appears to be more than the critical value, there is a decrease along the surface of the solution and hence the acting tangential electric field also decreases, which significantly disturbs the construction of the Taylor cone.159 Therefore, it is important that a balanced conductivity is maintained for enabling the formation of Taylor cones in order to obtain uniform nanofibers with appreciable diameter.160

3.2. Influence of processing parameters

3.2.1. Effect of applied voltage. 
In addition to the solution parameters, equally important is considering the processing parameters on the electrospun nanofiber-based materials.161 Typically, in order to form a stable Taylor cone from a spherical droplet, a certain level of voltage is applied with reference to the nature of components in the solution.162,163 As the applied voltage is increased, consequently, coulombic repulsion of charges within the jet also increases. As a result, thinner nanofibers are formed as there is stretching out of the jet.164 However, a voltage which is higher than the critical value gives rise to two different structural architectures.165 Interestingly, as the voltage increases, nanobeads are transformed into beaded nanofibers, whereas flat thin nanofibers are formed from cylindrical nanofibers, as shown in Fig. 8. This behavior can firstly be accredited to the decrease in the size of the Taylor cone and secondly to the increase in the speed of electrospinning at a higher voltage.138

3.2.2. Effect of flow rate. 
Another important parameter that shows a significant effect on the diameter and morphology of nanofibers is the flow rate of the polymeric solution.165 Under lower flow rates, sufficient polymer solution remains unavailable at the needle tip for formation of a Taylor cone. Under an optimum flow rate, stable Taylor cone formation takes place which results in the development of beadless uniform nanofibers.165 In the case of low flow rates, proper drying takes place in the jet, which results in elongated nanofibers.166 In contrast, for higher flow rates, beaded or bead-free thick nanofibers are usually formed.166 Subsequently, it can be said that the flow rate changes starting from one solution to another with respect to the different polymer nature. For instance, Cai et al. systematically investigated the influence of the flow rate on the structure and diameter of electrospun chlorinated poly(vinyl-chloride) CPVC nanofibers.167 Their study revealed that the diameter of the CPVC nanofibers gradually increases with increasing flow rate starting from 0.2 mL h−1 up to 1.0 mL h−1. The increase in diameter was attributed to fiber adhesion due to incomplete evaporation of the solvent as shown in Fig. 9(a).167 Similar results were observed by Lin et al. aimed at developing a polymer solution of thermoplastic carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as represented in Fig. 9(b)168 and by Li et al. for a polymer solution of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP).143 In addition, for certain polymer solutions, the higher flow rate can change highly beaded fibers into uniform nanofibers consisting of very few beads (Fig. 9(c)). The thickness of the nanofiber is more sensitive to the solution concentration and flow rate than the working voltage and needle tip to collector distance.155 Increasing the flow rate of a solution above the critical value leads to reduction in surface charge per unit of volume and incomplete evaporation of the solvent from the nanofibrous jet.169 Under these conditions, the thickness of the nanofiber increases, as well as the number of beads, the pore diameter and in some cases, ribbon-like microfibers are formed. An extremely high flow rate can form web or net-like patterned nanofibers.170

3.2.3. Effect of needle tip to collector distance (TCD). 
The needle tip to collector distance likewise plays a significant role in controlling the morphology and thickness of electrospun nanofibers.171 Like other parameters, the TCD also needs to be optimized based on the polymer solution.172 By tuning the TCD, it is possible to control solvent evaporation, jet flight time and whipping interval, and these factors in turn control the structure and diameter of nanofibers.173 The scientific community has made significant effort to study the effect of the TCD on nanofiber properties and it is suggested that the diameter of the nanofibers reduces with the increase in the TCD. The effect of the TCD on the morphology of PVDF nanofibers was systematically investigated by Matabola et al.138 At a voltage of 12 kV, they utilized 28 wt% PVDF solution for electrospinning by increasing the TCD to 16 cm. In their study, an increase in the distance decreased the diameter of the PVDF nanofibers from 397 nm to 314 nm. The decrease in the fiber diameter is favored by complete solvent evaporation, which is further modified with stretching of the polymeric jet followed by its thinning as shown in Fig. 10(a).138 Similar results are also reported by other research groups.174–176 In these references, it was shown that when the distance is optimum, more uniform nanofibers are formed, whereas when the distance is very long or very short, defective or beaded nanofibers are obtained.

(b) No influence of TCD on morphology and diameter of electrospun PVA/Zr n-propoxide nanofibers.178 Reproduced from ref. 178 with permission from Springer Nature, copyright 2012. 
Although most of the reports show that the nanofiber diameter increases with an increase in distance, in some reports the increase in distance reduces the influence of the electric field, and as a result nanofibers of larger diameter will be formed.177 For example, Singh et al. prepared PVA/Zr n-propoxide nanofibers by electrospinning using a voltage of 13 kV and maintaining a feed rate of 8.5 mL min−1 wherein the TCD was maintained in the range of 3.5–6.5 cm.176 They observed that the fiber size distribution at 3.5 cm was in the range from 170 to 550 nm and at 6.5 cm in the range of 325 to 855 nm, respectively. This was attributed to the electric field strength decline along with the electrostatic repulsive force decline acting on the fiber jet. This factor further reduced the stretching and thinning of the PVA/Zr n-propoxide composite nanofibers.176 In contrast to the explanation provided by Matabola et al.,138 Singh and co-workers confirmed that the TCD shows no significant influence on the size and morphology of nanofibers.176 The polymer jet does not get sufficient time for solvent evaporation when the distance is shorter. Thus, binding between the single layers of nanofibers occurs due to residual solvent and as a result develops a network arrangement with high mechanical stability. When the distance is optimal, the nanofiber gets an adequate interval for solidification, which could result in the continuous deposition of separate and uniform nanofibers on the collector. However, when the distance is greater, the mean fiber diameter increases because of lower electrostatic force, causing poor stretching of nanofibers (Fig. 10(b)). Therefore, to fabricate smooth and uniform nanofibers, an optimum TCD is very important.179

3.3. Influence of environmental (ambient) parameters
Under ambient parameters, relative humidity (RH) and temperature are the two most influencing factors in determining the shape and diameter of electrospun nanofibers. Generally, for the case of optimum viscosity, at lower ambient humidity nanofibers without any defect will be formed.180 In contrast, for the case of higher viscosity, short nanofibers with a rough surface will be formed. For the case of very high humidity, electrospinning is not possible.180 However, the influence of ambient parameters varies from one polymer to another. If the polymer solution is hydrophilic, an increase of RH shows a negative effect on the diameter of the electrospun nanofibers.154 This usually happens for two reasons wherein, either humidity acts as a plasticizing agent by loosening the crystal, thereby leading to enhanced movement of polymer chains, or it can avoid the quick evaporation of the solvent leading to proper stretching and hardening of the fiber jet. Pelipenko et al. systematically investigated the influence of the increase in RH on the size of PEO and PVA pure nanofibers and blend nanofibers of PEO/Cs and PVA/Ha. A drastic decrease in the nanofiber diameter for all the solutions chosen was observed, with the increase of RH. For very higher humidity levels, beads were obtained, and in the case of blend solutions, electrospinning was not observed. The representative FE-SEM images based on the effect of humidity on the diameter of PVA, PVA/Hp and PEO nanofibers are shown in Fig. 11.181
 Fig. 11  FE-SEM images based on the effect of humidity on the diameter of (a) PVA, (b) PVA/Hp and (c) PEO electrospun nanofibers (A = 4%, B = 10%, C = 20%, D = 30%, E = 40%, F = 50%, G = 60%, H = 70%).181 Reproduced from ref. 181 with permission from SAGE, copyright 2015. 
In another study, for polyamides (PA46 and PA69), an increase in the RH level decreased the diameter of nanofibers. And the decreasing effect was higher for PA46 than PA69. Interestingly, this decrease was attributed to the higher hydrophilicity and lower crystallinity of PA46 in comparison to the PA69 polymer; wherein the absorbed humidity acted as a plasticizer by decreasing the amount of stable crystals, which caused more stretching of the PA46 polymer jet than that of PA69.182 In electrospinning, humidity can influence both the surface and core morphology of nanofibers through different phenomena, based on the different components of the solution. Humidity might cause phase separation and charge imbalance on the top surface because of charge-exchange from the solution to the surrounding humidity in the Taylor cone as well as in jet regions.182
Ambient temperature is an essential parameter in electrospinning of nanofibers.183 For a higher temperature, thicker nanofibers are formed due to the increased rate of volatility of solvents, allowing a short time for the solidification of the polymer jet. Oğulata and İçoğlu et al. examined the influence of RH and temperature on the thickness of PEI nanofibers by changing the solution concentration between 18 and 20 wt%, the TCD between 12 and 18 cm and the voltage between 15 and 25 kV.174 Nanofibers produced from 20% PEI solution exhibited a maximum increase in thickness with the increase of RH from 30% to 70% and temperature from 15–35 °C.174 It was also noticed that the maximum decrease in diameter of the nanofibers was observed at 15–35 °C for all the RH values. For a TCD of 12 cm, in the temperature range of 15 to 25 °C, the average diameter of the fibers decreased and then at each RH value, an increase in diameter was observed in the temperature range of 25–35 °C. Therefore, in order to obtain uniform and defect-less nanofibers it is necessary to optimize RH and temperature.
4. Electrospun nanofibers as efficient filtration membranes in water purification
According to the present global situation, keeping the production and consumption of fresh water in balance is a highly challenging task.184–186 Since the demand for fresh water is increasing with each passing day, developing advanced filtration technology as an alternative to existing conventional desalination and sewage water treatment technologies is very essential.187 For several decades, significant effort has been made across the globe to develop efficient nanofibrous filtration membranes for water purification technologies. The water purification membranes prepared by phase inversion techniques possess few demerits such as low permeate flux, membrane fouling and difficulty in controlling the pore size.153,187 Filtration membranes prepared by electrospinning have become the best alternatives that can outperform phase inversion membranes due to advantages such as interconnected open pore voids, well-tuned thickness and pore size distribution in the range of nanometers to several microns, allowing high performances in water filtration.188Table 1 contains a few examples of electrospun nanofibrous membranes and filters that have been used for different water treatment applications. The various membrane processes and potential applications using electrospun nanofibers are more specifically detailed in the following paragraphs.

4.1. Various membrane processes using electrospun nanofibers

4.1.1. Electrospun nanofibers for membrane distillation (MD). 
Membrane distillation (MD) is a non-isothermal separation process wherein a hot feed and cold permeate are separated by a microporous hydrophobic membrane, through which only vapor molecules pass from the feed side to the permeate side due to the vapor pressure difference.233 MD is an emerging efficient technique for desalination, industrial effluent treatment, wastewater treatment, radioactive waste treatment, non-volatile compound recovery, precious metal recovery, concentrating liquid food products such as milk, fruit juice, herbal extracts, etc.234 There are different MD configurations depending upon the technology used at the permeate side to maintain the driving force. They are: 1. direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), in which the cold water stream which is in contact with the surface of the membrane is used in the permeate side, and the vapor molecules transported from the feed side get condensed into this cold steam.235–237 2. In vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), an optimum vacuum pressure is applied at the permeate side to maintain the driving force as well as to carry vapors from the permeate chamber to the condenser to obtain pure water.238–240 3. In air gap membrane distillation (AGMD), a stagnant air gap has been used in the permeate side, which lies between the membrane and the freezing cold surface used for the condensation of vapors. The air gap provides a thermal insulation between the membrane and the cold surface, which significantly aids in reduction of conductive heat loss through the membrane and increases the energy efficiency of the AGMD configuration.241,242 4. In sweep gas membrane distillation (SGMD), gases namely air or nitrogen push the permeate chamber to carry the evaporated molecules to the condenser placed outside the permeate chamber to obtain a pure distillate.243,244 It is well-proven that with the increase in pore size or porosity, the MD permeate flux increases, whereas as the membrane thickness increases, the MD permeate flux decreases.245,246 Therefore, permeate fluxes of high rates are achieved using thin membranes which have highly porous nature, maximum pore size and low pore tortuosity, whereas thicker membranes provide low heat transfer flux. Interestingly, a good choice for MD and its application is a compromise that depends both on high permeate flux and low heat transfer flux.191 The properties of an ideal MD membrane are presented in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  Schematic representation of the MD process via an ideal nanofibrous MD membrane. 
In recent times, nanofibrous membranes developed by using the electrospinning technique have been broadly accepted as promising candidates for MD application due to their interconnected porosity93,234 and interestingly, they usually exhibit good flexibility to control the pore size, hydrophobicity, thickness and good resistivity to chemical and biological entities.93 Despite its undeniable advantages, this technique possesses some disadvantages such as temperature polarization, low permeate flux, pore wetting and low mechanical properties which reduce the energy efficiency of the MD processes.247 For instance, the increase in thickness of the membrane negatively affects its performance.247 In contrast, for a thicker membrane, the decrease in the mean size of interfiber space causes an increase in pressure during liquid entry due to the increased pore tortuosity, which can also result in its poor performance.248 Recent developments in nanotechnology have created a wide range of opportunities for the development of MD membranes. In order to improve the DCMD performance efficiency of hydrophobic (PVDF, PTFE, PP etc.) electrospun nanofibrous membranes, several modification techniques such as hot press treatment, loading cellulose nanocrystals as reinforcing agents, use of clay nanoparticles, blending approach and surface modification, to name a few, have been reported.249–252 In this regard, Liao et al. reported the influence of post-treatment on heat press followed by electrospinning process variables namely moving speed of the spinneret, humidity and polymer dope compositions which consist of inorganic additives and their concomitant effect on the pore size distribution and DCMD performance of PVDF electrospun nanofibrous membranes.252 They obtained better results for the PVDF electrospun nanofibrous membranes which were subjected to post-treatment when compared with untreated membranes.252 In another recent study, for the first time, Liao et al. fabricated a dual layer silica/PVDF microporous composite membrane by the electrospinning technique.253 On the basis of experimental findings, it was found that the membrane performances of the silica/PVDF microporous composite improved drastically when compared to conventional PVDF nanofibrous membranes.253 The silica/PVDF microporous composite membrane exhibited a permeate flux (20 °C) of 18.9 kg m−2 h−1 for a feed solution consisting of 3.5 wt% NaCl at a temperature of 50 °C in an operating duration of 50 h. In another report, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanofibrous membranes were synthesized by sintering of the composite nanofiber obtained from electrospinning of PTFE/PVA precursor solution for its application in VMD.251 Dong et al. developed a superhydrophobic nanofibrous membrane by grafting fluoroalkyl silane onto PVA nanofibers cross-linked with glutaraldehyde.254 The resultant membranes exhibited better stability and performed better than the PTFE commercial membrane in the VMD process.254
In order to understand the influence of nanofiber diameter on AGMD performance, Guo et al. modified the poly(trimethylene hexamethylene terephthalamide) (PA6-3-T) nanofibrous membranes by coating them with poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (PPFDA) via the initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) technique. The membranes with fiber diameter in the range of 0.25 to 1.8 mm obtained were studied for the AGMD desalination process by using 3.5 wt% NaCl solution as a feed. The permeate flux placed in the middle of the hot feed solution and the cold condenser plate increased from 2 to 11 kg m−2 h−1 with the increase of temperature from 25–40 °C. This was due to enhanced hydrophobicity and liquid entry pressure (LEP) with the decrease of membrane porosity from 84% to 69%.255 Shon et al. developed PVDF nanofibrous membranes of low surface energy via CF4 plasma surface modification, for AGMD. They observed that the resultant CF2–CF2 and CF3 new bonds led to the omniphobic property of the membranes with lowering in surface energy and improvement in wetting resistance against liquids such as alcohols and mineral oils with low surface tension.256 Bilayer nanofibrous membranes consisting of a PH active hydrophobic layer and hydrophilic support layers made of different polymers such as PVA, polyamide, and PAN were developed for the AGMD process by Woo et al.; in their membranes the water contact angle (WCA) of the active layer was about 140° and that of the bottom support layers was below 90°. The hydrophilicity of the bottom support layer enhanced the efficiency of these bilayer membranes.257 Apart from these, PS-based nanofiber membranes with super hydrophobicity have also shown better performances in rejecting NaCl from feed solutions compared to conventional membranes.258 Therefore, in summary it can be said that MD processes such as desalination of various water sources can be successfully achieved with good flux by employing electrospun nanofiber membranes with superhydrophobic properties and tunable pore sizes as ideal participants (Fig. 13).259

4.1.2. Electrospun nanofibers for microfiltration. 
As another important application towards a sustainable eco-system, electrospun microfiltration membranes have been vastly used for removal of micro and sub micro pollutants such as parasites, sand, cryptosporidium, organic suspended particles, Giardia lamblia, viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi and suspended microparticles from wastewater or any other liquid media.260–262 Most importantly, the flexibility of the electrospinning technique to tailor the properties of nanofibers has provided an opportunity to construct microfiltration membranes with uniform pores and as a result enhanced mechanical properties.260–262 Consequently, electrospun nanofibers appear as an alternative to traditional solution cast microfiltration membranes.260–263 For example, Liu et al. fabricated a microfiltration membrane using PVA electrospun nanofibers and glutaraldehyde as a cross linker.190 The resultant membrane exhibited a seven-fold increase in permeate flux when compared to the Millipore GSWP membrane with a pore size of 0.22 mm along with a rejection of about 98% for polycarboxylate microspheres with pore size in the range of 0.2 mm as shown in Fig. 14.190 They suggested that the pore size of an ideal electrospun microfiltration membrane should be less than 0.2 mm to successfully remove bacteria and other unicellular microorganisms from water. Furthermore, a microfiltration membrane with an average pore size in the range of 0.22–0.01 mm fabricated using electrospun PAN nanofibers on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) non-woven substrate showed significantly improved performance when compared to a commercial microfiltration membrane by maintaining a high flux with 99.9999% rejection towards bacteria (Escherichia coli). This report hence confirmed that the modification of electrospinning parameters results in the modification of the pore size of the microfiltration membranes which are applicable for various applications.190

In addition, PAN/PET microfiltration membranes infused with cellulose nanowhiskers and a PAN nanofiber membrane after functionalization of its surface by using monomers such as dual-vinyl and tri-vinyl monomers showed relevant capability for water treatment due to size exclusion and adsorption mechanisms.264 Most of the microfiltration membranes are prepared by using commodity polymer-based membranes. Nevertheless, such membranes are non-degradable and extremely hazardous to the environment.265,266 Therefore, to avoid the environmental impact of commodity plastics, development of innovative and environment friendly polymers which are derived from natural resources is highly favored. In the year 2013, Li et al. developed annealing treatment modified microfiltration membranes by using electrospun poly-lactic acid (PLA) nanofibers.189 The mechanical properties of the as-spun PLA membranes improved with annealing treatment as confirmed using the Mullen burst test (Fig. 15). The Mullen burst test confirmed that a higher bursting pressure was possessed by the annealed membranes due to the increase in the degree of crystallinity and the formation of inter-fibrous fusion between the pores as can be seen in Fig. 15. Further, their solid rejection performance showed 85% rejection after annealing of the as-spun PLA membranes at 90 °C for 30 min.189

In another report, a microfiltration membrane (pore size range ∼10 nm) prepared with cellulose acetate nanofiber coated with chitin nanocrystals was reported by Lee et al.267 The incorporation of chitin nanocrystals onto the cellulose acetate nanofiber decreased the bio-fouling tendency and increased the hydrophilicity and mechanical properties.267 This made the CA membranes suitable for high flux water purification processes. In another report, an electrospun nanofibrous microfiltration membrane obtained from M-aramid exhibited significantly increased particle rejections for PS latex beads of size 0.20 μm (>99%). Meanwhile, the commercial GSWP filter showed a lower rejection capacity of 95.91% towards PS latex beads.267 Later, Bae et al. fabricated PES nanofibrous membranes by using the solution of an optimum mixture of PES and NMP as a solvent. The resultant microporous (pore size = 0.4175 μm) membrane exhibited tensile strength around 11 MPa and more importantly the particle rejection along with flux activity was eight times higher as compared to commercially available electrospun nanofibers. Due to the low volatility of NMP, the remaining solvent caused the inter nanofibrous junctions to dissolve and fuse, thereby increasing the mechanical properties and surface roughness.268

4.2. Various applications of electrospun nanofibers

4.2.1. Electrospun nanofibers for desalination processes. 
The demand for fresh water has been increasing rapidly to fulfill the requirements in agriculture, industries and other human activities.269 This has led to a severe crisis for fresh water in several regions of the globe.270 There is an urgent need for efficient seawater and high salinity brine desalination techniques in order to balance the fresh water distribution both for coastal and inland areas and to preserve the societal equilibrium between humanity and the eco-system. In simple terms, desalination is an extraction or removal process for salts and various minerals from aqueous systems.271 There are many thermally driven desalination methods such as vacuum distillation (VD), multi-stage flash distillation (MSFD),272 multiple effect distillation (MED),273 and vapor compression – these are the conventional methods and there are widely accepted membrane filtration methods which include reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) and these are pressure driven desalination techniques; membrane distillation (MD is a thermally driven desalination technique, while forward osmosis (FO) is an osmotic pressure driven technique, as well as other electrodialytic techniques.271,274
Traditional thermal desalination processes possess a major disadvantage of higher energy requirement and hence membrane-based desalination techniques such as RO, FO, and NF are gaining widespread importance.275,276 Various nanostructured materials have been widely investigated and studied to enhance the physicochemical properties and filtration performance with reference to RO and NF membranes.277,278 Particularly, an electrospun nanofibrous layer has been applied as a porous supportive layer, above which using the interfacial polymerization method a thin polyamide layer is deposited.279 Such membranes are known as thin film nanocomposite membranes (TFNC membranes).280,281 In recent research, tremendous focus has been devoted towards designing TFNC membranes with high performance.282,283 The scope for TFNC membranes has been significantly increased exponentially due to their high performance in the removal of monovalent ions/salts, various minerals and toxic substances from contaminated water.282,283
Further, TFNC membranes are believed to be suitable candidates as replacement for conventional (NF, RO) membranes due to their stability and high performance arising from the selective top layer and middle torturous pore channels.282,283 On the other hand, FO and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) are the most commonly used techniques based on the low energy approach for desalination.284–286 The overall efficiency of FO and PRO processes significantly varies with the type of membrane and draw solution and its concentration.284,285 However, the performance of FO and PRO TFNC membranes is sometimes suppressed by several drawbacks including membrane fouling, concentration polarization (CP) and reverse solute flux.287,288 Thus, the supportive layers of TFNC membranes need to be re-engineered to make the desalination process economically feasible. Fig. 16 presents a typical lab-scale setup for PRO.289

PAN, CA, PES, and polyamide nanofibers are the most commonly used fibers for fabricating supportive layers of FO and PRO membranes due to their high intrinsic porosity.194 Chou et al. fabricated novel hollow fibers with an inner wall coated with a thin film formed by interfacial polymerization of MPD and TMC monomers as shown in Fig. 17. They explored their membrane performance by using a 1 M NaCl solution as the draw solution and 10 mM as the feed solution. Their membranes showed power density and specific reverse salt flux at 15 bar pressure of 20.9 W m−2 and 0.03 mole per L, respectively (Fig. 17(f)).290 In another interesting report, Hoover et al. prepared a high performance thin film composite membrane using electrospun nanofibers of polyethylene terephthalate, consisting of a microporous polysulfone layer and a polyamide layer formed by phase separation and interfacial polymerization, respectively.291

Another viable membrane with high performance for FO application was prepared by Tian et al.195 They fabricated TFNC membranes by employing PVDF nanofiber mats as a substrate, and on top of them they prepared the coating of a polyamide thin film layer (on two substrates namely S1 and S2) by controlling the pore size and surface roughness of the TFC membranes and varying the extent of cross linking.195 Comparison studies suggested that the thinner polyamide membrane was easier to form on substrates with higher crosslinking density and smaller pore sizes. The resultant membranes were investigated for their FO performance with a value of 30.4 L m−2 h−1 when the active layer faced the draw solution (1 M NaCl). The corresponding water flux and salt rejection profiles of the two prepared membranes namely TFD-1# and TFC-2# using distilled water as the feed water at 5 bar pressure are displayed in Fig. 18.195

Further, Song et al. fabricated a TFNC membrane for PRO application using PAN, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and PVA as starting materials.198 Moreover, Huang et al. developed a TFC membrane with an electrospun PVDF nanofibrous substrate which consisted of a thin film layer of nylon 6,6 on the top developed by interfacial polymerization of adipoyl chloride and 1,6-hexane diamine. A representative schematic illustration for the formation of the polyamide thin film onto hydrophilic supports with different pore sizes is shown in Fig. 19.292 The resultant membrane exhibited higher hydrophilicity, mechanical robustness and is less prone to swelling than pristine nylon 6,6 fibers having excellent flux performance.292 Similar to the observations made by Tian et al.195 they also found that denser and selective polyamide layers with greater tolerance for pressure were formed with smaller pores.

Later on, Tian et al. successfully developed a membrane with a tiered structure with a support layer of multi-walled carbon nanotube (f-CNT) reinforced polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibers and a nanometer thick polyamide-based selective top skin layer as shown in Fig. 20.289 Effective membranes for forward osmosis application were also fabricated by electrospinning of cross-linked PVA due to its ability to form a support with good hydrophilicity and tortuous pores of low density. Compared to commercial FO membranes, the resultant cross-linked membranes showed an eight-fold higher permeate flux.194 PSF/TiO2 nanocomposite fibrous substrates were prepared by electrospinning with different amounts of TiO2 loading and at the top of the surface of the composite substrate a thin layer of polyamide layer was constructed using 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyltrichloride and 1,3-phenylendiamine through interfacial polymerization.194 Additionally, Tian et al. prepared a FO membrane consisting of an interpenetrating composite nanofibrous support network of hydrophilic PVA/hydrophobic PET. It was observed that with the increase in the PVA content, the flux increased.196 Based on the above reports, it can therefore be concluded that nanofiber membranes could be effectively used for FO and PRO applications and the desalination activity can further be tailored by developing more efficient electrospun nanofibers.

4.2.2. Removal of heavy metal ions. 
In consideration of healthy living and a cleaner environment, the efficient separation of highly toxic metal ions from aqueous systems (especially from ground water and industrial effluent) is believed to be an important paradigm for a better future and enhanced vitality rates.293 Many advanced techniques have been proposed for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions such as irradiation or radiation treatment,294 solvent extraction,295 chemical precipitation,296 electrodialytic separation,297 adsorptive membrane filtration,298etc. However, most of these techniques are not convenient due to the large amount of reagent consumption and sludge formation. Meanwhile, the adsorption technique is considered to be a simple and economically viable technique.299 The successful removal of heavy metals depends upon certain characteristics of an adsorbent like a high specific surface area, interconnected porosity, and high thermal and radiation stability.191,300 Most importantly, drinking water polluted with toxic heavy metals can induce severe health risks. For example, As(III) and As(V) can lead to disorders in the brain, heart, digestive system and skin in human beings.301 Other than arsenic, chromium has also been found in various oxidation states in water. Cr(VI) gets easily ingested into the human body as it is the most stable form in the environment. Cr(VI) induces more mutagenic and cancerous effects in the healthy cells of the human body.302 Further, it can result in hematological disorders which can be characterized by abnormal features of blood cells.303 In addition, although Cr(III) plays an important role as an insulin-enhancing pharmaceutical, detailed studies suggest that Cr(III) can be a highly dangerous cationic group considering the fact that it is genotoxic in nature.304 Furthermore, intake of drinking water with fluoride concentration more than 1 mg L−1 causes dental and skeletal fluorosis. Considering the harmful effects of these metals, it is important to remove them and clean the contaminated water sources, keeping in mind the health factors.
Recently, electrospun nanofibers have been extensively studied for the removal of toxic metal ions, because of their high surface area for functionality and the interconnected porosity of nanofibers allows a higher amount of targeted metal ions to interact with the surface of the nanofibrous adsorptive membrane.305 Polymers with functional groups like amine, carboxylic acid and hydroxyl have shown excellent metal ion adsorption efficiency.305 In a benchmark literature report, chitosan has been reported as a very common adsorbent due to its strong interaction with metal ions through amine groups.306 Chitosan nanofibers provide a simple and effective way for heavy metal ion removal compared with its other material forms.307,308 Chitosan electrospun nanofibrous membranes were used by Yang et al. for removal of As(V) and various organic contaminants from water, and they found that at acidic pH (3.4) the adsorption capacity of the membrane was too high, 30.8 mg g−1,232 which was the greatest performance reported for chitosan materials for As(V) removal. In another interesting study, Sharma et al. explored the efficiency of electrospun cerium-chitosan/PVA composite nanofibers to remove As(III) from water and the adsorbent was more efficient than other adsorbents reported in the literature with an adsorption efficiency of 18.8 mg g−1. Fig. 21 shows a plausible surface adsorption mechanism of the As(III) ions on the electrospun Ce-CHT/PVA composite nanofibers.309

The electrospun chitosan/hydroxyapatite (Cs/HAp) composite nanofibrous membranes were used by Aliabadi et al. for removal of heavy metals namely nickel, cobalt and lead ions from their aqueous solutions. The reported membranes showed greater adsorption efficiency for Pb (296.7 mg g−1), Cd (213.8 mg g−1) and Ni (180.2 mg g−1) ions, respectively.310 In another report, Lakhdhar et al. used biomass-based electrospun nanofibrous membranes of (PEO)/chitosan for removal of Cu ions from water ((Fig. 22(b)).311 Apart from these, easily biodegradable and reusable polylactide/chitosan electrospun membranes were prepared by Lee et al. for the removal of heavy metal ions from water ((Fig. 22(c)).312 Similarly, PVA/ZnO-based electrospun nanofiber adsorbents were fabricated by Hallaji et al., who studied the efficiency of the membranes for the removal of metal ions such as Cu(II), Ni(II) and U(VI), ions from aqueous solutions ((Fig. 22(d)).218 Additionally, Keshtkar et al. also prepared electrospun and solution casted homogeneous membranes made up of PVA/TEOS/APTES as starting materials to purify water from contaminated uranium sources.313

Inorganic alumina-based nanofibers were synthesized using the electrospinning technique and a precursor solution containing PVP and aluminum acetate followed by heat treatment.228 The resultant fibers were able to remove 70% of Cr(VI) and 50% of fluoride ions.228 Similarly, Fe2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxide nanocomposite fibers were successfully prepared by electrospinning of impregnated boehmite into iron acetylacetonate and PVP polymer solution. The obtained Fe2O3–Al2O3 mixed nanocomposite fibers were able to remove ions such as Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solutions.314 In a further attempt to remove other metal ions from aqueous solutions, Wu et al. prepared an electrospun polypyrrole–polyethersulfone abbreviated as PPy/PES nanofiber membrane to separate silver Ag(II) ions from water.315 An adsorption efficiency of 35.7 mg for Ag(I) ions per gram of the PES/PPy membrane was achieved.315 Additionally, in order to eliminate toxic Cr ions from water, Zhou et al. developed a composite nanofiber of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/ferrous chloride (FeCl2) by the electrospinning technique wherein an excellent Cr adsorption efficiency in the range of 108 mg Cr per g FeCl2 was observed.316


4.2.3. Electrospun nanofibers for dye removal. 
The industries manufacturing leather products, textiles, food products, cosmetics, paints, papers and pharmaceutical products discharge a large amount of effluents containing a variety of dye molecules which are harmful to the environment.317,318 There are various treatment techniques for the removal of dyes from water such as adsorption, membrane filtration, photocatalytic degradation, coagulation, biodegradation, wetland treatment, sonolysis, and ozonation, to name a few. Among all these methods, adsorptive removal of dyes is the simplest and most effective method. The dye removal from water using nanofibers will be carried out either through a physical adsorption mechanism or chemical adsorption mechanism. Physical adsorption of dyes takes place through electrostatic interaction and other intermolecular forces between the dye and the adsorbent material. Meanwhile, in chemical adsorption the dye molecules interact with the adsorbent through stable chemical interactions. The electrospun nanofibers can provide excellent dye adsorption efficiency due to their high specific surface area and porosity.319 The dye adsorption efficiency of nanofibers can be improved through i) functionalizing the nanofiber surface by using adsorptive chemicals with required functional groups or ii) by modifying the fiber surface via a reduction process using specific reducing agents.106 However, the ambient factors such as pH and temperature can alter the adsorption efficiency of adsorbents. Based on the charge, the dye molecules are classified into non-ionic and ionic dyes. In ionic dyes again, there are two types: 1. anionic dyes and 2. cationic dyes. Functional materials that are generally incorporated to nanofibers to adsorb dyes from water are nanoparticles, 2D materials like graphene oxide (GO), polymers with amine functionality, and organic molecules like β-cyclodextrin (β-CD).106 For example, a carbon nanofiber membrane loaded with Fe3O4 nanoparticles was prepared by Si et al. through the combination of electrospinning and polybenzoxazine precursors involved in in situ polymerization. Their nanofibers exhibited a specific surface area of 1885 m2 g−1 and porosity of 2.325 cm3 g−1 respectively. These nanofibers showed effective removal of organic dyes from water.320 Another group developed polyethersulfone– polyethylenimine abbreviated as PES/PEI nanofiber membranes consisting of a large number of amino and imino functional groups for the removal of Sunset Yellow FCF, Fast Green FCF, and Amaranth dye molecules from water.321 Wang et al. electrospun 4 types of sodium alginate nanofibers for adsorptive removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. One of these fibers was fabricated without crosslinking, and the remaining 3 nanofibers were fabricated by using CaCl2, glutaraldehyde and tri-fluoroacetic acid (TFA) as cross linkers. The SA nanofibers without crosslinking and with CaCl2 cross-linking exhibited almost equal surface area, 14 and 13.6 m2 g−1, respectively. The nanofibers cross-linked with TFA exhibited a surface area of 15.2656 m2 g−1. Meanwhile the surface area was reduced to 11.9 m2 g−1 for glutaraldehyde cross-linked nanofibers. They found that the highest MB dye adsorption (2230 mg g−1) for the SA nanofibers cross-linked with CaCl2, which was the greatest adsorption capacity reported compared to previously reported nanofiber-based adsorbents.322 In another study, Zhao et al. developed nanofibers of beta cyclodextrin (β-CD) for the adsorptive removal of MB, by using a solution mixture containing b-CD, PAA polymer and citric acid in an appropriate quantity by electrospinning followed crosslinking via heat treatment. The presence of both b-CD and –COOH groups enabled efficient MB adsorption of 826 mg g−1, which was much higher than those of other previously reported b-CD adsorbents.323 Atassi et al. fabricated PLLA nanofibers with a surface modified with polyaniline doped with p-toluenesulfonic acid coating for the adsorptive removal of methyl orange (MO) from aqueous solution. Their nanofibers exhibited a surface area of 8.3 m2 g−1. Under experimental conditions like room temperature (25 °C), pH value of 6, dye content of 550 ppm, and adsorption time of one day, the nanofibers showed an adsorption of 377 mg g−1, which was equal to the adsorption capacity of the best adsorbents.324 Jang et al. fabricated nanofibers incorporated with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (cGO) via electrospinning to remove MB and methyl red (MR) dyes from aqueous medium. They varied the GO content in the nanofibers up to 30 wt% to increase the adsorption efficiency to a maximum level. The oxygenated functional groups present in GO imparted better efficiency for dye removal, via interactions like electrostatic, H- bonding, and π–π interactions. As an advantage, the nanofibers as hosts for functional materials not only help to overcome the cluster formation or aggregation but also greatly improve the surface area for a large amount of dye adsorption.325


4.2.4. Electrospun nanofibers for oil–water separation. 
Oil and other organic compounds are the most common contaminants of industrial wastewater leading to environmental pollution and great loss of energy.326 Furthermore, the rapid industrialization and skyrocketing demand for petroleum-based products have resulted in increased transportation and exploitation of crude oil.326 This has led to frequent and alarming oil spillage accidents wherein the industrial waste and leaked oils are usually released into water bodies which are significantly threatening to both human and aquatic life.326 These primary contributors towards the soaring worldwide oil pollution mainly consist of petroleum-based hydrocarbons and toxic compounds.326 Therefore, efficient separation of oil and water using a facile and commercially viable technique is necessary for both water remediation purposes and for other sustainably practical applications. Owing to viscosity differences, special care needs to be taken for effective oil–water separation which has specifically interested researchers for developing and fabricating cost effective, eco-friendly, reusable and special wettable materials. The two major challenges for efficient separation is the difficulty in simultaneously increasing the permeation flux along with the separation efficiency and improvement in the membrane design so as to maintain high anti-fouling property.326 In this regard, traditional techniques such as ultrasonic separation,327,328 centrifugation,329 skimming, gravity separation,330 electric field,331 coagulation–flocculation,332 biological treatment,333 and air flotation are all well-known but quite complicated methods. The complications exist because these separation techniques involve approaches including physical, chemical or biological changes leading to the generation of secondary pollutants, phase separation with low efficiency, poor retention and recyclability.334
Super-hydrophobic and super-hydrophilic materials have been fabricated using various methods. This includes techniques namely chemical vapor deposition, colloidal assembly, hydrothermal synthesis, chemical etching and plasma treatment. However, many of these techniques are not suitable for practical applications because of retarded stability, low selectivity and exquisite energy demands. Therefore, electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been used potentially to produce pure water from wastewater through low energy filtration techniques. Electrospun nanofibrous membranes are emerging as suitable filtration materials because they possess the ability to control the porosity of the nanofibrous membranes by effectively manipulating the surface as well as tailoring their chemical properties. These materials have also been reported to reduce the common problems in filtration techniques such as membrane fouling, formation of secondary pollutants and cost-processing. In most cases, a layer of oil usually stays afloat on the water surface, wherein due to the continuous flow of water the oil layer keeps spreading over a larger area and hence oil and water mixtures are needed to be separated very quickly which involves the use of super-hydrophilic, super-hydrophobic polymeric and inorganic materials with large porosity and surface area. In addition, safety disposal of these materials without causing any adverse effect on the environment is a highly challenging mission. Therefore, there is still a great demand for novel materials with high stability and performance. In most cases, polystyrene (PS), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) are the common polymers for oil–water separation membranes and other applications. In a pioneering work, Obaid et al. prepared electrospun nanofiber mats of polysulfone (PSF 15–20 wt%) by loading different amounts of NaOH (1.5–2.5 wt%) nanoparticles into the PSF solution and as a result a thin layer of the polyamide polymer formed on the surface of the PSF mats using MPD and TMC.193 It was observed that the NaOH loading and polyamide thin layer significantly decreased the contact angle from ∼130° to 13° for water, making the PSF mats suitable for complete removal of oil from water as shown in Fig. 23.193

In another report, oil and water were separated by employing a low pressure technique by Tang et al. wherein they fabricated a membrane with excellent separation efficiency as well as water repellant capacities using electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds of poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) as an oleophobic barrier and fluorinated polybenzoxazine (F-PBZ) incorporated with SiO2 nanoparticles as an oleophilic layer.199 The addition of SiO2 nanoparticle F-PBZ membranes helped in creating nanoscale rough structures on the surface of the resultant nanofibers. Fig. 24 shows a representative picture of the preparation process involved in the development of nanofibers along with their illustrative FE-SEM images and hydrophobic nature. The increase in surface roughness along with the high surface area obtained from the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles to F-PBZ nanofibers helped in increasing the hydrophobicity of the membranes by decreasing the water contact area.199

In another report, Ahmed et al. prepared PVDF-co-hexafluoro-propylene (HFP) mats by the electrospinning technique. Additionally, scaffolds were modified with cellulose to obtain a membrane for water removal application.335 The cellulose used for the modification was regenerated from ionic liquid solution. The structure of the nanofibrous membrane was porous in nature with a uniform pore size distribution. The addition of cellulose to the membrane resulted in a decrease in the porosity as the cellulose was deposited within the pores of the membrane as represented in Fig. 25. The cellulose modified PVDF-HFP nanofiber membranes were able to separate 99.98% water from oil as the membranes were superhydrophilic in nature.335 The separation of the mixtures of oil–water emulsions, specifically for emulsions stabilized with a droplet size of less than 20 mm, proved to be a challenging task. In an effort to address this issue, Ding and co-workers developed super wetting hierarchical electrospun nanofiber membranes which could efficiently separate water-in-oil197 and oil-in-water336 emulsions as shown Fig. 26. Specifically, a hierarchical porous silica-based electrospun nanofiber membrane with thermal stability, flexibility, super-hydrophilicity and underwater super-oleophobicity was prepared. This membrane system was developed by in situ polymerization of a polybenzoxazine functional layer containing SiO2 nanoparticles. Interestingly, this membrane displayed effective oil-in-water separation with an exceptionally high flux of 2237 m−2 h (as shown in Fig. 27) just in the presence of gravity.336

However, in oily wastewater treatments used in representative industries, the sizes of dispersed droplets in the oil/water emulsions are usually smaller, some of which are in the nano-scale range. In this regard, Jiang et al. prepared composite mats of PS/PVDF/iron oxide with selective incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles by two-nozzle electrospinning for oil-in-water separation.337 The results indicated in Fig. 28 supported by characterization evidence confirm that addition of PVDF had a positive impact on the mechanical properties of the PS mats. An easy recovery of the PS mats after the separation process was also possible due to the loading of magnetic Fe3O4. Furthermore, Luo et al. reported a high performance membrane for oil–water separation using gravity. This group developed smart fibers using a pH sensitive copolymer namely poly(methyl methacrylate)-block-poly (4-vinylpyridine) (PMMA-b-P4VP). The membrane showed permeability only towards oil, wherein submerging the membrane in an aqueous acidic medium of pH = 3 changed the permeability from oil to water. In conclusion, all the membranes prepared by the electrospinning technique could also help in effective separation of “oil in water” as well as “water in oil emulsions”.337

Electrospun nanofibers: advantages, challenges and future prospects. 
Electrospun nanofiber membranes have demonstrated great potential for water processing techniques due to their several advantageous properties such as a high specific surface area, high aspect ratio, controllable thickness, high interconnected porosity and wettability. The highly porous structure (70–90%) and low tortuosity can increase the permeability of the membranes under low hydraulic pressure conditions, while the high surface area allows membranes to be functionalized with ease.338 Moreover, the use of electrospun membranes in pressure retarded osmosis can efficiently generate energy driven by a salinity gradient from waste seawater brine. In most membrane processes, except membrane distillation, electrospun nanofibers act as supporting layers and polyamide active layers are formed on top.285 Thus, electrospun filtration membranes have shown tremendous potential in terms of permeability, rejection, resistance to fouling, reusability and energy efficiency. However, limited control of the pore structure is a significant disadvantage of the electrospinning technique as the pore diameter is dependent on the diameter of the electrospun nanofiber membrane.339 Further, electrospun nanofiber membranes possess limited mechanical stability compared to conventional flat-sheet, hollow fiber, thin film composite, track-etched membranes, which limits their application in high pressure driven filtration systems such as seawater reverse osmosis and industrial effluent treatment. Table 2 shows a comparison of performances of electrospun and conventional membranes used for water remediation processes.

Significant progress has been made over the last decade in the development of more robust electrospun nanofiber membranes for various remediation processes. However, in spite of the progress, they are yet to make a breakthrough in separation applications, particularly in pressure-driven liquid separations such as micro-(MF), ultra-(UF), or nano-(NF) filtration and thermally-driven membrane distillation techniques. Electrospun nanofibers are challenging to work with because they tend to acquire electrostatic charges throughout the electrospinning process. This accumulation of charges intensifies as the thickness of the electrospun mesh increases. Furthermore, surface chemistry and low mechanical strength are ongoing issues that must be addressed. Because of the rough surface of the nanofiber and the difference in material characteristics, there is a risk of delamination of the active layer when electrospun nanofibers are utilised as a support layer. Despite all the progress, membrane wettability caused by the large and broad pores of nanofiber composite membranes is still one of the main challenges which need to be addressed especially over long-term operations. Although many firms offer lab-scale electrospinning setups that can create sample sizes ranging from A4 paper size to even larger than 1 m2, the main problem that nanofiber membranes still confronts is undoubtedly their mass production capacity. Furthermore, more research is needed to highlight the role of post-treatment technologies in minimising membrane fouling and their applicability in the treatment of genuine wastewater, particularly for industry effluents. Membrane modification approaches such as coating, heat-press treatment, and annealing have been shown to increase membrane performance in oil wastewater treatment and may fill a research gap in real-world wastewater treatment investigations.
As described in this review, electrospun nanofibers have shown excellent results for different types of water treatment technologies. This section focusses on overall requirements that can be optimized further and different futuristic approaches of electrospun nanofibers for water remediation processes along with potential applications in the other two most important sectors namely energy and healthcare. A representation of the broad applications in these three sectors is shown in Fig. 29. In general, to enhance the performance of electrospun nanofibers, the electrospinning process and choice of polymeric materials (availability, cost, chain length) should be optimized continuously and studied in-depth, because polymer properties directly influence the roughness of the surface, hydrophilic behaviour and their closeness to the selective layer. Furthermore, physically or chemically induced post-modification techniques should be developed for surface modification of electrospun fibers to respond to different water remediation processes.
 Fig. 29  Overview on broad applications of electrospun nanofibers in the environment, energy and healthcare. 
Among the various environmental concerns, the availability of purifying water through various remediation processes is a basic human necessity. In this category, the biggest bottleneck for the membrane filtration technology is its large-scale production, which should be enumerated as the main design objective in future. Moreover, diversification of electrospun nanofibers for thermally driven desalination techniques such as membrane distillation and pressure driven desalination techniques such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration is also an essential factor.340,341 Therefore, focus should be shifted from conventional hydrophobic polymers such as PVDF and PTFE to polymers such as PET by distinction in their conductivity. Furthermore, electrospun nanofibrous membranes can be designed into various architectural configurations such as core–shell and hollow composites61,342 or curled,343 which show unique characteristics under specified conditions and might provide unexpected results for membrane distillation technology.93 For instance, membranes with a hollow structure with lower conductivity and higher thermal efficiency might allow greater water permeability without affecting pollutant selectivity.61 Further, the pertinent problem of anchoring different nanomaterials on the hydrophobic electrospun membrane matrix should be mitigated by enhancing the interaction between them. For example, CNTs have shown qualitative potential for novel membrane distillation approaches.344 However, the major issue that needs to be addressed is their rapid heat transfer which may induce the heat loss and decrease the membrane distillation performance. Pristine electrospun membranes, due to their large pore size, are constrained by their tendency to get wet.93 Enhancing the hydrophobicity of electrospun-based membranes for distillation processes to compensate for their excessive wettability through functionalization is critical for their effectiveness. However, most functionalization methods are non-covalent in nature and modification of nanofibers with covalent functionalization without compromising the membrane permeations, anti-fouling behaviour and wetting capabilities must be designed to realize this goal. Also most microfiltration membranes are prepared by using commodity polymer-based membranes. Nevertheless, such membranes are non-degradable and extremely hazardous to the environment.265,266 Therefore, to avoid the environmental impact of commodity plastics, development of innovative and environment friendly polymers which are derived from natural resources should be highly favoured.
Furthermore, electrospun nanofibrous membranes are ideal participants in the adsorption process and are advantageous for adsorption and removal of heavy metal ions and dyes from water sources as shown in Fig. 29 by blending different functional polymeric solutions, modifying the surface with surface functional molecules and introducing inorganic materials for the electrospinning process.345 However, further development of high-quality membranes in the field of electrospinning technology is still required for their mass production because present lab-scale preparatory techniques are time-consuming and provide low yields.346 Additionally, there are very few reports which focus on the mass-production of composite electrospun nanofibrous membranes. Also, introduction of inorganic constituents into the polymeric blend solutions results in instability during the spinning process which can be aimed as a necessary future approach in this field. Specifically, the poor stability of organic/inorganic composite electrospun nanofibrous membranes might carry the risk of inorganic material leakage, resulting in secondary pollution. Hence, studies focussing on increasing the mechanical stability to reinforce robustness are needed. In the field of heavy metal adsorption and removal of dyes by electrospun membranes, most studies focus on static and single-component adsorption. Nevertheless, for practical applications selective and dynamic adsorption approaches for removal of multiple heavy metals are also recommended.345 Additionally, the selective adsorption of specific heavy metals and dyes from a co-existent system with multiple heavy metal ions and studies on the cooperative synergistic effects of adsorption and reduction for achieving recovery can be a trending aspect in the future. Also, more studies should be undertaken to address the regeneration and reusability of these membranes, especially by using actual wastewater under industrial operating parameters. Apart from these environmental (water remediation) processes, electrospun nanofibers are also actively used for applications in the energy sector.
Electrospun nanofiber materials are providing new solutions in the fields of batteries, solar cells, fuel cells and supercapacitors as displayed in Fig. 29, and can be used to generate, convert, and store energy.26 Electrospinning of conducting polymers such as polyacrylonitrile, polyaniline and polyacetylene solutions in blends with various polymers, as well as composites with a variety of inorganic precursors, has been successfully employed to produce nanofibers. These nanofibers can further be modified, immobilized, activated, carbonised, and graphitized at higher temperatures to produce conductive electrode materials with high porosity, surface area, and increased conductivity, making them suitable for different energy applications. Electrospun nanofibers have been widely used for the past two decades in the form of mats, webs, films, electrodes, diffusion layers and separators. However, fresh advances in terms of power density, durability, conversion and harvest efficiency are now required to increase their performance. Based on the requirements, electrospinning can further be used to combine several active components into a single nanofiber and fabricate 1D electrospun nanofiber-based composites by changing the choice of polymeric blend solution and doping them with nanoparticles or components of choice. This modification can endow the resulting electrodes with hierarchical structures and high conductivity along with shortened diffusion pathways between the electrolyte and electrons. Moreover, the electrospinning approach allows the fabrication of binder-free devices as well as flexible and wearable smart materials that can be useful for a variety of future energy conversion and/or storage applications.
Flexible energy devices can help in storage or conversion of energy when subjected to stretching, folding or/and bending without a significant decrease in performance and hence wearable electronics are currently a highly demanding subject of research.347,348 Also, electrospun fiber-based wearable electronics are highly desirable as they are flexible, soft, comfortable to wear and light to handle.348 Conductive polymer-based electrospun nanofibers with polymers such as polyacrylonitrile and polyaniline which can be employed for wiring within a fabric to carry electricity to various components have the potential to be utilized for the development of wearable smart materials due to their high mechanical strength, structural stability, convenient handling.347,348 Moreover, piezoelectric nanomaterials show excellent piezoelectric characteristics and can provide excellent integration options in polymer composites and composite fibers.348 Conventional electronic sensors can be substituted with electrospun-based polymeric sensors as they can be adapted to any shape and size.347,348 The conventional electrospinning process can further be modified for proper alignment and positional controllability as well as the feasibility to embed nanoparticles into the electrospun nanofibers. Therefore, electrospun nanofibers can be engineered by incorporating active agents to achieve low amounts of strain and consequently obtain fatigue resistance over a large number of deformation cycles. Additionally, efforts with electrospun nanofibers need to be made to make the wearable electronic devices durable and increase their mechanical integrity and electrical connectivity. Very interestingly, with slight changes in the electrospinning technique, the electrospun nanofibers can be used in other sectors such as health with focus on medicinal applications.
Amongst biomedical applications, wound healing research is currently being treated with a wide range of dressings that are tailored to the necessities of the wound (Fig. 29).349 However, most chronic wounds necessitate precise moisture control, prevention of biofilm formation and bacterial load reduction while minimizing the risk of infection and wound recurrence, which is currently unavailable to patients. In comparison to conventional polymeric materials fabricated using techniques such as self-assembly or phase separation, polymeric electrospun scaffolds in the form of 2D non-woven meshes are seen to endorse proliferation and cell migration and offer a simple and economically viable way to produce high surface-area fibrous meshes with an interconnected porous structure and fiber diameters tailorable in the sub-micron to a few nanometer range.350,351 The future of wound dressing, according to Dargaville and coworkers, could include a pH readout, color map of the wound, and an indicator indicating whether a dressing change is required.352 The development of an electrospun mesh capable of attracting bacteria and trapping them within its fibrous structure could be one strategy for preventing biofilm formation in the wound bed.353 A smart wound dressing could be created by combining electrospun systems with sensors for triggered drug release, allowing it to reduce bacterial load in the wound bed, spot low levels of bacterial contamination and stimulate healthy tissue growth.352,353 At the same time, the sensor should give information on various parameters related to the wound's condition, such as pH, temperature and moisture. Apart from combination of electrospun meshes with sensors, incorporation of drugs, silver nanoparticles, and plant-derived compounds, such as essential oils and honey, into the electrospun meshes, which have antimicrobial and drug delivery properties, is also an attractive futuristic approach which can be achieved by improvement of electrospinning techniques.354
According to a recent 10 year literature survey, only 0.7 percent of injected chemotherapeutic drug agents reach solid cancerous tumours upon systemic administration.355 In this regard, electrospun nanofibers owing to their large surface area, surface modification capabilities, porous structure and biocompatibility properties are excellent materials for drug delivery platforms.350 In addition, electrospun nanofibers are also superior in terms of being biodegradable when compared to silicon-based drug delivery systems. Polymeric electrospun drug delivery systems represent a promising prerequisite as future generation systems that could include combinatorial biosensing feedback along with in vivo release of cytotoxic treatment, as they can release the therapeutic agents in a sustained and controllable manner as the biochemical properties of encapsulation systems are tailored to the release profile required for a specific target tissue.356 Furthermore, to prevent biofouling, biomimetic coatings can be done through electrospinning which increases the lifetime of biosensors.356 However, several problems remain before electrospun nanofiber-based drug delivery systems shift to clinical trials.357 Economic and regulatory constraints are more than likely to contribute towards the current lack of electrospun nanofiber-based drug delivery systems.357 In addition, in the arena of drug delivery, it is critical to especially find ways to fabricate nanofibers on a large scale with desired morphological, physicochemical and mechanical properties in a repeatable manner. In spite of the tireless efforts of the academic and industrial scientific community, most of the studies with regard to electrospun fibers for drug delivery research are conducted in vitro and therefore advancement in the field of drug delivery using electrospun nanofibers will necessitate more in vivo testing. Improvements in biological understanding of diseased states and how they interact with administered electrospun nanofiber-based drug delivery systems, as well as improvements in materials engineering, will serve to expand their commonplace application.
Various natural biopolymers such as collagen, chitosan, and silk fibroin as well as synthetic biopolymers such as polycaprolactone and polylactic acid, as biocompatible and biodegradable matrices have been used for preparation of nanofibrous mats with large surface areas and pores for tissue engineering and regeneration applications.358,359 The major issue of poor infiltration of cells seeded onto nanofibrous mats can be controlled by enlarging the pore size of nanofibrous mats as well as successful spinning of live cells in the core by coaxial electrospinning.359 Further, electrospinning of highly branched polymers such as chitosan and pectin should be improved by blending with other polymers or improving the spinning techniques to minimize charge repulsion. Through theoretical modelling research, it is possible to build a tissue-engineered construct that can serve as a potential material for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine by manipulating the morphological features and architecture of nanofibrous mats of diverse biocompatible polymers. Furthermore, coculturing various cells in these designed nanofibrous mats will aid in tissue building. In order to meet current and future drug delivery demands, scientists in this field must find new ways to use nanofibers for gene therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and regenerative medicine. It will eventually be possible to predict the behaviour of polymers during electrospinning and gain control over the final properties of the electrospun nanofibers, especially with novel synthetic analogues, solution behaviour with respect to polymeric concentration, conductivity and viscosity which can be determined experimentally and confirmed using theoretical tools.

Conclusions
Energy and water remain the basic needs in present times. Hence, the use of sustainable and low-cost techniques is required to meet the demands for availability of potable water sources for the present and future generations. With this background, membrane technology as an energy efficient technique plays a pivotal role in meeting the demand for potable water as it helps in purification of water resources. Membranes can remove macro and micro pollutants from the water, and render the water safe for consumption and for commercial uses. The major challenge for commercialization of membrane technology is that it should provide high flux with a high rejection rate wherein the membranes must be thermally, mechanically, temporally and elastically stable. Additionally, these membranes must be prepared by low-cost techniques, could be synthesized in a large scale and show high anti-fouling properties.
The present review provides an insight into the utilization of nanofibers synthesized by the electrospinning technique with focus on the morphology, porosity and also the membrane properties for water purification. The electrospinning technique can be used for the synthesis of nanofibers. Nanofibers possess properties such as high porosity, flexibility, and stability with excellent physico-chemical properties. Further, nanofibers also have a high surface to mass ratio. Based on variable properties of nanofibers, they can be used in the membrane technology efficiently. Various parameters affect the synthesis of nanofibers by the electrospinning technique. Different spinnerets namely, single needle, multi needle and other types of multi needle, have an impact on the porosity of the nanofibers synthesized. Additionally, the types of collectors used can also influence the morphology of the nanofibers synthesized by the electrospinning technique. Subsequently, polymer solution parameters like concentration, viscosity, and molecular weight of polymers control the morphology of the nanofibers formed. Nanofiber diameter is varied based on the difference in the polymer solution conductivity and flow rate along with the applied potential. Therefore, in brief it can be said that the experimental variables and parameter–property interrelationship were taken into consideration. Further the review also focused on the cumulative effect of electrospun nanofibers as membranes along with various additives like doping of various metal oxides and use of different polymers in the synthesis of nanofibers. The nanofiber membranes have been used for membrane distillation depending upon the suitable pore sizes of the nanofiber membranes. The utilization of electrospun nanofibers as membrane materials for microfiltration is also presented in this review. Further, the nanofiber membranes showed better activity for desalination processes (reverse osmosis, forward osmosis and nanofiltration) wherein the pore channels and structures also helped in obtaining a high flux rate. The nanofiber membranes could efficiently help in removal of heavy metal ions like As(III), As(V), Cr(VI), Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cu ions to name a few. These membranes have effectively been used for oil–water separation. Further, more research needs to be focused upon modification of these membranes and for the commercialization of these membranes which may provide purified water that can be suitable for human consumption.

High permeability and rejection	Comparably low flux
High specific surface area	Low surface area
Highly porous and are interconnected	Low porosity, mostly dense layer
Energy efficient process	Require high energy input
Limited to low pressure operation (<15 bar pressure)	Can be used in high pressure operations involved water purification
Limited to low temperature operations due to potential delamination of top active layer	Long term and high thermal stability
Difficult to regenerate the surface of the membrane	Surface can be regenerated by simple back washing
