    , Accepted 13th February 2018First published on 15th February 2018AbstractThe intrinsic stability issues of organo-metal halide perovskite materials induced by moisture, heat, light and the presence of an electric field constitute big obstacles that are preventing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from industrial application. Herein, we have demonstrated that when a hydrophobic organic acid molecule, 4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid, is introduced to modify the top surface of a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, it is a facile way to simultaneously enhance the stability and efficiency of the corresponding PSCs. This surface modification can not only improve the perovskite film’s electronic quality but also provide it with a certain waterproofing capability. Accordingly, the efficiency of the inverted PSC is improved from 17.43% to 19.87%. More encouragingly, after 1 sun light soaking, 85 °C thermal aging, and high humidity (70%) aging for 1000 hours, the modified CH3NH3PbI3 based PSCs can retain 91%, 81% and 98% efficiency, respectively.
Introduction
The newly emerging photovoltaic technology, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using organo-metal halide perovskites (AMX3, A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+) or H2NCHNH2+ (FA+); M = Sn2+, Pb2+, Ge2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) as light absorbers, has attracted widespread attention owing to their high efficiency, low cost and ease of manufacture. Beginning with 3.8% in 2009,1 the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased to 22.7%.2 The fast PCE evolution of PSCs is unprecedented in the long development history of photovoltaics, which should be largely attributed to the excellent photoelectric properties of the solution processed perovskite films, such as the high optical absorption coefficient, small exciton binding energy, and long charge carrier diffusion lengths.3–6 However, it has been widely recognized that the low-temperature (typically in the range 80–150 °C) deposited perovskite films normally lack chemical and structural stability, which means they will rapidly degrade under the stresses caused by moisture, heat, light and the presence of an electric field.7 For example, MAPbI3 has been proven to be intrinsically unstable at 85 °C in ambient or N2 atmosphere.8 Meanwhile, an alternative light harvester, FAPbI3, which possesses a broader absorption spectrum to enable a high PCE of over 20%,9 has been proven to lack structural stability.10
Through composition engineering, long-chain amines, such as 5-aminolamidic acid,11 polyetherimide,12 CF3CH2NH3+,13 C6H5(CH2)2NH3+,14 and C4H9NH3+,15 have been introduced to partially replace short-chain MA+/FA+ cations, converting the conventional perovskites with three-dimensional crystal structures to lower dimensional ones, which could remarkably enhance their moisture stability. However, unfortunately, such stability enhancement was normally achieved by sacrificing the efficiency of the corresponding PSCs, which was due to the degraded photoelectric properties of the low-dimensional perovskite films.16 To date, incorporation of inorganic Cs+ (ref. 17) and/or Rb+ cations18 into MA+/FA+ based mixed perovskites, has been reported to give improved structural or thermal stability without sacrificing much efficiency.
Beyond tuning the bulk perovskite films’ compositions, it is known that appropriate surface modification can also largely improve the film’s and the corresponding device’s stability. Various kinds of surface modification layers have been implemented in PSCs, such as polystyrene,19 phenylalkylamine,20 amino-functionalized graphene,21 quaternary ammonium halide22etc. Typically, these surface modification strategies can just change the surface properties of the films without largely tuning the bulk film’s photoelectric properties. Therefore, the improved stability can be achieved without sacrificing efficiency. In some cases, appropriate surface modification can even passivate the surface traps of the perovskite films and/or help to block the interfacial shunt-paths, which can facilitate interfacial charge transfer and prevent interfacial recombination, and hence improve the device’s efficiency.23
With the dual aims of simultaneously enhancing efficiency and stability in mind, we introduced a hydrophobic organic acid molecule, 4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (4-DMABA), to modify the top surface of the MAPbI3 film. Indeed, this surface modification has killed two birds with one stone. Not only has the efficiency been improved due to the passivation of the surface traps, but the stability of the perovskite film and the corresponding device has also been reasonably enhanced. In order to explain the stability improvement, we introduced in situ characterization of the perovskite films based on photoconductive atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM),24 which can continuously monitor the morphology and photoconductivity changes along with the aging time by keeping the films under controlled light and humidity.
Results and discussion
Spin coating 4-DMABA molecules on the perovskite film can protect it from being damaged by environmental factors. The schematic diagram shown in Fig. 1a illustrates the interaction mode of 4-DMABA molecules with perovskite. 4-DMABA is chosen because of its molecular structure (Fig. S1, ESI†). It is thought that the carboxyl group of 4-DMABA can strongly coordinate with the positively charged ions (Pb2+ sites) on the film surface, providing a possible passivation effect on the surface traps.25 Meanwhile, the hydrophobic dimethylamino group can provide the modified film with a certain waterproofing capability.

Inset is a high magnification image. 
To confirm the formation of coordination bonds between 4-DMABA and the perovskite film, we conducted Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy measurement of the powder samples of 4-DMABA, MAPbI3, and a 4-DMABA/MAPbI3 mixture. The powder samples were prepared by scraping the pristine and surface modified MAPbI3 films from the FTO glass substrates. The results are shown in Fig. 1b. For the 4-DMABA sample, the symmetric stretching vibrations of CO (ν(CO)) were located at 1666 cm−1. The characteristic peak is also present in the 4-DMABA/MAPbI3 mixture sample, but the peak position shifts to a smaller wavenumber of 1618 cm−1. This shift, as suggested by the literature,26 should be ascribed to the coordination bonds formed by sharing the lone electron pair on the CO of 4-DMABA with the empty 6p orbital of Pb2+ in MAPbI3.
The SEM images shown in Fig. 1c and d reflect that after surface modification, the morphology of the top surface of the MAPbI3 film has largely changed. A thin layer composed of smaller particles with a grain size of about 10 nm is formed due to surface modification. The surface modification didn’t create any pin-holes in the modified film.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a simple but effective way to ascertain the surface passivation effect. Generally, radiative recombination between charge carriers through intra-bandgap trap states will lead to a red-shift of the PL emission peak in comparison to that from the band edge transition. Surface passivation could fill the trap states which would enable recovery of the bandgap and lead to a blue shift of the PL peak.27Fig. 1e shows the steady-state PL spectra for the perovskite films with and without surface modification by 4-DMABA. It can be observed that the PL intensity of the 4-DMABA modified MAPbI3 film is 43% higher than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film. The peak position is blue shifted from 771 nm for the pristine MAPbI3 film to 767 nm for the modified one. PL intensity enhancement and a blue shift in peak position collectively indicate that the electronic quality of the MAPbI3 film is enhanced due to surface modification.28 It is proposed that the deep trap states (the positively charged under-coordinated Pb2+) on the perovskite film surface have been removed due to 4-DMABA’s passivation. A similar blue shift in PL peak position is observed in the perovskite film covered by PCBM (Fig. 1e), of which the passivation effect on the traps has been discussed in previously reported literature.29 The PL intensity for the pristine and modified perovskite films after being covered by PCBM is largely decreased by 83% and 92%, indicating efficient charge transfer at the corresponding interfaces. This indicates that the surface modification does not hinder the charge transfer at the perovskite/PCBM interface.
In order to further clarify the electronic quality improvement and interfacial charge transfer properties, we resorted to using time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy measurement. The carrier-recombination lifetime, measured by TRPL, is commonly taken as a hallmark of semiconductor film quality, with longer decay lifetimes being an indicator of better material quality.30 As shown in Fig. 1f, it can be seen that the fitted PL lifetimes for the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films are 102 ns and 166 ns, respectively. The longer carrier lifetime is likely due to the elimination of trap-mediated non-radiative recombination in the modified MAPbI3 film. For the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films after being covered by a thin layer of PCBM, the PL lifetimes decreased to 6.29 ns and 10 ns, respectively. The PL quenching is very efficient in both samples, corresponding to interfacial charge transfer efficiencies as high as 90.2% and 96.2% for the perovskite films before and after surface modification.31 This is consistent with the steady-state PL spectra.
Hydrophobicity is another target for surface modification. We tested the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films’ contact angles and show the results in Fig. 2a. The contact angle of the modified MAPbI3 film is calculated to be 65.1 ± 0.52°, which is larger than that of the pristine film with the value of 44.8 ± 0.61°. The increase in water contact angle indicates an improvement in the waterproofing capability of the modified perovskite film, which is expected to be beneficial for long-term stability of the device.

Indeed, the enhanced hydrophobicity has provided the modified film with much better stability in ambient air. This was easily confirmed when we kept the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films in ambient air with a humidity of 40–90% near a window (for exposure to incident sunlight) for either 10 or 20 days. It was found that the decomposition speeds of these films were very different. The optical photo shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) clearly shows that after aging for 10 days, the original dark brown color of the pristine MAPbI3 film turned mostly yellow, indicating its decomposition to PbI2. In contrast, no color change was observed for the modified MAPbI3 film, even after aging for 20 days. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Fig. 2b further confirm the serious decomposition of the pristine MAPbI3 film after aging, which is indicated by an evident peak at 12.6° owing to PbI2. Meanwhile, the XRD patterns of the modified MAPbI3 films before and after aging do not change, proving that it has much better stability than pristine MAPbI3.
Introducing in situ techniques to monitor the morphological, structural and electrical changes of perovskite films under real working conditions is of vital importance to clarify the degradation mechanisms. To date, in situ XPS,32 TEM,33 XRD,34 GI-WAXS35 and PL spectroscopy36 measurements have been employed to study the stability of PSCs. Herein, we employed a pc-AFM technique,24 to in situ monitor the morphological and photocurrent changes of the perovskite films with time under controlled light and humidity. A white light LED lamp with a light intensity around 80 mW cm−2 illuminated the samples through an optical fiber. The relative humidity of the testing room was well controlled at ∼34% by two dehumidifiers. The p-type NiMgLiO coated FTO glass served as the anode, while the AFM probe served as the cathode. This configuration could be regarded as an electron transport layer-free PSC. For the pristine MAPbI3 film, Fig. 3a and b show the photocurrent and topography maps of the same 5 × 5 μm2 region during aging. It is found that the average photocurrent decreases quickly from an initial value of 231.841 pA to 22.388 pA after 3 hours (Fig. S3, ESI†), which indicates the severe degradation of the pristine MAPbI3 film. Consistently, the film morphology becomes much more blurry and the grain boundaries gradually melt together with increasing aging time. For the modified MAPbI3 film, Fig. 3c and d show its photocurrent and topography maps under the same aging conditions for 6 hours. It is clear that the average photocurrent almost maintains its initial value after 3 hours of aging; and even after aging for 6 hours, the average photocurrent of the modified MAPbI3 film (141.651 pA) is still much higher than that of the pristine one after aging for 3 hours (22.388 pA). Consistently, the morphology change for the modified MAPbI3 film is also much smaller and slower, indicating its retarded decomposition in comparison to the pristine MAPbI3 film. Moreover, the distinct difference in decomposition speed between the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films can also be identified by looking at their optical images which are shown in Fig. 3e. The color of the pristine MAPbI3 film turned to yellow after 3 hours of light-soaking, indicating its decomposition from perovskite to PbI2, while the color of the modified MAPbI3 film after 6 hours of aging was nearly unchanged. Interestingly, after we left the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films in a dark drawer without humidity control for 1 month, and then tested the films using pc-AFM, we found that the average photocurrent of the pristine film had degraded to 12.671 pA while the modified film still held a value of 105.734 pA (Fig. 3f). This observation firstly confirms the dramatically higher stability of the modified film in comparison to the pristine one in ambient air; secondly, it also reflects that the perovskite film kept in the dark degraded much more slowly than the one that was kept in the light, since the duration for the tested sample in Fig. 3c was only 6 hours and for the sample in Fig. 3f it was as long as 1 month. Indeed, as confirmed by the in situ pc-AFM measurements, the decomposition of the bare perovskite films (with and without surface modification) is very fast (within hours) when they are directly exposed to moisture and light, but in real devices, their decomposition could be largely slowed down, as shown in the latter experiment. Perhaps, in a real device, the interfacial layers and electrode layer could prevent the perovskite layer from direct interaction with moisture. More importantly, the photoinduced carriers inside the perovskite layer in a real device could be sufficiently extracted to the out circuit without accumulation. And this is inherently different from the bare perovskite film, of which the accumulated charges on the perovskite surface may induce an intense chemical reaction, especially in the presence of moisture.37

Based on the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films, we constructed inverted PSCs with the configuration “FTO/NiMgLiO/MAPbI3/passivation layer/PCBM/BCP/Ag”, as shown in Fig. 4a. A compact layer of p-type NiMgLiO (20 nm) was used for hole selective collection.38 The MAPbI3 layer (∼450 nm), deposited using the anti-solvent method,39 was further modified using an isopropanol solution of 4-DMABA. The layer-by-layer stacking structure is clearly shown in the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 4a. From the cross-sectional SEM image, we know that the capping layer is very thin (<20 nm) and has not extended into the bulk film. It can also be seen that the large domains within the perovskite layer are perpendicular to the substrate, which can facilitate charge transfer and minimize the internal recombination.

(c) IPCE curves (solid lines) and the integrated photocurrents (dashed lines), (d) statistical PCE distributions, (e) dark J–V curves and (f) dependencies of VOC on light intensity for the two devices compared in (b). 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best inverted PSCs based on the pristine and modified MAPbI3 films are shown in Fig. 4b and their performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. Herein, the 4-DMABA concentration has been initially optimized to be 2.0 mg mL−1 with respect to the device performance (see Fig. S4† and Table 1). It should be noted that the maximum solubility of 4-DMABA in isopropanol is about 2.0 mg mL−1 at room temperature. It can be seen from Fig. 4b and Table 1 that, in comparison to the pristine MAPbI3 based PSC, the modified MAPbI3 based device is superior in all of the performance parameters and especially in open-circuit photovoltage (VOC, 1111 mV versus 1050 mV) and fill factor (FF, 0.80 versus 0.75). The improved FF is also consistent with a largely increased shunt resistance (3143.53 versus 797.21 Ω cm2) and a slightly decreased series resistance (3.97 versus 4.69 Ω cm2). The efficiency is accordingly improved from 17.43% to 19.87% due to the implementation of the 4-DMABA surface modification. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the two compared devices are shown in Fig. 4c. Integrating the IPCE yields the theoretical short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) values for the pristine (22.14 mA cm−2) and modified (22.45 mA cm−2) MAPbI3 based PSCs, which match well with the measured JSC values as listed in Table 1. Within the light absorption range of 380–750 nm, the tested IPCE values are in the range of 80–90%; if considering the optical loss due to FTO-glass absorption and reflection of about 10–15%, such high IPCEs suggest that the charge collection loss within the devices is quite small. In the longer wavelength region (600–750 nm), the modified MAPbI3 based device is even better than the pristine MAPbI3 based one, indicating its recombination loss is even smaller. Statistical PCE distributions of 100 devices based on the two kinds of perovskite film are shown in Fig. 4d, and demonstrate the reliability and the repeatability of the performance enhancement caused by the 4-DMABA surface modification. Over 85% of the devices based on the modified MAPbI3 films showed >17% PCEs and an average PCE of 18.74%, while the devices based on the pristine MAPbI3 films showed an average PCE of 17.17%.

The enhanced VOC of the modified MAPbI3 based PSCs can be attributed to the improved electronic quality of the perovskite film as mentioned above. Surface passivation can eliminate interfacial traps which will facilitate charge carrier transport and suppress interfacial recombination. To ascertain this, we investigated the dependence of VOC on light intensity for the corresponding devices. By linearly fitting VOCversus log-scaled light intensity, we got the slopes of 1.40kBT/q and 1.22kBT/q (where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is elementary charge) for the pristine and modified MAPbI3-based devices, respectively (Fig. 4f). In principle, less Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is expected when this slope is close to kBT/q.40 Hence, the modified MAPbI3-based PSC possesses a smaller slope (1.22kBT/q) than that of the pristine MAPbI3-based device (1.40kBT/q) throughout the entire light intensity range, indicating that there is less trap-assisted non-radiative recombination loss in the device operation, which eventually results in a higher VOC.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the effect of the suppressed recombination on the device performance, we compared the dark J–V curves of the two kinds of PSC, as shown in Fig. 4e. By fitting the equivalent circuit of a Shockley diode in a single-junction device, we could get J0 values for the pristine and modified MAPbI3 based PSCs of 3.48 × 10−10 A cm−2 and 1.8 × 10−10 A cm−2.41 The lower leakage density (J0) of the modified device indicates that it has better diode quality and a higher rectification ratio than the pristine one, which confirms that the charge carrier recombination is suppressed in the modified MAPbI3 based PSC.
Beyond the efficiency target, we desired to simultaneously resolve the even tougher stability issue of PSCs by employing 4-DMABA as a surface modifier. As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the surface modification gives the MAPbI3 film a certain waterproofing capability which can largely retard the film’s decomposition speed. It is interesting to investigate in a completed device, with the help of the interfacial layer’s encapsulation,42 whether the stability enhanced perovskite film could lead to a longer device lifetime approaching the stability test standards for commercialized solar cells.43Fig. 5a shows the normalized PCE degradation of the pristine and modified MAPbI3 based PSCs with and without encapsulation when they were kept in a humidity controlled (RH = 70%) chamber at 25 °C for 1000 hours, and taken out to calculate J–V curves periodically. The unencapsulated PSC based on the modified MAPbI3 retained over 61% of its initial PCE after 1000 hours of aging. In contrast, the unencapsulated device based on the pristine MAPbI3 degraded completely within 350 hours. After encapsulation by a cover glass with UV glue, the stability of both kinds of device were largely enhanced. However, it is clear that the modified MAPbI3 based device is even more stable, losing just 2% of its initial PCE after 1000 hours of aging, while the pristine MAPbI3 based device lost ∼15% of its initial PCE under the same aging conditions. Fig. 5b compares the thermal stability of the PSCs based on the two kinds of MAPbI3 film by keeping them in the dark at 85 °C for 1000 hours. Because the commonly used encapsulation material (the UV glue) cannot endure long-term aging at such a high temperature, we kept the unencapsulated devices in a N2 filled glove box to eliminate the influence of the atmosphere. It can be seen that the modified MAPbI3 based PSC can retain about 81% of its initial PCE after 85 °C thermal aging for 1000 hours, while in contrast, the pristine MAPbI3 based PSC lost 83% of its initial PCE. This enhanced thermal stability is among the best reported for pure MAPbI3 based PSCs.44 Though MAPbI3 is thermally unstable in comparison to subsequently developed FA+ or Cs+ based perovskite materials,45 our research demonstrated that its decomposition in a real device could be largely retarded after effective surface modification. Fig. 5c compares the light-soaking stability of the two kinds of PSC by keeping them under continuous light soaking (100 mW cm−2, provided by a white light LED array with UV light filter) and maximum power point tracking conditions at room temperature in a N2 filled glove box. It is found that the modified MAPbI3 based device could maintain over 91% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of aging, while the pristine MAPbI3 based PSC almost stopped working completely within only 750 hours. Here, we recognize that the improved stability under thermal and light soaking conditions for the modified MAPbI3 based devices has not been conclusively explained. According to the literature,46 it is thought that it might be ascribed to the surface modification induced capping layer, which could retard the migration of corrosive and volatile species from perovskite to contaminate the Ag electrode.
 Fig. 5  Normalized PCEs of the compared PSCs based on the pristine MAPbI3 films with (pink triangle) and without (red circle) encapsulation, and the modified MAPbI3 films with (blue triangle) and without (black square) encapsulation. The devices were aged for 1000 hours (a) in high humidity conditions (70% relative humidity), (b) at 85 °C in a N2 filled glove box and (c) under light soaking (100 mW cm−2, white light LED with UV light filter) and maximum power point tracking conditions in a N2 filled glove box. 
All the results shown above strongly suggest that the implementation of 4-DMABA surface modification can effectively protect perovskite films from decomposition and effectively improve the stability of PSCs at different accelerated aging conditions, which is important for their practical applications.
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a facile surface modification using a hydrophobic organic acid molecule (4-DMABA) to simultaneously realize high efficiency and stability of the inverted PSCs. The efficiency improvement from the original 17.43% to 19.87% is demonstrated, which could be ascribed to the passivation of the surface traps and the recombination suppression associated with the surface modification; while the stability improvement is demonstrated to be attributed to the hydrophobic surface capping layer with a certain waterproofing capability, and has been directly proven by in situ pc-AFM characterization along with aging time under controlled light and humidity. Encouragingly, after 1 sun light soaking, 85 °C thermal aging, and high humidity (70%) aging with/without encapsulation for 1000 hours, the modified MAPbI3 based PSCs retained 91%, 81% and 98%/61% of their initial efficiency, respectively. These data indicate that through the surface modification of perovskite, even the pure MAPbI3 based PSCs could be approaching the necessary limit for the standard stability test for commercialized solar cells. Furthermore, we believe this facile surface modification could be applied in an upgraded perovskite materials system, such as FA+/Cs+ based perovskites; by doing so, a more stable PSC could be expected, which may finally pass the accelerated aging tests.
Experimental section
Materials
All the chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purification.
Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (Pilkington TEC 15, 15 Ω per square) was etched using 0.1 M HCl solution diluted in Milli-Q water without Zn powder. The etched substrates were cleaned with 2% hellmanex diluted in the Milli-Q water, rinsed with Milli-Q water/ethanol, and then dried with clean air. A p-type NiMgLiO compact layer (∼20 nm thick) was then deposited on the FTO glass using spray pyrolysis according to our previous work.47 The anti-solvent method was used for the perovskite layer deposition: an 80 μL DMF/DMSO (4:1 by volume) solution of PbI2/MAI (1.05:1 by molar ratio, with a concentration of 1.5 M) was spin-coated at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm for 30 seconds, followed by rapid drop-casting of 200 μL diethyl ether as the anti-solvent within 10 seconds. The pristine MAPbI3 film was accordingly formed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. For the modified MAPbI3 film preparation, 80 μL isopropanol solution of 4-DMABA with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the pristine MAPbI3 film at a rotation speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s, and was then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. After the perovskite films were prepared, a chlorobenzene solution of PCBM (20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on top of them at a rotation speed of 1500 rpm for 30 seconds. Subsequently, the saturated methanol solution of BCP was spin-coated on top of the PCBM layer at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, one batch of the films was transferred to the evaporator chamber, and 100 nm thick Ag electrodes were deposited under high vacuum (<3 × 10−4 Pa).
Characterizations
SEM images were obtained using a Nova Nano 450 scanning electron microscope (FEI Co., Netherlands). XRD characterization was performed on an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical B.V. Co., Netherlands). The infrared spectra were obtained on a VERTEX 70 Infrared Fourier transform microscope (Bruker Co., Germany). The PL spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Co., UK). The local photocurrent measurement (pcAFM) was performed using a commercial AFM system (Asylum Research MFP-3D Bio) with Nanosensors PPP-EFM conductive probes, the spring constants of which are about 2.8 N m−1. A solar simulator (Oriel, model 9119) with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was precisely calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector. The active area of the solar cell was determined to be 0.09 cm2 using a black metal mask. IPCE was measured on a Newport IPCE system (Newport, USA). The long-term stability was measured with a CHI1000c multi-channel electrochemistry workstation (Chenhua Co., China).
