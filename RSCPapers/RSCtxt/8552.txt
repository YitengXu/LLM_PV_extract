    , Accepted 6th December 2014First published on 8th December 2014AbstractIn this work, we have developed a new efficient hole transport material (HTM) composite based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes (BCNs) for CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) based perovskite solar cells. Compared to pristine P3HT, it is found that the crystallinity of P3HT was significantly improved by addition of BCNs, which led to over one order of magnitude higher conductivity for the composite containing 1–2 wt% BCNs in P3HT. In the meantime, the interfacial charge transfer between the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer and the HTM composite layer based on P3HT/BCNs was two-fold faster than pristine P3HT. More importantly, the HTM film with a superior morphological structure consisting of closely compact large grains was achieved with the composite containing 1 wt% BCNs in P3HT. The study by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has confirmed that the electron recombination in the solar cells was reduced nearly ten-fold with the addition of 1 wt% carbon nanotubes in the HTM composite. Owing to the superior HTM film morphology and the significantly reduced charge recombination, the energy conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells increased from 3.6% for pristine P3HT to 8.3% for P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) with a significantly enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). The findings of this work are important for development of new HTM for high performance perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Solar cells based on an organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskite compound (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I, MAPbX3) have attracted significant attention because of their promise for cost-effective solar electricity compared to traditional crystalline silicon solar cells.1–6 Generally speaking, a perovskite solar cell (PSC) consists of three main components with (1) a n-type semiconductor such as TiO2 which serves as a scaffold for electron transport; (2) a MAPbX3 perovskite based light absorber material; and (3) a hole transport material (HTM) which is interfaced with the MAPbX3 material for charge separation and subsequent hole transport. The performance of a PSC depends on the light harvesting efficiency of the light absorber material, the charge separation efficiency at the interface of MAPbX3/HTM and the charge transport efficiency in both the HTM and MAPbX3 layer. Until now, the majority study in the area of PSCs has been focused on the MAPbX3 perovskite light absorber, attempting to understand its underlying properties and to improve its stability in PSC devices.7–11
Nevertheless, a HTM with efficient hole transport mobility is equally critical for high performance PSCs. Actually, the first MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) based solar cells produced a power conversion efficiency (η) of only 3.8% as reported by Kojima et al. in 2009.12 The breakthrough was made by Lee et al. by replacing the liquid electrolyte containing hole transport species with the solid state HTM based on 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-ethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), which boosted the efficiency to 10.9% in 2012.1
Besides Spiro-OMeTAD, other types of HTMs have been investigated for PSCs.13–15 Among them, a conjugated conductive polymer based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is another widely used HTM in PSCs because of its solubility in variable solvents, which enables deposition of the P3HT film using a cost-effective solution-processing technique such as spin coating for solar cell fabrication. However, the performance of pure P3HT based PSCs is generally low. The current best reported PSC efficiency with P3HT and MAPbI3 is 4.5%.16 According to Bi et al., the rather flat molecular structure of P3HT can cause more serious charge recombination processes and thus was responsible for the lower efficiency in PSCs compared to the well-known Spiro-OMeTAD based device.16 In addition, in comparison to traditional inorganic semiconductors, P3HT has lower hole mobility with conductivity normally of the order of 10−5 S cm−1 due to its poor crystalline nature.17 The low charge carrier mobility is detrimental to solar cells because it can cause high series resistance and significant recombination between electrons and holes in solar cells, thus reducing the performance of the device.
As a semi-crystalline material, the charge transport in P3HT is determined by the conductive domains which consist of ordered crystallites.18 Several approaches have been developed to improve the crystallinity and thus the hole transport mobility of P3HT. These include post-thermal annealing treatment or using various solvents as well as using additives such as carbon-based materials to improve the local crystalline order of P3HT.19 Geng et al. have reported that addition of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can improve the crystallinity of P3HT due to the nanotube-induced π–π stacking interaction. Such interaction results in local molecular orientation of P3HT in a nanoscale dimension along the wall of carbon nanotubes, which is beneficial to crystallization of the polymer from its solution as the solvent evaporates.20 The interaction between P3HT and SWNTs may even change the optical band gap of P3HT besides contributing to the carrier mobility.21 A similar phenomenon of improved crystallinity and modification of the band gap of P3HT has also been reported with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs).22 In addition, the theoretical study has also confirmed that P3HT could self-assemble around carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through its main chain, which would enhance the conjugation in the blend and maximize the interfaces between P3HT and MWNTs.23
Besides charge transport, charge transfer at the interface between MAPbX3 and HTM is also critical for the performance of solar cells. For high energy conversion efficiency, the photo-generated electron–hole pair needs to be separated efficiently to avoid recombination. Hence, the surface properties of the HTM layer are very important for efficient interfacial charge transfer in the device. However, little research is available on this key process so far.
In this work, a series of hole transport materials based on a composite of P3HT and bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes (BCNs) have been developed for PSCs. It is found that both the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the PSCs were significantly enhanced with the addition of BCNs in P3HT. The Voc of the PSC with the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) HTM composite was enhanced by 250 mV compared to the device without BCNs. In the meantime, the FF of the device was increased from 0.35 for pure P3HT to 0.52 for P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs). As a consequence, the performance of the PSCs was improved from 3.6% for pure P3HT to 8.3% for P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composites. This remarkable performance improvement of the solar cell is attributed to the reduced electron recombination at the interface of MAPbI3/HTM with the presence of BCNs and the superior morphological structure with reduced grain boundaries for hole transport in the HTM layer.
Experimental
Synthesis of methylammonium iodide
Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized according to the literature.12 Briefly, methylammonium iodide was formed through mixing methylamine (CH3NH2) solution (40 wt% in absolute ethanol) with hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water) under the nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The white methyl ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) crystals were collected by evaporation of the solution by a rotary evaporator.
Deposition of the TiO2 film on an FTO substrate
The perovskite solar cells were fabricated by the following procedure. First, laser-patterned, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates (TEC15, Pilkington) were cleaned under ultra-sonication in NaOH aqueous solution, deionized water, ethanol and acetone for 15 min in sequence. The substrates were then annealed at 510 °C for 15 min to remove any residual organic material. A TiO2 compact layer with thickness around 20–40 nm was then deposited on the substrates by aerosol spray pyrolysis at 500 °C using a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in isopropanol (0.2 M).24 After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were further treated in 0.05 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, then rinsed with deionized water and dried at 500 °C for 20 min.25 After this, a mesoporous TiO2 film consisting of 20 nm particles was deposited by spin coating a TiO2 colloid solution at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The solution was made by diluting a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NRT) in ethanol with a weight ratio of 2:7. The TiO2 film with thickness around 550 nm was sintered at 510 °C for 15 min before cooling to room temperature naturally.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The deposition of the TiO2/MAPbI3 film and TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM film was carried out in an argon-filled glovebox. The MAPbI3 film was deposited by spin-coating PbI2 based N,N-dimethylformamide solution (concentration: 462 mg mL−1) on the mesoporous TiO2 film followed by drying at 70 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 20 s and then rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min.
The solution for the hole transport material (HTM) was composed of P3HT (10 mg mL−1), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 0.2 M), bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (0.06 M) and different concentrations of bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes (BCNs) (0 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt% and 2 wt%) in the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent. The HTM solution was spin-coated on the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 films and dried at 120 °C for 30 min. Finally, a layer of gold (110 nm) was thermally evaporated on top of the HTM layer to form the back contact of perovskite solar cells.
For clarity, in the following sections, the composite containing different contents of BCNs is named as P3HT/(x wt% BCNs) where x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2. At least ten cells with each HTM composite were made to test the reproducibility of the result and to calculate the standard deviation of the average performance.
Characterization
The conductivity of the P3HT/BCN composite was determined by a Van der Pauw four point probe using a computer controlled source meter (KeithLink LRS4-T, Taiwan) at room temperature. The HTM film for the measurement was prepared by spin-coating the corresponding P3HT/solution on a clean glass substrate followed by drying in a glove box. The thickness of the film was determined by using a SEM and a profilometer.
The micro-Raman spectrum of the material was recorded using a Renishaw Raman spectrometer with a laser excitation wavelength of 530 nm at room temperature. The UV-visible spectrum of the material was recorded on a UV-vis spectrometer (Cary 50). The photoluminescence (PL) measurement was conducted with a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 920, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) at room temperature. The PL emission spectrum of the film samples with comparable thickness was recorded by exciting the samples with a light beam from a 450 W Xe lamp at 445 nm and a nanosecond flash laser beam at 377 nm, respectively. Time-resolved PL decay was measured at the wavelength for peak emission (740 nm for perovskite) using a nanosecond flash laser beam at 377 nm. The surface and cross-section morphologies of the P3HT/BCN films were imaged using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 7001F) at an acceleration voltage of 10.0 kV. The high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) measurement and selected area electron diffraction patterns of the HTM composite were performed with a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 keV. The small angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the material was recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D max-2500, Japan) equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu K radiation (k = 1.5418 Å). A scan rate of 8° min−1 in the 2θ range from 2° to 10° was used in the XRD measurement.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PSC was performed in the frequency range from 5 kHz to 1 Hz using an electrochemical workstation (VSP BioLogic Science Instruments) at a forward bias of −0.8 V in the dark. An AC voltage with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV was used in the EIS measurement. An equivalent circuit including a transmission line was used to fit the EIS results.26
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured by recording the current as a function of applied voltage under the radiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5) provided by a Xe lamp (150 W) based solar simulator (Newport). The cell was scanned from short circuit to open circuit. The illumination intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated with a monocrystalline reference silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer USA). The active area of each cell was 0.09 cm2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the HR-TEM image of the carbon nanotubes. As can be seen, the nanotubes are very long with length up to several micrometres. The diameter of the tubes is around 10 nm and both end-opened and end-closed tubes are observed in the material. Many knots/joints can be seen clearly inside the tubes, making the nanotubes adopt a bamboo-like structure. The Raman spectrum of the nanotubes (Fig. 1(b)) suggests that the bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (BCNs) contain both single wall and multiwall nanotubes. The two main peaks at 1346 cm−1 and 1581 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum belong to the characteristic D and G vibration of carbon nanotubes, respectively.27 The D band is related to the defect induced disorder property of the carbon nanotubes while the G band originates from the splitting of E2g in the graphite-like materials and is a characteristic mode of single wall carbon nanotubes.28 The Raman peaks in the longer wavenumber are usually associated with the degree of crystallinity of the carbon nanotubes. It has been reported that single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) behave differently than multiwall nanotubes (MWNTs) in contact with a polymer such as P3HT. Generally speaking, SWNTs are more effective in enhancing the crystallization of the polymer29 whereas MWNTs have a greater effect on the conductivity of the polymer.30,31 Hence, it is expected that the BCNs here possess the merits of both SWNTs and MWNTs.

The HR-TEM image of the composite based on P3HT/(0.5 wt% BCNs) (Fig. 2(b)) indicates that, compared to the pristine P3HT material which exists in the form of many needle-shaped bundles (Fig. 2(a)), the composite consists of a continuous network formed by the carbon nanotubes and P3HT. The surface of each carbon nanotube is fully covered with a layer of P3HT. This phenomenon is consistent with the previous reports by other researchers with the P3HT/nanotube system.22,27,32 Since some of the nanotubes are open-ended in our case, it is possible that the inside wall of the tubes could be covered by the P3HT polymer as well. The thickness of the P3HT layer on the outer surface of BCNs varies in the range of 2–10 nm. The networking structure of P3HT/carbon nanotubes has been reported to favour transfer of charge from P3HT to carbon nanotubes and subsequent transportation of charge along the nanotubes.33 According to Geng et al.,20 the intimate contact between P3HT and carbon nanotubes induced by the π–π or CH2–π interaction facilitates the crystallization of P3HT. This is also confirmed in our case. As shown in the selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) of P3HT (Fig. 2(c)), a blurred diffraction ring with a d spacing of 0.12 nm is observed in the SAED pattern of pristine P3HT which is attributed to the (13, 0, 0) plane of P3HT crystals (JCPDS Card 48-2040). In contrast, the diffraction ring for the same lattice plane of P3HT is much stronger in the composite based on P3HT/(0.5 wt% BCNs) (Fig. 2(d)), suggesting improved crystallinity of P3HT. In addition to the (13, 0, 0) lattice plane, the non-continuous bright dots observed in the SAED pattern of the P3HT/(0.5 wt% BCNs) composite can be assigned to the (020) plane of P3HT. The bright dots strongly suggest the formation of single crystals of P3HT in the composite. Meanwhile, a diffraction ring corresponding to the (100) plane of the BCN is also detected by the SAED pattern of the composite.

The improved crystallinity of P3HT induced by different BCN contents was further confirmed by XRD and UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 3(a and b)). As shown in Fig. 3(a), the pristine P3HT shows a relatively weak and broad XRD peak at 2θ = 5.32° which is assigned to the diffraction of the crystallographic plane of (100) of P3HT crystals. After addition of 0.5 wt% BCNs to P3HT, the XRD peak becomes sharper and stronger, suggesting the transformation of P3HT from semicrystalline to crystalline. However, a further increase of the content of the BCNs up to 2 wt% does not change the intensity of the XRD peak significantly. This suggests that the 0.5 wt% BCN content is sufficient to induce the crystallization of P3HT.

The enhanced local crystalline order of P3HT is also reflected in the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the material as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). The UV-visible light absorption of the BCN is also included in Fig. 3(b) for comparison. Obviously, the BCN does not show observable light absorption in the spectrum range investigated. It is worth noting that all the UV-visible spectra of the HTM composites are normalized using the peak at 555 nm in order to see the evolution of other peaks clearly. Three peaks are observed in the UV-visible absorption spectrum. In particular, the peak at 555 nm belongs to the vibronic absorption of extended conjugation lengths, resulting from the ordered packing of P3HT backbones which is normally observed in the P3HT thin film.34 The peak at 605 nm is the result of inter-chain transition of P3HT and its intensity is correlated with the degree of local inter-chain order.19 The higher the crystalline order, the stronger the intensity of this peak. As illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3(b), the peak intensity at 605 nm increases gradually with the increase of the content of BCNs in the composite, suggesting that the BCN addition improves the crystalline order of P3HT. This result is consistent with the results of XRD and SAED patterns of the materials. It is known that the high crystalline order benefits the charge transport in the P3HT film which may reduce the series resistance of the film when used in PSCs.
To confirm this hypothesis, the charge transport properties of the P3HT/BCN composite films were investigated by measuring the conductivity of the film. As shown in Table 1, the conductivity of the pristine P3HT based film is 1.56 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is comparable to the literature value reported previously.17 However, the conductivity is dramatically enhanced with the addition of BCNs. The addition of 0.5 wt% BCNs in P3HT leads to nearly one order of magnitude enhancement of the conductivity. The conductivity is further increased to 8.65 × 10−3 S cm−1 with 1 wt% BCNs in the P3HT/BCN composite, a more than 50 times increase over pristine P3HT. Further increasing the BCNs to 2 wt% only increases the conductivity slightly. This result provides solid evidence that the charge transport in the P3HT/BCN composite is improved compared to pristine P3HT. The lower series resistance of the HTM composite should have helped in improving the FF of the corresponding PSC devices.

Since a smooth, crystalline surface of the HTM film is highly critical to establish a good interfacial contact with the adjacent MAPbI3 perovskite layer in solar cells, the surface of the HTM film containing different contents of BCNs in P3HT was thoroughly examined (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the surface of the pristine P3HT based film is very rough and consists of grains with variable sizes. Many cracks appear in the film, indicating poor contact between the grains of P3HT. The small grains and cracks are very detrimental for the transport of charge carrier in the film. However, the surface of the HTM film is substantially improved by addition of BCNs as indicated by the formation of grains which are connected with each other to form a smoother continuous film (Fig. 4(b–d)). The new HTM film structure should favour charge transport because of reduced grain boundaries. The nanotubes which are integrated with the P3HT grains can also be seen clearly on the film surface. In particular, compared to all other films, the film based on the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composite shows the best surface morphology with closely packed grains with least cracks. Beyond this value, a further increase of the content of BCNs to 2 wt% leads to the increase of crack in the corresponding film again (Fig. 4(d)). Hence, it is expected that, compared to other HTMs investigated here, the film based on the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composite should be most favourable for charge transport in the PSC device with reduced grain boundaries, hence reducing electron recombination when used in PSC devices.

PSCs were then fabricated using the P3HT/BCN composites as HTMs and their photovoltaic performance was evaluated. The cross-section image of one PSC device based on P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) is illustrated in Fig. 5(a). A clear three layer structure consisting of the TiO2 coated perovskite light absorbing layer/HTM layer/Au electrical contact layer can be seen with the device. The thickness of the MAPbI3/TiO2 film and the HTM layer is around 550 nm and 220 nm, respectively. It is noticed that around 150 nm of the HTM layer penetrates into the MAPbI3/TiO2 mesoporous film to form an integrated structure for efficient interfacial charge transfer between the light absorbing material and the HTM as can be clearly seen in the device.

Fig. 5(b) shows the photocurrent density (J)–photovoltage (V) curves and the corresponding characteristic performance parameters of the representative PSCs employing the prepared P3HT/BCN composite with different contents of BCNs. An apparent striking feature in Fig. 5(b) is that, compared to the pristine P3HT based PSC device, the open circuit photovoltage (Voc) of the P3HT/BCN composite based cells is significantly enhanced with the increase of BCNs up to 1 wt%. The Voc of the cell increases from 0.61 V for P3HT to 0.86 V for the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composite. At the same time, there is a nearly 35% increase in the fill factor (FF) and 11% increase in Jsc of the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composite compared to the device without BCNs. As a consequence, the light to electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 8.3% is achieved with the PSC with P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs), which is over two fold higher than the performance of the pristine P3HT based solar cells (η = 3.6%). It should be mentioned that at least ten cells for each type of the HTM containing different contents of BCNs in P3HT were made to test the reliability of the results. The average performance and the standard deviation of these cells are shown in Table 2. We are aware that a much higher energy conversion efficiency (9.3%) with P3HT based perovskite solar cells was reported by Giacomo et al. using a chloride doped perovskite compound (MAPbClxI3−x).35 For PSCs using MAPbI3 as a light absorber and P3HT as a HTM, the best efficiency that has been reported so far is 4.5%.16 Thus, our base efficiency for P3HT (3.6%) is very reasonable. The much higher efficiency that was achieved in this work using the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composite has set a new milestone for this type of perovskite solar cells.

However, a further increase of the concentration of BCNs to 2 wt% in the composite leads to a dramatic decrease of the solar cell performance and all the performance related parameters including short-circuit current density (Jsc), Voc and FF decrease significantly. A similar behaviour of carbon nanotube content-dependent PV device was also observed in hybrid solar cells based on P3HT/SWNTs by Ren et al.33 They found that there was an optimal concentration of carbon nanotubes in P3HT for efficient charge separation and transportation. Beyond this value, the device performance dropped significantly with an increase in the carbon nanotube concentration.
In order to find out the reason for the different performance of the device with different contents of BCNs in the HTM composite, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PSCs were recorded and the Nyquist plots and Bode plots of the EIS are shown in Fig. 6(a and b). An equivalent circuit (Scheme 1) which mimics the process of charge transport and recombination in perovskite solar cells was used to fit the impedance spectrum to extract the information on resistance for charge recombination, Rct, and chemical capacitance, Cμ.26 The fitted data are shown in Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 6(a) and Table 3, an increased Rct of the PSCs with the addition of BCNs in the HTMs until 1 wt% is observed. The Rct of the device based on P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) is nearly ten-fold higher than the recombination resistance of the cell based on pristine P3HT. Beyond this value, a further increase of BCNs to 2 wt% leads to the decrease of the recombination resistance. The effective electron lifetime, τn, which is the product of Rct and Cμ (τn = Rct × Cμ) reflects the charge recombination rate in the solar cells. The longest τn is obtained with P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) whereas the shortest electron lifetime is obtained with the pristine P3HT. It is found that the trend in the evolution of electron lifetime of the device with different BCN contents is in good agreement with the change of the energy conversion efficiency and the Voc of the cells, suggesting that the change of the electron recombination may be responsible for the different device performance.
Since the general working principles of perovskite solar cells are similar to the well-known dye-sensitized solar cells using a solid state hole transport material,36 the interfacial electron transfer from the TiO2 nanoparticles or the perovskite material to the HTM is believed to be mainly responsible for the recombination in the device. In our case, however, besides the above recombination process, the BCNs can provide an additional pathway for electron recombination. It is known that carbon nanotubes are excellent electron acceptors. At a high content of BCNs in the HTM composite (e.g. 2 wt%), it is very likely that some carbon nanotubes may directly contact the TiO2 nanoparticle and the perovskite material, causing electron transfer from TiO2 and from the perovskite material to BCNs. However, the electron that is transferred to BCNs is confined in the HTM layer and is annihilated through recombination with the hole of P3HT. This may explain the lower electron lifetime and lower performance of the device based on P3HT/(2 wt% BCNs) compared to the PSC with P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs). In addition, the negative effect of a higher content of carbon nanotubes (2 wt%) in P3HT on the surface property of the HTM film is also clearly seen with the reduced grain sizes and increased density of cracks in the film compared to the HTM film containing 1 wt% BCNs (Fig. 4(c and d)). The increased grain boundaries in the P3HT/(2 wt% BCNs) composite could be another contributing factor for the increased charge recombination, leading to reduced device efficiency.
Since an efficient interfacial charge transport between MAPbI3 perovskite and the HTM layer is crucial for the performance of perovskite solar cells, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was employed to study the evolution of the interfacial charge transfer process between the HTM film based on the prepared P3HT/BCN composites and the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite light absorbing layer. The quenching behaviour in a PL spectrum is an indication of the dissociation of an exciton into an electron and a hole, which has been used to characterize the interfacial charge transfer in the perovskite solar cell.7,37,38 As shown in Fig. 7(a), the pure MAPbI3 perovskite material shows a strong PL spectrum with a peak at around 735 nm due to the formation of a high density of photo-generated excitons. This PL spectral peak decreases to around 5% of the pure MAPbI3 when the perovskite film is interfaced with P3HT due to the separation of the electron–hole pair (exciton) and transfer of the hole from the perovskite material to P3HT. A further PL quenching is obtained when perovskite is interfaced with the HTM layers containing BCNs (inset of Fig. 7(a)), suggesting an improved exciton dissociation and more efficient transport of charge across the MAPbI3 perovsktie–HTM interface. In addition, compared to the PL of perovskite/P3HT, the PL of the BCN containing composite is blue-shifted around 15 nm, which could be due to the interaction of BCNs with P3HT in the HTM composite which might change the charge transport route. The BCN facilitated interfacial charge transfer is further confirmed by the time-resolved PL decay spectrum (Fig. 7(b)). The PL decay is shortened from 10 ns to 5 ns when the MAPbI3 is interfaced with the P3HT/BCN composite instead of the pristine P3HT, suggesting a faster interfacial charge transfer process. However, there is no significant difference in the PL spectrum of the MAPbI3 interfaced with the HTM composites containing different contents of BCNs (0.5 wt% to 2 wt%) in P3HT, indicating the limitation of carbon nanotubes in terms of improving the charge separation between the HTM and the perovskite light absorbing layer. This is further confirmed by the very similar PL intensity and decay time for the perovskite material which was interfaced with BCNs only compared to the PL spectrum of the perovskite material. Therefore, the charge separation process at the perovskite–HTM composite should mainly occur between P3HT and MAPbI3 rather than BCNs in the PSC device.

Based on the result of the conductivity and interfacial charge transfer discussed above, clearly the significantly reduced performance of the perovskite solar cells containing a higher content of bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes (2 wt% BCNs in P3HT) cannot be ascribed to the change of either the interfacial charge transfer between the perovskite layer and the HTM layer or the charge mobility of the HTM since the P3HT/(2 wt% BCNs) composite actually has similar PL quenching behaviour and hole conductivity compared to P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs). Instead, the higher charge recombination in the device should be responsible for the change of Voc and the efficiency of the device as confirmed by the EIS study discussed above.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated the effect of the bamboo-structured carbon-nanotubes on the crystallinity, morphology and conductivity of the hole transport material based on P3HT and on the performance of the corresponding perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared to the performance of PSCs with pristine P3HT (maximum conversion efficiency η = 3.6% and average efficiency = (3.1 ± 0.8)%), an over 200% increase of the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency was achieved with the P3HT/(1 wt% BCNs) composite with η = 8.3% (average η = (7.6 ± 1.16)%), mainly owing to the significantly improved open circuit voltage and fill factor. The investigation on the morphology of the P3HT/BCN composite has confirmed that a continuous electron transport nano-network was formed in the composite where the BCNs were fully coated with a layer of P3HT polymer. Such a nano-network structure was confirmed to be efficient for both electron transfer and transport. Over one order of magnitude enhancement of the electrical conductivity was obtained with the HTM composite containing BCNs beyond 1 wt% compared to the conductivity of the pristine P3HT based film. Time-dependent PL spectroscopy has indicated that the PL quenching was two times faster with the P3HT/BCN film interfaced with the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer, suggesting a more efficient charge separation at the interface of perovskite–HTMs, thus reducing the interfacial charge carrier recombination in the device. The study of the composites by XRD, selected area electron diffraction, UV-visible spectroscopy and SEM all confirmed the improved crystallinity and grains of P3HT induced by bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (BCNs). However, the performance of the PSCs strongly depends on the content of BCNs. A higher content of BCNs beyond 1 wt% led to a significant decrease of the performance. The impedance spectroscopy has confirmed that the reduced electron recombination with the addition of BCNs in the HTM layer was responsible for the change of the device performance. This research provided a new insight into the impact of HTMs on the performance of perovskite solar cells and could lead to the development of new HTMs for high efficiency PSCs.
