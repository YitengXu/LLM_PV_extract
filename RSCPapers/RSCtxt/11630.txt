Within just a few years, they have been promoted as serious candidates for cost-efficient, environmentally-friendly thermoelectric power generation, reaching performances comparable to tetrahedrites and other advanced thermoelectric sulphides. From ultralow thermal conductivity to the record-high power factor, this review gives an extensive description of the current state of the art regarding the crystal chemistry and electrical and thermal transport properties of colusites.

1. Introduction
Thermoelectricity is an old concept that began more than 2 centuries ago with the combined discoveries of Aloisio Galvani, Alessandro Volta, Thomas Johann Seebeck, Hans Christian Ørsted, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, Jean Charles Athanase Peltier and later William Thomson, among many others. While the historical aspect of thermoelectricity falls outside the scope of this review, we strongly encourage researchers to read the excellent and very extensive work of Beretta et al., which includes a fascinating read about the history of thermoelectricity.1 Since this early start, thermoelectricity has evolved to become a new potential source of renewable electricity, as well as a novel and versatile technology for heating and cooling devices.2,3 Thermoelectric devices can thus be used as green energy power generators by converting a temperature difference into a useful electrical current. This configuration is particularly attractive considering the challenges that we are facing as a result of our reliance on industrial processes with high-levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Alternatively, thermoelectric devices can also be used as reliable, long-lived heaters or coolers for specific applications where traditional systems fail to meet special requirements such as the absence of mobile parts and vibrations.
In any case, in order to become a more popular technology, thermoelectric devices must simultaneously improve their rather limited efficiency and decrease the cost of raw materials. This is particularly true for power generation as large-scale implementation of cost-efficient devices is necessary to have a meaningful impact in the race against climate change. The efficiency of a thermoelectric module depends in part on the performance of its component n-type and p-type materials. This performance is usually demonstrated by a high value of the dimensionless figure-of-merit, ZT, expressed as:  where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the total thermal conductivity and T is the temperature. The maximum efficiency of the device, ignoring contact resistance, can then be estimated using the equation:  where ΔT/Thot is the Carnot efficiency and ZTavg is the average ZT between the component n-type and p-type materials. For comparison purposes, the current commercialised thermoelectric devices have an efficiency of less than 10% achieved with figures of merit around 1.4,5 In terms of materials, current state-of-the-art thermoelectric modules, in particular for mid-range temperatures (400 < T/K < 600), are often composed of materials prepared from heavy, toxic, rare and/or expensive elements such as Ag, Bi, Pb, Se, Te, etc. (ref. 2 and 6 and references therein).
Indeed, with sustainability being at the heart of the concept of wide-scale thermoelectric modules for energy recovery, it is crucial that the materials within these modules are not only cheap but also abundant and easy to synthesise. Naturally, selenides and tellurides, while offering excellent thermoelectric performances, fall outside of the category of sustainable materials. With an overall abundance of 4 to 5 orders of magnitude greater than Se or Te, sulphur is a much more desirable substitute.7 The availability of tellurium has been deemed critical by the U.S. government, where the production of thermoelectric devices already accounts for 30% of the global consumption of Te, only slightly behind the solar industry at 40%.8 It is clear that tellurides are not suitable materials for cost-effective, truly sustainable, wide-scale thermoelectric power recovery. Selenium does not seem to be a much better alternative with a terrestrial abundance of only 50 ppb, against 3.5 × 105 ppb for sulphur. A very detailed comparison between the three chalcogens has been proposed by Powell, including cost, toxicity and availability constraints.7
The past few years have seen a renewed interest in thermoelectric sulphides as the earth-abundance of sulphur is one critical aspect to encourage the large-scale production of devices with a potentially meaningful impact on mitigating climate change.7 Researchers have also suggested using natural minerals as a direct source of thermoelectrics, such as chalcopyrite or tetrahedrite,9–11 although better performances are usually achieved for a synthetic derivative.12–21 Over the last decade, following reports of excellent properties in ternary and quaternary sulphides, the performance of cost-efficient sulphides has become closer to that of well-established state-of-the-art materials such as chalcogenides,22–24 oxy-chalcogenides,22,25–27 clathrates,28,29 skutterudites,30,31 Zintl phases,32,33 Si–Ge alloys,34etc.6 with ZT values now reaching unity. The meteoric rise of thermoelectric sulphides is perhaps best exemplified by the commercialisation of a tetrahedrite-containing thermoelectric module by Alphabet Energy in 2015,35 only shortly after the first characterisation of the thermoelectric properties of tetrahedrite by Suekuni et al. in 2012.13 Following tetrahedrite's footsteps (but hopefully not its fate as Alphabet Energy ceased all activities in 2018), many newly identified thermoelectric sulphides, and in particular p-type ternary and quaternary copper sulphides, have been investigated. A few examples include bornite Cu5FeS4,36–38 germanite derivative Cu22Fe8Ge4S32,39,40 stannoidite Cu8.5Fe2.5Sn2S12,41 mohite Cu2SnS3,42 kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4,43,44 chalcopyrite CuFeS245 and the highly promising colusite Cu26A2E6S32 (A = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W; E = Ge, Sn, As, Sb). It is worth noting that these materials are all derivatives of the sphalerite system, for which the hybridisation of the Cu-3d states and the S-3p orbitals forms the main contribution to the top of the valence band, see Section 3.1. The hybridisation of the Cu-3d states with delocalised chalcogen-p states has been the subject of extensive theoretical studies,46 and sphalerite-based characteristics have been used for screening potential novel thermoelectric copper sulphides.47 Binary copper sulphides have also piqued the interest of thermoelectric researchers, long before ternary and quaternary sulphides ever did, by a mere 150 years or so with the work of French researcher Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel.48 Incidentally, in that same 1866 communication, Becquerel had already foreseen the potential of natural minerals, writing “The unions of the aforementioned thermoelectric substances are those, as artificially produced, giving the most energetic effects. Perhaps further progress may come with natural minerals; (…)”.† Unfortunately, despite intensive research efforts and the highest ZT values (by far) reported for sulphides, Cu2−xS-based materials have yet to produce reliable devices. The main issue, related to the applicability of superionic thermoelectric materials in modules, is still very much controversial.49,50
In this report, the crystal structure, crystal chemistry and transport properties of the promising thermoelectric material colusite are reviewed. While the focus is given to thermoelectric performance, we will attempt to give a more general overview of the peculiar behaviour of its transport properties. By doing so, we hope that its complexity might be of interest for other fields. For instance, the related tetrahedrite was considered as a potential solar-absorber for photovoltaic cells following the work of thermoelectric scientists.51,52 In recent years, sulphides have been attracting considerable attention because of their terrestrial abundance and their role in essential technologies such as Li/Na/K-ion batteries,53–57 solar cells,54,58,59 fuel cells,54,60,61 or biomedical applications.62–64 Thus, the rich chemistry of colusites could find applications beyond thermoelectricity with a foreseeable impact in the near future.
2. Crystal structure
2.1. Origin
Natural mineral colusite with the general formula Cu24+xV2(As,Sb)6−x(Sn,Ge)xS3265,66 is a somewhat rare mineral that forms in porphyry-type, epithermal and volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits across the globe,65,67–74 first described in 1933.75 Unlike its synthetic counterparts, natural colusite always contains V in the A site and a majority of As on the E site with usually a sizable fraction of Sn, Ge or Sb. Although the generic term “colusite” is favoured for all synthetic derivatives with the general formula Cu26A2E6S32 (A = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W; E = Ge, Sn, As, Sb), the endmembers of the naturally-occurring isostructural materials are sometimes referred to as nekrasovite (or Sn-rich colusite), germanocolusite (or Ge-rich colusite) and stibiocolusite (or Sb-rich colusite).66,67,76 In order to avoid confusion, synthetic materials of the colusite family will be referred to as “A–E colusite” depending on the nature of the cations in the A-site and E-site positions.
2.2. An ordered sphalerite derivative
Like many ternary and quaternary copper sulphides with promising thermoelectric properties, colusite is strongly related to the non-centrosymmetric sphalerite crystal type,7 which consists of vertex-linked MS4 tetrahedral building blocks forming a zinc-blende-like network (space group F3m, asph ≈ 5.1–5.6 Å, 8 atoms per unit cell). In a hypothetical “CuS” sphalerite structure, all CuS4 tetrahedra are thus corner-sharing and oriented in the same direction in a “Cu4S4” cubic cell (Fig. 1a). Even though binary copper sulphides do not crystallise in a simple sphalerite framework, but rather form complex derivative structures,49 many ternary and quaternary copper sulphides exhibit a mixed-cation MS sphalerite framework, sometimes with cationic ordering. Many of those are formed naturally such as chalcopyrite CuFeS2, stannite Cu2FeSnS4, briartite Cu2FeGeS4, famatinite Cu3SbS4, roquesite CuInS2, kuramite Cu3SnS4, kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4, etc. Furthermore, a sphalerite framework can be seen as a host structure that can accommodate a variety of guest species into the array of vacant tetrahedral sites (Fig. 1b). Complete occupation of these sites would result in an antifluorite-type structure, M2S. On many occasions, however, the occupation of some of these interstitials in an ordered fashion can give rise to superstructures, as is the case for colusites and other natural and synthetic minerals such as germanite Cu22Fe8Ge4S32, stannoidite Cu8Fe3Sn2S12 or mawsonite Cu6Fe2SnS8. In sphalerite derivatives, ordering of the cations in tetrahedral positions and/or occupation of an interstitial position usually lead to different space groups and larger unit cells. Similarly, the rather complex colusite structure can easily be described as an ordered “Cu26E6S32” sphalerite-network with a unit cell doubled in all three directions, 2asph × 2asph × 2asph (space group P3n, a = 2asph ≈ 10.5–10.9 Å). In this “Cu26E6S32” sphalerite framework, 6 out of the 32 tetrahedra contain an atom E (E = Ge, As, Sb, Sn), while the remaining 26 CuS4 tetrahedra form the “Cu26S32” conductive network, see Section 3.1. These tetrahedra are ordered as depicted in Fig. 1c. Finally, two “interstitial” atoms per unit cell (A = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W) occupy the 2a position w.r.t. the P3n superstructure, i.e. at the centre and the corners of the 2asph × 2asph × 2asph supercell, leading to 66 atoms per unit cell (Table 1 and Fig. 1c and d). The resulting AS4 tetrahedra are thus sharing edges with the surrounding CuS4 tetrahedra in a similar way to the VS4 tetrahedra in sulvanite.77 Overall, the Cu cations are found in positions 6d, 8e and 12f, A cation in position 2a, E cation in position 6c and S in positions 8e and 24i. As of now, only group 5 and 6 transition metals have been reported as A cations and only Ge, Sn, As and Sb have been observed in the E site in colusites.

2.3. Mixed tetrahedral–octahedral complex
The nature of the species in the 2a position has been found to be a key factor in controlling the electrical transport properties of colusite despite being relatively excluded from the top of the valence band, see Section 3.1. It is thus important to look into the chemical environment surrounding the A atom. As depicted in Fig. 1e, the cation in the “interstitial” 2a position is surrounded by four sulphur atoms (in the 8e position) forming the AS4 tetrahedra. On closer inspection, it appears that the 6 neighbouring Cu atoms (in the 12f position) form an additional octahedral surrounding, resulting in a mixed tetrahedral–octahedral [AS4]Cu6 complex.77,78 Pavan Kumar et al. reported the synthesis of group 6 colusites, Cu26A2Ge6S32 (A = Cr, Mo, W), for the first time and concluded that the A cation was in a +VI oxidation state.78 They observed that, within these complexes (isolated from one another), the observed interatomic distance between A and S was slightly larger than expected from the ionic radii.79 Conversely, the A–Cu distances in the ACu6 (A = Cr, Mo, W) octahedra, determined by combined X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD), were found to be abnormally short for a pure ionic bonding scheme, as supported by bond valence sum calculations. Indeed, the observed values for the A–Cu distance in pristine colusites, ranging from 2.708 Å (A = Cr, E = Ge) to 2.771 Å (A = W, E = Ge),78 are similar to those observed for metal–metal interactions in other inorganic sulphides.80–84 In the V–Sn colusite, which exhibits some of the best thermoelectric performances among quaternary sulphides, the metal–metal interactions in the cluster remain strong with a V–Cu distance of 2.736 Å. Overall, the abnormally long A–S bonds and short A–Cu interactions evidence competition between iono-covalent bonds and metal–metal interactions, resulting in a tetrahedral–octahedral complex whose geometry changes with the nature of the species in the central 2a position.80 This competition arises from the crystal structure of colusite (i.e. insertion of A cations into the sphalerite framework), but is also strongly influenced by the differences in electronegativity between the A cation and the surrounding Cu. Increasing the ionicity of the A–S bond thus softens the neighbouring Cu–S bonds.
By studying Cr–Mo and Cr–W solid solutions of the high-performance Cr–Ge colusite, Pavan Kumar et al. gave valuable insights into the chemical bonding of this family of materials and in particular on the role of the cation in the 2a position, see Section 4.4.80 Successful incorporation of Mo and W in the tetrahedral–octahedral complex was supported by XRPD and the resulting key distances are displayed in Fig. 2. While the determined distances support the under-bonding of the 2a cation with the surrounding sulphur atoms, the evolution of the distances near the complex upon incorporation of the larger isovalent Mo6+ and W6+ brings crucial information about the crystal chemistry of colusite. Indeed, the authors concluded that (i) the interatomic distances within the complex vary significantly with the addition of Mo or W, with a much more pronounced effect for the latter, indicating that a purely ionic model is unsuitable (Fig. 2b and c), (ii) the strength of the metal–metal interaction increases as the size of the cation decreases (Fig. 2c), and (iii) the tetrahedra surrounding the complex are more distorted than the ones found further away and (iv) are more susceptible to vary with the nature of the [AS4]Cu6 complex (Fig. 2d). Overall, the tetrahedra that are connected to the complex, i.e. Cu(8e)S4, can be substantially distorted by modifying the A cation, while less distortion is observed for tetrahedra that are found further away, i.e. Cu(6d)S4 and Ge(6c)S4, in relation to their localisation on higher symmetry sites (Table 1). Because the transport properties of colusite are governed by the Cu–S network, the chemical nature of the A cation has an indirect influence over the transport properties through structural distortion of the neighbouring tetrahedra and thus of the conductive network.

2.4. Synthetic colusite
So far, colusite samples have been synthesised using two different synthesis routes; either by a solid state reaction in a sealed silica tube or by mechanical alloying of the precursors followed by in situ crystallisation during the consolidation step (see Section 4, Table 4). The latter is particularly interesting as it offers a potential scale-up solution although samples with better crystallisation are obtained from sealed-tube synthesis. In the vast majority of reports, trace amounts of second phases can be seen, regardless of the synthesis conditions. It is thus difficult to obtain colusite as a single-phase material. In particular, the synthesis of V–Sn colusite samples from a high-temperature solid-state reaction seems to produce two crystallographically related phases with at least one of them being colusite. The level of caution related to the nature of the second phase, although it appears to be a second colusite phase with a slightly different unit cell parameter, stems from the difficulty to correctly identify the peak splitting for the low-angle superstructure peaks. Nonetheless, such peak splitting was observed in the first report of a synthetic colusite, Cu26−xZnxV2Sn6S32, prepared by a sealed-tube reaction at high-temperature for thermoelectric property investigation by Suekuni et al.85 Both Cu26−xZnxV2Sn6S32 and Cu26−xZnxV2Ge6S32 (x = 0, 2, 4) were synthesised using the same high temperature route from high-purity elemental precursors, involving two-step reacting/sintering at 1273 and 1073 K after intermediate grinding and compacting. The authors reported the crystallisation of two colusite phases with unit cell parameters, a, of 10.759 and 10.802 Å. Interestingly, with the substitution of Cu by Zn, the materials become single-phase with a unit cell parameter of 10.788 and 10.808 Å for x = 2 and x = 4, respectively. Substitution of Cu by Zn was later confirmed by neutron powder diffraction.86
The issue related to phase separation is only observed for the V–Sn colusite, while the same study reported nearly single-phase pristine V–Ge colusite with only traces of CuS impurities. The reasons behind the phase separation in the pristine V–Sn colusite, while single-phase V–Ge colusite and Zn-doped V–Sn colusite could be produced, are not discussed and are yet to be fully understood; however, more studies about V–Sn colusite shed some light on the matter. Suekuni et al., in a different study,88 used an additional hot-pressing step in order to obtain samples with higher densities; by doing so they noticed a significant sulphur loss and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) showed a significant deviation from the stoichiometry with a determined composition of Cu25.97(11)V2.09(6)Sn5.95(7)S30.62(26). This first link between the temperature, sulphur loss and unit cell parameter was followed up later on by Bourgès et al.,89 using mechanical alloying as a synthesis route. However, sulphur loss alone cannot account for the phase separation observed for the V–Sn colusite. Kim et al.87 suggested that the second phase (referred to as phase B in Fig. 3b) observed in the synthesis of pristine V–Sn colusite, and accounting for 20% of the product estimated from the deconvolution of the 622 peaks, had a different crystal structure than colusite with a loss of symmetry. This was evidenced by the loss of intensity of the superstructure peaks at low angles when a Cu-poor colusite “Cu24V2Sn6S32” sample, consisting mainly of phase B, was synthesised (Fig. 3a). Moreover, they determined by EPMA than the stoichiometry of the two phases differs mostly in their Cu:(V, Sn) ratio, suggesting that the phase separation was driven by the formation of a Cu-poor phase as opposed to sulphur loss. This is consistent with the disappearance of phase B with increasing z in Cu26V2Sn6−zS32. This was later followed up by Bourgès et al., where a direct link was established between the sintering temperature (from mechanically alloyed powders) and the enlarged unit cell parameter, through an increase in cationic disorder.89 In another study by Bourgès et al., the authors attributed the exsolution of the pristine V–Sn colusite to the high purity of the starting materials, which deprives the synthetic colusite of stabilising impurities like those observed in natural minerals.86 This observation draws a clear parallel with the cousin mineral tetrahedrite, in which synthetic samples prepared from the nominal stoichiometry consist of two tetrahedrite phases, a Cu-poor Cu≈12.3Sb4S13 and a Cu-rich phase Cu≈14Sb4S13.90,91 As with tetrahedrite, colusite can be synthesised fairly easily when a doping element is added as pristine V–Sn colusite contains a rather high proportion of divalent copper, in terms of formal charges: [Cu+]22[Cu2+]4[V5+]2[Sn4+]6[S2−]32. Substituting copper with a divalent transition metal such as Zn2+ thus stabilises the structure by reducing the proportion of Cu2+. Nonetheless, later studies demonstrated the feasibility of producing a pure pristine V–Sn colusite by increasing the hot-press sintering time from a few minutes to 1 h for powders prepared by sealed-tube synthesis92 or by using mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering (SPS) of elemental89 or binary precursors.93 In the former route, the annealing effect promotes the coalescence of the two related phases into one, while the fine reactive mechanically alloyed powders yield single-phase materials after SPS in the latter. Therefore, it appears that the exsolution of pristine V–Sn colusite, while indirectly linked to sulphur loss because of the required synthesis conditions, is more likely to be imputed to inhomogeneity in bulk powders that can be overcome by longer annealing or mechanical alloying. The latter was found to be a successful and scalable way to produce hundreds of grams of high performance, phase-pure, V–Sn colusite from industrial-grade binary sulphides and elemental vanadium precursors.93 It appears that other compositions, in particular the A–Ge colusites, are easier to produce as single phases, though it should be noted that V–Sn and V–Ge colusites were the first ones to be synthesised and the subsequent studies thus benefitted from earlier findings.

Following the pioneering work of Suekuni et al.,85,88,94 researchers first tried to shy away from using vanadium as there might be practical concerns related to the toxicity of vanadium oxides.95,96 This led Kikuchi et al. to synthesise the first Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites by solid-state reactions, although the latter contained non-negligible amounts of binary copper sulphide impurities.92 The series was extended by Bouyrie et al. to the Ge-colusites with Nb–Ge and Ta–Ge, where impurities were also found.97 The presence of impurities in Ta–E colusite was imputed to the higher melting point and lower reactivity of tantalum.97 Note that in the V–Sn colusite prepared from binary precursors, the elemental vanadium was the last element to react, with the mixture initially forming a ternary Cu–Sn–S phase.93,98 The effect of annealing and cation off-stoichiometry on the Nb–Ge colusite confirmed the observations made on V–Sn colusite with the enlargement of the unit cell with annealing temperature and the link with sulphur loss and cation off-stoichiometry.99 Moreover, in the same investigation, Suekuni et al. demonstrated that modifying the Sn:Cu ratio in the Nb–Sn colusite led to a loss of symmetry with the complete disappearance of the characteristic superstructure reflections of colusite, pointing toward an fcc symmetry for x = 1.2 in Cu26−xNb2Sn6+xS32.99 This is reminiscent of the second phase observed for some V–Sn colusites and suggests that changing the balance between the E-site cation and Cu in colusite will result in a single-phase material with a loss of symmetry. Conversely, temperature-induced sulphur volatilisation only causes a cationic rearrangement, with retention of the symmetry elements of the P3n space group. The possibility to accommodate extra cations in colusite has been exploited by researchers in order to reproduce the effects of cationic disorder, without the need for high-temperature processes.100–102
Finally, the latest addition to the colusite family came with the first synthesis of group 6 colusites, Cu26A2Ge6S32 (A = Cr, Mo, W), by Pavan Kumar et al.78 The samples were successfully synthesised by mechanical alloying and SPS and were crucial to understand the structure–property relationships and in particular the role of the A-site cations in the transport properties of colusites.80,101 So far, there has not been any reported successful synthesis of a colusite involving As or Sb on the E site despite their occurrence in natural minerals.

The first synthetic colusites, Cu26V2E6S32 (E = Sn, Ge), were described as Pauli paramagnets based on the weak temperature dependence of their magnetic susceptibility, consistent with a formal valence of +V for vanadium.85 The authors proposed an electronic structure based on those of related phases Cu3VS4, Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4, and correctly predicted that the top of the valence band (VB) must be composed of hybridised Cu-3d and S-3p orbitals and the bottom of the conduction band (CB) of V-3d/S-3p and E-ns/S-3p (E = Ge, Sn; n = 4, 5) in the presence of a band gap. Subsequently, the electronic band structures have been reported for Cu26V2Sn6S32 and Cu26A2Ge6S32 (A = V, Cr, Mo, W) with band gaps between 0.5 eV and 1 eV depending on the nature of the A and E cations.78,80,88,89 These studies confirmed the formal charges in colusites by combining Mössbauer spectroscopy, structural analyses and electrical property measurements. In group 5 colusites, Cu26A2E6S32 (A = V, Nb, Ta; E = Ge, Sn), as mentioned in the previous section, the formal balance can be written as [Cu+]22[Cu2+]4[A5+]2[E4+]6[S2−]32. The Sn atoms have been confirmed to be in a +IV oxidation state by 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy.86,103 In group 6 colusites, Cu26A2Ge6S32 (A = Cr, Mo, W), the A-site cations was demonstrated to be in a +VI oxidation state,78 reducing the amount of divalent copper by half compared to group 5 colusites: [Cu+]24[Cu2+]2[A6+]2[Ge4+]6[S2−]32. Overall, in order to be able to stabilise the colusite structure by incorporating a cation at the centre of the mixed tetrahedra–octahedral complex, it appears that a d0 electronic configuration is required for A. It is perhaps not surprising considering the complex chemical surroundings and the presence of strong metal–metal interactions.
From the reported electronic density of states for Cu26V2Sn6S32 and Cu26A2Ge6S32 (A = V, Cr, Mo, W), with all compositions exhibiting very similar features,78,85,88,89 it is possible to draw a generalised electronic band structure for colusites (Fig. 4). As mentioned previously, the top of the valence band is mainly composed of hybridised Cu-3d and S-3p orbitals, where the Fermi level lies within the band, giving rise to p-type metallic conduction for un-doped colusite. Note that the multivalley character of the top of the VB and the accompanying large effective masses are desirable characteristics for thermoelectric applications.104 Interestingly, the S atoms contributing the most to the top of the VB are those found in the 24i position, i.e. away from the tetrahedral–octahedral complex, consistent with the concept of a conductive network within the sphalerite framework. Above the band gap, the first onset of conduction bands is mainly composed of the A-cation d orbitals and S-3p orbitals with the former split by the crystal-field effect into e and t2 bands. Overall, the electronic structure of colusite is consistent with ionic bonds between the A cation and the surrounding S atoms, which, in turn, seem to soften the Cu(12f)–S(8e) bonds.89 Ochi et al. studied in-depth the links between the electronic band structure of materials with CuCh4 (Ch = S, Se) tetrahedra and good thermoelectric performances, focusing on the role of the Cu-3d states in low-dimensional complexes.105

The concept of a conductive network, which arises from the hybridised Cu-3d and S-3p orbitals in the sphalerite framework and the Cu(I)–Cu(II) mixed valence, is important as it establishes a link between colusites and other high performance materials derived from the sphalerite structure. Interestingly, a parallel can be drawn between the Cu(I)–Cu(II) mixed valence in thermoelectric copper sulphides, such as colusites, and the concept of Cu(II)–Cu(III) mixed valence in superconductivity.106 These key features were already spotted in the parent mohite, Cu2SnS3, where first-principles calculations demonstrated the existence of a similar 3D Cu–S (and S–S) conductive network.107 The authors correctly predicted excellent thermoelectric properties in Cu2SnS3, resulting from heavy, yet conductive, hybridised Cu-3d/S-3p bands.108 A later study by Shen et al. confirmed that Zn-doped Cu2SnS3 was in fact a very good eco-friendly thermoelectric material.42 Moreover, Xi et al. suggested that doping on Sn sites was likely to be the most efficient carrier-tuning strategy because of the very limited involvement of Sn at the top of the VB. This was later found to be a relatable observation in V–Sn colusite, where introducing Cu/Sn cationic disorder was beneficial for the thermal transport properties while retaining excellent electrical performances.89,103 Recent research also demonstrated that the conductive network of colusite could be functionalised indirectly by the remote action of the A cation in the “interstitial” position.78,80,101 Finally, it appears that strategies involving stoichiometric variations of the E-site cation were overall better at tuning the thermoelectric properties than doping on the Cu sites.87,97
3.2. Vibrational structure
Some crystallographic characteristics, found in popular TE materials, are known to lead to complicated vibrational structures that can be powerful tools in order to lower the thermal conductivity, one of the main concerns of thermoelectric researchers. High performance TE materials with ultralow thermal conductivity often depend on characteristics such as large cages for rattling atoms, e.g. skutterudites or argyrodites,30,109 out-of-plane Cu vibrations, e.g. tetrahedrites110 or Cu4Sn7S16,98,111 low-dimensional structures, e.g. Bi2Te3,112etc. Unfortunately, the crystal structure of colusites does not possess such special features, aside from a relatively exotic mixed tetrahedral–octahedral [AS4]Cu6 complex that does not appear to have a great impact on the thermal transport properties. Nonetheless, the thermal conductivity of pristine colusites remains reasonably low despite high electrical conductivity, see Section 4.1, owing to a large unit cell containing a large number of atoms of various sizes. The phonon dispersions and corresponding vibrational densities of states (VDOSs) for some colusites were computed (Fig. 5) using density functional theory (DFT).78,89 For Cu26V2Sn6S32, two observed features are of particular interest for thermoelectric applications, i.e. with the potential of leading to low thermal conductivity. First, in the phonon dispersion, the compressed acoustic branches are known to lead to low heat carrier velocity and thus to low thermal conductivity.113,114 This was also true for the Cr–Ge and Mo–Ge colusites, not shown here.78 Additionally, low frequency optical modes are observed for all investigated colusites and are known to interact with acoustic vibrational modes for additional scattering channels. Such optical modes are found at frequencies around 40 cm−1 and 60 cm−1 with a large contribution from the Cu in the 12f position. Note that the contribution was mistakenly attributed to Cu(8e) in the text of the original publication.89 This is particularly visible from the atom-projected VDOS of Cu26V2Sn6S32, and perhaps less evident and shifted to higher frequencies for the Cr–Ge and Mo–Ge colusites, where contributions from other Cu positions are also significant in the low-frequency region. In all cases, however, the A cation at the core of the tetrahedral–octahedral complex contributes only mildly to the low-frequency optical modes. Because of the light mass of Cu and the additional metal–metal interaction with the cation in the 2a position, we can extrapolate that colusites possess rather soft Cu(12f)–S bonds, consistent with a major impact on the thermal transport properties. This is corroborated by the computed total energy response to bond compression being softer for Cu(12f) than Cu(8e) or Cu(6d).89 Note that the weak copper bonding, comparable to supressed Cu ion conduction, has been shown to greatly impact the thermal conductivity through localised low-energy vibrational modes.110

In order to obtain a fundamental understanding of the effect of structural disorder on the thermal transport properties of the V–Sn colusite, Candolfi et al. measured the generalised phonon density of states, G(ω), using inelastic neutron scattering, for two samples, (mostly) ordered and (mostly) disordered V–Sn colusites (Fig. 6), denoted samples L and H, respectively.103 In both cases, the obtained G(ω) are consistent with the calculated phonon dispersion and projected vibrational density of states (Fig. 5), with the presence of three blocks of vibrational modes between 5 and 12 meV, and 12 and 22 meV, and beyond 30 meV.89,103 The temperature dependence of the generalised phonon density of states, G(ω), is consistent with a quasiharmonic model of phonon softening evidenced by a relatively insignificant shift in energy upon warming. Thus, both the phonon frequencies and the interatomic force constants solely depend on the thermal expansion of the unit cell volume. This classical behaviour contrasts with the one observed for tetrahedrites where the high degree of anharmonicity causes the low-energy optical modes to shift to higher energies upon warming. Nonetheless, the thermal conductivity of V–Sn colusites remains low (see Section 4) and the high calculated average Grüneisen parameters, , of 1.96 and 1.45 for the L and H samples, respectively, are indicative of bonding anharmonicity. The impact of structural disorder on the thermal transport properties is further detailed in Section 4.2. Note that the Grüneisen parameters for the Mo–Ge colusite, determined from theoretical calculations, are also high with  values of 2.25, 2.27 and 2.34 for the three acoustic mode velocities.78

Finally, calculated and measured values for the sound velocities have been reported for some colusites (Table 2). The first values were reported by Bouyrie et al. for Cu26Nb2Sn6S32 and Cu26Nb2Sn5.5S32,97 prepared by a conventional high-temperature sealed-tube reaction, followed by work on the V–Sn colusite with an emphasis on the effect of the sintering temperature on the structural disorder and ultimately on the thermal transport properties.89,103 It is worth noting that the computed and experimental sound velocities for Nb–Sn and V–Sn colusites, determined by different research groups, point toward rather high values. These are similar to those observed for some metals such as copper or zinc, suggesting that the chemical bonding in colusites remains rather stiff. This is an important point as it helps to understand why the defect chemistry in colusite is not only rich but also favourable for optimising the thermal transport properties and TE performances.

3.3. Defect chemistry
The presence of defects and the tendency to form impurities were noted in the first report of the thermoelectric properties of a colusite, when Suekuni et al. observed the formation of two structurally different, but related, quaternary phases.85 The authors also noticed a rise in the magnetic susceptibility at low temperature attributed to a contribution from paramagnetic impurities and/or induced magnetic moments on Cu vacancies. Details about impurities and phase separation are given in Section 2.4. These early observations suggested that a rich defect chemistry could be anticipated in colusites. Owing to the relatively large number of voids in the structure, such as the interstitial sites 6b (0, 0, ½) and 24i (≈0.25, ≈0.25, ≈0), where the dimension of the empty tetrahedral sites coincides with that of CuS4 tetrahedra,92,99 researchers observed the impact of additional cations. Investigations of the structural and thermoelectric properties were carried out either by directly supplying an over-stoichiometry of cations,100,101 or by causing sulphur volatilisation.89,93,99,103,115 Note that, in natural colusite minerals, a higher cation to anion ratio has been observed, up to a 36:32 ratio.65 Additionally, structural disorder can be encouraged by non-stoichiometry, in particular by varying the Cu:E ratio in Cu26A2E6S32.97,99
The first in-depth study of the defect chemistry in a colusite was carried out by Bourgès et al. on Cu26V2Sn6S32,89 following conflicting reports of TE properties, in particular regarding the thermal transport properties of this phase.85–88,92 The authors compared the crystal structures and the cationic arrangements of samples prepared from mechanical alloying of elemental precursors and consolidated in different conditions, i.e. spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 873 K and hot pressing (HP) at 1023 K, for sample L and H, respectively. The study was followed up by Candolfi et al. with the addition of 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) analysis103 and subsequently scaled-up.93 Similarly, Suekuni et al. used non-stoichiometry and sintering temperature variation to generate disorder in the parent Nb–Sn colusite.99 Overall, the V–Sn and Nb–Sn colusites both exhibit similar defect chemistry: (i) with increasing annealing temperature, the unit cell parameter is shifted to higher values and the amount of atomic-scale structural defects increases while retaining the P3n crystal structure,89,99,103 (ii) decreasing the Cu/Sn ratio first leads to phase exsolution into Sn-rich and Sn-poor phases and (iii) further lowering of the Cu/Sn ratio can lead to a disordered cationic arrangement and a change of symmetry from P3n to F3m.87,99
In pristine V–Sn and Nb–Sn colusites, i.e. stoichiometric and sintered at low temperature samples, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies, including high angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), revealed a highly ordered structure with no apparent defects (Fig. 7a and b).89,99 These initial assessments of the high level of cationic ordering have been somewhat reviewed in subsequent studies by Candolfi et al., where 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy clearly identified a second contribution to the main signal caused by the presence of Sn on a lower symmetry site.103 By carrying out least-squares fitting of sharpened Mössbauer data, and considering the symmetry of the available sites, the authors concluded that, in the sample sintered at low temperature, i.e. the “ordered” sample L, at least 18% of Sn atoms are found on sites with lower symmetry than the expected 6c. Note that it is not possible to conclude that the remaining 82% are all located on 6c as SnCu defects on 6d are indistinguishable because of the same local symmetry  of sites 6c and 6d. However, from crystallographic data, we can consider that most Sn cations do occupy the 6c site. It is fair to assume that this is also the case for the Nb–Sn colusite, despite an evidently well-ordered structure from ADF-STEM images (Fig. 7b).99 We could speculate that the need for a slightly higher Cu/Sn ratio for optimised TE performances, Cu26.3Nb2Sn5.7S32, might originate from a reduced percentage of Sn on Cu sites. The tendency of forming SnCu antisite defects in V–Sn colusite is consistent with total energy calculations (Table 3). Because the favoured 6d and 8e sites are surrounding the Sn position, this leads to a tendency to form 1D-line defects. These line defects are clearly observable in the samples sintered at higher temperature (Fig. 8a) where the ratio of SnCu defects increases significantly, as shown from Mössbauer spectroscopy with at least 65% of Sn atoms located on a lower symmetry site than expected.103 Similarly, the Nb–Sn colusite sintered at higher temperature also exhibits some level of Cu–Sn antisite formation (Fig. 8b).99

 Fig. 8  Evidence for Cu–Sn antisite defects in (a) Cu26V2Sn6S32 (sample H) and (b) Cu26.3Nb2Sn5.7S32 sintered at higher temperatures (1023 and 973 K, respectively). The images include (HA)ADF-STEM images along the [001] and [100] direction, respectively. The corresponding intensity profiles clearly show variations in the relative intensities, indicating exchange between Cu and Sn atoms. Adapted from ref. 89 and 99. 
The additional heat treatment inflicted on sample H of the V–Sn colusite led to the appearance of fully disordered regions (Fig. 9a) similar to those observed in the fully disordered Cu24.8Nb2Sn7.2S32 with fcc symmetry (Fig. 9b). However, in the former, these regions are found within the same crystallite as fully ordered areas, coherently intergrown with an equivalent structural framework and unit cell. In natural samples, similar ordered/disordered domains were also observed, with the assumption made by Spry et al. that the disordered phase is the high-temperature stable form.65 The cationic arrangement can therefore be altered locally in a way that generates 1D line defects and, in some regions, 3D disorder where all cations statistically occupy a fraction of the cation sites of the P3n crystal structure. If the balance between the cations is sufficiently modified, i.e. when the Sn/Cu ratio is significantly increased, the cationic disorder is accompanied by a loss of symmetry. The presence of cations in interstitial positions, although never observed directly, seems highly likely. Indeed, samples that underwent extended heat treatment, and thus suffered sulphur-deficiency and unit cell expansion, are usually accompanied by an increase in the measured density, sometimes above the crystallographic value. These observations, as well as typically cation-rich EDS analyses, point toward cation intercalation instead of sulphur vacancies.93,99

Finally, using industrial-grade binary sulphides and metal vanadium for the scaled-up production of V–Sn colusite led to the formation of additional defects arising from the synthesis mechanism.93 For a high sintering temperature (TSPS = 1083 K), the defects observed are similar to the aforementioned ones, including sulphur loss and cationic disorder at the local scale and over large domains within a crystallite (Fig. 10e). Conversely, for samples sintered at the minimum required temperature of 873 K to reach sufficiently high density, the binary sulphide precursors evidently reacted first, leaving metal vanadium to form the colusite structure through diffusion into a Cu–Sn–S matrix. This is consistent with a previous in situ neutron diffraction investigation of Cu4Sn7S16 that observed the rapid reaction of the vanadium sample holder with the Cu–Sn–S phase above 960 K.98 As a result of the rapid sintering and the low temperature, nano- and micro-scale defects were observed. At the micro-scale, incomplete diffusion of vanadium led to the presence of residual vanadium-rich core shell structures (Fig. 10a), while the inhomogeneous cationic distribution resulted in nano-scale Cu-rich or V-rich regions (Fig. 10b) and local intergrowth of colusite and sulvanite crystallites (Fig. 10c and d). Expectedly, all the aforementioned structural and microstructural defects have a significant impact on the thermoelectric properties of colusites and can be controlled through the synthesis and consolidation processes.

4. Transport properties
The thermoelectric performances of colusite materials depend on a number of factors, which makes it rather difficult to have a clear view of the impact of each individual parameter such as the composition, process, doping or defect chemistry. For instance, the transport properties of pristine materials can be severely altered by the synthesis conditions such as sulphur volatilisation during sintering.89 Therefore, comparing the thermoelectric properties of pristine A–E colusites in order to deduct the influence of the A and E cations can be seriously overshadowed by thermal effects on the stoichiometry and cation order/disorder. The same is true for doping investigations, where hole doping might have a different impact on the transport properties of a stoichiometric sample compared with a sulphur-deficient material.88 As a result, defect chemistry has been studied in-depth and was particularly successful in achieving high ZT values for the A–Sn (A = V, Nb) colusites (detailed in Section 4.2).89,99 Following the excellent performance of these materials, research was extended to other Sn- and Ge-colusites.
In the first part, the performance of pristine colusites will be discussed, including reported transport properties of stoichiometric samples and, as best we can, excluding the effect of impurities, off-stoichiometry or process. In the second part, the impact of process-induced sulphur volatilisation and structural disorder will be discussed, including samples that were regarded as pristine at the time. Finally, the effect and conclusions drawn from different doping strategies and from the transport properties of solid solutions will be addressed.
4.1. Pristine A–E colusites (A = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W; E = Ge, Sn)
In the first report of the low-temperature TE properties of the V–Sn colusite, the cold-pressed and sintered sample displayed a metallic behaviour with resistivity and Seebeck coefficient values at room temperature of 0.4 mΩ cm and 27 μV K−1, respectively (Table 4).85 As a result of the consolidation route, the samples showed rather poor densities but retained an overall stoichiometry close to the nominal one thanks to the contained atmosphere of the silica tubes. However, the XRPD data clearly showed significant phase separation, probably arising from inhomogeneous repartition of the cations, as described in Section 2.4. Nonetheless, these values were confirmed later by Bourgès et al. on mechanically alloyed samples sintered at low temperature, i.e. SPS at 873 K (sample L), with an electrical resistivity from ca. 0.4 to ca. 1.2 mΩ cm and a Seebeck coefficient from ca. 30 μV K−1 to ca. 90 μV K−1, at 300 and 675 K, respectively (Fig. 11a and b).86,89 Note that Bourgès et al. initially obtained a pristine sample containing 2 colusite phases,86 and the measured performances were similar to those of the single phase ordered sample (Table 4).89 The metallic behaviour of pristine V–Sn colusite is consistent with a measured charge carrier concentration of 3.26 × 1021 cm−3 and Hall mobility of 4.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.89 The V–Sn colusite, phase-exsoluted or not,86,89 with a composition close to the nominal stoichiometry of Cu26V2Sn6S32 and high crystallinity with a low level of cationic disorder,103 is metallic with low electrical resistivity and a low Seebeck coefficient in agreement with the band structure calculations (Fig. 5). These electrical transport properties lead to a power factor increasing from ca. 0.2 to ca. 0.7 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 and 675 K, respectively (Fig. 11c). In terms of thermal transport properties, the pristine well-ordered V–Sn colusite, unlike its process-controlled counterpart, exhibits a fairly high thermal conductivity with values ranging from ca. 2.9 to ca. 1.7 W m−1 K−1 at 300 and 675 K, respectively (Fig. 11d). In the first report of the low-temperature TE properties of the V–Sn colusite, the poorly densified (but stoichiometric w.r.t. sulphur loss) sample displayed a room temperature thermal conductivity of 2.7 W m−1 K−1, consistent with the work of Bourgès et al. (Table 4).85 This rather high thermal conductivity is the result of a combination of a relatively high electronic contribution from the metallic behaviour of the electrical transport properties and a high lattice contribution from the high level of cationic ordering (Fig. 11e). Overall, the promising thermoelectric performances of V–Sn colusites are reflected in a reasonably high figure of merit for a sulphide with a ZT value reaching 0.27 at 675 K (Fig. 11f).89

 Fig. 11  Thermoelectric performance of selected stoichiometric A–E colusites with a low level of temperature-induced cationic disorder including the (a) electrical resistivity, ρ, (b) Seebeck coefficient, S, (c) power factor, S2ρ−1, (d) thermal conductivity, κ, (e) lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity, κlat, and (f) figure of merit, ZT. The graph includes original data for the Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites; data for the remaining compositions were taken and adapted from ref. 89 and 78. 
The isovalent substitution of vanadium by the other group 5 elements Nb and Ta successfully produced four new colusites with either Sn or Ge as the E site cation (Table 4). This was first achieved by Kikuchi et al. with the synthesis of pristine Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites.92 However, the synthesis and sintering conditions point toward partially disordered samples with sulphur deficiency and cation insertion, as described in Section 2.4, so their electrical performances must be regarded as those of the process-controlled transport properties and will be discussed in Section 4.2. Instead, in order to confirm that the performances of Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn are similar to those of V–Sn colusite, we measured the thermoelectric properties of samples prepared by mechanical alloying and low-temperature SPS (873 K, the experimental procedure is detailed elsewhere).93 As expected, when prepared in conditions that provide stoichiometric and well-ordered samples, Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites exhibit strikingly similar transport properties to those of pristine V–Sn colusite (Fig. 11). The minor differences, within the experimental error, between the V–Sn and the Nb/Ta–Sn colusites reported here are most likely caused by the different precursors used and the presence of trace amounts of impurities. These results clearly show that, in the case of group 5 Sn-colusite, the nature of the 2a cation has little impact on the electrical and thermal properties, in relation to the weak cationic size difference and similar Pauling electronegativity for V5+, Nb5+ and Ta5+ cations compared to group 6 colusite (see below). It is easily explained by the electronic and vibrational structures (Sections 3.1 and 3.2) of V–Sn colusite and the very minor role that V plays in the key regions, i.e. at the top of the valence band in the electronic structure and the low-frequency regions in the vibrational structure.
The critical role of the “interstitial” 2a position was brought forward by the investigations into the transport properties of group 6 colusites, in particular with the study of the structure–property relationship in Cu26Cr2−xAxGe6S32 (A = Mo, W; x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2), detailed in Section 4.4.78,80 The specific structural characteristics of the mixed tetrahedral–octahedral complex can be found in Section 2.3 and information about the electronic structure can be found in Section 3.1. These are crucial to understand the excellent electrical performance of group 6 colusites in general, and of the Cr–Ge colusite in particular (Fig. 11). First considering the pristine phases, it is remarkable to observe a low metallic electrical resistivity in Cr–Ge while this composition simultaneously exhibits the highest Seebeck coefficient, with values ranging from ca. 84 to ca. 150 μV K−1 for 300 and 700 K, respectively (Fig. 11a and b and Table 4). Comparatively, the Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites exhibit similar Seebeck coefficients with values ranging from ca. 65 to ca. 130 μV K−1 for 300 and 700 K, respectively.78 Note that all group 6 colusite samples were sintered at low temperature, i.e. SPS at 873 K, and HAADF-STEM images confirmed the overall good crystallinity of the samples and the absence of disordered regions or 1-D line defects. Calculations of the Seebeck coefficient using Boltzmann transport theory with a constant relaxation time approximation gave reasonably good agreement between experimental and theoretical results for Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites, as well as V–Ge colusite prepared under similar conditions. The charge carrier concentration in the latter was measured to be ca. 6.3 × 1021 cm−3 at room temperature, decreasing down to ca. 4.2 × 1021 cm−3 and ca. 4.1 × 1021 cm−3 for Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites, respectively.78 These results are well explained by standard models and the relationship between the electrical conductivity, carrier concentration and Seebeck coefficient is respected. Indeed, the higher Seebeck coefficient and the lower electrical resistivity and charge carrier concentration in Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites, compared to V–Ge colusite, are well explained by the change of oxidation states. Going from a group 5 to a group 6 “interstitial” cation shifts the Fermi level higher up in the valence band where fewer and heavier charge carriers contribute to the transport properties. However, in the case of Cr–Ge colusite, this standard model fails to reproduce the observed trend in the electrical transport properties.78 While this approach explains the higher Seebeck coefficient and larger charge carrier effective mass in Cr–Ge, with calculations in fair agreement with the experiments, it fails to explain the lower electrical resistivity and higher charge carrier concentration. By considering the limits of the model, in particular the assumption that the relaxation time remains constant when substituting Cr6+ for Mo6+ or W6+, Pavan Kumar et al. concluded that the nature of the A cation influences not only the crystal structure around the tetrahedral–octahedral [AS4]Cu6 complex but also the relaxation time through its impact on the Cu–S conductive network.78 As described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the conductive network is less distorted and less electrostatically perturbed when replacing Mo6+ or W6+ with the smaller, less electronegative Cr6+. Indeed, the A–Cu distance is shorter in Cr–Ge colusite, adding metallicity to the system with minimum disruption of the geometry of the conductive network. The authors experimentally linked this observation to an increase in the scattering relaxation time, τ, in the case of Cr–Ge colusite when combining the calculated ρτ and measured ρ.78 Moreover, the relaxation time for Mo is slightly higher than for W, confirming the assumption that the nature of the A cation (size, induced distortions and Pauling electronegativity) influences the relaxation time and therefore the transport properties. Owing to the remarkable transport property behaviour in Cr–Ge colusite, the power factor is the highest reported to date for an iono-covalent sulphide with values ranging from 1.53 to 1.94 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 and 700 K, respectively (Fig. 11c).78 In particular, the average power factor over this temperature range is exceptionally high with a value of 1.86 mW m−1 K−2. This performance is particularly significant as thermoelectric sulphides usually reach high ZT values through ultralow thermal conductivity and modest power factor values. Note that ultralow thermal conductivity materials might even be unsuitable for a number of applications.117
As with the other well-ordered colusites, all the group 6–Ge colusites exhibit fairly high thermal conductivity values (Fig. 11d and Table 4). For Cr–Ge colusite, the thermal conductivity decreases from ca. 2.8 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K to ca. 1.5 W m−1 K−1 at 700 K, consistent with the measured values for the ordered V–Sn colusite. For the Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites, the thermal conductivity decreases progressively with the increasing atomic number.78 As evidenced by the calculated lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity (Fig. 11e), the difference between the three group 6 cations mostly depends on the electronic contribution. The lower electrical resistivity observed for the Cr–Ge colusite is thus responsible for its higher thermal conductivity. However, the corresponding record-high power factor more than makes up for this loss and the resulting figure of merit, ZT, reaches 0.86 at 700 K (Fig. 11f). Comparatively, in the Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites, despite a reduced thermal conductivity, the larger induced distortions of the conductive network caused by the size and higher electronegativity of the A cation yielded lower power factors and ultimately lower ZT values of ca. 0.1 and ca. 0.65 at 300 and 700 K, respectively.78 While the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is directly linked to the conductive network and thus might be difficult to reduce without altering the power factor, the lattice contribution, however, remains high when compared to optimised group 5 colusites. The very similar lattice contributions between Cr–Ge, Mo–Ge and W–Ge colusites are consistent with their calculated vibrational structures (see Section 3.2) where the A cation does not contribute significantly to the low frequency optical modes. Meanwhile, the important contribution from the neighbouring Cu positions, a feature shared with V–Sn colusite, as well as Cu positions further away from the A cation, suggests that cationic disorder could have a similar impact on the vibrational structure, resulting in ultralow lattice thermal conductivity.
The electrical and thermal transport properties for the ordered pristine V–Ge colusite with no process-induced sulphur deficiency were reported by Pavan Kumar et al., with thermoelectric performances in between those of group 5 Sn- and group 6 Ge-colusites.78 Once again, the transport property behaviour is metallic with an electrical resistivity of 0.45 mΩ cm and a Seebeck coefficient of 45 μV K−1 at 300 K, and up to ca. 0.9 mΩ cm and ca. 110 μV K−1 at 700 K, respectively (Table 4).78 The moderate power factor of 0.4 mW m−1 K−2 at room temperature increases up to 1.4 mW m−1 K−2 at 700 K. This is promising for high temperature TE applications considering its excellent thermal stability (see Section 5) and the non-optimised figure of merit, ZT, reaches 0.6 at 700 K.78
4.2. The role of process
The role of the process in the level of cationic disorder and consequently in the transport properties has first been elucidated for V–Sn colusite, following discrepancies in the reported performances.89,93,103 This helped to explain the previously reported excellent performances of some other colusites, which can also be imputed to the effect of the process. Indeed, most samples were prepared under high-temperature conditions, where sulphur volatilisation generates disorder and adjusts the charge carrier concentration. This was the case for the first report of the high-temperature TE performances of V–Sn and V–Ge colusites by Suekuni et al., using samples hot-pressed at 1073 K (Table 4).88 The authors observed a more semiconducting behaviour compared to the metallic cold-pressed samples, as well as significantly larger unit cell parameters.85 This was later confirmed by Bourgès et al. on single-phase samples by comparing mechanically alloyed V–Sn colusites sintered by either SPS at 873 K (sample L) or by hot pressing at 1023 K (sample H).89 Both samples had very different transport behaviours, going from a metallic sample L to a less conducting sample H (Fig. 12). Sample H exhibits an electrical resistivity from ca. 2.8 to ca. 4.3 mΩ cm and a Seebeck coefficient from ca. 100 and ca. 175 μV K−1, at 300 and 675 K, respectively, with an upturn in the electrical resistivity at around 350 K (Fig. 12a and b). The larger sulphur volatilisation decreases the measured charge carrier concentration from 3.26 × 1021 to 1.35 × 1021 cm−3 and the Hall mobility from 4.3 to 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for samples L and H, respectively.89 The variations in the electrical transport properties are mainly encouraged by sulphur volatilisation and cationic rearrangement, in particular with potential Cu intercalation.99 Overall, the power factor of the process-controlled V–Sn colusite ranges from ca. 0.4 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 K to ca. 0.7 mW m−1 K−2 at 675 K (Fig. 12c).89 This represents a two-fold increase at room temperature up to a value at 675 K, similar to that of the well-ordered V–Sn colusite. Similarly, comparing the TE performance of V–Ge colusites sintered at different temperatures, the Seebeck coefficient of V–Ge hot-pressed at 1073 K88 reached much higher values than the cold-pressed85 or SPS (873 K) samples78 with a room temperature value of 125 up to 215 μV K−1 at 663 K (Table 4).88 Simultaneously, the resistivity increased by more than an order of magnitude despite the higher density of the hot-pressed sample. Note that owing to the isovalent substitution of Sn4+ by Ge4+ and the insignificant contribution of these atoms to the top of the valence band, V–Ge colusite displays electrical transport properties remarkably similar to the V–Sn colusite when prepared under similar conditions, i.e. at a high sintering temperature of 1073 K (Table 4).
 Fig. 12  Thermoelectric performance of selected A–E colusites, prepared by SPS at 873 K and hot pressing (HP) at 1023 K, showing the effect of temperature-induced cationic disorder including the (a) electrical resistivity, ρ, (b) Seebeck coefficient, S, (c) power factor, S2ρ−1, (d) thermal conductivity, κ, (e) lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity, κlat, and (f) figure of merit, ZT. The graph includes original data for the Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites; data for the remaining compositions were taken and adapted from ref. 89 and 92. 
The thermal conductivity of V–Sn colusite hot-pressed at 1023 K (sample H) is significantly lowered w.r.t. sample L from ca. 2.9 W m−1 K−1 to 0.67 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and from ca. 1.7 to 0.56 W m−1 K−1 at 675 K (Fig. 12d). Such low thermal conductivity is consistent with the sulphur-deficient high-temperature hot-pressed sample reported by Suekuni et al. (Table 4).88 The decrease in the thermal conductivity with increasing sintering temperature arises from reductions in both electronic and lattice contributions (Fig. 12e). In particular, the decrease in the lattice contribution is significant with high-temperature hot-pressed samples exhibiting a quasi-glassy thermal conductivity, down to the theoretical minimum of 0.27 W m−1 K−1.89,118 At low temperature, sample H even exhibits a glass-like temperature dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity.103 The significant decrease in both contributions to the thermal conductivity is attributed to short-wavelength phonon scattering by S vacancies99 and cationic disorder.89,103 This conclusion was supported by a decrease in the measured sound velocities (Table 2) and the shape of the phonon dispersion and vibrational DOS as described in Section 3.2 (Fig. 5). However, further insights on the impact of the Cu–Sn antisites, described by Candolfi et al.103 (see Section 3.3), strongly suggest that the distribution of cations is significantly modified with temperature and has a more significant impact on the transport properties, along with potential Cu intercalation. In other words, the fully disordered regions observed in Section 3.3, where symmetry is lost, are less responsible for variations in the thermal transport properties than antisite defects. The glasslike temperature dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity is thus caused by a shortening of the acoustic phonon lifetimes, encouraged by mixed occupation on the cationic sites, most likely in the form of Cu–Sn antisites, as evidenced by their low formation energy (Table 3). As a result, the figure of merit of samples presenting a high degree of cationic disorder is significantly improved by the glasslike lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity. The disordered V–Sn colusite sintered at high-temperature (sample H) reaches a ZT of 0.93 at 673 K, which constitutes a three-fold improvement over the more stoichiometric and more ordered colusite sintered at 873 K.89 Similarly, the thermal conductivity measured in the V–Ge colusite sintered at high temperature is very low with values close those of disordered V–Sn colusites. As a result, the figure of merit of V–Ge colusite ranged from 0.26 to 0.73 at 350 and 663 K, respectively.88 Moreover, in the same study with a sintering temperature of 1073 K, V–Sn colusite displayed slightly lower performances, suggesting that process-controlled V–Ge colusite might also be a highly promising thermoelectric sulphide.
Note that a power factor of 1.04 mW m−1 K−2 at 663 K was achieved for an up-scaled sample after SPS sintering at 1083 K (Table 4).93 In the latter, the formation of structural defects that differ from the lab-scale high-purity precursor synthesis (see Section 3.3) is responsible for its different transport properties. In particular, the charge carrier concentration was measured to be much higher, nh+ ≈ 4.5 × 1021 cm−3, with slightly lower charge carrier mobility, μ300K ≈ 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1.93 The thermal conductivity remained higher than those of the lab-scale high-purity samples, evidencing a competition of effects between the various types of process-controlled defects described in Section 3.3. Because both the electrical conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity remained comparatively high, the overall thermal conductivity was measured to be twice as high as sample H. Owing to the record high power factor in this material, the figure of merit remained fairly high, reaching ca. 0.7 at 673 K and an average value of 0.41 over the temperature range 300 ≤ T/K ≤ 673.93
As expected from the effect of the process on the TE properties of V–Sn colusite, a very similar scenario was confirmed with the other group 5 cations by comparing the performances of Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites hot-pressed at 1023 K, from the work of Kikuchi et al.,92 with samples sintered by SPS at 873 K (Fig. 12).89 Indeed, the electrical resistivity of the materials hot-pressed at high temperature ranges from ca. 3.7 and 2.6 mΩ cm at 300 K to ca. 7.3 and 5.7 mΩ cm at 660 K for Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites, respectively (Fig. 12a). The large increase in electrical resistivity caused by the higher sintering temperature is strikingly similar to the one observed for V–Sn colusite. The same can be said about the Seebeck coefficient with values ranging from ca. 120 μV K−1 at 300 K to ca. 200 μV K−1 at 660 K for both Nb–Sn and Ta–Sn colusites (Fig. 12b).92 The maximum power factor was achieved for the Ta–Sn sample with values ranging from ca. 0.5 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 K to ca. 0.7 mW m−1 K−2 at 675 K (Fig. 12c). By analogy with V–Sn colusites, the decrease in both the electronic and lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity is most likely caused by an increased level of process-induced cationic disorder. As a result, the figure of merit is well optimised, reaching ca. 0.8 for Ta–Sn colusite at 670 K.92
Similarly, the TE properties of Nb–Ge and Ta–Ge colusites have been reported for samples prepared using high sintering temperatures, thus producing process-induced sulphur-deficient samples with a less metallic behaviour than the stoichiometric Sn-colusite counterparts presented in Section 4.1.97 Considering this, they displayed thermoelectric properties similar to those of their Sn-containing counterparts when sintered under similar conditions (Table 4). By analogy with what we observed in Sn-colusites (Fig. 12), we can speculate that pristine Nb–Ge and Ta–Ge colusites should have a very metallic behaviour close to that of group 5–Sn colusites. It is very likely that their excellent performances were achieved by process-controlled sulphur volatilisation and cationic disordering. In particular, the Nb–Ge colusite exhibits ZT values between ca. 0.2 and ca. 1 at 300 and 670 K, respectively.97
Introducing cationic disorder in order to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity has been considered for the high power factor Cr–Ge colusite. However, the required high temperatures are impractical due its lower thermal stability, see Section 5.115 Artificially increasing the cationic disorder by using cationic overstoichiometry has led to a disruption of the electrical transport properties, with a more pronounced effect on the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity via tuning of the charge carrier concentration.101 With only a small fraction of additional cations, [Cu26Cr2Ge6]1.024S32, distortion of the conductive network, similar to that of the solid solutions detailed in Section 4.4, could be achieved, resulting in an ionised impurity-like scattering mechanism above 100 K. This time, however, the charge carrier concentration is simultaneously decreased, leading to higher values for the Seebeck coefficient and the overall power factor remaining fairly high, while decreasing the electrical component of the thermal conductivity (Table 4).101 Unfortunately, as opposed to temperature-induced disorder, this strategy does not seem to increase the concentration of antisite defects responsible for shorter acoustic phonon lifetimes, and thus the lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity remains almost the same. The best performing composition, [Cu26Cr2Ge6]1.024S32, still exhibits a minor improvement with ZT reaching unity at 700 K.101
4.3. Doping strategies
Initially, partial substitution of Cu by Zn was first proposed as a doping strategy with the added benefit of producing single-phase materials in early reports (Section 2.4).85,86 The substitution of Cu by a divalent element enables tuning of the carrier concentration by filling the valence band up to a semiconducting behaviour where the formal charges can be written as [Cu+]22[Zn2+]4[V5+]2[Sn4+/Ge4+]6[S2−]32. This lead to a significant increase in the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient for Zn-doped V–Sn and V–Ge colusites at 300 K, respectively (Table 4).85 However, the power factor at high temperature was only optimised by Zn doping on samples sintered at low temperature (Fig. 13c),86i.e. on samples that remained rather stoichiometric and relatively free of defects. In those samples, the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient were significantly increased with the sintering temperature, as exemplified by Cu24Zn2V2Sn6S32 (Fig. 13).86,87 The best value was achieved by Cu25ZnV2Sn6S32 sintered at 873 K with 0.92 mW m−1 K−2 at 700 K (Table 4).86 For samples sintered at higher temperature, and thus exhibiting a more semiconducting behaviour, Zn doping was found to be detrimental for the electrical properties, as with Cu24Zn2V2Sn6S32 hot-pressed at 1073 K (Fig. 13).87
 Fig. 13  Thermoelectric performance of Cu24Zn2V2Sn6S32, Cu26−xNb2Sn6+xS32 (x = −0.3, 1.2) and Cu26Ta2Sn5.5S32 including the (a) electrical resistivity, ρ, (b) Seebeck coefficient, S, (c) power factor, S2ρ−1, (d) thermal conductivity, κ, (e) lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity, κlat, and (f) figure of merit, ZT. Data were taken and adapted from ref. 86, 87, 97 and 99. 
Adding extra cations in the form of Co, Ni and Fe insertion was attempted, with little-to-no effect on the unit cell parameters and thermoelectric properties.100 It seems, however, that, in the case of Fe addition, the large increase in electrical resistivity, consistent with the observed decrease in charge carrier concentration and mobility, evidences some level of substitution. Bouyrie et al.102 studied the possible substitution of Cu by Ni and Co in V–Ge colusite as such a strategy was found to be effective in the related tetrahedrites.102 While Co substitution does seem to behave in a similar fashion to Zn, resulting in a loss of thermoelectric performance, Ni substitution appears to be more complicated, with retention of the metallic character of the electrical resistivity, while the Seebeck coefficient remains comparatively low. As a result, both doping strategies were found to be rather ineffective for thermoelectric performance enhancement.
Bouyrie et al. proposed to use E-site off-stoichiometry in order to tune the TE performance of Nb/Ta–Sn and Nb/Ta–Ge colusites.97 The aim of producing samples with Sn or Ge-deficiency is two-fold; it allows for charge carrier concentration adjustments and, in the cases of Ta–Ge colusite, helps to produce phase-pure materials, probably by preventing the formation of a disordered phase in regions with high Ge/Cu ratio. Again, note that the reported transport properties are best described as those of the sulphur-deficient, partially disordered phases. They obtained samples with generally better purity and no, or less, second phases by synthesising E-site cation deficient samples. The electrical performance for the Sn-deficient samples clearly shows a lower electrical resistivity for an unchanged Seebeck coefficient w.r.t. the pristine phases, resulting in the highest power factor values achieved in Nb/Ta colusites (Table 4). As presented in Sections 2.4 and 3.3, Suekuni et al. relied on earlier findings on the defect chemistry of the V–Sn colusite, and in particular on its dependence on the composition and preparation conditions, in order to boost the thermoelectric performance of the parent Nb–Sn colusite.99 The authors studied the effect of varying the Sn:Cu ratio and structural disorder, illustrated here in Fig. 13, by comparing the performance of Cu26−xNb2Sn6+xS32 for x = −0.3, hot-pressed at 873 and 973 K (Table 4), and for x = 1.2, corresponding to a sample with a complete loss of cationic ordering (see Section 3.3). As expected, increasing the Cu:Sn ratio has led to a decrease in the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 13a and b), consistent with the work of Bouyrie et al.97 Meanwhile, increasing the sintering temperature of Cu26.3Nb2Sn5.7S32 has led to a noticeable decrease in charge carrier concentration, evidenced by a four-fold increase in the electrical resistivity over the whole investigated temperature range (Table 4).99 This is accompanied by a nearly two times higher Seebeck coefficient and an improved power factor over the whole temperature range.99 For the fully disordered Cu24.8Nb2Sn7.2S32, the electrical resistivity is increased by more than an order of magnitude with a temperature dependence at the frontier between semiconducting and metallic (Fig. 13a). The Seebeck coefficient is also largely increased with values ranging from ca. 225 to ca. 350 μV K−1 at 300 and 675 K, respectively (Fig. 13b). This apparent decrease in the charge carrier concentration is consistent with a loss of the mixed valence of Cu, as is the case with Zn substitution in V–Sn colusite.86
The thermal conductivity for all Nb/Ta–Ge/Sn colusites and their doped-derivatives remains below 0.7 W m−1 K−1 over the whole temperature range, when prepared at high sintering temperatures (Fig. 13d and Table 4). This highlights the importance of the process to stoichiometric changes when attempting to decrease the thermal conductivity.92,97 It is likely that the thermal conductivity for the corresponding samples sintered under milder conditions would exhibit higher values, more consistent with those of the well-ordered V–Sn colusite, sample L (Fig. 12d and e). Overall, process-enhanced Cu26Ta2Sn5.5S32 exhibits similar performances to the pristine Nb–Ge colusite with a figure of merit reaching around unity at 670 K.97 The case of the fully disordered Cu24.8Nb2Sn7.2S32 is intriguing as its lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity is almost identical to those of Nb/Ta–Sn colusite sintered under similar conditions (Fig. 13d and e). Despite an increased level of disorder and a complete loss of symmetry elements responsible for the colusite structure, Cu24.8Nb2Sn7.2S32 exhibits a lattice thermal conductivity from 0.84 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K to 0.51 W m−1 K−1 at 673 K (Fig. 13e).99 This is consistent with the work of Candolfi et al. on the V–Sn colusite system, where the large decrease in the lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity upon increasing the sintering temperature could be mostly attributed to the formation of Cu–Sn antisite defects.103 The fully disordered regions observed in Section 3.3, compared to the modified ordered structure of Cu26.3Nb2Sn5.7S32, were ineffective in reducing the thermal conductivity. This supports the conclusion drawn by Candolfi et al. that the atomic-scale defects in a modified ordered structure, rather than disordered regions, are likely to provide additional phonon scattering.103
4.4. Solid-solutions
As opposed to chemical doping and its predictable impact on the transport properties, forming solid-solutions in A–Ge colusites was successful on a more fundamental level. While they were found to be rather ineffective in improving the TE performances of group 6–Ge colusites, the Cr/Mo and Cr/W solid solutions confirmed the crucial role of Cr within the tetrahedral–octahedral complex in the conductive mechanism of Ge-based colusites.80 While the Seebeck coefficient follows the expected trend with values very similar to those of the pristine Cr–Ge colusite, consistent with the very similar measured charge carrier concentration, the electrical resistivity shows an upturn at a temperature of ca. 375 K, below which the resistivity exhibits a semiconducting behaviour. This is confirmed by low temperature transport property measurements (Fig. 14). As with Cr–Ge colusite (see Section 4.1), theoretical calculations within the constant relaxation time approximation cannot account for this observation.80 Similarly, combining the calculated ρτ and measured ρ for solid solutions is consistent with the pristine materials above the upturn temperature but the determined relaxation time suffers significant shortening when the temperature decreases below 400 K. This underlines the importance of Cr in the 2a position but also the role of chemical disorder within the tetrahedral–octahedral complex, induced by the mixed occupancy by atoms of largely different ionic radii and illustrated by the cation-size variance, σ2.119
 Fig. 14  Electrical resistivity, ρ, and Seebeck coefficient, S, of pristine group 6 colusites and Cr/Mo and Cr/W solid solutions at low temperature. Data were taken and adapted from ref. 80. 
The effect of cation-size mismatch is particularly clear when looking at the low temperature electrical resistivity and Hall mobility measurements (Fig. 15). For samples with the highest cation-size variance, i.e. for a 50/50 occupation of the 2a “interstitial” site, the conduction mechanism above 100 K changes from typical acoustic phonon scattering (Hall mobility ∝ T−3/2) in pristine colusites to ionised impurity-like scattering (Hall mobility ∝ T3/2).80 Pavan Kumar et al. suggested that this behaviour originates from phenomena associated with variable-range hopping (VRH) and/or chemical disorder/localisation. In any case, these results demonstrated the (often overlooked) importance of cation-size mismatch in solid solutions, in particular when the associated chemical disorder indirectly influences the electrical transport properties through distortions in the conductive network. The evolution of the thermal conductivity in the solid solutions is consistent with the evolution of the cation-size variance as the Cr/Mo and Cr/W solid-solutions show lower values than the corresponding pristine phases. This mainly originates from the increase in the electrical resistivity, maximised for the highest cation-size variance. Because the power factor had been significantly decreased by the perturbations in the conductive network, the lower thermal conductivity achieved in the solid solutions with the highest cation-size variance only compensates for the loss, with ZT remaining around 0.9 at 700 K.80

5. Stability and scalability
The excellent performances in processed-controlled, cost-efficient V–Sn colusite, Cu26V2Sn6S32, and in high power factor Cr–Ge colusite, Cu26Cr2Ge6S32, have led researchers to consider stability and scalability issues for practical purposes. An extensive investigation of the thermal stability of Cr–Ge colusite was carried out by Lemoine et al., with the combined objectives of defining the stability range for Cr–Ge colusite and exploring the possibility to induce process-controlled cationic disorder during sintering.115 Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction (NPD), the authors determined that Cr–Ge colusite was highly stable up to at least 700 K. Cycling electrical property measurements up to 700 K, including the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, show no sign of degradation of the power factor.115 However, superficial sulphur loss occurs above 760 K and decomposition of the colusite phase begins above 830 K with full decomposition above 930 K. Cycling electrical property measurements at a maximum temperature of 760 K clearly show a steady decrease of the charge carrier concentration caused by sulphur loss. Comparatively, while Cr–Ge colusite decomposes into ternary Cu–Ge–S and Cu–Cr–S phases in two steps at 830 and 880 K, the vanadium counterpart, Cu26V2Ge6S32, shows no sign of degradation and appears stable up to at least 1000 K.115 The lower temperature stability of Cr–Ge colusite is explained by the presence of Cr6+ in a tetrahedral sulphur environment, a structural feature observed, to the best of our knowledge, only in synthetic Cr–Ge colusite.78 The limited thermal stability of Cr–Ge colusite results in difficulties in obtaining process-controlled disorder by increasing the sintering temperature. An ultralow lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity, such as those observed in disordered group 5 colusites, combined with the particularly high power factor of Cr–Ge colusite would result in ZT values well above unity.
In terms of scalability, the feasibility of mechanochemical synthesis has been demonstrated for many sulphides and this choice of synthetic route is justified by its relatively easy application on a large scale.120 As mentioned in the previous sections, V–Sn colusite can be produced in relatively large batches, 200 g per milling cycle, using industrial grade precursors.93 An in-depth investigation of the large scale sintering of large monoliths of V–Sn colusite is currently ongoing. Finally, the production of industrial grade V–Sn colusite was recently achieved in an industrial eccentric vibratory ball mill.121
Finally, with the aim to consider colusites as p-type materials in thermoelectric devices, the determination of their mechanical properties is also an important point which was considered only by Bourgès et al. on V–Sn colusite.86 Chetty et al. reported the preparation and performances of a single thermoelectric element based on colusite Cu26Nb2Ge6S32.122 An Au metal layer was demonstrated to be a successful diffusion barrier, preventing Cu diffusion and ensuring a low specific contact resistance of 4–5 × 10−10 Ω m2.122 The maximum conversion efficiency of this single element was estimated to be ≈3.3% for a temperature gradient of 273 K (hot-side and cold-side kept at 570 and 297 K, respectively), for a predicted maximum of ≈4.5%.122
6. Concluding remarks and future prospects
Synthetic derivatives of the natural quaternary sulphide colusite have only been studied since 2014, though reaching thermoelectric performances on par with current state-of-the-art sulphides (Fig. 16). The cousin material tetrahedrite, incidentally identified as an excellent thermoelectric by the same research group 2 years earlier than colusite,13 has comparatively attracted significantly more attention. However, in a short time and comparatively fewer articles, colusite now exhibits similar thermoelectric performances. It is worth mentioning that, despite the absence of comparative studies of the mechanical properties between these two families of materials, it is generally accepted that colusite samples, when mechanically alloyed, are significantly less brittle and easier to cut. It is possible that colusite suffered from the early competition of tetrahedrite and was possibly influenced by its failed industrial experience. One critical factor against colusite is the extreme scarcity of natural samples, which undoubtedly excludes the use of re-processed natural minerals, as was suggested for the earth-abundant tetrahedrite and bornite.36,136 Nonetheless, we can be hopeful about the future of colusite with much remaining to be investigated, in particular with the prospects of combining the two successful approaches, process-controlled disorder and functionalisation of the conductive network. With this review, we hope that the peculiar transport properties of colusites will pique the interest of scientists inside and outside the thermoelectric community.
