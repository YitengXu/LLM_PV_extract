    , Accepted 17th March 2021First published on 18th March 2021AbstractSolar-driven interfacial evaporation has emerged as an innovative and sustainable technology for clean water production. The rational fabrication of monolithic three-dimensional (3D) steam generators has accordingly become a topic of growing interest. However, the existing porous and hydrophilic 3D scaffolds (aerogels, hydrogels and sponges/foams) are constructed via conventional processing techniques (sol–gel and template-assisted methods), which remain one of the main roadblocks toward mass and large-scale applications. Herein, a closed-cell 3D polymer foam is developed via a controlled gas-foaming technique and applied as a monolithic interfacial steam generator for the first time. Taking advantage of the numerous gas pockets separated by reticulated and hydrophilic nanofibers that are made from polymeric composites, the foam has ultralight weight, low thermal conductivity and efficient water diffusion. Gratifyingly, the device attains a high water evaporation rate of 2.7 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun and is among the best-performing interfacial steam generators reported to date and surpasses a majority of 3D sponges/foams used in solar evaporation applications. This work demonstrates one of the few interfacial steam generators that integrate a variety of intriguing properties (i.e., self-floating, light-to-heat conversion, structural durability, anti-overturning and anti-biofouling) into a monolithic polymer foam for high-performance solar evaporation in natural environments.
1. Introduction
Freshwater is the lifeblood of our planet. Except for the non-available freshwater stored in glaciers, permafrost and the ground, useable freshwater is incredibly rare on Earth (∼0.01% of all water). So far, human and environmental demands for freshwater have been outstripping the supply.1 Water scarcity has threatened an estimated two-thirds of the world's population at least one month of the year. Over 1.6 billion people are projected to face economic water shortage, which arises from a lack of water infrastructure and mismanagement of water use.2 Today, the most common steps for municipal water treatment still include typical coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. A wide range of emerging technologies such as membrane filtration, ultraviolet irradiation, advanced oxidation, ion-exchange and distillation have been screened and evaluated to deliver reliable, sustainable and potable clean water supply systems during the past few decades.3 However, their applications have been limited or they have been recently introduced to the water industry, leaving some questions unanswered, particularly about their operational cost, water treatment efficiency, large-scale applications and environmental assessments. Since drinking water sources become increasingly less available worldwide, pressure to do more with less has caused a rapid entry of sustainable and point-of-use technologies that are generally low-cost, low-maintenance, grid-independent and user-friendly.4
The Sun is an essential supplier of renewable energy for our planet. The recent development of interfacial solar evaporation, localized solar-to-thermal conversion and steam generation at a liquid/vapor interface has emerged as an innovative water treatment technology.5–11 As compared with traditional distillation technologies, interfacial solar evaporation has rapidly enhanced water evaporation rates approaching the theoretical upper limit (∼1.47 kg m−2 h−1) based on ambient solar intensity (i.e., ∼1000 W m−2) and required energy for liquid-to-vapor phase change (i.e., ∼2450 kJ kg−1). New strategies of environmental energy input and vaporization enthalpy recycling have further boosted water evaporation rates with photothermal efficiencies in excess of 100%.12–16 To date, the design of monolithic three-dimensional (3D) steam generators with self-contained properties has become a topic of growing interest.17–19 In this regard, lightweight, low-cost, and eco-friendly 3D material platforms such as aerogels, hydrogels and sponges/foams are highly desired for the demonstration of efficient solar evaporation, desalination, waste energy conversion and environmental stimuli response.20–37
Sol–gel and template-assisted techniques are widely used to fabricate a majority of 3D porous scaffolds as building blocks and monolithic devices for solar evaporation, taking advantage of their low structural damage to original structures and good recovery of the shape of rehydrated products.38–45 In a common sol–gel method, structural components are evenly dispersed in a dilute solvent, generating a homogeneous gel that consists of cross-linked networks via covalent and non-covalent bonds. Conventional dehydration processes (i.e., thermal drying, freeze-drying and supercritical drying) are used to remove all solvents and form porous 3D scaffolds.46 In a common template-assisted method, initial templates in the forms of aligned arrays (micro-/nano-tubes and wires) are introduced and hydrolyzed to form specific morphologies of porous 3D scaffolds.47 Despite the current progress, a few roadblocks still lie ahead for the state-of-the-art 3D scaffolds and processing techniques, which can be generalized as follows: (i) conventional processing methods often require high capital costs of sophisticated instruments, high energy costs and a lengthy process time; (ii) solvent crystal growth and template boundaries are non-controllable, inevitably generating imprecise morphologies, structural defects and reduced resistance against deformation; (iii) product sizes are limited by the capacity of containers, templates and vacuum chambers. Production efficiencies are decreased by necessary post-treatments; (iv) a majority of water-saturated aerogels and hydrogels are partially or fully immersed in water. The undesired direct contact with bulk water causes conductive heat losses and reduces water evaporation. These drawbacks have constrained the mass, energy-efficient and large-scale fabrication of 3D interfacial steam generators.
Apart from aerogels and hydrogels, polymer sponges/foams are another useful category of engineering materials that are widely used in many structural applications, which are generally fabricated via several gas-foaming approaches. Many thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers (i.e., polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane and so on) can be foamed via a wide variety of physical and chemical blowing agents.48 Open-cell and closed-cell structures are the two cell geometries that are generally found in polymer foams. Depending on the microcellular structures, the most important attributes of polymer sponges/foams are scalability, light weight, efficient thermal insulation, high strength/weight ratios and stiffening capabilities as compared to solid polymers.49–59 For the future design of interfacial steam generators, we believe that special emphasis can be placed on the development of expanded 3D scaffolds with controllable microstructures via ease-of-mold and template-free techniques.60–62 Although the fabrication of scalable polymer foams through direct gas-foaming methods shows great potential, a proof-of-concept has not been demonstrated for solar evaporation. In a monolithic polymer foam, material components and structural elements should be optimized to balance density, water evaporation, mechanical strength and thermal insulation with trade-offs in cost and size, yet causal links of such properties have not been established to date. The realization of shape-controlled polymer foams with “self-contained” functions (such as self-floating, high solar conversion, good structural durability, anti-overturning and anti-fouling properties) remains a great challenge for real-world solar evaporation on open water.
In this contribution, an all-polymeric and monolithic foam was developed via a modified gas-foaming technique (Fig. 1). Two-dimensional (2D) electrospun nanofibrous membranes were optimized by incorporating appropriate components of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and bis-phenol A (BPA) epoxy resins. The membranes were readily expanded to 3D foams without thermal treatment. The decomposition of foaming agents and bubble nucleation created closed-cell pores and truss structures in the polymeric matrix, providing high porosity and well-controlled shapes of the polymer foams. Numerous gas pockets in the foam dramatically reduced the density to 0.15 g cm−3 and the thermal conductivity to 0.19 W m−1 K−1 in a wet state, outperforming the values obtained from common aerogels and hydrogels. The nanofibrous walls of the closed cells formed by the hydrophilic polymers afforded efficient water retention and diffusion, superior mechanical strength and better anti-biofouling ability as compared to the neat PAN foam. Under one sun, the composite foam attained high water evaporation rates of 2.70 and 6.66 kg m−2 h−1 under calm and light air conditions respectively, and ranks among the best-performing interfacial steam generators reported to date. The systematic characterization of solar evaporation and desalination was performed under several realistic water conditions, which highlights the great potential of the 3D polymer foam for real-world applications. This work delivers a new intriguing approach to achieving high-performance, large-area, durable, anti-overturning and anti-biofouling solar evaporation by forming closed-cell polymer foams via a controlled gas-foaming technique.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Fabrication and characterization of 2D nanofibrous membranes
PAN was selected as one of the polymer components for the following reasons: (i) PAN is among the most resistant polymers to ultraviolet (UV) radiation; (ii) it features good chemical resistance to most solvents and acids; (iii) it is mechanically hard and thermal-insulating in the form of fibers. PAN fibers are generally produced via wet-spinning, gel-spinning and electrospinning techniques, which have been widely used for textiles, ultra-filtration membranes and high-quality carbon fibers. A reactive prepolymer of bis-phenol A (BPA) was cured with UV light and BPA epoxy resins were obtained as the second component. Its most important advantages are excellent adhesion, good chemical and heat resistance, and good mechanical and thermal-insulating properties. As illustrated in Fig. 2, liquid BPA oligomers, diluents, and small amounts of a photoinitiator (a cationic catalyst) were mixed into PAN solutions. PAN/BPA nanofibrous membranes were fabricated via electrospinning. The as-prepared membranes were immediately cured through UV gelation. During the UV illumination, the BPA oligomers rapidly underwent a catalytic homopolymerization, and the linear polymer chains tended to form a cross-linked network via numerous ether bridges. The loading of PAN and BPA epoxy resins was varied to screen and evaluate the ideal proportion of polymer components in the 2D nanofibrous membranes.

The membrane morphology, chemical components, wettability and mechanical properties were characterized to find an ideal 2D nanofibrous membrane for the gas-foaming process. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of the nanofibrous membranes are shown in Fig. 3a and S1, ESI†. After UV curing, all membranes were composed of bead-free, densely packed and randomly oriented nanofibers. The statistical distribution showed that the mean diameters of the nanofibers gradually increased from 162.8 nm to 638.2 nm when the content of BPA epoxy resins was increased in the 2D membranes (Fig. 3b, Table 1 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) presented the even distribution of C, N and O throughout the composite nanofibers, where N came from the nitrile groups of PAN and O from the ether bridges of BPA epoxy resins (Fig. 3c and S3, ESI†). The relative concentration in mass (wt%) of O showed a gradual increase with increasing loading of BPA epoxy resins, which presented one of the proofs that PAN and BPA epoxy resins were well-mixed in the polymer matrix (Table S1, ESI†). Chemical components were analyzed via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†). The neat PAN presented several characteristic signals, i.e., the peaks at 2940 cm−1, 2241 cm−1 and 1453 cm−1 corresponded to the C–H stretching vibrations of methylene, stretching vibrations of nitrile and C–H bending vibrations of methylene, respectively. For the PAN/BPA composite, characteristic peaks at 1168 cm−1 and 766 cm−1 were observed corresponding to the stretching vibrations of ether groups and benzene rings, respectively, implying that BPA epoxy resins were well-incorporated into the PAN matrix. Moreover, the surface wettability of the nanofibrous membranes was evaluated via water contact angle (CA) measurements (Fig. 3d and S5, ESI†). The PAN and PAN/BPA thin films that were directly spin-coated onto glass showed a small CA of 19–26° at 5 s, indicating that PAN and BPA epoxy resins featured similar hydrophilicity. In all nanofibrous membranes, water droplets were readily absorbed within 2 s, due to their good water wettability. The incorporation of BPA epoxy resins endowed the composite membranes with improved hydrophilicity, since a lower CA at 0.04 s was observed as compared to the neat PAN membrane (Table 1).

Tensile tests were carried out to characterize the mechanical properties of the nanofibrous membranes. Fig. 3e plots the tensile stress (σ) as a function of strain (ε) until failure. The maximum tensile strength and corresponding elongation at break are summarized in Fig. 3f and Table 1. All nanofibrous membranes showed limited elastic regions, where the linear σ–ε correlations rapidly turned into non-linear regions. The neat PAN membrane gave a low tensile strength of 1.2 MPa and the smallest elongation of only 17.3%. The incorporation of appropriate amounts of BPA epoxy resins boosted both the tensile strength and elongation, resulting in stronger and more ductile membranes. The PAN/BPA (1:1) membrane presented a maximum tensile strength of 2.2 MPa and elongation over 93%, which reveals its superior strength to withstand stretching before breaking as compared to other membranes. On the other hand, the higher proportions of BPA relative to PAN (1:1.5 and 1:2) decreased the strength and toughness of the composite membranes. As indicated in the SEM images, the relatively sparse networks of the nanofibers should become one of the key constraints for the mechanical strength of these membranes. Taking into account the properties discussed above, we decided to use the PAN/BPA (1:1) nanofibrous membrane for the fabrication of 3D foams.
2.2 Fabrication and characterization of 3D polymer foams
3D composite foams were prepared by using a modified gas-foaming protocol in solution.63–65 The process includes three steps: mold assembling, gas-foaming and blackening as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The 2D nanofibrous membrane (PAN:BPA = 1:1) was first tailored to an appropriate size and placed into a pillared mold. This customized mold controlled the shape and height of the 3D foam during the foaming process. Small amounts of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) powder were evenly spread on the top and bottom of the membrane. After covering with a lid with tiny holes, the mold was directly immersed into methanol. The alcoholysis of NaBH4 continuously generated H2 gas within the membrane. After ∼10 min, a pillared 3D foam was formed with a precisely controlled shape. A dramatic increase in the height (from hundreds of micrometers to several centimeters) was observed in the 2D membrane during gas-foaming. Finally, an ultra-black and water-soluble acrylic dye that is widely used in the artistic community was employed to color the foam via a simple soaking process. The 3D polymer foam can be directly used as an interfacial steam generator after gentle washing with water to remove the excess methanol and dye. This gas-foaming technique showed great potential for the scalable fabrication of polymer foams in an ease-of-mold method (ESI Video S1, ESI†). Impressively, a large-area 2D membrane (size: ∼19 cm × 11 cm) can be readily expanded to a 3D foam with an average height of ∼2.5 cm (Fig. 1), which can self-float on water and retain its regular shape for months. Fig. 4b illustrates the proposed mechanism of gas-foaming. When a dry 2D membrane was immersed into methanol, methanol molecules rapidly penetrated the multilayer structures within the membrane, and a softening phenomenon (similar to plasticization) occurred due to the reduced interaction between PAN/BPA interlayers. As indicated via additional tensile testing of the methanol-saturated membrane (PAN:BPA = 1:1), its maximum tensile strength decreased from 2.2 MPa to 1.7 MPa, while its elongation increased by ∼1.4 times as compared to the initial dry membrane (Fig. S6, ESI†). In the bubbling nucleation, the decomposition of NaBH4 continuously generated H2 gas and created numerous tiny bubbles within the layers of the membrane. The bubbles formed clusters to minimize the free energy and caused pore formation. The pores gradually grew due to the diffusion of the gas molecules into the pore nuclei. The softer multilayers in the methanol-saturated membrane enabled rearrangement via sheet slippage and deformation to adapt to the pore growth. During bubbling, capillary force continuously created clustering of pores and drove the cell walls to bind together, leading to the reticulated network of the 3D scaffold. We point out that PVA and BPA epoxy resins only served as structural elements in the 3D foams and neither of them reacted with any reagent. The phenomenon resembles the gas-foaming of several thermosetting polymers like polyurethane (PU), but the main advantage of our method is that no monomer, catalyst or thermal treatment is needed.
 Fig. 4  (a) A flow chart of the fabrication of a 3D polymer foam via the modified gas-foaming technique and (b) a schematic illustration of the bubbling process. 
The surface and interior morphologies of the 3D polymer foams were characterized. They featured largely wrinkled and bubble-like structures on the upper and longitudinal surfaces, as depicted in digital photographs and 3D laser scanning confocal microscope images (Fig. 5a and S7, ESI†). Isotropic morphologies were observed in the transverse and longitudinal cross sections of the 3D foam, where the numerous macropores were roughly spherical and separated from each other by thin layers of nanofibers (Fig. 5b and S7, ESI†). The 3D foam can be defined as a closed-cell foam with numerous pockets of trapped gas. The pockets were discrete, sealed from each other and fully surrounded by the nanofibrous walls with a thickness of several micrometers. It is noteworthy that the varied loading of the gas-foaming agent NaBH4 was able to modulate the microstructures of the 3D foams. Increasing the content of NaBH4 per unit area from 0.006 to 0.18 mol cm−2 tended to generate more bubbles in the 2D membrane per unit time, which dramatically resulted in loose 3D foams with a reduced thickness of the closed-cell walls (Fig. S8, ESI†). A statistical analysis via SEM measurements revealed that the wall thicknesses of the closed cells can be tuned from ∼14 μm to ∼0.7 μm, exhibiting good thickness modulation on a micrometer scale (Fig. 5c). As listed in Table 1, the closed-cell structures afforded an extremely low density of the foams (8.4–16.8 mg cm−3) in dry states, which was lower than the average value of common aerogels (∼20 mg cm−3) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The density of the water-saturated foams was compared with that of common hydrogels to highlight the merits of our design in the next section.

In order to further clarify the deformation resistance of the 3D foams, compressive experiments were performed via a high-precision mechanical testing system (Fig. S10, ESI†). Fig. 5d shows the compressive σ–ε characteristics of the water-saturated foams when compressed to 80% of the initial height. During compression, the PAN/BPA (1:1) foam afforded the maximum compressive strength, which was in good agreement with the above tensile tests (Table 1). Both stretching and compression disclose that the PAN/BPA (1:1) composite can serve as a more intensive framework as compared to other PAN/BPA composites and highlight its superior toughness and deformation resistance. Fig. 5e presents rapid water diffusion through the PAN/BPA (1:1) foam under capillary action. The pillared foam (height: ∼2 cm) showed no clear shrinkage or deformation in water. The colored water reached the top in a short time of ∼70 s. The dyed PAN/BPA (1:1) composite showed a broad absorptance of ∼94% in a wide wavelength region of 250–2500 nm, exhibiting strong absorption over the entire solar spectrum (Fig. 3g). The PAN/BPA (1:1) foam demonstrates several intriguing properties for solar-driven interfacial evaporation, including monolithic, easy fabrication, ultralight weight, good mechanical strength, water wettability and efficient sunlight absorption.
2.3 Solar evaporation under indoor conditions
The indoor evaporation measurements were conducted by using an artificial optical setup and following the protocols in our previous reports (AM 1.5 G, 1000 W m−2, at ∼27 °C and a humidity of ∼70%) (Fig. S11, ESI†).66,67 The 3D polymer foam (named SG4, diameter: ∼2.5 cm, and height: ∼2.2 cm) was characterized in parallel with other representative steam generators (named SG1, SG2 and SG3 with the same diameter of devices) and bare water (Fig. 6a). SG1 was an initial 2D nanofibrous membrane (PAN:BPA = 1:1) without gas-foaming, offering a so-called “direct contact” with water. In SG2, the 2D nanofibrous membrane (PAN:BPA = 1:1) was integrated with a hydrophobic and thermal-insulating polystyrene (PS) foam with an individual water channel, providing an “indirect contact” with water. SG3 was a 3D monolithic hydrogel formed via gelation from a gel of the PAN/BPA composite (PAN:BPA = 1:1). Under one sun, the surface temperature of SG1–SG4 rapidly reached steady states above 40 °C within ∼10 min (Fig. 6b). Without light-to-heat localization, the surface temperature of bare water only gently increased to 35.6 °C. The water beneath SG1 and SG3 showed evident temperature increases (over 9 °C) relative to the initial ambient temperature, owing to a lack of thermal-insulating design in both devices. On the other hand, clear temperature gradients were observed in SG2 and SG4. Negligible temperature variations of ∼4 °C were recorded in water below both SG2 and SG4, indicating that the light-to-heat conversion was confined on the solar absorber and conduction heat losses were efficiently suppressed. SG4 presented a comparable heat loss with SG2 that was integrated with a conventional PS foam, highlighting the outstanding thermal insulation of the closed-cell structure of SG4. Water evaporation rates were measured by recording the mass changes of water over 60 min. The clear sharp declines of water mass revealed the faster water evaporation of SG4 in comparison to other devices and bare water (Fig. 6c). As summarized in Fig. 6d, SG4 attained a high water evaporation rate of 2.70 kg m−2 h−1, which is nearly two-fold higher than that of SG3 (1.46 kg m−2 h−1), and significantly surpassed the performance of SG1 and SG2.

In order to explain the merits of the structural design of SG4, the interior morphology, wet density, water retention and thermal conductivity of SG3 and SG4 were compared (Fig. 6e). Both SG3 and SG4 were constructed with the same PAN:BPA (1:1) composite, showing 3D monolithic structures. However, distinct processing methods clearly differentiated the cross-sectional morphology of SG3 and SG4. After gelation and freeze-drying, SG3 afforded a typical morphology that is observed for PAN hydrogels, where oriented sheet-like and open-cell structures with macropores were formed (Fig. S12, ESI†). During solar evaporation, the denser network of SG3 acted as a water channel and was fully imbibed with water. On the other hand, homogeneous distribution of macropores with closed cells was generated in SG4. Water can be effectively transferred through the fibrous walls of discrete gas pockets and a majority of SG4 was isolated above water. This should be one of the key factors that largely differentiated the density of SG3 and SG4 in their water-saturated states. As measured via a high-precision foam density tester, the wet density of SG3 was 0.78 g cm−3, whereas SG4 showed a lower wet density of 0.15 g cm−3. It is worth mentioning that, the wet density of SG4 is even comparable to the common density of dry aerogels (0.003–0.500 g cm−3), which highlights the ultralight weight of SG4.
Furthermore, water diffusion in SG3 and SG4 was characterized. The colored water can reach the top of SG4 in a short time of ∼70 s, where the hydrophilic walls of numerous closed-cells and relatively looser 3D scaffold can serve as rapid water channels. The denser networks of SG3 slowed down the water diffusion, and it required ∼146 s for water to transport to its upper surface (both samples had a similar height of ∼1.5 cm) (Fig. S13, ESI†). Taking into account the thermal insulation, the dry SG3 sponge with open cells featured an isotropic thermal conductivity of ∼0.3 W m−1 K−1. The closed-cell structures of SG4 significantly lowered the thermal conductivity to ∼0.19 W m−1 K−1, which can be explained by the low conductivity of the gas (∼0.17 W m−1 K−1 for H2 and ∼0.024 W m−1 K−1 for air) that was trapped in the gas pockets of SG4 (Section 17, Fig. S14, ESI†). An analysis of energy balance and heat-loss pathways was performed to determine the correlations between the performance and device architecture (Section 18, Fig. S15, ESI†). SG3 and SG4 exhibited negligible radiation losses (∼3.1% and ∼1.7%) and convection losses (∼1.7% and ∼1.25%), respectively. The partial immersion of SG3 evidently causes its conduction loss over ∼14%, nearly three-fold higher than that of SG4 (∼5.1%). On the other hand, the good self-floating and water-isolating behavior and lower thermal conductivity of SG4 can suppress the conduction loss to below ∼6%. In brief, the gas-filled and closed-cell geometry of SG4 is demonstrated to generate a lower wet density, faster water transport, larger water/air interface area and lower heat loss, all of which synergistically contributed to its superior water evaporation rate. The evaporation performance of SG4 is among those of the best-performing interfacial steam generators reported so far. Specifically, the water evaporation rate of SG4 surpasses those of a majority of devices using PAN as the material component in electrospun membranes, aerogels and hydrogels (Fig. 6f and Table S2, ESI†). It also presents one of the highest values among the devices constructed with 3D sponges/foams that are based on natural and synthetic polymers (Fig. 6g and Table S3, ESI†).
2.4 Solar evaporation under realistic conditions
In order to assess the water evaporation of SG4 in realistic situations, several environmental factors such as light/dark response, operating time, water conditions and air velocity were taken into account. Owing to intermittent cloud cover and day/night cycles, the intensity of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface varies during the day. Considering this, water evaporation of SG4 was characterized under alternating light-on/light-off switching with an intertrial interval of 30 min (Fig. 7a). When the light was switched on, the surface temperature of SG4 was boosted over 40 °C under one sun. When the light was turned off, the surface temperature of SG4 rapidly decreased to room temperature (∼26 °C). The average evaporation rate of ∼2.63 kg m−2 h−1 during the tests of five cycles indicates the rapid performance response of SG4. Fig. 7b plots the long-term evaporation performance of SG4. When SG4 was continuously illuminated under one sun over 5 h, the average evaporation rate was calculated to be ∼2.69 kg m−2 h−1, which retained the initial value of the first 60 min. This is an indication of the good long-term performance of SG4 for reliable clean water production.

Several harsh water conditions that can be found in stormwater, seawater, household and industrial sewage were also considered (Fig. 7c). First, water evaporation of SG4 was examined by using wastewater with a broad pH region of 1–13 that covered a majority of acid rain, domestic and industrial wastewater (Fig. S16, ESI†). SG4 exhibited negligible shrinkage and swelling and gave steady water evaporation rates within a range of 2.5–2.9 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. This discloses that SG4 can retain evaporation performance and resist deformation under a variety of acidic and alkaline conditions. Furthermore, solar desalination was conducted by placing SG4 on bodies of brine. In nature, the vast majority of seawater shows a salinity of 31–38 g kg−1. Lagoons and hypersaline lakes have a higher salinity of 44–433 g kg−1. Encouragingly, SG4 can afford comparable water evaporation rates in several brine solutions (salinity: 35 g kg−1 and 150 g kg−1) to the value recorded in freshwater (over 2.6 kg m−2 h−1), and no salt sediment appeared during continuous illumination over 2 h. When the salinity of brine was as high as 250 g kg−1, an average water evaporation rate of over ∼2.0 kg m−2 h−1 was retained in SG4 (Fig. S17, ESI†). These results highlight one of the unique attributes of solar desalination of hypersaline brine.
Apart from pH and salinity in water, air flow over water is another critical environmental stimulus. To date, a systematic study on how it affects solar evaporation is still beyond reach.37,68 In this study, we evaluated the water evaporation of SG4 under varied air velocity by employing a mechanically forced air flow. In this case, the air flow swept away more airborne water molecules in the air, allowing surface water to evaporate more freely. Enhanced water evaporation was confirmed by the precipitous declines of the water mass under breeze conditions as compared with the corresponding calm states (Fig. 7d). As summarized in Fig. 7e, SG4 attained higher water evaporation rates of 5.65 kg m−2 h−1 at a light breeze of 2 m s−1 and 6.66 kg m−2 h−1 at a gentle breeze of 4 m s−1 under one sun. With the forced convection, SG4 afforded high water evaporation rates of 3.01 kg m−2 h−1 at 4 m s−1 in the dark, surpassing the value of 2.70 kg m−2 h−1 obtained under one sun and calm conditions. These results provide the second proof of efficient water diffusion in SG4 under enhanced air convection and disclose the potential of using conventional ventilation to scale-up clean water production irrespective of the alternation of night and day.
Outdoor solar desalination was carried out throughout the daytime. The local solar elevation angle was 12° at 8:00, and then rose to a maximum angle of 73° at 14:00, and fell to 11° at 20:00 in late September (Fig. S18a, ESI†). The time-dependent mass changes of water were monitored together with solar intensity (Fig. S18b, ESI†). In a closed and transparent chamber, the total output of clean water was ∼4.4 kg m−2 during the day. To some extent, the yield of clean water was limited by the nearly airtight container that prevented air convection. So far, a majority of large-scale setups for outdoor solar evaporation fail to take into account the benefits of natural ventilation. We suggest that more attention should be paid to efficient latent heat recovery and vapor condensation in the future development of single-stage solar evaporation systems. After desalination, the salinity of water significantly reduced from 33.00‰ to 0.010‰, and the corresponding total dissolved solids (TDS) decreased from 48500 mg L−1 to 20 mg L−1 (Fig. S19, ESI†). Both the salinity and TDS of the purified water were below the limit given by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Standards for Drinking Water Quality in China.
Water waves are another environmental stimulus for solar-driven interfacial evaporation. It would be highly desirable if next-generation interfacial steam generators could resist capsizing and sustain stable clean water production in common water waves with low frequencies in a range of 0.05–10 Hz. It is noted that related studies have been largely neglected so far. In this study, capsizing tests were performed by recording the anti-overturning process of the polymer foam (ESI Video S2, ESI†). Owing to its ultralight weight in water, the polymer foam can keep its right orientation under a moderate frequency of water waves (∼0.5 Hz) over time, demonstrating its good anti-overturning properties. In this case, the polymer foam is able to keep continuous solar energy conversion and vapor release, irrespective of water waves on open water.
For potential outdoor applications on open water (reservoirs, brine lakes, pit lakes and sewage pools), biofouling and biocorrosion are ubiquitous and unavoidable on the wetted surfaces of interfacial steam generators. The accumulation of various organisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, plants and so on) is able to cause structural deficiencies, degrading the device performance and shortening the lifetime expectancy. Therefore, an emerging concept of introducing “anti-biofouling” functions into interfacial steam generators has become a topic of growing interest.69–73 In this study, biofouling experiments were conducted to assess the anti-biofouling efficacy of the 3D polymer foams via a set of techniques. PAN and PAN/BPA (1:1) foams were immersed in natural water for two weeks and thereafter dispersed in buffer solutions. The population of bacterial cells was counted and expressed as a number of cells per unit of volume via a flow cytometry analyzer. In this technique, bacterial cells were stained with an asymmetrical cyanine dye (SYBR green I, which binds to the DNA of cells and emits green light) and passed through a flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser. The flow cytometric results are shown in 2D dot-plots in Fig. 7g. Each red dot in the cluster represents a bacterial cell from the foam, while the x- and y-axes present the corresponding intensity of side scatter and green fluorescence of the cell, respectively. As summarized in Fig. 7h, the bacteria on the surface of the PAN/BPA (1:1) foam were significantly lower by ∼3.7 fold on average (t-test, p < 0.01) as compared to that on the neat PAN foam, demonstrating the superior anti-biofouling ability of the PAN/BPA foam.
In order to exclude the morphological impacts of the foams and provide deep insights into the intrinsic biofouling of the materials, biofouling tests of the PAN and PAN/BPA (1:1) films were also conducted. In this method, PAN and PAN/BPA films were spin-coated on sterile glass (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) and were immersed in natural water. After two weeks, the films were stained with SYBR Green I and observed via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Fig. 7i shows the CLSM images (200 μm × 200 μm) and the distribution of bacterial cells on the films. The PAN/BPA (1:1) film presented low bacterial abundance, and only single cells with small clusters were observed. On the other hand, more cells with bigger clusters were found on the PAN film. The bacterial abundance and surface coverage of biofilms on the PAN/BPA (1:1) film were lower by ∼1.4 and ∼2.7 fold on average (t-test, p < 0.01) in comparison with the PAN film, respectively (Fig. 7j). The results provide the second proof of the superior anti-biofouling ability of the PAN/BPA foams.
It is noted that PAN has been widely used as fibers in filtration membranes, fiber-reinforced composites, textiles and precursors for carbon fibers, while BPA epoxy resins have a variety of applications in water pipes, flooring, marine coating and the automotive sector. Based on current scientific understanding, most applications and objects using these two polymers pose no risk to human health and the environment. In addition, PAN and BPA epoxy resins are not biocompatible. Therefore, we suggest that the specific surface area played one of the key roles in the different biofouling activities of the two foams. As indicated via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (Fig. S20, ESI†), the multipoint BET surface areas of the PAN and PAN/BPA (1:1) membranes were calculated to be ∼2.73 m2 g−1 and ∼0.70 m2 g−1, respectively. This is in good agreement with the SEM characteristics of these 2D membranes, where the larger mean diameter of the PAN/BPA (1:1) nanofibers tended to reduce the total surface area per unit of mass, and leave smaller wetted surfaces for the accumulation of organisms as compared to the PAN membrane. Since BPA is a key constituent of epoxy resins, the potential emission of BPA during the life cycles of epoxy resins could act as a biocide on the surfaces of the composite membrane, which would be other causes of anti-biofouling. However, there is still debate on the environmental toxicity of BPA in aquatic ecosystems. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has demonstrated that BPA does not accumulate in aquatic organisms to any appreciable extent and is not classified as bioaccumulative. The current manufacturing and use patterns of BPA pose virtually no risk to the environment.
The durability is also a critical parameter to assess the interfacial steam generators for real-environment applications. After soaking in natural water for two weeks, the 3D pillared shape of the neat PAN foam showed an evident structural disintegration. On the other hand, the PAN/BPA (1:1) foams can keep their 3D shape, showing no signs of shrinkage or swelling over three months. A small part cut from the foam (diameter: ∼2.5 cm; height: ∼2.3 cm) can retain a water evaporation rate of ∼2.6 kg m−2 h−1 as high as the initial value of the first hour (Fig. S21 and S22, ESI†). In addition, the PAN/BPA (1:1) foams showed no evident structural deformation and leakage of the black dye when soaked under several harsh conditions (warm, acidic and alkaline water) over 48 h (Fig. S23, ESI†). We infer that the ultra-black dye based on acrylic compounds enabled physical interactions with PAN and BPA epoxy resins via non-covalent bonds. These results demonstrate that the use of non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable PAN and BPA epoxy resins endowed the polymer foam with good performance stability and structural durability against biofouling, biodegradation and physical damage from water waves, and highlight its potential for stable long-term operation in natural water.
3. Conclusion
In summary, a monolithic 3D interfacial steam generator with closed-cell structures was successfully fabricated via a controllable gas-foaming technique and demonstrated for high-performance solar-driven water evaporation and desalination. Numerous gas pockets separated by the reticulated hydrophilic nanofibers of PAN and BPA epoxy resins delivered several unique merits of our design, which are rationalized as follows: (i) the gas-foaming method in solution rapidly created highly porous and primarily closed-pore structures, endowing the polymer foam with ultra-light weight, low thermal conductivity, self-floating and anti-overturning ability in water; (ii) the cross-linked all-polymeric networks significantly enhanced the mechanical strength, toughness and resistance against deformation and retained the hydrophilicity and water retention of the foam; (iii) the non-biocompatible PAN and BPA epoxy resins endowed the composite foam with structural stability against biofouling and biodegradation in natural water; (iv) the 3D foam enables synergistic management of the solar absorption, buoyancy, water diffusion, thermal localization and environmental energy input in a single monolithic design. As a result, high water evaporation rates of 2.70 kg m−2h−1 under calm conditions and 6.66 kg m−2h−1 at a gentle breeze of 4 m s−1 were attained, ranking among the best-performing solar-driven steam generators reported so far. Specifically, the device surpasses a majority of interfacial steam generators using ether PAN as the material component or porous 3D scaffolds as structural elements. This work highlights the great potential of using a gas-foaming strategy to fabricate large-scale polymer foams for self-floating, durable, anti-overturning and self-cleaning steam generators that allow facile scale-up of clean water production in a variety of natural environments.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Fabrication of 2D nanofibrous membranes
PAN solutions (12 wt%) were first prepared by dissolving solid PAN (1.19 g) in DMF (10.0 mL) and stirring at 60 °C for 12 h. After that, the PAN solutions were mixed with different amounts of BPA prepolymers, delivering six spinning solutions (12 wt%) with varied PAN/BPA weight ratios (1:0, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2). 2D nanofibrous membranes were fabricated by using a standard electrospinning machine equipped with a rotating drum collector. The spinning solution was placed into a 10 mL plastic syringe with a metal needle (inner diameter: 0.5 mm). The syringe was fixed on a digitally controlled syringe pump and a flow rate of 1 mL h−1 was maintained. Electrospinning was performed with an applied voltage of 18 kV at room temperature (∼27 °C) and low humidity (∼20%). The distance from the jet needle tip to the collector was ∼14 cm. The generated nanofibers were collected via a rotating drum with a rotational speed of ∼80 rpm. The obtained 2D nanofibrous membranes were dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight.
4.2 Fabrication of 3D foams via gas-foaming
For the fabrication of small-scale 3D foams (diameter: ∼2.5 cm), a cylindrical mold was used to have a proper height control (∼2.2 cm) of the foam. Numerous tiny holes were made on top of the lid to release gas, while the bottom of the mold had a circular groove. The as-prepared membrane was then tailored to a circle, placed in the groove and covered with small amounts of NaBH4 particles. After that, the mold was fully immersed in methanol and the gas-foaming process was triggered. A methanolysis reaction was carried out in the polymer matrix:NaBH4 + 4CH3OH → NaB(OCH3)4 + 4H2
A pillared foam was obtained after 10 min. It was then blackened by using a black dye via a simple soaking process for another 10 min in water. Finally, the 3D foam was rinsed with deionized water and air-dried for further characterization. No mold was used to fabricate large-area 3D foams (size: ∼19 cm × 11 cm and height: ∼2.5 cm).
4.3 Evaporation measurements
Indoor water evaporation experiments were conducted by using an artificial optical system at room temperature of ∼27 °C and humidity of ∼70%. A xenon lamp (CEL-S500, Ceaulight) equipped an AM1.5 G optical filter was used as the light source. The solar flux was calibrated using a thermopile connected to a power meter (CEL-NP2000, CEAULIGHT). The mass change of water was real-time monitored by using a high-precision electronic balance (QUINTIX224-1CN, Sartorius, accuracy: 0.1 mg) and transmitted to a computer. The temperature distribution of devices was monitored by using an IR camera (223s-L19, Fotric Precision Instruments) and k-type thermocouples. A hand-held anemometer (AR866A, Smart sensor) was used to measure air velocity. Outdoor water evaporation experiments were conducted during 8:00–20:00 in late September at the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China.
4.4 Anti-biofouling characterization
All polymer foams and films were immersed in a pond for two weeks. For the flow cytometer measurements, the foams were washed three times via phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions to remove loose contamination. Triplicate samples were randomly cut from the PAN and PAN/BPA foams using a sterile scalpel with the same volume. Each sample was then placed into an autoclaved tube with 10 mL PBS and sonicated for 10 min to detach the bacterial cells from the sample. To quantify the bacterial concentration, 0.9 mL of PBS with suspended bacterial cells were subsampled and stained with 0.2% SYBR green I (Solarbio) in the dark and at 37 °C for 60 min.74 The enumeration of bacteria was performed using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser (488 nm) at a low flow rate of 30 μl min−1 for 2 min. The bacterial concentration was determined with CytExpert software by using a bivariate cytogram of side scattering versus green fluorescence, which can be used as a proxy for cell size and DNA content, respectively.
For the CLSM measurements, the films were washed three times via PBS solutions to remove loose contamination, and then stained with 0.2% SYBR Green I (Solarbio) in the dark and 37 °C for 20 min. The examination of stained biofilms was performed by using a Nikon A1 CLSM equipped with an argon laser (488 nm) for excitation. The CLSM images were acquired in multi-track mode and quantitative parameters were analyzed by using ImageJ software.
