    , Accepted 11th September 2019First published on 12th September 2019AbstractThe high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, poor photocorrosion stability, and the discrepancy between the optical absorption length and charge collection efficiency of cupric oxide (CuO) are the main limiting factors of visible-light-driven CuO photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel thin CuO film photocatalyst on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate with low back contact resistivity, high charge collection efficiency, high optical absorption, and high photocorrosion stability for hydrogen production and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. This photocatalyst was fabricated by incorporating palladium (Pd) nanostructures into CuO to form a CuO:Pd light trapping thin film. The CuO:Pd light trapping thin film was then sandwiched between a nitrogen doped cupric oxide [CuO(N)] hole transporting layer and a CuO capping layer [CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO]. The performance of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocatalyst is further improved by incorporating a ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer, and decorating with a AuPd co-catalyst. Moreover, we demonstrate a significant improvement of photocorrosion stability and photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 photocatalyst through plasma assisted in situ nano-crystal engineering of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer. The fabricated novel photocatalyst could retain 95% of the initial photocurrent density after 6 hours of standard illumination with solar light and could give a record high photocurrent density of ∼8 mA cm−2 for the CuO photocatalyst.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen under solar light illumination is a sustainable and efficient strategy for large scale conversion and storage of solar energy which could potentially meet the growing global energy demand.1–7 A PEC water splitting cell requires an optical absorbing semiconductor to form a semiconducting material/electrolyte junction for generating a photovoltage to drive a redox reaction.8–11 Copper oxide is one of the most promising candidates for visible light driven hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants due to its low fabrication cost, optimal optical bandgap, and high optical absorption, as well as the abundance of the raw material in the Earth's crust.12–19 Copper oxide has two semiconducting phases: cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and cupric oxide (CuO). Cu2O is a direct gap semiconductor with an optical bandgap energy of ∼2 eV and a theoretically predicted photocurrent density of 14.7 mA cm−2.20,21 On the other hand, CuO is an indirect gap semiconductor with an ideal bandgap energy of ∼1.6 eV and a high theoretical photocurrent density of 35 mA cm−2.22–25 Despite intensive research on the Cu2O photocathode, few research efforts have been made to improve the performance of the CuO photocathode for hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.26–38
One of the fundamental limitations of the CuO photocatalyst is the discrepancy between the optical absorption length (∼500 nm) and charge collection length (∼200 nm).30–33 This factor significantly increases the carrier recombination rate and seriously impacts the generated photocurrent. Increasing the average light path length inside the optical absorber layer and effectively trapping the light by incorporation of noble metals into the optical absorption layer was demonstrated as an efficient way to enhance the optical absorption in thin film solar cells.39–43 Therefore, this method can be used to eliminate the discrepancy between the carrier diffusion length and optimum optical absorption depth of the CuO photocatalyst. Au, Ag, and Pd nanostructures are widely used to enhance light trapping in photovoltaic devices.44–50 However, Ag can be easily oxidized during the thermal treatment and Au has high interband losses at shorter wavelengths in the visible range.51,52 Since thermal treatment of CuO and enhancing the optical absorption of CuO at visible wavelengths are the two key factors for fabricating high performance CuO photovoltaic devices,53–58 incorporation of Ag and Au may not help us to prepare an efficient visible light driven CuO photocatalyst. Pd nanostructures were demonstrated as an efficient noble metal to boost the optical properties and photocatalytic activity.59,60 Therefore, incorporation of Pd nanostructures into CuO thin film may address the discrepancy between the optical absorption depth and carrier diffusion length and improve the photocatalytic activity and performance of the fabricated CuO photocathodes.
High interface recombination between the deposited thin CuO film and the conductive substrate is another important factor accounting for the poor performance of thin CuO film photocatalysts. Poor photocorrosion stability and the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs are two other main limiting factors of CuO photocatalysts that significantly restrict their practical application on a large scale.61–66
In this paper, we demonstrate that incorporating Pd nanostructures into thin CuO film can significantly improve optical absorption over a broad optical spectrum and address the issue that is caused by the discrepancy between the optical absorption length and charge collection efficiency. By controlling the size of Pd nanostructures and their distribution, we could significantly improve the quantum efficiency of the prepared samples. We also show that inserting a hole transporting CuO(N) layer between an FTO coated glass substrate and CuO:Pd light trapping thin film can significantly reduce the recombination losses between CuO:Pd and the conducting substrate and increase the charge collection efficiency (electron–hole pair separation efficiency), which in turn results in the improvement of photocorrosion stability and photocatalytic activity. Moreover, by adding a CuO capping layer on top of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd layer, we could reduce the optical reflectance and improve the generated photocurrent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by covering the CuO photocathode with a heterostructure of ZnO buffer layer–TiO2 protective layer and nano-crystal engineering the ZnO–TiO2 heterostructure layers through in situ plasma treatment, the photocorrosion stability and performance of the fabricated photocathodes can also be significantly improved.
2. Materials and methods
A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) covered borosilicate float glass substrate was used in our experiment. All substrates were ultrasonicated in isopropyl alcohol and deionized water for 5 and 10 minutes, respectively. The samples were then dried by blowing nitrogen gas before loading them into the sputtering chamber. Stoichiometric CuO, ZnO, and TiO2, as well as pure Pd targets, were used for thin film deposition. Argon (Ar) and nitrogen reactive gases were used for deposition. Incorporation of nitrogen into CuO was done by using the Ar and N reactant gases during the deposition of CuO. Pd nanostructures were incorporated into CuO to form CuO:Pd through simultaneously sputtering CuO and Pd. Before depositing ZnO and TiO2 thin films, the samples were rapidly thermally treated at 550 °C for 1 minute. CuO, ZnO, and TiO2 were deposited at room temperature and a fixed radio frequency (RF) power of 300 W. Pd was deposited at varied direct current (DC) sputtering power in the range of 0 to 50 W. The in situ plasma treatment power of the substrate was changed from 0 to 50 W during sputtering the ZnO and TiO2.
A light source of AM 1.5 G and 100 mW cm−2, a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution with a pH value of 5.84, and an Autolab 302N galvanostat/potentiostat with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and Pt counter electrode were used to measure the characteristics of the samples. The dark current and photocurrent of the samples were measured through performing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements at a potential of 0 VRHE and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Photocorrosion stability tests were performed under continuous illumination at 0 VRHE.
EIS measurement was used to derive the Nyquist plots by applying a 10 mV AC signal under open-circuit potential conditions over a frequency ranging from 1 mHz to 100 kHz. Before all PEC measurements, Ar gas was bubbled for 1 hour through the system to prevent the reduction of oxygen instead of the production of H2 as the dominant cathodic reaction.
A double-beam Shimadzu UV-3101 UV-vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical transmittance and absorption of the fabricated samples. The interfacial and microstructural properties of the fabricated samples were investigated using a high-resolution Philips CM300 TEM system, while the surface chemical composition was analyzed using a VG ESCALAB 220i-XL XPS system with a monochromatic AlKα source (1486.6 eV). A Bruker AXS General Area Detector Diffraction System (GADDS) in a θ–2θ scan with CuKα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation was used to measure the XRD spectra of the samples.
The photocatalytic degradation experiments (methylene blue (MB) degradation) were the same as those in our previous publication.67 To measure the MB photocatalytic degradation, the samples were placed at the bottom of a beaker and 20 mL of 10.0 mg L−1 MB solution was added. The beaker was placed on a shaker (50 rpm, ambient temperature) for 30 minutes under light off conditions. For the photocatalytic experiments, a 150 W xenon arc lamp equipped with an air mass of 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) was used as the light source. After photocatalytic degradation for the required duration, 2 mL from each experiment was sampled and the MB concentrations were analyzed. Eqn (1) was used to determine the MB photocatalytic degradation (%) in aqueous solution: (1)where C0 is the initial MB concentration and Ct is the MB concentration in the solution after time t. The initial concentration of MB was 10.0 ppm and the reaction was performed at constant temperature (ambient temperature). The kinetics of MB photocatalytic degradation by different samples was studied by using the pseudo-first-order model: (2)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Palladium incorporated CuO (CuO:Pd) photocathode
To incorporate Pd nanostructures into thin CuO film, Pd and CuO were simultaneously sputter deposited onto the substrate from a pure Pd target and stoichiometric CuO target. Fabrication details of the prepared samples are presented in the experimental part of the paper. In brief, CuO was sputter deposited at a fixed sputtering power of 300 W, while the Pd sputtering power was varied from 0 to 50 W to tune the size and distribution of Pd nanostructures. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of the prepared CuO:Pd samples are shown in Fig. 1. The thickness of the prepared CuO:Pd samples was set to around 200 nm, which is similar to the reported carrier diffusion length of CuO thin film. The HR-TEM images of the prepared samples show formation of uniform Pd nanostructures across the thin film with Pd diameter sizes ranging from around 5 nm for CuO:Pd samples deposited at a Pd sputtering power of 5 W to around 14 nm for CuO:Pd samples deposited at a Pd sputtering power of 50 W. Furthermore, it was found that increasing the Pd sputtering power enhances the distribution density of randomly distributed Pd nanostructures. To better underpin the enhanced crystal size of Pd with increasing sputtering power, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode was performed. Fig. S1† shows the EDX elemental mapping images of Pd nanostructures of CuO:Pd samples prepared at Pd sputtering power of 5 to 50 W. As shown here, the size and distribution of Pd nanostructures are influenced by the Pd sputtering power.

The impact of the incorporation of Pd nanostructures on the crystallinity of the prepared CuO:Pd thin films was investigated by measuring the XRD spectra of the prepared samples. Fig. S2a† shows the XRD spectra of the CuO:Pd thin films. The XRD peaks of the substrate were eliminated for better illustration of CuO and Pd XRD peaks. The XRD peaks at 35.482, 38.764, and 40.119 correspond to CuO(002), CuO(111), and Pd(111), respectively [(JCPDS# 05-0661) and (JCPDS# 7440-05-3)]. After deconvolving the CuO(111) and Pd(111) peaks, the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Pd(111) peak was determined and the results are presented in Fig. S2b.† The FWHM of the Pd(111) peak is decreased from 3.2 to 1.2 degrees upon increasing the Pd sputtering power from 5 to 50 W, indicating the enhancement of the crystal size of Pd nanostructures. As also shown here, there is no trace of palladium oxide in the XRD spectra.
Photoluminescence is a sensitive and non-destructive technique to investigate the defects and electronic properties of materials. An excitation wavelength of 240 nm was used to measure the photoluminescence of the samples. In Fig. S3 of the ESI,† the photoluminescence of CuO:Pd prepared at a CuO sputtering power of 300 W and Pd sputtering power of 0, 5, and 50 W is presented. As shown here, upon increasing the Pd sputtering power, the intensity of photoluminescence of the CuO:Pd samples increases. The main photoluminescence emission peak was located at 532 nm (2.33 eV), which is far from the optical bandgap of ∼1.6 eV of CuO:Pd thin films, indicating that the emission may have originated from electron transitions between the defect levels and the conduction/valence band or between the defect levels in the forbidden band.68,69
To illustrate the effect of incorporating Pd nanostructures on the performance of the CuO based photocathodes, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) current–voltage characteristics of the prepared CuO:Pd photocathodes were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 2 shows the current density of CuO:Pd photocathodes vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under standard light on (Jphoto) and light off (Jdark) conditions. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, although the produced Jphoto of the CuO:Pd photocathodes is significantly higher than that of the control CuO photocathode, Jdark of the CuO:Pd photocathodes is also higher. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the size and distribution of Pd nanostructures and efficient photocatalytic activity. We investigated the real impact of the incorporation of Pd nanostructures on the produced current density of the CuO:Pd photocathodes, and the plots of Jphoto–Jdarkvs. RHE are presented in Fig. 2c. Upon increasing the Pd sputtering power from 5 to 30 W, Jphoto–Jdark of the CuO:Pd photocathodes is significantly increased. However, upon further increasing the Pd sputtering power to 50 W, the enhancement of Jdark offsets the improvement of Jphoto, resulting in a reduction in Jphoto–Jdark. To investigate the origin of the improvement of photocurrent of the prepared CuO:Pd photocathodes, a series of experiments were conducted.

The impact of size and distribution of Pd nanostructures on the optical absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance of the prepared CuO:Pd samples is presented in Fig. 3. Upon incorporating Pd nanostructures, the optical transmittance of the CuO:Pd samples is significantly reduced while the optical reflectance of the samples is slightly increased at wavelengths above 400 nm, resulting in a substantial improvement of the optical absorption of CuO:Pd thin films. The improvement of optical absorbance upon increasing the size and aggregation of Pd nanostructures is mainly due to the enhancement of light trapping and enabling of large scattering of incident light into the absorber layer.70,71 As a result, the average light path length inside the CuO optical absorber layer is increased and the electron–hole pair separation within the carrier diffusion length of CuO is enhanced, which in turn improves the photocurrent of the CuO:Pd photocathodes.

IPCE is an indication of the light-harvesting capacity of the prepared photocathodes over the measured wavelength range. IPCE measurement at 0 V versus RHE under standard solar spectrum (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) was carried out for each of the CuO:Pd photocathodes and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4. The IPCE spectrum of aluminum doped CuO (CuO(Al)) from ref. 38 is also presented for comparison. The IPCE spectra of the photocathodes show that all photocathodes were able to absorb light and separate the resulting exciton to generate a photocurrent over a wide range of wavelengths. The IPCE at wavelengths ranging from 350 to 700 nm is significantly increased after incorporating Pd nanostructures into the CuO thin film. The maximum IPCE of CuO is 6% while for the CuO:Pd photocathode prepared at a Pd sputtering power of 30 W the maximum IPCE reaches 36%. To our knowledge, this is the first time an obvious IPCE improvement has been observed in CuO based photocathodes due to the enhancement of optical absorbance through incorporating metal nanostructures. In previous studies, metals were mainly used as dopants for incorporation into CuO to improve the resistivity or photocorrosion stability of the prepared photocathodes.30,31,63
 Fig. 4  IPCE of CuO:Pd photocathodes fabricated with Pd sputtering power of 0–50 W. A high Jsc of ∼4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE was achieved for the photocathode with a Pd sputtering power of 30 W. The IPCE of the best performing CuO:Pd photocathode at 0 VRHE is above 40% in the 450–675 nm wavelength range. The IPCE of the best performing aluminum doped CuO (CuO:Al) is also provided for comparison.30 
To further investigate the conductivity of the prepared samples at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE, kinetics of the oxidation process at the surface of the CuO:Pd photocathodes and interfacial charge transfer between the photocathodes and electrolyte, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plot of the prepared CuO:Pd photocathodes under standard light on conditions. The semi-circular shape of Nyquist plots at low frequencies is mainly due to the transfer of photo-generated charge carriers between the electrolyte and CuO:Pd photocathodes while the diameter of the semi-circles corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The reduction of Rct of CuO:Pd indicates the enhancement of charge transfer between the CuO:Pd photocathodes and electrolyte, which results in an improvement of photocatalytic performance, as already shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 5  Nyquist plots of CuO:Pd photocathodes fabricated with Pd sputtering power of 0–50 W. Charge transfer resistance is significantly reduced with Pd incorporation. 
The linear part of the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot of the CuO:Pd photocathodes is shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI†.† The following M–S equation was used to fit the linear part of the M–S plot:72 (3)where C, e, ε, ε0, NA, VFB, VS, T, and k are the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor, permittivity of vacuum, relative permittivity of the semiconductor (10.26 for CuO), hole carrier density, flat-band voltage, potential applied to the photocathode, temperature, Boltzmann constant, and elemental charge, respectively. The x-intercept and the slope of the extrapolated linear part of the M–S curve is used to estimate the values of NA and VFB. The estimated values of VFB and NA are presented in Table 1. The variation of NA and VFB with Pd sputtering power follows the same trend as photocurrent. The greater value of NA of CuO:Pd than CuO photocathodes indicates the faster charge transfer. Furthermore, the greater value of VFB of CuO:Pd than CuO photocathodes provides a larger space charge region potential and hence a larger driving force to separate the photo-induced electron–hole pairs in the space charge region.

3.2. CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode
As already observed in the optical properties of the fabricated CuO:Pd samples in Fig. 3c, incorporation of Pd into the thin CuO film slightly enhances the optical reflectance, which impacts the generation of photocurrent. Therefore, it is necessary to perform interfacial and geometric engineering on the light trapping CuO:Pd thin film to improve the performance of the fabricated CuO:Pd photocathodes. To address this issue, a thin CuO capping layer (∼15 nm) was deposited on top of the CuO:Pd light trapping layer to reduce the optical reflectance of the prepared samples. Fig. 6 shows the optical absorbance, transmittance and reflectance of the prepared CuO:Pd and CuO:Pd–CuO samples prepared at a Pd sputtering power of 30 W. As shown here, adding a CuO capping layer on top of the CuO:Pd light trapping thin film could significantly reduce the optical reflectance, which in turn results in the improvement of optical absorption. The effect of adding the CuO capping layer on the PEC current–voltage characteristics is shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7, adding the capping layer on top of the light trapping CuO:Pd thin film could increase the photocurrent of the prepared photocathode, which is mainly attributed to the reduction of optical reflectance.
 Fig. 6  (a) Absorbance, (b) transmittance, and (c) reflectance of the CuO:Pd–CuO thin film deposited with a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Optical reflectance is reduced while optical absorption is enhanced by adding a CuO capping layer.

Inserting a top CuO capping layer increases the photocurrent while it does no influence the dark-current. This indicates the effectiveness of insertion of a CuO capping layer in improving the photocatalytic activity of the CuO:Pd photocathode. 
3.3. CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode
To reach the maximum efficiency, it is of crucial importance to improve the charge transfer between the optical absorber and electrode contact. In this context, insertion of a hole transporting layer between the optical absorbing CuO:Pd thin film and FTO coated glass substrate can be considered as an effective method. The impact of inserting the nitrogen doped CuO hole transporting layer (CuO(N)) between optical absorbing CuO:Pd and FTO coated glass substrate is investigated in this section of the paper. The cross-sectional and high resolution TEM images of the prepared CuO:Pd sample with the CuO(N) hole transporting layer inserted between CuO:Pd and the FTO coated glass substrate are shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI†.† The thickness of the inserted CuO(N) hole transporting layer is around 20 nm.
Current density vs. voltage and photocorrosion stability of the prepared CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes are presented in Fig. 8. As shown in this figure, insertion of the CuO(N) hole transporting layer improves the photocurrent and photocorrosion stability. To investigate the impact of inserting the CuO(N) hole transporting layer between the light trapping CuO:Pd and FTO coated glass substrate, Nyquist plots of the prepared samples were measured. Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist plots of the CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes. As shown here, the imaginary impedance of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode is lower than that of the CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode, indicating the improvement of charge transfer between the photocathode and electrolyte. Indeed, insertion of the CuO(N) hole transporting layer forms low resistivity ohmic contact which facilities charge transfer. This results in a reduction of the recombination rate at the electrode/absorber interface and an improvement of Rct. Therefore, the PEC characteristics of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode are improved, as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  (a) Jphoto and Jdarkvs. potential and (b) photocorrosion stability of CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes fabricated at a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Inserting a CuO(N) hole transporting layer reduces the dark current significantly while improving the photocurrent. CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes retain 78% and 85% of their initial Jphoto at 0 VRHE after 1 hour. This indicates the effectiveness of insertion of a CuO(N) hole transporting layer in improving the photocorrosion stability. 
 Fig. 9  Nyquist plots of the CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes fabricated at a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Charge transfer resistance is reduced with CuO(N) hole transporting layer insertion. 
As we have already shown elsewhere,73 doping CuO with nitrogen significantly increases the carrier concentration of CuO thin films. Therefore, inserting the CuO(N) hole transporting layer between the FTO electrode and light trapping CuO:Pd thin films could form the optical absorbing thin film with a step distribution of carriers, which in turn results in creation of a CuO optical absorbing layer with back surface fields. Formation of the CuO optical absorption layer with a back surface field structure could effectively repel the photo-induced minority carriers and reduce the recombination velocity, resulting in enhancement of the charge collection efficiency. To investigate this hypothesis, the IPCE of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes is compared in Fig. S6 of the ESI.† As shown here, the IPCE of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode is higher than that of the CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode in the 320–690 nm wavelength range. This indicates the effectiveness of incorporating the CuO(N) hole transporting layer in photo-generated charge carrier separation.
3.4. CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 photocathode
Poor photocorrosion stability and low photovoltage are the two key limiting factors for large scale use of the copper oxide based photocatalyst in industrial applications. Incorporation of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer was demonstrated as an effective method to improve the photocorrosion stability and increase the photovoltage.74–79 However, not much research was carried out to investigate the impact of crystallinity of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer on the PEC and photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalyst. In situ plasma treatment during sputter deposition is considered as an effective way to tune a material's properties. Here, a nanocrystal engineered ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer were deposited on the CuO:Pd optical absorbing layer through in situ plasma treatment of the substrate during sputtering. The radio frequency (RF) sputtering power of the TiO2 and ZnO was fixed at 300 W, while the in situ plasma power of the substrate holder was varied from 0 to 50 W to tune the crystallinity of the sputter deposited ZnO and TiO2 thin films. The cross-sectional TEM image of the prepared CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 photocathode with ZnO and TiO2 treated at an in situ plasma power of 50 W is shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer is around 10 and 60 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 10  (a) Cross-sectional TEM and (b) high resolution TEM images of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 photocathode decorated with AuPd nanoparticles. Thicknesses of CuO(N), CuO:Pd, CuO, ZnO, and TiO2 are around 20, 200, 15, 10, and 60 nm, respectively. The diameter of Pd nanostructures is around 8 nm. 
Noble metal nanostructures such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and copper (Cu) are widely used as co-catalysts to improve photocatalytic reactions such as photodegradation of organic pollutants and water splitting.80–83 Among them, bimetallic nanostructures composed of Au and Pd show greater photocatalytic activity as compared to monometallic nanostructures.84,85 Indeed, the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between the semiconductor and metal nanostructure improves the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and enhances the surface catalytic activity.86,87 Therefore, to improve the performance of our fabricated photocathode, AuPd nanostructure co-catalysts were sputter deposited on top of the TiO2 protective layer from an Au–Pd (60:40) target under the same conditions as those presented in our recent paper.29 A schematic diagram and top view TEM image of CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–ZnO–TiO2 are presented in Fig. S7 of the ESI.† The top view TEM image of the sample shows a uniform and random distribution of Au–Pd nanoparticles. The size of Au–Pd nanoparticles is around 20 to 40 nm.
The impact of in situ plasma power during deposition of thin ZnO and TiO2 films on the crystal quality was investigated by analysing the XRD spectra of the deposited ZnO and TiO2 on a glass substrate. The XRD spectra of the in situ plasma treated ZnO and TiO2 thin films are presented in Fig. 11a and b, respectively. The thin ZnO thin films show the main XRD peak at 34.38 degrees, which corresponds to (002) (JCPDS 00-065-0726). XRD spectra of thin TiO2 films have the main XRD peak at 69.79 degrees, which is ascribed to the (112) (JCPDS 01-079-6031). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main XRD peaks is also included in Fig. 11c and d. As shown in these figures, the intensity of XRD peaks increases while the FWHM of the main XRD peaks reduces by increasing the in situ plasma power, indicating the improvement of crystallinity of the deposited samples. Higher plasma power enhances the surface diffusion of adatoms, which is beneficial for adatom rearrangement in the equilibrium lattice position, reduction of impurities and imperfections and improvement of crystallinity of the sputtered thin films.

The impact of in situ plasma treatment of ZnO and TiO2 on the chemical composition and optical properties of the deposited thin films was investigated by analyzing the XPS spectra and optical characteristics of the samples, respectively. Fig. S8† shows the high-resolution Zn 2p and Ti 2p core-level XPS spectra of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer. The in situ plasma power does not affect the chemical composition of the deposited ZnO and TiO2 thin films. The optical absorbance, transmittance and reflectance of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 thin films were compared with those of thin films of CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO, CuO(N)–CuO:Pd and CuO:Pd. As shown here, incorporation of the TiO2 protective layer and ZnO buffer layer could positively improve the optical properties. However, there is trade-off between the PEC characteristics and thicknesses of the ZnO and TiO2 layers. In Fig. S9 of the ESI,† the optical absorbance, current density, and photocorrosion stability of CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 with different thicknesses of ZnO and TiO2 layers are presented. Although the optical absorbance of CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 with a thicker ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer is greater than that of the sample with thinner buffer and protective layers, the PEC characteristics of the sample with the thinner buffer and protective layers are superior, indicating the important effect of the thickness of ZnO and TiO2 thin films on the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated photocathodes.
The effect of in situ plasma treatment during deposition of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer on the PEC activity of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathode is investigated in this section. Fig. 12 shows the current density, photocorrosion stability, hydrogen production, and Nyquist plots of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathodes. All of the presented photoelectrochemical (PEC) characteristics of the prepared photocathodes were improved by increasing the in situ plasma power. Indeed, the improvement of photocurrent, photovoltage, photocorrosion stability, charge transport and hydrogen generation of the plasma treated CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 photocathodes as compared to the control sample is ascribed to the reduction of the recombination rate of TiO2 and ZnO layers due to the improvement of crystallinity of the ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer. As shown here, upon increasing the in situ plasma power from 0 to 15 W, we observe the significant improvement of PEC characteristics, while upon further increasing the in situ power to 30 W and then to 50 W, the improvement rate is a bit slower, indicating the limitation of this method to further improve the PEC activity. The photocorrosion stability of CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuP photocathodes prepared at varying in situ plasma treatment power and measured at a prolonged time of 20 hours is also presented in Fig. S10 of the ESI† to further highlight the importance of in situ plasma treatment.

A record-high Jsc of 8 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE was achieved for the photocathode with an in situ plasma power of 50 W. 
To investigate the performance of the fabricated photocathodes, the IPCE spectra of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd and CuO:Pd photocathodes are compared in Fig. 13. The CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathode shows higher IPCE than the CuO:Pd photocathode over a broad range of wavelengths due to coupling of the narrow-bandgap CuO:Pd with the wide-bandgap ZnO and TiO2. The IPCE of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathode at 0 VRHE is above 50% in the 350–700 nm wavelength range. A maximum IPCE value of ∼62% was achieved at ∼560 nm wavelength, gradually reducing to zero at ∼750 nm.
 Fig. 13  IPCE of CuO:Pd and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathodes fabricated with a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. The IPCE of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathode at 0 VRHE is above 60% in the 450–675 nm wavelength range. 
A comparison between the photocurrent and photocorrosion stability for the prepared CuO based photocathodes is shown in Table 2. CuO based photocathodes are categorized into four groups (crystal engineered thin films, and nanostructured, metal doped and multi-layer structures). As shown here, optimizing the multilayer structures is an efficient method to improve both photocurrent and stability of CuO based photocathodes.

In some water splitting 2 photon devices, copper oxide can be used in a stacked tandem cell88 and hence can be illuminated from the back with respect to the electrolyte. Therefore, it is worth investigating the back illumination current density of the prepared photocathode. In Fig. S11 of the ESI,† spectral irradiance and current density under back and front illumination were compared. As presented in this figure, the photocurrent generated under back illumination is significantly lower than the photocurrent generated under front illumination, demonstrating the importance of the illumination side. It also indicates that the front pn-junction region (CuO:Pd–ZnO–TiO2) separates charges better than the back p+p-junction region (CuO(N)–CuO:Pd).
The deposited CuO, CuO:Pd, CuO(N)–CuO:Pd, CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd, and ZnO–TiO2–AuPd were also used as photocatalysts for degradation of methylene blue (MB) under sunlight illumination. Concentration vs. time plots for photocatalytic degradation of MB are shown in Fig. 14. A control experiment was carried out to show that photodegradation is not apparent without using of a photocatalyst. The MB concentration is significantly reduced by incorporation the Pd nanostructures and the CuO(N) interfacial layer. Among the samples used for MB degradation, the photocatalyst with the in situ plasma treated ZnO buffer layer and TiO2 protective layer shows the best performance for the photocatalytic degradation of MB under sunlight illumination, highlighting the key role of engineering of CuO in the efficient enhancement of the MB photocatalytic degradation.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we have developed a CuO:Pd light trapping thin film to address the discrepancy between the optical absorption length and charge collection efficiency of CuO. The performance of the fabricated photocathodes was improved by creating a back surface field structure and reducing the optical reflectance through integrating a CuO(N) hole transporting layer, CuO:Pd light trapping thin film and CuO capping layer. The photocorrosion stability and photocurrent density of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathode were greatly improved by coating the photocatalyst with a nanocrystal engineered TiO2 protective layer and ZnO buffer layer and subsequently decorating it with AuPd nanostructures as a co-catalyst. An impressive record high photocurrent density of ∼8 mA cm−2, a world record photocorrosion stability of 95% for 6 hours, and high photocatalytic degradation efficiency were achieved due to efficient charge separation, reduction of recombination losses, improved charge transport channels, and broadened light absorption. Indeed, formation of CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 with strong light trapping and a back surface field structure provides a well-aligned bandgap structure and fast electron transfer pathway to thermodynamically transfer the photoexcited electrons in CuO(N), CuO:Pd and CuO to ZnO and subsequently TiO2. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to significantly increase the performance of CuO photocatalysts for hydrogen generation and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.

 	Fig. 1  Cross-sectional and high resolution TEM images of CuO:Pd photocathodes deposited at a CuO sputtering power of 300 W and Pd sputtering power of (a) 0, (b) 5, (c) 15, (d) 30, and (e) 50 W. The thickness of the CuO:Pd photocathodes is around 200 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photocurrent density, (b) dark current density, and (c) (Jphoto–Jdark) vs. potential for CuO:Pd photocathodes fabricated with Pd sputtering power of 0–50 W. Although the photocurrent improves with increasing Pd incorporation, the dark current also worsens.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Absorbance, (b) transmittance, and (c) reflectance of CuO:Pd thin films deposited with Pd sputtering power of 0–50 W. Optical absorption is enhanced with increasing Pd incorporation.	 

 	Fig. 4  IPCE of CuO:Pd photocathodes fabricated with Pd sputtering power of 0–50 W. A high Jsc of ∼4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE was achieved for the photocathode with a Pd sputtering power of 30 W. The IPCE of the best performing CuO:Pd photocathode at 0 VRHE is above 40% in the 450–675 nm wavelength range. The IPCE of the best performing aluminum doped CuO (CuO:Al) is also provided for comparison.30	 

 	Fig. 5  Nyquist plots of CuO:Pd photocathodes fabricated with Pd sputtering power of 0–50 W. Charge transfer resistance is significantly reduced with Pd incorporation.

 	Fig. 6  (a) Absorbance, (b) transmittance, and (c) reflectance of the CuO:Pd–CuO thin film deposited with a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Optical reflectance is reduced while optical absorption is enhanced by adding a CuO capping layer.

photo and Jdarkvs. potential of CuO:Pd and CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes fabricated at a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Inserting a top CuO capping layer increases the photocurrent while it does no influence the dark-current. This indicates the effectiveness of insertion of a CuO capping layer in improving the photocatalytic activity of the CuO:Pd photocathode.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Jphoto and Jdarkvs. potential and (b) photocorrosion stability of CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes fabricated at a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Inserting a CuO(N) hole transporting layer reduces the dark current significantly while improving the photocurrent. CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes retain 78% and 85% of their initial Jphoto at 0 VRHE after 1 hour. This indicates the effectiveness of insertion of a CuO(N) hole transporting layer in improving the photocorrosion stability.	 

 	Fig. 9  Nyquist plots of the CuO:Pd–CuO and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO photocathodes fabricated at a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. Charge transfer resistance is reduced with CuO(N) hole transporting layer insertion.	 

 	Fig. 10  (a) Cross-sectional TEM and (b) high resolution TEM images of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2 photocathode decorated with AuPd nanoparticles. Thicknesses of CuO(N), CuO:Pd, CuO, ZnO, and TiO2 are around 20, 200, 15, 10, and 60 nm, respectively. The diameter of Pd nanostructures is around 8 nm.	 

 	Fig. 11  XRD spectra for each of (a) ZnO and (b) TiO2 films deposited at varying in situ plasma power and FWHM of the main (c) ZnO(002) and (d) TiO2(112) peaks. Higher in situ plasma power gives better crystallinity.	 

 	Fig. 12  (a) J vs. potential, (b) photocorrosion stability, (c) Nyquist plots, and (d) hydrogen evolution of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathodes fabricated with in situ plasma power from 0 to 50 W. A record-high Jsc of 8 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE was achieved for the photocathode with an in situ plasma power of 50 W.	 

 	Fig. 13  IPCE of CuO:Pd and CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathodes fabricated with a Pd and CuO sputtering power of 30 and 300 W, respectively. The IPCE of the CuO(N)–CuO:Pd–CuO–ZnO–TiO2–AuPd photocathode at 0 VRHE is above 60% in the 450–675 nm wavelength range.
