    , Accepted 26th April 2018First published on 27th April 2018AbstractHybrid photocatalysts constructed with a mononuclear Ru(II)-complex (RuP), silver nanoparticles, and carbon nitride nanosheets (NS-C3N4) photocatalyze CO2 reduction to selectively form formate under visible light. The structure of the nanoparticulate silver species, which worked as promoters for the reaction, was characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission microscopy, and X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy. The silver promoters were loaded on the surface of NS-C3N4 by an impregnation method from an aqueous solution containing AgNO3 or an in situ photodeposition method. Impregnation of NS-C3N4 with 2.0 wt% Ag followed by reduction with H2 at 473 K (further modified with RuP) resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity, giving a turnover number of 5700 (based on RuP), which was the greatest value among the formate-generating hybrid systems with a mononuclear complex. While the optimized photocatalyst contained highly dispersed Ag2O-like nanoclusters as the major silver species, experimental results suggested that highly dispersed Ag0 species are more important for enhancing CO2 reduction activity, that is, the obtained experimental results led us to conclude that there are two major factors affecting activity: one is the feature size of silver species (smaller is better), and the other is the oxidation state of silver (metallic is better).
Introduction
CO2 reduction on a heterogeneous photocatalyst has been extensively studied as a means of chemical fixation of CO2, an inert molecule that causes the greenhouse effect.1–4 So far, several types of photocatalysts have been reported, including nanoparticle-loaded semiconductors5–13 and metal-complex/semiconductor hybrids.14–27
In metal oxide photocatalysts, it has been reported that silver species deposited on the metal oxide surface promote photocatalytic CO2 reduction.6,7,9–13 Because Ag0 is a good electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction,28 Kudo et al. first applied nanoparticulate Ag0 as a cocatalyst for CO2 reduction on ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) layered perovskites having 3.79–3.85 eV band gaps. The Ag0-loaded materials showed photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to form CO and water oxidation into O2 under UV irradiation (λ > 200 nm), although H2 evolution, which is an undesirable side reaction during CO2 reduction, occurred simultaneously. Following this work, several groups reported similar systems consisting of a wide-gap oxide semiconductor and silver nanoparticles. Some of them exhibited very high selectivity to CO2 reduction, while suppressing proton reduction to release H2.7,11,12 These studies claimed that Ag0 nanoparticles on semiconductors work as active sites (i.e., cocatalysts) for catalytic CO2 reduction.
Because these metal-oxide photocatalysts only work under UV irradiation due to their large band gaps, it is highly desirable to develop a visible-light-responsive photocatalytic system from the viewpoint of solar energy conversion. Our group has been developing such visible-light-active photocatalysts, with a focus on hybrids that consist of a narrow-gap non-oxide semiconductor (such as oxynitrides and nitrides) and a functional metal complex.15,16,19,21,23 For example, carbon nitride (C3N4) modified with a mononuclear Ru(II) complex,15,19,20 a binuclear Ru(II)–Ru(II) complex,22 or a Ru(II)–Re(I) complex24 showed photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction into formate or CO under visible light (λ > 400 nm). The carbon source of the product in these systems was confirmed by isotope tracer experiments with 13CO2 to be CO2. Importantly, the photocatalytic performance both in the mononuclear and the binuclear systems using C3N4 to yield formate was significantly improved by modification with Ag nanoparticles.22 Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that nanoparticulate silver species on C3N4 collected electrons, which were likely to move to the loaded Ru complex, thereby promoting photocatalytic CO2 reduction.22 Interestingly, however, silver species loaded on visible-light-responsive (oxy)nitride semiconductors did not efficiently serve as a cocatalyst for CO2 reduction without Ru complexes,16,22 clearly different from those loaded on metal oxide photocatalysts. In any photocatalytic system, it is important to understand the structure–activity relationship toward the construction of more efficient systems. At present, however, the local structure of the loaded silver species in metal-complex/semiconductor hybrids as well as its impact on photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction has not been investigated in detail. Consequently, no guidelines to improve the photocatalytic activity with respect to the structure of silver species are available.
In the present study, we investigated the structure of silver-modified carbon nitride nanosheets (NS-C3N4) by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microcopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS). In addition, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, which is a powerful technique that can visualize photogenerated carrier dynamics in a semiconductor material,29–31 was conducted in order to investigate the impact of the loaded Ag species on the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers in NS-C3N4. The relationship between the structural characteristics of silver-modified NS-C3N4 and the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction with the aid of a mononuclear Ru(II) complex (RuP) is discussed. An illustration of the present CO2 photoreduction system is shown in Scheme 1. Through the optimization of the Ag loading conditions, we not only elucidated the optimal structure of the loaded Ag species but also realized highly stable and selective CO2-to-formate conversion with a record turnover number of 5700 in mononuclear metal complex/semiconductor hybrid photocatalysts.

Experimental
Synthesis of carbon nitride nanosheets
Carbon nitride nanosheets used in this work were synthesized as follows. First, 10 g of urea (99+%, Wako Chemicals Co.) was heated in air at a ramp rate of 2.3 K min−1 to 873 K, and was kept at this temperature for 4 h, followed by cooling without temperature control. The as-prepared carbon nitride was activated by thermal H2 treatment.32 100 mg of the sample was heated in a H2 stream (20 mL min−1) at a ramp rate of 10 K min−1 to 773 K, and was kept at this temperature for 1 h, followed by cooling naturally. For simplicity, the as-prepared material is represented hereafter as NS-C3N4. The specific surface area determined by nitrogen adsorption experiments at 77 K was 63 m2 g−1.
Modification of NS-C3N4 with silver species
Silver species as promoters were loaded onto the surface of NS-C3N4 by an impregnation method using AgNO3 (>99.8%, Wako Pure Chemicals Co.) as the precursor. 50 mg of NS-C3N4 was dispersed in an aqueous AgNO3 solution (10 mL). The water content was subsequently removed under reduced pressure at 317 K. The resulting solid sample was heated under a H2 stream (20 mL min−1) or static air at 373–623 K for 1 h in the same manner as described above. The amount of Ag loading ranged from 0 to 5.0 wt%.
Ag loading was also done by a photodeposition method. 100 mg of NS-C3N4 was dispersed in an aqueous AgNO3 solution (100 mL) containing 10 vol% methanol (>99.8%, Kanto Chemicals Co.), followed by degassing and irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp (λ > 300 nm) for 2 h to reduce Ag+ ions to Ag0. After collecting the resulting solid by filtration, the as-prepared Ag-loaded NS-C3N4 was dried under reduced pressure overnight.
Adsorption of RuP onto silver-modified NS-C3N4

RuP was synthesized according to the method reported in our previous paper.19 The successful synthesis of RuP was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and by elemental analysis.
Adsorption of RuP onto NS-C3N4 was conducted as follows: 40 mg of the silver-modified C3N4 was dispersed in an acetonitrile (MeCN) solution (20 mL) of RuP. The suspension was stirred at room temperature in the dark overnight to allow for adsorption/desorption equilibrium, followed by filtration and washing with acetonitrile. The filtrates were collected and concentrated to a volume of 30 mL. The amount of RuP adsorbed was calculated based on the UV-vis spectrum of the filtrate, using the equation:  where Abefore and Aafter are the absorbance of the solution before and after the adsorption procedure, respectively, and C is the initial concentration of the complex.
Characterization of materials
The prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (MiniFlex600, Rigaku; Cu Kα radiation), UV-VIS-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (V-565, Jasco), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2010F, JEOL). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of each specimen was determined using a BELSOEP-mini instrument (BEL Japan) at liquid nitrogen temperature. The amounts of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen were determined by elemental analysis (MICRO CORDER JM10, J-SCIENCE) at Suzukakedai Materials Analysis Division, Technical Department, Tokyo Institute of Technology.
XAFS measurements of Ag-K edge spectra were carried out at the AR-NW10A beamline of the PF-AR (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan) under the approval of the Photon Factory Advisory Committee (Proposal no. 2014S2-006) and the BL01B1 beamline of the SPring-8 synchrotron facility (Hyogo, Japan) using a ring energy of 8 GeV and a stored current of 100 mA in the top-up mode (Proposal no. 2017B1040 and 2017B1438). XAFS spectra were acquired at room temperature in the fluorescence or transmittance mode using a Si(311) double-crystal-monochromator. The data for XAFS spectra were processed using Athena.33 The Fourier transforms of k3-weighted EXAFS spectra were typically in the 3.0–12.0 Å region.
Time-resolved IR absorption measurements
Measurements were performed using a home-made spectrometer described previously.29,30 Powders of NS-C3N4 and silver-modified NS-C3N4 were loaded on a CaF2 plate at a density of 1.5 mg cm−2 and placed into an IR cell for measurements. The samples were photoexcited using a 355 nm UV pulse from an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite I, duration: 6 ns, power: 0.3 mJ, repetition rate: 5–0.1 Hz), and transient absorptions in the visible to mid-IR region were measured in a vacuum. The time resolution of this spectrometer was limited to 1–2 µs by the bandwidth of the amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR560, 1 MHz).
Photocatalytic reactions
Reactions were performed at room temperature (298 K) using an 8 mL test tube containing 4 mL of a mixed solution of N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and triethanolamine (TEOA) (4:1 v/v) and 4 mg of the photocatalyst powder. Prior to irradiation, the suspension was purged with CO2 (Taiyo Nippon Sanso Co., >99.995%) for 20–30 min. A 400 W high pressure Hg lamp (SEN) was used as a light source, in combination with a NaNO2 solution as a filter to provide visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The gaseous reaction products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GL Science, Model GC323). The formate generated in the liquid phase was analyzed via a capillary electrophoresis system (Otsuka Electronics Co., Model CAPI-3300).
The apparent quantum yield for the formate generation was measured using a 300 W xenon lamp (Asahi Spectra Co., MAX-303) and a band-pass filter (λ = 400 nm) with a light intensity of 7.3 mW in the same manner as reported previously.19,22 In this case, 20 mg of RuP (27.9 µmol g−1)/Ag (2.0 wt%)/NS-C3N4 powder was employed for the reaction.
Purification of organic solvents
Organic solvent used in this work was subjected to purification prior to use. DMA was dried over molecular sieves 4A (which was heated at 373 K under reduced pressure (<1 torr) overnight for several days), and distilled under reduced pressure (10–20 torr). Methanol was used after distillation. MeCN was distilled over P2O5 twice, and then distilled over CaH2 prior to use. TEOA was distilled under reduced pressure (<1 torr). The distilled DMA and TEOA were kept under Ar prior to use.
Results and discussion
Photocatalytic activity
First we tested silver-modified NS-C3N4 prepared by an impregnation and H2-reduction method as the component of the RuP/Ag/NS-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst. Note here that the preparation conditions of Ag/NS-C3N4 did not influence the adsorption of RuP; in all cases, nearly quantitative adsorption (1.9–2.0 µmol g−1) was achieved, and that RuP does not have absorption in the visible light region.19

Fig. 1A shows the dependence of formate generation on the loading amount of Ag using samples treated at a common heating temperature of 473 K. Here the activity was improved abruptly with an increase in the loading amount of Ag up to 2.0 wt%, beyond which it began to drop. The activity was also found to depend strongly on the heating temperature, as shown in Fig. 1B. Formate generation increased almost linearly as the temperature rose up to 473 K, and then decreased monotonically. In all cases, selectivity to formate was 85–95% (except for the unloaded one), with some byproduction of H2. We also investigated the possible formation of other products such as formaldehyde and methane. However, no additional products other than formate and H2 were observed, except for a trace amount of CO, which was undetectable in most cases.

Reaction conditions: catalyst, 4.0 mg; reactant solution, a mixed solution of DMA and TEOA (4:1 v/v, 4.0 mL); light source, a 400 W high-pressure Hg lamp with a NaNO2 aqueous solution filter. Reaction time: 5 h. 
Under the optimal conditions, an apparent quantum yield of 4.2% (at 400 nm) and a catalytic turnover number (TON) of 5775 (with respect to the mole amount of RuP, which is the active site for CO2 reduction) were obtained (Fig. 2), indicative of the catalytic cycle of the reaction. Importantly, the high selectivity to formate generation (>90%) was kept even after an extended period of reaction, meaning that RuP on the optimized Ag/NS-C3N4 worked very efficiently. Here it is also noted that the obtained TON value is obviously higher than the previously reported values (1000–1400),19,22 and is the highest one among the formate-generating hybrids constructed with a mononuclear metal complex and a semiconductor. Reproducibility tests using different batches of samples showed that there was an error of 20% in formate generation under the optimal conditions. Without RuP, Ag-modified NS-C3N4 (2.0 wt%, 423 K) produced a small amount of H2, not formate. This again confirmed that Ag species on NS-C3N4 did not effectively work as cocatalysts for CO2 reduction, and that RuP was indispensable for the reaction to proceed. As discussed in our previous paper,19 we think that hydrogen bonds are formed between –NH2 groups on NS-C3N4 and –PO3H2 groups derived from RuP. However, we could not elucidate the exact location of RuP on Ag/NS-C3N4 at present. Considering the fact that the CO2 reduction reaction was significantly promoted by Ag loading on NS-C3N4, it is likely that the relative location of RuP and Ag nanoparticles is close enough to afford electron transfer between the two.

Structural characterization
To investigate the relationship between the photocatalyst structure and activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction using Ag-modified NS-C3N4, the synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, UV-visible DRS, HR-TEM and XAFS. As shown in Fig. 3A, XRD analyses for Ag-modified NS-C3N4 having different Ag amounts showed no sign of silver species up to 3.0 wt%. At 5.0 wt%, however, a small peak assigned to Ag0 was observed. Fig. 3B shows DRS of the same set of samples. Spectral features are similar to each other at lower Ag content, but the background in longer wavelength regions tends to be more pronounced at higher loadings. This absorption can be assignable to Ag0. Similar tendencies were observed in samples treated at different temperatures with a common Ag amount (Fig. 4). That is, with increasing temperature, absorption features assignable to Ag0 were observed in DRS.

The # mark in the panel (A) is assigned to the (111) diffraction peak of Ag0. A broad peak at around 22 degree in XRD patterns originated from a glass folder for the measurements.

The # mark in the panel (A) is assigned to the (111) diffraction peak of Ag0. A broad peak at around 22 degree in XRD patterns originated from a glass folder for the measurements. An enlarged view of the XRD pattern of the 623 K sample is shown in Fig. S1.† 
The generation of larger Ag0 species was confirmed by TEM observations. Here, the loaded silver species could be distinguishable because of the difference in electron density between silver and NS-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 5, samples prepared with larger Ag loadings or treated at higher temperatures contained larger silver species with an average size of 10–13 nm. On the other hand, silver species in the 2.0 wt% sample (heated at 473 K) were highly dispersed in the form of nanoparticles having an average size of 2.3 nm without noticeable aggregation.
 Fig. 5  (Top) TEM images and (Bottom) the corresponding Ag-particle size distributions of Ag-loaded NS-C3N4 treated with H2 under different conditions. 
Because neither XRD nor DRS gave us sufficient information on the structure of silver species in samples prepared at lower Ag loadings or temperatures, the local structure of silver was investigated by means of XAFS, which is a powerful technique to identify nanoparticulate cocatalysts on a semiconductor photocatalyst.9,10,34–38 Regarding the analysis of surface-deposited nanoparticles, it is well known that X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is another representative technique. In the case of silver species, however, XPS gives small shifts in binding energy for the Ag+ state compared with the metallic Ag0 state.39,40 Kaushik also suggested X-ray excited Auger spectroscopy as an alternative means to investigate the oxidation state of silver species.40 Although we measured Auger spectra for the prepared silver-modified samples, no peak was detected unfortunately most likely due to the low concentration of the silver species.

Fig. 6A shows the Ag K-edge EXAFS spectra of the same set of samples. It is first noted that the oscillation profiles of the samples clearly differ from that of the AgNO3 reference, indicating that the impregnated AgNO3 species are decomposed upon subsequent heat treatment with H2 at 473 K. The oscillation profiles of Ag-modified NS-C3N4 with smaller Ag loadings in smaller k regions are similar to that of the Ag2O reference, but not perfectly the same. The EXAFS oscillation tended to be clearer with an increase in the Ag loading. Importantly, contribution from Ag0 was more pronounced with increasing the loading amount, while reducing the extent of the oscillation derived from Ag2O. This tendency is more obvious in the FT of EXAFS spectra, as displayed in Fig. 6B.
 Fig. 6  (A) Ag K-edge EXAFS spectra and (B) FT of EXAFS spectra of NS-C3N4 modified with different amounts of Ag at a common reduction temperature of 473 K. 
The EXAFS spectra of samples treated at different reduction temperatures with a common Ag loading amount of 2.0 wt% are shown in Fig. 7. Even at 373 K heating, the spectral feature was different from that of the AgNO3 precursor, but similar to that of Ag2O with some mixing of Ag0. With increasing the heating temperature, the contribution derived from Ag0 was more distinct, as can be seen both in the EXAFS oscillation profiles and FT of EXAFS spectra. This is reasonable, because increasing the heating temperature with H2 should result in more reduction of cationic Ag species. Even at the highest temperature of 623 K, however, some contributions from Ag2O remained. The results of EXAFS analyses for samples with higher Ag loadings or higher heating temperatures are consistent with the results of XRD and DRS (Fig. 3 and 4).
 Fig. 7  (A) Ag K-edge EXAFS spectra and (B) FT of EXAFS spectra of 2.0 wt% Ag-modified NS-C3N4 treated at different temperatures. 
It was thus shown that Ag species loaded on NS-C3N4 are close to Ag2O at lower loadings and temperatures, but Ag0 co-existed with some aggregations at higher loadings and temperatures to some extent. The results of elemental analysis indicated that the as-synthesized NS-C3N4 contained ca. 5.0 wt% oxygen, which is large enough to be the source of the Ag2O-like species even at 5.0 wt% Ag loading. Therefore, the remaining oxygen species in NS-C3N4 might be the source of “Ag2O” observed in XAFS measurements. It should be noted that other oxynitride-type semiconductors (such as Y–Ta oxynitride) modified with Ag by the same impregnation and H2-reduction methods contained Ag0 dominantly.41 Thus, the formation of “Ag2O-like species” observed in this study appears to originate from strong interactions between the loaded silver species and the NS-C3N4 surface.
Factors affecting activity
The results of the photocatalytic reaction and structural characterization indicate that the photocatalytic activity of RuP/Ag/NS-C3N4 for CO2 reduction is dependent on the physicochemical state of silver deposits on NS-C3N4. More concretely, it appears that Ag2O-like nanoparticles having higher dispersion on NS-C3N4 contributed to the enhanced activity, while aggregation and/or excess coverage of silver species had a negative impact on activity. For example, the activity was decreased from 2.0 to 3.0 wt% despite the fact that these two samples contained almost the same Ag2O-like structure (Fig. 6). Such an excess loading of silver species on the NS-C3N4 surface could hinder active sites for redox reactions; in this case, most likely the oxidation reaction, thereby lowering the overall efficiency. At present, however, we could not judge whether or not Ag0 had a promotional effect on activity, because samples prepared with larger Ag loadings or treated at higher temperatures (i.e., less active samples) contained both Ag2O and Ag0.
To investigate the possible impact of Ag0 on activity, additional two samples were prepared as follows: one was prepared by a similar impregnation method using AgNO3 as the precursor (2.0 wt% Ag content), but followed by air heating at 473 K, in which the formation of Ag0 may be minimized. The other one was synthesized by an in situ photodeposition method, where Ag0 is supposed to be dominantly deposited.
Compared to the optimized sample prepared at 2.0 wt% Ag with H2 reduction at 473 K, the air-treated sample showed no significant changes in XRD and DRS (Fig. S2†). TEM observations indicated that the air-treated sample contained highly dispersed silver species having an average size of 2.0 nm, similar to the optimized H2-reduced sample (Fig. 8). By contrast, the photodeposited sample showed a clear sign of Ag0 formation (Fig. S2†), with a relatively large size (16 nm in average). EXAFS analyses for these samples showed that the air-treated sample dominantly contained an Ag2O-like structure that is similar to the optimal H2-reduced sample, while Ag0 was the major species in the photodeposited sample (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 8  (Top) TEM images and (Bottom) the corresponding Ag-particle size distributions of 2.0 wt% Ag-loaded NS-C3N4 prepared by an impregnation method with air-heating and a photodeposition method. 
 Fig. 9  (A) Ag K-edge EXAFS spectra and (B) FT of EXAFS spectra of 2.0 wt% Ag-modified NS-C3N4 treated in air and prepared by an in situ photodeposition method. The data for the optimized sample (2.0 wt% Ag with H2 reduction at 473 K) are also shown. 
Using the as-prepared two additional samples, visible-light CO2 reduction was conducted with the aid of RuP in the same manner. The results are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, the activity of the air-treated sample was lower than that of the H2-reduced one, even though it had almost the same local structure of Ag2O with an identical size, as judged from TEM observation and EXAFS measurements (Fig. 8 and 9). The photodeposited sample also exhibited lower activity than the best-performing one. However, the photodeposited sample, even which contained a larger Ag0 size with wider distribution, worked much better than the sample prepared at 623 K H2 that contained both Ag0 and Ag2O with smaller sizes and narrower distribution. This result indicates that Ag0 had a better promotional effect than Ag2O-like species, although we could not realize highly dispersed Ag0 nanoparticles on NS-C3N4 due to a technical difficulty at this moment. Nevertheless, further increase in activity should be possible if one can modify NS-C3N4 with highly dispersed Ag0. The fact that the H2-reduced sample was better than the air-treated one may support the idea that silver species in the former are closer to Ag0 than those in the latter (although there is little difference in EXAFS spectra between the two samples).

We also conducted TA spectroscopy in order to investigate how the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers of NS-C3N4 changes with respect to the loading conditions of silver. Fig. 10 shows time courses of the transient absorption intensity of five samples (listed in Table 1) at 1800 cm−1, which results from shallowly trapped and/or free electrons generated in a semiconductor material.31 Compared to unmodified NS-C3N4, all of the silver-modified samples exhibited more pronounced decays, indicating that the photogenerated electrons in NS-C3N4 are able to move to the loaded silver species. This observation is consistent with that in our previous work using Ag-loaded mesoporous g-C3N4.22 Durrant et al. reported that transient absorption signals in the visible and NIR regions, derived from photogenerated electrons, decreased upon loading of Pt on carbon nitride.42 The electron-accepting nature of the loaded metal is consistent with our present study using silver species. Although some early reports claimed that Ag2O on C3N4 works exclusively as a hole collector,43–45 the present study clearly demonstrated that Ag2O-like species serve as electron traps similar to Ag0.
 Fig. 10  Decay curves of transient absorption intensity at 1800 cm−1 for silver-modified NS-C3N4 samples. Excitation: 355 nm (under vacuum). 
However, we stress here that there is no correlation between the decay behavior of each sample and the activity, although the relatively slow decay of the sample reduced at 623 K with H2 may account for the lowest activity among the tested materials (see Table 1). At present, we could not evaluate how electrons accumulating in the deposited silver species on NS-C3N4 transfer to RuP, because of technical difficulties. Therefore, electron transfer efficiency from the loaded species to RuP may differ with respect to the physicochemical state of the loaded silver species, thereby affecting the activity of the RuP/Ag/NS-C3N4 system. This is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
Conclusions
Nanoparticulate silver species are effective promoters for visible-light CO2 reduction on a hybrid photocatalyst constructed with a mononuclear Ru(II) complex (RuP) and C3N4. By varying the preparation conditions of silver loading on C3N4 nanosheets, the highest activity was obtained with a sample prepared by an impregnation and H2-reduction method at 473 K and 2.0 wt% Ag loading. The optimal photocatalyst gave the highest turnover number of formate generation (5700) among the mononuclear complex/semiconductor hybrids ever reported, while keeping the high selectivity (>90%) even for an extended period of reaction (96 h). EXAFS analyses and TEM observations revealed that the optimized photocatalyst contained highly dispersed Ag2O-like nanoparticles as the major silver species. Experimental results also indicated that Ag0 was more suitable as the promoter than Ag2O, if each particle size is similar. The results of this work thus suggested that the formation of highly dispersed Ag0 nanoparticles on C3N4 will be the key to achieve highly efficient visible-light CO2 reduction with RuP, although it still remains a challenge.
