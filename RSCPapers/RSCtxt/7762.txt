    , Accepted 14th October 2016First published on 18th October 2016AbstractThe combination of upconversion nanocrystals with a wide-bandgap semiconductor is an efficient strategy to develop near-infrared (NIR)-responsive photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of the hybrid structures is greatly determined by the efficiency of the energy transfer on the interface between upconversion nanocrystals and the semiconductor. In this work, we demonstrate the interface design of a NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl hybrid structure based on the choice of suitable BiOCl facets in depositing NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion nanocrystals. It was found that the selective deposition of NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals on the BiOCl(110) facet can greatly enhance the photocatalytic performance in dye degradation compared with the sample with NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals loaded on the BiOCl(001) facet. Two effects were believed to contribute to this enhancement: (1) a stronger UV emission absorption ability of the BiOCl(110) facet from NaYF4:Yb,Tm in generating more photo-induced charge carriers resulted from the narrower bandgap; (2) a shorter diffusion distance of photogenerated charge carriers to the BiOCl(110) reactive facet for surface catalytic reactions owing to the spatial charge separation between different facets. This work highlights the rational interfacial design of an upconversion nanocrystal–semiconductor hybrid structure for enhanced energy transfer in photocatalysis.
Introduction
Photocatalysis utilizing solar energy represents an economical, renewable and clean approach to alleviate steadily worsening environmental issues and the energy crisis.1–3 Since the discovery of photocatalytic water splitting on TiO2 electrodes by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, numerous types of semiconductor based photocatalysts have been synthesized and used for a wide range of applications such as wastewater treatment and air purification for environment protection, as well as water splitting and CO2 reduction for clean energy.4–8 However, one big limitation of semiconductor photocatalysis is the limited light absorption range of semiconductors.9,10 The semiconductor with a wide bandgap can only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light (wavelength (λ) < 400 nm), which accounts for a very small fraction (≈5%) of the solar spectrum. Therefore most photons from visible light (400 < λ < 780 nm, ≈43%) and near-infrared (NIR) light (780 < λ < 2500 nm, ≈52%) cannot be utilized, reducing the solar energy conversion efficiency for practical applications. While for a semiconductor with a narrower bandgap, the light absorption can be extended to the visible or NIR region, but the lower conductive band minimum (CBM) or higher valence band maximum (VBM) reduces the redox ability of the photocatalysts. Particularly, in contrast to UV- and visible-light-active photocatalysts, NIR-light-active semiconductor photocatalysts have rarely been reported with the reason that the bandgap of the corresponding semiconductor is too narrow to drive the necessary redox reactions, which has become a stumbling block on the way towards the development of full solar-light photocatalysts.11
Recently, the integration of NIR light sensitized components with wide-bandgap semiconductors has provided a new opportunity for the development of NIR-driven photocatalysts. For instance, in our previous report, Au nanocages with plasmonic absorption in the NIR region were loaded on the TiO2 nanosheets for NIR-driven water splitting photocatalysis through a “hot electron” injection from Au into the conductive band (CB) of TiO2, in which the high CBM of TiO2 ensures the high reduction ability of transferred electrons.12 However, in the case of the interfacial charge transfer mechanism, only the reduction or oxidation half reaction occurs on the semiconductor surface. Thus sacrificial agents have to be used as substituted electron acceptors or donors to make the other half reaction occur. A more promising method is the combination of upconversion nanocrystals with wide-bandgap semiconductors, in which upconversion nanocrystals act as a medium for converting NIR photons to UV photons to activate the semiconductor. The interfacial energy transfer process with the absorption of the radiative upconversion emission induces the formation of electron–hole pairs on the semiconductor for redox reactions.13–15 So far, many semiconductors including TiO2, ZnO, CdS and C3N4 have been combined with upconversion nanocrystals to construct the NIR-responsive photocatalysts for various reactions.16–19 In spite of the effort, the activities of the reported NIR upconversion photocatalysts remain low, mainly owing to the inefficient energy transfer process.
For multi-component hybrid photocatalysts, interface design is considered as an effective method to improve the photocatalytic performance.20 The upconversion nanocrystal–semiconductor structure is not an exception as the efficacy of interfacial energy transfer greatly determines the photocatalytic activity. In the interface design of the photocatalytic materials, the crystal facet of the semiconductor is an important parameter.21 Different facets not only possess varied surface electronic band structures for photon absorption, but also exhibit distinct capabilities in accumulating charge carriers for surface catalytic reactions.22,23 In this work, we report the facet engineered interface design of an upconversion nanocrystal–semiconductor structure with NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals and BiOCl nanoplates used as the upconversion and semiconductor model, respectively. In the design, NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals as light converters were deposited on the different facets of BiOCl nanoplates to form different NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl hybrid structures. It was found that different photon absorption abilities of different BiOCl facets result in different energy transfer efficiencies on different NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl interfaces. Furthermore, different charge accumulation abilities of different BiOCl facets lead to different migration distances of photogenerated charge carriers to reactive facets for surface catalytic reactions. As a result, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl hybrid structures exhibit different photocatalytic activities based on the different BiOCl facets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example highlighting the importance of the facet engineered interface design of upconversion nanocrystal–semiconductor hybrid structures for NIR photocatalysis.
Experimental
Chemicals
Octadecene (Aladdin, O109487), oleic acid (Aladdin, O108484), YCl3 (Aldrich, 451363), YbCl3 (Aldrich, 204870) and TmCl3 (Aldrich, 204668) were used in the synthesis. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The water used in all experiments was de-ionized (DI). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of BiOCl nanoplates
The BiOCl nanoplates were synthesized by modifying a method in the literature.24 In a typical synthesis, 0.486 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 25 ml of 0.1 M mannitol solution. The mixture was stirred for 10 min to completely dissolve Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, followed by the slow injection of 5 mL saturated NaCl aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a uniform white suspension. After another 10 min of agitation, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 3 h. After the autoclave had cooled down to room temperature, the resultant product was separated from the solution by centrifugation and washed with water several times. The final product was then dried at 45 °C for 12 h.
Preparation of β-NaYF4:Yb(20%),Tm(0.5%) nanocrystals
Monodisperse β-NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals were prepared with a protocol developed before.25 At the start, 0.8 mmol YCl3, 0.2 mmol YbCl3, and 0.005 mmol TmCl3 were mixed with 6 mL oleic acid and 15 mL octadecene in a 50 mL three-neck flask. The solution was heated at 160 °C to form a homogeneous solution and then cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently, 10 mL of a methanol solution containing 2.5 mmol NaOH and 4 mmol NH4F was added into the flask and stirred for 30 min. After this, the solution was slowly heated to remove methanol and degassed at 100 °C for 10 min. The flask was then heated at 300 °C and maintained at this temperature for 1 h under Ar protection. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the products were precipitated from the solution with ethanol and separated by centrifugation with a speed of 5000 rpm. The products were washed with cyclohexane and ethanol four times, and finally dispersed in cyclohexane with a concentration of around 0.1 M. The surface ligands on the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb,Tm samples were removed through acid treatment. In brief, 0.1 M of the oleate-capped NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals were dispersed in 30 mL of acidic ethanol solution (pH = 1) and ultrasonicated for 1 h to remove the oleate ligands. After the reaction was completed, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals were collected through centrifugation and further purified by adding an acidic ethanol solution (pH = 4). The resulting NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals were further washed with ethanol and water several times and re-dispersed in water.
Preparation of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl structure
In a typical synthesis, 100 μL of 0.1 M BiOCl nanoplates was dispersed in 20 mL ethanol through sonication. Then 100 μL of NaYF4:Yb,Tm solution (0.04 M) was added into the dispersion. The mixture was further sonicated for 5 min, transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and heated at 100 °C for 1 h. After the autoclave had cooled down to room temperature, the resultant product was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol several times. The final product was then dried at 45 °C for 12 h.
Preparation of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structure
In a typical synthesis, 100 μL of 0.1 M BiOCl nanoplates was dispersed in 20 mL ethanol through sonication. The solution was heated to 80 °C. Next, 0.2 g of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, K30) was added. The solution was kept at 80 °C under stirring for 1 h, and then collected by centrifugation, and washed with ethanol several times to remove excess PVP. The as-obtained PVP-capped BiOCl nanoplates were redispersed in 20 mL ethanol. The further deposition of NaYF4:Yb,Tm to form NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl was performed by following the same procedure as that for the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl structure.
Sample characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Y-4Q X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using nonmonochromatized Al-Kα X-ray as the excitation source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F field-emission high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Element composition of the samples was analyzed with a Thermo Scientific PlasmaQuad 3 inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance data were recorded in the spectral region of 220–1050 nm with a Cary-7000 Series UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a HITACHI F-7000 spectrofluorometer equipped with a commercial 980 nm NIR laser. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained with a JES-FA200 electron spin resonance spectrometer at 20 °C under NIR light irradiation.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
5.0 mg of the as-synthesized products were dispersed in a mixture of 10 μL ethanol and 10 μL Nafion, which were then uniformly spin dropped onto a 1 cm × 1 cm indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass by using a spin coater (SC-1B, China). Subsequently, the ITO-coated glass was heated at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. The photocurrents were measured on a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China) under ambient conditions under irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (Solaredge 700, China). NIR light was used as the illumination source, which was realized by using a 780 nm cutoff filter (long-wave-pass). The power density of NIR light was measured to be 18 mW cm−2. A standard three-electrode setup was used with the ITO coated glass as a photoelectrode, a Pt foil as a counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode. The three electrodes were inserted in a quartz cell filled with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte was purged with Ar for 30 min prior to the measurements. The photoresponse of the prepared photoelectrodes (i.e., I–t) was operated by measuring the photocurrent densities under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 60 s) at a bias potential of 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 400 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range of 10−1 to 105 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at a bias potential of 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
Photocatalytic measurements
Photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) solutions. Experiments were conducted as follows: 20 mg of photocatalyst was added to 50 mL of 2 × 10−5 mol L−1 RhB and MB aqueous solution, respectively. Prior to illumination, the mixed suspension was stirred for 12 h in the dark to reach adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then the stirred suspension was illuminated with a 300 W Xe lamp with a 780 nm long-wave-pass cut-off filter (i.e., λ > 780 nm). The power density of the NIR light was measured to be 18 mW cm−2. Upon turning on the light illumination, 2 mL aliquots of the suspension were taken every 20 min and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst for UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements (TU-1900 UV-vis spectrometer). The total reaction time was 160 min, and the concentration of RhB and MB was determined by monitoring its absorption peak at 553 nm and 664 nm, respectively. The simulated sunlight irradiation was realized in the absence of a cut-off filter. The light density was measured to be 100 mW cm−2. The degree of dye mineralization was monitored by analyzing the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the solutions with different irradiation times. In a typical experiment, 50 mL of an RhB solution (50 mg L−1) containing 200 mg of photocatalyst was irradiated with NIR light and analyzed using a Shimadzu TOC-VSCH analyzer. The photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) was performed by following the same procedure as in dye degradation except that Cr(VI) solution (20 mL of 10 mg L−1, pH: 1–2) was used and the total reaction time was 4 h with the suspension being taken every 1 h.
Results and discussion
Sample synthesis and characterization
The photocatalyst design begins with the choice of UV light excitable BiOCl nanoplates as a semiconductor model (Fig. 1a). The monocrystalline BiOCl nanoplates were synthesized via a hydrothermal route according to a literature procedure.24 The edge length of the nanoplates is in the range of 100 to 200 nm and the thickness is 20–30 nm (Fig. S1a and b†). According to its X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, the crystal structure of the BiOCl can be indexed to a tetragonal phase with the lattice parameters of a = 0.3891 nm and c = 0.7369 nm (JCPDS-06-0249) (Fig. 2). As revealed by the HRTEM images, the top and bottom flat surfaces of the BiOCl nanoplates are enclosed by the (001) facets while the four side faces are the (110) facets (Fig. S1c and d†). The percentage of the (001) facets on the surface is estimated to be ca. 75%. On the other hand, pure NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion nanocrystals were synthesized through a high-temperature heating method in organic solution.25 The as-synthesized nanocrystals were in uniform size with an average diameter of 20 nm (Fig. S2†). The hydrophobic surface of the above NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals was then converted to hydrophilic by removing the surface ligands through acid treatment. In the XRD pattern of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals, all the peaks can be indexed to hexagonal-phase β-NaYF4 crystals (JCPDS-16-0334) (Fig. 2). No peak from cubic-phase NaYF4 crystals was found, confirming the single-phase of the NaYF4.26

The as-obtained NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals can be facilely attached to the BiOCl nanoplates through simple sonication and further solvothermal treatment. Without any pretreatment of BiOCl nanoplates, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals can be assembled on the top and bottom flat (001) surfaces, resulting in the formation of a NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl hybrid structure with NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals supported by BiOCl nanoplates (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals were predominately deposited on the (001) top and bottom surfaces of BiOCl nanoplates, mainly owing to the high (001) surface coverage of the BiOCl nanoplates as well as their comparable thickness in comparison with the size of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1d shows the monocrystal nature of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm. The lattice spacing of 0.52 nm on the loaded nanocrystals can be assigned to the (100) plane of NaYF4, while the lattice spacing of 0.27 nm reveals the (001) plane on the flat surface of BiOCl nanoplates, confirming the formation of the interface between NaYF4:Yb,Tm and the BiOCl(001) facet. The interface could be clearly seen in the TEM image of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl with a standing-up BiOCl nanoplate (Fig. S3a†).
Meanwhile, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals can also be selectively attached to the side (110) planes of BiOCl nanoplates. The key to this selective attachment is the use of PVP as a capping agent (Fig. 1a). PVP is preferentially adsorbed onto the BiOCl(001), thus precluding the further loading of NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals on this facet.27 As shown in Fig. 1e and f, when the BiOCl nanoplates are firstly treated with PVP, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals are exclusively attached to the four side (110) faces of BiOCl nanoplates, forming NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystal-encircled BiOCl nanoplates (namely, NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl). As revealed by the HRTEM image (Fig. 1g), the lattice spacing of 0.52 nm on the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals is also indexed to the (100) plane of NaYF4 nanocrystals, while the lattice spacing of 0.27 nm on BiOCl reveals the (110) plane on the side surfaces of BiOCl nanoplates, further verifying the formation of an interface between NaYF4:Yb,Tm and BiOCl(110). The interface could be seen more clearly in the TEM image of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl with a standing-up BiOCl nanoplate (Fig. S3b†). In both the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl samples, the deposition of NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals on the BiOCl nanoplates is relatively uniform though some NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals connect with each other.
The phases of the as-obtained binary samples were characterized by XRD patterns (Fig. 2). For NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl samples, both the peaks of BiOCl and NaYF4 were shown, further confirming the combination of NaYF4:Yb,Tm with BiOCl nanoplates. It should be noted that in the XRD patterns of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl samples, some peaks of NaYF4 are extremely weak or nearly unobservable, which resulted from the much weaker peak intensity of bare NaYF4 in comparison with bare BiOCl as well as the much lower content of NaYF4 compared with that of BiOCl in the samples. The composition of the as-obtained NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structure was further verified by XPS, which indicates the Na, Y, F, Bi, O and Cl elements in the hybrid structure (Fig. S4†). The high-resolution spectrum of Bi 4f can be divided into two peaks at 158.8 and 164.1 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively (Fig. 3a).28 The O 1s peak at 530.0 eV is the characteristic peak of Bi–O bonds, and the additional peak at 532.3 eV can be ascribed to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups on the BiOCl surface (Fig. 3b). The Cl 2p spectrum is resolved into two peaks located at 198.5 and 200.1 eV, which are assigned to the binding energies of Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 3c). The high-resolution spectrum of Na 1s displays one characteristic peak at 1072.4 eV, while the F 1s peak is in the position of 684.9 eV (Fig. 3d and e). It should be noted that the Y 3d spectrum is overlapped by the peaks of Bi 4f and not shown here. Furthermore, the doping elements in the NaYF4 were also detected. The peaks at 175.6, 182.5 and 188.1 eV are attributed to the spectra of Tm 4d, Yb 4d5/2 and Yb 4d3/2, respectively (Fig. 3f). No distinct N 1s peak can be found in the XPS spectra, indicating that most of the PVP has been removed from the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl through subsequent centrifugation and washing processes. The XPS spectra of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl are also shown in Fig. S5.† It could be clearly seen that there is no obvious difference in the XPS spectra between NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl, confirming the same composition of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl samples.

Charge kinetics and photocatalytic performance analysis
To investigate the charge kinetics and photocatalytic performance of the samples, the loading amount of NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals in NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl hybrid structures was kept the same (ca. 17 wt% of NaYF4:Yb,Tm as determined by ICP-MS, Table S1†), so as to maintain the same amount of NaYF4:Yb,Tm to absorb the NIR light as well as the approximate interfacial area between NaYF4:Yb,Tm and BiOCl for energy transfer. UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra show that the BiOCl nanoplates exhibit light absorption in the UV region with an absorption edge at ca. 375 nm (Fig. 4a). The light absorption of BiOCl does not change upon the addition of NaYF4:Yb,Tm. However, an additional peak centered at 980 nm appeared in the spectra of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl structures, corresponding to the light absorption of NaYF4:Yb,Tm, which can be revealed by the absorption band of bare NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals in the same position.29 Furthermore, it could be clearly seen that the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structures exhibit comparable light absorption in both the UV and NIR light region. Note that the difference in the baseline of the absorption spectra between them may have resulted from the different scattering effects of NaYF4:Yb,Tm in different locations.30

The upconversion PL spectra of the samples under excitation at 980 nm wavelength are shown in Fig. 4b. One can see that no PL emission was observed in the BiOCl nanoplates, while for bare NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals, four upconversion peaks, namely two UV emissions and two blue emissions, can be observed in the spectra. The UV emissions centered at 346 nm and 362 nm are attributed to the 1I6 → 3F4 and 1D2 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, while the two blue emissions located at 452 nm and 476 nm can be assigned to the 1D2 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively.18,29,31 Then the strong UV emissions obtained in NaYF4:Yb,Tm upon NIR excitation can be used to realize the NIR-driven photocatalysis of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl structures. With the further loading of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals on the BiOCl nanoplates, notable spectral differences can be observed in the upconversion emission of NaYF4:Yb,Tm. The emission intensities of 452 and 476 nm decrease slightly in comparison with the that of the bare NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals, resulting from the shielding effect of BiOCl, whereas those centered at 346 and 362 nm decrease significantly, indicating that the UV photon energy generated via the upconversion process of NaYF4:Yb,Tm has been absorbed by the BiOCl supporters via an energy transfer process. More importantly, obvious weaker emission centered at 349 and 362 nm was observed for NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl in comparison with that of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl, though the two structures exhibit a comparable emission intensity at 452 and 474 nm, revealing that the BiOCl nanoplates can absorb more UV photons from NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals in the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structure.
The charge kinetics of the samples was further analyzed through photoelectrochemical measurement. Given the comparable capability of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl samples in absorbing NIR light, the photocurrent measurements are believed to offer an informative evaluation for the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs. Fig. 4c shows the photocurrents of the samples under NIR light irradiation (λ > 780 nm). It could be seen that BiOCl nanoplates and NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals barely generate photocurrent. While distinct photocurrents have been observed for NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structures, suggesting that the BiOCl nanoplates can be excited by the UV photon generated via the upconversion process of NaYF4:Yb,Tm under NIR light irradiation. Moreover, the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl exhibits an apparently larger photocurrent response in comparison with that of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl, revealing that more electrons and holes were generated and separated in NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl. This is further reflected in the EIS (Fig. 4d), in which the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl shows a smaller arc radius compared with that of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl under NIR light irradiation, indicating that the lower charge-transfer resistance resulted from the generation and transfer of more photo-induced charge carriers.
To demonstrate the photocatalytic performance of the samples, the photodegradation of dye pollutants (RhB and MB) was measured under NIR light (λ > 780 nm) as model reactions. Through monitoring the characteristic absorption of RhB (553 nm) and MB (664 nm) at given intervals, the activity of the samples can be evaluated. As shown in Fig. S6 and S7,† the characteristic absorption peak of RhB and MB decreases with the increasing light irradiation time. The photocatalytic activity can be evaluated by the degradation rates of RhB and MB over different samples. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, BiOCl nanoplates and NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the degradation of both dyes. While obvious photocatalytic activity was observed for NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl samples, implying that the design of the upconversion nanocrystal–semiconductor structures can realize the NIR-driven photocatalytic reactions. Similarly to the photocurrent results, the photocatalytic activity of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl is obviously higher than that of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl, implying that the facet of BiOCl nanoplates in the formation of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl interface is crucial to their photocatalytic activities. For both NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl, the deposited NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals are maintained well on the BiOCl facets after the photocatalytic process (Fig. S8†). As a result, the designed NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl sample with superior photocatalytic activity also exhibits excellent photocatalytic stability in the degradation of dyes. As shown in Fig. S9,† there is no obvious decrease in the degradation rate after three cycles of photocatalytic reaction. The excellent NIR-responsive photocatalytic performance of the designed NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl is also confirmed by the higher average RhB degradation rate (7.63 × 10−3gRhBgcat−1 h−1) in comparison with that (8.33 × 10−4gRhBgcat−1 h−1) of the recently reported NaYF4:Yb,Tm/carbon nitride photocatalyst.32 The higher NIR-driven catalytic activity also contributes to the superior photocatalytic behavior of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl in RhB degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation compared with those of bare BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl (Fig. S10†). According to the TOC analyses, the mineralization degree of the RhB by NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl was about 52% after 72 h of NIR light irradiation (initial RhB concentration: 50 mg L−1), indicating that not only the chromophore group but also the aromatic rings in the RhB molecules are attacked during the photocatalytic reaction.

Photocatalytic mechanism study
To further analyze the mechanism of the above experimental results, the active species involved in the photocatalytic reaction process are identified by the hole and free radical trapping experiment. The tertiary butanol (t-BuOH), ammonium oxalate (AO) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) were used as scavengers to detect the hydroxyl radical (˙OH), hole (h+) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−), respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, the photocatalytic activity of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl in the degradation of RhB decreases slightly with the addition of the BQ, but reduces significantly by the addition of AO and t-BuOH, suggesting that h+ and ˙OH are the main oxidative species for the degradation of dyes in the photocatalytic reactions. Similar result is also obtained for NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl, which is in accordance with the previous report on BiOCl photocatalysts (Fig. S11†).33

To further examine the amount of reactive oxygen species involved in photocatalytic processes with NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl as catalysts, the ESR technique was employed with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping agent. As presented in Fig. 6b, the ESR signals with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 were clearly displayed for the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl samples under NIR light irradiation, which are the characteristics for ˙OH radicals.34 Notably, the ESR signals of ˙OH radicals for NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl show significantly higher intensities than those for NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl at the same illumination time, suggesting that more reactive species generated in NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl, which accounts for the enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Then the next question is why NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl can generate more reactive species for superior photocatalytic reactions. It is well known that the ˙OH radicals are mainly generated via the hydroxide oxidation by the h+. Thus different generation and separation abilities of photo-induced holes may be the fundamental reason for the interfacial facet-dependent photocatalytic performance. In our previous report,35 the different band levels of the (001) and (110) facets of BiOCl nanoplates have been found. The VBM of the (110) facet is about 0.36 eV higher than that of the (001) facet, while the CBM of the (001) facet is ca. 0.08 eV lower than that of the (110) facet (Fig. S12†). As a result, charge spatial separation between the (001) and (110) facets could be achieved in BiOCl with photogenerated electrons and holes migrating toward the (001) and (110) facets, respectively. Namely, the (110) facet is the location where holes are accumulated for dye degradation reactions.35,36 Additionally, the bandgap (Eg) of the (110) facet is ca. 0.28 eV narrower than that of the (001) facet. Thus the (110) facet exhibits stronger UV emission absorption from NaYF4:Yb,Tm in comparison with the (001) facet as a facet can only absorb the photons with an energy equal to or greater than its Eg.35 It should be noted that as the BiOCl(110) facet is the location for the dye oxidation reactions, any residual PVP adsorbed on the (001) facet can barely affect the photocatalytic performance of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl.
On the basis of the above results, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl samples in the dye degradation under NIR light is illustrated in Fig. 7. Firstly, the NIR light including 980 nm excited only the Yb3+ ions in NaYF4:Yb,Tm, and three successive energy transfers from Yb3+ to Tm3+ populate the 3H5, 3F2, and 1G4 levels of Tm3+ (Fig. 7a).18,29,31 Because of the large energy mismatch (about 3500 cm−1), the 1D2 level of Tm3+ cannot be populated by the fourth photon from Yb3+via the energy transfer process to the 1G4. The population of the 1D2 level may be realized by two cross relaxation processes: 3F2 + 3H4 → 3H6 + 1D2 and 1G4 + 3H4 → 3F4 + 1D2. On the other hand, the 1D2 state may be promoted to the 3P2 state via another energy transfer from excited Yb3+, and then nonradiatively relax to the 1I6 level. After that, the excited Tm3+ ions fall to lower energy levels: 1I6 → 3F4, 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6, leading to emission at 346 nm, 362 nm, 452 nm and 476 nm, respectively (Fig. 4b). Then the UV emissions (346 and 362 nm) from the NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals can be absorbed by the BiOCl nanoplates through an interfacial energy transfer process.
 Fig. 7  (a) Diagrams of the energy levels and energy/charge transfer in NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl, (b, c) schematic illustrating the NIR-driven photocatalytic mechanism in (b) NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and (c) NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl, respectively. ET is the abbreviation of “energy transfer”. 
For different NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl hybrid structures, different energy transfer processes could occur on different interfaces. In the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl structure, the UV emissions are absorbed by the (001) facet of BiOCl nanoplates. The BiOCl(001) facet with a wider Eg exhibits a poorer UV emission absorption ability from NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals, leading to a lower energy transfer efficiency on the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl interface in generating less photo-induced electron–hole pairs (Fig. 7a). Furthermore, according to the facet dependent spatial charge separation, the holes generated on the (001) facets transfer to the (110) facet in participating in the photocatalytic dye degradation reactions through a long migration distance, inevitably resulting in serious hole loss owing to the electron–hole recombination (Fig. 7b). In contrast, resulting from the narrower Eg of the BiOCl(110) facet in absorbing more UV photons, the efficiency of the energy transfer on the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl interface is much higher (Fig. 7a). Moreover, the holes generated on the (110) facet directly participate in the photocatalytic oxidation reactions, thus the hole loss in the bulk diffusion is reduced in the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl (Fig. 7c). As a result, the higher efficiency of interfacial energy transfer as well as the shorter distance of hole migration contribute to the superior photocatalytic performance of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl.
Considering that the BiOCl(110) plane is a better selection for the deposition of NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals, BiOCl nanosheets with the dominant (110) facet were also synthesized and then loaded with NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals to form a hybrid structure, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in the degradation of RhB under NIR light irradiation (Fig. S13†).37 It should be noted that the facet engineered interface design here is mainly suitable for hole-driven photocatalytic oxidation reactions. As shown in Fig. S14a,† the advantage of NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl over NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) is not obvious in comparison with that in the dye degradation reactions, mainly resulting from the different photocatalytic mechanism in the electron-driven reaction (Fig. S14b†).38
Conclusions
In summary, interface design of a NaYF4:Yb,Tm–BiOCl hybrid structure was performed based on choosing suitable BiOCl facets in depositing NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion nanocrystals for enhanced NIR photocatalytic performance. The NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals were selectively deposited on the (001) and (110) facets to form NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl and NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structures, respectively. In comparison with the BiOCl(001) facet, the BiOCl(110) facet exhibits stronger absorption of UV emission from NaYF4:Yb,Tm owing to the narrower bandgap, leading to the higher energy transfer efficiency on the NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl interface in generating more photo-induced charge carriers on the (110) facet. Furthermore, resulting from the facet-dependent spatial charge separation in BiOCl, the diffusion distance of the photo-induced holes to the reactive (110) facet is greatly reduced in NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl compared with NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl, contributing to a lessened hole loss. As a result, the designed NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(110)BiOCl structure exhibits higher NIR-responsive photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB and MB in comparison with NaYF4:Yb,Tm–(001)BiOCl. This work represents an important advancement towards interface engineering on upconversion nanocrystal–semiconductor photocatalysts.
