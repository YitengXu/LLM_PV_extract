    , Accepted 19th January 2019First published on 21st January 2019AbstractIndacenodithiophene (IDT) is a promising building block for designing organic semiconductors. In this work, a new decacyclic building block (m-IDTIDT) with a double IDT unit and meta-alkyl-phenyl substitutions was synthesized and used for designing a new non-fullerene electron acceptor (m-IDTIDT-FIC). Compared to p-IDTIDT-IC, m-IDTIDT-FIC has a smaller π–π distance, larger crystalline coherence length, and higher electron mobility. Thus, polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC can achieve a higher PCE (8.27%) than PCE10:p-IDTIDT-IC-based PSCs (6.48%). In addition, PSCs based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC show better photovoltaic performances than PSCs based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC. This is because the J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend film has more balanced charge transport ability, a smooth surface, and higher relative domain purity than the PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend film. PSCs based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC exhibited the best photovoltaic performances with a PCE of 11.32%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 18.01 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.30%. These results indicate that m-IDTIDT with meta-alkyl-phenyl substitutions is a promising IDT-based building block for high-performance non-fullerene electron acceptors.
Introduction
Polymer solar cell (PSC) technology is considered to be one of the most promising energy technologies because of its low cost, light weight, flexibility, and feasibility of roll-to-roll panels.1–3 A general PSC usually has a bulk hetero-junction structure formed by an electron donor and an electron acceptor. In the last decades, PSCs using fullerene or fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor have made great progress with the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching ∼11%.4 However, fullerene-type electron acceptors have several serious drawbacks such as complicated synthesis, a low light absorption coefficient, and poor tunability in energy levels, which impede further development of fullerene-based PSCs. On the other hand, non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) as alternatives for conventional fullerene compounds have experienced rapid development in the past three years and the maximum PCEs have surpassed 14% for single-junction cells and 17% for double-junction tandem cells.5–10 By combining an electron-donating backbone, generally bearing multiple fused rings, with electron-withdrawing units, we can facilely construct acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type NFAs. Versatile molecular structures have been developed using methods such as acceptor motif engineering11–17 and donor motif engineering.18–30 However, there are only a few electron-donating backbones that have been proved successful. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop promising building blocks to further enrich the structural diversity.
An indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit with just five fused rings has a sufficiently rigid coplanar structure, which has been regarded as one of the promising electron-rich units to design high-performance A–D–A NFAs.31–33 In 2016, our group designed and synthesized a new ladder-type unit p-IDTIDT with a fused 10-heterocyclic-ring core, which can be regarded as a double IDT unit (Fig. 1). This work first disclosed that the NFA system is able to achieve low energy loss and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) simultaneously.34 Although the photovoltaic performance of devices based on PCE10:p-IDTIDT-IC was much better than that of PCE10:IDT-IC, the PCE of p-IDTIDT-IC (6.48%) was still unsatisfactory because of its morphology issue and a small driving force between PCE10 and p-IDTIDT-IC, resulting in a low short-circuit current (Jsc, 14.49 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF, 47.5%).
 Fig. 1  Molecular design of m-IDTIDT-FIC. 
Since extending the backbones by fusing more aromatic rings in NFAs may further improve the light absorption ability and charge mobility, we further performed side-chain engineering on the 10-heterocyclic-ring core with meta-alkyl-phenyl substitutions. This meta-alkyl-phenyl substitution, instead of the traditional para-alkyl-phenyl substitution, enhances the solubility, increases the intermolecular π–π stacking interaction, and more importantly, may change the blend morphology, leading to smaller crystal domains.35–38 To further extend the absorption and increase the driving force,10,39 the m-IDTIDT core was end-capped by two 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (FIC) units to give a novel NFA m-IDTIDT-FIC. A comparative study between m-IDTIDT-FIC and p-IDTIDT-IC was carried out with the polymer donor PCE10. Compared to PCE10:p-IDTIDT-IC, the PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC-based device shows an increased PCE (8.27% vs. 6.48%), Jsc (15.68 mA cm−2vs. 14.49 mA cm−2) and FF (66.27% vs. 47.50%), but a decreased Voc (0.80 V vs. 0.94 V). In addition, J71 was paired with m-IDTIDT-FIC to further boost the performance by extending the absorption. The optimized device exhibits a PCE = 11.32% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 18.01 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.30%, respectively.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
Synthetic routes of m-IDTIDT-FIC are shown in Scheme 1. Key intermediates 1 and 2 were synthesized according to our previous work.34 Then 3-hexylphenyl was introduced into compound 2 via a nucleophilic reaction, followed by intramolecular cyclization, which afforded m-IDTIDT in 60% yield in two steps. m-IDTIDT-CHO was synthesized using the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction using dimethylformamide (DMF) and phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) with 95% yield. Finally, m-IDTIDT-FIC was obtained via Knoevenagel condensation with 72% yield. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF analyses of these compounds are shown in the ESI.† Thermal properties of m-IDTIDT-FIC were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis and a differential scanning calorimeter (see Fig. S1a and b†). m-IDTIDT-FIC has a high decomposition temperature (Td, 330 °C) and glass transition temperature (Tg, 250 °C), which suggest that m-IDTIDT-FIC has a good thermal stability.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of m-IDTIDT-FIC. 
As shown in Fig. 2a, m-IDTIDT-FIC shows maximum UV-vis absorption at 716 nm in dichloromethane with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 2.26 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is slightly larger than that of p-IDTIDT-IC (2.01 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Meanwhile, in the film state, m-IDTIDT-FIC exhibits 20 nm redshifted absorption in contrast to p-IDTIDT-IC, which is due to the stronger intermolecular aggregation interaction by introducing the meta-alkyl-phenyl substitution (Fig. 2c). The optical band gaps (Egopt) of p-IDTIDT-IC and m-IDTIDT-FIC calculated from their absorption edge are 1.53 eV and 1.51 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of m-IDTIDT-FIC were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene as the reference. As shown in Fig. 2d and S2,† the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of m-IDTIDT-FIC were estimated to be −5.47 and −3.94 eV, respectively (detailed values are summarized in Table 1). Notably, m-IDTIDT-FIC shows a deeper EHOMO and ELUMO compared with p-IDTIDT-IC, which is due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the F atom.10,39 The lower EHOMO leads to an increased driving force between the PCE10 and m-IDTIDT-FIC, thus facilitating the charge dissociation and separation.

To investigate the geometric structure and electronic properties of m-IDTIDT-FIC, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level were performed (methyl group was used to simplify the calculations). Similar to p-IDTIDT-IC, m-IDTIDT-FIC also shows a good planar rigid backbone structure with the electron wave functions of HOMO and LUMO distributed over the whole backbone (Fig. S3†). This high degree of electron delocalization in m-IDTIDT-FIC may contribute to its higher charge mobility, thus beneficial for improving the solar cell performance. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of p-IDTIDT-IC and m-IDTIDT-FIC are calculated to be −5.13/−3.13 eV and −5.26/−3.29 eV, respectively, which are consistent with values estimated from experiments.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)40 was performed to investigate the molecular packing of neat p-IDTIDT-IC and m-IDTIDT-FIC films (Fig. 3). Neat films of p-IDTIDT-IC and m-IDTIDT-FIC show strong π–π stacking (010) reflections at qz = 1.46 Å−1 and 1.50 Å−1, respectively, indicating a smaller π–π stacking distance for the m-IDTIDT-FIC film. In addition, the out-of-plane (010) π–π coherence lengths (CLs) of these two films calculated via peak fitting show that the m-IDTIDT-FIC film exhibits a larger CL of 1.15 nm compared to that of p-IDTIDT-IC (0.94 nm). The smaller π–π stacking distance and larger CL of m-IDTIDT-FIC would contribute better charge mobility. This higher degree of crystallinity of m-IDTIDT-FIC is probably due to the smaller steric hindrance of the meta-alkyl-phenyl substitutions and stronger H–F interactions.

Photovoltaic performances
OPVs were fabricated with the device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC/PDINO/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PDINO act as a buffer layer for the anode and cathode, respectively. The devices based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC were optimized under different conditions, such as D/A ratios, solvents, and thermal annealing, as shown in Tables S1 and S2.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC (1:1.5) blends are plotted in Fig. 4a, with a summary of device performance in Table 2. Compared to p-IDTIDT-IC, the m-IDTIDT-FIC based device shows an increased Jsc (15.68 mA cm−2vs. 14.49 mA cm−2) and FF (66.27% vs. 47.50%), but a decreased Voc (0.80 V vs. 0.94 V). The higher Jsc is due to absorption deeper into the NIR region for m-IDTIDT-FIC and the improved FF is due to both the increased blend crystallization and driving force between the PCE10 and m-IDTIDT-FIC. However, the deeper LUMO energy level of m-IDTIDT-FIC results in its lower Voc. Therefore, the optimized devices comprising PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC show PCE = 8.27% with more than a 28% enhancement in the PCE. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 4b; the m-IDTIDT-FIC-based device shows higher EQE values in the range of 700–850 nm than the p-IDTIDT-IC-based device, which is consistent with the higher Jsc of the m-IDTIDT-FIC-based device obtained from the IV measurement, and the integrated Jsc (15.40 mA cm−2) is within 2% mismatch of the solar simulation measurement.

Since PCE10 shows weak absorption below 500 nm, J71 was paired with m-IDTIDT-FIC to cover the whole solar spectrum to further boost the performance. The devices based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC were optimized under different conditions, such as D/A ratios, solvents, additives, and thermal annealing, as shown in Tables S3–S5.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are plotted in Fig. 4c, with the detailed device parameters summarized in Table 2. The optimized devices for J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC were spin-coated from chloroform solution mixed with a 1:1.5 donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio. The highest PCE of 11.32% was achieved for the J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC-based device under simulated AM1.5G, one sun solar illumination with a Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 18.01 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.30%, respectively. The significant improvement in Jsc for the J71 based device is attributed to its strong solar spectral response at the range of 400–600 nm. The higher Voc is contributed to by the lower HOMO energy level of the J71 compared to that of PCE10. The IPCE of the J71 OPV reaches 70% between 400 nm and 600 nm, which is greatly increased compared to that of the PCE10 device (Fig. 4d). The integrated Jsc (17.80 mA cm−2) is within 2% mismatch of the solar simulation measurement. Notably, after thermal annealing, devices based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC and J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC both have a higher PCE with a large increase of Jsc and FF due to their increased IPCE values in the whole spectrum.
Charge generation, transport, and recombination
The charge generation, exciton dissociation and charge collection properties of the optimized devices based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC and J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC were investigated through measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 5a and c). Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the photocurrent density while JD is the dark current density. The effective voltage Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias. When Jph reached saturation (Jsat) at a large reverse bias (Veff = 2 V), all of the photogenerated excitons were dissociated into free carriers and collected by electrodes. The Jsat values of the device with and without thermal annealing are 15.82 and 14.57 mA cm−2 for PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC, and 18.01 and 16.89 mA cm−2 for J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC, respectively. Thus, devices after thermal annealing show a higher Jsat. These results indicate that thermal annealing is beneficial to generate more excitons. P(E,T) was also calculated to investigate the process of exciton dissociation. P(E,T) is determined using P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat. Under the short-circuit condition, the P(E,T) values are 99.0% and 92.2% for the devices based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC, and 99.3% and 95.4% for the devices based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC, with and without thermal annealing, respectively. The results indicate that thermal annealing enables the PSCs based on the m-IDTDIDT-FIC acceptor to have more efficient exciton dissociation.

The Jscversus light intensity of the optimized devices was also investigated to explore the effects of thermal annealing on charge recombination. Jsc and P have a relation of Jsc ∝ Pα. If the device has a negligible bimolecular recombination, the power-law exponent (α) value will be close to 1.41 From Fig. 5b and d, the observed α values are 0.985 and 0.991 for devices based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC, and 0.940 and 0.970 for devices based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC, without and with 150 °C annealing, respectively. These results suggest that thermal annealing helps prevent the bimolecular recombination.
The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the neat m-IDTIDT-FIC film and blend films were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4 and Table S6†). The μe of m-IDTIDT-FIC is 2.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is five times higher than the μe of p-IDTIDT-IC (5.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher electron mobility agrees well with the GIWAXS data for these neat films. Moreover, it is noted that thermal annealing can increase the hole and electron mobility of both PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC and J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend films. The μh/μe of the optimized J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC film is obtained as 0.92 (1.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas for the optimized PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC film, its corresponding μh/μe is 2.27 (5.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This better-balanced charge transport ability inside the optimized J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC film partly accounts for the higher Jsc and higher FF of PSCs based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC.
Morphology characterization
The morphologies of PCE10:p-IDTIDT-IC (1:1.5, w/w) and J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC (1:1.5, w/w) blend films were first investigated by GIWAXS (Fig. 6). Detailed related data and GIWAXS patterns of the polymer donor PCE10 and the J71 film are shown in Table S7 and Fig. S5.† After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 2 min, the polymer donor (PCE10 and J71) and the small electron acceptor (m-IDTIDT-FIC) in PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC or J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend films exhibit stronger diffraction intensities, which suggest better molecular packing for the annealed blend films. For the J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend film, the q of the polymer J71 shifts to a much higher value in the (010) direction corresponding to a smaller π–π distance and a larger CCL than the PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend film. These results indicate that J71 has more compact molecular packing when blended with m-IDTIDT-FIC, which also accounts for the higher FF and PCE of PSCs based on m-IDTIDT-FIC.

To further investigate the domain spacing and standard deviation of the NFA concentration, σ, (monotonically related to the domain purity of the polymer-rich mixed domains), resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS)42 was also performed (Fig. 6f). Under the assumption of a globally isotropic 3D morphology, σ is proportional to the square root of the normalized integrated scattering intensity (ISI). Annealed devices show improved σ (contributing to a higher FF)43,44 and a slightly reduced domain spacing (contributing to a higher Jsc)43,44 compared to the as-cast ones. The domain sizes (approximately half of the domain spacing) of PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC and J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC after thermal annealing at 150 °C are calculated to be 14.9 and 13.1 nm, respectively. Because the efficient exciton diffusion length is generally 10–20 nm, the domain sizes of m-IDTIDT-FIC based films are beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation. Besides, the relative standard deviations of the NFA concentration of the optimized PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC and J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend films are calculated to be 0.96 and 1, respectively. The higher σ of the J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend film contributes to its smaller bimolecular recombination and better charge transport. Thus, J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC-based PSCs can achieve a higher FF, higher Jsc and higher PCE.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of blends are shown in Fig. S6 and S7;† annealed blend films show increased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness. After thermal annealing, the J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC (1:1.5, w/w) blend shows a RMS of 0.57 nm, compared with the 1.04 nm for PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC (1:1.5, w/w). The TEM images of the blend films all show homogeneous and interpenetrating networks, which are beneficial for efficient charge transport.
Conclusions
In summary, a new non-fullerene electron acceptor (m-IDTIDT-FIC) based on a 10-fused ring with meta-alkyl-phenyl substitutions and F-modification was synthesized and its properties and use in devices were investigated. Compared with p-IDTIDT-IC, m-IDTIDT-FIC shows a higher molar absorption coefficient, smaller π–π distance, larger coherence length and higher electron mobility. Therefore, solar cells based on PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC can achieve better photovoltaic performances with a PCE of 8.27%, which is 28% higher than that of the PCE10:p-IDTIDT-IC cell. Moreover, J71 was paired with m-IDTIDT-FIC to cover the whole solar spectrum to further boost the performance. And the J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend film shows more balanced charge transport ability, a smooth surface, smaller (010) π–π distance and higher relative domain purity than the PCE10:m-IDTIDT-FIC blend. Thus, the optimized device based on J71:m-IDTIDT-FIC can obtain a higher PCE of 11.32% with a Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.92 V, 18.01 mA cm−2 and 68.30%, respectively. These results suggest that m-IDTIDT is a promising multi-fused ladder-type backbone to design low-bandgap non-fullerene electron acceptors. And meta-alkyl-phenyl substitution or fluorination can be an easy but efficient method to modify NFAs for achieving higher device performances.
