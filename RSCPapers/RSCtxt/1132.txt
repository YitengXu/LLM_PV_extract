    , Accepted 7th June 2019First published on 10th June 2019AbstractIlmenite-structured Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution thin films have been deposited on FTO glass substrates by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) using a 1:1:2 homogenous mixture of nickel(II) acetate monohydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·H2O), anhydrous manganese(II) acetate (Mn(CH3COO)2) and titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(O(CH2)3CH3)4) in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent. Thin films prepared at 575, 600 and 625 °C were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), FT-Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which demonstrated the development of single phase hexagonal microspherical objects of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 clusters with precise stoichiometry. A direct optical band gap energy of 2.42, 2.06, and 1.70 eV for thin films fabricated at 575, 600, and 625 °C, respectively, was estimated by UV-vis spectrophotometry. The Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 photoanode deposited at 625 °C for 45 minutes yielded a photocurrent density of 2.05 mA cm−2 at +0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl using a 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) as compared to the films grown at 575 and 600 °C and studied under similar conditions. The charge transfer dynamics of the thin films were also explored using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The Mullikan charge population calculated through density functional theory (DFT) studies carried out at the B3LYP 6-31G(d,p) level for the [Ti2O6]4− unit of ilmenite determined the highest negative charge on the O atom. The frontier molecular orbital energies (EHOMO and ELUMO) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis gave a band gap value of 2.03 eV, complementing the experimental results. Band structure analysis of the [Ti2O6]4− slab showed that the valence band and conduction band are comprised of O 2s, O 2p and Ti 3d orbitals. The results of the present investigation point towards the possibility of an ilmenite form of transition metal oxides as a potential broad spectrum visible light absorbing photocatalyst for solar driven water splitting.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under UV-vis light is expected to be an ideal green technology for hydrogen energy production from water.1–4 Studies to date, though, have indicated that the water splitting performance of pure TiO2 is not truly competitive, substantially limited by its wide band gap (3.0–3.2 eV), low exploitation of solar energy (∼5%), kinetically sluggish electron–hole separation and transportation efficiency.5–8 Continuous efforts are being made to resolve these problems and to make solar photocatalytic hydrogen production9–11 feasible by establishing its composites (Fe2O3–TiO2,12 BiVO4–TiO2,13 SnO2–TiO2,14 CeO2–TiO215etc.) and solid solutions (SrTi1−x(Cr,M)xO3 (M = Nb/Ta),16 Sr1−xCrxTiO3,17 La2(Ti1−xMx)2O7 (M = Cr, Fe),18 In6NiTi6O2219etc.). There are several other highly efficient reproducible materials with a layer structure that show enhanced photocatalytic and improved interfacial properties.20 Among the various classes of compounds studied, titanium based perovskite and ilmenite photocatalysts21 of general formula ABO3 (A = Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Ca2+ and B = Ti4+) show unique photophysical properties and offer distinct advantages, for example excellent stability, non-toxicity and low cost. NiTiO3 is reported to be highly stable under light illumination and in oxidizing environments, which are crucial for photocatalysis applications.22 However, due to its narrow band gap energy (2.1 eV), a low quantum efficiency is observed when using it as a single phase photocatalyst. MnTiO3 has been already considered as a material for photoelectrochemical applications23 and its band gap (3.2 eV) should be sufficient to enable absorption in the visible range and potential water splitting. Recently, a ternary metal oxide system as a potentially excellent photocatalyst has attracted much attention because the ternary system can propose more possibilities in tuning the band gap and band positions. Only limited studies have been conducted for the use of complex metal oxides in photoelectrochemical water splitting. There is, therefore, a need to develop transition metal incorporating semiconductor materials for this purpose.
Generally, in the crystal structure of an ABO3 ilmenite-type oxide, different metal ions occupy one sublattice.24 The ilmenite structure can be considered as an ordered corundum structure with M2+ and Ti4+ cations in alternating layers perpendicular to the trigonal c-axis of the unit cell. Both cations are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen and within each layer these octahedra share edges, so that band formation is possible.25 The thermal stability of ABO3 type oxides can be enhanced by forming a solid solution of different oxides of the same structure.26 Multiple ilmenites could accommodate different divalent, trivalent or tetravalent cations at the A or/and B sites, taking a general form such as AA′B2O6, A2BB′O6 and A3BB′2O9etc. Accommodation of different transition metal cations at the A and B sites alters the photophysical properties of the compound significantly. An appropriate crystal lattice and a feasible large number of photocatalytic sites make ternary oxides more proficient than binary oxide systems. The electronic and physicochemical properties of the host lattice can be modified by the incorporation of metal atoms in the host lattice. In this way it may be possible to introduce a cationic valence band (M2+) in the too large band gap between the cationic conduction band (Ti4+) and the anionic valence band (O2−) already present. Consequently, the resulting solid solution offers a possibility of combining the elements from ‘narrow gap’ and ‘wide gap’ binary compounds to exploit the properties of both types of oxides, and therefore is potentially useful as a UV-vis light photocatalyst. Transition metal doped ilmenite semiconductors have found a wide range of applications as dielectric,27,28 piezoelectric,29 pyroelectric,30 optoelectrical,31 gas-sensing,32 lithium ion battery33,34 and photocatalyst semiconductors for PEC water splitting.35,36
Various physical and chemical techniques have been adopted for the fabrication of titanium oxide thin films,23,37–42 nevertheless based on our previous experience we chose the AACVD technique. The thin films produced by AACVD afford adhesive, inexpensive, reproducible films with low impurity levels. They ensure excellent film uniformity, high deposition rates, controllability of the film microstructure and scalability.43 Further, we found that the trifluoroacetato ligand has a strong tendency to replace the relatively weaker acetate ligand in metal acetates to form trifluoro complexes that have matching solubility and thermal properties suitable for their conversion to metal oxides. Herein, we treated (Ni(CH3COO)2·H2O), (Mn(CH3COO)2) and (Ti(O(CH2)3CH3)4) with TFA in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to convert them into the respective metal trifluoroacetates and utilized this homogeneous mixture for the fabrication of well adhered and uniform Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution thin films (the A3A′3B6O18 ilmenite system) on FTO substrates applying AACVD at different temperatures of 575, 600, and 625 °C. The crystallinity, phase orientation, stoichiometry, surface morphology, optical properties and oxidation states of the involved atoms were studied by powder-XRD, EDX, FESEM, UV-vis spectrophotometery and XPS, respectively. The scope of these thin film electrodes towards PEC for the generation of photoelectric current was studied by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) and the charge transfer dynamics of the thin films were investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. Furthermore, energetic parameters such as the total energy (Etot), energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), the energy gap (ΔE) and the Mulliken charge distribution were determined from periodic density functional (DFT) simulations. Full natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was carried out in order to have an insight into the splitting of d-orbitals based on energies, the occupancy of the orbitals and the distribution of electron density in the molecular orbitals. The fundamental electronic structure of the [Ti2O6]4− unit of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 is rarely considered for water splitting, so its theoretical investigations along with experimental study might provide rational answers to comprehend the optical and electronic relationship. Additionally, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of the use of the AACVD method for the preparation, characterization and PEC studies of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution thin films from a multiple source homogenous solution.
Results and discussion
A soft solution chemistry approach was adopted in which nickel(II) acetate, manganese(II) acetate, titanium(IV) butoxide and trifluoroacetic acid were mixed in THF solution. The exchange of acetate and butoxy with a stronger chelating bonding TFA ligand produced a homogenized solution of the respective metal trifluoroacetaes. All preparations were executed under an inert atmosphere of dry argon using a Schlenk tube connected to a vacuum line. The resulting homogenous mixture was used to fabricate Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 on FTO coated glass substrates by the AACVD method at different temperatures of 575, 600, and 625 °C. We have carried out comprehensive experiments and periodic density functional theory (DFT) simulations to understand the nature of the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution. Finally, these findings will be useful to get an insight into designing an appropriate approach for improved PEC performance.
Powder X-ray diffraction studies
The phase and crystallinity of the thin films deposited at three different temperatures of 575, 600, and 625 °C for 45 minutes on FTO coated glass substrates have been analyzed by powder-XRD analysis and the resultant crystalline diffraction patterns as a function of substrate temperature are overlaid in Fig. 1. The relative intensities and observed reflection positions (Fig. 1) agree well with the standard Crystallography Open Database (COD) no. [96-900-7386] and identify the growth of single phase Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 as a crystalline product. Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 exhibits a hexagonal crystal system, space group R, with cell parameters of a = 5.0850 Å, b = 5.0850 Å, and c = 14.0190 Å and α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. Fig. 1 also reveals that all the reflections indicated by X at 2θ values of 23.84°, 32.62°, 35.27°, 40.35°, 48.80°, 53.19°, 56.47°, 61.63°, 63.30°, 70.42°, 74.59°, 79.61°, 81.29°, 83.80° and 87.23° are well matched to the (012), (104), (2−10), (113), (024), (2−16), (018), (3−14), (030), (1010), (4−20), (312), (0210), (134) and (226) lattice reflection planes of the standard “hexagonal Ni3Mn3Ti6O18” phase, respectively. The remaining reflections indexed by Y are attributed to a SnO2 coating on a glass substrate (ICDD card no 01-078-1063) (stick pattern matching is available in the ESI† as Fig. S1). It has been observed that the XRD patterns of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 remain unaffected with a rise in deposition temperature, but there is an obvious increase in the peak intensities, which shows that the crystallinity of the material is dependant on the deposition temperature.

Surface compositions and morphologies

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films developed at different temperatures of 575, 600 and 625 °C on FTO glass substrates. The results demonstrate that the film surface morphology is significantly influenced by the deposition temperature. At 575 °C, obvious growth of spherical particles can be observed (Fig. 2(a)), while the substrate surface is not entirely covered. An increase in the deposition temperature to 600 °C intensified the thin film growth rates and the substrate surface is fully decorated with these spherical particles (Fig. 2(b)). The nucleation and growth further increase with the rise in deposition temperature to 625 °C, which results in the formation of dense, compact and uniform spherical features of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 (Fig. 2(c)).

The surface morphology specifies that the design and shape of these microspheres remain unchanged by the rise in deposition temperature and regular interconnected spherical microstructures have been observed for the film prepared at 625 °C. During the deposition process via AACVD at different deposition temperatures, simultaneous homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions are responsible for the growth of thin films with different structures and morphologies.44,45 At a growth temperature of 625 °C, the FESEM image of the film was more smooth and compact, with evenly distributed grains. The deposited particles had a good orientation and well-defined grain boundaries with a spherical appearance.
The stoichiometric ratio of Ni, Mn and Ti is further confirmed by EDX elemental mapping, which is about 1:1:2 for all the films (Fig. S2(a)–(c), ESI†), which agrees well with the expected elemental ratio present in the original solution and Ni3Mn3Ti6O18. We believe that the origin of the Sn and Si peaks in the EDX spectrum is from the FTO substrate. Further EDX mapping analysis of the film prepared at 625 °C was performed to establish the single phase nature of the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 films. The distribution of the constituent Ni, Mn, Ti and O atoms has been highlighted by using different color schemes as shown in Fig. 3, which reveals the even distribution of atoms throughout the film matrix.

FT-Raman spectroscopy
The identity and chemical structure of the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 single phase in the films were further characterized by FT-Raman spectroscopy and the spectra of the as-grown thin films at different temperatures are comparatively shown in Fig. 4. In the case of ilmenite-type compounds, 10 Raman active modes (5Ag + 5Eg) were observed and assigned to C3i2 symmetry and the R space group.41,42Fig. 4(a) shows Raman spectra of the film at 575 °C. No Raman active modes of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 are apparent except at 610 cm−1, indicating either a high level of structural disorder at short range or no well-developed Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 structure in the thin film. In Fig. 4(b), it appears that the film at 600 °C showed a low intensity of Raman active peaks at 159, 214, 380, and 467 cm−1, confirming short range structural order in the film, in addition to a strong peak at 610 cm−1. Fig. 4(c) shows that stronger Raman peaks were observed with increasing temperature at 625 °C indicating higher structural order. This film shows nine of 10 Raman scattering modes at 159, 214, 238, 273, 341, 380, 467, 610, and 701 cm−1. The lost peak can be attributed to low intensity, a lack of presence in this area or being superimposed with other ones. The most typical feature is the strong and split Raman mode observed near 700 cm−1. This mode arises from the highest frequency vibrational mode in the single phase ilmenite Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 structure. The Raman peak positions for NiTiO346 and MnTiO347 are located at 193, 230, 247, 292, 345.5, 395, 465, 485, 609, and 706 cm−1 and 202, 236, 264, 336, 360, 465, 611, and 685 cm−1 respectively. In the formation of the single phase ilmenite Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 structure, it is interesting to note that the Raman spectrum is a linear sum of those of NiTiO3 and MnTiO3, analogous to the linear relation among the molecular formulas of these two compounds.19 Nevertheless, we can conclude that the different Raman spectra are undoubtedly caused by the different cations Ni2+ and/or Mn2+ located in the pseudooctahedron M(2+)O6. This indicates that the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 structure might show different photocatalytic and photophysical properties associated with crystal lattice vibrations. Hence the ilmenite Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 phase determined from the XRD analysis is further validated by Raman spectroscopy.

XPS analysis
The Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films prepared at the deposition temperatures of 575, 600, and 625 °C were further examined by XPS (Fig. 5). The XPS survey scan spectra (ESI,† Fig. S3) indicate that nickel, manganese, titanium, and oxygen were the main components at the film's surface. The valence and chemical states of the elements were determined by narrow scans as shown in Fig. 5(A)–(D). In the high resolution Ni 2p spectrum, Fig. 5(A(a)–(c)), shake-up structures of Ni suggested ligand to-metal charge transfer. Broad satellite peaks were found at approximately 860.30 (575 °C), 860.03 (600 °C), and 859.49 (625 °C) eV for 2p3/2 and 878.56 (575 °C), 878.43 (600 °C), and 878.36 (625 °C) eV for 2p1/2.42 The binding energies of 853.86, 853.58, and 853.53 eV were indicative of Ni 2p3/2, while the signals at 871.50, 871.23, and 871.20 eV showed the Ni 2p1/2 region for the deposition temperatures of 575, 600 and 625 °C, respectively.31,48 The peak positions and the spin–orbit splitting value of 17.64 eV indicated the presence of Ni2+.49,50 The higher resolution spectrum of Mn 2p (Fig. 5(B(a)–(c))) was fitted to two peaks at 642.22 (575 °C), 641.93 (600 °C), and 641.25 (625 °C) and 653.83 (575 °C), 653.53 (600 °C), and 652.71 (625 °C) eV for Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the Mn(II) oxidation state, which agrees well with the previous reports in the literature.51 The Mn2+ oxidation state has a clear satellite peak (∼647.31 eV) approximately 6 eV from the parent 2p1/2, which is absent in the higher oxidation states of Mn.52 The position of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 at 458.05 (575 °C), 458.12 (600 °C), and 457.65 (625 °C) eV and 463.75 (575 °C), 463.75 (600 °C), and 463.40 (625 °C) eV shown in Fig. 5(C(a)–(c)) indicated the Ti4+ oxidation state.31,42,50 The spin–orbit splitting value of 5.7 eV for Ti 2p was typical for Ti4+.49 As shown in Fig. 5(D(a)–(c)), the peak at 528.42 (575 °C), 528.16 (600 °C), and 527.98 (625 °C) eV was evidence of O 1s (O2−) in the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution. The binding energies for Ni 2p, Mn 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s in the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 films, as shown in Fig. 5(A)–(D), shifted towards lower values with an increased temperature. This may be ascribable to the structural order and increased crystallinity resulting from higher temperatures, which can contribute to the decreased distance between layers. Consequently, the interaction forces between layers can increase, leading to the weakening of Ni–O–Ti and Mn–O–Ti bonds within individual layers.42 The XPS, XRD and FESEM results revealed the formation of a Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution.

Optical properties
The optical absorption spectra of the thin films fabricated at 575, 600, and 625 °C recorded in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm are shown in Fig. 6(a(i), b(i) and c(i)). It is apparent that the thin films show wide range absorption, which gradually increases towards lower wavelengths. The maximum absorption peak shifts from the near UV region to the visible region of the spectrum with a rise in deposition temperature. Tauc plots,53 (αhν)2vs. hν, in Fig. 6(a(ii), b(ii) and c(ii)) yield a value of the direct transition band gap of 2.42, 2.06, and 1.70 eV for the thin films fabricated at 575, 600, and 625 °C, respectively.

NiTiO3 and MnTiO3 have ilmenite structures with similar lattice parameters; a solid solution can be formed between the two.54 NiTiO3 and MnTiO3 have band gap energies of 2.14–2.50 eV22,31,55,56 and 3.18 eV,57 respectively. Formation of solid solutions between wide and narrow band gap semiconductors is another promising method for controlling the photocatalyst band structure. It has been identified that p–d repulsion shifts the valence band maximum upward without affecting the conduction band minimum.35 For the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 photocatalyst with an A3A′3B6O18 type ilmenite structure, the A site is occupied by Ni2+ and Mn2+ as the cations in a 1:1 ratio. The split 3d orbitals of Ni2+ and Mn2+ scatter at different potential levels between O 2p and Ti 3d. It is known that, in the same crystal field, the energy level of 3d orbitals usually decreases with an increasing number of 3d electrons.19 We speculate that, in the pseudo-octahedron (Ti/Ni/Mn)O6, the occupied Ni 3d states probably hybridize with the occupied Mn 3d states. Similarly, the empty 3d orbitals of Ni2+ and Mn2+ are also likely to hybridize with each other. As a result, the more broadly dispersed and continuous valence band and conduction band formed by the hybridization of the orbitals would result in a narrower band gap for the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 photocatalyst.
The lowering of the band gap value with the rise in deposition temperature is also attributed to the variation in deposition temperature considerably affecting the crystallinity, morphology and porosity of the photocatalyst.58 Solid solution formation via transition-metal mediated band engineering is a viable strategy for developing visible-light responsive semiconductor photocatalysts.
Photoelectrochemical studies
The as-synthesized Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films fabricated at 575, 600, and 625 °C were examined for their solar driven PEC water splitting properties using the LSV technique, in 0.5 M NaOH (pH = 13) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under dark conditions and simulated solar irradiation of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), and their corresponding linear scan voltammograms are given in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films show an insignificant current due to the absence of the electron hole separation process in dark conditions. Interestingly, the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films illustrate a significantly enhanced anodic photocurrent response which gradually increases with an increase in anodic bias due to the photo-induced electron–hole pair separation process under illumination. The slow rise of the photocurrent with increasing potential indicates that at low potentials recombination processes are predominant. Recombination of an e−–h+ pair will probably take place at the defect titanate centers in the material. The observed onset potential of the photocurrent (−0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is the same as observed for several titanates MTiO3 (M = Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Fe2+) with the ilmenite structure.24 Further, it is noted that the thin film deposited at 625 °C shows a maximum photocurrent density of ∼2.05 mA cm−2 at +0.7 V when compared to the thin films grown at 600 °C (∼1.05 mA cm−2) and 575 °C (∼0.33 mA cm−2). The difference in the photoelectrochemical performance is attributed to the different thin film deposition temperatures, which significantly affect the morphology, crystallinity, and porosity (Fig. 2). At low deposition temperature, loosely bonded, irregular and non-uniform microspherical structures may act as recombination centers for photogenerated e−–h+ pairs.44,58 Therefore, the more ordered and crystalline microspherical architecture of the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 electrode developed at 625 °C is found to be more attractive for improved charge transport, while its connected structure permits the electrolyte solution to go through via the pinholes, thereby increasing the PEC performance as compared to the thin films deposited at 575 and 600 °C.
 Fig. 7  Linear sweep voltammograms obtained for the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films deposited at 575, 600 and 625 °C in the presence of 0.5 M NaOH under dark conditions and simulated solar irradiation of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2). 
In this work, the photocurrent density is much improved as compared to n-type NiTiO3 and MnTiO3 semiconductors. NiTiO3 acts indeed as a semiconducting anode in water photo-electrolysis. Between the 2p valence band of oxygen and 3d conduction band of titanium, a narrow cationic (Ni2+: 3d8) band is situated.59,60 Salvaador and co-workers reported61 a photocurrent density of about 2 μA cm−2 at +1.9 V vs. SCE by using a Xe-lamp with Schott filters and 50 μA cm−2 under UV illumination in a 1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 4.3). NiTiO3 thin films56 prepared by the AACVD technique produced a photocurrent density of about 40 μA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). It is hard to find any literature regarding PEC water splitting performance except the properties of MnTiO3 as a photoanode capable of water splitting reported by Bin Dar and co-workers.62 The photocurrent observed for white light and UV excitation had a very low quantum efficiency (about 1%). The higher photocurrent observed for the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 electrode in this work may be a result of mixed-metal oxide formation with three cation subarrays, one for the conduction band (Ti4+) and two for the valence bands (Ni2+ and Mn2+), whose edge should be between the oxygen band and the O2/H2O level. The type of interaction within the solid solutions is yet to be ascertained, but we believe that the continuous valence band and conduction band formed by the hybridization of the 3d orbitals of Ni2+ and Mn2+ with the Ti4+ 3d and O 2p orbitals in Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 are favorable for the mobility of photoexcited charge carriers (e−–h+), giving rise to an improved photocatalytic activity, facilitating the hole trapping mechanism and eventually causing an increase in the photocurrent.
EIS measurements were carried out to analyze the e−−h+ separation and their transfer kinetics across the electrode–electrolyte interface in the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 photoelectrodes deposited at 575, 600 and 625 °C under illumination and dark conditions in the presence of 0.5 M NaOH in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, as displayed in Fig. 8(A) and (B), respectively. The Nyquist diagram of the complex impedance represents the imaginary versus the real part of the impedance and it shows semicircles, which corresponds to a limited electron transfer process.63 Under illumination (Fig. 8(A)), the film fabricated at 625 °C produced the lowest electron transfer resistance (Rct) value (226 Ω) as compared to the 600 °C (275 Ω) and 575 °C (424 Ω) electrodes, indicating efficient charge transfer and separation across the electrode–electrolyte interface, consequently reducing the possibility of charge recombination at the surface of the film fabricated at 625 °C compared to those prepared at 600 and 575 °C. The same trend was observed for the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 films deposited at 575, 600 and 625 °C in the presence of 0.5 M NaOH under dark conditions. Each electrode exhibited a prominent semicircle like Nyquist plot (Fig. 8(B)) with higher Rct values, which suggests an interruption to the electron-transfer kinetics at the surface of the electrode.

These results specify that the developed compact microspherical structure Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 photoelectrode fabricated at 625 °C displays a higher photocurrent density, better charge transportation and smaller interface impedance than the electrodes prepared at 600 and 575 °C under illumination, which is supported by the LSV measurements.
Quantum chemical calculations and band structural analysis
The basic crystal slab of [Ti2O6]4− in Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 was drawn and optimized using the GUI interface of ADF-BAND 2017 using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and Perdew Wang basis functional (PW91). In order to evaluate the geometric, electronic and optical properties of octahedral [Ti2O6]4−(001) including the density of states (DOS), partial density of states (PDOS), and band structure, ADF-BAND structural analysis was carried out. The structural aspects of the top and side views of the [Ti2O6]4− optimized geometry are evident in Fig. 9(A) and (B), whereas charge distribution analysis showed a higher electron density to be concentrated on the oxygen atom (Fig. 10). In order to find the locations of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), the crystal slab of [Ti2O6]4−(001) was subjected to GGA DFT simulations to determine the band gap of the crystal (Fig. 11), which was found to be 2.12 eV, in closer agreement with the experimental band gap (2.06 eV). The DOS graph showed that s, p and d orbitals are involved in constituting both the valence and conduction bands of the slab; however, d-orbitals of Ti contribute more significantly in the valence band as compared to those in the conduction band. The valence band has been distributed into two portions and extended over a range of −1.5 eV to −11 eV. The region between −4.0 eV and −10 eV is clearly dominated by p and d orbitals, while the region of the valence band ranging from −1.5 eV to −4.0 eV was visibly occupied by s, p, and d overlap, signifying a major contribution of d-orbitals.

The conduction band electronic structure was extended between 0.3 eV and 4.0 eV, encompassing one prominent part dominated by s, p and d orbital overlap of Ti and O atoms. The lower portion of both the valence and conduction bands showed hybridization of octahedral [Ti2O6]4−. The band structure of the [Ti2O6]4−(001) along the k-point directions of Γ, Z, R, X, and M is shown in Fig. 12. The energetic parameters calculated through the GGA method provided the formation energy with respect to spherically-symmetric spin-restricted atoms (Table 1).

The Mulliken charge analysis of [Ti2O6]4− is shown in Fig. 13(A). The Mullikan charge distribution reveals 7O as a highly electronegative atom with a charge distribution of −0.715. Several authors have the general consensus that a more negatively charged atom has a greater ability to adsorb on any surface,64,65 implying that 7O is directly involved in adsorption of [Ti2O6]4− on the surface. In order to determine the electronic behavior, the energies of the frontier molecular orbitals of [Ti2O6]4−, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) establishing the valence band and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) constituting the conduction band, were calculated. As EHOMO is often concomitant with the electron donating ability of a molecule, the higher value of EHOMO showed a tendency of [Ti2O6]4− to donate electrons to appropriate acceptor molecules with low-energy, empty molecular orbitals.66 The atomic orbital compositions of the molecular orbitals are sketched in Fig. 13(B), where the gap between EHOMO and ELUMO is 2.030 eV, suggesting eventual charge transfer interactions occurring in the molecule.
Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis is considered to be an effective tool for chemical interpretation of hyperconjugative interactions and electron density transfer from filled lone pair electron orbitals. NBO analysis was carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explore the second order interaction between the filled orbitals of O atoms and empty orbitals of Ti atoms in [Ti2O6]4−. Another advantage of NBO analysis is that it provides a localized depiction of the electron density over a molecule. Second-order perturbation theory was used to explore the interaction energy of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in [Ti2O6]4−.67 For each donor NBO(i) (Ti here) and acceptor NBO(j) (O here), the stabilization energy ΔE related to the electron delocalization i → j is estimated using the following equation68E2 = ni[F(i,j)2(εi − εj)]where ni is the donor orbital occupancy, εi and εj are the diagonal elements (orbital energies) and F(i,j) is the off diagonal NBO Fock matrix element. A larger interaction energy E2 shows a strong interaction between the electron donors and acceptors. Fig. 14 shows the orbital occupancy and orbital energies of [TiO3]2− subsystems, revealing the electron density transfer.

Conclusions
Ilmenite Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 solid solution thin films were developed on FTO coated glass substrates by AACVD utilizing a homogenized THF solution of metal (Ni,Mn) acetates and (Ti(O(CH2)3CH3)4) in the presence of TFA. The growth of the solid solution not only decreases the band gap energy, but also reduces the chance of e−–h+ recombination to enhance solar driven PEC water splitting. Among the various fabricated thin films, a band gap of 1.7 eV and a maximum photocurrent density of 2.05 mA cm−2 at +0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl have been obtained for the photoanode fabricated from THF solution at 625 °C for 45 minutes. Quantum chemical studies carried out at the B3LYP 6-31G(d,p) level displayed a band gap value of 2.03 eV, which is slightly higher than the experimental results obtained from optical measurements of the film fabricated at 625 °C, but in close agreement with the film fabricated at 600 °C. Mullikan charge population analysis reveals the highest electron density at the 7O atom responsible for the adsorption of [Ti2O6]4− on a glass surface.
Experimental
Material and methods
All manipulations were routinely performed under an inert atmosphere of dry argon using a Schlenk tube fitted with a vacuum line and hot plate/magnetic stirrer arrangements with solvents purified by standard methods. Analytical grade (Ni(CH3COO)2·H2O), (Mn(CH3COO)2), (Ti(O(CH2)3CH3)4), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass slides with a surface resistivity of 8 Ω sq−1 were also supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
Thin film fabrication by the AACVD method
In continuation of earlier work,58,69,70 on an in-house designed AACVD assembly, Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films were deposited on commercially available FTO coated conducting glass substrates (20 mm × 10 mm dimensions). Prior to the deposition, the substrates were ultrasonically cleansed with doubly distilled water, acetone, and propan-2-ol, and then stored in ethanol. The substrate slides were removed from the ethanol, dried in the air and the top 5 mm of each FTO/glass substrate was masked with glass, such that the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 would deposit on the lower 15 × 10 mm area. Each FTO/glass substrate was heated up to the desired deposition temperature in the AACVD combustion chamber for 10 minutes to stabilize the temperature before carrying out the deposition. Thin film deposition experiments were performed at three different temperatures of 575, 600 and 625 °C, respectively, from 30 mL of a homogeneous mixture of acetates of Ni and Mn and (Ti(O(CH2)3CH3)4) in THF solvent. In a typical deposition experiment, 0.15 g (0.86 mmol) of Mn(CH3COO)2, 0.21 g (0.86 mmol) of Ni(CH3COO)2·H2O and 0.58 mL (1.72 mmol) of Ti(O(CH2)3CH3)4 were added to a 100 mL Schlenk tube containing 15 mL THF. The mixture was stirred for about 2 hours, followed by the addition of TFA (0.25 mL) to yield a clear solution, which was evaporated under a vacuum to give a light green colored powder. 0.35 g of the obtained powder was re-dissolved in 30 mL THF solvent, then filtered through a cannula and used for the fabrication of Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films at 575, 600, and 625 °C for 45 minutes. Aerosols of the solution were formed by keeping the round bottom flask in a water bath above the piezoelectric modulator of an ultrasonic humidifier. The generated aerosol droplets of the solution were transferred into the hot wall zone of the reactor by argon gas. The carrier gas at a flow rate of 120 mL min−1 was controlled by a L1X linear flow meter. The exhaust from the reactor was vented directly into the extraction system of a fume cupboard. At the end of the deposition, the aerosol line was closed and only the carrier gas was allowed to pass over the substrate. The substrate was allowed to cool to 30 °C before it was taken out from the reactor. The deposited light green thin films are transparent, uniform, robust, and stable towards atmospheric conditions and adhere strongly on FTO/glass substrates as verified by the “scotch tape test”.
Thin film characterization techniques
The phase and crystallinity of the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films were evaluated by conducting powder-XRD measurements using a PANalytical, X′Pert HighScore diffractometer with primary monochromatic high intensity CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation over Bragg angles ranging from 10 to 90° in a step size of 0.026° while the operating voltage and current were maintained at 30 kV and 40 mA respectively at ambient temperature. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Quanta400), at an accelerating voltage of 2.0 kV, 100000 magnification and a working distance of 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 mm, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer EDX (INCA Energy 200, (Oxford Inst.)) was used to determine the films’ morphology and chemical composition. Raman spectroscopic measurements of the films were carried out on a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope and excitation was performed using the 514 nm line of an argon laser with a 0.01 mW output power. The optical absorption properties of the thin films were recorded on a Lambda 35 PerkinElmer UV-vis spectrophotometer in the spectral region of 330–900 nm using a similar FTO coated glass substrate as a reference to eliminate the substrate impact in the spectrum. XPS analysis of the films was carried out using an ULVAC-PHI Quantera II with a 32-channel spherical capacitor energy analyzer under a vacuum (1 × 10−6 Pa) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.8 eV) and a natural energy width of 680 meV. The carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as a reference to calibrate the binding energies.
Photoelectrochemical study
The photoelectrochemical measurements of the Ni3Mn3Ti6O18 thin films were made using the LSV technique with a Princeton Applied Research (PAR-VersaSTAT-3) electrochemical workstation with a conventional three-electrode system. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured (potential window range: −1.0 to +1.0 V, and scan rate: 50 mV s−1) using the fabricated thin film electrode as the working electrode, while the reference and counter electrodes were Ag/AgCl (KCl) and platinum wire, respectively. For photocurrent measurements, the fabricated thin films were dipped into a quartz window cell containing 0.5 M NaOH aqueous solution in dark and light (150 W Xe arc lamp (Newport, Model 69907): 100 mW cm−2) conditions. The EIS measurements of the thin films were carried out using a computer-controlled Princeton Applied Research (PAR-VersaSTAT-3) electrochemical workstation. The amplitude potential was 5 mV around the open circuit potential, with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz.
Computational methodology
First principles density functional calculations have been carried out using ADF-BAND 2017 employing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the results were visualized on ADF GUI 2017.71,72 The exchange and correlation potential were treated with the Perdew–Wang potential (PW91).73,74 Scalar relativistic corrections have been included through the zeroth-order regular approximation and the numerical accuracy level remained good.75 Our slab calculations use two-dimensional translational symmetry. For the convergence tests, basis sets were used in calculations together with a reference basis set. The convergence of calculations has been checked by varying all important parameters. The band structure simulations have been carried out along the directions of Γ, Z, R, X, and M of the Brillouin zone sampling. The surface was modeled to determine the energetic parameters and density of states (DOS).
Theoretical computations have also been carried out at the DFT-B3LYP level of theory employing the 6-31G(d,p) basis set using Gaussian 09W in a Linux environment installed on the Super Computer at RCMS. To investigate the structural and electronic properties, [Ti2O6]4− has been fully optimized with Mullikan atomic charge calculations. The quantum chemical parameters obtained were geometric parameters including bond lengths and bond angles, whereas the energetic parameters determined from DFT calculations were Etot, EHOMO, ELUMO, ΔE and the Mulliken charge distribution.
