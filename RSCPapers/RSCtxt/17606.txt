    , Accepted 9th February 2020First published on 10th February 2020AbstractIn this study SBA-15, melamine-based dendrimer amine functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica (MDA-SBA-15), and the 1,3-di(3-methylimidazolium) propane dibromide dicationic ionic liquid (pr(mim)2Br2) were used in order to improve the proton conductivity, and thermal and mechanical stability of phosphoric acid (PA) doped polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based composite membranes for application in high-temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The effect of the porous structure of the mesoporous silica on the performance of the PA doped PBI-based membrane containing pr(mim)2Br2 was investigated under high temperature. The experimental results implied that MDA-SBA-15 containing the groups of NH2, and melamine-based dendrimer amines (MDA) on the internal wall of its pores provides special sites for further interaction with pr(mim)2Br2, PBI, and PA in the composite membranes. The presence of NH2 and MDA groups plays an important role in creating several pathways for proton exchange in the composite membranes. The PA-doped PBI-based composite membranes containing 4.5% w/w pr(mim)2Br2, and 1.5% w/w MDA-SBA-15 exhibit a high proton conductivity of 0.22 S cm−1 at 180 °C under dry conditions. The current density of 1.18 A cm−2, and power density of 0.60 W cm−2 at 0.50 V and 180 °C confirm the enhanced potential of the PA doped PBI-based composite membranes for application in high-temperature PEM fuel cells.
1. Introduction
The proton exchange membrane (PEM), as the most important member of PEM fuel cells, plays three key roles: (1) proton transfer produced at the anode surface to the cathode surface, (2) separating reactant gases, other pollutants, and impurities, and (3) preventing the entry of electrons.1–3 The membrane should have properties such as high proton conductivity, excellent chemical stability, high thermal stability, and good mechanical strength.2–4 Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes such as Nafion are the most common membranes in PEM fuel cells, which have high proton conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and thermal and chemical stability.3–5 Water molecules in Nafion are responsible for the transport of produced protons at the anode electrode surface.6,7 Therefore, the use of Nafion membranes at temperatures above 80 °C is associated with a significant decrease in the proton conductivity, and an increase in the fuel cell resistance. Consequently, the use of Nafion membranes is limited to temperatures lower than water evaporation.7–9
High temperature PEM fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) have advantages compared to low temperature PEM fuel cells including: (1) high CO tolerance, (2) elimination of cathode flooding, and (3) faster electrode kinetics.10,11 Extensive studies were carried out on PEMs with high proton conductivity under dry conditions, and excellent thermal and chemical stability for the application of HT-PEMFCs as a green, and efficient energy source.10–12 In recent years, polybenzimidazole (PBI), a hydrocarbon-based polymer with special advantages, including a high glass transition temperature of 425–435 °C, and a melting point of 600 °C, has received special attention for the preparation of the membranes in HT-PEMFCs.11–14 However, pure PBI membranes do not have enough proton conductivity.13
Recently, PBI membranes doped with phosphoric acid (PA) were used as PEMs in fuel cells under high temperatures.14–16 PA as a low-volatile proton solvent is a good alternative to water. Although PA is the main factor in providing the ability of proton exchange in PA doped PBI (APBI) membranes in HT-PEMFCs, there are serious technical limitations to the use of PA in long-term operation of HT-PEMFCs.17–19 The dehydration of PA, and the formation of oligomers similar to pyrophosphoric acid, with very low proton conductivity at temperatures above 140 °C, is the most important issue in the use of APBI membranes in HT-PEMFCs. It leads to a significant reduction in the proton conductivity, and efficiency of HT-PEMFCs at operating temperature ≥140 °C in the long term.18–20 Hence, many studies have been carried out to find a proton exchange agent with high proton conductivity, while having excellent thermal, and chemical stability in HT-PEMFC applications (T ≥ 140 °C).19–21
In recent years, use of ionic liquids (ILs) has been reported as an environmentally friendly agent of proton transfer in electrochemical applications, and the preparation of membranes for use in HT-PEMFCs.22–24 Fengxiang Liu et al. reported a composite membrane with an IL for application in HT-PEMFCs. It exhibited good proton conductivity of 0.11 S cm−1 at 170 °C.25 ILs are organic salts consisting of an asymmetric organic cation, and an organic or inorganic anion bonded by electrostatic forces. ILs also have properties such as high proton conductivity and excellent thermal stability, and are non-volatile and non-flammable.22–24
Dicationic ILs are a new generation of ILs containing two mono anions, and two singly charged cations. The cations in dicationic ILs consist of two aromatic rings linked by an alkyl chain. Dicationic ILs with higher thermal stability, glass transition temperature, melting point, and proton conductivity than mono-cationic ILs have been used to improve the proton conductivity of membranes in HT-PEMFCs.27,28 Hooshyari et al. reported a proton conductivity of 0.08 S cm−1 at 180 °C from PBI-based membranes containing a dicationic IL in HT-PEMFCs.26 However, the tendency of dicationic ILs to be removed from the membranes in long term operation under high temperatures is an effective factor in reducing the proton conductivity.27–29
Preparation of composite membranes with the introduction of SBA-15 mesoporous silica as hydrophilic inorganic particles was reported in fuel cell applications. Ying-Jeng Kuo et al. used MCM-41, and SBA-15 mesoporous silica to prepare a composite membrane based on PBI for application in HT-PEMFCs. It exhibited enhanced PA doping, and suitable mechanical properties.30 SBA-15 mesoporous silica has unique properties such as tube-shaped pores with hexagonal structure covered with silanol (Si–OH) groups, a pore diameter of more than 2 nm, lower toxicity, higher biocompatibility, and biodegradability.29–32 In addition, the outer surfaces of SBA-15 mesoporous silica are covered with Si–OH groups with a negative surface charge. These Si–OH groups act as sites of proton transmission, and PA uptake in these membranes.33–35 The pore diameter ≥2 nm in mesoporous silica resulted in a reduction in the probability of pore blocking in a large volume of reactants, and increased speed in the distribution of input materials.27–29 Angioni et al. reported a composite membrane based on PBI by using SBA-15 mesoporous silica modified with amine (NH2) and sulfate (SO32−) groups, and achieved a high proton conductivity of ∼0.09 S cm−1 at 120 °C and 30% RH from non-functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica.36 Studies show that the pores of SBA-15 mesoporous silica have a significant effect on the PA uptake, and increased the membrane's ability to retain PA.35,36 In this project, we used SBA-15 mesoporous silica, and SBA-15 mesoporous silica with functionalized pores to investigate the effect of pores, and their functionalization on the membrane properties under anhydrous conditions.
Our main goal in this project is an improvement in the durability of the proton conductivity, and mechanical and chemical properties of PA doped PBI membranes containing pr(mim)2Br2. The PBI-based membranes were prepared by dispersing SBA-15, melamine-based dendrimer amine functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica (MDA-SBA-15), and the 1,3-di (3-methylimidazolium) propane dibromide dicationic IL (pr(mim)2Br2) into the PBI polymer (by the solution casting method). The effects of different amounts of these conductive additives were investigated on the doping level of PA, the proton conductivity, and the chemical and mechanical properties in the membranes. The ability to retain PA and pr(mim)2Br2, and the durability of the proton conductivity of the membranes were evaluated. The morphological and thermal properties, and HT-PEMFC performance of the membranes were investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
PBI powder with high molecular weight was purchased from FuMA-Tech (Fumion APH). PA (≥85 wt%), and poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer non-ionic surfactant EO20PO70EO20 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) (≥99.9%), N,N-di-isopropylethylamine, methylacrylate, ethylenediamine, hydrochloric acid, tetraethylorthosilicate, and methanol were purchased from Merck. All inorganic salts with high purity were purchased from KimiaGohar (Tehran, Iran).
2.2. Synthesis of the 1,3-di(3-methylimidazolium) propane dibromide dicationic IL
The 1,3-di(3-methylimidazolium) propane dibromide dicationic IL (pr(mim)2Br2) was synthesized according to the method described in the literature,37 by adding 0.122 mol of 1-methyl-imidazolium dissolved in 35 ml of acetonitrile dropwise to 1,3-dibromopropane in a round bottom flask under constant stirring at room temperature, for 4 h. Rotary evaporation was used to evaporate the excess acetonitrile. The pure bromide salt was washed 4 times with acetone solution, and the remaining salt was dried under a vacuum. Finally, pr(mim)2Br2 was obtained. The purity of the synthesized pr(mim)2Br2 was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
2.3. Synthesis of melamine-based dendrimer amine functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica
SBA-15 mesoporous silica was synthesized according to the method described in the literature38 by using poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer non-ionic surfactant EO20PO70EO20 as a structure directing agent, and tetraethylorthosilicate under acidic conditions. Functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica with amines was synthesized similarly to the method described in the literature.38 For the synthesis of melamine-based dendrimer amine functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica (MDA-SBA-15) according to the method described in the literature,38 30 mmol of cyanuric chloride and 46 mmol of N,N-di-isopropylethylamine were added to 300 ml of dried tetrahydrofuran. Then, it was shaken for 3 h at 0 °C under an argon atmosphere until complete dissolution. Functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica with amines was added to the mixture. It was shaken for 24 h at 0 °C. Then, the mixture was filtered and the obtained solid was washed several times with dry methanol. The resulting product was MDA-SBA-15.
2.4. Membrane preparation
To prepare a PBI solution (2 w/w%), PBI powder was dissolved in DMAc solvent under a nitrogen atmosphere, for 24 h at 150 °C. Different amounts of pr(mim)2Br2 were added to the solution of PBI in the range 0–5% w/w with respect to the pristine PBI polymer, and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h at 32 °C. To prepare PBI-based composite membranes, SBA-15 and MDA-SBA-15 were added to homogeneous solutions of PBI, and pr(mim)2Br2 in an amount of 0–5% w/w with respect to the pristine PBI polymer, slowly. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min at 25 °C. The obtained solutions were cast uniformly onto a glass plate by using a doctor blade. The cast films were dried at 80 °C under a vacuum until no significant weight loss was observed in the membranes (to ensure complete evaporation of DMAc solvent). The film thickness was about 60 μm. The membranes were immersed in PA solution (85%) for 5 days at 25 °C. The prepared membranes before being immersed in PA were named PBI-DILx, PBI-DILx-SBAs, and PBI-DILx-MDAy where DIL, SBA, MDA, x, s, and y represent pr(mim)2Br2, SBA-15, MDA-SBA-15, and the amount of pr(mim)2Br2, SBA-15, and MDA-SBA-15 (%w/w) in the PBI matrix, respectively. The membranes after immersion in PA were named APBI-DILx, APBI-DILx-SBAs, and APBI-DILx-MDAy where A represents PA.
2.5. Characterization techniques
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (IFS88 model – Bruker, Germany) was used to analyze the structure of pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15. The samples were prepared by scattering pr(mim)2Br2, and MDA-SBA-15 in dry KBr powder. The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of PBI, PBI-DILx, and PBI-DIL4.5-MDAy membranes were recorded with a spectrometer (Vertex80 model – Bruker, Germany). All analyses were performed at a scan rate of 4 cm−1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of pr(mim)2Br2 were obtained using a spectrometer (Bruker 300 MHz). The surface properties of SBA-15, and MDA-SBA-15 were investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C using a volumetric adsorption analyzer (BELsorp-mini II-Japan). The specific surface area of SBA-15, and MDA-SBA-15 was evaluated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and their pore size distributions were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MDA-SBA-15, SBA-15, and the membranes were obtained using a Philips X'pert diffractometer. The XRD patterns of MDA-SBA-15, and SBA-15 were recorded over the range 0.8° ≤ 2θ ≤ 10°. The XRD patterns of the membranes were measured between 0.8° and 90°. The surface morphology of the membranes was investigated by the non-contact mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM SPA-300HV, Seiko Instrument Co.). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were obtained with a PerkinElmer TGA 7 system to determine the thermal stability of the membranes, pr(mim)2Br2, and MDA-SBA-15. These analyses were performed in a nitrogen environment at 30–700 °C at a 10 °C min−1 rate. The morphology of MDA-SBA-15, and the membranes was observed using scanning electron microscopy (TESCA). The cross-section of the membranes was obtained by fracturing in liquid nitrogen. All of the samples were sputter-coated with Au prior to measurement. The surface morphology of SBA-15 and MDA-SBA-15 was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties of the membranes were investigated using a Zwick/RoellZ030 tensile test machine at a speed of 2 mm min−1 at ambient temperature.
2.6. Investigation of the membrane properties

2.6.1. PA doping level (PAdop). 
In order to determine the effect of pr(mim)2Br2, SBA-15, and MDA-SBA-15 on increasing the doping level of PA (PAdop), pieces of the membranes were cut. The weight of the membrane pieces was measured. Then, the samples were immersed in a PA solution (85%) for 5 days at 25 °C, separately. Before measuring the weight of the samples, they were dried with blotting paper, and at 110 °C under a vacuum to remove moisture. The samples were dried for about 24 h, until no significant weight loss was observed in them. To calculate PAdop (PA mol per mol PBI repeat unit), the following equation was used (1)where W1 is the weight of the dry membrane, and W2 the weight of the PA doped membrane.


2.6.2. Proton conductivity. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a technique that is used to measure the electrical properties of conductive materials, and common surfaces in electrodes. In this paper, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis was performed to investigate the proton conductivity of the membranes at 25–180 °C (under dry conditions). The analysis was performed in a frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz with a voltage amplitude of 0.05 V using a PGSTAT303N potentiostat/galvanostat (Ecochemie). The temperature was controlled by using a Globe Tech Computer Cell GT. In the method, the impedance measurement was performed with a probe system, including two platinum plates, a flowing carrier, and two platinum wires that evaluate the voltage drop. Before measuring the electrochemical impedance, the membranes were immersed in PA solution (85%) for 5 days at 25 °C, and then the samples were dried with blotting paper, and for at least 24 h at 110 °C. Finally, the proton conductivity of the membranes was calculated by the measured impedance, which indicates the ability of a membrane to prevent electrical current according to the following equation: (2)where σ is the proton conductivity (S cm−1), L the distance between the two platinum electrodes (cm), W the membrane width (cm), T the membrane thickness (cm), and R the ionic resistance of the membrane resulting from the intersection of the maximum frequency on the complex impedance axis with the real impedance axis (Ω). Activation energy (Ea) values for proton transfer were calculated according to the following equation: (3)where σ0 is the preview coefficient or pre-exponential factor (S K−1 cm−1), K Boltzmann's constant (J mol−1 K−1), T temperature (K), and Ea the proton conduction activation energy (kJ mol−1). The conductivity of pr(mim)2Br2, and MDA-SBA-15 was measured in PA solution (85%) by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific/Eutech Instruments PC700 pH/mV/conductivity meter at 25 °C.


2.6.3. The retainability of PA and pr(mim)2Br2. 
The proton conductivity of membranes based on PBI greatly requires the presence of solvent, and a proton conductor in HT-PEMFC applications. The removal of free PA, and pr(mim)2Br2 by water vapor leads to a significant decrease in the proton conductivity of the membranes during HT-PEMFC operation in the long term. Hence, the pieces of the membrane were kept hanging over boiling water for 5 h. Every 1 h, the weight of the pieces of the membrane was measured. Before measuring, in order to ensure the complete removal of water vapor molecules from the membranes, the samples were dried with blotting paper, and at 110 °C under a vacuum until a constant weight. Finally, the weight loss of the membranes was calculated from the weight difference of the membranes before, and after hanging over boiling water. The proton conductivity of the membranes after hanging over boiling water was investigated from 80 °C to 180 °C.


2.6.4. Chemical stability. 
The Fenton test was used to simulate incomplete oxygen reduction, and radical production, and to determine the chemical stability of the membranes against the destructive effects of radical species in HT-PEMFCs. To evaluate the chemical stability of the membranes, the weight of the membrane pieces was measured, and then they were immersed in Fenton's reagent (3% H2O2 aqueous solution containing 4 ppm FeSO4) for 10 h at 80 °C. Every 1 h, after leaving the Fenton reagent, the samples were washed with deionized water at room temperature. Then, the weight of the samples was measured after drying at 110 °C under a vacuum until a constant weight. Finally, the weight loss of the membranes was evaluated by the weight difference of the membrane before, and after immersing in the Fenton reagent.


2.6.5. Fuel cell test. 
The electrochemical properties of APBI, APBI-DIL4, and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes were investigated in a PEMFC by the polarization curves in a single fuel cell from 120–180 °C (without humidification). The electrocatalyst layers were prepared by loading catalyst ink (Pt loading: 0.5 mg cm−2) onto carbon fiber containing a commercial micro-porous layer to make the electrode-membrane assembly (MEA). For the preparation of the catalyst ink in MEAs based on the membrane, Pt/C powder (E-TEK, Pt (20 wt%), catalyst), PBI (binder, proton conductor), and LiCl were dissipated in DMAc solvent with weight ratios 3.6:1:0.2:38, by ultrasound for 1 h.26 The ink was sprayed onto carbon fiber. The difference in the carbon fiber weight before, and after ink loading was used to control the loading rate of the catalyst ink. The prepared electrocatalyst layers were dried for 4 h at 180 °C. To make the MEAs, the APBI based membrane was sandwiched between the prepared electrocatalyst layers under a pressure of 50 kg cm−2 for 4 min at 130 °C.
To evaluate the performance of the membranes, the MEAs were placed in the single fuel cell. H2 and O2 gases were fed into a fuel cell without humidification at a flow rate of 300 and 500 ml min−1, respectively. The temperature was increased stepwise from 25 °C to 180 °C. The temperature was controlled by means of a thermocouple in contact with the bipolar plate. Under these conditions, sufficient time was provided for the OCV to reach a constant value. The activation of the MEAs was performed to provide a more favorable connection between the membrane and the electrocatalyst layers, and to prepare the membrane for better proton conduction, before evaluating the polarization curve of the membranes. Hence, the PEMFC was placed at a constant current density of 0.2 A cm−2 for 8 h at the desired temperatures, and the membrane was given enough time to maximize its ability of proton exchange.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. ATR spectra
The FTIR spectra of PBI, PBI-DILx, and PBI-DIL4.5-MDAy membranes, pr(mim)2Br2, and MDA-SBA-15 are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  FTIR spectra of PBI, PBI-DILx, and PBI-DIL4.5-MDAy membranes, pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15. 
In the spectrum of PBI, there are peaks at around 3145 cm−1 and 1625 cm−1, which are ascribed to the hydrogen bond between N–H, and N–H and the CC, and CN stretching vibration of the imidazolium ring, respectively. The peak at around 1450 cm−1 is assigned to imidazole ring breathing.25,26 In the spectrum of MDA-SBA-15, the characteristic absorption peaks at around 810 cm−1 and 1088 cm−1 are attributed to the typical Si–O–Si bonds (the condensed silica network). The strong absorption band at around 3450 cm−1 is ascribed to the –NH tensile vibrations. The triazine aromatic ring is observed at 1434 cm−1 and 1573 cm−1. The bands at 2870 cm−1 and 2938 cm−1 are attributed to asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching (the propyl chain).38 The FTIR spectrum of pr(mim)2Br2 exhibits absorption bands at around 1600–1550 cm−1, which are due to the stretching vibration of CC and CN of the imidazolium ring. Also, the stretching vibrations of the –CH2 and –CH groups of aromatic rings are observed at around 3000–2850 cm−1 and 3150–3050 cm−1, respectively. The stretching band at around 3600 cm−1 is assigned to the –NH group.37
The main characteristic peaks are observed in the FTIR spectra of all membranes. As shown, the intensity of the peaks increases with increasing content of pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15 in the PBI membrane matrix. The results prove the presence and incorporation of pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15 in the PBI membrane matrix. In addition, the peak intensity of hydrogen bonded –NH groups and free NH groups (PBI) decreases in the membranes, which can be due to the interaction between PBI chains, pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15.
3.2. Proton conductivity
The ability of accepting produced protons at the anode surface and proton transfer of the APBI membranes is borne by the proton exchanger. The presence of proton exchange components in the membrane matrix with the ability of hydrogen interactions, and thermal and chemical stability is necessary to provide a favorable conductivity.15–17 The APBI membranes have 0.023 S cm−1 proton conductivity at 25 °C, for which the capacity of acceptance, and proton exchange depends heavily on the received PA level by the membranes. This is due to the presence of PA, as a proton donor–acceptor with high proton conductivity (0.077 S cm−1 at 42 °C). The high proton conductivity can be attributed to the high degree of its dissociation (pKa: 2.148), and the ability to change the structure to H4PO4+, owing to the formation of hydrogen interactions between proton and OP, –OH, and proton accepting role.39,40 In general, there is PA in two other forms, H2PO4− (proton acceptor), and H4PO4+ (proton donor) without excess water, free, and bonded to the PBI membranes by suitable connections. They provided positions for proton exchange through possible available mechanisms, vehicular and Grotthuss, in the APBI membranes.40

3.2.1. PAdop. 
Considering the importance of the presence of PA as a low-volatility proton solvent in the role of proton exchange in PBI based membranes, the effects of the presence of pr(mim)2Br2, SBA-15, and MDA-SBA-15 were investigated on PAdop at 25 °C. According to Fig. 2(a), a good increase in PAdop is observed with the introduction of pr(mim)2Br2 into the PBI matrix compared to APBI membranes. The increase is attributed to the presence of pr(mim)2Br2, which results in the absorption of more PAdop in APBI-DILx membranes. This can be due to the high capacity of pr(mim)2Br2 to form suitable interactions to absorb PA.18–20 pr(mim)2Br2 with its acid–base nature forms good hydrogen bonds through a single H atom bonded to a C atom-bonded between two N atoms, and a free electron pair of N atoms in the imidazolium rings. On the other hand, imidazolium cations, and Br− anions in pr(mim)2Br2 are capable of forming strong electrostatic forces.22–24
 Fig. 2  PAdop plots of (a) APBI-DILx, (b) APBI-DIL4-MDAy, and APBI-DIL4.5-MDAy membranes and (c) PAdop and proton conductivity plots of APBI-DIL4-SBAs and APBI-DIL4.5-SBAs composite membranes at 25 °C, and TEM images of SBA-15. 
The proper interactions between active sites of imidazolium rings, Br− anions, and PBI also have a positive effect on creating favorable conditions for increasing PAdop in APBI-DILx membranes. As shown by adding pr(mim)2Br2 up to 4% (w/w), PAdop increases to 10.99 mol per mol PBI repeat unit, which is significantly higher than the APBI membrane (∼7 mol per mol PBI repeat unit).
The effect of mesoporous silica on the PA doped composite membranes at 25 °C is observed in Fig. 2(b and c).
As shown, the introduction of SBA-15 into the membrane matrix is associated with an increase in PAdop relative to the APBI-DIL4 and APBI membranes. Based on Fig. 2(c), the PBI-DIL4-SBA3 composite membranes exhibit a maximum PAdop of 12.60 mol per mol PBI repeat unit. Based on the TEM image of SBA-15, this high PAdop can be attributed to the porous structure of SBA-15, and increased hydrogen bonds between the PA, and OH– groups. By adding MDA-SBA-15, the PAdop of the PBI-DILx-MDAy composite membranes is higher than that of the PBI-DIL4-SBA3 composite membranes, despite the greater pore diameter of SBA-15 (7.0 nm) compared to MDA-SBA-15 (4.7 nm). For instance, the PA doping level of the PBI-DIL4-MDA1.5 composite membranes is 14.67 mol per mol PBI repeat unit. By comparison, it is clear that the only difference between the PBI-DIL4-SBA3 and PBI-DIL4-MDA1.5 composite membranes is the use of the pure SBA-15, and SBA-15 with functionalized pores (MDA-SBA-15). Both of these types of mesoporous silica have SiOH-coated outer surfaces. Since the main difference between the two types of mesoporous silica is their pore structure, it is found that the pores of the mesoporous silica play an important role in improving the PAdop of these composite membranes. Because, functionalization of the Si–OH groups of the SBA-15 pores is associated with the enhancement of the positive effect of the mesoporous silica on PA uptake.
Accordingly, the free electron pairs in N atoms of the NH2, and MDA groups, and also the H atom bonded to the N atom in the functional groups can lead to improved PA uptake in the PBI-DILx-MDAy composite membranes. This is due to the ability of the NH2 and MDA groups to form hydrogen bonds, and ionic bonds with PA. The Si–O–Si networks in the inner wall of the pore also form useful hydrogen bonds for receiving PA (Fig. 3(a)).27–29

The numerous connections formed by hydrogen bonding between MDA-SBA-15, pr(mim)2Br2 and PBI, on the other hand, can cause the absorption of more PA moles in the composite membranes. Based on the results, the APBI-DIL4.5-MDAy composite membranes show higher PAdop compared to the APBI-DIL4.5 membranes. Meanwhile, in the absence of MDA-SBA-15 the reduction in PAdop of the APBI-DIL4.5 membranes is observed. This seems to be due to the increase of the available surface for contact with pr(mim)2Br2 (4.5% w/w), and its better distribution compared to the APBI-DIL4.5 membranes. The PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes exhibit the maximum PAdop (15.32 mol per mol PBI repeat unit). Collectively, the presence of MDA, and NH2 groups in the inner wall of the pores not only does not reduce the absorption of PA by the PBI polymer chains, but also increases the PA and pr(mim)2Br2 content in the composite membranes.


3.2.2. Investigating the effect of pr(mim)2Br2 on proton conductivity. 

Fig. 4(a) shows the proton conductivity of the APBI-DILx membranes as a function of temperature (25–180 °C range) under dry conditions.
 Fig. 4  Proton conductivity plots of (a) APBI-DILx, (b) APBI-DIL4.5-MDAy, and (c) APBI-DIL4-MDAy membranes in the 25–180 °C range. 
The proton conductivity of the APBI-DILx membranes increases by adding pr(mim)2Br2 content compared with the APBI membranes from 25 °C to 180 °C. The improvement is related to the increase of proton exchange sites, and the PAdop in the APBI-DILx membranes. Since the ADIL mixture has a high proton conductivity relative to a specific volume of PA solution (85%), the increase can be attributed to the activity, and mobility of ions (cations and anions) due to the presence of pr(mim)2Br2, and improvement of the ionic strength of the PA solution, because pr(mim)2Br2 consists of two rings of imidazolium (cation), and two Br− anions. The pr(mim)2Br2 also accelerates the penetration rate and ion movement due to the low viscosity of the imidazolium cation. Therefore, the mobility of the cations, and anions in the pr(mim)2Br2 is another important factor. It seems to have a significant effect on the proton transfer and improvement of the proton conductivity of the APBI-DILx membranes.
In addition, pr(mim)2Br2 has a good ability to form effective interactions with the APBI-DILx membrane matrix for proton transfer.28,29 The cations of pr(mim)2Br2 can play an important role in attracting protons in the APBI-DILx membranes, because the N atom in the imidazolium rings with a free electron pair, and a single H atom attached to a bonded C atom between two N atoms provide high capacity for the formation of hydrogen bonds with the membrane matrix, and proton exchange.18–20 The Br− anions in pr(mim)2Br2 also have good attraction for receiving and exchanging protons and interactions with the membrane matrix, through electrostatic forces. Finally, the connections resulting from hydrogen bonds, and ionic bonds between pr(mim)2Br2 and the membrane matrix can provide specific pathways to exchange a proton, through Grotthuss–vehicular mechanisms.
According to the results, the maximum proton conductivity is obtained for the APBI-DIL4 membranes. As shown in Fig. 4(a), adding 4.5% (w/w) of pr(mim)2Br2 decreases the proton conductivity of the membranes. This can be due to low PAdop, and possibly decreased access of protons to the proton receptor sites in the APBI-DILx membrane (x > 4% w/w).


3.2.3. Investigating the effect of MDA-SBA-15 on the proton conductivity. 
The proton conductivity of the PBI-DIL4-SBAs, and PBI-DIL4.5-SBAs composite membranes at 25 °C is observed in Fig. 2(c). Based on the results, the APBI-DIL4-SBA3 composite membranes exhibit the highest proton conductivity (0.123 S cm−1). The proton conductivity of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDAy and APBI-DIL4-MDAy composite membranes is shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), in the 25–180 °C range, and dry conditions. According to the results, the APBI-DIL4-MDA1.5 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes exhibit high proton conductivities of 0.162 S cm−1 and 0.177 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. The comparison of the proton conductivities of the APBI-DIL4, APBI-DIL4-SBA3, APBI-DIL4-MDA1.5 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes at 25 °C implies that the porous structure of SBA-15 has a positive effect on the improvement of the proton conductivity.
This significant improvement in the proton conductivity of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes indicates that the channel-like structures of MDA-SBA-15 play a special role as the admitting factors of the wandering protons from H2 oxidation at the anode electrode surface in the composite membranes. The presence of NH2 and MDA functional groups in the inner wall of MDA-SBA-15 pores is an important factor for proton exchange in the composite membranes. The N atoms of the functional groups through their free electron pair have great potential to conduct protons, owing to development of the wide network of hydrogen bonds in the composite membranes.41–43 Therefore, the pores of MDA-SBA-15 can provide numerous active sites for proton conduction, and improved structural properties of the composite membranes.
On the other hand, the high doping level of PA in the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes does not act as a barrier to proton exchange. The reason for this improved conductivity, despite the high PAdop, is the presence of NH2 and MDA groups in the inner wall of the pores,36 because the presence of these groups in the MDA-SBA-15 pores does not reduce the active sites available on the imidazole ring (PBI chains) for the PA interaction, and its ionization. PA as a low-volatile proton solvent (water substituent) in these membranes is ionized by interaction with the PBI polymer chains through its base nature. This H2PO4− produced acts as a proton exchanger.30,36 The base nature of the NH2 and MDA groups, on the other hand, can allow for PA ionization and leads to an increase in the number of proton exchangers, and an improvement in the proton conductivity. According to the obtained results, use of MDA-SBA-15 can be a good option to improve the electrochemical properties of PBI based membranes. Based on Fig. 4, these results indicate that the proton conductivity of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes has a significant improvement compared to other membranes, at all the temperatures.
Additionally, the movement of the NH2 and MDA groups can lead to a better mobility of protons, and enhance the proton conductivity of the composite membranes. The Si–O–Si networks also have a positive effect on the absorption, and transport of protons within the pores. The external surface's Si–OH groups of mesoporous silica with negative surface charge have the desirable ability to form effective interactions with the matrix of the composite membranes, and proton exchange. On the other hand, the ability of the NH2 and MDA groups to form hydrogen bonds can provide the entry of pr(mim)2Br2 and PA into the meso channels. Under special conditions, by forming a wide network of hydrogen bonds between the active sites of MDA, pr(mim)2Br2 and PA within the meso channels, there are several pathways for proton exchange (Fig. 3(a)).41–43
In Fig. 3(b), in the SEM image of the morphology of MDA-SBA-15 are observed ropelike domains with uniform size ∼1 μm that are organized very regularly. TEM images of SBA-15 (see Fig. 2(c)), and MDA-SBA-15 also show channel-like structures running parallel to the longer direction. Hence, the presence of these types of mesoporous silica in the composite membrane matrix can develop several pathways, and meso channels for the reception and release of protons, through the wide network of hydrogen bonds. It leads to improved proton conductivity.32,41 All of the factors, and the PAdop are reasons for the high proton conductivity of the composite membranes and the AMDA mixture relative to a certain volume of PA solution (85%).
There is a decrease in proton conductivity of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA2 composite membranes. In this case, access of protons is likely reduced to the active sites of the proton exchange in the MDA-SBA-15 content (≥2% w/w), which decreases the proton conductivity of the composite membranes.


3.2.4. Effect of temperature on the proton conductivity of the membranes. 
According to Fig. 4, the proton conductivity of the membranes increases from 25 °C to 180 °C. The APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes exhibit 0.22 S cm−1 proton conductivity at 180 °C, which shows a significant improvement compared to 25 °C. With increasing temperature, the interaction between polymer chains decreases, and it leads to more mobility of proton carriers as well as polymer chains in the membranes. In addition, the mobility of protons and surface contact of the membrane with the electrocatalyst layers increase. This leads to an acceleration of the acceptance, and release of protons, as well as the availability of the wider active surface for electrode reactions. The high mobility of protons and their access to the active sites can also have a positive effect on Ea required for proton conduction through Grotthuss and vehicular mechanisms in the membranes. The Ea required for guiding protons in the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5, APBI-DIL4 and APBI membranes is recorded in Table 1. According to the results, the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes require a lower Ea to conduct protons compared with the other membranes. This decrease shows the acceleration of the proton conduction and easier exchange in the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes with increasing temperature.44

The comparison of the properties of these composite membranes implies that the channel-like structures (porous structure) of MDA-SBA-15 have an acceptable ability to improve the electrochemical and mechanical properties of the PA doped PBI-DIL4.5 membranes. Therefore, the tube-like pores in MDA-SBA-15 are one of the advantages of the hydrophilic inorganic particles in comparison to other inorganic particles. The presence of NH2 and MDA groups is another advantage of MDA-SBA-15, because of the high potential to interact with PA and pr(mim)2Br2 and form a wide network of hydrogen bonds for proton exchange. All the features have made the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes more desirable for HT-PEMFC application.

3.3. Membrane morphology study

3.3.1. SEM study of the PBI-DILx membrane. 

Fig. 5 shows the morphology of the surface and cross-section of the PBI-DIL4 and PBI-DIL4.5 membranes. The SEM image of the plane surface of the PBI-DIL4 membranes (Fig. 5(a)) is smooth. In the SEM cross-section image of the PBI-DIL4 membranes is also observed a random structure (Fig. 5(a′)). The cause of the phenomenon is the proper interactions between active sites of pr(mim)2Br2 and the PBI polymer, which result in a homogeneous distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 in the PBI-DIL4 membranes. The homogeneous distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 can also provide continuous paths for proton transfer and improvement of the proton conductivity in the APBI-DIL4 membranes. It leads to an increase in PAdop in the membranes.
 Fig. 5  SEM and EDX Si-mapping images of the surface morphology of (a) PBI-DIL4, (b) PBI-DIL4.5, (c) PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5, and (d) PBI-DIL4.5-MDA2 membranes. SEM images of the cross-section morphology of (a′) PBI-DIL4, (b′) PBI-DIL4.5, (c′) PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5, and (d′) PBI-DIL4.5-MDA2 membranes. 
However, the uniform surface is not observed in the SEM image of the PBI-DIL4.5 membranes (Fig. 5(b)). It appears that there is a defect in the pr(mim)2Br2 distribution, which leads to a non-uniform structure of the cross-section of the PBI-DIL4.5 membranes (Fig. 5(b′)).
This non-uniform structure can be due to the accumulation of pr(mim)2Br2 in the PBI-DIL4.5 membrane structure. The self-accumulation of pr(mim)2Br2, by preventing the interaction between pr(mim)2Br2 and the PBI matrix, leads to an increase in distance between the PBI polymer and pr(mim)2Br2. This created phase separation can have a negative effect on the electrochemical properties, and mechanical and chemical stability of the APBI-DIL4.5 membranes. It blocks open free spaces between pr(mim)2Br2 and PA and access of protons decreases to active positions for hydrogen interactions. In this case, the mobility of protons is low and proton exchange is difficult. It can be due to the prolongation of the proton jump pathway.
During the accumulation of pr(mim)2Br2 the decrease of the distance between the cations and anions of pr(mim)2Br2 in the PBI-DIL4.5 membranes and an increase in the nature of the van der Waals bond between the imidazolium ring and Br− also occur. As a result, the observed decrease in the PAdop and proton conductivity of the PBI-DIL4.5 membranes is due to the accumulation of pr(mim)2Br2, the decrease in the ionic strength of pr(mim)2Br2 and the strong interactions between its cations. Collectively, this accumulation results in a reduction in the specific surface area of these membranes for hydrogen interactions, PA adsorption, and proton exchange. On the other hand, the proton and PA access to the imidazolium ring and Br− is reduced due to the increased tendency of pr(mim)2Br2 to interact with each other.


3.3.2. SEM and EDX study of PBI-DIL4.5-MDAy composite membranes. 
In Fig. 5(c), the SEM image of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes shows a uniform and smooth surface. In the EDX Si-mapping image of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membrane surface is observed a uniform distribution of Si particles, which indicates a homogeneous distribution of MDA-SBA-15 in the composite membrane matrix. In addition, the apparently uniform image of the cross-section of the composite membrane is shown (Fig. 5(c′)).
Considering the non-uniform surface, and non-homogeneous distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 in the PBI-DIL4.5 membranes, the SEM surface image of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes indicates that MDA-SBA-15 can lead to a better distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 in the composite membrane matrix, and decrease the tendency of pr(mim)2Br2 to undergo self-accumulation, because MDA-SBA-15 can provide a wider surface for interaction with pr(mim)2Br2 through the Si–OH groups, and, most importantly, multiple pores with a free volume (containing NH2 and MDA groups) in the composite membrane matrix. Hence, the presence of MDA-SBA-15 is also accompanied by an increase in the membrane's capacity for more content of pr(mim)2Br2 (4.5% w/w). The wide network of hydrogen bonds by the uniform distribution of the particles in the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes can provide continuous pathways for proton exchange.43 Hence, the reduction in the length of the jump pathway of protons and the Ea required for their passage can lead to a significant improvement in the proton conductivity, and the PAdop of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes compared to the PBI-DIL4 membranes.

Fig. 5(d), the SEM image of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA2 composite membranes, does not show a smooth surface. Structural defects are also observed in the cross-section morphology of the composite membranes (Fig. 5(d′)). In addition, the accumulation of Si particles is observed in the EDX Si-mapping image of the composite membrane surface, which indicates a non-homogeneous distribution of MDA-SBA-15. Hence, the decrease in the PAdop and proton conductivity of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA2 composite membranes can be due to the non-homogeneous distribution of MDA-SBA-15 in the structure of the composite membranes. With the self-accumulation of MDA-SBA-15, some of its active sites are likely blocked for PA absorption, and interaction with the composite membrane matrix. It leads to the elimination of pathways for proton exchange. As a result, the morphology of the membranes affects the physical, and electrochemical properties of the membranes.


3.3.3. XRD study of membranes. 
XRD results of the PBI-DIL4 membranes (Fig. 6) show a broad reflection at about 2θ = 24° at a lower intensity than the pure PBI membranes, which is the characteristic peak of the pure PBI membrane.46
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of PBI, PBI-DIL4, and PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes, SBA-15, and MDA-SBA-15 and TEM image of the morphology of MDA-SBA-15. 
This observed decline in the peak intensity of the PBI-DIL4 membranes is related to the uniform distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 among the PBI polymer chains, because the presence of pr(mim)2Br2 in the polymer chains and its interaction with the hydrophilic regions of the polymer is associated with a decrease in the interaction between the polymer backbones. The plasticizing properties of pr(mim)2Br2, on the other hand, can contribute to the irregularity of PBI polymer chains, and ultimately to the amorphous nature of the membrane. Finally, the PBI-DIL4 membranes are more flexible than the PBI membranes.49
As shown in Fig. 6, the single strong peak at 2θ = 1.2° can be indexed as the (100) plane, and the two weak peaks observed at 1.6° and 1.8° correspond to the (110) and (200) planes, respectively. This represents the hexagonal structure of MDA-SBA-15 and SBA-15. Pores with hexagonal structure are also observed in TEM images of SBA-15 (see Fig. 2(c)), and MDA-SBA-15. However, the intensity of the MDA-SBA-15 peak has decreased compared to SBA-15. Because the intensity of the peaks shows the crystallinity of the mesoporous silica, this decline can be due to the presence of NH2 and MDA functional groups within the pores of SBA-15. In other words, the organic functional groups increase the amorphous nature of MDA-SBA-15.38
The XRD pattern of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes does not show the peaks of sample MDA-SBA-15. This can be due to the small amount of MDA-SBA-15 added and peak overlap. Only a strong peak is observed at about 2θ = 24° at a higher intensity than the PBI-DIL4 membranes, which is the main peak of the pure PBI membrane. This greater intensity can be due to the uniform distribution of MDA-SBA-15 in the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membrane matrix and the formation of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces between MDA-SBA-15 and the composite membrane matrix. These interactions lead to a decrease in the plasticizing effect of pr(mim)2Br2 and improved suitable interactions between PBI hydrophobic domains in the composite membranes. The penetration of MDA-SBA-15 into the crystalline polymer region also increases the amorphous nature of the PBI polymer. The same factor increases the ability of proton exchange of the composite membranes.

3.4. The retainability of PA and pr(mim)2Br2
The stability of proton conductive agents is one of the important parameters of PEMs during HT-PEMFC performance in the long term. The stability behavior of the membranes is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Time dependence of the weight loss of (a) APBI, APBI-DIL4, APBI-DIL4-SBA3 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes, and proton conductivity of PA-doped and PA-leached PBI, PBI-DIL4 and PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes. Time-stability plots of the proton conductivity of (b) APBI-DIL4, APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes at 180 °C and 3D AFM surface images of the membranes. 
The weight loss of the membranes as a function of time is observed after the membranes were kept hanging over boiling water as shown in Fig. 7(a). The 32.4% weight loss in the APBI membranes is related to the removal of PA after hanging over boiling water. With the introduction of pr(mim)2Br2 into the PBI membrane matrix, the weight loss occurs with a lesser slope. This improvement in the resistance of the APBI-DIL4 membranes against weight loss (PA leaching) is due to the homogeneous distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 among PBI polymer chains and its high ability to further interact with PA. The connections formed by hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic forces between active sites of pr(mim)2Br2 and PBI polymer chains increase the contact surface of PA, and the PBI-DIL4 membrane matrix. According to Fig. 7(a), the APBI-DIL4 membranes show a weight loss of 21.50% after 5 h of hanging over boiling water. This 21.5% weight loss, in addition to removing free PA, may be related to pr(mim)2Br2 leaching from the APBI-DIL4 membranes, because the mobility of PBI polymer chains at high temperatures can increase pr(mim)2Br2's tendency to exit the membrane matrix by water vapor due to the decreased interaction between pr(mim)2Br2 and the PBI polymer.28
By comparing the time-dependent weight loss of these APBI-DIL4 and APBI-DIL4-SBA3 membranes, it is found that the porous structure of SBA-15 plays a positive role in improving the stability of the PA doped PBI based membranes containing pr(mim)2Br2. Based on the values, the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 and APBI-DIL4-SBA3 composite membranes exhibit a weight loss of 11.32% and 16.41%, respectively, after 5 h of hanging over boiling water. The observed improvement in durability of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes is most likely due to the susceptibility of the pores of MDA-SBA-15 for better protection of PA and pr(mim)2Br2. This high potential of MDA-SBA-15 is due to the presence of NH2 and MDA groups in the inner wall of its pores, and their ability to form hydrogen interactions.41–43 As a result, the tube-like pores of MDA-SBA-15 as barriers can protect pr(mim)2Br2 and PA against a flow of boiling water vapor in the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes.
Decreasing the pore diameter of MDA-SBA-15 (4.7 nm) relative to SBA-15 (7.0 nm), on the other hand, can be an effective factor in the ability of MDA-SBA-15 to trap PA and pr(mim)2Br2.28–30 Consequently, the lower pore diameter together with the NH2 and MDA groups in the inner wall of MDA-SBA-15 pores contributes to increased interaction between PA, pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15. Collectively, increasing these interactions results in better preservation of PA and pr(mim)2Br2 against their release from the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes when hanging over boiling water.
The homogeneous distributions of MDA-SBA-15, and pr(mim)2Br2, on the other hand, are reasons for the increase in resistance of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes against PA and pr(mim)2Br2 leaching, because these factors lead to the development of intermolecular interactions, and the greater durability of PA, and pr(mim)2Br2 in the composite membranes. All the factors can overcome the negative effect of the movement of polymer chains on the stability of pr(mim)2Br2 in the long term.
In Fig. 7(b), the 3D AFM surface images of the PBI-DIL4 and PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes show a roughness. This surface roughness, on the other hand, can help to better preserve PA and pr(mim)2Br2, owing to the increased specific surface area of the membrane, and greater interaction of the membrane surface with PA, and pr(mim)2Br2. Thus, the development of hydrogen, and electrostatic interactions between the surface of these membranes, PA and pr(mim)2Br2 improves the membrane's stability against their leaching during long-term operation at high temperatures.
The average surface roughness of the PBI-DIL4 and PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes was found to be 13.5 nm and 20.6 nm, respectively. As a result, PA and pr(mim)2Br2 are retained with more force against their exit from the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membrane structure compared to the APBI-DIL4 membranes.

Fig. 7(a) demonstrates the proton conductivity of PA-doped, and PA-leached PBI, PBI-DIL4 and PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes in a temperature range of 80 °C to 180 °C. According to the results, the PA-leached PBI membranes exhibit a very low proton conductivity compared to the PA-doped PBI membranes at all temperatures. The ionic conductivity reduction is due to the removing of free PA as the main factor for proton conductivity by water vapor in APBI membranes. However, there is not much difference in the proton conductivity of the PA-leached PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes. The results indicate that a large percentage of PA and pr(mim)2Br2 remains in the PA-doped PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes after hanging over boiling water vapor.
In Fig. 7(b), the time-dependent proton conductivity of the APBI-DIL4 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes is observed at 180 °C. According to the results, the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes have a slight decrease in proton conductivity compared to the APBI-DIL4 membranes.
It is know that the dehydration of PA and the formation of oligomers similar to pyrophosphoric acid at ≥140 °C lead to proton conductivity reduction of PA doped PBI membranes in long-term operation. The introduction of pr(mim)2Br2 with high thermal stability acts as a PA substitute under these conditions, and can prevent the loss of proton conductivity, because the uniform distribution of pr(mim)2Br2 among the PBI polymer chains can provide ion channels for proton transfer in the APBI-DIL4 membranes. These interactions formed between the protons, and pr(mim)2Br2, including hydrogen bonding CH3–N⋯H+ and electrostatic forces Br−⋯H+, provide more active sites for proton exchange in the APBI-DIL4 membranes.
Collectively, in addition to PA as a proton exchange agent, these ionic pathways (imidazolium rings and Br−) also participate in accelerating proton transfer and improving the durability of the proton conductivity of the APBI-DIL4 membranes. On the other hand, the introduction of MDA-SBA-15 into the matrix of these membranes is associated with providing special conditions for improving the conductivity, and durability of proton exchange agents. Hydrogen bonds based on HO– groups on the MDA-SBA-15 surface and Si–O–Si networks into its pores lead to the development of new pathways for proton conduction in the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes. More importantly, the hydrogen bonds based on N atoms (NH2 and MDA groups) in the pores of MDA-SBA-15 provide a wide network of hydrogen bonds for the transfer of protons to the cathode electrode.
The homogeneous distribution of MDA-SBA-15 in the composite membrane structure (see Fig. 5), on the other hand, is the main reason for this observation. The hexagonal channels of MDA-SBA-15 can have an important role in the trapping of pr(mim)2Br2 and PA. This is due to the presence of the NH2 and MDA groups of MDA-SBA-15, similar to the hands attached to pr(mim)2Br2 and PA, through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces.
Consequently, all the factors mentioned above contribute to the improvement of the proton conductivity and high durability of the PA doped PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes at 180 °C after 50 h of continuous operation. Based on the time-dependent proton conductivity results of these membranes at 180 °C, the proton conductivity of the PA doped PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes decreases from 0.224 S cm−1 to 0.206 S cm−1 after 30 h of continuous operation. Then it reaches a constant value.
3.5. Thermal and chemical stability
Thermal stability is one of the main characteristics of the membranes in HT-PEMFC applications. The effect of the simultaneous presence of MDA-SBA-15, and pr(mim)2Br2 was investigated on the thermal stability of the membranes. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the weight loss occurs in four stages in the membrane samples. The reduction in the temperature range 70–120 °C is related to the evaporation of water molecules from the membranes. The water molecules bonded to the membrane by hydrogen interactions evaporate at higher temperature compared to free-water molecules (no interaction with the membrane matrix). The temperature range of 140–200 °C is related to pyrolysis of PA in the membrane samples, which leads to a reduction in the weight of the membranes.46–48

Also at temperatures above 150 °C, the weight loss can be due to the decomposition of organic chains, PBI, pr(mim)2Br2, or MDA-SBA-15 in the membrane samples. Therefore, the maximum reduction in weight at temperatures above 600 °C is related to the decomposition of the PBI organic chain and the dehydration of the silicate networks in MDA-SBA-15.38,46,48 The range of weight loss (PA pyrolysis) in the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes shows an improvement in thermal stability of PA relative to the APBI-DIL4 membranes. These results can confirm the existence of effective interactions between PA, NH2, MDA, Si–OH, and pr(mim)2Br2.
The chemical strength of membranes also is essential in HT-PEMFC applications. The results obtained for the chemical stability of the membranes by the Fenton test at 80 °C for 10 h are shown in Fig. 8(b). The maximum remaining weight is 97.78% after 10 h, which is related to the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes. The improvement in the chemical stability against radical species of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl can be due to the uniform dispersion of pr(mim)2Br2 and MDA-SBA-15 among PBI polymer chains. Hence, the wide network of hydrogen bonds formed in the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes acts as a barrier against the attack of radical species to the carbon atom linking benzimidazole rings and the structure of the polymer chains. However, under the same conditions, the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA2 composite membranes exhibit a smaller residual weight. It can be attributed to the non-homogeneous distribution of MDA-SBA-15 in the membrane matrix and a lack of proper interaction between MDA-SBA-15, pr(mim)2Br2 and PBI polymer chains. Eventually, this phase separation paves the way for membrane degradation.
3.6. Mechanical stability
The mechanical stability of a membrane is also an important feature for its use as a PEM in fuel cell applications. Therefore, the membrane should exhibit small changes in its dimensions against expansion and contraction due to temperature variations, hydration, and the existing pressure due to the electrode, dipole plates, and gas emission layers. Accordingly, the mechanical properties of the APBI, APBI-DILx and APBI-DIL4.5-MDAy membranes were evaluated to determine their mechanical behavior against these pressures. The obtained results are plotted in Fig. 8.
As shown in Fig. 8(c), by adding pr(mim)2Br2 up to 4% into the PBI polymer, the tensile strength, and modulus of the PBI membranes are reduced from 19.90 MPa to 14.10 MPa and from 0.38 GPa to 0.24 GPa, respectively. For the PBI, and PBI-DIL4 membranes an elongation at break of 49.91% and 62.03%, respectively, is also observed. Based on these values, the APBI-DIL4 membranes exhibit less mechanical stability than the APBI membrane. This can be related to the plasticizing properties of pr(mim)2Br2, which increases the length of the membranes against the applied pressure, and subsequently decreases the mechanical stability, and modulus of the membranes. The existence of interactions between active sites of pr(mim)2Br2 and PBI polymer chains increases the adhesion of the membrane matrix, but the plasticizing properties of pr(mim)2Br2 are slightly dominant in the positive effect of the interactions on the mechanical stability of the membranes. Finally, the mechanical stability of the membranes reduces.26
According to Fig. 8(d), with the increase of the MDA-SBA-15 content up to 1.5% in the PBI polymer matrix containing pr(mim)2Br2, the tensile strength and modulus improve to 42.30 MPa and 0.58 GPa, respectively. This can be due to the wide surface area of MDA-SBA-15, the NH2, MDA and Si–OH groups and their special ability to form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces with pr(mim)2Br2, PBI and PA. The increase in the length of the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes also decreases to 27.12%, owing to the reduced mobility of the polymer chains and the composite membrane hardening.33,34 These factors can be reasons for the better retention of PA and pr(mim)2Br2 in the PBI polymer chains and the stability of the proton conductivity of the composite membranes during long-term operation of PEMFCs under high temperatures. By comparing the mechanical properties of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membrane with other membranes (Table 2), it can be concluded that the presence of MDA-SBA-15 in the PBI polymer matrix improves the mechanical stability of the composite membranes.
3.7. Fuel cell performance
The electrochemical properties of membranes are also an important factor in determining the efficiency of HT-PEMFCs. Hence, the improvement of the PEMFC performance involving APBI, APBI-DIL4 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes was evaluated from 120 °C to 180 °C under dry conditions. For a good comparison, the inherent properties of the membranes, thickness, amount of platinum loading on the electrodes, and the flow rate of H2/O2 gases were kept almost constant in the PEMFCs.
Based on the polarization curves in Fig. 9, all the membranes show a low voltage drop in the low current density (activation polarization) region with increasing temperature, because the increase in temperature is accompanied by the improvement of the kinetics of electrode reactions, faster electron transfer, and ultimately a decrease in the activation loss. As shown at moderate current density (ohmic polarization region), the linear drop of the cell potential with current density is the difference for the APBI, APBI-DIL4 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes. The observed ohmic drop is related to the resistance of the membranes against proton transfer, and the resistance of the electrocatalytic layers against flow of electrons, which act as limiting factors of current density in fuel cells, so that the APBI-DIL4 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes with high proton conductivity and easier proton exchange show a lower voltage drop compared to APBI membranes in this ohmic polarization region, especially at 180 °C. According to Fig. 9(a), current densities of 0.41 A cm−2 and 0.80 A cm−2 are observed for the APBI-DIL4 and APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 membranes at 0.50 V and 120 °C, respectively. The current density shifted to a higher current of 1.18 A cm−2 with a higher power density of 0.60 W cm−2 at 0.50 V and 180 °C in HT-PEMFCs based on the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes. Hence, there is a significant increase in the HT-PEMFC performance based on the composite membranes compared to the APBI and APBI-DIL4 membranes, with increasing operating temperature.

Increasing temperature results in membrane resistance reduction to proton exchange and accelerated proton migration to the cathode. The use of MEAs based on the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes with high potential for proton exchange leads to an acceleration in the O2 reduction and improves the current density of the HT-PEMFCs. As a result, the increase in the conversion rate of stored chemical energy in H2 to electrical energy exhibits a lower voltage drop in the PBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes in the activation polarization region.
In general, improving the proton conductivity and increasing the speed of electron transport reduce the voltage drop in the ohmic polarization region in HT-PEMFCs based on the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes. The surface roughness of the composite membranes, and the homogeneous distribution of MDA-SBA-15 and pr(mim)2Br2 with its plasticizing properties can also lead to an increase in the adhesion and contact surface between the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membrane and the electrocatalyst layers. Ultimately, the performance of the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes improves due to the development of more surface area for electrochemical reactions and decreasing the contact resistance of the joint surface of the electrode and membrane. According to the value reported for PBI-based membranes (Table 2), there is a significant improvement in the performance of HT-PEMFCs based on the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes. This is related logically to the high proton conductivity, and chemical and mechanical stability, as well as the enhancement of the kinetics of electrochemical reactions of the MEA based on the composite membranes. The experimental results show that the APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes are suitable for use in PEMFC applications at high temperatures.
4. Conclusions
In this work, composite membranes were prepared by introducing SBA-15, and functionalized SBA-15 with NH2 and MDA groups into a PBI matrix containing pr(mim)2Br2. In order to evaluate the effect of the porous structure and the importance of their functional groups on improving the membrane properties, PAdop, the proton conductivity and the time-dependent weight loss of the APBI-DIL4-SBAs composite membranes were investigated. The effect of MDA-SBA-15 was investigated on PAdop, the proton conductivity, the chemical stability and the mechanical properties. The effect of temperature increase on the PEMFC performance of the composite membranes was investigated in a temperature range of 120–180 °C. The APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes show a proton conductivity of 0.22 S cm−1 and a good lifetime at 180 °C in dry conditions. Hence, the modification of Si-OH groups of SBA-15 pores with proton host groups (MDA and NH2 groups) as proton exchange sites provides many pathways for proton migration by the creation of a network of hydrogen bonds. The pores of MDA-SBA-15 also display an important role in the protection of PA and pr(mim)2Br2 against the water vapor produced by the cathode during the HT-PEMFC process in long term operation. The APBI-DIL4.5-MDA1.5 composite membranes exhibit a power density of 0.60 W cm−2 and a current density of 1.18 A cm−2 at 0.50 V and 180 °C under dry conditions. With the introduction of MDA-SBA-15 and its homogeneous distribution in the composite membrane matrix, the mechanical strength and the chemical stability improve, significantly. The results show that MDA-SBA-15 with special properties can help to solve the major technical challenges in the use of PA doped PBI membranes containing pr(mim)2Br2. It also improves the long-term durability of the PEMs and the efficiency of HT-PEMFC performance.
