    , Accepted 5th September 2018First published on 5th September 2018AbstractA series of donor–acceptor fluorophores containing the biscyanovinyl dithienebenzothiadiazole central unit with 4-alkoxyphenyl groups at both sides were synthesized. These compounds can display smectic C and hexagonal columnar mesophases in their bulk states, and aggregate into organogels as well as cubic or needle crystals in organic solvents. These cubic or needle crystals exhibit optical waveguide behavior. Additionally, these compounds can exhibit broad absorption up to 625 nm with a narrow band gap of 1.79 eV. The fluorescence emission of these compounds in CHCl3 can be quenched upon addition of C70. Furthermore, these compounds can detect Cu2+ among a series of cations.
1. Introduction
π-Conjugated polymers and small organic molecules have attracted widespread attention due to their potential applications in photoelectronic devices. However defects in a polymeric backbone can lead to irreproducible performance and unstable device efficiency. π-Conjugated small organic molecules can be obtained with high purity and synthesized with controllable molecular weights. The well-defined characteristics of conjugated small molecules can further aggregate into ordered supramolecular structures, which facilitate the optimal performance of molecular devices.1,2
A cyano group is highly polarisable with a large permanent dipole moment. It has been used to construct mesogens because it can cause strong dipole–dipole interactions.3 The introduction of a cyano group onto the scaffold of a π-conjugated oligomer or polymer can largely lower the LUMO level of the molecules.4 α-Cyanostilbene derivatives have developed as light-active luminescent molecules, with aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE) effects for various applications.5
As a strong electron acceptor unit, benzothiadiazole (BTD) has been used to tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of low band gap fluorophores.6,7 BTD-based fluorophores showed great potential in light-emitting diodes,8 chemosensors,9 solar cells,10 light harvesting, and many others.11
Up to now, only a few derivatives consisting of BTD and α-cyanostilbene were reported, the overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the photovoltaic devices based on such derivatives are between 0.1 and 5.6%.12 So far as we know, there is only one report about the liquid crystalline properties of BTD α-cyanostilbene derivatives, and only smectic phases were roughly described.13 It is commonly considered that mesomorphism would be favorable for better molecular packing and helpful for good photovoltaic performance.14 Therefore herein we have designed and synthesized a series of mesogenic D–A fluorophores which consists of the biscyanovinyl dithienebenzothiadiazole central unit with 4-alkoxyphenyl groups at both sides. The main goal of this study is as follows: firstly to study the mesomorphic behaviors of these compounds and establish the relationship between the molecular structure and mesophasic properties; secondly to study the photophysical properties of these compounds as well as their potentials as functional molecular devices.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
Altogether six compounds were synthesized, including five dicatenars I1/n (n = 10–18) and one hexacatenar I3/16. These target compounds Im/n (the superscript m and the number n stand for the number and the length of the terminal alkyl chains respectively) were synthesized via Knoevenagel and Suzuki reactions as key steps (Scheme 1). Firstly, 4-hydroxybenzyl cyanide 4 was etherified with an appropriate halide. The Knoevenagel reactions between 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde 6 and phenylacetonitrile 5m/n gave compounds 7m/n. Upon borylation with bis(pinacolato)diborane, 7m/n were changed to compounds 8m/n. The Suzuki reaction between compounds 8m/n and 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole 39 gave the final products, which were purified by column chromatography. More details of procedures and the corresponding analysis data are summarized in the ESI.†

2.2. Mesomorphic properties
The mesomorphic properties of compounds Im/n were investigated by polarized optical microscopy (POM, Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. S2, ESI†) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 1b, 2a and Fig. S3, ESI†). The mesomorphic properties of compounds Im/n are provided in Table 1. More detailed data are listed in Tables S1–S6 (ESI†).

2.2.1. Smectic C phase. 
All compounds were enantiotropic LCs. For the dicatenar compounds I1/n (n = 10–18), elongation of the terminal alkyl chain length led to a decrease in both the melting and clearing temperatures (Table 1).
Polarized optical schlieren textures (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a–d, ESI†) suggested that all dicatenar compounds self-assembled into the SmC phase.16 The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns of these smectic phases (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3, ESI†) showed two reflection peaks in the small angle region with a ratio of d001/d002 ≈ 2, confirming the smectic organization.3 The layer spacing of the representative compound I1/14 is about d = 4.34 nm at 247 °C (Table S3, ESI†), which is shorter than the calculated molecular length (Lmax = 5.82 nm),17 indicating a monolayer SmC phase. The tilt angle was calculated to be θ ≈ 42° (based on the relationship cosθ = d/Lmax) from the layer normal (Fig. 1c). These diameters were also consistent with the sizes of the cores (green) and alkyl chains (white) in the molecular dynamics (MD) annealed model18 as shown in Fig. 1d.


2.2.2. Hexagonal columnar phase. 
The columnar phase of the hexacatenar I3/16 which showed spherulitic fan-like textures was characterized by POM (Fig. S1e, ESI†). The SAXS pattern of the columnar phase of I3/16 (Fig. 2a) showed three small-angle reflection peaks at 4.70 (10), 2.72 (11), and 2.37 (20) nm with a reciprocal spacing ratio of 1:31/2:2, indicating a hexagonal columnar (Colhex) arrangement.19 The number of molecules (μ) in a slice of the columns with a height of h = 0.45 nm (maximum of the diffuse wide angle scattering) was calculated to be about three (Table 1). Thus three molecules self-assemble into a flat disc (Fig. 2c). In order to magnify the dipolar interactions, the central BTD dipole should point to the centre of the supramolecular disc. Then the discs further pile up into columns with 60° alternation along the columnar axis from one disc to the next. The space surrounding the column can be filled by the interlocking and folding of the alkyl chains.20 The model of the hexagonal columnar phase is shown in Fig. 2c. It should be noted that the intermolecular π–π interactions, the strong dipole–dipole interactions caused by the cyano, BTD, thiophene groups, as well as the microsegregation of the rigid aromatic core from the peripheral alkyl chains would drive the molecular assembly into the columnar structures. The length of the biscyanovinyl dithienebenzothiadiazole central unit is 3.15 nm, which corresponds to the diameter of the regions of the medium electron density (green) as shown in Fig. 2b. These diameters are also in good agreement with the sizes of the cores (green) and alkyl chains (off-white) in the molecular dynamics (MD) annealed model shown in Fig. 2d.21,22 The alkyl chains are completely disordered and partly interdigitated in the continuum of low electron density around these columns.

2.3. Gelation properties
The gelation abilities of compounds Im/n for different organic solvents were evaluated at a critical gelation concentration (CGC) of 4.0 mg mL−1 (Table 2). The relationship of the gel stability and Tgel (the temperature at which the gel is broken) indicated that the gel stability increased with increasing the gelator concentration (Fig. S5, ESI†). The representative dicatenar compound I1/16 cannot form a gel, while compound I3/16 can form a gel in ethyl acetate:petroleum ether = 1:1. A blackred gel was formed in ethyl acetate:petroleum ether = 1:1 upon cooling the heated solution of compound I3/16 to room temperature (Fig. 3a and Fig. S6, ESI†). The morphology of the xerogel formed by I3/16 was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 3b shows the formation of three-dimensional fibrous networks. The length of the fibers is more than 20 μm with a diameter of 0.27–1.35 μm. It should be mentioned that there is no gelating functional groups such as amide, cholesterol, triazol, acetylene, etc. in the structure of compound I3/16, therefore the gelation properties of compound I3/16 in solution should be mainly promoted by the donor–acceptor interaction, π–π interactions and van der Waals forces.

2.4. Absorption and emission properties
The UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of two representative compounds I1/16 and I3/16 in DCM are shown in Fig. 4. Compounds I1/16 and I3/16 exhibited dual-band absorptions in ranges of 330–440 nm and 440–625 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition and the internal charge transfer (ICT) transition between the donor and acceptor units, respectively.14d,23 The emission bands are in the range of 632–653 nm, therefore the Stokes shifts are 111–136 nm. The absorption and emission spectra of I1/16 and I3/16 have similar shapes, indicating that the electronic properties of both compounds are dictated by a similar extended chromophore. The absorption edge of I1/16 is red shifted slightly compared to that of I3/16, which indicates that the terminal alkoxy substituent in I1/16 is a better donor than the benzyloxy moiety in I3/16.

The solvatochromic behaviors of compounds Im/n were investigated in organic solvents with different polarities from toluene to THF (shown in Fig. S7, ESI†) and the photophysical data are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S7g (ESI†), the solvent polarity has less impact on the absorption spectra of I1/16, which exhibits two prominent bands at λ = 330–440 nm and λ = 440–625 nm. The fluorescence spectra (Fig. S7h, ESI†) however evidently showed solvatochromism (red-shifted from 632 nm in toluene to 653 nm in THF) as the polarity of solvents increased. Therefore Im/n exhibit large Stokes shifts (111–136 nm). The wavelength ranges of compounds Im/n are close to near infrared and wider than those of the literature reported on biscyanovinyl dithienebenzothiadiazole analogues.24–26 The ICT effect would cause the solvatochromism in fluorescence. Because ICT compounds usually have large dipole moments in the excited state, the dipole–dipole interactions between the polar solvent and ICT compounds would reduce the energy of the excited state.27
The energy band gaps of compounds I1/16 and I3/16 estimated from the UV spectra of the thin film was found to be about 1.79 eV (Fig. S8, ESI†).28 Using the Gaussian 09 software, by density functional theory (DFT) based on B3LYP with the polarized 6-31G(d) basis set,29 the ground-state geometries and electronic structures of I1/16 and I3/16 were calculated. The electron distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of I1/16 and I3/16, in which the alkoxy chains are replaced by methoxy groups, are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The calculation results show that the central dithienebenzothiadiazole moiety with its two adjacent cyanovinyl 4-alkoxyphenyl units represents a large conjugated planar conformation. Meanwhile the structure of I3/16 appears slightly non-planar from the methylene connected to the terminal alkoxyphenyl moieties. In these two compounds, the electron densities of the HOMO are localized on the rigid π-conjugated dithienebenzothiadiazole and cyanovinyl 4-alkoxyphenyl units. However in the LUMO, the electrons are localized on the central of the dithienbenzothiadiazole unit. This indicates that during excitation of the molecules from the HOMO to LUMO energy levels, charge transfer from the alkoxyphenyl units to the central dithienebenzothiadiazole moiety might have occurred. Such photophysical properties indicate that these molecules could be used for the fabrication of high-performance solution processable photoelectrical molecular devices such as OPVs and OLEDs.
It was found that the fluorescence emission of I1/16 could be significantly quenched as the concentration of C70 increased (Fig. 5 and Fig. S10, ESI†). This phenomenon indicates the presence of the photoinduced charge separation process between I1/16 and C70.30 To further study the quenching constant (KSV) of C70 to I1/16, the dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the concentration of C70 at low quencher concentrations was analyzed. This agrees with the Stern–Volmer equation.F0/F = 1 + KSV·CHere, F0 and F represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of C70, respectively, and C is the concentration of C70. The KSV value of I1/16 is 1.7 × 104 M−1.

The charge separation led to photoinduced electron transfer. Therefore, electron transfer could exist between the BTD fluorophore and C70,31 and this indicates that the BTD fluorophore–fullerene blend was the favorable component for the fabrication of highly efficient photovoltaic (PV) cells.
2.5. Optical waveguide behavior
Compounds I1/n (n = 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18) can form needle crystals in DCM/MeOH and cubic crystals in THF/petroleum ether (Fig. 6 and Fig. S11, ESI†). For compound I1/18, the needle aggregates are about 1.7–6.7 μm in width and 128–267 μm in length (Fig. S11i, ESI†), whereas the cubic aggregates are about 3.7–10 μm in width (Fig. S11j, ESI†). These aggregates were investigated by a fluorescence microscopy. Irradiated with a light beam at different λ values, these aggregates exhibited very bright red luminescence at both sides but relatively weaker emission from the body. This suggests that these compounds exhibited optical waveguide behavior.32 This shows that these solvated crystals could be used as light-emitting and propagation materials in miniaturized optoelectronic devices.

2.6. Chemosensor behavior
The selective binding abilities of compounds Im/n towards different metal ions (all anions are ClO4−), including Ag+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, K+, Li+, Mg2+, Ni+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, Fe3+ and Al3+, were examined. The concentration of all metal ions is 10−3 mol L−1. All compounds Im/n can recognize Cu2+. The result of the representative compound I1/10 is shown in Fig. 7. The fluorescence spectra of I1/10 upon the addition of 20 equiv. of selected cations in CH3CN:DCM = 2:1 solution were investigated. No obvious change of the fluorescence intensity of compound I1/10 upon the addition of most metal ions was observed. Only with the increasing addition of Cu2+ (Fig. 7a and Fig. S12a, ESI†), obvious fluorescence quenching was observed. The selective response of I1/10 to Cu2+ can be detected by the naked eye as shown in Fig. 7b. The selective response of I1/10 to Cu2+ was examined by fluorescence titration with the addition of Cu2+ (from 0 to 25 equiv.) in a solution of CH3CN:DCM = 2:1. It was clearly shown that the fluorescence reached its quenching plateau with the addition of about 16 equiv. of Cu2+ (Fig. S12b and c, ESI†).33 The calculated detection limit of I1/10 towards Cu2+ was 4.83 × 10−7 M based on 3σ/k34 (Fig. S13, ESI†), which is much lower than those of the reported α-cyanostilbene-based chemosensors.35 Therefore, compound I1/10 could be used as the Cu2+ chemosensor with high selectivity and low detection limit in the solution of CH3CN:DCM = 2:1. The binding stoichiometry was determined by Job's plot, indicating that compound I1/10 and Cu2+ could form a 1:1 complex (Fig. S14, ESI†). The FTIR spectrum of I1/10 (Fig. S15a, ESI†) indicates that the characteristic peak at 2310 cm−1 was assigned to the CN stretching vibration.36 After interaction with Cu2+, the peak of the CN stretching vibration showed an obvious blue shift to 2248 cm−1. This indicates that the N atom of CN of compound I1/10 was the binding site. This also indicates that the coordination of Cu2+ with CN induced fluorescence quenching of Im/n solutions. Therefore the chelation enhanced quenching (CEQ) sensing mechanism37 was the main reason for inducing fluorescence quenching of Im/n solutions. In the FTIR spectra of I1/10 + other metal ions, the characteristic peaks at 2310 cm−1 showed little change (Fig. S15b, ESI†), indicating no binding interaction between Im/n and other metal ions. It should be noted that even though BTD α-cyanostilbene derivatives could display excellent fluorescence properties,12a,b,13,38,39 however their application as a fluorescent probe is less. Therefore, this should be the first time that the chemosensor behaviors of such compounds have been studied. The aggregation-induced emission (AIE) of biscyanovinyl dithienebenzothiadiazole has not been observed, probably ascribed to the strong fluorescence properties of BTD.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, D–A fluorophores based on cyanovinyl and BTD have been successfully synthesized. The liquid crystalline properties of these fluorophores were well investigated by POM, DSC and XRD. They can self-assemble into SmC and Colhex/p6mm phases. The suggested phase structures are based on XRD patterns, electron density reconstruction and simulations. The molecular packing models for these phase structures are well established. Additionally compound I3/16 can also self-assemble into an organogel in solvents. These fluorophores exhibit broad and strong absorption bands at the range of 330–625 nm with a red emissive color and large Stokes shifts. The fluorescence emission of compound I1/16 in CHCl3 was significantly quenched upon addition of C70, indicating the presence of electron transfer between BTD compounds and C70. In organic solvents, these red emissive molecules can form solvated crystals, which exhibit optical waveguide behavior. Finally, these compounds can act as chemosensors for the detection of Cu2+. Thus, these multifunctional materials can be potentially applied in diverse areas such as liquid crystals, chemosensors, red emission waveguides, etc.
