    , Accepted 9th April 2018First published on 9th April 2018AbstractA dihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct (NCBA) acceptor was introduced as a third component to typical poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(10,30-di-2-thienyl-50,70-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[10,20-c:40,50-c0]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T): 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:20,30-d0]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b0]-dithiophene (ITIC) binary polymer solar cells (PSCs). NCBA plays a bridging role between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PBDB-T and ITIC and provides more routes for charge carrier transfer at the interface between PBDB-T and ITIC, whereupon a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) could be realized upon the addition of NCBA relative to the neat ITIC as an electron acceptor. With the strong visible light absorption in the range from 300 to 520 nm of the NCBA molecule, it had the effect of apparently complementary visible light absorption compared with the binary PBDB-T:ITIC layer. The crystallinity and surface morphology of the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) thin films was similar to that of the binary PBDB-T:ITIC layer, which guaranteed suitable efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. The photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves, short-circuit current density (JSC), and VOC as a function of incident light intensity as well as the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) were measured, and the results illustrated the effects of NCBA as third component materials in terms of efficient exciton dissociation and reduced charge carrier recombination and loss. The PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs showed an optimized PCE value of 9.56% and better thermal stability after 10 h thermal annealing treatment (the normalized PCE value was 92.5% of the initial PCE value).
1. Introduction
The last decade has witnessed the rapid development of polymer solar cells (PSCs), and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 13% have been realized in different types of PSCs.1,2 The performance of PSCs is strongly correlated with the excitonic nature of the photoactive materials. However, despite the enormous strides achieved in the past several years, the insufficient partial absorption of solar irradiation and the lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) are still issues restraining the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.3 Third component materials with shallower energy level electron-acceptor materials and a deep energy level electron-acceptor added into the polymer donor have been used to fabricate PSCs, and these so-called ternary PSCs have shown tangible benefits. Owing to the fact that the light absorption properties, energy levels, and the crystallinity of the blended donor:acceptor1:acceptor2 thin films fabricated from ternary PSCs are beneficial to the short-circuit current density (JSC), VOC, and fill factor (FF), they have emerged as a promising alternative to overcome the PCE bottleneck in binary devices.4,5
Because of their broad absorption in the visible-near infrared region and strong extinction coefficient, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have been designed and synthesized and used to fabricate non-fullerene-based PSCs to obtain a higher JSC and high VOC compared with Fullerene-based PSCs.6,7 Hou et al. reported an efficient ITIC-based PSC with a medium bandgap polymer donor of PBDB-T and a non-fullerene acceptor of ITIC, and the PBDB-T:ITIC-PSCs exhibited a PCE of 11.21% with a JSC of 16.81 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.9 V, and FF of 74.2%.8 Chunru's group synthesized fullerene derivatives of dihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct (NCBA) as an electron acceptor.9,10 These derivatives have the advantage of improved absorption in the 300–500 nm region and a high VOC and PCE based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor material [0.82 V and 5.85% and similar photovoltaic parameters compared with indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as an electron acceptor, respectively], and the preparation of this material gives a high yield at mild temperatures.11–13 In addition, it exhibits higher thermally driven crystallization at temperatures higher than 280 °C, which illustrates its better heat stability compared to PCBM and PC71BM. Herein, we utilized two small molecules, ITIC and NCBA, as an acceptor, and combined them with a classical semiconductor material, PBDB-T, to probe the mechanisms of the photovoltaic parameters.
In this work, NCBA was employed as a third component material in PBDB-T:ITIC devices and partially replaced the ITIC acceptor materials. Owing to the shallower LUMO energy level of NCBA compared to ITIC and the bridging role it plays between PBDB-T and ITIC, a substantial improvement in VOC and efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transfer at the PBDB-T/ITIC interface with the addition of NCBA were realized. Studies into the effect of NCBA concentration on the photogeneration of charge carriers, the collection efficiency, and the photovoltaic performance were carried out in detail.
2. Experimental details
The fabrication method and parameters are shown in the ESI.† The PSCs had the structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC/MoO3/Ag. The charge carrier mobility was measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures “ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC/Au” and “Al/PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC/Al”, respectively. The chemical structures of PBDB-T, NCBA, and ITIC and the energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 1. The average photovoltaic parameters were obtained from five PSCs.

3. Results and discussion
The inverted PSC devices had a structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC/MoO3/Ag, where the weight ratio of PBDB-T:acceptor was 1:1 and the weight concentration of NCBA in the acceptor changed from 0 wt% to 20 wt% and 100 wt%. Fig. 2a presents the J–V curves of the PSCs with 0, 10, and 20 wt% NCBA concentrations as third component materials under AM 1.5 G illumination at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 lists all the PSC parameters. The NCBA concentration had an intense influence on the VOC, JSC, and FF values of the PSCs; whereby VOC increased with the NCBA concentration from 0.9 V (without NCBA) to 0.92 V (10 wt% NCBA concentration) and again increased to 0.94 V (20 wt% NCBA concentration) and 0.96 V (100 wt% NCBA concentration). The photovoltaic parameter exhibited a significant enhancement with increasing NCBA concentration, and reached the saturation state when the NCBA concentration was 10 wt%, while lower photovoltaic performance (8.21% and 4.89%) were obtained as the NCBA concentration reached 20 wt% and 100 wt%, respectively, even with a significant enhancement of the VOC (the value are 0.94 V and 0.96 V, respectively). These results can be attributed to the comprehensive decrease in FF and JSC as the NCBA concentration exceeded 10 wt%. The values of VOC, FF, and JSC were closely related to NCBA concentration. FF and JSC increased when the NCBA concentration was less than 10 wt% and reached their highest values at 10 wt% NCBA concentration, with a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 15.8 mA cm−2, an FF of 65.8%, and a corresponding PCE of 9.56%. Then, they decreased significantly upon further increasing the NCBA concentration from 10 to 20 wt% with a lower PCE of 8.21% and only half of the best PCE value with neat NCBA as an acceptor. Compared with the PBDB-T:ITIC binary devices, the ternary device with 10 wt% NCBA concentration exhibited comprehensively enhanced photovoltaic parameters (0.90 versus 0.92 V for VOC, 15.1 versus 15.8 mA cm−2 for JSC, 62.2% versus 65.8% for FF, and 8.45% versus 9.56% for PCE). The PBDB-T:NCBA-based PSCs (in which NCBA replaced all of the ITIC) exhibited poor photovoltaic performance, with the highest VOC of 0.96 V and the lowest JSC and FF values of 10.1 mA cm−2 and 50.4%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of PSCs with 0, 10, and 20 wt% NCBA concentration are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectrum was obviously enhanced between 350 and 580 nm when the weight ratio of NCBA in the blend acceptor materials was 10 wt% compared with the binary blend. The calculated JSC value was similar to that obtained from the J–V measurements (the calculated JSC values were 14.5, 15.2, and 13.4 mA cm−2 corresponding to NCBA concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 wt%, respectively, and the average error was approximately 4%). This clearly illustrates the agreement with the higher JSC values of the PSCs mentioned above. The enhancement in optical absorption should not be the only reason for this improvement in EQE with NCBA concentration. Therefore, there are some other changes that occur to affect the electrical properties of the photoactive layers after the addition of NCBA.

Fig. 2c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the three PSCs in the dark, where the PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1)-based PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs show a low reverse-bias current (leakage currents) and a large rectification ratio of over 104 at ±1 V. The current rectification ratio is defined as the ratio of the current at 1 V to the current at −1 V based on the dark J–V curves. The rectification ratios here were 3.52 × 104, 3.28 × 104, and 2.98 × 104 and correspond to the PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1)-based PSCs, PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs, and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs, respectively. The leakage current in PSCs can be considered an undesirable current that is injected from the electrodes prior to voltage turn-on, resulting in lower FF and JSC values.14 The large rectification ratio and low dark current at reverse bias indicate that the photoactive layer without and with the addition of a small amount of NCBA contains a very low density of defects compared with higher NCBA concentration PSCs, thus drastically reducing the parasitic shunt resistance effects that often dominate the electrical characteristics of PSCs under reverse bias.15,16
Along with the increasing NCBA concentration, the VOC value is increases. For charge carrier transfer mechanisms, the VOC value is close to that of binary PSCs, while the VOC value changes along with the addition of the third component materials for the parallel and alloy mechanisms.17,18 Previous studies of the role of material energetics in determining the VOC values of binary PSCs have led to the following empirical relation:19  where EAcceptorLUMO and EDonorHOMO are the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor, respectively, and the constant 0.3 V was determined empirically. When an acceptor is doped into π-conjugated polymers, the energy of the new molecular frontier orbital is influenced by the quasi-frontier orbital density (Ne) of these two acceptor materials, which could be calculated according to the following formula:20,21  where VOC Binary 1, VOC Binary 2, and VOC Ternary are the VOC values of binary PSCs and ternary PSCs, Ne1 and Ne2 are the quasi-frontier orbital densities of acceptor 1 and acceptor 2 in the acceptor, and f1 and f2 are the weight composition ratios of acceptor 1 and acceptor 2 in the blend acceptor. Thus, the shallower LUMO energy level of NCBA compared to ITIC and the LUMO energy level of the blend acceptor become shallower as the concentration of NCBA increases in the photoactive layer, which affects the VOC value of ternary PSCs and achieves the highest VOC value of PBDB-T:NCBA-based binary PSCs, even with a poor photovoltaic performance.
To further clarify the effect of adding NCBA into the PBDB-T:ITIC thin films on the EQE spectral shape, from Fig. S1a and S1b,† we measured the absorption spectra of the neat materials and blend thin films respectively. From Fig. S1a,† compared with neat ITIC and neat PBDB-T, the neat NCBA thin films showed a strong light absorption ability in the range from 300 to 520 nm, while they showed a weakened absorption ability in the range from 520 to 800 nm. After adding NCBA into the PBDB-T:ITIC thin films, the visible light absorption ratio of the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films was enhanced by 8% compared with the binary PBDB-T:ITIC layer. From Fig. S1b,† the absorption spectrum of the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) blend thin films shows apparently complementary in the short wavelength visible light absorption (the wavelength lower than 550 nm) compared with the binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin films, indicating that the photon harvesting ability of the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) blend thin films can be enhanced in the range from 300 to 550 nm, which corresponds to the NCBA absorption range. Meanwhile, a slight red-shift of 10 nm is caused upon NCBA replacement of the 10 wt% ITIC, which is attributed to the small amount of NCBA slightly increasing the intermolecular interaction between PDBD-T molecules.22,23 After all of the ITIC was replaced by NCBA, the absorption spectra were completely changed, and strong enhancements in the lower wavelength region (in the range 300–610 nm) were observed.
As can be seen from Fig. S2,† X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured to investigate the effect of NCBA concentration on the PBDB-T:ITIC thin films arrangement. The XRD patterns of the PBDB-T:ITIC thin films with NCBA concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 wt% are shown in Fig. S2.† The angles at which the peak intensities occur are related to the inter-planar distances of the atomic structure of the PBDB-T molecule and the crystallinity of the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films; these angles are related by Bragg's law:24λ = 2dsinθ,where λ is wavelength of the X-ray radiation used (0.154 nm), θ is the peak-position half-angle, and d is the inter-planar distance. The (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ are 5.28°, 5.47°, and 5.85° can be observed in the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC layer with NCBA concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 wt%, respectively, and are assigned to the PBDB-T peak. The corresponding d values are 1.672, 1.613, and 1.512 nm, respectively. The intensity of the (100) diffraction peak of the PBDB-T molecule was significantly enhanced for the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC blend thin films with 10 and 20 wt% NCBA concentrations in acceptor materials, which confirms that the appropriate amount of NCBA improves the molecular arrangement between PBDB-T molecules. The PBDB-T peak intensity increased from 0.34 (without NCBA) to 0.49 (with 10 wt% NCBA) and further increased to 0.62 (with 20 wt% NCBA), indicating that PBDB-T crystallinity could be enhanced by incorporating NCBA. The higher crystallinity of NCBA improved the conformation of PBDB-T molecules and enhanced the crystallinity of PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films.9,10,25 At higher NCBA concentrations, the crystallinity of the PBDB-T:ITIC thin films were completely changed, and the large phase of NCBA could form some electron traps in the PBDB-T/NCBA and NCBA/ITIC interfaces, which was perfectly consistent with the JSC and FF trends in the PSCs.
Thin film morphology plays an important role in determining the charge carrier mobility of the photoactive layer and the photovoltaic performance of OPV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to measure the surface morphology of the photoactive layers, respectively. The AFM images of thin films with different NCBA doping ratios are shown in Fig. S3a–d,† where it can be seen that binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin films and ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films with 10 wt% NCBA concentration show a slightly rough morphology and short grain size with a relatively lower root mean square (RMS) value of 6.8 nm and 7.4 nm, respectively. This means that the surface morphology of the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films with 10 wt% NCBA concentration had not been drastically disrupted compared with binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin films. However, the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films with 20 wt% NCBA concentration displayed a slightly higher RMS of 12.5 nm, while the RMS roughness of binary PBDB-T:NCBA thin film was significant enhances to about 175 nm. Thereafter the thin film surface of the binary PBDB-T:NCBA thin film turns rougher with NCBA replacing all the ITIC due to the NCBA molecular aggregation. Also, note that the grain size of thin film increases with increasing the NCBA concentration as well. This small RMS of binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin films and ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films with 10 wt% NCBA concentration might be due to the large amount of ITIC, which hinders the aggregation of PBDB-T and makes the thin film even. Generally, a smooth surface will provide full and complete contact between the photoactive layer and modified electrodes layer, which enables an improved charge carrier transfer between the photoactive layer and modified electrodes layer.26 Thus, the morphology photoactive layer can be finely adjusted by controlling the NCBA concentration in the acceptor. This high efficiency ternary strategy with NCBA as third component materials in binary PBDB-T:ITIC photoactive layer was well confirmed based on the PCE of 8.45% for PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs and the distinctly improved PCE of 9.56% for the ternary PSCs with 10 wt% NCBA as the third component materials, while the PCE was decreased to 8.21% for ternary PSCs with 20 wt% NCBA and strongly decreased to 4.89% for binary PBDB-T:NCBA-based PSCs.

Fig. 3a and 2b show the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of neat PBDB-T, the binary thin films of PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:NCBA, and the ternary thin films of PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9), which were performed to investigate the working mechanism of the ternary PSCs and the charge carrier dynamic process among PBDB-T, NCBA, and ITIC. The neat PBDB-T thin films exhibited a strong PL emission with an emission peak at approximately 680 nm. However, for the three kinds of thin films of PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1), PBDB-T:NCBA (1:1), and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9), the PL emission was markedly quenched. The PL intensities of the PBDB-T:NCBA (1:1), PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1), and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) thin films decreased by 91%, 94%, and 98% of the neat PBDB-T layer, respectively, suggesting an efficient exciton dissociation at the PBDB-T/blend acceptor material interface from PBDB-T to the blend acceptor molecules compared with the binary PBDB-T/neat acceptor material.27 Simultaneously, the low PL quenching ratio of PBDB-T:NCBA (1:1) thin films did not favor efficient exciton dissociation and hinders photocurrent generation. The TRPL spectra of the neat PBDB-T, binary thin films of PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:NCBA, and the ternary thin films of PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC were measured by monitoring the 690 nm emission, as shown in Fig. 3b. The fluorescence lifetimes of the neat PBDB-T, PBDB-T:ITIC, PBDB-T:NCBA, and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films were 2.65, 3.25, and 2.25 ns, respectively. The short exciton lifetime indicated efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport at the PBDB-T/acceptor interface, which were in good agreement with the high JSC values in the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC-based PSCs.28

The lower fluorescence lifetime of the PBDB-T:NCBA thin films was attributed to the lower efficiency of exciton dissociation at the PBDB-T/NCBA interface, which causes a significant amount of photogenerated charge carrier recombination.29,30 However, after the partial replacement of ITIC by NCBA, the fluorescence lifetime of the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC thin films decreased to 2.25 ns, which was significantly lower than that of the PBDB-T:NCBA thin films, implying the higher efficiency of exciton dissociation at the PBDB-T/NCBA, PBDB-T/ITIC, and NCBA/ITIC interfaces and the formation of free electron–hole pairs. The exciton dissociation from PBDB-T to NCBA and to ITIC can efficiently improve utilization of the exciton generated on the PBDB-T thin films, in addition to improving the photoinduced charge carrier separation between the donor (PBDB-T) and acceptor (NCBA and ITIC) molecules. The optimized result is that the maximum photogenerated exciton dissociates into the free charge carrier at the donor/acceptor interfaces and is transported to the individual electrode. The undissociated exciton on PBDB-T can also transfer to the acceptor, and can then be dissociated into free charge carriers at the NCBA/ITIC interface.4,31,32
The electron-only and hole-only SCLC curves are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) values are listed in Table 2. It is apparent that the μe value increased from 1.58 × 10−4 for 0 wt% NCBA to 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 10 wt% and significantly decreased to 1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 20 wt% NCBA. The μh value was slightly decreased, dependent on the NCBA concentration, and the values were 6.86 × 10−4, 6.75 × 10−4, and 6.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding to NCBA concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 wt%, respectively. The slight enhancement of μe could be ascribed to the enhanced molecular crystallinity and bi-continuous interpenetrating network that are well maintained in the optimized ternary blend thin films, guaranteeing exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.33 Excess NCBA (i.e., when the NCBA concentration is 20 wt%) damages the uniform intermixing of PBDB-T and ITIC (Fig. S2†) and the interface contact between the photoactive layer and modified electrode layer (Fig. S3†), which causes the lower charge carrier mobility.

To gain more insight into light absorption and the exciton dissociation process, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph), saturation current density (Jsat), maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), and charge collection efficiency (Jph/Jsat) at the open-circuit and maximum power point conditions. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of PSCs depending on the NCBA concentration. The Jph, Jsat, Gmax, and Jph/Jsat values under short-circuit and maximum power point conditions were calculated, and are listed in Table 3. Jph, Veff, and Jsat are defined in the formulas below:22,34Jph = JL − JD,Veff = V0 − Va,Jsat = qLGmax,where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities and dark current densities, respectively, V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent is zero, and Va is the applied voltage, q is the elementary charge, L is the distance between the anode and cathode, and Gmax is a measure of the maximum number of photons absorbed. At high Veff values (that is, Veff ≥ 2 V), the maximum dissociation of photogenerated excitons occurs, and they can be extracted by the individual electrodes and contribute to the photocurrent at a high electric field. The saturation current density (Jsat, is the point where the Jph values reach the saturation state) is only limited by the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), and so Gmax is only governed by the number of absorbed photons. The Jph and Gmax were determined by visible light absorption and harvesting in the photoactive layer.35 Along with the increased Veff value, Jph is nearly linear and reaches the saturation state while Veff is 2 V, which usually means a better charge extraction efficiency and leads to relatively higher FF and JSC values. For PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC-based PSCs with NCBA concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 wt%, the Jph values were 15.1, 15.8, and 14.0 mA cm−2, respectively. At Veff = 2 V, the corresponding Jsat values were 16.7, 17.3, and 17.2 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding Jph/Jsat values for PSCs under the short-circuit condition were 90.2%, 91.3%, and 81.3%, respectively, while they were 72.5%, 73.5%, and 67.4% under the maximum power point condition. The higher Jph/Jsat values for both 10 wt% NCBA-based PSCs and non-NCBA-based PSCs under short-circuit and maximum power point conditions implies a weaker geminate (monomolecular and bimolecular recombination) or bimolecular recombination and that efficient photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and that charge carriers are transported and collected at the individual electrodes. However, the lower Jph/Jsat value of 20 wt% NCBA-based PSCs is attributed to the lower charge carrier mobility and destroyed crystallinity and surface morphology of the PBDB-T:ITIC layer with the excess NCBA replacing ITIC. The Gmax values for different concentrations of NCBA were 1.07 × 1028 (0 wt% NCBA), 1.11 × 1028 (10 wt% NCBA), and 1.08 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (20 wt% NCBA), respectively. The PSC with 10 wt% NCBA in the acceptor led to the highest Gmax value, which meant that more photons could be harvested for the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) layers over the entire spectral range and for a higher photogenerated exciton generation rate.36,37 This result was further confirmed by the visible light absorption spectrum and EQE spectra of the corresponding PSCs.

Fig. S4a, c, and e† show the J–V characteristic curves of the binary PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs and ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs, respectively, for incident light intensities ranging from 3 to 100 mW cm−2. Fig. S4b, d, and f† show the normalized photocurrent densities of Fig. S4a, c, and e,† respectively. The current density (J) and photocurrent density (Jphoto) of the PSCs were defined as:38,39J (I, V) = Jphoto (I, V) + Jdark (V),Jphoto (I, V) = edG (I) PC (I, V),where Jdark is the dark current density, Jphoto is the photocurrent density, G (I) is the generation rate of free electron–hole pairs per unit volume, and PC (I,V) is the charge collection probability. At the reverse-bias applied voltage region (where V is lower than 0 V), the current density becomes insensitive to the applied voltage and independent of the applied voltage with the larger reverse-bias applied voltage region (where V is approximately −0.5 V). Thus, when the applied voltage is approximately −0.5 V, the maximum number of free electron–hole pairs can be swept out at the applied voltage and collected by the cathode and anode, and the reverse saturation current can be obtained as follows:40G (I) = Jphoto (V = −0.5 V).
The charge carrier collection efficiency or normalized current density can be calculated according to the formula41  
This confirms that all the free electron–hole pairs can be swept out and this can avoid charge carrier recombination within the photoactive layer and the photoactive layer/electrode interface, so that PC is close to 1 at the short-circuit condition.38,42
At the open-circuit condition [the applied voltage in the range from −0.5 V to maximum power point condition (i.e., the Vmax, where Vmax was approximately 0.7 V)], the PC (I,Vapplied) ≈ PC (V) and the charge carrier collection probability is independent of the incident light intensity. However, at the short-circuit condition (the applied voltages in the range from Vmax to the VOC), the charge carrier collection probability is dependent on the incident light intensity. At the short-circuit condition, the maximum number of photogenerated charge carriers (up to 90%) were generated under incident light illumination and were transported to the individual electrode in the external circuit prior to charge carrier recombination, which is not suitable for the study of charge carrier recombination. However, at the open-circuit condition, the maximum number of photogenerated charge carriers underwent recombination (nearly 100%) within the photoactive layer, which is suitable for the study of charge carrier recombination at the open-circuit condition (where applied voltages were in the range of −0.5 V to 0.7 V).38 Even at the maximum power point condition, the charge carrier recombination was independent of incident light intensity. The variation in PC with incident light intensity was most prominent at the open-circuit voltage; that is, at the externally applied bias at which J(I,V) is 0. However, at the short-circuit condition, the charge carrier collection probability was dependent on the incident light intensity. Generally, charge carrier kinetics would result in an increasing rate of charge carrier recombination with increasing incident light intensity and a corresponding change in PC. At a given voltage, the competition between charge carrier transport and charge carrier recombination determines the charge carrier density and charge carrier lifetime, which is ideal for the further study of charge carrier recombination within the photoactive layer. Therefore, the higher charge carrier density at the lower applied voltages decreased the charge carrier transport and caused geminate recombination.38
The J–V characteristics and normalized photocurrents as a function of incident light intensity of the binary PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs, ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs, and ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs indicated that the charge carrier collection probability was strongly dependent on the incident light intensity at a given applied voltage. A subtle spread in normalized photocurrent curves along with a decreasing incident light intensity was observed in the range of reverse-bias applied voltage, especially for the higher NCBA concentration PSCs, indicating that bimolecular recombination could occur at any applied voltage in the three PSCs studied, with the existence of a more significant bimolecular recombination phenomenon in PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs. However, both PBDB-T:ITIC-based binary PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based ternary PSCs exhibit a similar spread of ratios dependent on the incident light intensity, indicating the same charge carrier recombination intensity. Meanwhile, for the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs, the higher applied voltage under the same incident light intensity compared with the other two PSCs implies that the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs will “cost” a higher applied voltage at the same incident light intensity and the same normalized photocurrent density.
The dependence of VOC and JSC at various incident light intensities offers a deep insight into the influence of NCBA on the charge carrier recombination process in the binary system and ternary system studied in this paper. At the open-circuit condition, all the photogenerated charge carriers will be recombined in the photoactive layers. Fig. 6a shows the VOC values dependent on the incident light intensity (Plight) in PSCs, which helps determine the degree of charge carrier recombination in the devices. The charge carrier recombination mechanism is defined by the following equation:38,43,44  where k is Boltzmann's constant. A slope at unity 1(kT/q) implies that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism, while the slope significantly deviating by a unity of 1(kT/q) and geminate recombination is the dominant mechanism.45,46 In our case, the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based ternary PSCs showed a slope of 1.37(kT/q), while for PBDB-T:ITIC-based binary PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based ternary PSCs, slopes close to unity as 1.06(kT/q) and 1.09(kT/q) were obtained, implying that geminate recombination (monomolecular and bimolecular recombination) was dominant in the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based ternary PSCs and, further, that monomolecular recombination was almost negligible and that bimolecular recombination was dominant in the PSCs processed with PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) layers as the photoactive layer. The results also indicated that PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based ternary PSCs had reduced interfacial surface trap densities and suppressed trap-assisted recombination, which is perfectly consistent with the enhanced JSC and FF values obtained by adding a small amount of NCBA into the PBDB-T:ITIC blend layer.

Fig. 6b shows the JSC values as a function of the incident light intensity. At the short-circuit condition, the photogenerated charge carriers could be efficiently transported to the individual electrodes. This charge carrier recombination can be assessed by the following equation:47,48JSC ∝ Pαlight,where α is an exponential factor. An α value close to 1 implies weak bimolecular recombination in the photoactive layer. However, bimolecular recombination was dominant within the photoactive layer with α values lower than 1. The extracted α values were 0.958, 0.962, and 0.913 for the PBDB-T:ITIC-based binary PSCs and the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based ternary PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based ternary PSCs, respectively. For both PBDB-T:ITIC-based binary PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based ternary PSCs, the similar and close to 1 α values indicated that the bimolecular recombination process was weakened both in the system without NCBA and with a low loading of NCBA and that the effective photogenerated charge carrier was transported and collected by the individual electrodes for the PSCs. The fact that the α value deviated significantly from 1 in the PSCs processed with a PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8) layer as the photoactive layer suggested that the bimolecular recombination was dominant at the short-circuit condition.
The charge carrier lifetime (τ) and charge carrier density (n) were measured via the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) at the open-circuit condition over a range of different incident light intensities to further assess the recombination dynamics and corroborate the degree of suppressed charge recombination.49,50 Here, n and τ in PSCs at the open-circuit condition under a given steady-state light intensity can be calculated from the TPV and TPC curves, respectively, using a differential capacitance technique proposed by Shuttle et al.19,50 A pulsed laser was used as an illumination source (a nitrogen-laser-pumped dye laser as an excitation source with a wavelength of 620 nm, frequency of 2 Hz, and pulse duration of 1 ns). When the pulsed laser illuminated the PSCs, the photoactive layer generated a small perturbation. The charge carrier concentration induced by a small-amplitude laser pulse (Δn), Δn ≪ n, at different levels of steady-state bias light, was used to probe the density of states by measuring the change in voltage (ΔV).51 At the open-circuit condition, photogenerated charge carriers were recombined within the photoactive layer and the contact interlayer of the photoactive layer/electrode modified the layer. Here, n could be obtained by fitting the TPV transient to an exponential, which was defined as:50,52  where A is the device area, e the electronic charge, d the device thickness, and C the capacitance. The differential C is defined as the voltage change when a small number of photogenerated charge carriers is added to the device, which was extrapolated back to V = 0. Small perturbation charge carrier lifetimes are found to follow an exponential dependent on VOC of the form:53–55  where m and ϑ are the slopes of τ (Voc) and n (VOC), respectively, and δ is the reaction order. Further, τΔn0 is the charge carrier lifetime achieved by laser pulse illumination, which is constant, τΔn is the small perturbation charge carrier lifetime, n is the average excess charge carrier concentration, n0 is the concentration of photogenerated charge carriers due to the laser pulse, and λ is the recombination exponent.55

Fig. 7a and b show the open-circuit transient photovoltage (at 1 Sun illumination conditions) and the short-circuit transient photocurrent (at the same laser pulse). Fig. 7c shows τ versus n for the binary PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs and ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs under 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 Sun illumination conditions. We found that the τ-versus-n plots behaved completely differently in the three PSCs studied. The addition of 10 wt% NCBA caused only minor changes in the τ and n values of PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs compared with binary PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs, while the τ values of PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based PSCs were reduced by 50–60% compared to those of binary PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs and ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs (n1:1 is 6.4 × 1015, n1:0.1:0.9 is 8.1 × 1015, and n1:0.2:0.8 is 3.5 × 1015). The τ under 1 Sun illumination conditions continuously decreased upon the addition of NCBA (τ1:1 is 0.85 ms, τ1:0.1:0.9 is 0.61 ms, and τ1:0.2:0.8 is 0.45 ms). Furthermore, the recombination exponent λ also significantly increased with increasing the NCBA concentration, which led to a strong recombination of PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based ternary PSCs and a significant decrease of JSC and FF. This observation is perfectly consistent with the JSC and VOC as a function of incident light intensity trends of the PSCs. For the higher NCBA concentration acceptor system, the charge carrier decay dynamics exhibited the highest order dependent on the charge carrier density (λ = 3.05) compared to the other NCBA concentrations (λ = 2.05 and 2.27, corresponding to NCBA concentrations of 0 and 10 wt%, respectively). These results indicate that the charge carrier recombination mechanism is not ideal only bimolecular recombination, and that geminate recombination is dominant in PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8)-based ternary PSCs, which is attributed to the effect of trapping and release in energetic traps and to trapping by morphological traps.49,56 Simultaneously, the higher energy level disorder in a photoactive layer with charge carrier recombination between free and trapped charge carriers can decrease JSC and FF.57,58 A lower NCBA concentration did not cause a significant change of the crystallinity of the PBDB-T:ITIC layer, while a higher NCBA concentration destroyed the crystallinity of the PBDB-T:ITIC layer and caused a significant change in the charge carrier recombination dynamics and transport properties of the PSCs.59

The normalized statistics photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) of the ternary PSCs in glove-box investigated for the PSCs with thermal annealing treatment as a function of the thermal annealing time, with all the parameter shown at the Fig. 8. While the PSCs were noon sunlight illuminated for several hours, the internal temperature of the encapsulation PSCs was around 80 °C during less than 4 h. Thus, the thermal stability of PSCs under 90 °C thermal annealing treatment dependent on the thermal annealing time were measured. The average photovoltaic parameters were obtained from five PSCs. After 10 h and 90 °C of thermal annealing treatment, different decreased ratios of three PSCs were achieved. The normalized PCE values of PBDB-T:ITIC-based binary PSCs exhibited significantly reduced values after 10 h thermal annealing treatment, and the PCE values were 81.4% of the initial PCE value, while the PCE values of the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8) ternary PSCs were 92.5% and 93.1% of the initial PCE value, respectively.

Fig. S5† shows the XRD curve of the three kinds of thin films (binary PBDB-T:ITIC, ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8) thin films) under 10 h and 90 °C thermal annealing treatment. The diffraction peaks angle was the neglectful change, while the diffraction peak intensities showed significant different changes. After 10 h and 90 °C of thermal annealing treatment, both the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8) thin films showed a slight decrease in the diffraction peak intensities, while a significant decrease of binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin films was seen, which could be attributed to the disrupted molecular arrangement and weakened crystallinities of binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin films.60,61 Simultaneously, the smooth XRD curve without thermal annealing treatment was significant damaged and lots of confused peaks were introduced, which was attribute to the long time thermal annealing treatment and slight change in the molecular arrangement. From Fig. S6,† after 10 h and 90 °C thermal annealing treatment, the RMS roughness of binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin film was strongly enhanced at about 250 nm, while slight enhancements at about 9.2 and 8.4 nm corresponded to the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8) thin films. The very rough surface of binary PBDB-T:NCBA thin film was not favorable for good interface contact between binary PBDB-T:ITIC thin film and the modified electrode layer, which leads to a poor charge carrier transport and collection ability.
The ternary PSCs exhibited good stability. For the ternary PSCs with long time thermal annealing treatment, the relatively rapid decay process should be mainly due to the disrupted molecular arrangement and weakened crystallinities at the photoactive layer.60,61 However, similar decay processes were observed from the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) and PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.2:0.8) ternary PSCs, which should be due to the higher crystallinity of the ternary photoactive layer.62 It could be concluded that the NCBA replaces the PC71BM molecule to act not only as a stabilizing cross-linker but it also enhances the crystallinity in the ternary PBDTTT-C-T:NCBA:PC71BM thin film, resulting in an improved photovoltaic performance and thermal stability.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the blend acceptor materials NCBA and ITIC exhibited several advantages over the widely used fullerene acceptor PCBM and non-fullerene acceptor ITIC. First, the energy level of the blend acceptor materials NCBA:ITIC could be tuned by change the ratio of NCBA and ITIC, to simultaneously achieve a strong charge carrier transfer driving force and small charge carrier transfer energy loss. The more efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transfer of PBDB-T/NCBA, NCBA/ITIC, and PBDB-T/ITIC interfaces could enhance the photovoltaic performance. The VOC values of PSCs could also be increased due to the shallower LUMO energy level of NCBA:ITIC blend acceptor materials. Second, the crystallinity and surface morphology of the PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) layer could be tuned, which is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transportation and collection at individual electrodes. Third, PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9)-based PSCs were shown to have higher visible light absorbance and exciton generation rate, and to weaken monomolecular and bimolecular recombination at open-circuit and short-circuit conditions, respectively. Finally, the ternary PBDB-T:NCBA:ITIC (1:0.1:0.9) PSCs was shown to have better thermal stability. These results demonstrate that NCBA played the role of an electron-acceptor material in the binary blend photoactive layers of PBDB-T polymer donors and ITIC non-fullerene acceptors well, which is a promising characteristic for the future development of high-performance PSCs.
