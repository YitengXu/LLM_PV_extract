    , Accepted 18th May 2018First published on 30th May 2018AbstractA protocol that combines gas chromatography and a high-sensitivity micro Clark-type electrode is described to quantify hydrogen production across gas and solution phases for systems operating at very low currents such as dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathodes. Data indicate that a significant fraction of H2 remains in aqueous solution even after several hours of experiments. Using this protocol, re-evaluation of a dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathode based on a dye-catalyst dyad showed a reproducible 66% increase of the faradaic efficiency compared with previously reported headspace GC measurements [Kaeffer et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2016, 138, 12308–12311]. This dyad was based on an organic push–pull dye where donor and acceptor are separated by one thiophene group. Insertion of a second thiophene group between the donor and acceptor led to a more efficient system with 30% improved faradaic efficiency for H2 evolution.
Introduction
Driving the development of new concepts often involves low performances in the first instance. In the field of catalysis, this is accompanied by challenges associated with quantifying small amounts of products, which is further complicated by low catalyst loadings and leakage when gases are involved. The development of molecular photocathodes for H2 production1 in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (PECs)2,3 is one such area. Dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathodes are built by grafting a molecular dye and a molecular catalyst onto a mesoporous transparent semi-conducting metal oxide electrode, typically nickel oxide (NiO). It is a young field, with the first example published in 2012.4 Performances in terms of photocurrent, turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) are low. Systems typically contain nanomolar loadings of dye and catalyst per square centimetre of geometric surface and increasing such loadings is not straightforward due to limitations in the thickness of the semiconductor support that can be used (typically 1 μm for NiO). Taking for example a recent report of a relatively high performance molecular photocathode, a photocurrent of 30 μA was observed and 82 mC of charge was passed during a 90 min chronoampometric measurement.5 Even if the system could operate at 100% faradaic efficiency, only 9 μL (0.4 μmol) of H2 would be produced. This amount is miniscule when compared with a typical bulk electrolysis experiment with a homogeneous cobaloxime catalyst that passed approx. 220 C over 90 min, equal to 26 mL (1.14 mmol) of H2,6 and significantly lower than electrolysis experiments involving molecular engineered electrodes that passed approximately 375 mC over 90 min corresponding to 45 μL (2 μmoles) of H2 in the case of a molecular Ni catalyst absorbed on TiO2.7 In a (photo)electrochemical cell there are several routes by which hydrogen may be lost before it can be analysed: leakage out of the cell, crossover and oxidation at the anode, or if measuring the gas phase (headspace) only, H2 can be trapped in solution and vice versa. In a typical electrolysis experiment, these losses may be considered negligible but when the maximum possible turnover is a few hundred nanomoles, they can significantly affect the measurement. Unwanted entry of air into the cell or crossover of oxygen from the anodic to the cathodic compartment can also affect the faradaic efficiency for H2 evolution, as most cathode materials will preferentially reduce O2 over H2.8,9 These issues contribute significantly toward the reproducibility of photocathode measurements. A true evaluation of these systems is therefore critical to understand factors affecting performance and to design new, more efficient photocathodes.
In the course of our program dedicated to the design of such molecular photocathodes,10–13 we sought to quantify how much of the H2 produced is actually observed. We designed an experiment using a Pt cathode in aqueous sulphuric acid electrolyte for which a faradaic yield of 100% can be assumed and ran electrolysis experiments at current densities in the range of those measured for PEC cells. During these experiments, H2 was quantified by combining gas chromatography (GC) for the gas phase and a micro Clark-type electrode (Unisense H2 probe) for the solution phase that we already employed in the past to quantify low amounts of hydrogen production.14–17 This combination allowed us to warrant that we can measure all the H2 produced in our PEC device within a 6% error margin. We then applied this protocol to evaluate the faradaic yield for H2 evolution in the case of two photocathodes based on noble metal-free molecular dye-catalyst covalent assemblies.
Results
Cell design, calibration curves and operation of the H2 probe
We used a modified, thermostatted version (Fig. 1) of the three-electrode cell with a transparent window that we previously designed and used in the context of photoelectrochemical measurements.11,18,19 In this cell, the titanium counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode are separated from the central compartment by glass and Vycor® frits, respectively. The GC and H2 probe were calibrated with known concentrations of H2. For the GC, a common method of mixing quantities of pure hydrogen with pure nitrogen using a gas-tight syringe was employed (Fig. S1†). The amount of H2 dissolved in the electrolyte solution was measured using a Unisense H2 microsensor modified with a steel needle to protect the fragile glass probe tip. We found this type of probe to be sensitive to (i) temperature, (ii) movement and (iii) an applied potential across the solution, all of which had overwhelming effects on the genuine H2 signal. The temperature change remained problematic even when the lamp used for irradiation was fitted with a water-filled thermostatted infrared filter. This issue could only be solved by designing and constructing a new electrochemical cell with a thermostatted water jacket (25 °C) in front of the irradiation window. Large movements could be solved by tightly clamping the system. Smaller vibrations could be compensated for by using the built-in earth wire on the Unisense multimeter. This only works well when the wire is directly connected with the electrolyte solution and clipping it to the top of the protective steel needle on the probe tip was a convenient way to achieve this. Note, connecting the earth wire with the solution significantly affected current measurements by the potentiostat. We found no way to compensate the effect of the applied potential on the H2 probe. Connecting the earth wire worked but disturbed the potentiostat. Thus, to take a measurement, the potentiostat was paused and the probe was inserted into the solution, allowed to stabilise, and then removed before using the potentiostat again.
 Fig. 1  Top: Front, side and top view of the thermostatted cell used in this study equipped with Ti counter electrode, H2 probe and reference electrode; the working electrode (Pt wire or dye-sensitized photocathode) is not present and should be introduced into the middle compartment with the transparent window. Bottom: Faradaic efficiency of H2 production at a Pt cathode held at −10 μA in 0.1 M H2SO4. 
The Unisense manual describes two methods for calibration of the H2 probe. The first is vigorous bubbling of a flow of gas with known H2 partial pressure through the solution. We found this did not work well, probably because vigorous bubbling could lead to supersaturation phenomena. The second method is to make a saturated solution of H2 by bubbling and then to take a volume of this and dilute it into a larger volume, which is then measured by the H2 probe. We found this to give the most accurate results provided it is performed in the same electrolyte used for electrode evaluation. A two-point calibration (Fig. S1†) was sufficient, as detailed in the Unisense manual.
Low-current electrolysis with a Pt cathode
A common method used to calibrate instruments for H2 detection is to run electrolysis with a Pt cathode under conditions where a 100% faradaic efficiency for H2 evolution can be assumed. Usually, the concentration range of H2 produced in such calibration experiments is so high that losses of H2 due to leakage or oxidation at the anode during the calibration can be neglected. This may not be the case anymore if the current is set to a very low value in order to match that produced by an operating dye-sensitized photocathode, which we decided to check carefully. We then introduced a Pt wire in the central compartment and used it as a cathode during an electrolysis experiment in 0.1 M H2SO4. Importantly, the current was held at −10 μA in order to match the range of current typically measured for dye-sensitized photocathodes with 1 cm2 geometric surface. The cell was tightly sealed with three septa and purged with N2 for at least 20 minutes prior to electrolysis. Each run was 3 h and three runs were made with measurements taken every 30 min. The average of the three results is reported. The quantities of H2 measured in the solution and in the headspace (Table S1†) are plotted as faradaic efficiencies versus the charge in Fig. 1. The combined faradaic efficiency was found to be quantitative at all measurement points, with error bars showing ±one standard deviation. It is clear that, at low charges, the majority of H2 is dissolved in solution. Over the course of the experiment, the relative fraction of H2 in the headspace increases and the fraction of H2 in solution decreases, consistent with equilibration of H2 between the two phases. The first two data points have larger standard deviations due to the very small amounts of H2 produced at this stage (see Table S1†). The penultimate point has a very small error suggesting the measurement of 94% faradaic efficiency is very close to the true value. This is reasonable considering the possibility of losing 6% of the faradaic efficiency through leaks of H2 out or crossover to the anodic compartment. Until this point the errors are decreasing, consistent with increased quantities of H2 reducing the signal to noise and the impact of small leaks. The final point obtained after ∼3 h of electrolysis shows a slight increase in the faradaic efficiency in both phases, but the error in the measurement also increases, likely because of increased leakage due to the accumulation of piercings in the septum from both GC sampling and inserting and removing the H2 probe.
This measurement shows that the calibration and measurement methods used here for the GC and the H2 probe are accurate and that the PEC device used is tight and prevents crossover between anodic and cathodic compartments to a large extent. It also clearly demonstrates that at the photocurrents produced by current molecular photocathodes, significant quantities of H2 remain in solution even after 3 h of electrolysis. However, we would like to highlight that the data presented in Fig. 1 cannot be used to correct the faradaic efficiencies for any experiment where only one phase has been measured because the equilibration between gas and solution phases will not be the same due to differences such as the nature of the electrolyte/solvent, volumes of the two phases, equilibration time before the measurement and amounts of H2 produced depending on the actual faradaic yield of the process. If these parameters change, the ratio between the amounts of H2 dissolved in solution and present in the headspace will not be the same for a given charge passed and calibration by Pt-mediated electrolysis will not be suitable.
Evaluation of dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathodes
We utilised the above described protocol to re-evaluate our previously reported photocathode based on a mesoporous NiO film sensitized with a covalent dye-catalyst assembly (DyeCat1; Fig. 2, n = 1).11 The dyad is composed of a triarylamine electron donor and an ethyl cyanoacetate electron acceptor separated by a single thiophene unit. The acceptor unit is covalently linked to a cobalt diimine-dioxime catalyst for H2 production.8,20,21
 Fig. 2  The general structure of (A) the tBuDyeCat molecular dyad precursors and (B) of the dye-sensitized NiO photoelectrode based on DyeCat (DyeCat1, n = 1; DyeCat2, n = 2) for H2 production from water. 
A second dyad was prepared with two thiophene groups between the donor and acceptor units (DyeCat2; n = 2, Fig. 2). The additional thiophene unit was inserted to improve the absorption of longer wavelength light and to increase the lifetime of charge separation.22 Accordingly, UV-visible spectroscopy showed λmax at 450 nm for tBuDyeCat2 in CH3CN (Fig. S2†), 19 nm higher than for tBuDyeCat111 in agreement with the lower E0–0 transition energy for the former (Table S2†). The molar extinction coefficient is also improved from 31800 M−1 cm−1 to 38600 M−1 cm−1, making it possible to capture a larger fraction of the solar spectrum. Photolysis of a CH3CN solution of tBuDyeCat2 in the presence of triethanolamine as electron donor was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. As previously observed for tBuDyeCat1,11 the CoI species builds up within minutes as evidenced by the appearance of the characteristic two-band spectrum with maxima at 598 and 708 nm (Fig. S3†). Indeed, addition of a second thiophene unit only slightly affects the energy levels of the HOMO–LUMO orbitals, which were evaluated from the fluorescence spectra and cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S4 and S5†). As a consequence, the driving force to generate the Co(I) species, which is the entry point to the H2-evolving catalytic cycle, by electron transfer from the reduced dye (formed at the surface of the electrode after photon absorption and subsequent hole injection into NiO) to the Co(II) catalyst is −0.60 eV for DyeCat2versus −0.65 eV for DyeCat1 (Table S2†).23
To prepare dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathodes, F108-templated 0.5 μm-thick NiO electrodes were prepared and sensitized through soaking in 0.5 mM CH3CN solutions of DyeCat1 or DyeCat2 for 24 hours. From the UV-visible absorption spectra of the sensitized films (Fig. S6†), the surface concentration of DyeCat2 was estimated to be 9.0 ± 0.1 nmol cm−2, a value similar to that (9.7 ± 0.1 nmol cm−2) measured for DyeCat1-sensitized photocathodes. The resulting molecular DyeCat2 photocathodes were assessed for photo-electrochemical H2 evolution in a fully aqueous pH 5.5 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) 0.1 M buffer with 0.1 M NaCl added under visible light irradiation (800 > λ > 400 nm; 65 mW cm−2) and their performances were compared with those of photocathodes based on DyeCat1. Linear sweep voltammograms measured in the dark and under illumination show that the electrodes develop cathodic photocurrents starting from ca. 0.93 V vs. RHE (Fig. S7†), which are sustained over the scanned potential range. Two broad processes are observed in the dark around 0.83 V and 0.61 V vs. RHE and are assigned to capacitive charging of the NiO film. Next, chronoamperometric measurements were run at three different potentials (0.54, 0.34 and 0.14 V vs. RHE), clearly showing steady-state cathodic photocurrents (Fig. S8 and S9†). The magnitude of the photocurrent proved superior at the most cathodic potential (0.14 V vs. RHE) with similar current densities of ca. −11 and −10 μA cm−2 for DyeCat2 and DyeCat1 respectively. The photocurrents recorded at an applied potential of 0.14 V vs. RHE for Dyecat1 and DyeCat2 are shown in Fig. 3. It is apparent that there is less oxidative transient current when the lamp is turned off in the case of DyeCat2. These transients correspond to the oxidation at the electrode of reducing equivalents that accumulate at the electrode/electrolyte interface under irradiation. The suppression of such transient thus suggests that the photogenerated reducing equivalents are more efficiently exploited to generate H2 at the catalytic centres.
 Fig. 3  Steady-state photocurrents recorded in a pH 5.5 MES 0.1 M/NaCl 0.1 M supporting electrolyte, at an applied potential of 0.14 V vs. RHE, at DyeCat1-sensitized (red line) and DyeCat2-sensitized (blue line) NiO electrodes. 
We finally determined the faradaic efficiency for H2 production during 2 h photoelectrolysis experiments at 0.14 V vs. RHE. In the absence of any co-adsorbent, photocathodes based on DyeCat1 were reported to produce H2 with 6% faradaic efficiency. However, in our previous study, we only measured H2 in the headspace by GC. We performed this measurement again in the thermostatted cell with combined GC and H2 probe measurements and observed 10 ± 1% FE (Table S3†). This corresponds to an increase of 66% compared with the previous report, which neglected the solution phase. The new measurement has a small error indicating good reproducibility in overall faradaic yield, but a large variability regarding the partition of H2 between the liquid and gaseous phases. The amount of H2 dissolved in the liquid electrolyte can contribute up to 70% of the faradaic yield in an isolated experiment. Following this, photocathodes based on DyeCat2 were shown to produce H2 with a 13 ± 2% FE photoelectrolysis. This 30% improvement in faradaic efficiency over DyeCat1 may be linked with the absence of transient oxidative currents during chopped-light measurements and is a first demonstration that the efficiency of these molecular devices can be finely tuned by structural changes. We note that in the case of Pt, a loss of approximately 6% faradaic efficiency is observed due to crossover of the H2 to the counter electrode or leaks out of the cell. Therefore, the efficiencies of the dyads are a lower limit.
Conclusions
We report here on the first protocol that combines gas chromatography and a high-sensitivity micro Clark electrode to quantify hydrogen production across gas and solution phases. At very low currents pertinent to the evaluation of dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathodes5,11,24–28 and even for a system that operates with 100% efficiency, 60% of the H2 remains in solution after 3 h. As a general conclusion, the efficiency of most systems is likely underestimated and our study points to specific issues related to the calibration of the analytical tools and false signals. We therefore recommend to (i) test calibrations with systems of known efficiency, (ii) calibrate and test at H2 concentrations relevant to the system under study (here dye-sensitized H2-evolving photocathodes), (iii) where possible measure both gas phase and solution phase or allow time after the experiment for H2 to equilibrate to observe the maximum possible yield by GC in the gas phase if a H2 probe is not available. The protocol also takes into account the application of electrical potential and light to the reaction medium, making it important for a broad range of research spanning all photo-, electro- and photoelectro-driven systems for hydrogen production. It is of particular relevance to the rapidly expanding field of solar energy conversion. The low detection levels mean this technique is the only way to measure cutting-edge systems in the early, proof-of-principle stages when hydrogen production rates can be low. These include hybrid photoelectrode materials based on metal organic frameworks,29 quantum dots30–32 or photosystems33,34 as the light harvesting unit, and enzymes33,34 which can offer very large turnover frequencies but with large footprints, limiting the number of active sites and the volume of H2 produced.
Experimental
General methods and chemicals used
Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
All reagents were obtained from commercially available sources and used without further purification. Solvents were dried from appropriate drying agents (calcium hydride for CH2Cl2 and CH3CN, 4 Å molecular sieves for DMF) and freshly distilled under argon before use. Di-tert-butyl 4,4′-((4-bromophenyl)azanediyl)dibenzoate (I in scheme S1†)35 and propargyl cyanoacetamide (II in scheme S1†) were synthesized as previously described. (DOH)2N3pn was custom-synthetized by Provence Technologies according to our previously reported procedure.36 The preparation of Co(DO)(DOH)N3pnBr2 (CoDODOH-N3) was adapted from a reported procedure, using (DOH)2pnN3 instead of (DOH)2pn.37
General characterization methods and equipment

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K in 5 mm o.d. tubes either on a Bruker AC 300 spectrometer equipped with a QNP probehead operating at 300.0 MHz for 1H and 75.5 MHz for 13C or on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with a Prodigy cryoprobe and operating at 500.0 MHz for 1H and 126 MHz for 13C. Chemical shift values are given in ppm with reference to solvent residual signals. Accurate mass measurements (HRMS) were performed on a Bruker maXis mass spectrometer by the “Fédération de Recherche” ICOA/CBM (FR2708) platform and elemental analysis on a Thermofisher Scientific “Flash 2000” by the “Plateforme d'analyse pour la chimie” (GDS 3648, Strasbourg). Emission fluorescence and UV-vis absorption spectra of compounds were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter and on an Agilent Technologies Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrometer, respectively, in a 1 cm optical light path quartz cuvette. The fluorescence spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 430 nm.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical data were acquired with a Biologic VSP 300 potentiostat. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a 3-electrode cell. The reference electrode was made of a Ag/AgCl wire dipped into a 3 M KCl solution saturated with AgCl, separated from the supporting electrolyte by a Vycor® frit, and denoted as Ag/AgCl. The counter electrode was a Ti wire. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated at the beginning and end of each day with K4FeCN6. Irradiation was carried out with a 300 W ozone-free Xe lamp (Newport) operated at 280 W and mounted with a water-filled Spectra-Physics 6123NS liquid filter for elimination of IR (λ > 800 nm) irradiation. The power density was 65 mW cm−2 calibrated using a Newport PM1918-R power-meter. The counter electrode compartment was separated from the cathodic one by a frit. The supporting electrolyte was either 0.1 M H2SO4 or a 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES)/0.1 M NaCl buffer at pH 5.5. The solution was degassed with N2 for 20 minutes prior to use. In a typical experiment, the volume of supporting electrolyte was 4.0 mL and the headspace was 1.3 mL. The amounts of evolved hydrogen in the gas phase were determined by sampling aliquots of the headspace in a PerkinElmer Clarus 580 gas chromatograph equipped with a molecular sieve 5 Å column (30 m–0.53 mm) and a TCD detector. The amounts of hydrogen in the solution phase were measured with a Unisense H2 microsensor in a needle.

The NiO films were prepared according to a previous procedure.11

Synthesis of 4. 

3 (200 mg, 0.27 mmol) and III (1 equiv., 119 mg, 0.27 mmol) were solubilized in CH2Cl2 (8.6 mL) under Ar. A solution of CuSO4·5H2O (0.3 equiv., 26 mg, 0.08 mmol) and sodium ascorbate (0.9 equiv., 48 mg, 0.24 mmol) in Ar-purged water (4.3 mL) was added. Then, Ar-degassed CH3OH (16.6 mL) was added to the biphasic mixture until a single phase was obtained. The reaction mixture was stirred at R.T. under Ar. After 24 h the solution was concentrated under vacuum yielding a precipitate, which was filtered and washed with water. The solid was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using as eluent a mixture CH3CN/aqueous KNO3 solution at 10% of the saturating concentration. The pure product was obtained after evaporation of CH3CN in the combined fractions and precipitation by addition of a KPF6-saturated aqueous solution. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried under vacuum to give 4 as red brick solid (162 mg, 55% yield), which was directly used for the next step.


Synthesis of tBuDyeCat2. 

4 (155 mg, 0.13 mmol) and CoCl2·6H2O (6.8 equiv., 211 mg, 0.89 mmol) were solubilized in acetone (22 mL) and stirred under air bubbling. After 12 h the solution was evaporated under vacuum and the solid was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using as eluent a mixture of CH3CN and aqueous KNO3 solution at 10% of the saturating concentration, then a solution of acetone saturated in NaI to completely desorb the product from the silica gel. The desired fractions were combined and the organic solvents were evaporated under vacuum, yielding a precipitate that was filtered and washed with water. The solid was re-solubilized in acetone. To this solution is added a NaBr-saturated aqueous solution (a third of the final volume). The mixture was stirred at R.T. for three days to allow the acetone to slowly evaporate, giving a precipitate. This precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried under vacuum to obtain the expected product 5 as a pure solid (100 mg, 56% yield). 1H NMR (CD3CN, 500 MHz): δ (ppm) 19.23 (s, 1H), 8.27 (s, 1H), 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.78 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H), 7.62 (s, 1H), 7.53 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.34 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 1H), 7.26 (m, 3H), 7.05 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.02 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H), 5.70 (t, J = 11.2 Hz, 1H), 4.60–4.40 (m, 6H), 2.52 (s, 6H), 2.47 (s, 6H), 1.48 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (CD3CN/CD2Cl2 2:1, 126 MHz): δ (ppm) 176.82, 165.14, 161.08, 156.90, 150.52, 146.48, 145.61, 145.34, 144.77, 144.01, 139.47, 134.73, 130.83, 129.72, 127.71, 127.06, 126.75, 126.10, 124.66, 124.56, 123.07, 123.02, 99.88, 80.69, 57.95, 54.99, 35.74, 27.75, 18.02, 13.50.

Synthesis of DyeCat2. 



tBuDyeCat2 (50 mg, 40 μmol) was solubilized in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) and TFA (32 equiv., 0.1 mL, 1.3 mmol) was slowly added to this solution. The mixture was stirred at R.T. for 4 hours and then evaporated to dryness. The solid was dissolved in CH2Cl2, filtered, washed successively with CH2Cl2 and CH3CN and dried under vacuum to obtain 4 as a pure product (41 mg, 90% yield). 1H NMR (acetone-d6/DMSO-d6 3:1, 500 MHz): δ (ppm) 12.60 (s, 2H), 8.78 (s, 1H), 8.46 (s, 1H), 8.40 (s, 1H), 7.95 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 3H), 7.89 (d, J = 3.7 Hz, 1H), 7.78 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.61 (d, J = 3.7 Hz, 1H), 7.58 (d, J = 3.8 Hz, 1H), 7.56 (d, J = 3.9 Hz, 1H), 7.23 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 4H), 5.81 (t, J = 11.8 Hz, 1H), 4.87–4.48 (m, 6H), 2.74 (s, 6H), 2.57 (s, 6H). 13C NMR (acetone-d6/DMSO-d6 3:1, 126 MHz): δ (ppm) 177.33, 167.46, 161.62, 157.00, 156.93, 151.01, 146.85, 145.41, 145.32, 143.92, 140.29, 135.23, 135.08, 131.72, 130.27, 128.44, 127.67, 126.78, 126.30, 125.64, 125.28, 123.65, 123.53, 117.31, 58.45, 55.64, 55.24, 36.12, 18.18, 13.76.

Photolysis experiment
Spectro-photochemical measurements were performed in an H2O/O2-free glovebox. In a quartz cuvette (1 mm optical light path) a solution of tBuDyeCat2 (2 × 10−5 M) in dry, degassed CH3CN/TEOA (90:10 v/v) mixture was irradiated for 1 h at 100 mW cm−2 (output power measured after UV and IR filters; losses through the quartz window of the glove-box and related possible de-focusing of the beam not taken into account). UV-visible spectra were recorded at time intervals with an optical fiber external-sampler connected to the UV-Vis spectrometer.
