    , Accepted 23rd April 2019First published on 23rd April 2019AbstractA class of N-annulated perylene (NP)-based organic dyes used in dye-sensitized solar cells has been investigated by means of quantum chemical calculations. The NPs are rigidified with thiophene or benzene rings in both a one-sided and two-sided manner on a 5- or 6-member ring and are considered as electron donors in dyes. To gain a better understanding of the effect of such modulation of NP moieties on the dye performance, the geometrical and electronic structures, the optical absorption and intramolecular charge transfer properties of the dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes are analyzed in detail to establish the structure–property relationship. The calculated results indicate that the rigidified NP moieties could improve light-harvesting capacities, modulate the energy levels of frontier orbitals, accelerate intramolecular charge transfer by decreasing the aromaticity of the π-system, decreasing the reorganization energy and avoiding electon trapping in the possible multiple electron transfer pathways, and facilitate charge separation with a lower coulombic attractive energy. In particular, the bilateral dyes via a 6-member immobilization would be promising candidates with excellent performance. We hope that our calculations could give a more in-depth physical insight on the structure–property relationship and provide guidance for the exploration of high-performance NP-based dyes.
1 Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable research interest as an eco-friendly and low-cost technology for solar energy conversion since their first successful demonstration by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.1 As one of the crucial components in DSSCs, the sensitizer plays a dominiant role in the cell performance. A sensitizer is not only in charge of light-harvesting, charge generation and separation, and charge recombination, but also affects the microstructure of a self-assembled monolayer at the dye/TiO2 interface. Thus, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient sensitizers. To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 12% with ruthenium polypyridine complexes, zinc porphyrin complexes, and metal-free organic dyes have been achieved.2–6 In particular, organic dyes have drawn increasing attention due to their high molar extinction coefficient, easily tunable optical properties and good flexibility in molecular tailoring.7–9
Generally, most organic sensitizers have a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration.10,11 The optimal combinations of molecular donor moiety, π-linker and acceptor moiety are of paramount importance to construct promising candidates that possess excellent properties of light-harvesting ability, enhanced interfacial charge injection and inhibited charge recombination to further boost the PCEs of DSSCs. N-annulated perylene (NP), in which a nitrogen atom is annulated at the bay position,12 has a rigid planar electronic skeleton and an intrinsic electron-rich nature, and it has been widely exploited recently as a superior electron donor for metal-free organic sensitizers in photovoltaic applications due to its excellent optical and physical properties, such as a high molar extinction coefficient, a high fluorescence quantum yield and excellent photostability.13–16 Moreover, the chemical modification of NP can be readily realized at peri-positions to connect with other functional groups and at the amine site to graft with flexible alkyl chains, which can significantly improve its solubility and suppress dye aggregation. Luo et al. reported NP as an efficient electron donor for zinc-porphyrin based sensitizers to enhance light-harvesting ability, thus leading to a PCE of over 10%.17 More recently, a series of rigidified NP-based organic dyes, in which NP is rigidified with an adjacent π-conjugated thiophene or benzene unit, was reported by Wang's group with all PCEs exceeding 10.0% under irradiance of simulated AM 1.5G sunlight.18–21 Such rigidification and expansion of NPs somehow exert significant influence on the cell performance of the sensitizer. The distinctive features of NPs and the effects of rigidification and expansion of NPs on the cell performance should be recognized and revealed at a microscopic level.
In order to further explore the relationship between the structure and properties of organic sensitizers, a series of NP-based model dyes, which are similar to the sensitizers in Wang's work, are theoretically designed and investigated (depicted in Fig. 1). The dyes are end-capped with benzothiadiazole–benzoic acid (BTBA) as an acceptor, in which the inserted benzene has been verified to suppress electron recombination effectively at the dye–TiO2 interface.22,23 The rigidified NPs, in which NPs are immobilized with thiophene (A series) or benzene (B series) rings in both a one-sided and two-sided manner on a 5- or 6-member ring, are considered as electron donors. For comparison purposes, the sensitizers with unfixed thienyl or phenyl groups are taken into account. In experiments, the sensitizer similar to A1 shows a PCE of 9.4%, while sensitizers similar to A2 and A3 with rigidified aromatic units show significantly improved PCEs of 11.5% and 12.0%, respectively.18 The PCE of the sensitizer with bilateral immobilized thienyl units (as A2s) reaches up to 13%.20 A detailed understanding of the structure–performance relationship should be established for these materials. The effect of the type of rigidified rings (thiophene or benzene), the way of tightening adjacent rings in a molecular skeleton (via a 5- or 6-member ring, and one-sided or two-sided manner) and their combinations (the rigidification of the thiophene ring via a 5- or 6-member ring, or immobilization of the benzene ring via a 5- or 6-member ring) on the PCE should be elucidated in-depth.

There is no doubt that the NP and BTBA moieties play important roles in the striking PCEs of these organic dyes. The dyes derived from the coplanar NP skeleton possess extended π-electron delocalization and thus a large molar absorption coefficient. The strong electron-donating nature of NP could render these dyes with low-energy-gap properties for better utilization of sunlight. The rigidified NP moiety is expected to possess a small reorganization energy upon charge transfer, which might improve the photochemical stability of the dyes. Hence, in this work, we intend to undertake a computational investigation on how the modified NP moieties affect the geometrical and electronic structures of the dyes and their cell performance by means of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. Based on the quantum chemical calculations, we aim to establish the structure–property relationships for the NP-based dyes, shed light on fundamental research, and provide guidance to design and screen novel high performance dyes.
2 Computational details
The flexible alkyl chains have little influence on the electronic properties of the rigid conjugated organic dyes, so for the sake of saving computational cost, the long alkyl chains were replaced simply by isopropyl groups in the calculations.24
For the D–π–A dyes characterized by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) excitation, DFT and TDDFT methods with standard exchange–correlation functionals severely fail in predicting both the ground-state properties25,26 and electronic absorption spectra.27,28 Hence, the functionals with a fixed percentage of nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange (HFexc) could provide a better description of the ground- and excited-state properties.29,30 To determine the optimal amount of nonlocal HFexc in the DFT functional, an evaluation of different hybrid DFT functional results aganist experimental observables is mandatory. To better describe the ground state properties, the hybrid functionals of B3LYP (20% HFexc),31 PBE0 (25% HFexc),32–35 and PBE38 (37.5% HFexc)36 with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set were chosen to optimize dyes 1, 2, and 3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution using a polarizable continuum model (PCM).37,38 The PBE0-calculated energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) for the NP-based dyes are in good agreement with the experimental data (see Table S1, ESI†). Thus, the PBE0 functional was selected for the ground state geometry optimizations and related ground state property calculations. Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to confirm that the optimized geometry corresponds to a stationary point. For the accurate description of electronic excitations, TDDFT methods with functionals of PBE0, PBE0-1/3 (33.3% HFexc),39,40 MPW1K (42.8% HFexc),41 BHandHLYP (50% HFexc),42 and the range-separated fucntional CAM-B3LYP (19% HFexc at short-range and 65% HFexc at long-range)43 were selected to simulate the absorption spectra for dyes 1, 2, and 3 in THF solution.44,45 The calculated results indicate that the TDDFT-MPW1K method provides relatively accurate maximum absorption wavelengths in comparison to the experimental data (see Table S2, ESI†). Hence TDDFT-MPW1K was chosen for simulation of absorption spectra.
The systems for dyes adsorbed on a Ti16O32 cluster were also optimized with pseudo-potential basis set LANL2DZ for Ti and 6-311G(d,p) for the rest of the atoms. The electronic excitations for both dyes and their dye–Ti16O32 complexes with the optimized ground-state geometries were calculated using the TDDFT method in THF solution by iteratively solving 50 excitations. The ICT properties were analyzed by using Multiwfn software.46 All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.47
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometrical structures of dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes
All the investigated dyes are fully optimized without any structural constraints. The geometrical structures of dyes A1, A2, B1, and B2 as examples are shown in Fig. 2, and the optimized structures of other dyes are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Some dihedral angles as indicated in Fig. 2 are collected in Table 1. The twisted angles between NP and adjacent thiophene or benzene in A1 and B1 are 44.1° and 49.8°, respectively. Such a large distorsion might not be beneficial for the interaction of NP as a donor moiety with the acceptor unit BTBA. The dyes in which NP is rigidified with adjacent moieties via either 5- or 6-member rings show expanded structural planarity. The π-spacer of thiophene in A2 and A3 has a distorted angle (α1) with benzothiadiazole (BTD) of about 0.4° and 5.6°, respectively, which is smaller than that of A1. In the B series dyes, ethyne-linked benzene and BTD exhibit a completely planar structure, which would be beneficial for the ICT and red-shifted absorption spectra. The dihedral angle (α2) for all the dyes is in the range of 35.2°–38.1°. The lack of planarity between benzoic acid and BTD might be favorable for preventing electron recombination from TiO2 to the dyes. The dihedral angle (α3) between benzene and the end-capped carboxyl group is almost zero.

For accurate simulation of the dye–TiO2 complexes, the size of TiO2 should be as large as possible to represent the properties of the dyes adsorbed on bulk TiO2. The cluster of medium-sized (TiO2)16 was selected as a model semiconductor substrate by a compromise between the computational cost and accuracy, and it has been proved large enough to reproduce the electronic absorption spectra48,49 and successfully applied for the investigations of nano-TiO2 in previous work.50–53 The anatase (101) surface of TiO2 was employed to adsorb the sensitizers for the reason that this surface has a smaller surface energy and a high efficiency for DSSCs.54 The optimized structures of dye–TiO2 complexes are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The dye is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface via its carboxylate group in a bidentate bridging manner with one proton being transferred to a nearby surface oxygen atom, which is the most favorable adsorption mode, as demonstrated by experimental and computational studies.55,56 The two oxygen atoms are covalently bonded with the five-coordinate Ti atoms at the anatase (101) surface of Ti16O32. The calculated distances between the two carboxylate oxygens and connected titanium atoms in all the dye–TiO2 complexes are in the range of 1.98–2.02 Å, which is comparable to the Ti–O bond lengths in bulk TiO2 (1.934–1.980 Å). The calculated bond lengths indicate that strong chemisorption of the dyes on the TiO2(101) surface occurs, which is favorable for charge injection from the excited dyes to the semiconductor.
3.2 Absorption properties
The light absorption property of a sensitizer is one of the most important factors affecting the performance of the cell, and an ideal sensitizer should harvest the solar energy as much as possible in the visible and near infrared region. Based on the analysis of geometrical structures, we know that the rigidification of NP could further flatten the molecular structures and extend the π-conjugation of dyes. Herein, we will investigate the effects of such molecular modifications on the absorption properties of these NP-based dyes.
The simulated electronic spectra of the dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes are shown in Fig. 3. The vertical excitation energy (E), maximum absorption wavelength (λmax), oscillator strength (f), light harvesting efficiency (ΦLHE(λ)), and transition characters for S0 → S1 for the dyes are collected in Table 2. At a given wavelength λ with oscillator strength f, ΦLHE(λ) can be obtained as ΦLHE(λ) = 1–10−f. Here, the light harvesting efficiency at the maximum absorption wavelength (ΦLHE(λmax)) is considered. To undertake a comprehensive comparison of absorption ability of the dyes, the normalized integrated area (S) in the range of 300–850 nm of the absorption spectra is also evaluated by taking the integrated spectral area of A1 as a reference. Compared with A1, the one-sided rigidified dyes A2 and A3 show red-shifted and stronger maximum absorption peaks, and the bilateral rigidified molecules A2s and A3s exhibit significantly red-shifted absorption and enlarged integrated spectral areas, which evidence that the rigidification of NP will greatly enhance the light-absorption ability of a dye. The same tendency of the light-absorbing enhancement is observed for the dyes with NP immobilized benzene units. The enhanced light-absorbing ability in the A series mainly lies in the wider absorption spectral range, which is derived from the contribution of the strong electron-donating ability of the rigidified thiophene units to the red-shifted absorption; while that for B series can be attributed to the stronger absorption oscillator strength for the reason that the extension of π-conjugation with rigidified ethynylbenzene is more prominent in the enhancement of absorption oscillator strength than broadening the spectra. The immobilization of NP via either 6-member or 5-member rings enables similar light-absorption ability for the one-sided rigidified dyes, while bilateral dyes with NP rigidification via a 6-member ring show better light-absorption ability than those rigidified via a 5-member ring. For instance, A2 (B2) possesses a similar integrated spectral area to A3 (B3), while A2s (B2s) has a larger integrated spectral area than A3s (B3s).

All the investigated rigidified dyes have common spectral features including very strong absorption peaks at long wavelength (450–850 nm) and relatively weak absorption at short wavelength (300–450 nm). For better understanding the origin of the absorption process, the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of dyes A2, A3, B2, and B3 are depicted in Fig. 4, and the FMOs for the rest of the dyes are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). All the dyes have similar FMO spatial distributions. The HOMOs are distributed at the NP moiety and part of the BTD unit because of the molecular planarity and extended π-conjugation, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are localized on BTBA and the connection part between NP and BTBA. There exist overlapped parts between the HOMO and LUMO in the middle of the molecular skeleton, which is beneficial to the ICT from the NP unit to the BTBA group. The LUMO+1 of the dye is mostly concentrated on the NP moiety, and only a small portion of it is contributed from the BTD unit. The maximum absorption peaks originate from the dominant excitation from ground state (S0) to the first excited state (S1) and are mostly attributed to the transitions from HOMO to LUMO for all the molecules, as indicated in Table 2. The apparent HOMO–LUMO separation indicates that the ICT transitions occur. Therefore, ICT transitions could be responsible for the red-shifted spectra. Notably, there are minor contributions from the HOMO to LUMO+1 transition for dyes B2 and B3, which can be regarded as the local π–π* transition. This might be the reason for the less red-shifted absorption in the B series molecules. So, for these dyes with similar dimension, the more contributions of the transition from HOMO to LUMO in the absorption process, the more red-shifted the spectra would be expected.
 Fig. 4  Spatial distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of dyes A2, A3, B2 and B3 (saturated H atoms are not shown). 
The dye–TiO2 complexes have red-shifted absorption spectra in comparison to those of the dyes, which is in agreement with previous works.57,58 The spectra of the dye–TiO2 complexes might be more indicative of the capacity of utilizing sunlight in the practical cell devices.
3.3 Frontier orbital levels of isolated dyes
The energy levels of frontier orbitals, especially HOMO and LUMO levels, are closely related to the electron injection from the sensitizer to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and dye regeneration in the electrolyte. Thus, the HOMO and LUMO levels must fulfill the basic energetic requirement for the normal operation of the TiO2-DSSC device.
The energy levels of the HOMO and the LUMO for all the dyes are shown in Fig. 5. The dyes have similar LUMO levels (−2.76 to −2.80 eV for A series and −2.82 to −2.85 eV for B series) for the reason that the LUMOs are mainly distributed in the BTBA unit of the molecules, as can be seen from the LUMO plots of dyes in Fig. 4 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Although the calculated LUMO levels might be overestimated a bit, they are much higher than the CB level of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum),59,60 ensuring that an effective electron injection occurs from the LUMOs of dyes to the CB of TiO2. The HOMO levels of all the dyes are lower than the redox potential energy of I3−/I− (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum),61–63 which guarantees that the dyes can be regenerated in the electrolyte solution. Different from the LUMO levels, the HOMO levels of the molecules are significantly influenced by the different immobilization of NPs with thiophene or benzene rings. We found that the bilateral rigidified dyes have higher HOMO levels and narrower HOMO–LUMO gaps than the one-sided modified dyes. The dyes with immobilization via a 6-member ring show higher HOMO energy levels and narrower HOMO–LUMO gaps than the dyes with rigidification via a 5-member ring. In comparison to the B series dyes, the thiophene-based A series dyes possess higher HOMO levels because of the relatively stronger electron-donating ability of the thiophene ring. The decreased HOMO–LUMO gaps in the rigidified dyes will be beneficial for better utilization of sunlight.

3.4 Intramolecular charge separation
From the aforementioned absorption spectra, we know that all the dyes possess apparent ICT transitions from the NP moiety to the BTBA part in the absorption process. Such an efficient charge separation could be favourable to the interfacial electron injection from the dyes to the CB of TiO2. To quantify the extent of charge separation of the dyes, the electron density difference (Δρ) between the ground-state and the first excited-state was analysed.64Fig. 6 shows the spatial charge separation for the A series dyes, in which two different colors denote the decrease and increase of electron density relative to the ground state and two centroids of charges correspond to the positive and negative density regions, which are calculated through a Gaussian distribution with root-mean-square deviations. The Δρ plots of the B series dyes are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Apparently, all the dyes show noticeable charge separation properties. The regions of electron density increment are distributed on the BTBA segments, while the zones of electron density depletion are located around the NP moieties.
 Fig. 6  Computed difference in total density between the ground and excited states (Δρ) and graphical representation of DCT using the isocontour value of 0.0004 au for the A series dyes. 
Several relevant physical quantities were calculated based on Δρ between the ground-state and the first excited-state. The transferred charge (Δq) can be obtained by the integration of electron density of the increment or depletion over all space for one electron excitation. The value of Δq is between 0 and 1 in principle, but the calculated Δq might be slightly larger than 1 due to the numerical integration errors. The charge-transfer length (DCT) is defined as the spatial distance between the barycenters of electron density increment and density depletion regions.64Ecoul is the coulombic attractive energy for charge separation, which can be estimated in terms of Δq and DCT as follows: (1)where ε0 and εr are dielectric constants of the vacuum and real medium, respectively (εr is set as 4.0 in the polar solvent).
It has been demonstrated that the ICT ability is associated with the electronic couplings between fragments in molecules. Assuming that θ is the dihedral angle between the conjugation planes of the fragments, usually, as the angle θ is increased, the coupling decreases, as ∼cosθ.65 The discussion of Δq and DCT is based on the similar electronic coupling in the systems.64 Obviously, the non-planar and planar NP-based dyes exhibit different electronic couplings between NP and an adjacent thiophene or benzene unit. To focus on evaluating the effect of the method of molecular rigidification on the charge transfer property, here, we only consider the charge transfer property of the planar NP-based dyes. The calculated relevant parameters are collected in Table 3. For the dyes with similar dimensions (one-sided or two-sided rigidified dyes), the dyes with NP immobilization via a 6-member ring show larger Δq and longer DCT values than those via a 5-member ring. Having more charges involved in the ICT could be beneficial to add charges for electron injection, but they inevitably increase the coulombic attractive energy for charge separation. A larger value of DCT is favourable for charge separation at the dye/TiO2 interface. The bilateral dyes show relatively smaller Ecoul values than their single-sided counterparts, exhibiting outstanding charge separation properties. For the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, Δq and DCT are larger than those of the isolated dyes.

3.5 Aromaticities and reorganization energies
For better understanding the effect of different connection modes on the ICT properties of the sensitizers, the π-electron localization functions and aromaticities of the NP units and their connected thiophene/phenyl rings were calculated to characterize the π-electron characters. Localized orbital locator-π (LOL-π)66 could provide an intuitive picture of the π-orbital in the dye and the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS)67 can be used to measure aromaticity of the individual ring (1 Å above the ring center). Both LOL-π and NICS(1) are calculated based on the wave functions of the ground-state structures. The calculated color-filled contours of LOL-π and NICS(1) values of molecular fragments of NP with its one-sided connected thiophene/benzene are shown in Fig. 7, and those of the two-sided rigidified NPs are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Color-filled contours of localized orbital locator-π (LOL-π) at a distance of 1.2 Bohr away from the rigidified NP plane, and the inserted values indicate the NICS(1) values of the individual heterocyclic rings. 
We can see that the regions with high LOL-π values are associated with π bonding orbitals, while the regions with small LOL-π values are in the boundary areas between localized π orbitals. The contiguous regions in yellow and red can be regarded as the delocalized π orbitals, which are possible through bond electron transfer pathways. Compared to the individual ring in NP fragments, the corresponding rings in the rigidified NPs possess smaller NICS(1) values. The NICS(1) of the thiophene or benzene ring in immobilized NPs is significantly decreased in comparison to the individual thiophene or benzene ring, respectively. Chen et al. demonstrated that the molecular conductance correlates negatively with the aromaticity in a single-molecule conductance measurement.68 So, the decreased NICS(1) values in rigidified NPs result in decreased aromaticity of the rings, which would be favorable for ICT.
For the rigidified NPs via 5- or 6-member rings, we could observe that there is no delocalized electron on the connected atoms (–CH2–) of the LOL-π isosurfaces. So, the immobilization is helpful to make the molecular skeleton planar, instead of causing possible trapped or disturbed π-electrons in the electron transfer process. The NICS(1) values are 1.4 and −1.6 for the 6-member (in A2) and 5-member (in A3) connection ring, respectively. These rings are not highly antiaromitic and even approximate to nonaromaticity (a small NICS(0) value and close to zero).68 The NICS(1) values of thiophene (−6.1 in A2) and benzene rings (−8.2 in B2) of dyes via a 6-member ring rigidification are smaller than those of the corresponding ones (−6.9 in B2 and −8.9 in B3) via a 5-member ring. This observed decreased aromaticity of the rings would be of benefit to the ICT. Indeed, Δq and DCT of A2 (B2) are 0.84 e− (0.90 e−) and 5.75 Å (7.21 Å), respectively, which are larger and longer than those of A3 (B3). It can also be seen from the LOL-π isosurfaces that the electron in the π-bridge of the benzene ring of B2 is less delocalized, which would make it easier for electrons to escape from the π-conjugated ring and complete the ICT. So, NP via a 6-member rigidification could be favorable for electron transfer.
The calculated reorganization energies of all the NP moieties are summarized in Table 4. Here, we only do the simplified reorganization energy calculation of NPs (shown in Fig. 1) for the reason that more attention is paid to the rigidification effect and also the BTBA part is the same for all the investigated dyes. The quantity reflects the energy required for the structural relaxation upon charge transfer, including contributions from the inner reorganization energy (Λint, which is induced by intramolecular vibrations) and external reorganization energy (Λext, which is caused by polarization of the surrounding medium). Λint is calculated directly from the relevant points on the adiabatic potential energy surfaces using the standard equation:69 Λint = Λ0 + Λ+ = (E0* − E0) + (E+* − E+)(2)where E0 and E+ represent the energies of neutral and cation species in their lowest energy geometries, respectively, while E0* and E+* indicate the energies of the neutral and cation species with the stable geometries of cation and neutral species, respectively. Λext can be obtained as:70 (3)where E denotes the energy of a particular electronic configuration: neutral molecule (M) or charged molecule (M+). The superscript refers to the polarization of the continuum dielectric used to model the surrounding solvent. E0(M) and E0(M+) indicate that the energy has been evaluated with the solvent polarization that stabilizes the neutral and positively charged molecule, respectively. E(1)(M) and E(1)(M+) indicate that the energy has been evaluated with the solvent polarization that stabilizes the positively charged and neutral molecule, respectively. Compared to the unfixed dyes, the corresponding rigidified dyes possess both slightly smaller inner and external reorganization energies, ensuring the improved photochemical stability of the dyes as expected. From the view of charge transfer, the immobilization of dyes has a positive influence on the electron transfer via modulation of the reorganization energy.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we have performed a DFT/TDDFT calculation on how the rigidified and expanded NP moieties affect the electronic properties of a series of D–π–A dyes. Analysis of the physical parameters in relation to the light-absorption ability and ICT property allows us to obtain the conclusions as follows:
• The NP-based dyes rigidified with the thiophene unit possess increased light-harvesting abilities mainly due to a significantly wider absorption spectral range, while the reason for the dyes immobilized with the benzene ring is the stronger absorption oscillator strength; the one-sided dyes via a 6-member or 5-member immobilization possess similar light-absorption ability, while the bilateral dyes via a 6-member ring rigidification have better capacity for the utilization of light.
• The acceptor of BTBA is extensively involved in the formation of the LUMOs, leading to the similar LUMO levels for all the investigated dyes. The dyes with the immobilization via a 6-member ring show higher HOMO energy levels and narrower HOMO–LUMO gaps than the dyes with the rigidification via a 5-member ring. Such decreased HOMO–LUMO gaps in the dyes will be favorable for the red-shifted absorption spectra, which is consistent with the results obtained from the light-absorption ability discussion.
• The dyes with the rigidification via a 6-member ring show a larger Δq and longer DCT than those via a 5-member ring; the bilateral dyes show a relatively smaller Ecoul than the single-sided counterparts, exhibiting outstanding charge separation properties.
• In comparison to the NICS(1) values in NP, and the thiophene and benzene units, the NPs via a 5- or 6-member immobilization decrease the aromaticities of the corresponding rings in the π system, avoid electron trapping in possible multiple electron transfer pathways and thus show favorable ICT properties.
• The dyes with a rigidified molecular skeleton show small reorganization energies, which guarantees the photochemical stability.
The calculated results show that the chemical modification of NP moieties causes obvious effects on the performance of dyes. The bilateral dyes via a 6-member immobilization would be promising candidates due to the excellent light-absorption ability, favorable ICT and outstanding charge separation properties, and good photochemical stability. We provide an effective way to modulate the photoelectronic properties of such NP-based dyes and give a theoretical guideline for the design of high-performance dyes.
