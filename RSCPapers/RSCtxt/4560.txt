In the context of solid-oxide fuel cells, STO has been recently applied as an epitaxial substrate for nano-sized layers of mixed ion–electron conductive catalysts with enhanced electrochemical performances. To extend the applications of such heterogeneous nano-cathodes in real devices, also the STO support should be active for both electron transport and oxide diffusion. To this end, we explored using first-principles calculations the strategy of doping of STO at the Sr site with sodium and potassium. These two ions fit in the perovskite structure and induce holes in the STO valence band, so as to obtain the desired p-type electronic conduction. At the same time, the doping with alkali ions also promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies in STO, a prerequisite for effective oxide diffusion. Analysis of electron density rearrangements upon defect formation allows relating the favorable vacancy formation energies to an improved electronic delocalization over the oxide sub-lattice, as observed in closely related materials (e.g. Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6). Overall, our results suggest the alkali-doped STO as a new potential substrate material in nanoscale heterogeneous electrodes for solid oxide electrochemical cells.
Introduction
Renewable energy sources are key for an environmentally safe and sustainable future. However, most of them are vexed with a fundamental limitation: intermittency. Photovoltaic solar cells and wind turbines are stereotypical examples of devices that are not able to provide a continuous flow of electric power, unless they are equipped with an energy storage system.1 Hence, great efforts are being devoted to the implementation of strategies for an efficient storage of energy, to be readily used when electric power generation is low or null.
On the one hand, research is pushing on batteries and supercapacitors.2–5 On the other, new strategies based on the electrochemical conversion of electricity into chemical energy are gaining more and more interest. The fuel produced by such electrolyser cells (ECs) can be properly stored, waiting for its on-demand reconversion into electric energy, which is fulfilled by inverse devices (fuel cells, FCs) carrying out the inverse electrochemical process.6–9
In recent times, devices capable of switching reversibly from an EC-mode to a FC-mode and vice versa have been designed, where, evidently, the same material must alternatively act as a cathode and an anode.10–13
Currently, the most promising of such devices for large-scale fuel production/conversion rely on the solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology, in which all the active components (i.e. both the porous electrodes and the dense electrolyte) are made of ceramic materials. SOFCs offer high conversion efficiencies combined with a net economical advantage, due to the absence of expensive metal catalysts, like platinum.14,15 In the most widespread version of SOFCs, oxide ions are responsible for charge transport between the two electrodes through the electrolyte, so the high operating temperatures (>800 °C) are needed to facilitate oxide diffusion, and also help to overcome the overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode surface.16 To improve the durability of these devices, the so-called intermediate-temperature SOFCs (IT-SOFC) have been designed, in which the working temperature is lowered in the range between 600 and 800 °C. In these cells, the introduction of mixed ion–electron conducting (MIEC) electrodes leads to a considerable extension of the electrode active region, thus reducing the ORR overpotential.17 Thus, in order to be eligible for employment in reversible IT-SOFC technology, a candidate material should show good MIEC properties, i.e. have both high electronic conductivity and good oxide ion transport properties.
Perovskite oxides (POs) are the most employed electrode materials for SOFCs.18,19 POs are solids with a general ABO3 stoichiometry, with A- and B-sites being occupied by metal cations with different ionic radii. It was established that ionic conduction in POs takes place thanks to the migration of oxide ions through hopping in vacant oxygen sites,20,21 so that the oxide diffusion rate is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetics of two relevant processes: the formation of oxygen vacancies and the migration of oxide ions from an occupied site to a vacant one.
Typical POs are semiconductors, so neither electronic nor ionic conductivity is expected to occur under normal conditions, aside from effects due to the presence of intrinsic defects. Nevertheless, proper unbalancing of the total charge leads to electronic n- or p-type conductive behavior. Thus, substitutional doping with aliovalent ions can induce the desired electronic conductivity.
Doped POs are commonly employed in SOFCs as cathodes, with lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM), ferrite (LSF) and cobaltite (LSC) being the most common examples.22–24 Although these POs show good electronic conduction and catalytic properties, they also exhibit good ion transport properties only at high temperatures. As a consequence, many alternatives have been suggested in the last few years, ranging from actual MIEC materials, like lanthanum strontium cobaltite ferrite (LSCF), to LSM composites with yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). In fact, YSZ has excellent ionic transport properties and for this reason it is the most used SOFC electrolyte. Cermets obtained by the addition of nickel to YSZ are also employed as anode materials.14,25
Strontium titanate, SrTiO3 (STO), is a typical perovskite substrate for the epitaxial growth of SOFC anodes.26,27 Furthermore, in recent years very high carrier densities were reported at the interfaces of layered composite materials STO/YSZ and STO/LSM.28,29 In this perspective, the preparation of active STO derivatives with improved MIEC performances has received huge interest. Materials based on electron-donor doped (n-doped) STO were recently proposed because of their high electronic conductivities under reducing conditions and their resistance to sulfur poisoning.30,31 Several investigations on n-doping at the A-site,32–37 and/or at the B-site38–44 are reported in the literature.
Some efforts have also been made to design materials based on p-doped STO, showing high electronic conductivity under oxidizing conditions. Almost only substitutional doping of titanium ions was explored for this purpose,45,46 and very interesting ionic and mixed n-/p-type conductivities were obtained by codoping with lanthanum.42,47 In contrast, there is scant information about the effects of p-doping at the A-site. The addition of potassium to STO has been demonstrated to enhance catalytic properties for diesel soot combustion,48 and doping with other alkali (lithium, caesium) has also been successfully tested for this purpose.49 To the best of our knowledge, however, no computational studies explaining the underlying reasons behind these improvements are available at the present time.
In this paper we report an ab initio DFT+U study on the effects of p-doping by alkali ions, namely potassium and sodium, on the properties of STO.
The DFT+U method has been widely applied for STO derivatives,46,50–52 as well as other oxides containing transition metals. Standard DFT density functionals cannot describe exactly the exchange energy, because of the well-known self-interaction error (SIE) that promotes an excessive delocalization of electron densities. In transition metal oxides the SIE can increase dramatically since there can be spare electrons populating contracted d and f orbitals.53 For our investigation this is particularly important since oxygen vacancies formally leave spare electrons in titanium d states. As to correct for the SIE, in the DFT+U approach an average effective potential is applied ad hoc to the electrons in the specific orbitals involved at the specific atomic center, so that a more physically correct description of the electron density can be achieved. Using this computational strategy, we investigated these new p-doped STO-based materials, focusing on their bulk structure, electronic structure, and on the vacancy formation process. Here, we clearly point out the role of alkali dopants in these properties, thus introducing new potential candidates for SOFC electrodes.
Method and computational details
Our quantum-chemical approach is based on spin-polarized Kohn–Sham DFT calculations, as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP, V5.3.3).54–57 This package relies on periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions in order to reproduce the electronic structure and plane-wave basis sets to build up the Kohn–Sham wavefunctions. The adequate plane-wave kinetic energy cut-off was chosen after performing test calculations of bulk total energy with increasing cut-off values. The cut-off value was set to 800 eV, which ensured convergence within 1 meV per formula unit with respect to higher cut-off values.
The Projector-Augmented Wave (PAW) method58,59 was adopted to reproduce the electronic shells around each nucleus, using the potentials available in the VASP repository.60 The following electrons were explicitly considered for self-consistent optimization for the elements present in our models: Sr 4s24p65s2, K 3s23p64s1, Na 2s22p63s1, Ti 3p63d24s2 and O 2s22p4.
The DFT exchange and correlation interactions were considered within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)+U scheme, adopting the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.61,62 The on-site Coulomb interaction was introduced for titanium d-electrons only, through the simplified Dudarev approach.63 The effective Hubbard parameter, Ueff = (U − J), for Ti d states was chosen equal to 4 eV, following the previous literature on STO.50,51,64
We built three models in order to study SrTiO3 p-doping with alkali ions (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Simulation cells of STO derivatives: (A) STO unit cell, (B) 40-atom Sr0.75K0.25TiO3 supercell, and (C) 2√2 × 2√2 × 2√2, 80-atom Sr0.75K0.25TiO3 supercell. Color code: Sr (green), Ti (blue), O (red), and K (purple). 
First, a cubic unit cell of undoped STO was optimized, in order to validate the computational approach through comparing structural data with the experimental literature (details provided in the ESI†). Secondly, cubic 2 × 2 × 2 supercells containing 40 atoms (i.e. 8 formula units) were optimized. In these supercells, we have partially substituted Sr atoms at the A-site by either K or Na. Resulting Sr1−xKxTiO3 and Sr1−xNaxTiO3 are referred as K:STO and Na:STO all through the text, respectively. Complete relaxation of both atomic coordinates and cell dimensions was allowed for these models, without any symmetry constraint.
We have considered doping fractions x = 0.125 and 0.250 (respectively one and two defects per supercell), exploring all possible relative dispositions. For x = 0.250, three possible configurations exist, with the two alkali dopant neighbors, respectively, along the [100], [111] and [101] direction. The corresponding cell constants differ by less than 0.001 Å. Following the work of Mohn and co-workers,65,66 we evaluated the energy of each configuration and calculated their Boltzmann distribution at several temperatures (Table 1) according to the formula:  where ni indicates the Boltzmann probability of occupation of the ith configuration, ΔEi is the total energy difference between the ith and the lowest energy configuration (conf 1), kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.

At SOFC operating temperature (∼1500 K), all the three configurations are populated, with the conf 1 (dopants as next neighbors along the [100] direction) as slightly favored. It must be pointed out, however, that these data are only qualitative indicative since they neglect vibrational contributions as well as configurational entropy, and further statistical studies should be carried out in the future.
In the following we will only report data referring to the most isotropic distribution of defects inside the supercells (which corresponds to conf 2), since they should reproduce more faithfully the average disposition of dopants in the actual isotropic materials.
Corresponding oxides with sub-stoichiometric oxygen content were reproduced by removing a neutral oxygen atom from the model supercells, i.e. forming an oxygen vacancy (in Kröger–Vink notation):  After the introduction of a vacancy, only atomic positions were allowed to relax. In the so-obtained structures, representing compounds with formula Sr1−xAxTiO3−δ, the vacancy concentration is 4.2% (1 over 24 oxygen lattice sites, δ = 0.125). However, even with the highest A-site dopant content (2 atoms per supercell) these models cannot reproduce the actual p-type doped material, since the holes introduced by dopants do not exceed the two electrons from the oxygen vacancy formation.
For this reason, rhombohedral 80-atom (16 formula units) 2√2 × 2√2 × 2√2 supercells were employed. In these cells only the doping fraction x = 0.25 was studied, focusing on the most isotropic arrangement of dopant ions. We adopted previously optimized cell constants and only atomic coordinates were allowed to relax. These large supercells guarantee that the p character is preserved in doped systems after the formation of the oxygen vacancy (concentration 2.1%, i.e. 1/48 oxygen sites, δ = 0.063), thus providing a reliable model of the p-type materials.
The isolated O2 molecule was modelled at the PBE level of theory in a 10 × 10 × 10 Å3 supercell.
For structural optimization, we chose a convergence criterion of 10 meV Å−1 for Hellmann–Feynman forces on each atom, and a threshold of 10−5 eV for SCF electronic energy.
We adopted a method of integration based on Gaussian smearing (σ = 0.01 eV), and the Monkhorst–Pack (MP) reciprocal space sampling scheme:67 8 × 8 × 8 k-grids were used for unit cells, 4 × 4 × 4 grids for 40-atom supercells, and Γ-point centered 2 × 2 × 2 grids for 80-atom supercells.
The total charge densities were analyzed using the Bader Atom In Molecule (AIM) approach,68–70 as implemented in the program by Arnaldsson et al.71 (v. 0.28a).
The tetrahedron method of integration using Blöchl corrections72 on doubly finer, Γ-centered MP sampling grids was only used to obtain atom- and orbital-projected densities of states (PDOS) on previously optimized geometries. In these single-point calculations, a tighter convergence threshold (10−7 eV) was requested for electronic energy. Single-point calculations were also performed using the standard PBE functional and the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional.73,74

Results and discussion
Stoichiometric STO
As a preliminary step, we checked the reliability of our quantum-chemical method by verifying the good reproduction of the structural properties of undoped STO. The calculated lattice constant (Table 2) agrees well with the experimental value a = 3.91 Å (further details are provided in the ESI†).76

Like other oxides made of a network of TiO6 octahedra, STO is not fully ionic and shows a significant hybridization of O2p and Ti3d states in its most energetic valence band (see PDOS analysis in the first panel of Fig. 2), although states in the proximity of the Fermi level are mostly related to O2p orbitals only. In the first conduction band, the largest contribution to the density of states derives instead from Ti3d orbitals.77,78

A-site cations and inner shell electrons give negligible contribution to the PDOS in the range of interest, so only oxygen p states (red) and titanium d states (blue) are shown, as well as the overall DOS (grey). The Fermi energy (EF) is taken as a reference for the data. 
The partial covalent character of Ti–O bonds in STO is also confirmed by the analysis of the effective atomic charges we accomplished through Bader's AIM approach (Table 3, STO, δ = 0 entry). All three elements carry a smaller charge than their formal one (+2 for Sr, +4 for Ti, −2 for O), but this discrepancy affects more markedly Ti and O atoms.

Alkali-doped STO
Potassium and sodium monovalent ions in cuboctahedral sites possess ionic radii of 1.64 and 1.39 Å, to be compared to the strontium divalent ion (1.44 Å).79 For ATiO3 perovskite materials, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor is written as  with rA being the average ionic radius of A-site cations, and rTi and rO, respectively, the ionic radii of Ti4+ and O2− in octahedral coordination. For STO t = 1, hence is a perfect, undistorted perovskite. For K:STO and Na:STO the tolerance factor deviates only slightly from unity, and even for the highest doping fraction (25%) t = 1.016 and 0.994, respectively. Moreover, the aforementioned experimental results on K-doped STO nanocrystals confirmed that loadings up to 20% allow the retention of the perovskite structure.48 Thus, we expect that the STO lattice should be able to easily accommodate the chosen dopant ions maintaining its original crystalline cubic phase.
The substitution of strontium ions with the alkali dopants leads effectively to minor structural modifications (Table 2, δ = 0 entry). In particular, the effect of K-doping is a slight expansion of the STO unit cell, while a contraction is observed after Na-doping, both proportional to the doping fraction. These opposite effects are ascribable to the different sizes of the A-site cations. At the same time, a modest distortion of TiO6 octahedra is found with both K and Na, the former being associated with bigger deformations, because of its larger ionic radius.
No significant differences are reported between 40-atom and 80-atom supercells, meaning that the accommodation of dopant atoms does not involve any long range structural modification.
In p-doped materials the presence of substitutional atoms with lower valence is associated with the formation of electron holes in order to compensate for the charge imbalance. This does not affect significantly the charge values of each atom in the cell (see Table 3, δ = 0 entry), but an overall analysis of the Bader charges indicates that the hole is delocalized, mostly on the oxygen sublattice (up to 80% of the hole charge is compensated by oxygen atoms, and the remaining fraction by titanium atoms).
Hole formation clearly influences the density of states of the system (left panels of Fig. 2). The two alkali dopants have very similar effects on the electronic structure of the resulting materials: both are monovalent cations substituting for a divalent cation (Sr), leading to hole-conducting doped systems, recognizable from the unoccupied O2p states appearing at the upper boundary of the valence band.
It is worth noting that the electronic band gap energy is almost unmodified in all doped systems.
Effects on oxygen vacancy formation
The energy associated with the oxygen vacancy formation process (ΔEf,vac) in STO, Na:STO and K:STO was evaluated using the formula:ΔEf,vac = Evac − Epure + ½EO2where the quantities involved are the energies of the relaxed structures before (Epure) and after (Evac) the formation of a vacancy, and the energy of a gas phase oxygen molecule in its triplet ground state (EO2). Computed in this way, ΔEf,vac corresponds to enthalpies of formation of oxygen vacancies at zero Kelvin and does not include finite temperature and entropic effects. In recent studies on Sr-doped LaMO3 perovskites, we found that the inclusion of thermal and entropic terms changes the absolute values of computed vacancy formation enthalpies and free energies, but not the formation-energy trends among similar formulations.21,23,24
The electronic and structural effects of substoichiometric oxygen content in pure STO have been already debated in the recent past, and a considerable amount of both experimental and theoretical literature is currently available.46,80–85 Our results are in line with the most recent outcomes.
We found that the formation of a neutral oxygen vacancy in the STO lattice is associated with a modest readjustment of atomic positions. In particular, the two Ti atoms adjacent to the vacancy site, , drift apart from each other, with respect to their positions in pure STO (Table 2).
When a neutral oxygen atom is removed to generate a vacancy, formally two electrons are left into the lattice. In STO, this charge is mostly carried by the two  atoms, which gain about 0.35 electrons each (Table 3). This situation corresponds to a formal Ti4+–Ti3+ reduction after breaking of two Ti–O bonds, and the overall process is energetically costly, as the oxygen vacancy formation requires about 5.3 eV (Table 4). This estimation is consistent with other computational results, and approaches the experimental value reported by Moos and Härdtl (6.1 eV).85

Table 4 also lists the oxygen vacancy formation energies (ΔEf,vac) of all doped systems. The introduction of substitutional alkali ions is accompanied by a massive reduction of this energetic cost, which is found to be proportional to the dopant content. In 25%-doped STO very low values of ΔEf,vac are found (below 0.4 eV in larger supercells), meaning that the formation of vacancies is dramatically facilitated by the doping process.
Both K:STO and Na:STO show this enhancement in a very similar fashion, and thus we can suppose that it is mostly due to electronic features: in p-doped systems the spare charges associated with the vacancy formation process can compensate for the holes generated by the lower valence cations; thereby the whole system is energetically stabilized and the vacancy formation process is favored.
It should be noted that the vacancy concentration (i.e. the supercell size) has a modest influence on ΔEf,vac, which is close to zero for δ = 0.063. Thus, we can expect this degree of non-stoichiometry in substituted STO.
As can be seen in the rightmost columns of Table 3, the reduction of the two  atoms becomes less and less marked with increasing dopant concentrations, so that in doped systems the spare charge is not localized on those specific titanium atoms anymore. This has the direct consequence of pushing the two  atoms further away from each other, because of electrostatic repulsion (Table 2, δ > 0 entries). However, this effect is more pronounced in Na:STO than in K:STO. Since the atomic charges are very similar in the two systems, this could be another effect related to the different ionic sizes of the dopants: bigger ions like potassium could lead to a more rigid structure than sodium.
We further looked into the fate of the electrons left by oxygen vacancies in pristine and doped STO, by calculating their delocalization over the oxygen (ΔqO), titanium (ΔqTi) and strontium (ΔqSr) sublattices. We employed the following formula:21  in which X = O, Ti or Sr identifies a specific sublattice, while each qi is the Bader electron charge of the ith atom belonging to the X sublattice. The term at the numerator sums over all the atoms of the sublattice the differences between the charges in the system with full oxygen stoichiometry (ref) and the corresponding system in which the vacancy is present (vac), and is then divided by the average charge of an oxygen atom in the reference.
In Fig. 3 we correlate the different ΔqX with the oxygen vacancy formation energy. We already showed that undoped STO has the highest vacancy formation energy. In this system, a considerable fraction of charge is localized on the Ti sublattice, and in particular on the two Ti atoms adjacent to the vacancy site, as discussed above. In alkali-doped STO the excess charge is evidently more delocalized on the oxygen sublattice. Such delocalization has the effect of stabilizing the vacancies, thus reducing the relative formation energy. Comparable values were found for Na-doping and K-doping, so as to suggest that this effect is driven by charge compensation only.
 Fig. 3  Oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEf,vac) as a function of the cumulative variation of the Bader effective charges delocalized over the titanium and oxygen sublattices upon formation of the vacancy. Starred data refer to undoped STO. Data are evaluated in 40-atom supercells (δ = 0.125), and data on 80-atom supercells show a similar trend and are only reported in the ESI.† 
The Bader charge variation associated with the Sr sublattice is almost unrelated in the vacancy formation energy, and it is below 10% in all cases.
These results are in qualitative agreement with HSE data on STO and K:STO (see the ESI†).
We finally focus on the electronic structure of these systems, by commenting the PDOS analysis in the right panels of Fig. 2. Oxygen non-stoichiometry confers an n-type conducting character upon pure STO, evidenced by the Fermi level shifting inside the STO conduction band. In p-doped systems, instead, positive charges from the dopant ions compensate for negative spare electrons left by the vacancy formation process, which may lead to an overall neutralization and hence to electronic insulation. However, in real systems the concentration of vacancies is usually severely lower than any useful amount of dopant impurities, so that the p-type behavior is preserved even with oxygen deficient compositions. As shown in Fig. 2, the large 80-atom supercells guarantee the expected p-type character even after the introduction of oxygen vacancies.
Conclusions
In this work, we have reported a first-principles investigation on the structural and electronic properties of p-doped SrTiO3, obtained through substitution of Sr cations with alkali metals (K and Na). Although titanates are well known SOFC materials, A-site STO modification has never been explored for the design of new potential p-type electrodes for this technology.
We specifically focused on the electronic structure and energetics of doped systems at different concentrations of oxygen vacancies, since the ease of generation of such defects is an essential property for potentially active materials to be employed in SOFCs.
The chosen dopants allow the retention of the perovskite structure, reporting minor modifications of lattice cell dimensions and an increase of the disorder, according to their different ionic radii.
The substitution of Sr2+ with aliovalent K+ and Na+ induces the formation of electron holes in the electronic structure of STO, which implies p-type electronic conductivity. Such holes play a fundamental role in the electronic stabilization of the oxygen vacancies, since they are able to compensate for the spare electrons left in the lattice by the vacancy formation process. Furthermore, we showed that the higher the doping fraction, the more delocalized this excess charge is over the lattice, rather than being confined over the two titanium atoms adjacent to the vacancy site. Similar charge rearrangement has been found to be at the basis of the MIEC properties in LSF, LSCF and other relevant perovskite oxides.21 As a result, the formation of oxygen vacancies in alkali-doped STO is strongly favored, and the energy associated with this process decreases up to a few tenths of eV.
Our findings suggest that K-doped and Na-doped STO are new materials with interesting electronic properties for application as cathode components in oxide-conducting SOFCs. Other crucial features, such as oxide migration properties, should be further investigated in order to validate their applicability either by themselves, or as substrates for the epitaxial growth of nanostructured electrodes.
