We report here a facile photochemical method based on laser interference etching for fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) gratings and quasi-hexagonal photonic patterns on GaAs wafers. The periods of the patterns can be adjusted by tuning the incident angles without any significant change of the optical alignment. We find that the optical reflectivity of the etched samples is greatly reduced, especially for samples after three-beam interference etching with the minimum average reflectance of less than 2%, which can be easily adopted for fabricating anti-reflection layer of solar cells. Photoluminescence (PL) study shows that slightly blue shifted PL peaks can be observed due to quantum confinement effect.
1 Introduction
Developing micro/nanofabrication technologies, understanding the structure–function relationship, and engineering artificial patterns on semiconductors constitute a promising research domain in material science and engineering. Patterns on semiconductors laid the foundation for numerous applications in areas ranging from photovoltaics, photoelectronics to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),1–5 often leading to devices with greatly improved performance. For example, carefully designed patterns fabricated on solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors can greatly increase the energy conversion efficiencies.6–9 Over the past decades, many innovative techniques have been developed to fabricate patterns on semiconductors. They usually involve employment of photon,10 electron,11 or ion beams,12 to modify surface structures of pre-defined positions, followed by chemical etching to produce patterns. However, each of these techniques has certain limitations and usually involves expensive facilities and complex control processes. In comparison, laser interference lithography (LIL) is a maskless technique and is considered as a low cost and facile alternative for fabrication of patterns with application in tribology (wear and friction reduction), grating, and photonic crystals. However, current LIL techniques either rely on photothermal damage induced by high power pulsed lasers, or require usage of photoresist to produce patterns.
GaAs, a direct band gap semiconductor (Eg ∼ 1.42 eV), is prominently known for its high electron mobility, high saturated electron velocity, and excellent optoelectronic properties.13 GaAs has a wide variety of applications in microwave integrated circuits, infrared light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, solar cells and photodetectors.14–16 Herein, we present a photochemical laser interference etching method with two and three coherent light beams for fabricating 2D grating structures and quasi hexagonal structure on GaAs wafers. Our results show that the patterned GaAs wafers exhibit a greatly enhanced optical absorption efficiency and a prominent blue shift of the bandgap photoluminescence (PL) emission peak.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials
The wafers used in this study were Si-doped (100) n-GaAs single crystals with a doping level of 3–4 × l017 cm−3 (MTI KJ Group, Hefei, China), cut into 5 × 5 × 0.5 mm3. Acetone (CH3COCH3) and ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH) were of analytical reagent grade. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experiments. The GaAs wafers were ultrasonically cleaned in sequence with acetone, anhydrous ethanol, and DI water, each for 10 min. The wafers were then dipped into concentrated HCl solution for 2 min to remove native oxides, followed by a dip in DI water for another 2 min, and then blowing dried by using N2 flow. The cleaned wafers were used within an hour to avoid re-oxidation. After photochemical lithography, the samples was then rinsed with DI water and purged with N2 flow again.
2.2 Multibeam interference
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the optical apparatus used to generate laser interference patterns. A power tunable laser beam (532 nm) was first expanded by a beam expander, brought through an aperture to fix the spot size, and split into two or three beams by using beam-splitter cube. The beams travelled through different optical paths, and then were reflected by mirrors onto GaAs wafer immersed into a flat-bottomed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) container filled with the etchant, a mixture of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with a 3:1:30 molar ratio of HF:H2O2:H2O. The laser power density was maintained at 180 mW cm−2 and the etching time was 10 min.

(d) Scheme diagram of the optical paths for the incident laser beams. Ψ, θi and θr denote the azimuth angle, the incident angle and the refracting angle, respectively. 
The laser source is a Gaussian beam in TEM00 mode. For simplicity, it is treated as a plane wave in the theoretical analysis. Considering a general case for N-beam laser interference, the electric field vector can be expressed as: 
n(n, t) = 0nei(n·n−ωt+φ)
(1)where 0n is the amplitude and polarization direction, n is the wave vector, n is the position vector, ω is the angular frequency, φ is the initial phase, and n = 1, 2, 3, …, N, respectively. The intensity distribution in the superposition area of N interfering beams is represented as: 
(2)
If the amplitude, initial phase and polarization of the incident beams are the same, the interference pattern is determined by the number of beams, laser wavelengths and incident angles. Since the wavelength of the laser in a practical interference system is fixed, the number of beams and the incident angles are the crucial factors, which can be tuned to change the geometry and the period of the interference patterns.
For a two-beam interference configuration in air with symmetric incident angles with respect to the surface normal (z axis), the relationship between the grating period (Λ), the laser wavelength (λ), the refractive index (ni), and the incident beam angle (θi), is given by17 
Λ = λ/(2nisinθi)
(3)
For the case in solution, the laser beam will be refracted when it enters into the solution. The grating period can be expressed as 
Λ = (λ/nr)/(2nrsinθr) = λ/(2nrsinθi)
(4)where θr and nr are the refractive angle and the refractive index in the solution, respectively. Similarly, for a symmetric three-beam configuration in air, the period is given by18 
Λ = 2λ/(3nisinθi)
(5)
For the case in solution, the relationship is given by 
Λ = (2λ/nr)/(3nrsinθr) = 2λ/(3nrsinθi)

2.3 Characterization
Surface analysis of the etched GaAs wafers were carried out by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Dimension Icon). The reflectance was measured by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV1901PC, Shanghai, China). The PL spectra were recorded at room temperature by using a thermo-electric cooled fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048TEC, Avantes, Netherlands) along with a 405 nm laser as the excitation source. The spot size of the laser beam was ∼200 μm2, the excitation power was ∼30 mW, and the integration time was 1 s.
3 Results and discussion
We believe that the underlying principles for photochemical etching of GaAs contain a sequence of five steps: (1) transport of the reactants to the surface, (2) adsorption of the reactants, (3) reaction at the interface, (4) desorption of reaction products, (5) removal of reaction products away from the surface.19 Upon laser irradiation, photons of sufficient energy (λ = 532 nm) can excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band to form electron–hole (e−–h+) pairs. At the GaAs–etchant interface, the electrons are captured by hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen ions in the etchant. The holes in the valence band will oxidize the surface atoms of GaAs, which are then chemically dissolved into solution since they are thermodynamically instable in the acidic environment. The total corrosion reaction occurred at the GaAs–solution interface is considered as below: 
GaAs + 2H2O2 + 3HF → GaF3 + H3AsO4 + 2H2↑

We designated a dual-beam and a three-beam configuration to validate the multi-beam interference etching method. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the samples (abbreviated thereafter as D17 and D31, respectively) after photochemical etching under two-beam interference irradiation with incident angles of 17° and 31°, respectively. It is evident that 2D gratings with intervals of 667 nm and 409 nm have been formed on GaAs, in good agreement with the calculated periods by using eqn (3) (684 nm and 388 nm for D17 and D31, respectively). Note that small fluctuations can be frequently observed along the stripe, due possibly to vibrations induced by the formation of hydrogen. Fig. 2c and d show the SEM images of the samples (abbreviated thereafter as T17 and T31, respectively) under three-beam irradiation with the same incident angles. The images are characterized by quasi-hexagonal symmetry, with periods of 848 nm and 472 nm, respectively, which also agree well with the calculated values by using eqn (4) (909 and 518 nm for T17 and T31, respectively). A comparison of the theoretical and experimental values is listed in Table 1. The deviations are mostly likely to arise from experimental uncertainties associated with determination of the azimuthal and incident angles of the laser beams. It is interesting to find a secondary periodic structure formed perpendicular to the main interference pattern with a period almost twice of the main interference fringes (marked by Λ′ in Fig. 2a and b). The possible reason may be ascribed to corrosion caused by the superposition of grating diffraction.

The surface morphologies of etched samples were also studied by AFM, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. It is evident that the interference texture was uniformly formed on GaAs after interference etching. Fig. 3e–h show the corresponding profiles along the lines marked in the upper images. All the four samples exhibit an average peak-to-peak etching depth of ∼100 nm. Two grating structures parallel and perpendicular to the direction of interference can be visualized, in consistent with the SEM observations shown in Fig. 2a and b.

As GaAs is a prominent semiconductor with extensive applications in optoelectronics, we further study the optical properties of the etched samples. Fig. 4a shows the optical reflectance spectra of the etched samples, and the original blank GaAs. The reflectance of the blank GaAs agrees with results reported in the literature,20,21 characterized by four sharp peaks located at ∼246 nm, ∼396 nm, ∼427 nm and ∼828 nm, which can be assigned to interband electron transitions near the χ point (E2), along the Λ direction (E1 + Δ1, E1) and near the Γ point (E0) of the Brillouin zone (BZ), respectively.22 The reflectances of the etched samples are all lower than that of the blank sample in the whole spectrum range due to absorption and scattering originated from the interference patterns. The average reflectances for T17 and T31 (∼5% and 2%, respectively) are much lower than that of D17 and D31 (∼23% and 17%), which is determined by the finer levels of surface structures.23 GaAs wafers with quasi-hexagonal patterns are more effective to reduce the reflectance than that with grating structures. Note that the reflectances in the UV region for all the samples are greatly reduced due to enhanced Rayleigh scattering at shorter wavelengths.
 Fig. 4  (a) Optical reflectance spectra of the blank and the etched samples obtained under normal incidence; (b) PL spectra of the blank and etched samples measured at room temperature upon excitation by a 405 nm semiconductor laser. 
Fig. 4b shows the room temperature PL spectra for all samples. The blank GaAs shows the band-edge PL emission located at ∼869 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼22 nm. After interference etching, all the samples exhibit a significant blue shift of the PL emission. A consistent explanation for the observation is quantum confinement effect, which is proportion to the degree of electron confinement.24 Note that all the etched GaAs exhibit broader bandwidths (FWHMs ∼ 70 nm) than that of the blank GaAs due possibly to the combined effects associated with surface states and electron confinement.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated 2D grating structures and quasi-hexagonal structures on GaAs wafers via laser interference photochemical etching. The etched GaAs wafers exhibit greatly reduced reflectances and blue shifted PL emission due possibly to quantum confinement effect. In particular, the optical reflectance for the sample after three-beam laser interference etching exhibit a greatly reduced reflectance less than 2%. This method is facile and cost efficient with tremendous potentials on a variety of optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and photodetectors.
