    , Accepted 22nd August 2014First published on 22nd August 2014AbstractWe report simultaneous photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) glucose sensing and biohydrogen generation for the first time from the direct PEC oxidation of glucose at multifunctional and robust Cu2O–TiO2 photocatalysts. Striking improvement of 30% in overall H2 gas evolution (∼122 μmol h−1 cm−2) by photoholes assisted glucose oxidation opens a new platform in solar-driven PEC biohydrogen generation.
Light driven photosensitized water oxidation phenomenon1 is the key tool for accessing photoholes at the valence band of a semiconductor to advanced oxidation of chemical components in the liquid or gas phase.2–4 In this context, direct photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) oxidation of glucose using a semiconductor is an interesting approach to reforming the biomass into hydrogen fuel through an artificial photosynthesis process.5–9 Previous reports on Pt decorated TiO2 in the form of powder10 as well as an electrode11 demonstrated the ability of “photoholes” towards glucose oxidation for generating useful fuel such as hydrogen and oxygen. Although metal (Pt) particles facilitate charge separation at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, (a) the light blocking effect by Pt, (b) undesirable CO2 generation through the photo-Kolbe reaction that leads to poor selectivity in H2 generation and (c) inadequate photoholes conduction at TiO2 limits their practical implementation. Conversely, p-type semiconductors are promising candidates in the PEC water splitting process for efficiently collecting photoholes to the Pt counter electrode. Nonetheless, developing a robust p-type semiconductor photoelectrode is currently a key challenge in the field of PEC biosensors and biofuel generation. In this context, cuprous oxide (Cu2O), a p-type metal oxide with a band gap of ∼2–2.6 eV is currently being extensively studied in photocatalyst, solar cell, and photosensor applications.12–15 In addition to their good photoactivity, high binding energy, affordability and abundant occurrence, their photocorrosive tendency due to high native Cu vacancies16,17 remains a significant drawback. Thus, it is significant to improve Cu2O stability for efficient biomolecular oxidation. Recently, it has been reported that Cu2O photocathode stability can be improved by post coating thin layers of metal oxide (TiO2),18,19 or carbon materials,13 which may improve the PEC performance. Therefore, electron conducting and transparent coatings of TiO2 is an appropriate choice due to the negligible obstruction of light reaching the photoactive Cu2O layer.20 In addition, the presence of TiO2 layer on Cu2O could also facilitate charge separation and electron transfer at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Therefore, a synergistic combination between single-oxide properties, such as low band-gap p-type Cu2O and high reactivity of n-type TiO2, could be the most appealing alternative for improving the PEC efficiency.21
Glucose plays a vital role as a biomarker in the clinical therapy of diabetes.22 The recent substantial development of sensing technologies suggests the use of enzymes or noble metal catalysts for the successful oxidation of biomolecules;23,24 however, stability and price remain intrinsic restrictions.25 Moreover, glucose is a well-recognised biofuel source that is low cost, renewable and is available as waste products of biomass processing industries (sugar, pulp and paper), which makes it an attractive sustainable source of biohydrogen.26 Despite the considerable progress achieved in hydrogen production from biomass over the past decades, there still remain significant challenges in designing efficient, enzymeless and cost-effective methods for producing hydrogen at exceptionally mild conditions.
Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the simultaneous photoelectrochemical glucose biosensing and biohydrogen generation from the direct PEC oxidation of glucose at highly stable and sensitive Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes. The PEC process of simultaneous glucose oxidation at Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes and biohydrogen generation at Pt counter is proposed in Scheme 1. Under dark conditions, Cu2O acts primarily as an electrocatalyst toward glucose oxidation at applied potential (0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl). This potential is substantial to achieve a flat band at Cu2O/TiO2/electrolyte interfaces and is capable of collecting oxidative electrons (dotted arrow in Scheme 1) to the collector terminal through Cu2O and TiO2 layers. Upon light illumination with similar applied potential, Cu2O acts as a photoelectrocatalyst, which generates photoelectrons at the conduction band (CB) and photoholes at the valence band (VB). The photoholes from VB lying just positive of the oxygen evolution potential (+1.23 eV NHE) substantially drives the glucose oxidation. This photocatalytic glucose oxidation beneficially promotes the oxidative electrons (dotted arrow in Fig. 1(a)). Concurrently, a fraction of the photoelectrons will be injected into the collector terminal, thus increasing the overall biohydrogen evolution (biofuel) at the Pt counter electrode.

The Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes used in this study were prepared by forming a CuO layer on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate using a spray pyrolysis process followed by sputter coating of a thin layer of TiO2 (see ESI,† S1). The crystalline structure of the as-prepared CuO films was studied using X-ray diffraction technique (Fig. 1(a)). Two predominant peaks shown in Fig. 1(a) at 35.3° and 38.4°, confirm the (002) and (111) crystallite phases, respectively, corresponding to the tenorite structure CuO (JCPDS 45-0937).27,28
The surface morphology of CuO films shows a quasi crystallite shape (Fig. 1(b)). Further, this quasi crystallite texture was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1(c)). From AFM section analysis, it is found that CuO crystals have a distinct dimension of ∼492 nm in diameter and ∼395 nm in height. The chemical environment of CuO films before and after TiO2 coating was studied by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 2(a) and (b). In pristine CuO films, predominant Cu2p3/2 (933.2 eV) and Cu2p1/2 (953.2 eV) peaks along with two strong satellite (SS) peaks were observed. These Cu2p strong satellite peaks at 949.1 eV and 961.9 eV correspond to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively.29

Furthermore, the atomic ratio of Cu and O was estimated from XPS spectra and was found to be 0.3 and 0.7 wt%, respectively. The shoulder peaks of Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 were shifted to lower binding energy, implying that the CuO surface was modified by TiO2 post-deposition. Moreover, the SS peaks of CuO disappeared upon TiO2 post-deposition. This tendency indicates the Cu2O phase formation (Cu2+ to Cu+ ions) between TiO2 and CuO.30,31 It is reported that the CuO phase transformation might occur either from chemical state interactions at two different oxide phase interfaces32 or by applying oxidation treatment on the CuO surface.31 The plausible reason for Cu2O phase formation might originate from the oxygen species during the TiO2 sputtering process possibly interacting with the CuO surface and forming a thin layer of Cu2O between CuO and TiO2 (this thin Cu2O layer was not observed from XRD spectra). Under this circumstance, the half-filled d9 configuration in the ground state of CuO might get filled by oxygen species during sputter deposition. Therefore, the screening of charge transfer into the d-states results in the disappearance of SS peaks at the CuO–TiO2 electrode, which is in agreement with a previous report.33 The O1s peak of CuO film (Fig. 2(d)) was deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.8 eV and 531.2 eV, which represents the CuO and intrinsic oxygen defects in the crystal lattice, respectively.34 The presence of TiO2 on the CuO layer was confirmed by the presence of a Ti2p and an O1s peak from the TiO2 coated CuO sample (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Consequently, the TiO2 post-deposition switched the hydrophobic nature of the CuO films (contact angle ∼132.8°) into hydrophilic (contact angle ∼76.7°) surface (see ESI,† Fig. S2). From the abovementioned discussion, it can be concluded that the Cu2O layer may form between the CuO and TiO2. Hereafter, TiO2-coated CuO electrodes will be coined as Cu2O–TiO2.
The electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) response of CuO and Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes in the presence and absence of glucose were examined using cyclic voltammetry, and are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The aqueous solution of 0.1 M NaOH was used as the electrolyte, and the experiments were conducted at a 50 mV s−1 scan rate. In the absence of glucose, the CuO electrode showed dark current density of ∼1.6 mA cm−2 at a negative applied potential of −0.55 V vs. (Ag/AgCl). Upon light illumination, the photocurrent density value was enhanced to ∼3.7 mA cm−2. This explains the complete photoelectrocatalytic water splitting on the CuO surface (using photoelectrons at CB) and water oxidation at the Pt surface by collecting the photoholes from the VB of CuO. This ensures the photoelectron and photohole generation at CuO under illumination with negative potential.35 On the other hand, the current density showed that ∼1.6 mA cm−2 at the positive applied potential 0.7 V vs. (Ag/AgCl) is related to hydrogen generation on the Pt surface, as explained in Scheme 1. Strikingly, the current density was enhanced to ∼7.9 mA cm−2 (dark condition) in the presence of 5 mM glucose in electrolyte. This infers that the electro-oxidation of glucose occurs at the CuO surface at 0.7 V vs. (Ag/AgCl), where glucose is converted into gluconic acid.36 This process exhibits one electron to the external circuit (dotted arrow in Scheme 1) and thus increase current nearly fivefold compared to electrolyte without glucose. However, no change in current density was observed under light illumination. This may be due to poor charge separation (electron and hole) after photocarrier generation due to photocorrosion on CuO surface because the redox potentials for the reduction and oxidation of copper oxide lie within the bandgap.18 CuO + H2O + 2e− ↔ 2Cu + 2OH− (E° = +0.47 V)(1)
Therefore, photoholes at VB of CuO are inefficient to drive the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose due to a detrimental corrosive effect (eqn (1)). Unlike pristine CuO, the Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrode exhibited significant (Fig. 3(b)) current density difference between dark (∼3.6 mA cm−2) and light (∼4.6 mA cm−2) illumination conditions in 5 mM glucose, which clearly demonstrates that TiO2 deposition on CuO triggers the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose (dotted arrow indicated in Scheme 1). Here, TiO2 acts as a passivation layer and prevents corrosion. Another plausible reason for enhancing current density could be the resultant band-gap energy tailoring from ∼2.2 eV to ∼1.82 eV (see ESI,† S3), which could maximize the visible light harvesting photons for the photocatalytic glucose oxidation process by converting their crystalline phase to Cu2O, as explained by the XPS results (Fig. 1(c)).

To realize the stability of electrodes, we performed the electrocatalytic experiments using CuO and Cu2O–TiO2 electrodes in both dark and light illumination conditions (Fig. 3(c)). The Cu2O–TiO2 electrode showed excellent stability and reliable performance in both dark and light conditions. Initially, the CuO electrode showed higher current density than that of Cu2O–TiO2 but later it was found to be degrading rapidly and almost no current was generated after 2000 s. This is a clear evidence that the TiO2 post-deposition acts as a passivation layer to CuO and thus prevents the corrosion and affords prolonged operation in both dark and light illumination environments. The stable performance and photocurrent enhancement observed at Cu2O–TiO2 electrodes in the presence of glucose further encouraged us to examine the PEC sensing ability at different glucose concentrations. Fig. 3(d) shows the dependence of photocurrent on glucose concentration. The inset shows the typical time-based photocurrent response of a direct PEC glucose biosensor at lower and higher glucose concentrations. The calibration curve shows a linear increase in photocurrent between 375 μM to 1.5 mM glucose that reaches saturation at about 2.5 mM glucose. This wide linear range with a 250 μM detection limit confirms the direct PEC glucose sensing ability of Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes. The interference analysis shows negligible impact in the presence of ascorbic acid and dopamine, and thus demonstrates the selective photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose at robust Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes (see ESI,† Fig. S4). The photocurrent conversion efficiency (PCE) of Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrode was estimated from Fig. 3(b) using the following relation;37 PCE = [(1.23 − Vbias)I/(PA)] × 100(2)where Vbias is applied potential between the counter electrode and photoanode, and is calculated using the relation ERHE = EAg/Agcl + 0.197 + pH(0.059). The pH of the 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte is 11. I is the current density achieved from the PEC process. P is the power of the light source (100 mW cm−2). A is the area of the electrode (1 cm2). The estimated PCE is presented in Fig. 4. The maximum PCE of water oxidation performance in Cu2O–TiO2 was achieved at ∼0.8% at ∼0.85 V RHE (in the absence of glucose). At high applied potential of ∼1.23 V RHE, the PCE value is found to reduce to ∼0.05% because most of the water molecules were oxidized at the lower potential of ∼0.85 V, even though Cu2O–TiO2 can have wide window potential. In the case of glucose included electrolyte, at similar potential ∼1.23 V RHE, the PCE of ∼0.35% was achieved compared to glucose-free electrolyte. This implies that the Cu2O–TiO2 electrode has a feasibility of direct glucose oxidation at ∼1.23 V RHE and promotes overall hydrogen generation at Pt CE by supplying additional electrons to the circuit.

The feasible PEC current generation from glucose-based electrolyte (Fig. 3(c) and (d)) indicates possible fuel generation. As explained in Fig. 1(a), the electrons collected from both the electro-oxidation of glucose and the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose can be traversed to the Pt electrode and can be utilized for biohydrogen generation. This phenomenon was confirmed by the three electrode photoelectrochemical system. The output gas evolved for a period of one hour from both EC and PEC glucose oxidation on Cu2O–TiO2 electrodes was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (Fig. 5(a)). The GC spectra show a well-defined peak of H2, and peak intensity was enhanced upon light illumination. Our results indicate that the H2 fuel generation from electrocatalytic glucose oxidation was further promoted with photocatalytic glucose oxidation. The other two peaks in Fig. 5(a) correspond to atmospheric O2 and N2 during the sample collection. Furthermore, the quantity of H2 fuel evolved from Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes under different experimental conditions was estimated from GC spectra and is presented in Fig. 5(b). The Cu2O–TiO2 electrodes exhibit a small quantity of H2 (∼16 μmol h−1 cm−2) gas from direct water splitting phenomena (without glucose). In the presence of 2.5 mM glucose in the electrolyte, ∼96 μmol h−1 cm−2 of H2 fuel was generated at Pt in the dark, which could be attributed to the direct electrochemical glucose oxidation. Interestingly, the PEC oxidation of glucose generated the maximum quantity of H2 gas, ∼122 μmol h−1 cm−2. This clearly demonstrates that the photoholes generated at the valence band of Cu2O additionally drives glucose oxidation, which beneficially traverses more electrons to the external circuit (Scheme 1) and promotes the overall H2 fuel generation by ∼30%. The contribution of photocatalysis on glucose oxidation using a Cu2O/TiO2 electrode is in agreement with a recent demonstration of suspended photocatalytic glucose reformation using a different crystal facet of Cu2O.15 A similar hydrogen generation performance from glucose biofuel cells was summarized by Lu et al.38 The yield of hydrogen product can be doubled from the PEC glucose oxidation process while using tandem photoelectrodes. Esposito et al. demonstrated the tandem electrode based glucose biofuel cell using a WO3 and CdTe photoanode with a tungsten carbide (WC) photocathode.39 Utilizing cocatalyst (Ni(OH)2) materials on the anode surface (TiO2, Fe2O3) to reduce driving potential is another attractive strategy for improving glucose biofuel cells.40,41

Despite all the evidence for a substantial amount of biohydrogen generation, the Cu2O–TiO2 system still demands further excellence in terms of detection range as well its stability in industrial biomass waste. Further research is undergoing to improve their detection range via enhancing the physical active area or internal surface area of Cu2O–TiO2 electrodes. Moreover, analysing the stability of Cu2O–TiO2 electrodes using industrial biomass waste as feed stock is futuristic for realizing artificial photosynthesis in biohydrogen generation. When compared to the conventional biomass reformation techniques (steam gasification, fast pyrolysis or supercritical conversion), which demand high temperature, undoubtedly, the direct photoelectrocatalytic glucose oxidation using visible light candidates afford low-cost biomass reformation. The central part of the results on glucose sensing with hydrogen generation can be transformed to designing self-powered sensors using the output hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen in the form of fuel cells.
In conclusion, we have developed multifunctional and highly stable Cu2O–TiO2 photoelectrodes for the direct photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. This material combination allows the spontaneous direct PEC oxidation of glucose under light illumination, in which photoholes are utilized for enhanced glucose oxidation. The high magnitude photocurrent of ∼4.6 mA cm−2 was generated in the presence of 5 mM glucose. Moreover, simultaneous biohydrogen generation from the direct PEC oxidation of glucose was demonstrated, which can serve either as an excellent alternative technique in biomass reformation or self-powered biosensors using the output hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen in the form of fuel cells.
