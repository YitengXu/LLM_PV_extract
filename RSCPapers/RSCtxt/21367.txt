    , Accepted 31st August 2012First published on 31st August 2012AbstractWe report a facile, template-free and nontoxic one-pot solvothermal route for synthesizing submicrometer-sized yolk@shell hierarchical spheres, which possess a permeable shell self-assembled by ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets (NSs) with nearly 90% of exposed {001} facets and mesoporous inner sphere with a high specific surface area. Compared to the {001} faceted TiO2 NSs and standard Degussa P25, the anatase TiO2 yolk@shell hierarchical spheres (TiO2 YSHSs) were obtained with surface area up to 245.1 m2 g−1 and their submicrometer scale simultaneously promoted light scattering in the visible region. A light to electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 6.01% was achieved for the DSSCs with TiO2 YSHSs as its photoanode, under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, indicating 49.9% and 34.8% increases compared to the DSSCs with TiO2 NSs (4.01%) and the standard Degussa P25 (4.46%) as photoanodes, respectively. The enhancement can be mainly attributed to the higher dye loading on TiO2 YSHSs (4.35 × 10−5 mol cm−2) than that of TiO2 NSs (3.14 × 10−5 mol cm−2) and P25 (3.32 × 10−5 mol cm−2); longer lifetime of the injected electrons in TiO2 YSHSs film (65.79 ms) than that of in TiO2 NSs film (57.90 ms); and the good capability of light scattering of TiO2 YSHSs in visible light region, which are confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometer and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The growth mechanism of the TiO2 YSHSs has also been investigated in detail.
1. Introduction
Since the first report of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, DSSCs have attracted extensive research interest for their ease of fabrication, theoretical high efficiency and low manufacturing cost compared with silicon-based photovoltaic devices.1–3 So far, the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs has broken through 12% under 1 sun of illumination as reported by Yella et al. with a specially designed redox mediator containing cobalt (Co) complexes and zinc porphyrin dye as sensitizer.4 Besides the presentation of new sensitizing dyes and redox couples for DSSCs, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of more efficient photoanode materials including a wide range of TiO2 nanoparticles with desirable shape, structure and crystallinity.5–12
Typically, the most available anatase TiO2 nanoparticles used in photoanodes are dominated by the thermodynamically stable {101} facets (more than 94%, according to the Wulff construction).13–15 In 2008, on the basis of theoretical predictions, Yang et al. firstly synthesized micrometer-sized anatase single crystals with 47% of the highly reactive {001} facets by using hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a capping agent under hydrothermal conditions.15 Following this breakthrough, extensive effort has been made in synthesis, characterization, and application of these anatase TiO2 with {001} facets.16–18 According to the theoretical structures, all of the Ti atoms on ideal {001} facets are five-fold-coordinated (5c) and only half of the Ti atoms on {101} facets are not fully coordinated. The comparatively greater dye molecules adsorption is thus expected to occur on {001} facets, which is also supported by theoretical and experimental results.19–21 Moreover, the band edges of anatase TiO2 {001} facets are more negative than {101} facets.22 However, to the best of our knowledge, most of these anatase TiO2 exposed by {001} facets used in DSSCs are 2D sheetlike nanocrystals or microspheres closely packed by micro/submicro-sized anatase TiO2 nanosheets (TiO2 NSs).20,23–26 Due to the layer-by-layer stacking of anatase TiO2 NSs and the large size of the packed TiO2 NSs, the specific surface areas of photoanode films composed of these anatase TiO2 are comparatively lower than those TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs), which may to some extent inhibit the performance of DSSCs.19,27
It is now well-accepted that a high-efficiency photoanode for DSSCs requires not only a high surface area for dye molecule loading but also a good capability for light scattering for enhancing the light-harvesting. Among various morphologies for TiO2 nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotube and nanosheets,5–8,25 hollow structures and mesoporous beads have a low density, high surface area and efficient light scattering and may be applied as multifunctional photoanode materials in DSSCs.9–11 Recently, “yolk@shell” nanostructures or so-called “rattle-type” nanomaterials are emerging as an interesting new member of the family of hollow nanoarchitectures.28–30 The unique physical properties of yolk@shell nanostructures make them attractive materials in applications in optical, electronic, magnetic, catalytic, and sensing devices.30–32 More importantly, the void space as well as shells and inner yolks in the yolk@shell nanostructure could be easily altered alongside numerous synthetic methods including the bottom-up, soft templating or selective etching approaches, etc.28–34 However, the application of this kind of hierarchical architectures in DSSCs is up to date extremely sparse.33 For this reason, it is a great opportunity to design and synthesize a multifunctional photoanode material on the base of yolk@shell nanostructures.
Herein, we report a facile, template-free and nontoxic one-pot solvothermal route for synthesizing submicrometer-sized yolk@shell hierarchical spheres, which possess a permeable shell self-assembled by ultrathin anatase TiO2 NSs with nearly 90% exposed {001} facets and mesoporous inner sphere with a high specific surface area. Compared to the {001} faceted TiO2 NSs and standard Degussa P25, the anatase TiO2 yolk@shell hierarchical spheres (TiO2 YSHSs) were obtained with surface area up to 245.1 m2 g−1 and their submicrometer scale simultaneously promoted light scattering in visible region. As a result, overall light conversion efficiency (η) of 6.01% has been achieved, indicating 49.9% and 34.8% increases compared to the TiO2 NSs (4.01%) and the standard Degussa P25 (4.46%) photoanodes, respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials synthesis
(a) The anatase TiO2 YSHSs were synthesized with a modification to the previous report.35 In a typical synthesis, 0.03–0.05 mL of diethylenetriamine (DETA; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 40 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA; 99.5%, Sinopharm) in a Teflon-lined autoclave (90 mL in volume) and the resulting mixture was stirred constantly for 5 min. Then, 1.5 mL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIP; 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the above mixture under vigorous stirring for another 10 min. It should be emphasized that the final stir procedure is essential in successful formation of the desired structure. After the reaction at 200 °C for 24 h in an electric oven, light yellow precipitate was harvested via centrifugation, washed with ethanol three times, and dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the TiO2 YSHSs was calcined at 400 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in air atmosphere to obtain a highly crystalline anatase phase.
(b) Anatase TiO2 NSs were prepared by a hydrothermal method as reported previously.36,46 Briefly, 5 mL of TIP and 0.6 mL of HF (48 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in a Teflon-lined 50 mL autoclave at room temperature, and then kept at 180 °C for 24 h. After hydrothermal reaction, white precipitates were collected and washed with 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, deionized water and ethanol for several times to cleaning the adsorbed fluorine ions, and finally dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight.
2.2 Fabrication of DSSCs
For preparation of the TiO2 photoanodes with TiO2 YSHSs, TiO2 NSs and P25, the viscous pastes were prepared by the following procedure. 0.5 g of the above samples were first dispersed into a mixture of 15 mL ethanol, 2.03 mL terpinol (mixture of isomer, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.26 g ethyl cellulose (#46070, Sigma-Aldrich) and ultrasonicated for 30 min. The solvent was then evaporated at 45 °C to obtain the viscous paste. The prepared TiO2 pastes were spread uniformly on the surface of the FTO glasses using the screen-printing technique and gradually heated in air at 325 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 photoanodes were soaked into 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in a mixture of acetonitrile (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) and tert-butyl alcohol (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) (volume ratio, 1:1) for 24 h at room temperature and then washed with ethanol and dried in air. The average thickness of the obtained TiO2 nanoporous films was about 10 μm. Subsequently, the dye-covered TiO2 photoanode and a thermal decomposition Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (DuPont). The size of the TiO2 film used was 0.25 cm2 (5 mm × 5 mm). A drop of the redox electrolyte (0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15)) was introduced via vacuum back-filling.
2.3 Characterizations
The crystal structure was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100F) were used to examine the structure of the samples. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were determined by an ASAP 2010 nitrogen sorption isotherm apparatus. The amount of adsorbed dye was measured by desorbing the dye into 0.1 mM NaOH solution and by absorption measurement of the solution using the adsorption peak intensity of N719 at 530 nm by using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs were performed under one sun condition using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). I–V curve were measured and recorded by a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter by applying an external bias to the cells. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) test system was consisted of a model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifer and model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, U.S.A.), a 7IL/PX 150 xenon lamp and power supply, and a 7ISW301 spectrometer. The EIS measurements were carried out with an impedance analyzer (Parstat 2273, Princeton) in darkness at the open-circuit voltage and 10 mV of amplitude over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. The diffuse-reflectance spectra were measured by using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 indicates the unique yolk@shell hierarchical structures of the calcined TiO2 YSHSs (see the Experimental section). As can be seen from the FESEM images in Fig. 1a, a number of perfect TiO2 YSHSs with the size ranging from 1–1.5 μm are evenly distributed. As shown in the high magnification micrographs (Fig. 1b), the closely packed nanosheets (NSs) are clearly visible and randomly assemble on the surfaces of microspheres. From the cross-section of the cracked microspheres (Fig. 1c), the hierarchically structured outer spherical shell with a thickness of approximately 200 nm can be visualized to consist of constituent ultrathin NSs. Compared to the shell, the inner sphere with a diameter of about 650 nm has a much more smooth surface due to the closely accumulation of tiny TiO2 nanocrystals. As mentioned above, the two kinds of hierarchical structures of shell and yolk may enormously enlarge the surface area of TiO2 film and thereby enhance dye absorption and injection efficiency of photoexcited electrons into semiconductors. In addition, it is expected that the multilayered hollow-sphere structure should produce a multireflection of incident light in-between the hierarchical hollow spheres, so as to improve the efficiency of light harvesting. As shown in Fig. 1d, the crystallographic structures of the TiO2 YSHSs have been confirmed by powder XRD to be the tetragonal anatase phase (JCPDS card no. 21 1272; space group I41/amd; a0 = 3.7852 Å, c0 = 9.5139 Å).

The detailed microstructures of the TiO2 YSHSs were further investigated by TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2). The gradual contrast of the TEM image (Fig. 2a) from the edge to the center of the sphere indicates that the entire sphere is indeed composed of a yolk–shell structure. As shown in Fig. 2b, it is reconfirmed that the self-organized NSs formed the shell of the sphere in a random orientations. Compared to the rectangular TiO2 NSs obtained under HF-mediated conditions (Fig. S1†), the NSs on shell show a larger average size of about 150 nm and a thinner thickness ranging from 4 nm to 7 nm (Fig. 2c). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a single NS on shell (Fig. 2d, inset) demonstrates a typical top-view indicative of {001} facets on anatase TiO2.16,17 It can be observed that sets of the lattices oriented perpendicular to each other with an equal fringe spacing of 0.19 nm are in good agreement with the (200) and (020) planes of anatase TiO2. The visible lattice fringes on other area of the NS also reveal a distance of 0.19 nm (Fig. 2d). Therefore, it can be concluded that the NSs on shell are all single crystals and are bounded by {001} facets on both the top and bottom. On the basis of the above TEM and HRTEM results, we can roughly calculate the percentage of exposed {001} facets on the NSs and typical TiO2 NSs obtained by using HF capping agent. The percentage of exposed {001} facets on shell NSs is about 87% which is a little bit higher than that of TiO2 NSs synthesized in HF solution (75%). The crystal structures of the inner spheres were also investigated from a crashed TiO2 YSHS (Fig. 2e and f). Lattice images are clearly observed, indicating the inner sphere composed of tiny TiO2 beads with diameters of about 10 nm have high crystallinity despite the closely random aggregation. The HRTEM image shown in Fig. 2f, allows the lattice fringes of the crystals to be correlated with the (101) plane of the anatase TiO2. This suggested that the shells and inner spheres of the TiO2 YSHSs are mainly exposed by different kinds of crystalline facets. The formation of this structure may result from a Ostwald ripening effect and the selective adsorption of diethylenetriamine (DETA) molecules on the specific crystalline surface of TiO2, which have influence on the structures and exposed facets of the hierarchical structures.29,35

To clarify the growth mechanism of the as-prepared products, time-dependant experiments were carried out to reveal the formation process of TiO2 YSHSs in more details (Fig. 3). In the initial reaction stage, solid spheres have formed due to the alcoholysis of Ti(O-iC3H7)4 shown in Fig. 3a. The diethylenetriamine (DETA) plays an important role in the alcoholysis of Ti(O-iC3H7)4, since no solid products can be collected even after solvothermal treatment of Ti(O-iC3H7)4 with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) alone for 2 h. The presence of IPA may control alcoholysis and polycondensation reaction and lead to an even distribution of the solid spheres (Fig. 3a and S2a†). The initial solid spheres show a poor crystalline quality (Fig. S3†). It is generally thought that the initial solid spheres have higher surface energies and are more easily redissolved. So as solvothermal reaction proceeds to 12 h, the solid spheres shrink over time and newly alcoholysed spike-like nanoparticles occur and then assemble around the solid spheres (Fig. 3b, S2c and d†) due to the Ostwald ripening process.34 The shell nanoparticles are not stable and will transfer from spike shape to sheet like structure with a prolonged ageing time (24 h). The tridentate DETA in the solvothermal system is hypothesized to play a key role in effectively stabilizing the emerging high-energy {001} facets and prohibiting the growth along [001] direction during ripening.35 The hydrogen bonds through the unreacted amino-groups on DETA which interconnect the alcoholysis products may be the another reason for the formation of a 2D sheet-like nanostructure.29 The shell of the yolk@shell spheres finally peels off from the surface of the yolk after 72 h of reaction (Fig. S2e and f†).

To obtain an insight into the hierarchical structure of the shells and the porous structure of the inner spheres, we determined the pore-size distribution and BET surface area of the TiO2 YSHSs using nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms (Fig. 4). The TiO2 NSs sample was also tested here as a benchmark. It was found that the BET surface area of the TiO2 YSHSs presents quite a high value, 245.1 m2 g−1, nearly two times that of TiO2 NSs (88.9 m2 g−1). The isotherms corresponding to the TiO2 YSHSs display the typical type IV curve according to the IUPAC classification, indicating a hysteresis loop at high relatively pressures associated with capillary condensation of gases within mesopores. The hysteresis loop is of type H2, which is consistent with pores with necks and wider bodies. The pore size distribution (Fig. 4b) calculated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm by the BJH method shows a wide range from 2 to 80 and distributions centred at with two salient peaks of 3 nm and 9 nm, respectively, which might be attributed to the different porous structures of yolk and shell.25,26,35 However, for the sample of TiO2 NSs, the shapes of the hysteresis loops change from type H2 to H3, demonstrating the presence of slit-like pores. The high absorption at high relative pressure (P/P0) in isotherms also indicates the formation of large mesopores and macropores. As reported earlier, the existing nanopores are from the aggregation of TiO2 NSs.26 The large BET surface area and mesopores structures of TiO2 YSHSs are thus believed to promote better transport of electrolyte and more adsorption of the dye molecules than TiO2 NSs.

In order to investigate the performance of TiO2 YSHSs as photoanodes for DSSCs, the TiO2 YSHSs photoanodes were tested under an illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 globe, 100 mW cm−2) and compared to the photoanodes made of TiO2 NSs and commercial TiO2 (P25). The DSSC is a very complicated system that requires electrodes to be similar in order to achieve a meaningful comparison. Thus, all electrodes for DSSCs tests were prepared by screen printing a thin TiO2 film on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and sintered in the same batch. The thickness of electrodes was controlled by the screen printing time, showing a similar value of about 10 μm. The characteristic current (I)–voltage (V) curves and IPCE spectra of these DSSCs are given in Fig. 5, and their detailed photovoltaic parameters derived from the I–V curves are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that both the open-circuit photovoltage of the TiO2 NSs (Voc = 790 mV) and TiO2 YSHSs (Voc = 760 mV) are comparatively higher than that obtained from the commercial P25 DSSCs (Voc = 733 mV). This is expectable because the flatband potential of the {001} facets was reported to be about 60 mV more negative than that of {101} facets and this leads to the increase of open-circuit photovoltage of TiO2 NSs and TiO2 YSHSs photoanodes.22 Such alterations in open circuit and shifts in the flat band potential along crystallographic orientation have also been observed before in some SnO2 based DSSCs.37,38 However, the slightly lower Voc value for TiO2 YSHSs than that for the TiO2 NSs sample implies that only the shells of TiO2 YSHSs are dominated by {001} facets, and the inner spheres are composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with lower exposure of {001} facets.

The distinct photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 YSHSs is largely due to its higher short-circuit current (Jsc = 13.1 mA cm−2) compared with TiO2 NSs (Jsc = 7.5 mA cm−2) and TiO2 P25 (Jsc = 10.2 mA cm−2). Moreover, as is given in Table 1, the sequences of Jsc values of these DSSCs are related to that of the eluted dye concentration from these TiO2 films. Therefore, this enhanced photocurrent could be attributed to better dye adsorption and light-harvesting efficiency, due to its extraordinarily high surface area and the special yolk@shell hollow spherical structure. However, due to the layer by layer stacking and oriental attachment of the TiO2 NSs, the adsorption capacity of N719 on TiO2 NSs is smaller than that on TiO2 P25, which leads to the lower Jsc value of TiO2 NSs than that of TiO2 P25. The overall photoconversion efficiency (η) of the TiO2 YSHSs DSSC is about 6.01%, remarkably higher than those of TiO2 P25 (4.46%) and TiO2 NSs (4.01%) measured in our parallel experiments. It is deduced that the enhanced η of the TiO2 YSHSs DSSC is closely related to the larger amounts of anchored dye molecules. Fig. 5 displays the incident photo to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the several DSSCs. The IPCE is in good agreement with the η of the solar cells. The IPCE is determined by the light absorption efficiency of the dye, the quantum yield of electron injection, and the efficiency of collecting the injected electrons at the conducting glass substrate, which is strongly affected by the photoanode properties of the DSSCs. Compared with the TiO2 P25 and TiO2 NSs films, the film of TiO2 YSHSs had a higher IPCE over the whole range from 400 nm to 800 nm. At the maximum value of the IPCE spectra at 530 nm, the IPCE of the film of the TiO2 YSHSs was approximately 60.4%, obviously higher than that of the TiO2 P25 (44.6%) and TiO2 NSs (24.4%) films.

Fig. 6a illustrates the possible reflecting and scattering of light in film of TiO2 YSHSs and inside of the single TiO2 YSHS. It is believed that the outer shell assembled by the random oriented NSs in a micro-sized TiO2 YSHS can not only multireflect, but also scatter the incident light of different wavelengths in the whole range of visible light.39,40 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the three TiO2 films were thus investigated here (Fig. 6b) to explore their different light scattering and transmittance capabilities. Comparatively, the TiO2 NSs and TiO2 P25 films present little diffuse reflectance in the visible region and a rapid decrease in diffuse reflection capacities were observed for both films as the wavelength increased from 400 to 800 nm due to their small particle size. This would cause the unabsorbed light to penetrate through the films without being back scattered to enhance light absorption. In contrast, the TiO2 YSHSs film exhibit high diffuse reflectance in the visible range of 400–700 nm and only a slight decline could be noticed beginning at 700 nm. Overall, the reflectance of the film made of TiO2 YSHSs is much higher than that of TiO2 NSs and TiO2 P25 in the whole wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm, pointing at the key role of the yolk@shell hierarchical microspheres in the film in dominating the light scattering behavior. Therefore, the TiO2 YSHSs as bi-functional photoanode materials can not only drastically increase the dye loading rate but also maximize the absorption of light in the range of 400 to 800 nm, and thus enhance the light harvesting efficiency.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can provide additional information and deeper understanding of the dynamics of electron transport and recombination in electrodes, electron transfer between the counter electrode and electrolyte, and I3− diffusion in the electrolyte.39,41,42 To reveal the difference in the interfacial characteristics of the TiO2 YSHSs, TiO2 NSs and TiO2 P25 photoanodes, EIS spectra of the DSSCs were tested in dark at Voc and 10 mV of amplitude over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. Fig. 7a shows the Nyquist plots under the open-circuit condition for the DSSCs using TiO2 YSHSs, TiO2 NSs and TiO2 P25 as photoanodes, respectively. An equivalent circuit model (see the inset in Fig. 7a) was given to recognize the total series resistance (RS), charge-transfer resistance (R1, R2, and Ws) and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE) in DSSCs. In general, the first semicircle in the high frequency region (105–102 Hz) represents the impedance corresponding to the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the Pt/electrolyte interface (R1), while the semicircles in intermediate frequencies (102–10 Hz) and low frequency region (10–0.1 Hz) give information on the impedance at oxide/dye/electrolyte interface (R2) related to the charge transport/recombination and Warburg diffusion of the electrolyte (Ws), respectively.39,41–45 The fitted data are all listed in Table 2 indicating several features of the two TiO2 photoanodes. Firstly, the RS and R1 values for both the DSSCs are similar, simply because all the TiO2 electrodes and counter electrodes used in DSSCs assembly were printed and heated under the same conditions. Secondly, the R2 value of TiO2 YSHSs is lower than that of TiO2 P25 electrode and slightly higher than that of the TiO2 NSs electrode. Here, R2 is usually considered to be mainly determined by the charge recombination resistance, with partial contribution from transport resistance, suggesting that the TiO2 YSHSs film contributed to an increase in the charge transfer resistance. This result can be explained by the fact that the specific surface area of the TiO2 YSHSs photoanode is larger than that of the TiO2 NSs electrode and leads to much more grain boundaries in the TiO2 interface, thereby increasing the recombination rate in the film. Finally, the highest value of Ws in TiO2 YSHSs photoanode once again confirms the comparatively smaller pore size in TiO2 YSHSs photoanode.

Bode phase plots (Fig. 7b) can be drawn from the Nyquist plots in Fig. 7a Two main frequency peaks and a smaller frequency peak are observed. These peaks correspond to the charge transfer process at different interfaces within the DSSCs. It is found that the maximum frequency peak in the intermediate frequency regime, which is related to electron transfer in the TiO2 YSHSs film, is lower than that of the TiO2 P25 and TiO2 NSs films. According to the EIS model, the lifetime of injected electrons in the oxide film (τr) can be estimated from the maximum angular frequency (ωmax) of the impedance semicircle arc at middle frequencies in the Bode spectrum, according to the following relationship, τr = 1/ωmax = 1/2πƒmax, where ƒmax is the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak.39,45 From Table 2, it can be found that the τr for DSSCs with TiO2 YSHSs, TiO2 NSs and TiO2 P25 photoanodes were 65.79, 57.90 and 57.21 ms, respectively. These data suggest that the electron lifetime in the TiO2 YSHSs photoanode is the longest of the three kinds of photoanodes. The measurement was taken under the open circuit conditions and no current could pass through the external circuit. So the injected electrons must recombine with I3− ions at the TiO2 YSHSs film/dye/electrode interface. Therefore, the increase in the electron lifetime means that the produced electrons can diffuse further without interruption, such as recombination and trapping within the film. The enhanced electron lifetime can be explained by the higher electron mobility through the single crystalline anatase TiO2 YSHSs film. These factors are directly related to the improved efficiency of the DSSC using TiO2 YSHSs as photoanode.
4. Conclusions
In summary, it is found that the photoanode of anatase TiO2 YSHSs with an outer shell assembled by the NSs exposing nearly 90% of {001} facets and a mesoporous inner microsphere exhibited a high photoconversion efficiency of 6.01%, indicating 44.9% and 34.8% improvement compared to the TiO2 NSs and TiO2 P25. The performance improvement is attributed to the high surface area and light scattering effect, as well as the high electron mobility of the TiO2 YSHSs. The unique structure of TiO2 YSHSs successfully takes advantage of the more negative band edge of {001} facets to increase the value of Voc and electron mobility without sacrificing the internal surface area needed for effective dye-uptake. In addition, the technique for synthesis of TiO2 YSHSs may be adopted to fabricate other multilayered hollow spheres with a hierarchical porous structure for clean energy applications.
