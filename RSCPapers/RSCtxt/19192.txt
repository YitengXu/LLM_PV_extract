Introduction
Photoelectrochemical transformation of water into clean H2 energy is attracting increasing research interest due to the desire of decreasing the use of fossil fuels and the accompanying environmental issues. Fe2O3 photoanodes are ideal candidates for PEC water oxidation due to their appropriate band gap (∼2 eV), high stability, and rich abundance.1 However, the PEC performance is limited by their poor conductivity, short hole diffusion length, and sluggish water oxidation kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface,2 which result in low photocurrent density and large overpotential for water oxidation.
Many efforts have been dedicated to enhance PEC activities of Fe2O3 photoanodes. Element doping is an efficient way to improve the conductivity of Fe2O3 photoanodes, including Sn4+,3–5 Ti4+,6,7 Ta5+,8 Ge4+,9 Mn2+,10 Pt4+,11,12 Si4+,13 P5+,14 Zr4+,15etc. For the improvement of separation and migration ability of photoexcited e−/h+ pairs, coupling other semiconductors with Fe2O3 has been densely studied, such as Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5,16–18 Fe2O3/WO3,19 Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4,20 Fe2O3/CaFe2O4,21 and Co-doped Fe2O3/MgFe2O4.22 Polymeric C3N4 is a visible-light-sensitive semiconductor with good thermal and chemical stability for photocatalytic H2 and/or O2 evolution from water.23–25 It has also been used as an efficient composite layer for PEC water oxidation, which can greatly enhance the PEC performances. Zhang et al. modified Fe2O3 and Ti-doped Fe2O3 with C3N4 by chemical vapor deposition or a dip-coating approach.26,27 Zhu et al. fabricated a unique 3D heterojunction of a C3N4/Ba-doped TaON photoanode,28 Feng and Guo groups synthesized a C3N4/WO3 composite for PEC water splitting,29,30 and Bi et al. demonstrated a C3N4/BiVO4 photoanode.31 Furthermore, p-type CoOx decoration could facilitate charge transfer and it could act as a cocatalyst to modify the surface reaction kinetics of a photoanode.32–34 Based on the above reports, it is desired that the Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx hybrid photoanode would show good PEC performance for water oxidation.
Usually, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is used as a conductive substrate of Fe2O3 photoanodes, and high temperature annealing is necessary to enhance the PEC performance via Sn4+ diffusion into Fe2O3.5 However, the morphology size of Fe2O3 becomes larger after the heat treatment,3 which is not beneficial to maximize the PEC performance of Fe2O3 photoanodes. Recently, Lee et al. reported that a more active Fe2O3 photoanode could maintain its small feature sizes by hybrid microwave annealing (HMA), and a graphite susceptor was used for efficient microwave absorption.35
In this work, a thin FeOOH nanowire precursor on FTO was firstly fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method using FeCl3·6H2O and Na2SO4 as starting materials, which was followed by annealing with the HMA method. Subsequently, a C3N4 layer was firstly deposited onto the surface of the nanosheet Fe2O3 photoanode by vacuum evaporation of bulk C3N4. In order to further enhance the PEC performance of Fe2O3/C3N4, a p-type CoOx cocatalyst was further deposited onto its surface by a solvothermal method using Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and ammonium hydroxide as reactants. The details of experiments are shown in the Experimental section of the ESI.† In comparison with the pristine Fe2O3 film, the onset potential of the Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanode was negatively shifted by about 0.19 V, and its photocurrent density (1.50 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) was about two-fold higher. The photo-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency and incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) at 385 nm reached 0.17% and 81.7%, respectively.
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/C3N4 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 1. All the peaks can be indexed to Fe2O3 (PDF no. 33-0664) marked with solid triangles and FTO marked with solid circles. There is no peak belonging to C3N4 probably due to its tiny amounts. Fig. 2a–d show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-synthesized FeOOH, Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx. FeOOH exists as nanowires on the FTO substrate with diameters of 18 to 30 nm based on the typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results (Fig. S1†). The thickness of the as-synthesized FeOOH is about 470 nm estimated from the inset of Fig. 2a. After the HMA treatment, the FeOOH nanowires converted into Fe2O3 nanosheets with thickness in the range of 22 to 35 nm (Fig. 2b). The thickness of the Fe2O3 film, composed of Fe2O3 nanosheets, is about 300 nm (inset of Fig. 2b). The FeOOH nanowires must recrystallize and grow to larger Fe2O3 nanosheets during the HMA treatment due to the obvious morphology change. The morphology further changes after the homogeneous C3N4 deposition on the top of Fe2O3 (Fig. 2c and S2†). The thickness of nanosheets in Fig. 2c and d becomes about 64 nm, indicating that the thickness of deposited C3N4 ranges from ∼29 to ∼42 nm. These values are much larger than that of the layer deposited from exfoliated bulk C3N4.28,29,31 The TEM image of Fe2O3 in Fig. 2e further confirms that the HMA treated FeOOH turns into Fe2O3 nanosheets. Fig. 2f shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Fe2O3, and the calculated interplanar spacing is about 0.27 nm which is consistent with the value of the (104) plane. Due to the poor stability of C3N4 under the high voltage used in the characterization, the TEM and HRTEM results of Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx were not shown in this work. The elemental mapping results indicate that the Sn4+ from FTO has been successfully doped into the Fe2O3 photoanode during HMA treatment (Fig. S3†), which is crucial to improve the PEC performance of the Fe2O3 photoanode.3–5

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx. The C 1s of Fe2O3 is located at 284.6 eV (standard reference carbon) and 288.2 eV ascribed to the CO,36 which may come from the oxidized C absorbed on the Fe2O3 surface during the HMA treatment. The peaks centered at 288.0 eV for Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx correspond to the binding energy of C–N–C bonds.28 There is no signal of N element for pristine Fe2O3 as shown in Fig. 3b. However, the high resolution N 1s spectra of Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx can be fitted with three Gaussian results at 398.7, 399.9, and 400.8 eV, which correspond to the sp2-bonded carbon (N–CN), the tertiary N bonded to carbon atoms as N–(C)3 or H–N–(C)2, and quaternary N bonded to three carbon atoms in the aromatic cycles, respectively.31 These results indicate that C3N4 has been successfully deposited on the surface of Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanodes. Fig. 3c shows that there are two obvious peaks centered at 781.1 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 796.8 eV (Co 2p1/2), which are consistent with the positions of both Co2+ and Co3+, and the satellite peaks at 787.6 eV and 803.6 eV are typical features of Co2+,37 and these findings confirm the existence of CoOx in the composite.

The PEC performances of the above mentioned photoanodes were characterized in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6) under simulated illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (see details in the ESI†). The current density–potential (J–V) curves are exhibited in Fig. 4a. The dark current densities in all cases are negligible. In Fig. 4a, the photocurrent density of the pristine Fe2O3 is about 0.74 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. This value is similar to the results of single Fe2O3 photoanodes in many reports.38–42 However, it is lower than the reported value of the pristine photoanode synthesized by the same HMA method.35 The reason is likely that the stacked nanosheets (inset in Fig. 2b) in our work are less effective in transporting the photoexcited charges than the vertical nanorods in the reference. When C3N4 is deposited on Fe2O3, the photocurrent density of water oxidation reaches 1.15 mA cm−2 which is about 1.6 times compared with that of the pristine Fe2O3. Further CoOx decoration on Fe2O3/C3N4 increases the photocurrent density to 1.50 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. The photocurrent onset potential can be defined at the potential when the value of dJ/dV is 0.2 mA cm−2 V−1.43,44 As shown in Fig. S4,† the photocurrent onset potentials shift in the cathodic direction by 0.09 and 0.19 V for Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanodes compared with that of Fe2O3 (0.81 VRHE), respectively. As a comparison, CoOx was also used to decorate the pristine Fe2O3, and the J–V curves are exhibited in Fig. S5.† The photocurrent density is about 0.89 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is between the values of pristine Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/C3N4. However, the photocurrent onset potential of Fe2O3/CoOx is similar to that of the Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanode. It can be concluded that both C3N4 and CoOx play significant roles in improving the PEC performance of the hybrid photoanode. To evaluate the PEC stability of the photoanodes, long-term characterization was performed at 1.23 VRHE under simulated sun light illumination (Fig. S6†). Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanodes show stable PEC performance even after 5 h illumination. In contrast, the photocurrent density of the Fe2O3 photoanode decreased by 0.13 mA cm−2 and remained stable at about 0.61 mA cm−2 after 10 min. This result probably was caused by the higher stability of C3N4 in the concentrated alkali electrolyte.

Electrolyte: 1 M NaOH (pH = 13.6), light source: AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2), scan rate: 10 mV s−1. 
The transient J–V curves of Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx are exhibited in Fig. S7,† which were irradiated under chopped illumination at 1.23 VRHE. The photocurrents of these samples are consistent with the values at 1.23 VRHE in Fig. 4a. The typical stacked photocurrents of light on and off parts are shown in Fig. 4b. When Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanodes are irradiated by light, photogenerated holes transfer to the surface of photoanodes and accumulate due to the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, or photoexcited carriers oxidize trap states in the bulk and on the surface. These processes result in the anodic current spike.16 When the light is turned off, electrons flow back from the external circuit and recombine with the accumulated holes on the surface, thus the cathodic transient peak is observed.16 In our work, the Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanode shows stronger anodic and cathodic current spikes than Fe2O3 as shown in Fig. 4b. The Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanode exhibits quicker OER kinetics than the Fe2O3 photoanode by judging from the photocurrent onset potential (Fig. S4†). Accordingly, the stronger anodic and cathodic current spikes of Fe2O3/C3N4 must result from the more defects in the evaporated C3N4, which can also be proved by the stronger photoluminescence intensity of C3N4-decorated Fe2O3 than that of the pristine Fe2O3 (Fig. 5). When CoOx was deposited on Fe2O3/C3N4, both anodic and cathodic current spikes decreased intensively. The CoOx decoration must passivate the defects on the surface of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanodes (Fig. 4b and S8†). Furthermore, the p-type CoOx shows excellent hole-transfer and electron-blocking properties due to its relatively high conduction band edge.45 These two reasons prevent the recombination of the photoexcited carriers, which are also supported by the decreased PL intensity of the Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx film in comparison with those of the pristine Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/C3N4 as shown in Fig. 5.

The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (Fig. 4c) of the photoanodes was calculated based on the data in Fig. 4a using the equation: η = (jp − jd)(1.23 − |V|)/I0, in which jp, jd, V, and I0 are the photocurrent density, the dark current density, the applied potential, and the power density of incident light, respectively. The jp values are 0.18, 0.37, and 0.75 mA cm−2 at 1.0 VRHE under the simulated sunlight of AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) for Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx, respectively. Correspondingly, the conversion efficiencies are 0.05%, 0.09%, and 0.17%, respectively. The efficiency enhancement is more than 3-fold after the C3N4 and CoOx decoration on the as-synthesized Fe2O3.
The IPCE of Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx was characterized at 1.23 VRHE using an LED (λ = 385, 400, 428, 468, 498, 515, and 590 nm) as the light source. The tested optical power and photocurrent density are listed in Table S1,† and the IPCE values are shown in Fig. 4d (see calculation details in the ESI†). The trend is Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx > Fe2O3/C3N4 > Fe2O3 at each wavelength, and this result agrees well with the PEC activities of these photoanodes in Fig. 4a. The IPCE can reach as high as 81.7% at 385 nm for the Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanode in our work.
According to the above observations, the improved PEC performances strongly depended on the C3N4 and CoOx decoration. Mott–Schottky characterization was carried out to elucidate the reason for activity enhancement with a frequency of 1 kHz in 1 M NaOH. The Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanodes exhibit an n-type semiconductor characteristic due to their positive slope as shown in Fig. 4e.46 However, there is also a negative slope besides a positive one when CoOx is deposited on Fe2O3/C3N4, which results from the p-type semiconductor characteristic of CoOx.47,48 This further confirms that CoOx has been successfully decorated on the Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanode. A similar Mott–Schottky characterization result of the Fe2O3/CoOx photoanode is observed as shown in Fig. S9.† The flatter negative plot means the higher carrier density in the photoanode,49 and the sequence of the carrier density of these three photoanodes is Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx > Fe2O3/C3N4 > Fe2O3. The higher carrier density must originate from the more effective charge separation at the interface of the heterojunction and the much longer lifetime of the photo-generated carriers.46 Moreover, the flat band potential (Vfb) at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface also cathodically shifts. The Vfb of the pristine Fe2O3 is 0.59 VRHE which is in good agreement with the values in the literature,50 and the Vfb of Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx is 0.36 and 0.34 VRHE, respectively. The C3N4 modification greatly changes the Vfb cathodically shifted by about 0.23 V. This suggests a larger accumulation of electrons in the heterojunction and decreased charge recombination. After the p-type CoOx decoration, the Vfb further cathodically shifts by about 0.02 V for Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx, which reflects that the CoOx can further improve the charge separation.
In order to gain a deep understanding of the charge transfer properties of the photoanodes, the Nyquist plots derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at 0.7 VRHE from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz under illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) as shown in Fig. 4f. The curves were fitted using the model in the inset of Fig. 4f. From the fitting results, the Rct representing the charge transfer resistance of photoexcited holes from the valence band to the electrolyte is calculated to be 255780, 56925, and 28996 Ω for Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx, respectively. The decreasing Rct indicates that the interface charge transfer rate has increased after C3N4 and CoOx decoration in sequence. This enhanced charge transfer ability is caused by the reduced accumulation of the charge density at the surface of the photoanodes. This result can also explain why Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanodes exhibit higher PEC performance than Fe2O3 though there are more defects in C3N4.

Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of Fe2O3, Fe2O3/C3N4, Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx films and C3N4 powder. The absorption band edge of C3N4 powder blue shifts compared with those of the three films. However, the C3N4 decoration doesn't shift the absorption band edges of Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx films probably due to the tiny amount of the C3N4 layer. This result also indicates that the enhanced PEC performances are not caused by the optical properties. Fig. 6b exhibits the band gaps of C3N4 and Fe2O3 calculated using the following equation:  where A is a material specific constant and the power index n depends on the particular type of optical transition. Here, the values of n are 1/2 and 2 for the direct-band-gap C3N4 and indirect-band-gap Fe2O3, respectively.46,51 The calculated values are 2.05 eV for Fe2O3 and 2.70 eV for C3N4 which agree with the reported ones.46,51 The absolute position of the charge (pHzpc) can be calculated using the following equation:52E0CB = X − Ec − 1/2Eg

Here, X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, which shows the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms, and is defined as the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy; Ec is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV); and Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor. The calculated value of X is 5.87 eV for Fe2O3. Based on the above equation and the calculated band gap, the conduction band edge (ECB) of Fe2O3 (Eg = 2.05 eV) is about 0.35 eV, and the valence band edge (EVB) of Fe2O3 is about 2.4 eV. Because C3N4 is a polymeric semiconductor, the notation “C3N4” is used to describe this class of materials rather than the idealized structure,53 thus the above equation is not appropriate for the band edge calculation of C3N4. According to a previous report, the band positions are ECB = −1.13 eV and EVB = 1.57 eV for C3N4.28
Based on the above results, the photoexcited electrons of the C3N4 decoration transfer to Fe2O3, and favorably move to the Pt counter electrode for H2 evolution through the FTO substrate. Meanwhile, the holes from Fe2O3 migrate toward the surface of C3N4 due to the different band potentials. This process improves the charge separation ability across the heterojunction (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, CoOx particles also effectively suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers due to the passivation of surface trapped charges (Fig. 4b).47 Simultaneously, the p-type CoOx can effectively transfer the photoexcited holes and block the electrons.45 The stored holes oxidize the CoOx cocatalyst from Co2+ to Co3+/Co4+ and finally to Co4+–O intermediates to produce O2,28,29 and it needs lower overpotential for PEC water oxidation.34 After the water oxidation, Co4+ was reduced to Co2+ that then went into the next catalysis reaction cycle. The proposed mechanism of PEC water oxidation is shown in Scheme 1.

Conclusions
In summary, we have firstly developed a vacuum evaporation strategy to fabricate a C3N4-decorated Fe2O3 photoanode with efficient PEC water splitting. The decoration of the Fe2O3/C3N4 photoanode with p-type CoOx further improved its PEC performance. The resulting hybrid photoanode exhibited greatly enhanced PEC performance. The photocurrent density of the hybrid photoanode was 2-fold as high as that of the pristine Fe2O3 at 1.23 VRHE, and the photocurrent onset potential was cathodically shifted by about 0.19 V. The efficient charge separation, recombination center reduction, and fast charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface resulting from C3N4 and the p-type CoOx cocatalyst contribute to the efficient PEC performance for water oxidation. This work provided a novel method to synthesize efficient photoanodes which could be used in other research studies.
