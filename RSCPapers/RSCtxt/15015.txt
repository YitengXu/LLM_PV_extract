    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 7th July 2021AbstractIn recent decades, the rapid development of solar water evaporation has been achieved, focusing on low-cost and energy water desalination. For this purpose, different photothermal materials have been introduced, which promise new techniques in the field of freshwater production. This rapid development has given birth to novel technologies involving photothermal materials that use minimum energy with low cost and exceptional efficacy. These design architectures enhance the evaporation performance substantially. Herein, we systemically present the recent progress in this field. The major challenge faced by photothermal materials is the accumulation of salt crystals on their surface due to their continuous operation in salty water, which increases the reflection of light and blocks their channels for steam evaporation. This reduces the absorption efficiency of photothermal materials and results in a reduction in the evaporation efficiency with time. Particularly, different innovative photothermal material technologies and salt rejection techniques are highlighted, including mechanical washing and natural washing (dissolution), pushing salt ions back into the bulk water through the diffusion mode, direct water resistance and salt ion repulsion and site-specific salt discharge.

1. Introduction
Currently, due to growth of the population and economic development, freshwater has become scarce,1 where almost 1.6 billion people live with water scarcity, and in the coming decades this problem will worsen.2 The available freshwater is only 2.5%, and its ratio has been deteriorating daily due to the severe water pollution.3 This issue has increased globally, and thus considerable efforts have been made for the development of advanced materials and methods to obtain potable water from contaminated water and seawater. To date, two different approaches, namely reverse osmosis (RO) and low temperature multiple-effect distillation (LT-MED), are commonly used for seawater desalination.4,5 However, they have some drawbacks such as high energy usage (i.e., 5 kW h m−3 for RO and 8 kW h m−3 for MED) and the requirement of large centralized infrastructure. Thus, the development of an appealing solution is highly desirable to balance the energy consumption and water harvesting efficiency. Novel and ideal water purification/harvesting systems should possess the following traits: operate on low energy, cost effective, easy-to-install and portable, compatible manufacturing system, and excellent efficiency. As a source of recyclable energy, solar energy has attracted significant attention as a future alternative to fossil fuel. Considering its practical applications, tremendous work has been focused on using solar energy for wide applications ranging from generating power,6 photocatalysis,7,8 and solar cells,9 to water purification and desalination.10 The photothermal effect has been commercially used due to its capability of converting solar energy to thermal energy. However, photothermal materials have a low conversion efficiency. The distribution of sunlight on the surface of the Earth is categorized into three regions, i.e., the ultraviolet region (300–400 nm, 7%); visible region (400–700 nm, 43%); and near-infrared region (700–2500 nm, 50%).11 Thus, to fully utilize sunlight, a hurdle is to design solar absorbers with strong broadband absorbance, which can cover the entire solar spectrum.
The development of various photothermal materials in the last ten years has shown great achievement in the fabrication and growth of solar-powered seawater desalination technologies. These emerging photothermic materials have a great potential to consume solar energy directly. Two approaches are employed for the production of clean water with the help of solar energy: (1) desalination or eliminating contaminants from polluted water and extracting fresh water; and (2) collecting fresh water from air.12 Solar-driven photothermal energy has the capability to accelerate water evaporation and acts as a hot source during the desalination of seawater in membrane distillation (MD). Besides, it also enhances the photocatalytic adsorption process to remove water contaminants quickly. Some materials can be used to extract clean water from the humidity in the atmosphere. Photothermal energy provides low-level energy for the quick discharge of water molecules trapped in sorptive materials. This process is promising because vapors and droplets within the atmosphere constitute 10% of freshwater sources. Accordingly, solid photothermal materials and the aqueous solution interface are two of the important photothermal functions discussed above.13
The most essential part in seawater desalination is evaporation. To achieve an excellent evaporation performance, photothermal evaporators rely on efficient solar-thermal conversion, especially on heat localization.14 Afterwards, the steam generated by water is pumped by capillary force. The upper layer of photothermal materials absorbs sunlight energy and convert it into thermal energy, whereas the lower layer is porous, which can pump water through capillary force. Porous materials such as cotton fabrics,15 sponges,16 and hydrogels17 can swiftly transport water to the evaporation interface. Also, insulation is needed to maintain efficient evaporation by reducing heat conduction loss.18 However, in practical use, when evaporation increases, the salt accumulation also increases during uninterrupted vapor generation in saline water, resulting in a reduction in evaporation efficiency. Recently, many researchers have developed photothermal materials with integrated salt-blocking technology. The transportation of water is an important factor in solar evaporation. In addition to the capillary force of a material, hydrophilicity also helps in swift water transportation. Both capillary action and the photoelectrical pump used in reverse osmosis are passive systems.19 In passive systems, the capillary sucks liquid, which wets its walls and forms a curved shape, resulting in the production of additional pressure under surface tension and the wetting angle. Therefore, the hydrophilic nature of a material will impact the air–liquid interface and water transport volume.20
Salt accumulation greatly reduces the efficiency of the design in the long term and acts as a barrier to prevent further salt blocking. Also, an increased in light reflectance and reduced light absorption due to salt accumulation further hamper the salt blocking performance. The traditional method for the removal of salt from surface of a solar evaporator is washing. However, one downside of this is repeated interruptions, which can increase the cost and attenuate the productivity of the operation. Therefore, practical and viable solutions are necessary to overcome these challenges. One of the possible solutions is the use of photothermal materials with anti-fouling and salt-blocking features. However, despite the promising research on solar evaporation, the application of salt-blocking is limited.
Recently, a considerable amount of research work has been done in the field of photothermal materials and their diverse applications.21,22 Strides have been made in solar steam generation technologies.23 Additionally, salt accumulation issues can be detrimental to the effects of seawater desalination in the long term. Herein, we specifically provide a concise explanation of the available salt-blocking technologies and suggestions for the self-regeneration of the photothermal structure design, as shown in Fig. 1. Finally, the conclusion and outlook will be summarized, giving holistic insight into the development of solar energy to produce potable water.

2. Recent innovative photothermal materials
Currently, there has been significant innovation in the research on the photothermal materials and their probable advantages.12,22,27 However, this research is limited in its outlook towards solar water desalination, and thus there is a lack of research focusing on the novel innovation and coming trends in comprehensive solar-driven low-energy desalination water technologies. Polypyrrole (PPy)28,29 and other carbon-based materials30,31 have the ability to convert light energy into heat. However, despite the significant developments, metallic nanoparticles can only exhibit a response in a specific solar spectrum range,32 and most organic substances show wear and tear.33 Therefore, it is still challenging to establish photothermal converters with ultra-high efficiency and reliability for practical use. An ideal photothermal material must have the following features: (1) the capacity to absorb solar light in the full spectrum (250 to 2500 nm), (2) low emissivity, and (3) it should be made from abundantly and cheaply available elements for industrial production.
As the basic components of light energy to heat energy convertors, photothermal materials are required to consume solar energy. Considering practical advantages and applications, these photothermic substances should be possess the diverse attributes of immense and wide-range absorption of light, abundant sources, which are sustainable, manufacturing processes that are scalable, and affordable price. Over the last few years, there has been an upsurge in research interest on different up-to-date photothermal materials for different applications.22,34 Accordingly, photothermal materials can be divided into four groups, including carbon-based materials, narrow band gap semiconductor materials, plasmonic nanoparticles, and MXenes. Here, we give a brief glance into the latest development in the field of photothermal materials, which show immense promise in practical implementation. Our aim is to present incisive knowledge of the basic theoretical principles, leading to the synthesis of high-quality photothermal materials to meet the diverse needs of both theoretical and experimental implementations.
2.1. Carbon-based materials
Carbon-based photothermal materials are abundant and their light absorption ability is very high; moreover, they are extremely good thermal conductors. When sunlight hits carbon-based photothermic materials, they are excited, and subsequently de-excited to emit energy in the form of heat.35
The process of synthesizing carbon materials using various organic materials such as biomass and biochar through high temperature, which involves pyrolysis, is known as carbonization.36 The carbonization process is commonly used by researchers to design different photothermic converters from low-cost and easily available organic porous materials such as foam,37 sugarcane,38 carbonized lotus seedpods,39 and bamboo.40 After the carbonization process, the captivation efficacy of sunlight increases dramatically. Recently, different structures have been fabricated to expand the efficacy of solar energy absorption and conversion,41 heat localization,42 and water stream and vapor transport.43
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are huge cylindrical molecules having a hexagonal structure of hybridized carbon atoms. The important features of CNTs that make their use practicable in water desalination include the transportation of water at a high flux with accentuated salt-blocking, thus minimizing membrane contamination.44 Thus, the simulation of the transportation pattern of water molecules in CNTs has been widely investigated.45,46 Another important structural property of CNTs that make them perfect for application in desalination is the blocking of dissolved ions in water. However, the commercial use of CNTs for desalination requires the fabrication of CNT membranes on a large scale. Recently, Xiong et al. combined CNTs with fire-resistant inorganic paper based on ultra-long hydroxyapatite nanowires (HNs) for the generation of steam,47 providing the water evaporation efficiency of 83.2% at 1 kW m−2 and 92.8% at 10 kW m−2 with a sustainable water evaporation capacity for long-term use. HN/CNT has a porous structure and floats on water. The CNT layer converts solar energy into thermal energy and generates water vapor, while HN maintains high thermal stability, as shown in Fig. 2(a).

Graphene is a single-layer sheet of carbon atoms and can be used as a photothermal material and nanofilter because of its extremely high hydrophilicity and surface charge property. Furthermore, its oxidation degree can be easily tuned to for reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which was integrated with a photothermal hydrogel (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA), working as a solar absorber.48 Graphene derivatives can be easily tuned into different bulk materials via micro–nano fabrication techniques (i.e., 2D film49 and 3D aerogel50) as photothermal convertors. Fu, et al. demonstrated an easy method to fabricate a graphene aerogel (GA) from GO via a photo-reduction process.51 The designed GA floated on the surface of water to absorb sunlight, thus maintaining a local heat region, which generated steam. A steady stream of water was also generated through porous GA, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
2.2. Narrow bandgap semiconductors
Semiconductors with a narrow bandgap (Eg) have immense photothermal conversion efficiency. In solar desalination, nano and micro-structure semiconductors show promising light absorption capacity through sunlight reflection and trapping. TiO2 is an promising candidate for photothermal conversion due to its photoresponse capacity, low cost, and thermally stability.52–54 Recent developments have shown new 2D semiconductor materials, e.g., MoS2 (ref. 55) and black phosphorus,56 as photothermic materials because of their huge surface area and strong sunlight absorption capability. Moreover, Zhang et al. designed a 3D dimpled MoS2 membrane.57 Recently, our group proposed a copper–zinc–tin–selenide (CZTSe) nano-carambola membrane with anti-fouling characteristics.58 CZTSe with a bandgap of ∼1 eV has an absorption below 1300 nm, while the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect is used for the absorption of a longer wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2(c).59 The CZTSe nano-carambola membrane showed outstanding conversion of light to heat, copious nanochannels, anti-fouling property, timely supply of water and very minute heat loss. Its evaporation rate was as high as 1.528 kg m−2 h−1 and its conversion capacity was 86.4% under sunlight, which were stable for 30 days without decay.
2.3. Plasmonic nanoparticles
Plasmonic metal nanoparticles release heat due to the scattering of electrons (i.e., plasmonic photothermic effect), which can be explained using the Drude–Lorentz model of solid-state physics.60,61 Halas et al. were one of the first groups to use Au nanostructures as an effective solar absorber for solar evaporation.10,62,63 This paved the way for prospective research in this field.64,65 The absorption property of plasmonic particles can be extended further to cover wide-ranging wavelengths by altering their size, orientation, and structure at the nanoscale.66 Chen et al. reported a restrained seeded growth approach to design black Ag nanostructures with a broadband spectrum.67 Copper chalcogenides are also promising plasmonic materials for effective solar steam generation with inherent near infrared (NIR) absorption. Li et al. designed long Cu2−xS nanowires (NWs) having a diameter of ∼50 nm and length of tens of micrometers.68 The synthesized long Cu2−xS nanowires exhibited strong optical absorption in the NIR region and optimal solar-driven vapour generation, with 89.9% efficiency under 8 kW m−2 sunlight. This can be attributed to LSPR from collective oscillation, as illustrated in Fig. 2(d).
2.4. MXenes
MXenes (Mn+1Xn, M = transition metals, X = C/N), which are novel 2D transition metal carbides first synthesized in 2011,69 have received significant attention from researchers because of their captivating mechanical,70 electrical,71 photocatalytic,72 and magnetic73,74 properties. MXenes are considered ideal candidates for solar-based desalination due to their outstanding performance in the conversion of light into heat energy.75 Another energy-efficient characteristic of MXenes is their photothermic capability for water evaporation.76 In 2017, among the MXenes, Ti3C2 was shown to be a perfect photothermal material due to its light-to-heat conversion proficiency of almost 100%. The desalination capability of a hydrophobic membrane of MXene was reported by our group.77 The surface of d-Ti3C2 was modified with trimethoxy(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl)saline (PFDTMS) to obtain hydrophobic membranes, as shown in Fig. 2(e). The membrane obtained after the modification PFDTMS was used for solar evaporation. The light conversion efficiency of the membrane was 71%, having an evaporation rate of 1.31 kg m−2 h−1, and high stability in saline water for over 200 h in sunlight. Furthermore, its blocking rate was 99.5% for major four ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mg2+, and Na+), and almost a blocking rate of 100% was achieved for organic dyes and heavy metals.
3. Recent innovative salt-blocking technologies of photothermal materials
Many new techniques have been successful in addressing the issues of salt-blocking in solar steam generation.2 Great strides have been made in relation to water desalination by deploying new materials with great efficiency, but solar interfacial evaporation is still not practicable due to the lack of long-lasting durability. The evaporator performance is hindered during continuous operation due to salt accumulation on its surface and needs constant maintenance.
The evaporation efficiency is dependent on the advection-diffusion transportation of ions. Due to advection, salt ions congregate on the evaporator surface under sunlight. Consequently, the concentration of ions in the evaporator and the salinity gradient of the bulk water increase. Due to this concentration gradient, the diffusive force pushes the ions back into the water, which reduces the concentration of salt on the evaporator.78 Thus, the nucleation point of crystalline salt is dependent on the balance of the advection of salt ions on the evaporator surface and diffusion of salts from a higher to lower concentration. Generally, two mechanisms of solute concentration affect the evaporation of water in porous media: (a) reducing vapor pressure by enhancing the osmotic pressure of solution and (b) reducing the diffusion coefficient of vapors through blocking water channels by salts crystals.79 Thus, it can be assumed that uninterrupted salt accumulation will reduce the transportation of vapors. In equilibrium solution, the total vapor pressure of the solution can be determined by combining the extended Raoult's law80,81 and Dalton's law82 as follows: P = Σ(γiPixi), Σxi = 1(1)where P is the total vapor pressure of the solution, γi is the activity coefficient of the pure component i, Pi is the vapor pressure of the pure component i, and xi is the mole fraction of component i in the solution. If a non-volatile salt (Pi ≈ 0) is dissolved in a solution, the P of the final solution will be lower than that of the pure solvent. Therefore, theoretically, the vapor pressure and rate of evaporation decrease when the salt concentration xi increases and the activity coefficient γi decreases. Ideally, the activity coefficient γ = 1. Seawater is not an ideal solution, and the activity coefficient of the main salts in seawater can be calculated by using the Pitzer model and Monte Carlo simulations.83 Specifically, the evaporation rate of seawater should be lower than that of pure water. In contrast, during solar-driven vapor formation, with an increase in salt concentration xi, the change in mass over time should not be linear, and the evaporation rate would show a slow exponential decay over time due to the reduction in vapor pressure.84 However, if salt accumulation occurs, the evaporation rate would dramatically decrease.
Traditional techniques for salt removal include washing or physical removal, but this hampers the evaporation process. Therefore, innovative solar absorption materials with anti-fouling and salt-blocking qualities are highly desirable, but also a challenge to achieve. However, research on salt-blocking is scarce. Although many researchers focus on increasing the evaporation capacity,85 their research neglects aspects of salt-blocking, which hinders the practicality of solar steam generation.
In this review, focus on recent salt-blocking strategies. Firstly, we discuss the basic salt-blocking mechanism, the major challenges, and the structural approaches for achieving efficient seawater desalination. Secondly, the vast salt-blocking strategies based on solar evaporation are further divided into different categories, i.e. (1) mechanical washing and natural washing (dissolution), (2) pushing salt ions back into the bulk water through the diffusion mode, (3) direct water resistance and salt ion repulsion, and (4) site-specific salt discharge. We explain the different photothermal materials, evaporator structures and working principles of each group. Finally, the impending challenges and prospective research are proposed to give insight into effective salt-blocking. However, despite these signs of progress, additional work is required to tackle the challenges of salt-blocking with sustainable evaporation proficiency together with long-term durability in extreme conditions, such as high saline solution and solar radiation. Here, the different strategies for salt-blocking are explained. The results show that salt accumulation can be reduced with sagacious structure and design principles.
3.1. Mechanical washing and natural washing (dissolution)
The preliminary way to eliminate accumulated salt crystals from the solar absorber surface is washing or rinsing.86 This technique is particularly best for flexible and elastic membranes.87 These membranes are easily cleaned. Xiao et al. fabricated a 3D structure of PPy by modifying oxygen-polymerized permanent cotton (PMC) fabrics. Afterwards, they stitched PMCs and pure cotton via traditional sewing to make a 3D flower structure, as presented in Fig. 3(a).23 The cotton layer, designed in the form of a stem, can expedite water transmission and decrease heat loss. Due to its strong water absorption capacity, cotton can hold a huge amount of water, and thus salt ions can be blocked due to the process of wicking. Water molecules can easily be transmitted to the photothermal PMC surface through wicking. In addition, the design is stable and could work efficiently in seawater for months. This structure could be easily washed and reused for continuous use. Jin et al. designed a novel nonwoven photothermic fabric with carbon black (CB) nanoparticles integrated in hydrophilic nylon nanofiber, exhibiting outstanding antifouling ability.88 The nylon-CB fabric with salt-fouling could be easily clean through mild hand washing, and it still maintained its initial rate of evaporation, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Ren et al. used hierarchal graphene (HG) foam, in the omnidirectional absorption of sunlight and enhancement in broadband absorption occurred.89 This caused a considerable elevation in temperature. The energy conversion efficiency of the HG foam reached the maximum of 93.4%, while its solar steam generation efficiency reached 90% for seawater desalination. HG could be reused after washing with sustained evaporation efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3(c). For the first time, Zhou et al. introduced carbonized tofu (CT) as photothermal materials for solar steam generation, which is cheap, long-lasting, and durable.90 Its hydrophilic nature, high light absorption capacity (90%) and low conduction of heat (0.093 W m−1 K−1) make CT a promising candidate for solar steam generation. It achieved a high rate evaporation of 1.65 kg m−2 h−1 and conversion efficiency of 87.26% under one sun. CT had a high salt-blocking capacity, and when salt crystals accumulated on its surface, it was simply soaked it in water or washed and reused, as shown in Fig. 3(d). Finnerty et al. designed a bionic structure based on the ability of red leaf trees for transpiration of water and salt-blocking. Filter paper was taken as a “leaf” and GO was deposited on its surface, and then the filter paper was placed on a polystyrene board, which acted a “trunk”.91 Water molecules could move upward through the capillary force of polystyrene, which mainly decreased the direct interaction between the water and GO leaves, increasing the area for evaporation.85 After long-time of operation, salt crystals accumulated on its surface, as shown in Fig. 3(e). The GO leaves could be transformed to their initial state by scraping off the salt crystals and washing them with water. To clear the salt-clogging from the flexible and elastic membrane surface, the best traditional way is to rinse it in water, as shown in Fig. 3(f).

Another feasible solution to get rid of salt crystals is natural dissolution. By natural washing we mean that evaporation takes place at daytime and at night the salts crystals automatically dissolve back in the water reservoir. A bilayer plasmonic wood evaporator was introduced by Zhu et al., which functioned uninterrupted in saline water without salt accumulation. The plasmonic woods have plenty of large, straight, and open microchannels for water transportation, which also enabled salt re-dissolution.92 Floating membranes with asymmetric wettability have also the properties of anti-salt blocking.93 The open micro-structures in the plasmonic wood have a unique ability of self-cleaning. When a solar lamp was on, salt water constantly evaporated from the surface of the plasmonic wood, causing the salt crystals the accumulate on its surface. When the solar lamp was turned off, the evaporation of water stopped, and the accumulated salts crystals progressively dissolve back into the bulk, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Q. Zhang et al. designed a malleable and mildew-resistant aerogel based on wood.94 It was hydrophilic, with low thermal conductivity, high evaporation rate, light weight and did not have the fragile and mildew features of natural wood-based evaporators. It exhibited day-time evaporation and late-night dissolution of the accumulated salt on its surface, as shown in Fig. 4(b). D. Zhang, et al. designed a bi-layered bacterial cellulose (BC) bio-foam evaporator, which contained a CuS/BC composite material as the photothermal conversion layer.95 It floated on the surface of water, performed photocatalytic purification, exhibited self-cleaning ability and had a high evaporation rate, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Besides dissolution at night, Shan et al. reported a salt re-dissolution phenomenon on the surface of carbonized leaf photothermal materials by cooling the evaporator.96 These attributes promise new ways for solar-based water purification and various other applications.

3.2. Salt ions pushed back into the bulk water through the diffusion mode
Different from the natural dissolution of salt crystals, the push back of concentrated salt into the bulk water via the diffusion mode and the evaporator can work continuously. For this purpose, Fang et al. suggested the reverse water transfer path to remove the accumulated salt from the upper layer of the evaporative membrane with the help of an activated carbon fiber cloth (ACFC), and thus no salt-fouling can occur due to the bilayer structure.97 This designed framework can effectively be replicated for photothermic materials, which can hasten salt dissolution during the dark time and reduce salt-fouling. Presently, PVA/rGO hydrogels were used as a solar evaporator, which showed great antifouling property with uninterrupted solar desalination operation for almost 96 h, after which numerous salt crystals appeared its surface, as shown in Fig. 5(a). An attribute that makes solar evaporators work incessantly without salt accumulation on their surface is called self-regeneration, which is worth considering for the fabrication of materials. One practical method is by increasing the fluid convection between the solar evaporator and bulk water. The brine concentration is reduced in the evaporator before the salt crystals precipitate. This can easily be ensured with the help of a peculiar photothermic structure design. The salt exchange is accelerated with the rapid flow of water. G. Ni et al. proposed a fabric-derived solar evaporator for salt blocking, integrated with a wick-like structure for water transportation with polystyrene foam, which acts as a floating heat insulator.2 The designed evaporation structure is demonstrated in Fig. 5(b), which can instinctively cast-off salt by increasing the fluid convection within the wick to keep the heat localized. The salt-blocking capacity is dependent on the components that are responsible for water transportation in the solar evaporator. The simple substrate is responsible for water transportation, i.e., vertical porous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) foam, as shown in Fig. 5(c). It is considered that enhanced fluid convection is beneficial to block salt ions.98 However, the research on water transportation in microstructures is still minimal. For instance, advection and diffusion can give rise to salt-blocking, but the mechanism of action is unclear.2

W. Zhang et al. demonstrated a new sugarcane-based anisotropic design with heat-mass flux decoupling effect.99 The vertically sliced sugarcane internodes (VSI) exhibited promising results in the field of solar desalination. When the mass flux and heat flux are perpendicular, a heat-mass flux decoupling effect was achieved. The horizontal paths present in the VSIs resulted in rapid water transportation towards the surface. Because of the concentration gradient, the accumulated salt ions dissolved back in the water reservoir, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Moreover, due to the deficient water flux in the vertical direction, temperature gradient-driven heat transport was hampered. This designed evaporator exhibited high efficiency (>80%) and promising salt-blocking capability. A new design of an effective hydrogel-derived solar vapor generator was introduced by X. Zhou et al.48 The high rate of evaporation of about 2.5 kg m−2 h−1 could be attained with effective light adsorption and antifouling and salt-blocking attributes, as shown in Fig. 6(b). A salt-resistant self-powered material coated with black Au nanoparticle-deposited sponge (BDS) for durable solar desalination was fabricated by Y. Liu et al.24 The salt-blocking mechanism is associated with pushing of the salt down in the water due to the osmotic pressure, where the salt concentration in the evaporator is greater than that in the ocean, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The self-driven salt-blocking process was recommended to develop a highly competent and salt-free evaporation system with an unhindered solution exchange during the evaporation process.

An efficient and stable solar evaporator highly capable of salt-blocking, a bimodal porous structure of balsa wood, was shown by S. He et al.100 The interconnected porous microstructures of balsa wood have micro-and macro-channels, which are important for capillary force. The tracheid was too small to be filled with salt water, which diffused into the vessels through small pores and ray parenchymal cells. This phenomenon stopped the formation of salt crystals on the evaporator surface, as shown in Fig. 7(a–c). For long-term use, the bimodal porous microstructure is effective in solar desalination. Kuang et al. proposed a novel idea of integrating the self-regeneration ability in the solar evaporator by drilling small channels within wood.101 The drilled and natural channels of wood resulted in the swift transport of water and exchange of solute. The designed structure developed salt concentration gradients between the drilled channels of low salt concentration and the natural channels of wood (which have high salt concentration) in the process of evaporation. This caused natural inter-channel ion exchange, as shown in Fig. 7(d). This design has a high evaporation rate and can work smoothly in a highly concentrated salt solution.

3.3. Direct water resistance and salt ion repulsion
Recently, the majority of solar evaporators have been prepared using hydrophilic materials due to their improvement in the transportation of water, whereas hydrophobic materials are not commonly used. To understand photothermic materials deeply, the peculiar features of hydrophobic materials have been recognized progressively. Hydrophobic materials with self-healing property are integrated with a hydrophilic substrate to pump water, which can efficiently avoid salt accumulation.28,102 The salt-blocking mechanism via hydrophilic/hydrophobic structural design is perspicuous. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the PAN layer of hydrophilic material during vapor generation was submerged deep underwater, whereas the CB/PMMA layer of hydrophobic material was above the water to absorb light for surface heat localization and generate steam. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface blocked slat ions and persisted under the water to remove accumulated salt crystals.93 However, hydrophobic structures have certain limitations. A change in water phase occurs because the hydrophilic layer absorbs heat from the hydrophobic layer; however, heat dissipation occurs due to the direct absorption in water, which decreases the photothermic conversion. To solve this issue, it is essential to use thermal insulators to minimize conduction loss. The mode of water supply will change due to the use of thermal insulators, but the precipitation of salt still occurs if water with low resistance is not delivered. The combination of a hydrophilic backbone and hydrophobic coating resulting in a conversion efficiency of 80% with a Janus evaporator was reported by Hu et al.103 The backbone structure was responsible for speedy and smooth water flow for evaporation, and reduced heat loss. A further study showed the impact of the hydrophilic structure with varying tortuosity of the water pumping design on salt blocking. The study showed the tortuousness of the hydrophilic layer results in the formation of salt crystals. In contrast, low tortuosity may resiliently maintain the process of evaporation, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The support provided by the hydrophilic substrate to the internal structure of a hydrophobic solar absorber imparts a great possibility to evade salt accumulation problems during long-term operation. Our group developed an innovative hydrophobic/hydrophilic bilayer evaporator.104 With the addition of an extra layer of thermal insulation to isolate the solar absorber layer from the bulk water, the conversion proficiency of 86.5% was achieved with a restrained supply of salt, as shown in Fig. 8(c). Recently, inspired by the water lily, a floating hierarchical structure (WHS) with notable salt-blocking capability was presented by N. Xu et al.105 A distinct layer of water was created between the hydrophobic absorber and water reservoir through confining heat conduction loss within the thin layer of water, without more heat loss to the reservoir of water, as shown in Fig. 8(d). The evaporation rate of the traditional absorber was reduced with time due to the clogging by salt on the absorber surface, whereas WHS maintained 80% efficacy with excellent salt-blocking property. According to the aforementioned research, it can be observed that practically all hydroscopic solar absorbers possess a plane structure, but different designs such as cone shapes and origami shapes that can reduce heat loss from the surface and enhance the steam generation have not been studied. This hurdle is due to the limited supply of water in hydrophobic evaporators, which will push solar absorbers to work with a near-by source of water. However, there is an ample chance to achieve this if the hydrophilic substrate is firmly attached to a hydrophobic layer and transports water with powerful convection force.

A d-Ti3C2 MXene membrane for salt-blocking based on a hydrophobic structure, which possessed a salt-blocking d-Ti3C2 nanosheet layer modified with PFDTMS for the purpose of harvesting of sunlight and a unit of commercially available filter, was designed by our group for effective and sustainable salt-blocking, as shown in Fig. 9(a).77 Photothermic paper consisting of rGO and ultralong hydroxyapatite nanowires (HNs) for steam generation were introduced by Xiong et al.106 The rGO/HN photothermic paper has a porous and interconnected designed with high light absorption capability, great mechanical strength, swift water transportation and salt-blocking ability. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the rGO/HN photothermal paper were balanced, as shown in Fig. 9(b), which resulted in high rate of evaporation of about 1.48 kg m−2 h−1 with 89.2% energy efficiency. The surface tension reduction approach was presented by Z. Li et al. to avoid wet-environment damage in black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, thus resulting in self-floating capability.107 The cross-linking via the polymerization of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane transformed the BP nanosheets (F-BP) and decreased their surface tension, as shown in Fig. 9(c). This caused heat localization and resulted in excellent solar-steam generation. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature gave the BP nanosheets resistance to the impact of salt accumulation. This is an ideal candidate for solar desalination because of its high evaporation rate. A hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus solar evaporator with a 2D water path was designed by Peng et al.,25 which exhibited an excellent property of resisting salt accumulation. The structure was coated with soot, which absorbs more light than usual. This structure reduced the heat loss in comparison to the typical flat Janus evaporator and also showed better salt-blocking capability than the common 2D hydrophilic solar evaporator, as shown in Fig. 9(d). The candle soot (CS) could be used as a light harvester and the resultant solar evaporator (SE-CS) showed immense resistance to salt accumulation. The efficiency of steam generation ranged from almost 3.5 to 20 wt% NaCl solution.

A malleable anti-clogging design for salt-blocking was fabricated by Kashyap et al.108 The design has a porous polymer structure integrated with graphite flakes and carbon fibers, as shown in Fig. 10(a). This design prevents any salt accumulation in the material structure, thus giving it long lasting performance and efficiency. Furthermore, its easy fabrication method makes it cost-effective. X. Ma et al. designed a double-layer asymmetric structure to achieve hydrophobicity.109 The first layer was derived from the Cu3(BTC)3·3H2O (HKUST-1) metal organic framework. This layer is a solar absorbing hierarchical porous carbon membrane (HPCM). Meanwhile, the second hydrophilic layer, which is responsible for water transportation, was composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). This double-layered design configuration specifically rejects salt ions. Moreover, Fig. 10(b) shows its great stability after 40 working cycles under sunlight. X. Ma et al. integrated HKUST-1 and a gelatin membrane to achieve SWCNT/gelatin (SGM), as shown in Fig. 10(c).110 This membrane is flexible, bio-compatible, hydrophilic, with low thermal conduction. The thin layer of gelatin has a zeta potential of ∼18 eV and a pH of 7. The negatively charged membrane permits water to pass swiftly and slowly due to the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion. Ion screening was achieved due to the Donnan effect of the thin layer, and thus salt ions can be blocked and no salt accumulation occurred during 1 day of operation. A solar steam generator was fabricated using the stem marrow of corn stalk by Z. Sun et al., as shown in Fig. 10(d).111 This evaporator exhibited a high evaporation efficiency, self-cleaning properties, and durability. Also, due to the natural structure of the corn stalk, it possessed low moisture enthalpy with high speed capillary water transportation. Moreover, it is a low-cost, environment-friendly design with excellent evaporation efficiency. A novel solar evaporator was designed by C. Liu et al., which was composed of conductive ink EL-P-3040 (rich in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT) and diatomite.112 It presented a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 1.41 kg m−2 with an evaporation rate of 88.6% and high sunlight use. This design effectively reduced salt crystallization during the process of desalination. As the hydrophilic medium, diatomite was integrated in the ink layer to create water paths to transport water, as shown in Fig. 10(e). The diatomite blocked the transportation of salt ions to reduce the hyper-concentration of the salt solution. Zeng et al. developed a polyelectrolyte hydrogel foam (PHF) that enmeshed poly(sodium acrylate) (P(SA)), an ionic hydrogel, in microcellular CF.113 Seawater could be pushed in a huge quantity due to the osmotic gradient between the seawater (osmotic gradient of Π ≈ 27.6 atm) and P(SA) hydrogel (osmotic gradient of Π ≈ 230 atm). Moreover, due to the high ionic force, salt ions could be blocked at the junction between the water and foam, and only a small amount of salt reached the foam, which was trapped by the ionic group, as shown in Fig. 10(f). Generally, this mechanism has the advantage of the osmotic pressure gradient between the polyelectrolyte hydrogel and the seawater, which achieves a greater evaporation rate and salt-blocking.

3.4. Site-specific salt discharge
When water is pushed by capillary force, which also transfers salt ions from a source to a specific site (solar absorber edges/terminals), it is known as site-specific salt discharge. The concentration of salt increases when the flux of water reaches the end, which leads to the loss of water over the evaporative area. Moreover, the crystallization of salt occurs only at the terminus due to the directional flow of water, and thus the evaporators are left free from salt issues. A new approach was presented by Y. Xia et al. by fine-tuning the alignment of cotton threads to maintain the directional flow of water, as shown in Fig. 11(a).114 This directs salt accumulation, while maintaining the evaporation performance. As shown by research on the concentration gradient of salt and concurrent simulation by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), salt ions are transported by water flux from the middle of the solar absorber to its sides, and salts are coalesced only within the edge area. This approach is compatible with 3D configuration. Water is transported to a three-dimensional cup-shaped evaporator via a 1D channel, and due to the single-directional flow, the salt moves towards the edge and curvilinear wall, and thus the bottom part that absorbs solar light is free from salt and the evaporator maintains its evaporation rate, as shown in Fig. 11(b).26 However, removal of the accumulated salt is needed on regular basis due to the dropping of salt crystals, which may occlude the bottom part of the evaporator. Additionally, the water flow direction can be controlled by various entities such as hydraulics and force of gravity. Z. Liu et al. demonstrated a robust hanging photothermic structure in which the saltwater moves towards center from the ends of the fabric evaporator and then separates from the evaporator by dripping, as shown in Fig. 11(c).115 The drop rate of the solution is maintained by the difference in the hydraulic head, increasing the drop rate of saline water without any salt accumulation. Sustainable water desalination following the site-specific salt formation approach has only been reported in a few studies to date, where the limitations of this process were identified earlier. The fabric evaporator can be fixed for long-term desalination, but if the salt crystals are not removed on a regular basis, the accumulation of salt at the edge of the solar absorbers occurs. Also, to maintain the hydraulic force, the hydraulic head difference needs to be adjusted frequently. The current understanding of site-specific salt formation to reject salt is still not satisfactory, but the future alterations can make it possible to achieve satisfactory results. A synthetic T-shaped device based on a tree structure could limit the accumulation of salt to the edges only.116 This device was covered by polymerized PPy for light capturing and maintained water transportation efficiently, as shown in Fig. 11(d). The maximum rate of evaporation of this device was 2.03 kg m−2 h−1, while the salt-blocking rate reached 59.879 g m−2 h−1. The device showed durability in the long run and gave continuous salt crystallization at the edges. A 3D cone-shaped design based on the capillary ratchet of the bird's beak and the liquid transportation of the pitcher plant.117 The microporous structure transports a large amount of water towards the 3D structure. This forms a thin liquid layer on the cone surface.118 Meanwhile, the temperature gradient between the layers causes a difference in surface tension in the liquid layer, where this phenomenon is known as the Marangoni effect, which results in the swift transfer of water. This attribute resulted in excellent and a stable evaporation rate in the bionic 3D evaporator. The salt accumulated on the top of the cone could be scraped by tilting the evaporator, as shown in Fig. 11(e).

A salt-blocking solar steam generator was designed by J. Li et al., which included a migration crystallization device (MCD), using super hydrophilic carbonized green algae (SH-CGA) as photothermal materials.119 The MCD design was inspired by the law of crystal nucleus growth and coffee ring-effect in the process of evaporation, where the suspended particles are brought to the edges, as shown in Fig. 12(a).120 These suspended particles remain concentrated on the edges and get deposited in a ring-like fashion. The design achieved excellent salt-blocking efficiency with high solar conversion. Commercial carbon black (CB) nanoparticles were used by X. Wang et al. as a photothermal material.121 The salt accumulated on the surface of the evaporator, which was expanded by polyethylene (EPE) foam around the solar absorbance layer, as shown in Fig. 12(b). The evaporator drove the salt back into the water beneath instead of blocking it. Therefore, this prevented damage to the absorbance layer. A novel idea to mitigate the salt-fouling problem was presented by J. Xu et al., which included an SIE-based solar still, generating clean water from seawater.122 The whole idea was premised on localized surface salt precipitation (LSSP) at the evaporator sides, which created a salt-water concentration gradient within the printed air-laid paper-based solar absorber, as shown in Fig. 12(c). This resulted in an excellent evaporation efficiency and the desalination of both low and high concentration of seawater. The evaporation efficiency reached 40.3% when treating 10 wt% salt solution. This strategy avoids many steps treatments needed in traditional salt-harvesting and is very cost-effective.123 A solar thermal photovapor generator (STPV) was reported by Bian et al. As heat source, it uses infrared photons, which helped stabilize water evaporation, even in the presence of accumulated salt.124 Due to the low reflection of the porous structure of salt crystals, evaporation occurred without any impediments, as shown in Fig. 12(d). The rate of evaporation of STPV was 1.04–1.19 kg m−2 h−1 under 2 sun illumination in 20 wt% brine.

After discussing the configurations, solar evaporation processes and salt-blocking mechanisms of the above-mentioned examples, their working principles can be summarized and clearly classified, as show in Fig. 13. Generally, heat dissipates through (a) conduction to the bulk water through photothermal materials and water pump, (b) radiation and (c) convection to air. During solar evaporation, the salinity is much higher in the evaporation structure (C1: photothermal materials and C2: water pump structure) compared to the bulk water (C3) due to the upward water/salt flow. This generates a salt concentration gradient (C1 > C2 > C3), which can be beneficial for ion exchange to achieve effective salt blocking. Specifically, in (1) natural dissolution, during the day, salt crystals deposit on the top of the evaporator due to the saturation of C1, leading to relatively high reflection, convection and radiation. At night, the salt crystals redissolve in the bulk water. In (2) diffusion mode, the salt ions diffuse back to the bulk water through artificially built diffusion pathways, and thus C1 can maintain an unsaturated state during the whole evaporation process. However, relatively large conduction dissipation occurs due to the cyclic water flow. In (3) direct salt resistance, the water/salt flow cannot reach the photo thermal layer. Salt ions are compelled down to the bulk water through the continuous water supply in the water pump, resulting in an unsaturated C2. In (4) salt discharge, salt crystals constantly deposit on the terminals of the photothermal layer, resulting from the gradient salt ion concentration increasing from the center to terminal. Consequently, almost whole C1 area (except for terminals) can be maintained in the unsaturated state for solar evaporation.
 Fig. 13  Scheme of the water/salt flow and heat dissipation directions in four types of salt-blocking technologies. 
Thus far, almost all salt-blocking technologies applied in solar-driven interfacial desalination can be grouped into these four categories. Some typical examples belonging to different salt-blocking mechanisms are listed in Table 1. By comparing the parameters including evaporation rate, efficiency, light density, highest surface temperature and salt tolerance, it can be concluded that there is no obvious performance gap among these technologies, and the choice of salt-blocking technology should be considered according to the evaporator design.

4. Conclusions and future perspective
The photothermal approach to obtain low-energy seawater desalination has become one of the most promising strategies over the past few years to obtain clean water, where the biggest achievement is the huge step forward in the sunlight to steam generation efficiency. Recently, many photothermal materials have shown high efficiency of more than 90%, which is rarely possible in traditional solar stills. This is due to the strides made in new photothermal designs, especially the salt-blocking technologies of photothermal materials. At present, the main salt-blocking technologies can be classified as: (1) mechanical and natural washing; (2) pushing salt ions down back into the bulk water; (3) direct water resistance and salt ion repulsion; and (4) site-specific salt discharge. These technologies overcome the dilemma that the salt precipitation hinders the water supply and the heat utilization efficiency during the long-term operation of the interfacial evaporator, and thus the safety and reliability of solar desalination can be ensured.
Although the salt-blocking technologies of photothermal materials have been greatly developed, there is still some room for optimization in this area to be explored:
(1) The current salt-blocking technologies work passively, usually taking effect at low sunlight intensity (1–2 sun) and low concentration (natural seawater or 3.5 wt% NaCl solution). However, salt accumulation accelerates (i) under higher sunlight intensity (up to 10 sun) due to the enhanced evaporation rate and insufficient water supply rate and (ii) under higher salt concentration (up to 20 wt%) due to the insufficient water flow. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new active salt-blocking technologies that operate at high sunlight intensity and high salt concentration, while maintaining the photothermal conversion efficiency.
(2) The current salt-blocking technologies usually work for inorganic salt ion blocking. Besides salts, other solutes in seawater (e.g., oils, organics, and bacteria) may also be precipitated on the evaporator or volatilized with the steam. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new blocking technologies for all the contaminants in water.
(3) There is a conflict between water transport and efficiency in the solar evaporator. A high water supply rate can decrease the salt accumulation but increase the heat conduction loss. Specifically, an insufficient water supply rate may increase the probability of salt precipitation. Therefore, a balance between water transport and efficiency should be reached through the reasonable design of the water supply and evaporation pathways.
(4) The photothermal efficiency of the state-of-the-art solar evaporator can get close to unity, and even “exceed” the theoretical limit (by acquiring environmental energy).126 However, the design and fabrication of the water collector are still in the primary stage. The actual outdoor freshwater collection yields of current collectors (typically <50%) are far from the theoretical value. One main reason for this is the light scattering of the liquid drop on the collector surface. Moreover, in the case of the collector design, most research is only based on a small-scale setup. Therefore, the design and fabrication of water collectors with high collection efficiency and large area are critical for transforming the advanced concept of solar-driven interfacial desalination into practical low-cost, scalable, and environmentally friendly solar desalination systems.
This review presented a brief summary of the current work and timely progress of salt-blocking technologies of photothermal materials in the state-of-the-art solar-driven interfacial desalination devices. This will help scholars and researchers get a clear view of the novel accomplishments for photothermal materials and their use, encouraging the design of new concepts for the exploration of advance technologies to achieve the long-held dream of low-cost, efficient and sustainable freshwater harvesting.
