, Accepted 10th October 2014First published on 10th October 2014AbstractWurtzite colloidal Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 nanocrystals with a nearly monodispersed size distribution and tunable compositions were prepared. The optical band gaps linearly tune from 1.57 to 2.13 eV as the parameter x increases from 0 to 1. Kesterite nanocrystals were also obtained by replacing thiourea with sulfur powder. Enhanced zinc content accompanied with increasing germanium (Ge) incorporation is found for both hexagonal and tetragonal crystalline samples. The electrical properties of the multinary compounds indicate a decline in dark current density as the Ge content rises; however, the maximum illuminated current density comes from the sample with a Ge/(Ge + Sn) ratio of 0.28. The higher dark and illuminated current densities, as well as higher photon current/dark current ratios observed in nanocrystals with a wurtzite structure were further demonstrated by a comparison with the properties of kesterite compounds.
Introduction
Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 (CZTGS) semiconductors excluding expensive and/or toxic elements, such as Cd, In and Te, are promising candidates as absorbing layers for thin film photovoltaic (PV) devices. A hydrazine-based process,1,2 which is a typical non-vacuum method, was successfully developed to achieve the best Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 devices with a record 12.6% power conversion efficiency. But the highly hazardous solution must be handled appropriately and this may limit its industrial applications. Other “ink” for the absorbing layer deposition, including sol–gel solutions3–5 and nanocrystal (NC) dispersions,6–10 has also been adopted to facilitate the manufacture of thin film solar cells. In comparison to other solution-based approaches, NC synthesis has a reputation of being the only way to enable phase formation prior to film deposition and phase control,11 while the merits of compatibility with low cost and scalable manufacturing are maintained.
Dispersions of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) NCs in non-polar solvents can be directly applied onto molybdenum (Mo)-coated soda lime glass substrates.6 Germanium (Ge)-substitution will result in a series of CZTGS NCs with tunable band gaps which can be engineered after thin films are subsequently subjected to selenization.8,10 The best PV devices made from CZTGS NCs are accomplished with total area efficiencies up to 9.4%.10 Besides a suitable band gap, it is also said that a deeper level trap introduced by the Sn-related defects12,13 may also be reduced to some extent when the multivalent element is replaced by Ge.10
Nanocrystals with tunable compositions have been discussed among various I2–II–IV–VI4 semiconductors, including CZTGS,8,10 Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4,14–16 Cu2Zn(GexSn1−x)Se4,17 Cu2CdSn(S1−xSex)4,18 and Cu2CdxZn1−xSnS4,19 and some of them present a relatively novel wurtzite structure.15,16,19 However, studies on NCs with different compositions are mainly focused on their optical properties, and linearly tuned band gaps can be expected as a certain element is gradually supplanted by another from the same family. On the other hand, very little information on the electrical characteristics of wurtzite NCs or on compounds with continuously changed compositions has been published.20,21
In this paper, based on the wurtzite Cu2ZnGeS4 (CZGS) NCs prepared with thiourea as previously reported by Li et al.,22 further research on CZTGS NCs, in particular their electrical properties, is described. A comparison of these qualities between hexagonal and tetragonal compounds made under the same conditions except for anion sources is also given.
Experimental
Chemicals
Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2, 98%), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2, 99.98%), tin(II) chloride (98%), germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4, 99.9999%), thiourea (99.0%), and sulfur powder (99.95%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Oleylamine (70%) was obtained from Aldrich.
Synthesis of wurtzite nanocrystals
The preparation of CZTGS compounds were conducted in a glove box filled with nitrogen. In a typical synthesis for wurtzite CZGS NCs, a metal precursor was formed by vigorously stirring 0.3 mmol CuCl2, 0.225 mmol Zn(CH3COO)2, and 3 mL of oleylamine at 60 °C for 2 h before 0.15 mmol GeCl4 was injected into the mixture, which was then mixed for another 0.5 h. In a separate pot, 0.75 mmol thiourea and 2 mL of oleylamine were mixed at 90 °C for at least 1 h and then the temperature was raised to 180 °C. Precursors containing anion and metal sources were mixed and heated to 280 °C and held at that for the rest of the reaction. The NCs were allowed to grow for 30 min before being naturally cooled down to about 60 °C. Ethanol (10 mL) was added to precipitate the nanocrystals followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant solution was discarded and the process was repeated twice more to remove any poorly coordinated ligands. For reactions where tin was incorporated, the total amount of Sn and Ge salts was kept at 0.15 mmol with varied Sn/Ge mole ratios as listed in Table 1. To obtain pure CZTS, the procedure was basically the same as that described in ref. 22. The NCs obtained were then re-dispersed in toluene to form black to dark brown dispersions.

Synthesis of kesterite nanocrystals
To obtain kesterite NCs, the amount of Zn(CH3COO)2 used was increased to 0.27 mmol, and 0.75 mmol sulfur powder was dissolved at 120 °C for at least 2 h to obtain a more reactive orange solution.23 The cation solution was then quickly poured into a metal precursor already heated to 180 °C. Other conditions for preparation and post-treatment were kept the same as for the preparation of wurtzite NCs. The compositions of these samples are given in Table 1.
It should be noted that the reagents contained more than stoichiometric amount of zinc salt because of its lower reactivity with thiourea. As the less active sulfur element was involved, far more zinc salt was loaded to prepare kesterite NCs.
Preparation of CZTGS thin films for I–V testing
CZTGS thin films were fabricated by dripping the concentrated NCs dispersions in toluene onto the Mo-coated soda lime glass substrates, and then drying them at room temperature under vacuum. The films were subjected to a post-annealing process, which was conducted at 350 °C for 5 min on a hot plate in a N2 filled glove box. The heating process was aimed to remove ligands to improve the electrical conductivity of the films and their adherence to the substrates.
Measurement and characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer (Bruker) and Raman spectra were obtained using an inVia Raman spectrometer (Renishaw) with an incident laser of 514.5 nm to determine the crystalline structures of the NCs. After drop-casting from toluene dispersions onto copper (Cu) grids, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the prepared samples were obtained using a JEM-2100 microscope (Jeol). Field emission scanning electron microscopy using a S4000 (Hitachi) was used to capture SEM images and the chemical composition of the NCs were determined using the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) function of the S4000. UV-vis absorbance of the NCs dispersions were detected using a DU 730 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). The current voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a 2400 Source Meter (Keithley) in the dark or under illumination with a xenon lamp at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The scan voltage was tuned from −0.5 V to 0.5 V.
Results and discussion
Characterization of wurtzite CZTGS nanocrystals
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the crystalline structures for all five samples should be more properly described as kesterite and wurtzite co-existing phases.20 XRD patterns for S1-TH (CZTS) and S5-TH (CZGS) NCs can be indexed to JCPDS no. 26-0575 and JCPDS no. 25-0327, respectively, as well as their wurtzite counterparts, which are in agreement with results obtained in previous research.15,16,19,22 In general, similar patterns with peaks shifting to higher diffraction angles upon substitution of Sn with smaller Ge atoms are observed as x varies from 0 (CZTS) to 1 (CZGS). Movement of the peaks ascribed to both wurtzite (002) planes and kesterite (112) planes together with defined increments of Ge is highlighted in the enlarged image in Fig. 1(b).
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns for Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 nanocrystals prepared using thiourea. As the peaks attributed to (112), (220) and (312) planes of kesterite Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 overlap with those attributed to (002), (110) and (112) planes of wurtzite Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4, respectively, “k” representing kesterite and “w” representing wurtzite are marked to distinguish between these two structures. (b) Magnification of the peaks for w(100), w(002)/k(112), and w(101) planes, the systematic shift to higher 2θ with increased Ge incorporation is highlighted with a dashed line. 
The chemical compositions of S1-TH to S5-TH obtained using EDS are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S1,† and they suggest that all the samples are near stoichiometry. Ge/(Ge + Sn) ratios remain approximately the same as the proportions of the reagents originally added. The compositionally dependent Cu/(Zn + Sn + Ge) and Zn/(Sn + Ge) ratios are illustrated in Fig. 2. At higher levels of Ge, the Zn content gradually increases, indicating that the Ge salt is less active than Sn, and that in turn, it promotes Zn content in the NCs.

Raman scattering results (Fig. 3) show a regular change which corresponds to the XRD patterns. An intense peak at 332 cm−1 is observed for the CZTS NCs, which is consistent with some other reports,15,16,20,24 whereas the Raman shift of CZGS at 354 cm−1 is red-shifted compared to the bulk materials.25,26 Crystalline transformation may be responsible for this phenomenon.20 Other impurities which have overlapped diffraction patterns with the quaternary phases can be basically excluded by looking at the Raman spectra analyses.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 4 show that all of the samples are nearly monodispersed. Despite some co-existing kesterite phases, most of the NCs are found to be lying flat on the copper grid when viewed down the c-axis of a hexagonal structure as shown in Fig. 4(a), (c), (e), (g) and (i). So the wurtzite dominant structure with a kesterite phase as a minority is regarded as wurtzite. HRTEM images and their corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) results show that the lattice fringes of individual Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 NCs are representative for various compositions. When x = 0, d-spacing of 0.331 nm is ascribed to the (100) planes of the wurtzite CZTS nanocrystal. As x increases, the lattice spacings become smaller, and for x = 1, d(100) is determined to be 0.317 nm, which corresponds to that of CZGS.

Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 nanocrystals were stably dispersed in hexane with a fixed concentration of 0.03 mg mL−1 to measure their UV-vis absorbance, and the optical band gaps (Eg) were obtained by extrapolating the straight portion of the function to intercept the photon energy axis. Band gaps increase almost linearly with higher Ge substitution (Fig. S2†) as shown in previous research.8,17 Fig. 5 displays band gaps of 1.57 eV and 2.13 eV for S1-TH (CZTS) and S5-TH (CZGS), respectively; both values are higher than the values calculated using the electronic band structures27,28 and those of the synthesized quaternary nanocrystals8,29 with kesterite structures. According to first-principle calculations, band gaps for the wurtzite-derived CZTSSe are always slightly larger than kesterite compounds of the same composition,16,30 and it is believed that the optical property of the CZTGS NCs obtained is also affected by their wurtzite structures.

Electrical properties of wurtzite CZTGS NCs
CZTGS thin films made from NCs were used to test the I–V curves in dark and under illumination. SEM images for CZTS and CZGS films are given in Fig. S4.† The films have smooth surfaces without obvious cracks or voids, and have approximately the same thickness (∼1 μm) after a short annealing process. Other samples with compositions in between, whose SEM images are not shown in this paper, also have ideal surface qualities and similar thicknesses as the concentration of dispersions and the synthesis procedure are kept identical. Therefore, a comparison of their electrical properties can be conducted.
In a scatter diagram shown in Fig. 6(f) marked by a solid black square, the data tested at 0.5 V bias in the dark is plotted with a logarithmic scale, and shows a non-linear decrease with the increase of Eg, deviating from the performance of intrinsic semiconductors at a set temperature. An appropriate substitution of Zn2+ with Cu+ brings about an increment in the hole concentration,31 resulting in an obviously higher electrical conductivity than that of the stoichiometric compound.32 It is presumed that introduction of the proper Cu+ makes the dark current density for S2-TH and S1-TH similar. On the other hand, when larger band gaps combine with Cu-poor and Zn-rich compositions at higher Ge-alloying, a relatively rapid decrease in conductivity is observed.
 Fig. 6  Current–voltage (I–V) curves of the Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 films made from wurtzite NC dispersions of (a) S1-TH, (b) S2-TH, (c) S3-TH, (d) S4-TH, and (e) S5-TH tested in the dark (black) and under illumination (red). (f) Illuminated current density (solid red circle) and dark current density (solid black square) plotted logarithmically against composition x. 
The change in illuminated current density (Fig. 6(f), solid red circles) demonstrates that S2-TH has the highest value, whereas further increase of the Ge content makes the illuminated current density for S3-TH almost equal to that of S1-TH, and the current density for S5-TH decreases a lot. It is speculated that when Sn occupies a Zn site to form a SnZn antisite, it creates a detrimental deep level because of a +IV to +II transition of Sn inside the band gap to reduce carrier concentration,13 causing an adverse effect on the photoconductivity and the PV devices.10 With a gradual substitution of Sn with Ge in the lattice, the amount of SnZn defects is reduced and GeZn needs even more energy to form,33 resulting in an improvement in p-type conductivity. In addition, as Ge is more stable with a +4 oxidation state, less photogenerated carriers will be captured with changes in the valence states. Different bond lengths of Sn–S and Ge–S might also be attributed to some distortion in the structure, leading to a further non-coincidence for the centers of positive and negative charges which promotes the charge separation.34 Higher Ge-alloying, however, is not always beneficial as a larger band gap which has a major effect on photocurrent makes it more difficult to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band upon illumination. So, the results observed in this research can be explained by the comprehensive influence of the factors described previously.
Electrical properties for kesterite CZTGS NCs
Sulfur powder which is commonly used to prepare tetragonal semiconductors8,10,14 has been further applied to obtain kesterite Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 NCs of which the XRD patterns are given in Fig. S3.† Referring to the EDS results given in Table 1 and Fig. S5,† the Ge/(Ge + Sn) ratios are almost the same as those contained in the original precursors, and generally, the amounts of all the elements are close to their stoichiometry. Cu/(Zn + Sn + Ge) and Zn/(Sn + Ge) ratios are once again plotted against Ge-substitution for the kesterite compounds, and a contrast between Fig. 7 and 2 is manifested, that shows that when the Ge content increases, a higher Zn composition is associated to it, whether the NCs are formed in a wurtzite or kesterite structure.
 Fig. 7  Cu/(Zn + Sn + Ge) and Zn/(Sn + Ge) ratios versus composition x for kesterite Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 NCs. 
I–V curves for kesterite samples S1-S to S5-S are shown in Fig. S6,† and a gradual decline in dark current density is observed when x increases (Fig. 8(a) open black square). Similarly illuminated current density is detected for S1-S, S2-S, and S3-S, which is similar to the results obtained with high performance solar cells fabricated from pure CZTS (η = 7.2%),7 Cu2ZnSn0.75Ge0.25S4 (η = 8.4%)9 and Cu2ZnSn0.7Ge0.3S4 (η = 9.4%)10 NCs. Considering that some Ge loss may occur during the final selenization,10 the whole range of Ge/(Ge + Sn) = 0–0.5 is rational as the details for device fabrication are different from each other.

(b) Iphoton/Idark versus composition x for wurtzite (solid green triangle) and kestrite (open green triangle) compounds. 
A comparison between two different structures is even more interesting. As shown in Fig. 8(a), a lower dark current density is found for the kesterite NCs than the wurtzite ones (solid and open black squares). It has been predicted that the hexagonal structure has a beneficial band structure for electron transition and transport, and p-type conductivity.35 When being fabricated into devices, photodetectors prepared with wurtzite Cu2ZnSnSe4 or CuInSe2 NCs both demonstrate outstanding photoresponse behavior.36,37 The bigger size of wurtzite nanocrystals, which can be roughly determined by full width at half maximum according to the Debye–Scherrer formula, also leads to higher conductivity as less surface area is capped with insulating coordinators.
Fig. 8(b) (open green triangle) illustrates that the photon current/dark current ratios (Iphoton/Idark) for all kesterite CZTGS NCs change little. Wurtzite compounds, such as S2-TH, have a much higher Iphoton/Idark ratio than others; the ∼28% Ge-alloying sample with hexagonal structure is speculated to provide the best photoresponse. Furthermore, higher Iphoton/Idark ratios can now be expanded to the entire Ge/(Ge + Sn) compositions for wurtzite NCs (solid green triangle) but not the kesterite (open green triangle) ones.
Conclusions
Structural and optical characterizations for Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 NCs with wurtzite structure are given in detail, and their band gaps are shown to increase linearly from 1.57 eV for CZTS to 2.13 eV for CZGS. In a comparison between the as-made wurtzite and kesterite CZTGS NCs, the content of Zn in the NCs is improved with incorporation of Ge no matter which structure is adopted. Decrease in dark current density with increasing Eg is also influenced by Ge-alloying, while an appropriate substitution of Ge (0.28 at%) demonstrates the highest current density under illumination. Electrical properties, including illuminated and dark current density, as well as Iphoton/Idark, are all higher for the hexagonal structure than the tetragonal one. The advantages conferred by the wurtzite structure can now be extended from certain compounds to all Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 semiconductors, even possibly to the entire I2–II–IV–VI4 system.

 	Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns for Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 nanocrystals prepared using thiourea. As the peaks attributed to (112), (220) and (312) planes of kesterite Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4 overlap with those attributed to (002), (110) and (112) planes of wurtzite Cu2Zn(Sn1−xGex)S4, respectively, “k” representing kesterite and “w” representing wurtzite are marked to distinguish between these two structures. (b) Magnification of the peaks for w(100), w(002)/k(112), and w(101) planes, the systematic shift to higher 2θ with increased Ge incorporation is highlighted with a dashed line.
