    , Accepted 5th March 2020First published on 6th March 2020AbstractHeterostructures have delivered phenomenal photoelectrochemical performance owing to their excellent physicochemical properties. We report on the utilization of controlled Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures for efficient water splitting. The ZnO nanowires of an average length and a diameter of ∼5–6 μm and 120 nm, respectively, synthesized by the hydrothermal method were subjected to the controlled decoration of Au nanoparticles of diameter ∼20 nm. The cubic crystalline Au nanoparticles were decorated on the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanowires under a controlled reaction time. A 12 h reaction time has resulted in the uniform decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO nanowires, and a further increase in the reaction time ensured their agglomeration in the array of ZnO nanowires. XPS analysis revealed the existence of pure metallic Au on ZnO nanowires without altering the stoichiometry. The Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture with a 12 h reaction time delivered a maximum photocurrent density of 1.04 A cm−2, which is a 52-fold increase than that of pristine ZnO nanowires. The ABPE value is 0.59%, which is approximately five-fold higher than that of the pristine ZnO nanowires. This reveals that the controlled decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO nanowires has altered the Fermi energy position significantly and facilitated the injection of hot electrons from the SP state into the conduction band of ZnO, effectively.
Introduction
The energy consumption rate is expected to increase enormously with industrial demands for the luxury of society. Environmental pollution and deterioration of non-renewable energy sources are demanding the scientific and industrial community to focus on clean, renewable, and sustainable energy sources to meet daily energy needs. Abundant solar energy and water sources are of particular attraction to make efforts in the development of highly efficient, eco-friendly, and clean energy technologies. Solar-driven artificial photosynthesis, i.e., water splitting for hydrogen generation, holds potential to come up with the present technological demands. Therefore, researchers across the world are focusing on photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Among various kinds of nanostructured morphologies, the utilization of an isolated zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructure providing a high surface area is limited due to charge recombination loss and charge trapping at grain boundaries. On the other hand, one dimensional (1D) nanostructures with a larger aspect ratio offer a significant irradiation pathway, a small diffusion length, and moderate recombination loss.1–4 The relatively smaller surface area of 1D nanostructures than that of 0D morphologies limits their charge capturing capability in water-splitting reactions.5 The local surface plasmon of 0D metallic nanoparticles due to strong electron–electron scattering has the ability to improve water splitting, but the tunable resonance and stability constrained the utilization to Ag and Au only.6,7 Moreover, oxides of Cu, W Ti, Ni, and Fe, etc.8–13 have been studied widely as photoanodes for PEC applications, owing to their excellent photoelectric performance for efficient conversion of solar energy. The ZnO nanostructures have gained special attention because of their better intrinsic stability, faster charge mobility, efficient electron transformation, eco-friendly character, and high photo corrosion resistance, etc.14,15
Limited efforts are made to draft the nano-heteroarchitectures of Au and metal oxide semiconductors to improve the performance of photoanodes. Chen et al.5 reported the effect of plasmon excitation on the Au nanostructure@ZnO nanorod array in the photochemical reaction. Wu et al.16 employed a hydrothermal and photoreduction approach together to grow the matchstick like heterostructure of Au nanoparticles over the tip of ZnO nanorods. Its photocurrent density reached 9.11 mA cm−2, but the observed photoconversion efficiency of 0.48% required additional optimization of the Au content for further improvement. The polycrystalline branched ZnO nanowires transferred from ZnS after pretreatment were coated with Au nanoparticles through facile ionic layer adsorption. The limited loading of Au nanoparticles in the crowded 3D ZnO nanowire network restricted the photocurrent density to 1.45 mA cm−2, and hence the photoconversion efficiency to 0.52%.17 The photocurrent density was improved further to 3.02 mA cm−2 for 3D honeycomb ZnO/GaN heterostructures anchored on multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The inevitable surface defects of GaN induced surface band bending and severely restricted PEC conversion efficiency.18 Even though ZnO nanowires were coated with the TiO2 shell to improve electron–hole separation efficiency, the protective ability of TiO2 produced a very low photocurrent of 0.40 mA cm−2.19 Likewise, the Au nanoparticles were employed along with TiO220–23 and WO324 nanostructures to explore the possibility of improving the photoactivities. The layer of Au nanoparticles drop-coated over the thin films of WO3 nanoparticles produced a photocurrent density of 0.44 mA cm−2 (at 1 V) and found to be suitable as a photoelectrode for water splitting. Therefore, the comprehensive exploration of tunable nano-heteroarchitectures of metallic 0D Au nanoparticles and 1D ZnO nanostructures for the utilization as a photoelectrode/photoanode is of vital importance in the quest of enhanced photoelectric performance.
In this work, we report the synthesis of optimized nano-heteroarchitectures of 0D Au@1D ZnO as a photoanode for water splitting. 0D Au nanoparticles of various concentrations were decorated along the 1D ZnO nanowire body under optimized conditions to form controlled nano-heteroarchitectures for achieving an efficient photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar-driven water splitting. The decoration of Au along the surface of the ZnO rod body was controlled by governing the reaction time and denoted as pristine ZnO, Au@ZnO (8 h), Au@ZnO (12 h), Au@ZnO (24 h), and Au@ZnO (48 h). The influence of the pure metallic Au nanoparticles on the chemical, structural, and photoelectrochemical properties of ZnO nanowires was explored meticulously. The surface morphology and heteroarchitecture formation are confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) studies were employed to reveal the crystal structure, purity of phase, chemical composition, and electronic structure of the pristine ZnO and heteroarchitecture of Au@ZnO. The photoelectrochemical performance of the heteroarchitectures of Au nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanowires was analyzed under optimized conditions. The decoration of Au nanoparticles for 12 h over the surface of ZnO nanowires (i.e., Au@ZnO-12 h) revealed excellent PEC water splitting properties.
Experimental
The ZnO nanowires and Au nanoparticles were prepared independently by the hydrothermal reaction, and citrate reduction methods, respectively. Zinc acetate dehydrates (C4H6O4Zn.2H2O, 98%, Sigma Aldrich) and sodium peroxide (Na2O2, 97%, Sigma Aldrich) were hydrothermally reacted at 85 °C for 12 h to grow large-area arrays of ZnO nanowires over an ITO coated glass substrate. A detailed protocol for the synthesis of ZnO nanowires is reported elsewhere.25 Likewise, trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7; 0.1 gm @ 15 mL deionized H2O) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl4; 12 mM L−1 @ 25 mL deionized H2O) solutions were prepared at a controlled temperature of 98 °C and reacted together for 15 min to obtain Au nanoparticles of uniform dimensions. Thus, independently synthesized ZnO nanowires and Au nanoparticles were subjected to the formation of nano-heteroarchitectures. Hexadecanethiol (HDT, 20 pmol L−1) was added to the mobilized solution of Au nanoparticles to confirm the functionalization of Au nanoparticles along the ZnO nanowires. The as-synthesized ZnO nanowire arrays were immersed in the mobilized solution of Au nanoparticles for 8, 12, 24, and 48 h to ensure the controlled decoration of Au nanoparticles. Subsequently, the surface morphology of Au decorated ZnO nanowires was confirmed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Carl Zeiss, Merlin 6073). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI G2 instrument) with HRTEM was utilized to confirm the formation of single-crystalline ZnO nanowires and Au nanoparticles. Furthermore, the structural analysis was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) (XRD, D8 advance, Bruker AXS). The chemical states and electronic structure of the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture were analyzed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific Inc. Kα) with a microfocus monochromated Al Kα X-ray. The photoelectrochemical behaviors of working electrodes were tested using a PEC three-electrode cell in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH of 6.8) under ambient conditions. The Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture was used as a photoanode along with a Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. Photocurrent data were obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with a potentiostat (PERSTAT 3000, Princeton Applied Research, USA, and Metrohm Autolab, M 204) under illumination using a solar simulator (300 W xenon lamp) set with 1.5 AM. Moreover, the photocurrent transient responses were recorded by illuminating the sample with 365 nm by applying a small bias of 0.3 V in order to prevail the ohmic losses in the electrolyte and metal contacts. The Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectra (UPS) were obtained from the Omicron energy analyzer (EA-125, Germany) at the angle incidence photoemission spectroscopy (AIPES) beamline on Indus-1 synchrotron source at RRCAT, Indore, India.
Results and discussion
The randomly aligned hexagonal nanowires, smaller than a diameter of ∼200 nm, were hydrothermally synthesized over ITO coated glass substrates. The surface morphological analysis of these hexagonal ZnO nanowires with clearly visible textural boundaries reported elsewhere25 confirmed an average length and a diameter of ∼5–6 μm and 120 nm, respectively. The diameter of the nanowires has decreased further along the wire growth direction and resulted in the tip like appearance with a tip diameter of up to 30 nm. (Fig. 1(a)). The hexagonal ZnO nanowires grown over ITO coated glass substrates were subjected further for the decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface. A reaction time of up to 48 h leads the controlled growth of Au nanoparticles over the surface of ZnO nanowires. The FESEM image in Fig. 1(a) and (b) depicts the decoration of Au nanoparticles over the surface of ZnO nanowires after the reaction time of 12 and 48 h, respectively. The FESEM images confirmed the random alignment of ZnO nanowires forming dense Christmas tree like morphologies. Their respective high-magnification FESEM images in the insets show the decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO nanowires. The reaction time of 12 h resulted in the well-distributed uniform decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surfaces of all hexagonal ZnO nanowires (inset of Fig. 1(a)). Although traces of insignificant agglomeration of Au nanoparticles have been observed seldomly along the surface of nanowires, no agglomeration has been found between the nanowires. The increase in the reaction time to 48 h has further increased the actual accumulation/decoration of Au nanoparticles in the ZnO nanowire array. The increase in the concentration of Au nanoparticles reflected in their agglomeration, not along the textural boundaries of ZnO nanowires, but at the bottom end and in between the ZnO nanowires (inset of Fig. 1(b)), giving an impression of forming the composites of Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanowires.
 Fig. 1  FESEM images showing the decoration of Au nanoparticles over the ZnO nanowires at the reaction times of (a) 12 h and (b) 48 h. The inset shows the (a) uniform decoration of Au nanoparticles along the facets of ZnO nanowires and (b) agglomeration of Au nanoparticles at the bottom of the ZnO nanowire array. 
The single ZnO nanowire decorated with Au nanoparticles for 12 h was extracted from the large area array to confirm the morphological feature of Au@ZnO nanowires. Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology and crystalline nature of Au@ZnO nanowires obtained after the Au decoration of 12 h. The high magnification FESEM image (Fig. 2(a)) shows the uniform decoration of Au nanoparticles along the hexagonal facets of ZnO nanowires without any agglomeration. The decoration of Au nanoparticles not reflected in the alteration of the surface morphological features of ZnO nanowires. Each Au nanoparticle decorated on the ZnO nanowires is nearly spherical with clearly visible textural boundaries. The diameter of all the Au nanoparticles is ≤20 nm, with a limited variation of ∼10%. A statistical histogram of the distribution of the Au nanoparticle is shown in Fig. 2(b). The statistical histogram of the Au nanoparticle distribution confirms that most of the nanoparticles are distributed in the range of 12–30 nm. However, the maximum number of Au nanoparticles has a diameter of ∼18–21 nm. The size distribution of Au nanoparticles can be fitted using the log-normal size distribution function shown below26 (1)where x is the size of the Au nanoparticles;  (= 19.03 ± 0.49 nm) is the mean size of the Au nanoparticles; A (= 227.37 ± 39.66) is the initial constant; σ (= 0.14 ± 0.04) is the standard deviation of the size of the Au nanoparticles. The log-normal distribution of the Au particle diameter is asymmetric. The smaller standard deviation of the diameter (σ ≤ 0.25) confirms that the Au nanoparticles are well confined to the limited diameter range.

The inset in (c) shows the HRTEM image of Au nanoparticles (upper left inset) and ZnO nanowires (bottom right inset) of the area marked by circle and rectangle, respectively. 
Furthermore, the Au@ZnO nanowires extracted from the large area array were examined to confirm the crystal structure and the interface of the Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanowires. Fig. 2(c) reveals the crystal structure of both Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanowires of Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures obtained for the decoration time of 12 h. The TEM image shows the decoration of ZnO nanowires of a diameter of ∼100 nm with the Au nanoparticles of a size of ≤20 nm without any agglomeration. The high-resolution TEM image of the Au nanoparticles and the outer surface of ZnO nanowires in the upper left inset and lower right inset (Fig. 2(c)), respectively, shows well defined independent lattice fringes of the highlighted portion of the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture. The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.23 nm obtained for the Au nanoparticles (upper left panel of Fig. 2(c)) are assigned to the (111) planes of the cubic crystalline phase. An interplanar spacing of 0.28 nm obtained on the outer surface nanowire body is akin to the (002) plane of the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline phase of pristine ZnO nanorods and not to metallic Zn.15 Neither the thin layer of Au along the surface of the ZnO nanowire body nor the alterations in the crystal structure of the ZnO nanowires observed after the decoration of Au nanoparticles. This confirms that the Au nanoparticles are attached to the surface and not incorporated deep inside the ZnO nanowire.
Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction studies were performed on both pristine ZnO nanowires and Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures to confirm the formation of pure and crystalline nanostructures. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of pristine and Au decorated ZnO nanowires deposited over the ITO coated glass substrate. The XRD pattern in the upper panel of Fig. 3 shows the sharp characteristics peaks at 2θ = 31.7°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.6°, 56.6, 62.8°, 66.9°, 67.9° and 69.0° of the crystalline planes of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201), for the hexagonal wurtzite crystal (JCPDS No. 76-0704) assigned to the space group of P63mc with lattice constants of a = 3.253 Å, b = 3.253 Å and c = 5.213 Å. Moreover, additional peaks shown by asterisks (*) at 2θ = 30.3°, 35.2°, 50.6°, and 60.2° are assigned to the crystalline planes of (222), (400), (441) and (622), respectively, for the ITO (JCPDS No: 39-1058, space group: I213). This confirms the formation of randomly oriented pristine ZnO nanowires without any impurity or defects. The XRD pattern of Au@ZnO in the lower panel (of Fig. 3) obtained for 12 h Au decoration is akin to that of the pure ZnO nanowires provided in the upper panel, except the appearance of the prominent peak at 2θ = 38.1° which was absent in pristine ZnO. This peak is assigned to the (111) plane of cubic crystalline Au nanoparticles. Overall, the XRD results were in agreement with the above-discussed TEM analysis results, which reconfirms that Au was decorated along the surface of hexagonal ZnO nanowires and that Au was not incorporated inside the nanowire body or altered the crystalline form of the ZnO nanowires.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed for the qualitative investigation of electronic structures, chemical composition, and oxidation states of Au@ZnO. Fig. 4 shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of the core levels of the Zn(2p), O(1s), and Au(4f) recorded for the ZnO nanowires after the decoration of Au nanoparticles for a 12 h reaction time. All the spectra of the core-levels were decomposed via the Voigt curve fitting function within the Shirley background. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the Zn(2p) XPS spectra of Au@ZnO showing two distinct peaks of Zn(2p3/2) and Zn(2p1/2) located at the binding energies of 1020.9 (±0.1) and 1043.9 (±0.1) eV, respectively, pertaining to Zn+2 cations.4,15 Moreover, for the observed spin-orbital splitting at the Zn(2p) energy level, Zn(2p) splits into Zn(2p3/2) and Zn(2p1/2) core levels with a binding energy separation of 23.0 eV reflecting the presence of oxidized Zn (i.e., ZnO) and not metallic Zn (i.e., Zn0).25Fig. 4(b) illustrates the deconvolution of the O(1s) XPS spectra, with two separate peaks at the binding energies of 529.76 (±0.1) and 531.30 (±0.1) eV. The peak at 529.76 eV is attributed to the O2− anion presence, and the existence of surface contamination, i.e., the hydroxyl type oxygen anion adsorbed on the surface of Au@ZnO nanowires is confirmed from the peak at 531.30 eV.27 The Au(4f) XPS spectra of Au@ZnO were recorded to confirm the effect of Au decoration on the stoichiometry of the ZnO nanowires. Fig. 4(c) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of core level Au(4f) accompanied by the core level Zn(3p). The deconvolution confirmed the presence of four distinct peaks assigned to the double peak features of Zn(3p3/2) and Zn(3p1/2) for Zn(3p) and Au(4f7/2) and Au(4f5/2) for Au(4f). The two peaks located at 88.3 (±0.1) and 90.7 (±0.1) eV with an energy separation of 2.4 eV confirm the existence of Zn(3p3/2) and Zn(3p1/2) core levels of Zn2+ cations.28 However, the other two peaks at binding energies of 82.9 (±0.1), and 86.6 (±0.1) eV separated with an energy of 3.7 eV reflect the Au(4f7/2) and Au(4f5/2) core levels of pure metallic Au exclusively. The existence of the pure metallic form of Au after decorating on ZnO nanowires evidences the surface attachment and not the chemical reaction of Au with ZnO nanowires. A blue shift of 1.6 eV at the position of Au(4f7/2) and Au(4f5/2) core levels observed after the decoration of Au on the surface of ZnO nanowires than that of the Au doped compounds29 revealed the existence of pure metallic Au nanoparticles over the surface of ZnO nanowires and not of chemically reacted Au. It also indicates the strong exchange of electrons between the ZnO nanowires and Au nanoparticles.30 Detailed explanation of the reaction-time dependent variation in the amount of decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface and within the array of ZnO nanowires is provided elsewhere.28
 Fig. 4  High-resolution XPS spectra of (a) Zn(3p) (b) O(1s) and (c) Au(4f) core level Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures obtained at the reaction time of 12 h. The XPS spectra were deconvoluted via the Voigt curve fitting function within the Shirley background. 
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed to confirm the effect of decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface on ZnO nanowires in the PEC water splitting by the nano-heteroarchitecture of Au@ZnO. Fig. 5 shows PEC measurements performed in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under simulated solar light illumination. Fig. 5(a) shows the linear sweep measurements for pristine and Au decorated ZnO nanowires at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The photocurrent density of all the samples is negligible under dark conditions. However, it has increased significantly after illumination for pristine ZnO nanowires, and extensively improved further after the decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO nanowires. Especially, Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures obtained after the decoration of Au nanoparticles for 12 h gained maximum photocurrent density than those obtained for 8, 24, and 48 h. The photocurrent at zero bias is relatively similar for pristine and controlled Au decoration over ZnO nanowires, except for the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture obtained after 12 and 24 h reaction times, which delivers a photocurrent of 0.41 and 0.29 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent density has linearly enhanced further with the increase in the applied potential. A photocurrent density of 0.424 mA cm−2 observed at an applied bias of 1.5 V (vs. Ag–AgCl) in the dark has improved to 1.204 mA cm−2 for pristine ZnO nanowires, which increased further to 1.693 mA cm−2 after decoration of Au nanoparticles for 8 h and gained the maximum photocurrent density of 3.313 mA cm−2 for 12 h (i.e., Au@ZnO 12 h). A further increase in the amount of Au decoration after reaction times of 24 and 48 h has resulted in the reduction in the photocurrent density to 2.375 mA cm−2 and 0.271 mA cm−2, respectively. The Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures consisting of homogeneously decorated Au nanoparticles delivered an 8-fold increase in the photocurrent density. These values of photocurrent density of Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures are comparatively better than those of the Au nanoparticle decorated branched ZnO nanowire array,17 TiO2 nanowires decorated with Au nanoparticles,20 Au nanoparticles decorated over WO3 thin films,22 core–shell structure of ZnO nanowires decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles,19 TiO2 nanotubes coupled with Au nanocrystals.21 Moreover, the photocurrent density has not reached its saturation values for pristine and Au decorated ZnO nanowires at an applied bias of 1.5 V. The enhanced absorption of visible light and efficient transfer of the electrons at the interface of Au and ZnO might be the reasons for the increase in the photocurrent density of the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures. Likewise, the enhanced photocurrent density for the 12 h reaction shall be attributed additionally to the effective local surface plasmon and collective photon harvesting.5 Furthermore, the 24 and 48 h decoration of Au provided relatively more Au nanoparticles in the array, the maximum number of Au nanoparticles was agglomerated not along the textural boundaries of ZnO nanowires, but at the bottom end and in between the ZnO nanowires, which might have hindered the absorption of light, the plasmonic effect of most of the Au nanoparticles, and easy access of the electron at the Au–ZnO interface.

The effect of the Au decoration on the PEC efficiency of Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures shown by the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of pristine and Au decorated ZnO nanowires can be estimated using (2)where J is the observed photocurrent density, |Vapp| is the applied potential to gain the photocurrent (i.e., J), Plight is the power density of the light source, and 1.23 V is the standard reversible potential of water. Fig. 5(b) shows the potential dependent ABPE values estimated for pristine ZnO nanowires and Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures. An ABPE value of 0.06% observed in the dark for ZnO nanowires has improved to 0.16% under light illumination, and further increased with the decoration of Au nanoparticles. The Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture with the 12 h reaction time delivered a maximum ABPE value of 0.59%, which is approximately five-fold higher than that of the pristine ZnO nanowires. The reaction time of 8, 24 and 48 h of the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures delivered ABPE of 0.27%, 0.40% and 0.15%, respectively. Moreover, the improved current density and ABPE of the Au@ZnO (12 h) nano-heteroarchitecture are significantly similar to those of Au NP coupled BiVO4/SnO2 (≡ 0.39%),31 TiO2@rGO@Au (≡ 0.38%),32 Au sensitized ZnO nanorods@nanoplates (J = 0.06 mA cm−2 & 0.69%),33 and Ag decorated ZnO nanorods (J = 0.32 mA cm−2 & 0.53%),34 but are relatively larger than those of BiVO4 (J = 0.5 mA cm−2 & 0.3%) modified with Ag metal (J = 1.7 mA cm−2 & 0.5%),35 BiVO4 nano-warm morphology (≡ 0.002%),36 Au decorated TiO2 nanorods,20 ZnO/ZnS/Au sandwich structure (J = 0.58 mA cm−2 & 0.21%),37 and Au functionalized ZnO nanowires (J = 0.75 mA cm−2 & 0.13%).38
The electrical properties, textural boundaries, and core of the nanostructures play a dominating role in the photoelectrochemical activities along with the amount of materials utilized as a catalyst. Therefore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to understand their effect on the charge transfer of photoelectrodes. Typical Nyquist plots of pristine and Au decorated ZnO nanowires in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution at a potential of 0.1 V (vs. Ag–AgCl) are shown in Fig. 5(c). All the EIS spectra of ZnO nanowires and Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures showed a semicircular arc with various diameters confirming the variation in the charge transfer resistance at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The larger semicircular spectra of ZnO nanowires reduced further with an increase in the amount of Au decoration over them, which indicates the larger resistance at the electrolyte interface offered by ZnO nanowires than that of the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture. The amount of metallic Au decorated along the surface of ZnO nanowires acts as a better electron source assisting ZnO nanowires resulting in a reduced diameter of the semicircle with more Au decoration. The reduction in the resistance evidences a faster charge transfer rate from the photoelectrode to the electrolyte after the decoration of Au nanoparticles over the ZnO nanowires. The lowest semicircular arc for Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures with the 48 h decoration time indicates the lower resistance owing to the high density and accumulation/agglomeration of Au nanoparticles, which contribute to the increased concentration of photogenerated electrons at the interface of the photoelectrode. However, the lowest photocurrent density observed for the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture with Au decorated for 48 h is an interesting contradiction with the EIS measurements. Although the higher concentration of Au furnishes higher photoelectron generation, the corresponding self-blocking of photoelectrons by metallic Au nanoparticles contributes to faster recombination,5 and hence, the lower photocurrents even after their lowest resistance.
The photocurrent measurements of Au@ZnO heteroarchitectures were carried out under visible light illumination with continuous ON/OFF cycles of 30 s. Fig. 5(b) depicts photocurrent densities measured at 3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for continuous cycles of 360 s. A photocurrent density of 0.02 A cm−2 is observed for pristine ZnO nanowires, and is further enhanced after the controlled decoration of Au nanoparticles. The maximum photocurrent density of 1.04 A cm−2 observed for the decoration of Au nanoparticles for 12 h over the ZnO nanowires is a 52-fold increase than that of pristine ZnO nanowires. The optimal repeatability/stability with a negligible reduction of the photocurrent for various ON–OFF cycles is in consonance with that observed for the CoNi@ZnO core–shell structures,39 the sol–gel driven core–shell structure of 0D TiO2 nanoparticles over 1D ZnO nanowires,19 Au nanoparticle decorated WO3 thin films,22 and Au loaded branched ZnO nanowires.17 The well-controlled decoration of Au nanoparticles along the textural boundaries of ZnO nanowires has delivered a larger photocurrent density than that of the Au decorated branched ZnO nanowires synthesized by a chemical route.17 The photocurrent density has reduced with a further increase in the Au decoration time to 24 and 48 h. The variation in the photocurrent density is attributed to the generation and recombination of photo electron–hole pairs. The even distribution and agglomeration of Au nanoparticles in the array of ZnO nanowires might have self-blocked photo-generated electron–hole pairs and further reduced the photocurrent generation.
The Fermi energy levels of heteroarchitectures consisting of metallic Au nanoparticles and semiconducting ZnO nanowires attain equilibrium and assist in the easy electron transfer after illumination. Therefore, the Fermi level of Au decorated ZnO heteroarchitectures is estimated from the Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectra (UPS) recorded at an energy of 23 eV. The apparent changes in the shape of the valence band spectra of pristine and Au nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanowires showing two distinct peaks of nonbonding O(2p) orbital and hybridization of the O(2p) and Zn(4s) orbital are reported elsewhere.25,28 The decoration of Au nanoparticles along the ZnO nanowires has resulted in a reduction in the work function from 4.9 to 4.3 eV,25,28 where the Fermi energy of Au@ZnO heteroarchitecture is ∼2.74 eV (±0.1 eV) (Fig. 6). Therefore, easy electron transfer is expected from Au to ZnO at the interface of the Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitecture. The Schottky barrier height at the Au/ZnO interface can be tailored by altering the dimensions of the Au nanoparticles.40,41 However, in the present case, the decorated Au nanoparticles are confined to a uniform diameter of 20 nm to understand the effect of the Au concentration on the ZnO nanowires (i.e., Au@ZnO) in the enhancement of photoelectrochemical activities.

Fig. 7 (upper panel) shows the schematic representation of a photo-electrochemical cell consisting of large-area arrays of Au@ZnO nanowires grown over the ITO coated glass as an active photoelectrode, and a Pt electrode as a reference electrode. Under the light illumination, the incident photon energy absorption at the pristine ZnO nanowire excites the electrons of the valence band to the conduction band by leaving a hole behind and contribute to the reduction process at the Pt electrode, whereas the leftover holes during the process participate in the oxidation reaction. Likewise, the production of electron–hole pairs at the surface of ZnO nanowires decorated with Au nanoparticles contributed to the oxidation and reduction reactions at the Au@ZnO photoelectrode and the Pt counter electrode, respectively. The electron transfer mechanism of the Au@ZnO photoanode assisting the PEC water splitting under light illumination is schematically represented in Fig. 7 (lower panel). The large bandgap of the ZnO relatively hampers the electron–hole pair formation and further restricts the photocurrent density and photo-electrochemical performance.42 However, a hot electron produced from Au nanoparticles decorated along the surface of ZnO nanowires improves the PEC performance in Au@ZnO. After the decoration of ZnO nanowires utilizing Au nanoparticles, ZnO generates photoelectrons under light illumination, while Au generates hot electrons and electromagnetic field by absorbing the plasmon-induced radiation, simultaneously. The plasmon-induced electromagnetic field facilitates the generation of photoelectrons by creating additional vacancies in the conduction band of ZnO. The hot electrons from Au migrate towards the conduction band of ZnO, overcoming the Schottky barrier at the Au/ZnO depletion region or the interface to achieve the Fermi energy level (EF) equilibration. Even though the filling of energetic holes left in the Au nanoparticles by electrons from reduction species is possible, those energetic holes were exhausted by water oxidation. The generation of holes in the valence band of the ZnO nanowires further assists in this process and effectively enhances the production of oxygen. The controlled and uniform decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO for a 12 h reaction time might have resulted in a significant alteration in the Fermi energy position and facilitated the injection of the hot electrons from the SP state into the conduction band of ZnO effectively. The reduction in the PEC water splinting observed for the agglomeration of Au nanoparticles might be due to the reduced ejection of hot electrons from SP states and a further increase in the recombination rate of hot electrons to the vacancies in the valence band of ZnO nanowires.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the utilization of a large area array of Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures for efficient photoelectrochemical performance. Hexagonal ZnO nanowires synthesized by the hydrothermal method were subjected to the formation of Au@ZnO nano-heteroarchitectures under a controlled Au decoration time. The 12 h reaction time has resulted in the uniform decoration of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO nanowires, a further increase in the reaction time ensued their agglomeration in the array of ZnO nanowires. The TEM and XRD analyses confirmed that the cubic crystalline Au nanoparticles were decorated on the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanowires under a controlled reaction time. The well spherical and uniformly distributed Au nanoparticles effectively improve the light-harvesting capability resulting in an enhancement in solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. The 0D Au@1D ZnO obtained after 12 h decoration has conceived a maximum photocurrent density of 1.04 mA cm−2 and an ABPE value of 0.59%, which is 52-fold and 5-fold higher than those of pristine ZnO nanowires, respectively. In the case of Au@ZnO-12 h nano-heteroarchitectures, the controlled homogeneous dispersion of Au nanoparticles along the surface of ZnO nanowires has altered the Fermi energy position, and facilitated the injection of hot electrons from the SP state of Au into the conduction band of ZnO might be the reason for the enhanced photocurrent density.
