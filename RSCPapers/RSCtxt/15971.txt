    , Accepted 13th May 2019First published on 14th May 2019AbstractThe efficiency of photocatalytic charge separation is much higher for 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-CN) and 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (6,7-CN) adsorbed on the surface modified TiO2 where the surface hydroxyl group was replaced by a fluorine atom (F–TiO2) than on TiO2. EPR measurements find 5- and 12-fold increases in free radical yields for 7-CN and 6,7-CN, respectively. DFT calculations for the coumarins on TiO2 and F–TiO2 were performed to investigate these phenomena. The calculations show that when the coumarins act as the H-bond donors, the driving force for photo-induced electron transfer from the dyes to TiO2 is higher, and the dye's excited state mixes strongly with the TiO2 conduction band states. This is attributed to the shorter distance between the coumarins and the surface of TiO2 when the coumarins act as the H-bond donors. These calculations explain why the efficiency of charge separation of the coumarins is much higher on F–TiO2 than on TiO2.
Introduction
Titania, TiO2, has been widely used as a photocatalyst for environmental applications,1–4 particularly for waste water purification. Due to its large band gap TiO2 absorbs only UV radiation, a fact that limits the efficiency and keeps the costs of photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants high. The electronic band structure of TiO2 has to be modified in various ways to shift the spectrum closer to that of the solar spectrum which has a maximum in the visible.4 Alternatively, photocatalysis can be carried out by the self-sensitized degradation of dyes which absorb visible light5,6 and the photocatalytic degradation of colorless organic compounds by formation of a charge-transfer-complex, CTC.7,8 The formation of CTC in visible light catalysis has been confirmed in various other systems, such as phenolic compounds,9,10 fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents,11 and various colorless aromatic pollutants.12 The formation of CTC has also been exploited for polymer syntheses. For example, the trichlorophenoxyl radicals resulting from charge transfer, couple to form a suite of polyaromatic chlorinated products with detected masses as high as 1200 D.7 Ashford et al.13 found that the long-lived charge-separated states of a dye anchored on TiO2 can be achieved by using a molecular assembly, which combines a light-harvesting chromophore and a water oxidation catalyst linked by a synthetically flexible saturated bridge.
Despite extensive studies, the factors that influence the efficiency of the photo-induced charge separation in semiconductors are not fully understood. The importance of investigating the type of anchoring between the dye molecules and the surface of the semiconductor is emphasized by the fact that the bonding mechanism and the electron coupling between semiconductor and dye directly impacts electron transfer and the performance of the semiconductor. For dyes containing hydroxyl groups or ketone groups, hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) can be formed on the semiconductor surfaces. Previous studies14,15 showed that the formation of H-bond(s) affects the photo-induced ET efficiency (the net number of electrons transferred to the semiconductor by a certain amount of photons) of natural carotenoid dyes adsorbed on mesoporous sieves MCM-41. Carotenoids containing hydroxyl groups, such as retinol and 8′-apo-β-8′-caroten-ol, and those containing ketone groups such as canthaxanthin, retinal and 8′-apo-β-8′-caroten-al were adsorbed onto MCM-41 and surface modified MCM-41. The H-bonding properties and charge separation efficiencies of those carotenoids were investigated by DFT calculations and EPR experiments.14,15 Two types of H-bonds can be formed when a carotenoid containing an –OH group interacts with a –SiOH group on a MCM-41 surface, depending on whether the dye is a H-bond donor or acceptor. When the carotenoid is the H-bond acceptor, the formation of the H-bond decreases the energy of the LUMO of the carotenoid and stabilizes the neutral species more than the radical cation, and thus disfavors the photo-induced ET from the carotenoid to MCM-41. This effect is more pronounced if the oxygen atom of the carotenoid is completely conjugated with the conjugated chain. However, if the carotenoid is the H-bond donor, the formation of the H-bond increases the energy of the LUMO of the carotenoid and stabilizes the radical cation more than the neutral species and thus increases the charge separation efficiency significantly. Although the formation of the H-bond gives lower charge separation efficiency when the carotenoid is the H-bond acceptor, the efficiency is still higher than that for physisorbed carotenoids on the surface of MCM-41.
These important conclusions should be applicable to all conjugated dyes, but whether they are applicable to other semiconductors, such as TiO2, is unknown. To answer this question, we studied 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-CN) and 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (6,7-CN) (see Scheme 1) containing one or two –OH groups, respectively, adsorbed on TiO2 and surface modified TiO2. Selecting coumarins for our study was inspired by a publication by Hara et al.16 They found that the coumarin derivatives work as highly efficient photosensitizers for dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells producing a 5.6% solar-light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. There is some ability to control the hydrogen bonding between these coumarins and the surface by chemical modification of the TiO2 surface. The –OH groups on the TiO2 surface can be replaced by fluorine atoms by ion-exchange;17,18 the resulting surface-modified TiO2 is symbolized by F–TiO2. The coumarin can only act as the H-bond donor when adsorbed on F–TiO2 (i.e. the hydrogen atom of the –OH group of the coumarin interacts with the fluorine atom or the bridging oxygen atom on the surface of F–TiO2), while it can act as the H-bond donor (the hydrogen atom of the –OH group of the coumarin interacts with the bridging oxygen atom on the surface of the semiconductor) or the H-bond acceptor (the oxygen atoms of the coumarin interact with the OH groups on the surface of the semiconductor) on TiO2. The ET efficiencies of the coumarins on F–TiO2 (7-CN&F–TiO2 or 6,7-CN&F–TiO2) are expected to be higher than those on TiO2 (7-CN&TiO2 or 6,7-CN&TiO2) based on the conclusions of previous studies.14,15
 Scheme 1  Structures of 7-CN and 6,7-CN. 7-CN contains one OH group, while 6,7-CN contains two OH groups. 
The radical cations produced in the photo-irradiation are stable enough at low temperature to be detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. The ET efficiencies of the coumarins adsorbed on TiO2 were compared to those on F–TiO2 by measuring the EPR intensities of the radicals at 77 K following irradiation by light. The measured ET efficiency of 7-CN&F–TiO2 is about 5 times higher than that of 7-CN&TiO2, and the efficiency of 6,7-CN&F–TiO2 is about 12 times higher than that of 6,7-CN&TiO2.
To investigate these phenomena, DFT studies of the coumarins adsorbed on a TiO2 nanoparticle were performed. A (TiO2)38 cluster19–21 with OH groups or with fluorine atoms on the surface was used in the calculations. When the coumarins are adsorbed on TiO2 with OH groups (for convenience, denoted here as TiO2), the coumarins can act as H-bond acceptors (i.e. the oxygen atoms of the coumarins form H-bonds with the –TiOH groups on TiO2 surface), or H-bond donors (i.e. the OH group of the coumarins forms a H-bond with the bridging oxygen atoms on the surface of TiO2). However, coumarins adsorbed on F–TiO2 can only act as the H-bond donors (i.e. the OH groups of the coumarins form H-bonds with the fluorine atoms or the bridging oxygen atoms on the TiO2 surface). These conclusions are supported by continuous wave (CW) EPR, pulsed ENDOR (electron nuclear double resonance) spectroscopy and EPR simulations. The driving force for electron injection from a dye to the semiconductor can be evaluated from the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied π* orbital of the dye and the conduction band edge of the semiconductor.22 A high driving force favors ET from the dye to the semiconductor. The calculated driving force is higher when the coumarins act as H-bond donors, in agreement with the previous study.14 Moreover, the calculations reveal strong mixing of the excited states of the coumarins with the conduction band states of TiO2 when the coumarins act as H-bond donors. This is attributed to the shorter distance between the coumarins and the surface of TiO2 when the coumarins act as H-bond donors. The mixing increases with a decrease of the distance between the coumarins and the surface of TiO2. According to the Newns–Anderson model,23,24 electron injection time is inversely related to the band broadening of the density of state (DOS) of the dye's LUMO. The greater the coupling between the dye and semiconductor, the greater is the band broadening. As a result, the electron transfer rate will be faster, as shown in a previous study by Wei et al.25 It will be shown here that the charge separation efficiencies of the coumarins on F–TiO2 is higher than on TiO2.
For 6,7-CN containing two hydroxyl groups, the calculations show that 6,7-CN can form a H-bond and a coordination bond on the surface of F–TiO2, and the distance between the dye and the surface of TiO2 is shorter than when 7-CN forms a H-bond on the surface of F–TiO2. This explains why the charge separation efficiency increases much more on F–TiO2 than on TiO2, as compared with 7-CN.
This study also investigated how the surface modification affects physicochemical properties of TiO2. The modification of TiO2 causes little change of the specific area of TiO2. The calculated energy gap of F–TiO2 is similar to that of TiO2. Although the formation of H-bonds causes the driving forces for ET to be different depending on whether the dye acts as the H-bond donor or acceptor, the calculated absorption wavelengths change little.
The current study suggests that the principles14 about how H-bonds affect ET efficiency of a dye adsorbed on a semiconductor are universal. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the distance between a dye and the surface of a semiconductor is shorter when the dye acts as a H-bond donor, which results in strong mixing between the excited state of the dye and the conduction band of the semiconductor. This also improves the photo-induced charge separation between the dye and the semiconductor.
Experimental section
Chemicals
7-Hydroxycoumarin (7-CN) and 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (6,7-CN) were purchased from Sigma, and titanium oxide (TiO2), Aeroxide P25 was from ACROS. Methanol was purchased from Aldrich, and 3 Å molecular sieves were utilized to remove water before it was used. The procedure is as follows: the molecular sieves were first activated in an oven at 200 °C for 24 h and then quickly transferred to a N2 drybox to let them cool to room temperature. Methanol was dried over the molecular sieves (20% m v−1) in the drybox for 5 days.
Surface modification of TiO2
The surface fluorination of TiO2 is a typical ligand exchange reaction between fluoride and hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface in water:–Ti–OH + F− → –Ti–F + OH−.
The procedure to modify the surface of TiO2 is according to the literature.17,18 First 1 L of 20 mM NaF aqueous solution was prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 3 by addition of HCl. Then 0.5 g TiO2 was added to the solution. After stirring 3 h, the mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water to remove any ions adsorbed on the external surface. Water was removed from the sample by heating the sample at 110 °C for 24 h. The final sample is designated as F–TiO2. For Aeroxide P25, there are 3–4 fluorine atoms per 1 nm2, and more than 99.5% of OH groups are replaced by F.17
Preparation of EPR samples
Equal amounts (200.0 mg) of TiO2 and F–TiO2 were activated at 200 °C for 3 h, and then quickly transferred to a N2 drybox. Solutions of the coumarins (36.0 mM) in anhydrous CH3OH were prepared in the drybox, and 2000 μL of the solution was mixed with the TiO2 or F–TiO2 sample. Samples from the resulting mixture were stored in quartz EPR tubes, and the EPR tubes were transferred to a vacuum line to remove residual solvent by evaporation under reduced pressure. Tubes were then flame-sealed under vacuum and stored in liquid nitrogen.
CW EPR and pulsed ENDOR measurements
The evacuated and sealed quartz EPR sample tubes were irradiated with a Y1711 Xe arc lamp. The light was focused onto the quartz sample tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen. Continuous wave (CW) EPR measurements were made at 77 K using a Bruker ELEXYS E540 CW X-band EPR spectrometer equipped with an ER 4102 ST resonator (Bruker-Biospin, Billerica, MA) and a liquid nitrogen quartz insertion dewar. Measurements were made using a microwave frequency of 9.45 GHz, a modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, a modulation frequency of 100.0 kHz, and a microwave power of 0.84 mW.
CW EPR spectra were analyzed and simulated in MATLAB (MathWorks, R2018a) using the EasySpin package.26 The g values, EPR line widths, and 1H hyperfine coupling tensors were included in the simulations. The hyperfine coupling tensors were the sum of the calculated isotropic interaction and the calculated anisotropic hyperfine tensor from quantum chemical calculations of a model complex.
Pulsed X-band ENDOR measurements were performed using a Bruker ELEXSYS E680 EPR spectrometer with a Flexline ER 4118 CF Cryostat and EN 4118X-MD4-W1 resonator. Measurements were collected at 60 K at 3462 G using the Mims ENDOR pulse sequence (π/2-τ–π/2 T–π/2–τ-echo) with a 10 μs RF π pulse applied during the delay time T and a τ of 400 ns.
FTIR and surface area measurements
The purity of F–TiO2 was examined by a FTIR spectrophotometer (NICOLET 380). The samples were heated at 120 °C for 1 d to remove the adsorbed water before the measurements. The same amount (12.0 mg) of each sample was mixed thoroughly with 100.0 mg KBr before pressing to form a tablet.
The specific surface areas of TiO2 and F–TiO2 were determined by a BET surface area and pore volume analyzer (V-Sorb 2800P).
Calculations
All computations were performed with the Gaussian 0927 suite of programs. The optimized structures of the coumarins and the complexes of the coumarins with TiO2 were calculated by B3LYP functional. Restricted B3LYP was used for neutral species and unrestricted B3LYP was applied to radicals. The basis set 6-31G(d) is used for all atoms.
Results and discussion
The FTIR spectra of the TiO2 and the F–TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of TiO2 is similar to that measured by Tay-Agbozo et al.28 using diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. However, more information is obtained by the FTIR spectra in this study. There is a shoulder at about 900 cm−1 in the TiO2 spectrum, however, the shoulder disappears in the F–TiO2 spectrum. The inset shows the difference between the spectrum of TiO2 and that of F–TiO2. The absorption at 900 cm−1 is due to the F–Ti stretching frequency,29 indicating that some OH groups on the surface are replaced by the fluorine atoms. The extent of replacement is determined by comparing the intensities of the absorptions due to the vibrations of TiO–H groups of TiO2 with those of F–TiO2. For TiO2, the absorption at 1650 cm−1 is due to the bending vibration of the TiO–H bond;30,31 the absorption at about 3435 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the TiO–H bond;31 the absorption at about 3525 cm−1 is due to the O–H stretching of the bridged hydroxy groups;32 the absorption at 3620 cm−1 can be assigned to the overlap of the OH groups on the anatase phase and those on the rutile phase.33 The broad absorption at 3800 cm−1 (from 3730 to 3910 cm−1) is also detected by DRIFT spectroscopy in the previous study,28 indicating the presence of OH group. These absorptions disappear in the F–TiO2 spectrum, suggesting that the majority of OH groups are replaced by the fluorine atoms. This is in line with the previous study17 that more than 99.5% of OH groups are replaced by F. There is no significant change of the spectrum of F–TiO2 after heating the sample at 200 °C for 3 h, demonstrating that the sample is thermally stable. The BET specific surface areas of TiO2 and F–TiO2, determined by a BET surface area and pore volume analyzer, are 55.06 and 54.77 m2 g−1, respectively, suggesting that the modification of TiO2 causes little change of the specific area of the sample.

7-CN contains one –OH group and two other oxygen atoms, and it can form three different H-bonds on the TiO2 surface (Scheme 2), namely, A, B and C. For A and B, the dye is the H-bond acceptor; for C, the dye is the H-bond donor. However, on the surface of F–TiO2, only two different H-bonds can be formed: D and E, for which the dye is the H-bond donor. For 6,7-CN on TiO2 and F–TiO2, the H-bonds formed should be similar to those for 7-CN, and are not shown. However, the DFT calculations (see later) show that 6,7-CN can form a H-bond and a coordination bond on the surface of F–TiO2 (see F in Scheme 2). From the above analysis, the dyes can only act as H-bond donors on the surface of F–TiO2, however, they can be H-bond donors or acceptors on the surface of TiO2.
 Scheme 2  The H-bonds discussed in this article. A: the H-bond is between the oxygen of the attached OH group and the proton on TiOH group. B: the H-bond is between the keto oxygen and the proton on the TiOH group. C: the H-bond is between the proton of the attached OH group and the bridging oxygen atom on the surface of TiO2. D: the H-bond is between the proton of the attached OH group and the fluorine atom on the surface of F–TiO2. E: the H-bond is between the proton of the attached OH group and the bridging oxygen atom on the surface of F–TiO2. For F, 6,7-CN forms one H-bond and one coordination bond on the surface of F–TiO2, the H-bond is between the proton of one attached OH group and the fluorine atom on the surface of F–TiO2 and the coordination bond is between the oxygen atom of the other attached OH group and one Ti atom on the surface of F–TiO2. 
The photo-induced charge separation efficiencies of 7-CN&TiO2, 7-CN&F–TiO2, 6,7-CN&TiO2 and 6,7-CN&F–TiO2 are compared by EPR. The concentration of the coumarins in the EPR samples is 4 nm−2, similar to the concentration of –TiOH or fluorine atoms on the surface of TiO2 or F–TiO2 (there are 3 to 4 –TiOH groups per nm2, and the concentration of –TiOH or fluorine is determined by the specific area (55 m2 g−1) of the samples). The EPR signal would be very weak if the concentration of the coumarins was low. However, if the concentration of the coumarins is high, the aggregation of coumarins would deactivate the excited state of the coumarins and cause a decrease in ET efficiency. The EPR spectra were recorded after one min photoirradiation, then after another one min irradiation, and then after an additional two min of irradiation. The EPR intensities after 2 min irradiation are slightly higher than those after 1 min irradiation. However, the intensities after a total of 4 min irradiation changed little compared to those after 2 min irradiation, suggesting that the reactions approached to equilibrium after 2 min irradiation. Fig. 2a shows the EPR spectra of 7-CN&TiO2 and 7-CN&F–TiO2 after 4 min photoirradiation. For 7-CN&TiO2, the broad peak with a g value near 2.003 is due to the overlap of the radical cations produced in A, B and C. The small signals to the right of the broad signal are similar to those of Ti3+ produced in TiO2 after ET.34 In the case of 7-CN&F–TiO2, the EPR spectrum has a different hyperfine structure for the broad intense signal for reasons to be discussed later. Because all the signals are due to the ET from 7-CN to TiO2 or F–TiO2, the double integral of the peaks is used to compare the ET efficiencies for TiO2 and F–TiO2. The ET efficiency of 7-CN&F–TiO2 is about 5 times higher than that of 7-CN&TiO2. For 6,7-CN&TiO2 and 6,7-CN&F–TiO2, the EPR spectra (Fig. 2b) show no resolved proton coupling because there are many species with overlapping proton couplings. The ET efficiency of 6,7-CN&F–TiO2 is about 12 times higher than that of 6,7-CN&TiO2. The charge separation efficiencies of the four complexes are shown in Fig. 3. The efficiency of 6,7-CN&F–TiO2 is the highest, which is about 40% higher than that of 7-CN&F–TiO2.

In order to investigate the differences in ET efficiency, DFT calculations of a (TiO2)38 cluster and the surface-modified cluster were performed. The geometry-optimized cluster and OH group-modified cluster before ET are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The (TiO2)38 cluster was obtained by appropriately “cutting” an anatase slab exposing the majority (101) surface.35 According to the literature,17,18 there are 3–4 hydroxyl groups per nm2 on the surface of TiO2 (P25). Two –TiOH groups were produced by breaking one Ti–O bond on the surface, then adding one OH group to connect the Ti atom and adding one H atom to connect the oxygen atom (Fig. 4b). To model the F–TiO2, the two OH groups were replaced by two F atoms. The geometrical parameters of the relaxed (TiO2)38 cluster (Fig. 4a) are similar to those of the reported optimized structure by the B3LYP/VDZ method.36 The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies shown in Fig. 4a are also similar to the reported data (−8.44 and −3.61 eV, respectively) by the B3LYP/VD(T)Z//B3LYP/VDZ method.36 For the OH group modified cluster, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energies (Fig. 4b) are similar to those of the unmodified cluster (Fig. 4a). The calculated energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO of F–TiO2 is 4.46 eV, which is similar to that of OH group modified TiO2 (4.52 eV). It can be concluded that differences of the charge separation efficiencies are not due to the energy gap change when the OH groups are replaced by F atoms. The LUMOs, which are the conduction band edges (CBEs) for the two complexes, are almost the same (−3.82 and −3.81, respectively). Since CBE is related to the driving force for photo-induced ET, the surface modification of the cluster itself results in little change for the driving force or ET efficiency.

The optimized geometries for the coumarins adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 and F–TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5. A, B, C and F are the complexes shown in Scheme 2. Two closely-related complex Ds form on the surface F–TiO2. Since complex E (shown in Scheme 2) is similar to complex C, the calculation for E is omitted. The calculated H-bonding properties for A, B and C shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the H-bonds of A and B are stronger than that of C, due to the shorter O⋯H distance and larger ∠O⋯H–O for A and B. Although the O⋯H distance in A is slightly longer than that in C, the ∠O⋯H–O in A is much larger than that in C. This suggests that the H-bond is stronger in a case where the dye acts as a H-bond acceptor than a H-bond donor, in line with the previous study.14 Because the density of OH groups on the surface is higher (3–4 OH groups per nm2) and the H-bond is stronger for 7-CN forming a H-bond with the OH groups, the majority of complexes formed on the surface of TiO2 should be A and B. For D-1 shown in Fig. 5, the H-bond is weaker than those of A, B and C because the ∠F⋯H–O is very small, about 154°. This is because there is a strong interaction between the conjugated ring of 7-CN and the surface of TiO2 as the ring is parallel to the surface of TiO2. For D-2 shown in Fig. 5, the H-bond is much weaker than that of D-1 because the F⋯H distance is much longer than that of D-1 (2.047 Å vs. 1.785 Å), and the ∠F⋯H–O is smaller than that of D-1 (144° vs. 154°). This is because the distance between the ring and the surface of TiO2 is shorter than that for D-1, and the interaction is stronger. The H-bond for complex F shown in Fig. 5 is also weaker (the O⋯H distance is 2.201 Å and the ∠F⋯H–O is 154°), because the 6,7-CN also forms a weak coordination bond with a Ti atom (O–Ti bond length is about 2.3 Å). The shortest distances between the coumarins and the surface of TiO2 for the complexes are also shown in Fig. 5. The data demonstrate that the distance is longer for the coumarins acting as H-bond acceptors (A and B) than H-bond donors (C, D-1, D-2 and F). For a coumarin acting as the H-bond donor, the distance is shorter when the coumarin interacts with the bridging oxygen atom (C). The distance for F is the shortest, which can be attributed to the formation of two bonds on the surface of TiO2.

The calculated H-bonding properties are shown in the figure. The yellow arrow indicates the shortest distance between the coumarins and the surface of TiO2.

According to Marcus theory, the electron injection rate is strongly dependent on the electronic coupling strength and driving force between the sensitizer and the semiconductor substrate.37,38 The driving force, i.e. the free energy change (−ΔGinj) for electron injection, can be evaluated from the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye and the conduction band edge (CBE) of the semiconductor.22 The larger the driving force is, the higher the injection rate. Fig. 6 shows the lowest unoccupied π* orbital of the coumarin in the A, B, C, D-1, D-2 and F complexes. The calculated driving forces (−ΔGinj) in eV are listed for the complexes. A study by De Angelis et al.39 shows that the dipole moment of a dye adsorbed on TiO2 affects the conduction band edge of TiO2. If the component of the dipole moment of the dye that is perpendicular to the surface of TiO2 points toward the surface, the energy of the conduction band edge decreases, and vice versa. However, a 30 D dipole perpendicular to the surface causes only about 0.25 eV change of the conduction band edge. For 7-CN or 6,7-CN, the total dipole moment is about 6 D based on the DFT calculation. The differences of component dipoles perpendicular to the surface of TiO2 among A, B, C, D-1, D-2 and F are less than 6 D, and the biggest difference among the calculated CBEs (not shown) is about 0.09 eV. This difference is negligible compared with the differences among the calculated −ΔGinjs shown in Fig. 6. The calculated −ΔGinjs for A and B are much lower than those for C, D-1, D-2 and F because the dye acts as the H-bond acceptor in A and B, and acts as the H-bond donor in C, D-1, D-2 and F. This is consistent with the previous study14 which shows that the formation of a H-bond with the dye acting as the H-bond acceptor results in the decrease of the LUMO of the dye compared with the free dye (this effect is more pronounced if the oxygen atom of the carotenoid is completely conjugated with the conjugated system14), and the formation of a H-bond with the dye acting as the H-bond donor results in the increase of the LUMO of the dye compared with the free dye. For B, the calculated −ΔGinj is the lowest because the oxygen atom of 7-CN interacting with the OH group on the surface of TiO2 is fully conjugated with the conjugated ring, which also agrees with the previous study.14 The electronic coupling strength can be evaluated by the extent of mixing of the π* orbital of the dye with the conduction band states of TiO2, which in turn can be evaluated by the ratio of the electron density of the dye to that of TiO2. The strongest mixing is obtained when the ratio is 50:50. The calculated ratios and the shortest distances between the dye and the surface of TiO2 for the complexes are listed in Table 1. For A and B, the extent of mixing is very small, and for F, the extent of mixing is the strongest, which is close to 50:50. Table 1 shows that the extent of mixing increases with the decrease of the distance between the dye and the surface of TiO2, and the strongest mixing is obtained when the distance is about 1.6 Å. This conclusion stands no matter whether the dye acts as the H-bond donor or acceptor, whether the dyes are different (7-CNvs.6,7-CN), and whether the functional groups on the surface of TiO2 are different (OH vs. F). It is also independent of the orientation of the dye on the surface of TiO2 (the orientations of the coumarins on the surface of TiO2 for A, B, C, D-1, D-2 and F are very different). The coupling between a dye and a semiconductor can cause the broadening and splitting of the dye LUMO,24,36 In fact, according to the Newns–Anderson model,23,24 one can estimate the injection rate by simply considering the broadening of the dye's LUMO projected density of state (PDOS), relative to the LUMO of the free dye.40,41

Another factor which affects the ET efficiency of a dye adsorbed on a semiconductor is the maximum absorption wavelength of the dye. The maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) can be determined by the energy difference between the dye's LUMO and HOMO. The calculated λmaxs for complex A, B, C, D-1, D-2 and F shown in Fig. 6 are almost the same (∼280 nm). According to the previous study,14 the formation of a H-bond with a dye acting as the H-bond donor increases the energies of the dye's HOMO and LUMO, and the opposite is true for the dye acting as a H-bond acceptor. The energy difference between the dye's LUMO and HOMO change little no matter whether the dye acts as a H-bond donor or acceptor.
Based on the above discussion, the increase in the photo-induced charge separation on F–TiO2 compared with that on TiO2 can be understood. On TiO2, more coumarins act as the H-bond acceptor than donor. Thus, the driving force for the photo-induced electron transfer is lower than that for F–TiO2, and the coupling between the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band states of TiO2 is much weaker than that for F–TiO2. These structures result in the much smaller photo-induced charge separation on TiO2 than that on F–TiO2. For 6,7-CN, the benefits are three-fold. First, because 6,7-CN contains two OH groups, the probability for 6,7-CN to form a H-bond on F–TiO2 is higher than that for 7-CN. For a dye adsorbed on a semiconductor, not all of the dye forms H-bonds, some physisorb on the surface. According to the previous study,14 the ET efficiency of a dye physisorbed on the surface is negligible compared with those forming H-bonds. Second, 6,7-CN can form two bonds on the surface of TiO2, which causes the distance between the dye and surface of TiO2 to be shorter than that between 7-CN and the surface of TiO2, and thus results in stronger coupling between the dye's LUMO and the conduction band states of TiO2. Third, according to the study by Wu et al.,42 dianchoring the dye has a relatively slower charge recombination rate between injected electrons and dye cations compared with monoanchoring the dye. These results explain why the photo-induced charge separation efficiency of 6,7-CN on F–TiO2 is the highest (see Fig. 3).
To further investigate the EPR spectrum of 7-CN˙+&F–TiO2, a simulation of the spectrum is necessary. The ENDOR spectrum of 7-CN&F–TiO2 after 4 min photoirradiation eliminates the possibility that the hyperfine structure is due to the couplings of fluorine on the surface of F–TiO2, because all the peaks detected are due to the proton couplings and no fluorine couplings are detected. To calculate the proton coupling constants of 7-CN˙+&F–TiO2, the complex of 7-CN˙+&F–TiO2 was optimized as shown in Fig. 7. The calculated isotropic coupling constants and anisotropic coupling constants are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. In this figure, only the complex with 7-CN˙+ interacting with the surface fluorine atom is shown. The optimized complex with 7-CN˙+ interacting with the bridging oxygen atom is shown in Fig. S1,† and the calculated coupling constants listed in Tables S1 and S2.† For the two complexes shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S1,† the calculated H-bonding properties are similar, resulting in the calculated coupling constants being almost the same. Thus the simulated EPR spectrum in Fig. 8 is the overlap of two different species, with couplings that are not different enough to exhibit resolved EPR spectra. The strength of the H-bonds increases significantly after ET, as indicated by the significant decrease of F⋯H or O⋯H distance and an increase of ∠F⋯H–O or ∠O⋯H–O, compared with the neutral species shown in Fig. 5. The H-bond stabilizes the radical cation much more than the neutral species, which is consistent with the previous study.14 The simulation of the EPR spectrum of 7-CN˙+&F–TiO2 is shown in Fig. 8. The simulation includes the anisotropic g values and the calculated hyperfine interactions from the protons. The simulation fits well with the experimental spectrum, confirming that 7-CN˙+ is produced in the EPR sample.

Conclusions
The present study demonstrates how H-bonds affect ET efficiency of a dye adsorbed on a semiconductor. This principle can be applied to other conjugated dyes and semiconductors. Most importantly, this study shows that the distance between the dye and the surface of TiO2 after the formation of the H-bond significantly affects the coupling between the dye's excited state and the conduction band states of the semiconductor, which in turn affects the efficiency of the photo-induced electron transfer. The extent of coupling increases with a decrease of the distance between the dye and the surface of TiO2, and the strongest mixing is reached when the distance is about 1.6 Å. When a dye is adsorbed on TiO2 containing a large number of OH groups, the dye prefers to act as a H-bond acceptor rather than donor, and the distance between the dye and the surface of TiO2 is longer. However, the dye can only act as a H-bond donor on F–TiO2, where the distance between the dye and the surface of TiO2 is shorter. Since the driving force is higher and electronic coupling is stronger on F–TiO2 than TiO2, the efficiency of the photo-induced charge separation on F–TiO2 is higher than that on TiO2. This effect is more pronounced for a dye containing two or more OH groups.
The results of the current study are very useful in the design of a photocatalyst for environmental applications. They are also important for the design of dye-sensitized solar cells, because the bonding mechanism and the electron coupling between semiconductor and dye directly impact electron transfer and the performance of the dye-sensitized photoanode.
