    , Accepted 9th March 2018First published on 12th March 2018AbstractHigh overpotentials, particularly an issue of common anode materials, hamper the process of water electrolysis for clean energy generation. Thanks to immense research efforts, up-to-date oxygen evolution electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements work efficiently and stably in neutral and alkaline regimes. However, non-noble metal-based anode materials that can withstand low pH regimes are considered to be an indispensable prerequisite for the water splitting to succeed in the future. All oxygen-evolving electrodes working durably and actively in acids contain Ir at least as an additive. Due to their scarcity and high acquisition costs, noble elements like Pt, Ru and Ir need to be replaced by earth-abundant elements. We have evaluated a Ni-containing stainless steel for use as an oxygen-forming electrode in diluted H2SO4. Unmodified Ni42 steel showed a significant weight loss after long-term OER polarization experiments. Moreover, a substantial loss of the OER performance of the untreated steel specimen seen in linear sweep voltammetry measurements turned out to be a serious issue. However, upon anodization in LiOH, Ni42 alloy was rendered in OER electrocatalysts that exhibit, under optimized synthesis conditions, stable overpotentials down to 445 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at pH 0. Even more importantly, the resulting material has been proven to be robust upon long-term usage (weight loss: 20 μg mm−2 after 50 ks of chronopotentiometry at pH 1) towards OER in H2SO4. Our results suggest that electrochemical oxidation of Ni42 steel in LiOH (sample Ni42Li205) results in the formation of a metal oxide-containing outer zone that supports solution route-based oxygen evolution in the acidic regime accompanied by good stability of the catalyst.
Introduction
The limited availability of fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas has forced scientists and engineers to look for new efficient solar-to-fuel conversion routes and new storage possibilities capable of storing solar energy.1–5 Pumped hydro/turbines are the most efficient electrical storage/production solution, but they are not implementable everywhere and most relevant sites have been already saturated. Hydrogen, a clean energy carrier which shows among the known fuels the highest specific energy density, is easily accessible via water splitting by exploitation of solar energy.6–15 However, electrochemically initiated cleavage of water molecules cannot be performed at the theoretically required (thermodynamic) potential as derived from electrochemical series, i.e. the efficiency of the electrochemical approach suffers from high overpotentials particularly on the anode side. The efficiency and stability of common electrode materials exploited as anodes in water electrolysis cells critically depend on the pH value of the electrolyte. Both performance and durability of electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements toward OER in neutral and alkaline regimes have been significantly improved6,16–28 and are not crucial points anymore. Alkaline water electrolysis can therefore be seen as the most widespread and mature technology. Since water electrolysis cells received particular attention as a component of plants located close to offshore wind parks, they must cope with many special requirements such as resistance against frequently occurring changes of the current load, insensitiveness to interference and ease of maintenance.
Unfortunately, alkaline electrolyzers cannot be set well on greatly fluctuating load, whereas proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are seen as the method of choice for the storage of renewable energy characterized by high dynamics.6 In addition, PEM electrolyzers benefit from higher gas purity and higher efficiency. However, the operation of these electrolyzers requires low pH conditions. It is easy to imagine that the development of anodes solely consisting of earth-abundant elements suitable for oxidative water splitting of acids is a challenging task, especially so when taking into consideration the strong positive potentials encountered in water electrolyzers.29
Transition metal oxides such as Ni-oxide, Co-oxide, and Ir-oxide have been intensively investigated for use as OER electrocatalysts in 1 M H2SO4.30 Recent studies showed that every compound except for IrOx was found to be unstable under oxidative conditions in acidic solutions.31 Generally, IrOx and RuOx are currently the only known materials that can reach 5 mA cm−2 with overpotentials less than 750 mV in acidic electrolytes31,32 with sufficient stability. Addition of a “diluting agent”, e.g. other metal oxides, represents one reasonable and very promising strategy to reduce the price and improve the OER electrocatalytic properties of IrO2-, RuO2- or RuO2–IrO2-based electrocatalysts.33–39 Because of the high acquisition costs and scarcity of both Ir and Ru, future efforts are aimed at the total replacement of these elements by abundant cheap elements. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts solely based on non-precious metals suitable for robust and efficient anodic water splitting in the acidic regime is of the highest interest,31 and certainly represents the shared view of many research groups.
Flat heterogeneous catalysts based on close-packed metal atoms can be seen as industrially relevant (technical) ones.40 Traditionally, we use surface-modified steel as an electrode material20,29,41–43 for electrocatalytically initiated splitting of water due to its high efficiency and stability and because of the fact that it is inexpensive and easily accessible. Moreover, three-dimensional structures based on stainless steel are more or less omnipresent like e.g. stainless steel sponges,44 felts45 (tangles) and scrubbers46 and can be used “as is” for water splitting.46
Until recently, we have failed to render steel in an electrocatalyst that can be considered as competitive with Ir–Ru-containing OER electrocatalysts for water splitting in acids.29,47 In this report, we evaluate the suitability of untreated as well as surface-modified steel as OER electrocatalysts for the water splitting reaction performed at pH 0 and pH 1. Ni42 steel, basically consisting of Fe, Ni and Mn, electro-oxidized in LiOH showed high stability towards long-term usage as an OER electrocatalyst in 0.05 M H2SO4 and was found to be highly competitive with recently developed and significantly more expensive OER electrocatalysts that work in acidic environments.
Experimental
Sample preparation

Samples made from untreated steels (samples Ni42). 
Samples with a total geometry of 70 × 10 × 1.5 mm were constructed from 1.5 mm thick sheets consisting of AISI Ni42 steel. AISI Ni42 steel was purchased from Schmiedetechnik Faulenbach, Wiehl, Germany. Pre-treatment: the surface of the metal was cleaned intensively with ethanol and polished with grit 240 SiC sanding paper. Afterwards, the surface was rinsed intensively with deionized water and dried under air for 100 min at 50 °C.


Ni42Li127, Ni42Li205 and Ni42Li300 sample series. 
Samples with a total geometry of 80 × 10 × 1.5 mm were constructed from 1.5 mm thick AISI Ni 42 steel. Pre-treatment: prior to each surface modification, the surface of the metal was cleaned intensively with ethanol and polished with grit 240 SiC sanding paper. Afterwards, the surface was rinsed intensively with deionized water and dried under air for 100 min at 50 °C. The weight was determined using a precise balance (Sartorius 1712, 0.01 mg accuracy) prior to electro-activation. A two-electrode set-up consisting of the steel sample as the working electrode (WE) and a platinum wire electrode (4 × 5 cm) used as the counter electrode (CE) was exploited for the electro-oxidation. The WE (anode) was immersed exactly 2.1 cm deep (4.5 cm2 geometric area), and the CE (cathode) was completely immersed in the electrolyte.
The electrolyte was prepared as follows: in a 1000 mL glass beaker, 86.21 g (3.6 mol) of LiOH (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to 600 mL of distilled water under stirring and the resulting mixture was filled up to a total volume of 750 mL with the final concentration of 4.8 mol L−1 LiOH. The solution was allowed to cool down to 23 °C before usage. The anodization was performed in a glass beaker (150 mL) in 120 mL of the electrolyte under stirring (450 r min−1) using a magnetic stirrer and a stirring bar (21 mm in length, 6 mm in diameter). The distance between the WE and CE was adjusted to 6 mm. An EA-PSI 8360-15T power source (Electra Automatic, Viersen, Germany) which allows delivery of a constant voltage even at strongly changing current loads was used for the electrochemical oxidation. The procedure was carried out in current-controlled mode. The current was set to 8 A according to a current density of 1778 mA cm−2. The voltage varied during the electro-activation. At the beginning of the experiment, it amounted to 6–6.3 V but was reduced within the first 100 min of electro-oxidation to around 4.5 V. The electro-oxidation procedure was stopped after 127 min (Ni42Li127), 205 min (Ni42Li205) and 300 min (Ni42Li300), respectively. The temperature of the electrolyte increased within the first 30 min and reached a value of 323 K which was found to be constant till completion of the anodization. After every hour, approximately 5 mL of fresh 4.8 M LiOH was added to the electrolysis vessel in order to compensate for the loss which occurred due to evaporation. After switching off the current, the CE and WE were taken out of the electrolyte and rinsed intensively with tap water for 15 min and afterwards with deionized water for a further 10 min. Prior to the electrochemical characterization, the samples were dried under air at 80 °C for 300 min and after the samples cooled down, the weight was determined upon a precise balance as described above. The sample preparation was repeated and 5 samples of Ni42Li127, 5 samples of Ni42Li205 and 5 samples of Ni42Li300 (Table 1) have been prepared this way.

Results and discussion
OER properties of untreated and surface-modified stainless steels
We have examined 5 different steel specimens besides IrO2–RuO2 as potential OER electrocatalysts in H2SO4. Table 1 gives an overview of the samples/sample preparations and the corresponding OER key data.

Table 1 summarizes the electrocatalytic properties of untreated steel samples for the OER in 0.05 M H2SO4. As expected, the specimens consisting of untreated stainless steel Ni42 showed a significant increment of the current derived from the CV/LSV measurements due to onset of oxygen evolution (sample Ni42; Fig. 1a and b). Ni42 exhibited reasonable and stable potentials at constant current density under steady state conditions (sample Ni42; Fig. 1a; green curve). The overpotential amounted to 707 mV (sample Ni42) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.05 M H2SO4 (Fig. 1a; green curve). However, the OER performance of sample Ni42 was found to be sensitive towards repeated dynamic variation of the voltage (Fig. 1b) between 1.2 and 1.9 V vs. RHE: thus, e.g. the current density reached at 1.85 V vs. RHE decreased from 5.55 to 4.16 mA cm−2 (sample Ni42; Fig. 1b). However, the catalyst consisting of stainless steel Ni42 is still at the level of some of recently developed OER electrocatalysts such as Ba2TbIrO6,36 MnCoTaSbOx (ref. 48) and electrodes with 10 wt% Ir0.5Ru0.5O2.37 CoTiP was recently studied49 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and was inferior (η = 971 mV at 8 mA cm−2) to sample Ni42. In addition, non-noble element-containing compounds like CoP,31 NiB,31 CoB,31 NiMoFe,31 NiFe,31 CoOx,30 NiFeOx,30 and NiOx (ref. 30) were found to be extremely unstable towards OER in 1 M H2SO4 and less active with η ∼ 1000 mV at 10 mA cm−2.31

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrode area of all samples: 2 cm2. Stirring of the electrolyte was performed for all measurements.

Whereas the OER efficiency of Ni42 steel is still satisfying, a substantial dissolution of steel ingredients whilst undergoing long-term OER in acids turned out to be an issue. Ni42 steel lost 185.4 μg mm−2 upon OER polarization for 50 ks in 0.05 M H2SO4 performed at constant 10 mA cm−2 (Table 1). This is a significant drawback ruling out the applicability of this material as an electrode in water electrolysis at low pH values. All the elements Ni42 steel is composed of could be determined via ICP-OES (Table S1†) after 50 ks of OER in the electrolyte (0.05 M H2SO4).20,50 The total amount of ions determined in the electrolyte is in good agreement with the mass deficit which occurred in the samples through long-term OER electrocatalysis (columns II and V of Table S1†). As expected, Ni42 steel lost basically Fe and Ni besides small amounts of Mn.
Modeling of the frequency response (0.1 Hz–50 kHz) behavior of all steel samples discussed in this work at pH 1 at an offset potential that ensures oxygen evolution succeeded with the circuit of the so-called Randles cell (Fig. 2a) in which the double layer capacity is in parallel with the impedance due to the charge transfer reaction. Therefore, the Nyquist plot always shows a semicircle. The real axis value at the high frequency intercept can be interpreted as the solution resistance, while the real axis value at the low frequency intercept can be interpreted as the sum of the solution and the charge transfer (CT) resistance (Rct). The diameter of the semicircle therefore represents the CT resistance. The values for CT and solution resistance (Rs) of Ni42 can be taken from Table 1. The outcome (Fig. 2b) is reasonable in light of the results gained from OER polarization experiments seen in Fig. 1. At a significant overpotential of 672 mV (1.9 V vs. RHE), Ni42 steel showed a CT resistance of 2.5 Ω. As expected, the radius of the corresponding circle in the Nyquist plot for one and the same sample decreases with increasing offset potential, which originates from an accelerated charge transfer (Fig. 2b).

OER properties of surface-modified special alloy Ni42
So far, surface modification procedures applied to Ni42 steel which we have shown in previously published reports have not resulted in an electrode that durably produces oxygen in the acidic regime.29 Ni42 steel electro-oxidized in 7.2 M NaOH for 300 min (sample Ni42-300 in our previous report) was found to be unstable towards OER at low pH values.29 We modified the synthesis procedure, i.e. exchanged 7.2 M NaOH with 4.8 M LiOH and varied the duration (sample Ni42Li127: 127 min; sample Ni42Li205: 205 min; sample Ni42Li300: 300 min). Notably, all Ni42LiXXX samples prepared this way exhibited a remarkably low weight loss (20.05–48.7 μg mm−2; Tables 1 and S1†) upon long-term usage as OER electrodes (50000 s of chronopotentiometry at J = 10 mA cm−2) at pH 1. The mass deficit of Ni42Li205 amounted to 20.05 μg mm−2 which represents a reduction by ∼90% when compared with untreated Ni42 steel (Ni42: 185.4 μg mm−2). For ease of comparison, the OER key data of sample Ni42Li205 have been entered together with the ones of known compounds in the literature (Table 2). Degradation of electrocatalysts in acids when oxidative potentials are applied is well known, and we emphasize that even noble metal-based compounds such as IrOx/SrIrO3 show a certain mass deficit after long-term polarization at positive potentials.51 Also, MnOx has been exploited as an OER electrocatalyst in different acidic regimes with pH values in between −0.5 and 2.52 However, current densities were found to be extremely low ≪ 1 mA cm−2 (Table 2) at reasonable potentials and significant dissolution was found. Layered manganese–calcium oxide was investigated as a prospective OER electrocatalyst in 0.1 M HClO4 but dissolved even without oxidative potentials and exhibited poor OER efficiency.53 All representatives of the sample series Ni42LiXXX are efficient and durable OER electrodes in the acidic regime (Fig. 3a–c and S1†). The non-steady state and steady state OER performances of samples Ni42Li127 and Ni42Li300 at pH 1 are similar (Fig. 3a and b). Sample Ni42Li205, however, showed the best overall OER properties (η = 552 mV; Ni42 = 707 mV) derived from long-term chronopotentiometry performed at J = 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b) and reached 16 mA cm−2 at 1.9 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3a; green curve). Even an extension of the chronopotentiometry measurement up to a duration of 150000 s did not change the OER performance (Fig. 3c). Onset of OER in 0.05 M H2SO4 upon all surface-modified Ni42 samples started at a potential as low as 1.68 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3a). The onset of OER upon IrO2 and RuO2 in diluted sulfuric acid differs and amounted in between 1.45 and 1.53 V.37,51 Repeated LSV is a common tool to simulate fast aging of the electrode. The dynamic potential–current behavior of Ni42Li205 did not change substantially under repeated execution (Fig. 4a and b). Under identical conditions (1.85 V vs. RHE), the current density drop after 1000 scans could be reduced from 1.39 mA cm−2 (Ni42, Fig. 1b) down to 0.81 mA cm−2 (Ni42Li205, Fig. 4a). Moreover, sample Ni42Li205 exhibited even slightly better OER performance after 2000 LSV scans (J = 6.48 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V vs. RHE) than after 1000 scans (J = 6.12 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V vs. RHE). High durability of sample Ni42Li205 towards electrocatalytic water oxidation can also be derived from the cyclic voltammetry scans (Fig. 4c). Even after 2500 scans, the OER performance is still at the level of the initial value (Fig. 4c). To exclude that oxidation of the catalyst itself during OER experiments falsifies the evaluation of the OER performance, it is recommended to quantify the charge-to-O2 conversion rate. The Faradaic efficiency for the OER upon sample Ni42Li205 at pH 1 at 5 mA cm−2 (10 mA cm−2) amounted to 91.5% (79%) after a running time of 2000 s (Fig. 5a and b). These are reasonable efficiencies for the OER upon a non-noble metal-based electrocatalyst in highly corrosive media. A similar Ni-based steel exhibited 75.5% charge-to-oxygen conversion41 in 0.1 M KOH at 10 mA cm−2 after 4000 s. Multiple-point nitrogen gas adsorption BET measurements (Fig. S2†) were carried out in order to determine the change in specific surface area through electro-oxidation. In our recent investigations, electro-oxidation of stainless steels in alkaline media did not lead to substantial changes in the size of the specific surface.20,29 In comparison with untreated Ni42 steel (sample Ni42), whose surface area was recently determined upon BET measurements and amounted to 0.354 m2 g−1,29 the surface area of Ni42Li205 was proved to be slightly higher (0.52 m2 g−1; Fig. S2†). This agrees well with the outcome from SEM experiments carried out with sample Ni42/Ni42Li205 (top view SEM images, Fig. 6a–d) which uncover some particles on the surface of Ni42Li205 increasing the surface area.

The topography of samples Ni42 and Ni42Li205 on the micrometer scale as seen by using electron microscopy (Fig. 6a and c) has been fully confirmed using atomic force microscopy (Fig. S3†). Longer usage of Ni42Li205 as an OER electrode did not significantly change the topography of the periphery (Fig. 6e and f).
We determined the polarization data of sample Ni42Li205 also at pH 0 (0.5 M H2SO4; Fig. 7) to make it easier to compare our results with earlier published ones. The substantial stronger current–voltage ratio (in comparison with the pH 1 data) can be clearly taken from the cyclic voltammogram (Fig. 7a) and the chronopotentiometry plot (η = 445 mV at 10 mA cm−2; Fig. 7a). This value underpins the high efficiency of the electrocatalyst and demonstrates the competitiveness of sample Ni42Li205 with recently developed electrocatalysts. The best OER performance achieved in acids at pH 0 upon a noble metal-containing catalyst (IrOx/SrIrO3) was shown by Seitz et al. (η = 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2).54 However, this material was also not 100% stable at oxidative potentials: Sr was determined via ICP-OES in the electrolyte used for long-term polarization experiments.54 A F-doped CuMn oxide-based OER and oxygen reduction electrode intended to be suitable for electrocatalysis in sulfuric acid was recently shown.55 Unfortunately, non-IR corrected data plus a detailed evaluation of the mass loss during usage have not been shown. In addition, the OER activity when derived from chronopotentiometry data was mediocre (η = 320 mV at ∼1.5 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4). Frydendal reported Ti-stabilized MnO2 as a prospective OER electrocatalyst and determined η ∼ 550 mV at 3 mA cm−2 in 0.05 M H2SO4.56
 Fig. 7  The OER properties of surface-oxidized Ni42 steel and RuO2/IrO2 in 0.05 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M H2SO4. CVs were recorded with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Electrode area of all samples: 2 cm2. Stirring of the electrolyte was performed for all measurements. Chronopotentiometry measurements were performed at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Data used for Tafel plots are based on averaged values derived from 200 s chronopotentiometry scans. (a) Cyclic voltammogram and chronopotentiometry plot of sample Ni42Li205 determined at pH 0. (b) Tafel plots of samples Ni42Li205 (pH 1 and pH 0) and Ir–RuO2 (pH 1) without correction of the voltage drop. (c) Tafel plots of samples Ni42Li205 and Ir–RuO2 at pH 1 with correction of the voltage drop on the basis of 50% correction of the solution resistance. (d) Tafel plots of samples Ni42Li205 and Ir–RuO2 at pH 0 without correction of the voltage drop. 
Tafel slopes of sample Ni42Li205 have been determined in 0.05 M and 0.5 M H2SO4 and amounted at higher potentials to 260 mV dec−1 (pH 0) and 339 mV dec−1 (pH 1) and at lower potentials to 127 mV dec−1 (pH 1), respectively (Fig. 7b). Electrodeposited Co-oxide exhibited a slope of 529 mV dec−1 for OER in 1 M BF4− at pH 1.57
Without IR compensation of the data, dual Tafel behavior was found for Ni42Li205 at pH 1 (Fig. 7b) and single Tafel behavior was obtained along the entire potential range at pH 0 (Fig. 7b). Voltage drop compensation realized by 50% compensation of the solution resistance of 4.2 ohms (Table 1) becomes more dominant at higher current densities, results in quenching of the dual Tafel behavior (Fig. 7c) at pH 1 and leads to a Tafel slope of 149.6 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7c). Noble metal-containing catalysts,58,59 especially IrO2–RuO2,30,60 are known for their high OER efficiency in the acidic regime. Commercially available IrO2–RuO2 (sample Ir–RuO2) outperforms sample Ni42Li205, as can be taken from the Tafel lines of Ir–RuO2 which were found to be shifted to lower overpotentials by ∼100 mV at pH 1 and by ∼180 mV at pH 0, respectively (Fig. 7c and d). Recently, overpotential values between 0.27 and 0.32 V for OER upon IrO2 at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 (ref. 30) and of ∼420 mV in 0.1 M HClO4 (ref. 60) were determined and agreed quite well with our values derived from the Tafel lines recorded for sample Ir–RuO2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 7d). Sample Ir–RuO2 showed the same Tafel slope in pH 1 medium as sample Ni42Li205 did but in a lower potential region (127 mV dec−1, Fig. 7b). The dual Tafel characteristics found for Ir–RuO2 at pH 1 (Fig. 7b) when non-IR corrected data have been analyzed were not quenched upon performing ohmic correction of the voltage drop (Fig. 7c). This can be explained rationally by a transition between different OER mechanisms or by different rate-determining steps on moving from low to high overpotential regions. Dual Tafel behavior with a transition from low to high Tafel slopes at 1.08 V vs. SCE was obtained for RuO2 by Lyons et al.61
The difference in OER performance of both samples (Ni42Li205 and Ir–RuO2) substantially decreases with increasing potential, as can be taken from the corresponding Tafel lines, which move towards each other at higher potentials (Fig. 7b–d). At pH 0, sample Ir–RuO2 exhibited dual Tafel characteristics with slopes of 143.85 and 530.1 mV dec−1 at lower and higher potential, respectively (Fig. 7d). The difference in OER performance again decreases with increasing potential and was found to be reduced to almost zero at a potential of ∼2 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7d). Thus, to sum up, the advantage of IrO2–RuO2 over sample Ni42Li205 with respect to current–voltage behavior was not as substantial as expected and, moreover, even RuO2–IrO2 shows a “bleeding effect” (8 μg mm−2; Table 1) when used as an OER electrode in the acidic regime.32,62
The origin of the OER properties of Ni42Li205

Fig. 8 displays the Nyquist plots of samples Ni42 and Ni42Li205 recorded at pH 1. A lower CT resistance was determined at both offset potentials (1.8 V vs. RHE and 1.9 V vs. RHE) for sample Ni42Li205 (1.6 Ω/1.9 V; 8 Ω/1.8 V) when compared to sample Ni42 (2.5 Ω/1.9 V; 10 Ω/1.8 V). On the basis of these findings, it is reasonable to assume that the oxide-based periphery of sample Ni42Li205 caused upon electro-oxidation in LiOH is responsible for the reduced CT resistance and in turn reduces the voltage drop through the outer zone during OER in the acidic regime. The outcome from frequency response analysis is therefore in good agreement with the lower overpotential of sample Ni42Li205 derived from polarization experiments when compared to that of sample Ni42 (Fig. 1a, 3b and 4).

In recent years, the Tafel slope derived from OER polarization tests has been exploited as a descriptor for the stability of materials towards OER.63 This concept is based on two different routes for the origin of oxygen formation during water splitting. The so-called “oxide route” is used for materials that release oxygen out of the metal oxide-containing surface,64,65 whereas for a different group of materials, adsorbed water molecules represent the oxygen source responsible for the OER (solution route).66 Typically, the oxide route leads to a more dominant dissolution process upon disruption of the surface, i.e. represents the source for instability. In addition, these materials exhibit significantly lower Tafel slopes than the “solution route materials”.63 Notably, sample Ni42Li205 exhibited a quite high Tafel slope of 149.6 mV dec−1, whereas untreated Ni42 steel showed a substantially lower Tafel slope value of 87.6 mV dec−1 (Fig. S4†). It therefore seems to be reasonable to assume that electro-oxidation of Ni42 steel in LiOH (sample Ni42Li205) results in the formation of a metal oxide-containing outer zone that supports solution route-based oxygen evolution in the acidic regime accompanied by good stability of the catalyst (Fig. 3b and c and 4) rather than the release of oxygen out of the oxide-containing outer sphere itself. In contrast to this finding, non-pre-oxidized Ni42 steel forms an oxide-based periphery during the electrochemical measurements in the acidic regime that supports oxide route-based oxygen evolution in acids finally resulting in less pronounced stability (Fig. 1b). Moreover, sample Ni42Li205 and sample Ir–RuO2 exhibited similar Tafel slopes in a wide voltage range (Fig. 7b) that might be interpreted as a hint for their satisfying stability in both cases (Table 1).
The XRD results (Fig. S5†) determined before and after carrying out OER tests do not indicate crystalline oxides on the surface of Ni42Li205. This was further confirmed by the top view SEM images (Fig. 6c–f). The XRD measurements were carried out in grazing incidence mode, that is, they were sensitive to the surface (Fig. S5†). While using this technique, we avoided that the beam permeates through the “surface layer” and detects the matrix. The microstructure has been investigated via FIB-SEM investigations (Fig. 9) before and after OER testing. No differences regarding the microstructure of the outer sphere can be derived from the cross-sectional images of Ni42/Ni42Li205 obtained from the FIB-SEM investigations (Fig. 9a and b) revealing that sample Ni42Li205 does not have a classical substrate-layer architecture known from samples achieved from electro-deposition techniques. As shown in our previous report,20 this can be additionally seen as a source of stability during electrocatalytically initiated long-term OER.
 Fig. 9  Cross-sectional analysis of untreated and surface-modified steel derived from FIB-SEM experiments. The accelerating voltage was adjusted to 20 kV and the SEM images were acquired using a backscattered detector (a) and a secondary electron detector (b), respectively. Ga beam settings: 2 nA, 30 kV. 
XPS spectra of sample Ni42Li205 recorded after 4000 s of OER can be taken from Fig. 10. The corresponding spectrum of untreated Ni42 steel has been shown in our previous report.29 The 2p3/2 positions of some reference compounds67–71 are indicated by gray vertical bars. The composition of the periphery of Ni42Li205 derived from the cationic distribution (31.89% Ni, 68.11% Fe) confirmed our expectation that a Ni-containing compound is the predominant cationic species of the surface-oxidized Ni42 alloy (Table S2†). In comparison with sample Ni42, the Ni content was increased from 26.6 to 31.89 at%, whereas the iron content was found to be decreased from 72.4% to 68.11% (Table S2†). Due to the lack of mass loss during electro-activation (Table S3†) and the absence of hints that support the hypothesis that dissolution at least of some ingredients of the steel takes place during activation in LiOH (no coloration of the electrolyte), we conclude that electro-migration of Ni caused by a momentum transfer e− → M+ at high current densities72 to the surface is the most likely origin for the Ni enrichment in the outer sphere of the activated steel obtained during anodization.29 Earlier contributions29,41,73 related to OER upon Ni-containing films in alkaline media stated that γ-NiO(OH) is most likely the catalytically active species. Our XPS findings also unmask γ-NiO(OH) as the driving force for OER on the surface of Ni42Li205 in acidic media (Fig. 10). In addition, small amounts of metallic Ni and Fe (see peaks located at 852.5 eV and 706.7 eV; Fig. 10, right side) were detected. The presence of Fe2+ can be excluded given the binding energies of the Fe2p3/2 core level spectra. The FeOOH species of iron dominates rather than Fe2O3 on the surfaces of Ni42Li205 (Fig. 10 right side,), which agrees very well with a recent operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study, in which (Ni,Fe)OOH catalysts were characterized under OER operating conditions.74

Besides activation upon electro-oxidation in aqueous solution at moderate temperatures (leading to samples Ni42Li127, Ni42Li205 and Ni42Li300), thermal treatment under air has also been applied to Ni42 steel resulting in sample Ni42-950 (12 h heat treatment at 950 °C). The basic idea was to generate a crystalline metal oxide-based periphery, whereas aqueous solution-based approaches carried out at room temperature are known to result in amorphous metal oxides.43 SEM experiments indeed exhibited crystal formation at high temperature (Fig. 6g and h). We expected that crystalline oxides show lower solubility in acids and should therefore end up in lower weight loss during chronopotentiometry experiments as known from the literature.32,75 This expectation was not met. As summarized in Table 1, all electro-oxidized samples (Ni42Li127, Ni42Li205 and Ni42Li300) showed a substantially reduced weight loss upon long-term usage as OER electrocatalysts when compared with untreated Ni42 alloy (Table 1). Sample Ni42-950, however, exhibited almost twice the mass deficit (347.4 μg mm−2) sample Ni42 showed (185.4 μg mm−2, Table 1) after long-term OER polarization in 0.05 M H2SO4. The layer (visible by eye) grown on the matrix upon heating to 950 °C consisted of Ni–Fe oxide (Table S1†) and was found to be diluted during long-term chronopotentiometry. In addition to the disappointing OER stability characteristics of sample Ni42-950, the potential/current behavior derived from polarization measurements carried out in acids under steady state or non-steady state conditions was rather weak (see Table 1).
Conclusion
All known electrocatalysts that durably and efficiently convert electricity at low pH values into oxygen, which is a requirement for their exploitation as electrodes in (PEM) electrolyzers, contain noble metals at least in the form of additives. This work evaluates the suitability of untreated Ni42 steel as well as surface-modified Ni42 steel for usage as oxygen-evolving electrodes in acids with pH ≤1. The Ni42 steel was, albeit not competitive with up-to-date OER electrocatalysts, found to be reasonably active. However, it proved to be unstable during electrocatalytically initiated oxygen evolution in acidic media. As a matter of fact, it exhibited a substantial loss of ingredients when oxidative potentials were applied in 0.05 M sulfuric acid. Heat treatment of the material at 950 °C created crystalline oxides on the periphery, however it was found to be unsuitable to stabilize it towards positive potentials in acid. In addition, this surface modification procedure led to unsatisfying overall OER properties.
Ni42 steel, electro-oxidized in LiOH, represents the best outcome of this study. The sample was found to be highly efficient (η = 445 mV at 10 mA cm−2 at pH 0) and reasonably stable (weight loss: 20 μg mm−2 after 50 ks of chronopotentiometry at pH 1) towards OER in H2SO4. We assume that electro-oxidation of Ni42 steel in LiOH (sample Ni42Li205) results in the formation of a metal oxide-containing outer zone that supports solution route-based oxygen evolution in the acidic regime accompanied by good stability of the catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, similar activity and durability for OER in acids proven by comprehensive testing have not been shown for a catalyst solely consisting of cheap abundant elements.
