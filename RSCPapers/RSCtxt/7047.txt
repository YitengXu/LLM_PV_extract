Here, we propose a facile and environmentally friendly hexane-assisted one-step solution approach for dense and uniform CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. According to the phase diagram of immiscible liquids, n-hexane was chosen as the assistant solvent to speed-up the evaporation of the main solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) during the solution deposition process, thus significantly promoting the nucleation and crystallization process of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 films demonstrated a uniform and dense morphology, and enhanced light absorption in a long-wavelength range. In particular, such n-hexane treatment could help eliminate the residual DMF and greatly improve the thermal stability of the obtained perovskite films. The full solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells using n-hexane treatment exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 11.7% and average efficiencies of 11.3 ± 0.4% under standard AM 1.5 conditions in comparison with 7.0 ± 0.4% of the conventional cells. The recombination resistance of the cells increased nearly 5 times by using n-hexane. These results suggest that this hexane-assisted one-step solution approach is promising for controlling the crystallization process of perovskites to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Lead organohalide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and its mixed-halide derivatives have attracted tremendously growing attention in the photovoltaic field over the past five years1–6 due to their superior physical properties such as strong light harvesting capability,7,8 tunable bandgaps,9 long electron and hole diffusion lengths,10 and ambipolar charge transport.11 With the great research efforts contributed, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these perovskite solar cells has increased from 4% (ref. 7) up to 20%,12,13 which is much higher than that of other third-generation thin film solar cells.1–6 In addition to their excellent photovoltaic performance, perovskite solar cells also possess solution-processable property, which could lower the fabrication cost and promote their wide commercialization in the future.
Controlling the morphology and crystal structure of perovskite films is critical for developing high-performance solar cells.14–16 Until now, there are two solution deposition methods to prepare perovskite films, taking CH3NH3PbI3 as the example: (1) one-step solution deposition directly from a lead-halide perovskite precursor solution,7,8 and (2) sequential deposition of solution processed PbI2 followed by a solution or gas phase exposure to CH3NH3I.11,17 Compared to the two-step sequential solution deposition method, the one-step solution deposition method is both advantageous and timesaving. However, in most cases, the conventional one-step solution deposition method hardly yields a homogeneous perovskite film over a larger area, especially for CH3NH3PbI3.18–20
To date, much effort has been devoted to control the crystallization of perovskite during the one-step solution deposition,18 such as adjusting the concentration and solvent of the precursor solutions21 and using an additive to the precursor22 as well as annealing control.23 For instance, Zhu et al. found that adding CH3NH3Cl to the standard perovskite precursor can affect the crystallization process, thus leading to significantly improved coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on a planar substrate.22 Cheng and Spiccia et al. reported a uniform and dense perovskite layer by dripping another solvent such as chlorobenzene during one-step solution deposition.24 These methods could promote the crystallization of perovskites and result in good morphology and dense films, but involve high boiling point solvents (e.g. chlorobenzene24 and toluene25) or require a relatively long time for annealing (e.g. using CH3NH3Cl22 or 1,8-diiodooctane as an additive15,26).
In this work, we attempted to develop a facile and environmentally friendly hexane-assisted one-step solution approach to achieve dense and uniform perovskite films. Unlike toluene and chlorobenzene which are miscible with the main solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and would involve with the perovskite precursor, n-hexane is immiscible with DMF and has a relatively low boiling point, high vapor pressure and low toxicity. According to the phase diagram of immiscible liquids, when n-hexane as the assistant solvent is introduced during the spin-coating of the perovskite precursor, the evaporation rate of the main solvent DMF would be greatly accelerated due to the highly increased total vapor pressure, thus helping to promote the nucleation, growth and uniform solid perovskite formation. By dripping n-hexane onto the substrate during the deposition process, we obtained dense and highly uniform CH3NH3PbI3 films with enhanced light harvesting in a long-wavelength range. Most notably, the residual DMF in the perovskite film could be eliminated by the n-hexane treatment and the as-prepared perovskite films have higher thermal stability than the conventional ones. Compared to the conventional one-step solution approach, using n-hexane significantly improved the performance of mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells from 7.0 ± 0.4% to 11.3 ± 0.4% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. In addition, we anticipate that this work would deepen the understanding on the formation mechanism of the perovskite films.
2. Results and discussion
In the conventional one-step deposition process, the formation of the perovskite layer is realized by spin-coating the precursor solution on the substrate followed by thermal annealing to complete the perovskite formation from the precursors. This deposition process usually consists of two stages. In the initial stage, the excess solution is spun off due to the centrifugal forces leading to the liquid film thinning. After a transition point, film thinning is dominated by evaporation of the solvent, which depends on the vapor pressure of the solvent.27,28 Then the solution becomes supersaturated, and nucleation, growth and solid perovskite (or intermediate) film formation occur. If we assume the CH3NH3PbI3 solution as the ideal (Newtonian) liquid and that the evaporation rate is constant, the amount of materials deposited at the end of the spinning process on the dry film (T) can be written as:27,28 (1)where c0 and ν are the concentration and viscosity of solution, respectively, ω is the spinning speed, and E is the evaporation rate. In most cases, DMF is used as a polar solvent to dissolve the perovskite precursor, which has a very low vapor pressure (0.52 kPa at 20 °C) and very high boiling point (154 °C under 1 atm). Consequently, the evaporation of DMF and crystal nucleation rate of the perovskite material are very slow in the conventional one-step solution deposition process, thus leading to large elongated perovskite crystal plates and/or submicrometer-sized islands with many inevitable uncovered pin-hole areas in the resulting perovskite films.11,24
To prepare uniform, pinhole-free perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films by conventional solution deposition, the key point is how to improve the evaporation rate of DMF and control the crystallization process of perovskite. In principle, for two immiscible liquids (A and B), the total vapor pressure (p) of the mixture is close to p = p*A + p*B, where p*A and p*B are the vapor pressure of pure A and B, respectively. Consequently the boiling point of the mixture would be lower than that of either component.29 Inspired by this principle, we consider that if a second solvent, which has very high vapor pressure but is immiscible with DMF, is introduced during the spin-coating of the perovskite precursor, the evaporation rate of DMF would be greatly accelerated, thus helping to promote the nucleation, growth and uniform solid perovskite formation.
Given the miscibility of the common solvents, only n-hexane, n-heptane and cyclo-hexane are immiscible with DMF. Among them, n-hexane is the best candidate because of its significantly higher vapor pressure (13.3 kPa at 25 °C), lower boiling point (68 °C under 1 atm) and lower toxicity than those of the other two. Fig. 1 depicts the scheme of the n-hexane-assisted one-step solution deposition process compared with the conventional process to form perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films. At first, a DMF solution of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated on the compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer. After a specific delay time (around 8–10 s), n-hexane was quickly dripped onto the substrate and immediately a brown film formed, which is presumably caused by the great increase of the total vapor pressure leading to fast crystallization of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the conventional and n-hexane-assisted one-step solution deposition process to form perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films. 

Fig. 2 shows the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of top views of the annealed perovskite films from the conventional and n-hexane-assisted one-step deposition procedures, respectively. When no n-hexane is used, the perovskite film is composed of large, needle-shaped crystals with micrometer-sized uncovered areas (Fig. 2a and b). When n-hexane is added at around 8–10 s, the large elongated crystal plates totally disappear and the film is full of interconnected micrometer-sized grains with full surface coverage on the substrate (Fig. 2c and d). In addition, for the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films on the mesoporous-TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer, dripping n-hexane could also help form uniform and dense perovskite layers (Fig. S1†). This demonstrates that dripping n-hexane during the perovskite deposition process could promote the crystal nucleation and growth process and result in good morphology and dense films. It is to be noted that if we dripped n-hexane too soon (e.g. around 6–8 s) when the perovskite solution is far from supersaturation or too late (e.g. around 12–14 s) when the perovskites have started crystallizing, the uniform perovskite film did not form (see Fig. S2†).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these two CH3NH3PbI3 films are compared in Fig. 3a. Both the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films show very similar, strong Bragg peaks at 14.21° (110), 28.49° (220), 31.95° (310) and 43.25° (330), which correspond to a tetragonal I4cm crystal structure of CH3NH3PbI3.5 It is interesting to note that the relative intensities of the peaks at 28.49 and 31.95 are different between these two films. This may suggest a slight change in the preferred orientation of perovskites with the n-hexane addition during the deposition process. Besides, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) at (110) reflection of these two films is almost the same (Fig. S3†), indicating the similarity in the X-ray crystallite size. This means that both the perovskite films have almost the same crystallinity.25 Most notably, these two perovskite films exhibit the same optical energy gap but large disparity in the long-wavelength light absorbance. As shown in Fig. 3b, the n-hexane-assisted film shows significantly increased light harvesting in the long wavelength regime, which could be attributed to the full film coverage and uniform morphology.

The thermal stability of these perovskite samples was investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Fig. 4 shows the DSC curves of the perovskite samples scratched from the solution-deposited films. For the perovskite sample from the conventional solution process, there are clear transition peaks at 56 and 54 °C during the first heating and cooling processes, respectively, which correspond to the phase transition of CH3NH3PbI3 from tetragonal to cubic.5 It is worth noting that there are additional small but clearly visible endothermic peaks around 89 and 148 °C during the first heating process, which are absent in the first cooling and the subsequent second heating processes. These transitions could be tentatively ascribed to the removal of the absorbed H2O and residual DMF in the film. This indicates that there is still a small amount of DMF remaining in the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited from the conventional deposition process even after thermal annealing, which might exist as the intermediate phase such as CH3NH3PbI3·DMF or PbI2·DMF.12,30,31 In comparison, in the case of the perovskite sample from the n-hexane-assisted solution process, none of the above transition peaks appear in the first heating process, while the typical phase transition peak around 56 °C comes out during the first cooling and the second heating processes (Fig. 4b). This suggests that the perovskite film from the n-hexane-assisted solution process has a very different thermal history and microstructures compared to that from the conventional solution process. The absence of the transition at 89 and 148 °C indicates that the use of n-hexane helps to eliminate the solvent DMF. Although immiscible with DMF, n-hexane has a very high vapor pressure and its addition can quickly increase the total vapor pressure of the precursor mixture, thus significantly promote the evaporation of DMF and speed-up the crystallization of the perovskite. The absence of the transition peak at 56 °C during the first heating process just demonstrates the difference in the obtained perovskite films.

Furthermore, we comparatively studied the thermal degradation behavior of these perovskite films after heating at 85 °C in a N2 glovebox for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4c, after 24 h heating at 85 °C, both films demonstrate a new peak at 12.69° in the XRD patterns, which could be ascribed to the PbI2 (001) plane due to the thermal dissociation of perovskites.32 However, for the n-hexane-assisted film, this peak is relatively smaller, suggesting that such thermal degradation is reduced to some extent. This could be attributed to the removal of the residual DMF by the n-hexane treatment. It is reported that the polar DMF solvent can coordinate with PbI2 and form some intermediate phase during the crystallization process of perovskites.31 Accordingly, the residual DMF in the thermally annealed films could likewise form coordination with PbI2 and then the unbound CH3NH3I could readily escape the structure and leave behind PbI2. Thus, the remaining DMF even in trace amounts in the conventional film would accelerate chemical thermal degradation of CH3NH3PbI3.
The effects of hexane-assisted treatment were investigated via mesoporous perovskite solar cells. The mesoporous devices have the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (shown in Fig. 5a), where the Spiro-OMeTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene and used as the hole-transporting layer, and the perovskite layers were deposited by conventional or hexane-assisted one-step solution deposition. The device performance data are shown in Fig. 5a and summarized in Table 1. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of these solar cells were measured with a 500 ms scanning delay in reverse (from the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to the short-current density (Jsc)) and forward (from Jsc to Voc) modes under standard global AM 1.5 illumination.

As depicted in Fig. 5a, the reference device in which the perovskite layer was fabricated using the conventional one-step solution method show a Jsc of 13.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V, a fill factor (FF) of 68%, and a total PCE of 7.4% obtained from the reverse scan, while the devices in which the perovskite layers were treated with n-hexane show a significant enhancement in the photovoltaic parameters. The best-performing device demonstrates a Jsc of 19.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.93 V, and a FF of 65%, corresponding to an overall PCE of 11.7% obtained from the reverse scan. The average PCE tested by fabricating 20 pieces (Fig. S4† and Table 1) of the devices with hexane-assisted films is 11.3 ± 0.4%, which is also much higher than that of the conventional solution-deposited one with 7.0 ± 0.4%. This indicates that the n-hexane-assisted solution process could greatly improve the device performance and reproducibility. Consequently, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. S5†) of the devices prepared by the n-hexane-assisted process exhibits significant improvement in the range of 400–750 nm compared to that of the conventional ones. To rule out the influence of hysteresis effects, we calculated the photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency as a function of time for these cells held at a forward bias of 0.62 and 0.56 V, respectively. The photocurrent density of the devices prepared by the n-hexane-assisted method stabilizes within 240 s and a highly stable power output of 10.3% could be obtained, which is also much higher than that of the conventional one (5.4%) (Fig. S6†). Besides, we also studied the effects of hexane-assisted treatment on the planar devices with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Likewise, the devices with n-hexane treatment demonstrate significantly improved performance in terms of Jsc, Voc and PCE compared to the conventional ones (Fig. S7†).
The improvement in the cell performance mainly lies in the increase of Jsc and Voc compared to the reference devices. First, the enhancement of Jsc can be well explained with greatly improved light absorption caused by the improved perovskite morphology. The higher coverage and condense perovskite film obtained from the n-hexane treatment have higher light-harvest capability than the reference film (Fig. 3b), thus increasing the current generated. Meanwhile, the improvement of Voc can be attributed to retarding the recombination in the hexane-treated devices. Voc can be determined using the formula as:33 (2)where Isc is the short-circuit photocurrent, I0 is the dark current, m is the ideality factor, whose value is between 1 and 2 for perovskite solar cells, and R and F are the ideal gas and Faraday constants, respectively. According to the formula (2), Voc increases with I0 decreasing. We measured the dark current of the two devices. The devices with perovskite films obtained from n-hexane treatment showed a much higher dark current onset than the devices obtained from the conventional process (Fig. S8†). This suggests that the charge recombination in the former devices was effectively suppressed. In addition, we also performed the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to trace the charge-transfer process in these devices. Fig. 4b shows the Nyquist plot of the devices measured in the dark at a forward bias of 0.6 V. It is reported that the middle-frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plots in such perovskite solar cells represents the charge transfer resistance related to the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 with holes in the perovskite or hole transport layer.34,35 The values changed from 2136 Ohm of the reference devices to 12133 Ohm of the devices with hexane-treatment, which means that the electron and hole recombination was markedly restrained when the perovskite layer was treated with n-hexane.
To further figure out the charge transfer process in the perovskite film and the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interface, we performed the photoluminescence (PL) measurement of the films of glass/CH3NH3PbI3, FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and glass/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 6a, for the films of glass/CH3NH3PbI3, the PL intensity increases significantly when the CH3NH3PbI3 film was treated with n-hexane. The increased PL intensity could be related to the decreased trap density36 due to its dense and uniform morphology. Compared to the films of glass/CH3NH3PbI3 without TiO2, the PL of FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 films is generally reduced due to the injection of electrons from perovskite to TiO2. The relative reduction of PL is much more significant when the CH3NH3PbI3 film was treated with n-hexane (Fig. 6b), which indicates effective electron-injection from perovskite to TiO2 due to the homogeneous surface.36 Likewise, the film of glass/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD with the n-hexane treatment showed marked relative reduction of PL, suggesting effective hole-injection from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD. Such effective electron and hole-injection could contribute to better charge collection, consequently resulting in higher Voc and Jsc. This is consistent with the above discussion.

In addition, we carried out a preliminary stability investigation of the perovskite solar cell without encapsulation by storing the devices under ambient conditions with a controlled humidity of about 50%. The conventional devices without n-hexane treatment show a rapid deterioration with the PCE dropping to 5% after 240 hours as depicted in Fig. S9.† In comparison, the n-hexane-assisted devices exhibit a much slower deterioration with the PCE maintaining over 40% after 240 hours, suggesting less sensitivity to humidity, which could be correlated with the improved stability of the perovskite film.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a novel solvent-assisted one-step solution deposition method to prepare uniform CH3NH3PbI3 films by dripping n-hexane during the spin-coating process. The use of n-hexane could strongly promote the nucleation and crystal grain growth of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite by increasing the solvent evaporate rate, thus not only significantly improving the coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 but also enhancing the absorption of CH3NH3PbI3. In particular, our n-hexane-assisted method could help eliminate the residual DMF, thus markedly improving the thermal stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. Taking advantage of these high-quality pinhole-free perovskite films, efficient hybrid perovskite solar cells on mesoporous TiO2 demonstrated an average PCE of 11.3 ± 0.4% and a steady state efficiency of 11.7% in comparison with 7.0 ± 0.4% of the cells from the conventional method. These results demonstrate that this hexane-assisted one-step solution approach is promising for controlling the crystallization process of CH3NH3PbI3 to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells. Although this study focused on CH3NH3PbI3 photovoltaic devices, we envisage that this approach would benefit other perovskite-based hybrid optoelectronic devices.
4. Experimental
Materials
PbI2 was purchased from Alfa Aesar, CH3NH3I from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp., DMF, chlorobenzene, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) from Aldrich, and spiro-MeOTAD from Luminescence Technology Corp., Taiwan. All chemicals were directly used without further purification. Patterned FTO coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 12 Ω per square were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication in mild detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanolamine and isopropanol. The substrates were exposed to UV-ozone for 20 min prior to the spin coating step.
Perovskite photovoltaic cell fabrication
Dense TiO2 layers were spin-coated on the FTO glass and calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. The nanocrystalline TiO2 paste (18NRT from Dyesol Company, diluted to w/w 28.5%) was deposited on the pretreated FTO substrate at 7000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 500 °C for 1 h. CH3NH3I was mixed with PbI2 at a 1:1 mol ratio in anhydrous DMF and stirred at 70 °C overnight to produce a CH3NH3PbI3 solution with a concentration of 40 wt%. For the conventional one-step solution deposition, the CH3NH3PbI3/DMF solution was spin-coated onto the m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO substrate at 2500 r.p.m. for 60 s. For the hexane-assisted one-step solution deposition, the substrate was spun at 2500 rpm and after 8–10 seconds anhydrous n-hexane was quickly dropped onto the substrate. Then the films were dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. For the hole-transporting layer, a Spiro-MeoTAD/chlorobenzene (180 mg ml−1) solution was used with added 17.5 l Li-TFSI/acetonitrile solution (520 mg ml−1) and 37.5 ul tBP. The CH3NH3PbI3-coated TiO2 films were covered with the HTM solution using the spin-coating method at 4000 rpm for 30 s. For the counter electrode, 60 nm thick Au was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed at 0.09 cm2.
Characterization
The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films were measured at room temperature using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) with an integrating sphere attachment operating in the 350–850 nm region. Highly refined barium sulfate powder was used as a reflectance standard. The XRD spectra of films were obtained using a Smart LAB instrument with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å). The surface morphologies of perovskite films were investigated using a SEM (Hitachi SU-8010) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. DSC curves were recorded with a thermal analysis instrument (DSC 2910 modulated calorimeter) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The perovskite powder was scratched off the substrate and used directly for the thermal analysis. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2, calibrated using an NREL-certified Si-reference cell) using a sun simulator (Oriel Solar Simulator 2000). The J–V characteristics, IPCE and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS, ranged from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz) were measured by using a ZAHNER CIMPS electro-chemical workstation, Germany.
