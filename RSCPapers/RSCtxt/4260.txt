    , Accepted 27th April 2021First published on 28th April 2021AbstractLithium–sulfur (Li–S) redox flow batteries (RFBs) have high energy density because of the high capacity of sulfur. To fully utilize its capacity, one key issue has to be overcome, i.e., the shuttle effect of intermediate lithium polysulfides resulting in the passivation of lithium metal anodes. Herein, we introduce two highly soluble small organic molecules, i.e., 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (PySSPy) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh), as adjuvants into a Li–S RFB with sulfur powder as the active material, and a self-healing RFB with alternative reaction pathways is obtained. In the cycling process, some sulfur atoms are inserted into the molecular structures of the adjuvants to generate new active substances, e.g., PySSSPy, PhSeSSPy, and PhSeSSePh, which can alter the redox reaction pathways, accelerate the redox kinetics of sulfur and reduce the formation of lithium polysulfides. More importantly, the insoluble lithium disulfide/sulfide passivated on the lithium metal anode can be reactivated into soluble species which return to the redox reaction loop providing a superior sulfur utilization of 92% in a continuous flow battery. The battery can be continuously cycled with ultrahigh stability (200 cycles in a static battery and >100 h in a flow battery).
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are promising candidates for utilizing intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy.1–5 Unlike other secondary battery technologies, RFBs have one or two flow electrolytes in which redox-active materials are dissolved/dispersed, and their power output and storage capacity can be independently optimized.6–8 Nevertheless, the energy densities of commercial aqueous RFBs are limited (e.g., 25 W h kg−1 for an aqueous all vanadium RFB) by the narrow electrochemical window (<1.5 V) and low solubility (1–2 M) of active materials, which have hindered their wider application despite their unique advantages.9,10 Therefore, endeavors have been devoted to the development of new systems with the potential to yield higher energy density. Among them, non-aqueous Li-RFBs are the combination of conventional static-type lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and RFBs, which employ lithium-ions as the charge carriers coupled with a lithium anode and soluble or semisolid redox species in the catholyte and anolyte.11–16 Not only they have a higher voltage than aqueous RFBs, but also their cost is lower than that of LIBs.17,18 The major challenge for the development of non-aqueous Li-RFBs is to seek appropriate redox species with the desired redox potential and reversibility.
Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) RFBs with a semi-flow state are based on lithium metal as the anode and sulfur-based species as the flowing cathode (i.e., catholyte), which combine the advantages of typical RFBs and static-type Li–S batteries.19–21 Sulfur-based species as active materials for Li–S RFBs can be categorized into two types according to their state. One type is combined with carbon materials, e.g., Ketjen black and reduced graphene oxide, which are dispersed in an organic electrolyte to obtain flowable suspensions.22–27 Although using this strategy can significantly improve the energy density of catholytes, the carbon additives increase the viscosity of catholytes, resulting in poor conductivity and flowability. The other one is carbon-free sulfur-based species, e.g., high-order lithium polysulfides (e.g., Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4), which are directly dissolved in an organic electrolyte. Yang et al. first used Li2S8 dissolved in ether-based electrolytes for a lithium/polysulfide RFB, but the sulfur utilization (∼25%) is very low because it only cycles between solid sulfur and Li2S4, not including the insoluble lithium disulfide/sulfide (Li2S2/Li2S), called “dead sulfur”.28 These low-order lithium polysulfides are inactive and cannot contribute capacity in subsequent cycles. Meanwhile, they deposit on both lithium and cathode (carbon felt) electrodes, resulting in a “dead region” that cannot participate in electron transfer. The appearance of lithium disulfide/sulfide is the main cause of fast capacity decay and loss of electrochemical activity of electrodes.
To address the above challenges, two options have been developed for material optimization. The first one is to utilize mediators, e.g., chromocene or nickelocene, or inherently generated redox mediators, to increase the sulfur utilization in a carbon-free sulfur catholyte system to ∼80%.29–32 The second one is to reactivate the dead sulfide species in the cell. Jin et al. proposed a strategy to reactivate dead sulfide species on the surface of a lithium metal anode and carbon felt by reacting them with solid sulfur powder.33 Heating (70 °C) and continuous stirring are required in the reactivation process due to the low solubility of sulfur in the electrolyte, and it is also an intermittent process. To further increase the sulfur utilization and reactivate lithium disulfide/sulfide on the lithium metal anode simultaneously, we propose a new strategy to use organodisulfide/diselenide as “adjuvants” in the catholyte to serve a dual role. In this strategy, the intrinsic redox reactions of sulfur can be fully subverted during the charge and discharge processes, increasing the sulfur utilization. The adjuvants supply an appropriate chemical structure to accommodate sulfur atoms, preventing the formation of polysulfides, and fundamentally solving the problem of “dead sulfur” and “dead regions” on both electrodes.
In this contribution, we report a self-healing Li–S RFB with alternative reaction pathways by utilizing two organic small molecules, i.e., 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (PySSPy) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) as adjuvants. In the comparison with other organics (e.g., dimethyl disulfide and viologen), PySSPy has a higher working voltage (∼2.5 V) and faster kinetics than dimethyl disulfide.34 Meanwhile, PySSPy and PhSeSePh have much higher solubility (PySSPy > 5.0 M and PhSeSePh > 1.5 M) than viologen (∼40 mM) in the electrolyte.31 Unlike redox targeting-based Li-RFBs,35,36 the active material (sulfur) which is stored in an external tank can insert into the molecular structures of the adjuvants to form some new molecules, e.g., PySSSPy, PhSeSSPy, and PhSeSSePh. The inserted sulfur atoms are converted to Li2S directly in the absence of high-order lithium polysulfides. Apart from that, the insoluble lithium disulfide/sulfide that covers the surface of the lithium metal anode could be reactivated and returned to the catholyte. This strategy leads to an unprecedented capacity and energy density (742 W h L−1) of Li–S RFBs, which can continuously be cycled with ultrahigh stability.
Results and discussion
Configuration of the self-healing Li–S RFB
A Li–S RFB with self-healing function is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a, in which a special reservoir with two storage tanks (I and II) is used. Soluble active materials, i.e., PySSPy and PhSeSePh, are dissolved in the supporting electrolyte that can flow freely in the two tanks and enter the electrochemical cell through the circulation of the pump for oxidation/reduction reactions. Insoluble active materials, i.e., sulfur, are stored in tank I, and cannot flow directly to tank II due to a diaphragm between tank I and tank II. In tank I, through chemical/insertion reactions with soluble active materials, insoluble active materials can be transformed into some new active materials, e.g., PySSSPy, Li2Sx (x ≥ 4), etc., which can dissolve into the supporting electrolyte, and then enter the cell for electrochemical reactions. After that, the generated solid products can be returned to tank I by the peristaltic pump.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of a self-healing Li–S RFB with two storage tanks (I and II). (b) A single Li–S RFB without adjuvants. (c) Self-healing process. 
For a single Li–S RFB, active materials, e.g., Li2Sx (x ≥ 4) dissolved in the supporting electrolyte, shuttle to the surface of the lithium metal anode during the charge process and further react with lithium to generate insoluble lithium disulfide/sulfide (Fig. 1b). Since these insoluble species cannot return to the catholyte, they cannot contribute capacity in the following cycles which results in fast capacity decay. In contrast, in the self-healing Li–S RFB (Fig. 1c), some sulfur atoms can be directly converted into Li2S by using PySSPy and PhSeSePh as adjuvants; therefore, only a small amount of Li2Sx (x ≥ 4) could shuttle to the lithium metal anode. More notably, the insoluble lithium disulfide/sulfide passivated on the lithium metal anode, called dead sulfur species, can be reactivated by PySSPy to generate soluble species, and returned to the catholyte, increasing the cycle life of the battery. All in all, the main reactions of the self-healing Li–S RFB can be divided into two parts, which are shown in Fig. S1.† One part (chemical reactions) occurs in the tank, e.g., solid sulfur is reduced by PhSeLi. The other part (electrochemical reactions) occurs in the cell, e.g., PySSSPy is reduced to PySLi and Li2S.
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained for PySSPy/PhSeSePh and sulfur to investigate their potentials and relationship in the supporting electrolyte. As observed in Fig. 2a, PySSPy and PhSeSePh display two half-wave potentials (E1/2) at ∼2.5 and ∼2.2 V (vs. Li/Li+), respectively. However, sulfur exhibits a half-wave potential at ∼2.2 V (vs. Li/Li+). Accordingly, Li2S can be oxidized by PySSPy because E1/2 (PySSPy/PySLi) > E1/2 (S/Li2S). An auxiliary experiment was carried out to confirm this. Li2S powder was added to the PySSPy solution, it gradually disappeared and the colour of the solution changed from colourless to light yellow (Fig. 2b). It demonstrates that the insoluble Li2S was oxidized to Li2S4 which was confirmed by the strong peak of S42− measured by UV-vis (Fig. 2b). Thereby, PySSPy can turn insoluble Li2S which covers the surface of the lithium metal anode to soluble polysulfides in a real Li–S RFB. In contrast, PhSeSePh plays an opposite role. When solid sulfur powder was dispersed in a PhSeLi solution, the colour of the solution turned dark orange due to the formation of Li2S6 and PhSeSePh, which was also confirmed by UV-vis analysis (Fig. 2b). The two possible chemical reactions between PySSPy/PhSeLi and S/Li2S can be written as follows: PySSPy + Li2S → PySLi + Li2S4(1) PhSeLi + S → PhSeSePh + Li2S6(2)

(b) UV-vis spectra of the PhSeLi/PySSPy solution before and after mixing with S/Li2S. (The inset picture shows the 0.5 M PhSeLi and 0.25 M PySSPy solution before and after mixing with sulfur and Li2S, respectively. Mixtures: 250 μL 0.5 M PhSeLi + 1.0 mg sulfur, 250 μL 0.25 M PySSPy + 1.4 mg Li2S. These solutions were diluted 250 times for UV-vis analysis.) 
Electrochemical performance
Although both PySSPy and PhSeSePh are highly soluble in an ether-based electrolyte [1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 0.3 M lithium nitrate in dimethoxyethane and 1,3-dioxolane (1:1 by volume)], i.e., PySSPy > 5.0 M and PhSeSePh > 1.5 M (Fig. S2†), the theoretical volumetric (gravimetric) capacities of PySSPy and PhSeSePh are only 326 A h L−1 (243 mA h g−1) and 296 A h L−1 (171 mA h g−1), respectively, which are less by an order of magnitude than that of sulfur, 3467 A h L−1 (1675 mA h g−1) (Fig. 3a). In addition, it is difficult to use sulfur alone as the active material in Li-RFBs because of the challenges such as the shuttle of lithium polysulfides and the poor solubility of sulfur in the electrolyte (∼5 × 10−3 M).37 Combining PySSPy/PhSeSePh and sulfur can not only increase the volumetric capacity of PySSPy/PhSeSePh, but also change the reaction pathways of sulfur and improve its utilization in Li–S RFBs.

(b) The first discharge/charge profiles of catholyte-1 and catholyte-2 at a current density of 0.3 mA cm−2. (c) Cycling performances of catholyte-1 and catholyte-2 at 1.0 mA cm−2 (catholyte-1: 110 g L−1 PySSPy + 166 g L−1 PhSeSePh, catholyte-2: 110 g L−1 PySSPy + 166 g L−1 PhSeSePh + 50 g L−1 sulfur, CE: coulombic efficiency). 
The difference in volumetric capacities between sulfur-free catholyte-1 and sulfur-containing catholyte-2 was evaluated in a static-type cell. When the working electrolyte contains only 276 g L−1 organic active materials (110 g L−1 PySSPy + 166 g L−1 PhSeSePh), its volumetric capacity is only 42.2 A h L−1 (Fig. 3b, gray line) and the capacity retention rate of catholyte-1 over 200 cycles is 88.9% (Fig. 3c, gray line). When containing 50 g L−1 sulfur, the volumetric capacity of catholyte-2 (110 g L−1 PySSPy + 166 g L−1 PhSeSePh + 50 g L−1 sulfur) could reach up to 120.7 A h L−1 (Fig. 3b, dark cyan line), suggesting that the addition of sulfur can significantly increase the volumetric capacity of the catholyte. As presented in Fig. 3c, a high capacity retention rate (80%, dark cyan line) with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency (CE) (deep pink line) was obtained.
Electrochemical performances of the self-healing Li–S RFB were further investigated using a flow battery system (Fig. S3†) under continuous flow conditions. The first discharge–charge profiles of 15 mM PySSPy + PhSeSePh are shown in Fig. 4a. Two discharge/charge plateaus are observed, which are consistent with the two oxidation/reduction potentials of PySSPy and PhSeSePh in the CV (Fig. 2a). The first cell areal discharge and charge capacities are 2.37 and 2.14 mA h cm−2, respectively. The capacity retention is 87.2% with a high CE of ∼100% and stable voltage curves after 11 cycles (Fig. S4†). After adding 9 mg solid sulfur powder into tank I, an obvious voltage slope appears between the two discharge voltage plateaus of PySSPy and PhSeSePh. Additionally, the cell areal discharge and charge capacities reach up to 6.80 and 6.46 mA h cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4a), meaning the discharge and charge capacities of sulfur are 1543 and 1504 mA h g−1, respectively. It should be noted that the sulfur utilization in the self-healing Li–S RFB is 92% (1543/1675 × 100%; the theoretical capacity of sulfur is 1675 mA h g−1). Furthermore, compared with some typical aqueous RFBs, the non-aqueous Li–S RFB has an ideal energy density (Fig. S5†).

(b) Areal capacity retention and voltage curves of 15 mM PySSPy + PhSeSePh with 5 mg sulfur in tank I at 0.6 mA cm−2. (c) Comparison of the areal capacity retention rates of the Li–S RFB with/without adjuvants at 0.6 mA cm−2. (d) Voltage curves and areal capacity retention of 15 mM PySSPy + PhSeSePh with 5 mg sulfur in tank I at various current densities. The volume of the supporting electrolyte is 6 mL; the flow rate is 12 mL min−1. 
The cycling performance of PySSPy + PhSeSePh with solid sulfur powder in tank I was also evaluated in the flow battery system. As can be seen in Fig. 4b, the areal capacity retention of the self-healing Li–S flow battery is 88.8% with a stable charge–discharge curve and a high CE of >95% after 8 cycles (>100 h). The stable cycling performance of the flow battery is mainly attributed to the PySSPy and PhSeSePh added to the Li–S RFB. In order to evaluate the effect of PySSPy and PhSeSePh more intuitively, a comparative experiment was performed with only sulfur in tank I, without PySSPy and PhSeSePh. As shown in Fig. S6a,† the first discharge and charge capacities are 1316 and 950 mA h g−1 based on sulfur, respectively, and the capacity decays very quickly during the subsequent cycles due to the shuttle of lithium polysulfides. After 8 cycles, the cell capacity retention is only ∼53%, which is much less than that of the self-healing Li–S RFB (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, a lower concentration (5 mM) of adjuvants was also investigated, and a capacity retention of 86.8% was obtained after 8 cycles (Fig. S7†). Although the capacity retention of the cell is slightly decreased upon reducing the concentration of adjuvants, compared with the cell without adjuvants, the cell’s capacity retention is still significantly improved (Fig. S7†), indicating that the addition of the adjuvants greatly improves the cycling stability of the Li–S RFB. Different current densities (0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mA cm−2) were set to further evaluate the electrochemical performance of the self-healing Li–S flow battery, which also shows stable voltage curves and capacity retention (Fig. 4d). After 5 cycles, the current density returned to 0.3 mA cm−2, and the areal capacity remained basically unchanged compared with the first cycle. All of these results strongly demonstrate the great superiority of adjuvants in promoting sulfur utilization and stabilizing sulfur electrochemistry for high-performance Li–S RFBs. A higher mass loading of active materials (27 mg cm−2) was also evaluated in the continuous flow cell (Fig. S8†). A complete discharge needs 62.7 h at 0.6 mA cm−2, and the cell discharge capacity can reach up to 62.6 mA h−1. Some amorphous solid materials in tank I can be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which were collected at the end of discharging (Fig. S8,† the inset picture). Furthermore, there are no obvious solid particles remaining on the carbon felt electrode of a fully-discharged/charged flow cell (Fig. S9†), indicating that more solid active materials are brought into tank I.
Exploration of the lithium anode surface
SEM was adopted to explore the surface of the lithium anode with/without PySSPy + PhSeSePh in a continuous flow test. Fig. 5a and b show the surface of the lithium anode with PySSPy + PhSeSePh; it is relatively smooth with only a small amount of sulfur species distributed on it (Fig. 5d and e). In contrast, the lithium anode surface without PySSPy + PhSeSePh is very rough (Fig. 5c), and much more sulfur species are distributed on the lithium anode surface (Fig. 5f). The sulfur species on the lithium surface without PySSPy + PhSeSePh were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S10,† some soluble lithium polysulfides Li2Sx (x ≥ 4) and insoluble lithium disulfide/sulfide can be verified. Without the adjuvants in the catholyte, more lithium polysulfides shuttle to and react with the lithium anode to form insoluble sulfur species in Li–S RFBs. The above results indicate that the adjuvants can effectively alleviate the problem of the shuttle of lithium polysulfides. One reason for this is the change of the reaction pathway of sulfur in the Li–S flow battery to reduce the production of intermediate lithium polysulfides, and the other is that PySSPy reactivates some insoluble active materials deposited on the surface of the lithium anode, which can return to the catholyte and continue to provide capacity as active materials, playing a role in healing the surface of the lithium metal anode.

Analysis of organic molecules in the redox process
The changes of organic molecules in the continuous flow cell were further analyzed and identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS), which has been regarded as an effective tool for the quantitative and qualitative analyses of organic products in static-type battery research.38 Catholytes were taken from tank II at different stages and their photographs are presented in Fig. S11.† The total ion current (TIC) spectra and the corresponding voltage profiles are shown in Fig. 6a. In the initial discharge process, a small amount of sulfur atoms can insert into the molecular structures of PySSPy and PhSeSePh to generate new organic molecules PySSSPy (stage 1–3)/PySSSePh (stage 2–3), and the corresponding peak can be seen clearly in the partially enlarged TIC spectra (Fig. S12†). In the fourth stage, the peaks of these new substances are basically unobservable, suggesting that PySSSPy and PySSSePh have relatively high reduction potential, and are reduced to PySLi, Li2S, and PhSeLi from stage 1 to stage 4. Additionally, the peak intensity of PhSeSePh remains basically unchanged in stage 4–6, because PhSeLi can react with sulfur in tank I to produce PhSeSePh and Li2S6. In the charging process, PhSeLi and some Li2S can be oxidized to PhSeSSePh/PhSeSePh in stage 8–10. In addition, PhSeSSPy is first observed in stage 12, and increases in the last two stages. PySSSPy is mainly generated in stage 12 up to the final reaction stage. All in all, some sulfur atoms are inserted in the molecular structures of PySSPy and PhSeSePh, not only in the discharge process but also in the charge process.

(c) Schematic illustration of the reaction pathway of Li–S RFBs. 
The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) results of organic molecules are shown in Fig. 6b, which were extracted from the TICs based on the corresponding m/z of the target analyte. Six types of negatively protonated molecular ions with m/z values of 221.0205, 267.9694, 313.9110, 252.9960, 299.9431, and 345.8834 were identified, corresponding to PySSPy, PySSePh, PhSeSePh, PySSSPy, PySSSePh, and PhSeSSePh, respectively. In addition to these, PySSSSePh (331.9130, m/z) and PySSSSPy (284.9635, m/z) can also be extracted from the TICs (Fig. S13†). Meanwhile, some lithium organosulfur/selenium compounds, which are produced in the discharge/intermediate process, can also be detected, e.g., PySLi (112.0215, m/z), PySSLi (143.9875, m/z), PhSeLi (157.9626, m/z), and PhSeSLi (189.9756, m/z) (Fig. S13†). The changes due to the formation of some new substances and organic molecules in the self-healing Li–S RFB were clearly revealed by UPLC-QTOF-MS, which can help comprehend the entire working process. Some sulfur atoms are inserted into the organodisulfide/diselenide structures during the discharge/charge process, which reduces the production of lithium polysulfides and eases the shuttle of lithium polysulfides. For the conversion of elemental sulfur to Li2S, in addition to those intermediate products (e.g., Li2S6 and Li2S4), it also needs to undergo a solid-to-solid conversion from Li2S2 to Li2S (Fig. 6c, left), which is a slow reaction kinetics process due to their insolubility.39 However, the inserted sulfur atoms can be transformed to Li2S directly in the discharge process in the absence of lithium polysulfides (e.g., Li2S6) and insoluble Li2S2 (Fig. 6c, right). Therefore, the kinetics of electrochemical reduction is improved, and this conclusion has been confirmed in Li–S battery research, which used di-t-butyl disulfide as a model co-mediator to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics.40 Simultaneously, the sulfur atoms inserted in the molecular structure of organodisulfide, which also can improve the redox kinetics of organodisulfide, and this has been proved in our previous work.41,42 So, the formation of new molecules (e.g., PySSSPy) is beneficial for both individual sulfur and organic molecules.
In view of the above results, catholytes with high energy density can be prepared, e.g., a 1.5 M PhSeSePh + PySSPy solution without sulfur has a volumetric capacity of 124 A h L−1 in the RFB (Fig. S14†). After adding different amounts of solid sulfur into the 1.5 M PhSeSePh + PySSPy solution, the volumetric capacity further improved, i.e., 332 and 393 A h L−1 (Fig. S14a†). Two catholytes without/with solid sulfur (182 g L−1) were characterized in a static battery, and the solution of 1.5 M PhSeSePh + PySSPy had an energy density of 239 W h L−1, and a higher energy density catholyte (742 W h L−1) was obtained after adding solid sulfur (Fig. S14b†).
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a self-healing Li–S RFB by introducing highly soluble small organic molecules, i.e., PySSPy and PhSeSePh as adjuvants, with solid sulfur powder into a Li–S RFB, which is based on a carbon-free catholyte. Some sulfur atoms are inserted into the molecular structures of PySSPy and PhSeSePh during discharge/charge processes to generate some new organic molecules, which are confirmed by UPLC-QTOF-MS. The reaction path of sulfur in the Li–S RFB is altered due to these new molecules, which can reduce the production of lithium polysulfides, improve sulfur utilization and accelerate the redox kinetics of sulfur in Li–S RFBs. Furthermore, the insoluble species generated from shuttled lithium polysulfides can be reconverted to soluble sulfur species which return to the catholyte. In the continuous flow test, a superior sulfur utilization rate of 92% is realized. After 8 cycles (>100 h), a high capacity retention of 88.8%, stable charge–discharge curves, and a high CE of >95% are achieved. With 182 g L−1 solid sulfur powder in the 1.5 M PhSeSePh + PySSPy solution, the energy density of the catholyte is 742 W h L−1. This study reveals that a solid material like sulfur can be inserted into the liquid active material structures to change its redox reaction pathways in the flow cell, which provides guidance for the design of high-performance RFBs.
