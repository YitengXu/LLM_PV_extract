    AbstractIn this study, we fabricated inverted polymer solar cells featuring titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the electron collection layer and vanadium (V) oxide (V2O5) as the hole collection layer. TiO2 films (anatase phase) were prepared by combining electrochemical deposition with high-pressure crystallization. The low temperature process used to obtain the TiO2 films minimized interdiffusion of Ti and In species between the TiO2 and ITO films and maintained the conductivity of the indium tin oxide substrate. The inverted device reached a power conversion efficiency of 3.22% and exhibited much better stability under ambient conditions relative to that of the corresponding conventional device.

Broader context
Solar cells as a promising source of renewable and truly clean energy have become more and more attractive. Driven by the demand for inexpensive, clean, and renewable energy sources, the field of organic solar cells has grown as a result of their potential low cost, ease of processing, and the feasibility of fabrication on various substrates. In this article, we focus on one of the most important issues in solar cell device development, namely the interface between the transparent conducting electrode and the active layer. We have developed an inverted solar cell using TiO2 and V2O5 films as buffer layers. We applied electrochemical deposition combined with a high-pressure crystallization (HPC) process to prepare the TiO2 layer. The inverted solar cell exhibited a PCE of 3.22%, rivaling that of the corresponding conventional device (3.67%). The devices fabricated using this HPC method were air-stable, maintaining a PCE of ca. 2.51% after 15 days of durability testing in air without encapsulation; in contrast, the corresponding conventional device lost its efficiency completely after 5 days of ambient exposure.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells have attracted much attention in scientific and industrial laboratories in recent years because of their simple fabrication, light weight, and mechanical flexibility.1,2 Since the introduction of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) concept, the exciton dissociation efficiency at the interface has increased dramatically.1 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) which have been subjected to various annealing processes have improved to 4–5%.2–7 In addition, low-bandgap conjugated polymers have also provided high PCEs because of their wide spectral coverage; such systems have great commercial potential.8–14 Although the efficiency of polymer solar cells has improved dramatically, their stability remains an issue limiting their practical applications.
Conventionally, the configuration of a BHJ solar cell comprises a polymer and fullerene blend film sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate modified with poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the anode and a low-work function metal as the cathode. The PEDOT:PSS layer and low-work function metal provide suitable energy levels to enhance the collection of the photogenerated holes and electrons, respectively. Nevertheless, the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer absorbs water from the atmosphere, resulting in its increased sheet resistance,15 and low-work function metals have high reactivity in their oxidized states.16 Moreover, the process used to deposit the metal can lead to its diffusion through the active layer, resulting in the possibility of metal atoms reacting with the polymer to alter its semiconducting properties.17 As a result, BHJ solar cells with conventional structures generally suffer from oxidation of the electrode, moisture diffusing through the PEDOT:PSS layer, and pinholes forming in the metal electrode. To overcome the problems associated with an unstable electron-conducting layer (ECL) and hole-conducting layer (HCL), solution-processed sol–gel TiO2 has been suggested as the ECL and thermally deposited V2O5 as the HCL.18–22 These metal oxides have suitable energy levels for use in devices and high environmental stability. Although the TiOX films are readily prepared through spin-coating of the precursor titanium (IV) isopropoxide [Ti(OC3H7)4], it is necessary to anneal the TiOX film at temperatures above 400 °C to remove the organic impurities and form TiO2 in its anatase phase, which has superior electron collection capability. Furthermore, metal atoms (Ti, In, Sn) will diffuse between the TiO2 and ITO thin films during such high-temperature processing, resulting in altered optical and electronic properties. These reasons disqualify them from being used in plastic electronics. In this Paper, we describe the fabrication of air-stable inverted organic solar cells based on P3HT and PCBM and incorporating TiO2 and V2O5 as the ECL and HCL, respectively. To meet the demands of long-term stability, high efficiency, and low temperature processing of the plastic solar cells, we prepared the TiO2 films (anatase phase) at low temperature by combining electrochemical deposition with high-pressure crystallization (HPC).
2. Experimental
The TiOX films were cathodically deposited at −1.2 V (vs. saturated calomel electrode) from a clear orange solution of 0.02 M TiOSO4, 0.03 M H2O2, and 0.1 M KNO3. The following chemical reactions occurred:23 TiOSO4 + H2O2 → Ti(O2)SO4 + H2O(1) Ti(O2)SO4 + 2OH− + (x + 1)H2O → TiO(OH)2·xH2O + H2O2 + SO−24(2)
Next, we employed the HPC process to anneal the amorphous TiOX films into anatase TiO2 films within a sealed stainless-steel bomb containing distilled water to form a high-pressure environment.24 The TiO2 films were successfully crystallized via the HPC process at temperatures as low as 150 °C—significantly less than the crystallization temperatures used in conventional annealing processes under atmospheric pressure. The procedures used to fabricate the inverted and conventional devices have been described previously.25 Before device fabrication, the ITO glasses (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) were ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol before the deposition. After routine solvent cleaning, the substrates were treated with UVO (ultraviolet ozone cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 15 min. Then a modified ITO surface was obtained by spin-coating a layer of PEDOT:PSS (∼30 nm). After baking at 130 °C for 1 h, the substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The solar cell devices were fabricated by spin-coating blend of P3HT:PCBM on the PEDOT:PSS modified ITO surface. Prior to the deposition, the blend of P3HT:PCBM was prepared by dissolving it in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, followed by stirring the solution for 12 h at 50 °C. The active layer was obtained by spin-coating the blend at 600 rpm for 60 s. The active layer was then dried in covered glass Petri dishes to control the film growth rate. Subsequently, the films were annealed on the top of hotplate at 130 °C for 30 min. A 30 and 100 nm thick film of calcium and aluminium was thermally evaporated under vacuum at a pressure below 6 × 10−6 Torr thorough a shadow mask. The active area of the device was 0.12 cm2. Testing was performed under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 W cm−2) using a Xe lamp–based solar simulator (Thermal Oriel 1000W). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed using a Philips X'Pert/MPD apparatus. XPS/UPS spectra were recorded using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe (ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki, Japan) system. The absorption spectra were obtained using a Jasco-V-670 UV–Vis spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
Because the TiOX film formed through electrochemical deposition was amorphous, it was necessary to anneal the sample to obtain the anatase-phase TiO2 exhibiting superior electron collection capability. As indicated in Fig. 1, when we annealed the film at 300 °C under atmospheric pressure, we obtained only an amorphous film. The anatase phase of the TiO2 film formed when we annealed the TiOX film at 400 °C. Annealing at 500 °C enhanced the crystallinity of the TiO2 thin film. During the HPC process, when we annealed the TiOX film at 100 °C under 30 psi for 2 h, the resulting film remained amorphous. Annealing at 150 °C under 70 psi, however, caused the amorphous samples to convert into crystallized films with the anatase phase. Relative to the conventional annealing process performed under atmospheric pressure, the HPC process significantly reduced the crystallization temperature from 400 to 150 °C. The HPC process lowers the critical free energy required to form stable nuclei, thereby facilitating the nucleation process at low temperature.26 Furthermore, the high vapor pressure developed during the process presumably forms an aqueous coating on the film surface, thereby facilitating a dissolution/precipitation process to produce the crystallized nuclei at low temperatures. The SEM images of the TiO2 annealed at different temperatures are also shown in the ESI†.

Fig. 2a presents UPS (He I) spectra, collected using He I radiation (hν = 21.2 eV), of the TiO2 films annealed at various temperatures. The upper emission onset energy (E1) appeared at 18.4 eV for all of the annealed TiO2 films. The lower emission onset energy (E2) of secondary photoelectrons from the TiO2 films annealed at 150 (HPC), 400, and 500 °C were 4.2, 4.1, and 4.1 eV, respectively; using the relation, ϕ = hν − (E1 + E2),27 we calculated the valence band (VB) energies of these TiO2 samples to be 7.0, 6.9, and 6.9 eV, respectively. These calculated values are similar to those reported previously.28 From the absorbance spectra in Fig. 2b, we estimated that the band gaps of the TiO2 films ranged from 3.2 to 3.0 eV. Fig. 2c provides a schematic representation of the band diagram of the cathodes of the P3HT/PCBM-based solar cells fabricated in this study. The conduction band (CB) level of the TiO2 film annealed at 150 °C using the HPC process was 3.8 eV—a value that is very close to the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM. These well-aligned energy levels suggested that this TiO2 film would function as an ideal electron collection layer.

Fig. 3 displays the structure of BHJ solar cell and current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of inverted solar cells incorporating TiO2 films that had been annealed at various temperatures. The device lacking the TiO2 layer exhibited a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.54 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.15 V; combined with a fill factor (FF) of 21%, the device exhibited a PCE of 0.18%. The cell incorporating the TiO2 film annealed using the HPC process exhibited values of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE of 9.81 mA cm−2, 0.61 V, 54%, and 3.22%, respectively. This PCE is 17.9 times higher than that of the cell lacking the TiO2 layer, presumably because the energy barrier for electron collection was reduced after inserting the TiO2 buffer layer. The devices featuring TiO2 films annealed at high temperature (400 and 500 °C) in ambient air provided lower values of JSC and FF (9.34 mA cm−2/48% and 8.98 mA cm−2/36%, respectively). The statistic results of the BHJ devices and the AFM images of the blend are also shown in the ESI.†Fig. 4 presents XPS depth profiles of the TiO2 thin films annealed at 500 °C under atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi) and at 150 °C under 70 psi, indicating the chemical compositions of the TiO2 layers (34% Ti, 64% O) and ITO electrodes (38% In, 62% O). The measured contents of Ti and O atoms are only slightly different from their expected stoichiometric compositions (33.3% Ti and 66.6% O). The interface between the TiO2 and ITO layers is evident from the regions of growth and decline in the levels of In and Ti, respectively, for both samples. The transition zone of the sample annealed at 500 °C under atmospheric pressure (48–73 min) was much longer than that of the sample annealed under 70 psi in the HPC process (58–69 min), revealing that the Ti and In species diffused between the TiO2 and ITO layers during the high-temperature process, whereas interdiffusion between the TiO2 and ITO films was effectively suppressed during the low-temperature HPC process. The high temperature annealing process led to a serious degree of metal atom diffusion between the TiO2 and ITO films, which changed the composition of ITO and, therefore, lowered its conductivity. Moreover, In species in TiO2 layers act as quenching centers for electrons. The trapping of electrons in the TiO2 layer also has a negative effect on the efficiency. Because the annealing temperature of the HPC process was much lower than that of the conventional method, the diffusion of Ti and In species was abated, leading to a improved device performance.

We performed durability tests under ambient conditions for the devices without encapsulation. Fig. 5 compares the PCEs with respect to exposure time in the ambient atmosphere for our inverted solar cells and conventional solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al). Initially, the conventional device had superior performance (JSC = 9.28 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.60 V; FF = 66%; PCE = 3.67%), as revealed in the inset; nevertheless, this conventional device was very unstable, with its PCE decreasing to less than half of its original value after two days of storage and was totally lost after five days. This rapid decay of the conventional device was due to oxidation of the Ca layer and its poor protection of the active layer. In contrast, the TiO2 and V2O5 layers were not only air stable but also acted as protection layers for the active materials; therefore, the PCE for the inverted cell remained at 78% of its original value after 15 days of air storage.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed an inverted solar cell featuring an anatase TiO2 film that had been annealed using a low temperature process (HPC). With its TiO2 and V2O5 films acting as buffer layers, the inverted solar cell exhibited a PCE of 3.22%, rivalling that of the corresponding conventional device (3.67%). The devices fabricated using this HPC method were air-stable, maintaining a PCE of ca. 2.51% after 15 days of durability testing in air without encapsulation; in contrast, the corresponding conventional device lost its efficiency completely after 5 days of ambient exposure.
