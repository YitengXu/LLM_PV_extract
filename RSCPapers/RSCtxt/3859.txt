To conduct this, we modify the formalism of Rubel et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008, 100, 196602], and use the theoretical concepts of Arkhipov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 1999, 82, 1321] and Knights et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Sol., 1974, 35, 543] to consider vibrational hot states. The effects of band-offset energy and the dissipation of excess energy are discussed on the basis of calculations of the escape probability for hot electrons. Furthermore, we show that vibrational hot state and delocalization of excitons lead to an increased probability to separate geminate electron–hole pairs.
I. Introduction
Organic photocells based on π-conjugated oligomers and polymers have attracted significant attention as sources of natural renewable power.1–13 The cost of producing organic solar cells is less than that of conventional solar cells, partly because manufacturing organic semiconductors does not require high-temperature processing, unlike inorganic semiconductors such as poly- and amorphous-silicon materials. Additionally, organic semiconductors offer unique features: they are easily functionalized, allowing them to be targeted for a myriad of applications; they can be produced as thin flexible films; and they can be easily processed. These features make them attractive from both scientific and industrial viewpoints. However, at present, the energy conversion efficiencies of organic photocells remain low compared with those of inorganic photocells.3 To improve the efficiency of organic photocells, the mechanisms of photocurrent generation in organic semiconductors have been actively investigated. The dissociation of electron–hole pairs (i.e., excitons) generated by the absorption of a photon is a key step in generating photocurrent. In organic semiconductors, which have low dielectric constants, the typical Coulomb binding energy of an exciton at a donor–acceptor heterojunction is a few hundred millielectronvolts,3,9,14,15 which is considerably greater than the ambient thermal energy of approximately 0.025 eV. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the efficient separation of strongly bound electron–hole pairs, such as interfacial electric fields, doping or charge defects, contributions from entropy effects, and structural heterogeneity.16–24 In this paper, we focus on “hot” charge-transfer (CT) states at the donor–acceptor junctions of organic photocells.3Fig. 1 shows a schematic of how hot CT states are generated.3,4 An exciton is created by absorbing a photon in the donor region of the solar cell, following which the exciton diffuses to the donor–acceptor interface. Subsequently, the electron transfers to the acceptor region, where the interface has a band-offset energy because of the difference between the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the donor and acceptor molecules. Thus, the initial CT state immediately after electron transfer is hot compared with the thermally relaxed states to which the electron can decay by dissipating its excess energy. Several groups have reported evidence of a hot CT state, and both experimental and theoretical studies have indicated its importance in the dissociation process of geminate electron–hole pairs.3–5,7,25–32 In this paper, we theoretically analyze the exciton-dissociation process through the hot CT state.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of physical mechanism in organic photocells. An exciton is generated by absorption of a photon, which then diffuses to the donor–acceptor interface. Next, electron transfer occurs to form the hot charge-transfer state, which plays an important role in the subsequent charge-separation process. 
To describe exciton dissociation, Rubel et al. proposed a theoretical methodology based on the Miller–Abrahams transition rate and the rate equations involving particle densities.33,34 They gave an analytical expression for the exciton dissociation probability and proved that, in certain limits, their formalism reduces to the Onsager and Frenkel theories. In the method of Rubel et al., the electric field is considered as a force driving charge separation. In the present study, we consider the hot CT state that are involved in exciton dissociation; therefore, we modify the method of Rubel et al. using Arkhipov's theoretical assumption to take into account the excess energy of hot electron.35,36 A similar physical concept has been proposed by Knights and Davis for thermally assisted electron–hole pair dissociation, which was adopted for the inorganic amorphous material of selenium.37 In this paper, we theoretically discuss the effects of the band-offset energy at the donor–acceptor heterojunction and the dissipation of the excess energy resulting from charge separation as the electron relaxes through the hot state.
II. Theory
We begin by discussing the model, which is schematically depicted in Fig. 2. On the basis of this figure, the dynamics of the particle density in hot states is described as follows: (1.1) (1.2) (1.3)where fhi is the hot-state particle density at site i, ahi is the forward-transition rate from site i to site i + 1, and ahibhi is the backward-transition rate from site i + 1 to site i. Explicit expressions for ahi and bhi are presented later. The hot-state particle density of site 1 decreases at the rate τh→0−1 by the recombination of hot electrons with holes. Furthermore, hot particles transition to the ground state at the rate of τh−1. Conversely, hot particles with excess energy 〈Eh〉 are injected at rate g into the hot state at site 1, as described by eqn (1.1). The particle density in the thermally relaxed state is obtained from the following rate equations: (2.1) (2.2) (2.3)where fi is the relaxed-state particle density at site i, and ai and aibi are the forward- and backward-transition rates, respectively. The particle density f1 decreases at the rate τr→0−1 by the recombination of thermally relaxed electron–hole pairs. Conversely, the particle density fi increase at the rate fhi/τh. In this study, we only consider stable static states; therefore, the conditions ∂fi/∂t = 0 and ∂fhi/∂t = 0 are imposed in eqn (1) and (2), leading to the following matrix representation for eqn (1) and (2): (3.1) (3.2) (3.3) (3.4)where f = (f1…fn)T, fh = (fh1…fhn)T, and g = (g 0…0)T. The particle densities in both hot and relaxed states are obtained as follows: (4.1) (4.2)
 Fig. 2  One-dimensional n-hopping sites model with one hot (excited) state. The quantity fhi is the hot-state particle density at site i, and fi is the ground-state particle density at site i. ahi is the forward-transition rate from site i to site i + 1, ahibhi is the backward-transition rate from site i + 1 to site i for hot particle densities. ai and aibi are the forward- and backward-transition rates for the thermally relaxed-state particle density, respectively. τh→0−1 is the rate at which the hot-state particle density of site 1 decreases because of the recombination of hot electrons with holes, and τr→0−1 is the rate at which the particle density f1 decreases because of the recombination of thermally relaxed electron–hole pairs. 
The escape probability η and the recombination probability θ are obtained from (5.1) (5.2) η + θ = 1,(5.3)where ηr(h) and θr(h) represent the partial contributions of the escape and recombination probabilities for the relaxed and hot states, respectively. From eqn (4) and (5), we see that the escape and recombination probabilities are independent of the parameter g. To calculate the escape probability, we use the Miller–Abrahams rate for electron transfer between the relaxed states:33,38 (6.1) (6.2)where a0 is a constant related to quantum tunneling, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Ei is the energy of site i. The explicit expression for Ei is given in the following section. Next, to describe the hot states, we use the theoretical concept of Arkhipov et al. whereby hot excitons (bound electron–hole pairs) are assumed to be surrounded by a vibrational bath that absorbs the excess energy.35,36 Knights et al. have also proposed the thermally assisted free-carrier generation process in inorganic material.37 If a band-offset energy Eoffset exists between the donor and acceptor LUMO levels at the donor–acceptor interface of the photocell (as shown in Fig. 1), electrons injected from the acceptor side have excess energy comparable with the band-offset energy. Thus, we consider hot electrons to be situated in a vibrational bath and to have excess energy 〈Eh〉 = Eoffset. Here, we assume that the dissipations of excess energy occur on-site, as seen in Fig. 2, because the vibrational hot states are considered as local phenomena. These considerations lead to the following rates with the local temperature of Eoffset + kBT for hot states: (7.1) (7.2) We can obtain analytical expressions for the matrix elements of A−1 by inverting the tridiagonal matrix (see Appendix): (8.1) (8.2) The escape probability is described using eqn (5.1) and (8.2) as follows: η = ηr + ηh,(9.1) (9.2) ηh = −ahn[Bh−1]n1,(9.3)where ηr and ηh are the partial contributions of the escape probability η for the relaxed and hot states, respectively. The recombination probability θ is similarly obtained from eqn (5.2) and (8.1) as follows: θ = θr + θh,(10.1) (10.2) (10.3)where θr (θh) is the partial contribution of the recombination probability for the relaxed (hot) state.
We now compare eqn (10.2) with the following recombination probability derived by Rubel et al.: (11)Eqn (10.2) reduces to Rubel's expression (11) in the single-state model without hot states. Therefore, eqn (10.2) is similar eqn (11) but accounts for the hot states. From eqn (4.1), the hot-state particle density of site s is −[Bh−1]s1g; therefore, the particle generation rate is proportional to −[Bh−1]s1/τh, where τh is the relaxation time for particles that relax from the hot state to the relaxed state. Thus, because the model depicted in Fig. 2 accounts for relaxation from every site, eqn (10.2) contains all contributions from the hot states. Note also that Onsager and Frenkel theories often constitute a starting point for discussing the dissociation efficiency of geminate electron–hole pairs.39–43 Rubel et al. showed that ηRubel, which is obtained from ηRubel = 1 − θRubel, reduces to the Onsager and Frenkel expressions in some limiting cases,33 which indicates that the escape probability given by eqn (9) also reduces to these same expressions from Onsager and Frenkel.
III. Calculations and discussions
In this section, we present results calculated using the model described in Section II. The following Coulomb potential with the dielectric constant εs is employed to obtain the energy level Ei for site i: (12) Here, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and Ri gives the position of site i. In this study, to focus on the effects of the hot states, we consider the case of no external electric field. We use an initial separation distance of 8.5 Å for the electron–hole pair, and the distance between neighboring sites is 10 Å. We use 30 sites, which is sufficient to completely separate the electron–hole pairs in a material with a dielectric constant of εs = 3.0 and at room temperature (T = 300 K). Additionally, we use τr→0 = 100 ps, τh→0 = 100 ps, and a0−1 = 10 fs for the parameters of the simulation. To begin, we show the escape probabilities in Fig. 3 as a function of band-offset energy Eoffset and dissipation time τh. In Fig. 3, the vertical axes denote the offset energy, and the horizontal axes denote the dissipation time. The probability is denoted by color: red (blue) indicates high (low) escape probability for hot electrons. Fig. 3(a) shows that larger band-offset energies and longer dissipation times yield higher escape probabilities; however, the band-offset energy seems to more strongly influence the disassociation of electron–hole pairs than does the dissipation time. Even if a system has long dissipation times, the escape probabilities are low in the case of small band-offset energy. Higher band-offset energies are required to overcome the strong binding energy of excitons in organic semiconductors, which have low dielectric constants. Furthermore, we show the results for ηr and ηh in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively, where ηr (ηh) represents the contribution to the escape probability from relaxed (hot) states. In Fig. 3(b), ηr is significantly low for all band-offset energies and dissipation times considered. Conversely, the results shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c) are similar, which suggests that the dissociation of a geminate electron–hole pair occurs through the hot states. For example, for a band-offset energy of 0.35 eV and a dissipation time of 2.0 ps, we obtain an escape probability of 0.242, where the contributions from the relaxed and hot states are 0.068 and 0.174, respectively. Thus, the hot states serve as a path for the separation process of excitons.

We discuss how delocalization affects the charge-separation process.30,44 In eqn (12), electrons and holes are represented by point charges; however, in organic semiconductors, they are delocalized to degrees that depend on their local environment. To consider the delocalization effect, we use the following energy-level model: (13)where r is the position of the delocalized hole in an oligomer (molecule). Ri is the position of site i, which is perpendicularly located against the π-conjugation plane on the center of the oligomer. This paper assumes that electron is localized on the sites for simplicity, and therefore the position of electron can be described by Ri. ϕHOMO(r) is the wave function of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the oligomer. Here, we employ methyl-thiophene hexamer described in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The HOMO orbital is obtained by the HF/6-31G* quantum chemistry technique. We execute the numerical integrations on r over the whole space to calculate eqn (13), because of the assumption that hole is delocalized over the HOMO orbital. The recursive computation technique based on Gaussian-basis set is employed for the estimations.45 The energy levels obtained from eqn (13) are shown by open circles in Fig. 4(a) and, for comparison, the energy levels calculated using eqn (12) are shown by black circles. The escape probabilities obtained from eqn (12) and (13) are shown by the dashed and solid lines in Fig. 4(b), respectively, as a function of band-offset energies. For these calculations, we use an energy-dissipation time of 2.0 ps, with the other parameters being the same as those used to produce Fig. 3. Fig. 4(b) allows us to confirm that, for all band-offset energies, the delocalization effect leads to a larger escape probability compared with the results of eqn (12). The binding energies at the initial separation distance are 0.56 and 0.23 eV for the localized and delocalized models, respectively. The smaller binding energy given by the delocalized model gives larger escape probabilities. The energy difference between the first and second sites (i.e., E2 − E1) further influences the escape process. These energy differences are 0.31 and 0.11 eV for the localized and delocalized models, respectively. Eqn (12) gives a larger energy difference, as observed in Fig. 4(a), which inhibits electrons from moving away from the donor–acceptor interface by a random-walk process. Thus, the localization of holes reduces the escape probability of hot electrons, whereas the delocalization of holes enhances the exciton dissociation process.

The results for the localized and delocalized models are indicated by black and open circles, respectively. Inset shows methyl-thiophene hexamer considered for this study. (b) Comparison of escape probability resulting from localized and delocalized models, which are shown by the dashed and solid lines, respectively. 
We now briefly discuss the choice of parameters in this study. The band-offset energy depends on the combination of donor–acceptor materials used in organic photocells. In many cases, the band-offset energies are approximately 0.3–0.4 eV.1,3,46–48 Thus, we adopt herein the band-offset energy of 0.35 eV to obtain Fig. 4. However, experimentally observing the energy-dissipation time is difficult because of short-lived hot CT states; nevertheless, some groups report lifetimes of 1.0 to 3.0 ps.7,49,50 We thus use the energy-dissipation time of 2.0 ps to obtain the results. Conversely, typical exciton lifetimes and recombination times of electron–hole pairs are in the range from about 50 ps to 1 ns,3,51 so we employ 100 ps for the τr→0 and τh→0 parameters. The distance between neighboring sites are determined from the crystalline structure of fullerene derivatives.52 On the other hand, to accurately estimate the a0 parameter, we need to deeply understand the mechanism of electron conduction in organic material. However, at present, fullerene derivatives, which are frequently used for electron acceptor organic materials, are actively investigated to make clear the electron conduction mechanism.52–55 Recent studies suggest the inapplicability of Marcus-like electron-hopping model for the electron transport in fullerene derivatives, and other mechanisms have been proposed.52,53,56–58 We will discuss this mater somewhere.
Finally, we compare our results with those of various theoretical studies that focused on the charge-separation process via hot CT states. Peumans et al. used kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to determine the probability for geminate electron–hole pairs to separate at a donor–acceptor interface.16 In their simulations, hot electrons with excess energy were injected across a donor–acceptor interface, and the results indicated high carrier-collection efficiencies. Tamura et al. combined first-principles electronic-structure calculations and a quantum dynamical analysis to study the exciton-dissociation process.30 They reported that the delocalization of charges and the vibronically hot nature of the CT state both promote the charge-separation process to a point where it overcomes the strong Coulomb attraction within geminate electron–hole pairs. In the present study, we also showed the importance of the delocalization effect and the hot CT states, and the results of our calculations support these conclusions.
IV. Summary
In this paper, we discuss the charge-separation process through the hot CT state. To conduct this, we modify the method of Rubel et al. and employ the theoretical concepts of Arkhipov et al. and Knights et al. to describe the hot state. We begin by showing how the band-offset energy and the dissipation time of the excess energy affect the charge-separation process. This is done by calculating the escape probabilities for hot electrons and demonstrating that the charge-separation process proceeds mainly through the hot states. In addition, we show that the delocalization of hole can significantly raise the escape probability of hot excitons, because the initial binding energy of the electron–hole pair decreases and the hot electron undergoes a prompt random walk.
Appendix
We show here a brief derivation of eqn (8.1) and (8.2). First, we consider the tridiagonal matrix Cn: (A1) The inverted tridiagonal matrix is obtained analytically as follows:59–61 (A2)where Θi and Φi are defined as Θi = νiΘi−1 − ui−1wi−1Θi−2,(A3) Φi = νiΦi+1 − uiwiΦi+2,(A4) Here, Θ1 = ν1, Θ0 = 1, Φn = νn, and Φn+1 = 1. For the matrix A of eqn (3.2), Θs and Φs are expressed as (A5) (A6) The following equations are obtained from eqn (A2) and (3.2): (A7) (A8)Eqn (8.1) and (8.2) are obtained by substituting eqn (A5) and (A6) into the above equations.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of physical mechanism in organic photocells. An exciton is generated by absorption of a photon, which then diffuses to the donor–acceptor interface. Next, electron transfer occurs to form the hot charge-transfer state, which plays an important role in the subsequent charge-separation process.

 	Fig. 2  One-dimensional n-hopping sites model with one hot (excited) state. The quantity fhi is the hot-state particle density at site i, and fi is the ground-state particle density at site i. ahi is the forward-transition rate from site i to site i + 1, ahibhi is the backward-transition rate from site i + 1 to site i for hot particle densities. ai and aibi are the forward- and backward-transition rates for the thermally relaxed-state particle density, respectively. τh→0−1 is the rate at which the hot-state particle density of site 1 decreases because of the recombination of hot electrons with holes, and τr→0−1 is the rate at which the particle density f1 decreases because of the recombination of thermally relaxed electron–hole pairs.
