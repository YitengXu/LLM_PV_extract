    , Accepted 25th July 2019First published on 25th July 2019AbstractMetal oxynitrides show promising activity for photocatalytic solar water splitting and CO2 reduction under solar irradiance. Precise control of cation ratios in oxynitrides is an inevitable challenge that needs to be overcome for achieving effective band gap tuning. Here we report the density functional theory-based calculations for the intricate structure–function relationships of Zn–Ga based oxynitrides and correlate the results with the experimental parameters. Crucial material property descriptors such as elemental composition, intrinsic lattice strain, and vacancy defects were exploited during the synthesis to achieve stable oxynitride photocatalysts that demonstrated CO2 conversion to CO under simulated solar light, without any noble metal impregnation. The highest CO production rate surpassed that of TiO2 under the same conditions. This work inspires future research on oxynitride materials with tailored optical properties and sustainable photocatalytic activity which enables their large scale applications.
Introduction
Solar based CO2 conversion techniques are promising for reutilizing waste CO2 from the atmosphere to generate high-value hydrocarbons.1,2 These processes allow for the harvesting of the abundant sunlight and are a major step towards the reduction of global carbon footprints by the creation of a closed loop synthetic carbon cycle. Amongst the many potential solar processes, photocatalysis presents the advantage of low temperature operation as opposed to solar thermochemical based processes.2–5 However, the major limitations to the large scale implementation of photocatalysis are: poor reaction rates, fast exciton recombination resulting in poor quantum efficiency, and photocatalytic activity can occur only under UV illumination.6–10 The reactivity of the catalysts is usually enhanced by the addition of noble metals or metal oxides like platinum, ruthenium, ruthenium oxides and so forth, thus increasing the operational costs of photocatalysis. Significant effort has been devoted to exploring new materials that are visible light active and exhibit appreciable photoreduction rates without the use of noble metal co-catalysts. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and metal oxynitrides have garnered interest due to their intrinsic capability for elemental composition tuning.11,12
Zn-Based LDHs have shown promising results for photocatalysis.13,14 Zn–Al based LDHs demonstrated CO2 photoreduction to CO (94% selective) under UV-illumination, while Cu doped Zn–Ga based LDHs produced methanol.13 These materials are limited to UV light induced photoreduction, due to their intrinsically large band gaps.14 Nitriding these materials towards the generation of metal oxynitrides has proved beneficial for band gap reduction. Zn–Ga and Zn–Ge based oxynitrides in particular have shown promising results for solar water and CO2 splitting reactions.8,15–17 A high solar water splitting activity was achieved by Zn–Ga based oxynitride solid solutions using noble metal co-catalysts.18 Visible light CO2 photoreduction was observed for Zn–Ge oxynitrides along with Pt co-catalysts.8 Rh and Cr nanoparticle impregnated Zn–Ge oxynitrides also demonstrated solar water splitting activity.16,19 Even Zn–Al modified Zn–Ga oxynitride solid solutions along with 0.5 wt% Pt produced CH4 from CO2 under visible light.20 This ability to harvest visible light is attributed to the narrowing of the band gap due to the repulsion of the Zn-3d and N-2p orbitals in the valence band edge (VBE).21–23 Low-dimensional materials such as these help in improving the photocatalytic efficiency24 when close attention is paid to the architecture and synthesis variables used to form heterostructures for efficient charge dissociation, as we have shown here both experimentally and theoretically.
Through this effort, we demonstrate the enormous opportunity in modulating simple synthesis parameters towards improved catalytic activity. Harnessing the experimental parameters is a natural pathway towards tailoring material properties, as achieved in this study via lattice strain, oxide/nitride composition and vacancy defect tuning of these materials. However, a key limitation of these oxynitride synthesis protocols is the volatilization of Zn resulting in poor Zn2+/M3+ ratios (M being any suitable metal like Al, Ga, Ge etc.), mostly less than 0.3.20 In the absence of an appropriate control of the material compositions of these oxynitrides, tuning of the band gap for enhanced photocatalytic activity is hindered. A systematic study of material chemistry during the growth of these oxynitrides has been conducted. Elucidating the electronic structure–function relationships of these materials and their close correlation with the experimental synthesis parameters is thus of extreme importance. Although several studies have tried to improve the synthesis protocol through the modification of the nitriding techniques,25–27 none of them have yet reported solar CO2 photoreduction over these oxynitrides, without the use of noble metals. We hereby explore the effects of intrinsic structural parameters like composition, strain, vacancy, and lattice spacing towards the electronic band gap modulation of Zn–Ga oxynitrides. We developed a profound understanding of the oxynitride solid solution as a function of the synthesis parameters. Solar CO2 photoreduction to CO without the use of any noble metal based co-catalysts is shown for the first time with these materials.
Materials and methods
Experimental methodology
The Zn–Ga oxynitride solid solutions were prepared using a co-precipitation method that involved Zn–Ga–CO3 LDH precursor synthesis followed by nitridation as reported in the literature.28 The LDHs were prepared by mixing the precursor materials to form a precipitate that contained the carbonate interlayer anions. For the production of Zn–Ga–CO3, stoichiometric amounts of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (98% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) and Ga(NO3)3·9H2O (99.9% purity with trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in deionized (DI) water and dissolved completely. Separately, Na2CO3 (≥99.5% purity, Fisher) was dissolved in DI H2O. The nitrate solution was then slowly added dropwise to 74.5 mL of a 1 M Na2CO3 solution, forming the LDH precipitate. Nitridation of the LDH materials was performed in a combustion dish at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 to 800 °C in a tube furnace (Thermo Scientific Lindberg/Blue M) with a constant NH3 gas flow rate of 300 sccm.
The crystallinity of the samples was probed via X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) using a PANanalytical Empyrean machine with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at a scan rate (2θ) of 0.02 degrees per s. In situ XRD experiments were performed with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro with an XRK-900 accessory at 1000 mbar (∼1 atm) and 10 °C min−1 ramp from 25 to 200 °C in CO2 and air. The oxygen and nitrogen contents of the solids were measured using a LECO TC 600 elemental analyzer according to the “oxygen and nitrogen in nitride material” method. Imaging and elemental analysis were performed using SEM-EDS (JEOL JSM-7500F field emission SEM (FESEM) and Hitachi S800 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with Phoenix energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)). Zinc and gallium contents in the samples were determined by EDS. A Tecnai F20 TEM with a line resolution of 0.102 nm was used to determine the morphology and d spacing of the exposed lattice plane. Optical absorption properties were analyzed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) using a Jasco V-760 UV-visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometer equipped with an ISN-723 Integrating Sphere. Raman spectroscopy data were collected using a Thermo Scientific DXR2 Raman microscope at 10×, with a high resolution DXR 532 nm laser. The laser power was 6 mW and the aperture used had a pinhole size of 50 μm with a 900 line per cm gratin and a 2.1 μm spot size. The resolution was 5.5–8.3 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) measurements were conducted with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument using Al Kα radiation. The samples were prepared in air for XPS measurements and the scans were collected for the nitrided powders before and after UV exposure (F15T8 bulbs at 75 W m−2) to determine their stability with a C 1s binding energy reported to be 285.3 eV.
Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed to probe the CO2 adsorption properties of the samples. A Harrick high temperature-high pressure reactor cell along with a Nicolet IS50 spectrometer from Thermo Scientific was used for the purpose. The samples were loaded in the cell along with the addition of water. The cell was purged off any ambient gases by flowing pure argon (AIRGAS, UHP-300, 50 sccm) for 60 min at 50 °C. Carbon dioxide (AIRGAS, UN1013, 20 sccm) was flowed subsequently over the samples for 15 min. Excess CO2 was purged off by flowing Ar. A temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) study was thereafter carried out with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from 50 to 300 °C. 250 scans were recorded for each TPD spectrum with a resolution of 0.241 cm−1.
The photocatalytic reactions took place in a chemically resistant stainless steel rectangular reactor cell in a network of fluid lines and with analytical instrumentation with a total fluid volume of approximately 73 cm3. Evolved gases were separated and analyzed with an IonCam 2020 gas chromatograph (GC) and mass spectrometer (MS) system, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (SRA Instruments with 99.9999% He carrier gas and Plot Q GC column). The light source used for the photoreduction experiments was a 1600 W Xe arc lamp (set to 1400 W) equipped with a lamp housing (Newport 66870 housing with 3177 heat sink and 69922 power supply), an aluminum liquid filter (Newport 6123NS, 2 inch), a quick change filter holder (Newport 71260) and a fiber bundle focusing assembly (Newport 77776). The H2O filter limited the lamp output range to approximately 280–950 nm. A Newport AM0 filter was used in the quick change filter. A LI-COR LI-200R Pyranometer with a LI-250A light meter was used to measure the global solar radiation output of the solar simulator. The light output measured directly onto the region of the catalyst after equipment passthrough was measured at 589 W m−2 for the 400–700 nm range for all experiments.
Computational methodology
Zn–Ga oxynitride solid solutions were probed computationally by spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations with plane wave basis sets using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP-5.3.3). Throughout most of the calculations, projector augmented wave (PAW) based potentials and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlations were used. For the band-gap calculations, along with PBE, HSE06 and GW methods were used as well. The wurtzite phases of the oxynitride structures were made up of supercells consisting of 32, 48 or 64 atoms based on the composition. A Gamma-centric 8 × 8 × 8 k-point mesh was used for the 32 atom supercells. For larger systems (48 and 64 atoms) the k-point grid was varied accordingly to maintain similar k spacing. The strained structures were created by expanding or compressing the lattice constants. The percentage strain induced in the system was calculated as:  (for vertical strain) and ,  (for biaxial strain), where, a, b, and c are the respective lattice constants while f and i represent the final and initial states of the material, respectively.
Results and discussion
Zn–Ga based oxynitrides were synthesized by a two-step co-precipitation and nitriding process. The co-precipitation process yields the layered double hydroxide (LDH) samples, as indicated by their respective X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1A). They are labeled (Table S1†) as per the initial Zn:Ga precursor ratios (1 stands for 1:1, 2 stands for 2:1, and 3 stands for 3:1). Subsequently, these were nitrided for varying times (10, 20, and 30 min) under an NH3 flow at a temperature of 700 °C. The samples were labeled with respect to precursor ratio–nitriding time (e.g. 2-20 stands for the Zn:Ga = 2:1 precursor nitrided for 20 min). Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for these nitrided samples (Fig. 1B) closely match with those of the hexagonal wurtzite phase. Samples with higher Zn:Ga precursor ratios (2:1 and 3:1) favored better crystallinity as compared to samples with lower Zn:Ga = 1:1 precursor ratios. The effect of the precursor composition in these oxynitrides is shown in Fig. 1C. Increasing the ZnO fraction results in the crystal structure aligning more with that of ZnO (the ZnO position is marked by black vertical lines and that of GaN is marked by red lines). The left shift of the positions, representing the increased d spacing to account for more ZnO content, with increasing ZnO composition is consistent for all lines except for (002). For the hkl plane (002), the position shifted further left compared to that of ZnO, a pattern consistent in all the three compositions. This marks the presence of strained phases along the c axis. Being generated from LDH type structures, it is quite logical to observe oxynitride phases with an expanded c lattice. This result is corroborated by our microscopy and spectroscopy studies as well (detailed later). With increasing nitriding time (Fig. 1D and E), the right shift is coherent with the decreased cell volume due to Zn volatilization. While the shift is prominent in the Zn:Ga = 1:1 sample, Zn:Ga = 2:1 and Zn:Ga = 3:1 samples exhibited almost no variation. The cell volume of the Zn:Ga = 1:1 sample collapsed the most which is attributed to the inherently lower crystallinity of the Ga-rich samples compared to the Zn-rich samples.

SEM and TEM images along with elemental mapping via EDS are presented in Fig. 2. The SEM images (Fig. 2A and B) for the 3-20 sample show disk shaped nanostructures, while the EDS maps (Fig. 2C–F) reveal a uniform distribution of the elements throughout the sample, as is expected for a bulk oxynitride solid solution. The TEM images for 1-20, 2-20 and 3-20 samples (Fig. 2G–I, respectively) reveal the approximate particle size to be within 50–200 nm. The HRTEM images of these samples exhibit the presence of (002) crystal facets. The d spacings of these planes are around 0.26 nm (∼0.258 nm for ZnO), indicating the presence of inherent vertical tensile strain in these materials, as was expected from the PXRD patterns shown in Fig. 1C.

The concentrations of the cations and anions for all these oxynitrides are shown in Fig. 3A and B. Synchronous with the Zn volatilization phenomenon with increased nitriding time, we observed a decline in the Zn/Ga ratio for all the samples (Fig. 3A). Although Zn volatilization results in substantial loss of Zn, samples obtained from a Zn-rich precursor (3:1) showed high Zn:Ga ratios (more than 0.3). The incorporation of N via nitriding is well depicted in Fig. 3B, where the O:N ratio decreases with nitriding time. Major decrease in O:N ratio was observed for samples with 10 and 20 min of nitriding time, however, the change in O:N ratio was less significant from 20 to 30 min of nitriding. This suggests that 30 min of nitriding is not necessary for these samples as it results in more and more Zn-deficient phases, without much additional N incorporation. This evolution of the elemental composition is also consistent with the XRD trends where a major Zn volatilization leads to the shrinking of the cell size of the Zn:Ga = 1:1 sample. Zinc volatilization and nitrogen incorporation in the lattice of these oxynitrides during nitriding are depicted vividly in Fig. S1.† Optimizing the nitriding time (20 minutes in this case) is a key parameter as it reduces Zn volatilization. This decreased Zn content and compressive strain induced due to cell collapse results in the increased band gap for the Zn:Ga = 1:1 sample (Fig. 3C). However for the other samples (2:1 and 3:1), although Zn volatilization occurred (as observed in Fig. 3A), we did not observe a similar lattice collapse (Fig. 1D and E). Reduced Zn content is an indicator of an increased band gap; however, a non-collapsing crystal cell is an indication of vacancy defects being generated and tensile strain being induced. The latter effects are factors of band gap reduction. Because of these two contesting processes, we observe a mixed response on the band gap evolution of the 2:1 and 3:1 samples (Fig. 3C). On the whole, we demonstrate decreasing band gap with increased Zn content, a crucial route to material property tuning in these Zn oxynitrides.

The effect of composition and strain was further theoretically studied via density functional theory-based calculations. Since probing a solid solution structure is computationally expensive and it is difficult to obtain an exact structural configuration, we investigated the vertical stacks of Zn–Ga oxynitrides (Fig. 4A). This provides the opportunity to systematically study the composition variation and also allows for understanding the electronic states at the oxide–nitride interface. Moreover, LDH structures are vertically stacked and a controlled synthesis of oxynitrides could result in alternating layers of oxides and nitrides being formed along the c axis. The band gap variation with composition is clearly depicted in Fig. 4B. While PBE exchange–correlation is known to underestimate the bandgaps, hybrid functionals such as HSE06 and GW are better predictors of the bandgap.29 In all the three methods, we observe a consistent decreasing band gap trend with an increasing Zn concentration. The VBE of these oxynitrides are mostly dominated by the Zn-3d, N-2p and O-2p orbitals.21,22 Thus, a higher nitride concentration (or a lower Zn content) predicts higher Zn-3d and N-2p orbital repulsions at the VBE, thereby accounting for the decreased band gap. This result is in agreement with our experimental results as well. The effect of the lattice strain, a major parameter in these materials, is portrayed in Fig. 4C. Lattice strain in these materials can be vertical or biaxial. Since the vertical heterojunction exhibits the oxide–nitride interface along the c axis, we observe greater effects for the vertical lattice strain. Tensile strain (or lattice expansion) is marked by a positive strain, while compressive strain (or lattice shrinkage) is denoted by a negative strain. Irrespective of the material composition, we find that compressive strain causes increased band gap and tensile strain causes decreased band gap. This is due to the bonding and antibonding orbitals being stabilized and destabilized, respectively, under compression. The antibonding states at the conduction band edge (CBE) are reported to be more perturbed by this variation, resulting in the net increase and decrease of the band gap under compression and tension, respectively.30 Experimentally, the compressive strain induced due to the lattice collapse in Zn:Ga = 1:1 samples along with the loss of Zn (Fig. 1D, E and 3A) explains the increased band gap trend (Fig. 3C). Similarly, Zn loss for 2:1 and 3:1 samples (Fig. 3A) predicts band gap increase, while the tensile strain (Fig. 1D and E) induced in these samples predicts the reduction of the band gap. These contradictory influences in 2:1 and 3:1 samples are the reasons for the observed band gap fluctuation. The effect of this lattice strain on the interface atoms are explicitly presented in Fig. 4(D and E). Along the VBE, the Zn-3d orbitals are aligned to E − EF = 0. The resulting shift in the gap is thus evident on the CBE. The orbitals are shifted to higher energy levels at the CBE under compression, with the vertical strain (Fig. 4E) being more effective than the biaxial one (Fig. 4D).

The nitriding process in oxynitride synthesis from these LDHs is closely associated with Zn volatilization, lattice strain and the introduction of vacancy defects. The resulting effects on the elemental composition and bonding at the catalyst surface were probed via XPS. Fig. 5A depicts the change in the Zn-2p3/2 peak for the Zn:Ga = 2:1 sample with varying nitriding times. Zn-2p3/2 peaks in all of these samples are shifted to a lower binding energy (B.E.) than those in pure ZnO samples (∼1022.2 eV),18,31 due to the bond polarity variations of Zn–O and Zn–N. With increasing nitriding time, less surface Zn is available which is clearly evident from the decreased peak intensities. A slight shift towards a higher binding energy marks the reduced presence of Zn–N bonds as more Zn leaves the crystal with increasing nitriding time. Increased Zn content (Fig. 5B) allows for a higher probability of N interaction, causing a minor shift to lower B.E. For the Ga-3d peak, there is a consistent shift to higher B.E. with increasing nitriding time (Fig. 5C). This marks the formation of Ga–O bonds due to more and more Zn volatilization.32,33Fig. 5D shows the shift of the Ga-3d peak to lower binding energies with increased Zn composition. Higher Zn content in the sample allows for the replenishment of surface Zn. Thus, the chances in the Ga–O bond formation at the surface are lower with Zn-rich samples. Even the increase in Ga-3d peak intensities with nitriding time (Fig. 5C) and the reverse trend with increasing content (Fig. 5D) are consistent with the above explanation. The N-1s peak is a reflection of the presence of Ga–N (the N-1s spectrum for pure GaN detailed in Fig. S2†) and Zn–N bonds. As reported in the literature,34,35 the presence of Zn–N bonds causes low B.E. shifts, as explicitly shown in Fig. 5F. The decreased peak intensity also marks lower nitride phases at the surface, in close corroboration with a higher ZnO composition. Increased nitride phase formation with time is explicit from Fig. 5E. Shift of the N-1s peak to higher B.E. is an indication of the prominence of Ga–N bonds, as surface Zn contents are reduced due to volatilization.

XPS analyses of the O-1s peak also provide critical insights into the material development process via this synthesis protocol. The O-1s peak (Fig. 6A) for pure ZnO and GaN is essentially a combination of oxide ion and surface chemisorbed hydroxyls.33 For the oxynitride samples, the O-1s peak can have contributions from Zn–O and Ga–O bonds, along with surface hydroxyls and oxygen vacancy defects.36 For the O-1s peak of the 1-10 sample (Fig. 6B), there is an explicit presence of the oxide ion peak from ZnO and another peak that may be attributed to the Ga–O bond and/or chemisorbed surface hydroxyls.18,33 With nitriding time, the shift of the O-1s peak to higher B.E. (Fig. 6C) indicates the increased presence of Ga–O peaks. The minor shift of the O-1s peak to higher B.E. even at a higher Zn content may be attributed to the presence of vacant states36 (Fig. 6D).

Raman spectra were collected for the 2:1 and 3:1 Zn:Ga nitrided samples (Fig. 7). The peaks are largely unresolved from 500 to 700 cm−1. The peaks located at ∼690 and ∼580 cm−1 are likely associated with the GaN A1 (LO) and GaN E2 (high) phonons, respectively.37 A 574 cm−1 peak may also correspond to the ZnO 1(LO) phonon peak, associated with the A1 (LO) phonon, on the c-axis of wurtzite ZnO, which is why the peak has a stronger definition in the 3-10 to 3-30 samples. When ZnO is arranged in a perpendicular arrangement, the E1 (LO) phonon38 can be observed at 583 cm−1. This implied that the shift and broad range are possibly due to the shared phase with the GaN, and also due to optical phonon confinement, defect or impurity in the nanocrystal. The peaks at ∼260 and ∼95 cm−1 revealed that stress and strain are present in the heterostructures. With decreasing Zn content, the peak 260 cm−1 broadened simultaneous to the intensity of the peak at 95 cm−1 diminishing.

Through this process of oxynitride synthesis, we could achieve material property tuning via intrinsically induced strain, vacancy and composition variation. Achieving high Zn content in these oxynitrides resulted in the lowering of the band gap (Fig. 8A), showing promise for visible light activity. The materials were tested for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in a stainless steel reactor under simulated solar light. For the first time, CO2 photoreduction was achieved over these oxynitrides without any noble metal co-catalyst. Increased CO production over Zn-rich materials (Fig. 8B) is coherent with the decreased band gap (Fig. 8A). These materials performed even better than the traditional P25 catalyst (0.41 μmol per g catalyst per h). The surface activity of these materials was probed via CO2 desorption studies using DRIFTS. The CO2 adsorption over these materials in the presence of water is an indication of their reactivity. Theoretically, CO2 adsorption energies have been highlighted as a model descriptor for the catalyst reactivity.39 Hereby, we demonstrate strong CO2 adsorption over all the three samples at different temperatures, ranging from 50 °C to 200 °C (Fig. 8C). The major peaks are identified as bicarbonates or carboxylates (∼1663 cm−1)40 and carbonates (∼1560 cm−1).41 Symmetrical stretching of the O–C–O bonds was also observed (∼1373 cm−1).42 Explicit comparison of the three samples at 100 °C reveals increasing CO2 adsorption with increasing Zn content in the sample (Fig. 8D), which directly matches with the photoreduction capability of these materials (Fig. 8B). The increased presence of oxygen vacancies over Zn-rich samples (Fig. 6D), along with Zn being more electropositive than Ga, provides justification for the increased CO2 adsorption properties in the 3-20 sample. The long-term stability of these materials under different ambient conditions is evident from the in situ XRD patterns (Fig. S3†) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (Fig. S4†) of the samples irradiated with UV light (F15T8 bulbs at 75 W m−2) for up to 3 days, thus revealing that these materials are strong candidates for large scale commercial applications.

Conclusions
Through detailed analysis of the synthesis process, we were able to elucidate the modulation of the band gap in these materials as a function of structure, composition, lattice strain and vacancy and their close correlation to the experimental synthesis protocol. Solar photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO was achieved over these materials for the first time without the use of any expensive dopants or noble metal impregnation. We also demonstrated that the Zn–Ga materials had a Eg value ranging from 2.33 eV to 2.59 eV which was easily tunable by varying the nitriding time and cationic ratio. The highest CO production was achieved for 3-20 sample at 100 °C, which produced 1.06 μmol g−1 h−1, higher than that produced in the control TiO2 experiments and other reported pure TiO2 solar photoreaction experiments.
