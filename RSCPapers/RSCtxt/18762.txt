    , Accepted 25th January 2022First published on 26th January 2022AbstractThe triphenylamine (TPA) group is an important molecular fragment that has been widely used to design efficient hole-transporting materials (HTMs). However, the applicability of triphenylamine derived HTMs that exhibit low hole mobility and conductivity in commercial perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been limited. To aid in the development of highly desirable TPA-based HTMs, we utilized a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and Marcus electron transfer theory to investigate the effect of heteroatoms, including boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, germanium, arsenic, and selenium atoms, on the energy levels, optical properties, hole mobility, and interfacial charge transfer behaviors of a series of HTMs. Our computational results revealed that compared with the commonly referenced OMeTPA-TPA molecule, most heteroatoms lead to deeper energy levels. Furthermore, these heteroatom-based HTMs exhibit improved hole mobility due to their more rigid molecular structures. More significantly, these heteroatoms also enhance the interface interaction in perovskite/HTM systems, resulting in a larger internal electric field. Our work represents a new approach that aids in the understanding and designing of more efficient and better performing HTMs, which we hope can be used as a platform to propel the developmental commercialization of these highly desirable PSCs.
Introduction
In the field of perovskite solar cell (PSC) development, one of the key research focus areas has been to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these solid materials. Recently, there has been significant progress in increasing the PCE of PSCs, from 3.8% to 25.5%.1–4 The hole transporting material (HTM) is a crucial mechanism/element in PSCs, which plays an important role in increasing the charge extraction efficiency and preventing the charge recombination at the interface between the perovskite and electrode.5,6 In addition, it has been reported that rigid HTMs exhibit great potential in increasing the performance of PSCs due to their excellent hole mobility and appropriate molecular energy levels.7–10 Hence, profoundly understanding the structure–property relationship of rigid HTMs (e.g., planar molecules) can effectively enable the rational design of more efficient and better performing PSCs.
Significant efforts have been devoted to developing high-performance rigid HTMs for PSCs. For example, Nazeeruddin et al. employed a planar triazatruxene moiety as the core structure and designed several efficient HTMs. A remarkable PCE of over 18% was achieved using KR131 as a HTM and a composite perovskite material as a light absorber.11 Subsequently, the authors adopted a planar benzotrithiophene group as the core structure and developed rigid HTMs, creating PSCs based on BTT-4 and BTT-5 as HTMs that exhibited remarkable PCEs of 19.0% and 18.2%, respectively.12 Recently, the same group systematically investigated the effect of heteroatoms on the electrochemical and photophysical properties of other planar HTMs. Their results revealed that chalcogenic derivatives, i.e., oxygen, selenium, and sulphur atoms, lead to deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels than their nitrogen analogues.13
Another commonly employed strategy to create increased hole mobility is to rigidify the molecular structure via a planar core. For example, Chen et al. showed that the hole mobility of planar NDT is one magnitude higher than that of nonplanar PBT.14 Ko et al. also reported similar results, whereby they discovered that a rigid FA-MeOPh has more significant hole mobility than normal TPA-MeOPh.15 This is further corroborated by computational calculations that showed how rigid HTMs indeed possessed deep HOMO levels with high hole mobility.16 Thus, the development of rigid HTMs is a very important and effective strategy to increase the PCE of PSCs.
Herein, we present a systematic study of the electronic structures, optical properties, and hole transport behaviour of a series of HTMs containing triphenylamine segments and rigid center cores (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.17,18 These cores were carefully designed and composed of a rigid triphenylamine moiety containing heteroatoms including boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se) atoms. We focus on the effect of heteroatoms on their molecular geometries, optical properties, and transport properties to screen for potential HTMs. Our results demonstrate how heteroatoms can play a crucial role in reducing the molecular HOMO energy levels, improving hole mobility, and enhancing the interfacial charge transfer process between the HTM and perovskite.

Computational details
For isolated molecular properties, the geometries of all investigated single molecules are relaxed to their potential energy minimum at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in dichloromethane solvent, based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).19 Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were also carried out to simulate the photochemical properties and the excited state of HTMs based on the PBE0/6-31G (d,p) level. All calculations are performed using the Gaussian 16 code.16 For the hole transport properties, it is strongly dependent upon the arrangement position of adjacent molecules. The crystal structures of all molecules were simulated using the Universal Structure Predictor (USPEX) software to obtain possible hole transfer pathways.20–22
For investigating the interfacial properties of CH3NH3PbI3/HTMs systems, geometry optimization was performed by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parametrized with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the related properties were all determined using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).23,24
Results and discussion
Geometric and electronic structures
The optimized geometries of the investigated HTMs are shown in Fig. 2a. The angles at which the nitrogen center deviates from the plane are summarized in Fig. 2b. Compared with the OMeTPA-TPA (R-TPA, reference molecule), the participation of heteroatoms endows the molecule with a heteroatom-bridged π-conjugated central core. The B, C, N, O, S, and Ge atoms formed almost a planar central π system. The significantly larger covalent radius of Si, P, As, and Se (when compared to B, C, N, O, and S) urges the atom out of plane even when incorporated into a π-conjugated system.25 This heteroatom-bridge affects not only the molecular geometry, but also the distribution of the electrostatic potential (ESP, shown in Fig. S2, ESI†).26,27 For instance, the existence of lone pair electrons in nitrogen atoms leads to the most negative potential (−32.33 kcal mol−1) of molecule R-N, which far exceeds other molecules. This difference in ESP could lead to various packing models in the solid state.

The charge density distribution of the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) can have a significant effect on the carrier transport properties.28 To this end, we first investigated the effect of heteroatoms on the charge distribution of the FMO (Fig. 2a). In terms of the shape of charge density distribution, the HOMO of R-TPA is generally delocalized over the whole molecule, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized on the central triphenylamine group. Initial calculations revealed that the C, O, and S atoms have no significant effect on the overall charge density distribution of the FMO. OMeTPA-C (R-C), OMeTPA-O (R-O), and OMeTPA-S (R-S) exhibit similar FMO charge density distributions in relation to R-TPA. However, the introduction of B, N, P, Si, Ge, As, and Se atoms significantly impact the charge density distribution of the HOMO; the charge density distributions of HOMOs are mainly located on the triphenylamine branches in OMeTPA-B (R-B), OMeTPA-Si (R-Si), OMeTPA-Ge (R-Ge), OMeTPA-P (R-P), OMeTPA-As (R-As), and OMeTPA-Se (R-Se). The difference in the distribution of HOMOs is attributed to the existence of many vacant orbitals in heteroatoms, such as vacant pπ-orbitals of boron atoms. However, this is in stark contrast to OMeTPA-N (R-N), where the charge density of the HOMO is only localized on the central core. The different distributions in R-N can be rationalized by the increased electron donating ability of the central core, which is caused by the lone pair of electrons in nitrogen atoms. Overall, these molecules possess varying HOMO charge density distribution, which may lead to desirable hole transfer properties.
The HOMO energy level of the HTM is a critical parameter in PSCs because it determines the open-circuit voltage of the PSC device.29 This is defined as the difference between the HOMO energy level of the HTM and the quasi-Fermi level of the electron transfer layer (such as TiO2). Deep HOMO levels can lead to a high open-circuit voltage.30 Previously, our group has reported a semi-empirical relationship to determine the HOMO energy levels of molecules.29 This semi-empirical relationship has been shown to be robust and reliable, and it has been used to predict the HOMO energy levels of many unknown or newly designed molecules.31–33 Using the semi-empirical formula, our calculations show that, except for R-N (−4.46 eV), the HOMO energy levels of all molecules are within the range of −5.11 eV to −5.44 eV (Fig. 2a). These are deeper than that of the well-known and established Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.09 eV) system.29,34 Moreover, their HOMO levels are slightly higher than the valence-band maximum of perovskites (such as CH3NH3PbI3, −5.45 eV),35 which allows for efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM. Additionally, we also noticed a pattern whereby the HOMO energy levels increase as the atomic number of the elements increases within the same period (Fig. 2c). This can be correlated with the increase of electronegativity of the atoms along the same period.
Taking this concept further, compared to R-TPA, the boron-containing analogue R-B contains vacant pπ-orbitals and can thus act as an electron-withdrawing unit which stabilizes the HOMO energy level.36 In contrast, the lone pair electrons of the inserted nitrogen atoms increase the electron-donating capability of R-N to increase the HOMO energy level. Within the pnictogenic Group 15 analogues, when compared to R-N, the vacant dπ–pπ orbitals in R-P and R-As overlap at the central triangulene unit through π back-bonding which can enable further HOMO stabilization. This can also be extended to the Group 14 analogues, whereby the HOMO levels of R-Si and R-Ge are much more stable than that of R-C, which is observed as a longer C–Si/C–Ge bond length and specific interactions (σ*–π* conjugation) between the Si/Ge atom and the π-electron system.37 For the Group 16 analogues, R-Se displayed a slightly lower HOMO energy level compared to R-O and R-S due to vacant d-orbitals and the spin–orbit coupling of Se atoms. These results can be substantiated by analyzing the percentage contribution of the central core fragment to the molecular HOMO level, as shown in Fig. 2d. The orbital compositions of the central core fragments were calculated by using the Hirshfeld method in the Multiwfn software.38 There is an excellent linear relationship (R2 = 0.93) between the orbital contribution and its molecular HOMO energy level, whereby a smaller orbital contribution from the core leads to a deeper HOMO energy level. These calculated results suggest that heteroatoms have a direct effect on the distribution of the FMO and HOMO energy levels. Moreover, we also showed that the HOMO energy levels can be quantitatively tuned by controlling the contribution to the HOMO from the central core fragments by rigidifying the molecular structure with various heteroatoms.
Optical properties
Next, we investigated the effect of heteroatoms on the optical properties of HTMs. Fig. 3a shows the simulated UV-vis absorption and emission properties of R-TPA and R-X in dichloromethane solution using the TDDFT-PBE method,39 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.† The UV-vis spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†) of R-TPA exhibits an absorption peak (λab) at 386 nm, which is in good agreement with previously reported experimental data (374 nm).40 When the triphenylamine core of R-TPA was fused and rigidified with heteroatoms, our calculations revealed that most of the molecules exhibited a significant bathochromic spectral response; the λab values of R-X increased to 407–507 nm. The rigid heteroatom core seems to enhance the conjugation effect, which is beneficial for localized aromatic π–π* excitation migrations from the core to the triphenylamine branches. Although R-X displayed slightly stronger absorption in visible light than R-TPA, it is not sufficiently large enough to compete significantly with the perovskite light-harvesting layer in PSCs, which has been extensively investigated in previous studies.41–43

(b) The linear relationship between the contribution of heteroatoms to the hole for the first excited state and λab (R is the correlation coefficient). 
It is also worth noting that the absorption maximum of these molecules has been assigned to S0 → S1 transitions. The absorption peak in R-X mainly corresponds to HOMO → LUMO transitions, except for in R-B. To further understand the correlation and effect of heteroatoms on the excited state properties of the various molecules R-X, the contribution of heteroatoms to the photogenerated hole in the first excited state was calculated and is presented in Table S1 (ESI†). Our calculations revealed that there is an excellent linear relationship (R2 = 0.92) between the contribution of heteroatoms and the λab values (Fig. 3b). A significant contribution to the photogenerated hole led to a redshift of the λab peak. Moreover, the maximum fluorescence emission peaks of R-TPA and R-X were calculated to be at 467 nm and 464–695 nm, respectively, which correspond to significant Stokes shifts of 80 nm and 70–190 nm, respectively. Intuitively, the large Stokes shifts mainly derive from the long emission wavelengths. R-TPA exhibits the characteristics of a locally excited (LE) state as denoted by the small DCT value (0.348 Å). However, the large DCT values of R-Ge (2.299 Å), R-N (1.872 Å), and R-O (2.317 Å) suggest significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in their excited states. Such a significant ICT effect leads to long emission wavelengths and hence large Stokes shifts of the studied molecules. Previous studies have shown that the large Stokes shifts can be synergistically beneficial for the infiltration and pore-filling of a HTM, and can be achieved by simple annealing or light soaking post-treatment.16,44 It should be noted that our designed rigid heteroatom molecules are capable of exhibiting larger Stokes shifts than the flexible R-TPA, which implies that these molecules can undergo large geometrical changes upon photoexcitation.
Hole transport properties
In PSCs, the free hole carrier is injected into the HTM from the perovskite/HTM interface and follows through the HTM to the anode.45 As a potential HTM, high intrinsic hole mobility can facilitate hole transport and avoid charge recombination at the interface.46 To investigate the effect of heteroatoms on hole mobility, we calculated the hole transport properties of these molecules using the Marcus electron transfer theory and Einstein relation (see eqn (S1) and (S2) in the ESI†).47,48 The reorganization energy (λ) and transfer integral (v) are two essential parameters that are commonly used to describe and ascertain the extent of hole mobility.49 For λ, the reorganization energies were calculated using the adiabatic potential energy surface method.50 Our calculations revealed that the λ values of all molecules are within the range of 0.12–0.42 eV (Fig. 4a), which are all slightly larger than that of R-TPA (0.11 eV).29 This can be attributed to the structural deformation from the neutral states to the cationic states of molecules.51 Compared with R-TPA, different heteroatoms have distinctive effects on the backbone of the π-extended bridging moiety of R-Xs when one electron is removed. For example, in R-B, the charge transfer in the cation mainly occurs on the triphenylamine branch and causes minor structural change, while for R-N, the charge change occurs mainly on the lone pair of N, which creates a more planar motif. The root mean square displacement (RMSD) can be used to measure the geometric deviation between the neutral and cation states. Large RMSD can lead to a large geometric deviation, which results in a large λ. The RMSDs are in the order as follows: RMSDR-TPA(0.237) < RMSDR-B(0.355) < RMSDR-N(0.589), corresponding to those from λ: λR-TPA(0.11 eV) < λR-B(0.16 eV) < λR-N(0.42 eV).

For v, the transfer integral is evaluated and is dependent on the alignment and position of the adjacent molecules. The crystal structures of all molecules were first simulated using the USPEX software to obtain the possible hole transfer pathways.20–22 Detailed unit cell packing parameters of molecules are described in Table S2 of the ESI.† Our calculations revealed that all molecules belonged to the P21 space group, with the exception of R-Si (P-1). Subsequently, several possible efficient hole transfer pathways were selected to calculate hole mobility (Tables S3–S13). The total hole mobility of R-X HTMs is presented in Fig. 4b. Our calculations revealed that when compared with R-TPA, only the nitrogen heteroatom led to a significant decline of hole mobility due to a large λ value. We also discovered that R-B and R-Ge exhibited similar hole mobility properties, which may originate from a similar distribution of their HOMOs. It is noteworthy that R-Se possessed the best hole mobility, which can be explained by its tight π-packing/stacking in the crystal structure (smaller centroid to centroid distances between adjacent molecules). In addition, R-Si, R-P, and R-S also have more efficient hole transfer capability due to a strong intermolecular π–π interaction between adjacent triphenylamines. We then compared the dimeric conformations with the most significant transfer integral between all molecules (Fig. S4, ESI†). The tight face-to-face packing models were observed in R-C, R-As, R-Se, R-Si, R-P, R-O, and R-S, which might explain their excellent hole transfer properties. In summary, rigidification with heteroatoms can significantly improve their molecular stacking, thereby increasing the hole mobility of these molecules.
HTMs/perovskite interfaces properties
The hole transport behaviour at the interfaces between HTMs and perovskite layers can directly affect the PCEs of PSCs.52–54 In general, a fast hole transport at the interface could increase the short-circuit current density of PSCs. We focus on the CH3NH3PbI3(001) face because it is one of the most stable surfaces and is found to be favorable for the hole transport.55,56 Herein, we studied two binding modes (Pb–N and Pb–X models) between the perovskite and HTMs to investigate the effect of heteroatoms on interface interactions (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). The Pb⋯N (N atom from the central triphenylamine) coordinate bonds are dominant in Pb–N models, while Pb⋯X coordinate bonds in heteroatom models. The surface adsorption energy (Eads) is usually used to measure the adsorption capacity and the spontaneous interaction between the HTM molecule and the perovskite substrate, and can be obtained by using the following formula: Eads = EHTM-CH3NH3PbI3 − (EHTMHTM + ECH3NH3PbI3), (whereby EHTM-CH3NH3PbI3, EHTM and ECH3NH3PbI3 are the total electronic energies of the HTM adsorbed on the perovskite system, the pristine HTM, and the perovskite substrate, respectively). The surface adsorption energies of all binding models and the most stable binding model of heteroatom molecules are shown in Fig. 5 and Tables S14, S15, Fig. S6 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 5  The histogram of the adsorption energies corresponding to the two adsorption modes for the study molecules, along with the schematic diagram of adsorption modes. 
Our calculations revealed that the adsorption energies of Pb–X models are more negative than that of Pb–N models in R-B, R-O, R-S, and R-Se (Fig. 5), while the Pb–N model is dominant in R-C, R-Si, R-Ge, R-N, R-P, and R-As. These results suggest that Group 13 (B atom) and Group 16 (O, S, and Se atoms) elements are conducive to combining with Pb atoms compared with Group 14 (C, Si, and Ge atoms) and Group 15 (N, P, and As atoms) elements. This is because in R-B, the boron atom can undergo sp2 hybridization, and its vacant Pz orbital is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, which provides a vacant site to interact with Pb2+. For the Group 15 analogues, their strong electronegativity facilitates the formation of strong interactions with Pb2+. The bond lengths of Pb and heteroatoms or Pb and central N atoms are in the range of 2.90–4.76 Å (Table S16, ESI†). Our results show that molecular interaction at the perovskite/HTM composite interface is mainly comprised of van der Waals's interactions. Besides, compared with R-TPA, the introduction of heteroatoms significantly increases the interfacial binding sites and enhances the interaction between the HTM and the perovskite layer surface.
We then investigated the interface interaction behaviour of HTMs at the perovskite substrate on the basis of the most stable binding configuration. R-Se was used as our star example since it exhibited great potential as an HTM due to its deep HOMO level, high hole mobility, and strong binding affinity between the central core and the perovskite. The hole transport behaviour at the interface of perovskite/R-TPA was also studied for comparison purposes. As illustrated in Fig. 6a and Fig. S7 (ESI†), the rigid structure of R-Se shortened the intermolecular distance between the HTM and perovskite surface from 7.43 Å to 5.74 Å. In addition, we also discovered short interatomic distances of Pb–Se (4.31–4.45 Å) in the perovskite/R-Se system, which denotes enhanced binding affinity between the perovskite substrate and R-Se. This is further corroborated by the surface adsorption energies, in which the calculated adsorption energy of the perovskite/R-Se system (−2.09 eV) is almost twice as large as that of the perovskite/R-TPA system (−1.08 eV). Our calculations suggest that the molecular design strategy of augmenting and rigidifying the core with heteroatoms can significantly improve the interface interaction between the HTM and perovskite.

(b) The charge difference density (CDD) plots of the complex, along with the planar average electron density difference (Δρ) integrated over the x–y plane for the HTM/perovskite systems as a function of the z coordinate, the yellow and cyan colors indicate the electron gain and loss, respectively. (c) The distribution of partial atomic charges for R-TPA and R-Se, where blue represents the negative charge and pink represents the positive charge. (d) The dipole moment of each segment is quantitatively decomposed. 
Such excellent interface interactions are typically accompanied by a considerable charge transfer process, which can result in significant charge redistribution.57,58Fig. 6b shows the overall charge difference density (CDD) and the planar average electron density difference (Δρ) integrated over the x–y plane for the perovskite/HTM systems as a function of the z coordinate for the perovskite/R-TPA and perovskite/R-Se systems.59 For the same isosurface value of 0.03 e Å−3, the charge redistribution becomes stronger from R-TPA to R-Se. The charge transfer occurs along the entire molecule for R-Se, yet is mostly localized around the triphenylamine groups for R-TPA. From the Δρ values, it was observed that an uneven distribution of the electronic cloud on R-Se resulted in the formation of an internal electric field (IEF), which in turn caused rapid separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.60 To understand and rationalize this large internal electric field, we refocused on the effect of the heteroatoms on single molecules. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, the introduction of heteroatoms changes the initial charge distribution of molecules. The rigid structure causes the central nitrogen atom to become more negatively charged and the adjacent carbon atoms to be more positively charged, compared with R-TPA. This redistribution of charges increases the tendency of charge transfer from the central nitrogen atom to the triphenylamine groups, which can effectively increase the intramolecular dipole and lead to the large IEF in the molecule and at the interface.61 These results suggest that additional charge transfer can occur near the interface layer, which significantly accelerates the transport of holes at the interface and effectively reduces the charge recombination. In addition, we also assessed the atomic charge distributions of other heteroatom doped molecules R-Xs, and our results showed similar charge distributions to that of R-Se (Fig. S8, ESI†). All these results strongly suggest that the heteroatom-doped HTMs demonstrated great potential for replacing the commonly used Spiro-OMeTAD for application in PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the synergistic effects of heteroatoms on the geometric and electronic influence of π-units in organic HTMs. Our results revealed that the presence of such heteroatom-bridged π-conjugated systems could be used as a molecular strategy to manipulate and tune the HOMO levels, optical properties, molecular stacking, and hole mobility directly. Moreover, owing to the improved molecular stacking, with the exception of R-N, all R-X (X = B, C, O, Si, P, S, Ge, As, and Se) HTMs exhibited an increase in hole mobility. Significantly, these heteroatoms also enhance the interface interaction, resulting in a larger internal electric field, which accelerates the charge transfer process at the perovskite/HTM interface. In a nutshell, with the exception of R-N, all the designed molecules R-X demonstrated good potential as effective HTMs, especially for R-Se. We believe that the molecular design strategies presented in this work can be used for further development of perovskite/HTM materials to boost the charge transport by π-extension with heteroatoms. This pushes the limits of the photoelectric properties of such efficient and stable PSCs, which is highly desirable and might enable their use in deep-space applications.
