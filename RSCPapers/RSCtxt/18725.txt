, Accepted 1st July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractElemental doping and liquid exfoliation are two efficient approaches to improve the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of Nb/Ta based perovskite semiconductors. Herein, by liquid exfoliation of nitrogen and tetravalent niobium controllably doped KCa2Nb3O10 precursors, yellow and black [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets with single-molecule thickness were fabricated for the first time for hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation. Comparative experiments on the ammonization conditions revealed that the additive K2CO3 played an essential role in determining the reduction of Nb5+ through a defect chemistry mechanism. Due to the synergistic effect of N- and Nb4+-doping, black [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets exhibit superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity to yellow and bare [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets. These results can not only provide deeper insights into the contributions from N- and Nb4+-doping to wide-bandgap semiconductors, but also give examples combining two chemical manipulation approaches towards enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Introduction
Hydrogen evolution through photocatalytic water-splitting has attracted great attention for future clean and recyclable fuel sources in the past few decades.1–4 Despite that numerous materials have been developed that are capable of photocatalytic hydrogen/oxygen production from water, the overall conversion efficiency is still too low for practical use.5 The challenge comes from the fact that water splitting on the surface of photocatalysts is a multistep process comprising a sequence of solar light harvesting, charge separation and reduction and/or oxidation reactions. Practically, it is not easy to realize all above-mentioned structural or optical features in an artificial material simultaneously. To address this issue, various chemical manipulation strategies have been developed to improve the photocatalytic performance of traditional semiconductors. One well-known example is the elemental doping route to introduce exotic orbital of B/N/F/S or transition metals to increase the visible light absorption efficiency of wide band-gap semiconductors.6–14 Ye et al.15 and Hou et al.16 reported the facile fabrication of nitrogen-doped HNb3O8/KTiNbO5 by using urea as the nitrogen source which exhibited superior photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Another general adopted method is nanocrystallization,17–19 by which selectively exposed crystalline faces and large surface area have been created responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance.
Liquid exfoliation of layered materials is a universal route to afford ultra-thin nanosheets with extraordinary large surface areas and dramatically enhanced surface activity.20–26 Besides the well-known graphene, exfoliated layered perovskites such as the Dion–Jacobson (DJ) and Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phases are also a diverse source of nanosheets with molecular thickness. Most importantly, the high flexibility of a perovskite-type structure enables convenient tuning of either the composition or local structures to improve their performance. To date, dozens of Nb/Ta based ultra-thin nanosheets have been exfoliated from layered perovskite precursors and demonstrated to exhibit highly enhanced hydrogen production performance, such as KCa2Nb3O10,27–30 KNb3O8,31,32 K4Nb6O1733,34 and KTiNbO5.35 Monolayer HNb3O8 nanosheets have been reported by Wu et al. as highly chemoselective and active photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols.36 The material exhibited improved photocatalytic activity over their bulk counterparts due to the ultra-thin features of monolayer nanosheets.
When combining the above-mentioned two strategies (i.e. elemental doping and liquid exfoliation) in a given material, the simultaneously improved visible light absorption and surface area can lead to dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity.37–45 Recently, Ida et al. reported the preparation and photocatalytic performance of [Ca2Ta3O9.7N0.2]− nanosheets by combining the liquid exfoliation of layered perovskite with N-doping method.43 Owing to their molecular thickness, large surface area and enhanced visible light response, the as-prepared oxynitride nanosheets exhibited superb photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation. In another work,44 they demonstrated the fabrication of N-/Nb4+ codoped [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets exhibiting enhanced visible-light-driven water splitting performance. However, investigation adopting such two or more different strategies to improve the catalytic performance is still rare reported and needs to be popularized in other wide-bandgap semiconductors. On the other hand, in the N-/Nb4+ codoped [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets, it is difficult to evaluate the contributions from the N- and Nb4+-doping separately.
In this work, we report the fabrication of selectively N-doped and N/Nb4+ codoped KCa2Nb3O10 by precisely controlling the ammoniation reaction conditions firstly. Then the as-obtained yellow (N-doped) and black (N/Nb4+-codoped) KCa2Nb3O10 bulk materials were exfoliated to [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets with molecular thickness which enables subsequent comparative studies associated with different doping effect. The selective reduction of niobium under NH3 atmosphere is examined to be associated with the oxygen defect, and finally prevented by the reparation of potassium volatilization in the ammoniation process. The photocatalytic performance of the products was evaluated by H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation.
Experimental
Material syntheses
The parent layered oxide was prepared from K2CO3 (99.0%), CaCO3 (99.0%), and Nb2O5 (99.9%) according to the literature (K/Ca/Nb = 1.05/2/3 in molar ratio). The mixture of these reagents was calcinated at 1200 °C for 12 h. The obtained KCa2Nb3O10 powder was denoted as KCNO. Oxynitrides were synthesized from the appropriate precursor oxide, which was ground with a certain stoichiometric excess of K2CO3. All the samples were calcinated at 800 °C for 5 h under NH3 flow (60 mL min−1). The resulting samples were acid-exchanged by treating them with a 6 M HCl solution for 72 h. Then, the power was washed to neutral by centrifugation. The obtained proton-exchanged samples (1.0 g) were treated with a tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) aqueous solution (300 cm3). The concentration of TBAOH was adjusted to set a molar ratio of TBA+/H+ at 1 where H+ denotes exchangeable protons in the solid. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for two weeks. The colloidal suspensions thus obtained were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min to separate a small amount of unexfoliated residue. The nanosheets were restacked into lamellar flocculates by adding their colloidal suspensions to a 2 M HCl solution at a speed of 1 cm3 min−1.
Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the samples were collected at room temperature on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using a germanium monochromatic (Cu-Kα radiation, 40 kV and 40 mA). The data for phase identification were taken in the 2 theta range between 10° and 80° and with the remaining time of 0.1 s per step. The XRD data for Rietveld refinement were taken in the 2θ range between 10° and 120° and with the remaining time of 1 s per step. Rietveld structural refinement was done by using the Topas4 software package. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded using a Quanta 250 FEG FEI at 20 kV in gentle-beam mode without any metal coating. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were recorded on a Tecnai G2 20 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV using a carbon-coated copper grid. The thickness of the exfoliated nanosheets was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Autoprobe CP-Reaserch, and Bruker, USA). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured by using a U-4100 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Hitachi). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα X-ray sources. The room temperature X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) data on the Nb K-edge (18.986 keV) of all the samples were collected at 16BM-D, Advanced Phonon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The data were processed and fitted with the program Athena.46
Photocatalytic activity tests
The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature in a closed photo-reactor using a 300 W Xe lamp. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated under both full arc and visible light irradiation (420 nm ≤ λ ≤ 780 nm) with a 420 nm cut-off filter, respectively. A quartz reaction cell was irradiated by light from top light source. The rate of H2 production was measured in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing 50–100 mg of catalyst and 20 vol% methanol. H2 gas was analyzed by gas chromatograph (TCD, nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column). The online analysis was also conducted at regular intervals (1 h) by evacuating the produced gases. Co-catalysts Pt was photo-deposited on nanosheets in methanol aqueous solution (100 mL of nanosheets suspension, 40 mL of methanol, 30 mL of water) containing H2PtCl6·H2O by irradiation with the 300 W Xe lamp for 3 h. After loading the cocatalyst, 2 M HCl was used to flocculation nanosheets suspensions. The flocculent nanosheets were washed by water to centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min to remove residual TBAOH. The obtained nanosheets by centrifugation were used for photocatalytic activity evaluations. The solar energy conversion efficiency was calculated according to followed equation, RH: the rate of hydrogen, ΔG0 (H2O): the standard Gibbs free energy of water, Isun: the density of incident light, S: irradiation area.  
Results and discussion
Syntheses of black and yellow colored KCa2Nb3O10catalysts
Scheme 1 presents an overview of the fabrication routes to yellow (N-doped) and black (N-/Nb4+-codoped) [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets. Firstly, black and yellow KCa2Nb3O10 with selectively N- and/or Nb4+-doping were synthesized by annealing layered KCa2Nb3O10 at 800 °C under NH3 flow and determined by whether adding K2CO3 in the process (yellow, Y-KCNO) or not (black, B-KCNO). Then liquid exfoliation of the Y-KCNO and B-KCNO precursors in diluted TBAOH yielded yellow and black colored [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets respectively (for details, see Experimental section).

The addition of K2CO3 (∼5 mol%) during the NH3 treatment process plays an essential role in preventing the formation of oxygen defect and thus the reduction of Nb5+ ions, which will be discussed later. This controllable route gives two distinct ultra-thin nanosheets that allows subsequent comparative studies on the visible light response and photocatalytic activities of the products with different doping effect.
Fig. 1 shows the powder XRD patterns and the representative SEM images of KCa2Nb3O10 powders before and after ammoniation process. All of the observed diffraction peaks can be well indexed in space group P2/m, indicating that the NH3 treatment at 800 °C either with 5% K2CO3 additive or not does not change the layered DJ-type perovskite structure. The cell parameters derived from Le Bail fitting of the PXRD patterns are provided in Table 1 (the detailed fitting results are provided as Fig. S2†). It is reasonable that the N3− (ionic radii, 1.32 Å) replacing of O2− (ionic radii, 1.26 Å) leads to the slight expanding of the perovskite blocks (ab plane). While, in the situation of black-KCNO, the generation of oxygen vacancies (Nb4+-doped) leads to evident cell shrinkages along the c direction. The ammoniation process also does not change the morphology of the material, for that all the samples are lamellar plates with similar particle sizes, as shown in the insets of Fig. 1. The doping effect of N- and/or Nb4+-on the photo response of KCNO in visible light region is shown in Fig. 2a. First of all is the obvious colour change from white KCNO to yellow and black after ammoniation treatment. Other evidence is the red-shift of the bandgap from 3.26 eV for KCNO to approximate 2.47 eV for both Y-KCNO and B-KCNO. As we known, the optical absorption edge of such an Nb-based oxide is determined by the charge transfer process from O 2p to Nb 4d orbital. The bandgap narrowing of KCNO is due to the intermediate 2p orbital of N3− ions. The third change is the enhanced overall absorption of Y-KCNO and B-KCNO in the long wavelength region beyond 500 nm, which can attribute to the formation of oxygen defects introduced by either N3− substitution or Nb4+ self-doping.47 The N elemental doping and the reduction of Nb5+ can be verified by XPS studies on Nb 3d and N 1s edges of the three samples. As shown in Fig. 2b, the Nb 3d peaks keep almost the same in KCNO and Y-KCNO but exhibit a slight broadening to the lower bonding energy in B-KCNO, which indicates the existence of Nb4+ exclusively in B-KCNO.48–50 While, the emerging N 1s peaks were observed for both Y-KCNO and B-KCNO at 395.6 eV, confirming the successful N doping to the parent KCNO lattice. According to these characterizations, the two defect types induced by N3− and Nb4+ doping in KCNO can be written as: KCa2Nb3O10−3xN2x□x and KCa2Nb3−2y5+Nb2y4+O10−3x−yN2x□x+y in Y-KCNO and B-KCNO, respectively. Moreover, the N/O ratios estimated by XPS measurements give approximate 7.5% and 9.7% for Y-KCNO and B-KCNO, respectively.

The selective supplement of K2CO3 in the ammoniation process is essential for the formation of two distinct products Y-KCNO and B-KCNO with different doping effects. The possible reason is that the additional K2CO3 can balance the volatilization of K at high temperature, which induces oxygen defects and makes Nb5+ easier to be reduced (defect formula: K1−2xCa2Nb3O10−x□x). In Mallouk51 and Maia's52 previous work, they also mentioned the necessity of 10–20 mol% excess of A2CO3 (A = K, Cs) during the ammonolysis reaction to compensate the volatilization of alkali metal. In our experiments, both the ammoniation temperature and the quantity of K2CO3 added were explored in detail and the optimized reaction condition was finally fixed at 800 °C (for all samples) and 0% or 5% K2CO3 for B-KCNO or Y-KCNO, respectively (Fig. S1 and S2†). The impact of nitrogen replacement of oxygen and the introduction of K/O vacancies on the crystal structure can also be reflected from the cell parameter changes (Table 1). The Y-KCNO exhibits a cell elongation along the c axis and a slightly expanded cell volume, ascribed to the bigger ion radius of N3− than that of O2− and the longer Nb–N bond lengths. While for the situation in B-KCNO, the K/O vacancies will lead to remarkable lattice collapse along the c axis and thus the reduced cell volume.
To get more information on the local structure evolution during the selectively doping process of KCNO, XAFS data on the Nb K-edge (18.986 keV) of the three samples were collected at room temperature (as shown in Fig. 3). The overall profiles of Y-KCNO and B-KCNO look very similar as that of the pristine KCNO, indicating that the elemental doping doesn't change the perovskite-type crystal structure. There are two small but distinct differences that can reflect the change of coordination environment around the Nb atoms. One is the obvious increase of the pre-edge peak (∼18.985 keV) of B-KCNO compared with those of KCNO and Y-KCNO, which can be attributed to the partially reduction from Nb5+ to Nb4+. The other difference is the change of Nb–O and Nb–N bonding distribution probability: Y-KCNO shows an increased Nb–N bonding but B-KCNO shows a simultaneous decrease of both Nb–O and Nb–N, which indicates the dominating generation of oxygen vacancies during the ammoniation process without K2CO3 additive. These evidences are also consistent with the XRD and XPS analyses.

Liquid exfoliation of the doped products by acidification and subsequent treatment in TBAOH aqueous solution yielded Y-KCNO and B-KCNO nanosheets maintaining their yellow and black colours. Fig. 4 shows the TEM and AFM images of exfoliated B-KCNO and Y-KCNO samples. They are ultra-thin single-crystalline nanosheets of several micrometers in width. The cross-sectional profile of AFM images give their thickness to be about 2 nm, which is very close to the single-molecular thickness of [Ca2Nb3O10]− plus TBA+ ions on the surface. The thickness difference of B-KCNO and Y-KCNO nanosheets is too small to be observed in neither TEM nor AFM images. Notably, the similar morphology and particle size of B-KCNO and Y-KCNO enable feasible comparison for their photocatalytic performance and studies on the separate contribution from N-doping and Nb4+ doping.

It is well-known that the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor catalysts significantly depends on its corresponding structure. To disclose the advantages of the N3−/Nb4+ doping nanosheets catalysts compared with the individual doping with N, photocatalytic H2 production activities of the as-prepared samples were evaluated under full arc and visible light irradiation (420 nm ≤ λ ≤ 780 nm) in the presence of CH3OH, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen evolution rate using Y-KCNO and B-KCNO nanosheets as the catalysts under full arc irradiation. Despite the large surface area created by exfoliation, undoped KCNO nanosheets show very low photocatalytic activity (11.4 μmol h−1). The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of Y-KCNO and B-KCNO nanosheets (42.9 and 154.7 μmol h−1, respectively) can be attributed to the N3− and N3−/Nb4+ doping effects, which improve the light utilization in the visible region. The low-valence metal (Nb4+) self-doping can further promote the visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance beyond single N3− doping. Furthermore, the photo-generated carriers produced on the surface of the nanosheets can directly participate in the reaction due to the ultrathin nanosheets structure, indicating that the incident photoelectron conversion efficiency is improved during the electron transmission from the inside to the surface compared with the bulk material. Hence, it is reasonable to believe that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the N3−/Nb4+ doped nanosheets arises from the enhanced separation efficiency of photo-generated carries and light absorption. We also performed the photocatalytic activity test under visible irradiation, in which situation the H2 evolution was almost negligible, in good agreement with the previous report.43,44 The photocatalytic activity of Y-KCNO and B-KCNO nanosheets could be further enhanced by Pt-loading (0.5 wt%) due to the formation of a Mott–Schottky heterojunction, which can accelerate the separation of electron–hole pairs and decreased the over-potential of reaction kinetics. The H2 evolution rates were improved to about 190.1 and 429.5 μmol h−1 for Pt–Y-KCNO and Pt–B-KCNO, respectively, which are three times larger than that of the bare nanosheets. The energy conversion efficiency for solar hydrogen production, defined as the ratio between the energy of solar-produced hydrogen and the energy of the incident sunlight, reached 2.7% for the N/Nb4+ doped B-KCNO nanosheets.

We further investigated the stability of photocatalytic hydrogen production over N/Nb4+ doped B-KCNO nanosheets. The sample after one trial was washed and dried for the subsequent photoreaction cycle test. After three cycles, no efficiency decrease was observed for B-KCNO nanosheets photocatalyst (Fig. 6a). The XRD analysis (Fig. 6b) and the typical SEM images (Fig. S4†) of the restacked flocculates B-KCNO before and after photo reaction also proved the high stability of doped B-KCNO nanosheets during the photocatalysis process under light irradiation.

Conclusions
In summary, yellow and black [Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets with molecular thickness were fabricated by liquid exfoliation of layered perovskite KCa2Nb3O10 with controllable nitrogen and tetravalent niobium doping. The products were characterized by XPS, TEM, AFM, XAFS, UV-vis spectroscopy and hydrogen evolution measurements under visible light irradiation. Comparative experiments on the ammonization conditions revealed that the additive K2CO3 played an essential role to determine the reduction of Nb5+ through a defect chemistry mechanism. Due to the synergistic effect of N- and Nb4+ doping, B-KCNO nanosheets exhibit superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity than Y-KCNO and KCNO. Our results not only provide examples combining two or more chemical manipulation approaches towards enhanced photocatalytic performance, but also gain deeper understandings on the contributions from N- and Nb4+-doping on wide-bandgap semiconductors.
