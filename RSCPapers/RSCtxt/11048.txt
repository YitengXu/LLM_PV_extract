The state-of-the-art photocatalysts realized H2 production or CO2 reduction, separately, with high activity and stability. Syngas, a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 is an important feedstock in petrochemical industries. Syngas with a reasonable CO:H2 ratio satisfies different product requirements in Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis. The production of syngas via photocatalysis through protons and CO2 reduction reactions is a promising strategy to obtain syngas through solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Herein, we report a novel ternary photocatalyst, CoPh/CdSe@TiO2, by assembling a molecular CO2 reduction catalyst CoPh, CdSe quantum dots (QDs), and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) together via facile self-assembly. The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst enables the catalysis of proton and CO2 reduction reactions and produces syngas under visible light irradiation. The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst simultaneously produces CO and H2 for over 140 hours under visible light irradiation. The efficiencies of CO and H2 production are 571 μmol g−1 and 1554 μmol g−1, respectively. The CO:H2 ratio maintains in the range of 1:0.6–1:2.7, satisfying syngas ratio requirements for F–T synthesis. Mechanism studies revealed that CdSe QD, TiO2 NP, and CoPh function mainly as a visible light harvester, a H2 production catalyst, and a CO2 reduction catalyst, respectively. Photoinduced electron transfers from CdSe QD to CoPh or TiO2, separately, occur in the ternary photocatalyst. A robust photocatalytic syngas production has been achieved based on the successful assembly of three functional components in one photocatalyst.
Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy is an ideal strategy to produce fuels in a sustainable and clean way.1–6 In this regard, two photoinduced reduction reactions, proton reduction to H2 and CO2 reduction to carbon-based fuels, have been extensively explored. A variety of specific photocatalysts towards H2 production or CO2 reduction have been fabricated. Syngas, a gaseous mixture of CO and H2, is an important feedstock in petrochemical industries. The different CO:H2 ratios of syngas satisfy different Fischer–Tropsch processes, for example, syngas with a CO:H2 ratio of 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 can be used for gasoline, methanol, or methane production.7–11 Traditionally, syngas used in industry is produced mainly from energy-consuming processes, such as natural gas conversion at high temperatures or methane oxidation. The conversion of protons and CO2 to H2 and CO, respectively, through a photocatalytic system is considered a cleaner and energy-saving method to syngas production. To this end, the design and fabrication of photocatalysts/systems enabling the conversion of protons and CO2 to H2 and CO, respectively, with a rational CO:H2 ratio is significant.
A proven photocatalyst has two functions, light harvesting ability and catalytic activity to a specific reaction. Furthermore, an efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the light harvester to the catalytic site is always a prerequisite to trigger photocatalysis.3–5 Typically, an efficient hydrogen production catalyst does not always work on CO2 reduction, and vice versa. Therefore, at least three functional components, a light harvester (photosensitizer, PS), a catalytic center for proton reduction (H2 production site), and a catalytic center for CO2 reduction (CO production site), are necessary for a syngas production photocatalyst. Furthermore, there should be two PET processes from the PS, one to the proton reduction site and another to the CO2 reduction site. The excited electrons in the PS assigned to two catalytic sites should be in a suitable ratio, and this will guarantee the production of syngas with a reasonable CO:H2 ratio.
In this work, we report a novel hybrid ternary photocatalyst CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 for syngas production under visible light irradiation. CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 is composed of three components, TiO2 NPs, CdSe QDs, and a molecular cobalt catalyst (CoPh). These three components can be integrated via facile step-by-step self-assembly. TiO2 NPs are a well-known semiconductor having proton reduction activity. The surface of TiO2 NPs enables the conversion of protons to H2 by employing electrons in the conduction band (CB).12–18 However, this photoreduction works only under UV light irradiation due to the non-absorption of TiO2 NPs in the range of visible light. CdSe QDs have intrinsic advantages of broad visible-light absorption, multi-electron excitation, and easy preparation. These make the QDs widely used as a photosensitizer in artificial photosynthetic systems. Furthermore, CdSe QDs have been described to catalyze proton and/or CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation.5,19–23 In previous studies, cobalt complexes of the CoN4 structure exhibited high efficiency and selectivity of CO2-to-CO conversion in homogeneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems.24–29 In particular, the [Co(TPA)Cl]Cl (TPA = Tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) molecular catalyst is the most active one among them.26 To realize efficient assembly of [Co(TPA)Cl]Cl into inorganic TiO2 NPs or CdSe QDs, we induced a phosphate group onto the TPA ligand and synthesized CoPh (Scheme 1a). The phosphate group has been demonstrated to enable covalent coordination to the surface of TiO2 NPs or CdSe QDs.30–33 These three components can self-assemble into one ternary photocatalyst CoPh/CdSe@TiO2. The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst realized photocatalytic syngas production in a CO2-saturated N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor. The system robustly produced syngas during long-term photocatalysis (146 hours). The achieved catalyst mass-based efficiency of CO and H2 production was 571 μmol g−1 and 1554 μmol g−1, respectively. The CO:H2 ratio remained in the range of 1:0.6–1:2.7, which meets the requirements of syngas used in Fischer–Tropsch processes.

Results and discussion
To achieve stable anchoring of a molecular CO2 reduction catalyst onto the inorganic nanoparticles, TiO2 NPs and CdSe QDs, a novel phosphate modified [Co(TPA)Cl]Cl (CoPh) (Scheme 1a) was designed and synthesized. The [Co(TPA)Cl]Cl complex had been reported as an activated molecular catalyst for CO2 reduction in photocatalytic systems.24–27 As shown in Scheme 1a, we induced a phosphate group into the TPA ligand and synthesized a novel phosphate group functionalized TPA ligand (L3). Firstly, L1 was synthesized according to the method reported previously.24,34 Next, L1 and 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene were refluxed in THF to replace bromo with the –PO3Et2 group. Finally, L3 was obtained by hydrolysis in 6 M HCl aqueous solution. The new ligand L3 was characterized by 1H NMR, 31P NMR and MS (ESI,† Fig. S1). CoPh was synthesized by reaction of CoCl2·6H2O and L3 at room temperature. The CoPh in the solid state is a green powder, which was characterized by MS, IR, and UV-Vis absorption.
The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst was constructed through a step-by-step self-assembly method (Scheme 1b). Firstly, MPA-CdSe QDs (MPA = 3-mercaptopropionic acid) and TiO2 NP powders were ultrasonically mixed in an aqueous solution. The MPA ligand, containing a thiol group (–SH) and a carboxylic acid (–COOH) group, on the CdSe surface functions as a bifunctional linker to link CdSe QDs and TiO2via the thiol and carboxylate groups, respectively. Under these conditions, CdSe QDs covalently attached to the surface of TiO2 NPs to form a CdSe@TiO2 binary composite. Next, the CdSe@TiO2 binary composite was immersed in an aqueous solution of CoPh and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. Finally, the hybrid ternary photocatalyst CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 was obtained. The phosphate group enables it to chemically anchor onto the surface of either TiO2 NPs or CdSe QDs, which had been well-documented in the literature.30–33CoPh molecules therefore exist on both the surface of TiO2 NPs and CdSe QDs. The amount of CoPh or CdSe QD in the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst is 9.72 × 10−6 mol mg−1 or 11.64 μg mg−1, respectively, which were determined based on measuring the cobalt or cadmium amount, respectively, in the ternary composite by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES).
The morphology of the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in Fig. 1a, the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalysts are irregular spheres with diameters of ca. 25 nm. Under higher resolution (Fig. 1b), CdSe QDs can be observed. The QDs of ca. 3nm diameter distribute on TiO2. The QD crystal lattice (3.3 Å) can be recognized, which is in accordance with the (111) plane of the CdSe QD.20 Elemental mapping measurements (Fig. 1c) demonstrate that Ti, Cd, and Co distribute evenly in the ternary photocatalyst. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 composite shows characteristic peaks at 53.25 eV, 403.97 eV and 780.29 eV, which are attributed to Se 3d, Cd 3d and Co 2p orbitals, respectively (Fig. 1d). The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of CoPh/CdSe@TiO2, CdSe@TiO2, CdSe QDs, and TiO2 NPs are shown in Fig. 1e. In comparison with the TiO2 precursor showing an absorption silence in the range of 400–700 nm, both CdSe@TiO2 and CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 show absorption at 450 nm, which is characteristic of CdSe QDs. The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 also show absorption at 616 nm, which is assigned to the absorption of CoPh.24 There is no such absorption in the spectrum of the CdSe@TiO2 composite. The IR spectrum (Fig. 1f) of CdSe@TiO2 shows two peaks at 1386 cm−1 and 1427 cm−1, which are vibration absorption of the thiol groups in the MPA ligand.35 The newly emerged peaks at 1151 cm−1, 1310 cm−1, 1439 cm−1 and 1610 cm−1 in CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 are attributed to the vibration absorption of CoPh. All of these results indicate the successful fabrication of the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 ternary photocatalyst.

The photocatalytic performances of the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 ternary photocatalyst and CdSe@TiO2 binary photocatalyst were evaluated in a DMF solution containing TEOA as an electron donor (v(TEOA):v(DMF) = 1:4, total volume = 5.00 mL). As shown in Table 1, the standard sample (entry 1, Table 1) containing CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 (5.00 mg) in a CO2-saturated solution produced 0.75 μmol CO (150 μmol g−1) and 0.68 μmol H2 (136 μmol g−1) after 12 hours of irradiation under a blue LED lamp (λmax = 450 nm). The CO:H2 ratio is ca. 1:1. In contrast, the sample containing the CdSe@TiO2 binary composite (entry 2) under the same conditions produced 0.15 μmol CO (30 μmol g−1) and 4.00 μmol H2 (800 μmol g−1). The CO:H2 ratio is 1:27. Obviously, the CdSe@TiO2 binary composite, without a CoPh molecular catalyst, produced H2 as the main product. The sample (entry 3) containing CdSe QDs alone with an amount same as the standard sample produced only 0.03 μmol CO and 0.16 μmol H2. The amount of H2 produced by CdSe QDs at the same concentration is far less than that of the binary photocatalysts (entry 2), indicating that TiO2 NPs are responsible for H2 production. The sample (entry 4) containing CdSe QDs and CoPh with amounts the same as the standard sample produced 0.14 μmol CO and 0.39 μmol H2. Both H2 and CO amounts increased in the presence of CoPh, the CO amount increased 4.7 times while the H2 amount increased 2.4 times in comparison to those of the CdSe sample (entry 3). This indicates that CoPh enables the catalysis of both CO2 reduction and proton reduction, however, CO2 reduction is more selective to CoPh. Control experiments show that the samples produced little to no mixed gas (H2 + CO) if TEOA or light irradiation was absent (entry 5 and 6), demonstrating that TEOA and light irradiation are essential for efficient syngas production. The standard sample in a N2-saturated solution (entry 7) produced only 3.54 μmol H2 (708 μmol g−1), indicating that CO2 saturated in the solvent was the only source of CO formation. These findings indicate that (i) CoPh is the main site for CO2 reduction in the ternary photocatalysts; (ii) TiO2 NPs are the main site for H2 production; (iii) although CdSe QDs also catalyse CO and H2 formation under the present conditions, they mainly function as a photosensitizer to harvest visible light due to the low loading amount of CdSe QDs in the ternary photocatalysts and a small amount of gaseous products formed by the CdSe QDs at such a low loading amount. All the components, CdSe QDs, CoPh, and TiO2 NPs, are essential for efficient syngas production. CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 functions as a bifunctional photocatalyst for both CO2-to-CO and 2H+-to-H2 conversions.

We performed a long-term photocatalysis to evaluate the stability of the photocatalysts. The two systems, containing CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 or CdSe@TiO2 (5.00 mg) in CO2-saturated DMF/TEOA (v(TEOA):v(DMF) = 1:4, total volume = 5.00 mL) mixed solutions were irradiated for more than 140 hours. As shown in Fig. 2, these two systems maintain mixed gas production activity for more than 100 hours. The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 system produced CO and H2 mixed gas with a CO:H2 ratio in the range of 1:0.6–1:2.7. The CO selectivity in the first 5 hours reaches up to 63%. As time went by, the CO selectivity of the ternary system decreased slightly. At the end of photocatalysis (146 hours), the CO selectivity decreased to 27%, while the system produced 2.86 μmol CO (571 μmol g−1) and 7.77 μmol H2 (1554 μmol g−1). The decrease of CO selectivity might be caused by partial dissociation from the photocatalyst and degradation of CoPh under long-term irradiation. The CdSe@TiO2 system mainly produced H2 during long-term photocatalysis. At the end of photocatalysis, the system produced 17.72 μmol H2 (3528 μmol g−1) and 0.97 μmol CO (193 μmol g−1), and the H2 production selectivity is maintained at 95% during the whole photocatalysis. The CO production selectivity of the binary photocatalyst slightly increased from 3% at the beginning to 5% at the end. This is because MPA ligands dissociated from CdSe QDs, and the exposed surface of CdSe QDs functions as CO2 reduction sites under such conditions. This phenomenon had been well studied by our group previously.20,36 The total amount of gaseous products (CO + H2) generated from the binary system (18.69 μmol) is larger than that from the ternary system (10.63 μmol). This indicates that the CO formation rate is slower than that of H2 formation in the assembled photocatalysts as well as presumably the lower electron transfer efficiency from the QDs to CoPh in the ternary photocatalyst. These results exhibit high stability of the ternary photocatalyst for syngas photosynthesis. The CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst enables the production of CO and H2 with a reasonable ratio satisfying the requirements of syngas production. The binary photocatalyst, in the absence of CoPh, exhibits good H2 production activity. This controllable activity towards two important reactions, syngas production or H2 production, of the system can be achieved through facile anchoring or removing a small molecular catalyst.

To gain insights into this ternary photocatalyst, photophysical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 3a, CdSe QDs in DMF show characteristic dual emission, band-edge exciton emission at 470 nm and surface-trap emission at 630 nm, upon excitation at 350 nm.37,38 These two emissions can be effectively quenched by gradually increasing the amount of CoPh in solution. A dramatic quenching was observed in the first titration of CoPh. Presumably, this has resulted from CoPh anchoring onto the surface of CdSe QDs after the titration. The photoinduced energy transfer induced quenching can be excluded due to a small overlap between the absorption spectrum of CoPh and the emission spectrum of CdSe QDs (ESI,† Fig. S2). This quenching is attributed to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from CdSe QDs to CoPh.5,39,40 To further study the PET process between the QDs and CoPh, cyclic voltammetry was employed to measure the redox potential of CoPh (Fig. 3b). Upon reduction scan of CoPh in a 0.1 M nBu4NPF6 solution in DMF under a N2 atmosphere, two reduction processes at −1.23 V and −1.33 V (all potentials discussed here are vs. NHE) emerge, which are attributed to CoII/CoI and CoI/Co0 reduction, respectively.8,26,41,42 Under a CO2 atmosphere, a current intensity increase begins at the first reduction peak, which indicates that CO2 electrocatalysis occurs.8,26,42 According to our previous studies, the CoI species is attributed to the active species to bind CO2 in the course of CO2 electrocatalysis.8,26,41,42 The conduction band (CB) of CdSe QDs is −1.55 V, which is determined based on Mott–Schottky measurements (ESI,† Fig. S4). The photoinduced electron transfer from CdSe QDs to CoPh is thermodynamically feasible.

(b) Cyclic voltammograms of CoPh under N2 or CO2 atmospheres. (c and d) Transient photocurrent responses to the on–off illumination of TiO2, CdSe@TiO2 and CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 electrodes. 
In transient photocurrent measurements, the TiO2 NP loaded electrode shows a very small photocurrent of only 3.45 μA cm−2 upon irradiation with a Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm) (Fig. 3c). This is because of no obvious absorption of TiO2 NPs in the range of visible light (Fig. 1e).16 Next, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in an aqueous solution of CdSe QDs (2 mg mL−1) for 20 minutes to absorb CdSe QDs. The photocurrent of the CdSe@TiO2 composite increased obviously. This photocurrent intensity decays slightly in the next several cycles. This is probably caused by short-term immersion leading to weak binding of the QDs to the TiO2 NPs. The average photocurrent of the CdSe@TiO2 electrode is 64.95 μA cm−2, which is larger than that of the precursor TiO2 electrode. In this situation, CdSe QDs function as a photosensitizer, and the larger photocurrent of CdSe@TiO2 demonstrates that the photoelectrons generated in CdSe QDs conduct through TiO2 to the electrode.43–47 The presence of TiO2 enhances the charge separation in CdSe QDs and thus a larger photocurrent is generated. According to Mott–Schottky measurements (ESI,† Fig. S4), the conduction band of the TiO2 NPs is −0.39 V, so the electron transfer from the conduction band of the QDs to TiO2 is thermodynamically feasible. The photocurrent comparison between CdSe@TiO2 and CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3d. The average photocurrent density of CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 is 194.38 μA cm−2, which is 1.6 times higher than that of CdSe@TiO2. This indicates that CoPh consumes the photoelectrons generated in CdSe QDs, when the PET process from the conduction band of the QDs to CoPh occurs.5,39,40
Based on the above results, the photocatalytic mechanism of the ternary photocatalyst CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 is proposed (Scheme 2). Under visible light irradiation, CdSe QDs in the ternary photocatalyst are excited, electron–hole pairs are generated and subsequently the electrons (e−) and the holes (h+) migrate to the conduction band and valence band (VB), respectively, in the QDs. The electrons generated in the CB of the QDs have two pathways to transfer. A portion of the electrons transfers to CoPh to give CoI species. Another portion of the electrons transfer to TiO2. On the one hand, the CoI species as an active site binds CO2 and catalyses CO2 reduction to afford CO.8,26,42 This is the main route to CO formation of the ternary photocatalyst. In another hand, the surface of TiO2 NPs mediates proton reduction to generate H2 by using electrons received from the QDs.12,14,15 This is the main rate of H2 formation of the ternary photocatalyst. The holes in the VB of the QDs are consumed by the oxidation reaction of TEOA.36 According to the photocatalytic experiments and our previous studies,20,36 CdSe QDs also catalyses CO2 and proton reduction reactions, however, CdSe QDs are not the main catalytic sites for these two reactions under these conditions. The presence of TiO2 and CoPh makes CdSe QDs mainly function as a light harvester in the ternary photocatalyst. The TiO2 nanoparticles function as active sites for H2 generation. The binary photocatalyst CdSe@TiO2 mainly produces H2 under the same conditions. This indicates that TiO2 does not mediate CO2 reduction efficiently, presumably due to the low affinity of TiO2 to CO2. A trace amount of CO generated from the binary photocatalyst is mainly produced by CdSe QDs.20,36

Conclusions
In summary, a novel ternary photocatalyst CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 was fabricated. In this photocatalyst, CdSe QD functions as a visible light harvester, CoPh or TiO2 NPs play the role of a CO2 reduction site or proton reduction site, respectively. These three components were integrated based on covalent bonding via a facile step-by-step assembly. Mechanism studies revealed that photogenerated electrons in the CB of the QDs separately transfer to CoPh or TiO2 NPs. The CoI species or the surface of TiO2 NPs mediates the CO2-to-CO reaction or the hydrogen production reaction, respectively. This assembled ternary configuration endows the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 photocatalyst with bifunctional catalytic activities for simultaneously catalyzing proton and CO2 reduction to produce hydrogen and CO, respectively. The photocatalyst produced CO and H2 with high stability and a rational CO:H2 ratio, satisfying the syngas requirements used in industries.

Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry was performed in a three-electrode system (0.1 M nBu4NPF6 DMF solution) using a glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 electrode as a reference electrode, and a Pt wire as a counter electrode. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode cell system by using 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte.

The photoelectrode was prepared by spin-coating TiO2 or CdSe@TiO2 slurry on an FTO glass (d = 4 mm) and then drying at 40 °C, and the TiO2 electrode was immersed in an aqueous solution of CdSe QDs (2 mg mL−1) for 20 minutes to anchor CdSe QDs. Then the CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 electrode was prepared by immersing the CdSe@TiO2 electrode in an aqueous solution of CoPh (1 × 10−3 M) for 20 minutes to adsorb CoPh. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp with a light filter (λ > 420 nm).

After 24 h of stirring at r.t., most of the solvent was removed by vacuum distillation, and 5 wt% NaHCO3 aqueous solution and 5 wt% K2CO3 methanol solution were added to wash the crude product and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated in a vacuum to dryness. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel with a CH2Cl2/CH3OH mixture solvent to give L1 as a light yellow solid (yield 85%).
Synthesis of L2
The synthesis route of L2 is as follows: palladium acetate (8.5 mg, 0.038 mmol), potassium acetate (16 mg, 0.17 mmol), 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (42 mg, 0.076 mmol) and Et3N (0.27 mL, 1.9 mmol) were added to THF (5 mL) under a N2 atmosphere. After 15 min of heating, diethyl phosphite (0.16 mL, 1.27 mmol) and L1 (120 mg, 0.33 mmol) were added to the solution and heated at reflux for 12 hours under the protection of nitrogen until the reaction was complete. After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Finally, the product was collected by silica gel column chromatography on silica gel with the CH2Cl2/CH3OH mixture solvent to give L2 as a yellow solid (yield 71.2%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ = 8.82 (s, 1H), 8.49 (d, J = 2.72 Hz, 2H), 7.99–8.02 (m, 1H), 7.67 (d, J = 5.36 Hz, 1H), 7.62 (t, J = 5.08 Hz, 2H), 7.51 (d, J = 5.2 Hz, 2H), 7.12 (t, J = 4.28 Hz, 2H), 4.05–4.14 (m, 4H), 3.91 (s, 2H), 3.85 (s, 4H), 1.30 (t, J = 4.72 Hz, 6H) ppm. 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ = 163.80, 158.97, 151.77, 149.22, 139.96, 136.54, 123.91, 123.08, 122.57, 122.18, 62.51, 60.35, 60.03, 16.42 ppm. 31P NMR (162 MHz, CDCl3) δ = 16 ppm. MS m/z: calcd for C22H27N4O3P [M + H]+: 427.1899, found: 427.1893.
Synthesis of L3

L3 was synthesised according to a previous report.48L2 (50 mg, 0.13 mmol) was added to HCl aqueous (8 mL, 6 M) under stirring. The reaction mixture was refluxed with stirring for 48 hours, and after the reaction was complete, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and ethanol was added to the solution, and stirred for another 8 hours. The precipitate was filtered and washed with ethanol and ethyl acetate, and L3 was obtained as a white powder (yield 92.3%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ = 8.78 (s, 1H), 8.69 (d, J = 5.52 Hz, 2H), 8.54 (d, J = 9.52 Hz, 1H), 8.49 (t, J = 7.88 Hz, 2H), 8.01–8.06 (m, 3H), 7.91 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 4.38 (s, 4H), 4.35 (s, 2H) ppm. 13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O) δ = 152.97, 151.06, 147.93, 147.48, 143.43, 141.84, 127.50, 127.24, 127.13, 126.75, 56.40, 56.26 ppm. 31P NMR (162 MHz, D2O) δ = 3 ppm. MS m/z: calcd for C18H19N4O3P [M + H]+: 371.1273, found: 371.1253.
Synthesis of CoPh

CoPh was synthesised by coordinating with CoCl2·6H2O and L3. L3 (0.1 g, 0.277 mmol) and CoCl2·6H2O (0.1 g, 0.277 mmol) were added to a methanol solution and stirred. A green precipitate of CoPh was formed during stirring. The mixture was stirred for another 30 minutes. Then CoPh was obtained by centrifugation, washed with ether and dried at 40 °C under vacuum. MS m/z: calcd for C18H19Cl2CoN4O3P [M − Cl]+: 464.0215, found: 464.0224.
Preparation of CdSe@TiO2
CdSe QDs with the MPA ligand were synthesised according to previous reports,20,49,50 and P25 TiO2 was purchased by Adamas Co. Ltd. We anchored CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2 by covalent bonding. CdSe@TiO2 was prepared by adding TiO2 (100 mg) powder to an aqueous solution (5 mL) containing MPA-CdSe QDs (10 mg), and stirred for 24 hours under dark for CdSe QD anchoring as much as possible. The mercapto (–SH) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups of the MPA ligand as a bifunctional group linked CdSe QDs and TiO2, respectively. The formed precipitates from the mixture were collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and dried.
Preparation of CoPh/CdSe@TiO2

CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 was prepared by anchoring CoPh on the surface of TiO2 in CdSe@TiO2. CdSe@TiO2 (100 mg) was added to an aqueous solution (10 mL) containing CoPh molecules (5.00 mg, 1.0 × 10−3 M), and stirred for 24 hours under dark for CoPh anchoring as much as possible. The formed precipitates from the mixture were collected by centrifugation, rinsed and dried, and then CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 was obtained as a grey powder.
Photocatalysis
In a typical experiment of CO2 reduction, a stock DMF solution of CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 and TEOA was added. The standard sample contains CoPh/CdSe@TiO2 (5.00 mg) in a mixed solution of TEOA and DMF (v(TEOA):v(DMF) = 1:4, total volume = 5.00 mL). Then, the sealed photoreaction tube was bubbled using CO2 for 30 min. The sample is set in a photoreactor under irradiation with an LED lamp (λmax = 450 nm, LED power = 940 μW cm−2) at room temperature. The gaseous product was analyzed using a Shanghai Tianmei gas chromatograph (GC 7900) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) having a high-purity Ar carrier gas. CH4 was used as the internal standard.
