Interestingly, the crystals were found to exhibit polarization sensitive properties, with a polarization anisotropic ratio of 3, which was higher than that of aligned perovskite nanowire arrays (2.6).
Introduction
Halide perovskites have been widely investigated in recent years due to their outstanding performance in optoelectronic application fields such as photodetectors,1–4 light emitting diodes,5,6 lasers,7,8 and especially solar cells.9–16 CH3NH3PbI3 is a typical example and it has been widely used as an efficient layer in solar cells. Since the introduction of organic–inorganic perovskites, both the processing flexibility and power conversion efficiency of solar cells have been highly improved. However, the stability of organic–inorganic perovskites is poor, which are usually sensitive to water and would decompose under high humidity and/or high temperature conditions,17,18 decreasing the possibility of commercial use. Neat inorganic perovskites are found to exhibit superior environmental stability and have attracted much attention recently.
Studies on neat inorganic halide perovskites have been mainly focused on fabricating various nanostructures including 0D quantum dots,19–21 1D nanowires,22–24 and 2D nanosheets.25–27 Most of these solution synthesis procedures utilized oleic acid or oleylamine as stabilizing agents and the resulting products were nanometer in size. To understand the principle of intrinsic properties of bulk perovskites, synthesis of large crystals without ligands is of great importance. CsPbBr3 large crystals including microcrystals and centimeter-sized single crystals have already been successfully synthesized by a solution-growth method, and both optical and electrical properties have been intensively investigated.28–33 Nevertheless, in previous reports, CsPbCl3 single crystals could be fabricated mainly by the (improved) Bridgman method, in which high temperature (>600 °C) was utilized to melt the raw materials (CsCl and PbCl2).34–38 Green solution synthesis of CsPbCl3 large crystals is very important, but this kind of study is limited.39
Herein, we demonstrate a facile solution strategy to directly synthesize large-sized CsPbCl3 crystals on substrates. By tuning the parameters of the fabrication process, we have successfully obtained uniform micrometer-sized crystals. Interestingly, the crystals were found to exhibit polarization sensitive properties, with a polarization anisotropic ratio of 3, which was comparable to that of aligned perovskite nanowire arrays.40 All of these features and mechanisms are carefully elucidated below.
Experimental section
Materials
Butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH3, 99.5%) and hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PbCl2 (99.99%) and CsCl (99%) were purchased from Aladdin. Organic solvents including dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and ethyl acetate were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Methods
CH3(CH2)3NH3I was synthesized by referring to a previously reported method.41 Solutions of PbCl2 (0.1 M), CsCl (0.03 M), and CH3(CH2)3NH3I (0.1 M) were prepared by stirring these solids/powders in DMSO at 30 °C for 10 h. The solvent was selected mainly due to the sufficient solubility of CsCl in DMSO. The precursor solution was obtained by mixing these three kinds of solutions with a molar ratio of 2:3:2 at 30 °C for 1 h.
A Si/SiO2 substrate was washed with acetone and ethanol alternately 3 times before using. The substrate was transferred onto a heater and preheated at 80 °C, and 10 μL of precursor solution was dropped onto the hot SiO2/Si surface and maintained at 80 °C for 10 min. CsPbCl3 gradually crystallized out as the solvent evaporated. After washing with ethyl acetate 3 times, micrometer-sized CsPbCl3 crystals were obtained.
Characterization
Optical microscopy images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse LV100. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (ZEISS ULTRA-55). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained on a Rigaku Ultima X-ray IV diffractometer using CuKα radiation at 5° min−1. All the CsPbCl3 samples were grown on the Si/SiO2 substrate, and were directly utilized to obtain the XRD spectra. Reflection curves were obtained using a home-made optical system with an Ag mirror as a control.
Results and discussion
The CsPbCl3 crystals were synthesized through a solution phase strategy, as shown in Fig. 1. Solutions of PbCl2 (0.1 M), CsCl (0.03 M), and CH3(CH2)3NH3I (0.1 M) in DMSO were prepared and mixed sufficiently with a molar ratio of 2:3:2 to obtain the precursor solution. Then 10 μL of precursor solution was dropped onto an SiO2/Si substrate, which was placed on a heater (80 °C) in an atmospheric environment. As the solvent evaporated, CsPbCl3 crystals nucleated and grew larger. After heating for 10 minutes, the residual solvent and excess salt were washed off with ethyl acetate from the substrate, and CsPbCl3 microplates were left due to the adhesion effect. Compared with previously reported synthesis approaches of inorganic perovskite crystals including chemical vapor deposition (CVD),42 a multi-step traditional solution phase strategy of nanocrystals,25,26,43 and solution synthesis of single crystals,28–30,32 our solution phase synthesis strategy mainly exhibits the following four advantages: (1) crystals can be synthesized at a lower temperature (80 °C) even in an atmospheric environment; (2) our method is much more facile and the resulting crystals are much larger; (3) the microcrystals are directly grown on substrates, which are very convenient to do further research; (4) the total synthesis time is within 1.5 h, much shorter than the several hours–several days of single crystal synthesis. Thus our strategy has great potential for large scale production of perovskite microcrystals.

The morphology of the CsPbCl3 crystals was investigated by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the synthesized microcrystals are usually standard cuboids, with tens of micrometers in width and length, and several micrometers thick. The surfaces and edges are relatively smooth, indicating that the crystallization is sufficient and uniform. XRD and EDS were utilized to characterize the composition of the microcrystals. Four main peaks were found in the XRD pattern, which was in good agreement with the simulated pattern of CsPbCl3 (Fig. 2c). It can also be calculated from the data that d100 = 5.6, d101 = 3.96, d200 = 2.794 and d300 = 1.862 Å, which are indexed to a tetragonal (P4mm) phase with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.584 and c = 5.623 Å. These parameters have not been reported in previous publications, which are close to, but different from the experimental results of cubic CsPbCl3 single crystals (a = b = c = 5.605 Å).36Fig. 2d shows the elemental mapping of Cs, Pb, Cl, and I, respectively. Except for the I element, all other elements were found to be distributed evenly on the microcrystals. The atomic ratio of Cs, Pb, and Cl is 1:1:3 from the EDS spectra, further confirming that the microcrystals are CsPbCl3. Selected area electron diffraction was also conducted, and the bright circular spots confirmed the single-crystalline nature of the crystals (Fig. S1†), which were in good agreement with simulation results of CsPbCl3 crystals with a tetragonal (P4mm) phase (Fig. S2†).

We have tuned various parameters during the fabrication process to control the morphology and explore the crystal growth mechanism, including the heating temperature, time, and feeding ratio of raw materials. First, various heating temperatures were utilized to investigate the effect of temperature on the synthesis. The shape of the resulting crystals was found to be non-uniform and the size was very small both at a lower temperature (75 °C) and higher temperature (100 °C) (Fig. S3†). The evaporation rate of the solvent was proved to be essential in the synthesis procedure. Second, the morphology and composition of the products with different reaction times have been observed. As the heating time increased from 10 min to 13, 15, and 18 min, both the morphology and composition were very different from the smooth CsPbCl3 microcrystals. Fig. S4† shows the optical microscopy and SEM images of the products with a heating time of 13 min. The shape of the crystals was inhomogeneous, and a few crystals were connected with each other (Fig. 3a). The surfaces and edges were coarse, with lots of nanoplatelets arrayed on both the top and the side (Fig. 3b). The XRD pattern was rougher than that of CsPbCl3 microcrystals obtained at 10 min, although the emerged peaks still belonged to CsPbCl3 (Fig. 3g). With the heating time increased to 15 min, the surface of the crystals became much coarser, even porous, combined with lots of irregularly shaped crystals (Fig. 3c and d and S5†). The XRD pattern shows new peaks, which are attributed to CsICl, CsCl, and PbCl2, respectively (Fig. 3g). In this period, new crystals with different compositions crystallized out. After heating for 18 min, almost all the solvent evaporated, leaving lots of crystals (Fig. 3e and f and S6†). The surfaces, together with the edges of the crystals, were not uniform, with lots of nanoplates naked. In addition, there were many irregular assemblies of crystals, with nanocrystals arranged in various directions. The XRD pattern was similar to that of microcrystals obtained at 15 min, and by-products were also found (Fig. 3g).

According to the above experiments, we deduce that the synthesis process begins with crystallization of CsPbCl3. In the early stage, the crystallization rate is slow, and the morphology of the crystals is uniform. As the solvent evaporates, the crystallization rate increases, and thus the new generated crystals are disordered compared with the generated crystals in the early stage. Crystals with other compositions such as CsICl crystallized out, and some amounts of CsCl and PbCl2 also crystallized out. With the prolonged evaporation time, both the disorder characteristics and the composition of the crystals become complicated.
Since the resulting crystals were proved to be CsPbCl3 with the reaction time of 10 min, what was the function of CH3(CH2)3NH3I? We conducted two experiments to investigate the function of CH3(CH2)3NH3I: decreasing the amount of CH3(CH2)3NH3I by adjusting the feed ratio of PbCl2 (0.1 M), CsCl (0.03 M), and CH3(CH2)3NH3I (0.1 M) to 2:1:1 and totally without CH3(CH2)3NH3I. For the former, under the same synthesis conditions, the edges of the obtained crystals were rough, and there were lots of by-products near the crystals (Fig. 4a and S7†). Large and irregularly shaped pores emerged on the surface of some crystals (Fig. 4b). This complicated morphology indicated that these crystals were not suitable for further research, although EDS mapping and XRD proved that the main composition of the crystals was CsPbCl3 (Fig. 4c and S8†). For the latter condition, PbCl2 and CsCl were mixed in a ratio of 1:1(m), without adding CH3(CH2)3NH3I. The products were found mainly in four different irregular shapes, including two kinds of cuboid analogues, cube analogues, and octahedral analogues, shown in Fig. 5a–d and S9.† These crystals were proved to be CsPbCl3 by XRD and EDS mapping (Fig. S10† and 5e). Thus the amount of CH3(CH2)3NH3I would seriously affect the morphology of the resulting CsPbCl3 crystals.

Alkyl ammonium salts contain both hydrophobic long alkyl chains and hydrophilic ammonium ions, which usually generate micelles under relatively low solution concentration.44 As the ammonium cationic head group could strongly coordinate to Cl− ions by hydrogen bonds, these micelles may act as templates to lead the growth direction of the crystals. The preferential growth direction is relevant to selective binding of surfactants, which is attributed to the selective monolayer adsorption of alkyl ammonium salts onto crystal surfaces. If the surfactant–surfactant distance is near or equal to the spacing of two Cl− ions on specific crystal planes, these two would bind to each other.45,46 The formed lamellar micelles would act as templates to further direct the growth of CsPbCl3 microplatelets.
Interestingly, the obtained microcrystals were found to exhibit anisotropic reflections. As is shown in Fig. 6a, most of the microcrystals have a cuboid shape, with lengths of 20–80 μm and widths of 10–30 μm. Such a large size is important for further applications. Polarized optical microscopy images show that the CsPbCl3 microcrystals have birefractive properties, exhibiting different colors (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6c shows three enlarged microplates, similar to the photoluminescence photos, the color of edges is different from that inside. The reflection microscopy curves show that the reflection at 700 nm changes from 0.285 to 0.096 with increasing polarization angle (Fig. 6d), and the ratio is about 3, which is an exciting result compared with those of other polarization sensitive photodetectors such as aligned perovskite nanoarrays (polarization anisotropic ratio, 2.6).40

The large polarization anisotropic ratio could be attributed to the non-cubic crystal structure of the CsPbCl3 microplates, as well as the large thickness. Fig. S11† shows the simulated crystal data and XRD patterns of cubic and tetragonal structures. CsPbCl3 with a cubic structure (Pm3m) exhibits lattice parameters of a = b = c = 5.61 Å. As these structure parameters are all the same in x, y, and z directions, reflection properties are all the same in these three directions. However, for the tetragonal structure (P4mm), the lattice parameters are a = b = 5.584 and c = 5.623 Å, respectively. The structures of the three directions are not the same as each other, and the optical properties show anisotropic characteristics.
The reason for the tetragonal structure of the as-prepared CsPbCl3 crystals may be their phase transition properties. Similar to hybrid perovskites, neat inorganic CsPbCl3 crystals also exhibited complex phase transitions, which adopted a cubic phase at high temperatures. The phase transition temperatures of cubic to tetragonal, tetragonal to orthorhombic, and orthorhombic to monoclinic are 47, 42, and 37 °C, respectively.37,47 As the CsPbCl3 crystals were grown at 80 °C, a temperature which was higher than the highest phase transition temperature, the cubic phase should be obtained. However, after maintaining at 80 °C for 10 min, the raw products together with the wafer were removed from the hot pan, and the cubic phase could transform into the tetragonal phase as the temperature decreased. Although the tetragonal phase is thermodynamically metastable at room temperature, it may still be retained due to the fast cooling rate and slow phase transition kinetics.42
Conclusions
In summary, anisotropic CsPbCl3 microcrystals with lengths and widths of tens of micrometers have been synthesized by a facile solution phase strategy, and their growth mechanism has been investigated intensively. Benefitting from the tetragonal phase structure, the microcrystals were found to exhibit anisotropic optical properties, and the polarization anisotropic ratio is as large as 3. These results expanded the applications of inorganic perovskite crystals in optical fields such as polarization sensitive photodetectors.
