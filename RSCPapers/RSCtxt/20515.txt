    , Accepted 29th April 2013First published on 29th April 2013AbstractFollowing a computational-experimental approach, a highly luminescent β-diketonate-europium(III) complex containing 2-thenoyltrifluoracetonate (tta−) and 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10] phenanthroline (ephen) ligands, Eu(tta)3ephen (II), was theoretically studied by DFT/TD-DFT calculations, synthesized from Eu(tta)3(H2O)2(I) and fully characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry, TGA analysis, vibrational, UV-Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. For intramolecular energy transfer analysis purpose, Ln(NO3)3(ephen)2 [Ln = Eu (III), Gd (IV)] complexes were also synthesized and complexes I and III were theoretically studied. The organic–inorganic tri-ureasil matrix was used as a support for the immobilization of complex II and two hybrid samples were synthesized as a monolith (MtU5Eu-II) and as a thin film (FtU5Eu-II), characterized and its photoluminescence properties were compared with those of complex II. The photophysical properties of complex II benefit from the synergy between the excited-states of both ligands that create efficient energy transfer pathways to optimize the Eu3+ sensitization contributing to the large emission quantum yield (82 ± 8%), which is one of the highest so far reported for solid lanthanide β-diketonate complexes. Moreover, although the incorporation of complex II into the hybrid matrix is disadvantageous from the quantum yield point of view, MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II exhibit the highest emission quantum yields reported so far for Eu3+-containing hybrids (63 ± 6% and 48 ± 5%, respectively). Additionally, a significant improvement in the photostability under UV irradiation of the incorporated complex II is observed. The possibility of FtU5Eu-II to be used as a luminescent solar concentrator was evaluated and an optical conversion efficiency of ∼9% as well as an ability to boost up the Si-photovoltaic cell output to 0.5% were verified.
Introduction
The unique optical properties of luminescent lanthanide (Ln3+) complexes to emit well-defined narrow bands in different spectral ranges with relatively long lifetimes and high quantum yields make them appropriate for technological applications.1–4 The interest in these materials has progressively grown in the last two decades due to their wide range of potential photonic applications such as amplifiers for optical communications,5 components of the emitter layers in multilayer organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),6 tunable lasers,7 luminescent labels in advanced time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays,8 light concentrators for photovoltaic devices,9 luminescent thermometers10 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.11 The design of new organic photosensitizers has dominated the development of Ln3+-based optical materials in view of their high molar absorption coefficients and their efficient sensitization ability of the metal-centered luminescence. Although a large number of anionic ligands have been developed and tested for their ability to sensitize Ln3+ luminescence, β-diketones appear to be adequate sensitizers to meet the requirements.12,13 To date, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (Htta) is one of the most famous β-diketone ligands for sensitizing Eu3+ luminescence as the energy transfer from the tta (the conjugated base of Htta) to the Eu3+ ion is highly efficient.14–16 Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to improve the photoluminescence quantum yield of Eu3+ ions through the structural variation of the neutral ligand. In fact, nowadays it is well-accepted that the presence of the neutral ligand not only satisfies the high coordination number of the central Ln3+ ions, thus improving the coordination and thermal stability of the complexes, but can also have an important role in the absorption and sensitization luminescence processes, transferring the energy to other ligands or to the Ln3+ ions.17–22 In this respect, the photoluminescence properties of the complexes with the general formula Eu(tta)3·nL [with L = H2O, p-tolyl sulfoxide (PTSO), 1,10-phenantroline (phen) and DBSO (dibenzyl sulfoxide) and n = 1 or 2] vary considerably depending on the nature of L; for example, the emission quantum yields increase in the order L = H2O (23%),14 PTSO (57%),23 phen (69%)23 and DBSO (85%).14
The rational design of efficient emitting Ln3+ complexes by the combination of suitable anionic and neutral ligands acting as emission sensitizers is an important area of research, but is still lacking an appropriate strategy to predict how their photophysical properties can benefit from the synergy between both first-sphere ligands by the establishment of additional and efficient neutral-to-anionic and anionic-to-neutral ligand energy transfer channels. Apart from the well-established ligand-to-Ln3+ intramolecular energy transfer24,25 and the unprecedented Ln3+-to-ligand intermolecular energy transfer involving a Eu3+/Tb3+mixed system,26 the concept of ligand synergy in order to optimize the metal luminescence sensitization has already been verified experimentally by some of us.27 However, it accounts for an indirect neutral-to-anionic ligand energy transfer channel as the neutral ligand was out of the first-coordination sphere.27
In this paper, we suggest an a priori strategic planning to improve the luminescence properties of Ln3+ complexes by engineering the synergy between the excited-states of two distinct first-sphere ligands. By combining computational and experimental tools in an interdisciplinary approach, different ligands can be a priori evaluated in view of their ability to: (i) absorb approximately in the same region; (ii) efficiently sensitize the metal luminescence by ligand-to-metal energy transfer and (iii) promote efficient neutral-to-anionic and anionic-to-neutral ligand energy transfer. This is a necessary step that must be taken in the near future to pave the way to the rational design of such materials with improved luminescence properties.
Consideration of the foregoing strategy led us to synthesize, fully characterize and theoretically study by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT calculations a new highly luminescent β-diketonate-Eu3+ complex, Eu(tta)3ephen, containing the epoxidised phenanthroline, 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10] phenanthroline (ephen), as the neutral ligand. The improvement mechanism of intramolecular energy transfer operated by the synergy between the lowest ligand-centered excited singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states of both tta and ephen ligands was a priori theoretically suggested by TD-DFT calculations and confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy. In view of this, the Eu(tta)3(H2O)2 and the model Ln(NO3)3(ephen)2[Ln = Eu, Gd] complexes were also considered and synthesized.
The rather low thermal and photochemical stability together with poor mechanical properties and photodegradation upon UV exposure are important disadvantages concerning the technological applicability of the Ln3+ β-diketonate complexes. Their incorporation into polymers,26,28 liquid crystals,29 organic–inorganic hybrid materials,27,30–35 Zeolite L,36 mesoporous materials,37,38 silica nanoparticles39,40 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes41 overcomes these drawbacks and provides hybrid materials with high potential for different applications.4,27,30–32,42–45 For the above mentioned reasons, we investigate the structure and photoluminescence features of a novel highly luminescent and photostable sol–gel derived urea cross-linked tripodal siloxane-based hybrid (classed as tri-ureasil)46–48 incorporating the newly synthesized Eu(tta)3ephen complex. Additionally, as Ln3+-based materials49–51 as well as transparent thin films of Ln3+-based hybrids find applicability as luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs),52–54 a brief description of the properties of the present system from the viewpoint of LSCs is also discussed.

The general method for the synthesis of the precursor Eu(tta)3(H2O)2 complex I and Eu(tta)3ephen complex II is given in Fig. 1A and they were prepared according to the conventional method described in the literature:55,56 (a) the synthesis of complex I is reported in detail in the ESI;† (b) for the synthesis of complex II a mixed solution of 0.1003 g (0.12 mmol) of I and 0.0225 g (0.12 mmol) of the ephen ligand in 10 mL of ethanol was refluxed for 4 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After refluxing the solution was collected at room temperature and kept until precipitation. The white solid was filtered off, washed with water, dried and purified by recrystallization from an ethanol–acetone mixture. Unfortunately, all efforts to grow single crystals were unsuccessful.

Synthesis of MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II hybrid materials. 
The structure of the organic–inorganic hybrid precursor, the so-called tri-urea-propyltriethoxysilane (t-UPTES), is outlined in Fig. 1C. The hybrids will be hereafter designated as t-U(5000), in which t stands for tripodal, U indicates the presence of urea cross-linkages and 5000 is related to the average molecular weight of the organic precursor in g mol−1.46,47 The t-U(5000) synthesis was performed according to the experimental procedure described in detail previously.46,47 The doped tri-ureasil hybrid matrix containing complex II was prepared as a monolith (MtU5Eu-II) and as a thin film (FtU5Eu-II). The cross-links involving the organic and the inorganic components were formed by reacting the NH2 groups of Jeffamine® T5000 with the –NCO group of ICPTES, in THF, under stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The non-hydrolyzed t-UPTES(5000) precursor (Fig. 1C) was obtained as a transparent oil after evaporation of THF under stirring at room temperature in a N2 atmosphere. To obtain the monolith and thin film, 20 mg (0.0198 mmol) of complex II were dissolved in EtOH. This ethanolic solution was added to the t-UPTES(5000) (VEtOH/Wt-UPTES(5000) ratio = 2:3 (2 mL per 3 g)) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Moreover, a volume (0.540 mL) of HCl (0.05 mol L−1) was added to this solution to catalyze the hydrolysis reactions. Then, this solution was stirred at room temperature for 20 min. MtU5Eu-II was obtained by casting the remaining solution into a polystyrene mold (1.5 × 1.5 × 6.0 cm3). The gelation time was around 24 h at room temperature. The obtained monolith was aged for seven days at 45 °C in an oven. FtU5Eu-II was deposited by spin-coating on borosilicate glass substrates at a speed of 4000 rpm for 40 s. Then, the film was dried at 45 °C for 48 h in an oven. The film thickness value (9.87 ± 0.01 μm) and the refractive index dispersion curve (Fig. S6 in the ESI†) were measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry (vide infra).

Characterization
Elemental analyses for C, H, N and S were performed with a CHNS-932 elemental analyzer under standard combustion conditions and handling the samples in air. High resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) measurements were accomplished using an electrospray ionization technique (ESI). All experiments were performed on an ApexQe FTICR Mass Spectrometer from Bruker Daltonics equipped with a combined Apollo II electrospray/MALDI ion source and a 7 T actively shielded superconduting magnet. Samples were introduced via an infusion pump at a flow rate of 120 μL h−1 into the ESI source using an infusion pump. The applied spray potential was 4.5 kV and the capillary temperature was set at 200 °C. All remaining parameters were optimized to ensure the highest abundance possible for the ions of interest. All MS data were acquired in the positive ion mode and the full scan spectra were recorded in the m/z 50–1200 range. Prior to all MS experiments a calibration step was performed with a 2.8 × 10−6 M solution of polyethyleneglycol 200 in HPLC grade methanol acidified with 0.1% (v/v) of formic acid. All errors of measured m/z ions were found to be below 10 ppm compared to the expected values. The europium content was determined by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy) analysis on a Horiba-Jobin Yvon model Activa-M. Thermogravimetric (TGA) studies were performed using a Shimadzu TGA-50 system at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, under a static atmosphere of air. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed using a Setaram DSC 131 differential scanning calorimeter. IR spectra (FT-IR) were obtained as KBr pellets using a MATTSON 7000 FTIR Spectrometer. The spectra were collected in the 350–4000 cm−1 range by averaging 64 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FT-IR spectra were measured on the same instrument equipped with a Specac Golden Gate Mk II ATR accessory having a diamond top-plate and KRS-5 focusing lenses. The FT-Raman spectra were recorded on a FT Bruker RFS-100 spectrometer using a Nd:YAG laser (Coherent Compass-1064/500N) with an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm. The spectra were collected in the 150–4000 cm−1 range at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the ethanolic solutions were measured at room temperature on a JASCO V-560 instrument with a scan range of 220–850 nm, at 200 nm min−1 and a resolution of 0.5 nm. For FtU5Eu-II, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum was recorded at room temperature, using a dual-beam spectrometer Lambda 950 (Perkin-Elmer), with a 150 mm diameter Spectralon integrating sphere. The significant increase in the absorbance values below 350 nm is due to borosilicate that is used as a substrate for FtU5Eu-II. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded at 10 K and at room temperature with a Horiba Scientific modular double grating excitation spectrofluorimeter with a TRIAX 320 emission monochromator (Fluorolog-3) coupled to a R928 Hamamatsu photomultiplier, using the front face acquisition mode. The excitation source was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. The emission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response of the spectrofluorimeter and the excitation spectra were corrected for the spectral distribution of the lamp intensity using a photodiode reference detector. The emission decay curves were acquired with the same instrumentation, using a pulsed Xe–Hg lamp (6 μs pulse at half-width and 20–30 μs tail). The photostability experiments were performed at room temperature on the same setup employed to measure the luminescence spectra under irradiation at 365 nm for a maximum exposure time of 10 h. The irradiation power was quantified using a Coherent power meter (Field MaxII-TOP) coupled to a Coherent high-sensitivity silicon photodiode optical sensor (diameter of 7 × 10−3 m, OP-2 VIS), yielding irradiance values of 105 W m−2. The room temperature emission quantum yields (ϕ) were measured using the C9920-02 measurement system from Hamamatsu with a 150 W Xe lamp coupled to a monochromator for wavelength discrimination, an integration sphere as a sample chamber and a multichannel analyzer for signal detection. Three measurements were made for each sample and the average values obtained are reported with accuracy within 10% according to the manufacturer. The spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were performed using an AutoSE ellipsometer (Horiba Scientific) with a total of 218 points in the wavelength interval of 500–850 nm, an incidence angle of 70°, an acquisition time of 50 ms per point and an average of 20 measurements per point. The structural model used consists of a three-layered structure incorporating a substrate, an organic–inorganic hybrid layer and air as ambient medium with a refractive index value of 1.00 (Fig. S7A in the ESI†). The thickness of the substrate was considered infinite and the refractive index was obtained by direct inversion of the ellipsometric data (not shown). To describe the refractive index values of FtU5Eu-II (Fig. S6 in the ESI†) the Lorentz model was used, which expresses the relative complex dielectric constant as a function of the frequency (ω) described by eqn (1), (1)where ε∞, εs, ω0(eV), and Γ (eV) are the high frequency relative dielectric constant, the static relative dielectric constant, the oscillator resonant frequency and the damping factor, respectively.58 The experimental ellipsometric parameters and the respective fit are shown in Fig. S7B of the ESI.† The fit method has been described elsewhere.59 The reported values for the thickness and refractive index are the average of three measurements performed for each sample with a maximum standard deviation of 5%.

Theoretical and computational details. 
As recent investigations have shown that the hybrid density functional B3LYP (Becke–Lee–Young–Parr composite of exchange correlation functional) method60,61 is reliable for the description of geometrical parameters and the electronic structure of Ln3+ complexes62–66 and considering that f orbitals do not play a major role in Eu-ligand bonds67 we use the B3LYP/ECP approach (Effective Core Potential including the N 4f electrons for Eu by Dolg et al.68–70). With this approach, the Eu3+ ion becomes a closed-shell, so the complexes have an even number of electrons leading to a ground-state singlet (S0). Therefore, we do not consider the excited states for intra-4f transitions in the Eu3+ ion but only the excited states for ligand excitations. Standard 6-31G and 6-31G* basis sets were employed for C, H, O, F, N and S atoms, respectively. The molecular structures of Eu(tta)3(H2O)2complex I, Eu(tta)3ephen complex II (A and B forms), and Eu(NO3)3(ephen)2 complex III were fully optimized without symmetry restrictions by the gradient procedure (Tables S1–S4 in the ESI†). Harmonic vibrational wavenumbers were calculated at the same level, using analytical second derivatives, for the optimized geometries, confirming that the matrices of the energy second derivatives (Hessians) have no imaginary eigenvalues (real minima geometries). Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations71 were performed on the optimized geometries at the same level as the geometry optimization to derive vertical electronic excitation energies (Franck–Condon transitions). The solvent effects were included via the polarizable continuum model (PCM).72 The solvent used in the PCM calculations was ethanol and the united atom topological model radii were employed to generate the solute cavity within the PCM implementation. Oscillator strengths were deduced from the dipole transition matrix elements. All quantum chemistry calculations were performed with a Gaussian 03W – Revision D.02 program package73 using its default criteria.

Results and discussion
Vibrational analysis
Valuable information about the effect of incorporating complex II within the constrained environment of the t-U(5000) matrix may be gained from the vibrational analysis of the spectral signatures of the polyether backbone and of urea linkages of the t-U(5000) matrix. Fig. 2 displays the FT-IR (750–2000 cm−1 region) and Raman (2700–3100 cm−1 region) spectra recorded for the nondoped t-U(5000) [trace (a)] and MtU5Eu-II [trace (b)] hybrids (the complete FT-IR and Raman spectra are depicted in Fig. S8 and S9 of the ESI,† respectively).
 Fig. 2  FT-IR (750–2000 cm−1) and Raman (2700–3100 cm−1) spectra of t-U(5000) (a) and MtU5Eu-II (b) hybrid samples. Amplified FT-IR amide I and II regions (inset). 
The vibrational bands of t-U(5000) are very strong and broad and as the concentration of the Eu3+ complex is too low (Eu3+ complex content versus the total hybrid's mass = ∼0.1%) most of the bands due to complex II are not evident. Analysis of the t-U(5000) spectrum [Fig. 2, trace (a)] leads us to divide the vibration bands into two groups, namely vibrations originating from the polyether backbone and from urea [NHC(O)NH] linkages and, for which, the assignment proposed below is based on those reported elsewhere for the FT-IR spectra of tri-ureasils46,47 and analogous urea derived organic–inorganic hybrids (so-called di-ureasils).74–76 Concerning the polyether backbone FT-IR signatures in the 750–1500 cm−1 region, the medium-to-weak intensity band at 927 cm−1 provides evidence that in tri-ureasil the PEO chains attain complete disorder and the medium intensity peak at 1014 cm−1 is attributed to the strong coupled vibrations of CH2 rocking and C–O and C–C stretching modes. The most intense FT-IR band, attributed to the C–O stretching mode, is found at 1106 cm−1 and the broad envelope bands with maxima at 1251 and 1375 cm−1 are related to CH2 twisting and wagging modes, respectively.
Concerning the polyether backbone Raman signatures in the 2700–3100 cm−1 region [Fig. 2, trace (a)], the t-U(5000) spectrum presents three narrower intense bands at 2871, 2933 and 2973 cm−1 assigned to the CH2 symmetric and asymmetric and CH3 asymmetric stretching νC–H modes, respectively. The spectral signatures of the urea [NHC(O)NH] linkages are observed in two FT-IR distinct regions, namely 1500–1600 cm−1 and 1600–1800 cm−1, and are related to the so-called “amide II” and “amide I” vibrations, respectively. The “amide II” mode, which is a mixture of C–N and C–C stretching modes and the in-plane bending mode of the N–H group, is located at 1567 cm−1 and does not change when complex II is incorporated (inset of Fig. 2). In turn, for the “amide I” vibration, a highly complex vibration associated essentially with the CO stretching mode,46,47,76 although the shoulder at 1720 cm−1 remains unchanged, the profile of the band maxima at 1644 cm−1 slightly changes (inset of Fig. 2). In this region, the profile of the “amide I” band of t-U(5000) produces four individual components at ca. 1724, 1700, 1664 and 1640 cm−1 (obtained by classical curve-fitting procedures46,47). The bands at ca. 1724, 1700, and 1664 cm−1 are ascribed to CO groups of disordered hydrogen-bonded POP/urea aggregates of increasing strength while the 1640 cm−1 feature is assigned to CO groups included in significantly more ordered hydrogen-bonded urea/urea aggregates.46,47,76 Therefore, the observed profile change upon complex II incorporation could be interpreted as a result from modifications of the hydrogen bond network of the t-U(5000) host material involving the amide groups.
Structural and electronic properties
DFT calculations were performed for both isomeric Eu(tta)3ephen (II) complexes, namely form A (Fig. S10 and Table S2 in the ESI†) and form B (Fig. S11 and Table S3 in the ESI†) which are distinguished by the epoxide group of the ephen ligand situated above and below the plane defined by the β-diketone(Eu;O3;O4). Since the results showed that form B is favoured by ca. 1.49 kJ mol−1 relative to form A, the TD-DFT calculations were performed with structure B. Its energy-minimized structure is shown in Fig. S11 of the ESI† together with the calculated metal-bond distances. The complex is octa-coordinate with six oxygen atoms from tta ligands and two nitrogens from the neutral ephen ligand forming a distorted square antiprismatic geometry. The Eu–O and Eu–N bond distances are within the 2.357–2.446 Å and 2.643–2.669 Å range, respectively. Despite the Eu–O distances being slightly higher than the experimental values observed in Eu(tta)3 analogue complexes,77–79 the Eu–N distances are similar to the experimental values for tris(dibenzolmethanido) europium(III) phenanthroline (Eu–N 2.641 Å)80 and tris(acetylacetonate) europium(III) diethyl 1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-dicarboxylate (Eu–N 2.670 Å)81 complexes.
In order to provide the framework for the excited state TD-DFT results, it will be useful to examine the electronic structure in terms of the HOMO (H) and LUMO (L) molecular orbitals for complex II (form B). The molecular orbital compositions (H-12 through L+5, in EtOH solvent) relevant to the interpretation of the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 3) are listed in Table S5 of the ESI and in Fig. S12 of the ESI† (that displays the energies and the electronic character of the H and L orbitals). The H−2, H−1, H, L, L+1 and L+2 orbitals are mainly composed of the tta π orbitals while the L+3, L+4 and L+5 are localized on the ephen ligand (Table S5†).

Fig. 3 shows the normalised UV-Vis absorption spectra of complex II and of MtU5Eu-II in ethanolic solutions compared with the calculated transitions (TD-DFT) for complex II. The electronic absorption spectrum of complex II (Fig. 3, black line) shows five broad bands with maxima at 267, 288, 299, 309 and 340 nm arising from the sum of the tta and ephen ligands (the normalised spectra of tta and ephen ligands are depicted in Fig. S13 of the ESI†). According to the TD-DFT calculations including the EtOH solvent effects (Fig. 3, blue line), five dipole-allowed singlet–singlet transitions calculated at 234, 276, 286, 290 and 324 nm are expected (Table 1).

On the basis of the molecular orbitals involved in the dominant excitation of each absorption (Tables 1 and S5†), the observed bands at 288, 309 and 340 nm (with correspondence to the calculated ones at 276, 290, and 324 nm) are assigned to excitations predominantly involving singlet intraligand (1IL) π → π*tta transitions although with some minor contributions from the ephen ligand. In turn, the bands at 267 and 299 nm (with correspondence to the calculated ones at 234 and 286 nm) receives a great contribution of the 1IL π → π*ephen transitions.
Comparing the absorption spectrum of MtU5Eu-II (Fig. 3, red line) with that of complex II (Fig. 3, black line), obvious differences in the absorption bands attributed to both tta and ephen ligands are observed. The red shift (340 → 344 nm) suggests that the electron distribution of the conjugated system involving the tta chelated ring changed when complex II was incorporated into the tri-ureasil matrix. Additionally, a significant intensity increase is observed for the bands with maxima at 288, 299 and 309 nm and apparently without any wavenumber displacement, suggesting that both tta and ephen ligands are slightly affected with the incorporation of complex II within the constrained environment of the t-U(5000) matrix. As these results demonstrate the integrity of the first-sphere ligands in the hybrid material, the structural changes are expected to occur outside the coordination polyhedron. The same conclusion has already been reached for an analogous hybrid system based on the Eu(tta)3phen complex and the poly(ε-caprolactone)siloxane organic–inorganic biohybrid.82
Ligand-centered excited states and intramolecular energy transfer pathways
The commonly accepted excitation mechanism for Ln3+ luminescence involves energy transfer from the excited T1 state (which is itself populated by intersystem crossing – ISC – from the excited S1 state) to the lower-lying Ln3+ excited states.24,25 In addition, the singlet pathway for the Ln3+ luminescence, in which the excited-state energy is directly transferred from its S1 state to the intra-4f states of the Ln3+ center, is nowadays well accepted.83 Although it is considered that the efficiency of energy transfer defined only in terms of the ISC and triplet antenna energy is an oversimplification of the energy transfer process, which is intricate,16 these relationships are nonetheless a useful trend to a rational design of Ln3+ complexes with improved luminescence properties. Following the strategic planning previously defined, the predicted absorption properties of complexes I and III (Fig. 4) were obtained from the TD-DFT calculations performed on the respectively B3LYP optimized structures (Tables S1 and S4,† respectively).
 Fig. 4  Calculated TD-DFT absorptions for complex I (black line) and complex III (red line). 
The singlet states with the largest oscillator strengths were predicted to occur at 30960 cm−1 (323 nm) and 34247 cm−1 (292 nm) for complexes I and III, respectively (Fig. 4) and the lowest-energy excited S1 state was calculated at 26385 cm−1(379 nm) for complex I and 30120 cm−1 (332 nm) for complex III. The vertical excitation energies of the lowest T1 states were also calculated and values of 19084 cm−1(524 nm) and 24510 cm−1(408 nm) were predicted for complexes I and III, respectively. According to these results, apart from the expected sensitization ability of the Eu3+ luminescence, it is expected that the photophysical properties of tta and ephen ligands enable them to absorb in the same region as well as allow them to operate efficient energy transfer pathways between their S1 and T1 states.
To confirm the effect of ephen on sensitizing Eu3+ luminescence by energy transfer with tta or directly to the central ion, the ligand-centered excited S1 states of complexes I and III and the excited T1 state of complex IV were experimentally characterized. As under UV illumination a red luminescence is emitted from complex III and as the ephen ligand is the only sensitizer present herein (the nitrate ions are not active as far as photophysical properties are concerned), the ephen excited states can populate directly the Eu3+ excited levels, as discussed below. The energy levels of the S1 states of the coordinated tta and ephen ligands were extracted from the corresponding complex I and complex III absorption spectra and the T1 states were measured from the phosphorescence spectra of the Gd(tta)3(H2O)2 complex16 and complex IV. Because the lowest excited energy level of the Gd3+ ion (6P7/2) is too high in energy to accept energy transfer from the ligand, disabling, therefore, any ligand-to-metal energy transfer process, the T1 energy level of the ligand is not significantly affected by the Gd3+ ion. The S1 energy levels of the coordinated tta and ephen are estimated by referring to the wavelengths of UV-Vis absorbance edges (Fig. S14 in the ESI†), which are 25126 cm−1(398 nm) and 30303 cm−1 (330 nm) respectively. The T1 energy level of tta, 19048 cm−1(525 nm), was taken from the literature.16 For the ephen ligand, Fig. S15 of the ESI† shows the 10 K time-resolved emission spectra of complex IV revealing a T1 energy of 21978 cm−1(455 nm). The three observed peaks centered at ca. 19231 cm−1 (520 nm), 18248 cm−1 (548 nm) and 17241 cm−1 (580 nm) may be ascribed to a resolvable vibrational fine structure originating from a single T1 state (the energy of which, 995 ± 12 cm−1, may be originated from the vibrational mode of ephen at 1012 cm−1). On the basis of the above experimental results, the schematic energy level diagram for complex II with the possible energy transfer pathways can be drawn as shown in Fig. 5. The values of the Eu3+ electronic levels arise from the free ion at intermediate coupling.84

Dashed arrows: (a) blue (S1 → T1 and S′1 → T′1 between the same ligand); (b) green (S1 → T′1 and S′1 → T1 between different ligands); (c) red (S1 → S′1 and T1 → T′1 between different ligands); black (T1 → 5D1 and T′1 → 5D1 most probable channels for the intramolecular energy transfer process to the Eu3+ luminescence); cyan (5D1 → 5D0 nonradiative relaxation). Solid black arrow: 5D0 → 7F0–6 radiative transition. 
Considering the resonant conditions of the S1 energy levels of ephen and tta, the energy gap seems appropriate to improve energy transfer from S1 of ephen to that of tta. Furthermore, part of S1 energy of ephen can be transferred to its own T1 and/or to the T1 level of tta and further to the Eu3+ efficiently and thus tta and ephen ligands are well suited for effective energy transfer to the 5D1 and 5D0 states of the Eu3+ ion. Additionally, it should be noted that, in spite of their similar T1 energy levels, an energy transfer from T1 of ephen to that of tta is also possible. Therefore, it is expected that the synergy between the S1 and T1 states of both ligands will promote efficient energy transfer pathways to optimize the Eu3+ sensitization process with a high emission quantum yield.
Photoluminescence studies

Fig. 6A compares the room temperature emission features of complex II with those of MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II. The spectra display the intra-4f6 5D0 → 7F0–4 transitions, the energy, relative intensity and full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of which depend on the sample, as detailed below. The emission spectra of MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II are almost independent of the processing (monolith or thin film) indicating the same average Eu3+-local environment. Considering the fact that Gd(tta)3ephen displays efficient emission at room temperature (not shown), the absence of the ligand related emission in the emission spectra of the Eu3+-based materials strongly suggests efficient ligand-to-metal intramolecular energy transfer. The excitation spectrum of complex II reveals a broad band (fwhm ∼ 150 nm) in the UV/blue spectral region with two main components at ca. 280 nm and ca. 340–380 nm and a very-low relative intensity intra-4f6 line ascribed to the 7F0 → 5D2 transition, readily indicating that the ligand-excited states are the main intra-4f6 population path (inset in Fig. 6A). Through the comparison between the excitation spectra of complexes I and III acquired using the same experimental conditions (Fig. S16 in the ESI†), we may ascribe the high- and low-wavelength regions to the preferential excitation of the ephen and tta excited states, respectively. Apart from a minor blue shift (∼10 nm) of the maximum intensity peak position, the spectrum of MtU5Eu-II resembles that of the isolated complex II indicating that the ligand-excited states remain the main population for the Eu3+ levels (inset in Fig. 6A). The processing of the hybrid material as a thin film induces a blue-shift of the excitation spectrum with respect to that of the monolith (inset in Fig. 6A), as previously reported for other organic–inorganic hybrids52,53,85 being attributed to differences in the gelation times (hours for the bulk and seconds for the films) which modulates the degree of organization of the materials.

The inset in (A) shows the excitation spectra monitored at 612 nm. (C–E) Magnification of the 5D0 → 7F0–2 transitions, respectively acquired at 10 K. 
To further discuss changes in the Eu3+-local environment after the incorporation into the tri-ureasil host, the intra-4f6 transitions were scanned with higher resolution at room-temperature and at 10 K under distinct excitation wavelengths (Fig. 6B–E, S17 and S18 in the ESI†). Apart from minor changes in the relative intensity of the Stark components, all emission spectra are independent of the excitation wavelength. Focusing our attention on complex II and MtU5Eu-II (Fig. 6B), the 10 K emission spectrum of the former reveals a single component for the non-degenerate 5D0 → 7F0 transition (Fig. 6C) peaking at 17249.0 ± 0.1 cm−1 with a fwhm of 13.7 ± 0.2 cm−1 and a J-degeneracy splitting of the 7F1,2 levels in 5 and 10 Stark components, respectively (marked with arrows in Fig. 6D and E). This indicates that, on average, the Eu3+ ions occupy two distinct low symmetry sites without an inversion center, in accordance with the higher intensity of the electric-dipole 5D0 → 7F2 transition, probably ascribed to the presence of the two isomeric Eu3+ complexes (forms A and B, Fig. S10 and S11†). After the inclusion into the tri-ureasil host, the 5D0 → 7F0 transition of the MtU5Eu-II emission spectrum deviates to the red (17247.4 ± 0.1 cm−1) and becomes larger (fwhm of 22.1 ± 0.1 cm−1), readily indicating modifications in the Eu3+-local coordination due to an effective interaction with the hybrid host. The J-degeneracy splitting of the 7F1,2 levels into 3 and 5 Stark components (Fig. 6D and E) and the higher intensity of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition point out that the Eu3+ ions in the hybrid occupy the same average local environment characterized by a low-symmetry group without an inversion centre. The transitions broadening is in accordance with a higher non-homogeneous distribution of similar Eu3+ chemical environments due to changes outside the coordination polyhedron, essentially related to the amorphous local structure of the host that accommodates the Eu3+ first-coordination sphere in slightly different ways (and also leading to slight modifications in the phonon density distribution).82
The 5D0 lifetime values were measured as a function of the excitation wavelength (into the 5D2 level at 464 nm and via the ligand excited states between 270 and 380 nm) for complex II, MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II through the monitoring of the emission decay curves within the 5D0 → 7F2 transition. All the curves are well described by a single exponential function (Fig. S19–S21 in the ESI†), in good agreement with the presence of a single Eu3+-local environment in the hybrids and with the possible existence of two isomers with indistinguishable lifetime values in complex II. The calculated 5D0 lifetime values are listed in Table 2.

The 5D0 lifetime dependence with the excitation wavelength for the three materials follows a behavior recently addressed by some of us86 indicating that ligand-to-Eu3+energy transfer processes are operative and mediated by an intermediate state (a ligand-to-metal charge transfer band or the T1 state of tta, Fig. 5) in near-resonance with the Eu3+emitting levels. Whereas MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II display similar lifetime values under identical excitation wavelength conditions (indicating that the processing as thin films and as monoliths do not induce major changes in the Eu3+ first coordination sphere), the 5D0 lifetime values of complex II are higher reinforcing that changes occurred in the Ln3+ coordination shell after the hybrids' incorporation.
The emission features were further quantified by the measurement of the absolute emission quantum yield (Table 2). Interestingly and according to the expectations, complex II displays a high and constant quantum yield (82 ± 8%) under UV excitation between 270 and 380 nm, indicating that both ligands (tta and ephen) efficiently contribute to the Eu3+ excitation. It should be emphasized that this emission quantum yield is one of the highest so far reported for solid Ln3+ β-diketonate complexes being comparable with the highest one reported for the Eu(tta)3(DBSO)2 complex (85%).14
After the incorporation into the hybrid host, the quantum yield decreases to 63 ± 6% and 48 ± 5%, for excitation within the tta-excited states around 360–380 nm, for MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II, respectively. Under preferential excitation within the ephen-related states (270–280 nm) lower values are found (50 ± 5% and 10 ± 1% for MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II, respectively) pointing out that the tta states are the preferential excitation path towards higher emission quantum yield. The observed decrease in the quantum yield after the complex incorporation into a hybrid matrix has already been reported in the literature for several other materials,30 indicating the appearance of nonradiative channels that were not present in the isolated complex.82 Despite the quantum yield decrease with respect to that of the isolated complex, we should note that these values are among the highest ones observed for organic–inorganic hybrids modified by Ln3+ ions (Table 3 of L. D. Carlos et al.30 and ref. 53).
The emission photostability under continuous UV illumination was studied for complex II and the hybrid materials processed as monoliths and thin films (Fig. 7). For complex II a decrease of the emission intensity to ∼30% is observed (compared with the non-irradiated sample) in the first 2 h, Fig. 7. Such an emission intensity decrease, termed as photobleaching, is a well-known phenomenon observed both for organic materials87,88 and semiconductor quantum dots,89 the mechanism of which is not yet detailed in the literature. After the incorporation into the hybrid host, an enhancement in the photostability of both MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II is observed (Fig. 7). In particular, the emission intensity decreases only to 15% with respect to its initial value for MtU5Eu-II. The contribution of the hybrid host in the UV-photostability has already been demonstrated for analogous Eu3+-doped hybrid materials, such as poly(ε-caprolactone)siloxane biohybrids82 and di-ureasils.31 Moreover, data in Fig. 7 clearly show that the material processing influences the UV-photostabilization, reinforcing that distinct preparation methodologies (monoliths and thin films) induce structural/morphological alterations that lead to changes in the optical features, as already suggested by the different excitation spectra and emission quantum yield values measured for MtU5Eu-II and FtU5Eu-II.

To evaluate the possibility of FtU5Eu-II derived thin films to be used as LSCs, the optical conversion efficiency (ηopt), defined by eqn (2), was evaluated:54,90,91 ηopt = (1 − R)ηabsηfηsηtηtrηself(2)where R is the film reflectance, ηabs is the ratio of photons absorbed by the film to the number of photons falling on it, ηf is the emission quantum yield, ηs is the Stokes efficiency (ratio of the average energy of emitted photons to the average energy of those absorbed), ηt is the trapping efficiency, ηt = (1 − 1/n2)½, where n is the refractive index of the light-emitting medium, ηtr is the transport efficiency which takes into account the transport losses due to matrix absorption and scattering, and ηself is the self-absorption efficiency arising from self-absorption of the emitters.53 In order to estimate ηopt, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of FtU5Eu-II was acquired (Fig. S22 in the ESI†). The value of ηopt was estimated under excitation at 360 and 380 nm yielding values of ∼9 and ∼5%, respectively. These values are higher or similar to the best values reported for other Ln3+-based LSCs, such as Eu3+- and Tb3+-doped urea-bipyridine bridged organosilanes (1.7% (ref. 52) and 4.3% (ref. 53)) and Tb3+-based poly(vinylalcohol) incorporating salicylic acid (8.8%).54Fig. 8 shows the spectral distribution of the sunlight at Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G), in which the shadowed area (curve a) highlights the sunlight intensity (∼149 W m−2) available for down-shifting conversion of the radiation within 300–550 nm to longer wavelengths that can be used to improve the photovoltaic cell efficiency.92 The integral overlap (, where Ir is the spectral irradiance of AM 1.5G and Ix is the excitation spectrum of FtU5Eu-II in normalized units) is ∼25 W m−2, meaning that FtU5Eu-II has the potential to absorb 17% of the sunlight intensity available for down-shifting conversion. Considering the fact that the maximum intensity fraction effectively utilized by the Si-photovoltaic cells is 468 W m−2,92 and to the maximum value of the ηopt (∼9%), a LSC based on FtU5Eu-II will be able to enhance the Si-photovoltaic cell output up to 0.5%.

Conclusions
Essential to the rational design of efficient emitting Ln3+ complexes is the engineering of an appropriate strategy to predict how their photophysical properties can benefit from the synergy between the excited-states of both anionic and neutral first-sphere ligands. Therefore, following a computational-experimental approach, a highly luminescent Eu(tta)3ephen complex was theoretically studied by DFT/TD-DFT calculations, successfully synthesized and fully characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry, TGA analysis, vibrational, UV-Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The complex incorporation within the tri-ureasil organic–inorganic framework was performed and the structural and optical properties of highly luminescent transparent monoliths and thin films are also presented and discussed. A combination of UV-Vis (supported by TD-DFT calculations) and photoluminescence techniques demonstrate the integrity of the first-sphere ligands in the hybrid material suggesting that the structural changes are expected to occur outside the coordination polyhedron after the hybrid's incorporation.
Eu(tta)3ephen displays one of the highest quantum yield values (82 ± 8%) for solid Ln3+ β-diketonate complexes, due to the efficient energy transfer arising from both tta and ephen ligands. The complex incorporation into the t-U(5000) host enabled the processing as transparent monoliths and thin films in a glassy substrate with increased UV-photostability. Despite the decrease in the emission quantum yield, the monolith and thin film quantum yields (63 ± 6% and 48 ± 5%, respectively) are among the highest ones reported so far for organic–inorganic hybrids modified by Ln3+ complexes. The enhanced photostability relatively to the precursor complex and the easy processing as thin films place the tri-ureasil organic–inorganic hybrid doped with Eu(tta)3ephen as LSCs with an optical conversion efficiency of ∼9% and an ability to boost the Si-photovoltaic cell output up to 0.5%. Further improvements of the LSC contribution must involve the design of new materials (in the form of thin films) with higher emission quantum yields and an excitation spectrum shifted towards the red to increase the integral overlap with the sunlight intensity that reaches the Earth.
