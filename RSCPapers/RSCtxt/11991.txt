    , Accepted 26th June 2018First published on 6th July 2018AbstractTransition metal carbodiimides MNCN (M = Co, Ni, Co0.9Ni0.1, Mn and Cu), were studied by simultaneous operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with focus on surface oxide detection during electrocatalytic water oxidation. As a proof of concept, easily modifiable screen-printed electrodes were used in this unified operando synchrotron setup for a trade-off between convenience of electrochemical anodization and spectroscopic data acquisition. Monitoring of chemical and structural transformations at the electrode surface during initial anodic electrode polarization shows stability for MNCN with M = Co, Ni, Co0.9Ni0.1 and Mn. While MnNCN is inactive, CoNCN emerges as the most active representative of the series. CuNCN displays pronounced side reactions and the formation of a surface copper oxide layer leading to lower current density attributed to water oxidation, as evident from an irreversible variation of the CuNCN redox behaviour in rotating ring-disc voltammetry. Furthermore, the accompanying structural and vibrational spectroscopy properties of the different MNCN compounds were explored with complementary ex situ analytical methods.
1. Introduction
The search for sustainable, storable and scalable energy sources is among the most pressing current research issues,1 and the available portfolio of strategies for harvesting renewable energy is constantly developed further.2 Artificial photosynthesis and water splitting by photovoltaics-electrolysis offer direct alternative routes for clean hydrogen fuel production, and its conversion into convenient storage options.3 The efficiency of both approaches is presently determined by the thermodynamically and kinetically challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a proton coupled four-electron multistep transfer process.4 Understanding the precise mechanisms behind the bottleneck5 of energetically uphill charge accumulation around oxygen evolving catalytic centres is the key to their tailored design.6 Knowledge of the detailed structural and chemical properties of catalytic materials is thus indispensable,6 especially of catalyst surfaces and their coordination–interaction with water molecules throughout the catalytic cycle.7
In the ongoing search for highly efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts (WOCs), earth-abundant materials have emerged as affordable and versatile targets for scalable heterogeneous applications,8 including oxides/hydroxides,9 perovskites,10 phosphates/phosphines11,12 and polyoxometalates.13 Among these materials types, cobalt based catalysts exhibit remarkable activity,14 but their efficiency-to-stability performance strongly depends on the electrode surface properties under turnover conditions, where oxidation,15 intercalation,16 electrodeposition,17 amorphization,18,19 dissolution20 and leaching21 phenomena can occur.22 Understanding those surface transformations is a challenging task that requires pioneering spectroscopic techniques and operando monitoring. The latter techniques offer direct insight into the processes of electrode activation or passivation.23 Raman24 and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)12,19,25 provide detailed information about catalytically active sites and their chemical environment even for monolayer-range26 surface transformations.
Metal carbodiimides MNCN (M = Co and Ni) were recently introduced as promising water oxidation catalysts.27 They provide fundamental electronic and structural relations to prominent oxide catalysts, such as octahedral units as present in CoOx, while their oxygen-free compositions permit a clear distinction of the catalytic centres from the MNCN matrix.28 Therefore the all-nitrogen {MN6} coordination of the active transition metal centres in MNCN-based WOCs (Fig. 1) is in principle a unique platform to study three key aspects of the water oxidation process: (1) the photoelectrochemical potential of different catalytic centres in the absence of an oxide lattice environment, (2) the water oxidation mechanism with special emphasis on the H2O and OH− coordination to isolated metal centres in a stable non-oxide matrix, and (3) the surface confined catalyst–oxygen interaction without background signals from bulk oxides. This knowledge is essential for informed WOC construction through linking key concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.6

X-ray path for transmission. 
Moreover, the MNCN series excels through substitutional versatility on the M site for further improvement of the photocatalytic performance.27 However, complete loss of X-ray diffraction signals during Na+-ion intercalation reactions was recently revealed for CuNCN electrodes.29 This raises the question whether related processes can affect the performance of the MNCN series at the lower potentials used for aqueous electrocatalysis.
We here apply simultaneous operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy to monitor surface-structure transformations on easily modifiable screen-printed electrodes of metal carbodiimides MNCN (M = Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni, Mn and Cu) during electrocatalytic water oxidation. This integrated synchrotron setup offers a trade-off between fast and flexible electrochemical anodization and operando data acquisition. This strategy is essential to check the MNCN series for reversible operation of their active metal centres and for the formation of any active surface-oxide layers. In the following, we demonstrate successful monitoring of structural transformations at MNCN electrode surfaces during initial anodic electrode polarization together with an assessment of catalytic stability. These results are complemented further with experimental ex situ spectroscopy and analysis of state-of-the-art vibrational phonon calculations.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthetic methods
The carbodiimide series MNCN (M = Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni, Mn, Cu) was synthesized from metal chlorides in dihydrogencyanamide with ammonium carbonate following reported protocols.27,30,31 CuNCN and MnNCN were obtained directly through dissolution of the respective metal chloride in molten H2NCN at 75 °C and precipitation by addition of (NH4)2CO3. Following the same procedure, Co and Ni first afforded M(HNCN)2 precursors, which were subsequently decomposed thermally in a LiCl/KCl eutectic mixture and N2 atmosphere at 400 °C to yield CoNCN and NiNCN (see ESI, section 1† for details). Reference materials, such as Co3O4 and CuO, were obtained commercially in analytical grade purity.
2.2 Structural characterization
Structural phase characterization was carried out with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a STOE STADI P diffractometer operated in transmission mode with a Ge monochromator and Mo-Kα1 radiation.
2.3 
          Ex situ vibrational spectroscopy

Ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed employing a Bruker-Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with an ATR diamond crystal. Ex situ Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw Ramascope (Ar+ laser, 514 nm) or an InVia Qontor (532, 633, 785 nm) for pristine powder samples on quartz glass slides. All Raman spectra exhibited basically identical vibrational modes, independent of the applied excitation wavelength (see ESI, section 4.1† for details).
2.4 Electrode modification
The screen-printed electrode (SPE) glassy carbon working area was conveniently modified by dropcasting catalyst-Nafion ink with micropipettes. The ink was prepared by sonicating a suspension of 5.0 ± 0.2 mg MNCN (mortar ground) and 42.2 μL Nafion (5% wt sol.) in 320 μL EtOH for 10 min. The final ink contained 5.4 mg mL−1 Nafion and 13.8 mg mL−1 catalyst. An electrode loading series with 1 μL, 5 μL and 10 μL ink was prepared resulting in partial, full and excess coverage of the SPE working electrode area. Nafion is commonly used as a binder for WOCs and considered oxidatively inert,32 so that chemical stability is warranted for the moderate current densities (<10 mA cm−2) and overpotentials (<700 mV) applied in the present study. A chronoamperometric analysis reproducing the potential steps as applied during operando conditions is shown in the ESI, section 2.2.†
2.5 RRDE voltammetry
RRDE experiments were performed by scanning the working disc electrode potential from −0.3 to 1.2 V at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm and constant ring electrode potential of −0.8 V, which is in the mass transfer limited region of oxygen reduction on platinum (see ESI, section 3† for details).
2.6 Electrochemical procedures
Electrochemical standard characterization measurements were performed in a three-electrode setup connected to a Metrohm Autolab N203 potentiostat using a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode (RE) and a glassy carbon rod counter electrode (CE). Working electrodes (WE) were either a glassy carbon disc (r = 1 mm), carbon disc/platinum ring RRDE or a Dropsens (DRP-110) SPE (see ESI, section 2 and 3† for details). The electrolyte was 0.1 M KOH (Aldrich 99.99%) in ultrapure water (R > 18 MΩ). No compensation for electrolyte resistance (500 Ω by EIS high frequency limit) was applied. Under alkaline conditions no degradation was detected for the MNCN compounds. ICP-MS analyses of the supernatant showed a metal content after 20 h of catalyst aging in 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH solution corresponding to 0.02% of the initial mass. We thus consider leaching from catalysts negligible, given that samples were immobilized in Nafion layers during an approx. 10-times shorter reaction timescale for the operando experiments (see ESI, section 4.3† for details).
2.7 
          Operando monitoring setup

Operando Raman and XAS experiments were carried out at the ESRF BM01 Swiss Norwegian Beamline. An electrode connector was placed in front of the beam path to hold the SPE surface tilted by 15°–20° towards the X-ray beam (Fig. 1). The position of the Vortex fluorescence detector was above the SPE (normal to the X-ray beam, 70°–75° to the SPE). Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw system equipped with a 785 nm laser that was focused on the SPE surface using an IR camera. The penetration depth for X-rays around the metal K-edge for XAS extends to 60–100 μm. For Raman spectroscopy measurements, the penetration depth using an excitation wavelength of 785 nm extends to 4.6–5.8 ± 0.5 μm. Thin oxide layer formation is expected to occur largely at the surface, so that the lower penetration depth of Raman spectroscopy is in principle sufficiently surface sensitive to detect the formation of such oxide layers.
2.8 
          Operando spectroscopy at constant potential amperometry
For operando spectroscopy at constant potential, the SPE was dropwise covered with KOH electrolyte and chronoamperometry experiments were conducted by a stepwise increase of the anodic potential in the range 0.0–1.2 V. During each 0.1 V step of 10 min five XAS spectra were measured and Raman spectra were continuously accumulated. The Raman shift range during the operando experiments was limited to 100–1000 cm−1 to allow multiple spectra accumulations.
2.9 
          Ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Pristine catalyst powder and reference compounds were mixed with cellulose to prepare pellets for ex situ XAS measurements in transmission mode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          Ex situ characterization
Evaluation of the PXRD patterns (Fig. 2) shows that the synthetized MNCN products agree with the crystallographic phases of the reference patterns: CoNCN [P63/mmc, ICDD 04-015-1039], NiNCN [P63/mmc, ICDD 04-015-1038], MnNCN [R3m, ICDD 04-011-7543], and CuNCN [Cmcm, ICDD 04-012-5725]. No additional crystalline phases were found.
 Fig. 2  PXRD patterns of the carbodiimide series MNCN (M = Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni, Mn, Cu). 

Ex situ FT-IR spectra of MNCN (M = Mn, Co, Ni; Fig. 3) show the asymmetric stretching mode νs of the NCN matrix at 2052–2083 cm−1 and the doubly degenerated deformation mode δ at 647–658 cm−1. The FT-IR spectrum of CuNCN shows additional and further shifted signals due to deviations from linear geometry of NCN, which lowers the symmetry and allows additional vibrations. The symmetric stretching and deformation modes of the NCN moiety were reported to occur around 2000 cm−1 and 666 cm−1, respectively.9 Generally, overlapping peaks of side products occur in the 1100–1700 cm−1 range which can be attributed to cyanamide polymerization for MnNCN and CuNCN and melamine polycondensation for CoNCN and NiNCN. The very weak signals above 3000 cm−1 can either result from the same side products or from combinational NCN modes (νs + νas = 3203–3211 cm−1). Further discussions on the purity of the MNCN series are provided in the ESI (section 4†). Most importantly, the main product peaks match with the expected values and no oxide peaks were detected.
 Fig. 3  
Ex situ FT-IR spectra of the pristine carbodiimides MNCN (M = Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni, Mn, Cu). 

Ex situ Raman spectra (Fig. 4) agree well with the reported data for CoNCN,27 showing the allowed symmetric NCN stretching mode νs around 1370 cm−1. The peak at 1265 cm−1 may be assigned to the redshifted overtone of the bending mode (2δIR = 2 × 648 cm−1 = 1296 cm−1), which may occur with increased intensity as a result of mixing of vibrational states (Fermi resonance).10 The signal of the NCN-bending occurs at higher wavenumbers compared to FT-IR (δRaman = 650–700 cm−1). Other characteristic Raman peaks of the MNCN series are located in the lattice vibration region (below 500 cm−1) at 400 cm−1 and 220 cm−1. Two broad graphitic peaks at 1300 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 are indicative for g-C3N4 in the pristine samples and overlap with the substrate carbon peaks at the same positions in post-catalytic SPE samples. The asymmetric stretching mode νas appears at around 2000–2100 cm−1.
 Fig. 4  Pre- and post-catalytic Raman spectra of MNCN (pre: pristine material, post: post operando SPE, a CuO spectrum is provided as reference for CuNCN). 
The post catalytic spectrum of CuNCN shows CuO peaks and the disappearance of the peak at 400 cm−1. For the other MNCN samples only additional overlapping carbon background is present around 1500 cm−1 after the catalytic process.
To verify the peak assignments and to emphasize the distinction between Co–O or Co–NCN vibrational modes, we have implemented phonon calculations (see ESI, section 4.4† for details). The calculated IR and power spectra show that all vibrational peaks in the range of 300–900 cm−1 correspond to vibrational modes arising from the CoNCN matrix. In contrast, the peaks at 300, 345 and 620 cm−1 observed in the Raman spectra of post-catalytic CuNCN do not appear in previously calculated phonon spectra of CuNCN,33 so that they indeed most likely correspond to CuO oxide peaks (see Fig. 4). Further comparisons of the ex situ Raman spectra of pristine, pre- and post-catalytic CuNCN and CoNCN SPEs with those of reference oxides (see ESI Fig. S4†), shows that only the CuNCN post-catalytic spectrum matches the expected CuO peaks.
Reproduction of the chronoamperometric experiment with 18O labelled water, followed by immediate analysis of the sample, confirmed the transformation of CuNCN through clearly observable oxygen-related modes (see ESI Fig. S9a†). No such peak shifts were observed for Raman analyses of CoNCN, Co0.9Ni0.1NCN and NiNCN after electrocatalysis in 18O labelled water, which further confirms the absence of oxides in these catalysts (see ESI Fig. S9b–d†).
The voltammetric response of SPE working electrodes (Fig. 5) was characterized with a conventional electrochemical cell setup using a GC-rod CE and Ag/AgCl RE. CoNCN and Co0.9Ni0.1NCN are slightly more active than Co3O4 with the significant difference that they show much less pronounced prewaves that also contribute to the current density. NiNCN displays an intermediate performance, while CuNCN shows only minor activity after reaching a stable response. Finally, MnNCN coating affords even lower current density than the blank uncoated SPE. Tafel plots obtained from chronoamperometric analysis (see ESI, Fig. S2b†) of coated SPEs are not expected to be as precisely representative as rotating disc electrodes, because the membrane character of the layer, diffusion overpotentials and restricted convection are not accounted for. Qualitatively, however, the results of chronoamperometric potential steps are in line with the voltammetry and further show that up to a current density of 1 mA cm−2 Co- and Ni-carbodiimides have lower Tafel slopes below 100 mV per decade, while reaching a most likely diffusion limited region with a high Tafel slope above 300 mV dec−1 at higher current densities, which is comparable to the blank and to the less active CuNCN and MnNCN samples. Further chronoamperometric tests over extended periods as applied during operando studies confirmed these trends (Fig. S2c†). The feasibility of using the SPE Ag-pseudoreference and CE was tested by slow linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 (inset in Fig. 5). A similar trend emerges, and the current density of CuNCN in this mode is increased by its unequilibrated conditioning current. The Ag-pseudoreference was shifted roughly 0.09 V to lower potential versus the Ag/AgCl reference.

The inset shows LSV results of the catalytically active SPEs with 1 μL catalyst ink loading (overpotential measured at 80 μA cm−2, maximum current density at 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl). 
3.2 
          Operando characterization of the MNCN series

Operando XAS spectra of CuNCN are evaluated in Fig. 6 to directly monitor the processes leading to lower electrocatalytic performance. When anodically increasing the applied potential from 0.0 to 1.2 V, the Cu absorption K-edge in the normalized spectra (Fig. 6b), derived from the edge-half-height step-position and from the edge first derivative maximum, respectively, is shifted about 1.0 eV towards higher energy. However, the magnitude of this shift may be due to a systematic drift and cannot be explicitly interpreted as a change in the oxidation state of Cu. Surface oxide formation is far more clearly revealed by the variation in the post-edge region at about 9008–9026 eV (highlighted region in Fig. 6a). Comparison of the pre- and post-catalytic XAS spectra with a CuO reference indicates that the XAS signal changes significantly above 0.9 V to resemble that of the oxide. A rise of absorption intensity at 9015 eV is observed, which is the most pronounced spectral difference of CuO compared to CuNCN. The white-line shift of about 2 eV (Fig. 6b), which is twice as high as the usually observed fluctuations of 1 eV, can be interpreted as additional evidence for changes in the Cu surface coordination state. A linear combination fit of the XANES region in the range of 8995–9050 eV (Fig. 6b, green symbols) affords clearer results: operando XAS spectra were fitted with a CuO reference spectrum and with the initial electrode state at 0.0 V. Until 0.9 V the fraction of CuO ranges below 20% and may well result from background adjustments. In contrast, the CuO fraction then rises sharply at 1.0 V and reaches up to 80% at 1.2 V, thus significantly indicating CuO formation.

(b) CuNCN operando XANES descriptors (whiteline peak and edge energy) vs. potential; right axes: current and CuO fraction based on linear combination fit results of the XANES regions of CuNCN and CuO. 
The remaining MNCN (M = Mn, Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni) compounds did neither exhibit consistent post edge changes, nor did their absorption edge features change significantly with the applied anodic potential. Only fluctuating absorption edge shifts (<±1 eV) were observed for the CoNCN and NiNCN catalysts, which are within the noise level and the resolution limits of XAS data acquisition (0.5 to 1.0 points per eV, see the spectra in the ESI, section 5†).

Operando Raman spectra for CuNCN do not show the expected oxide peaks at 300 (s), 350 (s) and 630 (w) cm−1 due to low scattering intensity (see the spectra in the ESI, section 6†). However, post-catalytic ex situ measurements show presence of CuO (see Fig. 4).

Operando Raman spectra of CoNCN with significant peak intensity are shown in Fig. 7. During anodization the Raman peak intensity at 220 cm−1 slightly decreases, going hand in hand with higher background towards lower wavenumbers and declining overall scattering intensity. Except for the appearance of a shoulder of the phonon peak at 400 cm−1, the other CoNCN bands remain unchanged within the available resolution.
 Fig. 7  
Operando Raman spectra of CoNCN measured at different applied voltages. No oxide related peaks occur. 
All in all, no peaks indicative of metal oxide formation were detected by operando and ex situ Raman spectroscopy of CoNCN, Co0.9Ni0.1NCN and MnNCN.
In order to further investigate the observed CuO formation and to separate the oxygen evolution current of CuNCN from other accompanying redox processes, rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) experiments were performed.
Cyclic voltammetry of CuNCN modified RRDEs clearly confirms that the overall current density response of initial anodic polarization encompasses current contributions from side reactions (Fig. 8b). The corrected oxygen reduction current at the ring is substantially lower than the disc current. The ring current of the cathodic scan is higher compared to the anodic scan, indicating an increase of oxygen arriving at the ring. This can be caused either by an increasing fraction of oxygen generating current at the disc during the reverse scan or by a delayed desorption of the formed oxygen from the disc catalyst layer. The magnitude of this irreversible conditioning current contribution is considerable and can easily be mistaken for the onset of oxygen evolution, which is in fact detected at the ring only above ca. 0.7 V. In contrast, the corrected ring current of CoNCN coincides with the disc current almost perfectly and remains stable during the following cycles, indicating only small contributions of side reactions or non-faradaic currents. During consecutive cycles of CuNCN the current density between 0.4 and 0.8 V is significantly lower and decreases until a steady state is reached after about 3 cycles (Fig. 8b). Subtraction of the corrected ring current from the disc current reveals a difference voltammogram that resembles a pseudo reversible redox wave (anodic peak at 0.8 V) and is attributed to the oxidative transformations of surface CuNCN. At steady state the remaining disc/ring current difference is below 2 mA cm−2 and reversible for both CoNCN and CuNCN. This current difference may be attributed to surface polarization, adsorption and desorption or capacitive effects.
 Fig. 8  RRDE results for (a) CuNCN, (b) CoNCN: insets show a magnified view of low current density. Dashed curves represent the second and third scan cycle for CuNCN. Difference plots were gained by subtraction of the collection efficiency corrected ring current from the disc current. 
Furthermore, the lower catalytic water oxidation activity of CuNCN compared to CoNCN is reflected in the respective current densities of 10 mA cm−2vs. 60 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V.
4. Conclusions

Operando Raman and XAS spectroscopy were applied to monitor the surface transformations of metal carbodiimides MNCN (M = Co, Ni, Co0.9Ni0.1, Mn and Cu) on screen-printed electrodes (SPE) during electrocatalytic water oxidation. Chemical and structural transformations of these electrodes under the anodically applied potential could be detected with the current setup through observed differences in the XAS characteristics, as shown by the operando CuO formation on CuNCN modified SPEs. Absence of oxide formation for the CoNCN and NiNCN electrocatalysts as well as for MnNCN indicates their higher stability under catalytic conditions.
The successful detection and identification of surface transformations of catalyst loadings well below 1 mg on SPE using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a proof of concept for new trade-offs between convenient and flexible sample preparation and detailed analytical insight. The obtained results are sensitive to various sample types and properties, as evident from a series of Raman spectra acquisitions that afforded satisfactory intensity only for the sufficiently well scattering samples. Further optimization strategies are required in such cases to specifically match the different analytical requirements associated with XAS and Raman, respectively, for low quantities of different catalyst types.
The present study paves the way to obtain fundamental insight into concerted changes of the surface structural properties and oxidation states of electrocatalysts in a tuneable and easily accessible electrode setup. Collecting comprehensive information about surface and structural modifications among entire catalyst series as a function of the applied potential is indispensable to systematically elucidate their common mechanistic descriptors for heterogeneous catalysis. In the long term, this strategy will allow to directly address open questions about the basic design requests for optimal metal nuclearities and coordination environments in cost-effective, robust and efficient WOCs systems.

 	Fig. 1  Left: Representative crystal structure of CoNCN showing the octahedral edge sharing {CoN6} coordination sheets of MNCN. Right: Operando XAS and Raman setup at the ESRF BM01 Swiss Norwegian Beamline: 1. XAS fluorescence detector; 2. Raman detector; 3. X-ray source; 4. Raman source; 5. SPE connector; 6. X-ray path for transmission.	 

 	Fig. 2  PXRD patterns of the carbodiimide series MNCN (M = Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni, Mn, Cu).	 

 	Fig. 3  
Ex situ FT-IR spectra of the pristine carbodiimides MNCN (M = Co, Co0.9Ni0.1, Ni, Mn, Cu).	 

 	Fig. 4  Pre- and post-catalytic Raman spectra of MNCN (pre: pristine material, post: post operando SPE, a CuO spectrum is provided as reference for CuNCN).	 

 	Fig. 5  CV of SPEs with 2 μL catalyst ink loading measured in an electrochemical cell setup using GC-rod CE and Ag/AgCl RE (0.1 M KOH, scan rate: 10 mV s−1). The inset shows LSV results of the catalytically active SPEs with 1 μL catalyst ink loading (overpotential measured at 80 μA cm−2, maximum current density at 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) XANES (operando, fluorescence mode) of CuNCN and pre-/post catalytic spectra as reference. (b) CuNCN operando XANES descriptors (whiteline peak and edge energy) vs. potential; right axes: current and CuO fraction based on linear combination fit results of the XANES regions of CuNCN and CuO.	 

 	Fig. 7  
Operando Raman spectra of CoNCN measured at different applied voltages. No oxide related peaks occur.	 

 	Fig. 8  RRDE results for (a) CuNCN, (b) CoNCN: insets show a magnified view of low current density. Dashed curves represent the second and third scan cycle for CuNCN. Difference plots were gained by subtraction of the collection efficiency corrected ring current from the disc current.
