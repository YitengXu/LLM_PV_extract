    , Accepted 14th October 2020First published on 15th October 2020AbstractStructure–property relationships of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type molecular dyad (pp-AD) and triads (pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA) based on benzodithiophene and BODIPY with biphenyl spacers have been reported. Rotors pp-AD and pp-ADA showed efficient twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) with near infrared (NIR) emissions at ∼712 nm and ∼725 nm with (pseudo-)Stokes shifts of ∼208 nm and ∼221 nm, respectively, and prominent solvatochromism. A structurally similar triad, Me-pp-ADA, with tetramethyl substituents on the BODIPY core instead was TICT inactive and exhibited excitation energy transfer with a transfer efficiency of ∼88% as revealed using steady state emission and transient absorption measurements. Rotors pp-AD and pp-ADA showed NIR emission with an enhancement in intensity with the addition of water in THF solution as well as a pronounced change in emission intensity with temperature and viscosity variations, which justify their utility as temperature and viscosity sensors. Furthermore, the linear correlation of lifetime with fluorescence intensity ratios of the donor and acceptor justifies the rigidochromic behaviour of these rotors.
Introduction
The development of organic luminescent rotor molecules has been a rapidly emerging research area in recent years due to their versatile luminescence properties and extensive applications in the field of (bio)sensors, bio-imaging, theranostics and many more.1,2 In this context, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene3 (BODIPY) dyes are an interesting class of chromophores due to their efficient and tuneable absorption in the visible region, high fluorescence quantum yield and remarkable thermal and photochemical stability.4–6 Usually, BODIPY dyes exhibit a small Stokes shift and emission in the green region owing to their straightforward excited state relaxation.4,5 However, structural variations such as the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) design with rotatable junctions lead to a modification of the excited state where an adiabatic relaxation mechanism such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) causes dual emission originating from local excited (LE) state and TICT state.7,9 TICT emissions are red-shifted, resulting in a large (pseudo-)Stokes shift,10–12 and thus are advantageous for bio-imaging13 due to deeper tissue penetration and non-interference from tissue autofluorescence.14,15 TICT rotors are sensitive to multiple external stimuli (i.e., environmental parameters) such as solvent polarity, temperature and viscosity and can, therefore, serve as powerful optical probes for sensing temperature and viscosity in biological or materials science relevant microenvironments.8,16,17 TICT rotors are mechanosensitive probes and the surrounding viscosity affects the fluorescence lifetime, thereby leading to rigidochromism with a ratiometric response.18 Such rigidochromic rotors allow non-invasive mechanical imaging of (bio)materials.18 Although a large class of TICT molecular rotors of the D–π–A type have been reported, examples of rotors with red19,20 or near infrared (NIR) emission21,22 with a large Stokes shift (>200 nm) are extremely rare. Di-alkynyl spacer linked porphyrin dimers (red em. ∼780 nm) are one such example used for viscosity sensing by ratiometric and lifetime-based methods.23 Maillard and co-workers reported glycoconjugated porphyrin dimers (red em. ∼740–800 nm) for ratiometric temperature sensing.24 Cao and co-workers reported a TICT based dye (N,N-dimethyl-4-((2-methylquinolin-6-yl)ethynyl)aniline) with a positive temperature coefficient and a mega Stokes shift of ∼210 nm (although em. was at 550 nm).25 Tang and co-workers reported a TICT dyad of triphenylamine and benzylidene imidazolone (TPA-BI) with a Stokes shift of ∼202 nm and aggregation induced emission (AIE) suitable for efficient two-photon imaging.12 Generally, TICT rotors also exhibit the AIE phenomenon where these molecules (AIE-gens) are weakly emissive in a “favourable” solvent (e.g. tetrahydrofuran) due to rapid non-radiative deactivation of the excited state via intramolecular rotations. However, they form (nano)aggregates in an anti-solvent such as water leading to restricted intramolecular rotation and enhanced luminescence.26–28 AIE-gens have been used in chemosensing, light emitting, in vitro and in vivo imaging, image-guided therapy and theranostic applications.29,30 However, AIE-gens that emit at wavelengths longer than 700 nm are rare but advantageous for bio-imaging and sensing due to effective tissue penetration and the predominant solvent being water that is well-suited for the cellular uptake of these rotor molecules.30 Recently, we reported regioisomeric rotor dyads and triads, in which BODIPY (A) and benzodithiophene (BDT) (D) were connected by either para-phenylene (p-AD, p-ADA) or meta-phenylene (m-AD, m-ADA) spacers.31 While the para-regioisomers showed efficient TICT with a maximum Stokes shift of ∼194 nm (red em. up to 700 nm) for p-ADA,32meta-regioisomers instead showed pronounced aggregation properties. In this work, we have investigated the effect of spacer length as well as tetramethyl groups on the photophysical properties of TICT rotors. The biphenyl spacer has been introduced with BODIPY and BDT as A and D, respectively (pp-AD, pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA shown in Fig. 1), which can increase the dipole length, lead to a modified excited state and might lead to a larger Stokes shift compared to the earlier reported rotors.31 Accordingly, an unprecedented (pseudo-)Stokes shift of ∼221 nm for a BODIPY triad pp-ADA with NIR emission was achieved. Moreover, pp-AD and pp-ADA also exhibit efficient AIE with NIR response and prominent rigidochromic behaviour. On the other hand, tetramethyl substituents (at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-positions) have been incorporated into the BODIPY core in Me-pp-ADA which shows significantly altered photophysical features compared to the other two rotors. Due to the presence of the tetramethyl substituents, the intramolecular meso-phenyl rotation was significantly impeded and thus Me-pp-ADA acted as a TICT inactive non-rotor. However, it exhibited excitation energy transfer (EET) from BDT to BODIPY with a transfer efficiency of ∼88%, thus serving as a promising energy transfer cassette.

Experimental section
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, SD Fine Chemicals) and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over sodium/benzophenone and distilled prior to use. Dichloromethane (DCM) was dried over calcium hydride and distilled prior to use. Silica gel of mesh size 60–120 was used for column chromatography. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 MHz Bruker BioSpin Avance III FT-NMR spectrometer with TMS as the standard at room temperature. The solvent used was CDCl3 (Merck, Germany) and all the spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with TMS as the internal standard. Mass spectrometry measurements were performed using an ultrafleXtreme MALDI TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics) instrument. The software used for analysing the mass spectra were Flex Control, Bruker (USA) and Flex Analysis 3.1. All spectroscopic measurements were performed at room temperature unless otherwise mentioned. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm path length. Fluorescence solution measurements were performed using a Shimadzu RF-6000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at various excitation wavelengths. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI-610E electrochemical workstation from CH Instruments (USA), with a conventional three electrode single-compartment cell consisting of a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl containing 3 M KCl solution as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode, at a scan-rate of 0.1 V s−1. As a supporting electrolyte, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) (Alfa Aesar) dissolved in pre-dried DCM was used. The solutions were purged with nitrogen for 2 min prior to measurement. The concentration of the prepared samples was in the range of ∼0.1–0.3 mM. The electrochemical potential was internally calibrated against the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. Temperature dependent fluorescence of the samples was measured using a Fluoromax-4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, NJ, USA) spectrophotometer and a Wavelength Electronics LFI-3751 was used for temperature control. Temperature dependent UV/Vis measurements were performed using a Cary 60 spectrophotometer equipped with a dual cell Peltier temperature controller with operating temperatures in the range of 0 °C to 100 °C. CIE chromaticity plots were obtained using the chromaticity diagram tool of the Origin Pro software 2019 version. Time resolved fluorescence spectra were measured using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) instrument from FluoroCube (Horiba Jobin Yvon, NJ) equipped with picosecond laser diodes as the excitation source. A 375 nm laser diode was used as the light source for the excitation of samples and the instrument response function (IRF) was collected using LUDOX (colloidal silica) solution. The width (FWHM) of the IRF was ∼250 ps. The optical pulse durations from <70 ps were used. Highly integrated picosecond PMT modules as well as micro channel plate PMTs were used for the time resolution. Transient absorption (TA) spectra were measured using a pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy system. The pump light was generated using a Yb:KGW laser (1028 nm) operating at 5 kHz with a pulse duration of 180 fs (PHAROS-SP-06-200, Light Conversion). Subsequently, the selected excitation wavelength was obtained by using an optical parametric amplifier (ORPHEUS-PO15F5HNP1, light conversion). To generate the probe light, a white light continuum pulse, a small part of the fundamental 1028 nm light was focused on a thin sapphire crystal. TA data were acquired using a spectrometer (HELIOS, Ultrafast Systems). To assure the stability of the pump pulse, the deviation of the pump power before and after each measurement was limited to 10%. All compounds were measured in a quartz cuvette with a 2 mm path length. All spectra were corrected for the chirp of the white probe light and the effect of mutual pump/probe polarization. Quantum chemical calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level were performed on the coupled AD dyad and ADA triads in the ground state using the Gaussian 09 program suite.33 The side chains in all molecules were replaced with a methyl group in order to account for the electron donating effect of the alkyl chain while reducing the computational time and cost. The studied molecules were optimized using the hybrid B3LYP functional with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set in the gas phase. The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels and FMO distribution were obtained from the geometry optimization of neutral ground states. The FMO percentage composition analysis was performed using the GaussSum version 3 software.31 Single point calculations were first performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level and the output file was analysed using GaussSum to obtain the FMO composition analysis of the donor, spacer and acceptor fragments of all molecules pp-AD, pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA.
Synthesis
The synthesis of the dyad pp-AD and triads pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA was performed as detailed in Scheme 1. For the synthesis of pp-AD, pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA, the D precursor was synthesized starting from thiophene-3-carboxylic acid.34,35 For the A precursor, bromo functionalized biphenyl was first synthesized via Suzuki coupling of 4-formylphenylboronic acid and 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene,36 followed by condensation with pyrrole and 2,4-dimethyl pyrrole to obtain BODIPY37,38 acceptors pp-BODIPY and Me-pp-BODIPY, respectively (see the ESI†). Finally, the dyad and triads were synthesized via Stille coupling reaction32 of the corresponding BODIPY and di-stannylated BDT (D2) for pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA and a mixture of mono- and di-stannylated BDT (D1 + D2) for pp-AD (ESI†). All compounds were purified via column chromatography as well as preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) and characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) as described in the ESI.†

Results and discussion
Photophysical and redox properties
Steady state UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra of the dyad pp-AD and triads pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA were measured in chloroform (CHCl3) at c ∼ 10−6 M. Three major absorption peaks were obtained for all the dyad and triads corresponding to the BODIPY S0–S1 transition (∼504 nm), the BDT π–π* transition (∼312–322 nm), and a broad peak around ∼360–390 nm corresponding to the transitions arising due to the electronic interactions of BDT and biphenyl which are conjugated (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1, ESI†). In the case of pp-AD, donor excitation at 391 nm led to a strong emission at 430 nm (originating from D), a very weak emission at 524 nm (originating from A) and a red-shifted peak at 712 nm corresponding to TICT (see the ESI†). Acceptor excitation at 504 nm led to a significant emission band at 524 nm and a broad, red shifted peak at 712 nm with a (pseudo-)Stokes shift of ∼208 nm (Fig. 2b and Fig. S1, ESI†). Similarly, in pp-ADA, upon donor excitation at 391 nm and acceptor excitation at 504 nm, apart from the emission peaks at 430 and 524 nm, a broad TICT peak at 725 nm with a (pseudo-)Stokes shift of ∼221 nm was observed. In polar solvents such as CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), pp-AD and pp-ADA showed dual emission (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†) and the longer wavelength TICT band shifted bathochromically in solvents of increasing polarity (for further details, see the ESI†). However, in the case of Me-pp-ADA, upon donor excitation at 391 nm, emission only from the acceptor at 516 nm was observed and BDT emission was completely quenched (Fig. 2b and Fig. S1, ESI†). This observation is attributed to the EET from BDT to BODIPY that led to almost quantitative quenching of donor fluorescence (vide infra). Additionally, no red-shifted emission band was observed for Me-pp-ADA, which indicates that this compound was TICT inactive. Besides the photophysical properties of rotors in solution, their solid-state absorption and emission are important for impending applications in (opto)electronic devices.39,40 Accordingly, UV/Vis absorption and emission measurements of these rotors were performed in thin films. In thin films of pp-ADA, three absorption peaks (centred at 335 nm, 420 nm and 542 nm) red-shifted compared to those observed in the solution spectra (Fig. 2c and Fig. S4, ESI†). Similarly, in Me-pp-ADA, three major absorption peaks (338 nm, 400 nm and 512 nm) were observed. In the thin film of pp-ADA, upon acceptor excitation at 542 nm, besides the emission at 561 nm, an intense peak at ∼736 nm was observed, while in Me-pp-ADA acceptor excitation at 512 nm led to emission peaks at 531 nm and 555 nm and an intense peak at 640 nm was observed (Fig. 2c and Fig. S4, ESI†). In solid state, pp-ADA showed red emission with a peak at ∼732 nm (Fig. 2d and Fig. S4, ESI†). However, the solid state emission of pp-ADA was not responsive to mechanical grinding as the emission spectrum remained unchanged after grinding. Such red emission in solid state indicates the utility of these materials in (opto)electronic device fabrication such as in excitonic solar cells. In order to assess the redox properties and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed for the dyad, triads and their respective D and A counterparts. The observed HOMO levels were −5.93 eV, −5.87 eV, and −5.72 eV and LUMO levels were −4.04 eV, −4.19 eV, and −3.88 eV for pp-AD, pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA, respectively (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†).

DFT calculations and excitation energy transfer
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (Fig. 3, Table 1 and Tables S2, S3 in the ESI†) to calculate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as torsion angles in geometry optimized structures of all molecules in the ground state. The DFT calculated energy levels and those obtained from the CV measurements are presented in the ESI.† FMO composition analyses were performed for all three molecules and it was observed that the HOMO of pp-ADA was composed of 86% contribution from the BDT donor and nil contribution from the BODIPY acceptor, while LUMO was composed of 85% contribution from the BODIPY acceptor and 2% from the BDT donor. This observation implies a charge transfer (CT) character for a HOMO to LUMO transition (BDT to BODIPY) for pp-ADA. Similar CT behaviour can also be observed for a HOMO to LUMO+1 transition because LUMO+1 was composed of an 88% contribution from the acceptor BODIPY. Similar FMO composition was obtained for pp-AD where the HOMO has a 97% contribution from BDT and LUMO has a 92% contribution from BODIPY indicating the CT character. The FMO composition analysis of Me-pp-ADA showed BDT and BODIPY contributing to 85% and 97% to HOMO and LUMO, respectively, and LUMO+1 has a contribution of 98% from the acceptor. The FMO composition indicates the possibility of CT in Me-pp-ADA; however, the restricted rotation of the meso phenyl substituent of the BODIPY moiety due to the presence of four methyl groups prevents the formation of a TICT state. The detailed FMO composition analysis with contributions of BDT, BODIPY and the phenyl spacer towards the FMOs of the dyad and triads is provided in Table S3 (ESI†). For pp-AD and pp-ADA, the ϕ1, ϕ2 and ϕ3 torsion angles were comparable for both, i.e., 53°, 36° and 23°, and the torsion angles ϕ4, ϕ5 and ϕ6 of pp-ADA were similar to ϕ3, ϕ2 and ϕ1, respectively (Table 1). These results suggest that both pp-AD and pp-ADA are twisted in the ground state. It is well reported that the intramolecular rotation of the meso phenyl substituent of BODIPY is the one responsible for imparting the TICT behaviour to BODIPY dyes.9 Accordingly, torsion along ϕ1 and ϕ6 contributes to the TICT behaviour in pp-AD and pp-ADA. However, the ϕ1 and ϕ6 of Me-pp-ADA were ∼90° due to the presence of methyl substituents at the C1, C7-positions of BODIPY. Such an orthogonal arrangement in Me-pp-ADA is therefore energetically the most stable conformation in the ground state and the intramolecular rotation along the BODIPY-meso phenyl bond is completely restricted due to steric reasons. As a result, Me-pp-ADA was TICT inactive and the D and A units being orthogonal behave as independent chromophores, thereby favouring energy transfer.41 However, in Me-pp-ADA, through-space Förster energy transfer is unlikely since the BDT (energy donor) emission and BODIPY (energy acceptor) absorption have a negligible overlap as shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†). The fluorescence excitation spectrum of Me-pp-ADA recorded at the BODIPY emission edge (514 nm) showed peaks corresponding to the BDT, biphenyl as well as BODIPY absorption, thus indicating efficient EET in this compound (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Fluorescence quantum yields were determined for the dyad and triads using a relative method with Rhodamine B as the reference dye, and quantum yields of 0.034, 0.024 and 0.20 were obtained for pp-AD, pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA, respectively (Table S4, ESI†). For obtaining the energy transfer efficiency (ETE) for Me-pp-ADA, the quantum yields of the BDT donor and BDT in Me-pp-ADA were calculated using anthracene as the spectroscopic reference compound (Table S5, ESI†) in THF solution. A quantum yield of 0.17 was obtained for free BDT while that of 0.021 was obtained for BDT in Me-pp-ADA, thereby revealing excitation energy transfer with an ETE of ∼88% from BDT to BODIPY. To further confirm the EET process, transient absorption (TA) measurements were performed for Me-pp-ADA in THF using a femtosecond pump–probe set-up. The TA spectrum of Me-pp-ADA excited at 500 nm (acceptor excitation) is compared with that of its (commercially available) model acceptor excited at 500 nm (Fig. 4a and b). Upon acceptor excitation, both spectra exhibited a bleach of the ground state absorption immediately, and no excited state absorption (ESA) was observed in the spectral window, while, upon donor excitation at 392 nm, a broad absorption band was obtained in the 600 nm–900 nm region. Hence, the ESA appearing between 600 nm and 900 nm should be assigned to the excited donor (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the ESA of the donor emerges with the ground state bleach of the acceptor, indicating the formation of the excited state of the acceptor. Since the absorption of the model acceptor at 400 nm is negligible, the excited acceptor shown in Fig. 4c should arise from excitation energy transfer. The deactivation dynamics of the excited molecules is further analyzed using single wavelength fitting. In both compounds, the first component (t1), ∼1 ps, can be associated with the ultrafast solvation process.42,43 Subsequently, the decay of the relaxed excited state to the ground state is characterized by the time constant that is comparable to the photoluminescence lifetime that is on a ns timescale.

Temperature and viscosity sensing properties
The emission of molecular rotors is remarkably sensitive to multiple stimuli such as temperature and the viscosity of the solvent2,8 and thus the temperature dependent emission of pp-AD and pp-ADA were investigated. For pp-AD, upon increasing the temperature from 15 °C to 55 °C in CHCl3, a steady increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed and the TICT band shifted hypsochromically from ∼716 nm (15 °C) to ∼697 nm (55 °C) (Fig. 5a). This observation is attributed to the thermal energy assisting the excited electron in crossing the activation barrier from the TICT to the LE state and the latter (LE state) gets preferentially populated, resulting in a hypochromic shift accompanied by an intensity enhancement.44 Similarly, for pp-ADA in the same temperature range and solvent, the TICT band shifted hypsochromically from ∼728 nm to ∼700 nm with a 2-fold intensity enhancement (Fig. 5b and Fig. S9, ESI†). A similar trend was observed in the temperature dependent emission spectra of pp-ADA in THF (Fig. S10, ESI†). However, in non-polar solvents, such as in toluene, only a BODIPY peak was observed and increasing the temperature from 5 °C to 95 °C led to a decrease in BODIPY emission intensity, which is attributed to enhanced molecular motions at higher temperatures leading to non-radiative deactivation (Fig. S11, ESI†). Ratiometric temperature analysis was performed for pp-AD and pp-ADA by plotting the emission intensity ratio of the TICT band at the initial and final temperatures (I1 and I2) vs. the varying temperatures. The plot of the ratio of intensities vs. temperature was fitted with linear functions44,45 to obtain the temperature coefficients and accordingly positive temperature coefficients of 0.19% °C−1 and 0.27% °C−1 were obtained for pp-AD and pp-ADA, respectively, in CHCl3 in the range of 15 °C to 55 °C. In ratiometric temperature sensing plots, linearity is one of the significant features because it showed constant thermal sensitivity in the physiological temperature range. The linear relationship of the TICT intensity ratios vs. temperature (Fig. S9–S12, ESI†) suggested that these rotors could be used as ratiometric temperature sensors very efficiently in a wide temperature range. The absorption spectra of all compounds remained unchanged with temperature variation justifying that these compounds were stable under temperature variations during the spectroscopic experiments (Fig. S13, ESI†). Viscosity dependent emission measurements were performed in methanol (MeOH) and glycerol (gly) mixtures for both the rotors by increasing the percentage of gly from 0% to 90% in MeOH (0.6 cP to 454 cP).19 By increasing the viscosity, molecular rotation is restricted leading to the exclusion of non-radiative deactivation pathways and an enhancement in emission intensity. Accordingly, for pp-AD and pp-ADA, upon increasing the gly content from 0% to 90% in MeOH, the intensity of the LE band and the acceptor band increased 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 5c and d). From the Förster Hoffmann analysis,16,17pp-AD and pp-ADA showed viscosity sensitivities of 0.08 and 0.14, respectively (Fig. S14, ESI†), similar to our earlier rotors p-AD (0.09) and p-ADA (0.14).31 Temperature dependent emission measurements were performed using 50% gly/MeOH solution (viscosity ∼24 cP) to elucidate the effect of temperature on molecular rotations in a viscous medium. For pp-AD and pp-ADA, the emission intensity decreased ∼2-fold upon increasing the temperature from 15 °C to 55 °C (Fig. S15, ESI†), which is indicative of increased molecular motions with decreasing viscosities, thereby facilitating non-radiative deactivation.

Fluorescence lifetime and rigidochromism
In order to understand the dynamics of the TICT processes of the rotors as well as their rigidochromic behaviour (i.e., variation in fluorescence lifetimes at variable viscosity18), fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed for pp-AD and pp-ADA in CHCl3 using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. For pp-AD, the decay corresponding to 712 nm (TICT band) exhibited a longer average lifetime (τavg) of ∼0.69 ns compared to the decay corresponding to 523 nm (acceptor channel) with an average lifetime of 0.09 ns (Fig. S16 and Table S6, ESI†). Similarly, the τavg values of pp-ADA at emission wavelengths of 524 nm (acceptor channel) and 725 nm (TICT emission) were ∼0.03 ns and ∼0.44 ns, respectively. It is well known that the decay in TICT emission channels shows higher lifetimes than that in the donor or acceptor emission channels.31,32 Furthermore, all the decay profiles could be fitted with tri-exponential functions that indicate the presence of multiple conformers or species in solution. Fluorescence lifetimes of pp-AD and pp-ADA were also measured at variable viscosities by increasing the gly content from 0% to 90% (0.6 cP to 454 cP) (Fig. 6a and Fig. S17, ESI†) to confirm the rigidochromic behaviour. Upon increasing the viscosity, a pronounced enhancement in fluorescence lifetimes was observed due to restricted intramolecular rotation, resulting in slower radiative decay and longer lifetimes. Accordingly, upon increasing the viscosity, the τavg value of pp-AD increased from 0.08 ns to 2.02 ns while, for pp-ADA, τavg increased from 0.2 ns to 0.87 ns (Table S7, ESI†). Linear correlations between fluorescence lifetimes and intensity ratios of A and D emission (IA/ID) at variable viscosities (Fig. 5b and Fig. S18, ESI†) were observed for pp-AD and pp-ADA. A linear correlation in such a plot is an essential feature of rigidochromism18 and accordingly rotors pp-AD and pp-ADA are efficient ratiometric rigidochromic probes.

Aggregation induced emission
TICT rotors usually are AIE active where they are weakly emissive or non-emissive in a “good” solvent and become emissive upon the addition of a “poor” solvent due to the formation of aggregates and hence restricted intramolecular rotations. AIE was investigated in the dyad pp-AD and triads pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA in a binary mixture of THF and water. For pp-AD, starting from pure THF, an initial increase in water content (10–50% v/v) led to a decrease in the intensity of the TICT band (719 nm) due to increasing hydrophilicity of the solvent that favours rapid intramolecular rotation leading to non-radiative deactivation.9,12 However, upon further increasing the water content to ∼60–90%, a 6-fold enhancement in the emission intensity of the TICT band was observed with a concomitant bathochromic shift to 727 nm (Fig. 7a). The emission intensity enhancement was attributed to the formation of (nano)aggregates, which restricts the intramolecular rotation, thereby reducing the non-radiative deactivation. Similarly, for pp-ADA, upon increasing the water content up to 50% (v/v), the intensity of the TICT band (723 nm) decreased. However, upon further increasing the water content up to 90%, the TICT band showed a minimal bathochromic shift to 730 nm with a 5–6-fold enhancement of emission intensity (Fig. 7b). The tetramethyl substituted non-rotor Me-pp-ADA, however, did not show any AIE enhancement (Fig. S8, ESI†) unlike the two rotors. UV/Vis absorption spectra of pp-ADA were also measured in a binary mixture of THF and water and, upon increasing the water content, absorbance decreased (without any bathochromic shift of the BODIPY absorption band), accompanied by a tailing effect in the long wavelength region indicative of nano-aggregate formation (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Conclusions
In summary, the D–π–A rotor type dyad pp-AD and triad pp-ADA showed efficient TICT with NIR emissions at 712 and 725 nm and extraordinary large Stokes shifts of ∼208 nm and ∼221, respectively, with prominent AIE with NIR response. A viscosity dependent enhancement of emission and a pronounced increase in fluorescence lifetime were observed for rotors pp-AD and pp-ADA. A linear correlation of lifetime with the intensity ratio justifies the rigidochromic behaviour of these rotors. Compounds pp-AD and pp-ADA showed temperature as well as viscosity sensitivity, with positive temperature coefficients of 0.19% °C−1 and 0.27% °C−1 and viscosity sensitivities of 0.08 and 0.14, respectively. On the other hand, owing to the presence of tetramethyl substituents, Me-pp-ADA was TICT inactive and thus a non-rotor but showed efficient EET from BDT to BODIPY with an efficiency of ∼88%. Furthermore, compounds pp-ADA and Me-pp-ADA showed red-shifted emission in thin films (736 nm and 640 nm, respectively) and pp-ADA showed solid state emission at ∼732 nm and are potentially useful for (opto)electronic applications. These multifunctional TICT rotors with prominent TICT, a large Stokes shift and AIE emission in the NIR region and the responsiveness of their emission to multiple stimuli such as solvent polarity, temperature, and viscosity are thus potentially useful for bioimaging, temperature and viscosity sensing of cellular microenvironments, and micromechanical imaging of (bio)materials. At present, our group is focused on understanding the origin of such spectral features of these rotors as well as in developing newer molecular rotors with improved photophysical features for a multitude of applications.
