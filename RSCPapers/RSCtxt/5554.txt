Performance limitations due to intrinsically poor catalytic activity and slow electron transport have been successfully addressed through the application of water oxidation co-catalysts and novel doping strategies. The next bottleneck to tackle is the modest optical absorption in BiVO4, particularly close to its absorption edge of 2.4 eV. Here, we explore the modification of the BiVO4 surface with Ag@SiO2 core–shell plasmonic nanoparticles. A photocurrent enhancement by a factor of ∼2.5 is found under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5). We show that this enhancement consists of two contributions: optical absorption and catalysis. The optical absorption enhancement is induced by the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances in the Ag nanoparticles, and agrees well with our full-field electromagnetic simulations. Far-field effects (scattering) are found to be dominant, with a smaller contribution from near-field plasmonic enhancement. In addition, a significant catalytic enhancement is observed, which is tentatively attributed to the electrocatalytic activity of the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles.
In the field of solar water splitting, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as one of the most promising photoanode materials. The monoclinic scheelite phase (clinobisvanite) is the most photo-active form of BiVO4.The material shows n-type conductivity and has a bandgap of ∼2.4 eV.1–3 An attractive aspect of BiVO4 is that its band edge positions are more favorably located than other well-known metal oxides for solar water splitting, such as hematite or tungsten trioxide.4–6 BiVO4 photoanodes profit from a good stability in aqueous solutions with pH values between 3 and 11.7 However, the performance of the material is hampered by two main limitations: (i) slow hole transfer across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface (i.e., low catalytic activity for water oxidation) and (ii) slow electron transport, which results in sub-optimal carrier separation. In recent years, these issues have successfully been addressed. The first issue has been largely solved by attaching co-catalysts to the surface of BiVO4. Oxygen evolution catalysts such as RhO2,8 cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi),9–11 cobalt borate (Co-Bi),12 nickel borate (Ni-Bi),13 and iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH)14 have been successfully used. At sufficiently high bias potentials, catalytic activities of up to 100% have been shown,9,11,15 demonstrating that the problem of slow water oxidation catalysis has been solved for BiVO4. The second limitation (slow electron transport) can be solved by introducing a donor-type dopant, such as W and Mo,9,11,15–18 thereby increasing the carrier concentration. Recently, we have shown that this can be further improved by introducing a gradient in the dopant concentration in BiVO4. The gradient dopant profile introduces a small but effective electrical potential gradient in the film, which improves the carrier separation efficiency to values as high as 80%.19 With these modifications an AM1.5 photocurrent of 3.6 mA cm−2 has been achieved at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which firmly establishes BiVO4 as the currently highest performing metal oxide photoanode.19
With the catalysis and charge transport issues solved, modest light absorption—especially for photons with energies close to the bandgap—becomes the next main bottleneck. To illustrate this, if we assume that all the light absorbed in our best-performing W:BiVO4 samples contributes to photocurrent, we would still only have ∼5 mA cm−2.19 For comparison, the maximum theoretical photocurrent for BiVO4 is ∼7.5 mA cm−2 (assuming that all photons with an energy higher than the bandgap are absorbed and collected). This means that a significant increase of the photocurrent (2.5 mA cm−2) can be achieved by improving light absorption. Unfortunately, simply increasing the thickness of the film to absorb more light will not work, since the carrier diffusion length in BiVO4 is ∼100 nm.20,21 Considering that the best-performing BiVO4 already has a thickness of ∼200 nm, other strategies to improve light absorption are therefore needed.
Recently, surface plasmon resonances of metallic nanostructures, such as Au, Ag, and Al, have been extensively used to improve the absorption—and the efficiency—in various photocatalytic systems and solar cells.22–26 The same approach has also been pursued for solar water splitting applications.27–33 For example, Thimsen et al. reported a significant improvement of the optical absorption in hematite when Au plasmonic nanoparticles are introduced on the hematite surface or at the interface between the substrate and hematite film.28 However, this improvement is not accompanied by the same improvement in the overall efficiency; the photocurrent was found to decrease instead. This inconsistency is attributed to the introduction of traps at the interface between the Au and hematite. One way to circumvent this problem is by introducing a thin SiO2 insulating layer on the surface of the Au nanoparticles. Thomann et al. demonstrated that this effectively prevents nanoparticle-induced charge recombination.29
In this paper, we explore the application of core–shell nanoparticles on the surface of 100 nm-thick spray-deposited BiVO4 films as a route to enhance the optical absorption in the films. Similar to the approach of Thomann et al.,29 SiO2 is used as the insulating layer around the core metal. However, here, Ag is used as the core metal because: (i) Ag is less expensive than Au, and (ii) the plasmon frequency of Ag can be tailored between 400 to 600 nm,34,35 providing a better match to the absorption spectrum of BiVO4. We predict and show the beneficial effect of the Ag@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles on the performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. Through a detailed photoelectrochemical analysis, we are able to distinguish between absorption and catalytic effects that contribute to the observed improvements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of core–shell nanoparticles to improve the absorption and efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes.
We first perform full-field electromagnetic simulations to assess the performance enhancements of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles on BiVO4 films. In these simulations, we numerically solve frequency-domain Maxwell equations using a finite element method, following a previously reported approach.29,36 We consider two different types of BiVO4 samples: (i) bare BiVO4 and (ii) BiVO4 decorated with Ag@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles (Ag@SiO2/BiVO4), both are shown in Fig. 1. The diameter of the Ag core is 50 nm, and the thickness of the SiO2 shell is 10 nm, based on TEM analysis of the nanoparticles (see ESI,† Fig. S1). To make our calculations as realistic as possible, we explicitly take into account the surface roughness of the films in relation to the Ag@SiO2 particle size. The surface roughness was measured with atomic force microscopy (see ESI,† Fig. S2).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the (a) bare and (b) Ag@SiO2 decorated BiVO4 (Ag@SiO2/BiVO4) samples. 
The direct results of the electromagnetic calculations are the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields (E, H). Based on these, we calculate the rate of light absorption at every point inside the light absorbing layer, using the following equation: Pd = ½ωε′′(ω)|Ē(,ω)|2(1)
Here, ω is the angular frequency of the incident light, ε′′(ω) is the imaginary part of the permittivity of the material, and |Ē(,ω)| describes the amplitude of the electric field at position r and angular frequency ω. Inside the BiVO4, the power-loss density (Pd) is the rate of electron–hole pair generation at every point (in W m−3), while in the Ag nanoparticles, it describes the absorbed photons that dissipate their energy as phonons.

Fig. 2 shows the distribution of Pd at the cross-section of the different samples under illumination with 465 nm light, given an incident power of 1 W. The photoanode is illuminated from the substrate side (back-side illumination). Non-zero optical absorption takes place only within Ag and BiVO4 since other layers in the structure do not absorb 465 nm light. Note that the absorption profile over the bare BiVO4 (Fig. 2a) is not uniform, despite the planar wave-front of the excitation light. This is caused by the wavelength-scale dimensions of the superficial features of BiVO4, which affect the propagation of light.37 Such wavelength-scale features can have Mie resonances and, if properly engineered, can be used to reduce the reflectance from the layer.37Fig. 2b and c shows a BiVO4 film segment with a single Ag@SiO2 nanoparticle, which corresponds to a 25% surface coverage. Results from the two conditions were averaged to take the random position of Ag@SiO2 into consideration. The absorption in the BiVO4 is enhanced, especially in the area underneath the nanoparticle. Further increase of the surface coverage to up to 50% (Fig. 2d) results in an even stronger absorption enhancement.

The illumination direction is from the bottom (back-side of the samples). Bare BiVO4 is shown in (a). BiVO4 with 25% surface coverage of Ag@SiO2 are shown in (b) and (c), which are averaged to take the position of the nanoparticle into consideration. Finally, BiVO4 with 50% surface coverage of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles is shown in (d). 
The total absorptance in the BiVO4 film is calculated by integrating Pd over the entire volume of BiVO4, according to the following equation: (2)where Pinc is the power of the incident light. Fig. 3a shows the calculated absorption spectra of BiVO4 films with 0%, 25% and 50% surface coverage of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles. A near-field enhancement effect can be identified by the presence of peaks in the absorption spectrum, corresponding to the plasmonic resonance(s) of the nanoparticles.22,29 Our simulation based on a small area in BiVO4 adjacent to the nanoparticle shows that we would expect a sharp peak between 410 and 420 nm (see ESI,† Fig. S3). However, we observe a broadband enhancement in Fig. 3a, i.e., it is not specific to a certain wavelength range. We therefore conclude that effects other than near-field enhancement must also play a role. One possible explanation is the occurrence of light scattering from the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles and/or from the surface features of the BiVO4 layer. Optical scattering, which can be classified as a far-field effect, is indeed known to enhance the absorption under the right conditions.38 Indeed, the scattering cross-section of the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticle used here is much higher than its absorption cross-section (see ESI,† Fig. S4).

Fig. 3b shows the calculated absorption enhancement—integrated over the AM1.5 spectrum—as a function of the surface coverage. A maximum is found between 40–60%. At higher coverage, the optical dissipation in Ag becomes larger than the plasmonic induced optical absorption in BiVO4; hence, smaller absorption enhancement is observed. Based on this, we covered ∼50% of the surface of our 100 nm-thick, spray pyrolysed BiVO4 film with the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles. To obtain this coverage we used ∼2.5 μL cm−2 of the solution of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles. The optical density and the particle size distribution of the solution are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S5. Detailed sample preparation and characterization procedures can be found in the ESI.† Our SEM analysis shows that the coverage is not perfectly uniform (see ESI,† Fig. S6). Nevertheless, the overall coverage is estimated to be 35–45%, which is close to the desired coverage.

Fig. 4a shows the IPCE of the bare BiVO4 and the Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under back-side illumination. Upon decoration with Ag@SiO2, the IPCE of the BiVO4 photoanode is greatly improved at wavelengths larger than 400 nm. This agrees well with our simulations, and is consistent with optical absorption measurements on these same samples (see ESI,† Fig. S7). The same broadband enhancement between 400 and 500 nm is also observed, which confirms that both near- and far-field effects play important roles in the enhancement mechanism.

The increase in IPCE is also reflected in the AM1.5 photocurrent, shown in Fig. 4b. A photocurrent of ∼1.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is achieved for Ag@SiO2/BiVO4. This is a ∼2.5-fold improvement compared to bare BiVO4. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest AM1.5 photocurrent enhancements reported for a photoanode decorated with metal plasmonic nanoparticles.28–33
To ensure that the observed photocurrent is not a result of photocorrosion or oxidation of the sample, we investigated the stability of Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 under illumination. Fig. 5 shows the chronoamperometry measurement of the Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 sample, at 1.23 V vs. RHE under back-side chopped AM1.5 illumination. The stability of the sample is excellent, with no noticeable degradation in 25 minutes. Integration of the photocurrent gives a total charge of 1125 mC cm−2, which is ∼10 times larger than the charge that would be needed to photo-corrode the nanoparticles. This proves that the photocurrent enhancement can indeed be attributed to improved performance of the Ag@SiO2-modified photoelectrode.

The 2.5-fold photocurrent improvement we observed is, however, much higher than the ∼40% enhancement (Fig. 3b) that is predicted by integrating the calculated absorptance over the AM1.5 irradiance.36 To reconcile this, a thorough photo-electrochemical analysis of the modified BiVO4 films was performed. The total enhancement factor (f) that is induced by the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles can be written as: (3)JAg@Sio2/BiVO4 and JBiVO4 are the photocurrents of Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 and bare BiVO4, respectively. We now assume that the enhancement can be caused by the increased absorption in BiVO4 (as a result of plasmonic resonances and scattering) as well as surface catalytic effects. To isolate the absorption enhancement, H2O2 was added to the electrolyte to serve as a very effective hole scavenger. Recent studies have shown that the efficiency of hole injection into the electrolyte is ∼100% in the presence of H2O2.11,39 Under these conditions, it is reasonable to assume that catalysis and surface recombination no longer play a significant role, and that the photocurrent enhancement is entirely due to absorption effects: (4)where JAg@Sio2/BiVO4+H2O2 and JBiVO4+H2O2 are the photocurrents of Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 and bare BiVO4 in the presence of H2O2, respectively. The catalytic enhancement is obtained by dividing the total enhancement by the absorption enhancement: (5)

Fig. 6a shows the IPCE of the bare and Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 in the presence of H2O2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The enhancement occurs in the same spectral region as in Fig. 4a, but it is significantly smaller. From the data in Fig. 4a and 6a, the absorption, catalytic and total enhancements are calculated from eqn (3)–(5) and shown in Fig. 6b. Integration of the absorption enhancement over the AM1.5 spectrum gives an overall enhancement of ∼33%, which closely matches the predicted enhancement from our full-field electromagnetic simulations. A similar enhancement (∼28% at 1.23 V vs. RHE) is observed when we compare the photocurrents of bare BiVO4 and Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 in the presence of H2O2 under actual AM1.5 illumination (see ESI,† Fig. S8).

Fig. 6b clearly shows that the catalytic enhancement is significantly larger than the absorption enhancement. In order to shed light on the cause of this catalytic enhancement, we determined the catalytic and carrier separation efficiencies of the bare BiVO4 and Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 (see ESI,† Fig. S9).11 The carrier separation efficiencies of both samples are found to be identical, which proves that the enhancement cannot be attributed to the formation of a rectifying junction between the Ag@SiO2 and the BiVO4. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency for the Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 sample is ∼85% larger than for the bare BiVO4 sample at 1.23 V vs. RHE. We tentatively attribute this difference to the electrocatalytic activity of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of BiVO4. At low potentials (< 0.9 vs. RHE), the catalytic efficiency of Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 is lower than that of the bare sample. In this case, Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles are inactive as catalyst; they just block part of the BiVO4 surface, which explains the lower catalytic efficiency (ESI,† Fig. S9). This is also evident in Fig. 4b, where the photocurrent of the Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 is lower than that of the bare BiVO4. The situation is, however, reversed at higher potentials where the catalytic efficiency of Ag@SiO2/BiVO4 exceeds that of bare BiVO4. It appears that at these potentials the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles no longer block charge transfer and, instead, catalyze the water oxidation reaction. While there have been no reports of their catalytic activity for water oxidation, redox catalysis using Ag@SiO2 and Ag–SiO2 composites have been reported.40,41 To confirm this, we deposited the Ag@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles on the surface of an FTO substrate. We then compare the dark current of this Ag@SiO2/FTO and a bare FTO substrate as a function of potential (see ESI,† Fig. S10), and observe a ∼200 mV cathodic shift of the onset potential for the Ag@SiO2/FTO. This shows that Ag@SiO2 indeed behaves as a (dark) catalyst for water oxidation.
One surprising and counter-intuitive observation from Fig. 6b is that the catalytic enhancement shows a pronounced dependence on wavelength. Although the exact reason for this is unclear at the moment, we note that the center of the spectral region where catalytic enhancement occurs overlaps exactly with the optical absorbance of the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles (ESI,† Fig. S5a). We therefore speculate that the electric field that propagates from the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles aids the water oxidation reaction, for example by enhancing the carrier separation efficiency near the surface,42 or through plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer (PIRET).43 Further investigation is needed to elucidate this, which is beyond the scope of the current work.
Conclusions
In summary, we have explored the application of Ag@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles on the surface of BiVO4 to improve the absorption in BiVO4. By performing a thorough photoelectrochemical analysis with an efficient hole scavenger, we can distinguish absorption and catalytic contributions to the observed enhancement. The absorption enhancement (∼33%) is mostly due to far-field effects (scattering), with a smaller contribution due to near-field localized surface plasmon resonances. This is markedly different from the mechanism in smaller (<20 nm) metal plasmonic nanoparticles, where near-field effects dominate.43 The experimental results agree well with the full-field electromagnetic simulations. The catalytic enhancement is twice as large as the absorption enhancement, and is tentatively assigned to the improvement of water oxidation kinetics due to the catalytic activity of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles. The effects combine to give a ∼2.5-fold improvement of AM1.5 photocurrent at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is one of the highest photocurrent enhancements reported for a photoanode decorated with capped metal plasmonic nanoparticles. Such a large improvement is crucial for the development of BiVO4 photoanodes, since modest absorption—especially for wavelengths close to the band edge—has been identified as one of the main performance-limiting factors.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the (a) bare and (b) Ag@SiO2 decorated BiVO4 (Ag@SiO2/BiVO4) samples.	 
Pd = ½ωε′′(ω)|Ē(,ω)|2	(1)

 	Fig. 2  Color plots of the amplitude of power-loss density, Pd, in the samples with an incident power of 1 W and wavelength of 465 nm. The illumination direction is from the bottom (back-side of the samples). Bare BiVO4 is shown in (a). BiVO4 with 25% surface coverage of Ag@SiO2 are shown in (b) and (c), which are averaged to take the position of the nanoparticle into consideration. Finally, BiVO4 with 50% surface coverage of Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles is shown in (d).
