    , Accepted 23rd July 2014First published on 25th July 2014AbstractA two-step, spin-coating process to synthesize a high quality perovskite film at room temperature at ambient atmosphere is reported. Combining an optimized PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer and a PC71BM acceptor, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.31% with a remarkably high Voc of 1.05 V and FF of 0.78. The efficiency reproducibility of the devices is also high: 80% of devices achieve efficiency higher than 15%.
Perovskite, named after Russian mineralogist Lev Perovski, is a type of mineral that was discovered two centuries ago. It was known as a group of material with interesting magnetic and electrical properties. In 2009, Miyasaka et al.1 discovered the photovoltaic performance of organic-perovskites (such as methylammonium lead halide, CH3NH3PbI3) when they used very small CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles to sensitize a mesoporous TiO2 anode. Combined with a liquid electrolyte, the resulting device has a PCE of 3–4%. Four years later (2013), based on a similar cell architecture with a solid electrolyte, Grätzel et al.2 and Snaith et al.3 achieved the remarkable efficiency of above 15%. In addition to the phenomenal photovoltaic efficiency, perovskite materials also have the advantages of low cost, high absorption coefficient, excellent carrier transport, tunable composition and structure as well as the ability to be fabricated by various processing methods.4,5 Several reports also suggest that solar cells with efficiencies of up to 20% are realistically achievable.6,7 The solution-processable perovskite photovoltaic devices should be able to compete with conventional thin-film solar cells both in terms of cost and efficiency. Therefore, after Grätzel's report,2 research on organic-perovskite based solar cell has increased.
Organic–inorganic perovskites were first implemented in mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1 However, mesoscopic DSC fabrication requires a processing temperature of up to 500 °C to sinter the TiO2 support, which renders them incompatible with flexible substrates. Later studies8–14 also found that perovskite film can also be applied to planar heterojunction solar cells, which are adaptable to low temperature solution processes. Several film deposition methods were used to fabricate perovskite films in planar heterojunction solar cells such as co-evaporation of two precursors3 (PbCl2 and CH3NH3I (MAI)), one-step solution process14 (mixing lead halide and CH3NH3I in a solvent before deposition), vapor-assisted solution process,15 or two-step dipping process.2
The application of perovskites in organic (small molecule or polymer) solar cells (which professor Snaith named as an “inverted cell architecture”) started in 2013. Jeng et al.16 used perovskite as a donor and PC61BM as an acceptor to construct a perovskite/fullerene planar heterojunction hybrid solar cell with the efficiency of 3.9%. The low photovoltaic performance may be due to the fact that the perovskite phase was not pure, as revealed by the XRD pattern provided in the paper. Using a similar cell architecture but changing the ratio and concentration of PbI2 and MAI, Lam et al.17 pushed the efficiency of the device up to 7.4%. Snaith et al.18 introduced a thin compact TiOx film between PC61BM and Al electrode and used CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as an absorber to make a device with an efficiency of up to 9.8%, in 2014. The same year, Yang et al.19 used the same absorber CH3NH3PbI3−xClx to fabricate a device with 11.5% efficiency and a very high fill factor of 0.72. Grätzel et al.20 used a well-designed perovskite cell architecture to achieve an efficiency of 12.04%. They co-evaporated PbI2 and MAI to prepare the perovskite film, inserted an electron blocking (polyTPD) layer in between the perovskite and PEDOT:PSS, and used Au as an electrode. Note that the resultant cell had an impressive high open-circuit voltage of 1.05 V. Nevertheless, when the active area of the device was enlarged from 0.09 cm2 to 0.89 cm2, the efficiency decreased from 12.04% to 8.27% due to a significant decrease in the FF value (from 0.67 to 0.52). Hence, improving the FF in perovskite-based cells is very critical for obtaining high efficiency cells when the active area is enlarged.
Planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells have the advantage of a simple architecture and thus can be fabricated easily.21 All organic-perovskite films used in OPV-typed (inverted) solar cells were fabricated either using a one-step solution process17,18 or the co-evaporation method.20 Very recently, Xiao et al.22 used an interdiffusion method to prepare organic-perovskite films, resulting in high efficiency and high device yields. In this paper, we present a very similar method called a two-step spin coating process that is related to Xiao's method (actually our paper was nearly ready when we noticed Xiao's paper) to fabricate highly crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 films. Furthermore, we optimized the quality of the PEDOT:PSS layer such that a highly crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 film formed at room temperature. In contrast, in Xiao's paper, they had heated the PbI2 and MAI layers to form a perovskite by the interdiffusion between two components. Using our method, the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I was well-controlled by the thickness of PbI2 and the process of adding CH3NH3I. Therefore the preparation of the perovskite film can be carried out in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. This method has great potential to be used in assembling cost-effective, flexible solar cells. The optimized device under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) radiation achieved a remarkably high conversion efficiency of 16.31% with a remarkably high Voc of 1.05 V. Device fabrication is also very reproducible: ca. 80% of devices have efficiency higher than 15% (see Fig. S1 of ESI†).
The fabrication steps and architecture of the inverted-type perovskite solar cell reported in this paper are shown in Fig. 1. Detailed preparation procedures and materials used can be found in the Experimental section. The cell is the simplest bilayer planar hetero-junction structure generally used in organic small molecule solar cells (SMSCs). In this device, instead of organic small molecules, the perovskite is used as the light absorber and hole transport layer, whereas PCBM is the electron transport layer. However, there are four inorganic/organic interphases in this simple inverted perovskite cell (vs. two interphases in a typical SMSC). Each interphase should be carefully engineered to obtain a highly efficient device. For example, we found that a high quality PEDOT:PSS dense film can be obtained when the ITO substrate is preheated to 120 °C for 5 min. On the other hand, PEDOT:PSS film deposited on cold ITO is rough and has some defects (see Fig. S2, ESI†). A smooth PEDOT:PSS film is essential for fabricating highly crystalline/good adhesion CH3NH3PbI3 film without defects at room temperature, as revealed by the SEM micrographs also displayed in Fig. S2, ESI.† Therefore, all devices discussed in this article were fabricated by depositing PEDOT:PSS films on preheated ITO substrates via spin-coating.
 Fig. 1  Preparation steps and architecture of inverted perovskite/PCBM solar cells (SC: Spin-coating, TE: thermal evaporation). 
In the two-step spin-coating process, various thicknesses of PbI2 films were first deposited on the PEDOT:PSS surface using a PbI2/DMF solution and by varying the spin rate. Nevertheless, when the spin rate is reduced to 1000 rpm, the morphology of the resulting 250 nm PbI2 film is very rough and also cannot adhere well to the substrate. Therefore, high quality PbI2 films with a thickness of 165 nm (spin rate 1500 rpm) were used for the next fabrication step. To prepare the CH3NH3PbI3 film, a MAI/isopropanol (IPA) solution with a concentration range from 10 mg mL−1 to 50 mg mL−1 was spin-coated on top of the PbI2 film at a fixed spin rate of 1500 rpm for 30 seconds, and then a layer PCBM was deposited via spin coating at ambient atmosphere. One important advantage of fabricating perovskite films using a two-step spin-coating method is that the fabrication of PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM can be carried out in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. After employing Ca/Al electrodes prepared using vacuum thermal evaporation, the photovoltaic parameters of the resulting cells were measured, and the results are summarized in Table 1.

Data in Table 1 reveal that the efficiency of perovskite solar cell is very sensitive to the concentration of the MAI/IPA solution. The concentration of MAI not only affects the perovskite formation rate and film homogeneity but also the purity and crystallinity of the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 film, which determines the efficiency of the corresponding solar cell. However, in a one-step process reported previously, PbI2 and MAI with different stoichiometries were mixed first and then spin-coated on the substrate. The formation rate and purity of CH3NH3PbI3 depends on the mole ratio of PbI2 and MAI in the solution. It is difficult to control the formation rate (which affects the film morphology) and stoichiometry of the perovskite separately. Moreover, the ratio of PbI2 and MAI and the reaction rate between the two species can be manipulated individually in a two-step process reported in this paper. This is another very important advantage of the two-step process. Furthermore, the two-step method (spin-coating of PbI2 film followed by dipping the film in a MAI solution) has been used to fabricate regular DSC type perovskite solar cells.2 However, the dipping process may damage the PEDOT:PSS/PbI2 interface as the resulting cell was found to have a low fill factor (unpublished result).
To understand why the concentration of MAI/IPA solution affects the efficiency of the resulting perovskite solar cells, X-ray diffraction patterns of the perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS were obtained and are shown in Fig. 2 (the original 2D data are provided in Fig. S3 of ESI†). Using a lower (36 mg mL−1) MAI concentration, the reaction between PbI2 and MAI is not complete, as unreacted PbI2 was detected. When using a higher (40 mg mL−1) MAI concentration, although no PbI2 is observed, a new phase with a diffraction peak at 2θ of 10.9° is present. We do not know exactly the structure and components of this new phase; perhaps it is a CH3NH3PbI3-intercalated compound. The pure CH3NH3PbI3 phase was observed only when the concentration of MAI/IPA solution is ca. 38 mg mL−1. The peaks appearing at 2θ of 13.7°, 19.5°, 24.0°, 27.9, 31.4°, 40.2°, 42.7°, and 49.9° indicate the formation of the perovskite structure.23,24 Interestingly, most reported XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films only exhibited three low angle (<35°) diffraction peaks at 2θ of 13.9°, 28.3° and 31.7°, corresponding to the (110), (220) and (310) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure. Nevertheless, the XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3 prepared using our two-step method exhibited two extra peaks at 19.5° (210) and 24.0° (202). These two diffraction peaks were observed in the simulated perovskite XRD pattern reported by Grätzel et al.20 A higher number of diffraction peaks indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared are highly crystalline. Furthermore, the concentration of MAI also affects the morphology of the perovskite film as revealed by the SEM micrographs in Fig. S4 of ESI.† A smooth, dense perovskite film was observed when the concentration of MAI is close to 38 mg mL−1 with lower or higher MAI concentrations resulting in a rough film with some defects.

PC71BM (has good electron mobility25,26) was used to replace PC61BM, which is the most commonly used acceptor in perovskite solar cells, as an electron transporting material, and the efficiency of the resulting device increases from 9.92% to 13.29%, mainly due to an increase in the short-circuit current (Jsc, see Table 2). A significant increase in the Jsc without an obvious change in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) suggests that the electron transport rate of the acceptor layer has a tremendous effect on the Jsc and therefore the conversion efficiency (η) of the inverted perovskite solar cell. To further optimize the device, the PC71BM layer was solvent annealed (the detailed process was described in the Experimental section) at room temperature and the photovoltaic data of the resulting device are also provided in Table 2. Upon solvent annealing of the PC71BM layer for 24 h, the efficiency of the perovskite cell increases further to 16.31%, the highest efficiency for an OPV-type perovskite solar cell reported today with a significant improvement in both the photocurrent (from 18.13 mA cm−2 to 19.98 mA cm−2) and Voc (from 0.93 to 1.05 V). Extending the solvent annealing time did not further improve the efficiency.

The I–V and IPCE curves of the champion (highest efficiency) cell (η = 16.31%) are displayed in Fig. 3. The IPCE curve shows a strong spectral response in the range from 350 nm to 750 nm with an efficiency of over 80% for all the wavelengths. The integrated current (19.20 mA cm−2) from the IPCE curve is very close to the Jsc (19.98 mA cm−2) obtained from the I–V curve. It is notable that the champion cell has a good FF of 0.78 and remarkably high Voc of 1.05 V, which is the highest among all perovskite solar cells reported in the literature.27,28 The Voc of the champion device is much higher than that of Xiao's device, although the FF is slightly lower. We believe that a high Voc and FF, which depend on the series resistance of the device, are the key parameters for achieving such high efficiency in inverted perovskite solar cells. To explore why the cell prepared using the two-step spin-coating method exhibited such a high Voc and FF, the layer stacking of the device (or the morphology of the perovskite film in the vertical direction) was investigated.

I–V and IPCE curves of the champion perovskite/PCBM solar cell reported in this paper. 
The SEM of a cross section of the champion cell (without the Ca/Al electrode) is shown in Fig. 4. The SEM image revealed a well-defined, layer-by-layer structure with clear interfaces between each layer. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS, perovskite and the PC71BM layers estimated from the SEM pictures is 40 nm, 360 nm (close to the value measured a depth-profile meter), and 140 nm, respectively. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 and PC71BM layers is similar to that reported by Yang et al.,19 but the PC71BM layer is much thicker than that of the cell fabricated by Grätzel et al.20 Furthermore, although perovskite films appeared to be composed of aggregated particles, most particles have a grain size close to the film thickness. Therefore, excitons can diffuse within a single particle (crystallite) to the perovskite/PCBM interphase to undergo charge separation, while the holes can transport to the PEDOT:PSS/ITO anode via a single perovskite granule under very low internal resistance. Each layer is in close contact with one another, which makes the interphase resistance also very low. The series resistance calculated from the I–V curves of the corresponding devices is provided in Table 2. Perovskite solar cells with a higher Voc and FF also have a lower series resistance. The champion cell reported in this article has a series resistance of as low as 4.41 Ω cm2. The structure of the cross-section provides a reason to explain why the cell with a thick perovskite film and 4 organic/inorganic interphases still has a very high Voc, FF and therefore high power conversion efficiency.

We found that to achieve a conversion efficiency of higher than 15%, high quality (crystalline and pure) perovskite films and solvent annealing of the device are necessary for inverted perovskite solar cells. To learn more about the effect of solvent annealing on the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell, UV/Vis absorption and PL spectra of the device (without Ca/Al electrode) with and without solvent annealing were obtained and are displayed in Fig. 5. The perovskite film has an absorption profile that extends to the NIR (800 nm) with an absorption coefficient (ε, absorbance divided by the film thickness) of 4.1 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm. High ε indicates that the perovskite film prepared via the two-step method is very dense.20,26 Solvent annealing of the PC71BM layer did not change the absorption profile and intensity of perovskite film; however, the intensity of PL, due to the recombination of perovskite excitons, decreased significantly. The decrease in the PL intensity without changing the absorption profile suggests that the increase in the Jsc may not due to a structural change of the perovskite film. Instead, it suggests that electron transfer from the perovskite to PC71BM is more efficient, probably due to better perovskite/PC71BM interfacial contact from the solvent annealing. The PL intensity of the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC71BM film is almost zero after it was solvent annealed for 1 h, which indicates that exciton separation and charge transfer are very efficient when the perovskite and PC71BM have good contact. However, the device with the highest efficiency (16.31%) was observed when the perovskite/PC71BM film was solvent annealed for 24 h (see Table S2†). Therefore, extending the solvent annealing time may also increase the ordering of the PC71BM film, which increases the electron transport rate. Furthermore, the perovskite is known as a bipolar absorber, indicating that it can be a hole and electron transporter. The PL intensity of the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite and perovskite/PCBM films are much weaker than that of the glass/perovskite film, which suggests that the charge separation of the exciton can occur in PEDOT:PSS/perovskite and perovskite/PCBM interfaces. Moreover, the PL intensity of perovskite/PCBM film is weaker than that of PEDOT:PSS/ perovskite film, suggesting that perovskite/PC71BM interphase is a better place for excitons to split.

Compared to the photovoltaic parameters of the inverted perovskite cell recently reported by Xiao et al.22 (Jsc: 19.6 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.99 V, FF: 0.793 and 15.4% efficiency) or the champion regular perovskite cell reported by Kelly et al.28 (Jsc: 20.4 mA cm−2, Voc: 1.03 V, FF: 0.749 and 15.7% efficiency), our device showed the highest open circuit voltage, as well as a comparable fill factor and short current, suggesting the importance of the cell interface engineering. CH3NH3PbI3 has a low exciton binding energy (Eb) (19 ± 3 meV calculated by Lam et al.9), much lower than that of conjugated molecules,29 and a high conductivity (∼10−3 S cm−2, measured by Grätzel et al.30). We believe that the thickness of the perovskite layer can be further increased or other derivatives can be used that exhibit high electric conductivity (such as CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) to increase the photocurrent without a loss in the Voc and FF of the cell. With careful engineering of each layer, inverted (or OSC-typed) planar hetero-junction perovskite solar cell with higher efficiency can be expected in the future.
It is known31 that some perovskite solar cells show photocurrent hysteresis at certain voltage scanning rate (or sweep delay time) and scan direction. The photocurrent hysteresis may be due to either charge traps in low quality perovskite films or ferroelectric properties of the perovskite material and/or the electromigration of ion in perovskites. The efficiency reported for a device with photocurrent hysteresis may not truly represent the performance of the device. We also used different sweep delay times and two opposite scan directions to measure the I–V curves and the results are displayed in Fig. 6. Our perovskite solar cell shows no photocurrent hysteresis at all sweep delay times and scan directions. The results also suggested that the hysteresis in the photocurrent is more likely due to the defects or charge traps in the perovskite film, which can be solved by the film fabrication process. The device fabricated with our method has a negligible amount of charge traps, and therefore a high open-circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency.

In conclusion, we report a two-step spin coating method for the synthesis of highly crystalline and dense perovskite films with better control of the film stoichiometry and formation rate, which affects the film morphology and charge trap defects of the perovskite. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM film can be fabricated in an ambient atmosphere using a solution process at a low temperature. The champion cell has a power conversion efficiency of 16.31% with a remarkably high Voc of 1.05 V and FF of 0.78. The efficiency reproducibility of the devices is also high: ca. 80% of devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of higher than 15%. The results demonstrate that fabricating highly efficient inverted perovskite solar cells in a more controllable way is possible via a new perovskite film preparation method and careful interface engineering.
Experimental
Materials and physicochemical studies
An aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (1.3–1.7 wt%, from H.C. Stark Baytron P AI 4083) was obtained from Heraeus Co. Fullerene derivatives (PC61BM (99.8%) and PC71BM (99.8%)) were purchased from Solenne B. V., Netherlands. PbI2 (99.999%) was purchased from Aldrich Co. All the above materials were used as received. ITO-covered glass substrates purchased from Merck Co. were photolithographically patterned in our laboratory with HCl(aq). CH3NH3I (MAI, 99.99%) was synthesized using the same method as published in literature.30 UV/Vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-4100 and F-7000 spectrometer, respectively. The thickness of the films was measured using a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on a 1 cm × 1 cm film were made by carefully scratching with a tip and the average height between the hills and valleys was used to determine the film thickness. GIXRD data were collected in the 2θ range of 5–50° on a Brucker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) equipped with a 2D detector using Cu Kα1 radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 15 kV. Samples (the surface and cross-section of a film on substrates) for SEM imaging were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape, and then coated with a thin layer of gold film to avoid charging.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurement
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on a heat pretreated patterned ITO under 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. For depositing the perovskite layer, first a layer of PbI2 was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate from a 0.5 M DMF solution. After the PbI2 layer was dried in air, CH3NH3I was spin-coated on top of PbI2 film from an isopropanol solution of various concentrations at spin rates of 1500 rpm to form the perovskite structure. Specifically, the highest efficiency device was observed using a concentration of CH3NH3I/IPA of ca. 38 mg mL−1 at a spin rate of 1500 rpm. After the perovskite film was formed, 4 wt% PCBM in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Solvent annealing of PCBM layer was performed by covering the perovskite/PCBM film with a Petri dish for 24 hours before placing in a vacuum evaporator. All the fabrication procedures were performed in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Finally, the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM film was transferred to a vacuum chamber for coating with the Ca/Al electrode (20 nm/100 nm). The device area was 0.5 cm × 0.2 cm. The I–V characteristics of the solar cells were determined using a Keithley 4200 source measuring unit under a simulated AM 1.5G light (Wacom solar simulator) at 100 mW cm−2 and the light intensity was calibrated by KG-5 Si diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for the phase sensitive detection with a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enlitech Inc., Taiwan).
