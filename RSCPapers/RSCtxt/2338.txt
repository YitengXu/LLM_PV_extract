1. Introduction
In recent years, with the consumption of traditional coal, oil, and natural gas, environmental pollution and the energy crisis have become increasingly severe. The problem of energy shortage has become the primary problem hindering economic development and has become the focus of attention in the world. Solar energy is regarded as a clean, safe, and inexhaustible ideal renewable energy source, which is receiving more and more attention. How to use solar energy with high efficiency and low cost has become a research hotspot all over the world, which is of great significance for solving the energy crisis. In recent years, perovskite solar cells have become the focus of worldwide attention due to their excellent photoelectric properties, such as high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and long carrier diffusion length.1–5 Solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconductor materials have seen an improved photoelectric conversion efficiency from 3.8% to 25.2%.6 With the development and maturity of the process, perovskite solar cells are expected to exceed the photoelectric conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and have very broad application prospects. However, the organic cation clusters (CH3NH3+, FA+, CH(NH2)2+, etc.) in organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites are extremely sensitive to environmental humidity and oxygen content, leading to problems such as poor environmental stability and poor thermal stability.7–9 Therefore, the further development of organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells has been restricted.
Compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, all-inorganic perovskite materials show better mechanical properties and moisture stability by replacing organic cations (MA+/FA+) with inorganic cations (Cs+).10 Therefore, they have received wide attention from researchers in recent years. All-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 is a direct band-gap semiconductor with low trap state density, high carrier mobility, long electron–hole diffusion length, etc., and it also has some excellent optical characteristics such as high quantum yield, strong light absorption, high luminous efficiency and adjustable luminous wavelength.11–14 These characteristics make it have huge potential applications in the fields of strongly luminescent colloidal quantum dots (QD),15 air-stable perovskite solar cells,16 high-sensitivity photodetectors,17 lasers, and high-energy radiation detectors.18 However, most current perovskite devices are based on polycrystalline thin films, which are greatly affected by grain boundary charge traps.19,20 This has an adverse effect on the optoelectronic performance of the device. Compared with the polycrystalline CsPbBr3 film, because the CsPbBr3 crystal has no influence of grain boundaries and surface states, the trap density is 5–6 orders of magnitude lower than that of the polycrystalline film. The CsPbBr3 crystal also has higher stability and processability.21,22 Therefore, for high-performance optoelectronic devices, research on high-quality CsPbBr3 crystals is very necessary.
In this article, we will review the latest research advances in CsPbBr3 crystals. We will first introduce the basic crystal structure of CsPbBr3, and then discuss the different growth methods and applications of CsPbBr3 crystals. Finally, we will look forward to the development prospects of perovskite CsPbBr3 crystal materials.
2. CsPbBr3 crystal structure
The crystal structure of CsPbBr3 is a typical ABX3 type perovskite structure. Fig. 1 is the sketch of the 3D arrangement of the PbX6 octahedra in the CsPbBr3 perovskite.23 CsPbBr3 has two phase transition points between room temperature and the melting point. When the temperature rises from room temperature, CsPbBr3 turns from the orthogonal phase (Pbnm) into the tetragonal phase (P4/mbm, 88 °C) and cubic phase (Pmm, 130 °C) (Fig. 1).24,25 When the temperature crosses the transformation point, the lattice structure will be distorted, and a large stress will be generated inside the crystal. The stress easily leads to a higher concentration of vacancies and substitution defects, which will have a great impact on the material properties.

3.1 CsPbBr3 Crystal growth

3.1.1 Inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method. 
The ITC method uses the material's abnormal solubility in specific organic solvents (the solubility decreases with increasing temperature) to achieve crystal growth. The schematic diagram of the growth process is shown in Fig. 2a. The crystal growth process is a dynamic equilibrium between dissolution and precipitation. As the temperature increases, the solubility of the crystals in organic solvents decreases, and spontaneous nucleation occurs when supersaturation is reached.

M. V. Kovalenko et al. (2016) dissolved CsBr:PbBr2 (molar ratio 1:2, Pb concentration 1 M) into a mixed solution of dymethylsulfoxide (DMSO), cyclohexanol (CyOH) and dimethylformamide (DMF).26 When heated to 90 °C, the crystals began to nucleate. The crystals then grew further when heated to 110 °C, and finally a CsPbBr3 crystal with a maximum size of 8 mm was obtained (Fig. 2b). It was also found that CyOH or a CyOH/DMF mixture smoothed the solubility–temperature curve (Fig. 2b), thereby increasing the possibility of CsPbBr3 crystal growth repeatability. O. M. Bakr et al. (2017) studied the effects of different CsBr and PbBr2 ratio solutions, temperature, etc. on the by-products.27 The crystal growth conditions are as follows: the molar ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 is 1:2, DMSO is the solvent, and the temperature is raised to 100 °C. After filtration, the solution is transferred to another glass bottle preheated to 100 °C, and then heated to 120 °C. Three hours later, a rectangular orthorhombic CsPbBr3 crystal with a size of 3 mm × 2 mm × 1 mm was grown, and no other by-products were formed. B. Yang et al. (2020) used the ITC method to grow high-quality CsPbBr3 crystals doped with different amounts of Rb.28 They found that the orbit coupling between Pb and Br atoms in the PbBr6 octahedron can be enhanced by doping Rb with a smaller atom size at the Cs position of CsPbBr3. The carrier transmission efficiency is improved and the defect concentration is reduced, thereby increasing the resistivity and carrier mobility lifetime product (μτ) of the CsPbBr3 crystal. B. B. Zhang et al. (2020) used a modified ITC growth method to grow Cl/I-doped CsPbBr3 crystals in a temperature range of 40–70 °C.29 It is found that as the doping amount of Cl increases, the band gap of the crystal broadens, and the conductivity type changes from P type to N type. Because the temperature range of the abnormal dissolution of CsPbBr3 is relatively low, high-quality, sub-centimeter-level CsPbBr3 crystals can be quickly grown at low temperatures using the ITC method. But the difficulty of this method is to precisely control the ratio and temperature of the reactants.


3.1.2 Anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method. 
The AVC method utilizes the different solubility of the perovskite in different solvents for crystal growth. This method is generally applicable to the case where the raw material has a large solubility in one solvent, and the solubility in the other solvent is small, and the two solvents are mutually soluble. During the growth process, the poor solvent is slowly diffused into the good solvent in which the CsPbBr3 crystals are dissolved, so that the CsPbBr3 in the solution is supersaturated and the crystals are precipitated (Fig. 3a). CsPbBr3 crystals can crystallize at room temperature, and the crystal growth process can also be accelerated by heating the antisolvent to increase the diffusion rate.30

D. Y. Jung et al. (2017) grew orange CsPbBr3 crystals with a rectangular size of 0.67 × 2.0 × 0.51 mm in polar solvents by the AVC method, and found that crystals can be effectively grown in a narrow growth window.31 J. X. Ding et al. (2017) used methanol as an anti-solvent, and overcame the limitations of similarities of d-values and octahedral arrangements along the [101] and [020] directions by optimizing the growth conditions. Orthogonal phase CsPbBr3 crystals with the (101) crystal plane were grown from saturated DMSO solution.32 W. Q. Jie et al. (2017) obtained a phase diagram of the final product with five regions by adjusting the molar ratio of PbBr2 and CsBr, including Cs4PbBr6, CsPbBr3, and PbBr2·2[(CH3)2·SO] single-phase and mixed-phase regions. Using DMSO to dilute the anti-solvent MeOH solution to reduce its vapor pressure can effectively regulate the growth rate, and finally grow a CsPbBr3 crystal with a size of 42 × 5 × 3 mm (Fig. 3d).33 X. S. Fang et al. (2019) fabricated a millimeter-scale CsPbBr3 crystal by the AVC method, and immersed the CsPbBr3 crystal in a CuI solution for heat treatment to obtain a CsPbBr3 crystal/CuI heterojunction.34 Similar to the ITC method, the AVC method has the advantages of simple equipment and fast crystal growth. However, large-size and high-quality CsPbBr3 crystals are difficult to obtain with this method.


3.1.3 Bridgman growth method. 
The Bridgman growth method is a commonly used large-size bulk crystal growth method. The specific process is as follows: the raw material for crystal growth is placed in a crucible, the furnace temperature is controlled to melt the raw material, and then the crucible is slowly lowered in the furnace with a certain temperature gradient to realize the directional solidification crystallization of the melt (Fig. 4a).35

In 2013, M. G. Kanatzidis et al. used high-purity PbBr2 and CsBr as raw materials to synthesize CsPbBr3 polycrystalline powders by a high-temperature solid-phase method, and successfully grew a 7 mm diameter and 20 mm length CsPbBr3 crystal.36 The temperature gradient of crystal growth is 10 °C mm−1, and the growth rate is 3–30 mm h−1. In 2018, M. G. Kanatzidis's research group optimized the growth kinetic parameters such as the moving speed (0.5 mm h−1), growth temperature (overheating temperature 15 °C), temperature gradient (9 °C cm−1), cooling process (5 °C h−1) etc. during the crystal growth process.37 An orange-red transparent CsPbBr3 crystal with no visible cracks or grain boundaries was grown with a diameter of 11 mm and a length of about 60 mm. X. T. Tao et al. (2018) found that a suitable temperature gradient is very important for crystal growth, which can not only play a good role in impurity removal, but also does not cause crystal cracking.35 The slow cooling rate can effectively avoid cracking and twinning of the crystal during the cooling process. By optimizing the growth parameters such as the temperature field and cooling rate, a CsPbBr3 crystal with a diameter of 24 mm and a length of about 90 mm was grown (Fig. 4b). The Bridgman crystal growth method can seal the raw materials in a growth crucible, reduce the volatilization of the components, and help improve the uniformity of the crystal composition. The raw materials are not limited by the solubility in the solvent, and one can grow large-sized crystals. However, due to the direct contact between the crystal and the crucible, it is easy to cause heterogeneous nucleation, which affects the yield of the single crystal. The crystal is more likely to generate thermal stress at high temperatures, which will cause dislocation defects.


3.1.4 Electronic dynamic gradient (EDG) method. 
The EDG method achieves a temperature gradient in the adiabatic zone by setting the upper and lower temperature zones of a double-temperature zone tube furnace to different temperatures, and the size of the temperature gradient is adjusted by controlling the size of the temperature difference. In the temperature gradient region, the temperature decreases linearly from top to bottom. In the early stage of growth, the lowest temperature of the gradient region must be above the melting point of CsPbBr3 so that CsPbBr3 is fully melted, and then the temperature is slowly reduced to complete the crystal growth (Fig. 5a).38

Z. P. Zheng et al. (2017, 2018) used solid-phase synthesis of CsPbBr3 as a raw material to load a sharp quartz crucible, sealed at 0.1 Pa.39,40 The temperature gradient was 7–10 °C cm−1, and the growth rate was 0.5 mm h−1. It was cooled to 130 °C at a rate of 10 °C h−1, and then cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 1 °C h−1, and a single crystal having a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 60 mm was grown. The grown CsPbBr3 crystal grows preferentially in the (110) direction, and the half-width of the X-ray rocking curve in the (220) direction is 0.87°, indicating that the grown crystal has a low dislocation density. In addition, the crystal has good transparency and high infrared and ultraviolet-visible light transmittance. The EDG method does not have a mechanical transmission device, and the ampoule remains stationary during the entire growth process, which is conducive to the growth of high-quality CsPbBr3 crystals.


3.1.5 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. 
The CVD method is an effective method for preparing single crystal films of traditional semiconductors (such as ZnO, GaAs, etc.), and can effectively integrate semiconductors with various epitaxial substrates, thereby facilitating the design and fabrication of a variety of integrated devices with excellent performance. For the preparation of all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3, a uniformly mixed powder of PbX2 and CsX can be used as the evaporation source of the CVD reaction, and the deposited substrate can be placed in the low-temperature region downstream. By adjusting the temperature, pressure, and reaction time, the deposition of the perovskite on the substrate can be controlled. At this stage, CsPbBr3 prepared by CVD often has a small crystal size and cannot be used to construct perovskite film devices. Therefore, the growth conditions of larger size perovskite film crystals need to be explored.
Using the 2 × 2 CsPbBr3(100) unit lattice to match the 3 × 3 SrTiO3(100) unit lattice relationship, J. Chen (2018) grew a perovskite CsPbBr3 single crystal film with a thickness of 1–7 μm on a perovskite SrTiO3(100) crystal by the CVD method (Fig. 6).41 The Volmer–Weber island growth mode of CsPbBr3 on SrTiO3(100) was revealed, while the thickening process of the CsPbBr3 single crystal film itself followed the layer-by-layer homogeneous epitaxial growth mode. It was found that increasing the temperature is the key to growing CsPbBr3 single crystal films. High temperature can promote the diffusion of adsorbed atoms and accelerate the nucleation rate of preferential epitaxial seeds, which is helpful for CsPbBr3 to merge into a film under the island growth mode. L. Y. Zhao et al. (2019) epitaxially grew a high-quality CsPbBr3 rectangular single-crystal film with an atomically smooth surface on a c-wurtzite GaN/sapphire substrate by the CVD method. The single crystal film has a size of 200 × 100 μm and a thickness of 0.7–2 μm.42 The CsPbBr3 crystals are driven by a disproportionate lattice to be aligned in the [−12−10], [11−20] and [2−1−1] directions of the (0001) plane of the GaN substrate. The quality and optical properties of the grown CsPbBr3 crystals are comparable to those grown on a mica substrate.

3.2 CsPbBr3 crystal defects
The defect characteristics of semiconductor crystals, especially those of intrinsic point defects, are critical to their optoelectronic performance. Defects can significantly affect the carrier mobility, lifetime and recombination rate.43–45 In addition, intrinsic defects also determine the types of doping elements and their concentration limit.46–48 Therefore, a good understanding of the properties of defects is important for the application of materials. For the CsPbBr3 crystal, theory predicts the existence of 12 kinds of intrinsic point defects, including three vacancies (VCs, VPb, and VBr), three interstitials (Csi, Pbi, and Bri), and six antisites (CsPb, CsBr, PbBr, PbCs, BrCs, and BrPb) (Fig. 7a and b).49 L. W. Wang et al. (2017) investigated the properties of intrinsic point defects in CsPbBr3 based on first-principles calculations and found that moderate or Br-poor growth conditions can reduce the defect concentration of CsPbBr3. They also found that the dominant defects in CsPbBr3 only introduced shallow transition levels, not carrier trapping centers, and thus CsPbBr3 is a defect tolerant semiconductor.49 Z. P. Zheng et al. (2018) systematically studied the intrinsic point defects of CsPbBr3 crystals grown by the EDG method through thermally stimulated current (TSC) technology, and found five possible intrinsic point defects in CsPbBr3 crystals, namely VCs and VBr vacancies, Csi and Pbi interstitials, and PbBr antisites (Fig. 7c).50 Due to the low formation energy (ΔHCs), VCs is a common defect, especially in Pb-rich samples. Due to the high Br vapor pressure, shallow defects VBr are easily formed in CsPbBr3. The formation of Pbi originates from the deviation of Pb in the sample and the expansion of the [PbBr6] octahedron caused by deformation with decreasing temperature. High temperature and temperature gradients are the main reasons for the formation of VCs, VBr, and Pbi defects in crystals of melt growth. The PbBr antisites are generated by non-radiative recombination of VBr vacancies and Pbi interstitials. Fewer defect types and lower concentrations are observed in solution-grown CsPbBr3 crystals compared to the reported defect states in melt-grown CsPbBr3 crystals. For CsPbBr3 crystals grown by the ITC method, B. B. Zhang (2020) et al. observed only the defects of [BrCs]2− (acceptor, hole-type) and [Pbi]1+ (donor, electronic-type) based on TSC spectra.51 The concentration of [BrCs]2− is 4.35 × 1013 cm−3, which is 5.6 times higher than that of [Pbi]1+ (donor). Therefore, p-type carriers dominate the CsPbBr3 crystals grown by the ITC method, which is consistent with the experimental results reported previously.27,33,37 G. D. Zhang (2020) et al. observed 1–2 μm inclusions (labeled CPB-1) in CsPbBr3 crystals grown by the Bridgeman method using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for the first time (Fig. 7d).52 By using a slower growth rate (0.2 mm h−1) and cooling rate (5 °C h−1) than CPB-1, inclusions (labeled CPB-2) in subsequent growth were eliminated. Due to the elimination of impurities, the carrier mobility of CPB-2 increased by an order of magnitude (from 10.1 ± 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (CPB-1) to 101.3 ± 4.2 cm2 V−1 s−1).

3.3 Stoichiometric ratio of CsPbBr3 crystals
For the solution method (taking the AVC method as an example): according to the phase diagram of PbBr2:CsBr compositions,53 it can be seen that CsBr-rich Cs4PbBr6 and PbBr2-rich CsPb2Br5 are slightly different from the ideal 1:1 PbBr2:CsBr, and thus it is difficult to prepare pure CsPbBr3 compounds. In addition, the solubility of PbBr2 and CsBr in aprotic solvents is very different, so that the reactivity of the dissolved substances is greatly different, which leads to the precipitation of CsBr or PbBr2-rich compounds with the required CsPbBr3 crystal. Therefore, growing crystals of 1:1 (CsPbBr3) has great challenges. G. Hodes et al. reported that the optimal concentration balance can be found between the precursors (PbBr2:CsBr) (which may not be 1:1 in this case), where the addition of an antisolvent will cause precipitation of the desired product.30 One must titrate to the saturation point of the DMSO precursor solution and filter further, forcing the system to approach this optimal ratio. This method may become a potential method for controlling the stoichiometric ratio of CsPbBr3 crystals for the solution method.
For the melt method (Bridgman and EDG): the preparation of pure phase CsPbBr3 polycrystalline materials is a key step for controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the crystals. There are two main methods for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline materials: the chemical co-precipitation method and the high temperature solid phase method.35,54 For the chemical co-precipitation method, the stoichiometric ratio of the PbBr2 and CsBr reactants at 1:1.01 is favourable for the formation of the CsPbBr3 pure phase.40 The larger the degree of deviation of the ratio of PbBr2 and CsBr, the greater the degree of deviation of the relative content of the elements, and the greater the content of heterogeneous phases such as CsPb2Br5 generated. For the high-temperature solid-phase method, CsBr and PbBr2 are mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 and sintered at high temperature to obtain pure CsPbBr3.55 The precise control of the raw material ratio is key to the preparation of high-purity CsPbBr3 polycrystalline materials. If the ratio of the raw materials deviates, it is easy to form heterogeneous phases such as CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6. Then, the prepared CsPbBr3 polycrystalline material was purified by directional solidification. In the purification process, impurities are mainly concentrated at the tail end of the ingot. After purification, the impurity enrichment area at the tail end of the polycrystalline material is discarded, and the remaining part is used for the next purification. CsPbBr3 polycrystalline materials for crystal growth can be obtained by repeating the purification 3–4 times.
3.4 Applications of CsPbBr3 single crystals

3.4.1 Photodetectors. 
A photodetector is a device that can convert light signals into electrical signals. It is widely used in many fields such as image sensing, environmental monitoring, missile early warning, biological detection and communication.56,57 The performance parameters of a photodetector mainly include: response time, response (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE), and normalized detection efficiency (D*).58 In general, the shorter the response time of the detector, the higher the response, and the greater the external quantum efficiency and the higher the normalized detection efficiency, the better the detection performance of the device. Due to their excellent optoelectronic properties such as high mobility, long carrier diffusion length, and high stability, CsPbBr3 perovskite crystals have become a very promising photodetection material.59
Osman M. Bakr et al. (2017) used a CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal grown by ITC to achieve an on/off ratio of 105 at zero bias, a responsivity of 0.028 A W−1 and a detection efficiency of 1.7 × 1011 Jones (Fig. 8a).27 J. Y. Xu et al. (2017) demonstrated that a CsPbBr3 crystal prepared by the Bridgman method exhibited excellent dual-mode light absorption characteristics, and prepared it into a photodetector. It was found that when the loading voltage was 5 V, the responsivity reached 2 A W−1, much higher than commercial Si-based detectors (<0.2 A W−1). In addition, under the same 5 V bias, its responsivity in the infrared band is 1.4 mA W−1, which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the previously reported MAPbBr3 crystal material. It is also compatible with commercial two-photon detectors such as Si and GaAs (Fig. 8b).60 X. T. Tao et al. (2018) used the Bridgeman method to grow a CsPbBr3 single crystal with a size of φ 24 mm × 90 mm, which confirmed that the mobility of electrons along the b axis (11.61 cm2 (V s)−1) is an order of magnitude higher than that along the c axis. The responsivity of the 532 nm laser reaches 5.83 A W−1, and the external quantum efficiency of the (001) plane reaches 1360% at a bias voltage of 10 V, which is 305% higher than that of the (010) plane (Fig. 8c). The normalized detection efficiency reaches 2.5 × 1012 Jones, and its on/off ratio can reach 103 under a bias of 2 V, which also shows its sensitive light detection performance.35

3.4.2 High-energy radiation detectors. 
High-energy radiation detectors have a wide range of applications in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, security inspections, space science, and many other fields.61,62 Semiconductor high-energy radiation detectors are a kind of excellent detector after gas and scintillator detectors. They have received more and more attention due to their better spectral response characteristics and energy resolution. As high-energy radiation detection materials, the following conditions are generally required: large average atomic number, suitable band gap (1.5–3 eV), large electrical resistivity, high carrier mobility lifetime product (μτ), etc. CsPbBr3 has a large atomic number (Pb: 82, Cs: 55, Br: 35), which determines that it has a high radiation absorption coefficient.63 The CsPbBr3 band gap is 2.26 eV. Larger resistivity and smaller leakage current determine its higher energy resolution. At the same time, the carrier mobility lifetime product of CsPbBr3 is also relatively large, which is similar to those of commercially available zinc cadmium telluride (CdZnTe) and thorium bromide (TlBr). Therefore, CsPbBr3 is likely to become a very promising high-energy radiation detection material.
M. G. Kanatzidis et al. (2013) used the Bridgeman method to grow a high-quality CsPbBr3 crystal with a resistivity of up to 343 G cm, which is equivalent to the levels of CdZnTe and TlBr.36 The carrier mobility lifetime product (μτ) of electrons and holes reaches 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 (electrons) and 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 (holes), respectively. The hole carrier mobility lifetime product has exceeded the commercial nuclear radiation detector material CdZnTe by ten times, and it has a lower response to Ag (λ = 0.5742 Å) radiation than the CdZnTe detector.36 In 2018, M. G. Kanatzidis et al. refreshed the carrier transport characteristics of CsPbBr3 crystal holes again, and obtained μτ = 1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1, and the carrier lifetime (τ > 25 μs) of the holes is very long.37 The prepared detector has achieved an energy resolution of 3.9% for 122 keV 57Co γ-rays and an energy resolution of 3.8% for 662 keV 137Cs γ-rays (Fig. 9a).37 J. C. Li et al. (2020) developed a highly sensitive Rb doped CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal X-ray detector. It was found that a small amount (0.037%) of Rb doping can improve the sensitivity of the detector.28 Compared to the undoped CsPbBr3 crystal, 0.037% detector doping can increase μτ from 4.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 to 7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 and increase the X-ray sensitivity from 918 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 to 8097 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 (Fig. 9b).28

3.4.3 Perovskite solar cells. 
Perovskite solar cells generally consist of a conductive glass substrate, an electron transport layer, a perovskite light absorption layer, a hole transport layer, and a metal electrode (Fig. 10).64,65 In a solar cell, the light absorbing layer absorbs sunlight to generate electron–hole pairs. After the electron–hole pairs are separated, they are led out to the electrodes through the electron and hole transport layers. The most important factor determining the battery efficiency is the perovskite layer. But, so far, most of the light-absorbing layers of perovskite solar cells are perovskite polycrystalline films, and polycrystalline films inevitably have grain boundaries and surface defects, making it difficult to obtain theoretically higher photoelectric conversion efficiency.66 Compared with polycrystalline perovskite films, perovskite single crystals show better thermal stability, wider light absorption range, lower hole concentration, and higher carrier mobility. These excellent properties are related to the absence of grain boundaries and pores, and low density of trap-states in single crystal materials.67 At present, only a few research teams have carried out the preparation of single crystal perovskite-based solar cells. The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells based on MAPbI3 crystals has reached 21.9%, and the turn-on voltage has reached 1.15 V, creating a new record for perovskite crystal solar cells.68 Currently the photoelectric conversion efficiency of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline perovskite solar cells has exceeded 10.79%.65 Although there have been no reports of CsPbBr3 crystal perovskite solar cells, in view of the excellent characteristics of CsPbBr3 crystal materials, it is expected that CsPbBr3 crystal perovskite solar cells can obtain better photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability due to the crystal integrity and fewer defects.

3.5 Environmental stability of CsPbBr3 crystals
A polycrystalline perovskite film has a very thin amorphous grain boundary layer which is more sensitive to moisture. The relatively open structure of the grain boundary compared to the crystalline region facilitates the rapid diffusion of moisture into the polycrystalline perovskite film along the grain boundary.69 The absence of grain boundaries makes single crystals of perovskites more stable. The existence of vacancy or interstitial defects in a polycrystalline perovskite film is the cause of ion migration, which results in current–voltage hysteresis and poor light stability of perovskite solar cells.70 A single crystal perovskite with dense structure and low trap density provides a negligible ion migration pathway, which can significantly improve the performance and stability of the device. In addition, the preparation of polycrystalline perovskite films is affected by factors such as the process temperature and humidity, and therefore the film contains a large number of grain boundaries and defects. From a structural point of view, this makes the study of the mechanism of long-term stability more complicated. Therefore, the use of a defined single crystal system to study the long-term stability of perovskites can avoid the above-mentioned interference, and provides an excellent model system for effectively eliminating the role of cations and halides in the stability of perovskites, which can guide the design of new, more stable perovskite materials.
4. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
4.1 Fabrication of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
Due to its excellent optical and optoelectronic properties and simple preparation process, the all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) has attracted much attention since the first successful preparation by M. V. Kovalenko's research group in 2015.71 The liquid-phase chemical synthesis method is flexible and can effectively control the morphology and size of the nanocrystals, and is most suitable for preparing high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs).72 Liquid-phase chemical synthesis methods mainly include the hot-injection method,71,73 normal temperature co-precipitation method,74,75 solvothermal synthesis method,76,77 microwave-assisted synthesis method,78,79etc. Under the protection of a surfactant, a high temperature reaction can make the product morphology and size very uniform, and thus the hot-injection method is widely used in the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs. Kovalenko et al. successfully prepared CsPbX3 NCs for the first time using the hot-injection method.71 The specific process is as follows (Fig. 11): the PbX2 precursor was first dissolved in a three-necked flask containing octadecene, oleic acid and oleylamine. Cesium oleate was then poured into the flask at a high temperature. After a few seconds, the reaction system was quickly cooled to room temperature using an ice bath, and finally CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs were obtained. The size of the CsPbX3 NCs can be most conveniently tuned in the range of 4–15 nm by the reaction temperature (140–200 °C).71

4.2 Applications of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
The as-prepared CsPbX3 NCs have higher fluorescence quantum efficiency (up to 100%)80 and a narrower emission line width (<20 nm).81 CsPbX3 NCs are simpler to synthesize, and can be achieved at room temperature and in an air atmosphere.82 In terms of luminous color, the emission wavelength of CsPbX3 NCs can be precisely adjusted in the entire visible spectral range by simply controlling the composition of the halide, thereby achieving a wide color gamut.83 There are also negligible effects of self-absorption and fluorescence resonance energy transfer.84 Therefore, all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 NCs have great application potential in the fields of high-efficiency LEDs, lasers, photodetectors and solar cells (Fig. 12).85–89 H. B. Zeng et al. fabricated blue (CsPbCl3), green (CsPbBr3), and yellow (CsPbI3) LEDs based on CsPbX3 NCs. Among them, the green LED based on CsPbBr3 NCs has the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE = 0.12%), and the brightness is 946 cd m−2.90 In the past few years, the EQE of all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystal-based LEDs has developed rapidly, from less than 1% to 16.48%.77,91–93 The rapid improvement of the performance confirms the broad prospects of all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite NCs in the LED field.94 Perovskite NCs have size-adjustable emission and colloidal synthesis flexibility, which brings temperature-insensitive optical characteristics, and thus they have broad application prospects in lasers.77,95

In particular, CsPbX3 NCs have combined the advantages of perovskite materials and the quantum confinement effect caused by minimal particle size. M. V. Kovalenko et al. prepared whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) lasing by coating CsPbX3 NCs on silica spheres, with a threshold as low as 5 μJ cm−2 (400 nm at 100 fs) and a high modal net gain value of at least 450 ± 30 cm−1.96 H. D. Sun et al. found that CsPbBr3 NCs have excellent optical gain characteristics, and obtained low-threshold lasers in the three primary colors of red, green, and blue, which are expected to become new materials for laser emission.97–99 Although great progress has been made in the preparation and application of all-inorganic CsPbX3 NCs, there are still problems such as unclear mechanisms, poor material stability, and low device efficiency.77,100 These problems can be solved from synthetic methods, surface ligands, composite structures, etc. to obtain high stability and better photoelectric performance.89,101–103
5. Conclusions and outlook
The all-inorganic CsPbBr3 single crystal perovskite material has become a new and emerging optoelectronic material with great advantages due to its low density of trap states, long carrier transmission distance, and high stability. This paper reviewed the research progress made in the growth and application of CsPbBr3 crystals in recent years. The solution method (ITC and AVC) can flexibly adjust the solution components and precisely control the conditions to optimize the perovskite crystals and reduce the density of trap states, which can significantly improve the device performance and stability. CsPbBr3 crystals grown by the melt method (Bridgman and EDG) have the largest crystal size and better crystal quality. The CsPbBr3 single crystal film grown by the CVD method provides an important example for the development of integrated devices of halogen perovskites and multifunctional (semiconductor properties, magnetic properties, ferroelectricity, etc.) oxide perovskites. However, low-cost, high-efficiency, and controllable single crystal perovskite preparation technology still needs further development. In terms of applications, the CsPbBr3 crystal perovskite photodetector is already comparable to traditional semiconductor photodetectors in terms of responsiveness and normalized detection efficiency. However, it still needs to achieve great breakthroughs in areas such as high integration, high reliability, and ultra-fast response. It is worth mentioning that the hole carrier mobility lifetime product of the CsPbBr3 crystal has exceeded the commercial detector material CdZnTe by ten times, so it has broad application prospects in the field of high energy radiation. Although there have been no reports of perovskite solar cells based on the CsPbBr3 crystal, with continuous breakthroughs in crystal preparation technology and solar cell structure, it is expected that perovskite solar cells made with CsPbBr3 crystals can obtain excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency.
