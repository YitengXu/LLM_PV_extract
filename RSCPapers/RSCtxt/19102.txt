    , Accepted 25th August 2016First published on 14th September 2016AbstractFor several decades, the key challenge associated with thermochemical hydrogen generation has been the achievement of water splitting and catalyst regeneration at low temperatures while maintaining a reasonably high conversion efficiency over many cycles. Herein, we report low-temperature thermochemical hydrogen generation using hierarchically assembled iron oxide nanoarchitectures. Iron oxide nanoparticles conformally deposited onto a SnO2 nanowire forest allowed the splitting of water molecules and the production of hydrogen gas at temperatures of 400–800 °C, with a high specific gas-forming rate as high as ∼25000 μmol per g per cycle (250 min). More remarkably, deep-ultraviolet photoactivation enabled low-temperature (200 °C) catalyst regeneration and thereby multiple cycles of hydrogen production without any significant coalescence of the oxide nanoparticles nor substantial loss of the water-splitting efficiency. Hierarchically arranged iron oxide nanoarchitectures, in combination with photochemical catalyst regeneration, are promising for practical hydrogen generation by harvesting wasted thermal energy, even at temperatures below 500 °C.
Introduction
The majority of fossil-fuel-based energy systems present several critical shortcomings, such as hazardous pollutant generation (e.g., NOx and SOx), mass-scale carbon dioxide formation, and eventual long-term sustainability failure due to market price fluctuations and limited reserves. Therefore, incessant efforts have been made to develop renewable energy sources. In particular, hydrogen-based energy systems have drawn much attention because hydrogen can store and release large amounts of energy per unit mass while avoiding most of the aforementioned issues. Nonetheless, the predominant method for industrial-scale hydrogen production still relies on steam reforming, which cannot be considered green or renewable because of the high temperatures required (700–1000 °C) and the carbon dioxide that is inevitably generated. Recently, alternative hydrogen production processes employing essentially free energy sources, such as sunlight and waste heat, have been intensively explored.1–4 Among these methods, thermochemical water splitting offers many practical advantages, including reasonable conversion efficiency, catalytic material recyclability, and high cost-effectiveness.5
Many different types of nanostructured materials have been successfully developed, aimed at efficient energy conversion and storage systems. For instance, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires have been intensively studied for solar energy conversion, as their elongated axis contributes to effective sunlight absorption and their short radial distance to the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers.6,7 Furthermore, it was recently reported that well-organized hierarchical nano-architectures exhibit higher photocatalytic activity,8,9 and offer an exciting opportunity for bridging the gap between nanostructures and macroscopic materials by providing a platform for the integration of nanostructures on a larger and more manageable scale.10,11 Particularly, 3-dimensionally organized nanostructures for supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries have been actively researched, as anisotropic nanotopography and core–shell nanocomposites can provide very large effective surface areas without the undesirable coalescence of the reactive nanostructures, even at elevated temperatures.12–14 However, the literature contains relatively few reports on 3D nanostructure scaffold-based catalysts with improved chemical reactivity and thermal stability, which could be beneficial for promoting unconventional chemical conversion processes by modulating their kinetic parameters.
Herein, we report low-temperature hydrogen production assisted by an iron oxide nanoforest catalyst and deep-ultraviolet (DUV)-based catalyst regeneration. The hierarchically arranged catalyst was prepared by loading iron oxide nanoparticles onto a tin oxide (SnO2) nanowire forest on a microporous nickel scaffold. The effect of these iron oxide nanostructures on the thermochemical water splitting was investigated by examining the efficiency of hydrogen generation in the temperature range between 400 and 800 °C, and low-temperature catalyst reactivation was attempted via DUV photoactivation for repeatable hydrogen production. Both physicochemical analyses and theoretical modelling were conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism for efficient water splitting and oxygen vacancy regeneration over multiple cycles.
Experimental
Preparation of bare and nanoforest-grown membranes
Nickel foams with 3D micropores (Alantum, 150–200 μm pore size, 2.54 cm diameter, 2.0 mm thickness, and 99.9% nickel purity) were used as the catalyst support to grow nanowires by CVD. The nickel foams were soaked in acetone for 3 min for ultrasonic cleaning and then soaked in a solution of gold nanoparticles (20 nm diameter) as the catalyst for nanowire growth. The nickel foams covered by gold nanoparticles and the SnO source material (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) were subsequently placed in the substrate zone and the source zone of a CVD chamber, respectively. A mixture of Ar and O2 gases (98 and 2 sccm, respectively) was then flowed for ∼60 min to grow SnO2 nanowires while the temperatures of the source zone and substrate zone were maintained at 850 and 700 °C, respectively. The obtained SnO2 nanowires had diameters of ∼60 nm and lengths of 5–10 μm.
Iron oxide nanoparticle coating on nanoforest-grown 3D microporous membrane scaffolds
Bare and SnO2 nanowire-grown nickel foams were used as basal substrates for an iron oxide nanoparticle coating. A two-step dip-dry method was used to deposit iron oxide nanoparticles onto various substrates. All substrates were treated with atmospheric plasma (100 W and 40 sccm) for 10 min to activate their surface. An aqueous solution containing 0.1 M FeCl3 and 0.2 M FeCl2 was prepared. The plasma-treated clean substrates were dipped into this mixed iron salt solution for 5 h under ambient conditions. Afterward, the substrates were removed from the solution and fully dried in air. The substrates were subsequently dipped in an aqueous ammonia solution (28%) at 60 °C for 5 min. Finally, the substrates were removed from the ammonia water solution, thoroughly rinsed with deionized (DI) water and ethanol three times, and dried under ambient conditions.
Measurement of hydrogen generation
A mixture of a carrier gas (He) and water vapour at a flow rate of ∼300 cm3 min−1 (He 200 sccm and H2O vapour 100 sccm) was injected into the reaction chamber, inside of which a stack of 10 disk-shaped nickel foams coated with iron oxide nanoparticles had been placed. The designated temperature was maintained by using a thermostat furnace. The rate of hydrogen gas evolution was analysed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N); the temperature of the reactor chamber was scanned from 400 to 800 °C at intervals of 100 °C. Note that standard H2 gases (0.02, 1.03, and 3.12%) were used to obtain calibration curves for accurate H2 measurement. The catalyst reactivation was performed using the DUV irradiation system at ∼60% of the peak hydrogen evolution rate. Ten iron oxide-loaded nickel foams, removed from the furnace, were heated on a hot plate (200 °C) while each side of the foams was exposed to the DUV light at a distance of 1 cm from a low-pressure mercury lamp (∼10 mW cm−2, 254 and 185 nm) for 1 hour. All the regeneration experiments were performed inside the oxygen-filled glovebox. After this, the reactivated nickel foams were immediately placed in the furnace and the hydrogen generation experiment was performed. The same procedure was carried out for the multi-cycle hydrogen generation.
Model system
Fe3O4 is well known to have mixed valence states; octahedral sites (Feoct) are occupied by both 2+ and 3+ cations, whereas tetrahedral sites (Fetet) are occupied only by 3+ cations. The initial magnetic moments were used for the high-spin ferrimagnetic structure on the rhombohedral primitive unit cell (Fe6O8), where a positive spin was set for Feoct and a negative spin was set for Fetet (Fig. S4A†). This scheme displayed excellent accuracy in accordance with the experimental observations.15–17 Here, we transformed the rhombohedral primitive unit cell to a cubic unit cell to conveniently reveal the (001) surface. The lattice parameter of the cubic Fe3O4 unit cell was 8.451 Å, in good agreement with the experimental value (8.390 Å) (Fig. S4B†).18 A slab of the (001) surface was modelled with a  unit cell comprising 24 Fe atoms (i.e., 16 Feoct and 8 Fetet atoms) and 32 O atoms, with a vacuum slab of 20 Å (Fig. 3A). To eliminate the z-direction dipole moment and satisfy the elemental stoichiometry, a Fetet atom was removed from each of the top and bottom layers. The lowest atomic layer was fixed. To construct a vacancy system, 4-fold oxygen (O4f) and 3-fold oxygen (O3f) were removed from the top layer of the (001) surface slab (Fig. S4C†). Six possible sites (i.e., four O4f and two O3f) for hydrogen adsorption were confirmed on the (001) surface. The adsorbed hydrogen (Had) was assumed to diffuse on the (001) surface,15,17 and the HER occurred when two Had were sufficiently close to react. To check the coverage effect on the vacancy formation and HER performance, we investigated five systems—‘2Had’, ‘3Had + OHad’, ‘4Had’, ‘4Had + 2OHad’, and ‘2Had + 2OHad’—as shown in Fig. 3C. ‘2Had’ and ‘4Had’ are the systems for VO + H2O and VO + 2H2O, respectively, where the OH group(s) dissociated from H2O were adsorbed onto oxygen vacancies and the remainder of the H atom(s) were adsorbed onto O4f and O3f. Those two systems represent the early stages of the HER, where oxygen vacancies exist predominantly. ‘3Had + OHad’ and ‘4Had + 2OHad’ are the systems for VO + 2H2O and VO + 3H2O, respectively, where additional H2O(s) are dissociatively adsorbed onto the ‘2Had’ system, resulting in one or two adsorbed OHad group(s) on the Fetet site(s). Those two systems represent the state when all oxygen vacancies are filled and additional H2O molecules start to adsorb onto Fetet. Note that adsorption energies of OHad on Fetet, which were calculated to be less than −3.84 eV (not shown), indicate that OHad will be minimally desorbed during heating. Finally, ‘2Had + 2OHad’ represents the system where two Had atoms are desorbed from the ‘4Had + 2OHad’ system. This system was constructed to investigate the latent vacancy regeneration in the HER after a certain period of time.
Simulation method
DFT calculations were carried out using Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP).19 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)20,21 was employed as the exchange–correlation potential with norm-conserving pseudopotentials.22 The Hubbard U parameter (UFe-3d = 3.7 eV) was applied to localize the d-Fe orbitals and was obtained as reported by Santos-Carballal et al.16 To include the van der Waals interactions between the adsorbates and the Fe3O4 surface, the Tkatchenko–Scheffler method for DFT-D correction was also applied when the desorption energy was estimated.23 All simulations were performed by spin-polarized calculations with a cutoff of 900 eV. The rhombohedral primitive unit cell (Fe6O8) was optimized using a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 7 × 7 × 7 k-points, whereas the surface system was optimized with gamma points.24 The atomic charges were obtained by the Mulliken population analysis method.25,26
Energy calculation
The formation energy of the oxygen vacancies was estimated by the equation ΔEvac.f = Etotvac. − Etotperfect + μO + qEvac.F(1)where Etotvac. is the total energy of the system with oxygen vacancies, Etotperfectis the total energy of the system without oxygen vacancies, μO is the chemical potential of oxygen, q is the charge state of the oxygen vacancies, and Evac.F is the Fermi energy of the system with oxygen vacancies. Parameter μO in eqn (1) was estimated via, where  was obtained from isolated oxygen gas in a sufficiently large supercell. In addition, the desorption energy of two Had atoms was calculated using the equation (2)where the total energy of two Had adsorbed onto the surface is represented by , that of a surface without two Had is represented by Etotsurf., and that of hydrogen gas is represented by .
Results and discussion
Iron oxide was one of the first metal oxide materials utilized for thermochemical water splitting, as reported by Nakamura et al.27 Since then, many research groups have investigated various metal oxide materials, including iron oxides,28–31 cerium oxides,32–34 and zinc oxides.35,36 Metal-oxide-based thermochemical water splitting can be simplified as two separate processes: vaporized water molecules reacting with oxygen vacancies that exist in the metal oxide materials, releasing hydrogen gas, and the generation of oxygen vacancies, typically at very high temperatures (>1000 °C). The key issue associated with thermochemical hydrogen generation is that the steps of hydrogen evolution and vacancy regeneration require very high temperatures of 400–2500 and 800–4000 °C, respectively.37 Moreover, metal oxide materials, typically used in the form of microscale powders, easily aggregate into larger particles during such high-temperature processes, which severely deteriorates the recyclability of the oxide powder by reducing its effective surface area. In this study, thermochemical hydrogen production proceeds in two steps (Fig. 1): (i) hydrogen generation, which is induced by heating the iron-oxide-nanoparticle-loaded SnO2 nanoforest (400–800 °C) and (ii) an oxygen vacancy regeneration process, during which the oxide nanostructures are exposed to DUV light (254/185 nm) while being heated at 200 °C (Fig. 1).

For the hierarchically arranged 3D catalyst architecture, a vertical SnO2 nanowire forest (nanoforest) was densely grown via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) onto the surface of microporous nickel foam. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images show the bare and nanoforest-modified microporous membranes (Fig. 2A). The bare coin-shaped nickel foam (d ∼ 2.5 mm) comprises a 3D wireframe-like foam with a relatively flat surface (∼100 μm width), and the nanoforest-modified substrate shows densely grown SnO2 nanowires with an average diameter of 60 nm and a typical length of 5–10 μm. Note that the densely grown nanoforest could be beneficial not only for increasing the surface area but also for preventing nanoparticle aggregation at high temperatures (vide infra). For the oxide catalyst loading, iron oxide nanoparticles were deposited via a two-step dip-coating method. Interestingly, no change in the structural integrity of the basal 3D nanoforest scaffold was observed, even after the in situ deposition of iron oxide nanoparticles. Notably, this simple co-precipitation method enables the conformal deposition of iron oxide nanomaterials on the nanoforest surface via solution penetration through micropores (Fig. S1†). Energy-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data indicate that the resultant iron oxide nanoparticle coating is a mixture of maghemite and magnetite (see the ESI for the detailed characterization of the iron oxide nanoparticles in Fig. S2 and S4†).

The results of H2 evolution over time and at different temperatures using nanoparticles coated on nickel foam with and without SnO2 nanoforest structures are presented in Fig. 2. The experimental setup used for the thermochemical water splitting in this study is depicted in Fig. S5A.† Briefly, a mixture of carrier gas (helium, 200 cm3 min−1) and reactant vapour (water, 100 cm3 min−1) was introduced into a reaction chamber containing a stack of 10 iron-oxide-coated nanoforest-grown nickel membranes inside a temperature-controlled tube furnace; the outlet from the chamber was connected to a gas chromatograph to monitor the time-lapse hydrogen generation. While the specific rate of hydrogen production rapidly increased, quickly reaching a maximum at approximately 30 min, the whole process of hydrogen formation lasted longer than 250 min, with the gas evolution rate gradually decreasing (Fig. 2B). After integration over the entire gas evolution time, the total amount of hydrogen gas per iron oxide nanoparticle mass was calculated to be ∼2.5 × 104 μmol g−1. Notably, this value is larger than those achieved with other iron-oxide-based thermochemical hydrogen systems, which mostly employ metal oxide powders29,38,39 (see Table S1†). We infer that the high yield of hydrogen generation in our system is enabled by iron oxide nanoparticles, which were uniformly deposited over the microporous nickel foam scaffold, modified with CVD-processed SnO2 nanowire forest. Such hierarchically arranged catalyst nanostructures should provide microscale porosity favourable for fast reaction with water vapour and gas exchange, and increase the effective catalytic areas with improved diffusion through very thin oxide nanoparticle layer coated on the nanoforest (Fig. S3†).40–42 We further confirmed this nanoforest effect by comparing the total specific amount of hydrogen produced using nanoparticle-deposited nickel membranes with and without the nanoforest structure. Furthermore, the maximum rate of hydrogen evolution was plotted as a function of the temperature to address the nanoforest effect on the water-splitting reaction (Fig. 2C and S5†). While the maximum rate of hydrogen production with the bare scaffold increased exponentially from 6.94 to 108.87 μmol min−1 g−1, the corresponding rate in the case of the nanoforest-grown scaffold increased much more steeply, from 9.02 to 172.16 μmol min−1 g−1, as the temperature was increased from 400 to 800 °C. This result is consistent with the lower activation energy for the water vacancy reaction using the nanoforest-grown membrane (44.6 kJ mol−1) than for the reaction using the bare scaffold (56.1 kJ mol−1) (Fig. S5D†). These results are attributed to more efficient water vapour diffusion into the vacancy-containing oxide nanoparticles deposited onto the nanoforest-modified microporous scaffold. Remarkably, the extent of nanoparticle aggregation during hydrogen production at high temperatures was much less pronounced on the nanoforest-grown scaffold than on the bare one, as indicated by the FE-SEM images obtained before and after water splitting at 800 °C (Fig. S6†). Therefore, the underlying thin nanowire forest is beneficial for preserving the iron oxide nanoparticles, with marginal aggregation during high-temperature hydrogen formation and catalyst regeneration.
For repeatable hydrogen generation, well-controlled oxygen vacancy regeneration is needed without a significant loss in hydrogen forming efficiency. The conventional metal oxide-based thermochemical cycles require a separate step for oxygen vacancy regeneration using very high thermal energy (>1000 °C), which is typically provided by either direct heating43–45 or concentration of sunlight.46 The metal oxide particles often undergo coalescence during this process, leading to a substantial reduction in the active surface area. In this study, we introduced the DUV-assisted vacancy regeneration at a very low temperature (200 °C) to replace this conventional high-temperature regeneration process. The iron oxide nanoparticles on nickel foams, after being used for thermal hydrogen generation, were irradiated with DUV light at a temperature of 200 °C for 1 hour. Subsequently, the reactivated iron oxide catalyst scaffolds were reloaded into the furnace for thermal hydrogen generation. The same procedure was repeated for the multiple cycle experiments (Fig. 3A). Although the original maximum rate of hydrogen generation was not fully recovered after the DUV-assisted low-temperature reactivation, hydrogen gas could be stably generated at a satisfactorily high rate (∼90 μmol min−1 g−1 at 800 °C) for multiple cycles. We believe that the low-temperature thermochemical reduction enables the high overall efficiency and improves the multicycle stability for hydrogen production compared to the conventional high-temperature reduction methods. The main mechanism for the hydrogen regeneration is possibly an increase in oxygen vacancies, donor-like traps, in the surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles upon DUV-assisted low-temperature reactivation.47–50 The oxygen vacancies (VO) or Fe interstitials generated by the irradiation of DUV light can increase the number of available charge carriers. UV exposure can also induce singly and doubly ionized oxygen vacancies ( and , respectively), which result in an increase of the concentrations of free electrons and interstitial O atoms in the iron oxide nanoparticles.

XPS analysis was performed in the spectral region that includes the Fe 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks to investigate how DUV photoactivation affects the oxidation state of the metal oxide nanoparticles during the reactivation step.51Fig. 3B and Table S2† clearly show that upon DUV-assisted catalyst regeneration, the peak intensity in the Fe2+ region substantially increases, indicating that the iron oxide nanoparticles are easily reduced at such a low temperature (200 °C) with the assistance of a low-power (28 mW cm−2) DUV light source. Similarly, the XPS profile in the region of the O 1s peak was deconvoluted into four different contributions: lattice O2− (M–O–M), lattice OH (OH–L), adsorbed OH (OHad), and H2O. Fig. 3C shows that the ratio of OHad to OH–L increased upon DUV irradiation, which corresponds to an increase in the oxygen-deficient phase in the iron oxide nanoparticles. Therefore, the XPS results confirm that DUV photoactivation promotes iron metal reduction via oxygen removal in the iron oxide nanoparticle coating at low temperatures, which facilitates the continuous production of hydrogen without any significant activity loss in the iron oxide catalyst for repeated thermochemical cycles.
We performed theoretical calculations to explain the overall behavior of hydrogen formation over time, and the possible mechanisms of the low-temperature oxygen formation, and the DUV-assisted vacancy regeneration. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) methods were employed to theoretically estimate the energetics related to oxygen vacancy (VO) formation and hydrogen desorption in the nanoscale iron oxide film, under the assumption that all the chemical processes occur on the Fe3O4 (001) surface (Fig. 4A).47 Based on atomic charge analysis, the total atomic charge of the iron atoms is reduced by 0.61–0.68 e on the formation of one VO on the iron oxide surface. This calculation is consistent with the XPS results. The energy of formation of VO in the top layer of the iron oxide surface was estimated to be 2.111–2.351 eV, which is lower than that in the bulk state (2.927 eV), as summarized in Table S3.† Additionally, the formation of  or  (i.e., +1 or +2 charged oxygen vacancies, respectively), is more favorable than the formation of neutral vacancies because of the negative Fermi energy on the defective surface. These results imply that the nanometer-thick iron oxide coating allows a large number of charged vacancies to be generated. This may explain why hydrogen evolution can occur at relatively low temperatures, even below 1000 °C. This may also explain why donor-like VO, , or  can be generated at a low temperature (200 °C) by DUV irradiation (from a low-pressure mercury lamp, 4.88–6.70 eV), when iron oxide nanostructures are used as an active catalyst. To investigate the effect of adsorbates on the energy of formation of oxygen vacancies, various surface models were constructed as shown in Fig. 4C (see Model system in Methods for details). Note that dissociative adsorption of H2O occurs preferentially at the vacancy sites on the iron oxide surface,15,52 which leads to the vacancy getting filled and the adsorption of two hydrogen atoms (Had). H2O(g) + VO → 2Had(3)

(B) Coverage-dependent vacancy formation energy (ΔEf(VO), , and ), desorption energy of Had pairs (ΔEde(I), ΔEde(II)), and Fermi energy of the vacancy system (Evac.F). (C) Top layers of optimized systems before and after adsorption of H2O and after extra desorption of H2. The constrained atomic layer is coloured orange. The purple circles indicate removed Fetet atoms (VFetet), and the blue dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonding (HB). 
Upon the generation of Had, the energy of vacancy formation is increased with the elevation of the Fermi energy of vacancy system (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the early stages of the reaction, the regeneration of neutral as well as charged vacancies becomes more difficult when the coverage of Had is increased (i.e., in ‘2Had’ and ‘4Had’ systems). This may explain the gradual decrease in the rate of hydrogen evolution after the initial burst of hydrogen production (Fig. 3A, 25–50 min). As the reactions progress, OHad species are formed on Fetetvia additional dissociative adsorption of H2O52 after most of the vacancy sites are filled. Note that OHad species would only be minimally desorbed during the reaction because it has a high energy of adsorption (less than −3.84 eV). Interestingly, our DFT calculations demonstrate that the formation of OHad induces a decrease in the energy of formation of the charged vacancies by lowering the corresponding Fermi energy (Fig. 4B). In particular, the ‘2Had + 2OHad’ state, which forms after two Had are desorbed from the ‘4Had + 2OHad’ state, shows a rapid decrease in the formation of charged vacancies (Fig. 4C). By comparing the energies of formation of vacancies in the ‘2Had + 2OHad’ and ‘2Had’ states, we concluded that increasing the number of OHad on Fetet contributes to the decrease of the Fermi energy and, thereby, to the enhanced regeneration of oxygen vacancies, finally leading to more efficient hydrogen evolution. This result may explain why the iron oxide nanoparticle-based catalyst permits such a high amount of total hydrogen formation, as compared with the conventional thermochemical cycling systems, employing bulk metal oxide powers (Table S1†).
It is well known that two Had combine at high temperatures, resulting in hydrogen evolution via a Tafel process.53,54 This process occurs as shown in the following reaction,54 when a pair of Had with low desorption energies is situated adjacent to each other on the catalyst surface. Had + Had → H2(g)(4)
Therefore, the desorption energies of two Had adjacent to each other were examined with aforementioned surface models to confirm the dependence of the rate of hydrogen evolution on the surface coverage (Fig. 4C). Notably, two pair types exist for the ‘2Had’ state, where pair type I is more energetically favored for the HER than pair type II with its lower desorption energy. A similar situation exists for the ‘3Had + OHad’ and ‘4Had’ states. For the ‘4Had’ state in particular, the desorption energies of pairs of both the types I and II increase because of additional interactions with Had. This may explain the rapid decrease in the rate of hydrogen evolution with increase in Had coverage (i.e., around 30 min in Fig. 3A). As mentioned earlier, OHad species are generated during the reaction. With the addition of two OHad on Fetet to the ‘4Had’ state, the desorption energy of pair type I in the ‘4Had + 2OHad’ state is substantially increased because of hydrogen bonding between OHad on Fetet and Had. On the other hand, the desorption energy in pair type II is reduced because of the weakened interaction between Had and the catalyst surface. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the presence of OHad on Fetet promotes the formation of charged vacancies, and simultaneously inhibits hydrogen desorption via hydrogen bonding. Note that the desorption energies of pair type I and II in the ‘4Had + 2OHad’ system and Evac.f of the ‘2Had + 2OHad’ system are similar (Fig. 4b). Thus, the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) eventually reaches an asymptotic value after some time (i.e., after 200 min in Fig. 2b) with regeneration of VO.
Conclusions
In summary, nanometre-thick iron-oxide-coated nanoforest-decorated scaffolds and DUV-assisted reactivation of the metal oxide catalyst were developed for low-temperature thermochemical water splitting with a satisfactory rate of hydrogen production. Compared to conventional oxide-powder-packed systems, the hierarchical nanostructures, composed of a one-dimensional nanowire forest on a 3D microporous membrane, maximize the surface-to-volume ratio of the conformally deposited iron oxide nanoparticles and the efficiency of the reaction between the water vapour and the metal oxide for hydrogen production while minimizing the undesired coarsening of the metal oxide nanoparticles during the high-temperature reaction and regeneration processes. Furthermore, steady hydrogen production with satisfactory efficiency was achieved over multiple cycles through the DUV-assisted low-temperature reactivation of the metal oxide nanomaterial. Our results suggest that the solution-processed iron oxide nanoparticle coating on nanoforest-modified microporous scaffolds, in combination with the low-temperature DUV photoactivation of the oxide catalysts, can be used for low-temperature metal-oxide-based thermochemical hydrogen generation by harvesting waste thermal energy.
