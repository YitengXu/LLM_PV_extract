    , Accepted 14th January 2019First published on 17th January 2019AbstractElectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to multi-carbon products such as ethylene, ethanol and n-propanol offers a promising path for utilization of excessive CO2 and energy storage. Oxide-derived Cu electrodes are among the best electrocatalysts for the selective formation of ethylene and ethanol. However, a large fraction of the faradaic current still goes to hydrogen evolution, even at optimal conditions (electrolyte, potential, etc.). Here we employ the concept of sequential catalysis using judiciously designed CuAu bimetallic catalysts through galvanic exchange between Au3+ and Cu2O nanowires. By controlling the concentration of the Au3+ precursor and the exchange time, Au nanoparticles were evenly dispersed onto the Cu2O nanowires. The optimized oxide-derived CuAu catalyst showed remarkable improvement towards the formation of ethylene, ethanol and n-propanol, in terms of faradaic efficiency and current density. Our analysis of the electrochemical formation of carbon monoxide, ethylene and hydrogen suggests that the presence of Au, an electrocatalyst for CO2-to-CO conversion, helps enhance *CO-coverage on Cu, thus promoting the production of multi-carbon products and suppressing hydrogen formation on the CuAu catalyst. We propose promising strategies for designing electrochemical systems, which would enable the selective and scalable reduction of CO2 to ethylene and ethanol.
Introduction
Natural photosynthesis, a process where carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are converted to carbohydrates in plants using sunlight, provides the ultimate energy source for human beings. Mimicking nature, artificial photosynthesis offers a promising technology to store solar energy in chemical bonds and to reduce excessive CO2 in the atmosphere.1–3 One efficient approach for this purpose is to integrate photovoltaics with an electrolyzer, where CO2 is electrochemically reduced to chemical feedstock such as carbon monoxide using solar energy to drive the thermodynamically uphill process.4 For example, using efficient and selective CuSn based electrocatalysts, our group has recently achieved an energetic solar-to-CO efficiency of 13.4% employing triple-junction III–IV photovoltaics as the electric power source.5
One of the most attractive aspects of electrochemical CO2 reduction is the possibility of directly forming C1–C3 (even up to C5) products.6–8 Among all metal electrodes, copper (Cu) is a unique electrocatalyst that is able to reduce CO2 with substantial yields to hydrocarbons and alcohols.9,10 This is believed to be due to its optimal binding of CO, a key intermediate for the formation of reduction products with >2e− transfer.11 Among all hydrocarbons and oxygenates, multi-carbon products such as ethylene (C2H4), ethanol (C2H5OH) and n-propanol (C3H7OH) have much higher commercial value and/or energy density than their C1 counterparts such as CH4 and CH3OH.12 However, the selectivity of polycrystalline Cu towards the formation of multi-carbon products (C2+ products vs. C1 products) is poor.6 For example, 30.1% of ethylene and 29.4% of methane, corresponding to a mixture of C2H4 and CH4 were formed on polycrystalline Cu electrode in 0.1 M KHCO3 at an applied current density of −5 mA cm−2.10
Extensive research efforts have been undertaken in tuning the selectivity of Cu towards the formation of multi-carbon products. Earlier works by the groups of Hori and Koper established that Cu (100) single crystals with stepped sites showed selectivity preference towards the formation of ethylene.13–16 Engineering these features into Cu cubic nanoparticles proved effective in improving the faradaic efficiency of ethylene and suppressing the formation of methane.17–20 Recently, oxide-derived Cu catalysts have been studied intensively for promoting the formation of ethylene, ethanol and even of n-propanol.8,21–26 Defects such as grain boundaries within oxide-derived catalysts were proposed to be effective in binding reaction intermediates such as CO, thus enabling C–C coupling between two C1 intermediates.27,28 Other factors such as a high local pH,29 Cu+ species,23 crystallite size,30 mass transport25 and applied potential31 were investigated to better understand the mechanism of operation for oxide-derived Cu catalysts.
Density functional theory (DFT) has also proved to be helpful in elucidating the reaction pathways towards the formation of multi-carbon products.32 Using DFT computations, Koper and co-workers proposed that ethylene formation occurs via the dimerization of adsorbed CO, which forms a *C2O2− dimer intermediate upon one-electron reduction.33 This is consistent with the experimental observation that the formation of ethylene is pH-independent on an SHE (standard hydrogen electrode) scale on the Cu (100) surface.15 Very recently, they managed to probe the protonated dimer *OCCHO using operando IR spectroscopy, delivering the first spectroscopic evidence of a C2 intermediate during CO2 reduction.34 Moreover, Yeo and co-workers studied the formation of ethylene on different Cu single crystals and confirmed that it starts only after sufficient coverage of *CO is achieved.35 These findings emphasize the importance of achieving a high *CO coverage to boost the formation of multi-carbon products.
The above-mentioned work inspired us to conceive new strategies to improve the selectivity of oxide-derived Cu electrodes towards ethylene formation. By scrutinizing the performance of oxide-derived Cu catalysts reported by different groups, we found that a relatively large fraction of the faradaic current (at least 20%) is still consumed by forming hydrogen via the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. This indicates that the ratio of *CO-coverage vs. *H-coverage is not optimal, i.e. the *H-coverage is larger than that needed to accomplish the formation of C2 products on oxide-derived Cu catalysts. We reason that introducing a co-catalyst promoting the reduction of CO2 to CO would increase the *CO-coverage on the oxide-derived Cu catalysts, thus improving the selectivity and efficiency of forming multi-carbon products.
Based on the above rationale, we first prepared a Cu2O electrodes covered with Au-nanoparticles via a galvanic exchange reactions. A mesoscopic nanowire structure of Cu2O was chosen to enhance the number of catalytic Cu sites. The oxide-derived bifunctional CuAu catalyst showed an improved selectivity for generating ethylene, ethanol and n-propanol, as compared with oxide-derived Cu catalyst. The current density for multi-carbon product generation also increased significantly. The importance of *CO-coverage on CuAu catalysts is elucidated by comparing the CO formation on different CuAu catalysts. We will discuss the important factors affecting the selectivity of C2+ products and provide our understanding of how to design bimetallic catalysts for enhanced selectivity of multi-carbon products.
Experimental
General
Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm, Purelab Ultra, ELGA) was used for washing and the preparation of solutions. All of the electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature in an air-conditioned room.
Preparation of Cu2O nanowires and Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O nanowires
FTO glass was etched using zinc powder (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) and 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (37%, ACS reagent, Merck) to remove the conductive coating. The resulting substrate was cut into 3 cm × 8 cm, followed by sonication in deionized water for 15 min. These substrates were dried using a compressed air stream. Cu film (99.995%) with a thickness of 1.5 μm was sputtered on the cleaned substrate using a DP 650 sputter coater (Alliance-concept). Then the sputtered film was anodized in 3 M KOH at 8 mA cm−2 for 2 min using a potentiostat (Interface 1000, Gamry) in a two-electrode configuration with Cu foil (99.99%, Goodfellow) used as the counter electrode (Fig. 1). Afterwards, the Cu(OH)2 film was annealed at 600 °C for 4 h under an Ar atmosphere (99.9999%, Carbagas) in a tube furnace (Lenton).
 Fig. 1  Schematic preparation of oxide-derived Cu and CuAu catalysts. 
Aqueous HAuCl4 (99.99%, ABCR) solutions with concentrations of 0.2 mM and 10 mM were prepared. The prepared Cu2O substrate was cut into units of 3 cm × 0.5 cm, followed by immersion in the aqueous HAuCl4 solution for galvanic replacement reaction. By varying the reaction time, we prepared Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O samples with different Au loading amount. The resulting film was rinsed with deionized water and dried using compressed air flow.
Materials characterization
The morphology of the catalysts was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Merlin). The electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) of the Cu2O derived Cu and CuAu catalysts were estimated from double layer capacitance measurements via cyclic voltammetry (Interface 1000, Gamry) at different scan rates of 20 to 150 mV s−1 in Ar-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (99.99% metal base, Sigma Aldrich).
Electrochemical experiments
The electrochemical CO2 reduction was performed in an H-type gas-tight electrolytic cell, with the cathodic and anodic compartments separated an anion-exchange membrane (Fumasep FKS-50, Fumatech). A CO2-saturated aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (99.99% metal base, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the electrolyte. The volumes of the catholyte and anolyte were 10 and 6 cm3, respectively. A Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl, Pine) and a Ti foil with electrodeposited IrO2 film were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.36 The potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was checked regularly against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, Gaskatel). Unless stated otherwise, all of the potentials cited in this work are referenced against an RHE scale.
60 min potentiostatic measurements (Interface 1000, Gamry) at selected potentials were used to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the Cu and bifunctional CuAu catalysts. During the measurements, the catholyte was stirred at 1000 rpm and CO2 was flowed across both compartments (99.999%, Carbagas) at a rate of 10 mL min−1 (Bronkhorst High-Tech, F201CV, Bronkhorst). The cathodic gas stream was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, Trace ULTRA, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a pulsed discharge detector (PDD, Vici) and Shincarbon micropacked column (Restek). Helium (99.9999%, Carbagas) was used as the carrier gas and the gas products were injected into the GC every 14 min. The average faradaic efficiency of four individual injections was used as the yield for gaseous products. The liquid phase products were quantified using water suppression 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR, Avance 500 Spectrometer, Bruker). The area ratio of the products to DMSO and Phenol internal standards was compared to the calibration curve to quantify the concentration of different products.6,37 To assure the reproducibility of each experiment, three individual and fresh samples were tested independently for each potential.
Results and discussions
Materials characterization
The as-prepared Cu2O and Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O were characterized by SEM (Fig. 2). The Cu2O film consisted of intertwined nanowires with a length of a few micrometres and a diameter of a few hundred nanometres. These nanowires split into smaller Cu2O endings that were relatively smooth (Fig. 2a). After immersing Cu2O in HAuCl4 solution, the simultaneous galvanic exchange of Au3+ with Cu+ results in the formation of Au particles on the nanowire substrate via the following equation:2Au3+ + 3Cu2O + 6H+ → 2Au + 6Cu2+ + 3H2O
 Fig. 2  Morphological characterization of the Cu2O nanowires and Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O nanowires. SEM images of (a) as-prepared Cu2O nanowires and Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O nanowires with different loading amounts of Au: (b) galvanic exchange reaction in 0.2 mM HAuCl4 for 1 min and (c) galvanic exchange reaction in 10 mM HAuCl4 for 5 min. Scale bars: 500 nm. 
By changing the concentration of HAuCl4 solution and the reaction time, the loading amount and particle size of Au were systematically tuned. 1 min of galvanic exchange in 0.2 mM HAuCl4 solution led to the formation of isolated Au nanoparticles with diameters < 50 nm. These nanoparticles were evenly dispersed on the surface of the nanowires (Fig. 2b), creating a homogeneous Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O surface. Extending the concentration of the precursor solution and the galvanic exchange time resulted in a higher density of larger Au aggregates on the Cu2O nanowires (Fig. 2c).
Both the Cu2O and Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu2O were electrochemically reduced in the CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution, thus forming oxide-derived Cu and bifunctional CuAu catalysts. Unless stated otherwise, CuAu catalyst refers to the Au-nanoparticle-covered Cu originating from 1 min of galvanic exchange in 0.2 mM HAuCl4 solution. The electrochemical surface areas of Cu and CuAu were determined by double layer capacitance measurements. We derived the capacitance values of the Cu and CuAu catalysts to be 2.92 and 2.01 mF cm−2, respectively. Thus, the CuAu catalyst has a smaller roughness factor than the Cu catalyst.
Improved C–C coupling on bifunctional CuAu catalysts
The electrocatalytic abilities of the Cu and CuAu catalysts towards CO2 reduction were assessed using 60 min potentiostatic measurements over a wide range of potentials from −0.60 V to −1.15 V in a custom-built electrochemical cell. Three independent measurements were carried out for each potential to ensure the reproducibility. The average geometric current density over the course of 60-min chronoamperometry against the applied potential for the Cu and CuAu catalysts is shown in Fig. 3. The total current density on both catalysts correlated positively with the applied overpotential. From −0.6 V to −0.8 V, the total current density observed on the two catalysts was similar. However, at potentials that were more negative than −0.9 V, the total current density on CuAu catalyst became higher than the one on Cu catalyst. For example, the current density observed on CuAu at −1.05 V was 42.9 mA cm−2, which was 1.5× larger than the 28.1 mA cm−2 observed on the Cu catalyst at the same applied potential. Considering the lower roughness of the CuAu compared to that of the Cu catalyst, the different J–V trends of Cu and CuAu correspond to the difference in their catalytic performance.

Each data point represents the average of three independent measurements and the error bar represents the standard deviations of these measurements. 
The cathodic gas stream was periodically analyzed by gas chromatography at 2 min, 16 min, 30 min, 44 min and 58 min of the chronoamperometry. The liquid products were quantified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) after electrolysis. 4 gaseous products (H2, CO, CH4, and C2H4) and 5 liquid products (HCOO−, CH3COO−, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, and n-C3H7OH) were detected (Tables 1 and 2). The faradaic efficiencies for forming alkenes and alcohols on the Cu and CuAu catalysts are shown in Fig. 4.

We observed that the selectivity towards C2+ alkene and alcohols on CuAu showed substantial improvement at a lower overpotential. At −0.90 V, the faradaic efficiency of the multi-carbon products nearly doubled from 20% to 38%. The faradaic efficiencies of producing C2+ alkene and alcohols on Cu and CuAu catalysts both followed a parabolic trend, peaking at around −1.05 V vs. RHE. For the Cu catalyst, the faradaic efficiencies of ethylene and ethanol were 30–33% and 13–16%, respectively, with the total faradaic efficiency of multi-carbon alkene and alcohols of 55% at −1.00 V and −1.05 V. At the same time, the faradaic efficiency of CH4 was suppressed to <3% (Table 1). These observations are consistent with previous reports using other oxide-derived Cu catalysts.21–23,38 Interestingly, the faradaic efficiencies of ethylene and ethanol increased to 39% and 23%, respectively, on the CuAu catalyst at −1.05 V and the total faradaic efficiency of C2+ alkene and alcohols approached ∼70%. Thus, the faradaic efficiency of multi-carbon products improved by nearly 30% on the CuAu catalyst. Considering the 1.5× increase in geometric current density on the CuAu catalyst (Fig. 3), we managed to get a ∼2× increase in the partial current density of multi-carbon products on the CuAu catalyst (∼30 mA cm−2) compared with that of the Cu catalyst (∼15 mA cm−2). This ranks our bifunctional CuAu catalyst among the best catalysts for the formation of multi-carbon alkenes and alcohols.

Selectivity of electrocatalytic ethanol and ethylene formation
We assessed the selectivity of electrocatalytic ethanol (ethanol and n-propanol) and ethylene formation on our Cu and CuAu catalysts by analysing the ratio of the alcohol/ethylene yields as a function of the applied potential (Fig. 5). For Cu, the alcohol to ethylene ratio remained relatively stable, ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. This is consistent with previous studies using various Cu-based catalysts, which showed a preferred C–C coupling towards ethylene instead of alcohol.39 However, interestingly, with the CuAu the selectivity of alcohol to ethylene was dependent on the applied potential. At −0.80 V, the faradaic yield ratio of alcohol to ethylene increased from 0.5 on Cu to 1.3 on CuAu. However, the yield ratio of alcohol to ethylene on CuAu decreased at potentials that are more negative than −0.90 V (Fig. 5). The CuAu tandem catalyst and Cu2S–Cu–V (Cu with a vacancy on the surface and sulphur in the subsurface) also exhibited a similar trend, albeit with a much lower faradaic efficiency of multi-carbon products.40,41 We propose the reason behind the potential-dependent alcohol/ethylene ratio on the CuAu catalyst to be a lower coverage of *H at smaller overpotentials.41
 Fig. 5  The faradaic efficiency ratio of alcohol to ethylene as a function of applied potential on the Cu and CuAu catalysts. 
Reduced *H coverage and enhanced *CO coverage on the CuAu catalyst
The faradaic efficiencies of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ethylene and ethanol as a function of applied potential are shown in Fig. 6. A clear trend is that the faradaic efficiency of hydrogen decreased significantly on the CuAu catalyst at a lower overpotential. For example, from −0.60 V to −0.80 V, the faradaic efficiency of hydrogen was suppressed to 30% (with the other 70% accounting for carbonaceous products) on the CuAu catalyst, whereas the one on the Cu catalyst ranged from 45% to 60%. The suppressed hydrogen evolution suggests that the presence of Au assists in reducing the *H coverage at low overpotential, which indicates that more active sites are available for binding intermediates for CO2 reduction, such as CO.
 Fig. 6  The faradaic efficiencies of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ethylene and ethanol as a function of applied potential on (a) Cu and (b) CuAu (0.2 mM HAuCl4 for 1 min) catalysts. 
Low *H-coverage has also been found on other Cu-based catalysts. Bell and co-workers have studied different CuAg alloys and proposed that the microstrain caused by the presence of Ag assisted in reducing the coverage of *H.42 This proposition was corroborated by extensive surface analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. However, we note that the microstrain caused by Ag alloying was at atomic scale whereas our Au nanoparticles were in the scale of 10–50 nm. Thus, the microstrain may not have an important role in determining the low coverage of *H in our CuAu catalyst.
Recent studies on CO reduction using Cu electrodes revealed the low *H coverage in basic electrolyte caused by the low concentration of H+ at alkaline conditions.43 Here we assess whether our low *H coverage is due to an increase in local pH.44 The local pH is correlated with the consumption rate of H+, which is reflected by the partial current density of non-ionic products (the number of protons transferred equals that of electrons for non-ionic products). By multiplying the total current density and the faradaic efficiency of non-ionic products at low overpotential, we found little difference in the consumption rates of H+ on the Cu and CuAu. Thus, we believe that the local pH is not the major factor affecting *H-coverage on the CuAu catalysts.
Here we propose that the low *H-coverage is mainly due to the increased coverage of *CO on Cu sites. It is widely believed that hydrogen evolution is a kinetically more facile reaction dominating the reduction of CO2.45 Moreover, *CO and *H compete with each other for active sites during CO2 reduction.35 On the Cu catalyst at a relatively low overpotential, i.e. at −0.60 V, the reduction of CO2 to CO is limited by insufficient driving potential, as indicated by the high faradaic efficiency of H2. The coverage of *CO on the Cu catalyst is not comparable with the *H-coverage, the production of which requires less electrochemical driving force.6 With the introduction of Au nanoparticles in the bifunctional Cu/Au catalyst, the production of CO is accelerated.46,47 This will increase the *CO coverage on Cu, reducing the number of available sites for *H adsorption.35 Thus, on the CuAu bifunctional catalyst the *H coverage is reduced, suppressing the formation of hydrogen.
This proposition is further supported by two phenomena: (1) Au catalyst has a better catalytic ability towards the formation of CO compared with that of Cu catalyst, as shown in previous reports.46,47 Furthermore, the weaker CO adsorption on Au compared to that on Cu facilitates the release of CO.11 (2) The faradaic efficiency of the CO formation observed on CuAu is slightly higher than that on Cu, indicating that more CO is produced. Note also that the actual increase of CO production should be higher since some CO will be consumed in the formation of multi-carbon products. To further prove our proposition, we analysed CO formation on an Au-enriched CuAu catalyst, prepared by galvanic exchange reaction in 10 mM HAuCl4 solution for 5 min. As shown in Fig. 7, a very high faradaic efficiency of CO was achieved at very low overpotential. For example, at −0.50 V, the faradaic efficiency of CO reached up to 45%, proving that the presence of Au enhances the production of CO.

Sequential catalysis on CuAu bimetallic cathodes
We infer from our study that CO2 is sequentially reduced to multi-carbon alkene and alcohols on CuAu catalyst as shown in Fig. 8. Au accelerates the reduction of CO2 to CO, which subsequently adsorbs on the Cu sites, creating a high coverage of *CO on Cu. This accelerates the rate of C–C coupling towards the formation of C2+ alkene and alcohols. At the same time, the high *CO coverage suppresses the formation of hydrogen, which is the main reaction competing with the reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons and alcohols.
 Fig. 8  Proposed mechanism of ethylene and ethanol formation on (a) Cu and (b) CuAu catalysts. 
With regards to the mechanism for the formation of multi-carbon products, several studies have shown that the formation of ethylene is pH-independent on an SHE reference scale.29,43,48 The RHE reference scale is better suited to compare pH-dependent reactions (i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction) at different pH since it compensates for the pH-dependent equilibrium potential.49 Thus, if one reaction is pH-dependent on an RHE scale but pH-independent on a fixed scale (i.e. SHE), the rate-determining step of the reaction involves no proton transfer. With this in mind, Koper and co-workers have proposed that the dimerization of CO, accompanied by the transfer of one electron, is the key step in the formation of C–C bonds. The adsorbed *CO tends to dimerize once the coverage of *CO reaches a certain level and upon one electron reduction forms the adsorbed *CO dimer anion *C2O2−. This dimer will be further protonated and reduced to form *C2H4O.35 This is the point where the formation of ethylene and ethanol starts to diverge. Since the formation of ethylene has a lower energy barrier than that of ethanol, it is reasonable that ethylene is the preferred C2 product on the Cu catalyst.33
Ideal catalysts for the formation of multi-carbon products should deliver a faradaic efficiency close to 100% for C2+ products. This requires suppressed formation of both C1 products and hydrogen. Previous investigations on oxide-derived Cu catalyst have shown that the suppression of C1 products can be achieved on these catalysts by selecting appropriate applied potentials.31,50 However, the suppression of hydrogen evolution remains a great challenge. Here, by accelerating the reduction of CO2 to CO using Au, we managed to improve the faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2+ alkene and alcohols beyond the limit of pure oxide-derived Cu catalyst. The employment of oxide-derived Cu nanowires as the substrate also helps suppress the formation of CH4.
Recently, a three-phasic flow cell based on a gas diffusion electrode was developed for CO2 reduction.51 With this design, the reaction could take place in alkaline electrolyte at the gas–liquid–electrode interface. High alkaline electrolyte enables the suppression of hydrogen, and gas diffuse layer warrants the achievement of scalable current densities.52 However, the drawback of this approach, i.e. the consumption of KOH, has not been fully addressed yet. Nevertheless, the flow cell infrastructure, together with the rational design of catalysts, is a promising future direction for efficient and scalable systems for artificial photosynthesis.
Another topic of our interest is to study the selectivity between two major C2 products, ethylene and ethanol, using Cu–X (Au, Ag, Zn) bimetallic systems. Recently, CuAg catalysts were reported to be selective towards the formation of ethanol and a high ratio of ethanol/ethylene was achieved.53 Interestingly, different CuAg systems showed different performances: Lee et al. reported an enhanced selectivity for ethanol when using electrodeposited CuAg, whereas Bell and co-workers found the improved selectivity for oxygenates, especially acetate.42,53 Elucidating the underlying reasons for the similarities and differences between different Cu–X bimetallic (X = Au, Ag, Zn) will in turn help to design selective catalysts for the formation of different multi-carbon products in CO2 reduction and achieve tunable selectivity between ethylene and ethanol. Ethylene is by far the preferred product over ethanol. Apart from being a key chemical feedstock its great advantage is that it evolves spontaneously as a gas from the electrolyte while ethanol needs to be separated from solution at high cost and in energy consuming processes.
Conclusions
In this work, we conceived a bifunctional oxide-derived CuAu catalyst operating in sequential fashion to accomplish the selective reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon alkene and alcohols. This catalyst showed improved selectivity towards the formation of ethylene, ethanol and n-propanol, with a faradaic efficiency of 70% for these products. The partial current density of ethylene and alcohol formation nearly doubled compared to that for oxide-derived Cu, one of the best catalysts for the formation of multi-carbon products. The introduction of Au into oxide-derived Cu catalyst enables an improved coverage of *CO, thus enhancing the C–C coupling process towards the formation of ethylene and ethanol while the reduced *H coverage helps suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We believe that the easily prepared and selective CuAu bimetallic provides a good example of how sequential catalysts enable enhanced selectivity towards the formation of products with high commercial value in CO2 reduction.
