    , Accepted 18th May 2012First published on 24th May 2012AbstractWe report a series of cobalt complexes with various polypyridyl ligands, where the oxidation potential is tuned from 0.17 to 0.34 V vs. ferrocene. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of the cobalt complexes were stabilized by adding electron acceptor groups on pyridyl or replacing pyridyl by pyrazole. These complexes are then used as one-electron redox mediators in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) together with polymer based cathode resulting in an excellent performance. The performance of DSSCs using the molecularly engineered cobalt redox shuttle and poly(3,4-alkylthiophenes) based cathode is better than the triiodide/iodide redox shuttle with platinized cathode. The use of high surface area poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) based nanoporous layers allows higher catalytic activity thus minimizing the electrode–electrolyte interface issues.
1. Introduction
An energy source, which is green and can counter our global warming process, is one of the main research topics in the present scenario. In this context dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are now being exploited as one of the available alternatives owing to their numerous advantages.1,2 DSSCs are composed of a mesoporous network of TiO2 nanocrystals anchored with sensitizer, and a platinized current collector sandwiched with redox electrolyte. Several groups have explored photoanode materials and sensitizers,1–4 while triiodide/iodide based redox couples with platinized cathodes have remained indispensable for almost two decades in the fabrication of efficient DSSCs. The development of new redox couples and counter electrodes is the paramount research in the process of making DSSCs the undisputed choice for a clean and cheap energy source.5,6 The counter electrode is one of the vital components, which reduces the oxidized redox mediator, generated after the dye regeneration. Since transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates exhibit insufficient electron transfer kinetics for I3− reduction, a thin layer of Platinum (Pt) is coated onto the TCO substrate (platinized cathode) and is used to catalyse the cathodic reduction of I3− ions, i.e. redox couple regeneration.7 However both these components of DSSCs suffer from their inability in long-term reliability. The I3−/I− based electrolyte is corrosive, yellow in color and dissipative towards light absorption, while platinized cathode is subject to corrosion, sensitive to side products formation, and liable to become inactivated with ageing, apart from being uneconomical. These are major attributes which may limit the use of I3−/I− based electrolytes and Pt in some cases. This is considered as a realm of scientific potential in the DSSCs fabrication. After the seminal work on the use of cobalt electrolytes in DSSCs8 recently renewed attention has been given and polypyridyl cobalt redox complexes have been explored.9–13 The attempts to replace the I3−/I− redox shuttle by cobalt polypyridine complexes was not only limited to their low visible light absorption but also due to their higher redox potential and noncorrosive nature towards cathode. At full sun (AM 1.5 GM) the performance of cobalt complexes as redox shuttles is diffusion limited and also a faster back reaction of photo-injected electrons with the oxidized species is expected. As a matter of fact, until recently hardly any electron outer-sphere redox couples have been demonstrated in making efficient cells, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) comparable to the I3−/I− based redox couples, to complement its use. In 2010 Feldt et al. reported an increased PCE of 6.7% by employing a syngerstic D-π-A organic sensitizer (D35) in conjunction with [CoIII(bpy)3](PF6)3/[CoII(bpy)3](PF6)2 redox shuttle,13 and this was also the subject of a recent review.14 We have also demonstrated a PCE of 10% with a dye, called Y123, and [CoIII(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3/[CoII(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2 redox couple.15,16 Since the studied cobalt complexes used so far were based on simple bipyridine and phenanthroline ligands we exploited various new cobalt complexes with higher oxidation potentials (0.81 to 0.98 V vs. NHE) than [Co(bpy)3] (0.56 V vs. NHE) and [Co(phen)3] (0.62 V vs. NHE) complexes. This allows us to define the driving force required to regenerate the dye. Additionally we describe the influence of different counter ions for the cobalt complexes on the photovoltaic (PV) performance. High Voc values of up to 1000 mV were obtained due to the inherent higher positive potential as compared to the I3−/I− redox shuttle.
We have learned that the conventional platinized cathode is not optimal with these newly developed redox shuttles, so to overcome this barrier, a series of poly(3,4-alkylthiophenes) members were exploited as a cathode in DSSCs. These counter electrodes were then fine tuned with the use of various dopants for their physico–chemical properties to be used in DSSCs. Poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) [PProDOT] based DSSCs exhibit excellent results due to their ultra high surface area morphology and lack of the possibility of forming any passivation layer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. These polymer cathodes were then studied for their compatibility with the formulated noncorrosive cobalt (III/II) based redox shuttle. Herein we demonstrate efficient Pt-free and iodine-free DSSCs fabrication in conjunction with our rationally designed high molar extinction coefficient organic D-π-A sensitizer, 3-{6-{4-[bis(2′,4′-dihexyloxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino-]phenyl}-4,4-dihexyl-cyclo-penta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiphene-2-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid (labelled as Y123).15
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Redox-shuttle
The cobalt complexes as well as the structure of the organic dye used in this study are shown in Scheme 1. As reported by us, the complex 4a [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ has a standard redox potential of 0.22 V versus ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc).5 For complexes 5a and 6a bearing the same tridentate ligand as of complex 4a but with different anions such as tetracyanoborate (5a) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (6a) instead of hexafluorophosphate (4a), as expected a rather similar potential was obtained (Table 1). In spite of the similar redox potential, these complexes which were studied as the counter ion may influence the diffusion and solubility properties and therefore the device performance. Complex 4a was used as a benchmark due to its excellent device performance, and to optimize the system additional complexes were designed with slightly lower (3a) and slightly higher oxidation potentials (1a and 2a). Complex 3a is based on a 4,4′-dichloro-2,2′-bipyridine ligand17 and is easily accessible due to its commercial availability. The higher oxidation potential of complex 1a in contrast to complex 4a is attributed to the presence of one additional pyrazole, which stabilizes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the complex more than a pyridine group. This results in a higher oxidation potential by 100 mV. Additional weakly donating substituents (methyl groups) on the backbone of the ligand in complex 2a result in a slight increase of the standard potential to 0.34 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene. The ligands of complexes 1a and 2a were synthesized by a simple one step method using 2-fluoropyridine and pyrazole or 3,5-dimethylpyrazole.

2.2 Counter electrodes
The electro-polymerized films of PProDOT exhibit homogeneous nanoporous morphologies with uniform grain size. Platinum forms monocrystalline small granules, while Fig. 1(a–d) show highly porous structures. Polymer films grown in other media show mainly compact granular structures. Scheme 2 shows the structure of the monomers employed for the polymerization process. These nanoporous polymers with ultra-high surface areas are ideal candidates for electro-catalysis and are also envisioned as materials for the oxygen reduction reaction.18 The use of nanoporous polymer films will allow the post functionalization of the pore walls with the redox shuttle without forming any passivation layer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The obtained highly porous microstructure was possible due to the use of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), which not only work as a supporting electrolyte in the synthesis of polymers but also have influence to totally alter reaction pathways and product microstructures due to their hydrophobicity.19 With the proper choice of ionic liquids employed, the shape and pore size of a material can be tuned and it evolves from one form to another with varying pore diameter. With the change of anion in the RTILs, the microstructure changes from small fibril shapes to elongated fibril to sponge like morphology Fig. 1(d).

 Scheme 2  Chemical structures of the different compounds used as monomers for polymerization. 
Due to the different hydrophobicity of the surface, the contact angles for PProDOT grown in BMPyTFSI and EMIFAP are 120 and 112, respectively. The distinct morphologies obtained with the use of RTILs is due to the insertion of both cation and anion in the polymer matrix.19 During the electro-polymerization, anions are incorporated into the polymer matrix as dopants and this dictates the growth pattern (due to viscosity of medium and diffusion limitation). Polymer films synthesized in the presence of TFSI− as the anion exhibit relatively rigid fibers connected with granular shapes. The change of cation from pyridinium to imidazolium also induces large variation in the microstructure, which further supports the hypothesis of insertion of both cation and anion when RTILs are used. The TFSI− anion posseses a relatively large structure with a diffuse negative charge on a nitrogen atom due to electron withdrawing groups and results in a larger mesh size in the microstructure compared to the tetracyanoborate anions which gave more soft and smaller pores.
Conductive scanning force microscopy (CSFM) was performed to evaluate the homogeneities of current at nanoscale, this allows simultaneous measurement of topography and the variation of current on the application of an electrode bias. Fig. 2a shows the topographical image of PProDOT1, and also illustrates the highly porous structure as obtained from the scanning electron microscope. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of films was estimated on a 2.5 × 2.5 μm2 scale and under our conditions we found a RMS roughness value of 34 nm of a film with thickness of 500 nm. The mapping of the current illustrates large domains of current with a high conductance value. The dialkoxy substituents minimize the possible synthetic defects, and due their electron donating nature improving the conductivity.
 Fig. 2  CSFM images of (a) topography (b) current at a bias of 100 mV. 
The presence of a porous structure limits the uniform distribution of current and mostly induces large domains of conductance. However we assume that in spite of this charge transfer by intra polaronic islands it is also occurring at the bottom of the electrode, as the polymers grow from nucleation and growth phenomena. Due to the highly porous network higher resolution images were not possible with CSFM. The average RMS value of current in these layers is 350 nA while the maximum obtained current is 900 nA at an applied bias of 100 mV. The bright features in the images correspond to the grains of higher conductance compared to the surrounding. The conductivity of the polymers depends on the water content as well as the conductivity of the polymerizing bath. RTILs are hydrophobic and may also expel any water product formation, thus minimizing the defects at the nanometer scale during polymerization and mostly giving a uniform distribution unlike classical electrolytes which form islands of non-conducting domains.20
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
The DSSCs were fabricated using the Y123 sensitizer,15 cobalt redox shuttles, and poly(3,4-alkylthiophenes) as cathodes. The fabricated cells exhibit broad incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) almost plateau like from 450–650 nm with high IPCE maxima > 90% (Fig. 3), which is higher when compared to the cells with I3−/I−21 and other reports of cobalt complex, and reached near to unity.
 Fig. 3  The incident photon-to-electron-conversion efficiency (IPCE) as function of wavelength of monochromatic light for PProDOT1 based counter electrodes by using 4a,b as a redox couple under standard illumination conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). 
A cobalt based redox shuttle stained the titania films with an enhanced photocurrent response in the spectral range from 390–470 nm compared to the I3−/I− based system due to lower absorption coefficients in the blue region and give high Voc. All polymer based cathode showed similar incident IPCE. The PV performance using the 4a,b redox shuttle showed a maximum short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 12.6 mA cm−2, 1000 mV open circuit potential (Voc) and a fill factor (FF) of ∼0.78 resulting in ∼9.9% power conversion efficiency (η) at standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions (Fig. 4b) with PProDOT1. Under the same conditions, the efficiency using a platinized cathode is illustrated in Fig. 4a, which underperformed. Most of the devices showed a linear response of Jsc and a slightly higher η under a lower light intensity due to a higher fill factor, which is ascribed to a lower ohmic loss (Table 2).

Different Voc and Jsc values were obtained depending on the redox shuttle (Tables 2–7). For complex 1a,b (Table 2) the low performance of the devices is due to the high oxidation potential of the redox shuttle which is too close to the oxidation potential of the dye resulting in slow dye regeneration, therefore low current was obtained, especially under full sun. With the use of PEDOT and PProDOT2 the FF is lower compared to the platinized cathode while a rather similar Voc is observed. However, this loss in FF is overcompensated by the higher current obtained with these polymeric cathodes and the overall efficiency was increased by 46% (from 2.81% to 4.1%) under full sunlight with the change of cathode from Pt to PProDOT2. PProDOT1 gave similar FF to the reference platinized cathode and a slight increase in current resulting in an intermediate performance.

Table 3 summerizes the PV results obtained with redox shuttle 2a,b. The oxidation potential of 2a is even higher than that of complex 1a and the driving force to regenerate the dye is almost negligible. Surprisingly this small difference in oxidation potential by 20 mV resulted in a drastically lower device performance, pointing towards the conclusion that the driving force of less than 100 mV for dye regeneration is insufficient. Drastically lower FF and Jsc were obtained, which get better with the use of polymer cathodes (250% increase) but are still not optimum for device application.

The oxidation potential of complex 3a is 150 mV lower than that of complex 1a (Table 1). This additional driving force for dye regeneration translates into the higher short circuit current of the devices as depicted in Table 4. As expected, the Voc was slightly lower compared to the devices using the 1a,b redox shuttle. But the over all efficiency still remains higher and with the proper choice of cathodes, the device performance improved to 5.57% efficiency. Exceptionally high Voc and best performing devices were obtained when complexes 4a,b were employed as the redox shuttle (Table 5). This excellent performance is attributed to a perfect match between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox shuttle. An additional asset is the good reversibility of oxidation of this redox shuttle (see ESI† for CV).

Under full sun illumination, Voc > 1000 mV was observed, together with a high current of 11 mA and a FF of 0.74 resulting an overall efficiency of 8.24% for the device with platinized cathode. The cells with PEDOT, PProDOT1, and PProDOT2 counter electrodes yielded an improvement of an additional 20% in efficiency (9.9%). A remarkable drop in charge transfer resistance (2.5 Ω cm−2) was observed5 when PProDOT1 was used as compared to the platinized cathode (50 Ω cm−2), pointing towards a favorable electrode–electrolyte interface.
When the PF6− anion in complex 4a,b was replaced by B(CN)4− (5a,b; Table 6) and TFSI− (6a,b; Table 7) a drop in both Voc and Jsc was observed. However in the case of B(CN)4− the polymer cathode was further able to improve the Jsc and efficiency. The relatively large size of TFSI− in (complex 6a,b) come as an obstacle in its path to compete for better PV properties (Table 7). The observed loss in Voc of polymer cathode devices is ascribed to the redox shuttle/polymer and/or the electrical sheet resistance at the interface of the FTO/polymer. A similar observation was found when an I3−/I− redox shuttle was used for DSSCs fabrication.22,23 In all the cobalt complexes, the PProDOT cathode showed comparable or enhanced Voc to platinized cathode. The redox shuttles using PProDOT2 as cathode exhibit a drop in both Jsc and Voc. A lower Voc states a downward shift of the band edge toward more positive potentials.24

The band edge shift is ascribed to the redox shuttle composition, surface modification of semiconducting particles,22,24etc. The possible surface modification medium here is RTILs used during the electrodeposition, and complete removal by washing is rather tricky. As a consequence, the RTIL species will be miscible with the redox shuttle and may influence the band edge after diffusion and adsorption to the TiO2 surface. Another plausible reason is the storage of charge in these redox active materials, when came in contact with the electrolytes, and for this reason they enjoy the privilege of being probed for supercapacitors.25 The role of counter ion in the polymer matrix has an influence on both the Voc and Jsc of the devices, mainly due to the different porosity, conductivity and thickness of the films.
With an aim to further induce flexibility in the polymer chain, dialkyl substituents in the PProDOT ring were exploited in combination with our best complex, 4a,b (Table 8). The use of dialkyl groups as a side chain in PProDOT, lowers the FF value, which originates from the relatively lower conductivity of the polymer. However it was able to improve the Jsc and resulted in a higher PCE than that of the platinized cathode. We conclude that the more bulky group results in a slower mass diffusion process.

Fig. 5 summarize the result obtained with the thickness variation of polymer cathodes. The thickness of the polymer films can easily be tuned by varying the polymerization time. With the increase in polymerization time, as expected, there is a steep growth in the thickness of polymer films, while to a larger extent the PV properties remain same in the measured window. We have noted that to be used as an efficient cathode in DSSCs a ∼500 nm thick PProDOT film is optimum for applications.

3.3 Characterization of redox shuttles
Cyclic voltammetry experiments for the redox shuttle were realized at the same concentration of sample and electrolyte (0.1M TBAPF6 in MeCN). Measurements were carried out in a glove box under an argon atmosphere using a set of Pt on FTO, Pt plate and Pt wire as working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. Ferrocene was used as internal standard and the voltage was sweep at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 unless otherwise mentioned. Prior to each measurement, samples were stirred for 15s and left to equilibrate for 3s. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts δ (in ppm) are referenced to residual solvent peaks. For 1H NMR: acetone-D6, 2.05 ppm. 19F and 31P NMR were recorded using a Bruker AV 200 MHz spectrometer. Coupling constants are expressed in hertz (Hz). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained with a Waters Q-TOF-MS instrument using electrospray ionisation (ESI).
3.4 Counter electrode fabrication and characterization
The polymer was electrodeposited potentiostatically at a DC potential of +1.2 V using Eco Chemie AUTOLAB 1260 in a three-electrode system comprised of working, platinum rod as the counter, and Ag/AgCl (leak free electrode procured from Harvard Apparatus GmbH) at 25 °C as the reference electrode. The potential was applied for a period of 20 s, unless otherwise stated in the text, sufficient enough to coat the TCO glass with polymer layers and to use them as metal free electro-catalyst. In the text PProDOT1 and PProDOT2 have been distinguished by the use of ionic liquids BMITFSI and EMIFAP, respectively. The working electrode, a SnO2:F (FTO) coated glass plate (∼15 Ω cm−2, TEC-15, Solar 2.3 mm thickness), was placed parallel to the counter electrode in a solution containing the ionic liquids and 0.1 M monomer. The substrates were cleaned ultrasonically before use (in deionized water and ethyl alcohol) and kept in a solution of ethanol, and prior to use dried by blowing with dry air. After the polymerization process the film was washed repeatedly with isopropyl alcohol to get rid of any unreacted monomer or ionic liquids and annealed at 60 °C for 30 min. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with a low voltage SEM, LEO 1530 instrument and were imaged without coating. Conductive scanning force microscopy (CSFM) measurements were performed in contact mode (Multimode, Veeco, extended with a TUNA current amplifier module for current measurements). Pt/Ir coated probes were used (Nanosensors PPP-EFM-50, 70 kHz) for CSFM experiments. The sample was glued with silver paste on a conductive steel substrate and to avoid electromagnetic noise, the scanner was shielded by wrapping Al foil around the SFM recording setup, and minimum possible force was applied to minimize possible destruction of the surface.
3.5 Solar cell fabrication and characterization
FTO glass plates (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar 4 mm thickness) were dipped in 40 mM TiCl4aq. at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A paste composed of 20 nm anatase TiO2 particles for the transparent nanocrystalline layer was coated on the FTO glass plates by screen printing. The TiO2 electrodes were made of ∼11 μm transparent layer (20 nm) and ∼5 μm scattering layer (400 nm, CCIC, HPW-400). The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow. After a second TiCl4 treatment, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a dye solution 3-{6-{4-[bis(2′,4′-dihexyloxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino-]phenyl}-4,4-dihexyl cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiphene-2-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid, (labelled as Y123)15 in a 50/50 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol and kept at room temperature for 18 h. The dye-coated TiO2 photoanode and counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich type cell with a gap of a hot-melt ionomer film, Surlyn (25 μm, Du-Pont). To reduce scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer, a light shading mask was used on the DSSCs, so the active area of DSSCs was fixed to 0.2 cm2. Photovoltaic experiments were made according to the reported method5,22 and the measurement settling time between applying a voltage and measuring a current for the I–V characterization of DSSCs was fixed to 40 ms at an interval of 10 mV.
4. Conclusions
We have synthesized a series of cobalt complexes with various polypyridyl ligands to rival I3−/I− application. The rational design allows us to tune the oxidation potential from 0.17 to 0.34 V vs. ferrocene by using electron acceptor groups. Since the platinized cathode was not effective, with the newly developed cobalt based redox shuttle, the introduction of alternative platinum-free cathodes based on poly(alkylthiophenes) resulted in enhanced PV properties. By using electrodeposited PProDOT as a cathode, we are able to improve the performance (by more than 20%) for these systems. The enhanced PV performance originates from the 3-dimensional ultraporous microstructure with high surface area of the polymer cathode. These nanoporous polymer films will possibly eliminate the formation of any passivation layer at the interface as observed by charge transfer resistance value. By the use of different ionic liquids the pore size and microstructure of polymer layers can be easily tuned for optimum results. With the combination of a transparent and noncorrosive cobalt (III/II) redox shuttle with a cheap electrocatalyst, the reported system shows great potential for large-scale DSSCs fabrication.
