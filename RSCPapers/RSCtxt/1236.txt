    , Accepted 24th May 2023First published on 25th May 2023AbstractThere is an increasing trend in semi-artificial photosynthesis systems that combine living cells with inorganic semiconductors to activate a bacterial catalytic network. However, these systems face various challenges, including electron–hole recombination, photocorrosion, and the generation of photoexcited radicals by semiconductors, all of which impair the efficiency, stability, and sustainability of biohybrids. We first focus on a reverse strategy to improve highly efficient CO2 photoreduction on biosynthesized inorganic semiconductors using an electron conduit in the electroactive bacterium S. oneidensis MR-1. Due to the suppressed charge recombination and photocorrosion on CdS, the maximum photocatalytic production rate of formate in water was 2650 μmol g−1 h−1 (with a selectivity of ca.100%), which ranks high among all photocatalysts and is the highest for inorganic–biological hybrid systems in an all-inorganic aqueous environment. The reverse enhancement effect of electrogenic bacteria on photocatalysis on semiconductors inspires new insight to develop a new generation of bio-semiconductor catalysts for solar chemical production.
Introduction
The large amounts of CO2 caused by the exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels, human life and production activities have accelerated the rate of global warming.1 Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into high-value-added fuels and chemicals seems to be a feasible strategy to simultaneously solve energy and environmental crises.2,3 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCO2R) in water primarily produces C1 products (CO, CH4).4,5 The HCOOH product is less reported, but it is highly desirable due to its ease of storage, transport, and potential markets in the leather industry, agriculture, and chemical industry.6 Various designed photocatalysts have been applied in CO2 photoreduction to HCOOH, such as alloys (NiB-In2O3,7 α-FeOOH-Al2O38), doped photocatalysts (Ni-doped ZnS9) or organic metal-complex adsorbed photocatalysts (CoPc-TiO2,10 Ru-complex-ZnS11), and porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).12–14 However, they generally need to be synthesized or operated in an organic medium (such as acetonitrile) in the presence of organic sacrificial agents (such as triethanolamine (TEOA)). The related organic chemicals, which are widely regarded as useful target products in CO2 conversion, frequently hinder product identification.15,16 Furthermore, organic complex photosensitizers/photocatalysts generally decompose in long-term photochemical reactions, resulting in photocatalytic performance degradation.17 Doped ZnS(Cd2+) has been reported to be a type of semiconductor photocatalyst with high product selectivity towards formate in an all-inorganic aqueous environment.18,19 While ZnS has high activity when exposed to UV light irradiation, efficient solar energy conversion by photocatalysis necessitates a photocatalyst with a band gap of less than 3 eV to absorb visible light (>400 nm), the main component of the solar spectrum. CdS has excellent light-harvesting ability due to its bandgap of about 2.4 eV, which matches well with the visible spectral range of solar irradiation.20 However, CdS-based photocatalytic activity and selectivity for HCOOH in an all-inorganic aqueous environment remain commonly low.
The inorganic–biological hybrid system has emerged as a promising semi-artificial photosynthetic platform that combines the efficient light absorption ability of inorganic semiconductors with the highly specific catalytic power of biocatalysts, outperforming either the chemical or biological route alone for selective CO2 photoreduction in water.21–24 Yang et al. induced the self-photosensitization of a non-photosynthetic bacterium, Moorella thermoacetica, with self-synthetic cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, enabling the photosynthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide for the first time.25 However, hydrogen electron donors, expensive energy sources, and strict or micro-anaerobic conditions are essential for the successful cultivation of these uncommon species. The harmful effect of O2-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, which can cause photooxidative damage to bacteria, is a huge challenge. Furthermore, there is a photocorrosion issue for sulfide photocatalysts in water, which includes direct photocorrosion under anaerobic conditions (formula (1)) and indirect photocorrosion under aerobic conditions (formula (2)), in which the sulfide ion is highly susceptible to oxidation by O2 or photogenerated holes, limiting its application.26 CdS + 2h+ → Cd2+ + S(1) CdS + 2O2 + h → Cd2+ + SO42−(2)

S. oneidensis MR-1 (SW), on the one hand, is a facultative anaerobe that can survive in oxic, suboxic, and anoxic environments.27 It is capable of utilizing a wide range of terminal electron acceptors including dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, it can reduce sulfite directly to H2S, and H2S can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS).28 The oxidative-stress-responding regulator OxyR has been reported to be activated in the presence of H2S, resulting in increased resistance to H2O2.29 On the other hand, SW has attracted great attention in pollutant biodegradation and mineralization due to its unique extracellular reduction capacity. The synthesis of metal sulfide nanomaterials (Ag2S,30 Fe2S,31 Cu2S,32 CdS,33etc.) can bioremediate environmental contaminants by recovering heavy metal ions (Ag+, Fe3+ Cu2+, Cd2+, etc.) and sulfur species, including sulfite, thiosulfate, and their reduction product H2S. Water-compatible photosensitizers have been combined with SW to catalyze CO2 transformation, while methyl viologen delivered electrons.34 Despite using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor, the yield of HCOOH was very low. Recently, a similar biotic–abiotic structure composed of biosynthetic CdS and SW was used for a light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER), the activity of which was linked to the two hydrogenases located in the periplasmic space of SW.35,36
In previous works, semiconductors always served as a light absorber, and the enzymes in bacteria acted as the photocatalytic center driven by the photogenerated electrons.37 However, SW, as a bidirectional electroactive bacterium, has been proven to transfer bio-electrons to the holes of the semiconductor.38,39 The outer membrane cytochromes, MtrC and OmcA, of Shewanella are the primary mediators of extracellular electron transfer.40 Recently, cytochrome nanowires were confirmed to be photoactive, enabling an efficient electronic interface between microbes and electrodes.41 Thus, it is theoretically feasible to inhibit charge recombination on semiconductors, through the flow of bio-electrons from bacteria. As a proof-of-concept, we have built a hybrid photosynthetic system that combines SW, a bacterium that consumes dissolved oxygen, is prone to exhibit slight activity for PCO2R, and is active for PHER, with biogenic CdS nanoparticles (Scheme 1). In the photosynthetic system, sulfite was supplied to activate CO2, which made it easier to accept the photogenerated electrons from CdS and produce HCOOH. Furthermore, the photoreaction activity was much increased by SW@CdS, which had an increased photocurrent response and accelerated separation/transport kinetics of photogenerated charges via the electron conduit. The content of oxygen and H2O2 was reduced, resulting in much reduced dissolution of Cd2+. As a result, the reverse enhancement of electricigens to semiconductor photocatalytic activity and stability was discovered, providing important insights for designing novel biotic–abiotic photosynthetic systems for advanced solar-to-chemical (S2C) conversion.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
CdS nanoparticles were synthesized as visible photocatalysts by metabolizing contaminant sulfur species and heavy metal ions (S2O32− and Cd2+). Unlike the smooth surface of native SW (Fig. S1†), the surface morphology of SW@CdS was rough as observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1a). From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the nanoparticles were found in close contact with the cell membrane (Fig. 1b), with the main size distribution at 8.3 ± 1.8 nm (Fig. 1b inset). Elemental mapping confirmed that these nanoparticles mainly consisted of Cd and S elements (Fig. S2†), and the C element originated from the cell. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of SW@CdS exhibited lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.336 nm, which can be indexed to the (111) crystal plane (Fig. 1c). The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images further confirmed the uniform distributions of Cd and S elements on SW@CdS (Fig. 1d). The crystallinity and chemical state of biogenic CdS were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to the result of XRD, three diffraction peaks correspond to the lattice planes (111), (220), and (331) of CdS, revealing a cubic crystal structure (JCPDS NO. 10-0454) (Fig. 2a). Additionally, the Cd 3d spectrum exhibited two typical peaks at 405.2 and 412.0 eV (Fig. 2b), which could be assigned to Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. The binding energies of 161.9 eV (S 2p3/2) and 163.3 eV (S 2p1/2) in the S 2p spectrum were also consistent with the S signals in sulfide compounds (Fig. 2c), verifying the successful coating of the CdS NPs on the SW surface. The other two samples were synthesized as controls, including chemosynthetic CdS in water and the physical mixture of CdS and SW (SW-CdS). Chemosynthetic CdS was synthesized according to the reported method in the literature.42 It exhibited the morphology of nanoparticle clusters in SEM and TEM images (Fig. S3†). The crystal type of biomineralized CdS and chemosynthetic CdS was the same (Fig. S4†). For SW-CdS, bacteria were found to be loosely covering the surface of the agglomerated nanoparticles (Fig. S5†). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were used to directly investigate the optical properties of CdS, SW, and SW@CdS (Fig. 2d). CdS showed a weak absorption band at 300–550 nm, while SW showed an intense absorption band at 410 nm (the Soret band), a weak absorption band at 531 nm, and a shoulder at 560 nm. These peak positions are characteristic of the air-oxidized form of the heme groups of c-type cytochromes (c Cyts) and are almost identical to the outer-membrane decaheme c Cyts purified from strain SW.43,44 The absorption region of SW@CdS indicated that it was responsive to visible light (>400 nm) and the energy band gap was calculated to be 2.44 eV according to the Tauc plot (Fig. 2e). A Mott–Schottky (MS) plot was constructed to investigate the Fermi energy levels and flat band potentials of CdS. The conduction band (CB) of CdS was about −0.69 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (Fig. 2f). Based on the band gap, the valence band position was 1.75 eV. According to the above values, the energy band scheme was presented (Fig. 2f inset). CdS has matched CB position to reduce CO2 (CO2 → HCOOH, E = −0.61 V vs. NHE) based on thermodynamics.

Performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The performance of PCO2RR for the samples was evaluated in a CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution with Na2SO3 (25 mM) as an activation agent. All photocatalytic tests were performed in a Pyrex cell with a quartz lid under mild conditions (15 °C and 1 atm CO2). Here we do not distinguish between formic acid and formate, which are collectively referred to as formate. Under dark conditions, no formate or the other liquid products were observed in the 1H-NMR results (Fig. 3a). After one hour of light illumination, formate was first detected in the SW@CdS/SO32− group, implying high photocatalytic activity (Fig. S6†). Two hours later, the concentration of formate increased and became similar for the SW-CdS/SO32− and CdS/SO32− groups, but was still much lower than the SW@CdS/SO32− group. Until the third hour, the formate product appeared and the content reached 226.7 μmol g−1 for the SW/SO32− group. However, after four hours of light illumination, the accumulated formate yields produced by SW/SO32− and CdS/SO32− were the same, while both were lower than the mixture of them, SW-CdS/SO32−. Furthermore, the yield of SW@CdS/SO32− was about 3515.6 μmol g−1, which was about 2.9-fold of that of SW-CdS/SO32− (1219.0 μmol g−1) and about 5-fold of those of bare SW/SO32− (670.1 μmol g−1) and CdS/SO32− (705.6 μmol g−1), implying a synergistic interaction between SW and CdS. We then tested the long-term performance of SW@CdS and CdS under 36 hours of continuous illumination with an optimized catalyst quality (Fig. 3b). The accumulated formate produced by SW@CdS/SO32− increased in a straight line up to 66.26 μmol mg−1. However, the CdS/SO32− group demonstrated significantly lower formate production activity (1740 μmol g−1) and poorer stability, with the formate content dropping to 370 μmol g−1 after eighteen hours. Additionally, we used gas chromatography (GC) to detect the gas products, and no gaseous products were detected over 24 hours (Fig. S7†). As a result, the formate selectivity was calculated to be 100% throughout the photocatalytic process (Fig. 3c). The SEM characterization after the photoreaction may explain the longer stability of SW@CdS, where CdS in the SW@CdS group retained its invariable morphology and good dispersion (Fig. 3c inset). However, the morphology of the chemosynthetic CdS was severely destroyed (Fig. S8†). We also tested the bacterial activity of SW@CdS after the photoreaction by immediately inoculating it into a fresh heterotrophic medium. After 24 hours, there existed obvious growth (Fig. S9†). The confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM) image of SW@CdS showed strong green fluorescence and weak red fluorescence, which confirmed the viability of SW@CdS after the photoreaction (Fig. S10†). Compared with previous works (Fig. 3d), the formate production rate (3.975 μmol h−1) was 7.5 times higher than that of CdS photosensitized engineered E. coli with formate dehydrogenase (FDH) as the catalytic center (0.525 μmol h−1). Furthermore, the formate production rate per unit mass was calculated to be 2650 μmol g−1 h−1, which was one of the highest among photocatalysts.

Insights into the photocatalytic mechanism of SW@CdS
Firstly, we tested the photocatalytic ability of SW separately. When sodium lactate was supplied, only hydrogen was produced (Fig. S11†) and no formate was present in the liquid (Fig. S12†), which is consistent with previously reported work.36 Moreover, the dithionite-driven SW-dependent reduction of CO2 to formate did not occur in our experiments (Fig. S13†). For the SW@CdS/SO32− group, the CO2 reduction products did not appear in the absence of CO2 (under N2) (Fig. S14†). Following the photocatalytic reaction with 13C-labeled CO2, the reaction solution was filtered for 1H NMR analysis to investigate the original resource that generate the carbon-reduced products. In the 1H NMR spectrum, a distinct doublet was observed at 8.69 and 8.21 ppm (Fig. 4a), which was attributed to the protons bound to 13C in formate. On the other hand, only a singlet showed up at 8.45 ppm when unlabeled CO2 was employed. As a result, the formate product was supposed to be generated by CO2, rather than impurities. Such a photocatalytic reaction can also occur when the sacrificial agents are triethylamine (TEA), ascorbic acid (AA), or triethanolamine (TEOA) (Fig. S15†). However, SW@CdS/SO32− achieved the highest formate yield of 3515.6 μmol g−1, which was 11.5, 4.9, and 1.6 times higher than SW@CdS/TEA (308 μmol g−1), SW@CdS/AA (709 μmol g−1) and SW@CdS/TEOA (2250 μmol g−1), respectively. TEOA seemed to be decomposed under light since the presence of formate-like NMR peaks (Fig. S16†). Therefore, SO32− was suspected to be not only a sacrificial agent for our system. Then, the formate formation yields for various photocatalysts, but all with SO32− in solution, were analyzed to determine the primary contributors that improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and stability (Fig. 4b). When only SW was present in the photocatalytic solution, formate was not detected under long-term illumination (Fig. S17†). However, when only SO32− was used, a small quantity of formate was detected (Fig. 4b). SO32− produces hydrated electrons (eaq−) and SO3˙− under ultraviolet photo-detachment.45 eaq− with a standard reduction potential of about −2.9 V can activate CO2 to produce CO2˙− and accelerate the generation of hydrogen atoms, eventually forming formic acid.46 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis confirmed the typical signal for SO3˙− species in our system (Fig. S18†). Thus, the high selectivity towards formate was related to SO32−. When SW or chemosynthetic CdS was added with SO32−, a similar or slightly lower formate concentration was observed indicating that SW and CdS alone did not contribute to the photoreduction. But when SW and CdS were added together with SO32−, an obvious increase in the formate formation rate was observed, implying a synergistic effect between chemosynthetic CdS and SW. The highest rate of formate formation was obtained with SW@CdS/SO32−, but it was greatly reduced when bacterial activity was lost. Thus, the interaction between CdS and active SW was suspected to play a critical role in assisting the photocatalysis process. To explain the improved performance, photocurrent tests were carried out (Fig. 4c). Amperometry I–t curves for SW, CdS, SW-CdS, and SW@CdS showed an immediate increase in photocurrent after illumination during the intermittent on–off irradiation cycles, which then declined when the irradiation was stopped. SW showed a slight photocurrent response (0.82 μA cm−2), which indicated the light-induced bio-electron transfer by cytochrome.41,47 Compared with bare CdS (1.06 μA cm−2), SW-CdS exhibited an enhanced photocurrent density (1.36 μA cm−2). It could be because the bio-electrons combine with photogenerated holes, weakening the recombination process of the photogenerated electrons and holes.39 For SW@CdS, the photocurrent density was further increased (3.80 μA cm−2), which was 3.58 and 2.79 times that of bare CdS and SW-CdS. For SW@CdS, the highest photocurrent can be explained by better contact between SW and CdS, which may lead to a promoted bio-electron transfer at the interface of semiconductors and microorganisms. The transient fluorescence lifetime test can be regarded as a crude, yet rational indicator to estimate the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers. A prolonged lifetime was observed for the SW@CdS sample, which implies the accelerated separation/transport kinetics of photogenerated charges (Fig. 4d). Since cyclic voltammetry is a standard tool in electrochemistry and has regularly been used to study and characterize the electron transfer interactions between microorganisms and microbial fuel cell anodes,48 the whole-cell cyclic voltammogram (CV) was obtained using a carbon cloth (CC) immersed in a cell suspension (Fig. 4e). The CV data of SW@CdS (anaerobic) revealed a pair of well-defined redox peaks at −0.46 V versus Ag/AgCl corresponding to the self-synthesized flavins that govern the shuttle-mediated electron transfer (MET) processes. The one pair of peaks centered at −0.15 V was associated with the outer-membrane c-type cytochromes that control the contact-based direct electron transfer (DET) processes.49 When compared to SW, the peak current of SW@CdS increased dramatically upon illumination, indicating enhanced MET and DET processes after CdS modification. Therefore, it seems that SW cells could interact electrochemically with an external photocatalyst, and the electron transfer interactions were improved by light. The intracellular ATP and NADH/NAD+ ratios in SW@CdS after 4 h illumination were detected (Fig. S19†). The higher ATP and NADH/NAD+ levels indicated that CdS-generated photoexcited electrons can be taken up and converted to the cellular reducing power and proton motive force (PMF). However, increasing NADH regeneration also led to an increase in the efficiency of extracellular electron transfer (EET).50 To uncover the electron flow in the biotic–abiotic photosynthetic system, rotenone was used as a respiration inhibitor,51 which can significantly suppress the normal electron flow (from intracellular to extracellular) in SW. The 74.12% decline in formate production indicated that the transfer of electrons from intracellular to extracellular was responsible for a large fraction of the total formate production in the hybrid photosynthetic system (Fig. S20†). Since the conduction band (CB) position of SW@CdS (−0.69 V vs. NHE, Fig. 2f) was more negative than the standard reduction potential of O2/O2˙− (−0.33 V vs. NHE), the photogenerated electrons on the CB easily reacted with molecular oxygen to generate O2˙−. However, the valence band (VB) position of SW@CdS (+1.75 V vs. NHE) was much lower than the standard oxidation potential of OH−/˙OH (+1.99 V vs. NHE), and the photogenerated holes could not oxidize OH− or H2O to generate ˙OH. Resazurin, an oxygen indicator was used to indicate the anaerobic environment created by SW.52 Initially, the untreated aqueous solution appeared blue due to the presence of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 4f inset and S21†). As SW was added for seconds, the solution faded from blue to pink and finally to colorless. When SW@CdS was used, it also changed to the original color of the photocatalyst (yellow), which suggests a microbial electron shuttling process and the successful formation of an anaerobic environment.53 The quantity of the generated H2O2 for the SW@CdS and CdS photocatalysts was determined by iodometry. The amount of H2O2 produced after four-hour illumination was 0.96 μM, which was slightly lower than that of chemosynthetic CdS (1.61 μM) and much lower than the reported value for photocatalysts used for producing hydrogen peroxide (Fig. S22†). From formulas (1) and (2), if photocorrosion occurs, cadmium in CdS is dissolved into the solution as cadmium ions. Thus, the Cd2+ concentration in the supernatant after
a 4-hour photoreaction was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Fig. 4f). The result of the CdS/SO32− system indicated that it had suffered obvious photocorrosion (4.08 ppm). The cadmium ion concentration was lower (2.88 ppm) for the dead SW@CdS/SO32− system. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrum indicated the presence of –OH, –NH, –CO, and other chemical bonds on the bacterial membrane (Fig. S23†), which may act as a reductant or complex agent for Cd2+.54 Furthermore, the Cd2+ concentration for the SW@CdS/SO32− system was the lowest (0.64 ppm). As a result, electron transfer via flavins and outer-membrane cytochromes, which were highly dependent on bacterial activity, was thought to favor electron–hole separation and reduce CdS corrosion, thereby extending photocatalytic activity and stability.

Conclusions
Exoelectrogen SW, a facultative anaerobic microbe widely explored for pollutant biodegradation and mineralization, was employed to construct a semi-artificial photosynthetic platform. CdS was synthesized from contaminants and used as a light-absorbing semiconductor shell, with hole–electron pair separation enhanced via the electron conduit of SW. Sulfite was used to activate CO2 and promote high selectivity towards formate. Furthermore, the respiration of electrogenic bacteria helps in suppressing the photocorrosion of CdS. As a result, the CdS-photosynthetic hybrid system was successfully self-built to achieve advanced CO2 conversion to valuable formate at a high rate (2650 μmol g−1 h−1). Given that bio-electrons can be continuously produced through microbial respiration and substrate consumption, this inspires a new generation of bio-semiconductor catalysts that are environmentally friendly and practical in applications.

Table Content:
CdS + 2h+ → Cd2+ + S	(1)
CdS + 2O2 + h → Cd2+ + SO42−	(2)

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the photocatalytic process of SW@CdS.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM, (b) TEM, and (c) HR-TEM images of SW@CdS. Lattice fringes of the CdS nanoparticles were measured in an enlarged HR-TEM image (inset). (d) HR-TEM EDS maps showed the C, Cd, and S elements.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XRD pattern of the SW@CdS nanoparticles. XPS spectra of the CdS nanoparticles: (b) Cd 3d and (c) S 2p. (d) UV–vis DRS spectra of SW@CdS, SW, and CdS. (e) The Tauc plot of SW@CdS was calculated from UV–vis DRS spectra using the Kubelka–Munk function. (f) Mott–Schottky plot of SW@CdS. Inset: band structure of SW@CdS.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The formate yield for various samples under 4h illumination. (b) Time-dependent formate yields of SW@CdS/SO32− and CdS/SO32−. (c) The formate selectivity of SW@CdS/SO32− for 24h. Inset: the SEM images of SW@CdS after illumination. (d) Comparison with the previously reported formate selectivity and yields of similar catalysts. Number: the serial number of the reference, which is organized in Table S1.†	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) 1H NMR spectra of H13COOH produced in an isotope tracing experiment using 12CO2 or 13CO2 as a reactant and (b) the final formate yield for different reaction systems after 4 h illumination. (c) Transient photocurrent responses of SW, CdS, SW-CdS, and SW@CdS. (d) The transient fluorescence lifetime test. (e) Cyclic voltammetry curves of SW and SW@CdS biofilms at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The arrows indicate the peak locations in the CV curves. (f) The amounts of dissolved Cd2+ in the supernatant for different photoreaction systems. Inset: anaerobic environmental testing. Resazurin was used as the oxygen indicator: the blue color (a high oxygen content) faded to yellow (the color of the photocatalyst) in 10 seconds since the flow of bio-electrons.
