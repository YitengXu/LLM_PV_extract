    , Accepted 3rd February 2021First published on 4th February 2021AbstractDue to their outstanding advantages like excellent moisture resistance and compatibility with up-scalable manufacturing processes, carbon (C) electrode hole transport layer (HTL)-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent an excellent solution to the serious limitations caused by the commonly used HTL and expensive noble metal electrode. The C-electrode can be deposited using different techniques from various carbon allotropes and their derivatives. However, the choice of optimal carbon sources is still open to debate, which will certainly have a strong effect on the performance and long-term stability of the resulting PSCs. Here, the modular HTL-free C-PSCs were assembled by the lamination of two independently processed half-stacks of a semi-cell and a charge collector, where the C-electrodes were processed using a simple spray coating technique at low temperature (85 °C). Three typical carbon sources were used, i.e., multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), carbon nanocoil (CNC), and graphene. A comparative study was conducted to determine the best candidate. Results indicated that MWCNT might be more preferable as the back electrode in HTL-free PSCs in terms of well-aligned band alignment, superior ability in extraction and collection of photo-generated holes. As a result, an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.2% was achieved for modular MWCNT-based PSCs, and much improved thermal and humidity stabilities were also demonstrated. Our achievement demonstrates the irreplaceable role of tri-functional MWCNT in C-based HTL-free PSCs with integrated function: (i) back electrode; (ii) hole extraction and collection; and (iii) excellent moisture barrier.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging as promising next generation photovoltaic devices with unprecedented advantages, and the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly surged from 9.7% to over 25% within less than a decade since the pioneering work on the first all-solid-state PSCs in 2012.1–5 Such rapid progress has never been seen before in the history of photovoltaic development. The great success of PSCs can be mainly attributed to the inherently exceptional properties of metal halide perovskites, such as superior light absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), long balanced charge-carrier diffusion lengths in polycrystalline films (>1 μm), high defect tolerance, and ease of fabrication using a simple solution process.6–9 Typically, PSCs are based on a multi-layered architecture that generally includes a thin perovskite active layer for light harvesting, which is sandwiched between the hole-transport layer (HTL) and the electron-transport layer (ETL), and the front and back electrodes for charge collection.10–12 Efficient charge extraction and transport with high selectivity and minimal potential loss are essential to achieve high performance PSCs.11,13–15 To date, the best performing PSCs have been obtained with gold as the back electrode and organic spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL.16,17 However, the use of expensive and unstable noble metals as back electrodes, such as gold and silver, seriously limits the large-scale application of PSCs. Gold and silver are rare metals and their deposition requires a highly energy-consuming vacuum evaporation method. Remarkably, the metal ions of Au and Ag can pass through the whole cell structure and interact with the highly mobile halogen atoms from the halide perovskites under moderate temperatures and illumination, resulting in an irreversible deterioration of photovoltaic (PV) performance.18,19 Moreover, in spite of its good functionality for high performance devices, the most widely used spiro-OMeTAD HTL does have several serious limitations as summarized in our recent report.20 Fortunately, PSCs can also work without the HTL and noble metal electrodes. Carbon (C)-based HTL-free PSCs, in which carbon layers with excellent moisture resistance and thermal stability can effectively function as both HTLs and back electrodes, are emerging as an excellent solution to the serious limitations caused by the HTL and noble metal electrode.7,8,13,14,21,22 In fact, carbon has a well-aligned work function (∼5.0 eV) with respect to the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite phase; it is very close to that of gold (5.1 eV).23–25 This makes the hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface possible and paves the way to HTL-free PSCs. As an additional advantage, carbon is not prone to the formation of metal halides as many metal electrodes used in the PSCs do, which leads to high resistivity and iodide deficiency in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the abovementioned outstanding advantages, it is well recognized currently that C-based HTL-free PSCs represent a very appealing and indispensable strategy towards the large-scale industrial production of PSCs.13,14,26
In spite of its great potential, the PCEs of C-based HTL-free PSCs still lag behind the traditionally processed PSCs with organic HTLs and noble metal electrodes; the main efficiency-limiting factor is attributed to two features: (1) the intrinsically inferior contact at the perovskite/carbon interface, and (2) the high sheet resistance of the carbon electrode. As back electrodes in C-based PSCs, the carbon layer may be processed using various deposition techniques depending on the PSC configuration. For PSCs with a mesoporous structure, the C-electrodes were usually deposited using a high temperature (400–500 °C) process from carbon paste to ensure better contact between carbon particles, such as screen-printing or blade-coating techniques.13,14,27–29 However, the high-temperature process is time and energy-consuming and cannot be applied in plastic and flexible devices.13,27,30 In particular, the high-temperature process was infeasible for the layer-by-layer grown planer structure, because the underneath perovskite layer decomposes over 100 °C. It should be noted that PSCs with a planer structure have been attracting more and more interest in recent years both in scientific and industrial communities due to their simple device configuration and fabrication processes, which are conducive to practical application.23,31–34 Therefore, to successfully tackle these problems, an innovative modular PSC design was proposed in our recent report, that is, modular C-PSCs were assembled by the lamination of two independently processed half-stacks of a semi-cell A and a charge collector B (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the C-electrodes were deposited using a low temperature spray coating technique with the advantages of low equipment cost and high deposition rate.20,35 Our previous results demonstrated that this modular PSC design was favourable for the facile repair and maintenance of C-PSCs via modular interconnections, and the performance was among those of the current state-of-the-art PSCs with C-electrode. Nevertheless, the choice of optimal carbon sources is still open to debate, which will certainly have a strong effect on the performance and long-term stability of PSCs.

Herein, the modular HTL-free C-PSCs were assembled, in which three typical carbon sources were used for C-electrodes processed using a low temperature (85 °C) spray coating technique, i.e., multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), carbon nanocoil (CNC), and graphene. A comparative study was conducted to determine the best candidate. As a result, an improved PCE of 11.2% was achieved for modular MWCNT-based PSCs, and much improved thermal and humidity stabilities were also demonstrated. Our achievement demonstrates the irreplaceable role of tri-functional MWCNT in C-based HTL-free PSCs with the integrated function: (i) back electrode; (ii) hole extraction and collection; and (iii) excellent moisture barrier.
Results and discussion
An overview of the fabricating process of the modular HTL-free C-PSCs is shown in Fig. 1. The structure was assembled by the lamination of two independently processed half-stacks of a semi-cell A and a charge collector B under a rather small pressure. The semi-cell A was obtained by sequentially spin coating SnO2 (ETL) and a perovskite active layer, and spray coating a carbon electrode, while the charge collector B was obtained by the direct deposition of a carbon layer on an FTO/glass substrate. To screen out the best candidate by performing a comparative study, three typical carbon sources were used for the low temperature processed C-electrodes, i.e., MWCNT, CNC, and graphene. Here, the low-temperature spray coating from perovskite-friendly isopropanol suspension was used to obtain a high quality C-electrode layer, which offers several key advantages compared to the mesoscopic high-temperature treated process: (1) Isopropanol did not cause any severe effect on the underlying perovskite phase, but wetted and welded the surface of both films through van der Waals interactions,36 and was therefore favourable for the strong adhesion between the C-electrode and the perovskite active layer; (2) easier to form ohmic contact between modules with a certainty from previous resistance–pressure measurement;35 (3) compatibility with multiple carbon sources, and (4) low equipment cost and faster deposition rate. In addition, the procedure for the preparation and composition of the triple cation mixed perovskite film has been optimized according to our previous reports.35,37,38 Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-grown mixed perovskite film suggesting that a highly crystalline perovskite film was obtained, and the patterns of the FTO/SnO2 substrate are also presented for comparison. According to a previous report, all the intense diffraction peaks can be assigned to diffractions of the tetragonal Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 phase, and the incorporation of Cs+ to form CsFAMA three cationic perovskite can significantly reduce the defect density, leading to longer charge carrier lifetimes and better durability.39 The homogeneous and dense crystallinity of the mixed perovskite film was further proved by the top view SEM image (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Clearly, a larger crystallite with an average grain size around 300 nm and a substrate fully covered by perovskite film without pin-holes were observed from the SEM images.
Generally, to achieve satisfactory PV performance in a C-based device, efficient charge extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface and vertical path charge transport in the C-electrode layer with minimized energy loss are highly desirable. However, on the other hand, the carbon electrode layer was responsible for lateral charge transport. Because of the inherent structural defect and electrical resistance in conventional C-electrodes, they suffer significant energy loss in the process of charge carrier lateral transportation.35 Nevertheless, in the modular interconnected architecture (as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a), a good ohmic contact could be easily formed between the semi-cell A and the charge collector B even under a very small pressure (less than 0.025 MPa), and the photo-generated holes were extracted by the C-electrode in the semi-cell A and subsequently lateral charge transport and collection mainly occurred in the FTO conductive film in the charge collector B. The excellent conductivity and negligible resistance–temperature dependence (as proved in Fig. S2, ESI†) would remarkably alleviate the lateral transport energy loss compared to that in the conventional C-electrode layer.

(e) EQE spectrum of C-based modular PSCs with various carbon sources (CNC, MWCNT, and graphene). 
Therefore, one of the key advantage of our modular interconnected architecture is the efficient lateral charge transport with minimized energy loss. Moreover, the equivalent circuit model is shown in Fig. 2b to elucidate PV performance, where the related parameters can be illustrated as follows: Jph is the photo-induce constant current; J is the current flowing though operating load; V denotes the load voltage; Rs (series resistance) corresponds to interfacial contact resistance and sheet resistance of the C-electrode; and Rsh (shunt resistance) comes from the charge recombination loss inside the PSC.37 After this, the J–V curves of the champion devices with modular structure and non-modular structure (i.e., semi-cell A without the charge collector B) are shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S3 (ESI†), respectively. It should be noted that a majority of previously reported C-based PSCs were based on a very small active area (from 0.03 to 0.16 cm2), and the PV performance declined significantly with an increase in the area, mainly due to the enhanced interface defects caused by large areas,40–42 as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). However, the modular structure has been proved to have a good PV performance even at a large active area;35 it should be emphasized that a relatively larger active area of 1.0 cm2 was used in our current J–V test. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the PCEs of non-modular C-PSCs with CNC, MWCNT and graphene were 1.76%, 4.05%, and 2.94%, respectively, indicating that MWCNT was a superior carbon source with the lowest Rs. On the other hand, the detailed PV parameters for champion modular HTL-free C-PSCs with various carbon sources are summarized in Table 1. Overall, an improvement in PV parameters was observed for C-PSCs with various carbon sources by the modular interconnected architecture, further confirming the advantage of the current modular design. Remarkably, a significant enhancement from 4.05% to 11.2% was achieved for MWCNT-based PSCs via modular design (as shown in Fig. 2d). From the equivalent circuit model analysis (Fig. 2b), it is predicted that the dramatically lowered Rs and boosted Rsh should be responsible for the enhancement in PV performance with a modular design, further confirming that the key advantage with our modular interconnected architecture is the efficient lateral charge transport with minimized energy loss. Besides, the best PCE of 11.20% was achieved from MWCNT-based PSCs with the corresponding PV parameters: a Voc of 1.009 V, a Jsc of 22.01 mA cm2, and a FF of 50.44, while the PCE for PSCs with graphene and CNC electrode is 9.17% and 4.78%, respectively. Thus, it can be reasonably inferred that the MWCNT materials are more preferred as carbon sources for low-temperature sprayed carbon electrodes in modular HTL-free PSCs. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding modular C-PSCs with different carbon sources were recorded to verify the measurement results (Fig. 2e). The integrated photocurrent values from the EQE spectra were 14.53 mA cm−2, 21.17 mA cm−2, and 20.86 mA cm−2 for the CNC-based, MWCNT-based, and graphene-based PSCs, respectively, which are in good agreement with our values measured from J–V curves, and the slightly lower current density from the EQE measurement than that from the J–V scan was due to the dependence of Jsc on light intensity, which was derived from the trap state in the electron transport layer.43

To further understand the unique superiority of the modular interconnected structure in the aspect of efficient charge transport mechanism, the dark I–V curves of the modular and non-modular PSCs were detected and compared as shown in Fig. 3a–c, where the planar PSCs with the SnO2 ETL/perovskite/C-electrode can be treated as a single junction diode.37,44 According to the well-established P–N junction diode model, the dark current under reverse bias (i.e., leakage current) comes from the minority carrier drift current mainly caused by trap state recombination, and the slope of linear fitting under reverse bias was determined by 1/Rsh.45 As shown in Fig. 3a–c, the dramatically boosted Rsh values observed for all samples with a modular structure, clearly indicate that the recombination energy losses were lowered via modular interconnection, in good agreement with the above J–V analysis. It should also be noted that, when the forward bias is greater than ∼0.8 V, the inject current density of modular structure surpasses that of the non-modular structure, indicating that a lower series resistance (Rs) is achieved via the modular interconnection with a charge collector B, which is definitely conducive to minimizing the charge carrier losses and a better PV performance.23 In addition, Fig. 3d shows the comparison of the dark I–V curves of the modular PSCs with three carbon sources, the relatively lower leakage current under reverse bias and highest inject current at forward bias further demonstrate the advantage of MWCNT as the C-electrode.

To further understand the unique advantage of MWCNT in HTL-free C-PSCs in terms of hole charge extraction ability from the perovskite layer to the C-electrode layer, steady-state PL and TRPL spectroscopy of the perovskite/C-electrode samples with various carbon sources were measured and are shown in Fig. 4a and b. Regardless of the carbon source, the dominant PL emission peak was centered at 763 nm with no obvious change, indicating that the depositing of different carbon electrodes did not change the energy band-gap of the underneath perovskite film. While the peak intensity weakened significantly due to the PL quenching effect induced by the deposition of carbon electrode, and the most noticeable PL quenching effect was observed in the perovskite/MWCNT-electrode sample, suggesting a more efficient photo-generated charge dissociation and extraction from the perovskite to the MWCNT-electrode.46 The result can be further confirmed by the TRPL decay spectra (Fig. 4b), which can be used to evaluate the photo-generated carrier lifetime by double exponential fitting.20 The detailed parameters deduced from the fitted results are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Primarily, the average charge carrier lifetime of pristine perovskite was 254.51 ns, while dramatic shorter lifetimes of 21.65 ns, 29.28 ns and 51.77 ns were deduced from the perovskite/C-electrode samples with MWCNT, graphene and CNC as the carbon sources, respectively. Apparently, the fastest decay rate and lowest carrier lifetime were observed using the perovskite/MWCNT-electrode sample, providing convincing evidence that the photo-induced hole charges in perovskite could be more efficiently extracted by the C-electrode with an MWCNT source, thus leading to the superior performance of C-PSCs with an MWCNT-based electrode as demonstrated in Fig. 2c. Moreover, the energy level alignment between the perovskite layer and the adjacent carbon electrode is crucial for understanding the hole extraction process in the semi-cell module A. To determine the precise work function of the C-electrode with various sources, Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of carbon films with various carbon source materials (Fig. 4c) were measured and the corresponding cut-off energy and Fermi edge are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the resulting parameters are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The calculated work function values for MWCNT, graphene and CNC are 5.02 eV, 5.14 eV, and 6.13 eV, respectively.39 Accordingly, the schematic band energy alignment of semi-cell A with different carbon sources is shown in Fig. 4d. It is clear that MWCNT and graphene exhibit appropriate energy levels beneficial for hole extraction, while the energy barrier (0.63 eV) at the interface between the perovskite layer and the adjacent CNC electrode would impede hole extraction and increase recombination energy loss.47 Notably, it is apparent that the MWCNT electrode has a larger band offset than the graphene electrode, which will facilitate hole extraction. In addition, from the top view and the corresponding cross-section SEM images of semi-cell A, where the C-electrodes were spray coated with various carbon sources (Fig. 5), the intertwined and interconnected structure of the small sized MWCNT materials was favourable for the intimate interface contact with the perovskite layer, thus facilitating hole extraction. While the larger size and spatial gap between the graphene sheets were adverse for hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the C-electrode layer, and the coil structure of CNC was also unfavourable for charge extraction. Specifically, through the spray deposition method, the MWCNT-electrode also exhibits an intertwined and interconnected structure, which enables sufficient contact with other carbon particles. Ascribed to the densification and the enhanced contact between the MWCNT-electrode particles, the MWCNT-electrode is also inclined to have a higher electrical conductivity that facilitates hole transfer in the carbon film.

Besides hole charge extraction ability, the conductivity of the carbon back electrode was another key factor in the performance and stability of PSCs. For conventional non-modular C-PSCs, a micrometer-scale thickness (20–80 μm) was basically required for the carbon electrode to ensure better conductivity, but the non-radiative recombination energy losses increased significantly due to the prolonged hole transport distance.32,34,48 For current modular design, the C-PSCs were assembled by the lamination of the semi-cell A and the charge collector B; the hole extraction process can be further classified into two main steps for C-based PSCs: the first step is the hole extraction from the perovskite film to the carbon electrode in the semi-cell A, and the second step is the hole transport in the charge collector B.46,49 To examine the advantage of MWCNT in modular C-PSCs in terms of conductivity in charge collector B, the C-electrode with various carbon sources were directly spray coated on insulating glass substrates and the temperature dependent resistance was measured under a heating and cooling cyclic process in the range of 35–85 °C. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, all the samples exhibit rather good electrical stability even during the cooling and heating operations, and the MWCNT present the lowest resistance (580–605 Ω) and slightest temperature dependence, demonstrating the advantage of MWCNT in terms of conductivity. Moreover, EIS measurements were conducted at a bias of 0.3 V under illumination conditions to demonstrate the advantage of MWCNTs in terms of the charge transfer characteristic in modular C-PSCs.23,34Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots of the modular C-PSCs with different carbon sources, and the corresponding equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. 6d. According to previous reports, the value of the starting point at the real part (Z′) corresponds to Rs, and the semi-circles correspond to transfer resistance (Rtr), which is associated with the charge transfer between the perovskite and carbon electrode.50–52 It can be derived that both Rs and Rtr were in the order of MWCNT-PSCs < graphene-PSCs < CNC-PSCs; the lowest Rtr and Rs again confirmed that MWCNT was the best candidate for application as the back electrode in HTL-free C-PSCs in the aspect of charge transport properties, which was in line with the PL, TRPL and resistance–temperature analysis. More detailed characterization on the specific MWCNT material used in the current study can be found in Fig. S5–S9 (ESI†).

Despite its remarkable PCE performance, long-term stability is critical for PSCs to become the next generation game-changing PV technology. Numerous strategies have been proposed to ameliorate the stability issues, it is the current consensus that the main stability improvements should be achieved via the modification of the PSC architecture, such as replacing metallic electrodes and HTL with the carbon back electrode. At the moment, a carbon-based chemically stable and hydrophobic electrode is the only back electrode material that does not have any intrinsic and moisture-induced degradation, which provides a strong protection from the ambient environment to the underneath sensitive layers.53,54 Here, to examine the influence of a series of C-electrode sources on the stability of modular HTL-free C-PSCs, the humidity-stability and thermal-stability of the PSCs without encapsulation were investigated by periodically recording PV parameters while the samples were kept under different ambient conditions (relative humidity: ∼60%, temperature: ∼30 °C, as shown in Fig. 7a, and in a vacuum drying oven at a constant temperature of 85 °C, as shown in Fig. 7b). Here, the PCE decay (Δη) is defined as follows:55 (1)where η0 is the initial PCE and ηt is the PCE after a certain time. From Fig. 7a, the Δη values after 600 h were 27.8%, 33.9%, and 18.2%, for the unencapsulated C-PSCs with MWCNT, graphene and CNC, respectively. The distinction in humid-stability performance was mainly attributed to the hydrophobic properties of the different carbon sources. Fig. 7c–e show the comparison of water contact angles for the C-electrode with various sources: 141.55° for CNC (c), 142.29° for MWCNT (d), and 91.71° for graphene (e). The significantly higher water contact angles of MWCNT suggested it was superior in terms of hydrophobic ability and conducive to hindering the PCE degradation under ambient moisture attack. What is more, from Fig. 7b, the Δη values after 312 h for the unencapsulated C-PSCs with MWCNT, graphene and CNC, were 35.3%, 43.4%, and 61.6%, respectively. The best performance retention under constant heat stress was observed in the MWCNT-based device, which was attributed to the better thermal stability of the MWCNT materials, in good agreement with the above resistance–temperature test (Fig. 6a–c). Hence, it can be concluded that MWCNT might be a more eligible source for the back C-electrode in HTL-free PSCs in terms of long-term stability. It is noteworthy that the PSCs (with the same perovskite photo-absorber layer and SnO2 ETL) with spiro-OMeTAD HTL and Au electrode suffered a rather rapid degradation when measured under the same conditions (the results have been reported previously20,56); to be specific, the Δη value for the humid-stability test after 400 h was 57.7%, the Δη value for the thermal-stability test after 200 h was 48%. More extensive stability investigations under various stress conditions and degradation mechanisms induced by omnifarious stress factors will be systematically reported in our following paper.

Experimental
Preparation of liquid suspensions containing various carbon sources
All the nest-structured MWCNTs (inner diameter: 10–20 nm, outer diameter: 30–50 nm, and length: 0.5–2 μm), and the N-doped graphene powder (diameter: 0.5–5 μm and specific surface area >500 m2 g−1) in our work were purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd, and were dispersed directly in isopropanol solution for spray coating of carbon electrode without further extra processes. The N-doped graphene powder has been commonly exploited in many aspects.57 The CNC was synthesized using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method at atmospheric pressure with porous α-Fe2O3/SnO2 as the catalyst.58 The main characterization studies (e.g. morphology, Raman analysis etc.) of graphene and CNC materials can be found in ref. 57 and 58. 15 mg of MWCNT and CNC were dispersed into 5 mL anhydrous isopropanol solvent (the proportion is 3 mg for 1 mL), respectively. In addition, we dispersed 10 mg of graphene into 5 mL anhydrous isopropanol solvent (the proportion is 2 mg for 1 mL). Subsequently, these suspensions were ground through ball-milling for 6 h. Then the final homogeneous isopropanol suspension liquid containing various carbon sources were obtained.
Device fabrication
The schematic device architecture and the fabrication process of the C-based HTL-free PSCs with a modular design are shown in Fig. 1. Primarily, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass samples were thoroughly cleaned with cleaning fluid, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, sequentially. For semi-cell A, SnO2 was spin-coated on FTO at 3000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 200 °C for 30 min in the air. The triple cation mixed perovskite films with the composition of Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 was prepared as the light capture layer. The details on the preparation of the mixed precursor solution have been presented in our previous reports.35,37,38 The mixed perovskite film was deposited using a one-step anti-solvent process, 55 μL of mixed perovskite precursor solution was spread on the ETL through a two-step spin coating process (1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s). And then 250 μL of α,α,α-trifluorotoluene was poured on the spinning substrate for 15 s prior to the end of the second step program. Finally, the substrate was heated on a hotplate at 100 °C for 40 min. For the C-electrode of the device, we directly sprayed the isopropanol dispersion of carbon materials containing various carbon materials on the perovskite film. Through a thorough comparison of various carbon suspensions, the appropriate carbon amounts for semi-cell A are 300 μL (MWCNT), 150 μL (CNC) and 300 μL (graphene), respectively. For the charge collector B, we sprayed 150 μL of isopropanol dispersion of carbon material on FTO. All spraying processes proceeded on a 85 °C hotplate to speed up solvent evaporation, then, charge collector B was obtained. Ultimately, modular C-PSC was assembled by stacking semi-cell A and charge collector B together without extra processing.
Characterization
The crystallographic characterization studies of the perovskite film and FTO/SnO2 substrate were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a LabXRD-6000 (Cu Kα, λ = 0.154056 nm). The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8020) is used for the observation of perovskite film micro-structures. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a the FLS1000 fluorescence spectrometer. A xenon lamp (EPL375) with a wavelength of 375 nm and a power density of 75 mW cm−2 was used as excitation for the measurement, and the excitation light was incident through the glass side for the PL and TRPL measurements. The temperature-resistance characteristic of the carbon film was studied though the assembly device combining a temperature control table (SI-TZ200) and an LCR digital electric bridge (ZJ2810B); two probes are fixed at a constant distance of 1 cm. The Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were obtained using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi. He I (21.22 eV) photon lines were used for excitation and the work function was calculated by locating the position of the cut-off energy and Fermi edge. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2450 digital source meter under simulated illumination (AM1.5 G,100 mW cm−2) at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1, and all J–V curves were obtained under reverse scan conditions. During the J–V test, the devices were covered using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 1.0 cm2. All EIS, EQE and dark I–V measurements were performed via an electrochemical work station (Zennium Zahner, Germany). Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at 0.3 V forward bias and with 20 mV amplitude of AC perturbation ranging from 100 MHz to 2 MHz. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out in AC mode with a frequency of 5000 Hz. The stability of the PSCs without encapsulation was investigated by periodically recording photovoltaic parameters; meanwhile, the samples were kept under actual ambient conditions at room temperature without intentionally controlling humidity (relative humidity: ∼60%, temperature: ∼30 °C) or vacuum drying oven conditions (temperature: 85 °C).
Conclusions
In conclusion, modular HTL-free C-PSCs were assembled by the lamination of two independently processed half-stacks of the semi-cell A and the charge collector B, where the C-electrodes were processed using a simple low temperature (85 °C) spray coating technique. Among the three typical carbon sources (MWCNT, CNC, and graphene), MWCNT was identified as the best candidate for application as the back electrode in HTL-free C-PSCs. There are several advantages: (i) excellent hole extraction ability, as proved by the PL and TRPL measurements; (ii) well-aligned band alignment with respect to the underneath perovskite layer; and (iii) superior electrical conductivity and thermal stability. Moreover, the mechanism for the advanced modular interconnection architecture was elucidated with the equivalent circuit model and P–N junction diode model. Remarkably, an improved PCE of 11.2% was achieved for modular MWCNT-based PSCs with a large active area device (1 cm2), and much improved thermal and humidity stabilities were also demonstrated. Our achievement demonstrates the irreplaceable role of tri-functional MWCNT in C-based HTL-free PSCs with the integrated function of (i) back electrode; (ii) hole extraction and collection; and (iii) excellent moisture barrier. Ultimately, our work provides a promising strategy to achieve the true potential of metal halide perovskites as the next generation game-changing PV technology.
