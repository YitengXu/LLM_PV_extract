    , Accepted 8th September 2016First published on 8th September 2016AbstractAn acylhydrazone zinc porphyrin P1 and its coordination polymers (CPs, denoted as P1M, M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) with different metal ions (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) were synthesized. Then these coordination polymers were assembled into bilayer structured supramolecular chromophores through axially coordinating with anchoring porphyrin AP, and their performance in dye sensitized solar cells was investigated. Our results reveal that the bilayer structured supramolecular chromophore based solar cells show significantly improved photocurrent conversion efficiency. Particularly, P1Mn and P1Zn based solar cells showed a relatively higher short circuit current density (JSC) due to their broad absorption bands and remarkable light harvesting abilities. Meanwhile, the VOC values of the cells fabricated with the bilayered chromophores slightly decreased. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in combination with charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements indicates that the decreased VOC resulted from the vigorous electron recombination and the downward shifted conduction band edge (ECB) of titania.
1. Introduction
Looking for alternative, environmentally friendly and renewable sources of energy is of great importance to meet the increasing demand for energy in the world. Solar energy is a kind of clean and renewable energy resource which has been widely utilized. A convenient approach to make use of solar energy is converting it into electricity. Much effort has been made to improve the solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiencies. In this field, since Grätzel and co-workers’ first invention in 1991,1 dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become a kind of promising photovoltaics and have attracted considerable attention. In these solar cells, dyes are the key components absorbing photons and transferring to photocurrent.2 For the past twenty years, various dyes such as ruthenium mixed-polypyridyl complexes,3 porphyrin derivatives,2a,b,4 metal-free organic molecules,5 natural dyes6 and co-sensitized dyes containing two or more than two kinds of chromophores7 have been intensely investigated and applied in DSSCs.
Porphyrins and their derivatives have superior advantages like intense absorption in the visible region, ease of adjusting the molecular structure for photoelectric properties as well as high photochemical and electrochemical stabilities, making them the high-potential candidates of DSSC sensitizers.8 Generally, such porphyrin dyes are monomers and are currently regarded as donor–π bridge-acceptor (D–π-A) molecules, wherein a carboxylic or cyanoacrylic moiety is usually used as an acceptor or anchoring group attached onto the titania surface.9 The defect of such monomer porphyrin dyes is that the synthesis process of these porphyrins is complicated and high-cost, which limited their extensive application.
The use of coordination interactions to construct supramolecular donor–acceptor systems is a facile and efficient way for the construction of complex multicomponent structures with characteristic photoelectric properties.10 As for the porphyrin based coordination system, axial ligands bearing a pyridine ring can coordinate to the central metal ion of the porphyrin as the electron acceptor. Sufficient research suggested that such a donor–acceptor structure can produce a stable charge separating state and cause effective electron transfer from the porphyrin donor to the axial ligand.10b–e,11 This approach makes it possible that the electron donor porphyrin and the electron acceptor can be optimized independently, therefore designing and synthesizing of the dyes with diverse structures and functions will become much easier and more convenient. Therefore, a large amount of studies on such axial-coordination-assisted porphyrin dyad systems with good photoelectric and photophysical properties has been reported.11 Furthermore, such a dyad complex can be expanded to a more advanced supramolecular system with multiple electron donors and acceptors by the coordination connection of metal ions in porphyrin coordination polymers. Nevertheless, studies focusing on porphyrin coordination polymer based dyes are very few.
Our previous work committed to select appropriate anchoring molecules along with outstanding donor porphyrins including monomer porphyrin and porphyrin based coordination polymers.12 In this work, we have synthesized a zinc porphyrin ligand P1 featuring an acylhydrazone Schiff base structure (Fig. 1), then its coordination polymers (CPs) with different metal ions (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) were prepared. These porphyrin CPs are immobilized onto TiO2 electrode surfaces through axially coordinating with anchoring porphyrin AP, where AP was synthesized in our previous work,12c to build bilayer structured supramolecular light harvesting arrays. Subsequently, the sensitized TiO2 electrodes were fabricated into solar cells. The effect of different metal ions of the porphyrin CPs in DSSCs was tested. The schematic axial coordination mode of the porphyrin CPs and anchoring porphyrin AP is shown in Fig. 2.

2. Experimental section
The specific synthetic procedures of zinc porphyrin ligand P1 and its coordination polymers P1M are described in the ESI.† The detailed cell fabrication methods were illustrated in our previous work.12d The bilayer-sensitized titania photoanode was prepared following two steps: (1) a circular nanostructured TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was firstly immersed into a solution of anchoring porphyrin AP (∼2 mM) in CHCl3/CH3OH overnight, then the unbound anchoring porphyrins were washed out with methanol, and (2) the TiO2 electrode that had already absorbed AP was immersed, for the second time, into a dye solution containing porphyrin coordination polymers P1M (∼1 mM) in CHCl3/CH3OH for 2 h to construct the second layer of the supramolecular chromophores. Afterward, the bilayer-sensitized titania electrode was washed with acetonitrile solution three times, dried by air flow and fabricated into solar cells.
UV-vis spectra were recorded by using a UV-2550 spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded using an LS-55 (PE USA Inc) fluorescence spectrophotometer. SEM-EDS experiments were carried out using an Ultra Plus scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) in combination with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). The current density–voltage (J–V) plots and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were obtained under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) by using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2. The detailed photoelectrochemical measurements including charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) have been illustrated by Prof. P. Wang and co-workers.13 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were acquired by using a CHI660 electrochemical workstation, applying a bias voltage at −0.5 V in the dark, with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz and an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The obtained spectra were fitted with ZSimpWin software in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit.14
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photophysical properties
Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of AP, P1, and CP P1M in CHCl3 solutions. As shown in Fig. S1,† these porphyrins display typical porphyrin spectra:15 intensive absorption bands (Soret bands) located in the region of 400–500 nm and several moderate Q bands appeared in the long wavelength region of 550–650 nm. Notably, the absorption bands of the CP P1M are significantly broadened along with an increase in the Q bands compared to their corresponding monomer P1, suggesting that the metal ions in the CPs have a dominant impact on broadening and increasing the absorption bands.
The absorption spectra of these CPs immobilized on the TiO2 surface (P1M + AP, M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) by anchoring porphyrin AP through the axial-coordination approach are shown in Fig. 3. Compared with the absorption in solution, the absorption bands of P1M + AP attached onto the TiO2 surface are much more broadened with a remarkable increase in Q bands. Generally, a stronger absorption intensity results in a higher light harvesting efficiency (LHE), so we calculated the LHE value of these chromophores according to a literature report,16 the results are displayed in Fig. 4. The LHE values of the porphyrin CP based TiO2 films are prominently higher than that of single porphyrin AP and P1 + AP, and rank in a sequence of P1Mn + AP > P1Zn + AP > P1Co + AP ≈ P1Ni + AP > P1Cu + AP. Such variation in LHE is mainly attributed to the difference in their respective absorption spectra. Moreover, the higher light harvesting efficiency of P1Mn + AP is the key factor for its relatively higher short circuit current density (JSC).

Fig. S2† shows the fluorescence spectra of the dyes in CHCl3 solution and attached onto TiO2 films. When joining P1M onto the TiO2 surface viaAP, the fluorescence intensities of all the chromophores including AP and P1M + AP were dramatically decreased, even almost quenched, and blue shifted. The blue shifts are related to the J-type aggregation of porphyrins on the TiO2 surface.17 The decreased fluorescence intensities mainly result from two reasons: (1) the existence of charge transfer between the porphyrin CPs and AP through the donor–acceptor axial coordination interaction and (2) the increased non-radiative transition caused by dye aggregation.
3.2 Characterization of the sensitized TiO2 surface
The FT-IR spectra of AP in solid and after adsorption on the TiO2 surface are displayed in Fig. S3.† When the molecules of AP are bound to TiO2, the vibration of carboxylate at 1637 cm−1 disappeared and no signal of pyridine bonding was observed. This result demonstrated that the carboxylic acid group of AP is prior to bind with TiO2 as anchoring group, and the pyridine unit could connect the porphyrin CPs via axially coordinating. Similar results were observed in our previous work and elsewhere.12a,18
To clearly understand the assemble situation of the porphyrin CPs at the TiO2 surface, SEM-EDS analysis was carried out to investigate the morphology and composition of the P1Mn + AgAP modified TiO2 surface, wherein AgAP was synthesized in our previous work12c and has the same chemical structure as AP except that the central Zn atom was replaced by Ag. The AgAP employed here as anchoring porphyrin was to distinguish the element Zn in the coordination polymers so we can identify the amount of the anchoring porphyrin on the TiO2 surface.

Fig. 5 shows the SEM-EDS plane scan analysis of the P1Mn + AgAP sensitized TiO2 interface, as presented in the figure, the nanostructured TiO2 surface was completely covered by the porphyrin based bilayer structured supramolecular chromophores, demonstrating that the porphyrin CPs were effectively immobilized onto the TiO2 surface by axial coordination connection of AP. Simultaneously, the mass fractions (wt%) of the elements Ag, Zn, and Mn at the TiO2 interface are measured to be 1.66%, 0.36%, and 0.27% respectively. The molar ratio of elements Ag, Zn, and Mn was calculated to be Ag:Zn:Mn = 3.1:1.2:1, where the composition of Ag represents the amount of anchoring porphyrin and the composition of Zn and Mn indicates the amount of CP P1Mn on the TiO2 surface, suggesting that the anchoring porphyrins are the primary part of the bilayer structured chromophore and have the largest amount. Similar characteristics were observed in the P1 + AgAP sensitized TiO2 interface presented in Fig. S4.†

3.3 Photovoltaic properties
The IPCE spectra of the cells fabricated with P1M + AP in the wavelength range of 350–650 nm are shown in Fig. 6. The variation in the IPCE spectra of the dyes is approximately consistent with their corresponding absorption spectra and LHE curves. All the cells based on bilayer structured chromophores have higher IPCE values and a broader photoresponse compared to the monolayer AP based cells; in other words, the photoresponse of the cells was reinforced when the monomer P1 or its coordination polymer P1M was immobilized onto the TiO2 surface via a coordination bond to construct a bilayered chromophore, suggesting that electron injection from the supramolecular array to the TiO2 surface is capable and feasible upon photoexcitation. Moreover, the P1M + AP based solar cells have higher IPCE values than the cells fabricated with P1 + AP dyes; this was attributed to the increased UV-vis absorption and LHE value of the CPs.
 Fig. 6  IPCE values of AP, P1 + AP and P1M + AP based solar cells. 
The absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (APCE) of the dyes related to electron injection and charge collection efficiency are calculated by using the equation APCE(λ) = IPCE(λ)/LHE(λ) and the results are depicted in Fig. S5.† The APCE values about 70%–90% are achieved for all the P1M + AP based chromophores, suggesting an effective charge injection process. The APCE value lower than 100% may be attributed to the charge recombination between the photoinjected electrons and the oxidized species in the electrolyte.
The current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the solar cells based on the porphyrin CPs are shown in Fig. 7. The detailed data are listed in Table 1. Compared to the monolayer AP based cells, the solar cells based on the bilayer structured chromophores displayed a 1.2–3.1 mA cm−2 increased current density due to their favourable light harvesting capability. Disappointedly, the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the bilayer chromophore based solar cells showed an unwelcoming drop of different extent. The drastic VOC drop in combination with a poor photoelectric response results in a relatively lower efficiency of the cells fabricated with P1Co + AP, P1Ni + AP and P1Cu + AP. The P1Mn + AP and P1Zn + AP based cells exhibit better performance than others, that is P1Mn + AP based cells have the highest JSC and P1Zn + AP based solar cells have the highest VOC among the devices fabricated with porphyrin CPs, mainly attributed to their higher LHE and more feasible electron injection. This result revealed that Mn and Zn are more suitable metals for porphyrin CP based solar cells with better performance.

The dark current of the porphyrin CP based solar cells was also measured to investigate the charge recombination behaviour at the TiO2 surface. As shown in Fig. 7, the dark current of the solar cells fabricated with bilayer chromophores increased at a lower potential bias, suggesting that the P1 + AP and P1M + AP based solar cells have higher electron recombination rate than monolayer AP based cells. In particular, the fast electron recombination rate of the P1Co + AP, P1Ni + AP and P1Cu + AP based cells is mainly responsible for their relatively lower efficiencies.
As is well known, the VOC of a DSSC is dominated by the electron quasi-Fermi-level of titania. Furthermore, the decrease in both the conduction band (ECB) of TiO2 and the electron density in TiO2 can cast down the electron quasi-Fermi-level,19 leading to a drop in VOC. In addition, the high-speed charge recombination at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface will reduce the electron density in titania. Hence the changes of the TiO2 conduction band and charge recombination situation strongly influence the VOC of a DSSC. So we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in combination with charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements to gain a deeper insight into the VOC variation in the solar cells based on the porphyrin CPs.
3.4 EIS measurements
The impedance spectra including the Nyquist (a) and Bode plots (b) of AP, P1 + AP, P1Mn + AP and P1Zn + AP fabricated solar cells are shown in Fig. 8. As shown in the Nyquist plots, the larger semicircle corresponds to the charge recombination impedance at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface,20 where the radius of the semicircle represents the charge recombination resistance (RCT in the equivalency circuit) at the TiO2 surface. It is obvious that the charge recombination resistance (RCT) value of the monolayer AP based cell is higher than that of the bilayer sensitized cells, indicating that the charge recombination of bilayer sensitized cells is more serious. The larger RCT, from another point of view, will suppress the charge recombination between the photoinduced electrons and the oxides in the electrolyte, giving rise to a higher VOC. In the Bode plots (Fig. 8b), the peaks appearing at 103–104 Hz are related to the electron lifetime at the TiO2 surface. Generally, a fast charge recombination rate results in a short electron lifetime, and makes the phase degree peak in the bode plot shift to a higher frequency region. It is clear that the bilayer sensitized solar cells have a shorter electron lifetime compared to the monolayer AP based cells, consistent with their relatively lower VOC. The charge recombination resistance of P1Zn + AP based cells is higher than that of P1Mn + AP based cells, resulting in a higher VOC of the former. These results were also confirmed by charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements.

3.5 Charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements
The results investigated by charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements are shown in Fig. 9. The bilayer supramolecular chromophore sensitized solar cells exhibit a less extracted charge (QCE) at a certain potential bias or VOC compared to the monolayer AP sensitized cells, which means that the titania conduction-band edge (ECB) in the bilayer sensitized cells negatively shifted with respect to the Femi level of redox couples in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 9  (a) Plots of the charge quantity of the sensitized titania film (QCE) as a function of VOC. (b) Plots of electron half lifetimes as a function of QCE. 
The downward shifted ECB is one of the main reasons that caused the drop in VOC of the bilayer supramolecular chromophore sensitized cells. Another reason is, as described in Fig. 9b, the fast charge recombination rate which would lead to a shorter lifetime of the photoinjected electrons in TiO2 at a given QCE. This is understandable by considering that the second layer of porphyrin CPs keeps the redox couples in the electrolyte away from the inside anchoring porphyrin layer attached to the TiO2 surface, retarding the regeneration of the oxidized dyes and then reducing the lifetime of the photoinjected electrons.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a zinc porphyrin ligand P1 featuring an acylhydrazone Schiff base structure; then its coordination polymers with different metal ions (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) were prepared and assembled into bilayer supramolecular chromophores through axially coordinating with anchoring porphyrin AP. The performance of these supramolecular light harvesting arrays in DSSCs was examined. The morphology and composition of the sensitized titania electrode were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The cell performance of the bilayer structured chromophores in dye sensitized solar cells was investigated, and the results suggest that the bilayer sensitized nanostructured TiO2 surfaces significantly improved photocurrent conversion due to their broad absorption bands and remarkable light harvesting abilities. Additionally, the VOC values of the cells fabricated with the bilayered chromophores are slightly decreased. The decreased VOC was attributed to the serious electron recombination at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and the downward shifted ECB of titania.
Compared to the latest high-efficiency DSSCs, the overall cell performance of the porphyrin CP based solar cells is still rather low and needs improvement. This is mainly caused by the small amount of porphyrins loaded on the TiO2 surface and the absorption deficiency of porphyrins in the wavelength range of 450–550 nm. Further work should have a comprehensive consideration on improving the cell performance and focus on looking for porphyrin CPs with broad and intensive absorption in the UV-visible range, and efficient charge separation to transfer electrons to anchoring porphyrin then TiO2. Besides, as an electron acceptor, the anchoring porphyrin should have an appropriate energy level and should be firm in combination with both TiO2 and porphyrin CPs to ensure effective electron injection.
Overall, we have developed a novel self-assembled supramolecular light harvesting array based on porphyrin coordination polymers. Such a systematical coordination approach has prominent advantages over monomolecular DSSCs though it showed temporary poor performance.
