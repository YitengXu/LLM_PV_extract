    , Accepted 8th May 2015First published on 11th May 2015AbstractCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated with titanium oxide (TiO2) have generated considerable interest over the last decade and become a promising nanomaterial for a wide range of energy applications. The efficient use of the outstanding electrical properties of this nanostructure relies heavily on the quality of the interface and the thickness and morphology of the TiO2 layer. However, complete surface coverage of the chemically inert CNTs and appropriate control of the morphology of the TiO2 layer have not been achieved so far. Here, we report a new strategy to obtain ultrathin TiO2 coatings deposited by “Temperature-step” Atomic Layer Deposition (TS-ALD) with complete surface coverage of non-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and controlled morphology and crystallinity of the TiO2 film. This strategy consists of adjusting the temperature during the ALD deposition to obtain the desired morphology. Complete coverage of long non-functionalized MWCNTs with conformal anatase layers was obtained by using a low temperature of 60 °C during the nucleation stage followed by an increase to 220 °C during the growth stage. This resulted in a continuous and amorphous TiO2 layer, covered with a conformal anatase coating. Starting with the deposition at 220 °C and reducing to 60 °C resulted in sporadic crystal grains at the CNT/TiO2 interface covered with an amorphous TiO2 layer. The results were accomplished through an extensive study of nucleation and growth of titanium oxide films on MWCNTs, of which a detailed characterization is presented in this work.
Introduction
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated with titanium oxide (TiO2) have become a promising hybrid nanomaterial for a wide range of applications from photocatalysis,1–5 gas sensors,6–8 to dye-sensitized solar cells9–12 and energy storage.13 These nanostructures combine the high surface area and excellent thermal and electrical conductivity of the CNTs with the high photoactivity, chemical stability, environmentally friendly character and versatility of TiO2. The outstanding electrical properties of these nanocomposites, specifically the improved electron charge transport for efficient collection, is largely controlled by the quality of the interface between them, as well as the structural and morphological properties of the metal oxide coating.14 Recent studies which have incorporated CNT/TiO2 nanostructures for a hybrid photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells have proved the approach to be a promising alternative to enhance the charge transport kinetics of electrons towards the current collector.15–18 This is accomplished by taking advantage of the high electrical conductivity of the CNTs to use them as electron highways. However, only small improvements of the energy conversion efficiency have been achieved, mainly because of the short circuit and high recombination rates caused by the exposed surfaces of the CNTs to the electrolyte. Exposed surfaces of the CNTs – resulting from the poor coverage of the metal oxide – act as leakage pathways for electrons traveling through the CNTs, leading to a decrease of the overall electrical performance of the nanomaterial.19 For this reason, complete surface coverage of the CNTs and a high quality interface between these materials are needed. Carbon nanotubes are generally known among other features for their chemically inert surfaces. The chemically inert carbon walls restrict the nucleation of a TiO2 coating, leading to poor coverage of the CNTs. It is generally accepted that nucleation and growth of metal oxides initiate preferably at defect sites of the CNTs, where OH groups can chemisorb.20,21 For this reason, chemical and/or physical pre-treatments of CNTs are common methods to improve the TiO2 coverage by introducing new functional groups and/or defects.22,23 However, these defects introduce more recombination sites for electrons and holes, and it has been proven to be detrimental to the original electrical properties of the CNTs.24,25 The deposition technique and process parameters play a crucial role in controlling not only the coverage of the CNTs but also the crystal structure, thickness, and morphology of the metal oxide layer. Therefore, a process that induces the least amount of structural damage to the as-prepared CNTs is desired to maintain their inherent electrical conductivity, as well as to ensure complete coverage of the CNT surface in order to prevent electrons traveling through the CNT to leak through the uncoated surfaces.
Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) offers several advantages in the deposition of TiO2 on CNTs compared with other more common techniques (e.g., sol–gel and hydrothermal deposition) such as homogeneous and conformal coatings with a controlled thickness at an atomic level on geometrically complex nanostructures with high aspect ratios.26,27 Most of the previous studies of ALD TiO2 coated carbon nanotubes have used functionalization methods prior to deposition. These studies have reported homogeneous amorphous films at low temperatures16,22,28–30 and rough anatase surfaces at high temperatures.30 To the best of our knowledge, only a few reports have used non-functionalized CNTs. Zhang et al. have reported incomplete coverage of the CNTs at 200 °C with crystalline TiO2 until a ∼20 nm-thick rough film coalesced, leading to good coverage of the pristine CNTs.21 TiO2 deposited at 100 °C using TDMAT and O3 resulted in poor coverage of the carbon nanotubes.31 Recently, Hsu et al. showed homogeneous films of ALD TiO2 using TiCl4 for photodetection devices, however, there is no analysis of the ALD deposition process.32
In this study, we used non-functionalized vertically aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes (va-MWCNTs) and studied the nucleation and growth of TiO2 films deposited by ALD using Titanium Tetra-Isopropoxide (TTIP) and water. Understanding how TiO2 nucleates and grows on the carbon walls at different temperatures led us to a simple strategy to control the TiO2 coverage on the CNTs and the morphology and crystallinity of the film. This strategy consists of adjusting the temperature at the different stages of nucleation and growth. The resulting films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Experimental
Synthesis of va-MWCNTs
A 20 nm-thick film of Al2O3 was deposited via atomic layer deposition on a bare Si wafer as a support and then a 2 nm-thick film of Fe was deposited via e-beam evaporation atop as a catalyst. Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) growth was carried out in a cold-wall CVD reactor (Black Magic™, Aixtron). A catalyst substrate was loaded in the CVD chamber, evacuated below 200 mbar and then heated up to 770 °C at 300 °C min−1, with 600 sccm of H2 and 400 sccm of Ar flow rate. After annealing at the same temperature for 15 min, an additional C2H4 (150 sccm) was turned on to start growth at 720 mbar total pressure. Upon completion of the growth step, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature under an Ar atmosphere. The va-MWCNTs had a length of ∼150 μm.
The va-MWCNTs grown on Si substrates are far easier to use in ALD coatings and different characterization techniques compared to other formats such as powder. In addition, they can be easily transferred to FTO substrates by a simple stamping technique9 for future electrical characterization and device fabrication.
Deposition of ALD TiO2
The samples were transferred into a built-in ALD reactor. Deposition of TiO2 on va-MWCNTs was performed at a reactor temperature of 60 °C, 120 °C, and 220 °C with an alternating precursor mixture of Titanium Tetra-Isopropoxide (TTIP) Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 heated to 90 °C and H2O at 40 °C. The vapour delivery lines leading to the reactor were maintained at 90 °C. One ALD cycle consisting of a TTIP pulse of 10 s was followed by a 40 s exposure to ensure more than enough time for diffusion and chemisorption, and then purging was done with Ar for 60 s. Afterwards, H2O was pulsed for 8 s with an exposure time of 40 s and purging of 60 s was done. The Ar flow was set to 50 sccm for both pulsing and purging steps which gave a background pressure of 0.26 mbar. The pulsing times used for TTIP and water ensured the complete coverage of TiO2 from the top to the bottom of the va-MWCNTs. Shorter pulsing times did not completely coat the long va-MWCNTs down to the bottom. We found that shorter exposure times had no effect on the coverage of the CNTs; however, the exposure time aids to extend or reduce the total time-length of the experiment. For nucleation studies 20 cycles were performed and 300 cycles were performed to study the growth and morphology of TiO2.
Based on the results obtained from these parameters, Temperature-step (TS) experiments were performed with the same cycle times but the temperature changed during the deposition of 300 cycles as follows. TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C: 60 °C for the first 60 cycles (1–60), 120 °C for the next 60 cycles (61–120), and 220 °C for the remaining 180 cycles (121–300). TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C: 220 °C for the first 30 cycles (1–30), and changed to 60 °C for the remaining 170 cycles (31–300); the temperature at the reactor reached 60 °C at the 50th cycle.
Characterization of va-MWCNT/TiO2
SEM images of the cross-section were acquired using a high resolution scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800, Japan) after cleaving the samples in half and analysing the cross-section.
TEM samples were prepared by dispersing the CNTs in methanol, ultrasonicating for 5 minutes and pipetting a few droplets of the solution onto a carbon film. TEM was conducted on a JEOL2200FX microscope operated at 200 keV. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) imaging and selected area diffraction patterns (SADP) were performed in the TEM mode. Bright field (BF) and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging were performed in the scanning TEM (STEM) mode. A short exposure time was used to avoid beam-induced damage or phase transformation.
Raman spectroscopy was performed under dry conditions using an upright Raman microscope (Nova Spectra, ND-MDT, Russia) featuring a laser source with a wavelength of 532 nm and a 50× objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.75. Spectra were recorded at a spectral resolution of 2.7 cm−1 and the exposure time was 30 s for all the samples. The use of a neutral density filter maintained the laser power below 100 μW so that it does not induce phase transformation of TiO2 or modify the MWCNT bands.33 We observed induced phase transformation of amorphous TiO2 into anatase by increasing the laser power to ∼2.6 mW. All the peaks were fitted with a Lorentzian function.
XPS measurements were performed in a Quantum2000 from Physical Electronics using a monochromatized Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The X-ray spot had a diameter of 150 μm and operated at a power of 30 W at 15 kV. A neutralizer gun was used at 1.3 V and 20 μA. The core level spectra were fitted using a nonlinear least-squares line shape analysis after subtraction of a Shirley background. The spectra were aligned to the characteristic asymmetric peak of graphite structures at 284 eV, and a FWHM of 0.98 eV and 1.1 eV was used for sp2 and sp3 species, respectively.34–36 All the components were fitted using a Gaussian–Lorentzian line-shape except for the sp2 component, in which an asymmetric Doniach–Sunjic (DS) line-shape was used.37
Results and discussion
Nucleation of TiO2 on MWCNTs
In our previous work, we showed that the nucleation density of TiO2 on MWCNTs decreases with increasing temperature, in the investigated range of 160 °C–240 °C.21
From this premise, we investigated even lower ALD deposition temperatures, namely 60 °C and 120 °C, to compare the nucleation behaviour with a high temperature of 220 °C, which is just below the decomposition temperature of TTIP.38 Low-temperature ALD that favours amorphous TiO2 has not been widely investigated, perhaps because the anatase phase is desired for many applications. Fig. 1 shows the coverage of 20 ALD cycles of TiO2 at the aforementioned temperatures.
 Fig. 1  Nucleation density of 20 cycles of ALD TiO2 on va-MWCNTs at different temperatures. The STEM-BF (top) and HAADF (bottom) images show that the nucleation density decreases as the deposition temperature increases. The bright contrast in the HAADF images is TiO2. 
At a deposition temperature of 60 °C a semi conformal and continuous thin layer can already be observed with a thickness of ∼1.3 ± 0.2 nm which covers most of the MWCNTs. The high-angle annular dark field (TEM-HAADF) image of the 60 °C sample shows a continuous layer of TiO2 (represented by the bright materials contrast) covering the MWCNT (dark region). To the best of our knowledge, this layer could be the thinnest and most conformal film of TiO2 on a MWCNT that has been reported till date. At 120 °C, several nuclei of ∼1.4 ± 0.2 nm thickness and up to 3.5 nm lateral size were deposited along the MWCNT. The TEM-HAADF image for this temperature shows uncovered CNT regions (dark) partially covered with half-ellipsoidal TiO2 nuclei (bright). We calculated ∼0.08 nuclei per nm2. The deposition of TiO2 at 220 °C shows only sporadic nuclei with a more spherical shape of ∼1.8 ± 0.5 nm decorating the MWCNT with ∼0.07 nuclei per nm2.
At high temperatures, the observed TiO2 decoration functions as labelling points for defect sites, however, for low temperatures this is not the case. These results clearly indicate that effective coverage of TiO2 is not only limited to the initial defect density of the MWCNTs. More TEM images for the deposition at 60 °C are presented in Fig. S1.† Furthermore, the contact angle of the nuclei increases with deposition temperature and describes the subsequent growth mode. At 60 °C, we obtained a uniform and continuous coverage of TiO2 along the MWCNTs, whereas at higher temperature, this lack of continuity enabled an island growth. Marichy et al. observed similar sporadic TiO2 nuclei at 200 °C which nucleated at the defects of the MWCNTs and attributed this effect to the defect density of the MWCNTs.22 Meng et al. also reported similar nuclei at 250 °C which grew and then coalesced as the number of cycles increased, displaying also the anatase phase; nonetheless their CNTs were functionalized.30 The deposition at 60 °C and 120 °C did not show any sign of crystallinity as expected at these low temperatures. At 220 °C we have observed crystalline TiO2 nuclei (Fig. S2†).21
Raman spectroscopy was performed on the MWCNTs before and after the deposition of 20 cycles of TiO2. Fig. 2a shows the characteristic Raman-active modes of the MWCNTs in the region from 1000 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1 at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The G mode (∼1586 cm−1) is due to planar vibrations from the hexagonal lattice of sp2 carbon atoms of the MWCNTs. The D mode (∼1343 cm−1) corresponds to the amount of structural defects/disorder, such as amorphous carbon, vacancies and heteroatoms in the 2D hexagonal lattice. The D mode is also used as an indication of sp2 to sp3 transition of functionalized carbon atoms, and the D′ mode (∼1620 cm−1) can arise from externally induced defects such as bending of the inner/outer cylinders or by physical/chemical functionalization treatments.39–41 The ratio between the D- and G-band (ID/IG) is widely used as an indication of the quality of the CNTs (i.e., structural imperfections) and the amount of sp3 hybridization after functionalization of the CNTs. The small ID/IG ratio of the pristine va-MWCNTs indicates a low defect density. After the nucleation of TiO2 there is an increase of the ID/IG ratio, which increased at lower deposition temperatures, being highest at 60 °C. It is important to note that temperature is not responsible for the increase of the D-band, as it has been shown that MWCNTs are stable in air up to 420 °C and up to 1300 °C in argon.42 Furthermore, the D- and G-bands remain unchanged up to a temperature of >400 °C.42,43 Therefore, the increase of the ID/IG ratio is due to the nucleation of TiO2 on the MWCNTs and not temperature. The ID/IG ratio increased from 0.46 for the pristine MWCNTs to 0.61 at a deposition temperature of 60 °C, and then it decreased to 0.58 at 120 °C and to 0.56 at 220 °C (Table 1). These results suggest a relatively high amount of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms at lower ALD temperatures. This is complemented by a red shift and broadening of the D-band, indicating altogether the stress build-up on the outer carbon walls of the CNTs by a close interaction with TiO2.44 The contraction of the lattice spacing due to the formation of C–O–Ti bonds stretches the in-plane covalent bonds that results in a red shift of the D- and G-bands.45–47 The maximum shift and the increase of FWHM is observed at an ALD deposition temperature of 60 °C, which exhibited the highest MWCNT coverage.
 Fig. 2  Interaction between the va-MWCNTs and TiO2 after 20 cycles at different deposition temperatures measured by (a) Raman spectroscopy and (b) XPS. Raman spectra show an increase of the ID/IG ratio with lower deposition temperatures which corresponds to the increase of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms and C–O species from the C 1s peak in the XPS spectra.

In addition, XPS measurements showed a higher atomic percentage of Ti deposited at 60 °C (∼5.3%) than at 120 °C (3.9%) and 220 °C (3.2%), from the ratio of Ti 2p, O 1s and C 1s. The XPS spectra of the C 1s peaks from Fig. 2b support the conclusion of an increase in the concentration of sp3 carbons and C–O bonding after ALD at low temperatures.
It is clear that the peaks where the sp3 carbons and C–O species are located increased in percentage with decreasing ALD deposition temperature. We do not disregard the fact that at low temperatures carbon ligands from the TTIP precursor might still remain in the TiO2 layer.48,49 In fact, it is known that alkoxide ligands from TTIP tend to form bridging structures50 which might be the cause leading to the uniform coverage at low temperatures. These ligands may have attached to the CNTs through the adsorption of the oxygen atom (of the alkoxide ligand) during the first cycles. The adsorption of this oxygen atom to a bare silicon surface has been reported to be more energetically stable than binding to a hydroxyl group.50
To clear these doubts, we show in Fig. 3, the Raman-active modes of one va-MWCNT sample subjected to 300 pulses of water alone, and other sample subjected to 20 pulses of TTIP alone, both at 60 °C. The Raman spectra clearly show an increase of the D-band and broadening of the G-band after 20 pulses of TTIP alone, meaning that TTIP is responsible for the sp3 hybridization of the carbon atoms of the CNTs. The va-MWCNTs subjected to 300 cycles of water alone showed no substantial difference compared to the pristine sample, hence water is not responsible for sp3 hybridization or C–O bonding (Fig. S6†). Therefore, the increase of the sp3 species from the C 1s peak at 60 °C is indeed caused by the sp2 to sp3 transition of the carbon atoms from the outer walls, and the C–O groups could be a combination of both the C–O–Ti bonding at the interface and from the remaining C–O–Ti bonds from the alkoxide ligands. The Raman and XPS measurements are consistent with the TEM observations where at lower deposition temperature, there is a higher coverage of the CNT surface and thus more sp2 carbons have been transformed into sp3, creating a C–O–Ti bonding at the interface.

Growth, morphology and crystallinity of TiO2 on MWNCTs
In Fig. 4, SEM and TEM images show the morphology and conformality of the titania layer on the va-MWCNTs after 300 cycles at different ALD temperatures. Interestingly, the most conformal and homogeneous film was obtained at a temperature of 60 °C with a thickness of ∼5 nm. At this temperature, the TiO2 film exhibited a layered growth which started from the continuous nuclei deposited during the nucleation stage. At 120 °C, the half-ellipsoidal nuclei grew into a nanoparticle network with a thickness variation of ∼7–9 nm along the va-MWCNTs which resulted in a type of a “pearl necklace” structure. The sporadically distributed nuclei deposited at 220 °C grew and coalesced, causing a rough morphology with a coating thickness as large as ∼17–23 nm. Nevertheless, at this temperature, we observed uncoated areas of the MWCNTs (Fig. S3†), while almost none were observed at the lower temperatures. EDX performed on the cross section of the ∼150 μm long va-WMCNTs confirms the TiO2 coverage from the top to the bottom (Fig. S4†). The homogeneous film obtained at 60 °C was entirely amorphous, as expected at this low temperature. The TiO2 nanoparticle network obtained at 120 °C presented crystalline inclusions on the amorphous base layer (Fig. S5†) and the selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) inset showed weak diffraction patterns. The rough TiO2 deposited at 220 °C is almost entirely anatase. At 220 °C, anatase crystal growth is thermodynamically favoured and initiated from the low density nuclei formed during the initial cycles and coalesced during growth. These observations are confirmed with Raman spectroscopy presented in the next sections. The measured GPC at 300 cycles increased from 60 °C (∼0.16 Å per cycle) to 120 °C (∼0.27 ± 0.03 Å per cycle) and to 220 °C (0.65 ± 0.1 Å per cycle), which are in line with the trend of the ALD window. However, the GPC values obtained at 120 °C and 220 °C are slightly higher than those reported in the literature.30,49,51,52

TEM images (right column) of individual MWCNTs showing the morphology and conformality, the inset shows the SADP from the corresponding sample. 
The low GPC at <200 °C has been explained by Aarik et al. as the low reactivity of water with TTIP.49 The high growth per cycle at high temperatures is attributed to a greater reactivity of TTIP with water in combination with a preferred crystal growth, as observed by recent studies.51–55 These studies demonstrated that the higher GPC observed at high temperatures is caused by the larger density of hydroxyl groups at the surface of the crystal. Consequently, Reiners et al. have also observed a preferential crystallization of TiO2 into anatase by extending the length of the ALD process even at low temperatures.52 Furthermore, Mitchell et al. observed that amorphous ALD TiO2 transforms into anatase with a post-deposition hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C in the lapse of one day.56 It is important to highlight that the length of our ALD experiments was on the order of ∼18 h for 300 cycles. The time–temperature dependence of anatase crystallization, which improves the hydroxyl group density and thus the GPC, explains why we have obtained anatase crystal inclusions at such a low temperature for crystallization of 120 °C and the higher GPC we observed compared to other studies.30,48,53 Therefore, adjusting the experimental time-length at a certain temperature can affect the crystallization behaviour and thus the GPC. It appears that low-temperature ALD using TTIP and water enables a better control of the thickness.
For many applications of CNT/TiO2 nanostructures the anatase phase is desired because of its higher photocatalytic activity.57,58 However, complete surface coverage of the CNTs is a must to prevent injected electrons to the CNTs from leaking through the uncoated surfaces, which obstructs their efficient collection. Therefore, complete coverage of the CNTs without any pre-functionalization treatment can only be achieved by ALD at low deposition temperatures during the nucleation stage. Nonetheless, higher temperatures are still required during the growth stage to obtain the anatase phase, that is, without requiring any post-deposition heat treatment.
Temperature-step ALD
From the results presented so far, we can conclude that the nucleation stage governs the initial coverage of TiO2 and influences the final morphology. Consequently, the temperature at the succeeding growth stage determines the crystallinity. Therefore, by adjusting the temperature in each of these stages during deposition, we can obtain the desired nanostructure.
To test these hypotheses, we performed two experiments using a “Temperature-step ALD” strategy (TS-ALD): (i) start the ALD deposition at 60 °C for the initial 60 cycles to deposit a conformal and continuous film to completely coat the carbon nanotubes. Then, during the ALD deposition, increase the temperature to 120 °C for the next 60 cycles to end at 220 °C for the remaining 180 cycles to obtain crystal growth (TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C). (ii) Start the deposition at 220 °C for the first 30 cycles to deposit sporadic crystalline TiO2 nuclei and then decrease the temperature to 60 °C for the remaining cycles to conformally coat the crystalline grains with amorphous TiO2 (TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C).
The resulting morphologies are presented in Fig. 5. The final morphology of the TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C sample consists of a conformal layer of TiO2 similar to the one obtained at 60 °C, and does not display a rough morphology that could have been caused as a result of the crystal growth from the 220 °C step.
 Fig. 5  Morphology of 300 cycles of TiO2 deposited by the Temperature-step process: TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C (left) and TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C (right). The SEM images (top) show the cross section of the va-MWCNTs and the TEM images (middle) show the morphology and conformality; the inset shows the SADP from the corresponding sample. The HR-TEM (left bottom) and STEM (right bottom) images show the interface between the amorphous and anatase TiO2 with the MWCNTs. 
Nevertheless, as the SADP inset shows, the sample displays crystalline diffraction patterns from the crystal growth step at 220 °C. The HR-TEM image shows an adhesion base layer of ∼4 nm-thick amorphous TiO2 deposited on the MWCNT and the interface with a ∼2.1 nm-thick anatase layer. The interplanar distance calculated from the lattice fringes is 0.33 nm which corresponds to the (101) lattice plane of the anatase phase. These images reveal that the crystal growth started from the conformal amorphous TiO2 base layer and followed the same initial conformal morphology. The temperature of 220 °C during the time-length of the remaining 180 cycles was not sufficient to crystallize the entire amorphous base layer, though it was enough to deposit crystalline materials at the surface. These results suggest that crystallization of TiO2 might be more dependent on time and temperature in comparison with a “critical thickness”, as suggested by other studies.52 On the other hand, the TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C sample displays a rather coarse layer with a thickness as large as ∼14–16 nm. The coarse morphology is caused by the crystalline grain decoration formed during the nucleation stage at 220 °C which was covered by a smooth amorphous layer deposited at 60 °C during the growth stage. The SADP inset shows crystalline diffraction patterns which probably originate from the embedded crystal grains on the amorphous matrix. The STEM-HAADF image shows these crystalline nuclei (darker regions) at the interface with the CNT and an amorphous layer as the coating. Remarkably, the thicknesses obtained for both TS-ALD processes are similar to those results where the temperature used during the nucleation stage was kept constant during the whole process, such as 60 °C (5 nm) and 220 °C (∼16–17.6 nm). Correspondingly, the measured thickness of 6.1 nm (TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C) and ∼14–16 nm (TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C) do not coincide with the expected thicknesses of ∼11.7 nm and ∼7.3 nm, respectively (based on the isothermal GPC values given in the previous section). To elaborate, the expected thickness can be simplified as:T = cycles (T1) GPC (T1) + cycles (T2) GPC (T2) + cycles (T3) GPC (T3)…where, T is the expected thickness of the added thicknesses obtained at each temperature-step. A detailed discussion is presented in the ESI.† To summarize, we have concluded that the difference in thickness is largely controlled by the first deposited layer, in this case, the amorphous TiO2 and the crystalline grains deposited for TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C and TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C, respectively. There is a competition between amorphous and crystal growth which affects the GPC. The amorphous TiO2 base layer delayed the formation of an ordered anatase layer. Without crystallization there is no increase of hydroxyl groups at the crystal surface51,52 and therefore, no enhancement of the GPC. The opposite occurred to the TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C sample. Hence, by adjusting the number of cycles and cycle time during the nucleation and growth stage at a given temperature, one can modify the deposition of amorphous and crystalline layers and thus the thickness of the coating. It would be therefore possible to crystallize the amorphous base layer by reducing the number of cycles at low temperature and extending the number of cycles (time-length) at 220 °C.
Nevertheless, the final morphology would still be largely controlled by the initial morphology during the nucleation stage.
We used Raman spectroscopy to unambiguously identify the local order of crystalline TiO2 materials.59Fig. 6 compares the Raman-active modes of anatase TiO2 of the different ALD temperature processes.
 Fig. 6  Raman-active modes of anatase TiO2 at different ALD temperature processes. 
The Raman spectra show well-resolved anatase peaks for the samples with TiO2 deposited at 220 °C and TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C at: Eg(1) 144 cm−1, Eg(2) 198 cm−1, B1g(1) 395 cm−1, A1gE1g(2) 517 cm−1, and Eg(3) 636 cm−1.45,53,60 The deposition at 60 °C does not show any signal from anatase due to its amorphous nature. At 120 °C, there is a weak signal of anatase, mainly at Eg(1), which corresponds to the crystalline inclusions of <7 nm observed in TEM (Fig. S5†). The TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C also shows a weak signal from the crystalline nuclei formed during the initial step at 220 °C. The small crystallites being isolated and embedded in amorphous TiO2 suppresses the Raman signal. Furthermore, the red shift of the Eg(1) band of both samples corresponds to a reduced anatase crystallite size.61,62
The TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C sample displays well-resolved anatase peaks even with a very thin layer of crystalline material compared to that of the ∼17 nm thick layer of anatase deposited at 220 °C. This is an indication that a considerable amount of a continuous anatase coating covering the amorphous base layer is present, and thus no red shift is observed.
In Fig. 7 the Raman spectra show the active vibrations in the region of the MWCNTs after 300 cycles at each temperature process. The ID/IG ratio indicated in Fig. 6 increased even further compared to the ID/IG ratios of the nucleation stage shown in Fig. 2a. This could mean that there was more sp3 hybridization of CNT carbon atoms during the growth of TiO2. Particularly, for depositions at 120 °C and 220 °C, there was no complete coverage of the CNT surface after 20 cycles, and subsequent cycles may have had increased the sp3 concentration.
 Fig. 7  Interaction of TiO2 with the va-MWCNTs measured by Raman spectroscopy after 300 cycles at different temperature processes. 
The reason why the ID/IG ratio at 220 °C is lower than any other temperature can be explained by the fact that there are still uncovered CNT surfaces after 300 cycles, mainly due to the weak nucleation sites which lead to exposed CNT surfaces as we have observed from SEM images (Fig. S2†).
Another reason may be due to the island growth observed, which upon coalescence of the anatase crystals, leaves the surface of the CNTs uncoated. A scheme of this event is portrayed in Fig. 8c.
 Fig. 8  Evolution of the nucleation (i) and growth (ii) of ALD TiO2 on MWCNTs using TTIP and H2O: (a) The ALD deposition at 60 °C enabled a continuous and uniform amorphous TiO2 film on the MWCNTs. (b) At 120 °C, the half-ellipsoidal nuclei at MWCNT defects grew into a nanoparticle network along the MWCNTs with anatase crystal inclusions in the amorphous layer. (c) At 220 °C, the sporadic nuclei at the MWCNT defects exhibited facetted island growth and coalesced, causing a rough morphology and exposed CNT surfaces. (d) The TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C resulted in a continuous and amorphous TiO2 layer, covered with a conformal anatase coating. (e) The TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C resulted in coarse facetted nanocrystals covered and infilled with a smooth amorphous TiO2 layer. 
Both of the TS-ALD processes exhibited a similar ID/IG ratio comparable to those at low deposition temperatures. The ID/IG ratio from the TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C sample is larger than the one obtained only at a deposition temperature of 220 °C. This shows that the amorphous layer deposited at 60 °C on the growth stage assisted in coating the uncovered regions as a result of the sporadic nuclei formed at 200 °C. Furthermore, both the D- and G-bands red-shifted and broadened further after 300 cycles of TiO2 at all the different deposition temperatures, which is altogether an indication of a strong interaction of the TiO2 layer with the CNTs.1,45–47 The largest red shift and broadening are observed where low temperatures were involved in the ALD deposition and therefore the larger CNT surface coverage. It is therefore logical to assume that a larger CNT surface coverage ensures a stronger interaction between these two materials. Table 1 shows the values for the position and FWHM of the Raman-active modes. These results provide new insight into the analysis of charge transport kinetics in these nanostructures.
Nucleation and growth mechanisms of TiO2 on CNTs
Based on our results, we propose a model that further extends the knowledge of nucleation and growth of ALD TiO2 on CNTs, to which we have incorporated our Temperature-step ALD studies (Fig. 8). Low temperature ALD (i.e. 60 °C) enables a continuous and uniform coverage of TTIP on the MWCNTs, probably caused by the attachment of the alkoxide ligands to the CNTs. This layer grows into a conformal amorphous TiO2 film (Fig. 8a). At 60 °C, TTIP is less reactive with water and consequently there is a lower concentration of hydroxyl groups which reduces the GPC.
On the other hand, at higher temperatures, the very first molecules of TTIP react preferably at the defect sites of the CNTs, and subsequent cycles continue to deposit only at those sporadic nuclei which provide the only available OH sites after every cycle. The large contact angle and spherical shape of the TiO2 nuclei suggest that the incoming molecules of TTIP and H2O react only at these sites without creating new bonding with the CNTs. The high temperature improves the reactivity of TTIP with water and, in combination with the time-length of the experiment, promotes the ordering of Ti–O that results in crystal growth which subsequently increases the density of hydroxyl groups at the surface, improving the GPC. The deposition performed at 120 °C presented anatase crystal inclusions due to the extended time of the ALD deposition, which promoted crystal growth and resulted in a nanoparticle network along the CNTs (Fig. 8b). The ALD deposition at 220 °C resulted in a rough non-uniform anatase TiO2 surface with large areas of uncoated CNTs due to the sporadic nucleation behaviour at the MWCNT defects and subsequent facetted island growth (Fig. 8c).
The TS-ALD strategy takes advantage of the nucleation and growth mechanisms at different temperatures. Adjusting the temperature to 60 °C during the nucleation stage followed by an increase to 220 °C during the growth stage resulted in a continuous and amorphous TiO2 layer covered with a conformal anatase coating (Fig. 8d). Starting the deposition at 220 °C and then reducing to 60 °C resulted in sporadic and coarsely facetted nanocrystals covered and infilled with a smooth amorphous TiO2 layer (Fig. 8d).
The TS-ALD approach provides a route to tailor the interface and control the thickness, crystal structure and morphology of the TiO2 coating. At the nanoscale, these parameters become an important factor to improve the charge transport kinetics between these materials. For instance, the TiO2 coating on the CNTs needs to be thin enough for efficient electron injection towards the CNTs. However, it has to be thick enough and completely coat the CNT surface to prevent the back transfer of electrons. Therefore, the optimal thickness is a compromise between these two phenomena. The morphology also plays an important role. A coarse morphology, such as the one obtained for the TS-ALD 200 °C–60 °C sample, increases the active surface area of the TiO2 layer compared to a conformal coating, which is a valuable asset to increase the photocatalytic activity or the dye loading to improve dye-sensitized solar cells. As previously discussed, the anatase phase is also desired for many applications. However, the roughness that derives from the crystallization can affect the performance of the device, and post-deposition heat treatments introduce undesired stress effects to the parent material, such as in MEMS devices.63 The TS-ALD strategy could be a solution to this problem. The appropriate control of the interface and the TiO2 coating at the nanoscale exploit the exceptional electrical properties of many nanostructures, allowing for a straightforward analysis of the charge transport kinetics between the two materials.
Conclusions
We have successfully developed a new strategy to deposit continuous and conformal TiO2 ultrathin films with complete surface coverage of non-functionalized va-MWCNTs. With this strategy, we have also gained control over the morphology, thickness and crystallinity of the TiO2 coating. This strategy consists of tuning the temperature on the different phases of nucleation and growth during the ALD deposition. Starting the ALD deposition at 60 °C enables the complete and continuous coverage of the CNTs with an amorphous ultrathin film. We have demonstrated through Raman spectroscopy and XPS measurements that TTIP deposited at low temperatures is responsible for the complete and continuous coverage of the MWCNTs and therefore has a stronger interaction with the CNTs. XPS measurements showed an increased concentration of sp3 and C–O species from the C 1s peak after the deposition of 20 ALD cycles of TiO2 at 60 °C. The C–O signal arises from the combination of alkoxide ligands that may have remained in the film and C–O–Ti bonding at the interface. This conclusion is supported by Raman spectroscopy showing an increase of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms (ID/IG ratio) and broadening of the G-band of the MWCNTs after 20 pulses of TTIP alone.
The ability of the alkoxide ligands to form bridging structures may have facilitated the adsorption of the TTIP molecule to the carbon walls which resulted in a continuous and conformal layer of TiO2 in the following cycles. Subsequently, by increasing the temperature to 220 °C during the growth stage we have obtained a conformal anatase coating covering the amorphous layer. TEM images showed the interface between the amorphous adhesion layer and the anatase coating. The crystalline phase was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy showing well-resolved peaks for the anatase vibrations. On the other hand, starting the deposition at 220 °C, we deposited sporadic crystalline anatase grains on the CNTs, and upon lowering the temperature to 60 °C during the growth stage, an amorphous layer was deposited, embedding the crystal grains which resulted in an overall coarser morphology. The final TiO2 thickness obtained using the TS-ALD strategy is largely controlled by the first deposited layer. The deposition of an amorphous base layer delays the formation of anatase crystals when the temperature is increased. Correspondingly, the deposition of anatase crystals as the first layer supplies a larger density of OH groups and improves the GPC even after decreasing the deposition temperature during subsequent cycles. We attribute the high GPC observed at high temperatures in our samples to the time–temperature dependence of crystallization which increases the hydroxyl groups and improves the GPC.51,52 At low temperatures, amorphous TiO2 is favoured and thus exhibited a better control of the thickness. Therefore adjusting the number of cycles and the time-length in each of the stages at a given temperature will determine the thickness of the amorphous and anatase layers to tailor the desired thickness and morphology. The thickness, crystal structure and surface morphology of thin films have become important factors to improve the electrical performance of these nanostructures. The “Temperature-step” strategy will be of high interest to deposit other metal oxides where the interface and morphology need to be tailored.

 	Fig. 8  Evolution of the nucleation (i) and growth (ii) of ALD TiO2 on MWCNTs using TTIP and H2O: (a) The ALD deposition at 60 °C enabled a continuous and uniform amorphous TiO2 film on the MWCNTs. (b) At 120 °C, the half-ellipsoidal nuclei at MWCNT defects grew into a nanoparticle network along the MWCNTs with anatase crystal inclusions in the amorphous layer. (c) At 220 °C, the sporadic nuclei at the MWCNT defects exhibited facetted island growth and coalesced, causing a rough morphology and exposed CNT surfaces. (d) The TS-ALD 60 °C–220 °C resulted in a continuous and amorphous TiO2 layer, covered with a conformal anatase coating. (e) The TS-ALD 220 °C–60 °C resulted in coarse facetted nanocrystals covered and infilled with a smooth amorphous TiO2 layer.
