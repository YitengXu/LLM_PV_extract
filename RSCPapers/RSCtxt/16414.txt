By changing the donor segment from fluorene to dithienopyrrole and/or introducing a thiophene unit as a spacer, the band gap and energy levels of the resulting polymers could be tuned in a wide range. PDTP-DTPDI exhibited the narrowest band gap of 1.24 eV, and the absorption edge extended to 1 μm. All-polymer solar cells based on these electron acceptors, blended with different electron donor polymers, namely, a polythiophene derivative (P1) and a low band gap polymer (P2), were also investigated. P1:PDTP-PDI blends exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 0.93% under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). The monochromatic photocurrent response of the photovoltaic device based on P2:PDTP-PDI blends extended to the near-infrared region up to 1 μm.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are attractive for next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their simple and low-cost manufacturing processes, and the capability to fabricate flexible large-area devices.1 Over the last decade, the performance of PSCs has improved significantly owing to advances in photovoltaic materials, as well as device optimization.2 To date, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)-type PSCs with p-type semiconducting polymers as the electron donor and fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor have shown the highest performance, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 6%, as a result of intense device optimization.3 Using [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), one of the most successful fullerene derivatives, as the electron acceptor, however, has a number of drawbacks for application in PSCs, including weak absorption in the visible region, the possibility of phase separation from the donor polymer and difficulty to tune the energy levels. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to developing other types of electron acceptor materials to replace PCBM, including molecular-based materials and polymers. Small molecules composed of 2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazoles (vinazene)4 or perylene diimide (PDI)5 have been used as the electron acceptor in photovoltaic devices and exhibited a number of interesting opto-electrical characteristics; however, the PCEs are relatively low at present, which is probably due to the difficulty of forming the interpenetrating networks necessary for efficient transport of both electrons and holes to the electrodes.
Compared with the molecular-based materials, the electron accepting polymers exhibit better photovoltaic performance when blended with suitable donor materials. The initial investigation of electron accepting polymers used in photovoltaic devices started in 1994.6 After that, many polymers containing cyano groups have been synthesized and used in all-polymer solar cells (All-PSCs), with the highest PCE of such devices reaching 2%.7 In addition to cyano-containing polymers, PDI-based polymers are also promising electron acceptor materials, and are attracting increasing interest due to advantageous properties, such as thermal stability, low cost and strong absorption in the visible region, as well as good electron accepting properties.8 All-PSCs employing PDI-based polymers blended with suitable donor materials have achieved PCEs of over 2%.9
Although PDI-based acceptor polymers have promising characteristics, a detailed investigation into the control of band gaps and energy levels has not been reported. Lower LUMO energy level or higher electron affinity (EA) is necessary for the acceptor polymer to achieve more efficient photoinduced charge-transfer/separation in the donor/acceptor polymer heterojunctions. However, an excessively low LUMO energy level will reduce the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of All-PSCs, because VOC is related to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor polymer and the HOMO of the donor polymer.10 Therefore, it is crucial to tune not only the band gap but also the energy levels of the polymers by modifying their chemical structure.
In this study, we synthesized a series of PDI-based polymers by changing the donor segments and introducing a thiophene unit as a spacer. The energy levels of the resulting polymers could be tuned easily by the structural design. The application of these electron acceptor polymers combined with suitable donor polymers to All-PSCs was also investigated.
Results and discussions
Material synthesis
The synthesis of the monomers is shown in Scheme 1. Bromination of perylene dianhydride in concentrated sulfuric acid with a catalytic quantity of iodine provided the intermediate 1,7-dibromoperylene dianhydride (monomer 1) in 95% yield,11 which was then condensed with 2-ethylhexylamine in the blend solvent of 1-butanol and water to yield N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-1,7-dibromo-3,4,9,10-perylene diimide (2) in 86% yield. N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-1,7-di(2-bromothien-5-yl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-perylene diimide (monomer 4) was synthesized by Stille coupling of 2 with 2-tri-n-butylstannyl-thiophene, followed by bromination. The synthetic method for preparing the four PDI-based polymers is shown in Scheme 2. Two types of fluorene-based copolymers, PF-PDI and PF-DTPDI, were synthesized by Suzuki coupling reactions. The other two polymers, PDTP-PDI and PDTP-DTPDI, were synthesized by Stille coupling reactions.

PF-PDI and PDTP-PDI have good solubility in CHCl3, and their number-average molecular weights (Mn) were 13.6 K and 6.3 K, with polydispersity indices of 1.75 and 1.35, respectively. However, PF-DTPDI and PDTP-DTPDI were insoluble in CHCl3 but soluble in chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene at high temperature. This poor solubility might be due to the introduction of thiophene rings without any alkyl chains.
Optical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the four copolymers in dilute solutions and in films are shown in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively; the optical data are summarized in Table 1. PF-PDI, PF-DTPDI and PDTP-PDI showed three absorption peaks in solution, which was similar to other reported PDI-based polymers,8 while only two peaks for PDTP-DTPDI were observed in the region. In the spectrum of PF-DTPDI (number of thiophene spacers x = 1), the three absorption peaks and the absorption onset were shifted to longer wavelengths by about 50 nm compared with PF-PDI (x = 0). A similar shift was also observed for PDTP-PDI (x = 0) and PDTP-DTPDI (x = 1). These results indicate that the introduction of thiophene units into the polymer backbone increased the conjugation of the copolymer, probably due to the decreased steric hindrance around the PDI which could induce a more planar polymer conformation. When the polymers based on fluorene and DTP units were compared, the absorption of the latter was at a longer wavelength. This could be attributed to the stronger electron donating ability of the DTP unit compared with that of fluorene.

The absorption spectra of the films were not notably red-shifted compared with those in solution, indicating that little intermolecular interaction occurred in the solid state, probably due to the large steric hindrance of the many bulky side chains. Interestingly, the absorption of PDTP-DTPDI extended to over 1 μm, which was the first time that this has been observed for a PDI-based polymer.
The absorption properties of the polymers suggest that by using donor segments with different electron donating abilities and introducing thiophene as a spacer, the absorption spectra can be tuned in a wide range, which is highly useful for designing photovoltaic materials.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the four PDI-based copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode, which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The cyclic voltammetric curves are shown in Fig. 3. The two fluorene-based polymers underwent an irreversible oxidative doping process, while the DTP-based polymers exhibited clear reversible oxidation. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers were calculated from the values of the onset oxidation potential (Eoxon) and onset reduction potential (Eredon). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, together with the electrochemical band gaps (EECg), are shown in Table 1.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of four polymer films on a platinum plate in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 mol L−1 [Bu4N]PF6 (Bu = butyl), at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
The decrease in the band gap for the series PF-PDI > PE-DTPDI > PDTP-PDI > PDTP-DTPDI was attributed to both the decrease in the LUMO energy level and the simultaneous increase in the HOMO energy level. The trend of decreasing EECg in the polymer series coincided with the decreasing optical band gap (Eoptg). However, the EECg values of these four polymers were larger than the corresponding Eoptgvalues, especially for the two fluorene-based polymers. This relatively large difference in Eoptg and EECg was also observed for polyfluorene derivatives.12
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of this series of four PDI-based polymers as the electron acceptor, the selection of donor materials with suitable energy levels and absorption spectra was critical. In this study, we used two types of polymers, P1 and P2, as the electron donors (see Scheme 3). P1 is a polythiophene derivative with conjugated side chains and has been shown to be a promising donor material in All-PSCs. 7b–d P2 is a low band gap polymer with high absorption coefficients in the range from 500 to 1100 nm.13 Both polymers were synthesized by methods reported in the literature.
 Scheme 3  Chemical structures of two donor polymers (P1 and P2) and energy level diagrams of all donor and acceptor polymers. 
All-PSCs were fabricated with a typical sandwich structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al, where ITO and Ca/Al were used as the anode and the cathode, respectively, in the photovoltaic operation. To avoid the so-called “edge effect” and to evaluate the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices accurately, the effective area of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask (2 mm × 3 mm) during the irradiation of the simulated solar light.14

Fig. 4 shows the I–V curves of the best devices for the various combinations of donor and acceptor polymers under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). The open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (ISC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the various polymer combinations at different mixing ratios of the donor and the acceptor polymers are summarized in Table 2. All-PSCs based on the P1:PF-PDI blend had higher VOC than devices based on the P1:PDTP-PDI blend, which was in accordance with the larger difference between the LUMO of the electron acceptor (PF-PDI or PDTP-PDI) and the HOMO of P1 (1.47 eV for P1:PF-PDI and 1.25 eV for P1:PDTP-PDI). The above-mentioned phenomenon was the result of P1 being used in combination with different electron acceptor materials. In fact, a similar trend also was found in the case of P1:PDTP-PDI and P2:PDTP-PDI, which were combinations of different donor materials with PDTP-PDI.

The mixing ratio of the donor and acceptor polymers had almost no effect on VOC, but strongly affected ISC, thus affecting the overall photovoltaic performance. As a result, the ratio of electron donor polymer and electron acceptor polymer was found to be a critical factor for building interpenetrating networks for the efficient transport of both electrons and holes to the electrodes. PF-DTPDI and PDTP-DTPDI showed relatively low photovoltaic performances, probably due to their poor solubility. Further improvement in the solubility by structural modifications could improve device performance. The highest PCE of the PSCs reached 0.93%, which was obtained by using P1:PDTP-PDI in a ratio of 1:2. This PCE was higher than the values for bulk-heterojunction-type All-PSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of P1:PF-PDI, P1:PDTP-PDI and P2:PDTP-PDI devices under the illumination of monochromatic light are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the P1:PF-PDI system, the P1:PDTP-PDI system had higher EQE values in the range of 350–700 nm, with absorption extending to 900 nm. The photocurrent response in the range of 700–900 nm was attributed to the absorption of PDTP-PDI. For the P2:PDTP-PDI system, the photocurrent response wavelength extended to 1000 nm, which was the first example of an All-PSC with a response over 1 μm. Compared with the P3HT:PCBM system, the photocurrent response wavelength range was improved; however, the EQE value of all these devices was relatively low, which limited the overall photovoltaic performance. We compared the experimental ISC under the simulated AM 1.5 irradiation with the ISC calculated by integrating the EQE and the actual AM 1.5 solar spectrum. The calculated ISC was ∼20% less than the measured ISC. This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and/or device degradation caused by the oxidation of the Ca electrode during the measurements in air. Further device optimization and the use of new donor materials is expected to increase the EQE value and thus improve the photovoltaic performance of these All-PSCs.

Conclusion
Four types of new PDI-based copolymers were synthesized and used as the electron acceptor material in polymer solar cells. By increasing the electron donating ability of donor segments and/or introducing thiophene as a spacer to decrease steric hindrance, the band gap and energy levels of the resulting copolymers could be tuned in a wide range. All-polymer solar cells using these polymers as the acceptor showed promising performance. These results provide a potential design strategy for developing new electron acceptor polymers with superior performance.

1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were measured using a JEOL Alpha FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford superconducting magnet system. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence system equipped with a UV detector using chloroform as the eluent at 40 °C. The chloroform solution was filtered using a PTFE filter (pore size: 1.0 μm) before sample injection. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a JACSO V-650 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on an HSV-100 (Hokuto Denkou) potentiostat. A Pt plate coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes (calibrated against Fc/Fc+), respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
PSCs were constructed in the conventional sandwich structure through several steps. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent, water, acetone and 2-propanol. After drying the substrate, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) was spin-coated (4000 rpm for 30 s) on ITO. The film was dried at 150 °C under N2 atmosphere for 5 min. After cooling the substrate, a solution of the P-type materials and N-type materials was spin-coated. After drying the solvent, the substrate was annealed at 80 °C for 1 h inside a nitrogen-filled glove box. Then, a Ca/Al (∼2 nm/60 nm) electrode was evaporated onto the substrate under high vacuum (10−4–10−5 Pa) in an evaporation chamber (ALS Technology, H-2807 vacuum evaporation system with E-100 load lock). The photovoltaic cells without protective encapsulation were subsequently tested in air under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2, Peccell Technologies, PCE-L11). Light intensity was adjusted by using a standard silicon solar cell with an optical filter (Bunkou Keiki, BS520). The current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 I–V measurement system. The “effective” area of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask (2 mm × 3 mm) during irradiation of the simulated solar light.13,15 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a Hypermonolight System (Bunkou Keiki, SM-250F).
