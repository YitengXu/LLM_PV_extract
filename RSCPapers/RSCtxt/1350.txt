    , Accepted 28th March 2011First published on 21st April 2011AbstractWe report a study of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of CdSe quantum-dot (QD)-sensitized solar cells prepared by direct adsorption of pre-synthesized QDs, passivated with either tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) or n-butylamine (BA), onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 film.
Owing to their low fabrication cost and power conversion efficiencies exceeding 11%,1,2dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent a promising platform for next generation photovoltaics. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that a new type of solar cell can be fabricated using this platform by substituting the light-harvesting dyes in DSSCs with quantum-confined colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, also called quantum dots (QDs). The quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) retain the appeal of low-cost fabrication and offer other advantages, such as easy tunability of the electronic properties of the QD chromophore. However, in spite of initial encouraging results the reported efficiencies of the best devices are significantly lower than those of DSSCs.4 Due to the structural differences between the dyes and QDs one of the challenges is the optimization of the QD/TiO2 interface for efficient QD → TiO2 electron injection.
Unlike dyes, QDs do not have functional groups allowing direct chemical attachment of the QD to the TiO2 surface. Several groups have demonstrated that efficient chemical coupling of QDs to TiO2 can be achieved with the aid of appropriately functionalized organic molecules—linkers.3,5–7 For these structures it was shown that the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE)6,7 as well as the electron injection dynamics depend strongly on the type of linker. In a recent work, Bisquert et al.8 have shown that efficient adsorption of pre-synthesized CdSe QDs onto TiO2 can also be realized without the use of organic linkers. This is consistent with our recent report, in which we showed that QDSSCs with light harvesting efficiency of >60% and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) ∼100% can be prepared by direct adsorption of CdSe QDs onto TiO2.9
In the QDSSCs prepared by direct adsorption of QDs onto TiO2 one important question is how the change in QD surface passivation affects the performance of the solar cell. The focus of the present work is on addressing this question. In Fig. 1 we show the IQEs for QDSSCs prepared using QDs passivated with tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and n-butylamine (BA). The IQEs were determined from IPCE measurements using eqn (1), IPCE (λ) = LHE (λ) × %Ts (λ) × IQE (λ) = LHE(λ) × %Ts(λ) × ϕinj × ϕcoll(1)where LHE (λ) is the light harvesting efficiency of the QD/TiO2 film deposited on a F-doped SnO2-coated glass substrate (FTO), %Ts (λ) is the transmittance of the FTO, Φinj is the efficiency of the QD → TiO2 electron injection, and Φcoll is the charge collection efficiency. The LHE measurements10 were performed on a ∼5 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film with an average particle diameter of ∼20 nm, and sensitized with QDs with the lowest-energy absorption band (1S) of the QDs at 585 nm. IPCE was measured using a complete QDSSC, comprised of the QD/TiO2 film with the same properties as described above on an FTO substrate, a platinum counter electrode, and 1 M aqueous Li2S as an electrolyte.9 (For more details see Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI)†).

As seen in Fig. 1, the IQE of the QDSSC containing QDs passivated with BA (BA-QD) is 20–40% higher than that of the IQE of the QDSSC using QDs passivated with TOPO (TOPO-QD). Based on eqn (1), this indicates that in the BA-QD QDSSC the Φinj and/or Φcoll are enhanced. To determine which of the components is primarily responsible for the observed enhancement in IQE, we have studied the QD → TiO2 electron injection process in BA-QD/TiO2 and TOPO-QD/TiO2 films using nanosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The TA measurements were carried out in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral regions. The excitation was provided by ∼150 fs pulses from an amplified Ti:sapphire laser, frequency mixed using an optical parametric amplifier to provide pulses at 500 nm with ∼1 kHz repetition rate. To minimize potential photodegradation during the TA measurements (See Fig. S2 in ESI†) the samples were kept in air-tight cells under an argon atmosphere and were continuously moved at a speed of ∼1 mm s−1. The results of TA studies in the visible region are summarized in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Nanosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements in the visible range: (a) TA spectra recorded with pump–probe delay <1 ns and (b) TA dynamics probed at the corresponding peak of the 1S bleach for each material (BA-QD solution at 583 nm, TOPO-QD solution at 587 nm, BA-QD/TiO2 at 574 nm, TOPO-QD/TiO2 at 586 nm) in (a). The pump fluence was 0.15 mJ/pulse·cm2, corresponding to average number of absorbed photons per QD 〈Nabs〉 = 0.57. 
As shown in panel (a), the TA spectrum of the BA-QD/TiO2 film immediately after excitation (time resolution of the instrument was ∼1 ns) is noticeably blue-shifted compared to the TOPO-QD/TiO2 films or QDs in solution. This is consistent with the steady-state absorption spectra shown in Fig. S3† in the ESI. We attribute the observed shift to a strong electronic coupling between the BA-QD and TiO2, which leads, directly or indirectly, to a distortion in the QD electronic structure. There is also a significant induced absorption observed at wavelengths above 620 nm in the BA-QD/TiO2, which is not present in the TOPO-QD solution, TOPO-QD/TiO2, or the BA-QD solution. Consistent with previous studies,13 we attribute the observed induced absorption to formation of a QD+/TiO2− charge separated state (CSS). This interpretation is in agreement with the results of NIR TA studies discussed in the following sections.
The dynamics of 1S bleach recovery, shown in Fig. 2(b), are similar for BA-QD and TOPO-QD solutions, indicating that the relaxation of the excited carriers is not sensitive to the changes in the type of passivating ligand. The relaxation dynamics in both BA-QD/TiO2 and TOPO-QD/TiO2 are faster than observed for QDs in solution, which is consistent with previous studies of QD/TiO2 films using organic linkers3,6,11,12 and suggests that QDs participate in QD → TiO2 electron transfer. Weak (<10%) signals at delays >60 ns are attributed to exciton recombination involving carriers trapped at QD surface defects13,14 not participating in the electron transfer.
Since the solution dynamics for BA-QD and TOPO-QD are similar, we conclude that the difference in the relaxation dynamics observed for BA-QD/TiO2 and TOPO-QD/TiO2 is mostly due to the differences in the QD → TiO2 electron injection efficiency (EIE) for these two materials. In order to compare the difference more quantitatively, we use the data shown in Fig. 2(b) to estimate the electron transfer rate (kET) using eqn (2), kET = 1/τ(QD/TiO2) − 1/τ(QD,sol)(2)where τ(QD/TiO2) and τ(QD,sol) are the 1S bleach recovery lifetimes of the QDs on TiO2 and in solution, respectively.6 To determine the τ(QD/TiO2) and τ(QD,sol), the corresponding dynamics shown in Fig. 2(b) were fit to a stretched exponential kinetic expression, shown in eqn (3), ΔA(t) = ΔA(0) × exp[−(t/τ)β](3)where τ is the characteristic lifetime.3 The lifetimes corresponding to the best fit of eqn (3) to the experimental data are summarized in Table 1. Using the lifetime values in Table 1, we obtain rate constants kET = (5.50 ± 0.25) × 108 s−1 and kET = (1.73 ± 0.13) × 108 s−1 with BA-QD and TOPO-QD, respectively, indicating that EIE is enhanced in the case of BA-QDs. The rate constants obtained for TOPO-QDs are similar to the rate constants found in a previous report where TOPO-QDs were coupled to TiO2 using mercaptopropionic acid as a linker (Fig. 3).3

To further investigate QD → TiO2 electron injection efficiency we have studied the TA relaxation dynamics of BA-QD/TiO2 and TOPO-QD/TiO2 films in the NIR spectral range (Fig. 4). In the case of DSSCs,15 the signal in this spectral region is dominated by contributions from CSS, namely the absorption of free electrons in TiO2 (TiO2(e−)) and the absorption of a dye cation radical, relaxing typically on microsecond to millisecond time scales.16 By analogy, we attribute the NIR TA signal observed for QD/TiO2 films to two sources: (1) QD+/TiO2(e−)CSS (slow component; >100 ns), and (2) Intraband electron and hole transitions in excited QDs17,18 (fast component; <100 ns). Since the fast component observed in the TA signal of TOPO-QD/TiO2 has a very similar lifetime (τ = 14.3 ± 1.0 ns) to that of the TOPO-QD in solution (τ = 13.7 ± 0.3 ns) we assign the fast component to the relaxation of the excited states in QDs not participating in the QD → TiO2 electron transfer. The lack of a fast component in the decay trace of the BA-QD/TiO2 film and significant enhancement of the Δα associated with the slow component relative to the TOPO-QD/TiO2 films (corrected for differences in LHE), indicates that the electron injection is significantly more efficient in the former. This result suggests that the observed improvement in IQE of the devices based on BA-QD/TiO2 (Fig. 1) is, at least in part, due to the enhancement in the EIE at the QD/TiO2 interface.

The solid lines are the single-exponential fit to BA-QD/TiO2 and TOPO-QD solution and bi-exponential fit to TOPO-QD/TiO2. The pump fluence was 0.15 mJ pulse−1 cm−2, corresponding to average number of absorbed photons per QD per pulse 〈Nabs〉 = 0.57. 
In summary, we have investigated the dynamics and efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer from CdSe QDs to nanocrystalline TiO2. We have shown that in the CdSe QD/TiO2 films prepared without the use of organic linkers the efficiency of the QD → TiO2 electron transfer is sensitive to the type of QD passivation. Change of the QD passivation from TOPO to BA leads to ∼3-fold enhancement in the rate of charge transfer. The enhancement in electron transfer at the BA-QD/TiO2 interface is attributed to two factors: (1) increased electronic coupling between the QD and the TiO2 film resulting from the reduced length of the QD passivating ligands, and (2) increased driving force for electron transfer resulting from the distortion in the QD electronic structure following the adsorption onto TiO2.
