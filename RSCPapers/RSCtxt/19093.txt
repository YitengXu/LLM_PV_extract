    , Accepted 12th March 2012First published on 15th March 2012AbstractThe optical band gap of the light absorber and the alignment of its bands with the underlying wide band gap metal oxide are critical for efficient light harvesting and charge separation in semiconductor-sensitized solar cells (SSCs). In practice, these two requirements are however not always fulfilled concomitantly in SSCs. Favourable band alignment in CdSe-sensitized TiO2 requires utilization of quantum sized CdSe, which causes great losses in the harvesting of long wavelength photons due to quantum confinement effects. In the present study, ternary cadmium sulfoselenide (CdSxSe1−x), which has a tunable band gap between those of CdSe and CdS without reducing the dimension, was proposed as a sensitizer for TiO2. CdSxSe1−x was successfully synthesized by alternately depositing CdS and CdSe layers under ambient conditions. SSCs utilizing CdSxSe1−x-sensitized TiO2 yielded a power conversion efficiency of 4.05% under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination, rivalling the well-studied cascaded CdS/CdSe electrodes when an aqueous polysulfide solution was used as the electrolyte and Cu2S as the counter electrode. The findings of the present study provide an alternative and viable approach for optimizing the energetics of semiconductor sensitizers for efficient charge separation, while also maintaining good light harvesting.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals have recently been studied extensively for use as light absorbers in photoelectrochemical solar cells using mesoscopic semiconducting wide band gap metal oxides as electron transporters.1–6 The beneficial properties of semiconductor sensitizers such as high extinction coefficient and feasible band energy tunability have yielded promising results in photovoltaic applications.7–13 Among various semiconductor sensitizers, cadmium selenide (CdSe) is the most widely investigated light absorber in semiconductor-sensitized solar cells (SSCs) owing to its wide absorption spectrum. Using this sensitizer, close to 5% power conversion efficiency has been achieved in liquid junction cells under AM1.5 1 Sun illumination.6,14
To facilitate charge separation in SSCs, a type-II band alignment between semiconductor sensitizer and metal oxide (i.e. TiO2) is highly desired, where both the conduction and valence bands of the sensitizer are higher in energy than the corresponding band energies of the underlying metal oxide, so that the generated electrons and holes in the sensitizer separate rapidly by transferring electrons into the conduction band of the metal oxide. As a result, the conduction band position and hence the size of semiconductor sensitizers are critical to achieve efficient charge separation. As revealed by ultrafast transient optical measurements, only very small CdSe nanocrystals with sufficiently high conduction band energy relative to that of TiO2 meet this requirement.15,16 However, to synthesize quantum sized CdSe, complex and cumbersome synthetic protocols have to be adopted. On the other hand, successive ionic-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) offers great flexibility for depositing various semiconductor sensitizers on mesoporous TiO2 directly, but it lacks precise control of the growth of CdSe nanocrystals and polydispersed CdSe is usually obtained. In addition, compositional synthesis has been emerging as a promising approach to tune the optical and energetic properties of semiconductor sensitizers while keeping the particle size constant, where the optical band gap and the associated band edge position can feasibly be varied by changing the composition of the semiconductor. Hence, instead of synthesizing CdSe quantum dots (QDs) with reduced size, an alternative approach is to utilize a solid solution of CdSe formed with another wider band gap material, for instance CdS, which gives rise to the formation of cadmium sulfoselenide (CdSxSe1−x).
CdSxSe1−x is a member of the ternary chalcogenide compounds which have recently attracted great attention for their potential application in photovoltaic devices.17,18 Owing to the small lattice mismatch, CdS and CdSe are miscible over a wide range of compositions, which leads to the formation of CdSxSe1−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) solid solution with almost zero enthalpy change (ΔHmix ≈ 0, close to the ideal mixing conditions).19 CdSxSe1−x with controlled composition has been successfully prepared by mixing both the hexagonal wurtzite CdS and CdSe crystals in a thermal vapour transport system, or by mixing their precursors in a stoichiometric ratio in a solution method such as hot injection, to control the composition of CdSxSe1−x and hence engineer its band gap in between the bulk CdSe (1.75 eV) and CdS (2.5 eV).17,20–24 Nanocrystalline CdSxSe1−x of different morphologies such as colloidal QDs,25 thin film,17 nanowire,26 nanorod,27 nanobelt,28,29etc. have been extensively studied and they demonstrated good photoluminescence quantum efficiency and enhanced photoconductivity and charge carrier dynamics, which are generally desired for photovoltaic applications.24,30–33
While the optical and electrical properties have been extensively investigated, the use of CdSxSe1−x as sensitizer in SSCs has not been reported yet. Herein we present the first comprehensive study of CdSxSe1−x-sensitized mesoscopic TiO2 solar cells and their comparison with the widely used cascaded CdS/CdSe co-sensitizer.4–6,34–36 In addition, instead of using the high-temperature thermal vapour transport or hot injection methods, SILAR was employed to facilely prepare CdSxSe1−x by alternately depositing layers of CdS and CdSe directly onto mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes. The structure and morphology of as-grown sensitizers on TiO2 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Optical measurements, j–V characteristics, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were combined to understand the separation and collection of charge carriers in these SSCs. Using this newly synthesized CdSxSe1−x solid solution sensitizer, a power conversion efficiency of 4.05% has been achieved under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which rivals that of the commonly used cascaded CdS/CdSe sensitizer.
Experimental section
Preparation of mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes
TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25) mixed with a small amount of ethanol were ground by using pestle and mortar to break up agglomerates. Ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol were then mixed with the ground TiO2 powder following a previously reported procedure for making TiO2 paste.37 Fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, Pilkington TEC-15) was cleaned by sequential sonication in 5% Decon 90 solution, deionized water and absolute ethanol. TiO2 electrodes were prepared by screen-printing the above paste onto cleaned FTO glass several times in order to get an appropriate thickness. Light scattering TiO2 layers (WER2-O, Dyesol) were also screen printed to make double layered electrodes when required. The printed films were then sintered in air by heating gradually to 325 °C and holding for 5 minutes, then at 375 °C for 5 minutes, at 450 °C for 15 minutes, and finally at 500 °C for 15 minutes. The area of the TiO2 layers was approximately 0.28 cm2 (circles with 0.6 cm diameter). Electrodes were then soaked in a 40 mM solution of TiCl4 in deionized water (prepared by dilution of a 2 M stock solution which was prepared at ca. 0 °C) for 30 minutes at 70 °C before being rinsed, dried and heated to ca. 500 °C in a hot air stream for 30 minutes. The thickness of the electrodes was determined by an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler (KLA-Tencor).
Preparation of CdSxSe1−x-sensitized mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes
Kapton tape was used to mask the bare FTO, leaving the mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes (0.6 cm diameter) uncovered; they were sensitized with CdS and CdSe using previously reported SILAR methods.11,38 In a typical procedure, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a solution containing 0.02 M cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fluka, >99.0%) in methanol for 1 minute, to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the TiO2, and then rinsed with methanol for 1 minute to remove the excess Cd2+. Electrodes were then dried in a gentle stream of N2 for 1 minute. The dried electrodes were then dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, Sigma Aldrich) in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (1:1, v/v) for 1 minute, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with S2− to form the desired CdS. Electrodes were then rinsed in methanol for 1 minute and dried again with N2. CdSe was then deposited onto the CdS-coated TiO2 electrodes by the SILAR method, where they were dipped into a solution containing 0.03 M cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fluka, >99.0%) in ethanol for 30 seconds and rinsed with ethanol for 2 minutes, then dried for 2 minutes in an argon atmosphere. Subsequently, the dried electrodes were dipped into a solution containing 0.03 M Se2− for 30 seconds. The Se2− solution was prepared by mixing selenium dioxide (SeO2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) in ethanol following the work reported by Lee et al.11 One deposition cycle was completed by further rinsing in ethanol for 2 minutes and drying again in an argon atmosphere for 2 minutes. These procedures for depositing CdS and CdSe were alternately repeated several times to get a homogeneous mixture of CdSxSe1−x (solid solution) on the TiO2 electrodes. Following the same procedure, cascaded CdS/CdSe was also deposited on the TiO2 electrodes for comparison. A ZnS passivation layer was deposited on a CdSxSe1−x-coated TiO2 electrode by SILAR using 0.1 M aqueous zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >99.5%) and 0.1 M aqueous Na2S·9H2O, dipping for 1 minute in each solution, with 1 minute of rinsing in deionized water before each immersion in a precursor solution. All the CdSxSe1−x-sensitized TiO2 electrodes used in this study were coated with two ZnS passivation layers.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes on glass slides sensitized with CdSxSe1−x were carried out with a Bruker D8 using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.154059 nm). The detailed morphology of the above electrodes was elucidated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL, JEM 2010F which also facilitated energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Samples for TEM investigations were prepared by detaching the solid solution CdSxSe1−x and cascaded CdS/CdSe coated TiO2 nanocrystals mechanically from the FTO glass substrate and dispersing in ethanol, followed by transferring one drop of the suspension onto a carbon coated copper grid. Optical density measurements of sensitizers were carried out in single beam transmission mode utilizing a Shimadzu UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Solidspec-3700).
Fabrication and characterization of CdSxSe1−x-sensitized solar cells
Brass foil (alloy 260, Alfa Aesar) was polished with sand paper and an alumina suspension (de-agglomerated 1.00 and 0.05 microns) and then cleaned by using an ultrasonic bath and deionized water. The clean brass foil was then etched in 37% HCl at 70 °C for 5 minutes to expose more copper from the copper–zinc matrix and the yellowish colour of the brass changed to a dark red.4,39,40 The etched brass was then rinsed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C. One drop of an aqueous polysulfide solution containing 1 M S and 1 M Na2S·9H2O was added onto an unmasked part of the etched brass causing it to suddenly become black, indicating the formation of Cu2S. Platinised counter electrodes were fabricated on FTO with small holes drilled at one corner. After cleaning, a thin layer of Pt was deposited onto the FTO by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid. To fabricate SSCs with brass cathodes, a hole was made within 1 mm from the edge of the TiO2 layer on the photoanode. Photoanodes and cathodes were sealed together in a sandwich configuration using a hot-melt polymer (Meltonix 1170-25, Solaronix). The inter-electrode space was filled with an electrolyte by vacuum back filling. Holes were sealed using a small piece of hot-melt polymer and a microscope coverslip. The electrolyte was composed of 1 M S, 1 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.1 M NaOH in deionized water. IPCE spectra were measured with a spectral resolution of ca. 5 nm using a 300 W Xenon lamp and a grating monochromator equipped with order sorting filters (Newport/Oriel). The incident photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport/Oriel). Photocurrents were measured using an auto-ranging current amplifier (Newport/Oriel). Control of the monochromator and recording of photocurrent spectra were performed using a PC running the TRACQ Basic software (Newport). Current–voltage characteristics under simulated AM1.5 illumination were measured using a Keithley Source Meter and the PVIV software package (Newport). Simulated AM1.5 illumination was provided by a Newport solar simulator and the light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si solar cell. The active area of the cells was defined by a mask to be 0.1199 cm2. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) experiments were performed using a potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Autolab PGSTAT 302N/FRA2, Ecochemie) and the Nova 1.6 software package. Measurements were performed with cells biased to VOC while under background illumination from a high-power red (λ = 627 nm) light emitting diode (LED, Luxeon). Different background illumination intensities were achieved using neutral density filters mounted on an automated filter wheel system (Newport). The highest intensity used was sufficient to produce a VOC approximately equal to that obtained under AM1.5, 1 Sun illumination and the incident photon flux was of the order of 1017 cm−2 s−1. The optical density (OD) of the filters was varied in steps of approximately 0.5. The voltage perturbation amplitude was 15 mV RMS and the frequency range was 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structural investigation

Fig. 1(a) shows a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the as-grown solid solution CdSxSe1−x on ∼25 nm sized TiO2 crystal grains after 6 cycles of SILAR deposition (denoted 6CdSxSe1−x). For comparison, the cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe (the best performing sensitizer of the analogue) was also measured (Fig. 1(b)). It is evident that, while the lattice fringes of the TiO2 crystal grains are clearly seen, their surface is covered with a layer of 4–5 nm thick amorphous material after the SILAR deposition, which is presumably the deposited solid solution 6CdSxSe1−x or 5CdS/5CdSe.
 Fig. 1  HRTEM images of (a) solid solution 6CdSxSe1−x and (b) cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe deposited on TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25). 
The compositions of the as-prepared sensitizers were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis, which yielded an atomic ratio Cd/(S + Se) of 0.90 for 6CdSxSe1−x and 0.98 for 5CdS/5CdSe, indicating that on average the solid solution was slightly cadmium poor, while the cascaded layers were almost stoichiometric. From the EDS elemental analysis the calculated formula of the solid solution was found to be Cd0.9S0.42Se0.58 in terms of the atomic ratio Se/S = 1.403, which is coincidentally very close to the hexagonal CdS0.42Se0.58 (JCPDS No. 50-0720). It is anticipated that the composition of CdSxSe1−x can feasibly be tuned by controlling the deposition parameters, such as temperature, concentration of precursor solution, solvent, and duration for reaction and rinsing steps etc., with which the optical and electrical properties of CdSxSe1−x will then be easily modulated.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of 6Cd0.9S0.42Se0.58 and 5CdS/5CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes before and after heat-treatment. In order to avoid interference from the FTO substrate, all samples for XRD measurements were made with TiO2 films printed on glass microscope slides. The XRD patterns of CdS and CdSe were also collected for comparison (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2, both the rutile (JCPDS No. 89-4920) and anatase (JCPDS No. 89-4921) phases are clearly seen in the bare TiO2 (Degussa P25) electrode. In contrast, the XRD pattern of Cd0.9S0.42Se0.58-sensitized TiO2 shows features only from TiO2, indicating that the as-grown solid solution is amorphous in nature. However, after heat treatment at 350 °C under vacuum (∼10−6 mbar) for 2 hours, broad peaks appear at 42.75° and 50.71°, implying crystallization of the amorphous phase (Fig. 2). The set of diffraction peaks is fairly close to those of individual CdSe and CdS—with the 2θ values slightly larger than for the former while smaller than for the latter.17,30 We noticed that 5CdS/5CdSe exhibits a similar XRD pattern after calcination at 350 °C, which is plausibly the result of alloying between CdSe and CdS at elevated temperature considering the favourable thermodynamics for near ideal miscibility between these two materials and their intimate contact at the mesoscopic level. The shift of the XRD peaks of CdSxSe1−x relative to those of CdSe and CdS indicates a decrease in the spacing of the crystal planes of CdSxSe1−x with respect to CdSe due to the incorporation of S2− into the CdSe host lattice. In general, these results indicate a composition of the solid solution in between CdS and CdSe obtained by using a fixed precursor concentration during SILAR deposition, which is further confirmed by the distinct absorption spectrum from that of cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe in UV-vis measurement.

Optical properties of nCdSxSe1−x-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
The optical density (OD) spectra of nCdS, nCdSe, and nCdSxSe1−x (n = 1–8) sensitized TiO2 electrodes are depicted in Fig. 3. The thickness of these electrodes is 2.4 μm. With increasing deposition cycles, the absorption onsets of the nCdS and nCdSe-sensitized electrodes shift to longer wavelength due to size-induced electronic quantization of the band structure.
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis spectra of individual (a) CdS, CdSe, and (b) solid solution nCdSxSe1−x-coated TiO2 electrodes with different SILAR deposition cycles (n = 1–8). The spectrum of cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe-sensitized TiO2 is also included in (b) for comparison. 
Meanwhile, a characteristic absorption shoulder appears at around 550–650 nm in the CdSe-sensitized electrodes, which shifts gradually to longer wavelength with increasing SILAR deposition cycles as shown in Fig. 3(a). Cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe-sensitized electrodes were also measured, and were found to exhibit similar characteristic absorption at ∼600 nm due to the preferential growth of CdSe on the pre-deposited CdS underlayer (solid line with circular marks in Fig. 3(b)).5,41 In contrast, these humps are missing in the spectra of nCdSxSe1−x-sensitized TiO2 electrodes, indicating that the alternate deposition leads to the formation of solid solution, distinct from the cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe where both CdSe and CdS are separated phases. Similarly, the absorbance of CdSxSe1−x continuously increases with the number of alternate CdS and CdSe deposition cycles on TiO2, while the shift of absorption onsets of these spectra (Fig. 3b) is less significant compared with that of CdSe in Fig. 3a. In addition, the incorporation of S2− into the resulting CdSxSe1−x gives rise to a significant blue shift of the spectrum as compared to that of pure CdSe for the same number of deposition cycles, which is also clearly revealed by the spectra of 5CdSxSe1−x and 5CdS/5CdSe in Fig. 3(b). This indicates that the band gap of the CdSe-based light absorber can facilely be tuned by changing the deposition mode which results in varied compositions. In addition, 5CdS/5CdSe has slightly higher OD than that of the solid solution for the same deposition cycles (5CdSxSe1−x) over most of the wavelength range, while its absorbance becomes lower at wavelengths beyond 700 nm. The slightly higher OD of nCdSxSe1−x at longer wavelength becomes more apparent for n > 5, which is believed to be partly due to increased light scattering but which also contributes to the light harvesting in SSCs as shown later by IPCE spectra.4,5 To study their photoelectrochemical properties, these as-prepared electrodes were used directly for device fabrication and characterizations in the subsequent sections.
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of nCdSxSe1−x-sensitized mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes (n = 6, 7 and 8), solar cells were fabricated with platinised FTO and sulfided brass (Cu2S) as the counter electrode, and an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte as the hole transporter. To facilitate charge transport and prevent recombination at the TiO2/sensitizer/electrolyte interfaces, TiO2 electrodes were pre-treated with TiCl4 aqueous solution prior to sensitizer deposition, and post-treated by depositing a thin passivation layer of ZnS onto the sensitized electrodes by SILAR. According to the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Fig. 4(a), all the cells exhibit strong photo-response over the entire visible light range, with converted photon wavelengths even extending to ∼900 nm. In comparison, while the CdSxSe1−x cells present identical IPCE of ∼75% between 350 and 650 nm to that of 5CdS/5CdSe, with increasing deposition cycles enhanced quantum efficiency is observed with the CdSxSe1−x cells at longer wavelengths, which is apparently consistent with the increased OD in Fig. 3(b) and indicates that this is not solely caused by light losses arising from the direct transmission measurement geometry. Fig. 4(b) shows the j–V characteristics of these cells. The photocurrent generally increased with increasing SILAR deposition cycles but the overall cell performance declined as a result of inferior fill factor and Voc. Among all the solid solution electrodes, cells made with 7CdSxSe1−x show the best performance, yielding jsc = 14.96 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.526 V, fill factor = 51.40%, and η = 4.05% under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination as listed in Table 1. In comparison, cells made with the optimized cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe-sensitized electrode yielded jsc=14.68 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.558 V, fill factor = 50.21%, and η = 4.12%. Evidently, the power conversion efficiency of CdSxSe1−x-sensitized SSCs is fairly comparable to the best-performing cascaded 5CdS/5CdSe cells (Table 1). Cells with enhanced stability were also fabricated using platinised FTO as the counter electrode for impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements. The characteristics of the cells made with platinised cathodes are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI†).

Sulfided brass (Cu2S) counter electrode and aqueous polysulfide electrolyte were used for all cells.

Charge transport and transfer investigation
To understand the charge collection and separation kinetics in CdSxSe1−x-sensitized devices, impedance spectroscopic (IS) measurements were carried out with 6CdSxSe1−x cells utilizing platinised FTO as the counter electrode for improved stability. In addition, only the transparent mesoporous TiO2 layer was used in the sensitized photoanode to simplify the interpretation of impedance data. For photovoltages in the range of 0.1–0.3 V, a well-defined Warburg-like feature can be observed in the intermediate frequency region of the spectra, which can be assigned to electron transport in the TiO2 layer. A good fit to most spectra could be obtained using an equivalent circuit based on the diffusion-reaction model for a porous electrode, as described by Bisquert.42
The fits of charge transfer resistance (Rct) and transport resistance (Rt) at different open-circuit photovoltages are plotted in Fig. 5(c). Apparently, both Rct and Rt attenuate exponentially with increasing bias voltage at elevated illumination intensity. The effective electron diffusion length (Ln) can be determined by Rct and Rt in terms of . As shown in Fig. 5(d), Ln is calculated to be ∼6 times as long as the TiO2 film thickness (d) at lower bias and becomes even longer at higher bias, ensuring almost unity charge collection.43

Charge transfer resistance (Rct) and transport resistance (Rt) (c), and chemical capacitance (Cμ) and electron diffusion length divided by film thickness (Ln/d) (d) obtained from IS fitting result and plotted versus open-circuit photovoltage (VOC). 

Fig. 5 also compiles the kinetic parameters of the 5CdS/5CdSe cell obtained from IS measurements under similar conditions. As shown in Fig. 5(c), Rct for the 6CdSxSe1−x cell was slightly lower than for the cell made with 5CdS/5CdSe when the bias potential is higher. This indicates a higher recombination rate in the former cells, explaining the slightly lower Voc of the 6CdSxSe1−x cells as compared to that of 5CdS/5CdSe (Table S1, ESI†). In contrast, while the exact reason is to be elucidated, the Rt of the 5CdS/5CdSe cell is almost 10 times larger than that of the 6CdSxSe1−x cell in the measurable potential range, which yields a much shorter diffusion length. However, since Ln is still at least 2 times longer than the film thickness, the charge collection loss should not be an issue in 5CdS/5CdSe cells. On the other hand, the Cμ–Voc plots of both cells are nearly identical. It has recently been reported that the chemical capacitance of semiconductor-sensitized TiO2 measured by impedance spectroscopy is a combination of localized states in both TiO2 and semiconductor sensitizer, which are indistinguishable by IS techniques.44 However, in the present case the density of localized states, which may contribute to the recombination, is rather close regardless of the sensitizer on the surface. A similar phenomenon was also observed in a previous comparative study between CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2. To unambiguously understand the detailed origins of the localized states and their roles in interfacial charge recombination, a systematic study is required, which is beyond the scope of the present work.
Conclusions
Ternary solid solution CdSxSe1−x was successfully synthesized by the SILAR method (which only involves alternate deposition of CdS and CdSe layers under ambient conditions) and used as sensitizer for mesoscopic TiO2 for the first time. By tuning the composition or changing the number of deposition cycles of the constituent materials, the optical band gap and consequently the band energies of CdSxSe1−x can feasibly be adjusted between the energy levels of CdSe and CdS of similar dimensions. The as-prepared amorphous CdSxSe1−x on TiO2 exhibits excellent photovoltaic performance when used as light absorber for SSCs, which is comparable to the more commonly studied cascaded CdS/CdSe electrodes. Using aqueous polysulfide solution as electrolyte and Cu2S as counter electrode, a power conversion efficiency of 4.05% was achieved with 6CdSxSe1−x-sensitized TiO2 as photoanode under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The findings of the present study provide a viable alternative approach to tuning the energetics of semiconductor sensitizers, especially for those with narrow band gaps, such as PbS, PbSe, etc., to achieve favourable band alignment for efficient charge separation in SSCs. We believe that the use of semiconductor solid solutions as sensitizers opens up a new avenue for the further improvement of the performance of SSCs.
