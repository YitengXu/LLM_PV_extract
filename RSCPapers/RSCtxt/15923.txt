The major drawback of photovoltaic solar power is that electricity generation is directly coupled to fluctuating and intermittent solar irradiation (e.g. day and night, weather), which makes it unable to provide continuous, steady, reliable energy supply.1–3 Converting solar-electricity into chemical energy stored in external electrochemical energy storage devices could address the above issue.4–8 In fact, the electrical energy produced from solar cell panels is transported to storage devices through external electric wires. This approach suffers from problems such as complex and expensive structures, and substantial energy loss during the multistep energy conversion and storage process.8,9 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an integrated system with simplified processes to simultaneously realize optical energy harvesting and electrical energy storage within one device.2,3,8 Then, the stored energy can be released and used all through the day, even if the sun is not shining. Recently, different photo-rechargeable electrochemical energy storage systems (i.e. photo-batteries and photo-capacitors) have been developed.3,10,11 A photo-capacitor uses solar light to generate electrical energy, which is directly stored by an integral storage assembly.
On the other hand, although the adoption of conventional photovoltaics on rooftops and in solar farms has grown rapidly in the past decade, the development of building-integrated photovoltaics directly into facades is still a challenge.12 To this end, the development of transparent and translucent facades capable of transforming part of the incident sunlight into electricity (i.e. active solar facades) is needed. In particular, transparent energy storage devices (supercapacitors and batteries), exhibiting high optical transparency, represent the technological frontier and have attracted extensive attention from both academia and industry.13–18 Transparent all-solid-state supercapacitor devices with both superior electrochemical performance and relatively high optical transparency have been reported by our group.16–18 Moreover, and following the idea discussed above, the development of a transparent integrated energy conversion and storage device is a challenging task. Only very few reports of solid-state photocapacitors were found in the literature and they were based on a dye sensitized TiO2 photoanode19–21 or on a device with a perovskite solar cell part,22,23 but these devices were not transparent or they lost transmittance during cycling.23
The electrolyte plays an important role in the photocapacitor, as it should have a high ionic conductivity as well as a high transmittance. Two transparent electrolytes based on PVP have been developed by our group and tested on supercapacitors: one with a lithium salt as a dopant16 and the other using an ionic liquid to obtain a final ion gel electrolyte,18 finding an improvement with the second one.
This work deals with the fabrication and characterization of a transparent photocapacitor using a photoanode of TiO2 obtained by magnetron sputtering with an average thickness measured by FE-SEM of 790 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†), a counter electrode made of LiFeO2–Ag, with an average thickness of 130 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†), developed by our group,24 and an ion gel electrolyte previously developed by our group as well,18 having all these components’ high transmittance in the visible range (see the ESI†).
The operating principle of this photocapacitor has been interpreted as follows: under light illumination, the TiO2 film (which has a rutile structure (Fig. S2, ESI†)) is photo-excited, resulting in partial positive charge in the TiO2–ion gel interface. The BF4− ions are attracted to that positive charge, provoking the separation of the ion gel charge, and a double layer is formed. Simultaneously, the ion gel cations [HemIm]+ go to the LiFeO2–ion gel interface, which is negatively charged as a cathode. Then, a double layer supercapacitor base is formed. On the other hand, in the dark, the double layer reorganizes itself again during the discharge of the device.
In Fig. 1a, a scheme of the photocapacitor developed in this work shows the different components and the illumination mechanism. Fig. 1b shows the cyclic voltammetries carried out at different scan rates from 25 to 200 mV s−1, obtaining higher areas of the curves at higher scan rates, as expected. With the aim of testing the specific energy and specific capacitance of the photocapacitor, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in the dark at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 1c). The resulting values are plotted in Fig. 1d, with 6 cm2 being the sample area. Specific capacitances from 2.78 μF cm−2 to 2.98 μF cm−2 were achieved under dark conditions depending on the voltammetry cycle number. On the other hand, specific energies from 0.50 μJ cm−2 to 0.54 μJ cm−2 were obtained. Both values decreased with the cycle number, but this decrease was not very relevant taking into account the number of cycles that were carried out (1200).

They were measured up to 1200 cycles (in the dark). (d) Specific energy (○) and specific capacitance (●) obtained from the CV curves for the photocapacitor. 
Further insights into the photocapacitor device characteristics were gained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, which were performed at four different applied bias potentials (E = 0.2 V, 0.3 V, 0.4 V and 0.5 V) under dark conditions. Fig. 2a and b show typical Nyquist and Bode plots for the photocapacitor device under study at an applied bias potential E = 0.2 V. These EIS spectra can be simulated by the modeled equivalent circuit as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2a. In fact, the total cell impedance can be accurately modeled as a serial combination of three circuit components: (i) two parallel combinations, where one of the parallel branches in each of them is a resistance (R1 or R3), while the other one is constituted by a constant phase shift element (CPE1 or CPE2); and (ii) a serial resistance, R2, denoting the electrolyte solution resistance. The fits are indicated by dotted lines in the plots, and showed good agreement with the data, confirming the suitability of the equivalent circuit model used. In this way, the values of the resistive elements and the CPE parameters (Q constant phase element with power α, see the note of Table 1) were extracted. The obtained values for R2 for the four different applied bias potentials are presented in Table 1. From the Nyquist and Bode plots, a significant capacitive behavior of the device can be inferred, where each interface exhibited a time constant at ca. 10 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. The first of them is characterized by the first part of the equivalent circuit (R1‖CPE1, see the inset of Fig. 2a), and the obtained values are depicted in Table 1. As alpha value is nearly 1, this indicates that this CPE can be approached to a capacitance of a rough surface, which is confirmed by AFM characterization, where the LiFeO2 and TiO2 electrodes exhibited roughness values of 14.3 nm and 31.3 nm, respectively (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The second interface is also characterized by a similar equivalent circuit (R3‖CPE2, see the inset of Fig. 2a), with alpha mean values also close to 1; again this CPE2 can be associated with a capacitance. However, and in spite of the symmetry of the circuit, the values of the resistances R1 and R3 (even though low) differ by three orders of magnitude, indicating low charge transfer rate processes in both interfaces. Moreover, by comparing the Bode spectra for the four different applied bias potentials, it can be concluded that the capacity values remain constant irrespective of the applied bias potential.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles carried out in the dark at ±0.17 μA cm−2 (Fig. 3a) show the stability of the photocapacitor. As shown in Fig. 3b, the photocapacitor was illuminated under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) from 0 V for 10 min, reaching ca. 0.5 V, and then a galvanostatic discharge was carried out at 0.17 μA cm−2 in the dark (grey shadow). The inset of Fig. 3b shows the galvanostatic discharge at different current densities from 1.7 to 17 μA cm−2 in the dark. As expected, the discharge time decreases with the current density applied, achieving 100 s for the lowest value of current density. This discharge time could be comparable to those of other photocapacitors of which the discharge current was higher.20,22 Some cycles of photocharge and galvanostatic discharge (in the dark) carried out at 0.17 μA cm−2 are presented in Fig. 3c, which confirms the stability of the photocapacitor through the cycling process.

(c) Some cycles of photocharge/galvanostatic discharge at 0.17 μA cm−2. Cycle numbers are indicated. (d) Optical transmittance spectra of the photocapacitor with the ion gel as electrolyte before (dark color) and after (red color) cycling. The inset shows a digital photograph of the transparent device after cycling, letting us see the logo of the Universidad de Málaga underneath it. 
In order to investigate the transparency properties of the photocapacitor, optical transmittance measurements were performed for the separated components (Fig. S4, ESI†) and the whole device before and after cycling (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3d shows the visible–near IR region optical transmittance of the whole device, with the ion gel as electrolyte, exhibiting optical transmittances of about 57% and 54% at λ = 555 nm (the optical transmittance was evaluated at this wavelength because the photopic eye sensitivity function has maximum sensitivity in the green spectral range at 555 nm) before and after cycling. So, a transparent photocapacitor has been obtained, considering that it retains a high transmittance after the cycling. The inset of Fig. 3d shows a digital photograph of the complete device after cycling, showing its level of transparency, letting us see the logo of the Universidad de Málaga underneath it. In the literature, there have been some works reporting the preparation and characterization of photocapacitor devices, but not all of them are optically transparent to the visible spectrum.19–22 At best, Zhou et al. informed the assemblage of a photocapacitor exhibiting at least a transmittance of 70%, however it darkness during the charging process;23 so it could be said that this is the first work reporting a transparent photocapacitor device. However, a modest overall efficiency under 1% was obtained (calculated following eqn (S1), see the ESI†) so there is more work to do to improve this efficiency without declining the transparency of the photocapacitor.
In summary, a transparent photocapacitor was developed, using an ion gel as electrolyte. Although the photocharge and galvanostatic discharge time values of the photocapacitor developed in this work would not be comparable with other similar devices found in the literature (because of the low discharge current we applied), this would be a new concept of device showing a high transmittance in the visible range, allowing its application in windows of self-sustaining buildings or as storage in photo-sensors. Moreover, in this work no dye molecules were used to sensitize the electrodes, so it is also a new concept of a low-cost photocapacitor.
