    , Accepted 10th February 2019First published on 11th February 2019AbstractThe practical utilization of solar-driven water splitting is restricted by the difficulty of this type of splitting in producing hydrogen and oxygen molecules with the same photocatalyst. For the separate delivery of photo-generated electron and hole carries to the reduction and oxidation sites in photocatalysts, close reduction–oxidation distances are required, which, however, promote reverse reactions or even damaging explosions due to the mixing of hydrogen and oxygen-containing products. To overcome this challenge, we designed a hybrid structure of carbon-quantum-dots (CQDs) attached to a single-layered carbon nitride (C3N) material. Using first-principles calculations, we showed that the hybrid can harvest visible and infrared light for water splitting. It holds very close reduction–oxidation sites, ensuring the rapid delivery of photo-generated electrons and holes to the inner CQD and outer C3N layers separately. The holes then break the water molecules and produce protons at the outer C3N. Due to electrostatic attraction, the protons penetrate through C3N to react with the photo-generated electrons on CQD and produce hydrogen molecules. Since neither oxygen species nor hydrogen molecules can migrate through the C3N layer, hydrogen products are completely isolated from the oxygen species; this inhibits reverse reactions. These metal-free hybrids are thus appealing photocatalysts to integrate very close yet well-separated reduction–oxidation sites for practical solar energy conversion and hydrogen energy utilization.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting has drawn significant attention as a means of solar energy conversion. By absorbing photons, a photocatalyst creates energetic electron–hole pairs that can split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) molecules, thus converting solar power to hydrogen power.1,2 Among various types of developed photocatalysts, including metal oxides,3 sulfides,4 metal–organic frameworks,5 and low-dimensional materials,6 carbon-based two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibited advantages in terms of high surface area to volume ratio and good stability.7 Especially, 2D graphene functionalized by nitrogen atoms holds the merits of broadband solar energy harvesting, high catalytic activity, environmental-friendliness and low-cost properties due to the metal-free nature.8,9 For instance, graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) were used to composite with carbon quantum dots (CQD), resulting in an excellent solar energy conversion efficiency of 2–3% for water splitting.8
However, the practical utilization of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction has long been restricted by a problem: the difficulty of isolating hydrogen at the reduction sites from oxygen species at the oxidation sites such that to ensure both oxygen and hydrogen production. The produced hydrogen molecules can easily encounter the neighboring oxygen or oxygen-containing groups; this permits the occurrence of unwanted reverse reactions or even dangerous explosions. This problem originates from the very close distances between reduction–oxidation sites that respectively collect electron and hole carriers for hydrogen and oxygen generation. These close distances were determined because photo-generated charges can only be delivered within the short electron mean free paths (<50 nm).10 Moreover, protons generated at the reductive sites need to migrate to the oxidative sites to produce H2; this also requires a short reduction–oxidation distance. Huge efforts were made to balance the needs for close and separated reduction–oxidation sites in photocatalyst design, while the photocatalytic generation of both hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously remains challenging.
Our recent work provides a strategy for achieving very close yet well-separated reduction–oxidation sites in photocatalysts using graphene as a natural sieve,11 where photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen generation occurs at opposite sides of graphene. Since graphene allows only proton or hydrogen atoms to pass through, hydrogen products are isolated from oxygen species. Following this train of thought, we find that the newly fabricated carbon nitride C3N (Fig. 1a) material holds a higher potential than graphene, which is limited by the lack of photo-absorption ability and catalytic activity. The geometric and electronic structures of C3N were studied with density functional theory (DFT) prior to combination with CQD. C3N is a graphene-like planar hexagonal structure with the nitrogen uniformly distributed as shown in Fig. 1a, which contains two types of rings (C rings and NC rings). The computed lattice constants are a = b = 4.85 Å, and the both C–C and C–N bonds have a similar length of 1.40 Å, which are all consistent with previous reports.12–14 The computed partial density of states (PDOS) of C3N was shown in Fig. S1.† This shows that C3N is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.03 eV. The conduction band (CB) minimum and valence band (VB) maximum are both located at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone,13,14 with the former being dominated by C 2p orbitals, while the latter is equivalently contributed by C and N 2p orbitals. Such a feature has several advantages; first, the narrow bandgap allows the absorption of visible and infrared (IR) light.12 Second, C3N has spontaneous charge polarizations for promoting catalytic activity. Third, like graphene, C3N is a 2D material with a high conductivity for charge delivery as well as a high surface area-to-volume ratio-favoring catalysis.15 Importantly, C3N has hexagonal grids that allow only proton or hydrogen atoms to penetrate under mild conditions, leading to useful screening property for the separation of hydrogen molecules and oxygen-related species. Therefore, we proceeded to identify an optimum hole-donor for C3N that can be incorporated into a new system. CQDs—typically specified as graphite particles less than 10 nm in diameter—are seemingly ideal candidates that can act as excellent reservoirs for electron charges as well as good materials to harvest visible light.16 CQDs often hold lattice parameters close to that of C3N, resulting in a good lattice match in the hybrid structure of CQD/C3N, which ensures good stability and charge transferring ability. Recently, hybrid systems of CQD and graphitic carbon nitride have been fabricated in experiments, which were proven to have high photocatalytic performance for water splitting,8 suggesting the feasibility of experimentally fabricating 2D heterostructures.17 Our theoretical study then proposed a CQD/C3N hybrid of C3N enclosing CQDs to take advantage of the photocatalytic water splitting abilities of both materials and the mass transport selectivity of C3N.

(c) Photocatalytic (water splitting) hydrogen generation and storage scheme: (1) separating photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+); (2) water splitting driven by holes (h+) at C3N to produce protons (H+); (3) protons (H+) migrating across C3N and producing H2 molecules upon meeting photo-generated electrons (e−) at the CQD; (4) H2 molecules trapped inside the C3N layer. Here, respectively blue, brown, pink and red beads represent N, C, H (H+) and O atoms; yellow and cyan clouds represent photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+); and blue and purple arrows represent the migration of the corresponding particles. (d) Penetration barriers of H atoms, O atoms and H2 molecules through C3N. 
The diamond (111) facet was chosen to mimic a CQD surface (Fig. 1b), with which we built the CQD/C3N system of the outer C3N layer enclosing CQD (Fig. 1c). The working mechanism of hydrogen generation and storage isolated from oxygen is shown in Fig. 1c: (1) upon sunlight excitation, the generated excitons rapidly separated to form energetic electrons and holes. Importantly, electrons accumulated on the inner CQD, while holes accumulated on the outer C3N layer. (2) Holes at the oxidation sites of C3N attack adsorbed water molecules and promote water splitting for proton (H+) production. (3) Driven by electrostatic attraction and the concentration gradient, protons penetrate through C3N by overcoming a relatively low barrier of 2.30 eV (Fig. 1d and S2†), while oxygen-containing products are prevented from crossing due to the extremely high penetration barrier of 6.28 eV (Fig. S3†). After crossing, protons then combine with electrons on the reduction sites of CQD to produce H2 molecules. (4) Since C3N allows the penetration of only H atoms and protons (Fig. 1d), the product H2 cannot cross back through the C3N layer due to the prohibitively high energy (4.05 eV) required (Fig. S4†). The produced H2 is thus isolated from the oxygen species, being safely stored on the side of the C3N layer opposite them.
Computational details
All the computations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The all-electron projector augmented wave (PAW) model18 and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functions19 were employed. For electronic structure calculations, the state-of-the-art hybrid functional HSE06 was used.20 Van der Waals corrections were made using the DFT-D2 method.21 A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for the plane-wave expansion of the electronic wave function. The force and energy convergence criteria were set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. A k-point grid with a 6 × 6 × 1 Gamma-centered mesh was used for the pure C3N, QD and CQD/C3N unit cells. For the C3N supercells that were used to perform transition-state calculations, a corresponding number of k-points were used to keep the k-mesh spacing constant across different structures. Ultrafast charge evolution was performed with the surface hopping algorithm using the PYXAID (Python Extension for Ab Initio Dynamics) program at the Γ point.22 The temperature was set to be 100 K, and a 2.5 ps microcanonical trajectory was generated with a time step of 1 fs. The SSW HOWTOs program23 was applied to search for reasonable test structures, which were later used for transition state optimization, employing the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.24 Charge distribution analysis was done with the Bader model.25
Due to the structural complexity of CQDs in real systems, accurately modeling CQDs has always been a challenge. Carbon clusters26 or graphene quantum dots (GQD)27 are generally used as alternatives to CQDs for DFT calculations (Fig. S5†). Based on the calculated binding energies of 0.63–2.52 eV (Table S1†), CQD can form a stable contact with the C3N layer. Among all the CQD models, the diamond (111) facet was chosen for subsequent calculations (Fig. 1b). Compared with the carbon cluster and GQD models, this slab model has two advantages: (1) the optimized crystal constant of the diamond (111) facet (a = b = 4.85 Å) matches C3N (a = b = 5.03 Å) well with a lattice distortion of less than 4%, making it feasible to study the long-range interaction between CQD and C3N at the periodic boundary condition. (2) This model can well represent the hybrid orbital structure of CQD, due to the simultaneous existence of both sp2 and sp3 hybridization. Therefore if not otherwise specified, the CQDs are modeled by the diamond (111) facet. As simulated here, the diamond (111) facet model contains 8 layers of C atoms, in which the bottom 4 layers were fixed at the bulk crystal geometry, and other atoms were fully relaxed during structural optimization. To avoid artificial interaction between layers, a vacuum spacing of ∼15 Å was applied.
Results and discussion
The spontaneous interfacial charge polarizations in CQD/C3N were first examined. The distance between the adjacent CQD and C3N layers is found to be ∼2.87 Å, which is a van der Waals interaction that allows effective coupling with binding energies of 0.63–2.52 eV (Table S1†). Such a stable and close interfacial interaction has been proven to enable rapid charge migration.28,29 In our case, driven by the work function (WF) difference between the CQD (4.65 eV) and C3N (3.25 eV) (Fig. S6†), electrons tend to flow from the material with a higher potential level (lower WF) to the one with a lower potential level (higher WF), as depicted in Fig. S7,† generating electron–hole pairs as shown in Fig. 2a and leaving ∼0.06 h+ per unit on C3N. Based on the computed interfacial polarized charge distributions in carbon cluster/C3N and GQD/C3N systems (Fig. S8†), C3N accumulate holes with ∼0.11 and ∼0.01 h+ per unit for both models, respectively.

Then, the light absorption properties of CQD/C3N were studied. The simulated electronic band structures confirm the semiconductor features of bare CQD, C3N and CQD/C3N (Fig. S9–S11†) that enable solar energy harvesting. The computed absorption coefficients (Fig. 2b) reveal that bare C3N mainly absorb short-wavelength visible light (<600 nm), while CQD extends to ∼700 nm, which agree with previous observations.12,30 Importantly, the combination of both materials (CQD/C3N) extend the absorption range into the infrared (IR) range (∼900 nm), suggesting broadband light energy utilization.
The next key step is to separately and rapidly deliver photo-generated electrons and holes to reduction (CQD) and oxidation (C3N) sites. From the calculated PDOS of CQD/C3N (Fig. 2c), the valence band edge states consisted of both CQD and C3N states, while the bottom edge of the conduction band is dominated by CQD. This suggests that once the system is excited, photo-generated electrons transfer to CQD to occupy the conduction band edge while holes remain on C3N. The spatial evolution of photo-generated carriers after light excitation was simulated by putting an electron (or hole) with an energy higher than the conduction band edge (or lower than the valance band edge). As in Fig. 3a and b, both spin-up and spin-down electrons move from C3N to a CQD very rapidly within 2.5 ps. Correspondingly, photo-generated holes should follow an inverse trajectory, although their speeds are noticeably slower (Fig. 3c and d). Such an ultrafast charge separation processes can compete with electron–hole recombination in the ps–ns scale, ensuring the success of subsequent oxidation and reduction reactions. To provide a more intuitive image of the transition of the photoexcited charge, the more accurate time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were applied, as shown in Fig. S12.† The transition between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) indicates that the photoexcited electrons tend to transfer from C3N to CQD, which is in accordance with our ultrafast charge evolution results.

Here, simulations are done with working temperatures of 100 K, implying an even quicker charge migration at room temperature. 
The water splitting reaction occurring on the outer surface of the C3N oxidation sites was examined. The presence of a CQD induces the injection of holes into the C3N layer, which in turn causes a strong H2O adsorption energy of 0.23 eV. NEB calculations were performed to reveal the energy potential profile along the reaction coordinate. From the various configurations of adsorbed water and of the products tested (Fig. S13 and S14†), the most stable configurations were chosen as the initial and final structures, respectively. It was found that the hybrid catalyst lowers the water splitting barrier of pristine C3N (2.20 eV) down to 1.96 eV (Fig. 4a). Such a barrier is even lower than C3N4 (2.28 eV)31 and CN (2.12 eV),32 which have been widely applied in the field of photocatalysis.33,34

(e) Proposed schemes for hydrogen encapsulated storage or direct utilization. Light blue fill, gray spheres, and dark blue lines represent liquid water, CQDs and the C3N sieve, respectively; TS = transition state. 
After water splitting, protons—driven by the force of electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged QCD and the proton concentration gradient—migrate through the outer C3N layer and combine with photo-generated electrons on CQDs. The proton penetration barrier in the presence of a CQD was calculated to be 2.00 eV (Fig. 4b), which was readily overcome by the electrostatic interaction energy (2.83 eV) between a proton and the negatively charged CQD. Then, the proton forms a chemical bond on the CQD edge, which is an exothermic process that releases 4.70 eV of energy. This process is further validated by advanced ab initio MD simulation in VAPS for proton migration through the C3N sheet at room temperature (Fig. 4c and ESI Movie 1†). Another proton passing through C3N can then combine with the first bonded proton and two electrons to form a H2 molecule. Such a process may occur rapidly and efficiently due to the very low energy barrier of 0.15 eV (Fig. 4d). Since C3N allows only H atoms or protons to migrate across, the hydrogen molecule generated on the inner side is isolated from the oxygen species on the outer side. As a result, the unwanted reverse reaction of recombination is prohibited.
This CQD/C3N hybrid catalyst can be applied for both instance encapsulated hydrogen storage or direct utilization (Fig. 4e). Using a spherical C3N enclosed with many CQDs, H2 molecules produced via water splitting are confined inside the C3N capsule. Since the CQD clusters are attached to the C3N firmly, there is enough space left for H2 storage. This avoids the problem of breaking the hybrid interface due to a high H2 storage concentration. On the other hand, H2 can also be released for direct utilization.
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a CQD/C3N heterogeneous photocatalyst that isolates hydrogen generation from oxygen species during water splitting. It enables the full use of visible and IR light to generate energetic holes and electrons that are distributed on the C3N layers and CQDs, respectively. Importantly, it integrates very close yet well-separated reduction–oxidation sites so as to maintain high photocatalytic performance while protecting their corresponding hydrogen and oxygen products from mixing. After water splitting, protons migrate through the C3N layer to produce H2 on the inner CQD. The property of C3N that allows only protons to penetrate not only avoids unwanted reverse reactions but also permits isolated collections for hydrogen storage or direct utilization. This solves the issue of balancing distances of reduction–oxidation sites in photocatalyst design, paving the way for simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen generation toward realistic solar and hydrogen energy utilization.

Here, respectively blue, brown, pink and red beads represent N, C, H (H+) and O atoms; yellow and cyan clouds represent photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+); and blue and purple arrows represent the migration of the corresponding particles. (d) Penetration barriers of H atoms, O atoms and H2 molecules through C3N.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Differential charge distribution of the CQD/C3N structure. Differential charges were computed as Bader charge differences between the hybrid and the isolated CQD and C3N. Yellow and blue bubbles represent electron and hole charge distributions with an isosurface value of 0.0006 e Å−3. (b) Photo-absorption spectrum of bare C3N (red), CQD (blue) and CQD/C3N composite structure (black). The absorption band of CQD/C3N extends to ∼900 nm. (c) PDOS of the CQD/C3N hybrid.	 

 	Fig. 3  The time-evolution of the charge spatial distribution probabilities of photo-generated spin-up (a) and spin-down (b) electrons, and spin-up (c) and spin-down (d) hole carriers in the CQD/C3N composite structure. Here, simulations are done with working temperatures of 100 K, implying an even quicker charge migration at room temperature.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Energy potential profile along the water splitting process on the C3N surface in the presence (blue) or absence (red) of a CQD. (b) Energy potential profile of a hydrogen atom migrating through the C3N layer and binding on a CQD edge. (c) Schematic snapshots of the ab initio MD simulations for hydrogen migration through the C3N sheet and binding onto CQD. (d) Two hydrogen atoms react at a CQD to form a hydrogen molecule. (e) Proposed schemes for hydrogen encapsulated storage or direct utilization. Light blue fill, gray spheres, and dark blue lines represent liquid water, CQDs and the C3N sieve, respectively; TS = transition state.
