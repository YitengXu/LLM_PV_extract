    , Accepted 12th January 2020First published on 14th January 2020AbstractIn this study, we report a new BODIPY-based design, called the cross-conjugated design, that takes advantage of the α- and β-position functionalization of the BODIPY core. After synthesis, and compared to a more standard BODIPY dye, using similar functional groups and based on a horizontal design, called h-BOD, the new cross-conjugated BODIPY dye (cc-BOD) exhibits clearly the highest conjugation and light harvesting properties. Consequently, when used as photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), an impressive improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been observed, with a PCE of 6.02% with broad incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for cc-BOD, compared to only 3.7% for h-BOD. Moreover, by co-sensitizing a DSSC with the two complementary absorbing dyes h-BOD and cc-BOD, we further improved the PCE up to 6.2%.
1. Introduction
Since their first inception in 1992 by Gratzel,1 dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been a popular solar energy source due to their versatility easy fabrication process, light weight and flexible physical structure. Generally, DSSCs are fabricated with an electrode, a dye sensitizer, electrolytes, and a counter electrode sandwiched between two transparent conducting substrates.2,3 Among all the components, the dye contributes to determining the photovoltaic response of the overall device by harvesting efficiently and by injecting the photo-generated electrons and holes into, respectively, the semiconductor oxide and the redox electrolyte, with matched energy levels.4,5 In this regard, a vast amount of dyes have been implemented in DSSCs, which can be categorized into metal-based dyes and organic dyes. In terms of photovoltaic responses, metal-based dyes show superior performances but due to low yield and scarcity of source materials they remain quite unattractive.6,7 Metal free organic dyes with easy synthesis processes have shown promising or even equal photovoltaic performances in DSSCs.8–11 The advantages of organic dyes over metal-based dyes rely on their ability to absorb light of specific wavelengths with high molar extinction coefficients.12–14 The molecular engineering and tailoring of different light absorbing functional groups can lead to light harvesting tuning over a broad spectral range resulting in highly efficient DSSCs.15–21 Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are among the most widely considered chromophores thanks to their unique optical properties, including high absorption coefficients in the visible and NIR ranges and high fluorescence quantum yields.22 In addition, BODIPY dyes often exhibit high stability in various media. Last but not least, the large number of reactive chemical positions allows very fine tuning of their opto-electronic properties. Therefore, BODIPY-based molecules have found application in numerous fields such as Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs),23 bio-labeling,24 photodynamic therapy,25 and photovoltaic devices, including organic26 and hybrid technologies.27
The numerous chemical modifications of the BODIPY core have made it possible to highlight the weak points of this chemical building block that need to be improved to increase the dye performances in DSSCs and consequently the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).28–31 These issues are as follows (i) A weak regeneration driving force between the ground state oxidation potential (highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO) of the dye and the redox potential of the iodine/iodide redox electrolyte.32 (ii) A weak driving force for the injection of the excited state electron into the TiO2 resulting from the usual inappropriate alignment of the BODIPY dye's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level being too close to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 photoanode. Consequently, the BODIPY based DSSCs often show low incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE).33,34 (iii) A strong aggregation of the flat BODIPY sensitizers on the surface of TiO2 leading to low charge recombination, which decreases the device open-circuit photovoltage.
Chemical engineering has already brought some positive answers to these issues, such as the variation of the number of functionalized groups grafted onto the 3, 5-positions of the BODIPY core, allowing the tuning of the final dye LUMO level.35 Similarly, the aggregation related issue could be addressed by playing with the steric hindrance of side chains. For instance, the boron substitution by inert alkynyl–oligoethylene glycol chains has been shown to be a good strategy to increase both solubility and stability and to suppress the dye aggregation.36,37 However, despite the positive evolution of chemical designs and device efficiencies, the rationalization of the chemical structure–photovoltaic properties relationship is still difficult. Therefore, new dye investigations are required. In a recent review related to the use of BODIPY dyes for DSSC application, Klfout et al.28 defined two distinct dye design strategies (see Fig. 1), i.e., the vertical design in which the functional electron-donor (D) and electron-acceptor (A) groups are grafted vertically to the BODIPY core main plane, by using the 3- and 5-positions (usually for D) on one side and the 8 (meso)-position for the A group grafting; and the horizontal design in which the D and A groups are grafted horizontally, on each side of the BODIPY core, by using the 2- and 6-positions of the BODIPY molecule.
 Fig. 1  (Top) Chemical design strategies; (bottom) molecular structures of h-BOD and cc-BOD. 
In this study, we report an innovative design, called the cross-conjugated design, by combining the horizontal and vertical design in one single dye (see Fig. 1). Indeed, we used three different (2, 3 and 5) positions to substitute the electron donor groups and position 6 to graft the electron-acceptor/anchoring group (see Fig. 1, cc-BOD). In order to validate this chemical design, we also synthesized a reference model, based on the only horizontal design by removing the donor groups in the 3- and 5-positions (see Fig. 1, h-BOD). The synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, electrochemistry, and photovoltaic properties of these compounds have been evaluated in detail. The cross-conjugated BODIPY dye, cc-BOD, exhibits a very broad absorption spectrum up to 760 nm, when adsorbed on the TiO2 photoanode and leads to a high PCE value of 6.02% when used as a sensitizer in a DSSC. Interestingly, the simpler h-BOD dye showed a narrower and blue-shifted absorption range, limited to 650 nm leading to a lower PCE value of only 3.7%. The differences in the photovoltaic responses validate our new cross-conjugated design. Finally, by utilizing the complementary absorption spectra of both dyes, co-sensitized DSSCs were successfully fabricated to a slightly increased PCE of 6.20%.
2. Experimental section
The starting compounds in Scheme 1 were prepared according to the reported studies32–34 and are described in detail in the ESI S3 and Fig. S1–S5.† The double layer TiO2 photoanode with a thickness of 15 μm (a 10 μm transparent layer with titania particles about 20 nm and a 5 μm scattering layer with titania particles about 400 nm) on top of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass and the DSSCs was fabricated following the methodology of our previous work.36 Briefly, prior to dye adsorption the TiO2 film was further treated with 0.1 M solution of HCl. A solution of BODIPY dyes (2 × 10−4 M) and deoxycholic acid (1 × 10−2 M) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1/1, v/v) was used as a dye bath for a single h-BOD or cc-BOD based DSSC. For the co-sensitized DSSCs, the TiO2 photoanodes were immersed into a mixed dye solution of h-BOD and cc-BOD with a molar ratio of 1:2 (1.3 × 10−4 M:2.6 × 10−4 M) containing 1 × 10−2 M deoxycholic acid in 1:1 acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol. The electrodes were immersed in the dye solutions and then kept at 35 °C for 12 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface. Each BODIPY-coated TiO2 film and a Pt-coated conducting glass were separated by a 40 μm thick polymer-based spacer (Surlyn) and sealed by heating the Surlyn frame at 100 °C. An electrolyte consisting of a mixture of I2 (0.05 M), LiI (0.1 M), dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (0.6 M), and tert-butylpyridine (0.05 M) in acetonitrile was used. BODIPY dye coated TiO2 films were immersed in 0.1 M TBAOH solution (1:1 mixture of H2O and ethanol) to desorb the dyes. The absorption peak of each resulting BODIPY single and co-sensitized dye solution was used to estimate the amount of adsorbed dye. To measure the absorption spectra of dye coated TiO2 films, transparent TiO2 films of about 8 μm were immersed into the above single and mixed dye baths containing 1 × 10−2 M deoxycholic acid and then kept at 35 °C for 10 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface. Absorption spectra of these BODIPY dye coated transparent TiO2 films were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrometer. The details of the method for the characterization of solar cells have been provided in ESI S1 and S2.†

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of BODIPY dyes h-BOD and cc-BOD
The cross-conjugated design involved in this work is partially inspired by the work of Gratzel et al. on the YD2-o-C8 porphyrin derivative.38 Indeed, based on our knowledge regarding the functionalization of BODIPY molecules for light harvesting applications, we have grafted vinyl-thiophene groups on the 3- and 5-positions,39 in order to obtain a wide electronic delocalization. The original idea of this work is to take advantage of BODIPY's chemical versatility to add a lateral push–pull effect by functionalizing in 2- and 6-positions. The synthesis of compounds 1, A and B can be found in the ESI† as well as details regarding the chemical analysis of all compounds. The 3,5-difunctionalized BODIPY 2 has been obtained by a Knoevenagel reaction between the BODIPY 1, never reported in the literature, and the aldehyde A (usually in excess) in the presence of piperidine and trace amounts of p-TsOH. The color of the reaction mixture was used to follow the reaction steps (magenta for mono-substitution and blue for the expected di-substitution). From this stage, the two h-BOD and cc-BOD dyes are synthesized in the same way, following exactly identical synthesis steps. Thus, the second step made use of a Grignard reagent capable of transforming the BF2 fragment into B(alkynylPEG)2 (Scheme 1). The substitution of the first iodo group with the triphenylamine derivative, B, was achieved through Suzuki coupling in the presence of K2CO3 and [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] (compounds 5 and 6), while the second iodo group was substituted with phenylcarboxyester using NEt3 and copper iodide in the presence of [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] catalyst to give compounds 7 and 8, respectively. Finally, the resulting esters were hydrolyzed to the acids, leading to the target dyes h-BOD and cc-BOD, respectively. All the synthesized compounds were characterized using NMR (see the ESI†).
3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical characteristics of both new BODIPY dyes were inspected and are summarized in Table 1. Absorption and emission spectra in THF solution of both dyes are illustrated in Fig. 2. The model compound, h-BOD, exhibits a quite narrow two-band absorption spectrum. The lower energy band, centered at 553 nm, has strangely no vibronic signature, as usually observed in BODIPY-based dyes. The related molar extinction coefficient value is 54000 M−1 cm−1. The band at higher energy could be attributed to the triphenylamine group absorption. The h-BOD emission spectrum (see Fig. S6†) shows a broad feature and a large Stokes shift of 2600 cm−1 with regard to the absorption. This is a signature of a strong molecular polarization in the excited state, as already shown in the literature for many β-functionalized BODIPY dyes.40 The cc-BOD spectroscopic features are quite different. Its absorption spectrum has three absorption maxima and is significantly red-shifted compared to the model compound. The one with the lowest energy is at 688 nm and can be attributed to the S0 → S1 transition.41 This time, a clear vibronic structure can be observed, with a first shoulder at 628 nm and a second one, lower in intensity, at about 580 nm. The molar extinction coefficient associated with this transition is 103000 M−1 cm−1. The second transition is around 400 nm and seems to be split. As described previously in the literature,39 this transition can be attributed to the absorption of vinyl-thiophene arms. However, because of the unsymmetrical functionalization of cc-BOD in the 2, 6-positions, these two moieties are no longer equivalent in this case and, consequently, the absorption is split into two bands. The last transition at 310 nm corresponds to the absorption of the triphenylamine group. The characterization of the absorption properties highlights very well the strong and positive impact of our new cross-conjugated design strategy with a dye that exhibits a broader and intense absorption all along the UV-visible range. The cc-BOD molecule emits light with a maximum located at 708 nm and a good quantum fluorescence efficiency of 33% (see Fig. S7†). With the shoulder at lower energy, this band is characteristic of the BODIPY S1 → S0 transition. This spectrum is the mirror image of the absorption spectrum and Stokes shift of around 410 cm−1 could be measured. From UV-visible solution measurements optical bandgaps have been measured, 2.06 eV and 1.71 eV, for h-BOD and cc-BOD, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of h-BOD and cc-BOD dyes adsorbed on TiO2 film. Due to carboxylic groups of dyes that interact with TiO2, the spectra look broad. However, we clearly observed similar trends with the previous solution measurement, including a really much broader spectrum for the cc-BOD up to the NIR region as compared to the h-BOD dye.

To compute the electron transfer from the excited state of dye molecules to the conduction band of the respective TiO2, the ionization potentials (IPs), equivalent to ground state oxidation potentials, of h-BOD and cc-BOD anchored to TiO2 film were measured (Fig. S8 and S9†) using a photoemission yield spectrometer (PESA; Riken Keiki AC-3E). The findings are summarized in Table 1. An expression E0(D+/D*) = IP − E0−0, has been utilized to evaluate the excited state oxidation potential (E0(D+/D*)) levels of h-BOD and cc-BOD which showed values of −3.81 and −4.03 eV, respectively (Table 1). Compared with the h-BOD cross-conjugated BODIPY dye, cc-BOD exhibits a decrease in the E0−0 energy gap which leads to a red shift of the absorption bands with comparatively positive E0(D+/D*) levels. The E0(D+/D*) for h-BOD and cc-BOD are located over the conduction band edge of the TiO2.42 Therefore, an efficient excited-state injection into the conduction band of TiO2 is expected for the DSSCs fabricated with h-BOD and cc-BOD dyes (Fig. 4). Apparently, the ground state oxidation potentials (equivalent to the ionization potential, IP) were more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (−5.2 eV), which indicates efficient dye regeneration. HOMO levels of h-BOD and cc-BOD were estimated, by cyclic voltammetry (CV), to be about −5.46 eV and −5.36 eV, respectively (Fig. S12 and Table S1†). If we consider the expected down-shifting of HOMO levels when the dyes are grafted onto the TiO2, these HOMO level values, obtained by CV, are comparable with those obtained from PESA measurement on TiO2 thin-films (deprotonation of the dye's carboxylic acid group to be covalently bonded to the TiO2). The redox processes of the dyes were reproducible as shown in Fig. S12b and c.†

3.3. Photovoltaic properties
Due to the high appealing optoelectronic properties of cc-BOD and to a lesser extent of h-BOD, DSSCs were fabricated. The elaboration procedures have been reported in Section 2. The photovoltaic parameters measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) have been summarized in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 5 (ESI Table S2†). DSSCs sensitized with cc-BOD showed high photovoltaic response in the VIS-NIR region with a broad IPCE of approximately 60% in the 350–720 nm range (Fig. 5a). Consequently, the cc-BOD dye-based devices exhibit pretty high photovoltaic performances with a PCE of 6.02% at the maximum, including high photovoltaic parameters, short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 15.43 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 71%, except for the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) which remains moderate (Fig. 5b). Devices formed from h-BOD also showed IPCE > 60% but a really blue-shifted and narrow wavelength range (350–570 nm). Consequently, the PCE is much lower, 3.70%, mainly because of a decreased Jsc of 9.69 mA cm−2. The Voc and FF were really close to the ones previously measured with cc-BOD. From these photovoltaic measurements, it is rather obvious that the merit of our new cross-conjugated design in terms of optical properties is responsible for the improved photovoltaic performances.

Interestingly, from Fig. 3, one can notice that despite a partial overlap of the absorption spectra of both dyes, h-BOD exhibits a higher absorption feature in the 450–570 nm wavelength range. It is therefore attractive to try to incorporate both dyes into the same device in a co-sensitized DSSC. As anticipated, the co-sensitized DSSC based on h-BOD + cc-BOD showed a high IPCE of more than 60% over the whole 330–720 nm region with an absorption onset up to 800 nm (Fig. 5a). In comparison to the single cc-BOD dye, the co-sensitized h-BOD + cc-BOD system shows substantially increased IPCE in the visible region without decreasing IPCE in the NIR region. The IPCE at 530 nm increased from 53% for the single cc-BOD DSSC to 69% for the h-BOD + cc-BOD based DSSC. Even though the adsorbed amount of cc-BOD in the cc-BOD alone cell decreases from 1.18 × 10−7 mol cm−2 to 7.83 × 10−8 mol cm−2 in the h-BOD + cc-BOD cell (Table 2), the IPCE spectrum of cc-BOD at 700 nm decreases only from 65% to 63% for co-sensitized h-BOD + cc-BOD, where mainly cc-BOD shows a photo-response. These results suggest that h-BOD does not affect the light harvesting efficiency of cc-BOD on TiO2 film in the co-sensitized h-BOD + cc-BOD system. Consequently, an even improved photovoltaic performance in regard to previous elaborated DSSCs, inducing an enhanced Jsc of 16.07 mA cm−2, was measured for the co-sensitized DSSC. The Voc and FF remain quite unmodified (see Table 2, Fig. 5b) and resulted in a PCE of 6.20%.
3.4. CEM and IMVS measurements
For determining the dynamics of charge recombination, the electron lifetime (τ) in the DSSCs is a key parameter to determine and which is related to the device Voc. As the Voc of a DSSC depends on the charge recombination reactions rather than molecular structures of the dyes, it is important to explore the role of the fabricated sensitizer based DSSCs in this aspect.36 The relative conduction band positions and electron lifetimes in the DSSCs fabricated with h-BOD, cc-BOD single dyes and h-BOD + cc-BOD co-sensitized dyes were examined to comprehend the difference of the measured Voc for the DSSCs. Initially, the relative conduction band position of TiO2 was measured by the charge extraction method (CEM). Fig. 6a shows that DSSCs sensitized with h-BOD, cc-BOD single dyes and h-BOD + cc-BOD co-sensitized dye display a similar linear increase in electron density as a function of Voc. This indicates that h-BOD, cc-BOD single dyes and h-BOD + cc-BOD co-sensitized dye cells have the same conduction band edge of TiO2 irrespective of the molecular structures and co-sensitization. We have further investigated the electron lifetime (τ, which reflects the degree of electron recombination) of the DSSCs sensitized with h-BOD, cc-BOD single dyes and h-BOD + cc-BOD dyes by means of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy to understand the differences between the Voc values of the respective DSSCs which is shown in Fig. 6b. It is clear that at a fixed Voc, the lifetime decreases as h-BOD + cc-BOD > cc-BOD > h-BOD, which is in accord with the order of decreasing Voc observed in the respective DSSCs. The longer lifetime observed for the h-BOD + cc-BOD based DSSC compared to cc-BOD and h-BOD based DSSCs suggests that the co-sensitized DSSC significantly suppressed the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 film with I3−.

4. Conclusion
By combining the horizontal and vertical designs by a “cross-conjugated design” in one single dye, we designed and synthesized a new BODIPY-based dye, called cross-conjugated BODIPY, cc-BOD. It exhibits a strong a UV-visible-NIR absorption. Compared to a more standard BODIPY dye, using similar functional groups and based on a horizontal design, called h-BOD, the new cc-BOD exhibits clearly the highest conjugation and the highest light harvesting properties. Applied as photosensitizers in DSSCs, the cc-BOD dye has led to significantly higher photovoltaic performances than the h-BOD, with maximum PCE measured at 6.02% instead of 3.7%. However, the simultaneous use of both dyes h-BOD + cc-BOD as a co-sensitizer in DSSCs led to a further PCE increase up to 6.2%, due to their complementary absorption properties. These results highlight the beneficial impact of our novel cross-conjugated BODIPY-based design in developing NIR dyes for the fabrication of high-efficiency DSSCs.
