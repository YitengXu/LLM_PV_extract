    , Accepted 8th June 2015First published on 10th June 2015AbstractSix fractions of indene-C60 bisadducts (IC60BAs) with two indene pendants located at different positions of the C60 cage were isolated by using the HPLC technique, in which one enantiomeric mixture was purified and the structure was confirmed by single crystal XRD analysis. It was revealed that the isolated IC60BA isomers possess an elevated LUMO energy level and afford increased electron mobility, but the solar cells assembled by the isolated IC60BA isomers with P3HT did not show high performance due to a serious phase separation between them. The results suggest that for high performance polymer solar cells we should consider not only the energy level matching between the donor and acceptor materials, but also the structural matching between them.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on phase-separated blends of fullerene acceptors and conjugated polymer donors show great potential in flexible, lightweight, and large-area devices through low-cost solution processing.1–4 In the last decade, immense progress has been made in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs owing to the design of new semiconducting materials (both donors5–8 and acceptors9–11) and device engineering.12–14 Fullerene derivatives have emerged as efficient electron acceptors because of their unique spherical structure, outstanding electron affinity, and appropriate miscibility with conjugated polymers.15
The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of a BHJ device is determined by the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor.16,17 In order to elevate the LUMO energy levels of the acceptor to get a high Voc, a series of fullerene bisadducts have recently been designed and successfully applied in PSCs, for instance, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester bisadduct (bis-PCBM),18 indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA),19 dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene bisadduct (NC60BA),20o-quinodimethanemethano[60]fullerene (OQMF) and thieno-o-quinodimethanemethano[60]fullerene (TOQMF),21etc. So far, the benchmark of PSC devices based on fullerene bisadduct derivatives has impressively reached 7.5% for indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) and 7.4% for indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA).22,23
However, nearly all the fullerene bisadduct acceptors reported so far are a mixture of several isomers, which would lead to an energetic disorder of the different fullerene isomers in the active layer of the PSCs,24 and decrease the charge carrier mobility.25 Obviously, the solar cell performance may be largely improved by using isolated fullerene isomers to eliminate the energetic disorder,26 for example, our recently reported PCEs based on four isolated isomers of NC60BA all showed much improved performance compared to those based on a NC60BA mixture.
Encouraged by the success of NC60BA, we isolated the isomers of IC60BA and tried improving the PCEs based on the IC60BA mixture (Scheme 1), and four isomers of IC60BA, i.e., trans-2, trans-3, trans-4 and e isomers, were isolated by using the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) technique. These isomers were blended with P3HT to assemble organic solar cells, and their performance was studied in detail.

IC60BA was synthesized and purified according to the literature reported before.19 The IC60BA mixture was further subjected to HPLC with a COSMOSIL 5PPB column and a buckyprep D column. Different from NC60BA, each IC60BA isomer may own several stereoisomers resulting from the different orientation of methene in the fullerene cage. According to the structural symmetry, e bisadduct contains two pairs of enantiomers, trans-2 contains three stereoisomers, trans-3 contains three stereoisomers, and trans-4 contains three stereoisomers.28 As shown in Fig. 1, six peaks in the HPLC profile were mainly observed corresponding to IC60BA, and the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the six fractions obtained from the HPLC are shown in Fig. S1.† Based on the fact that the UV-Vis absorption spectra of fullerene bisadduct are correlated with the addition patterns,29 the characteristic absorption spectra of the obtained isomers match well with several previously reported fullerene bisadduct isomers.27 Therefore, by comparing the UV-Visible absorption spectra with other known fullerene bisadduct analogues, fraction 1 (F1), fraction 2 (F2) and fraction 3 (F3) can be ambiguously assigned to different stereoisomers of the trans-2 isomer, fraction 4 (F4) was assigned to trans-3, fraction 5 (F5) was assigned to trans-4, and fraction 6 (F6) was assigned to the e bisadduct.
 Fig. 1  HPLC profile of the IC60BA isomers. 
Further isolation of each isomer by recycling HPLC was performed with a COSMOSIL 5PBB column to obtain different IC60BA stereoisomers. Two fractions of e were obtained, named e1 and e2 (Fig. S2†). Interestingly, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of e1 and e2 are exactly identical to e (Fig. 2), which indicates that the configuration of pendants has nearly the same electronic structure.
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorption spectra of e1 and e2 in toluene (10−4 mol L−1). 
The 1H NMR spectra of the e1 and e2 were measured as shown in Fig. S4 and S6,† showing the high purity of the isolated stereostructures. It is applauded that a single crystal of e1 was obtained by slowly diffusing hexane into the CS2 solution of e1, thus a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis would help us to determine the structure of this IC60BA stereoisomer. As shown in Fig. 3, there are two kinds of molecules (named L and R), which have mirror symmetry in the e1 crystal. This suggests that e1 is an enantiomeric mixture. Moreover, eight molecules build up a single cell with half R and half L chirality (Fig. S13†), in which the inter-fullerene distance is 2.72 and 4.40 Å along the a and c axis, respectively. The shortest fullerene center-to-center distance is 9.70 Å, which is even less than that in crystals of PC61BM (9.85 Å).30 As shown in Fig. 3c, the crystal packing diagram exhibits the arrangement of alternating rows of L and R. This is an intuitive representation of the self-assembling nature of e1, which contributes to good electron-transport properties.

It should be mentioned that though e1 and e2 are two different stereostructures of the IC60BA, e2 could not form a single crystal as e1 does under the same experimental conditions, so no crystalline structures were available for e2. Moreover, except for the e isomer, the stereoisomers of all other IC60BA isomers were too close in nature to be separated from each other by HPLC, so no further isolations for those IC60BA isomers were made in this work. For instance, isomer trans-3 contains a pair of enantiomers (named A & A′) and a stereoisomer (named B) in theory. The 1H NMR of trans-3 (Fig. S8†) confirms the coexistence of these enantiomers and stereoisomers with a ratio of ca. 5:2. However, it is difficult to further isolate them from each other by recycling HPLC (Fig. S3†) due to the fact that resembling structures lead to their nearly same retention time in HPLC.
The thermal properties of IC60BA isomers were investigated by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The TGA measurements of e1, e2 and trans-3 (Fig. S14–16†) indicate that the decomposition temperatures (Td) of them are around 270 °C, and the total weight losses of e1, e2 and trans-3 are 24.93%, 24.71% and 24.45%, respectively. The results are in line with the theoretical weight loss of 24.4% induced by the retro Diels-Alder process. Interestingly, no obvious endothermic peaks are observed in the DSC curves of these isomers (Fig. S17†), indicating that these samples do not experience melting processes before their decompositions.
The electrochemical property of IC60BA isomers was measured, and the cyclic voltammetry of the IC60BA isomers exhibits two quasi-reversible reduction waves in the negative potential range of 0 to −2 V versus Ag/Ag+ (Fig. S18†). The LUMO energy levels of the IC60BA isomers were estimated from their reduction onset potentials (Eredon). As shown in Table 1, the LUMO energy levels of trans-3, e1, e2 and the pristine IC60BA were estimated to be −3.67 eV, −3.69 eV, −3.69 eV and −3.71 eV, respectively. Therefore, the difference of the energetic levels between the isomers has resulted in the energetic disorder of their mixture.

The electron mobility of the IC60BA isomers was measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (see ESI for experimental details). It was found that the electron mobility for trans-3, e1 and e2 were 3.1 × 10−4, 7.7 × 10−5 and 8.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are all higher than that of the mixture (4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). It should be noted that trans-3 isomer shows much higher electron mobility than e1, e2 and mixture, which is mainly ascribed to the two far-away pendants in trans-3, allowing the π–π electron coupling of the C60 cage to form effective electron transport channels.26 The improving electron mobility of the isolated isomers was mainly due to their better self assembling nature that decreased packing disorder of these isolated isomers, leading to better photovoltaic performances.
To figure out the effect of isomer isolation on the device performance, PSCs based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT: acceptor/Ca/Al configuration were fabricated and characterized under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The J–V curves of the devices based on the P3HT:IC60BA isomers are shown in Fig. 4a, and the device performances are summarized in Table 2. It can be found that the devices based on P3HT:IC60BA isolated isomers afford excellent Voc (0.9 V), which are higher than that of the pristine IC60BA (0.85 V). This is in accordance with the elevated LUMO energy levels of the isolated IC60BA isomers. Therefore, the isolated IC60BA isomers match better with the P3HT donor in their relative energy levels, and a higher PCE for these devices is expected.

However, compared with the high PCE value (6.04%) of the solar cell device with that of the pristine IC60BA mixture as an acceptor, it is regretted that the performances of the devices based on the isolated IC60BA isomers are all decreased due to their much lower Jsc and FF parameters than that with the pristine IC60BA mixture acceptor.
To explore the reason why the isolated IC60BA isomers own an up-shifted LUMO level and higher electron mobility than the pristine IC60BA mixture, but the PSCs based on them alternatively have an inferior PCE compared with the latter, the morphology of the P3HT:IC60BA isomer blend films was examined by using a polarized optical microscope (POM). As shown in Fig. 5, the blend film of the P3HT:mixture is very smooth where no large phase separation domains were observed, while in the blend film of P3HT:trans-3, P3HT:e1 and P3HT:e2, obvious fullerene aggregations were always clearly shown. Moreover, the aggregations in P3HT:trans-3 blend is slightly less compared with that in P3HT:e1 and P3HT:e2, possibly due to the existence of more stereoisomers inside trans-3 than that inside e1 and e2. As a result, the high purity of IC60BA isomers leads to their strong self-aggregation and excessive phase separation in the blend films, which decreases the D/A interface, then hinders exciton separation and results in inferior device performance.

Different from the isolated NC60BA isomers that are always blended well with P3HT and the PSCs based on them that afford improved performance,26 the isolated IC60BA isomers are obviously mismatched with P3HT, leading to serious phase separation between the donor and acceptor, so finally the PSCs based on the isolated IC60BA isomers all show worse performance compared with those based on the pristine IC60BA mixture. This may be ascribed to the different pendants of NC60BA and IC60BA, which show different molecular interactions while blending them with the P3HT. Therefore, to optimize the performance of polymer solar cells, not only the energy level matching between donor and acceptor is important, but also the structural matching between them should be considered. In general, the energy level matching between the donor and acceptor determines the Voc, and the structural matching between them would strongly affect the Jsc and FF parameters.
Conclusion
In this work, we isolated an IC60BA mixture by HPLC and a single crystal was obtained to confirm the structure of e1. These isolated isomers possess elevated LUMO energy levels and higher electron mobility compared with the pristine IC60BA mixture, due to their reductive energetic disorder and improved self-assembling ability. Unfortunately, the PSC devices based on the isolated IC60BA isomers always afford inferior performance with lower Jsc and FF compared with their mixture. Apparent large-sized fullerene aggregations were observed in the P3HT:isomer blend films. Over self-aggregation of the isolated isomers results in excessive phase separation which leads to poor morphology, reduces the D/A interface, hinders exciton dissociation and charge carrier transportation, and finally leads to inferior PCE. We can safely draw a conclusion that not only the energy balance between donor and accepter counts for much, but the structure matching between them plays an important role in high performance of the polymer solar cells.
