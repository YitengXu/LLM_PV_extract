    , Accepted 28th September 2012First published on 3rd October 2012AbstractA sheet-on-sheet reduced graphene oxide–β-In2S3 (RGO–In2S3) composite, was successfully synthesized via a one-step mild method. This fresh composite used as an anode material exhibits enhanced cyclability and specific capacity for lithium storage. These results are linked with the intrinsic layered structure of β-In2S3 sheets and the effective combination of β-In2S3 and RGO sheets. This results in a high specific surface area and good conductivity of RGO–In2S3 composites, with higher transport rates of electrolyte ions and electrons, and a more effective electrochemical reaction of the active material. This facile and rapid synthesis method is a promising route for a large-scale production of graphene-based metal sulfides, which could be used as electrode materials for Li-ion batteries.
Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs), as a promising power source of electronics and electric vehicles, have been one of the focal points of research. For most nanoelectrode materials, owing to their inherent low electrical conductivity and easy agglomeration and the severe volume changes during the lithium uptake and removal, the reversible specific capacity fades fast upon cycling.1–3 In order to circumvent these drawbacks, designing special nanostructures4–9 and hybrids10–14 with a conductivity agent, such as carbonaceous substances, are current popular methods. Recently, graphene sheets, due to their extraordinary electronic transport properties,15,16 large surface area and mechanical flexibility, have been considered as a matrix material to improve electrochemical performance.17–20 Especially, graphene sheets hybridised with sheet-like nanomaterials (sheet-on-sheet nanostructure)21–25 are beneficial for enlarging the contact area of the electrode–electrolyte interface and shortening the diffusion length for ion transport, consequently enabling a fast conversion reaction and leading to excellent electrochemical performance when they are used as anode electrode materials. Very recently, Cheng's group24 disclosed the enhancement of electrochemical performance for a sheet-like NiO–graphene composite electrode, resulting from an oxygen bridge between graphene and NiO. This “synergistic effect” could improve the electrochemical performance of a material.
Indium sulfide (In2S3), a typical III–VI group sulfide, has attracted substantial attention as a potential semiconductor nanomaterial for solar cells,26,27 lithium ion batteries,28,29 and in environmental pollution.30–32 Very recently, Li and Liu’s group33 investigated the electrochemical performance of carbon coated β-In2S3 microspheres, and found that cyclability and specific capacity of the β-In2S3@C composite electrode were substantially improved when compared with pure β-In2S3 microspheres. However, the reversible specific capacity only retained about 360 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which probably resulted from the poor Li ion transport. Son's group34 fabricated a graphene-based In2S3 composite via a multi-step synthetic method and investigated its electrochemical performance. They found that the discharge capacities of the graphene–In2S3 composites via heat treatment were about 716–837 mA h g−1 at a discharge current density of 50 mA g−1 after 30 cycles. In this work, we developed a more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient method to fabricate a novel reduced graphene oxide–In2S3 (RGO–In2S3) composite. This as-prepared RGO–In2S3 composite, which is used as an anode material for lithium storage, exhibits enhanced cyclability and high specific capacity when compared to pure β-In2S3 nanosheets and reported results.
In a typical procedure, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, indium(III) chloride tetrahydrate, and thioacetamide were in turn added to distilled water and stirred for a set time. The obtained solution was transferred to a round flask and refluxed at 95 °C for 80 min. After cooling, the as-prepared product was harvested after undergoing centrifugation four times, and dried at 60 °C overnight (see ESI† for the detailed Material synthesis). The SEM images of the as-prepared RGO–In2S3 composite (Fig. 1a) and pure β-In2S3 (Fig. S1†) show that β-In2S3 has a sheet-like morphology, and the curled β-In2S3 sheets are vertical to or lie on the RGO matrix. The planar size of the In2S3 sheets is about 80 nm. The β-In2S3 sheets are able to hybridise effectively with the RGO. The uniformity of the composite is also proven by the result of element mapping (Fig. 1b). The crystallinity and phase purity of the β-In2S3 sheets, and its composite with RGO are revealed by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2,† all the identified diffraction peaks and their relative intensities are in accordance with a cubic In2S3 phase (β-In2S3) (JCPDS card no.: 65-0459, space group: Fdm, a0 = b0 = c0 = 10.774 Å). No other impurity phase was detected. The analysis of EDX in Fig. S3† also reveals a molar ratio of S to In of about 3:2. Furthermore, the β-In2S3 sheets have an average thickness of about 8.2 nm, which was estimated by the Scherrer equation using the (111) peak in the XRD pattern. The presence of RGO and its reduced state were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1d). Two characteristic peaks of the D and G bands from GO and RGO–In2S3 were observed at about 1340 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1, respectively. The intensity ratio of D to G bands (ID:IG) were 0.85 and 1.05 for the GO sheet and the RGO–In2S3 composite, respectively. The higher ratio for RGO–In2S3 in comparison to GO indicates that GO was, to some extent, reduced. This result was also supported by reported works,35,36 in which thioacetamide (TAA) was used as a reducing agent to reduce GO.

The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared RGO–In2S3 composite were further investigated by TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2). The morphology of the RGO–In2S3 composite consists of small β-In2S3 sheets and bent graphene sheets. Fig. 2a shows the sheet-on-sheet morphology of the RGO–In2S3 composite. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (inset in Fig. 2a) can be indexed (111), (311), (400), and (440) (JCPDS card no.: 65-0459), which further confirmed the high crystallinity of sample. Three lattice fringes with the lattice spacing of 0.62 nm (Fig. 2b), 0.38 nm and 0.328 nm (Fig. 2c), corresponding to the {111}, {220}, and {311} planes of cubic β-In2S3 respectively, were detected. Fig. 2b also reveals that the thickness of the β-In2S3 sheet is about 8.3 nm, which is consistent with the average thickness estimated from the XRD pattern, and that the β-In2S3 sheets are composed of 12–14 layers, which are stacked along the thickness direction. Fig. 2d reveals the existence of RGO having about 3–6 layers. The RGO content in the as-prepared RGO–In2S3 composite was estimated to be about 7.1 wt% by TGA measurements (Fig. S4†).

The as-prepared product was further characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K and its corresponding pore size distribution (Fig. S5†). According to the isotherm types,37 the pure β-In2S3 is characteristic of a type IV with a type H3 hysteresis, revealing that this material consists of a loose assemblage of sheet-like particles forming slit-like pores. Meanwhile, the isotherm of RGO–In2S3 has type H4 loops, which probably arise from adsorption–desorption in the narrow slit-like pores. Compared to the specific surface area and pore size for pure β-In2S3 (48.4 m2 g−1 and 120 nm, respectively), the larger specific surface area and pore size of the RGO–In2S3 composite (79.6 m2 g−1 and 173 nm, respectively) can increase the contact area of the active material and the electrolyte, leading to a fast transfer of Li ions and electrons. The elemental composition and chemical state of the as-prepared samples were studied by XPS measurements (Fig. 3). A typical survey of the XPS spectrum for the RGO–In2S3 composite revealed the presence of carbon, indium, sulfur and oxygen (Fig. 3a). The In 3d peak and S 2p peak were further examined by high-resolution XPS (Fig. 3b and d), where the In 3d and S 2p spectra were calibrated using C 1s (284.8 eV) as the reference. The peaks at the binding energy values of 444.5 eV and 452.1 eV are related to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively, while the peaks at 161.3 eV could be attributed to the S 2p3/2 transition. The observed binding energy values of In 3d and S 2p3/2 agree well with the reported data for β-In2S3.38 The C 1s high-resolution spectrum for the RGO–In2S3 composite and a Gaussian fit to the C 1s are shown in Fig. 3c. Four peaks,39 located at 284.8, 286.1, 287.8 and 289.0 eV, corresponding to nonoxygenated carbon atoms (C–C), carbon atoms in hydroxyl groups (C–O), carbonyl carbon (CO) and carboxylate carbon (O–CO), respectively, can be deconvoluted. The strong C 1s peak (284.8 eV) is related to the graphitic carbon in graphene, while the weaker ones from the oxygenated carbons indicate the deoxygenation process accompanying the reduction of graphene oxide. Based on the above analysis of the RGO–In2S3 composite, the formation process of the RGO–In2S3 composite is illustrated in Scheme 1. The formation of the RGO–In2S3 composite can be mainly divided into two steps. The sheet-like GO incorporates with In3+ ions because of electrostatic forces, and the S2− ions provided by the TAA reagent act as a reducing agent and as a sulfur source, which contributes to the formation of the RGO–In2S3 composite.

To demonstrate the potential of the RGO–In2S3 composite to be used as electrode material in a lithium ion battery (LIB), coin-type cells were fabricated (see the ESI† for detailed Electrochemical measurement) to perform a preliminary investigation on the electrochemical performance of this material, and they were compared to the pure β-In2S3 under the same conditions. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) performance (Fig. S6†) of the RGO–In2S3 electrode conforms to the pure β-In2S3 electrode, indicating a similar electrochemical reaction process. As indicated in the CV curves, after the first reduction scan of the RGO–In2S3 electrode and the pure In2S3 electrode, four reduction peaks at 1.45, 1.10, 0.68 and 0.28 V were observed. However, the peak at 1.45 V disappeared in the 2nd to 5th cycles, which implies the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) in this reduction peak, whereas the other three peaks still appear, showing the multi-step process of reduction of the In3+ ions. Accordingly, three apparent oxidation peaks that appear at 0.43, 0.70 and 1.68 V also confirm multi-step oxidation. An apparent difference from the pure β-In2S3 electrode, is that the third potential sweeping curve for RGO–In2S3 electrode almost coincides with the fifth sweeping, implying a better electrochemical stability for RGO–In2S3 electrode than for pure β-In2S3. Furthermore, the larger area of the CV curves of the RGO–In2S3 electrode also exhibits larger lithium storage ability when compared to the pure β-In2S3 electrode. Galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the RGO–In2S3 composite and the pure β-In2S3 revealed their electrochemical reactions (Fig. 4a). The processes of oxidation and reduction are consistent with the results of the CV sweep scan. Fig. 4b shows the cycle performance of the RGO–In2S3 composite and the pure β-In2S3 at a charge–discharge current density of 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range between 3.0 V and 5 mV. The irreversible capacities of the RGO–In2S3 composite and the pure β-In2S3 are 1327 mA h g−1 and 1427 mA h g−1, respectively. In comparison to their irreversible discharge capacities, the first reversible discharge capacity of RGO–In2S3 is 1072 mA h g−1, which is much higher than that of pure β-In2S3 (775 mA h g−1). The 65.3% initial Coulombic efficiency of the RGO–In2S3 composite is also larger than the 53.4% of the pure β-In2S3 (Fig. S7†), indicating that the RGO layers in the composite play an essential role in the enhancement. Another striking result is that the discharge capacity of the RGO–In2S3 composite electrode ranges from 1072 mA h g−1 (the 2nd cycle) to 1015 mA h g−1 (the 100th cycle) and the fluctuation of specific capacity upon cycling is relatively small. In contrast, the discharge capacity of the pure β-In2S3 electrode fades quickly from 775 mA h g−1 at the 2nd cycle to 415 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle. The high capacity and good cyclability of the RGO–In2S3 electrode probably results from the improved structural stability24 and conductivity of the RGO–In2S3 composite because of the RGO sheets, which lead to effective utilization of the active material. The enhanced cycle performance of the RGO–In2S3 composite is also supported by the investigation of the charge–discharge of the RGO–In2S3 electrode at a current density of 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 4c). The reversible capacity arrived at 598 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles and 604 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. However, the reversible capacity of the pure β-In2S3 electrode fades from 325 mA g−1 at the 40th cycle to 252 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles in the same test conditions. These results revealed that the RGO–In2S3 electrode indeed shows enhanced cyclability during charged–discharged processes with higher current density.

All the specific capacities of RGO–In2S3 are reported based on the total weight of the RGO–In2S3 composite. 
To uncover the origin of the excellent cycle stability of the RGO–In2S3 composite electrode, we carried out further AC impedence spectra measurements in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. As demonstrated in Fig. 4d, the Nyquist plots exhibit that the diameter of the semicircle for the RGO–In2S3 composite in the high-medium frequency region is much smaller than that of the pure β-In2S3. This means that the RGO–In2S3 composite possesses lower contact and charge-transfer resistance. The exact kinetic differences between the RGO–In2S3 composite and the pure β-In2S3 were examined by modeling the AC impedance spectra according to the modified Randles equivalent circuit (Fig. S8†and summarized in Table S1.†). From the fitting, the values of the ohmic resistance (RΩ) are obtained to be 8.8 ohm and 9.6 ohm for the pure β-In2S3 and the RGO–In2S3 composite, respectively, and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for the RGO–In2S3 composite is 68 ohm, much lower than that of the pure β-In2S3 (122 ohm). This highly effective combination not only enhances the high conductivity of the overall electrode, but also largely improves the electrochemical activity of In2S3 during the cyclic process.
In conclusion, we have developed an efficient fabrication method for sheet-on-sheet RGO–In2S3 composites. The novel nanostructured RGO–In2S3 composite is characterized by the homogenous dispersion of the β-In2S3 sheets on the RGO sheets. The intrinsic layered structure of the β-In2S3 and high specific surface area of the RGO–In2S3 composite, when it is used as an anode electrode material for lithium storage, will tremendously enhance its specific capacity and cyclability as compared to pure β-In2S3. The improvement of the electrochemical performance of β-In2S3 nanomaterials by hybridisation with graphene via a simple method will augment the possibilities for their practical application. Moreover, this facile and rapid synthesis approach is a promising route for large-scale production of graphene-based metal sulfide composites as electrode materials for Li-ion storage.
