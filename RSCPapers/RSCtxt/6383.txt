    , Accepted 26th March 2021First published on 31st March 2021AbstractA bimodal-pore strategy was developed for preparation of the Pt3Co/C catalyst with active Pt3Co nanoparticles located around the mass transfer channels rather than inside them, which leads to ca. 29% higher mass transfer efficiency and a superior single-cell performance under an ultralow Pt loading.
The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is considered to be crucial energy conversion technology in hydrogen-based clean energy systems owing to its high efficiency, high energy density and environmental sustainability.1,2 And a major challenge for commercialization of PEMFCs is to obtain efficient low-Pt electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).3,4 In particular, Pt-based alloy nanomaterials, due to reduced Pt use and their excellent activity performance in the ORR, have been widely recognized as a type of promising ORR catalyst.5,6
From a viewpoint of microstructural design, the formation of copious accessible reactive sites and rapid mass transfer channels in catalyst materials are quite important for improving the apparent catalytic performance.7,8 Thus, ORR catalysts have mostly been constructed in porous structures, with Pt alloy nanoparticles deposited on the pore walls.9–15 The typical preparation of such materials involves two steps: first, obtaining the porous structure, and then loading the Pt alloy nanoparticles inside the pores,11–15 which however leads to several obvious microstructural drawbacks: (1) the metallic nanoparticles generated from this process are normally polydisperse with an uneven distribution, which decreases the utilization efficiency of the active sites; (2) the nanoparticles occupy certain pore channels, thus diminishing the cross-section areas of the channels and reducing mass transfer efficiency; and (3) such a post-loading route frequently leads to weak adhesion of the nanoparticles on the supports, which heavily degrades the stability of the catalyst in the long-term running of the fuel cell.
In this work, we constructed a bimodal-pore structure for separate deposition of alloy nanoparticles and mass transfer. As demonstrated in Scheme 1, the assembly of resorcinol, formaldehyde and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) leads to an emulsion solution. After introducing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) into the system, another assembly layer is coated on the emulsion surface which contains polymerized resol, a continuous SiO2 phase, as well as CTAB induced micelles. Herein CTAB and SiO2, acting as soft and hard templates respectively, direct the formation of the bimodal pores. Principally, we firstly release the CTAB induced mesopores for Pt3Co deposition and then etch SiO2 to form continuous channels for mass transfer. Hence, the acquired Pt3Co/C-O catalysts (where O means open channel) possess open and connective porous channels. In addition, the highly uniform Pt3Co nanoparticles are distributed evenly around the pores and do not occupy any mass transfer space. Simultaneously, the Pt3Co nanoparticles are partly locked in the mesopores, which not only suppresses particle agglomeration and maintains the distribution of small particle size during the cycled electrochemical reaction, but also prevents detachment of the particles from the support, thus significantly boosting the electrocatalytic stability. This work supplies a novel design strategy for the porous structured electrocatalysts which may lead to a range of functional materials for various applications.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation of Pt3Co/C-O and Pt3Co/C-B catalysts. 
To demonstrate the advantages of Pt3Co/C-O in porous-structure design, a control sample Pt3Co/C-B (where B means blocked pores) was also prepared by the conventional post-loading method, i.e. first removing all templates and then loading alloy nanoparticles inside the pores. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), after removing CTAB, the intermediate product SiO2/C displays a uniform spherical morphology with an average diameter of 215 nm. And the final carbon-based products of Pt3Co/C-O and Pt3Co/C-B (Fig. 1a and e) have a similar microsphere morphology and particle size, which shows that carbon forms the continuous main phase, thus supporting the microspherical structure during SiO2 removal. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1b and f) show that the spheres are indeed hollow due to the existence of the emulsion template, and the shell thickness is ca. 40 nm for both samples. In particular for Pt3Co/C-O, the Pt3Co nanoparticles display a uniform distribution, and the statistical analysis of more than 100 particles suggests an average Pt3Co particle size of 2.39 nm (Fig. 1b–d). This value matches well with the reported sizes of the CTAB micelles (ca. 3 nm),16,17 implying that the nanoparticles are mainly located inside the CTAB-resulting mesopores. By contrast, the Pt3Co nanoparticles reach an average particle size of 9.43 nm in Pt3Co/C-B with a rather wide size distribution (Fig. 1f–h), as the larger pores made by both SiO2 and CTAB could not provide effective confinement of the particle sizes. HRTEM images of Pt3Co/C-O and Pt3Co/C-B (Fig. 1i and j) display a distinct lattice fringe with a distance of 0.217 nm, matching well with the (111) planes of Pt3Co. The STEM image (Fig. 1k) and the corresponding elemental mappings (Fig. 1l–n) further reveal the homogeneous distribution of elements C, Pt and Co in the carbon spheres.

STEM image (k) and elemental mapping images (l–n) of Pt3Co/C-O. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the composition of the materials. In Fig. 2a, the two characteristic peaks of Pt3Co/C-O located at 2θ of 40.5° and 47.1° correspond well with the (111) and (200) reflections of the Pt faced-centered cubic (fcc) phases. However, Pt3Co/C-B, due to its larger alloy nanoparticles, demonstrates four distinctive diffraction peaks with a higher intensity from Pt3Co.
 Fig. 2  Physical characterization of the materials: (a) XRD patterns, (b) Pt 4f high-resolution XPS spectra, (c) N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and (d) pore size distribution plots. 
The electronic properties of the Pt and Co species were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2b, for both alloy catalysts, the Pt 4f peak can be deconvoluted into two pairs of doublets, associated with metallic Pt0 and oxidized Pt2+ respectively,18 and metallic Pt0 accounts for a distinctly larger proportion. Similarly, both Co0 and Co2+ exist in the product, and metallic Co0 is the major species (Fig. S2b, ESI†). In addition, compared with Pt/C, the Pt binding energy of Pt3Co demonstrates a slight positive shift (0.29 eV). Also, the Co binding energy of Pt3Co is 1.8 eV more positive than that of phase pure Co.19 This implies the well-tuned electronic structure on the Pt3Co surface.
The porous characteristics of the materials were studied by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method. All three samples, SiO2/C, Pt3Co/C-O and Pt3Co/C-B, show type-IV isotherms (Fig. 2c), and the slow increase in the middle P/P0 region (0.5–0.9) clearly reveals the existence of abundant mesopores. For the two alloy samples, the rapid absorption increase at P/P0 > 0.97 should be ascribed to the interior cavity of the hollow spheres, as well as the stacked pores. The pore size distribution plots indicate that the mesopore size is centered at 2.3 nm for SiO2/C, a typical size templated by CTAB micelles. Whereas Pt3Co/C-O has larger mesopores (2–9 nm) resulting from the SiO2 hard template. In comparison, the mesopores in Pt3Co/C-B are 2–7 nm due to partial blocking by the alloy particles. The detailed pore parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Pt3Co/C-O and Pt3Co/C-B have similar pore volumes (ca. 1.8 cm3 g−1) to that of commercial Pt/C (ca. 1.7 cm3 g−1), but the BET specific surface areas of Pt3Co/C-O and Pt3Co/C-B reach as high as ca. 800.0 m2 g−1, and are 6.5 times that of commercial Pt/C (122.4 m2 g−1).
The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared catalysts was evaluated in the ORR. The cyclic voltammetry (CVs) curves recorded in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution (Fig. 3a) show that the onset potential of Pt oxidation in Pt3Co/C-O is 39 mV more positive than that of commercial Pt/C, suggesting the weaker binding of oxygenated species on the former.20 The ORR polarization curves collected in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution (Fig. 3b) demonstrate that Pt3Co/C-O gives an onset potential of 1.067 V and a half-wave potential of 0.930 V, which is significantly higher than for commercial Pt/C (Eonset = 1.028 V, E1/2 = 0.884 V). And Pt3Co/C-B exhibits the poorest activity of the three samples. To further compare their performances, the kinetic currents were normalized to the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and the loading mass of metal Pt, respectively. The ECSA values calculated from CO stripping curves (Fig. S3, ESI†) are 106.0, 50.5 and 72.5 m2 gPt−1 for Pt3Co/C-O, Pt3Co/C-B and commercial Pt/C respectively, indicating the distinctly higher atomic Pt utilization efficiency of Pt3Co/C-O. In particular, as shown in Fig. 3c, at 0.9 V the specific activity of Pt3Co/C-O reaches 0.984 mA cm−2, which is 5.0 and 3.8 times higher than that of Pt3Co/C-B and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Also, the mass activity of Pt3Co/C-O is 1.04 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V, which corresponds to a 5.4 and a 10.4 times enhancement compared with Pt/C (0.19 A mgPt−1) and Pt3Co/C-B (0.10 A mgPt−1) respectively. Indeed, the superior performances of Pt3Co/C-O are comparable to those of the state-of-art Pt alloy catalysts as shown in Table S2 (ESI†).

(a) CV curves recorded in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1; (b) ORR polarization curves recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solutions at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm; (c) specific activity and mass activity estimated at 0.9 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE); (d) ORR polarization curves of the Pt3Co/C-O catalyst before and after 10000 potential cycles between 0.6 and 1.1 V versus RHE, and the corresponding curves for Pt/C (inset). 
The electrochemical durability was evaluated by an accelerated durability test (ADT) conducted between 0.6 V and 1.1 V for 10000 continuous CV cycles in a three-electrode system (Fig. 3d and Fig. S4, ESI†). After ADT, Pt3Co/C-O exhibits just a 17 mV negative shift of half-wave potential whereas the commercial Pt/C loses 30 mV, confirming that the Pt3Co alloy catalyst is more electrochemically stable within the applied potential window. The TEM image (Fig. S5a, ESI†) shows that after ADT the alloy nanoparticles still show a monodisperse distribution without any obvious agglomeration and the particle size grows slightly from 2.39 to 3.0 nm. Considering the heavy particle growth along ADT reported for Pt/C,20,21 the unchanged alloy nanoparticles properly protected by the CTAB templated mesopores could be the main reason for the nice stability. Besides, after ADT, the lattice distance of the (111) plane changes to 0.226 nm (Fig. S5b, ESI†), which is slightly larger than the original value (0.217 nm). This indicates a certain amount of dissolution of the surface Co, and the formation of a surface Pt-richer phase.22–25
The mass transfer efficiency of ORR catalysts significantly affects the performance of fuel cells, especially when the cell is operated at a high current density. Herein, with our self-designed working electrode, we compared the mass transfer capability of the two alloy catalysts.26,27 As shown in Fig. 4a, at a constant current density of 10 and 15 mA cm−2, Pt3Co/C-O delivers rather stable output without any obvious degradation over 4000 s of continuous running, and the potential recorded at 10 mA cm−2 is 1.55 times that obtained at 15 mA cm−2. By contrast, the output potential of Pt3Co/C-B gradually decreases at 10 mA cm−2, representing an enhancing flooding of the catalyst layer. And when the current density is increased to 15 mA cm−2, Pt3Co/C-B cannot even give a stable signal. By comparing the average potentials supplied at 10 mA cm−2, Pt3Co/C-O has a ca. 29% higher mass transfer efficiency than that of Pt3Co/C-B, which can be ascribed to the absolutely unoccupied mass transfer channels made using the bimodal pore strategy.
 Fig. 4  (a) Chronopotentiometry curves recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solutions at 10/15 mA cm−2. The catalyst was loaded on the “rattle-drum” working electrode at a loading of 0.075 mgPt cm−2.26 Polarization curves and power density of H2–O2 (b) and H2–air (c) fuel cell employing Pt3Co/C-O, Pt3Co/C-B and Pt/C respectively. 
The prepared materials were further evaluated in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) experiments as cathode catalysts. Under a cathodic Pt loading of 0.06 mg cm−2 and H2–O2 conditions, Pt3Co/C-O reaches a peak power density of 1.33 W cm−2 and achieves a current density of 1.78 A cm−2 at 0.6 V, which are significantly higher than those acquired by Pt3Co/C-B (0.88 W cm−2 and 1.37 A cm−2) and Pt/C (0.83 W cm−2 and 0.7 A cm−2). And when the Pt loading in the cathode is increased to 0.1 mgPt cm−2, the peak power density of Pt3Co/C-O reaches 1.73 W cm−2 (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating an improved cell performance with the increased Pt loading. In addition, under H2–air supplies, Pt3Co/C-O also demonstrates a remarkable peak power density of 0.47 W cm−2. As exhibited in Table S3 (ESI†) the power density normalized to the total Pt loading of H2–O2 MEA is 9.5 W mgPt−1 for Pt3Co/C-O, which is 1.5 times that acquired from Pt3Co/C-B (6.3 W mgPt−1) and is 1.58–7.0 times the values reported recently on the performance of top fuel cells.
The excellent activity and durability of Pt3Co/C-O in the three-electrode system and as a single cell can be ascribed to the features provided by the bimodal-pore structures: (1) the monodisperse 2.39 nm alloy nanoparticles and their even distribution around the mass transfer channels allow the high-degree exposure of the active sites and their easy access by the reactants; (2) together, the absolutely unoccupied large-mesopore channels in the shell of the hollow spheres, the ultrathin thickness (40 nm) of the shell, and the large interior cavity (diameter = 110 nm) facilitate very efficient mass transfer; and (3) the small mesopores templated by CTAB effectively prevent the agglomeration and growth of the Pt3Co nanoparticles, thus significantly enhancing the durability of the catalysts.
In summary, by synergistically assembling soft and hard templates into an interesting bimodal porous structure, we successfully located the active Pt3Co nanoparticles around the mass transfer channels rather than inside the channels. CTAB-templated mesopores allow the formation of uniform 2.39 nm Pt3Co nanoparticles, and the SiO2-templated, completely exposed, mesoporous channels being about a ca. 29% enhancement of the mass transfer efficiency. With these structural features, the obtained Pt3Co/C-O catalysts demonstrate mass and specific activities as high as 1.04 A mg−1 and 0.984 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V, which are 5.4 and 3.8 times those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. In addition, the peak power density of the H2–O2 fuel cell reaches 1.33 W cm−2 under an ultralow cathodic loading of 0.06 mgPt cm−2, representing a very promising low-Pt catalyst. The reported bimodal pore strategy can be used effectively for the design and preparation of various porous materials for wider applications.
