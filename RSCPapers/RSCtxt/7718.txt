    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractRu nanomaterials have recently emerged as potential substitutes for classical Pt-based cathodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this regard, nanoparticle surface-functionalization through the so-called organometallic approach is a promising strategy towards synthesizing tailored highly active and durable HER (photo)electrocatalysts with limitless tunability. Herein, efficient (turnover numbers over 480 molH2 molRu−1 and a turnover frequency of 21.5 molH2 h−1 molRu−1; apparent quantum yield of 1.3%) and durable (>100 h) visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution has been achieved at neutral pH with a ternary hybrid nanomaterial combining 4-phenylpyridine-capped Ru nanoparticles (RuPP), TiO2 nanocrystals and [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-(PO3H2)2(bpy))]Cl2 (RuP) using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron-donor. Photophysical analysis by means of transient absorption spectroscopy has been performed in order to shed light on the kinetics of the electron transfer events and to identify the rate-determining step of the overall photocatalytic process. TiO2 is shown to have a key role as (1) the support aiding the dispersion of the photocatalyst and limiting its agglomeration under turnover conditions and (2) the electron-transfer mediator enabling efficient electron communication between the catalyst and the anchored molecular photoabsorber. Finally, the evolution and fate of the photocatalyst in long-term HER photocatalysis are thoroughly analyzed.
Introduction
The effects of global warming, triggered by the massive combustion of fossil resources, threaten our societal lifestyle and urge the development of sustainable energy conversion schemes. Inspired by the light-driven production of biomolecules in photosynthetic processes, storing sunlight energy in the chemical bonds of a fuel is a promising strategy known as artificial photosynthesis.1 In this regard, the sustainable production of molecular hydrogen through sunlight-driven water splitting (hν-WS) is a key process as the obtained H2 can be directly used as a fuel or employed as a reagent for other relevant routes such as the production of green methanol through CO2-based processes.2
In a division-of-labor approach for hν-WS, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells represent a compromise between technological maturity and cost, relying on the development of individual photoanodes and photocathodes.3,4 In hν-WS PEC cells, solar energy is collected by light-harvesting components that enable light-induced charge separation after excitation, water serves as an electron and proton donor at the photoanode and protons are converted into dihydrogen at the photocathode. Thus, the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a central matter in hν-WS. In this endeavor, appropriate HER photocatalysts and photoabsorber (PA) molecules/materials must be developed and properly combined in order to minimize undesired charge recombination processes.
Even if it is relatively low-demanding from a thermodynamic point of view (E0(H2O/H2) = −0.41 V vs. NHE at pH 7), the two-electron reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen is kinetically sluggish and requires the use of appropriate catalysts. Pt, with low working overpotentials and extremely high intrinsic activities (due to the ideal Pt–H adsorption energy), is generally the metal of choice.5 Nevertheless, heterogeneous Pt-based systems suffer from (a) severe corrosion under alkaline conditions and (b) the scarcity and prohibitive price of the metal that make it unsuitable for practical large-scale applications. In view of the limited HER performance of most earth-abundant systems,6 Ru nanomaterials have recently emerged as potential substitutes for Pt-based cathodes.7–9 Ru-based systems are an alternative to Pt ones to reduce the cost of the catalyst (since the price of Ru is ¼ that of Pt) but mainly to overcome the stability issues of the latter under alkaline conditions. In this regard, we have recently highlighted the potential of the organometallic approach10 in the tailored development of ligand-capped Ru nanoparticles (NPs) that display narrow size-distribution and controllable surface properties, as well as high electrocatalytic performance and long-term durability for the HER.11,12
Despite their relevant electrocatalytic performance, the number of efficient HER photocatalytic systems based on Ru nanocatalysts is still very limited.9 Together with their frequent agglomeration under turnover conditions,13 the attainment of a charge-separated state in PA (i.e. [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivatives, see Chart 1)/Ru NP systems is typically hampered by non-desired back-electron transfer processes from the PA excited state.14 Thus, together with a sacrificial electron donor, the use of an electron relay (i.e. methyl viologen) is often required. Relevant exceptions were reported by Fukuzumi and co-workers using organic donor–acceptor linked dyads (i.e. the 2-phenyl-4-(1-naphthyl)-quinolinium ion, QuPh+-NA, see Chart 1) which afford long-lived charge-separated states and efficient HER photocatalytic systems in combination with transition-metal based NPs such as Ru NPs.14–16 However, even if the photocatalytic performance of the QuPh+-NA/Ru NP system compares well with that of Pt-based systems under similar conditions, the organic dyad absorbs light mainly in the UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum and, due to its very low solubility in water, requires addition of organic solvents (i.e. MeCN) to the reaction media.

Herein we report our approach to attain efficient and durable visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution at neutral pH. This approach is based on the use of a ternary hybrid nanomaterial that combines TiO2-supported 4-phenylpyridine-capped Ru NPs as the photocatalyst with an anchorable ruthenium trisbipyridine-based PA (RuP, Chart 1) and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the SED. A detailed understanding of the electron transfer kinetics within the photochemical system examined is provided by time-resolved optical spectroscopy measurements, which evidence the key role of TiO2 as the electron relay and highlight the electron transfer from the semiconductor to the Ru NPs as the rate-determining step prior to hydrogen evolution.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Hybrid photocatalysts were prepared in a three-step process (Scheme 1): (1) the organometallic approach for the synthesis of nanostructures, then (2) their deposition onto the TiO2 surface by impregnation from a colloidal solution and finally (3) their controlled surface-oxidation. First, following our recent report,12 4-phenylpyridine (PP) stabilized ruthenium NPs (RuPP) were synthesized by decomposing the [Ru(cod)(cot)] (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene; cot = 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene) complex in THF under a H2 atmosphere (3 bar) at room temperature (r.t.), using PP as the stabilizing ligand ([PP]/[Ru] = 0.2 molar equivalent). TEM analysis of the crude solution showed well-dispersed RuPP NPs with a 1.4 ± 0.3 nm average diameter (by considering the smallest dimensions) with a narrow size distribution (Fig. 1a). Next, the crude colloidal RuPP solution was added to TiO2 (at 2 and 10 wt% Ru). The obtained slurry was stirred for 4 days at r.t. in the dark and under an argon atmosphere. Then the solvent was filtered off which led to the light/dark gray solids RuPP(2%)-TiO2 and RuPP(10%)-TiO2, respectively, which were washed with hexane and dried under vacuum. Finally, the obtained nanomaterials were gradually exposed to air by slow oxygen diffusion at r.t. into a screw cap vial in which the solids were introduced under Ar, giving rise to the corresponding Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 nanohybrids (Scheme 1). This final protection step was performed in a controlled manner due to the known high reactivity of RuPP NPs when exposed to air, which alters their morphology and decreases their catalytic performance in the HER.12 The so-obtained hybrid nanomaterials were characterized using a set of complementary techniques.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization of the RuPP(2%)-TiO2 and RuPP(10%)-TiO2 hybrids was carried out after depositing a drop of the slurry onto a carbon-covered copper grid. The deposition of small NPs onto the surface of TiO2 crystals was observed for RuPP(2%)-TiO2 with no RuPP NPs visible outside of the grains (Fig. S1a in the ESI†). Both isolated and supported NPs were observed for the RuPP(10%)-TiO2 sample (Fig. S1b†). Therefore, the study was continued only at low metal content, namely with the RuPP(2%)-TiO2 sample. After a protection step by reacting with air, the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 sample presented a Ru metal content of 1.6 wt% as determined by ICP-OES analysis. Besides, HRTEM, HAADF-STEM (Fig. 1b–d) and EDX (Fig. S2†) analyses on this sample evidenced the unaltered morphology and dispersion of the NPs in the hybrid materials after surface-oxidation. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) electron diffraction patterns showed particles with crystalline characteristics. The interplanar distances measured are indicative of the presence of both Ru and RuO2 phases (Fig. S3†). The mean average diameter of the Ru/RuO2 NPs in the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 sample calculated from HRTEM images (Fig. 1b) is 1.7 ± 0.4 nm. The chemical composition of the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 sample was further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The mixture of metallic Ru and RuO2 was confirmed (Fig. S4†), with Ru 3d5/2 peaks centered at 279.8 eV (metallic Ru) and 280.8 eV (RuO2).
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The photocatalytic performance of the nanomaterials towards the HER was evaluated in 0.2 M TEOA aqueous solution at pH 7 (25 °C) and, unless otherwise stated, under visible-light illumination (λ > 400 nm) calibrated to 1 sun intensity (see Fig. S5† for a schematic representation of the employed setup). Together with TEOA as the SED,17 the three molecular PAs shown in Chart 1 have been assayed in combination with Ru@RuO2PP and Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 as HER (photo)catalysts. A summary of the obtained photocatalytic results can be found in Table 1.

Initially, the photocatalytic performance of non-supported Ru@RuO2PP was assessed. The visible-light irradiation of a colloidal solution of Ru@RuO2PP, TEOA and a PA among [Ru(bpy)3]3+, RuP or QuPh+-NA showed no H2 evolution (Fig. 2a and Table 1, entries 1–3). The addition of methyl viologen (MV2+, entries 4–5) as an electron mediator did not lead to significant improvements, with H2 evolution below 3.5 μmol after 10 h of irradiation. The low performance of the unsupported systems can be ascribed both to the low dispersibility and progressive aggregation of Ru@RuO2PP nanoparticles observed in aqueous media and to the inefficient charge accumulation within the nanoparticulate Ru catalysts leading to unfavorable charge recombination pathways.14 The latter hypothesis will be supported later on by photophysical data (see below). Finally, in contrast with the results of Fukuzumi and co-workers with the QuPh+-NA donor–acceptor dyad (λmax = 340 nm) combined with Ru NPs,14–16 when the Ru@RuO2PP/QuPh+-NA system was irradiated with the full solar spectrum (no UV filter applied in a quartz cell) no H2 production was observed (Fig. 2a and Table 1, entry 3). Thus, the results gathered with the unsupported Ru@RuO2PP nanomaterial highlight the need to improve the stability of this system in aqueous media and probably also the electronic communication/charge separation between it and visible-light PAs such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or its derivatives. The effect of semiconducting TiO2 as both the NP support and/or electron relay18–20 was then evaluated.

The photocatalytic experiments with Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 were performed in a pH neutral TEOA aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) and in the presence or absence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and RuP as PAs (Table 1, entries 6–8). As shown in Fig. 2b, hydrogen evolution was only observed in the presence of the RuP PA. The observed induction period may be ascribed to saturation of the aqueous solution prior to H2 diffusion to the headspace (where the gas is measured), although the reduction of NP RuO2 surface sites to more active metallic Ru under reductive conditions12 might also be considered. H2 production also occurred when bare TiO2 was combined with RuP under visible light irradiation, even if at extremely slow reaction rates (Table 1, entry 10). These results emphasize the major role of both the TiO2 support and the RuP PA phosphonic acid anchors in facilitating electron transfer and thus enabling HER photocatalysis. In contrast to non-supported Ru@RuO2PP, the hybrid Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 nanomaterial remains dispersed in the aqueous media and thus prevents deactivation by coalescence of the nanoparticulate catalyst under turnover conditions. As extensively reported, phosphonic acid groups are good TiO2 anchors,21 although partial binding to the nanoparticle surface cannot be excluded.
For a better understanding of the role of TiO2 in the electron transfer between the Ru NPs and RuP in the photocatalytic HER with Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2, TiO2 was replaced by ZrO2 in an analogous Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2 hybrid that was prepared following the synthetic protocol described in Scheme 1 (see the Experimental Section and Fig. S6† for further details on its synthesis and characterization). The mismatch between the potentials of the excited RuP and the ZrO2 conduction band (CB) prevents the photoinduced charge separation between the dye and the metal oxide.18 As shown in Fig. 2b and entry 9 in Table 1, no H2 evolution is observed when Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2, RuP and TEOA are irradiated with visible-light in neutral water, which suggests no direct electron transfer between the PA and the catalyst and thus confirms the electron-mediating role of TiO2 in the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 hybrid.
With an active photocatalytic system on hand, optimization of the RuP and Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 concentrations was carried out before proceeding to long-term stability analyses. First, three different RuP concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mM) were assayed under identical reaction conditions (Fig. 2c). Maximum H2 production rates were reached at low/medium RuP concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 mM). The unproductive absorption of light by non-anchored RuP molecules that remain in solution after TiO2 surface saturation could be at the origin of the lower performance of the photocatalytic system at high concentrations of RuP (0.2 mM). UV-vis spectroscopy was employed to analyze the amount of bound/unbound RuP when mixed with 2 mg of the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 hybrid. Thus, for both 0.05 and 0.1 mM solutions ca. 25% (0.0125 and 0.025 mM, respectively) of the added RuP was found to remain in solution against 36% (0.072 mM) for the 0.2 mM case (Fig. S7†). Accordingly, the increase of anchored RuP in the studied 0.05–0.2 mM range is not linear, being significantly reduced at high concentration (Fig. S8†). Thus, even if more RuP is anchored at the surface of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 at 0.2 mM (513 nmol vs. 300 nmol at 0.1 mM), the significant increase of unbound PA at this concentration (0.072 mM, Fig. S7†) decreases the performance of the photocatalytic system due to unproductive light absorption (compare entries 7 and 11 in Table 1). Finally, the variation of the quantity of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 (2 and 4 mg) was studied at the optimum photocatalyst-RuP ratio showing a linear increase of the evolved hydrogen (Fig. 2d).
In order to avoid the unproductive absorption of light resulting from unbound PA in solution, a Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP hybrid (where the RuP PA was previously bound to Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2) was prepared by mixing 4 mg of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 and 0.1 mM RuP in 4 mL of water for 20 min followed by centrifugation (see the Experimental Section and Fig. S9 in the ESI†). The amount of RuP anchored in the resulting yellowish solid was determined through both the absorption changes in the UV-vis spectra of the solution measured before and after the grafting process and ICP-OES/MS (1.6 wt% Ru/0.07 wt% P) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, when triggered by visible-light in a 0.2 M TEOA aqueous solution the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP hybrid shows superior HER performance compared to the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 + RuP mixture, thus confirming the detrimental effect of unbound RuP in HER photocatalysis.
 Fig. 3  Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution profile (left) and hydrogen evolution rate per 2 h (right) for Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 (4 mg) + [RuP] = 0.1 mM (green) and Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP (red) under visible-light irradiation in a 4 mL 0.2 M TEOA aqueous solution at pH 7. 
Under optimized conditions, visible-light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation at 1 sun intensity of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP (4 mg) in 4 mL of a 0.2 M TEOA aqueous solution yields 111 μmol of H2 in 10 h and the maximum H2 evolution rate (HEmax rate) and turnover frequency (TOFmax) of 12.6 μmol h−1 and 21.5 molH2 h−1 molRu−1, respectively (Table 1, entry 11). An apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 1.3% has been determined under these optimized conditions (see the ESI† for the detailed calculation). The long-term stability of the photocatalytic system was evaluated under the same optimized conditions, generating 280 μmol of H2 after 130 h under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 3a). This durability is remarkable, particularly when compared to that of photochemical systems involving TiO2-supported molecular catalysts18,22 (see Table S1† for details), in which fast deactivation due to catalyst degradation typically occurs under operating conditions. Comparing the HER performance of different photocatalysts is not an easy task given the lack of a common benchmarking protocol and the various conditions in which they are tested. However, the main photocatalytic data of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP and those of examples in the literature based on TiO2-supported Ru- or Pt-based nanocatalysts are shown in Table S1† together with those of TiO2-supported systems involving molecular catalysts. In this respect, our Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP hybrid displays comparable performances with respect to Pt-supported systems in terms of the amount of hydrogen produced albeit with slower rates, whereas it clearly outperforms TiO2-supported molecular catalysts particularly as far as long-term stability is concerned. For further comparison, Table S2† shows the photocatalytic data obtained on unsupported Ru- and Pt-based systems which, as previously suggested, definitely prove the relevance of the TiO2 support in enabling photoinduced hydrogen evolution by the Ru@RuO2PP catalyst. Under optimized conditions, a progressive decrease of the H2 evolution rate with time is observed along the time course of photocatalysis (i.e. HEmax = 12.6 μmol h−1vs. HE18h–20h = 7.5 μmol h−1, see Fig. 3b). Considering the maximum amount of hydrogen produced (280 μmol), the initial amount of TEOA present in solution (800 μmol), and the two-electron nature of the latter as a SED,17 we can estimate that only 35% TEOA is consumed after 130 h of irradiation, thus suggesting that consumption of the SED can be ruled out as a possible reason for photocatalyst deactivation.
Hence, with the aim of understanding the origin of the observed decrease and eventual cessation of photocatalytic activity, the fate of the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 photocatalyst after a long photocatalytic run was studied by both TEM (Fig. S10†) and ICP-OES/MS analyses. A carbon covered copper grid was prepared by depositing a drop of the slurry at the end of the photocatalytic experiment. The TEM image (Fig. S10†) shows both (1) the presence of isolated NPs leached from the TiO2 surface and (2) agglomeration of the hybrid nanomaterial under turnover conditions. Thus, the mechanical instability of the RuPPNPs-TiO2 interface and the aggregation of the hybrid nanomaterial can be at the origin of the observed decrease in photocatalytic activity.
Additionally, the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP photocatalyst was recovered from the photocatalytic cell by centrifugation followed by washing with water, isopropanol and diethyl ether and dried under vacuum. ICP-OES/MS analyses of the resulting brown solid indicated Ru and P contents of 0.4 wt% and 0.07 wt%, respectively. From the P content the amount of RuP anchored to the photocatalyst surface could be estimated and, therefore, the wt% Ru arising from Ru@RuO2PP NPs that remains in the sample after photocatalysis, namely 0.29 wt%. Considering the wt% of Ru and P present in the as-synthesized Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP hybrid (1.6 wt% and 0.07 wt%, respectively), this value indicates that 82% of the Ru content leached from the TiO2 surface after 130 h of photocatalysis.
Photophysical analysis
The kinetic analysis of the electron transfer events occurring upon irradiation was performed by a combination of time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopic studies on thin films immersed in aqueous solutions under N2-purged conditions (see the Experimental Section for further details).
The primary photochemical process was established by means of time-resolved luminescence analysis upon 532 nm excitation by recording the emission intensity at 620 nm (Fig. 4). As is apparent, negligible emission is observed when the RuP chromophore is attached to TiO2 (TiO2-RuP) when compared to the result obtained for the same dye on ZrO2 (ZrO2-RuP). This is in agreement with the expected quenching of the RuP excited state by electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band (ECB = −0.7 V vs. NHE at pH 7),18 which is unfeasible in the case of ZrO2 (ECB = −1.4 V vs. NHE at pH 7).23 This process is indeed expected to occur with almost unitary efficiency within <100 ps.24 Interestingly, negligible quenching of the luminescence is observed with RuP on ZrO2 in the presence of either the catalyst (Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2-RuP) or the TEOA sacrificial donor (ZrO2-RuP/TEOA) where the lifetime of the RuP excited state appreciably matches the one of RuP alone (ZrO2-RuP, τ ∼330 ns, see Fig. S11† for related fittings). These results thus confirm that in the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP/TEOA system the primary photochemical event is the ultrafast electron injection from the excited state of the RuP chromophore to the TiO2 conduction band leading to an oxidized RuP+ species at the surface and a formally reduced semiconductor (eqn (1) and (2)). TiO2-RuP + hν → TiO2-RuP*(1) TiO2-RuP* → TiO2(e−)-RuP+(2)
 Fig. 4  Time-resolved luminescence decays measured at 620 nm by laser flash photolysis (excitation at 532 nm) of thin films in N2-purged aqueous solutions: ZrO2-RuP in 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH 7 (black trace), Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2-RuP in 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH 7 (red trace), ZrO2-RuP in 0.2 M TEOA at pH 7 (blue trace), and TiO2-RuP in 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH 7 (green trace). 
Furthermore, the failure to observe any quenching of the RuP excited state in both Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2-RuP and ZrO2-RuP/TEOA suggests the inefficiency of both oxidative quenching by the Ru@RuO2PP catalyst and reductive quenching by TEOA. This result supports the observation of negligible hydrogen evolution activity in the absence of TiO2 (see Table 1) and points towards the fundamental requirement of the semiconductor as an electron-transfer mediator for efficient hydrogen production.
The subsequent electron transfer events were then monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy. The electron transfer from the TEOA sacrificial donor to the oxidized RuP chromophore was analyzed upon 532 nm excitation of TiO2-RuP by observing the decay of the transient signal at 450 nm corresponding to the bleaching of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition characteristic of the RuP+ species (Fig. 5).25 In the absence of the electron donor this transient signal decays to the baseline with complex kinetics which requires three exponentials for a reasonable fitting.26 An average lifetime of τ = 0.37 ms can be estimated (Fig. S12†). This process can be assigned to the charge recombination between the oxidized RuP chromophore and the electron in the TiO2 conduction band (eqn (3)). The complex kinetics observed is indeed characteristic of such a recombination process.26,27 TiO2(e−)-RuP+ → TiO2-RuP(3)
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption kinetics at 450 nm measured by laser flash photolysis (excitation at 532 nm) of TiO2-RuP in N2-purged aqueous solutions containing 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH 7 (black trace) and 0.2 M TEOA at pH 7 (red trace). 
In the presence of the TEOA donor (0.2 M, pH 7) the transient signal at 450 nm decays more rapidly and this is attributable to a fast recovery of the RuP ground state via electron transfer from the TEOA to the RuP+ species (eqn (4)). The oxidized TEOA is then expected to decompose upon electron transfer (eqn (5)).17 A lifetime of τ = 12.1 μs can be estimated for RuP+ in the presence of 0.2 M TEOA at pH 7 from a single-exponential fitting of the kinetic trace (Fig. S12†). This value translates into ca. 97% efficiency for the hole scavenging process from the photogenerated oxidized chromophore under the experimental conditions used in the hydrogen evolution experiments. Overall, these data are consistent with those reported for a similar photochemical system.18 TiO2(e−)-RuP+ + TEOA → TiO2(e−)-RuP + TEOA+(4) TEOA+ → decomposition products(5)
Due to the irreversible nature of the TEOA oxidation process (eqn (5)), RuP+ reduction by the sacrificial donor leads to accumulation of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band (eqn (4) and (5)). The fate of these electrons was studied by transient absorption spectroscopy from the featuring absorption in the red portion of the visible spectrum.28 Dye excitation at 532 nm in TiO2-RuP in the presence of TEOA produces a permanent transient absorption at 750 nm attributable to long-lived electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. This transient signal indeed remains constant within the time-window of the experiment (Fig. 6a, black trace). The same transient absorption is still present upon 532 nm excitation of the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP system in 0.2 M TEOA. However, this is observed to decay to the baseline within ca. 100 ms (Fig. 6a, red trace). This evidence can be attributed to the reduction of the Ru@RuO2PP catalyst by electrons in the TiO2 conduction band (eqn (6)). Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2(e−)-RuP → Ru@RuO2PP(e−)-TiO2-RuP(6)
 Fig. 6  Transient absorption kinetics at 750 nm measured by laser flash photolysis of thin films in N2-purged aqueous solutions containing 0.2 M TEOA at pH 7: (a) excitation at 532 nm of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP and TiO2-RuP; (b) excitation at 355 nm of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 and TiO2. 
Interestingly, comparable results are obtained in the absence of the RuP chromophore upon band-gap excitation at 355 nm of the TiO2 semiconductor in the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 6b), thus confirming the mechanistic assignment. A time-constant of τ = 25 ms can be estimated for the electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the Ru@RuO2PP nanoparticles. This value is considerably larger than the one observed for the electron transfer from TiO2 to two different molecular catalysts, namely a cobaloxime and a nickel(II) bis(diphosphine) complex,18,22 apparently suggesting a greater inertness of the nanoparticulate material towards electron transfer with respect to molecular species.‡ Furthermore, under continuous irradiation and concomitant electron accumulation within the catalytic Ru@RuO2PP unit the Fermi level of the ruthenium nanoparticle is expected to up-shift.29 Accordingly, before hydrogen elimination, electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to Ru@RuO2PP is expected to become progressively less favorable on thermodynamic grounds and, as a consequence, kinetically slower. Taken together, considering the sequence of the photo-triggered electron transfer processes previously discussed, these results unavoidably point towards the identification of electron accumulation within the catalytic Ru@RuO2PP as the rate-determining step in light-driven hydrogen evolution by the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP/TEOA system. The whole series of electron transfer events is summarized in Fig. 7.

Experimental
Materials and methods
The 4-phenylpyridine ligand and titanium dioxide P-25 anatase/rutile (TiO2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and dried through vacuum/Ar cycles before their use. A 0.2 M MilliQ aqueous solution of triethanolamine (Sigma Aldrich) was adjusted to pH 7 by the addition of HCl. The organometallic precursor [Ru(cod)(cot)] was commercially obtained from Nanomeps. All solvents (Scharlab) were distilled over Na/benzophenone (THF) or CaH2 (hexane) and degassed by freeze–pump–thaw cycles. H2 and Ar were purchased from Alphagaz. The synthesis of the nanoparticles was performed under an Ar inert atmosphere using Schlenk line techniques or a glovebox (MBraun Unilab Workstation 9550). The photosensitizers [Ru(bpy)3](ClO4)2 and [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-(PO3H2)2(bpy))]Cl2 (RuP) were synthesized using procedures previously described in the literature.30–32 2-Phenyl-4-(1-naphthyl)quinolinium triflate (QuPh+-NA) was synthesized following a reported method.33

Synthesis of supported Ru NPs on TiO2 (Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2). 
4-Phenylpyridine-capped Ru nanoparticles (RuPP NPs) were prepared following a previous report12 by exposing a mixture of 150 mg (0.476 mmol) of [Ru(cod)(cot)] and 15 mg (0.095 mmol) of 4-phenylpyridine (PP) in dried and degassed THF in a Fisher Porter bottle to a hydrogen atmosphere (3 bar) for 16 h. One drop of the resulting colloidal solution was deposited onto a carbon covered copper grid for TEM characterization (mean diameter = 1.4 ± 0.3 nm). 12.8 mL or 64 mL of the colloidal black solution was then added under Ar to 200 mg of TiO2 placed in two independent Schlenk flasks and the mixtures were stirred for 4 days in the dark. The solvent was filtered off and the materials were washed with hexane (10 mL, 3 times) using a cannula to obtain RuPP(2%)-TiO2 or RuPP(10%)-TiO2 as grey solids. The obtained RuPP(2%)-TiO2 nanomaterial was placed in an Ar-filled screw cap vial and gradually exposed to air by slow oxygen diffusion at r.t. (20 days), yielding the corresponding Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 nanohybrid. ICP-OES characterization of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 indicated a ruthenium content of 1.6 Ru wt%.


Synthesis of supported RuPP NPs on ZrO2 (Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2). 
Following the same procedure described above for the preparation of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2, the addition of 2.55 mL of the RuPP colloidal solution into 40 mg of ZrO2 yields Ru@RuO2PP-ZrO2 after slow surface-oxidation. ICP-OES: 1.6 Ru wt%.


Synthesis of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP. 
4 mg of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2 and 4 mL of (MilliQ) water were added to a vial containing a stir bar. The solid was sonicated for 5 min until total dispersion of the material. Then, 80 μL of an aqueous solution of RuP (5 mM) were added to the dispersion and the resulting suspension was stirred for 15 min. The solid was isolated by centrifugation (10 min, 2000 rpm) and washed 3 times with water. ICP characterization of Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP indicated a ruthenium content of 1.6 wt% (ICP-OES) and phosphorus content of 0.07 wt% (ICP-MS).

Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron diffraction analysis were performed either using a JEOL 1400 microscope operating at 100 kV at the “Servei de Microscopia Electronica” of the UAB or using a JEOL JEM 1011 microscope operating at 100 kV with a resolution point of 0.45 nm or using a JEOL JEM-ARM 200F microscope working at 200 kV with a lower resolution point of 0.19 nm at the “Centre de Microcaracterisation Raimond Castaing” under UMS-CNRS 3623. Samples were prepared by deposition of some drops of dispersed material in a solvent onto a carbon covered copper grid. Micrographs were treated with ImageJ to obtain the statistical size distribution of the nanoparticles, assuming that they are spherical. NP sizes are quoted as the mean diameter ± the standard deviation. Inductively-Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES and ICP-MS) measurements were performed at the “Servei d'Analisi Quimica” (SAQ) at the UAB on an Optima 4300DV PerkinElmer system. Solid samples were prepared by digesting 1 mg of the RuPPNPs-TiO2 with aqua regia under microwave conditions followed by a dilution of the mixture with 1% HCl (v/v). The samples were microfiltered (0.45 μm) prior to injection to eliminate white colloidal TiO2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed at the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2) in Barcelona with a Phoibos 150 analyzer (SPECS GmbH, Berlin, Germany) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (base pressure 5 × 10−10 mbar) with a monochromatic aluminium Kalpha X-ray 456 source (1486.74 eV). The energy resolution was measured from the FWHM of the Ag 3d5/2 peak which for a sputtered silver foil was 0.62 eV.
Photocatalytic experiments
The hydrogen evolved was measured by using a Clark hydrogen electrode (Unisense H2-NP-9463). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was performed in a 6 mL glass cell thermostated at 25 °C, containing 4 mL of 0.2 M TEOA as the SED in which the photocatalyst was dispersed in the dark in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. The cell was sealed with a septum and grease and the Clark electrode tip was introduced into the headspace of the cell (Fig. S5†). The solution was degassed with Ar bubbling for at least 10 min until stabilization of the signal. A concentrated water solution of the photosensitizer was injected. A flat signal was recorded for at least 2 min. Then, the cell was irradiated with a solar simulator (Abet 10500) containing a Xe lamp placed at exactly 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) distance. After recording the hydrogen evolution, the cell was degassed by Ar bubbling and calibration was performed by injecting known volumes of H2 (usually 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 400 μL, Fig. S13†) with a Hamilton syringe for gases.
Photophysical experiments
Time-resolved emission and absorption measurements were performed with a custom laser spectrometer comprising a Continuum Surelite II Nd:YAG laser (FWHM 6–8 ns) with the frequency doubling (532 nm) or tripling (355 nm) option and an Applied Photophysics xenon light source including a mod. 720 150 W lamp housing, a mod. 620 power-controlled lamp supply and a mod. 03 −102 arc lamp pulser. Laser excitation was provided at 90° with respect to the white light probe beam. Light emitted or transmitted by the sample was focused onto the entrance slit of a 300 mm focal length Acton SpectraPro 2300i triple grating, flat field, and double exit monochromator equipped with a photomultiplier detector (Hamamatsu R3896). Signals from the photomultiplier were processed by means of a Teledyne LeCroy 604Zi (400 MHz, 20 GS s−1) digital oscilloscope. The excitation pulse (either of 532 or 355 nm wavelength) was defocused using a diverging lens and set to an average energy of ∼5 mJ per pulse using a combination of neutral density filters (Edmund Optics). Measurements were carried out at pH 7 in the presence of either 0.2 M TEOA or 0.1 M Na2SO4, and the solutions were purged with nitrogen for 20 minutes before each experiment. TiO2 and ZrO2 thin films were prepared by doctor-blading of TiO2 or ZrO2 paste onto FTO-covered glasses (20 cm × 20 cm, TEC 8, 8 Ω cm−1, purchased from Pilkington) followed by calcination at 500 °C for 30 min. An active surface area of 1.5 cm2 was achieved. The TiO2 paste was commercially obtained (18NR-T, GreatCell-Solar), while the ZrO2 paste was prepared according to the literature.34 Adsorption of RuP onto TiO2 or ZrO2 thin films was performed by soaking the electrode overnight in a 0.1 mM RuP solution in ethanol providing an absorbance of ∼0.6 at the maximum of the MLCT transition. Deposition of Ru@RuO2PP was performed by dispersion of the nanomaterial in a THF solution (concentration of approximately 2–3 mg mL−1) followed by spin-coating (3 steps, each of 20 seconds at 2000 rpm). In the three-component sample (Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP) deposition of Ru@RuO2PP was performed prior to soaking in the RuP solution.
Conclusions
Summarizing, a ternary hybrid nanomaterial, Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP, has been prepared through a synthetic protocol comprising the organometallic synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles stabilized by the 4-phenylpyridine ligand (RuPP), the deposition of the RuPP NPs onto TiO2 by impregnation of the support, and the sensitization of the latter with a visible-light photoabsorber bearing phosphonic acid anchors (RuP). When combined with TEOA as the SED, the Ru@RuO2PP-TiO2-RuP nanomaterial is able to promote efficient visible-light-driven HER photocatalysis for more than 100 h, yielding TON and TOF values over 480 molH2 molRu−1 and 21.5 molH2 h−1 molRu−1, respectively, with an AQY of 1.3%. Photophysical investigation by means of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques provided a proper description of the photoinduced dynamics within the hybrid photocatalytic system and pointed towards the identification of the electron accumulation within the Ru@RuO2PP catalyst as the rate-limiting step in photocatalysis. The combined photocatalytic and photophysical analysis allowed identifying the double key role of TiO2 in this HER photocatalytic system. First, TiO2 acts as an efficient dispersing agent for the nanoparticulate catalyst (Ru@RuO2PP) under aqueous conditions, thus preventing its fast coagulation and consequent reduction of the accessible active sites. Second, it enables electronic communication between the catalyst (Ru@RuO2PP) and the anchored molecular photoabsorber (RuP) under visible-light irradiation, acting as a competent (and necessary) electron relay. Thus, the double role of TiO2 as both the support and electron-mediator allows attaining, for the first time to our knowledge, efficient visible-light-driven HER photocatalysis combining a Ru-based photocatalyst and a molecular photoabsorber.

Footnotes† Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/d0se00446d‡ The observation of comparable quantum yields for hydrogen evolution in this work and in ref. 18 (involving a cobaloxime catalyst supported on TiO2) strongly suggests that besides the first ET step from the TiO2 CB to the catalyst, the subsequent ET events also have a strong impact on the overall hydrogen evolution rate. In this respect, the second ET from the TiO2 CB to a reduced cobaloxime catalyst (involving Co(II) → Co(I) reduction) is indeed expected to be 105 times slower than the first ET event (involving Co(III) → Co(II) reduction).35This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020

‡ The observation of comparable quantum yields for hydrogen evolution in this work and in ref. 18 (involving a cobaloxime catalyst supported on TiO2) strongly suggests that besides the first ET step from the TiO2 CB to the catalyst, the subsequent ET events also have a strong impact on the overall hydrogen evolution rate. In this respect, the second ET from the TiO2 CB to a reduced cobaloxime catalyst (involving Co(II) → Co(I) reduction) is indeed expected to be 105 times slower than the first ET event (involving Co(III) → Co(II) reduction).35
