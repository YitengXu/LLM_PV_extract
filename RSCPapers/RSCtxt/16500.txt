    , Accepted 21st April 2022First published on 11th May 2022AbstractChiral metal halides have shown great potential for application in next generation nonlinear optical (NLO) devices owing to their intrinsic non-centrosymmetry. However, the structures and properties of chiral hybrid indium halides have been rarely reported, especially when it comes to second-harmonic generation (SHG) in NLO. In this work, we have synthesized a pair of new zero-dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid indium halides, (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9, and studied their NLO properties. The as-prepared chiral hybrid indium halides crystallize in non-centrosymmetric P3221 and P3121 space groups, respectively. NLO studies show that 0D chiral hybrid indium halide crystals exhibit strong SHG responses with high polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold (LDT). This work enriches the family of chiral hybrid metal halide materials and offers a feasible strategy for the targeted design and synthesis of intrinsically non-centrosymmetric metal halide materials for NLO applications.
Introduction
Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have attracted extensive attention owing to their great importance in a wide range of applications in laser and information technologies, ranging from frequency conversion, high-resolution photoetching, and multiphoton microscopy to information processing and storage.1–10 NLO effects describe the interaction between strong light and medium, among which second-harmonic generation (SHG) is an optical frequency doubling process and is one of the most extensively applied NLO phenomena.11 The SHG response requires a strict structural non-centrosymmetry of the NLO medium.12,13 In addition, optical transparency and high laser damage threshold (LDT) constitute important factors for SHG materials.12 Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) feature tunable band gap and structural diversity, and have been exploited as promising materials for broad applications in photodiodes,14 solar cells,15 nonlinear optics,13,16 photodetectors,17 and lasers.18,19 In particular, the introduction of chiral components into the scaffolds of metal halides results in chiral HOMHs with intrinsic non-centrosymmetric structures. These chiral HOMHs have been widely studied as promising materials for applications in ferroelectrics,20,21 spintronics,22–24 and chiroptoelectronics,25 including circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors,26,27 circularly polarized LEDs,28,29 bio-responsive imaging,30 3D displays29,31 and chiral integrated photonic circuits.32,33 The introduction of chiral ligands can effectively induce the non-centrosymmetric crystallization of HOMHs, which meets the structural requirements for second-order NLO. Consequently, chiral HOMHs have become one of the vital promising materials in the fields of nonlinear optics and photonics. An increasing number of chiral HOMHs have been reported in recent years, which feature high efficiency NLO properties with wide infrared transparency and high laser damage thresholds.12,16,34,35
The photoelectric properties of HOMH materials are highly dependent on their structures and lattice compositions.36 From the perspective of structure, the initial and common 3D metal halide materials are highly sensitive to moisture in the environment, which hinders their application in optoelectronic devices.37 The reduction of dimension in HOMH materials from 3D to 2D, 1D and 0D structures effectively separates the metal halide polyhedron in space and enhances their resistance to moisture and photodegradation, which thus improve the stability of HOMH materials.38 Benefiting from the natural quantum confinement effect of low dimensional metal halide structures, the exciton binding energy can be effectively increased. Moreover, hybrid low-dimensional metal halides are subject to inherent quantum restrictions, which reduces the orbital overlap and increases the band gap.38,39 Compared with 3D HOMHs, low dimensional HOMHs form self-trapping excitons facilely, enhancing the structural distortion and the stability.35,40–43 In terms of composition, typical HOMHs feature 3D structures based on the tolerance factor with an ABX3 chemical formula, in which A are organic cations located in the 3D framework of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, while B usually represents the metal cation and X is a halide anion (Cl−, Br−, or I−).44,45 The reduction of dimension of metal halides can avoid the limitations from the Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor46 on account of the sundry organic cations. Compared to lead-based analogues, lead-free halides have recently received intense interest for optoelectronic device applications owing to their lower toxicity and better stability. Furthermore, the alteration of the band gap would be realized, and photoelectric properties would be optimized not only by replacing the divalent metal Pb2+ with trivalent ions such as Bi3+, In3+, Sb3+etc.,47 but also by changing halide anions (Cl−, Br−, and I−).48–50
Very recently, various low-dimensional lead-free HOMHs have been explored for NLO applications, such as (R-MPEA)1.5PbBr3.5(DMSO)0.5,16 (R-/S-MBA)2CuCl4,51 (R-/S-MBA)CuBr2,12 (R-/S-1,1-NEA)2CuCl4, (R-/S-1,2-NEA)2CuCl4,52 (R/S-MBA)4Cu4I8·2H2O,53 (R-/S-MPEA)2SnBr6,54 [(CH3)2CHNH3]GeI3,55 NH(CH3)3SnCl3, NH(CH3)3SnBr3,56 [NH2(CH2CH3)2]3BiCl6, and [NH2(CH2CH3)2]3BiBr6.57 In 2020, Nicholas et al. reported low-dimensional hybrid indium/antimony halide perovskites and studied their electronic properties.38 In 2021, Chen et al. reported broad photoluminescence and SHG in non-centrosymmetric organic–inorganic hybrid metal halides (C6H5(CH2)4NH3)4MX7·H2O (M = Bi or In, X = Br or I).58 However, chiral indium based HOMHs have been rarely explored for SHG responses. In this work, we employ the chiral β-methylphenethylamine (MPEA) as the organic component and the trivalent metal indium ion (In3+) as the metallic component and synthesize a pair of new 0D chiral organic–inorganic hybrid indium halides, which crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups of P3221 and P3121, respectively. These new 0D HOMH crystals exhibit strong SHG responses with high damage threshold, and are transparent in the visible range, which provides a reference for the development and applications of chiral 0D indium based organic–inorganic hybrid halides in nonlinear optics and photonics.
Experimental section
Synthesis of (R-/S-MPEA)6InCl9 single crystals
The chiral amine R- or S-MPEA (6.3 mL, 44.2 mmol) was dissolved in 20.0 mL of methanol, to which hydrochloric acid (48 wt% in water, 5.0 mL, 44.2 mmol) was added slowly under constant stirring in an ice water bath. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to yield the S- or R-MPEA+Cl− precursor as a white powder. The precursor S- or R-MPEA+Cl− (103.2 mg, 0.6 mmol) was mixed with InCl3·4H2O (29.32 mg, 0.1 mmol), which was completely dissolved in 2 mL of methanol. The whole system was sealed and put in a shaking-free place at room temperature. Colorless and hexagonal crystals were obtained after one week.
Preparation of (R-/S-MPEA)6InCl9 films
The films of (R-/S-MPEA)6InCl9 were fabricated by spin-coating. Silica glass plates (circular, diameter: 1 cm, washed successively with deionized water, isopropanol and ethanol in a sonicator for over 10 min) were used as the substrate. 150 mg of the as-prepared (R-/S-MPEA)6InCl9 crystals were dissolved in 100 μL of methanol. 20 μL of this solution was spread on the cleaned surface of the substrate and spin-coated at the spin rate of 3000 rpm for 20 s.
Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)
SCXRD data were obtained on a Rigaku XtalAB PRO MM007 DW diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) or Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 100 K. The structures of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 were solved and refined using Olex2 and SHELXS (full-matrix least squares on F2).59
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
PXRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku MiniFlex600, operated at 40 kV and 15 mA, at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 from 3° to 50°. The crystals need to be ground into powder before measurements.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
TGA measurements were performed using a TA-Instruments STD 2960 with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 from 300 to 800 K under an Ar atmosphere.
Calculation of electronic densities
The density functional theory (DFT) method is one of the most popular methods for the computation of the electronic structure of solids,60–66 and our calculations were implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.4.4) based on the DFT adopting projector augmented-wave method (PAW).67,68 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) has been selected to approximate the exchange–correlation energy.69 The van der Waals (vdW) interaction between the organics and inorganics was considered using the DFT-D3 correction by Grimme.70 For geometry optimization and electronic property calculation, convergences of 10−5 eV for energy and 10−4 eV Å−1 for force have been applied. The plane-wave basis set was defined by energy cutoff at 480 eV. For the division of the Brillouin zone (BZ), a Γ-centered 1 × 1 × 1 mesh was adopted.
Linear optical measurements
UV-vis diffusive reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. Linear circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained using an MOS-450 spectrophotometer in the transmission mode. The CD spectra were recorded in the 190–400 nm region with a 1 nm resolution. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-2500 spectrophotometer with an ultraviolet excitation wavelength of 365 nm.
NLO measurements
Single crystal NLO measurements were performed using a home-built scanning microscope71 with a femtosecond pump (Mai Tai HP, 100 fs, 80 MHz, 690 to 1040 nm) in the reflection geometry, with the incidence and detection angles both at 45°. The efficiency of second-order NLO of the hybrid metal halide materials was determined using Y-cut quartz crystals as the reference under the same measurement conditions.
Results and discussion
The new chiral 0D hybrid indium halide materials, (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9, have been synthesized by reacting the (R)-(+)- or (S)-(−)-β-methylphenethylammonium chloride (R- or S-MPEA+Cl−) precursor with InCl3 (see the Experimental section). Bulk colorless, transparent and hexagonal single crystals can be obtained by the slow diffusion of their solution in methanol (Fig. S1†). SCXRD analysis suggests that (R-MPEA)6InCl9 crystallizes in the P3221 space group and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 crystallizes in the P3121 space group, which are enantiomers belonging to the nonpolar 32 point group of the trigonal system.72 They have the same cell parameters (a = 17.05 Å, b = 17.05 Å, c = 39.52 Å, and β = 120° for (R-MPEA)6InCl9, and a = 17.01 Å, b = 17.01 Å, c = 39.21 Å, and β = 120° for (S-MPEA)6InCl9). More detailed data for crystal diffraction refinements are summarized in Table S1.† The comparison views of unit cells as shown in Fig. 1c and d suggest the structure of the R- and S-type crystal asymmetric unit respectively, which consists of six chiral ammonium cations (R-/S-MPEA+), a single [InCl6]3− anion and four free chloride ions. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, by introducing R- or S-MPEA as the chiral ligand, the distorted inorganic [InCl6]3− octahedra are isolated from each other to generate the 0D hybrid indium halide. (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 are mirror symmetrical along the crystallographic b-axis. The crystallographic structures of the two enantiomers along the crystallographic c-axis are shown in Fig. S2a and S2b,† respectively. The NH3+ cation from MPEA+ interacts with the nearby inorganic halide [InCl6]3− anions by N–H⋯Cl interactions (varying from 2.42 to 3.74 Å). Besides, the free chloride ions also interact with nearby MPEA+ cations via N–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds (varying from 2.32 to 3.83 Å), which further stabilizes the system (Fig. 2a). The Hirshfeld surface analyses73 have been carried out to study the intermolecular interactions. There are obvious hydrogen bonds between the inorganic part and organic molecule of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 (Fig. S3a and S3b†), and the proportion of hydrogen bonds in the total calculated surface area is 15.6%. The induction of chiral amine cations (R/S-MPEA+) results in the distortion of inorganic [InCl6]3− octahedra, as shown by the In–Cl bond lengths (varying from 2.49 to 2.54 Å) and Cl–In–Cl angles (varying from 88.86° to 91.84°) in the [InCl6]3− octahedra (Fig. 2b and Table S2†). The distortion degree of the individual [InCl6]3− octahedron is calculated based on the In–Cl bonds and Cl–In–Cl angles using the following equations:74  where d is the mean In–Cl bond length, dn is the individual In–Cl bond length, and θi is the individual bond angle of the octahedron. All of the relevant In–Cl bonds and Cl–In–Cl angles are shown in Tables S2 and S3,† with which we could calculate the octahedron distortion degree (bond distortion: Δd = 0.31 × 10−4; σ2 = 0.84), which is smaller than those of the previously reported Pb-, Sn-, and Bi-based hybrid halides.75,76 TGA suggests that (R-MPEA)6InCl9 does not lose obvious weight until 204 °C (Fig. S4b†), while (S-MPEA)6InCl9 does not lose obvious weight until 222 °C (Fig. S4c†), suggesting their high thermo-stability.

The PXRD patterns (Fig. 3a and b) are consistent with the simulation data from their corresponding single crystal structures, which confirms the phase purity of the hybrid indium halides. The PXRD patterns of the (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 crystals put in the natural environment after 60 days confirm their stability in the environment (Fig. S5a and S5b†). The ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectra of the (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 crystals show similar absorption peaks located at 225 nm and 270 nm (Fig. 3c).77 Besides, the CD spectra of the high-quality films of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 prepared by spin-coating the methanol solutions of their corresponding as-prepared crystals were recorded. CD peaks at about 225 nm and 270 nm are clearly present (Fig. 3d), confirming the chirality of the enantiomeric crystals. Upon photo-excitation at 365 nm, cyan fluorescence can be clearly observed from the picture taken using a fluorescence microscope (Fig. S6a†). The fluorescence spectra of the crystal show a weak cyan emission band at about 457 nm (Fig. S6b†). Besides, the chiral halide crystal is transparent in nature, with no absorption band in the visible region of the UV-vis absorbance spectra.

The bandgap of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9 calculated from the Tauc plot based on DRS is about 4.40 eV (Fig. S7†). The partial densities of states (PDOS) of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 have been calculated based on first principles with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.4.4) (Fig. 4a), and the bandgap is calculated to be about 3.91 eV (Fig. 4b). It is smaller than the experimentally measured value, which is probably due to the discontinuity of the exchange–correlation function.12,78,79 The PDOS near the valence band maximum (VBM) indicates that the valence electron state of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 is mainly from the electron orbitals of Cl 3p, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) mainly comes from C 2p orbitals, provided by R-MPEA. Upon light excitation, an electronic transition from the inorganic [InCl6]3− octahedron to the R-MPEA organic cations occurs (Fig. 4c and d).

We chose (R-MPEA)6InCl9 single crystals as the model system for study of their NLO properties using a home-built femtosecond laser set-up (wavelength tunable from 690 to 1040 nm) in a reflection acquisition mode. Fig. S8† shows the mapping image of the SHG intensity from a (R-MPEA)6InCl9 single crystal, obtained by faster scanning the SHG signal from the sample at 460 nm when pumped at 820 nm (scanning area: 3.2 × 2.5 mm2). The mapping image clearly shows the hexagonal profile of the single crystal and indicates the SHG activity of the single crystal. As shown in the wavelength dependent SHG spectra pumped at various wavelengths from 800 to 1040 nm with optimal polarization, the position of the SHG peak is always located at half of the pumped wavelength (Fig. 5a). Power dependence measurement at 800 nm indicates the quadratic dependence of the SHG intensity on the incident laser power (Fig. 5c), confirming the two-photon nature of this second-order NLO response. However, the SHG intensity of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 deviates away from this quadratic relationship when the laser power is higher than ∼961.0 mW (Fig. S9†), corresponding to a LDT of ∼3.82 mJ cm−2 (pumped at 800 nm, pulse width: 100 fs, the laser spot of 20 μm in diameter). It is pretty high in comparison with that of the reported hybrid halide materials,12,16 probably related to the wide band gap of the (R-MPEA)6InCl9 crystal with which self-absorption is avoided.

(d) Comparison of the SHG intensity of (R-MPEA)6InCl9 with that of Y-cut quartz at 1020 nm under the same measurement conditions. 
To explore the anisotropy of the NLO response from the (R-MPEA)6InCl9 crystal, we measured the polarization dependence of the SHG intensity as a function of the linear polarization angle. The measurements have been conducted by rotating the λ/2 plate to generate linearly polarized light in different directions, and Fig. 5b shows that experimental plots fit well to a cos4θ function.12,80 The value of the polarization ratio, ρ = (Imax − Imin)/(Imax + Imin), was calculated to be (93.1 ± 0.1) % for p-analyzers, which suggests a high sensitivity of the SHG response to the crystal symmetry.54 To further reveal the strength of the NLO response, we compared the SHG intensity between the (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and Y-cut quartz at various wavelengths, under the same measurement conditions (Fig. 5d). The SHG intensity of the (R-MPEA)6InCl9 single crystal exhibits a relatively strong SHG response, 5.5 times that of Y-cut quartz when pumped at 1020 nm.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a new class of chiral 0D hybrid indium halides, (R-MPEA)6InCl9 and (S-MPEA)6InCl9. The introduction of chiral β-methylphenethylammonium salt as the organic component directs the distorted inorganic [InCl6]3− octahedron which is assembled in non-centrosymmetric space groups of P3221 and P3121, respectively. The (R-MPEA)6InCl9 crystal exhibits high SHG responses, along with a wide bandgap, high transparency, great air stability, high polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold. This work offers a feasible strategy for the targeted design of intrinsic non-centrosymmetric 0D metal halide NLO materials, and these chiral 0D hybrid indium halide materials serve as promising candidates for NLO applications.
