The compounds have been characterized by IR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and their crystalline structures have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Isostructural compounds 1–3 crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal system with the Pbcn space group. Two N-oxide groups of INO anions connect to a pair of adjacent Pb(II) ions to create a one-dimensional (1D) infinite zigzag chain and carboxylate groups connect the lead(II) ions resulting in [Pb2O2] units. Nanoplates of compounds 1–3 have also been synthesized under ultrasonic irradiation and characterized by IR spectroscopy, SEM and PXRD. Moreover, compounds 1–3 exhibited reversible solid-state crystal-to-crystal transformation under mechanochemical reactions. The thermal stability of these crystalline materials has been presented. The fluorescence features of these compounds have also been studied in solution for bulk and nanostructures at ambient temperature.
Introduction
The construction of coordination polymers (CPs) with unique networks and variable physical features has been widely evaluated in supramolecular and materials chemistry.1–16 CPs consist of metal atoms as nodes and linking ligands as spacers. New CPs are mostly made up of transition metals or lanthanides and main group metals have remained less considered. We have reviewed the unique properties of lead(II) CPs, recently.17,18 Among the main group metals, special attention has been paid to lead(II) because of its interesting properties including a flexible coordination environment due to its electron configuration, various coordination numbers and a large ionic radius which can provide special opportunities to construct novel inorganic–organic hybrid materials.19–21 An intelligent choice of rigid and symmetric ligands provides a specific geometry to generate corresponding CPs. Isonicotinic acid N-oxide (INO) and its derivatives can be especially suitable in this regard.22,23 The carboxylate group is one of the most widely used bridging ligands for CPs with interesting photoluminescence properties.24–27 The flexibility of the INO ligand and its diverse coordination modes arise from the specific orientation of its functional groups.28,29 There are various synthetic strategies, among which branched-tube and sonochemical methods are simpler and affordable. Desirable single crystals of CPs are achieved by the branched-tube technique and the sonochemical method is applied to synthesize nanosized CPs.30 Nanoparticles of favorable sizes can be constructed by fast, cost effective and environmentally friendly sonochemical irradiation.31,32 Solid-state structural transformation of CPs promoted by light, heat and mechanochemical force has attracted enormous attention. Mechanochemical grinding of reactants in the presence or absence of solvents is a popular synthetic method for many CPs particularly in terms of environmental protection.33,34 In this regard, lead(II) CPs because of their flexible coordination environment can be an appropriate choice for evaluating structural transformations.35–38
The potential applications of CPs in many areas such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), catalysis, magnetism, and nonlinear optical and fluorescent materials have been derived from their highly changeable coordination motifs and these characteristics have prompted many chemists to research in this field.39–45 Among these compounds, lead(II) CPs show luminescence, fluorescence and birefringence.46–49 For example, one of the most promising light harvesters is organolead halide perovskites (APbX3) for mesoscopic solar cells. Considerable attention has been paid to the CPs as inorganic–organic hybrid materials with both luminescence and semiconductive properties.50–55 Halide lead(II) CPs also have components similar to APbX3 and can be considered in photophysical applications. In this study, a series of novel 3D isostructural chloro-, bromo- and iodo-lead(II) CPs, [Pb(INO)X]n (X = Cl (1), Br (2), I (3); INO = isonicotinic acid N-oxide), in the form of single crystals have been synthesized through a branched-tube technique and determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Also, crystalline powders of the CPs have been successfully prepared by an ultrasonic technique and have been determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Structural transformations have been studied through the mechanochemical reactions of these crystals with inorganic salts KCl, KBr and KI in bulk and nanoscale. Moreover, the related properties, such as thermal stability, and the photoluminescence properties of CPs 1–3 have been studied.
Results and discussion
The general characterization of [Pb(INO)X]n, [X = Cl (1), Br (2), I (3)]
CPs 1–3 were similarly synthesized through two different methods at room temperature. All the crystalline compounds were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy (ESI,† Fig. S1), elemental and PXRD analyses, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the FT-IR spectra of 1–3, the sharp peak near 1200 cm−1 indicates the characteristic stretching vibration of N-oxide groups. The peaks appearing at 1537–1580, 1533–1577 and 1531–1374 cm−1 are related to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups, respectively. The calculated PXRD patterns using the single-crystal diffraction data were similar to the experimental patterns for each CP. Also, the PXRD patterns demonstrated that all of the compounds obtained from both synthetic methods were of the same crystalline structure (ESI,† Fig. S2).

1–3 crystals
Single-crystal X-ray and PXRD analyses of the CPs [Pb(INO)X]n proved that the three crystals are isostructural. Fig. 1 shows that the diffraction patterns of the three compounds are the same just by changing the halide ions from Cl to I and with an increasing ionic radius; the d-spacing increases and the main diffraction peaks slightly shift to the smaller angles. Single-crystal X-ray measurements revealed that isostructural compounds 1–3 crystallize in the orthorhombic system with the Pbcn space group and the asymmetric units contain one lead(II), one INO ligand, and one halide anion.
 Fig. 1  PXRD patterns: comparison of isostructural CPs 1–3. 
In the three compounds, each lead(II) ion has a seven-coordinated geometry, surrounded by five O atoms from the INO ligand (three sides of the carboxylate and two sides of the N-oxide) and two halide ions, forming a [PbO5X2] distorted monocapped trigonal prismatic coordination environment (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Coordination environments around the lead(II) ion for 1–3, color code: Pb (pink); O (red); N (blue); C (gray); Cl (yellow); Br (green); I (violet). 
The Pb–O distances are in the range of 2.51–2.72, 2.52–2.71 and 2.53–2.72 Å for compounds 1–3, respectively. Although the bond length of Pb–X increases from 1 to 3, the angle of X–Pb–X decreases from 1 to 3 (97.11, 94.037 and 89.996) which can be attributed to the steric effects of the halide ions.29 In all the compounds, two N-oxide groups of the INO anion adopting chelating (μ2) modes connect to a pair of adjacent Pb(II) ions to create a one-dimensional (1D) infinite zigzag chain along the b direction (Fig. 3a) with a Pb⋯Pb distance of 4.29, 4.32 and 4.38 Å for 1–3, respectively. Since these CPs are isostructural and the only structural differences among them are the bond distances and angles of atoms, we only present compound 1 in ESI,† Fig. S3 and the other parameters are listed in Table 1 in detail. Two adjacent 1D zigzag chains are linked through the INO ligands attached to each Pb(II) ion to form a three-dimensional (3D) structure (Fig. 3b and c). Also, face-to-face π–π stacking interactions, between the INO ligands in the range of 3.83, 3.95 and 4.2 Å for 1–3, have a great effect on their stability (Fig. 3a and ESI,† Fig. S3a). In these structures, carboxylate groups are present in the chelating-bridging coordination mode (μ2-η2:η1) coordination that form [Pb2O2] units with Pb⋯Pb distances of 4.18, 4.20 and 4.30 Å as well as two equal angles of 69.3, 69.0 and 69.5 for 1–3, respectively (ESI,† Fig. S3b). The crystal packing of the 3D structures of 1–3 is shown in ESI,† Fig. S4 along the a, b and c directions.

Ultrasound-assisted synthesis of CPs 1–3
These compounds were synthesized in the presence of ultrasonic irradiation. The PXRD patterns indicated that all of the compounds were crystalline and are essentially the same as those single crystals from the structure synthesized by the branched-tube method (ESI,† Fig. S2). The final products of both methods are the same, except that the CPs obtained from the branched-tube method are single crystals and can be characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis. In the sonochemical method, the nanosized crystalline powders of these three compounds were synthesized much faster with higher yields. The morphology and size of the crystals were studied by SEM. The SEM images showed that the particles of 1–3 were polygon plates and had similar morphologies (ESI,† Fig. S5).
Reversible CTC transformation
As mentioned above, mechanochemical synthesis is another practical synthetic route for the construction of CPs, and has developed rapidly due to its low environmental impact and high efficiency. Isostructural CPs 1–3 provide a chance to evaluate the solid state halide ion replacement by mechanochemical conversion (Fig. 4). At first, the FT-IR spectra showed that the CTC transformations can be reversibly performed (ESI,† Fig. S6).
 Fig. 4  Reversible CTC transformations for 1–3 by the mechanochemical method (G = grinding). 
To further confirm the transformations in 1–3, their crystallinity and crystal phase were proved by PXRD. ESI,† Fig. S7–S9 show that the PXRD patterns obtained from the grinding of these three CPs match quite well with the simulated data. The capability of the compounds to accomplish structural transformations can be linked to the flexible lead(II) atom coordination, the flexibility of the INO ligand because of having an N-oxide group and the presence of halogen atoms that are chemically similar to each other.
Thermal stability
The thermal stability of CPs 1–3 was compared and is shown in Fig. 5. The starting temperature for decomposition of 2 is lower than that of 3. Compound 3 exhibits no remarkable weight loss up to 250 °C and the other two begin to collapse at about 170 and 200 °C, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the thermal behaviors of compounds 1–3. 
Thermogravimetric analysis showed three distinct weight loss steps for 1–3 (ESI,† Fig. S10). 1 exhibits the first mass loss of 21.3% at 170–270 °C, which may correspond to C5H4N (calcd. 19.99%). The step between 270 and 330 °C can be attributed to the release of Cl atoms with a weight loss of about 9.95% (calcd. 9.31). The final residual species has a weight of 68.75% (calcd. 68.765%) of the total sample, and it seems to be PbCO3 which finally would form PbO and CO2.56 The final product has a weight of 56.86% (calcd. 58.62) of the total sample and it seems to be PbO. The first weight loss of 28.15% (200–410 °C) for 2 corresponds to the complete decomposition of the ligand (obsd. 28.15%, calcd 29.03%). The second weight loss step between 410 and 550 °C (obsd. 18.87%, calcd 18.8%) is attributed to the elimination of Br atoms. The remaining solid over 550 °C could be PbO (obsd. 52.7%, calcd. 52.5%). For 3, the first sharp weight loss of 29.69% (calcd. 29.03%) between 250 and 300 °C is consistent with the disintegration of the INO ligand. The second step in the weight loss diagram at 300 °C is related to the removal of I atoms (obsd. 23.38%, calcd. 26.8%). Finally, the solid residue at 500 °C can be ascribed to PbO (obsd. 46.93%, calcd. 47.27%). Moreover, the weight loss at temperatures above 500 °C is probably due to the PbO phase change.
Photoluminescence properties
Heavy metals like lead(II) with an s2 electron configuration form complexes with photoluminescence (PL) effects under ambient conditions.57–60 The lead(II) CPs are promising materials with fascinating photophysical features. The effective factors on luminescence properties of the compounds include heavy metal effect, solvent concentration, particle size, solvent type, synthesis method and resonance/π system in the structure. The photoluminescence spectra of the free ligand and CPs 1–3, dispersed in methanol, were evaluated under ambient conditions (Fig. 6). The isostructural 1–3 compounds exhibited different fluorescence properties. The free ligand (INO) displayed broad emission centered at 434 nm (λex = 370 nm). The emission bands of the free ligand can most likely be related to the intraligand n → π* and/or π → π* transitions. For the CPs, there are emission bands at 479 nm (λex = 310 nm) for SC 1 (SC = single crystal), 479 nm (λex = 350 nm) for NS 1 (NS = nanostructure), 478 nm (λex = 360 nm) for SC 2, 480 nm (λex = 350 nm) for NS 2, 352 nm (λex = 320 nm) for SC 3, and 351 nm (λex = 300 nm) for NS 3, respectively. In all of the CPs, the fluorescence intensities of 1–3 that are synthesized under ultrasonic irradiation are evidently stronger than those of the CPs prepared by the branched-tube method. This can be attributed to the smaller particle size in the nanometer range. The energy and intensity of the photoluminescence peaks depend on the central metal, the ligands and the structure of the complexes. The observed differences in the photoluminescence spectra of these three compounds are due to different halogen atoms. The emission behaviors of compounds 1 and 2 are the same, which can most probably be ascribed to similar polarizations of chloride and bromide anions.61 The photoluminescence peaks of CPs 1 and 2 are clearly red-shifted, featuring an LMCT (ligand-to-metal charge transfer) character from the ligand to Pb2+.62 The distinct behaviour of compound 3 can be attributed to its bigger size and lower electronegativity.63 An evident blue shift has been observed in compound 3 which could be assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT).64–67

Experimental
Chemicals and measurements
The FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded on an IS10 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet). TGA experiment was performed on a PL-STA 1500 instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The PXRD data were obtained on a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Philips). The morphologies of the samples were observed on a ZEISS FE-SEM. The fluorescence excitation/emission spectra of compounds 1–3 were obtained using an LS55 fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer).
Preparation of 1–3 single crystals
All three single crystals were synthesized via a branched-tube approach to obtain Pb(OAc)2·3H2O solid salt (0.104 mg, 0.75 mmol), in which OAc = acetate was poured into a tube then a methanol:water (1:3) solution containing INO (0.284 mg, 0.75 mmol) and 0.75 mmol potassium halide salts (KCl, KBr and KI for compounds 1, 2 and 3, respectively) was added slowly up to a sufficient volume for filling the tube and its arm.
Finally, the tube outlet was tightly closed and the end of tube up to its lateral branch was placed into a hot oil bath with the temperature of 60 °C. Yellow block crystals were obtained in the branched arm after one week and washed. The peak assignments of the FT-IR spectra and elemental analysis results of the 1–3 single crystals are reported in the ESI.†
Preparation of 1–3 nanoplates
Compounds 1–3 were produced by the ultrasonic approach at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. A lead(II) acetate trihydrate solution of 0.05 M concentration in MeOH:water (1:3) was immersed in an ultrasonic bath of 12 W power. A 0.05 M solution of INO and metal halide salt in MeOH:water (1:3) was added dropwise to the lead(II) solution under ultrasonic irradiation for 30 min and a yellow precipitate appeared after 10 min. The resulting yellow powder was centrifuged and washed with acetone.
Reversible crystal-to-crystal (CTC) transformations (1 to 2 and to 3) by the mechanochemical method
Compounds 1, 2 and 3 can be converted to each other by grinding 1 mmol of each compound with 1 mmol of corresponding metal halide salts through a liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) method. These transformations required a few drops of water to proceed. An agate pestle and mortar set was used for grinding. The resulting powders were washed 3 times with a small amount of water and then dried in air at room temperature. All the transformations were investigated in both directions. Scheme 1 presents the synthetic methods.

Determination of crystal structures
Single crystal diffraction measurements were done by using an APEX-II CCD diffractometer (Bruker) with a Mo-Kα radiation source for the intensity data collection at 293 K. The crystal structure refinements were carried out by direct methods and using the full-matrix least-squares technique on F2 and accomplished by the SHELXL-2014 program package.68,69 Then, the Mercury software was used for the preparation of molecular structure plots. Table 2 summarizes the refinement data of the crystals. A selected list of bond angles and lengths is also reported in ESI,† Table S1.

Fluorescence studies
The fluorescence measurements for 1–3 in bulk and nanoscale were carried out in methanol. 1 mg of each CP was ground and immersed in 3 ml methanol and then tested in emission mode.
Conclusions
In summary, three lead(II) CPs were synthesized through two methods, namely branched-tube and ultrasonic irradiation. Their single crystals were obtained by the brunched-tube method and were structurally characterized. Their nanoplates were prepared under ultrasonic irradiation. The single crystals and nanostructures were synthesized within a week and 30 minutes, respectively. All of the three compounds are isostructural and are only different in terms of bond lengths and angles. These structures showed reversible structural transformations induced by a mechanochemical process. Despite their similar structures, the compounds exhibit different thermal behaviors and fluorescence properties, which can may be related to the effect of the different halides. The chlorinated and brominated CPs exhibited similar emission behaviors due to their similar polarization while the iodized CP was different owing to its greater size and lower electronegativity. This interesting observation prompts us to further evaluate such compounds that possess the same structures but with different properties.
