    , Accepted 23rd January 2020First published on 23rd January 2020AbstractHigh-ionic-conductivity solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have been extensively explored for electrochemical energy storage technologies because these materials can enhance the safety of solid-state energy storage devices (SSESDs) and increase the energy density of these devices. In this review, an overview of SSEs based on their classification, including inorganic ceramics, organic solid polymers, and organic/inorganic hybrid materials, is outlined. Related challenges, such as low ionic conductivity, high interfacial resistance between electrodes and SSEs, poor wettability, and low thermal stability, are discussed. In particular, recent advances in properties of SSEs and interface design of high-performance SSESDs are highlighted. Several interface designs, including hybrid, interlayer, solid–liquid, quasi-solid-state gel, and in situ solidification interface, between electrodes and SSEs for alleviating interfacial resistance, stability, and compatibility in SSESDs are comprehensively reviewed to provide insights into the future design directions of SSEs and SSESDs. The rational designs of various SSESDs for flexible and wearable devices, electronic devices, electric vehicles, and smart grid systems are proposed in accordance with different practical application requirements.

1 Introduction
Available commercial energy storage systems, such as lead acid batteries, nickel metal hydride batteries, and lithium-ion batteries, cannot satisfy the increasing energy demands of electronic devices, electric vehicles (EVs), and smart grid systems.1–3 Combustible organic liquid electrolytes have been widely used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, thereby offering the benefits of high conductivity and wetting of electrode surfaces for good electrochemical performance and long cycle life.4–6 However, liquid electrolytes often suffer from inadequate electrochemical and thermal stabilities, low ion selectivity, poor safety, and even fire hazards during overcharge or abused operations.7 For these reasons, energy storage devices with high energy and power densities, long cycle life, and acceptable safety levels at an affordable cost should be developed. These problems may be effectively solved by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs).1
As early as the 1830s, Faraday discovered that heated Ag2S and PbF2 show remarkable conduction properties, thereby leading to the research and development of SSEs.1 A variety of SSEs have been developed, and satisfactory results have been obtained in solid-state energy storage devices (SSESDs). Li et al.8 suggested that all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries in which flammable liquid electrolytes are replaced with SSEs are ultimate solutions for the safety issues of lithium-ion battery technologies, even under extreme conditions, such as high temperature or violent crush. Various research interests are directed toward the development of all-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries because of the improvement of safety by using nonflammable inorganic SSEs.9,10 Research on SSEs has spread to the whole energy storage field, including lithium-ion batteries,8,11 metal batteries,12,13 and flexible energy storage devices.14,15 With the development of SSEs, a series of review papers have been published. In 2017, Manthiram et al.1 studied lithium-ion battery chemistries and discussed major issues, such as achieving acceptable ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and mechanical properties of SSEs and compatible electrolyte/electrode interfaces. In 2018, Zhang et al.16 reviewed the mechanisms and properties of ion transport in inorganic SSEs and helped elucidate the ionic conductivity and stability of inorganic SSEs. However, a comprehensive review on references for SSE selections and interface design requirements for high-performance SSESDs for particular applications, including flexible and wearable devices, electronic devices, EVs, and smart grid systems, has yet to be conducted.
In this review, research significance and challenges of SSEs are presented. The selections and interface designs of SSEs are reviewed to provide insights into the development of SSEs and SSESDs (Fig. 1). The development of high-performance SSESDs for various applications is also proposed.

2 Benefits of SSEs
SSEs have two important roles in energy storage devices: (1) separating positive and negative electrodes to prevent internal short circuit and (2) providing a channel for ion transmission between electrodes during charge–discharge processes. The improvement of safety, suppression of metal dendrite, and fabrication of flexible and wearable devices can be achieved by replacing liquid electrolytes with SSEs.
2.1 Safety improvement
Safety is a vital requirement for all technologies and product applications. Liquid electrolytes offer high conductivity and good wetting for energy storage devices.4–6 However, liquid electrolytes possess potential hazards, such as leakage, corrosiveness, and fire risks,7 thereby threatening the safety of users and devices.
Chi et al.17 prepared an inorganic SSE NaPS4 for all-solid-state Na-ion batteries, thereby eliminating leakage problems and improving the thermal stability of devices. Zhang et al.22 utilized an organic SSE poly(propylene carbonate) to fabricate a solid polymer lithium-ion battery that can be charged and discharged at 120 °C. Zhu et al.23 developed a hybrid SSE Li0.33La0.557TiO3/polyethylene oxide for a stable solid-state lithium-ion battery with an electrochemical stability window (up to 5.0 V vs. Li/Li+). Wu et al.24 used a quasi-SSE polyisobutylene in lithium–oxygen batteries, thereby preventing lithium corrosion by H2O crossover from cathodes (Fig. 2a). Batteries in a humid atmosphere display a charge potential of 3.4 V and a long cycle life of 150 cycles. Perea et al.25 showed that the high thermal stability of Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cells can be achieved using a solid polymer electrolyte (polyether with LiTFSI salt) compared with the same cell with a liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate). The thermal runaway (exothermic reaction) of charged Li|liquid electrolyte|LiFePO4 cells (Fig. 2b) starts at 90 °C with a self-heat rate of 3.2 °C min−1 compared with that at 247 °C (0.11 °C min−1) for Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cells (Fig. 2c). This result confirms that the thermal stability of Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cells improves. Therefore, replacing a liquid electrolyte with a SSE is an important strategy to improve the safety of energy storage devices.

2.2 Metal dendrite suppression
Metal dendrite growths on metal anodes caused by unevenly distributed charges have seriously affected the Coulombic efficiency and safety of energy storage devices.26 An inorganic SSE separator with good mechanical strength can avoid short circuit induced by the growth of metal dendrites piercing the separator in batteries.27,28 Wang et al.29 used an inorganic SSE Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 for a lithium–sulfur battery. An internal short circuit in batteries is effectively avoided because the good mechanical strength of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 is sufficient to prevent lithium dendrite piercing. Han30 and Fu et al.31 also demonstrated that inorganic SSEs can effectively suppress lithium dendrite formation by tuning the composition of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to balance charge distribution because SSEs can control current distribution and lithium deposition.
In addition to inorganic SSEs, organic SSEs are effective routes for dendrite suppression. Yu et al.32 used a cellulose-based SSE with high nanopore and nanofiber concentrations in lithium sulfur batteries (Fig. 3a) and obtained a stable voltage plot of lithium plating/stripping for 200 h without dendrite growth (Fig. 3b). Lu et al.33 observed that lithium plating is preferentially concentrated in a thin SEI or defects to allow a high lithium ion flux in a liquid electrolyte (Fig. 3c), which triggers the growth of lithium dendrites. They designed a 3D network gel polymer electrolyte (3D-GPE: polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide) to effectively inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites in lithium metal batteries. This trait is attributed to a synergistic effect of the uniformity of SEIs and the high mechanical strength of the cross-linked structure of the 3D-GPE (Fig. 3d). This phenomenon results in an enhanced cycling stability of a Li|3D-GPE|LiFePO4 cell at 4C for 150 cycles (Fig. 3e). Li et al.34 reported a 3D fiber-network-reinforced bicontinuous hybrid SSE Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3/polyacrylonitrile with a flexible lithium ion conductive network that helps suppress dendrite growth by mechanically reinforcing the fiber network (Fig. 3f). The obtained Li|SSE|Li cell shows long-term stability and safety at 0.3 mA cm−2 for 400 h (Fig. 3g).

However, recent studies indicated that lithium metal dendrites can pierce the SSEs (e.g. Li7La3Zr2O12) causing the short circuit of the cell.35 Sudo et al.36 reported that the Li|SSE|Li cell with a 0.5 wt% Al2O3-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 SSE showed a short circuit after 1000 s polarization at 0.5 mA cm−2. Such short circuit was due to lithium dendrite formation, which was evidenced by the surface morphology change of the SSE after polarization at 0.5 mA cm−2 for 0 s (Fig. 3h), 280 s (Fig. 3i) and 840 s (Fig. 3j). Several black spots were observed after 280 s of polarization and the diameter of these black spots increased with polarization time (840 s), which are attributed to the lithium dendrite growth through the grain boundaries and voids in the SSE, suggesting that the lithium dendrite can pierce the SSEs. Therefore, the selection of suitable SSEs (such as inorganic SSEs with high ionic conductivity) is very important and the mechanical strength of SSEs needs to be further improved.
2.3 Flexible and wearable device fabrication
In daily life, no one can even imagine a world without portable/wearable electronic devices, including mobile phones, laptops, cameras, smartwatch, and activity trackers, which have considerably changed our lifestyles and brought significant convenience to people.37 Particularly, the emergence of flexible and wearable electronics has triggered continuous research on the development of reliable, flexible, and inexpensive SSEs, such as organic SSEs and hybrid SSEs, while inorganic SSEs were seldomly used in flexible and wearable devices because of their higher hardness and brittleness.
Zhao et al.38 designed a flexible hydrogel SSE composed of bacterial cellulose microfibers and polyvinyl alcohol with an ionic conductivity of 80.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 for flexible solid-state zinc–air batteries that are cycled well at any bending angle (9 cycles, for 40 min per cycle). Shu et al.39 reported a flexible quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) for lithium–oxygen batteries. Holes can be punched through flexible lithium–oxygen batteries that can even be cut into any desired shape, thereby demonstrating exceptional safety.
As illustrated in Fig. 4a, Li et al.40 designed a hierarchical polymer electrolyte (HPE, gelatin, and polyacrylamide) for safe and wearable solid-state zinc-ion batteries with an areal energy density of 6.18 mW h cm−2, a power density of 148.2 mW cm−2, and a capacity of ∼120 mA h g−1, with a retention of 97% after 1000 cycles at 2772 mA g−1. Park et al.41 used a free standing gel electrolyte (gelatin) with an ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 in an all-solid-state cable-type flexible zinc–air batteries (Fig. 4b). They achieved a stable discharge at 0.1 mA cm−2 under external strain loaded on the battery every 20 min from the initial length of 7–3 cm (compression). Chen et al.42 used a polyacrylamide hydrogel as an electrolyte in a flexible solid-state zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor that is flexible enough to sustain various deformations, including squeezing, twisting, and folding (Fig. 4c). Liu et al.43 used a gel-type SSE polyvinyl alcohol-LiNO3 in a flexible lithium-ion battery and demonstrated the flexibility to sustain various deformations, including bending, squeezing, twisting, and folding, because of its solid-state design. Flexible batteries can also be tailored into any desired shape and even be punched with holes, thereby exhibiting excellent safety (Fig. 4d).

With the development of SSESDs, some SSE-related challenges, such as low ionic conductivity and high interfacial resistance, have emerged as the main bottleneck restricting SSE applications at the current stage.
3 Challenges
A good electrochemical energy storage device needs an external circuit with good electronic conductivity and an internal circuit with good ionic conductivity.44,45 Good electronic conductivity is primarily dependent on the electrode design of an energy storage device,2,5,6,46 but this trait is not discussed here. Ionic conductivity is primarily dependent on the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and the interfacial resistance between electrolytes and electrodes in devices47,48 that can affect the electrochemical performance of SSESDs (Fig. 5).49,50 The discharge specific capacity, high C rate performance, and power density of SSESDs are greatly reduced by the sluggish kinetics of ion transport.51–53 A high-performance energy storage device requires a balance between electron and ion transport. A poor ion transport exacerbates the electrochemical performance of devices and reduces their energy efficiency.54,55 Any imbalance in electron and ion transport can lead to non-uniformly distributed charge on the surface of electrodes, resulting in a series of side reactions, especially dendrite growth, on the surface of metal electrodes.2,26,56 Poor interfacial contact between the electrolyte and electrodes increases the interfacial resistance, thereby reducing the bulk energy density of the device.57–61 Finding suitable SSEs and reducing the interfacial resistance are important for the development of high-performance SSESDs.

 Fig. 6  The feature comparison of inorganic, organic and hybrid SSEs. 
4.1 Inorganic SSEs, including garnet, perovskite, argyrodite, and phosphate types
Typically, inorganic SSEs, which are a kind of ion conductors, rely on the concentration and distribution of defects.124,125 Ionic transport in inorganic SSEs starts when ions at local sites become excited to neighboring sites and collectively diffuse on a macroscopic scale.126 Some materials with a crystalline framework composed of immobile ions and a sublattice of mobile species can achieve high ionic conductivities without a high defect concentration.127–130 Three primary criteria must be fulfilled to achieve fast ionic conduction in inorganic SSEs:1 (1) the number of equivalent (or nearly equivalent) sites available for mobile ions to occupy should be much larger than the number of mobile species; (2) the migration barrier energies between adjacent available sites should be low enough for an ion to hop easily from one site to another; and (3) these available sites must be connected to form a continuous diffusion pathway.

4.1.1 Garnet-type SSEs. 
Garnet-type SSEs have been widely explored because of their high ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1, environmental stability, and electrochemical stability window of 0–9 V.131–133 These SSEs are a kind of lithium transition metal oxide, whose lithium ion transport relies on their lattice defects, and element doping is beneficial to the improvement of lithium ionic conductivity. Awaka et al.62 synthesized a garnet-type SSE Li7La3Zr2O12 with tetragonal symmetry (I41/acd, no. 142) via a flux method. Tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 has lattice constants of a = 13.134(4) Å and c = 12.663(8) Å and fully ordered arrangement of lithium atoms (Fig. 7a), thereby delivering a lithium ionic conductivity of 1.63 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 26.85 °C (Fig. 7b). To improve the ionic conductivity, Kammampata et al.63 prepared some garnet-type SSEs Li6.5La2.5A0.5TaZrO12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) and found that Sr-doped garnet-type Li6.5La2.5Sr0.5TaZrO12 shows the highest lithium ionic conductivity of 3.08 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Fig. 7c). Shao et al.64 developed a garnet-type SSE Li5.9Al0.2La3Zr1.75W0.25O12 whose Li (24d) and Zr (16a) sites are doped with Al and W, and the lithium ion transport route is 24d-96h-48g-96h-24d, leading to an ionic conductivity of 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Fig. 7d). Al and W co-doping significantly leads to an improved ionic conductivity of 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature (Fig. 7e). Fig. 7f displays a polished ceramic pellet and reveals the morphological characteristics of the local environment and a surface roughness of ∼500 nm.

(g) Garnet structure of La3Zr2Li7−3xGax□2xO12, where blue circles are Zr in octahedral (Oh) coordination; dark red circles are La in dodecahedral coordination; gray circles are Li in Oh coordination; turquoise blue and green circles are Li and Ga in tetrahedral (Td) coordination, respectively; and arrows represent vacancies (□; reproduced from ref. 67 with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
Murugan et al.65 increased the lithium ionic conductivity of Li7La3Zr2O12 with the partial substitution of trivalent Y for a tetravalent Zr. A small amount (3 at%) of Y for Zr helps increase the ionic conductivity to 9.56 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Deviannapoorani et al.66 studied lithium ionic transport in Li7−2xLa3Zr2−xTexO12 (x = 0.125 and 0.25) and found that Li6.5La3Zr1.75Te0.25O12 sintered at 1100 °C exhibits a high lithium ionic conductivity of 1.02 × 10−3 S cm−1. Bernuy-Lopez et al.67 utilized Ga to replace Li, creating Li vacancies and enhancing the lithium ionic conductivity from 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 to 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1. Ga atoms located in tetrahedral positions promote the random distribution of lithium over the available sites (Fig. 7g), thereby promoting an increase in lithium ionic conductivity (1.3 and 2.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 24 °C and 42 °C, respectively).
The ionic conductivity of garnet-type SSEs continuously increases with the regulation of their crystal defects and reaches its limit.134–136 Pfenninger et al.137 used a garnet-type SSE Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 in Li4Ti5O12|SSE|Li cells and obtained a capacity of ∼175 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 90% at 2.5 mA g−1 after 22 cycles. However, to date, the development of high-performance SSESDs with garnet-type SSEs has minimal success because of the high solid–solid interfacial resistance between garnet-type SSEs and electrode materials.129,138,139 Future garnet-type SSE development will focus on interfacial designs between SSEs and electrodes.


4.1.2 Perovskite-type SSEs. 
Perovskite-type SSEs exhibit considerable potential for the development of SSESDs because of their ionic conductivity of nearly 1 × 10−3 S cm−1, potential window of 0–10.0 V, and excellent thermal/chemical stability.140–142 A perovskite-type SSE usually refers to a metal oxide whose molecular formula is ABO3 (A, B = metal, O = oxygen). SSEs are obtained through the replacement of a transition metal with lithium or sodium. Doping transition metals in SSEs can further improve their ionic conductivity. Hu et al.69 prepared a perovskite-type SSE Li0.33La0.56TiO3 with a lithium ionic conductivity of 1.7 × 10−6 S cm−1 by replacing La with Li (Fig. 8a). After Ge-doping, they found that Li0.43La0.56Ti0.95Ge0.05O3 exhibits a lithium ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 attributed to its improvement of the densification and structural integrity. In addition to doping transition metals, anionic replacement can improve the ionic conductivity of perovskite-type SSEs. Li et al.70 synthesized Li0.38Sr0.44Ta0.7Hf0.3O2.95F0.05 through F-doping and obtained a lithium ionic conductivity of 4.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C (Fig. 8b). Wu et al.143 utilized 3D- and 2D-perovskites to modify garnet-type SSE Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12. A Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cell exhibits specific capacities of 153 and 149 mA h g−1 for cells with 3D- and 2D-perovskites after 50 cycles at 0.2C, respectively. This result suggests an alternative path to increase battery capacity for SSESD development.

O and Cl ions are given in red and silver, respectively (reproduced from ref. 147 with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
Amores et al.73 developed a sodium (Na)-rich perovskite-type SSE Na1.5La1.5TeO6 with a monoclinic P21/n space group and sodium ions on A and B sites (Fig. 8c). They achieved a macroscopic ionic conductivity on the order of 10−8 S cm−1, which is the microscopic diffusion coefficient of sodium ions in the order of 10−2 cm2 s−1 (Fig. 8d). Zhao et al.74 synthesized a perovskite-type SSE Na0.33La0.55ZrO3 with a sodium ionic conductivity of 6.89 × 10−7 S cm−1. Increasing the amount of Sr doping to 33 at% in Na1/3La1/3Sr1/3ZrO3 can increase the lattice parameter and densification of SSE and contribute to an enhanced ionic conductivity from 6.89 × 10−7 S cm−1 to 1.025 × 10−5 S cm−1.
Li- and Na-rich anti-perovskites have been widely explored as high-performance SSEs for applications in SSESDs because of their high structural tolerance and good formability.144–146 An anti-perovskite-type SSE usually refers to a metal oxide whose molecular formula is A3OX (A = metal, O = oxygen, X = halogen). Li et al.68 studied lithium-rich anti-perovskite-type SSE Li3OX (X = Cl, Br) for lithium-ion batteries and obtained an ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−5 S cm−1. The bulk and grain boundary (GB) conductivities calculated from the equivalent circuit fitting are 1.02 × 10−5 and 1.09 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. Zhao et al.72 presented a dihalogen anti-perovskite SSE Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 (Fig. 8e) to increase the ionic conductivity of lithium to 1.94 × 10−3 S cm−1 (Fig. 8f) by introducing lithium ionic transport channels via doping and depletion. Dawson et al.147 examined the defect chemistry and ionic transport in anti-perovskite-type SSE Li3OCl and Na3OCl and observed that alkali–halide Schottky defect pairs are the dominant type of intrinsic disorder in these materials. Fig. 8g and h show the Li- and Na-ion diffusion density maps for Li3OCl and Na3OCl with an alkali–halide partial Schottky defect concentration of δ = 0.038 at 426.85 °C. Chen et al.148 reported four symmetric tilt (Σ3 and Σ5) GB effects on structural characteristics and ion transport in anti-perovskite-type SSE Li3OCl. They confirmed that Σ5 GB structures are softer and have a higher ionic conductivity than Σ3 GBs. This result provides new insights into the possible effect of GB types on the softness and ionic conductivity of SSEs. However, large solid–solid interfacial resistance between perovskite SSEs and electrode materials is still a remarkable challenge that hinders the development of high-performance SSESDs.140


4.1.3 Argyrodite-type SSEs. 
Argyrodite-type SSEs, also known as LISICON-type SSEs,79 have attracted considerable interest because of their high ionic conductivity of up to 25 × 10−3 S cm−1.149,150,151–155 Liu et al.156 synthesized an argyrodite-type SSE β-Li3PS4 based on Li2S and P2S5 and achieved a lithium ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1. This material has prompted researchers to further explore this field. Subsequent developments include Li7P2S8I (6.3 × 10−4 S cm−1),157 0.4LiI–0.6Li4SnS4 (4.1 × 10−4 S cm−1),158 Na3SbS4 (2.0 × 10−4 S cm−1),159 and Li7P3S11 (1.5 × 10−3 S cm−1).160 Among various potential SSE candidates (e.g., garnet and perovskite) for SSESDs, argyrodite-type SSEs are the most competitive because of their practicability and promising electrochemical performance.161
Considerable efforts have been devoted to optimizing the ionic conduction pathway to obtain argyrodite-type SSEs with a high ionic conductivity. Zhang et al.77 studied halogen-doped Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) and showed that Li6PS5Cl possesses the highest ionic conductivity of 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 because of good lithium ion channels. Zhou et al.78 tuned the chlorine content (Li6−yPS5−yCl1+y, y = 0.5) and improved the lithium ionic conductivity to 3.9 mS cm−1. Kamaya et al.80 doped Ge in an argyrodite-type SSE to form Li10GeP2S12 with a 1D lithium conduction pathway along the c-axis composed of (Ge0.5P0.5)S4 tetrahedra and LiS6 octahedra (Fig. 9a) and obtained a high lithium ionic conductivity of 12 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature (Fig. 9b). Kraft et al.81 explored the influence of aliovalent substitution in argyrodite-type SSE Li6+xP1−xGexS5I (Fig. 9c). After Ge content increases to 25 at%, an anion site disorder is induced, and the activation barrier for ionic motion drops remarkably, leading to ionic conductivities of 5.4 ± 0.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 in a cold-pressed state and 18.4 ± 2.7 × 10−3 S cm−1 upon sintering at 550 °C (Fig. 9d).

(e) Sodium ion probability density isosurface (yellow) obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) studies at 1050 K for 40 ps. Sodium diffusion along the c-axis involves a pathway along the –Na(4)–Na(1)–Na(3)–Na(1)– chains; the sodium ion probability density obtained from the AIMD sodium ion trajectories in the ab plane shows the pathways at z = 0.125 and z = 0.25 (reproduced from ref. 82 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry). (f) Crystal structure of Na10.8Sn1.9PS11.8 and different views of a single crystal; white in the sodium sphere indicates the ratio of vacancies (reproduced from ref. 84 with permission from Elsevier). 
Zhang et al.82 reported an argyrodite-type SSE Na11Sn2PS12 (sodium ionic conductivity of 1.4 × 10−4 S cm−1) with sodium ion conduction pathways that flow through equienergetic sodium sulfur octahedra interconnected by partial vacancy crossover sites in all crystallographic dimensions. They provided insights into the underlying isotropic 3D fast-ion conduction (Fig. 9e). Ramos et al.83 synthesized argyrodite-type SSE Na11Sn2SbS12 by replacing P with Sb. Na11Sn2SbS12 possesses the same structural framework as Na11Sn2PS12, while sodium ions transport through similar 3D pathways, thereby exhibiting an enhanced sodium ionic conductivity of 0.56 mS cm−1. Yu et al.84 fabricated argyrodite-type SSE Na10.8Sn1.9PS11.8 by adjusting the element ratio. They obtained a large number of intrinsic sodium vacancies and 3D sodium ionic conduction pathways (Fig. 9f) and a high ionic conductivity of 6.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Duchardt et al.85 presented an argyrodite-type SSE Na11Sn2PS12, which possesses a sodium ionic conductivity close to 4 × 10−3 S cm−1. These studies have emphasized the importance of vacancies, which interconnect ion migration pathways in a 3D manner to improve SSE conductivity.
Although argyrodite-type SSEs usually possess a higher conductivity than their oxide counterparts, the former are unstable against moisture and tend to produce toxic H2S gas.94 Zhu et al.76 designed a new kind of argyrodite-type SSE Li–B–H with an ionic conductivity of 2.7 × 10−4 S cm−1. LiH and [Li2B12H11+1/n]n are formed in a LiBH4 matrix in situ, and an interface layer between [Li2B12H11+1/n]n and LiBH4 is responsible for a high ionic conductivity. Future research will focus on increasing the ionic conductivity of argyrodite-type SSEs without sulfur and developing novel argyrodite-type SSEs.


4.1.4 Phosphate-type SSEs. 
The importance of exploring new SSEs for SSESDs has led to significant interest in phosphate-type materials because of their high ionic conductivities and low GB resistance.95,162 Phosphate-type SSEs, also known as NASICON-type SSEs, are formed by linking phosphorus oxide tetrahedron and metal oxygen octahedron. Ramar et al.87 prepared phosphate-type SSE Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 with a lithium ionic conductivity of 7.2 × 10−5 S cm−1. Yan et al.89 reported a microwave sintering method to produce phosphate-type SSE Li1.5Al0.4Ga0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 that has a lithium ionic conductivity of 6.67 × 10−4 S cm−1.
Phosphate-type SSEs with new compositions and crystal structures should be developed to achieve high ionic conductivities.163–165 Liang et al.86 synthesized phosphate-type SSE LiTi2(PO4)3 that has a lithium ionic conductivity of 2.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 and is made of a 3D framework of TiO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra (Fig. 10a), thereby providing channels for lithium ion transport.166 Yi et al.88 synthesized Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 powder via a sol–gel route and sintered the powder at 1000 °C for 6 h to produce phosphate-type SSE Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, which shows a high lithium ionic conductivity of 4.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 because of an increase in the grain size and density of the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramic (Fig. 10b).

(e) Crystal structure of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 consisting of a framework of (Nb,Zr)O6 octahedra sharing corners with PO4 tetrahedra. (f) Initial discharge–charge profiles of a solid-state Al|SSE|V2O5 nanorod/rGO cell at 2 mA g−1 at 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively; reproduced from ref. 167 with permission from the Chinese Physical Society and IOP. 
Deng et al.92 studied Sc-substituted phosphate-type SSEs Na3ScxZr2−x(SiO4)2−x(PO4)1+x and Na2ScyZr2−y(SiO4)1−y(PO4)2+y (x, y = 0–1). The conduction pathways of Na+ are plotted via three different approaches (Fig. 10c). (i) Molecular dynamics (MD) density plots of sodium ion reveal the migration pathways and lattice regions that are most frequently traversed by mobile Na ions. (ii) Bond valence energy landscapes (BVELs) obtained via the bond valence sum method require a crystal structure as an input and can probe possible ion diffusion pathways with minimal computational cost. (iii) Maximum entropy method (MEM)/Rietveld analysis involves scattering densities by giving the maximum variance of the calculated structure factors within the standard deviations of the observed ones. Sodium ion diffusion in SSEs is 3D, and a continuous exchange of sodium ions between Na(1) and Na(2) sites is present. Na3Sc0.25Zr1.75(SiO4)1.75(PO4)1.25 shows a sodium ionic conductivity of about 0.1 S cm−1 (Fig. 10d). Kehne et al.95 reported Sc-substituted phosphate-type SSE Na3Zr2(SiO4)2(PO4) with a sodium ionic conductivity of 4 × 10−3 S cm−1 for Na|SSE|NaxCoO2 cells, which show a specific capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at 6.0 C for 100 cycles.
Wang et al.167 investigated the diffusion pathway of aluminum ions in phosphate-type SSE (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 for rechargeable solid-state aluminum-ion batteries. (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 has a rhombohedral structure consisting of a framework of (Zr,Nb)O6 octahedra that share corners with (PO4) tetrahedra. Aluminium ions occupy trigonal antiprisms, thereby exhibiting extremely large displacement factors. Wang et al.167 suggested a strong displacement of aluminum ions along the c-axis of a unit cell as they diffuse across the structure via a vacancy mechanism (Fig. 10e). An Al|SSE|V2O5 nanorod/rGO cell presents initial discharge capacities of 7.5 and 10 mA h g−1 at 120 °C and 150 °C from 0.01 V to 2.0 V versus Al3+/Al at 2 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 10f). This research provides a basis for studying solid-state aluminum-ion batteries.
In general, phosphate-type SSEs are prepared through sintering at high temperatures (1000 °C) for a prolonged time, which is unfavorable for industrial applications.168,169 New research should be conducted to prepare phosphate-type SSEs at low temperatures.

4.2 Organic SSEs, including gel, single polymer, blending polymer and polymer with filling types
Inorganic SSEs have interface problems and are usually prepared by high-temperature calcination. By contrast, organic SSEs, such as gel, single polymer, blending polymer and polymer with filling types, attract considerable interest because of their simple polymerization process at room temperature and good interface contact.

4.2.1 Gel-type SSEs. 
Gel-type SSEs have been widely explored for flexible solid-state supercapacitors and other aqueous solid-state batteries.170 A good gel-type SSE usually requires a combination of a high ion migration rate, a reasonable mechanical strength, and a robust water retention ability in the solid state to ensure excellent durability.171 Łatoszynska et al.96 prepared a mechanically stable nonaqueous proton-conducting gel-type SSE based on methacrylate monomers and diphenyl phosphate. The use of phosphoric acid ester as a proton donor has led to an increase in operation voltage window (0–1.3 V) and electrolyte ionic conductivity (3.1 × 10−4 S cm−1). Chodankar et al.98 reported gel-type SSE polyvinylpyrrolidone/LiClO4 for flexible solid-state supercapacitors. A symmetric MnO2|SSE|MnO2 supercapacitor yields an operating potential window of 1.6 V and an energy density of 23 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1.9 kW kg−1. Veerasubramani et al.172 used a gel-type SSE composed of polyvinyl alcohol/H3PO4/Na2MoO4 to fabricate a flexible cable-type supercapacitor. A graphene oxide|SSE|graphene oxide supercapacitor exhibits a length capacitance and energy density of 18.75 mF cm−1 and 2.6 mW h cm−1, respectively. Su et al.173 used an aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone-based gel-type SSE to assemble a Zn|SSE|FeCo–N–C cell and demonstrated a good charging–discharging performance, a long lifetime (12 h), and a high flexibility. Luo et al.174 designed a gel-type SSE by utilizing tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate, and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propanon for lithium–oxygen batteries (Li|SSE|reduced graphene oxide@RuOx) that display a voltage of higher than 2.2 V after 140 cycles at 0.4 mA cm−2, with a capacity of 1000 mA h g−1.
Chodankar et al.175 reported that the water contact angles of polyvinyl alcohol (Fig. 11a(A)), hydroxymethyl cellulose (Fig. 11a(B)), and polyethylene oxide (Fig. 11a(C)) gel electrolytes are 10°, 36.8°, and 63.3°, respectively. This result indicates that polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolytes possess a hydrophilic nature. Thus, a gel-type SSE composed of polyvinyl alcohol/LiClO4 has a hydrophilic nature and a good contact with active electrode materials. This trait is beneficial to the electrochemical performance of energy storage devices. Peng et al.99 reported zwitterionic gel-type SSE polypropylsulfonate dimethylammonium propylmethacrylamide (PPDP)/LiCl with the synergic advantages of robust water retention ability and ion migration channels, thereby manifesting a superior electrochemical performance. As illustrated in Fig. 11b, PPDP possesses a positively charged quaternary ammonium group and a negatively charged sulfonate group on the same monomeric unit. Given the strong electrostatic interactions between charged groups and water molecules, PPDP is highly hydrated by the surrounding water molecules with a robust water retention ability. An ion migration channel can be developed within a hydration layer along PPDP chains between two electrodes by applying an external electric field because of the robust water retention ability of PPDP gel electrolytes. Supercapacitors with PPDP gel electrolytes yield specific capacitances of 300.8, 298.2, 292.4, 279.6, 270.4, and 256.0 F cm−3 at current densities of 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 20 A cm−3 in a solid state, respectively. These values are larger than those of supercapacitors with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolytes (Fig. 11c). Pandey et al.97 designed a flexible, free-standing, thermostable gel-type SSE based on plastic crystalline succinonitrile (SN) and ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate entrapped in poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene). The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of gel SSEs leads to ionic conductivities ranging from ∼0.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at −30 °C to ∼15 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 80 °C (Fig. 11d). Thermal studies have confirmed that IL-SN-gel SSEs remain stable in the same gel phase within a wide temperature range of −30 °C to 90 °C (Fig. 11e). Xia et al.176 reported a gel-type SSE based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) for solid-state lithium–sulfur (Li|SSE|sulfur) batteries. Thus, these batteries present a high initial capacity of 918 mA h g−1 at 0.05C and an improved cycle performance for 40 cycles compared with those of their counterparts with liquid electrolytes because of the effective suppression of the shuttle effect of polysulfides (Fig. 11f).

Gel-type SSEs play an important role in the development of flexible SSESDs because of their high ionic conductivity and good flexibility. However, the poor mechanical properties of gel-type SSEs pose a safety hazard in dynamic applications, and the mechanical properties of gel-type SSEs should be improved on the basis of gel selection, additive addition, and solidification condition control. Embedding a conventional energy storage device separator during the solidification of a gel-type SSE is also an effective method to improve its safety. Our group214,215 also demonstrated that the solidification of gel-type SSEs on an electrode surface helps improve the electrochemical performance of devices. Our study is also a valuable reference for the assembly of high-performance flexible devices.


4.2.2 Single polymer-type SSEs. 
Dry single polymer-type SSEs have been extensively investigated because of their flexibility, wide range of operation temperature, and excellent cycle life.177 Polymer-type SSEs can effectively suppress the growth of metal dendrites and thus avoid the short circuit of batteries.178–180 Various polymers including polyethylene oxide,181 polyacrylonitrile,182 and poly(methyl methacrylate)183 have been widely studied as SSEs.
In single polymer-type SSEs, microscopic ion transport is related to the segmental motion of polymer chains above the glass transition temperature,184 thereby creating free volumes for hopping ions that coordinate with polar groups. An ion can hop from one coordinating site to another, thereby accompanying the segmental motion of polymer chains.185 In an electric field, long distance transport is realized by continuous hopping.
Zeng et al.103 designed a polymer-type SSE with an interpenetrating network of poly(ether acrylate) (ipn-PEA, Fig. 12a), thereby exhibiting high mechanical strength (ca. 12 GPa, Fig. 12b) and good ionic conductivity (2.2 × 10−4 S cm−1). A Li|ipn-PEA|LiFePO4 cell within 4.5 V vs. Li+/Li operates effectively at 5.0C (Fig. 12c). Feng et al.102 designed a polymer-type SSE based on a cyclic carbonate–cyclic ether copolymer (Fig. 12d). SSEs with a vinylene carbonate (VC)/tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate molar ratio of 5:1 and 25 wt% LiTFSI have a higher ionic conductivity of 1.58 × 10−4 S cm−1 at ambient temperature than that of poly-VC (PVCA, Fig. 12e). Cyclic carbonate segments in polymer-type SSEs provide high mechanical integrity, whereas cyclic ether groups promote the dissociation of lithium salts and the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Nag et al.104 prepared a high-ion-conducting polymer-type SSE by using organoborane-modified polybenzimidazole (B-PBI) and IL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (BMImTFSI, Fig. 12f). Electrolytes with B-PBI/BMImTFSI (wt%/wt%, 25/75) yield a conductivity of 8.8 × 10−3 S cm−1. A Si|SSE|Li cell presents a reversible capacity of up to 1300 mA h g−1. Zhao et al.186 created polymer-type SSE polyethylene oxide stabilized by the task-specific trinal salt additives of LiBOB, LiNO3, and LiTFSI (Fig. 12g). Li|SSE with a trinal salt additive|LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cell displays a capacity of 136.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, with a Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 60 cycles.

4.2.3 Blending polymer-type SSEs. 
Although the single polymer-type SSEs have been used as semicrystalline or amorphous host matrices for the preparation of organic SSEs,187–189 some issues have emerged due to the drawback of single polymers.59,107,190 For example, the crystalline phase present in the polyethylene oxide materials reduces favourable ion conductive paths and results in low ionic conductivity; the brittleness of poly(methyl methacrylate) limits the fabrication of desirable shape, size, and flexibility for SSESDs.106,191 To address these shortcomings of single polymer-type SSEs, blending polymer-type SSEs have been proposed to complement the properties between different polymers. Dhatarwal et al.106 prepared a blending polymer-type SSE of polyethylene oxide and poly(methyl methacrylate) blend (50/50 wt%) with lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) ionic salt, delivering an ionic conductivity of 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature and an electrochemical window of 0 to 4.5 V due to the combination of good properties of polyethylene oxide and poly(methyl methacrylate).
Rathika et al.108 improved the ionic conductivity of polyethylene oxide-type SSEs (2.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature) by adding 10 wt% poly(vinylidene difluoride) to 90 wt% polyethylene oxide with 15 wt% Zn(CF3SO3)2 (Fig. 13a). To improve the ionic conductivity and thermal stability of a polyethylene oxide-type SSE for LIBs, Lim et al.109 incorporated poly(methyl methacrylate) into a polyethylene oxide matrix. The blending polymer-type SSE with polyethylene oxide:poly (methyl methacrylate) = 8:1 exhibited the highest ionic conductivity of 1.35 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature (from 10−8 S cm−1) and good mechanical stability because of the high specific surface area and mesoporosity of the blending polymer-type SSE. Li et al.110 reported the diethylethyletherylmethanamine bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DEEYTFSI) ionic liquid polymer electrolyte based on a polyurethane acrylate (PUA)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) SSE. The optimized 19 wt% DEEYTFSI SSE exhibits good flexible (Fig. 13b), tensile properties (Fig. 13c), and the smallest apparent activation energy of 21.1 kJ mol−1 and the highest ionic conductivity of 2.76 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature (Fig. 13d), together with a stable electrochemical window of 4.70 V (2.3 to 7.0 V, Fig. 13e) for lithium-ion battery among the studied 15 wt% and 21 wt% DEEYTFSI SSE samples. The coin-type cell cycled at 0.1C retained 95% Coulombic efficiency on the 50th cycle, that is attributed to the combination of good properties of PUA and PMMA. Ma et al.111 prepared a blending polymer-type SSE, based on lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) (LiTFSI), polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) copolymer, achieving a high ionic conductivity of up to 4.31 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. The electrochemical performance of the blending polymer-type SSE was evaluated in a Li|SSE|LiFePO4 coin cell. Good performance with low capacity fading on charge–discharge cycling was achieved, and a high specific discharge capacity of 123 mA h g−1 along with a Coulombic efficiency of 97.1% after 100 cycles was retained. In future research, a design guideline needs to be established to blend different polymers to achieve the tailored physicochemical properties.

4.2.4 Polymer with filling-type SSEs. 
The polymer-type SSEs, with filling of TiO2,192 SiO2,193 ZrO2,194 and metal organic frameworks,112 have demonstrated to exhibit an improved electrochemical stability of the interfaces in SSESDs, superior ionic conductivity and good mechanical strength as compared to those without filling.186,195,196 Johnsi et al.115 reported that 5 wt% CeO2 nanofiller added in 75 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) and 25 wt% zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (ZnTf) organic-type SSE exhibited a zinc ionic conductivity of 3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and increased the decomposition voltage of the polymer electrolyte from 2.4 to 2.7 V, attributing to an increase in the amorphous content of the SSE.
Shi et al.114 investigated the effects of the addition of nano-sized oxide fillers (Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2) on the characteristics of the blending polymer-type SSE. Fig. 14a shows the schematic illustration of the procedure for the preparation of the organic SSE, including the processes of casting, drying, peeling and immersion, etc. An organic-type SSE with SiO2 filling results in a more amorphous region and a more porous structure, which can effectively hold the liquid electrolyte by capillary force, and then increase the absorbability of liquid electrolytes, and further facilitate the migration of cations at the electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, such nano-sized oxide filled SSEs can provide a high ionic conductivity of 1.27 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, together with enhanced electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the polymer with filling-type SSE possesses a large electrochemical window from 0 to 5.3 V and superior thermal stability up to 200 °C. Recently, Choudhury et al.197 developed a mechanically robust hybrid electrolyte composed of hairy SiO2 grafted polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide (SiO2–PEO–PPO) as shown in Fig. 14b. Such nanoparticle–polymer electrolyte exhibits simultaneously high mechanical modulus (1 MPa) and high ionic conductivity (5× 10−3 S cm−1) at ambient temperature. An Li|SiO2–PEO–PPO|LTO cell with PC/1 M LiTFSI liquid electrolyte salt exhibits prolonged short circuit time and good cycling performance at 1C (0.50mA cm−2) compared to cells with other state-of-the-art polymer electrolytes (Fig. 14c). Suriyakumar et al.112 explored an aluminium terephthalic acid metal organic framework (Al-TPA-MOF) polymer with filling-type SSE based on a polyethylene oxide (80 wt%) network with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI, 10 wt%) and Al-TPA-MOF (10 wt%). Al-TPA-MOF was synthesized by an electrolytic process and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 5 days; its structure is shown in Fig. 14d. This polymer-type SSE with filling of Al-TPA-MOF, having an ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C (Fig. 14e), is mechanically robust and thermally stable up to 270 °C. Such high ionic conductivity is attributed to the porous structure of Al-TPA-MOF that promotes a rapid ion transport. The all-solid-state lithium sulfur cell delivers a specific capacity of 800 mA h g−1, and a stable performance upon prolonged cycling (50 cycles) even at 60 °C.

4.3 Hybrid SSEs
Hybrid SSEs are emerging as a promising solution to achieving high ionic conductivity, optimal mechanical properties, and good safety for the development of high-performance SSESDs.198–201 The common polymer hosts of composite polymer electrolytes are polyethylene oxide, polyacrylonitrile, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(vinyl chloride).1 Some active materials, such as Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3202 and Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12,203 are dispersed or embedded in a polymer matrix to reinforce mechanical stability. The interaction of inorganic particles with polymer electrolytes not only increases the mechanical strength of polymers but also decreases the crystallization of polymers; thus, ionic conductivity is enhanced.204
Xu et al.205 designed a hybrid SSE by using polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, KOH, and Na2SnO3 for a fiber-shaped solid-state aluminum–air battery. The obtained hybrid SSE improves the battery's stability and safety by reducing the corrosion of the aluminum anode. An Al|SSE|Ag@carbon nanotube cell displays a specific capacity of 935 mA h g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and an energy density of 1168 W h kg−1. Zhao et al.116 reported a hybrid SSE Li10GeP2S12/polyethylene oxide for solid-state lithium batteries, displaying an electrochemical window of 0–5.7 V and a lithium ionic conductivity of 1.18 × 10−5 S cm−1. A Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cell exhibits a capacity retention of 92.5% after 50 cycles at 60 °C and capacities of 158, 148, 138, and 99 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1C, respectively. Zhang et al.177 reported a hybrid SSE Li7La3Zr2O12/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) with a lithium ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 for high-performance solid-state lithium-ion batteries. A Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cell exhibits an initial reversible discharge capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and a capacity retention of 92.5% after 180 cycles.
Bae et al.206 investigated the ion transport mechanism in 3D nanostructured hybrid SSE Li0.35La0.55TiO3/polyethylene oxide (Fig. 15a). The degree of percolation and the interphase volume decrease, and a discontinuous lithium-ion conducting path is generated by lowering the lithium-ion conductivity because of the agglomeration of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanoparticles. The enhanced conductivity of the hybrid SSE with a Li0.35La0.55TiO3 framework is attributed to a pre-percolated 3D interconnected Li0.35La0.55TiO3 network, thereby providing a continuous interphase, which serves as a pathway for lithium-ion conduction. This study provides a theoretical guidance for the design of hybrid SSEs. Chen et al.117 reported hybrid SSE Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12/polyethylene oxide with a lithium ionic conductivity of > 0.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 (Fig. 15b) and demonstrated that the hybrid SSEs of “ceramic-in-polymer” and “polymer-in-ceramic” can be applied to solid-state lithium batteries. The Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cell has a capacity of 139.1 mA h g−1, a retention of 93.6% after 100 cycles (Fig. 15c), a capacity retention of 103.6%, and a Coulombic efficiency of 100% after 50 cycles (Fig. 15d) at 0.2C and 55 °C. Wang et al.119 designed a hybrid SSE Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3/polyethylene oxide with an ionic conductivity of 1.67 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Fig. 15e) by using an ice template whose vertical Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 walls provide continuous channels for fast ionic transport, while a polyethylene oxide matrix renders the composite electrolyte flexible. The viable approach involving an ice template to fabricate hybrid SSEs with a high ionic conductivity has also been demonstrated. Liang et al.121 reported a hybrid SSE Li7La3Zr2O12/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) with an ionic conductivity of 3.71 × 10−4 S cm−1. A Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cell presents a discharge capacity of 163.1 mA h g−1, with 83.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.2C (Fig. 15f). Zhang et al.122 fabricated a hybrid SSE Li6PS5Cl/polyethylene oxide with a lithium ionic conductivity of ∼1 × 10−3 S cm−1 by adding 5 wt% polyethylene oxide into Li6PS5Cl and verified that adding a suitable polymer content in ceramic particles can effectively inhibit interfacial reactions and lithium dendrite growth, thereby considerably improving the cycling performance of solid-state lithium batteries. Therefore, Li|SSE|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells exhibit a capacity of 75.6 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 91% of >200 cycles at 0.05C. Huo et al.118 developed a sandwich-type ceramic-in-polymer electrolyte (with 20 vol% 200 nm Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 particles and polyethylene oxide) that has an ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1. A Li|SSE|LiFePO4 cell (Fig. 15g) shows a discharge capacity of 118.6 mA h g−1, with a capacity retention of 82.4% after 200 cycles at 0.1C. At 0.2 and 0.5C, this cell maintains specific capacities of 95.7 and 63.2 mA h g−1, respectively. This case points out that fabricating sandwich-type composite electrolytes with hierarchical filler designs can be an effective strategy to achieve dendrite-free batteries with high performance and high safety at room temperature.

Hybrid SSEs combine the advantages of inorganic and organic SSEs to provide a good choice for the acquisition of high-performance SSESDs. At present, studies focus on the combination and optimization of various inorganic and organic SSEs to improve the properties of hybrid SSEs. Ultrathin and lightweight hybrid SSEs with high ionic conductivity are desired to achieve energy density comparable with liquid electrolyte-based cells.181 The direct integration of an electrode with hybrid SSEs into SSESDs is an important research direction, but their chemical and electrochemical incompatibilities are still a challenge.207
5 Interfacial contact between electrodes and SSEs
In this section, we discuss SSE classifications and compare their ion conductivities. For inorganic SSEs, microstructure control, such as element doping, can significantly improve their ionic conductivity. For instance, Li7P3S11 (3.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) is modified to Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 (25 × 10−3 S cm−1) with Si and Cl dopants; LiTi2(PO4)3 (3.8 × 10−7 S cm−1) is also modified to Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (6.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) with an Al dopant.91,127,208,209 However, a crucial challenge of SSE is reducing the high interfacial resistance between electrodes and SSEs in energy storage systems, and such a high resistance is required for stable, reversible, and efficient electrochemical energy storage.210 Recent research progress in SSESDs has shown that some strategies have been proposed to tackle the interfacial resistances between electrodes and SSEs, such as hybrid interfaces, interlayer interfaces, solid–liquid interfaces, quasi-solid-state interfaces, and in situ solidification interfaces (Table 2).

5.1 Hybrid interface between electrodes and SSEs
To improve the interfacial contact and reduce the interfacial resistance of electrodes and SSEs in devices, researchers mixed electrode materials and SSE materials to form a hybrid interface sintered in an inert atmosphere. Chi et al.17 designed a hybrid interface that is a mixture of cathode Na4C6O6 and SSE Na3PS4 for a solid-state Na15Sn4|Na3PS4|Na4C6O6@Na3PS4 cell, as shown in Fig. 16a. SEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra indicate the intimate contact between cathode materials and SSEs (Fig. 16b), thereby decreasing the interfacial resistance from 343 Ω to 109 Ω because of the increased interface contact. The Na15Sn4|Na3PS4|Na4C6O6@Na3PS4 cell has a specific capacity of 184 mA h g−1, a specific energy of 395 W h kg−1, and a capacity retention of 76% after 100 cycles at 0.1C and 70% after 400 cycles at 0.2 C. Han et al.9 designed the hybrid interface of Li2S@Li6PS5Cl by dissolving Li2S (cathode material), polyvinylpyrrolidone (carbon precursor), and Li6PS5Cl (SSE) in ethanol and by conducting coprecipitation and high-temperature carbonization (Fig. 16c). Li2S cathode materials and Li6PS5Cl SSE are uniformly confined in a carbon matrix, with distinct properties of lithium storage capability, mechanical reinforcement, and ionic and electronic conductivities. The Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li2S@Li6PS5Cl cell achieves a reversible capacity of 830 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 for 60 cycles.

(e) Nyquist plots of an all-solid-state cell with untreated MoS2 and MoS2@Li7P3S11 (reproduced from ref. 211 with permission from Elsevier). 
In addition to mixing and sintering, the direct coating of SSEs on an electrode surface is an effective way to form a hybrid interface to reduce the interfacial resistance between electrodes and SSEs. Xu et al.211 uniformly coated SSE Li7P3S11, with an ionic conductivity of 2.0 × 10−3 S cm−1, on MoS2 to form a MoS2@Li7P3S11 interface (Fig. 16d) for solid-state Li|Li7P3S11|MoS2@Li7P3S11 cells that exhibit a reversible capacity of 547.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a capacity of 238.1 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles, with a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100%. Their interfacial resistance decreases from 330 to 225 Ω (Fig. 16e). Wang et al.222 also evaluated a solid-state Li|IL/MOF|LiFePO4@IL/MOF cell, which exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 145 mA h g−1 and a capacity of 132 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1C in a temperature range of −20 °C to 150 °C. The unique interfacial contact between SSEs and active electrodes due to an interfacial wettability effect of the nanoconfined guests, which create an effective 3D lithium ionic conductive network throughout the whole battery, is a key factor of the excellent performance of Li|IL/MOF|LiFePO4@IL/MOF cells.
5.2 Interlayer interface between electrodes and SSEs
Embedding a thin interlayer between electrodes and SSEs can improve the mechanical connection between them, thereby providing another strategy for reducing the interfacial resistance in devices223–225 Zhang et al.212 prepared an inorganic LiH2PO4 interlayer to circumvent the intrinsic chemical stability issues between the Li10GeP2S12 SSE and lithium anode, such as the migration of mixed ionic–electronic reactants to the inner part of Li10GeP2S12 and the kinetically sluggish reactions in an SSE/anode interface because of an increase in the connection between the lithium anode and Li10GeP2S12 SSE due to the LiH2PO4 interlayer (Fig. 17a). The optimized Li|LiH2PO4/Li10GeP2S12|LiCoO2 cell, with a reduction in the interfacial resistance from 5000 Ω to 2500 Ω (Fig. 17b), has a reversible discharge capacity of 131.1 mA h g−1 at the initial cycle and 113.7 mA h g−1 at the 500th cycle under 0.1C, with a retention of 86.7%. Hu et al.213 demonstrated that an organic cellulose polyethylene oxide interlayer can stabilize the interface of sodium/Na3SbS4 and reduce the interfacial resistance from 4000 Ω to 1000 Ω by suppressing the electron pathway of the Na3SbS4 decomposition reaction (Fig. 17c). The Na|cellulose polyethylene oxide/Na3SbS4/cellulose polyethylene oxide|Na cell shows a capacity of 102 mA h g−1 and a cycle life of 800 cycles at 0.1 mA cm−2 at 60 °C.

Zhou et al.18 fabricated an interlayer between a metal sodium and SSE Na3Zr2Si2PO12 through a heat treatment of sodium and the SSE in a cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (CPMEA, Fig. 17d), resulting in a uniform sodium-ion flux across the interface, reducing the interfacial resistance from 4000 Ω to 400 Ω, and suppressing unwanted dendrite formation. The Na|CPMEA/Na3Zr2Si2PO12/CPMEA|NaTi2(PO4)3 cell shows a stable capacity of 102 mA h g−1 for 70 cycles at 0.2C at 65 °C, with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Fan et al.226 produced a LiF interlayer between a lithium anode and a SSE Li3PS4 through IL LiFSI decomposition and deposition (Fig. 17e). The low electronic conductivity and high electrochemical stability of the LiF interlayer blocked the side reactions between lithium and Li3PS4. The Li|LiF/Li3PS4|LiCoO2 cell has a capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 0.3 mA cm−2 between 3.5 and 3.8 V, with a Coulombic efficiency of >99.8%.
5.3 Solid–liquid interface between electrodes and SSEs
The ionic conductivity of liquid electrolytes is much higher than that of SSEs. A solid–liquid interface refers to the addition of a small amount of liquid electrolytes between electrodes and SSEs, thereby serving as an effective medium for improving interface wettability and reducing interfacial resistance.227,228 Zhang et al.94 enhanced the charge transfer rate at the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and SSE Na3Zr2Si2PO12 interface through a small amount of nonflammable and nonvolatile IL (0.8 M NaPF6 salt in ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate, Fig. 18a). IL acts as a wetting agent, thereby enabling a favorable interface kinetics and reducing the interfacial resistance from 1250 Ω to 55 Ω (Fig. 18b). The Na|SSE-IL |Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibited a specific capacity of 90 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles without capacity decay at 10.0C. Oh et al.19 reported a scalable slurry fabrication protocol (Fig. 18c) to prepare IL-based polymeric binders (NBR-Li(G3)TFSI, NBR: nitrile–butadiene rubber, G3: triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, LiTFSI:lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) with SSE Li6PS5Cl, thereby eliminating undesirable side reactions or phase separation and reducing the interfacial resistance from 14.8 Ω to 10.4 Ω. The capacity of a Li-In|Li6PS5Cl-NBR-Li(G3)TFSI|LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cell (Fig. 18d) at 0.025C is 172 mA h g−1, which is higher than that of a battery without the liquid interface (131 mA h g−1). Yubuchi et al.214 synthesized SSE Li6PS5Br from a homogeneous solution via a liquid-phase technique. Fig. 18e shows the schematic of the infiltration process and the cross-sectional SEM images of the infiltrated LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes before and after pressing. Li–In|Li6PS5Br–1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate|LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 154 mA h g−1 at 0.13 mA cm−2. Yubuchi et al.215 used an infiltration technique to make a solid-state battery (carbon nanotube|Li6PS5Br–1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate|Li4Ti5O12) that yields a capacity of 163 mA h g−1, with 88% retention for 500 cycles.

(f) Schematic of ion transport and resistance contributions in cells with solid–liquid phase boundaries (reproduced from ref. 229 with permission from Nature). 
Although the addition of liquid electrolytes can reduce the interface resistance to some extent by improving the contact and wettability between electrodes and SSEs, the stability of a solid–liquid electrolyte interface is still controversial. Busche et al.229 demonstrated that the ion conduction mechanism in two additional interfaces between solid/liquid electrolytes and a resistive solid–liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI) changes from the diffusion of solvated ions in liquid electrolytes to a hopping mechanism attributed to ion transport in solid electrolytes (Fig. 18f). The interface between a fast-ion-conducting SSE and a conventional liquid electrolyte is chemically unstable and forms a resistive SLEI. Weiss et al.230 also found that a highly resistive solid–liquid electrolyte is formed between SSEs and liquid electrolytes, and this formation cannot be slowed down or suppressed during cycling.
5.4 Quasi-solid-state gel interface between electrodes and SSEs
To tackle problems in the formation of SLEI in SSESDs, researchers proposed a quasi-solid-state interface between electrodes and SSEs. This interface refers to a gel-like interface formed by an organic electrolyte between electrodes and SSEs.217 Lei et al.231 fabricated a quasi-solid-state battery by introducing a SSE polyethylene oxide with soluble LiI as a cathode material, anthraquinone as an anode, and a Nafion membrane as a separator (Fig. 19a). Solar energy can be converted and stored as chemical energy under light irradiation, which is further converted to electrical energy in the dark. The anthraquinone|SSE|LiI cell has a capacity retention of 86.3% after 30 cycles at 4 mA g−1, whereas the anthraquinone|liquid electrolyte|LiI cell shows a capacity retention of 52.0% after 19 cycles.

Sun et al.20 introduced a functional gel SSE (polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene/cellulose acetate, grafted by sodium alginate) to increase the stability of LiNi0.88Co0.09Al0.03O2. An ion-conducting layer is formed on the interface between LiNi0.88Co0.09Al0.03O2 and a SSE through a chemical interaction between transition-metal cations of a LiNi0.88Co0.09Al0.03O2 cathode and a metalophilic reticulum group in sodium alginate (Fig. 19b). Hence, the interfacial compatibility on the cathode/electrolyte interface is enhanced, and the interfacial resistance decreases from 420 Ω to 130 Ω (Fig. 19c). The Li|SSE|LiNi0.88Co0.09Al0.03O2 cell shows a capacity of 204.9 mA h g−1 at a rate of 1.0C and a high discharge capacity retention of 68.33% within 300 cycles. Zeng et al.221 fabricated a quasi-solid-state Zn–MnO2 battery by utilizing a gel SSE polyvinyl alcohol/ZnCl2/MnSO4. The Zn|polyvinyl alcohol/ZnCl2/MnSO4|MnO2 cell presents a reduced interfacial resistance of 23 Ω (from 30 Ω), a capacity of 366.6 mA h g−1 with a retention of >77.7%, and a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 300 cycles. Zhao et al.216 used a gel SSE β-phase poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in a Li|SSE|Ni foam@Co3O4 cell that achieves a smaller interfacial resistance (600 Ω) and a long cycle life (203 cycles) with a limited capacity of 0.1 mA h cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2 than the cell without a gel SSE (Li|LiClO4|Ni foam@Co3O4, 800 Ω, 165 cycles).
The formation of a quasi-solid-state interface between electrodes and SSEs depends on the type of gel SSEs that have good wettability and high plasticity. Tang et al.218 developed a quasi-solid-state Li–I battery (a MXene-based iodine cathode and a gel SSE made of NaNO3 particles dispersing in pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, Fig. 19d) that simultaneously suppresses the diffusion of I species, stabilizes the Li anode/SSE interface against dendrite growth, and reduces the interfacial resistance from 180 Ω (without gel SSE) to 82 Ω, resulting in a stable capacity of 330 mA h g−1 at 0.5C for 1000 cycles.
Cho et al.219 demonstrated a monolithic heterojunction quasi-SSEs (MH-QEs) based on thermodynamically immiscible dual phases of anodes (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether)/cathodes (ethyl methyl sulfone). Driven by the combined effects of structural uniqueness and thermodynamic immiscibility, electrode-customized MH-QEs provide an exceptional electrochemical performance that lies far beyond those accessible with conventional batteries composed of 1,3-dioxalane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolytes. A Li|ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate polymer|S cell has a capacity of 670 mA h g−1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% after 250 cycles at 0.1C because the interfacial resistance reduces from 185 Ω (liquid electrolyte) to 40 Ω (Fig. 19e). Zhou et al.220 designed a quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped Li–CO2 battery by using a gel SSE poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene). The Li|SSE|Mo2C/carbon nanotube cell achieves a charge potential of <3.4 V and an energy efficiency of 80% and can be reversibly discharged and charged for 40 cycles at 0.08 mA cm−2 with 0.08 mA h cm−2. Yang et al.232 reported a flexible quasi-solid-state microsupercapacitor based on free-standing black phosphorous thin films and gel SSE polyvinyl alcohol/H3PO4. The supercapacitor exhibits a capacity of 26.67 F cm−2 and a capacity retention of 94.3% after 50000 cycles at 500 mA cm−3.
5.5 
          In situ solidification interface between electrodes and SSEs
Although quasi-solid-state interfaces have good contact and wettability, can solve interfacial problems, and can improve the electrochemical performance of SSESDs, the poor mechanical contact properties of gel SSEs seriously affect the stability of energy storage devices. Thus, the in situ solidification of SSEs to achieve a good interfacial contact between electrodes become an effective approach in SSESD fabrication. Zhao et al.21 used cationic aluminum species that initiate the ring-opening polymerization of molecular ethers to produce polymer SSEs, thereby retaining the conformal interfacial contact with electrodes (Fig. 20a). The SSE (polymerized DOL, poly-DOL) exhibits a high ionic conductivity (1 × 10−3 S cm−1) at room temperature. The Li|poly-DOL|Li cell displays uniform lithium deposition and high lithium plating/striping efficiencies of >98% after 300 charge–discharge cycles at 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 20b) and low interfacial resistances (decreased from 6500 Ω of ex situ polymer to 230 Ω of poly-DOL, Fig. 20c). A Li|poly-DOL|LiFePO4 cell with a capacity of 95 mA h g−1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 99% for 700 cycles at 1.0C can be achieved with an in situ solidification interface (Fig. 20d). This study provides a promising direction for the in situ solidification of SSEs, thereby meeting the interfacial conductivity requirements for practical solid-state polymer batteries.

6 Perspectives on SSESDs
We provide our perspectives on the rational design of SSESDs based on SSE selections and approaches in reducing the interfacial resistance between electrodes and SSEs.
6.1 Design principle
SSEs are generally required to have a high ionic conductivity of >1 × 10−3 S cm−1. Our previous study233 showed that NASICON-type SSE Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with an ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 delivers a high discharge voltage of 2.88 V and a low voltage gap of 0.14 V at 0.1 mA cm−2 in hybrid sodium–air batteries. Quasi-solid-state interfaces exhibit a superior electrochemical performance in supercapacitors because of their good mechanical contact.234–236 These two factors are discussed here in detail, and directions for the development of SSEs and SSESDs are provided.
In SSESDs, SSEs not only separate positive and negative electrodes to prevent internal short circuit but also provide a channel for ion transmission between positive and negative electrodes. The bandgap of inorganic SSEs can be tuned by doping elements and constructing 3D ion transport channels, thereby accelerating ion transport performance in electrochemical processes. New inorganic SSEs, especially argyrodite- and phosphate-type SSEs with a high ionic conductivity, require further research. Organic SSEs with good flexibility can be the preferred electrolyte for flexible energy storage devices. However, the low ionic conductivity of polymer-type SSEs and the poor mechanical stability of gel-type SSEs remain the largest challenge hindering their applications. Hybrid SSEs formed by the combination of organic and inorganic SSEs are expected to be widely explored because of the improvement of ionic conductivity with high flexibility.
A good interfacial contact between electrodes and SSE can effectively improve the electrochemical performance in SSESDs. Our works suggested that the in situ solidification of SSEs is a promising strategy to improve the interfacial contact between electrodes and SSEs and achieve the industrialization of high-performance SSESDs.237,238
6.2 Practical applications
High-performance SSESDs have many applications, including smart grid systems, EVs, electronic devices, and flexible and wearable devices, which may require a particular method to assemble SSEs with electrodes. The proper selection of SSEs for each application is discussed below (Fig. 21).
 Fig. 21  Perspective: Design and configuration of high-performance SSESDs for practical applications. 

6.2.1 Smart grid systems. 
The application of energy storage devices in smart grid systems mainly includes backup power, energy storage from renewable energy sources, and grid frequency modulation.239 Backup powers should have excellent self-discharge performance, low cost, and high safety level.240 Typical operating conditions are a small charge/discharge current rate (0.5C) and a large depth of discharge (100%) in the application of energy storage from renewable energy sources.241 Grid frequency modulation requires that an energy storage device can be under a large charge/discharge current rate (1.0C) and a small discharge depth (45–55%).242 Therefore, smart grid systems require SSESDs with sufficient stability and suitable rate performance. An inorganic SSE with a high ionic conductivity can be the first choice to meet these requirements because of its good aging resistance and structural stability. Hybrid or interlayer interfaces between SSEs and electrodes can be used to reduce interface resistance and meet the requirements of the large current discharge for grid frequency modulation. Thus, the ionic conductivity of energy storage devices and C rate performance are improved.


6.2.2 EVs. 
The sales of EVs reached ∼0.78 million in 2017,243 and their accumulated sales are projected to reach 5 million in 2020.239 In addition to the requirements of high energy density and safety in charging and discharging, energy storage devices in EVs can achieve a high power density.244,245 Thus, a high ionic conductivity of SSEs with good mechanical strength is critically needed. Design options can be selected as follows: (1) inorganic SSEs exhibiting a high ionic conductivity and a high mechanical strength and combined with a solid–liquid interface or a quasi-solid-state interface, or (2) hybrid SSEs that can be formed via in situ solidification.


6.2.3 Electronic devices. 
SSESDs in portable electronic devices, such as cell phones and tablets, require a high ionic conductivity of SSEs for the fast charging rate of batteries.246–248 Gel SSEs with a quasi-solid-state interface and hybrid SSEs that can be formed via in situ solidification can be the choice for this application.


6.2.4 Flexible and wearable devices. 
Flexible and wearable electronic devices are often in intimate contact with the human body, thereby requiring electrolytes to have sufficient flexibility.249,250 Electrolyte leakage should be prevented even under extremely damaged conditions. In general, bracelets and watches do not require a large current discharge (0.5 A). Thus, the high ionic conductivity of SSEs may not be a major consideration.251,252 A hybrid SSE with a “ceramic-in-polymer” structure178 that can be formed via in situ solidification will be the focus of future research on flexible and wearable SSESDs.

7 Conclusion and outlook
Available commercial energy storage devices/systems cannot satisfy the increasing energy and power demands of electronic devices, EVs, and smart grid systems. Particularly, liquid electrolytes for energy storage devices suffer from inadequate electrochemical and thermal stabilities, low ion selectivity, poor safety, and even fire hazards. These problems may be efficiently resolved by replacing liquid electrolytes with SSEs. SSEs have potential for application in suppressing metal dendrite formation. However, the low ionic conductivity of SSEs and the high interface resistance between electrodes and SSEs have become the largest bottleneck that limits the developments of SSESDs. SSEs and SSESDs have been widely explored for electrochemical energy storage technologies and become new research directions because they can provide energy storage devices with enhanced safety and increased energy and power densities. In this review, various classes and features of SSEs, such as inorganic SSEs, organic SSEs, and hybrid SSEs, and interface designs in SSESDs, such as hybrid interfaces, interlayer interfaces, solid–liquid interfaces, quasi-solid-state interfaces, and in situ solidification interfaces, are comprehensively reviewed, paving the way for the development of next-generation high-performance SSESDs. SSEs with distinct characteristics can be obtained, and various interfaces in energy storage devices can be designed, providing a rich selection for the preparation of SSESDs for various applications, such as smart grid systems, EVs, electronic devices, and flexible and wearable devices.
SSESDs are promising high-safety, high-energy, and high-power devices. Hybrid SSEs and in situ solidification interfaces have been extensively investigated in the field of energy storage. Many opportunities and challenges are still present in the research of SSEs. Additional efforts are needed to further improve the mechanical strength and ionic conductivity of SSEs, reduce interfacial resistance through interface modification and design, and ensure the high power density and structural stability of SSESDs. SSESDs should be developed as competitive technologies for energy storage and solutions for various energy-related challenges.
