    , Accepted 23rd February 2018First published on 26th February 2018AbstractThe development of highly efficient hole transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still one of the most thrilling research subjects in the development of this emerging photovoltaic technology. Inner ring engineering of the aromatic core of new HTMs – consisting of three fused rings endowed with four triarylamine units – reveals major performance effects over the fabricated devices. In particular, substitution of the central pyrrole ring in dithienopyrrole (DTP) by a benzene ring – benzodithiophene (BDT) – allows enhancing the power conversion efficiency from 15.6% to 18.1%, in devices employing mixed-perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (MA: CH3NH3+, FA: NHCHNH3+) under 1 sun illumination. In comparison, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) yielded a power conversion efficiency of 17.7%. The novel HTM molecules show an efficient quenching of the perovskite photoluminescence, indicating an efficient charge transfer from the active layer to the HTM, along with a good conductivity (comparable to that of the spiro-OMeTAD reference). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed rationalizing the electrochemical and optical properties and predicting a reorganization energy (λ) for the best performing BDT-based HTM (0.101 eV) significantly lower than that computed for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD (0.139 eV).
1 Introduction
Among the different strategies utilized to harness solar energy, the photovoltaic (PV) approach is the only one able to directly convert Sun's light into electrical energy. The over-all PV capacity installed in 2015 was calculated to be 227.1 GW, which represents 0.6% of the global power generation.1 Virtually, all the installed PV capacity relies on silicon-based solar cells (SCs). Despite the dramatic reduction of the production costs, quality PV silicon production still represents an enormous energetic burden. The so-called emerging PV technologies (organic cells, quantum dot cells, perovskite cells, etc.) are promising future alternatives that aim to fulfill niche markets where silicon cells cannot compete, when not directly competing with conventional silicon-based SCs. Among these emerging technologies, perovskite solar cells are seriously positioning themselves as competitor candidates to silicon solar cells. No more than seven years after they were first reported by Kojima et al.,2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) already reached efficiencies exceeding 22%,3 competitive with the well-established silicon SCs, which is an unprecedented development in the field of photovoltaics.
Current research on PSCs focuses on two well-differentiated approaches, the first one being the modification of the photo-active perovskite layer. Manipulation of the perovskite's ABX3 structure by anionic and cationic substitution allows controlling its absorption properties. Modifying the size of the organic A cation has been observed to have a measurable effect on the band gap. Substitution of methylammonium (MA) by formamidinium (FA) leads to a nearly 0.1 eV gap narrowing.4 Replacement of Pb2+ by Sn2+ (cation B) has also demonstrated to substantially affect the light absorption capabilities, allowing band gaps as narrow as 1.20 eV for MASnI3.5 However, the most significant band gap manipulations have been achieved by substitution of the halide anion X. The lattice changes induced by increasing the size of the halide anion (Cl < Br < I) reduce the band gap and result in a spectral shift towards longer wavelengths.2,6 The combination of the aforementioned structural and electronic modifications in mixed compositional perovskites such as MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)(100−x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 or [FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15 has endowed perovskites with enhanced stability providing efficiencies up to 22%.3,7–9
The second major approach for PSCs concerns the synthesis and development of new and more efficient, in terms of both cost and performance, charge transporting materials. Examples of electron transporting materials (ETMs) employing azaacenes10,11 or fullerene derivatives12–14 have been reported in order to replace TiO2 as the archetype ETM. More importantly, research on hole transporting materials (HTMs) may be considered as one of the main topics of PSCs as the field is still dominated by the expensive compound 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).15,16 So far, a large number of new HTMs have been tested making use of many types of chemical structures and constituents. Nevertheless, it may be unquestionably asserted that structures exhibiting triarylamine functionalities are the most successful and repeated ones. The reason for this success lies in the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels this functionality provides, which allows efficient overlapping with the perovskite's valence band. Triarylamines have been conjugated to spiranic central cores resembling that of spiro-OMeTAD, delivering efficiencies comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD or even superior.17–20 Being aware that energy matching is not the only concurring criterion, much attention has been devoted to developing novel central cores able to promote efficient crystalline ordering. Well-ordered hole transporting layers (HTLs) allow efficient charge extraction and transport to the electrodes, and motifs that promote aggregation (aromatic surfaces for π–π stacking, sulphur heteroatoms for S⋯S interactions, etc.) have been demonstrated to be very effective.21–25
Electron rich molecules like benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienopyrrole (DTP) have been widely employed in organic photovoltaics with varying degrees of success.26–28 These two building-blocks offer structural elements, like having large π-conjugated surfaces and the presence of heteroatoms, which help promoting intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the two thiophene rings that both molecules possess have the potential of being substituted with up to four triarylamine moieties. Combined all together, these characteristics provided us with the idea of designing two new molecules for their use as HTMs in PSCs, where BDT and DTP central cores are substituted with four N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline units through the 2- and 3-positions of the thiophene rings giving rise to the tetrakistriphenylamine (TTPA) derivatives sketched in Fig. 1. The substitution of the inner core benzene ring of BDT by a pyrrole ring in DTP allows adding an extra heteroatom to the system, along with providing a stronger electron donating character. The PSCs fabricated making use of these two materials as HTLs show efficient charge transport to the electrodes which allows obtaining photocurrent conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 18%.

In order to gain a better understanding of the structural and electronic properties of the new BDT and DTP derivatives, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. Interestingly, the predicted reorganization energy for the best performing BDT-based HTM (0.101 eV) resulted to be significantly lower than that computed for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD (0.139 eV).
2 Results and discussion
2.1. Materials synthesis and properties
The synthesis of the new HTMs was carried out as shown in Scheme 1 with good yields. The molecule TTPA-DTP was obtained in a straightforward manner comprising four synthetic steps; the DTP central core was attained following a modification of the procedure reported by Wong and collaborators.29 Starting from commercially available 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene, the DTP core is obtained in moderate yield by a Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction with p-anisidine. Polybromination of the DTP core is achieved in the form of a white insoluble solid after one-pot sequential treatment with NBS at room temperature, followed by reflux after addition of bromine. The final product TTPA-DTP is accomplished by a four-fold Suzuki–Miyaura reaction with four equivalents of p-methoxy triphenylamine pinacol boronate (4). On the other hand, TTPA-BDT was prepared in two steps from commercially available dibenzothiophene, consisting of tetrabromination by treatment with excess bromine, followed by a four-fold Suzuki–Miyaura reaction with boron pinacolate 4. The structural characterization of the synthesized products was consistent with the molecular formulae of TTPA-DTP and TTPA-BDT. Full characterization and synthetic details of the products are provided in the ESI.†
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for the preparation of the heterocyclic TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP HTMs. 
To gain more insight into the structural and electronic properties of the BDT and DTP derivatives, density functional theory (DTP) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level for the TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP compounds in the presence of CH2Cl2 as solvent. Their respective cores (BDT and DTP), the pendant triarylamine (TPA) moiety, and the reference spiro-OMeTAD compound were also investigated for comparison purposes (see the ESI† for full computational details).
Fig. S1† shows the most representative bond length values calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level for the BDT and DTP cores and the TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP HTMs. The central benzene ring of the C2h-symmetry BDT core mostly preserves its delocalized structure with carbon–carbon (CC) bond distances between 1.390 and 1.427 Å. The terminal thiophene rings lose part of their typical structural pattern with alternating single and double CC bonds showing a significant difference between the terminal CC double bond (1.356 Å) and the bond fused to the benzene ring (1.427 Å). In contrast, the DTP core exhibits a clear single–double CC alternating backbone similar to that found for other related thiophene oligomers.30,31 The insertion of the TPA units to obtain TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP hardly causes any substantial change in the bond distances of the cores, with the exception of the terminal CC and carbon–sulfur bonds (Fig. S1†).

Fig. 2 shows the frontier molecular orbitals computed for the TPA unit, the BDT and DTP cores, the TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP HTMs and the spiro-OMeTAD reference compound. The topology of the HOMO of TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP clearly resembles that obtained for the corresponding cores with important contributions from the TPA moieties attached to the 2-position of the thiophene rings, especially in the case of TTPA-DTP. The HOMOs of the pristine BDT and DTP cores, calculated at −5.55 and −5.30 eV, respectively, undergo a noticeable destabilization in passing to TTPA-BDT (−4.62 eV) and TTPA-DTP (−4.51 eV) upon the insertion of the strong electron-donating TPA moieties. This enhancement of the electron-donating character brings the HOMOs of the TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP HTMs close to that calculated for the reference spiro-OMeTAD (−4.44 eV). It is important to notice that a significant charge transfer occurs from the peripheral TPA groups to the central cores, which hold a total net charge of −0.30e and −0.22e for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, respectively. The electronic structure of the TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP HTMs is therefore found to be remarkably polarized.

The electrochemical properties of the sulfur-rich TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP HTMs were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 3a). CV experiments evidence the reductive character expected from these electron-rich materials. The compound TTPA-BDT presents a quasireversible oxidation process (Eox1/2 = 0.92 V vs. NHE), which shows a subtle shoulder which is rationalized as the sequential oxidation of the two TPA moieties fully conjugated with the core (linked to the BDT through the thiophene 2- and 2′-positions), followed by the oxidation of the TPAs attached to the thiophene 3- and 3′-positions. This apparent subtlety makes the 2,2′-TPAs stronger donors due to their effective conjugation with the BDT core, in line with the HOMO computed for TTPA-BDT localized at the core and the 2,2′-TPAs. In contrast, the derivative TTPA-DTP has a much richer redox activity, showing up to four quasireversible oxidation waves (Eox1/2 = 0.54, 0.71, 0.91, and 1.20 V vs. NHE). In this case, the lower oxidation potentials are ascribed to the better electron-donating properties of the DTP core, which is expected to participate in the oxidation process. The third oxidation wave (0.95 V) seems to be more intense and probably arises from the TPA moieties attached to the DTP through thiophene 3,3′-positions, which, as for TTPA-BDT, cannot experience an effective conjugation with the core. This difference in donating strengths is reflected in the HOMO energies estimated from the oxidation potentials, obtaining −5.36 eV for TTPA-BDT and −4.98 eV for TTPA-DTP (Table 1). In comparison, spiro-OMeTAD presents a HOMO level of −5.16 eV.32 The HOMO level observed for TTPA-BDT is closer in energy to the valence band of the perovskite (ca. −5.65 eV), which enables a more efficient hole extraction, with consequences over the overall performance of the PSC devices built.

To gain a better understanding of the electrochemical properties of the HTMs studied, the oxidized species (up to the tetracation) of TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP were also investigated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in CH2Cl2. Table S1† shows the charges accumulated by the constituting fragments (central cores and TPA units) as oxidation occurs. The evolution of the charges upon oxidation indicates that for the cation species the charge is initially extracted from the TPA units (especially from those linked to the 2,2′-positions of the thiophene rings) with significant contributions from the central BDT and DTP cores. This effect is more pronounced for TTPA-DTP, for which the conjugation through the central core is more effective. Upon further oxidation (dications, trications and tetracations), the charge is gradually extracted from all the TPA units. The evolution of the charges extracted (Table S1†) evidences the most favorable electronic communication between the TPA moieties introduced in 2,2′-positions and the conjugated BDT and DTP cores. It should be noted that, for TTPA-BDT, the ionization energies (IEs) required for passing from the neutral molecule to the cation (IE1), from the cation to the dication (IE2), from the dication to the trication (IE3) and from the trication to the tetracation (IE4) are predicted to have relatively close values (4.56, 4.79, 5.09 and 5.17 eV, respectively). The difference in IE values is smaller between IE1 and IE2 (0.22 eV) and especially between IE3 and IE4 (0.08 eV). These differences explain the electrochemical behavior found for TTPA-BDT showing a unique four-electron oxidation wave with a shoulder at low potentials corresponding to the first two oxidation processes (Fig. 3a). In contrast, TTPA-DTP, which presents a stronger electron donating character with a smaller IE1 value (4.37 eV) in line with the electronic properties discussed above, exhibits a larger separation of 0.46 eV between the IE1 and IE2 (4.83 eV) energies, whereas IE3 (5.10 eV) and IE4 (5.21 eV) remain quite close at 0.11 eV. These ionization energies justify the well-separated oxidation waves, with the third one indicating a two-electron process, registered for TTPA-DTP (Fig. 3a). The fourth oxidation wave of TTPA-DTP recorded at 1.22 V should mainly correspond to the oxidation of the DTP core. Theoretical calculations therefore clarify the different electrochemical behaviors found for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP.
Hole reorganization energies (λ) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in the gas phase to evaluate the capability of the TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP compounds as HTMs (see the ESI† for full computational details). The λ values estimated for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP are 0.101 and 0.285 eV, respectively. Note that these λ values are significantly smaller than those obtained for their corresponding fragments (0.166, 0.467 and 0.274 eV for BDT, DTP and TPA, respectively) due to the fact that charge extraction involves both the core and the peripheral TPA moieties (especially those linked through the 2,2′-positions of the thiophene rings). TTPA-BDT exhibits a low reorganization energy similar to those found for other excellent p-type semiconducting organic materials33,34 and smaller than that obtained for the reference spiro-OMeTAD (0.139 eV) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory.24TTPA-DTP shows a higher reorganization energy because the formation of the cation indicates important changes in the single–double CC bond-length alternation pattern of the DTP core. Therefore, TTPA-BDT presents great potential as a hole transporting material for PSC devices owing to its small λ value and the appropriate energy level alignment with the valence band edge of the perovskite.
Despite the electrochemical differences found between TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, both HTMs show very similar absorption profiles with strong absorption features below 470 nm (Fig. 3b). Both systems exhibit a broad band covering the 250–470 nm range with two well-resolved peaks. The first peak is registered at ca. 407 nm (6.5 and 8.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, respectively) along with a shoulder in the 360–370 nm range. The second intense absorption peak is observed at around 310 nm. Theoretical simulations of the absorption spectra for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP (Fig. S5†) were performed using B3LYP/6-31G** time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations of the lowest-energy singlet excited electronic states (Sn) in the presence of CH2Cl2 (Table S2†). The theoretical spectra correctly reproduce the experimental absorption spectra with two intense bands calculated at 448 and 305 nm (TTPA-BDT) and 463 and 307 nm (TTPA-DTP). For TTPA-BDT, the band at 448 nm results from the S0 → S1 and S0 → S3 electronic transitions calculated at 450 and 414 nm, respectively, and gives rise to the experimental peak registered at 407 nm. These S0 → S1 and S0 → S3 transitions involve one-electron promotions from the HOMO-2 and HOMO to the LUMO and indicate some charge transfer from the peripheral TPA units to the central BDT moiety (Fig. S3†). The band predicted at 305 nm, which is related to the experimental band peaking at 310 nm, shows a complex nature with significant participation of many electronic transitions. For TTPA-DTP, a similar absorption spectrum is predicted with slight bathochromic shifts of the absorption bands.
The emission spectra show broad bands centered at 505 and 485 nm for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, respectively. Optical band gaps of 2.73 and 2.76 eV (for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, respectively) are estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra.
The thermal properties of the HTMs were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 4). Both TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP show good thermal stability displaying a plateau until 411.7 and 424.7 °C, respectively, when they start decomposing. Upon heating, the BDT-based compound shows a glass transition at 164.3 °C prior to experiencing a crystallization process at 218.3 °C, eventually melting at 282.5 °C during the first heating cycle. The second heating cycle just shows a lower temperature glass transition at around 138.5 °C. Similarly, the DTP-based material experiences a glass transition at 71.1 °C, followed by two crystallization processes at 105.3 and 156.1 °C, to finally melt at 311.5 °C, during the first heating cycle. In the second cycle, the material undergoes a glass transition at 112.8 °C, to further crystallize at 211.1 °C and melt at 306.9 °C.

2.2. Photovoltaic characterization
The new hole transporting materials TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP were employed in perovskite-based solar cells to compare their performance with that of the most commonly used compound spiro-OMeTAD as a reference. PSCs were prepared following the standard n–i–p configuration having a stack of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass|compact titania (30 nm)|mesoporous titania (200 nm)|perovskite (600 nm)|HTM (50–300 nm)|gold electrode (70 nm). Owing to the exceptional advantages it presents, the compositional modification (MAPbBr3)0.15(FAPbI3)0.85 previously introduced by Seok et al. was used for the photoactive perovskite layer.9 The perovskite layer was fabricated following a one-step spin-coating procedure involving anti-solvent treatment. The HTMs were applied by spin-coating their corresponding solutions in chlorobenzene onto annealed perovskite films. Tert-butylpyridine, lithium tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide] (Li-TFSI) and tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]cobalt(III) (FK209) were added in equimolar amounts as additives to all HTM solutions. A detailed description of the solar cell fabrication process can be found in the ESI.†Fig. 5a shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical solar cell prepared using the aforementioned solar cell configuration. For both molecules, TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, the thickness of the HTM layer for the best performing devices was shown to be between 50 and 100 nm, which is slightly thinner than the 300 nm that is usually observed in devices with spiro-OMeTAD, but consistent with other reports on alternative small molecule HTMs.24Fig. 5b shows the energy level diagram of the different solar cell components. Both HTMs, TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, have their HOMO levels close to the valence band of the perovskite and should therefore be able to extract holes from the perovskite absorber.

(c) Forward and reverse current density–voltage (J–V) plots of PSC devices measured under reverse bias employing different HTMs, i.e.TTPA-BDT, TTPA-DTP and spiro-OMeTAD as a reference. (d) Current–voltage curves of TTPA-BDT, TTPA-DTP and spiro-OMeTAD as a reference measured on substrates having interdigitated gold electrodes with a channel length of 2.5 μm. Conductivity values were calculated using Ohm's law. 
Reverse and forward current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the devices employing the different HTMs, along with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the champion cells, are respectively displayed in Fig. 5c and Table 2. The reference spiro-OMeTAD cells did not show any significant hysteresis, in contrast with the new HTMs; therefore, it may be concluded that the hysteresis observed for the cells employing TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP originates from the HTM layer. This behaviour may arise from an unbalanced charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface, as well as small pinholes that are present due to the non-uniform film.35 With a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1%, measured under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G; 100 mW cm−1), TTPA-BDT shows an excellent performance, similar to that of the reference compound spiro-OMeTAD (17.7%) (PCE values of the 15 devices fabricated per HTM are shown in Fig. S9†). A high short circuit current of 23.0 mA cm−2 could be observed for TTPA-BDT compared to 22.3 mA cm−2 for spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, the open circuit voltage is 30 mV lower than that of the reference cell. TTPA-DTP has a PCE of 15.6% due to the relatively low fill factor caused by low conductivity. Although the HOMO levels of the two molecules differ by around 400 meV, no significant difference in the Voc of the devices could be observed. This can be related to the different electrochemical behaviors observed for both HTMs: a unique four-electron oxidation wave for TTPA-BDT and a well-separated one-electron first oxidation wave for TTPA-DTP. In fact, the HOMO energies calculated theoretically for TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP differ by only 107 meV. One reason for the underperformance of the device using TTPA-DTP could be the poor solubility of this HTM in chlorobenzene, which leads to a less uniform film formation (see Fig. S7†).

To get further insight into the charge transport properties of the new HTMs, conductivity measurements were carried out. Spiro-OMeTAD, TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP were applied on interdigitated gold substrates by spin-coating their corresponding solutions in chlorobenzene. The molecules were doped using 6 mol% FK209, representing the same amount used in the devices. The results are shown in semi-logarithmic I–V plots in Fig. 5d and the corresponding conductivity values were calculated using Ohm's law. The highest conductivity value was found for spiro-OMeTAD (3.74 × 10−4 S cm−1) followed by TTPA-BDT (1.26 × 10−4 S cm−1) and TTPA-DTP (4.91 × 10−5 S cm−1). Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the lower conductivity showed by TTPA-BDT is likely compensated by a thinner HTM layer, which in turn yields a higher short circuit current (23.0 vs. 22.2 mA cm−2). In contrast, in the case of TTPA-DTP the conductivity might be too low for an efficient charge extraction, thus adding further explanation for the lower device efficiency observed for this molecule. The smaller conductivity might be due to the higher reorganization energy calculated for TTPA-DTP (see above). From steady-state photoluminescence (PL) as well as transient PL we found that the new molecules behave in fact very similarly. For both TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, the steady state PL shows an efficient quenching of the perovskite emission, evinced by a sharp decline of the curves within the 5–10 ns timescale (see Fig. S8†). Altogether, the PL behavior of the HTMs/perovskite blends is indicative of an efficient charge transfer from the active layer to the hole transporting layer which, in turn, is coherent with the good photovoltaic response of the devices built making use of TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP.
3 Conclusions
In summary, two novel electron-rich small molecules consisting of BDT and DTP aromatic cores, decorated each with four triarylamine moieties, have successfully demonstrated their functionality as efficient HTMs in perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. PL experiments evinced the ability of TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP to efficiently collect the holes generated within the perovskite active layer, rapidly quenching its fluorescence emission. From the photovoltaic performance of the devices built, it is concluded that the HTM featuring the BDT core (PCE = 18.1%) clearly not only outperformed the one bearing the DTP core (15.6%), but also bested the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD (17.7%). Despite showing a conductivity slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (1.26 vs. 3.74 × 10−4 S cm−1), the performance of this particular TTPA-BDT HTM surpassed the spiro-OMeTAD performance due to a series of factors that include a better alignment of its HOMO (−5.36 eV) with the perovskite's valence band (−5.65 eV), and a significantly lower reorganization energy (0.101 eV). Another factor contributing to the better performance of TTPA-BDT is that the formed films showed thicknesses between 50 and 100 nm, quite lower than that typically observed for spiro-OMeTAD, which in turn contributes to its higher fill factor. From DFT calculations, TTPA-DTP is shown to present better electron-donating properties but also a higher reorganization energy (0.285 eV) that leads to a lower conductivity. We can therefore assume that HTMs based on triarylamines benefit from being fixed over a BDT aromatic core.
