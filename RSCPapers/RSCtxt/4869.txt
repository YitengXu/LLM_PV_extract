    , Accepted 4th October 2021First published on 5th October 2021AbstractA depolarized electric field (Edp) of ferroelectrics to boost the carrier separation and migration rate is critical to promote the field of visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). Here, the PHE performance of high-field poled semiconducting (1 − x)KNbO3–xBa(Ni1/2Nb1/2)O3−δ (abbreviated as (1 − x)KN-xBNN, x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) ferroelectric ceramics were systematically studied under full spectrum (λ > 320 nm) and visible light (λ > 420 nm), respectively. Benefiting from their narrow bandgap and sub-bandgap, all the Ba, Ni-modified KN ceramic powders exhibited a PHE response under visible light irradiation. Notably, the visible light PHE rate of the high-field poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic powder can be promoted to 415.16 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 17.8-fold higher than that of the unpoled sample (23.26 μmol g−1 h−1). The boosting PHE rate in poled samples can be attributed to the high-field polarization of the material, which can significantly affect the lattice structure and cause an ordered ferroelectric-domain structure to form a depolarized electric field (Edp). EPR spectroscopy indicated that the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample exhibited a superior catalytic activity of ˙OH evolution compared with its unpoled counterpart, suggesting the dependence of high photocatalytic performance on the unique field-induced polarization structure by an outer electric field. Moreover, a higher photo-excited transient photocurrent in the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN specimen further proved the positive effect of Edp on the photovoltaic response. The formation of Edp in the semiconducting (1 − x)KN–xBNN ferroelectric favors the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers. Thus, the synergistic effect of narrow bandgap and high-field polarization ability is the key to enhance the visible light photocatalysis of semiconducting ferroelectrics. Boosting the visible light photoelectrochemical catalytic activity of semiconducting (1 − x)KN–xBNN ferroelectrics through high-field polarization may provide a useful strategy to design new ferroelectric-based semiconductor materials.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of society, non-renewable power source depletion and environmental havoc have become stumbling blocks hindering the development of human civilization. Fortunately, many renewable, sustainable and pollution-free solar energy conversion techniques have been extensively developed. Employing solar energy for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is considered one of the most promising methods to solve the above two problems. Recently, ion-modified lead-free ferroelectric semiconductors, which possess a narrow bandgap, ferroelectricity, stable perovskite structure, and simple preparation process, have become the most promising material candidates for photovoltaic conversion.1–5 The ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous polarization that originates from non-centrosymmetric displacement in the unit cell of the crystal. In particular, after polarization treatment, the internal electric domains of the ferroelectric are oriented in a consistent direction, forming an depolarized electric field (Edp). Importantly, the PHE process is derived from the photovoltaic effect. Usually, the hydrogen evolution of a powder semiconductor photocatalytic material goes through the following steps: (i) the generation of photoexcited carriers, (ii) the separation and migration of photoexcited carriers, and (iii) photoexcited carriers undergo a redox reaction to generate hydrogen. The Edp plays a positive role in the photoelectric effect, which not only inhibits the probability of carrier recombination but also through band-bending to enhance the internal and interfacial charge transport of ferroelectric semiconductors, thereby promoting the photoelectric conversion efficiency.6–9 Thus, the affirmative effect of the Edp in a ferroelectric semiconductor on the separation and migration of photoinduced carriers is greatly beneficial to step 2, which may enhance the efficiency of PHE.
Nevertheless, many reported studies on ferroelectric based photocatalysis are mainly focused on the use of noble-metal deposition,10–15 carbide composites,16–19 structural heterojunctions,20–24 and other methods25–28 to promote the degradation of pollutants. The ferroelectric-based semiconductors with high-field polarization ability and excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, especially in visible light, have not been reported so far. Hideki Kato et al. prepared (Sb–Cr) co-doped SrTiO3 using a traditional solid-solution method. Under 300 W visible light with a 30% methanol solution sacrificial agent, the photoelectrochemical catalytic hydrogen production rate of (Sb–Cr) co-doped SrTiO3 can reach to 78 μmol h−1.29 The Mn, Ru, Rh, and Ir ion-doped SrTiO3 all have an excellent photoelectrochemical catalytic hydrogen production ability under visible light, as-prepared by Ryoko Konta et al. The best hydrogen production rate (17.2 μmol h−1) was obtained in the Rh-doped SrTiO3 sample.30 Wang et al. reported a quaternary perovskite oxide Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 with a stable H2 evolution rate of 325.4 μmol g−1 h−1 under irradiation with a 500 W xenon lamp.31 By comparing the catalytic hydrogen production performance of potassium niobate (KNbO3, abbreviated as KN) crystals with cubic and orthogonal phase structures, Yan et al. concluded that the cubic phase structure is more conducive to the progress of catalytic reactions,32 in which the rate of cubic phase KN was 1242 μmol g−1 h−1. Although the above-mentioned materials have good catalytic hydrogen production performance, the influence of the high-field-induced Edp of the ion-doped semiconducting ferroelectric on visible light catalytic hydrogen evolution lacks an in-depth understanding. Besides, most ion-doped ferroelectrics will sharply deteriorate the ferroelectricity while narrowing the bandgap, resulting in its lack in ability to form a Edp under high-field polarization. Thus, it is significant to employ semiconducting ferroelectrics with a narrow bandgap and high-field polarization ability as photocatalytic materials to study their PHE performance under visible light and the effect of a field-induced inner build-in electric field.
This study obtained a series of semiconducting (1 − x)KNbO3–xBa(Ni1/2Nb1/2)O3−δ (abbreviated as (1 − x)KN–xBNN, x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20) ferroelectric ceramics with a narrow bandgap and typical ferroelectricity through a Ba, Ni co-doping strategy. The phase transition behaviour of (1 − x)KN–xBNN materials and its effect on the photocatalysis were discussed. A strategy of forming Edp in semiconducting (1 − x)KN–xBNN ferroelectric ceramics via high-field polarization is proposed to enhance the activity of visible light photocatalytic water splitting. Besides, the effect of high-field polarization on the structural and optical properties were further discussed. This strategy will help broaden the ferroelectric semiconductor application fields in visible light photochemical catalysis and provide a design idea for new catalytic materials.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of samples
(1 − x)KNbO3–xBa(Ni1/2Nb1/2)O3-δ (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20, abbreviated as (1 − x)KN–xBNN) were prepared via a conventional solid-solution route. The initial materials of the synthesized sample were as follows: K2CO3, Nb2O5, BaCO3, and NiO. According to the specific chemical formula, these raw materials were weighed and ball milled with zirconium and ethanol for 24 h. Subsequently, the mixed-materials were dried, sieved, and calcined at 900 °C for 2 h. Then, these calcined powders were pressed into pellets by using 5 wt% PVA as a binder. The pellets were calcined at 600 °C for 2 h to remove the PVA binder and calcined at 1080–1110 °C for 2 h. Silver paste was brushed onto both sides of the ceramic pellets using a screen and then sintered at 580 °C for 0.5 h to conduct the electrical properties measurements and the poling process. After silver sintering, the samples were poled in a silicone oil bath with a direct current field (E = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 kV cm−1) at room temperature for 10 min to prepare the poled samples.
2.2 Characterization
The crystal phases of (1 − x)KN–xBNN (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (2θ range from 20° to 90°) with Cu-Kα radiation (XRD, PIXCED3D, Holland). The local lattice vibration modes of the samples were recorded using Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR Evolution, France). The microstructure of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic was inspected by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Quanta FEG-450, FEI, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200s, USA) was used to survey the phase structure by high-resolution TEM imaging (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The valence state of various element species in the 0.95KN–0.05BNN composite was identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250Xi, Thermo Fisher, USA). The ferroelectric performance of (1 − x)KN–xBNN pellets were analysed using a professional ferroelectric test system (TF Analyser 2000HS, Germany). An electrical property analyser (Partulab Technology Co., Ltd, DMS10001PBVG, China) equipped with a high-precision data collector (Wayne Kerr, 6500B, UK) was used to measure the dielectric temperature spectrum. The optical absorption property was tested via a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lamber 750s, PerkinElmer, USA) with an integrated sphere. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was characterized by a professional EPR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Germany).
2.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution test
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of (1 − x)KN–xBNN was determined through a high airtight automated circulation photocatalytic system (PerfectLight, Labsolar 6A, China) and online gas chromatography (FULI instruments, GC9790II, China). For photocatalytic H2 evolution, 20 mg photocatalyst powders were dispersed into the sacrificial agent solution (CH3OH, 0.3 M, 100 ml) and submerged in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Then, the prepared reaction solution was stirred in the top-irradiation photocatalytic reactor equipped with a circulating water bath cooling system (with the 1.2 wt% cocatalyst H14Cl6O6Pt). A 300 W xenon lamp (λ > 320 nm) was employed as a full spectrum source for the photocatalytic reaction. A UV cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) was utilized to evaluate the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance under visible light. Before the H2 evolution catalytic experiment, the photocatalytic reactor was illuminated in UV spectra for 1 h to reduce the cocatalyst.
2.4 EPR, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements
For the EPR test, 100 mg of catalyst was added to a beaker containing 200 ml of ultrapure water and sonicated for 30 min to disperse the catalyst. Then, 100 μl of the dispersed solution was mixed with 10 mg L−1 of DMPO solution. The solution was aspirated by capillary pipette and moved to a quartz NMR tube for the test. The electrochemical impedance property and transient photocurrent test of unpoled/poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN were evaluated by an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Ins, CHI 760E, China) via a typical three-electrode method. Conductive transparent ITO was used as the substrate to prepare the test electrode via a coating method. Specifically, 5 mg powders and 5 μL Nafion were dispersed in 200 μL methanol by sonication for 30 min to obtain a slurry. Then, the 1 cm2 working electrode was dip-coated by the slurry and dried at 50 °C for 2 h. The Ag/AgCl and Pt flakes were integrated into the separated electrochemical cell (0.5 M Na2SO4, electrolyte) as the reference electrode and counter electrode for measurements.
3. Results and discussion
The multi-bandgap position of (1 − x)KN–xBNN is portrayed in Fig. 1(a). The narrowing bandgap and introduced multi-sub-bandgap of Ba, Ni co-doping KN, indicating the semi-conductivity of the ferroelectric and outstanding visible light absorber. Besides, the traditional ferroelectric hysteresis loop (P–E) of (1 − x)KN–xBNN ceramics under 30 kV cm−1 is shown in Fig. 1(b). All samples show typical ferroelectricity, except x = 0.20, which directly ensures the rationality of the polarization process. The Ps of (1 − x)KN–xBNN increases when x = 0.02, and gradually decreases with the increasing doping content. The increase in Ps at x = 0.02 is due to the appearance of oxygen vacancies, which causes an increase of the local electric field of the surrounding cations of the B-site cation, resulting in the Ni2+ cations deviating from the centre of symmetry more than the original Nb5+ cations. At the same time, the decrease in Ps can be attributed to the strengthening of the lattice ionic bond after Ba, Ni doping, which weakens the offset of the positive and negative ion centres. More importantly, a near-complete paraelectric phase (C phase) transformation is reached at x = 0.20, which can be a reason for the infeasibility of polarization treatment on this doping content. Fig. 1(a and b) show that the synergistic boosting effect of a narrow multi-bandgap and high-field polarization ability (i.e., semiconducting ferroelectricity) is the key to enhance the visible light photocatalysis of semiconducting ferroelectrics. Fig. 1(c) and (d) respectively reveal the unpoled/poled PHE performance of (1 − x)KN–xBNN under full spectrum (λ > 320 nm) and visible light (λ > 420 nm). It can be found that the PHE activity has been significantly improved after polarization treatment. The comparison of PHE performance between the unpoled/poled 0.94KN–0.06BNN ferroelectric semiconductor and other ion-doped ferroelectric-based catalyser is shown in Fig. 1(e).32–51 The superior hydrogen production rate (415.16 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light irradiation is achieved in the poled 0.94KN–0.06BNN sample.

The room-temperature XRD patterns from the (1 − x)KN–xBNN samples are shown in Fig. 2(a). The XRD patterns of the pristine KN index are consistent with the standard card (PDF# 01-071-0946) and all the doped samples also show a pure perovskite structures, indicating that Ba2+ and Ni2+ ions are incorporated into the KN crystal lattice. With increasing x, the main peak intensity of the XRD patterns gradually decreases, which suggests that Ba, Ni co-doping will reduce the crystallinity of ceramics. Fig. 2(b) shows the enlarged XRD patterns of (1 − x)KN–xBNN with a range of 2θ from 42° to 48°. As the doping content x increases, the (022) and (200) crystal planes of pure KN gradually coalesce into the (202) crystal planes of the cubic phase of KN (PDF# 01-071-0947), which implies that a phase transition from the orthorhombic (O) to cubic (C) phase passed by tetragonal (T) may occur in (1 − x)KN–xBNN. Furthermore, compared with the undoped KN, the peaks located at 42–48° in Ba, Ni-doped KN samples gradually shift to a lower 2θ angle with x, which can be ascribed to the introduction of Ni2+ (0.69 Å) with a larger ion radius than Nb5+ (0.64 Å).52 Furthermore, the local vibration mode and phase transition trend in (1 − x)KN–xBNN materials were analysed by using Raman spectroscopy. As Fig. 2(c) shows, Raman peaks at 191, 270, 528, 600, and 834 cm−1 were observed in the pure KN ceramic, in accordance with previous results for ferroelectric O-KN (space group: orthorhombic).53 In addition, Raman spectroscopy of Ba, Ni-doped KN is similar to that of the virgin KN ceramic. Even so, there are still subtle differences between the two sharp modes (B1, B2)(TO2) and A1(TO4, LO4), which respond at 191 cm−1 and 294 cm−1, respectively. The peak intensity decreases with increasing doping content, which shows the gradually weakened ferroelectric long-range order of the samples.54–56 Furthermore, a merging tendency can be found between the vibration model peaks (B1 + B2)(TO3) and A1(TO3) at 528 and 600 cm−1, which reveals that the materials are gradually evolving to the cubic phase under the influence of Ba, Ni doping. These results are in line with the XRD analysis. In addition, with increasing x, the vibration peaks of the doped sample move to a lower wavenumber, which can be attributed to the change in bond length and energy caused by Ba, Ni doping. Thus, these phenomena further provide sufficient evidence that a gradually deteriorated long-range order and a phase transition process occur in the (1 − x)KN–xBNN solid solution system. Fig. 2(d) and (e) portray the absorption spectra of (1 − x)KN–xBNN samples and their corresponding bandgaps, respectively.57Fig. 2(d) shows that the light absorption range of pure KN is mainly covered by the ultraviolet band. Conversely, Ba, Ni-doped KN has a stronger absorption coefficient in the visible-infrared range, which can be attributed to the interstitial state introduced by the Ni transition metal ion.4 Furthermore, three extra minor broad absorption peaks in Ba, Ni-doped KN can be observed. The first band absorption peak is located at 450 nm (ca. 2.75 eV) and overlaps with the border of the intrinsic bandgap absorption. The second band absorption peak is at 740 nm (ca. 1.67 eV). A shoulder absorption peak at 680 nm (ca. 1.82 eV) (Fig. 2(e)), can be clearly observed in the bandgap image of (1 − x)KN–xBNN. In particular, the third broad absorption peak, centred at 1240 nm (ca. 1.00 eV), appears only at x > 0.05. According to crystal field theory, this appearance of broadband absorption peaks in Ba, Ni-doped KN is due to the Ni2+ ion of spin allowing d–d transitions. The d electronic state of the Ni2+ ion splits into the crystal field of octahedral NiO6, resulting in an abnormal absorption spectrum with three spin-allowed transitions in the visible-infrared range.58 Specifically, the first broadband absorption peak centred at 450 nm (ca. 2.75 eV) originates from the 3A2g(3F) → 3T1g(3P) transition, and the shoulder broadband peak absorption located at 680 nm (ca. 1.82 eV) is caused by the 3A2g(3F) → 1F1g(1D) transition. The transitions of 3A2g(3F) → 3T1g(3F) and 3A2g(3F) → 3T2g(3F) can be responsible for the 740 nm (ca. 1.67 eV) and 1240 nm (ca. 1.00 eV) broadband absorption peak, respectively.11,58 The multi-level bandgap values of different doping contents are given in Table 1. Therefore, the narrowed multi-bandgap of the (1 − x)KN–xBNN materials ensure the feasibility of absorption under visible light stimulation for PHE activity. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relative permittivity (εr) and dielectric loss (tanδ) of (1 − x)KN–xBNN ceramics measured at 100 kHz are shown in the inset of Fig. 2(e). Usually, KN-based ceramics have two anomalous dielectric peaks, including the conversion peak of the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase (O → T) and tetragonal to cubic phase (T → C). The εr values of the O → T and T → C peaks in (1 − x)KN–xBNN increase at x = 0.02 and instead decrease with increasing x. The increase in εr at x = 0.02 is mainly due to the emergence of oxygen vacancies and point defects in the KN lattice, which enhance the pinning effect and slow down the flow of domain walls, leading to the promotion of the dielectric constant. However, excessive doping deteriorates the insulation of the material and increases the leakage current, weakening the dielectric polarization ability.59 In addition, in contrast to pure KN, there is an obvious signal of disappearance for the O → T and T → C peaks with increasing x, which reveals that the materials undergo a gradient phase transition as the doping content increases. However, through the above characterization methods, the typical characteristics of the ferroelectric structure in the (1 − x)KN–xBNN solid solution can still be observed over a wide temperature range.

To further analyse the specific crystal structure and the influence of the phase composition of (1 − x)KN–xBNN on PHE activity, the Rietveld refinement method was used to fit the XRD pattern data through Fullprof Suite software.52,60 As shown in Fig. 3(a–e), all refined XRD maps of (1 − x)KN–xBNN display acceptable fitting results. Moreover, the schematics show that the refined cell structure of the phases is composed of (1 − x)KN–xBNN materials for different doping contents. The reliable factors and detailed structural parameters are given in Table 2. It can be observed that the credibility factors Sig (< 5%), Rwp (< 10%), and Rexp (< 10%) of all refined results are effectively tolerable values. It is worth noting that variations in and the fraction of (1 − x)KN–xBNN materials are consistent with the XRD analysis. The T phase evolves from 18.87% (of x = 0.02) to 94.37% (of x = 0.10), and is transformed to C phases completely (96.34%) at x = 0.20, suggesting that a phase transformation process occurs in the (1 − x)KN–xBNN material because of the increasing doping ratio. Importantly, the different phase compositions of the semiconducting (1 − x)KN–xBNN ferroelectric catalytic material may imply a difference in its photocatalytic activity.32,61–63

The morphology and microstructure of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic were probed by FE-SEM and STEM technologies. Fig. 4(a) shows the FE-SEM image of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic. The grain size of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic is small and dense, which may be the result of the obstruction of grain growth due to domain pinning by oxygen vacancies.52,60 The TEM image of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic powder is shown in Fig. 4(b). Equally, the high-resolution image (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction image (SAED) are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). From Fig. 4(c), it can be observed that the lattice fringes of 0.4017 nm and 0.3986 nm, can be accurately assigned to the (011) and (100) crystal planes of the O-KN material. In particular, the 0.2840 nm lattice fringe found in Fig. 4(c) belongs to the T-KN of the (110) crystal plane. This TEM analysis directly demonstrates the coexistence of the O-KN phase and T-KN phase in the 0.95KN–0.05BNN. Additionally, the lattice fringe is 0.1890 nm, 0.3047 nm, and the 70.68° angle between them in Fig. 4(d), which can be determined as the (101) and (102) crystal planes of the T-KN phase. Hence, in combination with XRD and Raman analysis, the TEM results further confirmed the phase transition in the (1 − x)KN–xBNN samples.

Fig. 5(a–e) display the XPS survey spectrum and narrow scan spectrum with different elements (i.e., K, Nb, Ba, Ni, and O) of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample. The existence of elements in (1 − x)KN–xBNN can be observed from the whole survey spectrum, indicating the successful introduction of Ba and Ni elements in the KN lattice. According to the peak position and the difference in peak energy between K 2p1/2 and K 2p3/2, as Fig. 5(b) shows, the presence of K+ ions is confirmed. The binding energies of Nb 3d3/2 and Nb 3d5/2 at 209.48 eV and 206.68 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(c)), suggest that the valence state of Nb in (1 − x)KN–xBNN is +5. Importantly, because the binding energy peaks of 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 in Ba ions are 795.78 eV and 780.38 eV, respectively, its valence state can be identified as +2, as shown in Fig. 5(d). Signals related to Ni can be recognized in the narrow scan spectrum of Fig. 5(e). The corresponding binding energies, 854.58 eV and 860.38 eV in the 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample, correspond to the Ni 2p3/2 peak and its satellite peak centre, respectively, which indicates that Ni exists mainly in the valence of Ni2+ in the as-prepared (1 − x)KN–xBNN solid solution.64,65 Consequently, the specific chemical formula of 0.95KN–0.05BNN can be roughly calculated as 0.95KN–0.05Ba(Ni2+0.5Nb5+0.5)O2.5. The narrow-band scanning spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 5(f)), can be fitted to the two binding energy peaks at 530.88 and 528.98 eV, which correspond to oxygen vacancies (OV) and lattice oxygen (OL), respectively.59,66 These results indicate the presence of oxygen vacancies originating from the charge imbalance in the Ba, Ni-modified KN samples. Thus, the element valence state is consistent with the 0.95KN–0.05BNN solid solution system. Besides, the existence of oxygen vacancies contributes to the reduction in the bandgap and they also serve as electron capture centres to beneficially promote the photocatalytic process.67

The PHE performance of unpoled (1 − x)KN–xBNN under full spectra (λ > 320 nm) and visible light (λ > 420 nm) is displayed in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Pristine KN exhibits the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) rate of 468.10 μmol g−1 h−1 in the group under full spectra. The PHE rate decreases to 235.98 μmol g−1 h−1 at x = 0.05 and then slightly increases to 299.06 μmol g−1 h−1 at x = 0.20. In contrast, the PHE rate first decreased and rebound with increasing x, which is the result of the change in phase composition in (1 − x)KN–xBNN. The photocatalytic reactivity of KN-based ferroelectrics is shown to be phase-dependent, which follows the order of cubic (C) > orthorhombic (O) > tetragonal phase (T).32,61–63 Under visible light irradiation (Fig. 6(b)), Ba, Ni co-doped KN of x = 0.02 exhibits the highest PHE rate of 25.54 μmol g−1 h−1, while pristine KN shows no visible photocatalytic activity. Therefore, this result indicates that it is a plausible way to extend hydrogen photocatalysis in the visible light range by doping transition metals in ferroelectric materials. To study the effect of polarization treatment on the PHE performance of the samples, the PHE performance of poled (1 − x)KN–xBNN was examined under full spectra and visible light irradiation, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). Under the polarization field of 10 kV cm−1 for 10 min at room temperature, the hydrogen production performance of the x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.10 contents was significantly improved. In contrast, the lack of enhancement of photocatalytic activity at x = 0.20 may be caused by its complete cubic phase structure without polarization capability. Under high doping content (x = 0.20), the large leakage current and severely distorted crystal structure make it intolerant to high-field polarization, and breakdown in certain areas makes the catalytic activity passivate. The highest PHE was obtained in the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample under full spectral radiation (847.34 μmol g−1 h−1), which is higher than the pure KN (707. 61 μmol g−1 h−1). Notably, although pure KN exhibits superior ferroelectricity, it does not obtain the most excellent PHE activity after high-field polarization. This can be attributed to the fact that the Ba, Ni co-doped sample exhibits a lower sub-bandgap compared to the virgin KN, which promotes the photon capture efficiency, even in the full spectrum. The coexistence of O and T phases increases the distribution of the random field within the internal of 0.95KN–0.05BNN semiconducting ferroelectric materials, smoothing the process of domain flipping under external electric fields.68 Moreover, the abundance of oxygen vacancies introduced by heterovalent ion substitution can become the trapping centre for electron–hole pairs in the photocatalytic process, which can promote the photocatalytic reactions.69,70 Thus, the highest hydrogen production rates in the 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample are the result of the combined effect of structure, bandgap and oxygen vacancies. All poled (1 − x)KN–xBNN samples show a higher PHE rate under visible light than the unpoled samples, except for the x = 0.20 content. Likewise, the highest PHE rate under visible light conditions (λ > 420 nm) were also obtained in the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample (415.16 μmol g−1 h−1), which is 17.8-fold higher than that the unpoled sample. The boosting of catalytic activity in the poled samples can be ascribed to the formation of Edp after high-field polarization. The Edp formed by the appropriate high-field poling is beneficial for the PHE rate in semiconducting ferroelectric ceramics. The enhanced internal and interface charge transport of photogenerated carriers is caused by the bending of the energy band in the poled ferroelectric semiconductor, which is also beneficial to hydrogen production.

The impact of high polarization electric fields on the crystal structures and electrochemical properties of the (1 − x)KN–xBNN samples is investigated as well. The selected 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample is poled under different DC bias fields (E = 0, 5, and 10 kV cm−1) for 10 min at room temperature. The XRD patterns of poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN are shown in Fig. 7(a). Pure perovskite structures can still be observed in these processed samples, compared with unpoled samples. However, it can be found that with an increasing polarization electric field, the diffraction peak tends to shift to a low angle and then returns to a high angle in the magnified XRD plot of 44–46° (Fig. 7(b)). This phenomenon uncovers that although the structure of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample still maintains a pure perovskite structure, the lattice parameter is changed under outer electric field treatments.71 The same result can also be observed in the Raman spectrum of the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample (E = 0, 5, and 10 kV cm−1), as shown in Fig. 7(c). The enlarged image of Fig. 7(d) shows that the vibration mode of (B1, B2)(TO2) shifts to a high wavenumber at E = 5 kV cm−1 and then swings to a low wavenumber at an E = 10 kV cm−1 polarization electric field. Additionally, the peak representing the long-range polar order of KN ferroelectricity gradually weakens with increasing applied electric field, which may be caused by the phase transition behaviour in the polarization process.71 Therefore, the electric field-induced phase transition can be observed in the KN–BNN system. Fig. 7(e) shows the temperature dependence of relative permittivity of the unpoled/poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample at different frequencies. Dielectric dispersion phenomena can be observed in the permittivity vs. temperature spectrum of unpoled/poled samples, revealing the characteristics of relaxing ferroelectrics in (1 − x)KN–xBNN system ceramics. Notably, there is a difference between the dielectric curves of unpoled and poled samples at low temperatures (below 350 °C). This difference can be ascribed to the space charge and dipole defects of the poled sample being frozen in a high potential trap, which leads to a longer relaxation Debye time at low temperatures.72 Moreover, the frequency spectrum for the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ceramic poled under different electric fields are shown in Fig. 7(f). The dielectric constant decreases significantly with an increasing poled field (E = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 kV cm−1) and tends to be stable at the polarization field of E = 20 kV cm−1, which proves the existence of an ordered nanodomain structure and weak field piezoelectricity after high-field polarization.73 Therefore, the results indicate that the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN possesses an Edp generated by polarization, which effectively improves the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. Similarly, the XRD data of poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN are used for the Rietveld refinement to analyse the polarization process's influence on the structural parameters and phase composition. Fig. 8(a–c) show the Rietveld refinement results of the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample under E = 0, 5, and 10 kV cm−1. The reliable factors Rwp of the 0, 5, and 10 kV cm−1 polarization samples are respectively 5.40, 8.11, and 7.55. All the refined structural parameters are listed in Table 3. Notably, the phase composition of 0.95KN–0.05BNN tends to transform into the O phase under 5 kV cm−1 for 10 min, and gradually evolves into the T phase under 10 kV cm−1 for 10 min. The successful inversion of vast ferroelectric domains will expand the dimensionality and ratio of the built-in field, which is beneficial to the PHE process. Besides, as the polarization voltage increases (0 kV cm−1 → 10 kV cm−1), the unit cell volume of the O phase expands from 129.365 Å3 at E = 0 kV cm−1 to 129.892 Å3 at E = 10 kV cm−1. Similarly, the unit cell volume of the T phase increases from 64.621 Å3 at E = 0 kV cm−1 to 65.127 Å3 at E = 10 kV cm−1. This result can be ascribed to the stretching of the NbO6 octahedron in the polarization process. With an increase in the polarization electric field, the c/a value of the O phase decreases and the c/a value of the T phase increases, which indicates that high-field polarization tends to increase the symmetry of the O phase and lower the symmetry of the T phase. Admittedly, there is a significant sign that the polarization process influences the evolution of the phase structure in the 0.95KN–0.05BNN ferroelectric semiconductor.

The effect of high field polarization on the optical properties of 0.95KN–0.05BNN semiconducting ferroelectrics has also been investigated. A slight change of absorbance can be seen in Fig. 9. Accordingly, the bandgap of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN samples treated at different high-field polarizations changed, which can be attributed to the lattice distorted and field-induced phase transition.74 Therefore, high-field polarization also has nonnegligible effects on the bandgap structure of ferroelectric semiconductors.
 Fig. 9  The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample under different high-field polarization (E = 0, 5 and 10 kV cm−1). The inset shows the corresponding Tauc plots of bandgaps. 
To further demonstrate the crucial role of Edp in (1 − x)KN–xBNN for PHE properties, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to detect the main active species intensity of undoped/doped 0.95KN–0.05BNN while splitting water. As shown in Fig. 10(a and b), the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample (E = 10 kV cm−1 for 10 min at room temperature) exhibits a higher active species signal intensity in the full spectrum and visible range than the unpoled samples, which validates that photogenerated electron–holes in the poled sample are more effectively separated and migrated owing to the existence of Edp, especially in the visible light range. Compared with the only doped 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample, the doped 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample with cocatalyst Pt shows a higher DMPO–˙OH signal intensity, which indicates that the photocatalysis promoter Pt can speed up the transfer of electrons in the produced hydrogen of the semiconducting ferroelectric.75 Therefore, these results persuasively verify that the high-field polarization-induced Edp of ferroelectric semiconductors can enhance the efficiency of PHE. Furthermore, the transient photocurrent test and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of the unpoled/poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN powder are shown in Fig. 10(c) and the inset of Fig. 10(c), respectively. It can be seen from the impedance spectra that the poled sample shows a smaller arc radius, indicating the relatively smaller resistance acquired in the poled sample. In the illustration of Fig. 10(c), both the unpoled/poled samples exhibit a decaying current response related to the state of the light source and the photocurrent of the poled sample is much greater than that of the unpoled sample. This reveals that the poled sample has a better photovoltaic response output, which is consistent with previous hydrogen production experiment results.

The inset plot illustrates the photocurrent versus time plot of the unpoled/poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample response with light on/off. 

Fig. 11(a–d) shows a diagram of the enhanced carrier separation and migration with high-field polarization induced Edp. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 11(a) and (c), a pseudo-single-domain state is formed in ferroelectrics after high-field polarization applied. In the single ferroelectric domain, the high-field polarization treatment redistributes polarized charges and creates an Edp to counteract the effect of the applied external electric field, as shown in Fig. 11(b). The positive effect of Edp on the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers for the photoelectrochemical catalytic reaction is shown in Fig. 11(d). Thus, the benefit of Edp on photogenerated carriers induced by high field polarization greatly enhance the PHE rate of semi-conducting ferroelectric catalytic materials.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, (1 − x)KN–xBNN (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20) samples were successfully synthesized via a solid-state reaction route. An obvious trend in the phase transition O → T → C in the (1 − x)KN–xBNN system was observed from the XRD refinement results, Raman spectrum, dielectric properties, and P–E hysteresis loop. The coexistence of the O phase and the T phase in the 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample was further confirmed by HR-TEM. From the XRD, Raman, and dielectric plots of poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN, it can be confirmed that the high-field polarization process will affect the crystal structure and create the built-in field in the material. Benefiting from their narrow bandgap and ferroelectricity, all Ba, Ni-modified KN materials exhibited a PHE response under full spectra and visible light. Particularly, the highest water splitting rate was achieved in the high-field poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample under full spectra and visible light, which were 847.34 μmol g−1 h−1 and 415.16 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The much higher water splitting rate indicates that the advantage of Edp in speeding the separation and migration of carriers in ferroelectric semiconductors can also be applied to the field of photoelectrochemical catalytic hydrogen production. In addition, the poled 0.95KN–0.05BNN sample shows a smaller resistance and a larger transient photocurrent response. The positive influence of Edp formed by the high-field polarization process of semiconducting (1 − x)KN–xBNN ferroelectric ceramics on its photoelectrochemical hydrogen production activity may provide a new strategy to design high-rate catalytic hydrogen production materials.
