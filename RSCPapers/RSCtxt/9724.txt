    , Accepted 16th June 2017First published on 16th June 2017AbstractLanthanide (Ln)-doped nanocrystals generally display low luminescence quantum efficiency due to forbidden nature of the 4f–4f transition besides possessing low absorption cross sections (∼10 M−1 cm−1). Considering the demand for these materials, particularly for light emission and bioimaging applications, it is very important to improve their quantum efficiency. This work demonstrates a strategy to enhance Si solar cell efficiency via sensitization of Eu3+ ions luminescence from colloidal nanocrystals. We have for the first time developed a simple ligand exchange approach to attach 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3 butanedione (TPB) to the surface of Eu3+-doped LiYF4 nanocrystals (NCs). Owing to the good overlap between the emission of the TPB ligands and the energy levels of Eu3+ ions, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the ligand to Eu3+ ions upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation of the ligand, leading to intense red emission. The sensitization of Eu3+ ions greatly enhanced the quantum yield of Eu3+ ions (∼31%) compared to the ∼5% obtained via direct excitation of Eu3+ ions (λexi = 394 nm) in Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs. A device was fabricated by embedding the nanocrystals on a Si solar cell to capture the UV photons and convert them into visible ones, which subsequently creates charge carriers inside the cell. Upon exposure to UV light, the nanocrystal embedded Si solar cell shows overall enhancement in the photocurrent upon excitation under UV radiation.
Introduction
The increase in the price of fossil fuels and the global warming associated with their vast use are currently leading to a red alert to society. This calls for alternative clean and renewable energy resources. Among the many resources, solar energy is considered to be one of the most reliable choices to meet the global energy demand.1–3 Until recently, crystalline silicon-based solar cells have been the most commonly used energy devices for commercial applications.4 However, silicon solar cells effectively convert only photons with energy close to the silicon bandgap (indirect bandgap ∼1.1 eV), as a result of which there is a mismatch between the incident solar spectrum and the spectral absorption properties. This leads to a large portion of the energy remaining unused, which limits the maximum theoretical efficiency (∼31%) of single junction cells, called the Shockley–Queisser theory. A small fraction of photons with an energy (Eph) larger than the bandgap (Eg) of Si are absorbed but the excess energy (Eph − Eg) is not used effectively owing to electron thermalization losses. If Eph is smaller than the bandgap, the photons are not absorbed and totally transmitted through the cell.5 This leads to a poor response of silicon solar cells in the UV region compared to the visible range. In fact, this problem can be minimized by introducing molecular systems which can convert high energy UV photons into visible photons in solar devices.
There are quite a few reports on using photon downconversion or down-shifting strategies using lanthanide (Ln3+)-doped materials to enhance the silicon solar cell efficiency.6–11 In fact, through suitable doping, some of the Ln3+-doped materials can convert two or more low energy photons into high energy photons via the upconversion process which has also been explored for enhancing the efficiency of solar cells.12–16 Moreover, the luminescence from Ln3+-doped nanomaterials is useful for various applications such as developing economical luminescent lamps, light emitting diodes, television, computer displays, optical fibres, and lasers, just to mention a few.17–21 The main drawback of Ln3+ doped nanomaterials for practical application is the low molar absorptivities.22,23 There are many energy levels available for the f–f transitions of lanthanide ions, but these f → f transitions are usually forbidden by the Laporte selection rule.24,25 The direct population of these energy levels is less efficient as lanthanide ions have very low absorption coefficients.26 In addition, quite a few transitions are also forbidden by the spin selection rule. Typically, the molar absorption coefficients of these transitions are very weak (<3 M−1 cm−1).22 This leads to low luminescence quantum yield (QY) and therefore calls for the improvement of the QY of Ln3+-doped nanocrystals (NCs) via sensitization. The emissive properties of a lanthanide ion are governed by how the excited state(s) can be populated and the minimization of the non-radiative deactivation pathways. To meet the first requirement, sensitization via the surroundings of the ion is often used to increase the overall quantum yield of lanthanide containing molecular complexes. Therefore, organic ligands play an important role in improving the luminescence efficiency of Ln3+ ions.27,28 Those organic ligands which have a strong absorbance in the UV region can be good sensitizers for Ln3+ ions. The energy absorbed can be transferred either directly to the Ln3+ ions or via inter-system crossing (ISC) from the singlet state to the triplet state of the ligand and successively from the triplet state to the Ln3+ ions, causing excitation of the lanthanide ions. When the excited lanthanide ions return to the ground state through a radiative process, the corresponding typical emission from the lanthanides is obtained. This mechanism is called the antenna effect.22 Hexafluoroacetylacetone, β-diketonate ligands, pyrazole, etc. have been used as antenna molecules.29–31 However, the β-diketonate ligands are considered to be one of the important antenna molecules in terms of high Ln3+ ion emissions. This is likely due to the effectiveness of energy transfer from the ligand to the Ln3+ ions. However, the main drawback of the β-diketonate ligands is the presence of high energy oscillators such as C–H and O–H which non-radiatively quench the emitting level of lanthanide ions and result in a reduction of luminescence intensity. To overcome this problem, we have selected fluorinated β-diketonate as a sensitizer. The C–F bond has a low vibrational frequency which can relatively decrease the rate of nonradiative deactivation and also reduce the self-quenching phenomenon.32 However, most of the reports on the sensitization of Ln3+ ion luminescence are on that in Ln3+ complexes. There are only a few reports on the sensitization of Ln3+ ion luminescence in Ln3+ doped nanocrystals. Petoud et al. have for the first time shown tropolone sensitized Nd3+ and Yb3+ ion emission in NaYF4 nanocrystals.33 9-Oxidophenalenone, hydroxypyridinone ligand derivative, 6-carboxy-50-methyl-2,20-bipyridine, etc. are used as Ln3+ ion sensitizers in Ln3+ doped nanocrystals.34–37 Recently, Agbo and Rebecca have shown ligand sensitized luminescence in Ln3+-doped nanocrystals.38,39 Moreover, the luminescence from Ln3+-doped nanocrystals has also been sensitized using d-block metal ions as co-dopants and by lanthanide substitution in ZnS and CdS quantum dots.40–42 Mahalingam et al. have sensitized Eu3+ ion luminescence in Eu3+ doped LaF3–C dot nanocomposites via C dot emission.43 Zou et al. reported the first example of two-photon upconversion luminescence sensitization in β-NaYF4:Er:Yb nanocrystals using the NIR absorbing dye IR-806.14 To our knowledge there are not many reports on the sensitization of Ln3+ ions in Ln3+-doped nanocrystals and indeed, there remains much scope for further improvement. Our objective is to develop a general and simple synthetic strategy to attach organic sensitizers to nanocrystals and explore the sensitization of the Ln3+ ions in Ln3+-doped nanoparticles to improve the current conversion efficiency in solar cells. This is advantageous as nanoparticles are quite robust and mechanically more stable compared to complexes and could be a better choice towards device fabrication. In fact, there are only a few reports on the use of luminescence from Ln3+-based complexes as solar concentrators to improve the solar cell efficiency.44–46 For example, Carlos and co-workers have discussed the use of Ln3+-based organic–inorganic hybrid materials as solar cell concentrators.47 Recently, the same group has developed Ln3+-based silsequioxane materials for use as transparent solar cell concentrators.48 However, most of the reports on luminescent solar concentrators were focused on using Ln3+ based complexes by developing hybrid materials or incorporating them into sol–gel materials. Our idea is to stabilize Eu3+-doped nanoparticles using suitable sensitizer molecules as capping ligands. Upon excitation of the ligands (sensitizers) with a suitable light, they are expected to transfer their energy to Eu3+ ions present inside the nanoparticles, provided that the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) distance falls within the distance between the ligands and Eu3+ ions. This is a reasonable hypothesis as the FRET distances involving Ln3+ systems are about 10 nm.49
In this report we have for the first time developed a simple method to sensitize Eu3+ ion luminescence in Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs by attaching 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3 butanedione (TPB) molecules to the surface of NCs via a ligand exchange method.50 The use of fluorinated β-diketonate as a sensitizer is advantageous as the C–F bond has a low vibrational frequency which can relatively decrease the rate of nonradiative deactivation of the excited states. Owing to the good overlap between the broad UV absorption band of the TPB ligand and the energy levels of Eu3+ ions, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the ligand to Eu3+ ions upon UV excitation of the ligand. This results in the production of intense red emission from the Eu3+ ions. The intense red emission and broadband excitation of TBP capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs have been used to enhance the solar cell efficiency by depositing the NCs onto the Si solar cell.
Materials and methods
Materials
All the chemicals used in this work, yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 99.99%), europium oxide (Eu2O3, 99.99%), trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH, 99%), oleic acid (90%), 1-octadecene (90%), lithium trifluoroacetate (CF3COOLi, 99.99%) and 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione (TPB), and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All the materials were used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the study. Rare-earth nitrates were prepared by dissolving the corresponding metal oxide in nitric acid and evaporating the acid at elevated temperature (95 °C).
Synthesis
Eu3+-Doped LiYF4 NCs were prepared via the thermal decomposition method using oleic acid as a capping agent and 1-octadecene as a high boiling point solvent. Briefly, 0.95 mmol Y2O3 and 0.05 mmol Eu2O3 were taken in a 3 neck round bottom flask and converted into lanthanide trifluoroacetates by refluxing with a 5 mL trifluoroacetic acid and 5 mL water mixture at 85 °C and then evaporated to dryness at 65 °C overnight. Oleic acid (20 mL) and 1-octadecene (20 mL) were added to dried precursors and then 1 mmol lithium trifluoroacetate was added to the mixture. The resulting mixture was heated to 120 °C under vacuum. After 15 minutes, the temperature of the mixture was increased to 320 °C under argon flow for 1 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and the NCs were precipitated with absolute ethanol. The NCs were separated by centrifugation and further purified by dispersing them in hexane followed by precipitation again with absolute ethanol. In the next step, oleic acid was removed to functionalize TPB molecules to the surface of Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs via a ligand exchange approach. Oleic acid capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs were dispersed in 20 mL hexane and added to a separating funnel containing 20 mL water. The mixture was shaken for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 2 drops of concentrated HCl were added to the mixture to adjust the pH to 4 and shaken for 10 minutes. This led to the removal of oleic acid from the NC surface, resulting in bare NCs which were not stable in the aqueous layer and settled quickly at the bottom of the flask.40 Subsequent capping of the TBP ligand was performed by taking the bare NCs (50 mg) in 50 mL water with an excess amount of TPB ligands (∼500 mg). The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 days. TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs were separated by centrifugation, followed by washing with water and absolute ethanol.
Characterization technique
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Rigaku-SmartLab diffractometer attached to a D/teX ultra-detector and a Cu Kα source operating at 35 mA and 70 kV. The scan range was set at 10–70° 2θ with a step size of 0.02° and a count time of 2 s. The samples were powdered well and spread evenly on a quartz slide. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a UHR-FEG-TEM (JEOL; model JEM 2100 F) using a 200 kV electron source. Samples were prepared by placing a drop of aqueous dispersion of the nanocomposites on a carbon-coated copper grid and drying the grid in air. Room temperature optical absorption spectra of all the samples were recorded on a Hitachi U4100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using a 3 ml quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm). The photoluminescence spectra were measured on a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrometer equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp. The excitation and emission light was dispersed using a Czerny–Turner monochromator at an optical resolution of 1 nm. The emitted photons were detected using a Hamamatsu R928 detector. The output signal was recorded using a computer. The luminescence lifetime measurements were performed with a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog CP machine equipped with a pulsed Xe source operating at 25 W. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer with the KBr disc technique in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded using 10 mg of the samples mixed with 200 mg of KBr to produce pellets. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) studies were performed using an NT-MDT NTEGRA instrument obtained from NT-MDT (Santa Clara, CA). The thickness of the film was measured by scratching the film with a blade and scanning the scratch of the film. The depth of the scratched area is considered the thickness of the film.
Results and discussion
Phase and structure
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of oleic acid capped 5 mol% Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs and TPB capped 5 mol% Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs are shown in Fig. 1a. The XRD patterns of these LiYF4 NCs are in good agreement with the standard pattern of tetragonal LiYF4 crystals (ICSD PDF card no. 01-071-1211), suggesting the formation of pure tetragonal phase NCs. The sharp patterns clearly imply the formation of highly crystalline materials, which are prerequisite for intense emission from Eu3+-doped materials. After oleic acid removal, bare Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs show similar PXRD pattern to oleic acid capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs (see Fig. S1†). The phase of the NCs is preserved after the removal of OA from the NC surface as well as after the attachment of TPB ligands to the bare NCs. This is supported by hardly any change in the XRD pattern of TPB capped LiYF4 NCs. The LiYF4 NCs crystallize in the tetragonal phase with the I41/a space group. The lattice constants of tetragonal LiYF4 NCs were found to be a = b = 5.1005 Å, c = 10.5564 Å. These values match well with the standard values a = b = 5.1335 Å, c = 10.5880 Å for bulk LiYF4. The slight change in the a and b values could be due to the larger ionic radii of the dopant ions, Eu3+ (r = 1.066 Å), compared to the Y3+ ions (r = 1.019 Å). The structure of the tetragonal unit cell of LiYF4 is shown in Fig. 1b, which was drawn using the Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis (VESTA) program using the lattice parameters obtained from XRD diffraction measurements and the atomic coordinates from the literature.41 The coordination of Y3+ ions along with the positions of F− ions are shown in the unit cell structure. The Y3+ ions are surrounded by eight fluoride ions that form the edges of a slightly distorted dodecahedron.

Morphological analysis of the oleic acid capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs, bare Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs, and TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs was performed using transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The TEM image of oleic acid capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs shown in Fig. 2A clearly indicates the formation of a diamond shaped morphology with an average aspect ratio of 2.25 (length ∼90 nm and breadth ∼40 nm).

After the removal of oleic acid, LiYF4 NCs tend to agglomerate into larger particles (Fig. 2B). However, it is interesting to note that after the attachment of the TPB ligand to the bare NCs, the dispersity was improved and the morphology of the NCs was slightly changed from diamond to oval with an aspect ratio of 1.5 (length ∼90 nm and breadth ∼60 nm). The TEM images of these particles are shown in Fig. 2C and D. We presume that the slight change in morphology and the increase in size are likely due to secondary growth (similar to Oswald's ripening). It is likely that some smaller nanoparticles get dissolved and attached to the existing larger nanoparticles. This is supported by the increase in breadth as well as the change in shape from diamond to oval. We believe that this is due to the high reactivity of the sharp edge of diamond shaped LiYF4 NCs as they are expected to possess a high reactivity. The attachment of the TPB ligand onto the surface of the NCs is supported by the increased dispersibility of the NCs in water. The capping of the oleate molecules to the surface of the NCs, the removal of the oleate ligands from NCs and the further capping of the NCs with TPB molecules are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements. The FTIR spectra of the abovementioned nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear from the spectra that the peak at 1715 cm−1 observed for free oleic acid shifts to a lower wavenumber (1556 cm−1) for oleate capped NCs, indicating that the COO− groups of oleic acid are bound to the surface of the NCs.51 No characteristic FTIR peak of OA was observed for bare LiYF4 NCs, confirming the removal of oleate ligands from the surface. After capping TPB ligands to bare NCs, it is clear that the peak at 1625 cm−1 observed for free TPB shifts to lower wavenumber (1595 cm−1), indicating that the >CO groups of TPB are bound to the surface of the NCs.

Optical properties
Photoluminescence (PL) studies have been carried out for the colloidal TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs in water (1 wt%). Upon excitation at 365 nm, the NC dispersion shows intense emission bands at 580 nm, 591 nm, 614 nm, 651 nm, and 692 nm which are assigned to 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3 and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions, respectively.43 The emission bands at 580 and 651 nm are weak as their corresponding 5D0 → 7F0 and 5D0 → 7F3 transitions are forbidden by electric dipole transitions.44 The 5D0 → 7F2 transition is an induced electric dipole transition and its corresponding intense emission at 615 nm is very sensitive to the coordination environment. The high intensity of the 615 nm peak indicates that the environment around the Eu3+ ions is highly polarizable. Fig. 4a shows the comparison of the emission spectra of TPB capped 5 mol% Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NC dispersion, excited at 365 nm (via ligands), and bare Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NC dispersion, excited at 394 nm (via direct excitation), in water. We believe that the intense red emission from TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NC dispersion is due to energy transfer from the TPB ligands to the Eu3+ ions. The energy transfer is verified from the excitation spectra of TPB capped NCs, which show a broad band centered at 365 nm (see Fig. 4b). This peak is characteristic of the TPB ligand and verifies the occurrence of energy transfer from the ligands to the excited levels of the Eu3+ energy levels. In addition, under identical conditions, the excitation spectrum of Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs shows only a weak Eu3+ ion excitation band at ∼394 nm. We believe that the efficient energy transfer from the TPB to the Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs is likely due to the FRET. This is supported by the overlap between the phosphorescence emission spectrum of the TPB and the excitation spectrum of the Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs (shown in Fig. S2†). For further understanding, we have calculated the relative quantum yields of bare Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs and TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs. The quantum yield was determined by using quinine-sulphate as a reference standard.
 Fig. 4  (a) The emission spectrum of 5 mol% Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs, λex = 394 (black trace), and TPB capped Eu3+ doped LiYF4 NCs, λex = 365 nm (red trace). The inset shows the digital image of the TPB capped NCs in a UV chamber, λex = 366 nm. (b) The excitation spectra of 5 mol% Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs, λem = 615 (red trace) and TPB capped Eu3+ doped LiYF4 NCs, λem = 615 nm (black trace). The PL was measured with 1 wt% colloidal dispersion of the NCs. 
The calculated quantum yield was about 5% for Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs and 31% for TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs (for details see the ESI†). For a better understanding, we have measured the lifetimes of Eu3+ ions in TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs upon 365 nm excitation and monitored the emission at 615 nm. The Eu3+ ion lifetimes upon 365 nm excitation have biexponential fitting and the R square value is 0.998, which shows the goodness of fit. From this fitting we observed two lifetime values, namely 0.9135 ms (47%) and 0.2057 ms (53%). We believe that the 0.9135 ms lifetime is likely due to direct population of the 5D4 energy levels (λexi = 365 nm) of Eu3+ ions which are present in the core of the NCs and the shorter lifetime is presumably due to the energy transfer from TPB ligands to 5D1 energy levels of Eu3+ ions. To verify our interpretation, we measured the lifetimes of the bare Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs as well as the Eu3+-TPB complex by excitation at 394 nm and monitored the emission at 615 nm. The lifetime of the Eu3+ ions is 1.4 ms with an R square value of 0.98. The decay curves are shown in Fig. S4.† The lifetime of the Eu3+-TPB complex is 0.119 with an R square value of 0.98. The faster decay in the case of TPB-capped nanocrystals is due to the presence of multiple C–F vibrations in the ligands and the presence of Eu3+ ions near the surface of the nanocrystals, where the probability of non-radiative decay for the excited Eu3+ ions is high. The slight difference in the Eu3+ lifetimes between the bare and TPB capped nanocrystals is likely ascribed to the difference in the environment around the Eu3+ ions.
We have measured the absorbance of TPB ligands and TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs in water, and the results are shown in Fig. S5.† TPB ligands show intense and broad absorbance in the UV region. A strong absorbance from TPB ligands is observed due to conjugation between oxygen lone pair electrons and the phenyl π-electrons in the β-diketonate ligand system. The absorbance spectrum of TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs show similar patterns of TPB ligands and there is hardly any absorbance in the visible region. This also supports the capping of TPB ligands onto the surface of LiYF4 NCs.
The proposed energy transfer mechanism between TPB ligands and Eu3+ ions is schematically shown in Fig. 5. Upon 365 nm excitation, TPB ligands get excited from S0 to S1 levels. An energy transfer occurs from S1 to T1via intersystem crossing (ISC). Subsequently, energy transfer from T1 to 5D1 levels of Eu3+ ions occurs via FRET. Nonradiative relaxation from 5D1 levels populates the emitting 5D0 energy levels of Eu3+ ions. A radiative energy transfer occurs from the 5D0 energy levels of Eu3+ ions to the 7FJ = 0 to 6 energy levels, resulting in emissions at 580 nm, 591 nm, 614 nm, 651 nm and 692 nm, respectively.

Improvement of the silicon solar cell efficiency
The broad UV absorbance and intense red emission of the TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs were used to enhance Si solar cell efficiency. As prepared NCs were used as down-shifting NCs and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) was chosen as a polymeric matrix which is generally used in the encapsulation process of commercial photovoltaic systems. The polymeric solution consisting of 1.5 wt% EVA in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and as prepared NCs was deposited on a quartz slide (2 × 2 cm2) by a spin-coating method (1000 rpm for 10 s). The above developed quartz slide was used as a protective transparent sheet for the realization of a laboratory based mini module with a single Si cell (2 × 2 cm2). The possible enhancement of photocurrent conversion efficiency due to the down-shifting process of the absorbed light of the solar cell module was tested by analyzing the I–V measurements. The I–V characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G conditions using a Thermo Oriel solar simulator with a power density of 1 sun (i.e., 100 mW cm−2) and a Keithley source meter. A schematic representation of the device structure and the working principle is shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of the device set up with down-shifting NCs. 
The comparison of I–V measurements (under Air Mass 1.5 conditions) between NC embedded EVA films and blank EVA films confirm the enhancement of the short circuit current (Isc) of the solar cell, which is shown in Fig. 7. We observed a relative enhancement of Isc in the presence of TPB capped Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NC embedded EVA polymeric films. The AFM images show that the NCs in the polymeric film are well dispersed and the thickness of the film is around 2 μm (see Fig. S6†). Fig. 7a and b present the I–V measurements of the solar cell under simulated sun light and using a UV cut-off filter (275–375 nm, FGUV11, Thorlabs), respectively. The mechanism of the down-shifting process is as follows: first, UV light gets absorbed by NCs and emits the red light (from Eu3+ ions), which is subsequently absorbed by the Si solar cell and creates extra electron–hole pairs inside the solar cell. These electron–hole pairs constitute the relative enhancement of photocurrent of the cell. The observed relative enhancement of Isc using a UV filter is ∼9%, while it is ∼2% when measured under simulated white light.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this work demonstrates a strategy to enhance Si solar cell efficiency via sensitization of Eu3+ ion luminescence. This is achieved by first attaching 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione (TPB) to the surface of Eu3+-doped LiYF4 NCs via a ligand exchange process. Due to the overlap between UV absorbance of the TPB ligand and the excited energy levels of Eu3+, efficient energy transfer from the TPB ligand to Eu3+ ions results in intense red emission with a relative yield of about 31% compared to the 5% obtained via direct excitation of the Eu3+ ions in Eu-doped LiYF4 nanocrsytals. We utilized this result for the enhancement of the silicon solar cell efficiency by embedding these nanocrystals on a Si solar cell. A relative enhancement (∼9%) in the photocurrent is noted. We believe that further enhancement in the value might be possible by choosing suitable sensitizers or multiple sensitizers absorbing in different regions and appropriate Ln3+ ions for energy conversion.
