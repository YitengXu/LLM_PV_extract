    , Accepted 6th May 2020First published on 6th May 2020AbstractIn order to study the relationship between the molecular structures of compact electron donor/acceptor dyads and the spin–orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) efficiency, we prepared a perylene (Pery)–naphthalimide (NI) dyad, in which the Pery unit is the electron donor and the NI unit is the electron acceptor, where the two units adopt an almost orthogonal geometry. The photophysical properties of the dyad were studied with steady state and femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption (fs TA and ns TA) spectroscopies, time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy and DFT computations. A very weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed, but the fluorescence of the Pery unit is strongly quenched. Upon selective excitation into the NI unit, the fast intramolecular CS process (10 ps) occurs, followed by ISC and only the 3Pery* state is observed; whereas upon selective photoexcitation into the perylene unit, an ultrafast charge separation (0.66 ps) is observed, followed by SOCT-ISC (8 ns) to populate the 3Pery* state. Moreover, the perylene radical cation is also observed on the ns timescale, presumably formed by intermolecular charge transfer. The lifetime of the 3Pery triplet state was determined to be τT = 214 μs with ns TA spectroscopy. The singlet oxygen quantum yield was measured as ΦΔ = 80%, although the potential energy curve of the torsion between the donor and acceptor is shallow. The SOCT-ISC mechanism was confirmed by TREPR spectroscopy. The dyad was used as a triplet photosensitizer for the generation of delayed fluorescence (luminescence lifetime τDF = 57.3 μs).
Introduction
The formation of long-lived triplet excited states is of fundamental importance for photosynthesis,1,2 photocatalysis,3–6 photovoltaics,7–9 photodynamic therapy10–13 and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion.14–22 An efficient triplet photosensitizer (PS) should possess several photophysical properties such as strong light absorption, efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and long triplet lifetime.23 The most straightforward approach to enhance ISC in organic compounds is the heavy atom effect (based on I, Br, Pt, Ir, Os atoms, etc.).23–27 However, this method suffers from some drawbacks, such as complicated synthesis routes, costly preparation and toxicity. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop novel heavy atom-free molecules with efficient ISC. Other than the heavy atom effect for enhancing ISC, a few other approaches have been reported. For instance, exciton coupling,28 radical pair ISC (RP-ISC) or charge recombination (CR)-induced ISC,29,30 electron spin conversion31 and radical enhanced ISC (REISC).32 Furthermore, molecules with the n–π* ↔ π–π* transition are also known to exhibit efficient ISC production (the EL-Sayed rule).33 The main challenge of all these approaches is the difficult synthesis and the difficulty in predicting the ISC ability.
RP-ISC is known for weakly coupled electron donor–acceptor systems. In this case, photoexcitation of either the electron donor or the acceptor induces an electron transfer from the donor to acceptor moiety with the formation of charge separated states (CSS).29,34,35 The triplet formation involves the ISC among CS state 1CS → 3CS promoted by hyperfine coupling interactions (HFI), followed by the rapid decay of the 3CS to the 3LE state. However, the ISC efficiency of these systems is usually low, which is a major disadvantage of this approach. Moreover, the synthesis of these dyads is difficult, thus it is highly desired to develop a simple molecular structure profile for electron donor/acceptor dyads to attain efficient ISC.
Recently, the production of triplet states through the so-called spin orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT-ISC) mechanism in compact electron donor/acceptor systems has attained much consideration.36–41 In these systems, the linker between the electron donor and acceptor is short, and the two moieties are preferably arranged in an orthogonal geometry with each other (different from the conventional donor/acceptor dyads with long and rigid linkers showing RP-ISC). For these compact dyads, the RP-ISC mechanism is inhibited due to large electron exchange (J values). In SOCT-ISC, electron transfer between perpendicularly oriented donor/acceptor units is accompanied by a change in the molecular orbital angular momentum, which generates a magnetic torque able to flip the electron spin. As a result, the change in molecular orbital angular momentum compensates the change in the electron spin angular momentum, facilitating the ISC process.36–39,41–43
Although the occurrence of SOCT-ISC has been demonstrated in several compact electron donor/acceptor dyads, still much room is left to fully understand this mechanism. Up to now, only a limited number of visible-light-harvesting chromophores have been used for SOCT-ISC, such as anthracene,37 Bodipy40a and perylenebisimide.44 Different from Bodipy chromophores,45 we show that perylene is unique concerning SOCT-ISC dyads, because it can be used as either the electron donor or acceptor to achieve SOCT-ISC.44,46 Different electron donors may offer different driving forces for CS, and the geometric restriction may increase the ISC efficiency. It was previously proposed that in the case of Bodipy, SOCT-ISC occurs for dyads with Bodipy as the electron acceptor, but not for dyads with Bodipy as the electron donor.45 However, it is still in doubt whether or not this rule is applicable to other chromophores. Recently, we have investigated the SOCT-ISC in orthogonal perylene–phenothiazine dyads with the perylene unit as the electron acceptor, which showed excellent triplet formation.46 In perylene–Bodipy dyads, the perylene unit is the electron donor, and efficient SOCT-ISC was observed.44 In a NI-PTZ dyad, we observed a long-lived 3CT state.40b More evidence is required to evaluate the limitation on the role that a chromophore can play in the electron donor/acceptor dyads.
In order to address the above challenges, we prepared a compact electron donor/acceptor dyad, with perylene as the electron donor/visible light-harvesting chromophore and naphthalimide (NI) as the electron acceptor (Scheme 1). In this system, the SOCT-ISC can be efficient, given that the geometry of the electron donor/acceptor is nearly orthogonal. We studied the photophysics of the dyad using steady state and femtosecond, subnanosecond and nanosecond time-resolved transient spectroscopies. Efficient formation of the 3LE state of the perylene moiety is confirmed. We found that the photophysics of the dyad is excitation wavelength-dependent. Upon selective photoexcitation into the NI unit, only the 3Pery* state is populated. On the other hand, photoexcitation into the perylene unit promotes the formation of a perylene radical cation via intermolecular charge separation, as well as the 3Pery* state. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy was used to study the electron spin polarization (ESP) of the triplet states. We confirmed the SOCT-ISC mechanism showing that the observed ESP and population ratio of sublevels of the triplet state (TX, TY, TZ) are different from those of the SO-ISC mechanism. Additionally, delayed fluorescence was observed with the dyad as the triplet PS and perylenebisimide (PBI) and Solvent Green 5 (SG-5) as triplet acceptors/emitters.

Results and discussion
Design rationales of the Pery-NI compact electron donor/acceptor dyad
NI is a typical electron acceptor, and has been used widely in the conventional electron donor/acceptor dyads where the donor and acceptor had large separation.47–49 On the other hand, arenes can be used as electron donors.50–52 We prepared a Pery-NI compact electron donor/acceptor dyad (Scheme 1). The mutual orientation of the two chromophores is expected to be orthogonal, due to the conformation restrictions. The dyad was prepared by direct connection of the perylene unit and the NI moiety with the Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling reaction. The yield was satisfactory, and the molecular structure of the product was fully verified with 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS. Pery-Ph and NI-Ph were prepared as reference compounds for the photophysical studies.
UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the compounds are reported in Fig. 1a. Perylene shows the characteristic absorption band at 437 nm with a significant vibrational progression. For Pery-Ph, a slightly red-shifted absorption band is observed, while for Pery-NI, a tail at the red-end of the absorption spectrum is observed, which is assigned to a weak CT absorption band, indicating a limited electronic coupling due to the freedom of the torsion in Pery-NI.26 Furthermore, inhomogeneous broadening due to the presence of slightly different conformations of the dyad in the solution, as a result of the partial rotation around the C–C single bond connecting the two moieties, could also contribute to broaden the absorption spectrum. In the UV region, the absorption band at 340 nm is attributed to the NI moiety, as demonstrated by the UV-vis absorption of NI-Ph. This result also indicates that the π-conjugation between the NI and the perylene unit is limited in Pery-NI.53,54

The fluorescence spectra of the compounds measured in dichloromethane (DCM) are shown in Fig. 1b and c. The spectra shown in Fig. 1b are registered upon excitation at 391 nm, where perylene absorbs. In this case, a fluorescence emission band centered at 443 nm, with significant vibrational progression, was observed for both perylene (fluorescence quantum yield ΦF = 94%. Table 1) and Pery-Ph. For Pery-NI, however, the fluorescence of both the NI and the perylene units is almost completely quenched. Only a very weak broad emission band centered at about 650 nm is observed, which is assigned to a CT emissive band.

Since the perylene S1 state (2.79 eV) is lower than the S1 state of NI (3.64 eV), Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) would result as an uphill energy process upon excitation of perylene, so that other reasons should be considered to explain the observed fluorescence quenching of Pery-NI upon selective excitation of the perylene unit. One possibility is photo-induced electron transfer to form the charge separated state (CSS) Pery+˙-NI−˙.46 It is noteworthy to mention here that, in the electron transfer process, the perylene moiety acts as the electron donor and NI is the electron acceptor (see the next section).
The fluorescence of Pery-NI is also quenched upon excitation of the NI moiety at 323 nm (Fig. 1c, note the perylene fluorescence was also quenched). In this case, the lack of NI fluorescence could be attributed to several processes, such as ISC, FRET to the perylene moiety,55 or formation of a CSS. Among these possibilities FRET from NI (energy donor) to perylene (energy acceptor) should certainly be considered, since, according to the estimation of the Förster radius (R0) of the dyad (see the ESI†) this process is expected to be very efficient (FRET efficiency is estimated to be 96% and the Förster radius is 6.668 Å). The backward FRET (Pery → NI) is not possible due to the large S1 state energy difference of perylene and NI moieties, as mentioned above. However, the lack of perylene fluorescence for Pery-NI, which should act as energy acceptor in the FRET process upon selective photoexcitation of NI, implies that also other processes should have taken place. A possible reason for fluorescence quenching is again photoinduced electron transfer, which could occur also in the case of NI excitation.
To further investigate the photophysics of our systems, we analyzed the solvent polarity dependence of the fluorescence (Fig. 2). For Pery-NI, the fluorescence emission intensity upon NI excitation is highly dependent on the solvent polarity (Fig. 2a). The emission intensity in toluene is only half of that in n-hexane (note optically matched solutions were used, thus the fluorescence emission intensity can be compared directly) and it is quenched in solvents with medium polarity, for instance DCM. In acetonitrile (ACN), the fluorescence is almost completely quenched. These results imply that FRET and CS are competitive processes, with the first prevailing in non-polar media, and the latter becoming predominant in polar solvents.

(f) Lippert–Mataga plots based on the solvatochromic shift of the energy related to the fluorescence maxima in different solvents (respective solvents are mentioned in each panel). 
For NI-Ph, interestingly, the fluorescence emission band is slightly red-shifted in polar solvents, and the emission intensity is increased (Fig. 2b). This intensified fluorescence in polar solvents is anomalous. It is known that NI has ISC ability, due to the n–π* → π–π* transition.56 The solvent polarity may change the energy of the n–π* state, and thus the relative energy of the states. As a result, the fluorescence of NI-Ph will change together with the ISC efficiency in different solvents.56 The detailed photophysical parameters of the compounds are presented in Table 1.
For Pery-Ph, the fluorescence emission profile hardly changed in different solvents (Fig. 2c), which is in stark contrast to that for Pery-NI. This result indicates that the dipole moment of the emissive (bright) singlet excited state of Pery-Ph is small. In order to quantify the change in the dipole moment of the emissive singlet excited states of the compounds upon photoexcitation, the effect of the solvent polarity on the emission band were studied in detail and analyzed with the Lippert–Mataga plots (Fig. 2d–f). The excited state dipole moments (μe) of Pery-NI and NI-Ph were determined by the fluorescence solvatochromic shift method using eqn (1) and (2).37,57 (1) (2)where hcCTflu is the energy related to the position of the CT fluorescence maxima,  and  are the dipole moments of the molecules in the excited and ground states, respectively, a0 is the effective radius of Onsager's cavity, and ε and η are the static dielectric constant and the refractive index of the solvent respectively. Linear plots were obtained for the two compounds, from which it is observed that the dipole moment of the emissive singlet excited state of Pery-NI (29.3 ± 2 D) is much larger than that of NI-Ph (16.9 ± 2 D), while the ground state dipole moment (approximated from the optimized ground state geometry by DFT calculations) is almost similar for both compounds, being 5.6 D and 5.4 D for Pery-NI and NI-Ph respectively, which justifies the different behavior of their emission profiles.
Electrochemical studies: Gibbs free energy change of the charge separation and the energy levels of the CS states
The redox properties of the compounds were studied (Fig. 3). Pery-Ph shows a reversible oxidation wave at +0.54 V, while no reduction wave was observed (Fig. 3c). For NI-Ph, a quasi-reversible reduction wave was observed at –1.83 V, and no oxidation wave was observed in the potential range used (Fig. 3b).

For Pery-NI, a reversible oxidation wave at +0.64 V and a quasi-reversible reduction wave at −1.82 V were observed (Fig. 3a), which are assigned to the oxidation of the perylene unit and the reduction of the NI moiety, respectively. Thus, for Pery-NI upon photoexcitation, the perylene unit will act as the electron donor and NI as the electron acceptor. The Gibbs free energy changes of the photo-induced electron transfer were calculated; further details are given in the ESI.† The data show that the CS for Pery-NI is allowed in polar solvents, see Table 2, and ΔG0CS values in different solvents are as follows, +0.06 eV (in toluene), −0.33 (in DCM) and –0.59 (in ACN). Moreover, the CS state energy is solvent polarity dependent. The same trend was observed for perylene–phenothiazine46 and Julolidine–anthracene dyads.37

Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
The dynamic evolution of the excited states in Pery-NI has been studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with 400 nm excitation, where absorption is mostly due to the perylene moiety. The transient spectra were acquired in DCM with a time interval spanning up to 1.5 ns and analysed using singular value decomposition (SVD) and global fitting to obtain the Evolution Associated Difference Spectra (EADS). To have a reference, we also measured the ultrafast transient absorption spectra of Pery-Ph (Fig. S18, ESI†). For this compound, an excited state absorption (ESA) band centred at 708 nm (S1 → Sn transitions) and ground state bleaching (GSB) band centred at 450 nm were observed. Moreover, a stimulated emission (SE) band was observed in the range from 480 nm to 535 nm. All these bands are typical signatures of the singlet excited state of perylene and no obvious ISC was observed for this compound.
For Pery-NI, a GSB band at 445 nm and an ESA band extending up to 700 nm, previously assigned to an S1 → Sn absorption of the perylene,46 were initially observed (Fig. 4a). A band centred at 553 nm rapidly appeared, similar to that observed in the ns-TA spectra, where it has been assigned to the perylene radical cation.50 Previously, it was reported that the NI radical anion shows absorption at 420 nm (ε = 23500 M−1 cm−1) and 491 nm (ε = 3000 M−1 cm−1).58 In this case NI anion bands are not clearly visible since they may overlap with negative GSB bands. Global analysis allows extraction of the timescale of the spectral evolution. The first EADS (Fig. 4b, black line) shows the occurrence of partial ultrafast CS, with the appearance of the GSB band and a positive band at 570 nm, which can be assigned to the perylene cation, besides a broad tail extending up to 750 nm, due to the residual absorption of the neutral perylene excited state.
 Fig. 4  (a) Femtosecond transient absorption spectra of Pery-NI in the 0.1 ps to 1.5 ns time range, in DCM with the excitation at 400 nm. (b) Evolution associated difference spectra (EADS) obtained from global analysis. (c) Kinetic traces at the maxima of the perylene cation band at 550 nm in DCM and ACN; and ESA of triplet perylene at 490 nm in toluene. Black lines represent the fitting obtained from global analysis. 
In the following evolution, occurring in 0.66 ps, the positive band due to the perylene cation increases in intensity and blue shifts to 553 nm, while the ESA band of the perylene singlet excited state at 700 nm decays completely. The perylene cation band slightly blue shifts on a timescale of 13.5 ps (red to blue evolution in Fig. 4b), due to vibrational cooling. The transient spectra show limited evolution at the following time interval (1.5 ns), indicating that the charge separated state has a lifetime >1.5 ns so that triplet production is not observed during this short delay time. This result confirms that the 3Pery* state is populated after the CS process.
In order to analyse the solvent dependence of CS and triplet production, toluene and acetonitrile were also used as solvents. In toluene, a stimulated emission band at 530 nm appears, whose position matches that of the dyad fluorescence observed in this solvent, and is due to the stimulated emission of perylene, which is directly excited at 400 nm. The SE band is superimposed to the positive signal of the perylene cation which starts to rise in about 6 ps (Fig. S19, ESI†). This result shows that charge separation partially occurs also in this non polar solvent, although with slow kinetics and lower yield, as demonstrated by the persistence of the ESA band assigned to the neutral perylene singlet excited state up to the nanosecond timescale. In ACN, the appearance of an intense positive band at 550 nm, due to the formation of the perylene cation occurs in less than 1 ps, indicating fast CS (Fig. S20, ESI†), while the triplet state production was not observed. In this case, the transient signal recovers within about 650 ps, due to CR (Fig. S20, ESI†). The occurrence of fast CR in acetonitrile agrees with the lack of triplet formation observed on the nanosecond–microsecond timescale in this solvent. Selected kinetic traces are reported in Fig. 4c for three solvents.
Finally, we also studied the dynamics of NI-Ph (Fig. S21, ESI†). In this case, a broad ESA band with a dip at about 550 nm, due to superimposed stimulated emission, was observed. The transient signal showed no significant evolution up to the nanosecond timescale, and the limited decay of the kinetic traces indicated a long lived excited state.
Subnanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
In order to reveal more details of the photophysical properties of the compounds, subnanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy upon selective photoexcitation was performed. Firstly, compound 2 (3-bromoperylene) was investigated. A sharp ESA band centered at about 702 nm (S1 → Sn transitions) and stimulated emission at about 478 nm were observed. The ESA band decayed within 10 ns and a new band at about 500 nm appeared, which is the ESA band of the triplet state of perylene (T1 → Tn transitions) populated by a heavy atom effect. The triplet state lifetime is ca. 500 ns (in deaerated solution, Fig. S22, ESI†).

Pery-NI was excited at 430 nm (perylene absorption band), showing an ultrafast CS process (i.e. < 10 ps), as also confirmed in fs-TA spectra. The formation of a perylene radical cation is confirmed, indicated by the absorption band centered at 550 nm (Fig. 5a).50 Moreover, a band at about 500 nm was observed to rise, which is attributed to the ESA of the perylene-localized triplet state,59 in good agreement with our ns-TA observation (Fig. 6). As mentioned in the fs-TA section, the NI radical anion bands should appear at 420 and 490 nm.58 In sub-nanosecond spectra they may overlap with ESA of 3Pery* or be covered by laser scattering at 433 nm (Fig. 5a). The decay kinetics of the bands assigned to 3Pery* and the perylene radical cation are presented in Fig. 5b. The ISC rate constant is extracted from the growth of the triplet state signal at 500 nm, and determined as 8 ns. The triplet state at 500 nm decays in ca. 300 ns in the presence of O2.

Note: the sharp signal centred at 433 nm in (a) is due to laser scattering. (c) Subnanosecond transient absorption spectra (extracted at different time delays) of Pery-NI after 340 nm excitation, and (d) the respective kinetics decay trace at 500 and 550 nm.

Exciting Pery-NI at 340 nm would preferentially excite the NI part (Fig. 5c). In this case, fast FRET towards the perylene is expected to occur. Within the time resolution of our sub-nanosecond measurement we nevertheless observe the band at 550 nm due to Pery+˙, and, within 20 ns, the rise of the ESA band at 500 nm assigned to the localized triplet state of perylene. The observation of the Pery+˙ band agrees with the fluorescence measurements reported in the previous section, showing the quenching of perylene fluorescence in slightly polar and polar solvents, and suggests that FRET can occur on a fast time scale, rapidly followed by charge separation. In ns-TA, with this excitation wavelength, we only observed the triplet state of perylene, but the radical cation band may be very weak (Fig. 9a), rising within our instrument response function (IRF is ca. 10 ns for the nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer, LP980).
In sub-nanosecond measurements with NI excitation, the band at 550 nm is due to a CS state because the perylene moiety cannot be excited at this excitation wavelength. The lifetime of this short-lived CS species is ca. 10 ns (in oxygen), which supports the excitation dependent photophysics of Pery-NI observed in nanosecond transient absorption spectra (Fig. 6 and 9). Indeed, CS occurs within 10 ps (time resolution of sub-nanosecond measurements), and it should be in competition with FRET to the perylene moiety.
For NI-Ph, upon 350 nm laser excitation, a sharp ESA band at about 500 nm appeared (Fig. S23, ESI†), which became broader at later times by spanning up to 700 nm, this is typical triplet state absorption of the NI moiety. During the later time delays these signals became negative; this could be due to room temperature phosphorescence of this compound.49 The decay kinetics of transient species were monitored at 435 nm and 500 nm to investigate the ISC process. ISC takes ca. 10 ns and then the triplet state decays to the ground state at long delay time. Notably here the measurements were carried out in toluene.
Singlet oxygen photosensitizing and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy: observation of the triplet state
We have shown that the fluorescence of the perylene moiety in the Pery-NI dyad is significantly quenched, especially in polar solvents which can be due to excited state depopulation to the S0 state directly or to the formation of a triplet state, via the SOCT-ISC mechanism.36,37,60–63 Firstly we studied the singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitizing ability of the compounds and the singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) are summarized in Table 3.

Pery-NI shows the highest ΦΔ in DCM (80%), in agreement with its low fluorescence quantum yield in this solvent, but the value is much smaller in toluene (ΦΔ = 11%). In n-hexane and acetonitrile, no 1O2 production was observed. Thus, the 1O2 production, which is correlated with the triplet state quantum yield of Pery-NI, is highly dependent on the solvent polarity, which is a characteristic of SOCT-ISC. For Pery-Ph, only a weak 1O2 production was observed in DCM (7%), and no singlet oxygen production was observed in other solvents. For NI-Ph, the highest singlet oxygen production was observed in n-hexane (72%), and ΦΔ values are smaller in other solvents.
Previously we demonstrated that the perylene–phenothiazine dyads, in which the perylene moiety is an electron acceptor, shows efficient ISC.46 Thus, we conclude that the perylene chromophore shows efficient SOCT-ISC in dyads with the perylene unit as either the electron donor or acceptor. This behavior is different from that observed for Bodipy containing dyads, for which only those with Bodipy as the electron acceptor were found to show efficient SOCT-ISC.45 Our results show that there is no general limitation for a chromophore to play a specific role as an electron donor or acceptor in the dyad to achieve efficient SOCT-ISC.
It is known that the ISC of the NI moiety is due to S1 → T4, a π–π* → n–π* transition.64 Since the n–π* state energy is more sensitive to the solvent polarity than the π–π* state, the energy matching of the n–π* and π–π* states of NI-Ph is solvent polarity-dependent, and the ISC efficiency of NI-Ph can be solvent polarity-dependent. For Pery-NI, however, the ISC is not due to the NI moiety, because we were selectively exciting the perylene. In order to unambiguously confirm the formation of the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation, nanosecond transient absorption spectra of Pery-NI were recorded (Fig. 6a).
The promptly observed ESA band in the range of 400–550 nm is the typical feature of the triplet state of perylene (T1 → Tn transitions).59 However, we found that at longer delay time, this band almost completely recovers, while a positive absorption band centered at 553 nm is persistent. It was previously reported that the NI radical anion shows absorption at 420 nm (ε = 23500 M−1 cm−1) and 491 nm (ε = 3000 M−1 cm−1).58 On the other hand, the perylene radical cation absorption was reported to be centered at 550 nm (ε = 27000 M−1 cm−1).50 Based on the TA spectra (Fig. 6a), we propose that both the triplet state of perylene (3Pery*) and its radical cation are observed in the transient spectra, thus assigning the long-lived band at 553 nm to the perylene radical cation (Pery+˙).
In order to obtain the decay kinetics of the perylene triplet state and the cation band, the decay traces at 493 nm and 553 nm were monitored (Fig. 6b and c). The perylene triplet state lifetime was found to be 214 μs, while the observed lifetime for the cation band at 553 nm is 752 μs. Note that there is no growth phase detected for the transient at 553 nm (IRF of the nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer is ca. 10 ns). According to the decay traces of 3Pery* and Pery+˙, we propose that the 3Pery* state is not the precursor of the perylene cation because we did not observe any growth of the cation band and interconversion among the two, i.e. they are formed separately, and simultaneously (with time constant < 10 ns).65
To confirm the identity of the transient species giving absorption at 553 nm, we carried out the nanosecond transient absorption measurements also in aerated solution (Fig. 7). In this case the triplet state will be substantially quenched, due to its sensitivity to O2.66 In some cases the quenching of the anion can also be observed,67 however, the cation absorption should not be quenched by O2.
 Fig. 7  Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of (a) Pery-NI and (b) decay trace at 553 nm. λex = 445 nm. c = 5.0 × 10−6 M. In aerated DCM. 20 °C. 
Indeed, in aerated solution, the strong triplet state signal at 493 nm was quenched, but the perylene cation absorption at 553 nm was persistent (Fig. 7a), and showed a lifetime of 689 μs, which is very close to that determined in deaerated solution (752 μs, Fig. 6c).
The nanosecond transient absorption spectra of Pery-NI were also studied in solvents with different polarity, toluene and ACN (see the ESI,† Fig. S24 and S25). The perylene localized triplet state was observed in both the solvents, while no ESA band centered at 553 nm was observed. In ACN the signals were very weak due to the low ISC ability.
To further analyze the above observation, we did some control experiments with pristine perylene in different polarity solvents (toluene, DCM and ACN) under aerated and deaerated conditions. In DCM, a transient band centered at 545 nm was observed (Fig. 8), which is similar to that seen for Pery-NI under deaerated and aerated conditions (results under aerated conditions are given in Fig. S26, ESI†). Similar results were observed in ACN, while in the case of toluene no transient signals were detected. Previously, the simultaneous formation of a perylene radical cation and anion was observed upon flash excitation of perylene in polar solutions.68 Thus, we conclude that the observed band at 553 nm in Fig. 6 and 7 could be assigned to Pery+˙ formed in a similar fashion upon ns pulsed excitation.

In order to confirm that the electron transfer process in Pery-NI is either an intermolecular or intramolecular process, we used two different viscous solvents with different polarities, glycerin triacetate (triacetin, viscosity η = 23 cP, ET(30) = 40.4) and triethylene glycol (η = 47.8 cP, ET(30) = 52.8). In these solvents, compared with the results in DCM (η = 0.41 cP, ET(30) = 40.7), only the perylene triplet state was observed. From these measurements we conclude that the formation of a perylene cation in Pery-NI is due to an intermolecular electron transfer process on the ns timescale, while it is an intramolecular process on a faster timescale, preceding ISC (Fig. S27, ESI†).
Interestingly, by excitation into the NI unit in Pery-NI (λex = 355 nm), only the 3Pery* state was observed with nanosecond transient absorption (Fig. 9a and b). Thus, the photophysics is excitation wavelength-dependent, and most likely there is a competition between ISC, FRET, and CS processes. NI is known for its intrinsic ISC ability (for unsubstituted NI, ISC takes 10–20 ps).64

The nanosecond transient absorption spectra of NI-Ph were also studied (Fig. 9c and d). Two ESA bands in the range of 400–650 nm were observed, which are typical features of the NI triplet state.69 This result indicates that the triplet state of Pery-NI is always localized on the perylene moiety, which is determined by the relative triplet energy levels of perylene (1.53 eV)70,71 and NI (2.20 eV) moieties.72,73
For Pery-Ph, no apparent triplet excited state was observed upon photoexcitation, although a band at about 575 nm was observed in polar solvents (Fig. S28, ESI†). Therefore, we used the intermolecular triplet photosensitizing method to produce the triplet state by triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from 2,6-diiodobodipy (Scheme 1) to Pery-Ph. Triplet production was observed (Fig. S29, ESI†) with a lifetime of 76 μs.
Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy
To gain further insight into the ISC mechanism of Pery-NI, time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra were recorded (Fig. 10). TRPER spectroscopy is an important tool to study the triplet excited states, as well as the ISC mechanisms.29,37,46 Moreover, on the basis of zero field splitting parameters (ZFS), i.e. the D and E values, it is possible to differentiate the 3LE and 3CS states. To confirm the ISC mechanism of the dyad, the TREPR measurements were carried out in frozen solutions or a liquid crystal matrix at different temperatures varying from 80 K to 280 K (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  (a) TREPR spectra of compound 2 in toluene, Pery-NI in toluene and in toluene/MeTHF (3:1, v/v) mixed solution at 80 K. (b) TREPR spectra of Pery-NI in a liquid crystal matrix (E7) at different temperatures (80–280 K); following pulsed laser excitation at 445 nm, 10 mJ per pulse. Red lines are computer simulations and black curves are experimental TREPR spectra. The simulated parameters are given in Table 4. A stands for enhanced absorptive positive signal amplitudes and E stands for emissive negative amplitude polarization of the respective transition. 
Firstly, compound 2 (3-bromoperylene) was studied (Fig. 10a). The observed electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern is (e, e, e, a, a, a); simulation indicates the population of the triplet zero-field states TZ, TY and TX with relative rates of p1/p2/p3 = 0.000:0.400:0.600; the ESP is characteristic for the triplet state formed via the SO-ISC mechanism.46 The |D| and |E| parameters were determined as 1560 MHz and 105 MHz, respectively. The TREPR spectra of the Pery-NI dyad with excitation at 445 nm, measured in frozen solutions, are presented in Fig. 10a. The ESP of the TREPR spectrum of Pery-NI is (e, e, a, e, a, a), which is different from that of compound 2.
The ZFS parameter |D| value of Pery-NI was determined as 1652 MHz, only slightly changed in comparison with compound 2 (1560 MHz). This result indicates that the triplet state of the dyad is confined on the perylene moiety to a large extent. Furthermore, the |D| value of Pery-NI in solution and in crystal matrix even at different temperatures varied slightly, which confirmed the triplet state confinement. The triplet state spin density surface supports this assignment (Fig. S32, ESI†). The TREPR spectra of the triplet species were found to be almost similar in different solvents like toluene, or mixed toluene/MeTHF solution, (3:1, v/v).
For the Pery-NI dyad in a liquid crystal matrix (E7), within the temperature range from 80 K to 180 K an ESP phase pattern (e, e, a, e, a, a) was observed, while over the transition temperature of the liquid crystal E7 (210.6 K) the ESP pattern changed to (e, e, e, a, a, a). We propose that the change in the polarization of the ESP pattern is due to some change in the orientation of the molecules above the glass transition temperature of E7, not to an altered ISC mechanism. The TREPR spectra of Pery-NI at different temperatures (80 K to 280 K) measured in a liquid crystal matrix (E7), with complete simulation parameters, are presented in Fig. 10b and Table 4. TREPR spectra obtained after different sample orientations are shown in Fig. S30 and Table S1, ESI.† The RP-ISC mechanism can be excluded because no (a, e, e, a, a, e) or its inverse (e, a, a, e, e, a) ESP pattern was observed.37 We assume that the ISC mechanism in the Pery-NI dyad is SOCT-ISC; the absence of any heavy atom in Pery-NI and the solvent polarity dependent ISC efficiency support this conclusion.

DFT computations
The ground state geometries of the compounds were optimized with DFT computations (Fig. 11). For Pery-NI, the dihedral angle between the NI and the perylene moieties is 72.5°. Although it is not a perfect orthogonal geometry, still we observed a very high singlet oxygen quantum yield in DCM (80%, Table 3).
 Fig. 11  The dihedral angles (in degree) of compounds, based on optimized ground state geometries. Calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using Gaussian 09W. 
Although the orthogonal geometry will give the smallest steric hindrance, π-conjugation will decrease the electronic energy. This trend is significant with the reference compounds NI-Ph and Pery-Ph, for which the dihedral angles between the phenyl and the aryl moieties were found as ca. 54°.
Previously we studied the compact electron donor/acceptor dyads with perylene as the electron acceptor and phenothiazine as the electron donor.46 The dihedral angle between the electron donor and acceptor for that dyad is 90°, however, the singlet oxygen quantum yield is 60%. For the present dyad Pery-NI, although the dihedral angle is deviated from orthogonality, the singlet oxygen quantum yield is higher (80%). These results indicate that factors other than the orthogonal geometry also contribute to the SOCT-ISC efficiency.
The optimized ground state geometry of the dyad is not sufficient for acquiring the panoramic view of the energy landscape for the torsion between the electron donor and acceptor. Therefore, the potential energy curve of the torsion of the C–C linker between the NI and the perylene units was constructed (Fig. S31, ESI†) to evaluate the geometries accessible at room temperature. The PES in the dihedral angle range of 60°–120° is rather flat, indicating that the geometries accessible at room temperature are those within the range of ca. 54°–123°. This range is larger than that recently reported for perylene–phenothiazine dyads showing efficient SOCT-ISC (79°–103°).46 This finding further shows that different factors may affect the SOCT-ISC significantly.
The frontier molecular orbitals of the dyad and reference Pery-Ph are shown in Fig. 12. For Pery-NI, the HOMO is exclusively localized on the perylene moiety, and the LUMO is exclusively localized on the NI moiety. The S0 → S1 transition mainly involves HOMO → LUMO, thus charge separation is expected upon photoexcitation. Similarly, the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 are also localized molecular orbitals.
 Fig. 12  HOMO/LUMO energy levels of Pery-NI and Pery-Ph. Calculated at the (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) level with Gaussian 09W. 
The fully confined molecular orbitals may be the characteristics of electron donor/acceptor dyads showing efficient SOCT-ISC, this feature was found for Bodipy–phenothiazine dyads,40 Bodipy–anthracene dyads,38,39 and anthracene–phenothiazine dyads.74,75 Fully confined frontier molecular orbitals are beneficial for the conservation of the angular momentum of ISC. These factors may be useful for future design of the electron donor/acceptor dyads showing efficient SOCT-ISC.
The frontier molecular orbitals of Pery-Ph are more delocalized. The confinement of the triplet state wavefunction of the compounds was also studied (Fig. S32, ESI†). For Pery-NI, the triplet state is localized on the perylene unit to a large extent, but leakage of the spin to the NI moiety is also clear. For NI-Ph and Pery-Ph (reference compounds) the spin density is delocalized on NI and perylene moieties along with the phenyl ring respectively.
Based on the above studies, we propose the energy diagram and the photophysical processes of the Pery-NI dyad upon photoexcitation (Scheme 2). With excitation into the perylene part, fast CS will occur (0.66 ps), followed by SOCT-ISC, and the perylene triplet state is populated in 8 ns. Upon excitation into the NI unit, CS occurs within 10 ps probably in competition with FRET and 3Pery* is populated in 10 ns.

The energy levels of the excited singlet states are derived from spectroscopic data, and singlet charge separated state 1[Pery+˙-NI−˙] energy levels in toluene (TOL), dichloromethane (DCM) and acetonitrile (ACN) are obtained from the average of absorption and emission maxima. The triplet state energy levels are estimated by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level using Gaussian 09W. 
Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET)/triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) induced delayed fluorescence
To show the possible application of the compact electron donor/acceptor dyad as a triplet PS, Pery-NI was used for the generation of TTET/TTA-induced delayed fluorescence, with perylenebisimide (PBI) as the energy acceptor/emitter (Fig. 13). Upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitation, we observed the emission of PBI centered at 580 nm, which is long-lived (57.3 μs, Fig. 13a). This emission matches to the prompt fluorescence of PBI (Fig. S34a, ESI†). In order to monitor the kinetics of the TTA delayed fluorescence, the transient fluorescence signal at 580 nm was analyzed (Fig. 13c). Upon laser excitation, the delayed fluorescence raised in 5.2 μs and decayed with a time constant of 57.3 μs. The initial growth phase is due to the TTET between Pery-NI and PBI via the Dexter mechanism, causing the accumulation of the PBI triplet state. After reaching the maximal concentration, the decay of the PBI triplet becomes dominant, with a time constant of 57.3 μs, due to the TTA process, by which the emissive singlet state is produced with a probability of 11.1% (lower limit), according to the spin statistic law.15 Based on the intrinsic triplet state lifetimes and the quenched triplet state lifetimes of Pery-NI, the TTET efficiency was calculated as 86%.

(b) Contour map of the Pery-NI mixture with PBI and, (c) decay trace of the fluorescence at 580 nm in aerated and deaerated solutions. c = [Pery-NI] = 2.0 × 10−5 M and [PBI] = 4.0 × 10−5 M, in DCM. λex = 445 nm. The asterisks in (c) indicated the scattered laser. 
The delayed fluorescence was confirmed by excitation of sample solution under aerated conditions; in this case only a prompt fluorescence/laser scattering was observed, but no long-lived fluorescence emission was observed (note: with 445 nm excitation, a triplet energy acceptor (PBI) can also be excited). Similar results were observed with Solvent Green 5 (SG5) as the acceptor (Fig. S35, ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, a compact electron donor/acceptor dyad is prepared, in which perylene (Pery, electron donor) and naphthalimide (NI, electron acceptor) are connected with a single C–C bond. The geometry of the dyad is close to orthogonal (dihedral angle between the Pery and NI moiety is 72.5°), and efficient spin–orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) was observed (singlet oxygen quantum yield ΦΔ = 80%). The photophysics of the dyad is excitation wavelength-dependent. Upon excitation into the perylene unit, ultrafast charge separation (CS) was observed (0.66 ps), followed by SOCT-ISC (8 ns), giving rise to the 3Pery state (τT = 214 μs). In this case a long-lived perylene radical cation was also observed (752 μs). On the other hand, upon selective photoexcitation into the NI unit, only the 3Pery state was observed with nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Studies in viscous solvents, such as triethylene glycol, suggested that the formation of the persistent perylene radical cation is an intermolecular process. Pulsed laser excited time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (TREPR) confirmed the SOCT-ISC mechanism, since the observed ESP pattern is different from that typical for SO-ISC. DFT computations showed that the potential energy curve for the torsion of the linker between the donor and acceptor is shallow, yet efficient SOCT-ISC occurs. With the dyad as a triplet photosensitizer, delayed fluorescence of different acceptors was observed (luminescence lifetime up to 57.3 μs). These results are useful for future design of electron donor/acceptor dyads showing an efficient triplet state, as well as for the design of heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers.
Experimental section
General information
All the chemicals used in the synthesis are analytically pure and were used as received. Solvents were dried prior to use. UV-Vis absorption spectra were taken on a UV-2550 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Ltd., Japan). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Ltd, Japan).
Synthesis of compound Pery-NI
Under a N2 atmosphere, compound 3 (132.3 mg, 0.35 mmol) and compound 4 (116.2 mg, 0.35 mmol) were mixed in DMF (10 mL) and water (0.5 mL) and stirred. After that, K2CO3 (145.1 mg, 3 mol%) and Pd(PPh3)4 (20.2 mg, 5 mol%) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and DCM (50 mL) and water (5 mL) were added. The organic layer was washed with brine (3 × 50 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, DCM/n-hexane = 2:1, v/v) to give a reddish orange solid (90 mg, yield: 51%).

Calcd. ([C36H25NO2]+), m/z = 503.1885; found, m/z = 503.1883.
Cyclic voltammetry
The cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded using a CH instrument (CHI610D electrochemical workstation, Inc., Shanghai China). In a nitrogen purged saturated ACN solution containing 0.10 M Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte; the counter electrode is a platinum electrode; the glassy carbon electrode is the working electrode; and the Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 M in ACN) couple is the reference electrode. DCM was used as the solvent and ferrocene was used as an internal reference. The experiments are carried out at 20 °C.
Determination of singlet oxygen quantum yield
The singlet oxygen quantum yields of the compounds were measured with Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 as the standard (ΦΔ = 0.57 in DCM). 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) was used as a 1O2 scavenging agent. The absorbance of DBBF was adjusted to around 1.0 in the air saturated dichloromethane (DCM) solvent. After that, the compound was added to the solution of DPBF, and the compound's absorbance was adjusted around 0.2–0.3. A monochromatic light was used to irradiate the solution in the cuvette for 30 seconds at the wavelength of peak absorption. Then the absorbance at 414 nm was measured after each irradiation and took 10 readings continuously. The slope of the plots of the absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm vs. irradiation time for each compound was calculated in every solvent. Singlet oxygen quantum yields were calculated by using the following equation: (3)where ‘sam’ and ‘std’ designate the compounds and standard (Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2) respectively, A stands for the absorbance, m is the slope of the curves of the absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm versus the irradiation time, and η is the refractive index of the solvents.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
The nanosecond transient absorption spectra were measured on an LP980 laser photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument, UK) and recorded on a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope. The sample solutions were excited with a nanosecond pulsed laser (Opolette™ 355II + UV nanosecond pulsed laser, the wavelength is tunable in the range of 200–2200 nm, the typical laser energy is 5 mJ per pulse, OPOTEK, USA). The lifetime values (by monitoring the decay trace of the transients) were obtained with the L900 software. To monitor the complete decay of long-lived species, the CW-mode of the LP980 spectrometer was used. The samples were purged with N2 for 10–15 minutes before measurements.
Subnanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
The detailed information of the setup was described previously.76,77 It consists of white-light continuum probe pulses generated in a 200 μm CaF2 nonlinear crystal, and spectrally tunable pump femtosecond pulses (370–550 nm; a few μJ pulse energy) were generated in an optical parametric amplifier (Coherent). The pump and probe pulses were overlapped spatially and temporally into a 1 mm thick cuvette cell containing the sample. Change in transient absorption was monitored by focusing the transmitted probe light through the solution onto a broadband UV-Vis-near-IR detector.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption spectra (fs-TA) were acquired on a system based on a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (BMI Alpha 1000) pumped by a Ti:sapphire oscillator (Spectra Physics Tsunami) with 100 fs time resolution. The system produces 100 fs pulses at 785 nm, with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and an average power of 450–500 mW. Excitation pulses at 400 nm were obtained by second-harmonic generation of the fundamental laser output through a BBO crystal. The probe pulses were generated by focusing a small portion of the fundamental laser output radiation on a 3 mm thick calcium fluoride window. The pump beam polarization has been set to the magic angle with respect to the probe beam by rotating a λ/2 plate. Pump–probe delays were introduced by using a motorized stage, which allowed recording pump probe spectra up to a pump–probe delay of 1.5 ns. The transient signal was revealed by sending the probe beam to a flat field monochromator coupled to a CCD detector. The measurements were carried out in a quartz cell (2 mm thick) mounted on a movable stage to avoid sample photo-degradation and multiple-photo excitation of the solution. The recorded transient absorption spectra have been analyzed by using a global-analysis procedure using the software GLOTARAN.78 In most cases good fits were retrieved using a linear decay scheme with three kinetic constants.
Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy
The TREPR experiments were performed in frozen solutions at 80 K, additionally in liquid crystal E7 oriented in a magnetic field at different temperatures. All samples were excited at 445 nm using a Nd:YAG laser GCR 190-10 (Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA). The laser repetition rate was set to 10 Hz (pulse duration: 10 ns) at an energy of 1 mJ per pulse. A Bruker ESP-300 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) spectrometer was used in combination with a Bruker ER046 MRT (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) microwave bridge. Special (Ilmasil PS, Qsil GmbH, Langewiesen, Germany) quartz tubes having 3 mm inner diameter were used for measurements, and irradiated in a dielectric-ring resonator ER 4118-MD5 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). The resonator was immersed into a CF935 (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK) helium-gas flow cryostat and a temperature stabilizer by a temperature controller ITC503 (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK). The microwave frequency was read using a frequency counter 5352B (Hewlett-Packard, Böblingen, Germany). Signal acquisition was performed with a transient recorder 9354A (LeCroy, Chestnut Ridge, NY) at an overall detection bandwidth of 25 MHz. Distortions of the signal baseline introduced by the laser pulse were corrected by subtracting a signal collected at an off-resonant magnetic-field position.
DFT computations
Density functional theory was used to optimize the molecular structures of the synthesized molecules by using the B3LYP 6-31G(d) functional basis set. The excitation energy and energy gaps between the S0 state and excited triplet states of the compounds were approximated based on the optimal ground-state geometry. All these calculations were performed with Gaussian 09W.79,80
