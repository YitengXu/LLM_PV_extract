    , Accepted 27th September 2016First published on 28th September 2016AbstractHighly semi-transparent sandwich type CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) island perovskite solar cells with high efficiency were constructed by introduction of a polystyrene (PS) passivation interlayer. The PS insulator can prevent direct contact between the TiO2 electron conductor and the polytriarylamine hole conductor. The PS passivation interlayer could be selectively deposited on bare TiO2 by a consecutive spin-coating and spin-washing process. The average visible transmittance of semi-transparent sandwich type MAPbI3 island perovskite solar cells with and without PS passivation layer was ∼20.9% and ∼18.6%, respectively; its power conversion efficiency was 10.2% for forward scan condition and 10.6% for reverse scan condition (average = 6.17% ± 2.32% for 40 samples) and 5.9% for forward scan condition and 6.6% for reverse scan condition (average = 2.93% ± 1.57% for 40 samples); and its efficiency degradation for 30 days was ∼5% and ∼9%, respectively.
Recently, the regulation of CO2 emission has been of great interest because it is considered as the major component causing global warming. Therefore, generation of electrical power from clean and sustainable energy sources, such as wind, geothermal, tide, biomass, solar energy and so on, is of growing importance.
Among them, solar energy has been considered the most promising alternative energy source to replace conventional fossil fuels. In order to effectively utilize solar energy, solar cells have been intensively studied because they can directly generate electricity from solar energy, which is the most convenient and safe energy form in our daily life. Electricity is indispensable to enable our common activities such as operating computers, watching TV, listening music, communicating by mobile smart phone, and driving by guidance of navigation.
To cope with the regulation of CO2 emission and the electricity demands in buildings and cars, additional electrical power generation by BIPVs (building integrated photovoltaics) or VIPV (vehicle integrated photovoltaics) is gradually becoming more important. Hence, it is important to control the average visible transmittance (AVT) for semi-transparent solar cells for BIPVs and VIPVs because the windows and sun-roof are gradually occupying greater areas in buildings and cars. Semi-transparent dye-sensitized solar cells, organic solar cells, thin-film solar cells and perovskite solar cells have been studied to date. Among them, perovskite solar cells1 are currently of great interest because the certified record efficiency has reached over 22% (ref. 2) under 1 Sun condition since Kojima et al.3 reported the liquid junction CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3: X = Br, I) perovskite-sensitized solar cells.
Eperon et al.4 reported 3.5% (AVT: 30%) semi-transparent island-morphology-MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells with neutral color composed of F-dope tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 blocking layer/MAPbI3−xClx perovskite islands/spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)/Au. Ono et al.5 also reported 9.9% semi-transparent thin-film MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells constructed from FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx perovskite thin-film/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag, which shows significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction. Roldán-Carmona et al.6 reported 6.4% (AVT: 29%) semi-transparent planar MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells composed of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid)/vacuum deposited MAPbI3/poly-TPD (poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine])/PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester)/Au/LiF. Recently, Li et al.7 reported 9.9% semi-transparent MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with a laminated metal-free carbon nanotube (CNT) network and spiro-MeOTAD composite electrode. Guo et al.8 reported 8.49% semi-transparent MAPbI3−xClx solar cells with ZnO/Ag nanowire transparent electrode. Very recently, we (Heo et al.)9 reported 15.8% sandwich type MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with inherently self-passivated device architecture but it did not show neutral color. Bu et al.10 and Jiang et al.11 reported 10.1% (AVT: 7.3%) and 11.29% semi-transparent MAPbI3 mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with PEDOT:PSS transparent counter electrode prepared by transfer lamination technique; however, they also did not show neutral colors.
It is still challenging to develop sandwich type semi-transparent planar perovskite hybrid solar cells with high transparency and neutral colors for application in BIPVs or VIPVs. From this perspective, we thought that the island morphology of perovskite would better demonstrate high transparency and neutral colors because such morphology provides uncovered perovskite parts, thereby providing a high degree of open aperture. However, the island morphology MAPbI3 layer exposes the bare TiO2 (electron conductor) so that it is difficult to prevent the charge carriers' recombination due to the direct contact between bare electron conductor and hole conductor. Herein, we introduced a polystyrene (PS) insulating passivation interlayer between the bare TiO2 electron conducting layer and hole conducting layer, thereby improving device efficiency significantly.

Fig. 1(a) is a schematic device architecture of the semi-transparent sandwich type island-MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell with polystyrene (PS) passivation interlayer. Upon illumination, the electrons and holes generated in the island-MAPbI3 perovskite layer are transported into the TiO2 electron conductor and PTAA hole conductor, respectively (Fig. 1(b)). If the electrons and holes are not effectively extracted to electrode, the electrons and holes will be accumulated at the MAPbI3/TiO2 electron conductor/FTO interface and MAPbI3/PTAA hole conductor/PEDOTPSS/ITO interface, respectively. In this scenario, the holes in PTAA can be recombined with the electrons in the TiO2 electron conductor, thereby deteriorating the device efficiency. To eliminate such a recombination pathway, we introduced a PS passivation interlayer between the bare TiO2 electron conductor and the PTAA hole conductor as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(c) is the cross-sectional SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image of the semi-transparent sandwich type island-MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell with PS passivation interlayer, indicating that the thicknesses of the layers are FTO/TiO2 electron conductor, ∼500 nm; PS interlayer, ∼50 nm; island MAPbI3, ∼400 nm; PTAA, ∼1000 nm; PEDOT:PSS, ∼50 nm. Fig. 1(d) is a photograph of semi-transparent sandwich type island-MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell with PS passivation interlayer showing high transparency.

In a typical process for the formation of the PS passivation interlayer, we first deposited a layer of TiO2 electron conductor of ∼50 nm thickness on the etched FTO substrate (active area = 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) by spraying 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol solution at 450 °C. The MAPbI3 film with island morphology was deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrate by spin-coating 40 wt% MAPbI3/γ-butyrolactone solution at 5000 rpm for 120 s, followed by drying on a hot plate at 100 °C for 2 min. In order to selectively deposit a PS passivation interlayer on the bare TiO2/FTO substrate, we selectively removed the PS layer on top of the MAPbI3 island film by a spin-coating and spin-washing process. We deposited PS passivation interlayer by spin-coating PS/toluene solution (0.1 g/1 mL) at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then the PS/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate was accelerated/decelerated to a specific spin speed (7000, 6000, 5000, and 4000 rpm). As soon as the spin speed reached a specific rpm (ramp time = 3 s), 0.5 mL toluene was dropped on the spinning PS/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate, which was spun for another 30 s (spin-washing process). When we drop the toluene solvent on the spinning island MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate, the toluene solvent could partially dissolve the PS interlayer. At the same time, a strong shear flow is also created from center to periphery by the centrifugal force of spinning. Therefore, the PS interlayer on the island MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate is continuously washed out by the dropping toluene solvent. If the spin speed is relatively slow (4000 rpm), the toluene can fully dissolve the PS interlayer, and consequently, the bare surface of TiO2/FTO can be exposed. On the other hand, if the spin speed is relatively fast (7000 rpm), the toluene is very quickly spun out before dissolving the PS interlayer sufficiently, so that the PS layer on the island MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate still remains. Accordingly, there is an optimal spin speed to remove the PS over layer on the island MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate.

Fig. 2 is the SEM surface and cross-sectional images of MAPbI3 islands/TiO2/FTO substrate with and without PS passivation interlayer. The SEM surface image in Fig. 2(a) is the MAPbI3 islands/TiO2/FTO substrate with PS passivation layer which was formed by the spin-washing process at 6000 rpm. The inset SEM image in Fig. 2(a) clearly shows that the bare TiO2 surface is fully covered by PS passivation layer. The SEM cross-sectional image in Fig. 2(b) confirmed that the top surface of MAPbI3 island is clean due to complete removal of PS by the spin-washing process. On the other hand, the SEM surface image and inset SEM image of MAPbI3 islands/TiO2/FTO substrate without PS passivation layer in Fig. 2(c) shows that the valleys of TiO2/FTO substrate are partially covered by very thin MAPbI3 but the mountains of TiO2/FTO substrate are not covered by MAPbI3. The SEM cross-sectional image in Fig. 2(d) indicates that the thickness of MAPbI3 islands is similar in both cases. Fig. S1(a) and (b)† is the SEM surface image of MAPbI3 islands/TiO2/FTO substrate with PS passivation layer formed by the spin-washing process at 4000 rpm. During the spin-washing process, the slow spin speed resulted in exposure of the bare TiO2 surface (see Fig. S1(b)†) due to excess washing by toluene, whereas the PS over layer on top MAPbI3 islands was not fully removed under fast spin speed (7000 rpm), as shown in Fig. S1(c) and (d).†

To make semi-transparent sandwich type solar cells, we prepared the counter electrode by spin-coating a filtered PEDOT:PSS/methanol (1:2 volume) solution on a cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s, with subsequent drying at 150 °C for 20 min. A PTAA hole conductor/toluene solution with Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI):acetonitrile (ACN) solution and tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, Aldrich):ACN solution additives (HTM/toluene/Li-TFSI solution/t-BP solution = 20 mg/1 mL/15 μL) (170 mg:1 mL)/30 μL (1 mL:1 mL) was dropped on the MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate and the counter electrode of PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate was covered on the wet PTAA/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate. Then, the two substrates were pressurized by double clip and dried. Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic properties of the sandwich type island MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with and without PS passivation interlayer. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the FTO/TiO2/island MAPbI3 perovskite film with and without PS passivation layer are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b); the absorptivity of the samples is almost the same. The AVT (average visible transmittance) of the semi-transparent sandwich type MAPbI3 island perovskite solar cell with and without PS passivation interlayer was is ∼18.6% and ∼20.9%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the sandwich type island MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with PS passivation interlayer are higher with than without the PS passivation interlayer. The calculated photocurrent density (Jsc) from the integration of the EQE spectra of the devices with and without PS passivation interlayer was ∼15.3 mA cm−2 and ∼12.1 mA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The EQE is the product of the light harvesting (ηlhe), charge separation efficiency (ηcs), and charge collection (ηcc), so that the improved EQE values of the sandwich type island MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cell with PS passivation interlayer will be the result of improved ηcc, because ηlhe and ηcs are almost unchanged under the present experimental conditions. The J–V curves of the sandwich type island MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with and without PS passivation interlayer with respect to scan direction under 200 ms of delay time (scan rate = 10 mV 200 ms−1) condition are presented in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively. The best devices with PS passivation layer show 0.96 V Voc (open-circuit voltage), 15.5 mA cm−2Jsc (short-circuit current density), 68.6% FF (fill factor), and 10.2% η (power conversion efficiency) for the forward scan direction and 0.96 V Voc, 15.5 mA cm−2Jsc, 71.2% FF, and 10.6% η for the reverse scan direction under illumination of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G). The best device without PS passivation layer shows 0.85 V Voc, 11.8 mA cm−2Jsc, 58.9% FF, and 5.9% η for the forward scan direction and 0.87 V Voc, 12.3 mA cm−2Jsc, 61.7% FF, and 6.6% η for the reverse scan direction. Therefore, the devices with PS passivation interlayer have higher η than the devices without PS passivation layer by improved Jsc, Voc, and FF values. The photovoltaic properties of sandwich type island MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with and without PS passivation layer are summarized in Table 1. The average device efficiency (ηavg) and efficiency deviation of the cells with (w-PS) and without PS (w/o-PS) passivation interlayer was 6.17% ± 2.32% and 2.93% ± 1.57%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(e). The relatively broader efficiency deviation for with PS passivation devices might be associated with the fact that the spin-washing process was done manually so that the selective washing fluctuated. To check the stability of w-PS and w/o-PS sandwich type perovskite solar cells, we recorded η and relative humidity every day for 30 days as shown in Fig. 3(f). The degradation of efficiencies of both w-PS and w/o-PS devices were similar: w-PS device = 10.4% → 9.92% and w/o-PS device = 6.25% → 5.69%, respectively. The change was attributed to the self-passivated sandwich architecture shared by both cells. Accordingly, the sandwich type island MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells showed good air and humidity stability.

In order to understand why the devices with PS passivation layer show higher efficiency than the device without PS passivation layer, we measured the diffusion coefficient (Dn) and the charge carrier's life time (τn) using intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The Nyquist plots of IMPS and IMVS are shown in Fig. S2.† The plots of Dn and τn with current density (J) indicated that the Dn and τn of the devices with PS passivation layer are increased by 1.57-fold and 1.47-fold, respectively, compared with those of the devices without PS passivation layer. As a result, the diffusion length (Ln = (Dn × τn)0.5) of the devices with and without PS passivation layer was ∼290 nm and ∼190 nm, respectively. This clearly indicates that backward recombination is significantly suppressed by introduction of PS passivation interlayer in semi-transparent sandwich type MAPbI3 island perovskite solar cells. From the results of the EQE, IMPS, and IMVS, it can be concluded that the EQE value of the device with PS passivation interlayer is increased by the improved charge collection efficiency (ηcc) due to reduced recombination, thereby increasing the Jsc. The FF and Voc of the device with PS passivation interlayer are also improved by the increased of Dn and τn, which is attributed to the decreased recombination of the charge carriers.

Conclusions
We fabricated highly efficient semi-transparent sandwich type MAPbI3 island perovskite solar cells with high transparency by introduction of PS passivation interlayer, which can prevent direct contact between TiO2 electron conductor and PTAA hole conductor. The selective deposition of PS passivation interlayer on bare TiO2 or the gaps between MAPbI3 island crystals was achieved by introduction of a spin-washing process using toluene solvent. By introducing PS passivation interlayer in semi-transparent sandwich type MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, we could improve the η from 5.9% to 10.2% for forward scan condition and from 6.6% to 10.6% for reverse scan condition. The average device efficiency and deviation of 40 samples was 6.17% ± 2.32% for the devices with PS passivation and 2.93% ± 1.57% for those without PS passivation. Due to the island morphology of MAPbI3 in the solar cells, the AVT was high at ∼18.6% for devices without PS passivation layer and ∼20.9% for devices with PS passivation layer. In addition, the semi-transparent sandwich type MAPbI3 island perovskite solar cells exhibited good long-term stability due to inherently self-passivated device architecture.
