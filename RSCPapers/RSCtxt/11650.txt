    , Accepted 16th September 2013First published on 25th September 2013AbstractConversion electrodes based on binary or ternary metal oxides are known to suffer from a slow electrode kinetic problem that is related to solid-state lithium diffusion, electrochemical stability and loss of coulombic efficiency in the initial cycles. The solid-state diffusion problem is mainly governed by the grain boundary effect during the conversion reaction but the reason behind the electrochemical stability is still unknown. To overcome the issues related to solid-state diffusion, electrodes are nanoarchitectured and made in nano-dimensions but it is still not clear how to solve the stability problem, which is very acute when electrodes perform at a high rate. To attempt solving this problem for the ternary based conversion anode, we have carried out this study. The current study describes the use of a nanosized NiFe2O4-based conversion anode along with an alginate binder as an excellent high rate (for instance, 20 C rate) electrode. In this study, more than 98% of the initial charge storage capacity of a nickel ferrite electrode is restored over a large number of cycles. Galvanostatic tests on such electrodes show that NiFe2O4 nanoparticles can deliver 740 mA h g−1 capacity at 1 C current rate with very good capacity retention. The observed outstanding electrochemical performance, stability and coulombic efficiency will help us to design a ternary metal oxide based electrode as an anode for future generation lithium-ion batteries.
Introduction
In the case of lithium-ion battery electrode design, the choice of anode properties, including, fast electrode kinetics, low cost and safety of the material and a very low redox potential vs. Li/Li+ compared to cathode materials. In the early stage of lithium battery development, the anode materials were low potential insertion compounds such as Li2WO2.1 Later on these metal oxides were replaced by low density carbon-based materials, which are currently enjoying widespread commercial success and have been for over two decades.2
Despite advances being made on carbon-based anodes, it is well understood that new anode materials are required because of the energy demands of the modern age. There are disadvantages of carbon anodes, firstly carbon materials can suffer from solvent co-intercalation resulting in large interlayer expansion, which exfoliates when reactions have a high rate of charge–discharge. Secondly, carbon materials suffer from fundamental drawbacks in terms of gravimetric and volumetric capacity, which affect the development of high energy density lithium batteries. It is noteworthy that a large number of alternative possibilities have been proposed recently as negative lithium battery electrodes, which may give us new directions in meeting the challenges faced by anode materials. One important aspect of anode development concerns the conversion reaction. The very first report of a conversion anode was based on an iron oxide and cobalt oxide material, which was deep discharged to achieve the desired capacity.3 Later on few complex oxides including LiMVO4, RVO4, MV2O6 and MMoO3 were used as conversion anodes.4–6 However, in the initial stage the lithium storage mechanism and the origin of the reversibility was not clear to the battery community. Later on the reaction mechanism and problems associated with the conversion reactions were understood and a large number of reports reflected this in the literature.7–15 Among all of the reported metal and mixed metal oxides, less expensive iron oxides (Fe2O3, Fe3O4) have gained much interest as anodes because they are eco friendly, abundant and can accommodate more than six lithium ions during deep discharge.16–18 However, a large volume change can occur during the conversion reaction, which can lead to capacity fading and cause mechanical failure in the battery electrode. The volume expansion and pulverization problem can be neutralized by optimising morphology and size.16,19,20
At the same time, pure Fe2O3 can react with divalent metal oxides (MO) and form stable MFe2O4. Basically, these ternary oxide spinels were crystallized into either normal, inverse or partially inverse structures depending on the site preference energy, ionic radius of the metal ions, and possibility of different valency states. Tirado et al., have reported on the inverse spinel with the formula of MFe2O4 (M = Co and Ni). For NiFe2O4, the initial reversible capacity was found to be 920 mA h g−1 depending on the temperature of the synthesis, when cycled in the voltage range of 0.005–3 V vs. Li at a 1 C rate. But, capacity fading was observed to a large extent during the first 20 cycles.21 This was ascribed to the optimized particle size and macro porous structure of the phase, in comparison to those prepared at lower or higher temperatures. Afterwards, the same authors explained that the electrochemical grinding effect produced during cycling would disaggregate the Li2O–Ni–Fe agglomerations, which might be the reason behind the capacity fading. Capacity fading is still a problem in the case of metal ferrites to be considered as effective anodes. It is known that when the particles of electrodes expand/contract during conversion, a large interparticle motion occurs, which may result in binder bonds being broken unless the polymer binder is highly extensible and reversible. Obviously, the binder may also play a very important role in stabilizing the electrode materials. In lithium ion battery technology, researchers have prepared electrodes using different binders like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), poly acrylic acid (PAA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and alginate.22–24 Yushin et al., introduced alginate as a binder for LIBs. They have carried out indentation studies of electrodes with a Na alginate binder in a dry state and it has exhibited ∼6 times higher stiffness than dry films of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), the binder used in Li-ion battery electrodes.25 Alginate (alginic acid) is a copolymer of 1 → 4 linked b-D-mannuronic acid (M) and a-L-guluronic acid (G) residues. Different compositions and sequences of M and G monoblocks in alginates yield a plethora of physical and biological properties.26
The aim of this work is to avoid the capacity fading in inverse spinel ternary oxides by using high surface area nanoparticles and improving the interface between the active material and binder. In this study, NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared by a sol–gel combustion technique to obtain pure nano size particles. The prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were characterized using various techniques such as XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical response of the prepared nanoparticles was studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. These NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with sodium alginate binders could exhibit promising electrochemical performance such as a high reversible capacity, excellent cycling performance and good rate capability, which are reported for the first time here.
Experimental
Nanocrystalline nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) particles were synthesized by a sol–gel combustion route. In the sol–gel combustion process, nickel nitrate (Sigma Aldrich), iron nitrate (Sigma Aldrich), citric acid (Qualigence, Analar grade) and urea (Qualigence, Analar grade) were used as precursors to synthesize nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 particles. First, the solutions of all the required precursors were mixed with continuous stirring at 80 °C to form a gel, which was then heated up to 180 °C. The gel expanded into a foam with a volume 20 times that of the gel. Pure nano crystalline NiFe2O4 particles were obtained on further heating of the foam up to 600 °C for 12 h. The synthesized nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 particles were characterized by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X'pert PRO MPD, PANalytical, Philips) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å at 40 kV and 30 mA). The size and shape of the synthesized samples were examined with a field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope-EDX (Zeiss, Ultra 55 model with Oxford EDX system). A transmission electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM), JEOL 2010F HRTEM, Japan, with a 200 kV operating voltage was used to capture the morphology and crystallinity of the NiFe2O4 sample. Raman measurements were carried out in the back scattered geometry using an Ar+ laser excitation source emitting at 514 nm with 20 mW power, coupled with a Labram-HR800 micro-Raman spectrometer (equipped with an appropriate edge filter and a Peltier-cooled charge coupled device detector). The electrochemical studies of nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 particles were analyzed in a CR2032 coin cell in a half-cell configuration. The composite electrode was prepared by mixing 70 wt% of the active material with 20 wt% Super P carbon black (Timcal super P) and 10 wt% sodium alginate (Sigma Aldrich) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and PVDF binders (Sigma Aldrich) in a suitable solvent. The obtained slurry was cast on a piece of Cu-foil and cut into circular electrodes. Lithium foil was used as the anode and a 1 M solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (1:1) was used as the electrolyte [LP 30, Merck Germany]. Swagelok-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled dry glove box (Mbraun, MB10 compact) using a Whatman GF/D borosilicate glass–fiber separator. The cyclic voltammetry and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were recorded at various potentials during the first discharge–charge cycles using a frequency range between 1 MHz and 1 mHz with 5 mV of amplitude (Model: VMP-3, Biologic, France). The cells were galvanostatically cycled between 3 V and 0.02 V vs. Li/Li+ using an Arbin Instrument (model BT 2000, USA).
Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of the nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 sample along with the JCPDS data (no. 862267) is shown in Fig. 1. The observed XRD peaks were indexed to a face centered cubic phase (space group Fdm) of NiFe2O4. The crystallite size (D) was calculated using the Scherrer formula: βcos(θ) = kλ/D, where β is the full width-at-half-maximum length of the reflection.27 The calculated crystallite size of the pure NiFe2O4 nanoparticle sample was approximately 22 nm. The schematic representation of a NiFe2O4 unit cell is shown as an inserted image in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2 shows the FEG-SEM images of the polymeric intermediate (foam) and pure nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 samples. Fig. 2(a) and (b), show the polymeric intermediate (as synthesized material) at different magnifications. Fig. 2(c) and (d), show the pure NiFe2O4 nanoparticle sample, which was heated up to 600 °C for 12 h in air. Fig. 3(a)–(d) show the TEM images of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles at different magnifications. The size investigation and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were observed using HRTEM. The HRTEM images of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) indicate the formation of agglomerates with spherical morphology ∼15 nm in diameter, which is close to what was observed with SEM. The SAED patterns were recorded and Debye–Scherrer rings were obtained. These are shown in Fig. 3(d) and represent the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (422) lattice planes and they are supported by the XRD analysis. The XRD, FTIR (see ESI, Fig. S1†), SEM and TEM results confirmed that the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles are phase pure and can be successfully prepared by using the sol–gel combustion process.

Electrochemical properties

Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the cyclic voltammetry profile for NiFe2O4/Li (PVDF) and NiFe2O4/Li (alginate) respectively. For these thin film electrodes, substantial differences between the first and the subsequent cycles are observed. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), in the first cycle, a large cathodic peak located around 0.6 V vs. Li/Li+ is probably associated with the reduction reactions of Fe3+ and Ni2+ with Li and the formation of Li2O. In the subsequent cathodic scans, the NiFe2O4/Li (PVDF) sample (Fig. 4(a)) shows a cathodic peak and anodic peak at 0.5 V and 1.9 V, respectively. The intensity of the peaks changes with cycle numbers, which indicates poor stability against lithium. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the two cathodic peaks located at 0.83 V and 1.6 V vs. Li/Li+ can be attributed to the reductive reaction of Fe2O3 and NiO to Fe and Ni metal, respectively.28 The decrease of the redox peak intensity implies that the electrode stability is a major issue after the first cycle. In the first anodic cycle, a main broad peak centred at 1.6 V vs. Li/Li+ is related to the oxidation of metallic iron and nickel to Fe3+ and Ni2+, which shifts towards a higher potential, about 1.9 V vs. Li/Li+, after the second cycle due to the change in the ionic environment.

It should be noted that the peak intensity during the anodic and cathodic polarization process remained unchanged for 20 scanning cycles in the case of the alginate binder, indicating a good electrochemical reversibility of the NiFe2O4/Li (alginate) electrode. The observed conversion redox mechanism may occur in the following steps NiFe2O4 + 8Li+ + 8e ↔ Ni + 2Fe + 4Li2O8Li ↔ 8Li+ + 8eNiFe2O4 + 8Li → Ni + 2Fe + 4Li2O
At the cathode (in the present case the working electrode), NiFe2O4 started reacting with the Li ions and was converted to Ni and Fe nanoparticles along with an amorphous Li2O phase during the deep reduction cycle. However, in the reverse oxidation process, Ni and Fe nanoparticles are oxidized to NiO and Fe2O3 phases respectively, which is confirmed by the vibrational spectroscopy study and shown in a later stage of the discussion.
The sodium alginate has carboxyl groups on its surface, which allow bonding between the outer surface of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles and the binder. The proposed redox mechanism of ion transport through the alginate film occurs via hopping of Li ions between the adjacent carboxylic sites. Furthermore, the alginate binder will provide a very weak binder–electrolyte interaction, which is needed for the long-term anode stability by preventing the rapid anode degradation.29 The kinetic response of the current electrode material can be evaluated from the in situ impedance spectra measured from the samples in the 1st discharge and charge cycle (Fig. 5(a)). Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the Nyquist plots typically recorded at different onset voltages. The impedance data were analyzed by using the equivalent electrical circuit model shown in Fig. 5(c), similar to the circuit employed for other oxide electrodes.30,31 It consists of electrolyte (Re), surface film (RSF), and charge transfer (RCT) resistances, a constant phase element (CPE) instead of pure capacitance, along with a suitable diffusional component like Warburg impedance (WS) and the intercalation capacitance (Cint).

From Fig. 5, we can observe that there is one depressed semicircle, which consists of two semi circles convoluted into one semicircle. The first one is located in the high frequency range and can be tentatively ascribed to the migration of lithium ions through an inorganic surface film (SF), mainly composed of lithium carbonate and alkyl carbonate. The semicircle observed in the intermediate frequency region and can be ascribed to a charge-transfer (CT) reaction occurring at the particle–electrolyte surface. The observed depressed semicircle was fitted by using an R(SF+CT) combination. From the first dispersed semicircle, R(SF+CT) resistance values could be estimated from fitted data. In Fig. 5, we can observe that the R(SF+CT) increases slightly as the voltage is decreased in the discharge state; however there is no change in the charging state, even when the voltage is increased. The reason for the increase of R(SF+CT) during the charging state might be due to the suppression of the reaction between the Li ions and electrons at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the formation of large grain boundaries affecting the efficient mass transfer process.32 The values of Re and R(SF+CT) at different voltages are shown in Table 1. Furthermore, nano-sized electrode materials offer good charge transfer kinetics due to their shorter diffusion path lengths. Therefore, the better performance of NiFe2O4 must be ascribed to the stability of the interfaces providing constant capacity values in long-term cycling.

Fig. 6 shows the EDX line scan spectrum of the cathode film after 20 cycles (at a fully charged state). We have chosen one specific grain of active material of 2 μm width that protrudes slightly and used for the EDX map (in line scanning mode) to find out which elements are present on the surface of the grain. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the oxygen content is higher on the surface of the agglomerated particle than in its interior. But, the content of Fe and Ni is almost constant throughout the grain. This confirmed the formation of Li2O, Fe2O3 and NiO nanoparticles on the surface of the cathode film (present case w.r.t. Li anode) during the charge–discharge in the conversion reaction.

Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the pure NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4–alginate electrodes after 20 cycles in the charge state along with the Lorentzian line shape fitting. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the five bands confirm the formation of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. NiFe2O4 crystallizes in a spinel structure with the space group Fdm and group theoretical calculations result in five Raman active bands namely A1g + Eg + 3T2g.33 As shown in Fig. 7(b), the four peaks on the lower wavenumber side belong to the a γ-Fe2O3 phase.34,35 The bands at 925 cm−1and 1100 cm−1, belong to two-phonon (TO + LO & 2LO) excitations. One band at 1500 cm−1 belongs to the two magnon excitations of nickel oxide.36–38 Furthermore, two broad bands at 1350 and 1580 cm−1 belong to the super P carbon, which is used as a conductive additive in the electrode preparation. Hence, the Raman spectrum shows the formation of a γ-Fe2O3 phase and NiO after 20 cycles, which is strong evidence in support of the conversion reaction mechanism described in an earlier section.

The electrochemistry of the NiFe2O4 electrode is interesting and Fig. 8 shows the discharge capacity versus cycle number of NiFe2O4/Li (PVDF). The discharge capacity of the NiFe2O4 electrode at the 0.1 C (91.5 mA g−1) rate during the 1st cycle was observed as 1440 A h−1, while at the 50th cycle it was 180 mA h g−1.
 Fig. 8  a) Capacity versus cycle number plot and b) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of NiFe2O4 with PVDF binder. 
The discharge capacity loss in the Li/NiFe2O4 nanoparticle cell was around 85% between the 1st and the 50th cycles. In Fig. 8(b), the 1st discharge curve shows a large plateau, which indicates the reduction of metal ions and formation of Li2O. Afterwards, the discharge curves do not show any plateau, so it can be concluded that the prepared electrode thin film with the PVDF binder experiences rapid capacity fading due to inadequate interfacial stability.39 At the same time, the cycle performance of NiFe2O4/Li (CMC) at 91 mA g−1 (1 C) for 30 cycles is shown in Fig. S2 (see ESI†). The rate performance curves of NiFe2O4/Li (CMC) were recorded at various discharge current densities, from 915 mA g−1 to 18300 mA g−1 and are shown in Fig. S3 (see ESI†). The specific capacity of NiFe2O4/Li (CMC) dropped dramatically, but still the CMC binder shows better cyclic performance compared to the conventional PVDF binder. Finally, we prepared an electrode with an alginate binder and to evaluate the cycling behavior of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with the alginate binder up to 30 cycles were performed, using the 0.1 C (91.5 mA g−1) current rate. The discharge capacity of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with the alginate binder shows very good capacity retention as represented in Fig. 9(a).
 Fig. 9  (a) Capacity versus cycle number plot and (b) galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of NiFe2O4 with the alginate binder at a 0.1 C rate. 
From Fig. 9(a), the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with the alginate binder show a stable discharge capacity of 880 mA h g−1 at a 0.1 C rate with excellent coulombic efficiency. The enhanced capacity was attributed to the highly stable interface between the active materials and binder. Significantly the NiFe2O4/Li (alginate) had an increased capacity at 0.1 C compared to recently reported ternary nanocomposites.21,29 From Fig. 9(b), several plateaus can be observed during the first discharge, which were ascribed to the sequential reduction of nickel and iron, according to the length of the plateaus. Also, the lithium insertion into the nano-sized ternary samples and the atom ordering during the NiO reduction were believed to be responsible for the appearance of new plateaus at the beginning of the first discharge stage.40

Fig. 10 shows the rate capability plots of the NiFe2O4/Li (alginate) electrode cycled at different rates starting from 915 mA g−1 (1 C), 1830 mA g−1 (2 C), 4575 mA g−1 (5 C), 9150 mA g−1 (10 C), 18300 mA g−1 (20 C) and then reverting back to the 1 C rate. At each rate, ten cycles were tested to assess the material’s retention capacity. The rate capability of the electrodes is also shown in Fig. 10(a). At the very high rate of 18300 mA g−1 (20 C), 42.5% of the original capacity was retained with high cycleability. It was observed that the discharge capacity of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticle anode decreases to 740, 620, 504, 420 and 380 mA h g−1 when the current rate is increased to 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 C, respectively. The prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were shown to have a stable high capacity along with good cycleability compared to previous reports.21,41 From Fig. 10(b), the plateaus corresponding to Li uptake and extraction can clearly be seen even at high current rates. Such impressive lithium storage at high current rates may be attributed to better adherence between the active material surfaces with the alginate binder. While charge and discharge processes were carried out at a high rate (20 C), we still observed good specific capacities with 99% coulomb efficiency. As the current rate increases, the pseudo-plateaus of each discharge curve move downwards. The observation can be explained as follows, at a high rate the electrode overpotentials and the internal IR drops, mainly due to the low conductive organic electrolyte, thus decreasing the operating voltage of the cell. At high rates, the intercalation/de-intercalation of Li+ ions happens only at the surface of the particles, and hence the observed capacity is low.42 As per our documentation, the current capacity retention and specific capacity value are higher compared to previously reported ternary anode materials at low as well as at high rates. Therefore, we can say here that this is the first report of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles that are cycled at very high current rates for use in high power energy storage applications.

Conclusions
The nanocrystalline nickel ferrite particles were successfully synthesized using a sol–gel combustion technique. The phase, structure and microstructure of the prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were confirmed by XRD, SEM-EDX, and HRTEM studies. The present work has a few important points to share including (1) without any template we could synthesize electrode materials based on the conversion reaction, which can show excellent electrochemical performance at a high rate; (2) the better electrochemical stability of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with an alginate binder. The NiFe2O4/Li (alginate) seem to have a higher capacity and better stability than the earlier reported results of other NiFe2O4 materials. The main reason could be due to the use of high surface area of the particles and high stable interface between the active material and alginate binder. The nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 with the alginate binder delivers a stable maximum discharge capacity of 880 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C, which is nearer to the theoretical capacity (915 mA h g−1) limit of this material. It has a high rate performance as at 18300 mA g−1 (20 C) it also exhibits a discharge capacity of about 380 mA h g−1 under similar conditions. Hence, we suggest that the ternary nickel ferrite nanocrystalline particle is an important class of anode material for next generation Li-ion battery applications.
