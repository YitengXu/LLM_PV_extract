    , Accepted 10th October 2017First published on 10th October 2017AbstractThree donor–π conjugated unit–acceptor (D–π–A) type zinc porphyrin sensitizers LX1, LX2 and LX3 bearing meso acrylic acid, α-cyanoacrylic acid, and α-cyanopentadienoic acid, respectively, as the π-bridged acceptors were designed and synthesized for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The interesting role of the cyano group attached to the α position of the acrylic and pentadienoic acid acceptor was investigated. It was shown that even though the introduction of the cyano group and the elongation of the π-bridge can both increase the light-harvesting as indicated by the UV-vis absorption spectra, the relevant cell performance dropped significantly. The photo to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices increase in the order of LX1 > LX2 > LX3, with the highest PCE of 6.04% achieved for the LX1-based cell, which bears acrylic acid as the π-bridged acceptor. To further explore the effect of –CN and –CHCH– on the interaction between the absorbed dye and TiO2 substrates, their density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS), as well as electronic properties were investigated in detail using theoretical calculations. The results suggest that introducing the –CN group into the acceptor and extending the conjugation of the π-bridge have decreased the LUMO levels of the dyes, leading to weak interfacial coupling, low electron injection driving force, low Jsc, and thus poor cell performance.
Introduction
Today, the exhaustion of fossil fuels as well as the environmental issues caused by using fossil fuels is becoming the major bottleneck for sustainable development, which has triggered an eager search for clean, cheap and efficient renewable energy resources.1,2 Solar cells as effective energy-conversion systems have been developed, among which dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to the advantages of low manufacturing cost, good flexibility and high photo to current conversion efficiency (PCE). A dye sensitizer as the light harvester used in DSCs plays an important role in influencing the cell performance. Different types of dye molecules such as ruthenium complexes,3–7 zinc porphyrin,8–12 and metal-free organic dyes13–18 have been developed to serve as efficient light harvesters for DSCs. In particular, porphyrin-based dyes have been proved to be promising candidates for use in DSCs due to their intrinsic advantages of strong absorption coefficients in the visible region19 and multifarious positions available for functionalization, which result in readily tunable optical, photophysical and electrochemical properties of porphyrins.8,11,20–22
To date, the most efficient porphyrin sensitizers have featured a donor–π conjugated unit–acceptor (D–π–A) structure.23–25 For example, in 2014, a PCE of 13% was achieved for an SM315-sensitized solar cell, which is by far the highest PCE value realized for porphyrin DSCs.26 To further improve the PCE of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells (PSCs), continuous efforts are still directed at the exploration of structure–property relationships, which will help to design rational sensitizers for use in DSCs.
Introducing cyanoacrylic acid as a π-bridged acceptor has been considered as an effective strategy to design efficient organic dye sensitizers because of the fact that it offers better charge-transfer character and greater absorptivity.27 However, the role of the cyano group in the acceptor of the porphyrin sensitizers needs to be further addressed. In 2005, Gratzel et al. developed a series of β functionalized D–π–A type porphyrins as sensitizers for DSCs and found that porphyrin Zn-3 containing cyanoacrylic acid as the β π-bridged acceptor exhibited the best efficiency of 5.6% as a result of the strong electron withdrawing nature of the CN group.28 In 2011, Liu and coworkers reported that introducing a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor to the porphyrin meso position via a rigid benzo ring tended to broaden and red-shift the Soret and Q bands, and facilitate intramolecular charge separation, thereby improving the light-harvesting capabilities and electron injection efficiency, and then leading to a better cell performance.29 Kim and coworkers evaluated the performance of 2Flu-ZnP-COOH and 2Flu-ZnP-CN-COOH based DSCs and found that 2Flu-ZnP-CN-COOH reached a higher PCE value due to the efficient intramolecular charge separation induced by the strong electron-withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, which is also bonded to the benzo ring at the porphyrin meso position (Scheme 1).30 Interestingly, in the same year Diau and coworkers reported that compared with a YD20-based DSC, a poorer performance was discovered for a YD21-sensitized cell in which cyanoacrylic acid was attached to the meso phenylethynyl group as the acceptor (Scheme 1).31 Later, Diau and coworkers further investigated a series of meso-phenylethynyl derivatized porphyrins with/without the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor used in DSCs and also concluded that introducing the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor decreased the cell performance.32 Moreover, Sun et al. demonstrated that organic dyes containing cyanoacrylic acid tended to desorb and degrade from the TiO2 surface owing to the simultaneous effect of water and UV light, which leads to continuous degression in the cell efficiency.33 In 2014, they also detected the photoisomerization of the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, which may also spoil the cell performance in organic dyes.34 Interestingly, in all the above mentioned porphyrin systems developed by Kim and Diau, the cyano and carboxylic groups are attached to an aromatic ring via a double bond. The difference lies in the presence/absence of a triple bond between the aromatic ring and the porphyrin meso position. Diau and coworkers believed that the floppy feature (which contrary to the rigid feature may give porphyrins free rotation features when absorbing on the TiO2 film)31,35 of the CC double bond might tilt the molecules adsorbed on TiO2 films so as to facilitate charge recombination and significantly decrease IPCE values. Recently, Xie and coworkers found that the cell performance was significantly improved with the XW8 sensitizer in which the cyano group is directly attached to the meso ethynylbenzo ring, when compared with that of the XW7-cell.12 Xie's work further demonstrated the negative role of the CC double bond in these phenylethynyl-bridged systems. Another work reported by Sun even definitely emphasized the necessity of avoiding exocyclic CC bonds.34 It is also noteworthy that the role of the cyanoacrylic acid group, which is directly attached to the porphyrin meso position, still remains elusive.

In our recent work, we systematically investigated the influence of an alkoxy chain attached to the meso benzo ring in porphyrin D–π–A type sensitizers on the cell performance, in which the acrylic acid acceptor is directly bonded to the porphyrin meso position.36 These results and the interesting role of the cyano group in the π-bridged acceptor have led us to design porphyrin sensitizers LX1, LX2 and LX3 (Scheme 2). The porphyrins LX2 and LX3 feature a D–π–A structure in which the α-cyanoacrylic and α-cyanopenta dienoic acid acceptors are directly attached to the porphyrin, respectively. These systems will allow us to further investigate the role of the cyano group in the acceptor and thus the correlation between the π-bridged cyano containing acceptor and the cell efficiency. It was found that the PCEs of the devices increased in the order of LX1 > LX2 > LX3, with the highest PCE of 6.04% corresponding to a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.67 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 730 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71 achieved for the LX1-based cell, which bears acrylic acid as the π-bridged acceptor. The role of the cyano group and the ethenyl unit in D–π–A zinc porphyrin dyes was further investigated in detail via theoretical calculations. It was shown that introducing the electron-withdrawing –CN group into the acceptor and extending the π-bridge have stabilized the LUMO levels of the dyes, leading to weak interfacial coupling, low electron injection driving force, low Jsc, and thus the poor cell performance. These results provide further insights into the role of the cyano groups in the porphyrin sensitizers and will be helpful for further molecular design for developing efficient DSCs.

Experimental
Materials
All reagents and solvents were purchased commercially and used as received without further purification if not mentioned specially. Toluene and THF were dried by distillation from sodium with sodium benzophenone ketyl as an indicator prior to use. CH2Cl2 was freshly distilled before use. All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (300–400 mesh or silica H). The FTO conducting glass was washed with a detergent solution, deionized water and ethanol successively under ultrasonication before use.
Measurement

1H-NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with tetramethylsilane as a reference at 298 K. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were conducted on a Bruker Autoflex Tof/Tof III instrument. The absorption and emission spectra of the dyes in ethanol solution (3 × 10−6 M) were measured at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-1800 and Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.
The TiO2 suspension was prepared from P25 following a literature procedure.37 The film was prepared by screen printing on precleaned FTO glass and a film of about 18 μm thickness was obtained. Then the film was annealed at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. Finally the TiO2 film was treated with an aqueous TiCl4 solution (50 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with ethanol, and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After the film was cooled to 100 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into the ethanol solutions of dyes (0.3 mM) for 4 h. The sensitized electrode was rinsed with ethanol, and dried. A sandwich cell consisting of the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 electrode as the working electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode was fabricated. The electrolyte (0.06 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was injected into the space between two electrodes. The irradiated area of the cell was 0.159 cm2. The active area of the cell was so small that no mask could be employed during the measurement. The porphyrin dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were tested under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained on a Keithley 2400 Source meter (solar AAA simulator, oriel China, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar).
Computational methods

Isolated dyes. 
All the ground state calculations of the isolated dyes were performed with density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 09 code.38 The ground-state geometries of isolated LX1–3 dyes were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level,39 followed by frequency analysis to confirm the minimum-energy geometry. The vertical excitation calculation analysis was performed with time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d) level.40 All DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out using ethanol as the solvent within the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The contribution of molecular orbitals to the electronic transitions was determined using the GaussSum program.41


Dye@TiO2 systems. 
Dye@TiO2 systems were modeled using (TiO2)38.42–48 The dyes LX1–3 were anchored in a bidentate bridging (BB) mode onto the (101) surface of the TiO2 clusters, with one proton transferred to a surface oxygen atom nearby.49–52 The LX@TiO2 systems were optimized at the PBE/DNP level using the DMol3 program package from Materials Studio.53,54 Then, single-point calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level (PCM, ethanol) using G09. To gain further insights into interfacial electronic properties, density of state (DOS) calculation was performed using the Multiwfn code.55

Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
Based on the previous results, the n-butoxy group was attached to the porphyrin meso benzo ring.36 The porphyrins LX1 and LX2 were designed to investigate the role of the cyano group in the π-bridged acceptor with the double bond spacer directly bonded to the porphyrin meso position. Next, another double bond was introduced, resulting in the π-extended porphyrin LX3, which will allow us to further study the effect of the floppy nature of the π-spacer and the elongated π conjugation on the corresponding device performance.
The synthetic routes of the three sensitizers were depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†).

As shown in Fig. 1a, all the porphyrin dyes featured typical metalloporphyrin absorption bands with an intense Soret band in the 400–500 nm range, and two moderate Q bands in the 550–650 nm region. LX2 and LX3 exhibited a redshifted Soret band absorption by 5 nm and 17 nm with respect to LX1, respectively, which indicated the effect of either introducing a cyano group or extending π-conjugation on the optical absorptions. The Q band absorptions also showed similar trends with absorption maxima at 619, 626 and 641 nm for LX1, LX2 and LX3, respectively. Notably, when another CC bond was introduced into dye LX-3, the spectrum changed distinctly with an absorption shoulder appearing for the Soret band. In the meantime, the whole spectrum became broader compared to that of LX2, especially in the Q band region. This is similar to the spectrum of Zn-8 reported by Gratzel and Nazeeruddin, in which α-cyanopentadienoic acid served as an anchor at the porphyrin β position.28 The results suggested that introducing an electron-withdrawing cyano group or extending π-conjugation is favourable for harvesting sunlight for porphyrin sensitizers LX2 and LX3. The emission spectra of porphyrins LX1, LX2 and LX3, shown in Fig. 1b, were obtained at room temperature in ethanol solution. For the fluorescence spectra, the emission wavelength variation trend was similar to that of the absorption bands.
As expected, the absorption spectra of the three dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface were remarkably broadened and redshifted relative to that of the solution state (Fig. 2). This may be due to the dye deprotonation, the dye–dye and/or dye–TiO2 interactions.56,57 In comparison with LX3, the absorption spectra of LX1 and 2 adsorbed on TiO2 films exhibited a relatively small red shift.

Photovoltaic performance of DSCs
The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs based on the porphyrin dyes LX1, 2 and 3 under standard conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was evaluated using iodine electrolyte. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are displayed in Fig. 3 and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, the highest PCE of 6.04% corresponding to a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.67 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 730 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71, was achieved for the LX1-based DSC, in which the simple acrylic acid is employed as a π-bridged acceptor. When a cyano group was introduced for the porphyrin LX2, the corresponding cell performance dropped significantly, resulting in a Jsc of 6.19 mA cm−2, a Voc of 670 mV and a final PCE value of 3.08%. It was also found that for porphyrin LX3 containing the α-cyanopentadienoic acid acceptor, the PCE value further dropped to 1.44%, with a Jsc of 3.64 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 600 mV. It is noteworthy that compared with the Voc values, the Jsc values for LX2 and 3-sensitized solar cells dropped more significantly. As shown in Table 2, the dye loading values, which were obtained via a dye desorption method,11 for LX1, 2 and 3 were very close (1.13 × 10−7, 1.21 × 10−7 and 1.14 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively), indicating that the descending Jsc values for LX2 and 3 cells do not result from the dye loading amount. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra were also obtained for the LX1, 2, and 3 devices (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, the variations in the IPCE action spectra showed a similar trend with PCE and Jsc values. Interestingly, even though introducing the cyano group and further adding a double bond spacer resulted in a red shift in the absorption spectra for LX2 and LX3, the IPCE values in the whole wavelength range still dropped significantly, in particular for the LX3 device. Therefore, the charge transport and injection losses should be responsible for the decrease in the IPCE and PCE values for the LX2 and LX3 devices, which is in accordance with the theoretical calculations.

Theoretical calculations
To evaluate the role of the cyano group and ethenyl unit in D–π–A zinc porphyrin dyes, theoretical studies were conducted.

Isolated dyes. 
Fig. S1 (ESI†) depicts the UV-vis spectra of isolated LX1–3 dyes simulated at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d) level in ethanol solution. The calculated curves were in good agreement with experimental observations. The small discrepancies between theory and experiment confirmed the accuracy of the employed computational levels for ground state and excited states. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the LX1–3 dyes were as follows: LX3 (2.19 eV) < LX2 (2.42 eV) < LX1 (2.53 eV). The redshift of the absorption spectra follows the order of LX3 > LX2 > LX1, which was ascribed to the downward shift of the LUMO and a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap as a consequence of introducing the electron-withdrawing group (–CN) into the acceptor moiety and extending the π-bridge.58–60
Effective intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to acceptor during electron excitation is favourable for photoelectric conversion efficiency. That means that the HOMO of the sensitizer should be mainly localized at the donor moiety and the LUMO at the π-bridge and anchoring group. The electron density distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO−1 to LUMO+1) for LX1–3 are illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The shapes of the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) of LX1–3 were very similar. The electron densities of the HOMOs of LX1–3 were mainly delocalized on the donor unit, the porphyrin ring, and the π-bridge; the LUMOs showed an increased electron density located on the π-bridge and the anchoring group; the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 MOs of LX1–3 were localized on the porphyrin ring. To further investigate the relationship between the MOs and excited states, the contributions of the molecular orbitals to the electronic transitions are reported in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the Q bands of all three dyes mainly corresponded to the S1 state with a major contribution of HOMO → LUMO transition (67% for LX1, 71% for LX2, 80% for LX3), and minor contribution of HOMO−1 → LUMO+1. On the other hand, the LUMO+1 involved in HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transitions made strong contributions to the calculated B absorption transitions S3 (56% for LX1, 58% for LX2, 63% for LX3), and S4 (60% for LX1, 54% for LX2, 58% for LX3). Therefore, the Q bands of LX1–3 have a significant effective charge transfer character, whereas the B bands do not, since the electron redistribution of S3 and S4 does not significantly extend to the anchoring group after photoexcitation. Moreover, for all three dyes, the LUMO was located on the anchoring moiety, whereas the LUMO+1 was distributed on the porphyrin ring. The former should have significant orbital overlap with the titanium 3d orbital and facilitate electron injection through strong coupling between the dyes and TiO2. Therefore, only the LUMO was considered in the following density of states (DOS) analysis.


Dye@TiO2 systems. 
The optimization and single point calculations of the (TiO2)38 cluster in a vacuum and ethanol were firstly performed before subsequent calculations for the dye@(TiO2)38 systems. In the analysis of the interfacial electronic structure, a Gaussian broadening of 0.3 eV was used for the DOS and PDOS simulations. As shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†), the B3LYP/6-311G(d) calculated band gap for bare TiO2 in a vacuum was 3.3 eV, which was in good agreement with the experimental band gap of bare TiO2 anatase (3.2 eV)61,62 and the band gap of a 2.4 nm TiO2 nanoparticle (3.4 eV).63 The calculated energy of the bare TiO2 conducting band (CB) edge was −4.3 eV, which was slightly lower than the experimental value (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum).64 The consistency between theoretical calculation and experimental observations proves the validity of the selected computational approach. Fig. S3b (ESI†) depicted the DOS of (TiO2)38 simulated in ethanol. Upshifts of the valence band (VB) and CB are predicted, resulting in an increase in the band gap by 0.3 eV. Since different dye@TiO2 systems were compared in the same solution, it is reasonable to assume that the VB and CB shifts induced by the solution remained approximately constant.
Although Meng and colleagues found that the CN groups were involved in interfacial anchoring, surface attachment of LX2 and LX3 through Ti–N should be sterically hindered.65 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that LX1–3 are bonded to the TiO2 surface through the BB mode, since the adsorbed amounts of LX1–3 are similar (see Table 2), which also suggests that LX1–3 are bonded to the TiO2 surface with a similar configuration. The IR spectra of LX1, LX2 and LX3 provide direct evidence that the molecules are bonded to TiO2 through COOH rather than the CN group. Fig. 4 shows the IR spectra of LX1, LX2 and LX3 in powder form and bonded to TiO2. The bands at 1676 cm−1 (for LX1), 1734 cm−1 (for LX2), and 1650 cm−1 (for LX3) were assigned to CO stretching of a free carboxyl group. It completely disappeared after the dyes were adsorbed on TiO2, strongly suggesting that the dyes were bonded to TiO2 through the carboxyl group. In the IR spectra of the dye adsorbed TiO2 film, the peaks at 2213 cm−1 (for LX2) and 2217 cm−1 (for LX3), which are the CN stretching mode, remained the same as for the isolated dyes, suggesting that the CN group was not involved in interfacial bonding.66 The Ti–O bond distances and the optimized BB geometry are shown in Fig. 5. The dyes LX1–3 were adsorbed almost upright onto the TiO2 surface, except LX2 with a small tilting angle. The calculated bond distances between the Ti atom and the O atom of the dyes were in the range of 2.01–2.13 Å. These values agree well with the reported Ti–O bond lengths (2.03–2.24 Å) calculated for dye–TiO2 complexes.6,67–69

Energy alignment and electronic couplings between the excited states of absorbates and TiO2 semiconductor play a crucial role in inducing ultrafast interfacial electron transfer (IET) from TiO2 surface complexes.70 To explore the effect of –CN and –CHCH– on the interaction between absorbates and TiO2 substrates, their density of states (DOS) and partial density states (PDOS), as well as electronic properties were investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, LX1–3 absorbates introduced several occupied levels into the HOMO–LUMO gap of the semiconductor. These levels were entirely localized on the absorbates, corresponding to the HOMOs of the free dyes, which implies that there is no interaction between the HOMO of the absorbates and the semiconductor. In contrast, unoccupied levels were inserted into the CB of TiO2. Further visual comparison of unoccupied MOs of the LX1–3@(TiO2)38 systems and the LUMOs of the free dyes, as shown in Fig. 7, showed that the LUMO levels of LX1, LX2 and LX3 were very similar to the LUMO+7, LUMO+2, and LUMO MOs of the corresponding complexes, respectively. The PDOS analysis also suggested that the LUMOs of LX1, LX2, and LX3 have great contribution to the LUMO+7 (48%), LUMO+2 (52%), and LUMO (84%) of the corresponding complex, respectively, implying that coupling exists between the LUMO of the absorbates and the CB of the semiconductor.

As shown by the DOS and PDOS analysis in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 6, LX1–3 anchored on TiO2 through the carboxylic anchoring group produced downshifts (∼0.3 eV) of the TiO2 CB, while different dyes showed quite similar perturbations of the TiO2 CB edge. Hence, introducing –CN and extending –CHCH– have little effect on CB shifts. This agrees well with the similarity of the experimental Voc values. Herein, the lowest unoccupied MO of the sensitized TiO2 with a considerable contribution from the absorbate was referred to as the LUMO (ads), and the second lowest one referred to as LUMO+1 (ads). A good overlap of the dye's LUMO with the TiO2 cluster is indicative of good electron injection, and the high-lying LUMO (ads) above the TiO2 CB implies great injection driving force. As shown in Fig. 6, the energy levels of the LUMO (ads) for LX1–3@(TiO2)38 decreased in the order of LX1 < LX2 < LX3, which indicated that the electron injection driving force should vary in following the order of LX1 > LX2 > LX3. Moreover, the LUMO (ads) levels for LX1–3@(TiO2)38 were located in the regions with the average spacing of the MO levels increasing in the order of 50 meV for LX1@(TiO2)38, 70 meV for LX2@(TiO2)38, and 90 meV for LX3@(TiO2)38. The LUMO (ads) level for LX3@(TiO2)38 was located at the edge of the CB where the TiO2 MO level spacing is sparse, resulting in no lower and few higher unoccupied TiO2 levels to couple to, while the LUMO (ads) of LX1@(TiO2)38 was spread out on a region with more narrowly spaced levels. This is consistent with the electron density distribution shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c). Therefore, introducing an electron-withdrawing group (–CN) into the acceptor part and extending the π-bridge of LX1–3 have an insignificant effect on the CB shift, stabilizing the LUMO levels of the dyes, leading to weak interfacial coupling, low electron injection driving force and low Jsc.

Conclusions
In this study, three porphyrin dyes LX1, LX2 and LX3 tethering meso acrylic acid, α-cyanoacrylic acid, and α-cyanopentadienoic acid, respectively, as the π-bridged acceptors have been designed and synthesized for use as sensitizers in DSCs. The role of α-cyanoacetic and α-cyanopentadienoic acid directly attached to the porphyrin meso position (including the role of the cyano group and the elongation of the π-bridge) in influencing the photovoltaic properties of the molecules was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. It was shown that the performance of LX2 and LX3-based cells, which bare the α-cyanoacrylic and α-cyanopentadienoic acid acceptor, respectively, significantly dropped due to the remarkable low Jsc values even though the UV-vis absorption spectra of LX2 and LX3 are slightly red-shifted, compared to that of LX1. As a result, the LX1-based cell stands out with the highest PCE of 6.04%, corresponding to a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.67 mA cm−2. To further explore the effect of –CN and –CHCH– on the interaction between the absorbed dye and TiO2 substrates, their density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS), as well as electronic properties were investigated in detail using theoretical calculations. The results suggest that introducing the –CN group into the acceptor and extending the conjugation of the π-bridge have decreased the LUMO levels of the dyes, leading to weak interfacial coupling, low electron injection driving force, low Jsc, and thus poor cell performance. This study offers further insights into perfecting the porphyrin sensitizer structures by considering the combined effect of the cyano group and the extension of π conjugation.
