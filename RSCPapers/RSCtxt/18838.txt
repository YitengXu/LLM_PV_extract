    , Accepted 17th October 2018First published on 17th October 2018AbstractA high penetration of variable renewable energy sources in an electricity generation mix leads to strong constraints on the whole system to ensure a continuous balance between electricity production and consumption. We have developed a new numerical methodology to quantify the relevance of several electricity storage devices that would provide the required flexibility. First of all, through a signal analysis (wavelet decomposition) of photovoltaic power (PV), wind power and load time series, we study and characterize the intermittency at different time scales. Then, each storage technology is evaluated for each time scale from an energy return on investment (EROI) standpoint. They are also compared with the possibility of curtailing excess electricity instead of storing it. The relevance of a given technology especially depends on its efficiency and embodied energy. For instance, we show that batteries are not appropriate for long term storage because of their high embodied energy. However, they are a good choice for short term applications with high cycle requirements because of their efficiency. We characterize the relevance of storage devices, their sensitivity to the production mix and to technological characteristics. We point out that satisfying the energy demand of exceptional events only with storage devices requires an over-sizing of the whole system. It underlines the complementarity of energy storage with dispatchable electricity sources. We eventually show that seasonal electricity storage is particularly difficult to ensure with a good energy return on investment.

Broader context
Large deployment of variable renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and wind power poses new challenges for electricity grid management. As their production depends on the weather, power supply does not always match the demand pattern. Therefore, flexibility is required to balance supply and demand. It can be provided either by flexible demand (demand-side management), flexible supply (dispatchable power sources), or by energy storage. The present study focuses on the potential of electricity storage to average in time the production variability. Using an energy return on investment methodology, we show that Li-ion batteries and Pumped Hydro-electric Storage are relevant for short time scale storage (days to weeks respectively). In contrast, we point out that none of the existing technologies are suitable for seasonal storage. This underlines the complementarity between storage and other flexibility means, especially dispatchable power plants. Long-term flexibility could also be provided by coupling the electricity system with other energy vectors. For instance, thermal energy has the potential for efficient and low cost seasonal storage.

1 Introduction
According to Paris Agreements, France aims to produce 30% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030. Similar commitments have been taken by other countries. To reach this goal new photovoltaic and wind farms need to be set up. However, Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) create strong constraints that will have to be handled by the energy system.
VRES generate a need for flexibility to balance electricity load and supply. This flexibility could be achieved by dispatchable production, demand side management or electricity storage devices. This work focuses on the storage dimension; already existing studies stress the necessity to store energy;1,2 others made a technical review of the various technologies available.2–4 However, focusing on the technical characteristics alone does not enable one to understand the system effects between storage and production sources. In a spirit of “sustainable development”, the energy cost of storage systems must be compared to the energy saved by their operation.
Studies like that of Pellow et al.5 reviewed life cycle analysis to compare the embodied energy of storage devices with the total stored energy.
We refer to the embodied energy as the “Cradle to gate” energy required to set up a device. It goes from the ore extraction, the refining process, and transformations, to the factory gate. It does not include the energy used for operation and maintenance energy. This cradle to gate energy is expressed in terms of primary energy, while the output of the system is electrical energy.
On the basis of energy return on investment (EROI), Pellow et al.5 compared storage technologies with one another and determined which is the most appropriate storage device to use. However, this approach does not fully account for the losses during the storage use phase.
The present study compares various storage devices with respect to their round-trip efficiency and cradle to gate energy. Eventually we look at a couple of “VRES – storage devices” to understand the system effects between both production and storage.
Our analysis is different from prospective studies like the ones using MARKAL-TIMES models. The latest is developed by I.E.A.6 to account for the long term technical and economical behaviours of energetic systems. We rather focus on the balance between load and supply at time scales ranging from an hour to a year. From this analysis we evaluate, for each time scale, the energetic cost of handling the intermittency via electricity storage.
We propose a new numerical methodology to characterize the variability of renewable energy sources that drives the storage device set up. To do so we proceed to an energy return on investment analysis and define the ESOI (Energy Stored On Invested).7 It is the ratio of electrical energy stored over the primary energy required to manufacture the storage and additional production systems. (1)
Concerning storage devices, we only consider existing technologies and their proven performances. In the present study, we have investigated four kinds of storage system: Li-ion batteries, Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), Power-to-gas-to-Power (P2P). Additionally, we compare the potential of these storages with electricity curtailment, i.e. oversizing the production system for times when production is low and discarding the excess electricity the rest of the time.
Global scope – Framework
The research is based on the analysis of intermittent signals. It includes photovoltaic, wind power and load time series. The study is bound to the French scale, and signal data are provided by the French transmission system operator, known as RTE. We created the production times series of any electricity mix, made of PV and wind turbines, by a linear combination of each one. Those signals stem for time series from 2012 to 2015 with data being registered every 30 minutes.
The study is composed of three steps:
(1) Characterize the flexibility need due to the integration of variable renewable energy sources.
(2) Characterize the input data of the simulation for electricity storage and production devices.
(3) Provide guidance for decision: for a given time scale, what is the energy dispatched to the grid by the storage? How does it compare with the energetic investment related to the production and storage?
2 Step 1: assessing the required flexibility
2.1 Methodology: characterizing the flexibility need – a signal analysis
We define the residual demand as the difference between load and non-dispatchable supply signals. Load refers to the electricity consumption, and the non-dispatchable supply is the variable electricity production, such as PV or wind power.

2.1.1 Haar wavelet decomposition. 
We study residual demand of various intermittent generation mixes with the following methodology: we decompose the four years' residual demand electrical signal as a sum of Haar wavelets (Fig. 1 and 2). This decomposition was introduced by Haar in 1910.8 Additional details about Haar wavelet transforms have been discussed by Stankovic and Falkowski.9 This set of wavelets is particularly adapted to energy storage with a charge/discharge sequence, a given time scale and a given magnitude of the stored energy (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  An example of Haar wavelet. 
 Fig. 2  Pedagogic chart of the wavelet decomposition. Wavelet signals of time scale ΔT = 12 hours (a), 1 day (b), week/4 (c) and week/2 (d) are summed and placed on top of the original signal (e). Shorter time scales are missing here to show an imperfect approximation. 
Unlike a Fourier series decomposition, wavelets are not infinite sine waves, but ad hoc functions limited in time. We therefore preserve temporal information from the signal.
We define f as the signal to approximate with the wavelets. We decompose it as: (2)where {φi}i∈n are wavelets from a set , βi the projection of f on {φi}i∈n, Rf the decomposition residue.

The set of wavelets  is built in this way:

(1) There are three mother functions: wavelets of time scale of
– One year
– One week
– One day
We choose those functions for their physical meaning, as they refer to natural or human activity cycles.
(2) Each mother wavelet of time scale ΔT gives two daughter wavelets of time scale ΔT/2.
(3) We iterate the process on daughter wavelets. Time scales are respectively going from 1 year to a 1/32 of year; from 1 week to a 1/4 of week, from one day to a 1/32 of day (=45 minutes).
(4) We optimise the position of the three mother wavelets upon the signal: yearly wavelets are in phase with the alternation summer/winter. Weekly ones fit to the alternation of working days and weekends. Daily ones account for the cycle day/night.
Thus, wavelets are defined on time scales ΔT going from 45 minutes to one year.†


2.1.2 Definitions: characterizing a storage need with energy, power, number of cycles per year. 
We characterize a storage need by
– The amount of energy to be stored E
– The maximum power to be delivered P
– The number of charge/discharge cycles N performed during a year
Those three parameters are computed for a given time scale ΔT (daily storage for instance) and are sufficient to characterize a storage need and determine its lifetime.

Energy (E): the storage energy is the amount of energy that has to be charged and discharged to smooth the signal inside the time step ΔT.

Power (P): the power is computed as , as drawn in Fig. 1.

Number of cycles per year (N): the number of full cycles a storage has to perform per year in order to smooth signal variations of length ΔT.
As drawn in Fig. 1, β is the wavelet maximum and ΔT the oscillation duration. It could also be seen as the charge–discharge time of a storage device. The wavelet decomposition (eqn (2)) enables us to compute the parameters E, P, N as follows: (3)
With i such that φi ∈ ΩΔT. ΩΔT is the set of vector φ with the time scale ΔT.

R

f
 is the difference between f and its decomposition over φi. We perform the decompositions with the following precision  


2.1.3 Relevant indicators. 
Each of the following parameters depends on the cycle length ΔT. In order to simplify the notations they do not appear in the writing.

Service is the total energy dispatched to the grid over a year, by a storage device and for a given time scale. Service = E·N(4)Utilization factor (UF) is the ratio between the energy delivered by a storage throughout a year (E·N) and the maximum energy it could have delivered if running at full power all year long . It goes from 0 to 100%.
Hence UF = N·ΔT(5)
The utilization factor is a distinctive feature of the wavelet transform. A Fourier decomposition would have involved a permanent use of the storage and a utilization factor equal to 100%.

Satisfaction: in cases where storage size is smaller than would be needed, we define satisfaction as the time fraction during which the storage can smooth the residual demand and ensure the balance between load and variable supply. A satisfaction rate lower than 100% enables sizing of the storage for typical needs rather than for exceptional events. Those exceptional events could be managed by back-up power for example.

2.2 Results: wavelet decomposition
We applied the wavelet decomposition to three different electricity generation mixes:
• Fully photovoltaic
• Fully wind power
• A hybrid-mix, the Volt-RTE scenario.‡
Results of the three simulations are compared to the load signal case and displayed in Fig. 3. The satisfaction rate (as defined in Section 2.1.3) used is 95%.
 Fig. 3  
Decomposition of the residual demand of several electricity generation mixes: 100% photovoltaic, 100% wind power, and the intermittent mix from the RTE-Volt scenario: 10% PV, 26.5% wind power. Those results can be compared with the intermittency generated by the load signal. Satisfaction rate, as defined in Section 2.1.3, is 95%. (a) Shows E, the energy capacity that would have to be stored for each time scale. (b) Shows the storage utilization factor, (c) the total energy stored per year. In every case energy capacity strongly increases with the time scale (a). We see in (c) that PV intermittency leads to a high flexibly need at a daily and yearly scale, whereas for wind power it is greatest around the week scale. 

Satisfaction sensitivity: the sensitivity to the value of satisfaction is shown in Fig. 4. Decomposition is applied to the wind power residual demand. We displayed the satisfaction rates of 70%, 90%, 95%, 99% and 100%. Lower satisfaction rates correspond to a longer time for which storage alone does not provide all the required flexibility. Other means such as dispatchable production are needed.
 Fig. 4  
Decomposition of the residual demand for a 100% wind power energy mix for various satisfaction rates, from 70% to 100%. (c) shows that the service provided is not very different from 90% to 100% satisfaction rate. However, the installed energy increases by an order of magnitude (a), while the utilization factor of the storage degrades by the same amount (b), leading to much less profitable storage. 
2.3 Discussion: main features of the wavelet decomposition
The four following indicators provide a description of the flexibility need and show patterns of the different variability characteristics:

Energy to be installed (Fig. 3a and 4a) is an increasing function of the storage duration: it goes from GWh to tens of TWh for yearly storage. The RTE-Volt scenario proposes to install 10% of PV and 26% of wind power (see Fig. 8a). In this case of moderate VRES penetration, the storage energy to be deployed remains close at long time scales to what is needed for the load signal alone.

Utilization factor: Fig. 4b stresses that 100% satisfaction will result in storage devices which are not profitable as they will be little used (have a low utilisation factor). It raises the question of the installation of dispatchable production means for the highest consumption periods: we could size the storage to make sure that it does not satisfy the consumption 100% of the time. In other words, the storage would satisfy the consumption at all time except when exceptional events occur. In this case the exceptional event energy demands – the last percents – would have to be covered by peak generation means.

Service is the total energy that would have to be discharged over a year, for a given time scale (Fig. 3c and 4c). This quantity highlights the specific features of each residual demand:
• Photovoltaic has two maxima, at the day and year scales. It accounts for the day/night and the summer/winter cycles for solar input.
• Wind power intermittency is at its highest between one day and one month. It results from the typical length of wind systems and their dynamics.
• The load is also an intermittent signal. We observe three higher peaks, at the day, week and year scales. It is a pattern of the French consumption behaviour and highlighted by our choice of vector family.
• The Volt scenario has a moderate penetration rate of variable renewable electricity (36%). When compared with only the consumption, we notice that the service is higher at intermediate time scales, but lower at the year scale, thanks to the higher production of wind power during winter, when demand is at its highest. In other words, PV, wind power, and load are not in-phase, so their intermittencies do not add up.

Satisfaction: Fig. 4a reveals that at short time scales there is an energy gap greater than one order of magnitude between 90% and 100% of satisfaction. At 100% it is the exceptional events which set the size of the capacity. Fulfilling the last 5–10 percents of satisfaction requires a strong investment in terms of installed storage capacity – up to a factor of 10 – for a small additional service. It may be more relevant to have “additional production” active only when those rare events occur.
3 Step 2: assessing the sustainability of storage solutions
3.1 Input data: technical characteristics of storage and production devices
We here consider only mature technologies and attested performances. Technologies taken into account are lithium-ion batteries, Compressed air energy storage, Pumped Hydro-electricity and Power-to-gas-to-Power. Their potential is compared with the electricity curtailment. We detail in the following the specificity of those devices. Here we use only the average value of the characteristics of each technology. In order to compare the various devices we characterize the following parameters.

3.1.1 Storage devices. 
We distinguish the energy and power said electrical (Eel, Pel) from the primary (Eprim, Pprim), embodied energy. In a first phase we define the following parameters of storage and production devices:

Lifetime: the lifetime of a technology can be either calendar time or duration of use. To avoid confusion between both we will respectively refer to them as Tlife,cal and Tlife,use. Batteries are also limited by the maximum number of cycles they can perform: Nmax.§ They come to their end of life when Tlife,cal or Nmax is first reached.

Round trip efficiency η: the round-trip efficiency of a storage system is (6)where Ein is the energy that flows into the system, Eout is the energy dispatched by the storage to the grid.

Energy intensity ζ: the energy intensity is the primary embodied energy required to manufacture one unit. This energy could be either normalized by power or energy capacity for storage devices. We refer to the energy intensity normalized by energy or power by, respectively, ζE and ζP.

Capacity factor (CF): capacity factor concerns generation sources. It is the ratio between an actual electrical energy output over a given period of time and the maximum electrical energy possible over the same period, if nominal power was always available.
We have taken into account the following storage devices:

Lithium-ion batteries: we are considering typical stationary Li-ion batteries. The system considered includes the converters, but not the connection to the grid. Li-ion parameters are defined in Table 1.

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES): we consider compressed air energy storage based on two existing demonstrators (McIntosh, Alabama and Huntorf, Germany), with the following process:  
Parameters used are defined in Table 1.
There is another kind of CAES – Advanced Adiabatic CAES (AA-CAES) – in current development with greater efficiency η. However, it is not yet a mature technology. The efficiency would be improved (≃70%20) by using thermal energy storage (TES) devices to cool down the compressed air. The air is then heated in the TES before going into the air turbine. It is not included in this study.
More details about the CAES process are available in ref. 20 and 22.

Pumped Hydro-electricity Storage (PHS): PHS is widely developed all over the world and is a mature technology for electricity storage. Currently most of the world mass electricity storage is performed by PHS.
We consider a typical facility23 equipped with a pump and a generator that connect a lower and an upper reservoir. Parameters used are defined in Table 1.

Power-to-gas-to-Power (P2P): P2P involves the conversion of electricity to hydrogen via electrolysis and sometimes conversion to methane (methanation process). Gas is then compressed, stored, and converted back to electricity via either fuel cells or gas turbines.
The system we took into account is:P2P: Alkaline electrolyzer → H2 → PEM fuel cell
Power-to-gas-to-Power could also be performed with other technologies such as a PEM electrolyzer or a reversible solid-oxid fuel cell. Nevertheless we decided not to include them in the present study due to their lower maturity. We focus on the previously mentioned device. Alkalyne electrolyzers and PEM fuel cells are widespread technologies and their physical characteristics are well defined in the literature. P2P can also go through CH4, using a methanation reaction to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane. We didn't include it in the study either because of its complexity, and the CO2 capture and storage energy penalties.
We consider two ways of storing the hydrogen produced by the electrolyser. The first one is in already existing geological cavities.24 This means that the energy intensity ζ of the storage is negligible: ζH2storage,geol = 0 MJprim·MJLHV,H2−1.
The other way is by storing H2 in steel bottles. Considering hydrogen's low heating value of LHVH2 = 119.96 MJ·kg−1, a steel embodied energy of 40 MJprim·kg−1, we assumed that the bottles are 58 kg cylinders made of steel, with a hydrogen capacity of 0.72 kg at 200 bar.25 We calculate an energy intensity of the bottle of ζH2steel storage = 27 MJprim MJH2,LHV−1.
According to Hirscher,25 technological improvements now allow for hydrogen storage under pressures reaching 700 bars. It involves using various materials for the containers such as carbon fibers and aluminium alloy. However, for the sake of simplicity, we did not include this in our models. Additionally the energy intensity of those bottles are greater than the steel ones. The hydrogen storage options are detailed in Sarkar and Banerjee.26
Parameters used are defined in Table 3.


3.1.2 Energy production facilities. 
We study several electricity generation mix. They include VRES such as PV and wind. We also have to account for base generation provided by nuclear power plants and hydro-electricity for base generation. We characterize four generation facilities by the following parameters (Table 2):

3.2 Methodology: total embodied energy calculation

3.2.1 Energy cost calculation. 
From the technological characterization and the residual demand decomposition, we can now compare storage devices on the energetic investment basis. Investments needed to handle the intermittency are two-fold: a direct one which is the storage cost. And a second which is related to the share of generation sources. Indeed, the generation sources have to be oversized to account for efficiency η < 1, as drawn in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  When the round trip efficiency η of a storage device is <1, the production has to be over-sized by a factor α. It enables to charge more energy in order to discharge as much as needed. 

Storage cost: we assign a direct energy cost to each device.
When a device is characterized by its continuous use lifetime, cost is computed as follows (7)
When limited by the calendar lifetime: (8)
Batteries are both characterized by a maximum number of cycles they can reach and a calendar lifetime: (9)

Production cost: storage cost does not take into account the round-trip efficiency η. When η < 1 more energy is charged than discharged. To account for it we consider that the whole electrical generation system has to be oversized to compensate for the non-perfect efficiency. The additional embodied energy for the electrical generation system has to be accounted for (Fig. 5).
We call α the over-sizing factor, so that P → (1 + α)P, where P is the installed power of the generation system.
In what follows, the method to compute the over-sizing factor α is detailed: let us denote 〈〉 the mean over a year of a given quantity.
Before over-sizing, the equation 〈production〉 = 〈consumption〉 = P must be fulfilled.
Considering a single wavelet φ of the decomposition, βpi and βci are respectively the projection of the production and the consumption on this vector.¶ Index i refers to a given time position over a given time scale ΔT.
Before over-sizing, 〈production〉 = 〈consumption〉 = P. After over-sizing, 〈production〉 = (1 + α)P and the projection of the production becomes (1 + α)·βp.
The device is charged in the first half of ΔT. The power of charge isPcharge,i = (P + βpi)(1 + αi) − P − βciDischarge power in the second half of the time step isPdischarge,i = η·Pcharge,i = ((P + βpi)(1 + αi) − P − βci)·ηDischarge power plus production should be at least equal to the consumption at all time i. It can be written as∀i, Pdischarge,i + Pproduction,i ≥ Pconsumption,ii.e.  
A symbol ± appears because βp − βc could be either positive or negative. Thereby (10)
We use the same α to over-size each element of the electricity generation system. For each production device k, we denote by Pk the average power generated by this element, CFk its capacity factor. Therefore  is the power which is actually installed. ζP,k is the energy intensity of the production device normalized by its power. Thus  is the embodied energy invested to set up the electricity production system.
Thus the additional annual cost due to the over-sizing can be calculated as: (11)
If the production system is made of several electricity generation devices such as for the RTE-Volt scenario, we sum the costs associated with each technology.


3.2.2 The “Service/Costs” ratio: a global ESOI. 
We define the ratio service/costs for each time scale and technology, as  
This is a global ESOI because it accounts for the total embodied energy attributable to the storage: the embodied energy of the storage itself and of the production over-sizing due to the storage efficiency lower than 100%. The Service is calculated as defined in Section 2.1.3 and does not depend on the flexibility means used (storage efficiency or oversizing factor). Physically, the Service correponds partly to energy stored and discharged from the storage, and partly to additional energy produced thanks to oversizing and directly consumed.
Both service and costs are yearly produced or consumed energy. Service is expressed in terms of electrical energy, costs in terms of primary energy. We simulate the electricity curtailment by assigning a null cost and a null efficiency to the storage. Therefore, only the investment to oversize the production is weighting in the ESOI calculation.

3.3 Results: an energy return on investment analysis

3.3.1 Assessing the sustainability. 
ESOI ratios are shown in Fig. 6. For a given storage duration, each of the five storage technologies have a different ratio service/costs. A high ratio (≫1) means that the storage device will deliver much more electrical energy throughout its life than primary energy was used for its fabrication and the oversizing of the production system. Thus, high ESOI areas on heatmaps of Fig. 6 give trends of relevance for the use of each technology. ESOI of the different storage technologies is also compared with the electricity curtailment. In a strategy of sustainable development, only solutions with ESOI ≫ 1 are relevant.
 Fig. 6  ESOI ratio (service/cost) plotted for three different residual demands. This ratio is a function of the storage time scale and depends on the storage device. The higher and the darker, the more relevant it is to use the device. Thus, the light areas stress the functions for which the use of a storage device is unsuitable. Results are computed for a satisfaction rate of 95% as drawn on Fig. 3. 
The three heatmaps of Fig. 6 show that the field of relevance of each technology follows similar paterns, independently of the electricity generation mix. However, we see that ESOI values decrease with the penetration rate of renewables, and even faster if the storage efficiency is low (CAES, P2P, and of course for curtailment). This effect is most visible for PV production at the daily time scale: as the production vanishes during nights, oversizing has no effect and low efficiency storages have low ESOI values.
Li-ion batteries are relevant, regarding energy return on investment, for storage time scales going from the hour up to two days. PHS covers a wider range which goes from the hour to the month. CAES might be relevant for similar time scales as PHS, but is more sensitive to high VRES penetration rates. Regarding power-to-power, it could be the only potential technology able to handle seasonal storage if hydrogen was stored in geological cavities. However storing H2 in steel bottles drops the long time scale ESOI and makes P2P ESOI profitable only up to the month. The values are strongly lowered by high VRES penetration.
We notice that the ESOI of long time scales – except from free H2 storage – are lower than those obtained with electricity curtailment. In fact low-investment, low-efficiency technologies such as P2P with free H2 storage can be seen as an improved curtailment.


3.3.2 Sensitivity analysis. 
We proceed to a sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the impacts of potential technological improvements. It is applied to each scenario and compared to the nominal case of Fig. 6 described above. Results for scenario Volt are shown on Fig. 7. The technological characteristics are modified as follows:
 Fig. 7  Sensibility analysis realised on RTE-Volt scenario as displayed on Fig. 6c. Energy intensity ζ of Li-ion batteries was divided by 2. Efficiency η of CAES and P2P were raised to 60% and 50% respectively. The ESOI ratio (service/cost) is a function of the storage time scale and depends on the storage device. The higher and the darker, the more relevant it is to use the device. Thus, the light areas stress the functions for which the use of a storage device is unsuitable. Results are computed for a satisfaction rate of 95% as drawn on Fig. 3. 

Li-ion batteries: as embodied energy is the major cost factor for Li-ion batteries, it was divided by two. One could expect such an improvement from a more efficient use of innovative materials for electrodes and electrolytes, and an improvement in energy intensive process steps such as electrode drying.ζE = 2 × 106 → 106 MJprim·MWhelec−1andζP = 2 × 106 → 106·MJprim·MWelec−1With those parameters the Li-ion remains profitable on twice longer time scales, up to 4 days instead of 2.

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES): we raised the round-trip electrical efficiency of the device up to a typical efficiency targetted by advanced adiabatic CAES.20,22ηCAES = 35% → 60%Compressed air energy storage thus remains relevant for the same time scale range with an ESOI ratio closer to the PHS's one. However, one should take care that higher efficiency will probably come with higher embodied energy, especially from the thermal storage.

Power-to-gas-to-Power (P2P): as the over-sizing of the production system is the major cost factor for P2P, we raised the round-trip electrical efficiency of the device.ηP2P = 30% → 50%With this efficiency P2P with H2 storage in geological cavities shows higher ESOI and remains relevant for every time scale. However when hydrogen is assumed to be stored in steel bottles, the ESOI is degraded to values lower than 1 at time scales longer than months.
Overall, we observe trends similar to ones of Fig. 6, with higher ESOI.

3.4 Discussion
To summarize, we show above that Li-ion batteries have higher ESOI at time scales shorter than two days. It could be understood in this way: batteries are energy efficient (80%) but also have a high embodied energy when compared with other devices. Hence the battery has to perform many cycles to discharge more energy than what was embodied. They can afford to cycle a lot because of the good efficiency.
In contrast power-to-power presents a low embodied energy for the conversion system (electrolyser and fuel cell) and the ESOI remains >1 even for a few cycles per year, as long as the embodied energy of H2 storage is not included. Two cases were distinguished for power-to-power: first for the case where H2 is stored in geological cavities with a zero energy investment requirement; and second for the case when hydrogen is stored in steel bottles with the required energy input. We notice that above a month-long duration storage, the energy intensity of bottles prevails over the other costs and ESOI dramatically drops towards 0. The low efficiency of power-to-power implies that the oversizing of the production system is a dominant cost. As a consequence, it is less suited to higher VRES penetration rates, which imply higher and more costly oversizing.
Concerning the pumped hydro-electricity storage, it covers a wide range of time scales, from hour to weeks with very good ESOI. However its deployment is restricted by the site availability. Compressed air energy storage covers the same range of time scales with lower ESOI ratios. The sensibility analysis reflects the potential of advanced adiabatic CAES which has higher ESOI. However, the latter is meant to be used at a daily scale, due to technological constraints. CAES deployment will also be limited be the geological caverns availibility, a parameter which is not included in this study. Additionally, compressed air takes 100 times the volume of hydrogen for the same stored energy. This energy density competition might be an extra limitation to the CAES development.
Comparing Fig. 6a and b with Fig. 6c stresses that the higher the VRES penetration rate is, the smaller is the field of relevance of every technology. It is partly because the energetic investment of PV and wind power are greater than those of nuclear and hydro power. The other explanation comes from the energy cannibalism (ref. 32, p. 19): the growth of a specific variable source generates electricity at times where there is already too much. Symmetrically, when there is a lack of production, the minimum power produced decreases with a growing share of VRES. Thus, the required oversizing increases with the share of VRES, and particularly for low efficiency technologies such as CAES and P2P. On the contrary, a moderate penetration rate such as in the Volt scenario makes those solutions more profitable.

3.4.1 Towards a better understanding – an example. 
As explained in Section 3.2.1, . Costs are two fold, the storage one and the production over-sizing participation.
In order to understand the meaning of those results, we are going to focus on a specific value, in the Volt scenario (see Fig. 6c). For a yearly storage, with power-to-power storage, ESOI = 12, 8 (no H2 storage is considered in order not to weigh on the embodied energy investment). For this point, here are the figures:  
An investment of 1.76 TWhprim year−1 primary embodied energy is involved to set up the production means. The storage cost is 0.66 TWhprim year−1.
Finally (12)
Two inherent features of low efficiency storage are worth highlighting. First, a large part of the service (nearly two thirds here) is provided by the production over-sizing, which delivers electricity directly to fulfill the demand without charging and discharging the storage. Second, the cost is also dominated by the energetic investment required to oversize the production. The pie charts in Fig. 8 stress the share of the production cost. Even if VRES only represent 36% of the generation mix, they account for more than 50% of the total energetic cost (storage + over-production).

It includes the energy invested for storage and to oversize the electricity generation sources. (a) shows production source shares of the RTE-Volt scenario. 

3.5 Limits of the methodology
This work takes into account a few parameters and only one energy vector, the electricity. It would be interesting to study the complementarity with other vectors – heat or gas, without return to the electricity vector – to fulfil the energy storage needs at time scales longer than a month. The results also highly depend on input data we are using to characterize the technologies. They are drawn from life cycle analysis and some have a huge uncertainty whereas they should be as accurate as possible.
The tool presented throughout the study is a technical analysis, not a full systemic simulation. We cannot deduce from it how the storage devices interact with one another. It typically cannot predict if a device set up for weekly storage would also ensure the daily storage. Therefore our results should be considered as orders of magnitude.
There are no grid losses, nor storage self-discharge considered in this work. This is another point that should be taken into account in a future work, with the location of production sources, storage facilities, and consumption. The study reflects the French demand; applicability to other parts of the world could be different.
It would be interesting to analyse a larger number of years to improve the statistical significance of the results. It would also enable addressing the inter-annual variability such as el Niño or la Niña phenomena. However, we checked on the available data that the flexibility need decreases at time scales longer than one year.
4 Conclusion
The methodology we propose enables the quantification of flexibility and determination of relevance for possible energy storage choices according to their ESOI index. Applied to different electricity generation mixes in France, with various VRES penetration rates, it bares out the difference between photovoltaic and wind power intermittency patterns.
The former requires a high storage capacity at a daily and yearly level. It accounts for the cycles of days and seasons. Whereas wind power has a stronger variability from the day to week scales. Wind patterns are not as consistent as the PV ones. They are more spread out and last much longer.
The example of a moderate penetration of variable renewable electricity scenario – RTE-Volt electricity mix, 36% – shows that intermittency is not additive. Wind power and PV are not running in phase and do not have the same dynamics. Therefore, using different VRES in an electrical mix lowers the variability that has to be handled, at certain time scales.
The methodology – based on the energetic return on investment (EROI) – highlights the usage field of relevance of commonly used storage devices. Li-ion batteries – with high investment and high efficiency – are well suited for storage time scales up to days, while Pumped Hydro-electricity Storage (PHS) is relevant up to weeks. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is also able to ensure storage up to the week scale, but with lower return on investment than PHS. The performance of Power-to-gas-to-Power (P2P) is very dependent upon the hydrogen storage means. If hydrogen storage is nearly free (geological cavities), seasonal storage is possible. Otherwise, the energy investment necessary to manufacture the bottles precludes its use for durations longer than one month. The share of Variable Renewable Energy Sources in the electricity mix has also a strong impact: the higher it is, the less relevant are storage technologies with low energy efficiency (P2P, CAES).
Finally, oversizing the production system and curtailing the excess electricity becomes an interesting option at long time scales for moderate VRES shares. To go a step further, a low-investment, low-efficiency storage such as P2P with free hydrogen storage can be seen as an improvement over this curtailing strategy, lowering the necessary oversizing.
The present study also points out that ensuring the load and supply balance at any time via electricity storage requires a much bigger energetic investment than allowing a mismatch for a short period of time. Hence, it would make sense for energy storage devices to go hand in hand with dispatchable generation means in order not to size the system based on the extreme events.
The present study focuses on the French scenario. However, it could be generalized to other countries by adapting hypotheses such as the input load signal and the capacity factors. Indeed, electricity consumption habits could vary from a country to the other, as well as the patterns of wind and sunshine. As a future work, the methodology presented here could also be used to look at the equivalent CO2 return on investment, or the economical return on investment instead of the embodied energy.

Broader context
Large deployment of variable renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and wind power poses new challenges for electricity grid management. As their production depends on the weather, power supply does not always match the demand pattern. Therefore, flexibility is required to balance supply and demand. It can be provided either by flexible demand (demand-side management), flexible supply (dispatchable power sources), or by energy storage. The present study focuses on the potential of electricity storage to average in time the production variability. Using an energy return on investment methodology, we show that Li-ion batteries and Pumped Hydro-electric Storage are relevant for short time scale storage (days to weeks respectively). In contrast, we point out that none of the existing technologies are suitable for seasonal storage. This underlines the complementarity between storage and other flexibility means, especially dispatchable power plants. Long-term flexibility could also be provided by coupling the electricity system with other energy vectors. For instance, thermal energy has the potential for efficient and low cost seasonal storage.

Utilization factor	Ratio between the energy delivered by a storage over a given period of time and the maximum energy it could have delivered within the same period. It goes from 0 to 100%.
Service	Total energy, over a year, that would be discharged to the grid by a storage device and for a given time scale use.
Dispatchable	Refers to electricity generation sources that can be used on demand and dispatched according to the needs of the electricity system.
Curtailment	Electricity curtailment is a reduction in the output of a generation sources during periods of oversupply in lieu of grid flexibility.
Footnotes
† For mathematical reasons, wavelets have to be as much as possible orthogonal with one another. This is why cycle length ΔT of daughter wavelets are sub-multiples of the mother cycle length.
‡ Volt is developed by RTE, the French TSO.10 It is a moderate VRES penetration scenario with 10% of PV, 26% of wind power, 10% of hydro-electricity and 54% of nuclear power by 2035.
§ For the sake of simplicity we consider that Nmax is independent from the loading/unloading history.
¶ For the sake of simplicity we assume in this section that ∀i, βpi > 0 and βci > 0. However, this result remains valid in the general case.
