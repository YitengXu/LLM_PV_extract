        WO3 mesoporous films were prepared using a sol–gel method to serve as the photoanode for water cleavage in a 1 M HClO4 solution with Pt as the counter electrode. Post-treatment of the as-synthesized WO3 film with methanol and ethanol vapors, especially with methanol, improves the photocurrent during photoelectrolysis of water. Water and hexane vapors have a deleterious influence on the WO3 film. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that treatment with methanol vapors did not alter the configuration of the nanocrystalline framework or the WO3 mesoscopic structure. Optical absorption and W L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structural analyses also revealed that the W-ion electronic and oxidation states remained unchanged after methanol treatment. However, extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis of the W L3-edge showed that the coordination number of W6+ sites in the WO3 film significantly increased with the methanol treatment, indicating a corresponding decrease in the defect-state density of the film. The observed increase in the coordination number resulted in a 25% increase in the electron transit rate of the WO3 film and enhanced solar energy conversion by 32% for the photoelectrolysis of water. We conclude that post-treatment with methanol vapor remedies the defect region in nanocrystalline WO3 films, and improves the film's electron transport performance in a photoelectrochemical cell.
Introduction
The visible light-induced cleavage of water into hydrogen and oxygen gases remains the main target of current photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic research.1–12Titanium dioxide is stable toward photo-oxidation over a wide pH range (except for some acid solutions).13 However, the large TiO2 band gap (3.0–3.2 eV) is a poor match to the solar spectrum as it absorbs only light at wavelengths below 400 nm. Tungsten trioxide (WO3), an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of approximately 2.6 eV, can be used as a stable photoanode under acidic conditions, at pH less than four.5 This makes WO3 a candidate material for water splitting under visible light illumination. It remains to be determined how the WO3 crystal structure influences the operational behavior of photogenerated charge.

        WO3 films can be synthesized by several different methods including anodic oxidation,14,15solvothermal synthesis,16 and sol–gel synthesis.8,17,18 However, defect sites are always present in the consequential WO3 products, and are associated with crystal lattice disorder due to the presence of impurities and/or vacancies.19 Under illumination, electrons in the semiconductor or photocatalytic materials' valence band are excited to the materials' conduction band, generating holes. Using n-type WO3 as a photoanode in aqueous solution (see Scheme 1), photogenerated holes oxidize water molecules at the WO3 electrode/water interface to form oxygen molecules.5,8 The photogenerated electrons travel through the WO3 film and through an external circuit to the counter electrode where protons are reduced to generate hydrogen molecules.20 Thus, electron transport in the WO3 electrode plays a critical role for effective water cleavage.
 Scheme 1  Processes of charge transport, back transfer, and chemical interaction in a photoelectrochemical cell for water cleavage. The n-type semiconducting photoanode is positively biased for generation of O2 gas, with corresponding H2 gas generation on the counter electrode. VCB, VVB, VFB, and EF represent the conduction-band, valence-band, flat-band, and Fermi-energy levels of the electrodes. 
A mesoporous structure is essential for water splitting photoelectrodes to enhance the aqueous solution's accessibility to the WO3 film.8 However, mesoporous films are of a nanocrystalline nature and contain numerous crystal defects at the grain boundaries. The defect states trap traveling electrons, impeding their transport, and may cause their electron recombination with the holes.21–25 Many tactics exist to improve charge transport, such as synthesizing phase-pure semiconductor electrodes,21,26 combining semiconductors to form composites,22,27–29 and extensively calcining metal oxides to decrease the density of oxygen vacancies.30 Vapor post-treatment of semiconductor films can restructure the crystal framework and reduce defects, while retaining the mesoporous film framework.31,32 This method is simple to apply, and deserves in-depth investigation.
The defect-state density of a metal oxide is associated with the chemical environment of the metal ions. In this study, we employed X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy to probe the coordination environment of the W6+ ions in the prepared WO3 samples. XAFS is capable of probing the short to medium range structure around an absorbing atom, and this feature complements X-ray diffraction techniques, which cannot detect amorphous phases.33
We employed a non-sophisticated sol–gel route to synthesize n-type WO3 mesoporous films, to serve as oxygen-producing photoelectrodes in the splitting of water. From XAFS analysis, we found that transport efficiency of photogenerated electrons in the WO3 films correlates with the coordination number (CN) of W6+ ions. Alcohol vapor treatment increases the W6+CN in the WO3 film, thereby enhancing the electron transport and water splitting efficiency of the WO3 films.
Experimental

        WO3 colloids were synthesized using sol–gel hydrolysis, and the W-containing particles were deposited as a film onto a glass substrate. In preparing the sol–gel solution, 1.5 g of WCl6 (Aldrich), 10 g of anhydrous ethanol (Merck), and 0.25 g of tri-block copolymer HO(CH2CH2O)20(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2CH2O)20H (EO20PO70EO20, also designated as P123; Aldrich) were mixed with stirring for 4 h at room temperature. The W6+ cations interact with the ethanol (ROH) molecules according to the following equation:34–36WCl6 + 6ROH → W(OR)6 + 6HClThe resulting W-containing paste was applied to a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass substrate (Nippon) by spin coating. The as-deposited films were left in air for 30 min to allow the solvent to evaporate, and then heated in air at 40 °C. Hydrolysis and condensation of W(OR)6 occurred when the films were exposed to ambient moisture during the heating process.37
To prepare a nanocrystalline WO3 film on the FTO substrate, the dried W-containing films were calcined in air at 500 °C for 30 min to remove copolymer and complete the condensation. The resulting WO3 had a thickness of 4 μm and an active area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. For preparing samples for vapor treatment, the WO3 films were suspended in a Teflon-lined autoclave containing a solvent of methanol, ethanol, hexane, or water. During the vapor treatment, the autoclave was maintained at 140 °C for 18 h and the films did not come into contact with the liquid-phase solvent.
The crystalline structure of the WO3 films was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy using a diffractometer (Rigaku RINT 2100) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD patterns were collected with a step interval of 0.01° at a scan rate of 4 deg min−1 in the 2θ range of 20–70°. The external feature was explored with scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Jeol JSM-6700F). The optical absorption spectra of the WO3 films were obtained using a Hitachi-U4100 spectrophotometer. The structural features and chemical environment of the W6+ sites in WO3 specimens were characterized with XAFS spectra, which were recorded at room temperature in a transmission mode on the Wiggler beam line of the Taiwan Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. A double-crystal Si(111) monochromator was used for the W L3-edge (10.207 keV) experiments and X-rays were generated from a 1.5 GeV electron storage ring with a current range of 120–200 mA. Photon energy was calibrated using the characteristic pre-edge peaks in the absorption spectrum of a tungsten foil. The spectrum scans, including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were collected from −200 eV to 1000 eV, relative to the energy at the transition edges. Analysis of the EXAFS data was performed with UWX-AFS 3.0 and FEFF 7.0 software programs.38 Fourier transform was used on the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillation in the range of 3–12 Å−1. Only the W–O shell R-space fitting of the EXAFS data was used for structural analysis.
The WO3 film electrode photoelectrochemical reactions were carried out in a two-armed cell equipped with a quartz window, using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode, respectively. An aqueous solution of 1.0 M HClO4 (pH of approximately 0) served as the electrolyte to maintain WO3 film stability. An Oriel 300 W xenon lamp in conjunction with an IR (>800 nm) cutoff filter served as the light source. The AM 1.5 filter (Oriel 81092) was placed in the light beam to simulate AM 1.5-type solar illumination, and the intensity of the light irradiated on the WO3 films was fixed at 100 mW cm−2. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were recorded, using an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments 614B), with a scan from 0.2 to 2.4 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) at a linear rate of 10 mV s−1. All measurements were conducted under ambient conditions.
We analyzed the films using intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) using illumination from a blue light emitting diode (λmax = 455 nm), driven by a frequency response analyzer (XPOT, Zahner). Light intensity was controlled (±5%) by modulating the voltage applied to the diode with a sinusoidal perturbation. The modulation frequency range was from 0.1–500 Hz at a light intensity of 15 mW cm−2.
Auxiliary photocatalytic O2 evolution tests over the WO3 specimens were conducted in a gas-closed inner irradiation system, at approximately 25 °C. The light source was a 400 W high-pressure mercury lamp (SEN HL400EH-5). A jacket between the mercury lamp and the reaction chamber was filled with flowing, thermostatically controlled aqueous NaNO2 solution (1 M) as a filter to block UV light.39–41 Only visible light (λ > 400 nm) reached the reaction chamber for photocatalytic reactions. The WO3 photocatalyst powders (50 mg), obtained by scraping the deposited WO3 films, were suspended in the reaction chamber, containing AgNO3 solution (1.5 L, 0.01 M) for O2 evolution tests. The amount of evolved O2 was determined using gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 7890; molecular sieve 5A column, thermal conductivity detector, argon carrier gas).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized and vapor-treated WO3 films. All of the films belong to the monoclinic WO3 crystal system, shown at the bottom of Fig. 1 (a = 7.301 Å, b = 7.539 Å, c = 7.689 Å, β = 90.9°; JCPDS 83-0951). This monoclinic phase is effective in absorbing visible light, and is thus expected to provide excellent photoelectrochemical performance.9 The films treated with methanol, ethanol and hexane have XRD patterns similar to that of the as-synthesized film, whereas the water-treated film exhibits lower XRD peak intensities. The water treatment may have resulted in hydrolysis and thus deterioration of the WO3 structure. Because of the poor photoelectrochemical performance found during preliminary tests, the water-treated film is not considered in the following discussion.

The standard diffraction pattern of monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS 83-0951) is shown at the bottom of this figure. 

Fig. 2 shows top-view SEM images of the WO3 films. All the films exhibit a randomly oriented network of WO3 nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm. This networked configuration allows facile penetration of aqueous solutions for intimate contact and interaction with the WO3 nanoparticle surface. By comparing the SEM images of all the films, we found that treatment with organic vapors did not influence the configuration of the nanoparticle-necking framework.

Fig. 3a shows diffuse reflectance spectra of the WO3 films. These spectra were converted from reflection to absorbance using the Kubelka–Munk method.42 The absorption onset for all the films occurs at approximately 470 nm. WO3 has an indirect band gap,43 and a plot of the square root of the absorption energy (αE, where α is the absorbance) against photon energy (E) provides the energy for indirect gap transition.11,44,45 From a linear extrapolation, Fig. 3b shows that all the WO3 films had an indirect gap transition energy of approximately 2.5 eV. The results of the XRD and optical absorption indicate that treatment with the organic vapors had little influence on the mesoscopic structure and optical properties of the WO3 film.

The WO3 films were used as photoanodes in the proposed photoelectrochemical system for water oxidation, in aqueous HClO4 solution under AM 1.5-type solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 4 shows a plot of the photocurrent density vs. applied potential for the illuminated WO3 films, starting at a voltage slightly negative to the illuminated photoelectrode's open circuit voltage. The current density in darkness was negligible for potentials of more negative values up to 1.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), reflecting the high stability of the WO3 films. Under illumination, the anodic photocurrent showed a constant increase under positive potential bias, indicating the films' n-type nature. The WO3 valence band is positive enough for oxidation of water, while the conduction band is not sufficiently negative for water reduction.8 The anodic potential bias on the WO3 films results in a corresponding cathodic bias at the counter electrode, and is the cause of the photocurrents represented in Fig. 4.

A Pt sheet was the counter electrode and the electrolyte was an aqueous HClO4 solution (1 M). 
The photocurrent onset occurs at approximately 0.4 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), this is a much more negative value than that of the dark current onset, at approximately 1.8 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl). Under illumination, all the photogenerated charge carriers recombine or are lost in interfacial reactions at voltage below the onset potential.20 At potentials more positive than 0.4 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), photogenerated electrons travel through the WO3 film and the external circuit and reduce water at the Pt electrode, with corresponding water oxidation by the valence-band holes in the illuminated WO3 electrode (see Scheme 1). The WO3 conduction band serves as the electron passage, to render separation of the photoinduced charges. The efficiency of electron transport in the nanocrystalline WO3 film is a critical factor determining the overall cell performance.23,24 The transport of photoinduced electrons in the WO3 conduction band is related to the defect-state density of the nanocrystalline films.

Fig. 4 shows that the methanol and ethanol treated films produce greater photocurrents than the as-synthesized film does, and that methanol produces a greater current than ethanol does. The hexane treatment caused a reduction of the WO3 film's photocurrent. The photocurrent data appeared contradictory with XRD and optical absorption results, which showed little influence from the type of organic vapor treatment. The microstructure of the WO3 film must have changed as a result of the vapor treatments. The vapor pressures of hexane, ethanol, and methanol at 140 °C are 6.1, 7.7, and 11 bar, respectively. Since different results were obtained from pressurization, the chemical structure of the vapor molecules should be considered to account for changes in the WO3 film microstructure. We suggest that the improved photocurrent implies that the alcoholic vapor treatments may have remedied structural defects at the microscopic level that cannot be detected by XRD or optical analysis. The hexane treatment, on the other hand, may have led to distortion of microscopic crystalline structure resulting in suppressed photocurrent. To explore how the alcoholic vapor treatments influenced microstructure, we evaluated the defect-state density using XAFS to probe the chemical environment of the W6+ cations in the WO3 films.

Fig. 5 shows the W L3-edge XANES patterns for the as-synthesized, ethanol-treated, and methanol-treated WO3 films. The film patterns are all similar, indicating that tungsten ions in the films had similar oxidation states and d-orbital electronic states.46 This is in accord with our optical absorption results. A focused inspection on the absorption edges of the three WO3 films shows that the absorption edge shifts to higher energy values with the alcohol treatments (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The shift can be attributed to the interaction or coordination of the hydroxyl moiety of the alcohols with the surface tungsten atoms. The energy shift is rather minor, indicating that the alcohols interact with the WO3 surface, not interior. We also provide the second derivative spectra of Fig. 5 for a detailed comparison (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The similar pattern of the second derivative spectra reflects that the oxidation state of tungsten has little difference among these three samples. However, the peak positions of the second derivative spectra exhibit a slight shift toward high absorption energy, confirming the interaction of the alcohols with the WO3 surface.

The W L3-edge EXAFS provides information on the local structure of the tungsten species.46EXAFS data are obtained from the scattering of neighboring atoms, and provide quantitative coordination information for the target ions. Fig. 6 shows Fourier transformed spectra (FTs) of k3χ(k) EXAFS for the WO3 films, with a radial distance ranging from 0–6 Å. The k wave function fitting results of the WO3 films are also provided (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The spectra in Fig. 6 have been corrected for phase shift. Table 1 summarizes the bond distance (R) and coordination number (CN) of the first, second, and third shells (W–O1, –O2, and –O3) obtained by FEFF simulation in a range of 0.6–2.5 Å.46 The fitting comprises three groups containing two oxygen atoms each.47 The data for the monoclinic WO3 model compound are also shown for comparison. The specimens' CNs were smaller than those of the monoclinic WO3 model compound because of the film's nanocrystalline features, whereas the film's R values were similar to those of the model compound. The reduced CNs may result from either lattice disorder or oxygen vacancies, or both.48–50 These defect states, caused by lattice disorder and oxygen vacancies, serve as the trap sites in the WO3 film's electron transport pathway.21Table 1 shows that alcohol vapor treatments, and the methanol treatment in particular, promoted the W6+ ion CN toward the ideal value, and therefore reduced the WO3 film's defect state density. We ascribe the greater photocurrent produced by the alcohol-treated WO3 films to swifter electron transport in the remedied WO3 films. As the XANES spectra have indicated that tungsten ions in the films had similar oxidation states, the difference in the CN of the WO3 films (Table 1) is mainly due to the different degrees of lattice disorder.

To identify how the defect states in WO3 affect electron transport during water splitting, we subjected the as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 films to IMPS analysis. The IMPS technique measures the response of the photocurrent to modulation in incident light intensity, which is a constant dc illumination intensity superimposed with a small sinusoidal perturbation.23,24,51 During the IMPS measurements, the WO3 electrodes were biased at 1.5 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). In the case of a uniform electron diffusion pattern, a typical IMPS plot is characterized by a semicircular feature in the complex plane. Fig. 7 shows the IMPS responses of the WO3 films illuminated with a blue light emitting diode (λmax = 455 nm) at 15 mW cm−2. The IMPS plots show the real and imaginary components of the photo-modulated current, Re(J) and Im(J), respectively, at varying modulation frequency, f. We can estimate the average transit time (τd) of the photogenerated electron in the WO3 films from the relation τd = (2πfmin)−1, where fmin is the frequency at the minimum Im(J) observed in the IMPS plot.51 The average transit times for the as-synthesized and methanol-treated films were 2.0 × 10−2 and 1.6 × 10−2 s, respectively; the latter exhibited a 25% higher electron transit rate than the former. Hence, the methanol-treated films must have less frequent electron trapping for swifter electron transport. This is in line with the EXAFS results, which showed a smaller defect-state density for the methanol-treated film.
 Fig. 7  The IMPS responses of the photoelectrochemical cells assembled with the as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 biased at 1.5 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). A blue light emitting diode (λ = 455 nm) was used as the modulation light source with a dc intensity of 15 mW cm−2 and superimposed 5% ac intensity. The frequency at the Im(J) minimum (fmin) is indicated in the figure. 
A large fraction of photoinjected electrons were lost by recombination during traveling through the film because of the defected structure of the nanocrystalline WO3 films. The maximum value of Re(J) at the low frequency limit corresponds to the current needed to calculate the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency. The IMPS results show that the methanol-treated films had a much greater photon-to-current conversion efficiency than the as-synthesized film did. This improvement in photon energy conversion results from the suppressed recombination of photogenerated electrons with holes in the valence band or the oxidizing species in the electrolyte (Scheme 1), or both, due to promoted electron transport.
We conducted auxiliary particle-suspension experiments to illustrate the differences in surface states on WO3 for interfacial electron recombination. These experiments were performed in an inner irradiation cell, containing aqueous AgNO3 solution (1.5 L, 0.01 M). The WO3 conduction band edge is not sufficiently negative to reduce H2O. Ag+ ions in the solution serve as sacrificial electron scavengers to assist water splitting for O2 generation, accompanied by metallic Ag deposition on the WO3 surface.39–41Fig. 8 shows photocatalytic O2 evolution over WO3 powders obtained by scraping the deposited WO3 films from the FTO substrate. With no potential bias in the suspension system, the WO3 powders are capable of oxidizing water to produce oxygen gas under visible light. Fig. 8 shows that methanol treatment significantly suppressed WO3 activity toward O2 production. The reaction mechanism for the particle-suspension system is different from that of the photoelectrochemical system illustrated in Scheme 1. In the particle-suspension system the photogenerated electrons must interact with the aqueous solution at the particle surface for the corresponding hole interaction to give O2 evolution. However, in the photoelectrochemical system efficient travelling of the photogenerated electrons through the WO3 films is essential and interaction of the electrons at the WO3 surface has to be suppressed for high conversion efficiency. The result in Fig. 8 indicates that the treatment reduced the probability of interfacial reaction of photogenerated electrons with Ag+ ions, and therefore suppressed H2O oxidation by holes. When the methanol treatment was applied to the photoelectrochemical cell, suppression of the interfacial reaction facilitated the electron path through the mesoporous WO3 film and the external circuit for H2 evolution at the Pt counter electrode (Scheme 1).
 Fig. 8  Time course of O2 gas evolution from a 0.01 M aqueous AgNO3 solution suspended with 50 mg of as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 photocatalyst powders under visible-light irradiation. 
Assuming that hydrogen generation consumed all of the photocurrent flowing from the photoelectrode to the Pt counter electrode,52 the conversion efficiency, ηc, representing the percentage of light energy converted to chemical energy for a given bias potential, is calculated by the following equation:53ηc (%) = [(energy converted to chemical reactions − energy supplied by external bias)/energy of incident light] × 100 = [Jp(ΔG°rev − Ebias)/J0] × 100where ΔG°rev is the Gibbs free energy per coulomb of electrons for water splitting, Ebias is the difference between the applied and the open-circuit voltages, 1.23 V, Jp represents the photocurrent density and J0 is the intensity of the incident light, which is 100 mW cm−2. The above equation reflects a tradeoff between the power output required for water splitting and the external power supplied in converting light energy. Fig. 9 shows the conversion efficiency of the as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 films based on the applied voltage dependence of the photocurrent density shown in Fig. 4. This tradeoff provides a maximum conversion efficiency of 0.41% for the as-synthesized WO3 film at 0.9 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) and 0.54% for the methanol-treated film at 0.9 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). This facile methanol treatment improved the solar energy conversion efficiency of the WO3 photoanode by 32% over the non-vapor treated film.

At this stage in our research, we do not understand how the vapor treatments vary the WO3 microstructure; however, we believe that pressurization in the autoclave can lead to the rearrangement of the microstructure of the WO3 film,33 and the resulting rearrangement would depend upon the rearrangement kinetics. When pressurized under hexane, structural rearrangement is fast due to hexane's hydrophobic properties, and may result in distortion of the WO3 lattice. Pressurization under water vapor led to strong interactions between WO3 and water molecules, which disturbed the WO3 framework. When alcohols were used, the hydroxyl moiety may interact with WO3 and mediate the rearrangement process. This is because the atomic composition of the nanocrystalline WO3 surface is nonstoichiometric and the hydroxyl moiety of alcohols can add onto the free valences on the surface tungsten atoms with a consequential impact on structural variation. Such mediation by interaction with the tungsten's free valences would allow a gradual rearrangement of the constituting atoms toward the final crystal structure. The nanocrystalline WO3 films are populated with crystal grain boundaries, making the CN of the films sensitive to the alcohol treatments. The methanol molecule, with a shorter hydrophobic tail than the ethanol molecule, proved a more effective agent in optimizing the WO3 structure.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated a facile vapor treatment for WO3 nanocrystalline films, to increase the coordination number of W ions and increase the electron transit rate in the WO3 film during the photoelectrolysis of water. The WO3 film, obtained from calcination of sol–gel synthesized WO3 colloids, contained a substantial quantity of defect states. XRD and optical absorption analyses showed that hexane, ethanol, and methanol vapor treatments did not influence the mesoscopic structure of the as-synthesized WO3 film, whereas water vapor caused deterioration in the WO3 nanocrystalline framework. The alcohol-treated films, and in particular, the methanol-treated film, exhibited enhanced photocurrent during the photoelectrolysis of water, whereas the hexane treatment resulted in a reduced photocurrent. EXAFS analysis showed that a high tungsten coordination number, corresponding to low defect-state density in the WO3 films, occurred for the WO3 films that were treated with ethanol and methanol (most pronounced for the latter). IMPS analysis showed that the low-defect WO3 film, produced by treatment with methanol vapors, had an electron transit rate 25% greater than that of the as-synthesized film. The photocatalytic oxidation of water over the WO3 specimens showed that the methanol treatment suppresses interfacial recombination of photogenerated electrons in WO3. This study showed that the solar energy conversion efficiency for the methanol-treated WO3 film outperforms the as-synthesized WO3 film by ca. 32%.

 	Scheme 1  Processes of charge transport, back transfer, and chemical interaction in a photoelectrochemical cell for water cleavage. The n-type semiconducting photoanode is positively biased for generation of O2 gas, with corresponding H2 gas generation on the counter electrode. VCB, VVB, VFB, and EF represent the conduction-band, valence-band, flat-band, and Fermi-energy levels of the electrodes.

 	Fig. 1  
          XRD patterns of (a) the as-synthesized WO3 film, (b) the water-treated WO3 film, (c) the hexane-treated WO3 film, (d) the ethanol-treated WO3 film, and (e) the methanol-treated WO3 film. The standard diffraction pattern of monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS 83-0951) is shown at the bottom of this figure.	 

 	Fig. 2  
          SEM images for the top-view of the WO3 nanocrystalline films: (a) the as-synthesized WO3 film, (b) the hexane-treated WO3 film, (c) the ethanol-treated WO3 film, and (d) the methanol-treated WO3 film.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-synthesized, hexane-treated, ethanol-treated, and methanol-treated WO3 films; (b) plots of (αE)1/2 against the photon energy (E) for the WO3 films, where α is the absorbance.	 

 	Fig. 4  Photocurrent density versus applied voltage, for the WO3 nanocrystalline films with different post-treatments under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination: (a) the as-synthesized WO3 film, (b) the hexane-treated WO3 film, (c) the ethanol-treated WO3 film, and (d) the methanol-treated WO3 film. A Pt sheet was the counter electrode and the electrolyte was an aqueous HClO4 solution (1 M).

 	Fig. 7  The IMPS responses of the photoelectrochemical cells assembled with the as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 biased at 1.5 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). A blue light emitting diode (λ = 455 nm) was used as the modulation light source with a dc intensity of 15 mW cm−2 and superimposed 5% ac intensity. The frequency at the Im(J) minimum (fmin) is indicated in the figure.	 

 	Fig. 8  Time course of O2 gas evolution from a 0.01 M aqueous AgNO3 solution suspended with 50 mg of as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 photocatalyst powders under visible-light irradiation.	 
ηc (%) = [(energy converted to chemical reactions − energy supplied by external bias)/energy of incident light] × 100 = [Jp(ΔG°rev − Ebias)/J0] × 100

 	Fig. 9  Light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency (ηc) versus applied voltage, for the as-synthesized and methanol-treated WO3 nanocrystalline films under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination. A Pt sheet was the counter electrode and the electrolyte was an aqueous HClO4 solution (1 M).
