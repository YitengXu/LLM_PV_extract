    , Accepted 4th January 2021First published on 6th January 2021AbstractSide-chain engineering has been shown to be an important strategy to optimize Y-series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). Most previous reports were focusing on changing the branching positions and size of the alkyl side chains on Y6. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the orientation of side chains on the properties of NFAs and the performance of the organic solar cells (OSCs). Three isomeric NFAs named o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 are designed by changing the substitution positions and thus orientations of the side chains attached to the central core. Our studies show that the optimal side-chain orientation can be achieved by the meta-positioned hexylphenyl group (of the m-BTP-PhC6 molecule), which introduces significant beneficial effects on optical absorption, intermolecular packing and phase separation of the NFAs. By pairing a donor polymer PTQ10 with m-BTP-PhC6, device efficiencies of 17.7% can be achieved, which is among the best values for PTQ10-based nonfullerene OSC devices so far. These results reveal that regulating side-chain orientations of Y-series NFAs is a promising strategy to achieve favorable morphology, and high charge mobility and solar cell performances.

Broader context
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become one of the most important research topics in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), due to their highly tunable optoelectronic and morphological properties. Recently, the rapid development of Y-series NFAs has enabled a paradigm shift in the OSC field with the device efficiencies exceeding 17%. Among various chemical modifications on Y-series NFAs, side-chain engineering is a facile and versatile strategy to manipulate intermolecular packing, blend film morphology and processability of the materials. However, current side-chain engineering of Y-series NFAs mainly focuses on the variations of the length, shape or branching positions of the side chains, and there are few studies on the side-chain orientations. In this work, three isomeric NFAs named o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6 and p-BTP-PhC6, respectively, were designed with different side-chain orientations. It is found that appropriate side-chain orientations are beneficial for optical absorption, intermolecular packing, and phase separation of NFAs. Encouragingly, by pairing PTQ10 as the electron donor, PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.7%, which is among the best values for PTQ10-based devices reported to date. Our results open a new avenue for the side-chain engineering of Y-series NFAs by regulating side-chain orientations to achieve optimal morphology and high performance.

Introduction
Great strides have been made in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) towards practical applications of optoelectronic devices.1–7 OSCs not only rival many inorganic counterparts in terms of device performances but also offer numerous advantageous features such as light weight, solution processing, and potential in portable and flexible panels.8–21 During the past five years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have increased to beyond 17%, by virtue of the emergence of highly performing nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with high tunability in chemical structures, optoelectronic properties and molecular packing.22–29 So far, the state-of-the-art NFAs are the Y-series molecules featuring an A′–DAD–A′ structure that delivered 15.7% efficiency when combining with a wide-bandgap donor polymer named PBDB-TF in the original report.30–32 Subsequently, the research community encouraged by this result have achieved successive breakthroughs in harvesting the full potential of NFAs by fine-tuning of the molecular structure,33–39 matching with donor polymers,40–45 device engineering,46–59 and in-depth studies on molecular packing and fundamental aspects.60–65
Among various molecular design strategies of Y-series NFAs, the side-chain modification plays a vital role in controlling the nanoscale morphology of the active layers and thereby device performances.66–70 It can be found that the Y-series NFAs possess two sets of alkyl chains with the inner pair located on the pyrrole rings and the outer pair flanking at the β-positions of the thienothiophene moieties. Examples of side-chain engineering of Y-series NFAs began with the prolongation of the inner 2-ethylhexyl chains and the move of branching positions that led to improved film morphology and PCEs of ∼16.5%.71,72 An accompanying effect of these modifications is the enhanced solubility of the molecules, which enables device processing by non-halogenated solvent and printing-related techniques.71,73 Besides the inner side chains, more and more reports have demonstrated that the outer side chains may impose multiple effects on molecular conjugation, charge transport and electronic disorder, etc. By contrasting the acceptors with and without the outer side chains, So and Zou et al. discovered that these outer chains endowed the molecules with lowered Urbach energy and energy disorder.74 Zhan et al. also presented the replacement of alkyl chains with alkylphenyl groups to extend the conjugation and increase the intramolecular locking effects of the acceptors, which led to a comprehensive enhancement of the photovoltaic parameters.75 Hou et al. carefully examined the length of the outer side chains by the interplay between solubility and electron transport, yielding an outstanding PCE of 17.8%.76 These results have greatly advanced the development of nonfullerene OSCs, as it is undoubtedly intensive and delicate work to further improve the nearly optimum blend morphology of the Y-series NFAs. Nonetheless, current literatures focused on the alteration in the length, shape or branching positions of the outer side chains.77 As these various side chains are connected with sp2-hybridized atoms of the central DAD-cores, they mostly remain in the horizontal direction of the molecular backbone. Hence, it is interesting to explore if the side-chain orientations, specifically the extension direction of the chains relative to the molecular plane, can have impacts on intermolecular aggregation of the acceptors.
In this work, we study the effect of side-chain orientations on the properties and photovoltaic performances of Y-series NFAs. We designed and synthesized three isomeric NFAs,78–80 named o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6, as shown in Fig. 1. The main structural difference of the three isomers is the substitution positions (i.e., ortho-, meta-, and para-substitutions) of the hexyl chains on the phenyl rings that are connected to the β-positions of the thienothiophene units, which allows us to systematically study the effects of side-chain orientations. As a result, morphology analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that the molecular geometry of various side chains can significantly alter the molecular aggregation, thereby affecting their physicochemical properties and electron mobilities of three NFAs. Consequently, when pairing with a wide-bandgap donor polymer PTQ10, these NFAs delivered different photovoltaic parameters. While o-BTP-PhC6 yielded only a moderate PCE of 16.0% due to an undesirable side-chain orientation, both p-BTP-PhC6 and m-BTP-PhC6 presented PCEs exceeding 17% in binary devices. Importantly, m-BTP-PhC6 achieved an impressive PCE of 17.7%, due to the simultaneously increased short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) relative to those of p-BTP-PhC6. As far as we know, this result represents one of the highest values among PTQ10-based OSCs, which sheds light on a new strategy of side-chain engineering for Y-series NFAs.

Results and discussions
The detailed synthesis routes to o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 are depicted in Schemes S1–S3 in the ESI,† with similar procedures. The only structural difference among these NFAs lies in the substitution positions (i.e., ortho-, meta-, and para-substitutions) of the hexyl chains on the phenyl rings attached to the β-positions of the thienothiophene units. All the three NFAs exhibit good solubility in common processing solvents including chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF techniques were utilized to characterize the chemical structures of the intermediates and final products with regioisomerism. The thermal properties of the three small molecules were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S1 in ESI,†o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 exhibit decomposition temperature (Td) with 5% weight loss at 311, 322, and 352 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, respectively. These results indicate that good solubility and thermal stability of the three NFAs are suitable for the applications in OSCs.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of these isomeric NFAs were recorded in dilute chloroform solution with a concentration of ∼1 × 10−5 M and in film state, and the corresponding optical data are listed in Table 1. As displayed in Fig. 2a, o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 show similar absorption profiles ranging from of 300–780 nm with their maximum absorption peaks centered at 730, 728, and 728 nm, respectively. Together with their comparable extinction coefficients (εsolution), it can be seen that the alkyl-substituted positions do not have a significant impact on the electronic structure of the resulting molecules in solution. Whereas, when changing to the film state, the maximum absorption peaks show bathochromic shifts of 60, 78, and 77 nm for o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6, respectively (Fig. 2b). The obviously different bathochromic shifts of these films suggest that the side-chain orientations may have some influence on the molecular packing in these NFAs. The relative intensity of the shoulder peaks (at around 662 and 718 nm) also indicates the different extents of intermolecular aggregation for these NFAs. Besides, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 calculated from their absorption onsets are 1.39, 1.35, and 1.36 eV, respectively. Since the absorption of polymer donor PTQ10 is mainly located in the range of 450–620 nm,81 the complementary absorption of PTQ10 and three NFAs can provide wide and efficient absorption to construct OSCs, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PTQ10 and the three NFAs were estimated via electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. The energy diagram is presented in Fig. 2c, and the oxidation/reduction curves of the corresponding films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The EHOMO/ELUMO values of PTQ10, o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 are calculated to be −5.53/−2.81, −5.53/−3.76, −5.59/−3.86, and −5.59/−3.85 eV, respectively. The changing tendency of the electrochemical bandgap (ECVg) for o-BTP-PhC6 is in accordance with its blue-shifted absorption in comparison with those of m-BTP-PhC6 and p-BTP-PhC6. In addition, the higher LUMO level of o-BTP-PhC6 would be favorable for achieving a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in OSC devices. Therefore, these results show that alkyl chain substitutions on different positions of three isomers have a significant effect on their electrochemical properties.
A series of OSCs with the conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTQ10:NFA/PNDIT-F3N (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide])/Ag were fabricated to systematically assess the photovoltaic performance of o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6, where PNDIT-F3N was used to facilitate the electron extraction by alleviating the interfacial energy barriers,82 and the detailed device parameters are recorded in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). The PTQ10:NFA blends were spin-casted from the chloroform solution with an optimized weight ratio (1:1.2), a total concentration of ∼20 mg mL−1 and thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSC devices are depicted in Fig. 2d, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 2. Despite the highest VOC of 0.924 V that matches well with the ELUMO values, PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6 only presents a relative low JSC of 22.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.2%, which leads to a moderate PCE of 16.0%. In terms of PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6, a PCE of 17.1% is realized along with a VOC of 0.888 V, a JSC of 24.7 mA cm−2, and an FF of 77.9%, which is higher than the efficiency reported in our previous work obtained by PM6:p-BTP-PhC6.75 Impressively, PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 realizes the highest JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2 and FF of 79.3% among the three PTQ10-based devices, resulting in an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. Fig. S4 (ESI†) illustrates a histogram of efficiencies of 20 independent OSC devices for each blend. Obviously, the mean values of PCEs are progressively enhanced in the sequence of o-BTP-PhC6 (15.6%), p-BTP-PhC6 (16.7%), and m-BTP-PhC6 (17.3%). To the best of our knowledge, the superior PCEs of the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 and PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6 devices are among the highest values reported for PTQ10-based OSCs (Fig. 2e). The improved JSC as well as FF are the main reasons for their high performances, and the mechanisms behind this are of great interest and significance as the only difference among these isomeric NFAs are their side-chain orientations.

Fig. 2f compares the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three devices with o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 as acceptors, respectively. Both devices based on m-BTP-PhC6 and p-BTP-PhC6 exhibit EQEs of over 75% in the range of 490–820 nm. And PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 shows a slightly higher response in the range of 350–900 nm with the maximum EQE of 83.3%. As a result, the integrated JSC of PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 is higher than that of PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6 (24.83 vs. 24.21 mA cm−2). Conversely, PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6 shows not only a narrow range of EQE due to the blue-shifted absorption, but also the lowest photon response with the highest EQE value of 78% that leads to an inferior integrated JSC of 22.04 mA cm−2. It has been demonstrated that a long exciton lifetime is one of the prerequisites for efficient charge generation in low-energy-offset OSC devices.83 Therefore, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments were performed to probe the singlet exciton lifetime of the three NFAs. From Fig. S5 (ESI†), it is obvious that the pristine m-BTP-PhC6 film presents the longest singlet exciton lifetime, which should be one of the reasons for the highest EQE values of the m-BTP-PhC6 device. Similar phenomena can also be observed through femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fsTA), where the kinetics of ground state bleaching (GSB, Fig. S6, ESI†) is the slowest for the pristine m-BTP-PhC6 film. Furthermore, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were conducted (Fig. S7, ESI†), in which the donor and acceptor components were excited independently by the lasers with the wavelengths of 514 nm and 785 nm, respectively. The values of PL quenching excited at 514/785 nm are calculated to be 95.9/72.1%, 98.5/92.6%, and 98.3/89.2% for o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6, respectively. It is clear that PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 exhibits the most efficient hole and electron transfer while PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6 shows the worst, which is consistent with their different EQE response and JSC in the corresponding devices.
To unravel the reasons why the side-chain orientations can affect the FF values of the NFAs, we first probed the thin-film morphology of the pristine NFAs by the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) techniques.84 The two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns (Fig. 3a–c) present all the (010) peaks of the three NFAs in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicative of the preferentially face-on orientations relative to the substrate. The π–π stacking distance (dπ–π) extracted from the corresponding one-dimensional profiles (Fig. 3d) are 3.57, 3.45, and 3.55 Å for o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6, respectively. m-BTP-PhC6 shows not only the shortest dπ–π but also the largest crystal coherence length (CCL) of 2.8 nm compared to o-BTP-PhC6 (1.5 nm) and p-BTP-PhC6 (1.7 nm). In addition, from the in-plane (IP) direction, we can observe two lamellar stacking peaks at 0.27/0.40 Å−1 for m-BTP-PhC6 (d-spacing: 23.3/15.7 Å) and 0.29/0.42 Å−1 (d-spacing: 21.7/15.0 Å) for p-BTP-PhC6. By comparing the literature with detailed analysis of the single crystal and GIWAXS of Y6, these two lamellar peaks correspond to two different stacking patterns along the crystal axes that collectively form the two-dimensional network in the IP direction (instead of the linear polymer-like of ITIC-series NFAs).62,64,85 In contrast, only one lamellar peak at 0.45 Å−1 for o-BTP-PhC6 (d-spacing: 14.0 Å) can be found, which implies that the molecular packing of o-BTP-PhC6 may be different from those of Y6 and m-BTP-PhC6/p-BTP-PhC6. Accordingly, the disrupted molecular packing causes the blue-shifted absorption of o-BTP-PhC6 as mentioned before.

(d) Corresponding 1D scattering profiles of pristine films along the in-plane (in dashed) and out-of-plane (in solid) directions. (e) DFT calculations of the optimized molecular geometry at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the three NFAs (hydrogen atoms are hidden for clarity). The 2-ethylhexyl chains attached to the pyrrole rings were replaced by 2-methylpropyl to accelerate the calculations. 
It can be envisaged that the intermolecular packing of these molecules should be greatly altered by various side-chain orientations. Fig. 3e shows the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of the optimized molecular geometry. From the side view, the hexyl chains of o-BTP-PhC6 point towards the vertical direction relative the molecular plane, which is in sharp contrast to those of p-BTP-PhC6 mostly sitting in the horizontal direction, and those of m-BTP-PhC6 adopting an in-between or “tilted” orientations. As for o-BTP-PhC6, it is speculated that the vertical orientation of the side chains can push away the neighbouring molecules, hampering the essential π–core stacking as evidenced by the missing lamellar peak.25 Regarding the other two NFAs, m-BTP-PhC6 exhibits overall stronger intermolecular packing than p-BTP-PhC6, despite the larger dihedral angles in its molecular geometry. It should be noted that the shorter dπ–π of m-BTP-PhC6 may not be simply reduced to the steric hindrance from side chains. Although this interesting phenomenon should be investigated in the future by more precise methods such as single crystal or molecular-dynamics simulations, previous reports on ITIC-series NFAs also exemplify that the molecules with meta-positioned alkyl chains shows much stronger aggregation tendency than the isomers with para-positioned ones.9 This is further supported by the electron mobility (μe) measurements by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC, Table S5 and Fig. S8, ESI†) method, where the μe for o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 are 3.33 × 10−4, 6.41 × 10−4, and 5.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Hence, these results strongly indicate that the side-chain orientations indeed have great impacts on the molecular packing properties and charge transport network of Y-series NFAs.
Furthermore, we wondered if these side-chain effects can be preserved in the nanostructure of the blend films and explain the differential device performance among these NFAs. The two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns of the pristine PTQ10 and the blend films are shown in Fig. 4a–d, and the corresponding one-dimensional profiles in the IP and OOP directions are plotted in Fig. 4e. It is discovered that blending NFAs with PTQ10 does not change the predominant face-on orientation for both donor and acceptor components. As tabulated in Table S6 (ESI†), the CCL values of the lamellar and π–π stacking are estimated by Scherrer equation to be 6.9 and 2.2 nm, 7.7 and 2.9 nm, and 8.0 and 2.7 nm for PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6, PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6, and PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6, respectively. Since the PTQ10 diffraction signals are quite close to the blend films in the OOP direction, it is hard to precisely distinguish the contribution from donor or acceptor to the π–π stacking scattering in blend films. However, the π–π stacking scattering of the thin film containing m-BTP-PhC6 is found to be higher and shaper than those of other blend films, which indicates higher crystallinity and thicker crystals and accords with the information of the pristine films in the OOP direction. As the donor content in the thin films are the same, we can speculate that the higher crystallinity found here is from the acceptor m-BTP-PhC6. Again, the o-BTP-PhC6-based film shows the weakest crystallization propensity relative to the other two material combinations, which is also supported by the SCLC mobility measurement of the blend film. As shown in Fig. 4f and Fig. S9 (ESI†), the blend films based on o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 exhibit hole/electron mobilities of 1.28 × 10−4/2.96 × 10−4, 2.89 × 10−4/4.31 × 10−4, and 1.99 × 10−4/3.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The GIWAXS and mobility results indicate that the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 blend film possesses the strongest π–π stacking and thus the highest charge mobility, which coincides the high JSC and FF achieved in the devices.

(f) Hole and electron mobilities of the OSCs based on PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6, PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6, and PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6. 
Apart from molecular packing, we characterized the nanoscale phase separation of the blend films by employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to verify the effects of the side-chain orientations. As displayed in Fig. 5a–f, all the three blend films show uniform surfaces without the formation of undesirably large aggregates and relatively small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness are found to be approximately 1.0–1.2 nm, which is conducive to the efficient charge dissociation and collection. It should be noted that the PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6 blend seems to have larger phase separation from the AFM images. To confirm this, TEM images were captured for these blends, where PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6 (Fig. 5g) indeed shows increased phase separation compared to PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 and PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6 (Fig. 5h and i). These results suggest that the large phase separation of PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6 reduces the interfacial area between donor and acceptor, which may cause inefficient charge dissociation. On the contrary, the suitable phase separation of PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 and PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6 provides more donor–acceptor interface for efficient charge dissociation to yield better JSC and FF in the related devices.

To gain insight into the exciton dissociation and charge collection process, the plots of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the three optimized devices were studied (Fig. 6a and Table S7, ESI†). At a high Veff of 2 V, all the devices reach their saturated photocurrent density (Jsat), suggesting that all the excitons are split and the resulting free charges are collected without recombination. It can be observed that the m-BTP-PhC6 and p-BTP-PhC6-based devices reached their Jsat at the relatively low Veff compared to the o-BTP-PhC6 one. Theoretically, the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be estimated according to the formula of η = Jph/Jsat under the short circuit and maximum power point (MPP) conditions, respectively. PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 shows the highest ηdiss and ηcoll values (98.8% and 91.0%) compared with those of PTQ10:o-BTP-PhC6-based (95.8% and 87.0%) and PTQ10:p-BTP-PhC6-based devices (97.2% and 88.2%). These experiments demonstrate the trends in charge collection and exciton dissociation efficiencies are in accordance with those in JSC and FF of the OSC devices and the TEM observations of their blend films.

Furthermore, by varying the light intensity (Plight) illuminated on the devices, we attempted to build up correlations between Plight and photovoltaic parameters (VOC and JSC) to investigate the charge recombination mechanisms. The plots of VOCversus Plight in semi-logarithm coordinates are illustrated in Fig. 6b. A stronger dependence of VOC and lnPlight with the slope >kT/q is considered to have more trap-assisted recombination, where k, T, and q denote Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and elementary charge, respectively.86 The calculated slopes for the o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6-based devices are 1.18 kT/q, 1.08 kT/q, and 1.09 kT/q, respectively. This implies that the major charge recombination for these three systems should be bimolecular recombination, with the o-BTP-PhC6-based device having more severe trap-assisted recombination. In addition, when the bimolecular recombination of the relevant device is negligible, the exponential factor α will approach unity in the formula of JSC ∝ Pαlight.87 As shown in Fig. 6c, the α values obtained from the slopes of the fitting lines are 0.872, 0.931, and 0.919 for the devices based on o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6, respectively. The highest α value of the m-BTP-PhC6-based device indicates effectively suppressed bimolecular recombination, which accounts for its highest FF of >79%.
Conclusions
In summary, three isomeric NFAs named o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6, and p-BTP-PhC6 were rationally designed and synthesized by changing the side-chain substitution positions on the phenyl rings attached on the central core, and the impacts of the side-chain orientations on their optoelectronic and molecular aggregation properties were investigated. Relative to o-BTP-PhC6 with the vertical orientation and p-BTP-PhC6 with the horizontal orientation, the hexyl chains of m-BTP-PhC6 show a “tilted” orientation. Because of this unique orientation, m-BTP-PhC6 exhibits the most ordered intermolecular packing among three isomers, resulting in the enhanced electron mobility. When blended with PTQ10, the PCE of the m-BTP-PhC6-based devices reached 17.7% with a VOC of 0.883 V, JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.3%, which is superior to those of the o-BTP-PhC6 (16.0%) and the p-BTP-PhC6-based ones (17.1%). Up to now, the PCE of 17.7% is among the highest efficiencies for the PTQ10-based OSCs reported in the literature. The suitable phase separation and enhanced molecular packing of PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 can effectively suppress the charge recombination and improve the charge transport, which is beneficial for the JSC and FF of the devices. All these results demonstrate that fine-tuning the side-chain orientations plays a crucial role in altering the intermolecular aggregation properties of Y-series NFAs. Our work highlights the significance of the side-chain orientations as well as provides an alternative to the design of high-performance NFAs.

Broader context
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become one of the most important research topics in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), due to their highly tunable optoelectronic and morphological properties. Recently, the rapid development of Y-series NFAs has enabled a paradigm shift in the OSC field with the device efficiencies exceeding 17%. Among various chemical modifications on Y-series NFAs, side-chain engineering is a facile and versatile strategy to manipulate intermolecular packing, blend film morphology and processability of the materials. However, current side-chain engineering of Y-series NFAs mainly focuses on the variations of the length, shape or branching positions of the side chains, and there are few studies on the side-chain orientations. In this work, three isomeric NFAs named o-BTP-PhC6, m-BTP-PhC6 and p-BTP-PhC6, respectively, were designed with different side-chain orientations. It is found that appropriate side-chain orientations are beneficial for optical absorption, intermolecular packing, and phase separation of NFAs. Encouragingly, by pairing PTQ10 as the electron donor, PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.7%, which is among the best values for PTQ10-based devices reported to date. Our results open a new avenue for the side-chain engineering of Y-series NFAs by regulating side-chain orientations to achieve optimal morphology and high performance.
