, Accepted 10th July 2023First published on 11th July 2023AbstractSnO2 is increasingly favored as an electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells due to its intrinsic advantages, but SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces exhibit considerable interfacial states causing severe recombination losses.

This study proposes that treating the SnO2 surface with soluble MgCl2 before depositing perovskites, combined with junction heat-treating, is expected to self-selectively heal the diversely charged defect states at the SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces, and the self-selective passivation strategy realized by the incorporation of binary ionic compounds is an alternative way to improve the diversely charged heterointerfaces of semiconductor devices.
1. Introduction
SnO2 is increasingly favored as an electron transport layer (ETL) for planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its better band alignment with perovskites, higher electron mobility, and simpler preparation in comparison with traditional TiO2.1–6 By modulating the SnO2 ETL, several groups have achieved certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25%.7–10 Even so, there is still ample room for approaching the theoretical limit of 33% predicted using the Shockley–Queisser model.11,12 Extensive experiments show that severe carrier nonradiative recombinations take place at the ETL/perovskite interface,5,7,13–17 implying the presence of substantial interfacial states deep within the band gap. Therefore, effectively passivating the SnO2/perovskite interface is expected to further narrow the gap between practical and theoretical efficiencies.
Numerous experimental strategies have been developed to minimize recombination losses at the SnO2/perovskite heterointerface. Surface modification of the SnO2 ETL with inorganic metal oxides, such as TiO2, MgO and ZnO, is commonly employed to improve the film quality and modulate the band energy offsets between the ETL and the perovskite.18–23 However, the introduced extra interfaces are likely to result in additional recombination paths and contact resistances. For instance, the SnO2–TiO2 composite layer can facilitate electron extraction and prevent electron backflow by creating a cascade energy level sequence among the perovskite, TiO2 and SnO2 layers.19 Nevertheless, the subsequently introduced TiO2/perovskite interface still harbors detrimental deep-level states that require further elimination.17,24–27 A recent breakthrough involves the successful design of a coherent interlayer with a crystalline FASnClx phase (FA, formamidinium) between the SnO2 ETL and perovskite layers, which effectively minimizes the interface defect densities and contact resistances, yielding an impressive certified efficiency of 25.5%.7 However, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the FASnClx coherent interlayer is considerably higher than that of the lead iodide perovskite, which results in an increased electron transport barrier. Another strategy to suppress recombination losses is to use a self-assembling monolayer of organic and carbon-based materials to saturate the dangling bonds on the SnO2 and perovskite surfaces via diverse linkages and tune the work function of the perovskite surface, favoring electron extraction at the SnO2/perovskite interface.27–33 Unfortunately, the self-assembling molecules held together by van der Waals interactions may dissolve in long-term operation, and their high cost also limits their commercial viability. Inorganic elemental doping in the SnO2 ETL with aliovalent metal cations, such as K+, Mg2+, Al3+ and Nb5+, is an inexpensive and straightforward approach to improve the properties of the SnO2/perovskite interface.34–41 In particular, multiple-element passivation with K+ and Cl− delivers a remarkable decrease in interfacial trap density by incorporating inorganic binary KCl at the interface, obtaining a PCE of 20.5% with good stability.16 Despite some progress made by using the doped SnO2 ETL, the PCEs of the solar cells with these layers still lag far behind those of champion devices.42 To date, a trial-and-error passivation approach is usually used in experiments, and the defect types and passivation mechanism of the SnO2/perovskite interfaces require an in-depth understanding,43 which would be critical to guide the passivation scheme to improve SnO2/perovskite heterointerfaces.
In this work, aiming to explore the causes and passivation schemes of the interfacial states at the SnO2/perovskite interfaces, we investigate the SnO2/CsPbI3 heterojunction in terms of atomic structures, interfacial states, passivation strategy and carrier lifetimes using first-principles calculations combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. First-principles calculations indicate that the negatively charged SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI and positively charged SnO2–O(O′)/CsPbI3–PbI heterointerfaces (SnO2–O and SnO2–O′ are the Tasker's type-II and type-III surfaces,44,45 respectively, and the species following the hyphen represent the surface termination of the preceding compound) are most energetically favorable under O-poor, O-moderate and O-rich conditions, respectively, with deep-level states originating from different interfacial atoms. By screening a series of cation and anion dopants, we discover that Mg cations and Cl anions can selectively passivate the SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI and SnO2–O(O′)/CsPbI3–PbI heterointerfaces by effectively forming 3MgSn, Cli and ClO defects, respectively, without introducing detrimental interfacial dipole moments. NAMD simulations confirm that Mg and Cl doping in these three heterointerfaces improve the electron and hole lifetimes compatibly. Therefore, treating the SnO2 surface with MgCl2 before depositing perovskites has the potential to self-selectively passivate the SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces.
2. Computational methods
The density functional theory, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), is utilized for first-principles calculations.46,47 The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is employed for atomic relaxation,48 with a force tolerance less than 0.02 eV Å−1 and an electronic convergence less than 1 × 10−4 eV in all simulations. The energy cutoff is 420 eV, and the k points are sampled with a Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 1 mesh for integration in the Brillouin zone.49 The valence electron configurations of elements for SnO2 and CsPbI3 are Sn: 4d10 5s2 5p2, O: 5s2 5p4, Cs: 5s2 5p6 6s1, Pb: 6s2 6p2 and I: 5s2 5p5. Taking into account the severe underestimation of the SnO2 band gap by the PAW method with the PBE functional, the Hubbard U = 4.0 eV is included for the Sn-4d electrons, which is carefully tested to strike a balance between the band gap and structural parameters.50 Meanwhile, since the errors in the band gap of lead iodide perovskite induced by generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) and non-spin-orbital coupling (non-SOC) cancel each other out in occurrence, the U parameter is not considered for the Pb-5d orbital in our calculations, giving the band gap of CsPbI3 close to experimental measurement.51,52 To check the quantum confinement effects,53,54 the slab structures used in our simulations are well examined. The results show that the band gaps in the SnO2 (1 1 0) slab with 4-layers of Sn atoms and CsPbI3 (1 0 0) slab with 4-layers of Cs atoms are just about 0.10 eV higher than those in bulk, which do not have much impact on electronic structures. The structural information of the stable SnO2/perovskite heterointerfaces has been enclosed at the end of the ESI.† The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is performed with a single Γ-point in a 1 × 1 × 1 k-point mesh. Starting from the fully relaxed atomic structure, the velocity rescaling method is used to bring the temperature of the system up to 300 K in the canonical ensemble. Then, the atomic trajectory is generated by AIMD for 3–5 ps in the microcanonical ensemble, with a time step of 0.5 fs. The Kohn–Sham orbitals of the generated atomic trajectories are used to calculate the nonadiabatic coupling. Subsequently, NAMD is carried out to simulate the carrier transition process between certain initial and final states by using the Hefei-NAMD software based on averaging 100 different AIMD atomic trajectories.55
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The stable SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces
The rational construction model of heterointerfaces is crucial for understanding the source of interfacial states and exploring passivation schemes. Usually, experiments show that lead iodide perovskites tend to grow along the (1 0 0) plane,56,57 and the polycrystalline structure of SnO2 is dominated by the (1 1 0) plane.3,58 Upon examination, it is found that the (1 0 0) plane of CsPbI3 characterized by an a vector [0 1 0] and a b vector [0 0 1], interfacing with the (1 1 0) plane of SnO2 characterized by a 2u vector [0 0 1] and a v vector [1−1 0] can form a commensurable SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerface with lattice mismatches less than 4%. Given that SnO2 has SnO-, O- and O′-terminated (1 1 0) surfaces (SnO2–O and SnO2–O′ are the Tasker's type-II and type-III surfaces,44,45 respectively, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI†) and CsPbI3 has CsI- and PbI-terminated (1 0 0) surfaces, six distinct heterointerfaces, namely SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–O/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–O′/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–PbI, SnO2–O/CsPbI3–PbI and SnO2–O′/CsPbI3–PbI, can be constructed as illustrated in Fig. 1a–c and S2a–c.† The lattice constants of the resulting supercell are a = 6.43 Å, b = 6.58 Å and c = 72.00 Å with a vacuum layer over 20 Å separating the slabs. As shown in Fig. 1a–c, the SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI and SnO2–O(O′)/CsPbI3–PbI heterojunction models contain 6 and 5 Sn-related atomic layers of SnO2 and 8 and 9 I-related atomic layers of CsPbI3, respectively, which will be proven to have the lowest interface formation energy among the six configurations under different O chemical potential conditions. The exposed O-terminal at the SnO2 surface is passivated with pseudohydrogens to mimic the bulk properties. The ultimate atomic configurations of the heterojunctions are determined by testing various intercrystal distances while considering the in-plane degree of freedom. During this process, the 3 Sn-related layers of SnO2 and 4 I-related layers of CsPbI3 at both ends of the slab models are fixed, while the remaining portions are relaxed. All atomic structures of the SnO2/CsPbI3 heterojunctions with interfacial defects discussed later are relaxed in identical fixed and relaxed ways.

(1)where EA/B (interface) is the total energy of the A/B heterojunction with or without external ion doping. EA (surface) and EB (surface) are the surface energies of grains A and B with surfaces exposed at both ends of the slab model. EA and EB are the total energies of A and B in primitive cells, respectively. m and n are the multiples of the A and B primitive cells in the model of the A/B heterojunction. Ni is the difference in the number of elements i between the A/B heterojunction and m (n) times A (B) primitive cells. μi is the chemical potential of atom i relative to that in its pure elemental phase μ0i. S is the area of the heterointerface. The surface energy and chemical potential calculation details are shown in parts I and II of the ESI.† The calculations of interface formation energy based on eqn (1) indicate that among the six configurations, the SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–O/CsPbI3–PbI and SnO2–O′/CsPbI3–PbI heterointerfaces exhibit the lowest formation energies under the O-poor (μO is close to −2.48 eV), O-moderate and O-rich (μO is close to 0 eV) conditions, respectively, within the allowed O elemental chemical potential range, as shown in Fig. 1d. For simplicity, the obtained three energetically favorable configurations are represented as prototype-I, prototype-II and prototype-III for the SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–O/CsPbI3–PbI and SnO2–O′/CsPbI3–PbI heterointerfaces, respectively, in the following discussions.
3.2. Electronic structures of the stable heterointerfaces
Under the relatively O-poor conditions, the energetically favorable prototype-I heterojunction leads to a deep level at the interface (the upper panel of Fig. 2a), which is fully occupied by electrons, indicating a negatively charged interface. The orbital weighted band structure and partial charge density reveal that this defect level mainly originates from the Sn-5s and Sn-5p orbitals at the interface (Fig. 2a). Therefore, we attempt to passivate the interface by p-type doping, employing metal aliovalent cations of Mg, Zn, Cd, Al and Ga to form substitutional defects for the Sn ions. The analysis of the electronic structures shows that the formed 3MgSn, 3ZnSn and 3CdSn defects at the interface can successfully eliminate the deep-level states within the band gap, as displayed in Fig. 2d, S4a and b,† respectively, while the 4AlSn and 4GaSn defects fail to heal the deep-levels and cause a decrease in band gap due to the large conduction band dispersion, as shown in Fig. S4c and d.† Given the toxicity of Cd and the inferior defect formation ability and carrier lifetime of the 3ZnSn system that will be discussed below, we focus on the impact of Mg doping on the SnO2/CsPbI3 interfacial properties.

(g) For prototype-II heterojunction with Cli defects at the interface. (h) For prototype-III heterojunction.

The green circles represent the orbital contributions of the interfacial (a) Sn-5s, Sn-5p, O-2p and I-5p; (b)–(e) Sn-5s, Sn-5p, Mg-3s, O-2p and I-5p; (f) Sn-5s, Pb-6p, O-2p and I-5p; (g) and (i) Pb-6p, O-2p, I-5p and Cl-3p; (h) Pb-6p, O-2p and I-5p; (j) Pb-6p, O-2p, I-5p and N-2p. The red dashed lines indicate the energy positions of the highest occupied states. 
The lower panel of Fig. 2a highlights the four sites of the interfacial Sn atoms that significantly contribute to the deep-level states at the prototype-I interface. Although substituting the Sn atoms with Mg atoms to form the MgSn and 2MgSn defects has a certain effect on reducing the interfacial state caused by the Sn-5p orbitals (Fig. 2b and c), the deep-level states caused by the remaining Sn atoms could not be effectively eliminated until the formation of the 3MgSn and 4MgSn defects at the interface (Fig. 2d and e). We arrive at the same conclusion after examining the other possible sites of the MgSn, 2MgSn and 3MgSn defects. Notably, for 3MgSn and 4MgSn systems, the interfacial states are shallow levels situated near the valence band maximum (VBM), originating from the dangling bonds of the unsaturated O atoms.
Under the O-moderate conditions, the stable prototype-II heterointerface exhibits three defect levels highlighted as D-1, D-2 and D-3 in the band gap (the upper panel of Fig. 2f). The D-1 deep-level mainly originating from the interfacial Sn-5s/Pb-6p wrong bonds is unoccupied, indicating a positively charged character of the interface. The D-2 and D-3 defect levels are occupied and become relatively shallow near the VBM, mainly stemming from the dangling bonds of the I and O atoms at the interface, as illustrated in Fig. S5b.† The anion Cl is introduced between the Pb and Sn sites to break the Pb–Sn wrong bond, and the resulting Cli defect effectively eliminates the deep-level states (Fig. 2g). Considering Mg-incorporation for passivating the prototype-I interface, Mgi is introduced at the interface and presents no passivation effect (Fig. S4e†).
Similarly, under the relatively O-rich conditions, the stable prototype-III heterointerface also produces three defect levels labeled as D-1, D-2 and D-3 within the band gap (the upper panel of Fig. 2h). The unoccupied D-1 deep-level comes from the anti-bonding orbital of O-2p/I-5p, while the shallow D-2 and D-3 defect levels mainly stem from the other I and O atoms at the interface, as illustrated in Fig. S5d.† Given the positively charged character of the interface and the O-2p orbital contribution of the deep state, we attempt to passivate it by forming a ClO substitutional donor defect. Alternatively, substituting O with N is expected to push the D-1 state higher into the conduction band, since the N-2p orbital has a closer energy level to I-5p than the O-2p orbital. The study of the electron structure shows that the ClO and NO defects completely eliminate the deep-levels at the interface, leaving shallow levels near the CBM introduced by the other I atoms at the interface, which do not couple with the incorporated Cl and N atoms, as displayed in Fig. 2i and j.
3.3. Phase diagram and defect formation energies
The defect formation energy of the interface determined using eqn (1) is an indicator that directly reflects the effectiveness of external element doping. Fig. 3a and b illustrate the maximum allowed chemical potentials of dopants in the SnO2 phase diagram (see part II of the ESI† for the calculation details), limited by the secondary phases of Mg2SnO4 and ZnO for considering the Zn and Mg cation doping, respectively and SnCl2, SnCl3 and Sn(NO3)4 for considering the Cl and N anion doping, respectively. From Fig. 3c, it is seen that among the Zn and Mg cation substitutional defects for passivating the prototype-I interface, the 3MgSn defects exhibit the lowest formation energy under the allowed O chemical potential conditions. Meanwhile, the formation energy of the ClO defect caused by Cl anion incorporation is much higher than that of the 3MgSn defects at the prototype-I interface under the O-rich conditions, as shown in Fig. 3c. From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that the anion Cli defect passivating the prototype-II interface exhibits low formation energy in the majority of the O chemical potential regions, while the cation Mgi defect that has no passivation effect shows a higher formation energy under the relatively O-rich conditions. On the other hand, the ClO defect passivating the prototype-III interface has lower formation energies throughout the O chemical potential range than the NO defect, suggesting the more passivation effectivity of Cl doping than N doping. Considering the cation Mg incorporation, the formation of 3MgSn defects is checked and shows a significantly higher formation energy compared to the ClO defect across the entire O chemical potential range, as depicted in Fig. 3d. Therefore, treating the SnO2 surface with soluble MgCl2 is expected to self-selectively passivate the diversely charged SnO2/perovskite interfaces by effectively forming 3MgSn, Cli and ClO defects under the relatively O-rich conditions at the prototype-I, prototype-II and prototype-III interfaces, respectively.

The solid and dashed lines represent the relatively low and high formation energies of defects, respectively. 
3.4. The changes in the interfacial dipole moments
Aliovalent ion doping at the interface will inevitably lead to a change in the interfacial dipole moment, which can either aid or hamper carrier extraction. For the prototype-I heterointerface, the 3MgSn defects not only exhibit excellent passivation effects and low formation energy but also induce the most negative change in the interfacial dipole moment among different numbers of xMgSn (x = 1, 2, 3 and 4) defects (the left panel of Fig. 4). The direction of the dipole moment change induced by the 3MgSn defects is from the perovskite absorber to the SnO2 transport layer, facilitating the extraction of photogenerated electrons. The negative changes in interfacial dipole moment result from the p-type doping of Mg substituting for Sn which produces a positive charge center on the SnO2 side. For the prototype-II heterointerface, the Cli defect healing the Pb–Sn wrong bond also results in a negative change in the interfacial dipole moment. For the prototype-III heterointerface, the ClO and NO defects induce positive and negative changes in the interfacial dipole moment, respectively, with a significantly small magnitude (the right panel of Fig. 4). Although the negative dipole moment change induced by the NO defect slightly favors electron extraction, the high formation energy of the NO defect suggests that N is an unsuitable dopant. In comparison, the adverse impact on the interfacial dipole moment of the ClO defect is also negligible. Besides, the low formation energy and favorable passivation effect of the ClO defect at the prototype-III heterointerface make Cl a promising dopant.
 Fig. 4  The dipole moment changes induced by different numbers of MgSn defects at the prototype-I heterointerface, the Cli defect at the prototype-II heterointerface (left pattern) and the ClO and NO defects at the prototype-III heterointerface (right pattern), which are obtained by subtracting the interfacial dipole moment of the undoped system from that of the doped system. The differential charge densities are derived from the difference between the charge densities of the doped and the undoped systems. The isosurface of differential charge density is 0.07e bohr−3. The differential charge density integrated from the x − y plane along the z-axis is presented in arbitrary units. The sizes and directions of the arrows represent the changes in the interfacial dipole moments. 
3.5. Carrier trapping dynamics
The position of the energy level created by interfaces can be revealed by the electronic structure analysis, where the deep-level within the band gap is commonly regarded as the carrier nonradiative recombination center.61 However, the effectiveness of such a center, which may be produced by a defect or an interface, depends significantly on the wave function overlap (〈ϕi|∇R|ϕj〉) between the band edge state ϕi and the defect state ϕj. NAMD, as an ab initio time-domain simulation, can offer insights into carrier trapping dynamics between energy states by taking into account electron–phonon coupling.62,63 In this study, we employ the Hefei-NAMD software55 to investigate the carrier lifetimes at the prototype-I, prototype-II and prototype-III heterointerfaces and the cases where they are passivated. In the simulations for the pristine heterointerfaces, the electrons are initially placed at the CBM, while the holes are positioned at the highest occupied VB contributed by SnO2 and CsPbI3 bulk, aiming to simulate their transition process from the initial carrier position to the deep-level state within the band gap. On the other hand, for the passivated heterointerfaces, the band edge transition of electrons and holes is investigated. The carrier trapping paths and time-dependent evolutions of the energy states are indicated in part IV of the ESI.† Due to the inaccurately tuned SnO2 band gap in these simulations, the obtained carrier lifetimes are not comparable to experimental values. Fig. 5a shows that at the prototype-I heterointerface, holes exhibit a lifetime of 2.81 ps, whereas electrons are quickly trapped within a short lifetime of 0.31 ps, indicating the accelerated recombination caused by interfacial states. As the 3ZnSn and 3MgSn defects form at the interface, the electron trapping is significantly delayed by eliminating the Sn-related deep-level states, showing extended lifetimes of 2.22 ps and 3.47 ps (Fig. 5a). The hole lifetime is reduced from 2.81 ps to 1.76 ps by the 3ZnSn defects while being comparatively less influenced by the 3MgSn defects (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, both the interstitial Cli defect at the prototype-II and substitution of Cl for O forming a ClO defect at the prototype-III heterointerface significantly improve the electron and hole lifetimes at different degrees, as shown in Fig. 5b. Therefore, the 3MgSn, Cli and ClO defects at the prototype-I, prototype-II and prototype-III heterointerfaces, respectively, not only successfully eliminate the interfacial states within the band gap and have relatively low formation energies, but also result in long electron and hole lifetimes, evidencing the passivation effects of MgCl2 for the diversely charged SnO2/perovskite interfaces.

The time scales are fitted to the exponential function to match the data of population P(t) = exp(−t/τ) and P(t) = 1 − exp(−t/τ) for electrons and holes, respectively, where τ is the carrier lifetime. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, the SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–O/CsPbI3–PbI and SnO2–O′O′/CsPbI3–PbI heterointerfaces are found to be energetically favorable under O-poor, O-moderate and O-rich conditions, respectively, and exhibit detrimental deep-level states originating from different interfacial atoms. We find that the 3MgSn defects at the negatively charged prototype-I heterointerface and the Cli and ClO defects at the positively charged prototype-II and prototype-III heterointerfaces, respectively, can selectively eliminate the deep-levels under the O-rich conditions. Furthermore, the changes in the dipole moment induced by Mg doping at the prototype-I heterointerface and Cl doping at the prototype-II heterointerface are beneficial for electron extraction. The NAMD simulations further confirm the favorable passivation effects of the 3MgSn, Cli and ClO defects for the prototype-I, prototype-II and prototype-III heterointerfaces respectively, as evidenced by the improved carrier lifetimes. This study suggests that treating the SnO2 surface with MgCl2 before perovskite deposition, followed by a heat treatment of the interface, is expected to self-selectively passivate the diversely charged SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces, and the understanding of the passivation mechanism offers insight into how to effectively passivate heterointerfaces in semiconductor devices using soluble binary ionic compounds.

 	Fig. 1  Relaxed atomic structures and interface formation energies of SnO2/CsPbI3 heterojunctions. (a)–(c) The atomic structures of SnO2–SnO/CsPbI3–CsI, SnO2–O/CsPbI3–PbI and SnO2–O′/CsPbI3–PbI heterojunctions, respectively. The atoms colored blue, gold, cyan, grey, red and pink represent Cs, Pb, I, Sn, O and pseudo-H, respectively. (d) Formation energies of the six SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces with different interfacial terminals. The dashed and solid lines depict the relatively high and low formation energies of the heterointerfaces, respectively. For simplicity, SnO2 and CsPbI3 are labeled as A and B, respectively, in (d).	 

	(1)

 	Fig. 2  Band structures (upper panel of the subgraph) and interfacial states in real space (lower panel of the subgraph) of SnO2/CsPbI3 heterojunctions. (a) For prototype-I heterojunctions. (b)–(e) For prototype-I heterojunction with MgSn, 2MgSn, 3MgSn and 4MgSn defects at the interface, respectively. (f) For prototype-II heterojunction. (g) For prototype-II heterojunction with Cli defects at the interface. (h) For prototype-III heterojunction. (i) and (j) for prototype-III heterojunction with ClO and NO defects at the interface, respectively. The red and blue circles in the band structures represent the elemental orbital contributions from the bulk of SnO2 and CsPbI3, respectively. The green circles represent the orbital contributions of the interfacial (a) Sn-5s, Sn-5p, O-2p and I-5p; (b)–(e) Sn-5s, Sn-5p, Mg-3s, O-2p and I-5p; (f) Sn-5s, Pb-6p, O-2p and I-5p; (g) and (i) Pb-6p, O-2p, I-5p and Cl-3p; (h) Pb-6p, O-2p and I-5p; (j) Pb-6p, O-2p, I-5p and N-2p. The red dashed lines indicate the energy positions of the highest occupied states.	 

 	Fig. 3  Phase diagram of SnO2 and defect formation energies of the SnO2/CsPbI3 interface under external element doping. (a) and (b) The maximum allowed chemical potentials of dopants in the SnO2 phase diagram restricted by the secondary phases of Mg2SnO4 and ZnO under Mg and Zn cation doping, respectively and by SnCl2, SnCl4 and Sn(NO3)4 under Cl and N anion doping, respectively. (c) The formation energies of 3MgSn, 3ZnSn, 4MgSn, 4ZnSn and ClO defects at the prototype-I heterointerface. (d) The formation energies of Cli and Mgi defects at the prototype-II heterointerface and the formation energies of ClO, NO and 3MgSn defects at the prototype-III heterointerface. The solid and dashed lines represent the relatively low and high formation energies of defects, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  The dipole moment changes induced by different numbers of MgSn defects at the prototype-I heterointerface, the Cli defect at the prototype-II heterointerface (left pattern) and the ClO and NO defects at the prototype-III heterointerface (right pattern), which are obtained by subtracting the interfacial dipole moment of the undoped system from that of the doped system. The differential charge densities are derived from the difference between the charge densities of the doped and the undoped systems. The isosurface of differential charge density is 0.07e bohr−3. The differential charge density integrated from the x − y plane along the z-axis is presented in arbitrary units. The sizes and directions of the arrows represent the changes in the interfacial dipole moments.	 

 	Fig. 5  Charge trapping dynamics in the SnO2/CsPbI3 heterointerfaces. (a) Electron (solid lines) and hole (dashed lines) trapping dynamics in the pristine and 3MgSn and 3ZnSn doped prototype-I heterointerfaces. (b) Electron (solid lines) and hole (dashed lines) trapping dynamics in the pristine and Cli doped prototype-II heterointerfaces and the pristine and ClO doped prototype-III heterointerfaces. The time scales are fitted to the exponential function to match the data of population P(t) = exp(−t/τ) and P(t) = 1 − exp(−t/τ) for electrons and holes, respectively, where τ is the carrier lifetime.
