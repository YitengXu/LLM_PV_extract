    , Accepted 7th November 2022First published on 8th November 2022AbstractDonor (D)–electron acceptor (A) conjugated polymers are promising dopant-free, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) due to their tunable energy levels and band gaps, high hole mobility, and good film morphology. Owing to the superior carrier transport properties and multiple functional sites, benzotriazole (BTA) is a popular A unit to construct D–A polymeric donors for organic solar cells. By comparison, BTA based polymers employed as polymeric HTMs are studied much less. Herein, BTA units with different side chains are studied as the A unit of two polymeric HTMs, in which benzo[1,2b:4,5b′] dithiophene (BDT) served as the D unit. BTA bearing the branch side chains of ethylhexyl endows BDT-BTA copolymer PBTA-26 with higher hole mobility and better film morphology than PBTA-8 with the straight side chains of octyl. The n–i–p PVSCs employing PBTA-26 as a dopant-free HTM exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 19.83%, which is thought to be among the highest performances achieved from the PVSCs with BTA based HTMs. This work will enrich the variety of high-performance polymeric HTMs.
Introduction
In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to the rapid improvement of their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–7 Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play important roles in balancing carrier transport and reducing charge recombination.8,9 In particular in conventional n–i–p PVSCs, good protection function is particularly required for the hole-transporting layer (HTL) inserted between the perovskite active layer and the metal electrode.10,11 To date, the most common HTM for n–i–p PVSCs has been 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).12,13 However, the nonplanar structure of spiro-OMeTAD results in large molecular distances and weak intermolecular interactions, thus displaying poor carrier mobility.14 To address this issue, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) are used as the dopants of spiro-OMeTAD.15 But these hygroscopic dopants are negative for the long-term stability of the PVSCs.16 Moreover, the complex synthesis route as well as the poor film quality limits the applicability of spiro-OMeTAD in future large-scale PVSCs. In general, there are three disadvantages in the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL: (1) because of the phase-separation, the doped film cannot keep high stability for a long period of time; (2) the dopant of LiTFSI easily absorbs water, which is harmful to perovskite; (3) dopants and phase-separation will decrease the compactness of the film, thus decreasing the protection effects. Naturally, dopant-free HTMs with high hole mobility are developed for obtaining high performance PVSCs.17–19
Electron donor (D)–electron acceptor (A) polymers exhibit excellent hole transport properties through internal charge transfer (ICT) systems.20 Possessing high absorptivity and hole mobility, D–A polymers are the perfect candidates for HTMs used in n–i–p PVSCs.21 Benzotriazole (BTA) is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic unit, which has high carrier transport capacity due to its electron withdrawing imide (–CN–) on the skeleton.22 In addition, containing multiple functional sites in the structure, BTA can be molecularly modified facilely to achieve excellent photoelectric properties. Polymer J71 containing the D unit of benzo[1,2b:4,5b′]dithiophene (BDT) and the A unit of BTA yielded a PCE of 12.12%.23 Polymer SGT-512 composed of pyrroloindacenodithiophene as the D unit, and BTA as the A unit achieved a PCE of 15.57%.24 Copolymer L2 containing fluorinated BTA as the A unit and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran as the D unit endowed the devices with a peak PCE of 14.0%.25 D–A polymeric HTM with indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the D unit and BTA as the A unit was developed by us, the resulting device present a PCE of 17.1%.26 All these interesting results indicate the vast scope for further exploration of BTA based polymeric HTMs.
Besides the molecular design on the main chain of polymers, side chain engineering can modulate molecular weight, intermolecular interactions, charge transport, and film morphology, effectively.27 In our previous work, BDT-benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) copolymers with various side chains of BDT, including alkoxy, thiophene, and carbazole, brought different device performances with a PCE of 10.23%, 19.07%, and 22.06%, respectively.28 Three fluorinated BTA based polymers with a different side chain of ethylhexyl, hexyldecyl, and octyldodecyl endowed PVSCs with peak PCEs of 1.3%, 9.3%, and 12.1%, respectively.29 Although alkyl side chain engineering is a common technique, it is also one of the most useful optimization tools for obtaining high-performance organic photoelectric materials.30 Employing different lengths of alkyl or alkoxy, polymeric HTMs present much different hole transport properties in the literature.31,32
In this work, continuing the research on well-performed carbazole side-chained BDT, we developed two polymers by Stille polymerization, in which BTA with different side chains served as the A unit and BDT with a carbazole side chain served as the D unit. Two polymers are investigated thoroughly from materials, films, to devices. PBTA-26 with the branched side chains of ethylhexyl presented higher hole mobility and better surface morphology than PBTA-8 with the straight chains of octyl, which endowed the dopant-free, n–i–p PVSCs with a peak PCE of 19.83%. In addition, both polymeric HTMs with high coplanarity have been demonstrated as effective surface passivation agents for perovskite.
Results and discussion
Chemical structures and synthetic routes of polymers are shown in Scheme 1. PBTA-8 was synthesized by Stille polycondensation between 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-octyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (compound 1a) and 3,3′-(2,6-bis trimethyltin benzothiophene)-4,8-bis (9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole) (2) under the catalysis of Pd(PPh3)4 and the solvent of toluene. PBTA-26 was produced in a similar manner to PBTA-8 except that 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl) -2-(2-ethylhexyl)-5,6-difluoro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole was used instead of compound 1a. The obtained polymers were purified using a Soxhlet extractor, extracted sequentially with methanol, acetone, n-hexane, and dichloromethane to remove oligomers, and finally collected with chloroform.

PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 have good solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene. The number of average molecular weight (Mn) and their polydispersity indexes (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The Mn values of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 were 14.4 kDa and 23.3 kDa with corresponding PDI of 1.77 and 1.89, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a, thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 is 445 °C and 437 °C, respectively, which confirms the high thermal stability of two HTMs.

UV-vis absorption spectra of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 in chloroform solution and solid state are shown in Fig. 1b, and the corresponding optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers exhibit two absorption bands in the range of 300–650 nm, in which the absorption band at 300–500 nm can be attributed to π–π* transition,33,34 and the one at 500–650 nm is ascribed to the ICT between the D unit and the A unit.35,36 The shoulder absorption peaks of two polymers in solution state and solid state indicate strong intermolecular interactions between polymer chains. Compared with the absorption profile in solution, red-shifted and broader absorption of polymers in a solid state is due to the π–π staking of polymer chains. The absorption edges of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 in a solid state are 630 and 625 nm, respectively. According to the empirical formula Eoptg = 1240/λ, the optical band gaps of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 are 1.97 and 1.98 eV, respectively.

In Fig. 1c, the onset of the irreversible oxidation wave (EOX) of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 is 0.90 and 0.94 V, respectively, which were obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. According to the empirical formula EHOMO = −e(4.8 + EOX − EFOC) (EFOC = 0.43 V is ferrocene oxidation potential),37 the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 are −5.27 and −5.31 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 calculated from HOMO level and optical band gap are −3.30 and −3.33 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy level of PBTA-26 (−5.31 eV) is closer to the valence band of perovskite (−5.52 eV) (Fig. 1d), which is beneficial to the transport and extraction of holes, thus effectively reducing energy loss.38
Density functional theory (DFT) was used to analyze the influence of side chains on molecular conformation and electronic structure of the polymers, and the optimized molecular conformation of the repeat unit of polymers is shown in Fig. 2. The dihedral angles between the π bridge of thiophene and the D unit are 167° and 173° for PBTA-8 and PBTA-26, respectively. Dihedral angles between the π bridge of thiophene and the A unit of both polymers are 178°. The dihedral angles between the D unit and the A unit were 171° and 173° for PBTA-8 and PBTA-26, respectively. Both polymers present high coplanarity, and PBTA-26 has slightly higher coplanarity than PBTA-8, which benefits to form π–π stacking between polymer skeletons in the solid state.39 These results are in good agreement with the observations from UV-vis absorption spectra.40

Hole mobility of polymers was characterized by space charge limited current (SCLC), and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curve was obtained under dark conditions. According to the Mott–Gurney formula (1),41,42 (1)εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, μh is the hole mobility of the active layer, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The resulting hole mobility of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 is 1.52 × 10−4 and 4.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). Both polymers can be directly used as HTMs of PVSCs without any additives because their hole mobility is nearly one order of magnitude higher than the undoped spiro-OMeTAD (∼5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).43 Hole mobility of PBTA-26 is higher than that of PBTA-8, this may result from the closer molecular stacking of PBTA-26 in the thin film state.44 The high coplanarity of polymers is conducive to the π–π stacking between the backbones of polymers in the solid state. The preferential intermolecular oriented π–π* stack makes the π–π* transition more easily for charge transfer, therefore improving the hole mobility of the polymers.45
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to check the effect of HTL deposition on the crystallinity of the underlying perovskite. All the pristine perovskite and the perovskite covered with HTMs exhibit the typical peaks at 2θ of 14.11°, 28.41°, and 43.21°, which are corresponding to (110), (220), and (330) of perovskite lattice planes, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†).46 Water contact angle (WCA) can reflect the water resistance of films. Compared with the pristine perovskite, the perovskite covered with PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 display higher WCAs (Fig. S4, ESI†). The hydrophobic polymers can provide effective protection of perovskite from water.47,48
Passivation effects of HTMs were checked with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energies of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 of the pristine perovskite are 138.3 eV and 143.3 eV, respectively. Pb 4f peaks of perovskite/HTM shift 0.8 eV to the lower binding energy states, indicating a strong electrostatic force between Pb2+ and HTMs due to the rich N and S atoms of the polymeric HTMs.26 The lone pair electrons of the N atom and S atom can delocalize the 6p vacant orbital of Pb2+ to form a strong coordination bond, which leads to the lower binding energy of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2.49 Binding energies of I 3d5/2 (628.9 eV) and I 3d3/2 (630.4 eV) shift around 0.6 eV to 628.3 eV and 629.8 eV after perovskite was covered with HTMs, which is attributed to F substituents of aromatic rings.50 Both indicate that the interaction between HTMs and perovskite reduces the valence electrons involved in the bond.

Two polymeric HTMs were evaluated in the PVSCs with an n–i–p structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 4a). The optimal thickness of HTLs is about 50 nm, while that of doped spiro-OMeTAD is always higher than 150 nm.51 The J–V curves of the devices with different HTMs tested under forward and reverse scanning directions are shown in Fig. 4b, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. PBTA-8 gave devices the highest PCE of 17.83%, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.142 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.82 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.35%. PBTA-26 endowed the devices with a peak PCE of 19.83% with a VOC of 1.148 V, a JSC of 22.87 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.51%, which is thought to be among the highest values reported on the PVSCs employing BTA based HTMs (Table S1, ESI†). Compared with PBTA-8, PBTA-26 has a slightly deeper HOMO energy level and significantly higher hole mobility, resulting in higher VOC, JSC, and FF. In addition, hysteresis factor (HI) was used to represent the hysteresis degree of PVSCs, which is determined by eqn (2).52 (2)HI of PVSCs based on PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 were 0.099 and 0.061, respectively. The lower HI values may be due to the higher hole mobility of PBTA-26 and better interface morphology of perovskite/PBTA-26.53 As shown in Fig. 4c, high EQE values appear in the full visible light range, and the integrated current density of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 is 21.72 mA cm−2 and 22.09 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values extracted from J–V curves. The current density and PCE corresponding to the steady-state output of the maximum power point of the PVSCs based on different HTMs are shown in Fig. 4d. The stabilized PCEs of the devices PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 were 17.43% and 19.47%, and their stabilized current densities are 18.7 and 20.66 mA cm−2, respectively, with negligible changes after tracking for 100 s.

The photovoltaic parameter distributions of PVSCs are shown in Fig. 5, which can reflect the reproducibility of devices. The narrower distribution of the devices with PBTA-26 demonstrates the superior reproducibility of the devices with PBTA-8. The JSC value of the devices with PBTA-26 is slightly higher than that of the devices with PBTA-8, and the overwhelming advantage in FF is shown from the device with PBTA-26, which are thought to be attributed to the higher hole mobility and better interface morphology of perovskite/PBTA-26. The average PCE of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 is 16.28% and 19.13%, respectively.

In order to study the passivation effect of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 on perovskite, the trap-state density of the perovskite covered with/without HTMs was checked from dark J–V curves of the hole-only devices with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 6a). The trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL) is 0.93, 0.85, and 0.72 V for the device without HTMs, with PBTA-8, and with PBTA-26, respectively. The calculated trap-state density (ntrap) is 1.84 × 1016, 2.37 × 1015, and 2.17 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The polymeric HTLs around 50 nm are found to reduce ntrap by one order of magnitude, confirming the full coverage and high passivation effect of HTMs on perovskite. The electron-rich plane conjugated skeleton of the polymer enables the electron-donating atoms (N and S) to act as Lewis bases to partially passivate the defects caused by uncoordinated Pb2+ on the surface, and F substituents of aromatic rings can passivate I− migrating to the surface of perovskite films.54 The lower ntrap of the device with PBTA-26 indicates fewer recombination centers, resulting in higher photocurrent and FF.55,56

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to further investigate the effects of the HTLs on charge transfer, equivalent circuit diagram and fitting curves are shown in Fig. 6b. Recombination resistance (Rrec) represents the compound resistance of charge in the low frequency range.57,58 The Rrec value of the devices with PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 is 1.98 and 2.75 kΩ cm2, respectively, indicating that the charge recombination probability of PBTA-26 devices is lower than that of PBTA-8 devices. These results are consistent with the higher FF obtained from PBTA-26 devices. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the dark current density of the PBTA-26 device is lower than that of the PBTA-8 device, so lower charge recombination of the PBTA-26 device can be expected.59,60
The interfacial charge transport characteristics were investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) tests. Steady-state PL spectra of the pristine perovskite and the perovskite covered with HTMs are shown in Fig. 6c. The excitation wavelength of the tested samples is 464 nm, and the PL peak of the pristine perovskite is 761 nm. There is an obvious blue shift up to 14 nm in PL spectra of the perovskite covered with both HTMs, which confirms that the trap state density of perovskite is reduced significantly by the coverage of HTMs. The interface charge recombination loss is decreased and the hole collection efficiency is improved. The higher the quenching efficiency of the film, the faster the charge transfer rate at the interface. Effective quenching can accelerate charge separation, which will contribute to the higher photocurrent of solar cells.31 The quenching efficiency of the perovskite covered with PBTA-26 is higher than that with PBTA-8, which indicates that extracting holes from perovskite/PBTA-26 is more effective.61,62 TRPL can reveal the carrier transport dynamics between perovskite and HTL (Fig. 6d). TRPL curves were fitted by a double exponential equation,63,64 and the detailed parameters are calculated and listed in Table S2 (ESI†). τave of perovskite/PBTA-26 (130 ns) is lower than that of the pristine perovskite (194 ns) and perovskite/PBTA-8 (166 ns), which are consistent with the steady-state PL quenching efficiency, implying the faster charge transfer at the perovskite/PBTA-26 interface.65

Fig. 7 displayed the atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology of the pristine perovskite as well as the perovskite covered with HTMs. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the pristine perovskite, perovskite/PBTA-8, and perovskite/PBTA-26 is 29.2, 18.1, and 14.3 nm, respectively. The RMS of the samples with HTMs decreases significantly, confirming the full surface coverage of polymeric HTMs on perovskite again. The smoother surface of perovskite/PBTA-26 implies a better surface morphology between perovskite and PBTA-26. In general, the good surface morphology of PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 films can prevent the charge recombination loss caused by direct contact between perovskite and electrodes.66

It is well known that dopant-free, compact, and hydrophobic polymer films can act as protective layers for n–i–p PVSCs, which can prevent perovskite active layers from a metal electrode, water, and sealing glue. Therefore, the long-term stability of encapsulated devices under atmospheric ambient conditions (humidity around 50%, room temperature) was checked. As shown in Fig. 8, both devices with PBTA-8 and PBTA-26 presented good long-term stability. After 30 days in atmospheric conditions, the storage devices retained about 75% of their initial efficiency.

Conclusions
Two BTA based polymers were synthesized and studied as dopant-free HTMs for n–i–p PVSCs. Compared with PBTA-8, PBTA-26 bearing the side chains of ethylhexyl presents a more suitable HOMO energy level, higher hole mobility, and better surface morphology. The peak PCE of 19.83% obtained from the PBTA-26 based device is a very promising value for the BTA based HTMs. Both polymers containing rich N, S, and F atoms are demonstrated to be efficient passivation agents for perovskite active layer. Thus, this work can provide useful clues on developing new polymeric HTMs possessing multiple functions including protection, passivation, and interface modification.
