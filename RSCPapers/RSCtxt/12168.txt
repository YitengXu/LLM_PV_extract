    , Accepted 3rd March 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractSolar water splitting by photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is emerged as a promising route for H2 production. However, thus far no single component material can fulfill all the requirements for high efficiency PEC behavior, especially for the photoanode which conducts the water oxidation, while constructing a composite photoelectrode can result in improved performance. Herein, a simple wet-chemical treatment method is introduced to in situ fabricate ZnFe2O4 onto conductive Al:ZnO nanowire arrays for solar-driven water splitting. Benefiting from the high conductivity of Al:ZnO and the visible-spectrum absorption of ZnFe2O4, such a host–guest structure has finally led to an excellent photoelectrochemical performance with low onset potential (VRHE = 0.38 V) and a photocurrent density of 1.72 mA cm−2 (VRHE = 1.23 V). Notably, the low onset potential gives this structure great potential for application in unassisted light-driven tandem-type PEC cells.
Introduction
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, solar-driven artificial photoelectrochemical devices were designed for sustainable fuel production, such as H2via water splitting and hydrocarbons via CO2 reduction. Since Fujishima first reported the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of a TiO2 photoelectrode in 1972, a series of semiconductor materials such as TiO2,1 ZnO,2–4 hematite (α-Fe2O3)5–8 and WO39,10 were widely investigated. However, to date, none of these single candidates can fulfill all the demands of an ideal photoelectrode material (especially the photoanode which processes the sluggish 4-electron-involved oxygen evolution reaction) such as high light harvesting efficiency (LHE), facile charge transportation, effective charge separation and long stability.11 Moreover, nontoxic and earth-abundant components should be also taken fully into account for economic and environmental concerns.
Recently, many studies have been devoted to constructing composite photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting for the purpose of addressing the problems of single component photoelectrodes.12–15 The combination of multiple elements may generate a synergetic effect with potential panchromatic absorption and ready charge separation, thus leading to a satisfactory PEC performance. Photoactive materials assembled on structure-designed transparent conducting oxide (TCO) based charge collectors rather than on conventional planar TCO glass have been highlighted as efficient strategies, for example Nb:SnO2 nanoparticles/hematite16 and Sb:SnO2 nanoparticles/TiO2.17 Moreover, by virtue of the nano-engineering of the TCO charge collectors, a number of structures including 1D Sb:SnO2 nanorod/hematite,18 1D Sn:In2O3 nanowire/CuO,19 3D Sb:SnO2 macropore/hematite,20 3D F:SnO2 nanocone array/hematite,21 3D Al:ZnO inverse opal/BiVO422 and 3D Al:ZnO/TiO2 nanocone array/Au23 have been widely demonstrated to improve the PEC performance.
Zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4, ZFO) is one of the spinel ferrites (MFe2O4, M = Zn, Mg, Ca, etc.) with a band gap of 1.9–2.1 eV,24–27 which has been regarded as a promising photoanode material candidate due to its broad adsorption range in the visible spectrum along with favorable chemical and physical stability. Moreover, ZFO has emerged as an alternative to the typical iron based oxide, hematite. The PEC performance of hematite is widely known to be hindered by its poor conductivity, high-temperature activation process and the need for an external bias due to the mismatch between the band edge positions and the electrochemical potential of the solution. However, the conductivity of ZFO is two orders of magnitude higher than that of hematite,28 which would potentially accelerate the photo-generated carriers' transportation and separation. The conduction band edge of zinc ferrite is reported to be negative enough to minimize the need for an external bias14 and it is unnecessary to conduct high-temperature post-heat-treatment to activate its PEC performance. Recently, several studies have been focused on the synthesis methods of ZFO films27,29,30 or combining ZFO with other semiconductors,26,31–33 however, the photocurrent densities of these ZFO-containing photoanodes still remain lower than 1 mA cm−2 at VRHE = 1.23 V. Hence, it is highly desirable to grow ZFO on structure-optimized transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrodes with the aim of high PEC performance.
In this report, a simple wet-chemical treatment method is used to in situ synthesize zinc ferrite modified Al:ZnO (AZO) nanowire arrays for solar-driven water splitting. By integrating the high conductivity of AZO with the wide absorption range of zinc ferrite, the synergetic effects of these two components finally led to a high performance with low onset potential of VRHE = 0.38 V and photocurrent density of 1.72 mA cm−2 at VRHE = 1.23 V.
Experimental
Preparation of the ZnO and Al:ZnO nanowire arrays
The Al:ZnO nanowire arrays on FTO substrate were prepared by a hydrothermal growth method modified from our previous report on the synthesis of ZnO nanoarrays.34 For the deposition of Al:ZnO nanowire arrays, additional aluminum nitrate was added to the growth solution as the Al source and the dopant concentration could be tuned by changing the amount of aluminum nitrate. The deposition was performed at 88 °C and the film thickness was easily controlled by varying the reaction time.
Preparation of the ZnFe2O4 modified AZO nanowire arrays
Typically, the as-prepared AZO nanowire array/FTO was immersed into 0.02 M FeCl3 ethanol solution for 1 min to 7 min without any disturbance. Then the sample was immediately rinsed with ethanol and dried in air at 70 °C, followed by annealing at 550 °C for 1 h to transform the Fe into ZnFe2O4 and to achieve better crystallinity.
Characterization
The morphology and composition of the samples were measured using an FE-SEM (JSM-6330F) and an HRTEM (JEOL-2010 HR). The XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. A UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) was employed to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra.
Electrochemical characterization
All the electrochemical characterizations were performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) operating with the Thales 2.29 software. Unless otherwise stated, all the potentials are reported relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed with 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 6.5), a standard 3-electrode configuration with the prepared film as the photoanode, a Pt mesh as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. To simulate the sunlight illumination, a 150 W Xe lamp (LSXS-150, ZOLIX Instruments) coupled with an AM 1.5G filter (BCF-AM 1.5G-050, Beijing Zolix Instruments Co. Ltd.) was equipped and the light density was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 by calibrating with a standard Si solar cell. To probe the injection efficiency, the published procedure was used.35 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the range of 50 mHz to 20 KHz, with AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at a DC bias of 1.23 V in 0.1 M Na2SO4. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded in the same cell system as a function of wavelength from 365 nm to 650 nm using a Zahner Zennium C-IMPS system (TLS-03), under a bias of 1.23 V.
Results and discussion
The fabrication of the ZFO decorated AZO nanowire array photoanode is described in the Experimental section. Typically, a modified hydrothermal method was employed to fabricate AZO nanowire arrays on FTO glass substrates. As shown in Fig. 1a and S1a,† the as-prepared AZO nanowire arrays have well-defined hexagonal cross sections and smooth surfaces with diameters of ∼130 nm and lengths of ∼7 μm. The quantitative analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) shows that the Al concentration can be tuned in the range of 0.25–1% (Fig. S2†). Then, the FTO/AZO nanowire film was immersed in 0.02 M FeCl3 ethanol solution to conduct wet-chemical treatment, followed by rinsing with ethanol and annealing at 550 °C for 1 h. The optical image (Fig. S3†) shows that the pristine white AZO film turned red, and became darker as the FeCl3 treatment period was prolonged. The morphology evolution of the composite AZO–ZFO photoanodes synthesized with different treatment times is shown in Fig. 1e. The SEM top-view image (Fig. 1b) of the 0.5% Al-doped ZnO film treated with FeCl3 ethanol solution for 1 min (defined as 0.5% AZO–ZFO-1 min) shows that the surface of the AZO nanowire was etched and became rough, which can be ascribed to the acidic environment of the FeCl3 ethanol solution and the coordination effect of Cl−. Intriguingly, as the treatment time increased, the centre of the exposed (001) facet began to dissolve, resulting in a hollow structure on the upper section of each nanowire (Fig. 1c and d). Such a phenomenon is attributed to the formation of soluble ZnCl+ by the adsorption of Cl− ions on the (001) facet of the AZO nanowire which selectively converts the nanowires into nanotubes, which has been previously reported for ZnO nanotubes.36 The depth of the hollow structure increased with increasing treating time. Additionally, the cross-section images (Fig. S1†) show that the film thickness slightly decreased after the wet-chemical treatment.

The XRD pattern of 0.5% AZO–ZFO-3 min (Fig. S4†) confirms the existence of ZFO with franklinite structure. The major diffraction peak located at 34.4° indicated that the AZO nanowires have a preferred orientation growth along the c-axis perpendicular to the FTO substrate. Notably, there is no evidence that hematite impurities exist, indicating that the Fe ions on the surface of the AZO were thoroughly transformed into ZFO after the thermal treatment.
To characterize the photoelectrochemical performance, a 3-electrode configuration was employed with the AZO/ZFO film as the working electrode, a Pt mesh counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte 0.1 M Na2SO4 was purged with N2 for at least 30 min before tests. A 150 W Xe lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter were employed to simulate solar radiation (100 mW cm−2). Unless otherwise mentioned, all the applied potentials are reported relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + E0Ag/AgCl
The effect of the FeCl3 ethanol solution treatment time on the PEC properties of the 0.5% AZO–ZFO composite photoanodes was tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 with front-side illumination, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The LSV data under chopped illumination show that the samples are very sensitive to light and no substantial current was observed when the light was switched off. The photocurrent densities of all the composite samples exhibit an enhancement compared to the pristine AZO film, which is ascribed to the broadened absorption range due to the ZFO loading. As shown in Fig. S5,† a significant red shift of the absorption band edge to 650 nm can be observed in the composite photoelectrode. Moreover, the percentage absorption (A%) increases with the treatment time, which means a higher ZFO loading and more efficient light harvesting behavior. The best PEC performance was achieved by the 0.5% AZO–ZFO-3 min photoanode with a current density of 1.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (Fig. 2a), which is significantly better than the bare AZO. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new photocurrent density record for photoanodes involving ZFO as the photoactive material (details are summarized in Table S1†). Such results must be an outcome of a synergy between light absorption, charge separation and surface charge injection efficiency. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) η was calculated using the following formula:η = J(1.23 − Vapp)/Pin × 100%where the Vapp is the measured applied voltage, J is the externally measured photocurrent density, and Pin is the power density of the illumination. The ABPE plots of various photoanodes are shown in Fig. 2b and the maximum ABPE can reach up to 0.28% for 0.5% AZO–ZFO-3 min at an external bias of 0.86 V, which is ∼600% enhancement compared with the pristine AZO film (0.047%).
 Fig. 2  (a) LSV plots of 0.5% AZO and 0.5% AZO–ZFO photoanodes under chopped illumination and (b) the corresponding ABPE plots. 
Additionally, the film thickness and Al dopant concentrations in AZO scaffolds were also optimized, as shown in Fig. S6.† A thick film can absorb more incident light to create more electron–hole pairs and provide higher surface area to process water splitting reactions. However, it can also prolong the charge transfer route to the conducting substrate, which would raise the charge recombination and decrease the charge collection efficiency, especially in the front-side (film-side) illumination conditions that are used in our experiments to minimize the transmittance loss of FTO glass. As a result, the optimal film thickness is 7 μm (Fig. S6a†). For the Al dopant amount in AZO, though a higher Al doping level may increase the carrier concentration, the resulting structure defects and electron scattering effects may diminish the mobility. Thus there is a trade-off in increasing Al dopant concentration between the positive effect (increased carrier concentration) and negative effect (serious defects and electron scattering) on conductivity.20 Herein, the best PEC performance was achieved when the Al dopant concentration in AZO scaffold was 0.5% (Fig. S6b†), which is consistent with other reports.22,37
It is worth highlighting that the onset potential of the AZO–ZFO photoanode is as low as ∼0.38 V, even lower than the pristine AZO photoanode.38–40 Interestingly, this low onset potential is much more negative than that of the single component ZFO photoelectrode tested under similar conditions, which was around 0.9 V.27,29 The onset potential, or so-called turn-on potential, is a key parameter to evaluate the PEC performance of a photoanode. A lower onset potential means less energy assistance from the external potentiostat, which can even realize the unassisted solar water splitting. Actually, the high onset potential is one of the key challenges of hematite-based electrodes due to the mismatch between the band edge positions and the electrochemical potential of the solution. Hence, many attempts have been devoted to minimizing the onset potential from both the energetics and kinetics perspectives.41–44 As for the present AZO–ZFO material, we believe the low onset potential must be a consequence of the relatively high photoelectrochemical potential levels of both the AZO and ZFO components, derived from the Mott–Schottky results (Fig. S7†).
To identify possible explanations for the photoelectrochemical performances of the various photoanodes with different treatment times, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 3a, the TEM image of the sample with shorter treatment time (0.5% AZO–ZFO-1 min) illustrates that the surface of the AZO nanowire was etched while the nanowire morphology was retained, which was in accordance with the observations of the corresponding SEM images (Fig. 1b). Fig. 3c shows the 0.5% AZO–ZFO-3 min sample has the hollow structure on the upper section due to the partial dissolution of the nanowire core by Cl− etching. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3b and d) further reveal that the AZO nanowire has a preferred growth direction of [0001] according to the lattice spacing of 0.52 nm (the distance between two [0002] crystal planes). Interestingly, the ZFO layer has obvious differences for the two AZO–ZFO samples. Fig. 3b (0.5% AZO–ZFO-1 min) shows the thickness of the ZFO layer is approximately 8 nm and the lattice fringe is unclear implying the amorphous nature of the ZFO. By means of EDX mappings and line scanning (Fig. S8†), we can learn the distributions of Zn and Fe across AZO–ZFO. However, in the 0.5% AZO–ZFO-3 min case, a clear lattice fringe which corresponds to the (311) or (400) plane of ZFO can be easily observed. Moreover, the thickness of the ZFO layer increases to ∼15 nm (Fig. 3d and S9†). Further prolonging the treatment time to 7 min finally leads to a thicker ZFO layer with fine crystallinity (Fig. S10a and b†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S10c†) reveals the sample contains the AZO and ZFO. Hence, the thickness of ZFO increases accompanying the transformation from an amorphous to crystalline structure when the FeCl3 treatment time increased from 1 min to 7 min. For PEC application, typically, the ZFO illuminated by incident light would generate electron–hole pairs in the bulk, and the holes would subsequently migrate to the surface to inject into the solution for water oxidation reaction, while the electrons would be collected by the charge collectors and reach the counter electrode for water reduction reaction. Thus, both the light harvesting process and the charge transfer process would have significant impacts on the PEC performances. The thicker ZFO layer and better ZFO crystallinity can lead to a higher light harvesting efficiency and superior charge transportation within the ZFO crystalline structure, respectively. However, the charge transfer resistance in the crystalline ZFO and at the ZFO–electrolyte interface would also impact on the PEC performance. Therefore, the ZFO layer should have an optimal thickness to efficiently transport the holes from the film to the solution. Otherwise, serious electron–hole recombination would arise and consequently hamper the PEC performance.

The injection efficiencies of different photoanodes were further measured to demonstrate the effect of the ZFO shell on the PEC performance.35Fig. 4a shows that the injection efficiency positively correlates to the applied voltage since a higher bias can provide external power to assist the hole flux injection into the electrolyte. Moreover, the injection efficiency was firstly significantly enhanced as the treatment time increased and reached a maximum at 3 min, which is ascribed to the increased thickness and better crystallinity of the ZFO layer according to the HRTEM images (Fig. 3b and d). Then the injection efficiency dropped when the treatment time was further prolonged (e.g. 5 or 7 min), which can be attributed to the slow charge transport in the thicker ZFO layer.

To emphasize the advantages of the AZO charge collector and the AZO–ZFO heterojunction, photo-assisted electrochemical impedance spectra (PEIS) measurements were performed to further illustrate the charge transfer properties. All the plots were tested at a bias of 1.0 V under one sun illumination, with a sinusoidal alternating-current perturbation of 10 mV over the frequency range from 50 mHz to 20 kHz and fitted with a 2-RC (resistance and capacitance) equivalent circuit model as shown in Fig. S11a.†Fig. 4b shows the Nyquist plots of all the samples have two superimposed semicircles and are highly consistent with the fitting curves (solid lines). The details of fitting results are tabulated in Table 1. In the equivalent circuit (Fig. S11a†), Rs represents the series resistance of the whole device,45R1 and CPE1 are related to the bulk charge transfer process.25,27 The biggest arc in the lower frequency is considered as the charge transfer resistance (R2) at the semiconductor–liquid junction (SCLJ) interface. As mentioned previously, the sluggish OER process is a grand challenge to the design of high performance photoanode materials since it will raise the recombination and cause a concomitant loss of photocurrent. Various attempts have been carried out to minimize the resistance at the SCLJ interface, such as utilizing co-catalysts and building heterojunctions.42,46,47Fig. 4b shows that both the AZO–ZFO and ZnO–ZFO have much smaller R2 values compared to bare ZnO. This phenomenon elucidates that the additional ZFO is responsible for the decrease of R2. On the one hand, the AZO–ZFO structure can accelerate the charge separation and restrain the recombination by forming a heterojunction. On the other hand, the surface catalytic ability may be improved by the ZFO. Therefore, the reduction of R2 can be derived from reduced recombination and the promoted surface catalytic nature. For R1, a decrease can be observed for AZO–ZFO when compared with ZnO–ZFO (the LSV curve is shown in Fig. S11b†). Such a finding represents more facile charge transfer in AZO than ZnO which implies that a more conductive charge collector material will contribute to a better PEC performance. Based on the EIS results, we can conclude that the excellent performance of AZO–ZFO is related to the ease of charge transfer both in bulk and at the SCLJ interface.

Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded under similar conditions as the LSV tests as a function of wavelength from 380 nm to 700 nm using a Zahner Zennium C-IMPS system (TLS-03), under a bias at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The IPCE plots of AZO–ZFO and ZnO–ZFO (Fig. 4c) show that they are sensitive to both the ultraviolet region and the visible light region. This is in agreement with the absorption spectra (Fig. S5†). Prominently, the IPCE value of AZO–ZFO exceeds that of ZnO–ZFO in the whole wavelength range, illustrating a wavelength-uncorrelated factor, which is ascribed to accelerated charge transportation by the enhanced conductivity of AZO, and reduced charge recombination by the cascade conduction band alignment, as shown in Fig. 4d.
Conclusions
In summary, we reported a simple wet-chemical treatment method to fabricate in situ ZFO decorated AZO nanowire array composite material, which shows a significant improvement in the PEC performance caused by the expanded absorption wavelength range and efficient charge separation due to the formation of heterojunctions. The 0.5% AZO–ZFO-3 min composite photoanode exhibits a maximum photocurrent density of 1.72 mA cm−2 measured at a bias of VRHE = 1.23 V under one sun illumination in neutral electrolyte (0.1 M Na2SO4), which is 5.6-fold increased compared with that of a pristine AZO electrode and also exceeds those of other reported state-of-the-art ZFO-containing photoanodes. Furthermore, the current elegant AZO nanowire array–ZFO nanoparticles design exhibits the record photocurrent density for ZFO-containing PEC water splitting systems. This work indicates that ZFO can serve as an excellent photo-absorber, and the combination of a high conductivity electron collector material with a photo-absorber material can ultimately trigger an ideal solution to achieve high performance solar-driven water splitting. Moreover, the low onset potential of the AZO–ZFO composite photoanode make it possible to integrate it with suitable photocathodes to construct photoelectrochemical tandem cell systems for overall water splitting.
