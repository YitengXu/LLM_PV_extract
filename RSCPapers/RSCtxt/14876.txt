    AbstractTransparent solar cells are very useful in making transparent electrical power supplies and tandem devices. We report the fabrication of semi-transparent polymer solar cells by replacing conventional metal electrode with a carbon nanotube film. The solar cells can be illuminated at both front and back sides, with power conversion efficiencies (up to 2.5%) comparable to cells using metal electrodes. The solar cells are highly transparent in near-infrared region, with an optical transmittance of nearly 80% in the range of 670 nm to 1.2 μm, and maintain a transmittance of above 60% through 1.2 to 2.5 μm. We further constructed a tandem structure with two subcells operating separately, in which the back cell receives infrared light transmitted through the front cell. Our infrared-transparent solar cells possess multiple functions such as serving as a light filter to drive a CdSe nanobelt photo-sensor with enhanced wavelength selectivity.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for low-cost renewable energy sources.1–5 Their power-conversion efficiencies can be greatly improved by incorporating specially designed polymeric molecules or developing multi-junction structures that can cover a broader range of solar spectrum.6–10 Transparent PSCs hold the advantage in allowing light with certain wavelength to pass through and fully utilize the incident light energy, and can be used to multifunctional electrical power supplies. In conventional PSCs, the use of vacuum deposited metal electrodes has limited their performance and also prevented vertical assembly of PSCs because of the presence of opaque electrodes. For example, when light has to be shone through the side of metal electrode, its low transparency (∼50%) resulted in significant performance loss of nanopillar-based solar cells even the metal film (Cu/Au) was made very thin (<15 nm).11 Recently, a semi-transparent organic solar cell with solution-processed laminated Ag nanowire mesh-like electrodes was reported, however, the measured optical transmittance (∼26%) in the range of 400 to 800 nm is still low.12 In addition, vertical assembly of PSCs with complementary absorption range that can operate in tandem requires a transparent intermediate electrode for incident light not absorbed by the front cell to pass through and reach the bottom cell with minimum loss.6–8
Candidates for transparent conducting electrodes include thin films of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene sheets and their hybrids, which have been incorporated into PSCs acting in a manner similar to indium tin oxide (ITO).13–18 Previous study has found that CNT or graphene films can extract holes effectively from conjugated polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend film, with acceptable processing compatibility in serving as a planar substrate for polymer deposition. While most of work has focused on using CNTs to remove ITO substrate as well as making flexible devices on plastic substrate, replacement of the top metal electrodes by CNT films to make transparent electrodes on both sides has been seldom explored.
Here, we report the fabrication of transparent PSCs by replacing conventional top metal electrode with a free-standing and highly transparent CNT film, with power conversion efficiencies (up to 2.5%) comparable to cells using metal electrodes, and the device can be illuminated at both front and back sides. The resulting PSCs are highly transparent in near-infrared region. The device transparency has allowed us to build a tandem structure composed of two separate cells with complementary absorption bands based on P3HT: PCBM and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/C60, respectively, in which the bottom CuPc/C60 cell receives infrared light transmitted through the top P3HT: PCBM cell. We further demonstrated that these infrared-transparent PSCs can be used as light filter to drive a CdSe nanobelt photo-sensor with enhanced wavelength selectivity.

Fig. 1a illustrates the structure and fabrication process of transparent solar cells made of four layers from bottom to top including an ITO-coated glass substrate, a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystal layer, a P3HT: PCBM absorption layer, and a top electrode (Ag or CNT film). In the step of top electrode fabrication, a freestanding CNT film was transferred to the surface of the P3HT: PCBM layer (supplemental Fig. S1†), allowing illumination from both front (ITO glass) and back (CNT) sides of the device. On the other hand, deposition of Ag electrode makes a conventional solar cell (control sample) that can only be illuminated from the ITO side. The inverted structure of control cell has been reported previously, in which electrons are extract through the ZnO underlayer and holes are extracted through the Ag electrode.2,3,5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization shows that the CNT film makes a smooth coating and partially embedded in the organic layer, indicating good wetting of CNTs to polymeric molecules (Fig. 1b). In this configuration, the CNT film serves as the counterpart to ITO electrode, and both electrodes are highly transparent. The CNT films are produced by chemical vapor deposition in large area19 with an optical transmittance of 80% to 95% in 400 to 2500 nm (similar to the ZnO-ITO layer) (Fig. 1c) and sheet resistances of 400 to 600 Ω·cm.
 Fig. 1  Fabrication of transparent polymer solar cells. (a) Illustration of the fabrication process of an ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT cell in which a CNT film is coated on top of the P3HT: PCBM layer. In comparison, a solar cell with metal electrode is fabricated by depositing a thin Ag film as the back electrode. (b) SEM image of the CNT film coated on the P3HT: PCBM layer. (c) Visible-near infrared transmission spectra of the ITO-ZnO layer (front side of cell) and CNT film (back side), respectively. Both front and back side electrodes have a transmittance of more than 80% across the spectrum (500 nm to 2.5 μm). Inset, SEM image of the CNT film used for testing. 
The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells are recorded in the dark and light conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). For the cell with CNT film electrode, the dark curve shows diode behavior where the reversed current density (0.19 mA cm−2 at −0.5V) is about 130 times lower than the forward current density (26 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V). The device responds to incident light from either side, producing different current densities (Fig. 2a). When illuminated from the front (ITO glass), the cell shows an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.84 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 40.2%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.48%. The efficiency of the same cell measured in back illumination (1.48%) is about 60% of that produced in front illumination. In our cells, ZnO nanocrystals not only serve as an electron collection and transport layer but also afford an additional interface for exciton dissociation and charge generation between P3HT and ZnO, hence front side illumination directly hits the polymer-ZnO interface and results in more effective photovoltaic process. In back side illumination, the majority of incident photons never reach the ZnO nanocrystals because of high absorption coefficient of P3HT: PCBM blend, and excitons produced by P3HT tend to crowd near the anode and rather than diffuse to the P3HT-ZnO interface, causing significant photonic loss and reduced efficiency. Our analysis is supported by incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra measured from the two sides respectively (Fig. 2b). The IPCE peak tested at the back side is flattened and lowered across the range of 450 nm to 600 nm compared with front side, indicating that more photonic loss takes place in back side illumination, as also demonstrated by the J–V curves in Fig. 2a.

(b) IPCE spectra of the same cell in front or back side illumination. (c) Dark and light J–V curves of a control cell with Ag electrode. (d) Recorded efficiency of the ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT cell placed in air in 5 days. 
Under the same condition, the control cell with Ag anode shows a Voc of 0.52 V and an efficiency of 2.45% in front illumination (Fig. 2c), very close to cells with CNT anode (Voc = 0.57 V, PCE = 2.48%). Use of CNT anode with a higher work function (4.8 eV) might be the reason for the higher open-circuit voltage observed here. Replacement of Ag electrode with CNT film actually results in comparable overall cell performance. We attribute the good performance of CNT electrode to its high mobility for hole transport, which has been demonstrated in other studies including CNT-silicon heterojunction cells.19–21 Because the top CNT electrode possesses a porous structure, the surface of underlying polymer layer is partially exposed. When placed in air, the solar cell shows gradual decrease of efficiency from 2.1% down to 1.3% after 5 days (Fig. 2d). Such degradation is due to oxygen and moisture attacking to the exposed area of P3HT: PCBM blend. The cell stability can be improved by device encapsulation or using less porous structures such as graphene sheets.
Because both sides use transparent electrodes (ITO and CNT), our solar cells are semi-transparent across a wide range of spectrum. The optical transmittance approaches 80% in near-infrared region (670 nm to 1.2 μm), and remains above 60% through 1.2 to 2.5 μm (Fig. 3a). The transmittance in the visible region (400 to 670 nm) is relatively low because P3HT has strong absorption in this range. In comparison, the control cell with Ag electrode does not transmit light at all (Fig. 3a). The transmitted infrared light can be utilized by a second solar cell with complementary absorption bands to be placed underneath. Here, we fabricated a classical small molecule solar cell based on CuPc/C60 heterojunction structure, which has been studied extensively.22,23 Absorption spectrum of the ITO/CuPc/C60/Bathocuproine (BCP) layer shows a broad band from 550 nm up to 800 nm (Fig. 3b) overlapping the wavelength range of light transmitted through the ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT cell. When these two cells are placed in tandem (Fig. 3c), the bottom cell still works by receiving light transmitted through the top cell, although the current density has decreased by about 60% (Fig. 3d). Energy diagrams of the top and bottom cell are provided in Fig. S2.† In this tandem device, the top and bottom cell delivers a Jsc of 8.10 and 1.81 mA cm−2, an efficiency of 2.03% and 0.34%, respectively (Fig. 4a and Table S2†). Without the top cell, the ITO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Al cell shows an efficiency of 1.19% (Fig. 3d). In parallel connection, the total Jsc reaches 10.53 mA cm−2 and the overall device efficiency is 2.33%, close to the sum of Jsc and efficiencies (2.37%) of the two subcells, and an IPCE value equal to the sum of two subcells as well, covering an extended range from 400 to 800 nm. The IPCE of the bottom cell drops considerably from 400 to 600 nm due to lack of incident photons in this range (Fig. 4b). In series connection, a relative low device efficiency (1%) is observed since the current density is limited by the smaller Jsc delivered by the bottom cell (1.65 mA cm−2). The transparency of our PSCs can also be seen from a standard silicon module (PCE = 11.26%) which can deliver a Jsc of 15 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 4.21% when placed in tandem as the bottom cell (Table S2†).

We further demonstrate that the transmitted light through ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT cells can be used to drive a CdSe nanostructure-based photo-sensor. CdSe nanowires have shown excellent photo-response in previous studies.24,25 We synthesized CdSe nanobelts with lengths of about 100 to 500 μm and widths of 5 to 20 μm by chemical vapor deposition (Fig. S3†) and contacted the ends of individual nanobelts by Al electrodes. The sensor device was then placed under an ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT cell (Fig. 5a). In this configuration, the solar cell serves as an optical filter to block a portion of incident light by P3HT: PCBM absorption. The current flow through the CdSe nanobelt is negligible in the dark, and increases by 1500 folds at the bias of 1 V when the nanobelt receives transmitted light through the top solar cell (Fig. 5b). In comparison, full exposure to a standard illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) results in 2200 fold-increase of current flow in the nanobelt. The current response is stable and reversible over many cycles when the incident light is turned on or off alternatively at a period of 10 s, although the detected current in response to filtered light is about 60% of that measured in full exposure (Fig. 5c).

(a) Illustration of an individual CdSe nanobelt contacted by Al electrodes and illuminated by the infrared light transmitted through a top cell. (b) I–V curves through the nanobelt in the dark, in full exposure to incident light, and when covered by a top cell, respectively. (c) Reversible current change over 6 cycles recorded in a nanobelt sensor under illumination of white light and infrared, respectively. The light intensity is calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2. (d) The value of current flow through the nanobelt under monochromic incident light scanning from 360 nm to 700 nm, when the nanobelt was fully exposed or covered by a top cell. 
In addition, current flow through the nanobelt has been recorded under incident wavelength from 400 to 700 nm at a calibrated intensity of 1 mW cm−2 and a bias of 1 V. Without solar cell filter, the current value remains at 300 to 500 nA through the spectrum. With filter, the current value is less than 150 nA in the range of 400 to 600 nm, but then increases to nearly 400 nA at 660 nm (Fig. 5d). Photo-response to visible light is reduced considerably due to absorption by the filter while response to infrared light remains at the same level, indicating enhanced selectivity to different wavelengths.
In summary, we demonstrated metal electrode-free, high transparency PSCs by replacing conventional metal layers by CNT films. The solar cell has a transmittance of 60% to 80% in near-infrared region, and the transmitted light is strong enough to excite a nanobelt photo-sensor with current increase by 3 orders of magnitude. Removal of metal electrodes will facilitate development of tandem structures and vertical assembly of devices. By selecting polymeric materials with tailored band-gaps, it is possible to enhance and tune solar cell transparency in desired wavelength range. Transparent solar cells also have applications in areas such as window coatings and self-powered optoelectronic systems.
Experimental
Synthesis and characterization of CNT films
The CNT films were synthesized by CVD method using ferrocene and xylene as the catalyst precursor and carbon source, respectively. A solution of ferrocene in xylene (0.06 g mL−1) with small addition of sulfur powder (Fe/S ratio of 10:1) was injected from the inlet of furnace and carried by Ar/H2 gas to the high temperature (1160 °C) zone to grow CNTs, and the as-grown film floated to the downstream zone and was collected by a nick foil substrate. The precursor solution was fed at a very slow rate (0.04 mL min−1) to obtain high quality products. Characterization by electron microscope shows that the CNT film has a high purity (>90%) and consist of mainly single-walled and double-walled tubes. The CNT film is a mixture of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes.
Fabrication of polymer solar cells
ITO (60 nm) coated glass substrates were cleaned and dried in air at 120 °C for 2 h. The ZnO layers were spin-coated onto the ITO using a zinc acetate-ethanol amine in 2-methoxyethanol solution, where the molar ratio of ZnAc to ethanol amine was 2.0 and the concentration of ZnAc was 0.26 M.3 After thermal annealing the ZnAc film at 300 °C for 60 min in air, the ZnO film was rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. This procedure was repeated three times to attain a thickness of 40 nm which was measured by a KLA-Tencor Alpha-Step Surface Profiler. To deposit organic layer, a chlorobenzene solution of P3HT (Regioregular, Rieke Metals) (25 mg ml−1) and PCBM (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich) (15 mg ml−1) was spin coated on the ZnO nanocrystal layer in a glove box and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. For control cell, 70 nm thick Ag electrode was vacuum deposited on top to complete the inverted structure. For transparent cell, the CNT film grown on Ni sheet was directly transferred onto the surface of the organic layer. Then 0.1 ml of ethanol was dropped on the CNT film and dried with N2 to make better contact between the CNT film and the organic layer.
Fabrication of ITO/CuPc(40 nm)/C60(50 nm)/BCP(7 nm)/Al(80 nm) cells
CuPc (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 50 nm C60 (>99.9%, Yongxin Technology CO. Ltd.) and BCP (98%, Acros Organics) were deposited in sequence on ITO glass at a 0.02 nm s−1 rate by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (7 × 10−7 Torr). Organic layers were annealed at 120 °C, and Al cathode was thermally evaporated on the top through a shadow mask. The film thicknesses were monitored by a quartz-crystal microbalance.
Fabrication of CdSe nanostructure photo-sensor
The CdSe nanobelts were synthesized by CVD in a tube furnace. CdSe powders (10 μm) were evaporated at 800 °C and a Si wafer with 5 nm Au film (acting as catalyst) was placed in downstream to grow nanobelts. The reaction time is typically 2 h, with a constant Ar flow at 100 sccm. As-grown nanobelts were detached from the substrate by gently shaking in ethanol, and a single nanobelt was deposited onto glass substrate with prepared Al electrodes.
Device measurement and characterization
The J–V characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System. An Oriel 300 W solar simulator (Thermo Oriel 91160-1000) with AM 1.5 G filter provides 100 mW cm−2 illumination, determined using a standard silicon solar cell. A mask was used to define the active area of all types of solar cells to be 6.8 mm2. SEM images were obtained using Hitachi S-4800. Absorption spectra of films and cells were measured by UV-3100 UV–vis-NIR Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). IPCE was recorded on Keithley 2400 source meter under irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240).

 	Fig. 3  Infrared transparency of solar cells and utilization of transmitted light by another cell. (a) Optical transmission spectrum of the cell with CNT electrode showing a transmittance of >60% through the near-infrared region. Control cell with Ag electrode is completely opaque in this range. (b) Optical absorption spectrum of CuPc/C60/BCP film deposited on quartz sheet showing photon absorption in the range of 400 to 800 nm. Inset, structure of the cell. (c) Illustration of the ITO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Al cell which works directly under illumination (full exposure) or works in a tandem configuration by receiving transmitted light through a transparent top cell (ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT). (d) J–V curves of the ITO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Al cell working in full exposure and in tandem (covered by a CNT cell).	 

 	Fig. 4  Tandem devices using a transparent top cell with CNT electrode. (a) J–V curves of an ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT top cell and an ITO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Al bottom cell working separately or connected in series or parallel. (b) IPCE spectra of an ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/CNT cell (square), an ITO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Al cell in direct illumination (circle) or in partial illumination through a top CNT cell (up triangle), and the tandem device in parallel connection (down triangle).	 

 	Fig. 5  Nanobelt sensor driven by the light transmitted through a transparent solar cell. (a) Illustration of an individual CdSe nanobelt contacted by Al electrodes and illuminated by the infrared light transmitted through a top cell. (b) I–V curves through the nanobelt in the dark, in full exposure to incident light, and when covered by a top cell, respectively. (c) Reversible current change over 6 cycles recorded in a nanobelt sensor under illumination of white light and infrared, respectively. The light intensity is calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2. (d) The value of current flow through the nanobelt under monochromic incident light scanning from 360 nm to 700 nm, when the nanobelt was fully exposed or covered by a top cell.
