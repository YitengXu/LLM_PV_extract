    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractThe design and construction of efficient electrode materials are significant for electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in water splitting devices and metal–air batteries. Herein, we report conductive metal–organic framework (C-MOF) nanowire arrays on carbon cloth as a promising electrocatalyst for OER. The pyrolysis-free C-MOF electrocatalyst can maintain intrinsic molecular active sites in the MOFs. The as-prepared electrode possesses overpotentials of ∼213 and 300 mV at 10 and 150 mA cm−2 and long-term stability in 1 M KOH, respectively. Control experiments and Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Mössbauer spectra indicate that the Fe doped in the Ni-based MOFs may serve as highly effective OER active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an unusual self-adaptable property of the Fe active sites, which enables the OER intermediates to generate additional hydrogen bonds with the neighboring layer, thus lowering the free energy in the OER process. Our findings may provide an alternative method for developing MOF electrocatalysts in frontier potential applications.
Introduction
Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies are essential for sustainable development of human society.1 The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a core process for renewable energy systems, such as water splitting and metal–air batteries.2 However, the multistep proton-coupled electron transfer and multi-phase reaction in the OER process (4OH−(aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) + 4e−) hinder the development of high-performance electrocatalysts.3 Usually, efficient electrocatalysts require high conductivity/mass transfer and abundant accessible active sites as well as faster interface reactions. More importantly, decreasing the free energy of the OER intermediates at the interface would remarkably enhance the inherent electrochemical performance of a catalyst.4 For developing practical electrocatalysts and comprehending the origin of their activity, both heterogeneous and homogeneous electrocatalysts have been developed with advanced results.5 Heterogeneous electrocatalysts take advantage of facile recovery but suffer from limited and indistinct active sites, especially in reaction environments;6 homogeneous electrocatalysts can utilize all active sites with identified structures but are limited by their difficult recovery.7
MOF materials as catalysts can combine the advantages of both homo- and heterogeneous catalysts. Unfortunately, most MOFs are insulating and are usually pyrolyzed to carbon or metal oxides to improve their electrical conductivity for electrocatalytic applications.8 However, this thermal treatment sacrifices the porous structures and intrinsic active metal sites of MOFs. Recently, MOFs with high electronic conductivity have emerged as new functional materials. In contrast with pyrolyzed MOF electrocatalysts, conductive metal–organic frameworks (C-MOFs) can be conveniently and directly utilized as electrocatalysts.9 Without the collapsed structures resulting from pyrolysis, C-MOFs provide the possibility to gain deep insight into the relationship between the structure and catalytic performance of MOFs. At present, MOFs prepared with triphenylene-derived ligands are the most studied C-MOFs. Triphenylene ligands have been used to feasibly devise planar pi-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) C-MOFs via the combination of “through-space” and “through-bond” strategies. The conductivity of the prepared 2D C-MOFs can be flexibly modulated from ∼10−6 to 4 × 101 S cm−1 by modifying the triphenylene ligands and using disparate metal ions for different application purposes.10 Very recently, this class of 2D C-MOFs has attracted considerable attention in the electrocatalytic field, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).11 Hexahydroxytriphenylene ligand-based 2D C-MOFs possess M–O4 (M, transition metals) as their secondary building units and provide discrete metal-replaceable layers as promising reactive sites for OER, in accordance with results from previous researchers.12 Moreover, these 2D C-MOFs can remain stable in high pH solution, which was observed in previous research and is quite important for OER. Due to their structures and stability, these C-MOFs are very desirable but have yet to be studied as OER electrocatalysts.
Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate triphenylene-based 2D C-MOF Ni–HHTP nanowire arrays on carbon cloth as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst (HHTP, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene). Ni–HHTP was directly in situ grown on the carbon cloth as nanowire arrays (NWAs) for OER tests. Additionally, the OER performance of the Ni–HHTP NWAs was significantly enhanced by substituting some Ni ions with Fe ions to create the catalyst FexNiy–HHTP NWAs. The Fe1Ni4–HHTP NWAs were studied and showed overpotentials of ∼213 and 300 mV at 10 and 150 mA cm−2, respectively, and excellent long-term stability in 1 M KOH. Control electrochemical experiments, Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, Mössbauer spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to reveal an unexpected “self-adaption active site” mechanism for this performance enhancement.
Results and discussion
Ni–HHTP NWAs were directly grown on carbon cloth by immersing the carbon cloth into a reaction solution of Ni2+ and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (see Fig. S1a† and the Experimental section for details). FexNiy–HHTP NWAs were synthesized by replacing some Ni ions with Fe ions in the above reaction. The feeding ratios of Fe/Ni were maintained at 0/1, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1, and 2/1. During the solvothermal process, the metal ions coordinate with the linkers through a co-crystallization process; then, FexNiy–HHTP MOF nanowires are formed (Fig. S1b†). The attempt to synthesize Fe–HHTP afforded an amorphous phase (Fig. S2†). The structure of Ni–HHTP comprises two distinct types of alternatively stacked layers in the trigonal space group Pc1 (Fig. 1a, b and d). In one layer, the metal atom is coordinated to two HHTP linkers and two water molecules to form 2D extended honeycomb-like structures, and the other layer contains discrete units constructed from one HHTP ligand, three Ni ions and twelve water molecules. The layers stack in an overlapped fashion with the HHTP molecules in each layer rotated 30° with respect to each other. A hexagonal array of 1D channels with diameters of 1.8 nm is thus formed. Among the FexNiy–HHTP-based electrocatalysts, Fe1Ni4–HHTP showed the best OER performance and thus was used as an example for detailed characterization (Fig. S3†). In the powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRDs), Fe1Ni4–HHTP possesses identical peak positions to Ni–HHTP, demonstrating that they are isostructural and that Fe doping has a slight influence on their unit cell parameters (Fig. 1c, S4 and S5†). The crystal structures of Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP were simulated based on their PXRDs by referring to a reported isostructural compound, Co-CAT.13 Conductivity measurements of Ni–HHTP in air with the powder pellet two-electrode method demonstrated its electron conducting nature, with a medium value of 3 × 10−3 S m−1 (Fig. S6†).14 N2 sorption measurements confirmed the porous structures of Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP, which possess a pore size of ∼1.8 nm (Fig. S7†). As shown in Fig. S8,† the blank carbon cloth (1 × 2 cm2) is gray and turns dark blue after being covered with Ni–HHTP or Fe1Ni4–HHTP NWAs. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging (Fig. S9†) shows the smooth surface of the blank carbon cloth fibers with 10 μm diameters. After preparation, numerous oriented nanowires with high density uniformly covered the whole fibers (Fig. S10† and 1e).

The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP (Fig. S11a, S12† and 1f) showed parallel-aligned channels in the nanowires; the spacing between two channels is close to 1.8 nm, suggesting that the preferred orientation is along (00l). The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image and the corresponding STEM-EDX map of a nanowire (Fig. S11b† and 1g) confirm the uniform distribution of Ni and O in Ni–HHTP as well as Ni, Fe and O in Fe1Ni4–HHTP. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis reveals that 6.9% Ni was substituted by Fe in the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowires (Table S1†). The EDS results are shown in Fig. S13 and S14.† It can be observed that the elemental ratio of Fe/Ni measured by ICP-OES is not identical to the feeding ratio. This may result from the fact that the Fe3+ ions do not coordinate with HHTP ligands as readily as Ni2+ ions; therefore, some of the Fe3+ ions will not participate in the coordination process, leading to metal–ligand mismatches.15 The XPS spectra (Fig. 1h and i) and Mössbauer spectra (Fig. 1j) demonstrate the presence of Ni2+ and Fe3+ states in the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowires. The Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 1h) show the characteristic spin–orbit peaks of Ni2+. The binding peak at around 856.4 eV (Ni 2p3/2) is attributed to the existence of Ni–oxygen bonds, and the peak at around 861.4 eV is the satellite of Ni 2p3/2. The binding peaks at approximately 874.1 and 880.2 eV are assigned to Ni 2p1/2 and its satellite peak, respectively. The Fe 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 1i) show a peak at around 712.1 eV (2p3/2), which is assigned to the Fe3+ oxidation state; the peak at 724.8 eV is attributed to 2p1/2.
The OER activity of the nanowire arrays was measured by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) in 1 M KOH (pH 14). As shown in Fig. 2a, the Ni–HHTP nanowire arrays acquired a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.61 V (Fig. S15†), corresponding to ∼380 mV overpotential. This further decreased to 213 mV after Fe doping, remarkably exceeding Ir/C (310 mV) as well as most recently reported MOF OER electrocatalysts (Table S2†). The additional peak at about 1.4 V is attributed to Ni2+ oxidation (confirmed by CV tests; see Fig. S16 and S17†), the positive shift of which is larger than that of Ni–HHTP; this implies that the incorporation of Fe suppresses the oxidation of Ni2+.16 The Tafel plot of Ni–HHTP (Fig. 2b) exhibited a slope of 106 mV dec−1. Upon doping with Fe, the slope decreased to 96 mV dec−1, reflecting the enhanced electrochemical kinetics and the transfer of the rate-determining step from M–OH formation to M–O formation.17 The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique revealed a four-electron pathway for water oxidation with 98.1% faradaic efficiency (FE) for O2 generation (Fig. 2c and S18†). The Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays showed remarkable stability, with only a 30 mV increase of potential after 10 h galvanostatic polarization at 30 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH (Fig. 2d and S19–S21†). The electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 2e) further displayed charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface of 1.29 Ω for the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays, which is much lower than that of Ni–HHTP (4.79 Ω); this indicates a better charge transfer process in the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays. Moreover, the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays showed much better OER activity than the powder sample (Fig. 2f), which can be partially attributed to the lower ohmic resistance and charge transfer resistance (inset in Fig. 2f). Inspired by the excellent OER performance of Fe1Ni4–HHTP, a two-electrode electrolyzer using the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays on carbon cloth as the anode and commercial Pt/C as the cathode was demonstrated to require low voltages of ∼1.48 V at 10 mA cm−2 current density and 1.68 V at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. S22†). The water electrolyzer powered by a single-cell AA battery (voltage ∼ 1.5 V) and a commercial solar cell was also demonstrated (ESI Movie 1 and Fig. S23†) to have long-term stability. To evaluate the influence of introducing Fe element, we firstly investigated the morphology and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) modulation after Fe doping. The similar nanowire array morphology and ECSA (Fig. S24†) of the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays to those of Ni–HHTP suggest that its superior OER activity is due to the enhancement of intrinsic active sites by Fe doping. Interestingly, we found that the Ni–HHTP electrode showed remarkably enhanced OER activity after being dipped in the Fe3+ solution for 1 min (η10 decreased by 110 mV) (Fig. S25†). This implies that the enhanced activity may originate from the Fe active sites which are located at the edges or the discrete layers of Ni–HHTP. To further identify the location of the Fe atoms in Ni–HHTP, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis were carried out.

Fig. 3a illustrates the XANES spectra of Fe1Ni4–HHTP and its reference samples at the Fe K-edge. It was observed that Fe1Ni4–HHTP and Fe2O3 have similar response signals around the near-edge, which is obviously different from the Fe foil and FeO samples; this again confirms the Mössbauer analysis results of Fe3+ in Fe1Ni4–HHTP. The Ni K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3b) showed that Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP had the same response signal around the near-edge (almost overlapping), indicating that introducing Fe did not alter the chemical structure of Ni2+ ion. Also, their signals resemble those of NiO, which is consistent with the XPS analysis results. The Fourier-transform EXAFS spectra in the R space and the best-fit analysis are summarized in Fig. 3c and d and S26 (details of the EXAFS fitting are shown in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3c and Table S3,† the dominant peak of Fe1Ni4–HHTP at 1.57 Å is very close to that of Fe2O3 (1.52 Å), indicating that Fe in Fe1Ni4–HHTP has the same [FeO6] octahedral coordination configuration as Fe2O3. Furthermore, the peak at 2.12 Å was assigned to Fe–C in Fe1Ni4–HHTP, manifesting that the Fe atoms in Fe1Ni4–HHTP were coordinated with the ligand HHTP in the discrete layer. Further fitting of the peak at 1.61 Å of Ni–O in Fig. 3d also demonstrates the formation of the [NiO6] octahedral configuration. Ni in Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP has nearly identical EXAFS spectra and fitting lines, suggesting that introducing Fe into Ni–HHTP does not affect the chemical environment of Ni in Ni–HHTP. However, the Ni–O distance (R = 2.05 Å) is larger than the Fe–O distance (R = 2.01 Å) in Fe1Ni4–HHTP, which may be caused by the larger radius and the weaker electrostatic attraction to negatively charged ligands of the Ni2+ ion compared with the Fe3+ ion in the environment of octahedral coordination.18 The above results together confirm that Fe atoms serving as active sites are coordinated with the ligand HHTP in the discrete layer of Fe1Ni4–HHTP. Furthermore, the extended π–π stacking structure of Fe1Ni4–HHTP benefits the electron transfer during the OER process.

The blue and red dashed lines in (c) and (d) are the corresponding fitting curves (R range of 1 to 3 Å). 
To further understand the detailed effects of the Fe sites in Fe1Ni4–HHTP, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the electronic structures, OH*, O*, OOH* adsorption free energies and variations of Gibbs free energy in the elementary steps of OER on Fe1Ni4–HHTP and Ni–HHTP models. The possible active sites of Fe and Ni in diverse sites in the MOF were evaluated and calculated. We concluded that Fe replacing Ni in discrete units with potential open metal sites should be the active sites, in line with the experimental results. Fig. 4a displays the primitive steps of the OER process on Fe1Ni4–HHTP and reveals an unusual self-adaptable property of the Fe active sites, which enables the OER intermediates to generate additional hydrogen bonds with neighboring layers. Fig. 4b reveals that the formation of O* requires the highest Gibbs free energy and becomes the rate-determining step (RDS) for OER. The Gibbs free energy for the RDS is 1.59 eV on Fe1Ni4–HHTP; this is lower than that on Ni–HHTP (1.76 eV), suggesting higher OER activity on the Fe sites than on the Ni sites. This corresponds with our experimental results, where Fe1Ni4–HHTP showed a much lower overpotential (210 mV at 10 mA cm−2) than Ni–HHTP (380 mV at 10 mA cm−2).19 To deeply understand this mechanism, further DFT and partial density of states (PDOS) calculations were investigated. Fig. 4c shows the partial densities of states (PDOS) of the intermediate O* and the Fe/Ni active sites in Fe1Ni4–HHTP and Ni–HHTP, respectively. The profile of the d orbitals for Fe in Fe1Ni4–HHTP clearly shows a greater overlap with that of the O* intermediate than that of Ni–HHTP.

Color scheme for chemical representation: blue for iron, green for nickel, red for oxygen, grey for carbon and white for hydrogen. (b) The free energy profiles for the OER pathway on the Fe1Ni4–HHTP and Ni–HHTP electrocatalysts, respectively. (c) Partial densities of states (PDOS) of O and Fe/Ni on the Fe1Ni4–HHTP and Ni–HHTP electrocatalysts, respectively. 
It was demonstrated that the Fe–O* interaction in Fe1Ni4–HHTP is stronger than the Ni–O* interaction in Ni–HHTP. Fig. S27† shows that the Fe d orbitals are more involved in LUMO formation and that there is more involvement of the t2g-like π* Fe–O* antibonding state than that of Ni–O*, which benefits the stabilization of the key intermediate O* on Fe1Ni4–HHTP. These findings illustrate that Fe sites have lower free energy in the OER process than Ni sites, leading to excellent OER activity; this is consistent with our experimental results and further confirms the predominant effect of the Fe active sites towards OER performance.
The simulated configurations of the initial state and three absorbed states (OH*, O*, and OOH* intermediates) of Fe1Ni4–HHTP and Ni–HHTP were compared. During the OER process on Fe1Ni4–HHTP (Fig. S28†), the relative distance between Fe and two neighboring layer Ni increases first (OH* absorbed), followed by a decrease (O* absorbed), and then increases again (OOH* absorbed), as listed in Table S4;† this demonstrates the self-adaptable position variation of Fe during OER. A similar phenomenon occurred in Ni–HHTP, but with more drastic variation (Fig. S29†). Upon further analysis, an additional hydrogen bond was found to form between the intermediates (OH* and OOH*) and the neighbor layer oxygen. Moreover, the stronger hydrogen bonds in the Fe1Ni4–HHTP case (1.73 and 1.66 Å) than in Ni–HHTP (2.21 and 1.67 Å) can benefit the stabilization of OH* and OOH* (Fig. S30 and S31†) and also correspond to the shorter distance from the Fe active site to neighbor Ni in Fe1Ni4–HHTP than in Ni–HHTP. These theoretical and experimental results clearly demonstrate that the self-adaptable position variance and additional hydrogen bonds both contribute to the stabilization of intermediates in the OER process, which is an efficacious way to develop high-performance catalysts.
Conclusions
In summary, an electronically conductive MOF, Ni–HHTP, was prepared with nanowire arrays and studied as an electrocatalyst for the first time. After replacing ∼6.9% Ni2+ in the structure with Fe3+, the electrocatalytic performance of the material significantly improved, showing overpotentials of ∼213 and 300 mV at 10 and 150 mA cm−2, respectively. More importantly, the impressive catalytic activity of Fe1Ni4–HHTP is attributed to doping of Fe active sites in the discrete layer as well as the nanostructures, porosity and good conductivity of Ni-based MOFs, as demonstrated by electrochemical tests, EXAFS and Mössbauer characterizations. DFT calculations suggest that the Fe active sites exhibit an unexpected self-adaptable structure adjustment, enabling the OER intermediates to generate additional hydrogen bonds with adjacent layers and thus decreasing the free energy in the OER process. This will provide a new strategy for MOF electrocatalyst design and investigation via a combination of metal active sites and conductive MOF platforms.
Experimental
Synthesis of FexNiy–HHTP nanowire arrays (x/y = 1/4, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1)
In a typical synthesis of Fe1Ni4–HHTP, ferrous acetate (0.01 mmol, 1.74 mg), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.04 mmol, 9.95 mg), and HHTP (0.03 mmol, 9.8 mg) were dispersed in 1.5 mL of a solvent mixture of water/DMF (v:v = 4:1) under sonication for 10 minutes in a 20 mL glass vial. A clean carbon cloth was immersed in the reaction solution, which was heated in an oven at 85 °C and then cooled to room temperature within 30 minutes. The length of the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire arrays was controlled by the reaction time. The Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire array-coated carbon cloth was collected and washed thoroughly with deionized water 5 times and then treated by freeze-drying overnight. Then, the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire array-coated carbon cloth was immersed in DI water in a capped vial at 85 °C for 4 h. The same procedure was repeated with the final immersion step for 15 h. Then, the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire array-coated carbon cloth was dried under vacuum at 85 °C for 12 h. Fe1Ni4–HHTP crystallite powder with an irregular morphology was collected at the bottom of the glass vial.
The FexNiy–HHTP nanowire arrays (x/y = 1/2, 1/1, 2/1) were synthesized by adopting similar procedures. For the preparation of Fe1Ni2–HHTP, Fe1Ni1–HHTP, and Fe2Ni1–HHTP, different initial molar ratios were used (the total mole number of metal ions was maintained at 0.05 mmol).
Synthesis of Ni–HHTP nanowire arrays
The Ni–HHTP nanowire arrays were synthesized as follows: nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.05 mmol, 12.4 mg) and HHTP (0.03 mmol, 9.8 mg) were dispersed in 1.5 mL of a solvent mixture of water/DMF (v:v = 4:1) under sonication for 10 minutes in a 20 mL glass vial. The rest of the procedure was the same as that for the synthesis of FexNiy–HHTP.
Synthesis of Fe–HHTP powder
Ferrous acetate (0.05 mmol, 8.7 mg) and HHTP (0.03 mmol, 9.8 mg) were dispersed in 1.5 mL of a solvent mixture of water/DMF (v:v = 4:1) under sonication for 10 minutes in a 20 mL glass vial. The rest of the procedure was the same as that for the synthesis of FexNiy–HHTP.
Characterization
The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S4800/Cryo) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyzer. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and HRTEM images were obtained by a JEM-2100F instrument at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The elements on the surfaces of our samples were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI 5000C ESCA) with a monochromic Al/Kα X-ray source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a MiniFlex II diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The specific surface areas were measured through N2 adsorption at 77 K using ASAP 2010 and calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The pore size distributions (PSD) were acquired based on the DFT (density functional theory) model.

X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were collected on the BL14B2 beam line at SPring-8 in transmission mode under ambient conditions with a Si (111) and Si (311) double crystal monochromator for the Fe K-edge and Ni K-edge, respectively. To achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio, the powdered samples were uniformly mixed with BN powder and pressed into pellets (with diameters of 7 mm) to ascertain the edge jump of about 1.0. A detuning of about 20% by misaligning the silicon crystals was also performed to suppress the high harmonic content.
The as-obtained XAFS data were firstly processed in Athena (version 0.9.25) for background, pre-edge line and post-edge line calibration. The Fourier transform analysis was conducted with the Artemis (0.9.25) program. The data for Fe foil and Ni foil were first fitted with a fixed coordination number to determine the amplitude reduction factor (S02 = 0.77 for Fe and S02 = 0.83 for Ni) for the fitting of other samples. The k range was set between 3 and 15 Å−1, and the R range was 1 to 3 Å. Independent CN and bond lengths were used for every shell, and the Debye–Waller factor and energy shift were shared for a dataset. A k weighting of 2 was used for all the fitting, and no parameters (CN, R, σ2, ΔE0) were fixed.
For wavelet transform analysis, the χ(κ) exported from Athena was imported into the Hama Fortran code. The parameters were as follows: R range, 1 to 3 Å, k range, 2 to 15 Å−1 and k weight, 2; also, a Morlet function with κ = 18, σ = 1 was used as the mother wavelet to provide the overall distribution.
The following equation was used to calculate and fit the RFD of Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP:  where r is the distance from the target to the neighboring atom, N is the coordination number of the neighboring atom, and σ2 is the Debye–Waller factor. The photoelectron wavenumber κ is given as , f(κ) is the scattering amplitude, and δ(κ) is the phase shift. S0 is the amplitude reduction factor. The EXAFS spectra of Ni–HHTP and Fe1Ni4–HHTP were fitted in the r range from 1.00 to 3.00 Å. The final values of these parameters are summarised in Table S3.†
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical setup using a computer-controlled electrochemistry workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instrument Inc.). A platinum wire electrode and an Ag/AgCl-saturated KCl electrode served as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a potential range from 0 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl for OER activity measurements, which were conducted in 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The potentials reported in this study are all quoted against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation E vs. RHE = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH. All polarization curves were corrected with 90% iR-compensation. The long-term stability of the electrocatalysts was measured by chronopotentiometry tests at 30 mA cm−2. We also conducted rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) experiments to determine the electron transfer numbers and Faraday efficiency. The electron transfer numbers were determined by applying a constant potential of 1.4 V (vs. RHE) to a ring electrode:  
The faradaic efficiency of the OER system was determined by applying a constant potential of 0.4 V (vs. RHE) to the ring electrode:  where Id, Ir, N and n are the disk current, ring current, collection efficiency and the number of electrons transferred per O2 molecule in ORR, respectively. Here, the value of N is taken to be 0.37.
Electrochemical capacitance was determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was performed over a potential window of −0.16 to −0.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl (open-circuit potential: −0.11 V) and scan rates ranging from 5 to 800 mV s−1. EIS was recorded under the following conditions: AC voltage amplitude 1.5 V vs. RHE, frequency range 106 to 0.1 Hz. The resistant values were the fits to the data using the simplified Randel's circuit. The conductivities of the MOF powder pellets were measured with a two-probe method using a Keithley 4200 instrument (Fig. S4†). The pellets of MOFs were pressed at a pressure of approximately 1 GPa. Electrical measurements were performed using a two-electrode setup in air at a constant temperature of 297 K and in the absence of light.
Water splitting devices and measurements
For the preparation of the water splitting electrodes, the Fe1Ni4–HHTP nanowire array on carbon cloth was directly used as the anode and the cathode was prepared by coating commercial Pt/C on 1 cm2 carbon cloth with a loading of 1 mg cm−2. The water electrolysis could be powered by a single-cell AA battery (voltage ∼ 1.5 V). This was demonstrated by coupling a commercial planar polycrystalline Si solar cell with a two-electrode water electrolyzer setup for the direct utilization of solar energy in water splitting. The Si solar cell with geometric dimensions of 14.6 cm2 presented a short circuit current density of 5 mA cm−2 and an open circuit potential of 2.0 V.
DFT calculations
The electronic structures of all the catalysts were computed using the Dmol3 package.20,21 All calculations were performed with the PBE exchange–correlation functional (the 1996 functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof) on periodically repeated slabs.22 The double-numeric quality basis set with polarization functions (DNP) was adopted.23,24 Numerical basis sets can minimise the basis-set superposition error.25 A Fermi smearing of 0.005 hartree was utilized. The tolerances of the energy, gradient and displacement convergence were 1 × 10−5 hartree, 2 × 10−3 hartree per Å, and 5 × 10−3 Å, respectively. We used one ABA–Fe cluster and ABA–Ni cluster. One discrete layer (B) with numerous coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms was sandwiched by two extended layers to form the ABA cluster. All structures were fully relaxed to the ground state.
Microkinetic analysis
The microkinetic process of the water-splitting reaction was modeled with the approach used by Nørskov and coworkers,26–28 which has been recently applied to two-dimensional phosphorus porous polymorphs,29 graphitic carbon nitride-supported single-atom catalysts30 and carbon nitride monolayers.31 The two half-reaction equations, i.e. OER and HER, are listed below: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(1) 4H+ + 4e− → H2(2)
For OER, eqn (1) is decomposed into four one-electron steps, (OER-1) to (OER-4), where each step generates one H+ and an electron, as listed below: * + H2O(l) → OH* + (H+ + e−)(OER-1) OH* → O* + (H+ + e−)(OER-2) O* + H2O(l) → OOH* + (H+ + e−)(OER-3) OOH*− → O2 + * + (H+ + e−)(OER-4)
The Gibbs free energy change (ΔGi) of each reaction step can be described asΔGi = ΔEi + ΔZPEi + TΔSi + ΔGu + ΔGpHwhere ΔEi represents the DFT-calculated reaction energy, ΔZPEi refers to the zero point energy change, T is the temperature, ΔSi is the entropy change, ΔGu = −eU (where U is the potential of the photogenerated electrons/holes with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and ΔGpH = 2.303kBT × pH (where kB is the Boltzmann constant). The entropies of the free molecules were taken from the NIST database (http://cccbdb.nist.gov/), and the energy contribution from the configuration entropy in the adsorbed state was not included. As a generally accepted OER activity descriptor, the overpotential (η) for a chemical reaction can be calculated as follows:η = max[ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4]/e − 1.23[v]
This is independent of pH and is therefore applicable to water–alkali conditions.
