, Accepted 8th March 2016First published on 11th March 2016AbstractA novel, solution-processable non-fullerene electron acceptor, 6,6′-((9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione) (coded as N7), based on central carbazole and terminal diketopyrrolopyrrole building blocks was designed, synthesized and characterized. N7 displayed excellent solubility, thanks to its design allowing incorporation of numerous lipophilic chains, thermal stability, and afforded a 2.30% power conversion efficiency with a high open-circuit voltage (1.17 V) when tested with the conventional donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) in solution-processable bulk-heterojunction devices. To our knowledge, not only is N7 the first reported chromophore based on carbazole and diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalities but the open-circuit voltage reported here is among the highest values for a single junction bulk-heterojunction device that has been fabricated using a simple device architecture, with reproducible outcomes and with no special treatment.
Introduction
The development of renewable energy resources is one of mankind's long standing desires to fulfil the energy needs of modern society. It can be dated back to Becquerel's 1839 work when he observed the photovoltaic effect while studying liquid electrolytes.1 However, Tang's 1989 work2 instigated a momentum that organic solar cells can in fact be a reality in the near future. Since then many approaches have been investigated for harvesting solar energy. Among them organic, or otherwise termed as bulk-heterojunction, solar cells3 and dye-sensitized solar cells4 are the most studied strategies. In regards to bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices, two types of developments have attracted considerable attention over the past two decades; one being the design and development of novel materials and other is the development and improvement of device fabrication strategies. Both of these developments are equally important given the fact that BHJ devices promise multiple advantages such as light weight, low cost and flexibility.5–7
Typically, BHJ devices are an interwoven network of organic donor and acceptor domains which are formed during device fabrication via solution processing. Conventionally, semiconducting donor polymers, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and acceptors, such as solvent-dissolvable fullerene derivatives, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its C71 analogue (PC71BM), have been used to acquire an understanding of material design and device morphology.5–7 As a result, conjugated polymers and small molecules as alternative donors, and non-fullerene functionalities as alternate acceptors have been developed over time. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded or approached 10% with the use of polymeric and small molecular donors with fullerene acceptors, respectively.8,9 The latter are the choice of dominant acceptors as they provide high electron mobility, large electron affinity, excellent solubility and an ability to form a favourable nanoscale network with versatile donor semiconducting components.10 Even though the fullerenes are favourable accepting counterparts, they are afflicted with a number of potential disadvantages such as restricted electronic tuning via structural modification and weak absorption in the visible spectrum. Moreover, a large electron affinity can result in low open-circuit voltage (Voc).11 Such disadvantages with fullerenes provide a strong incentive that research must be carried on the design and development of non-fullerene acceptors which can exert efficient absorption over visible spectrum, excellent solubility, high charge carrier mobility and matching energy levels with those of potential donors.
In recent years, the study of design and development of non-fullerene acceptors has gone through something of a renaissance. Reviews by Sonar et al. and Lin et al. highlight the key examples of their development,12,13 and recent reports from Hwang et al. and Zhong et al., along with others, demonstrated over 8% PCEs with the use of low-band gap polymer donors.14–23 We have also seen significant changes in our understanding of the area which has led to major advances in our ability to control and predict the outcome of a thoughtfully designed chromophore.24–26 Although the efforts exerted by various research groups in the development of non-fullerene acceptors are appreciative and tireless, one must consider their principal suitability with easily synthesizable and scalable or commercially available donors in order to make these acceptors viable for practical applications. Such requirements indeed pose a substantial challenge to an organic chemist who must think in advance to devise a strategy not only to draw potential structures on plain paper but also to synthesize them in an efficient and timely manner. The design of most efficient non-fullerene acceptors teaches us that the target chromophore must be highly conjugated through a combination of donor and acceptor building blocks. We, and others, have been successful in demonstrating this strategy via designing a number of potential electron acceptors where such materials have manifested promising device performance.14–26 We realised that functionalities such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and naphthalenediimide (NDI) are great allies when used as terminal acceptors in conjunction with central conjugated blocks.24,27,28
The use of DPP in particular provides higher Voc, allows tuning of solubility via incorporating lipophilic chains on nitrogen atoms, demonstrates good thermal and chemical stability at molecular level and generates a target with facile and easily scalable synthetic protocols. Such advantages are likely responsible for spurring an intensified interest in designing of chromophores based on terminal DPP-units and are an inspiration to pursue research on the development of new electron acceptors based on DPP functionality. Fig. 1 provides an overview of recent research where target chromophores have been developed based on terminal DPPs along with central conjugated units. Fig. 1 further demonstrates our current work where we have designed a new target chromophore based on terminal DPPs and central carbazole (CBZ) functionality.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of current and literature reported non-fullerene acceptors comprising central conjugated functionalities and terminal DPP-units. 
Herein we report the synthesis, detailed theoretical calculations and characterization of the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of a novel small molecule, non-fullerene electron acceptor, 6,6′-((9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione) (coded as N7), which was envisioned based on the connection of CBZ and DPP functionalities. N7 turned out a highly conjugated chromophore with high chemical and thermal stability, and with excellent solubility. We were able to demonstrate that N7, when blended with P3HT in solution-processable BHJ solar cells, can deliver promising PCE, and the BHJ devices based on a combination of CBZ and DPP building blocks perform better than the devices based on either fluorine:DPP24 or dibenzosilole:DPP29 combinations. Solution-processable BHJ devices based on the blend of P3HT:N7 (1:1.2 w/w) exhibited PCEs as high as 2.30% with a high Voc of 1.17 V; and the Voc > 1.15 V is among the highest values reported for solution-processed fullerene-free small molecular organic solar cells. To our knowledge, there are no reports on the connected use of CBZ and DPP functionalities to generate a non-fullerene acceptor for solution-processable BHJ devices. It is vital to mention that we are highly interested to develop novel materials for organic electronics, organic solar cells in particular, and the present work is a continuation of our efforts on the design and development of small molecular chromophores for such applications.30–33

Design and synthesis
N7 was successfully synthesized in 61% yield via one step Suzuki coupling reaction between commercially available bis-boronic acid pinacol ester derivative of CBZ, 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole and 3-(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(thien-2-yl)pyrrolo-[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] as catalyst (Scheme 1). N7 was fully characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques. As expected, N7 was found to be highly soluble in a variety of common laboratory solvents such as dichloromethane, dichlorobenzene and chloroform; for instance 22 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene and 20 mg mL−1 in chloroform. High solubility of organic semiconducting chromophores is desirable for laboratory and industrial applications, and N7 fulfils this criterion.

The resulting solution was stirred under nitrogen blanketing for 20 min followed by the addition of 3-(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(thien-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (0.56 mmol, 338 mg) at room temperature. The yellow coloured reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 18 h, cooled down and diluted with ethyl acetate (15.0 mL) and water (25.0 mL). The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the organic layer was separated. Solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified through silica gel chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate 9.5:0.5) to get 271 mg (61%) of N7 as a bluish-black powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 9.12–9.03 (m, 2H), 8.90–8.89 (m, 2H), 8.14–8.10 (m, 2H), 7.86 (s, 1H), 7.67 (s, 1H), 7.63–7.62 (m, 2H), 7.61–7.54 (m, 4H), 7.29–7.27 (m, 2H), 4.67–4.60 (m, 1H), 4.17–4.02 (m, 8H), 2.39–2.31 (m, 2H), 2.05–1.96 (m, 4H), 1.93–1.85 (m, 2H), 1.49–1.04 (m, 56H), 1.00–0.83 (m, 24H), 0.79–0.77 (m, 6H); 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3) δ 162.02, 161.82, 151.36, 143.29, 140.54, 139.95, 137.55, 137.35, 131.39, 130.91, 130.48, 130.11, 124.29, 122.95, 121.39, 121.15, 109.19, 108.34, 108.08, 106.52, 56.95, 46.07, 39.27, 34.03, 31.87, 30.52, 30.38, 29.52, 29.43, 29.27, 28.52, 26.96, 23.73, 23.23, 22.71, 14.18, 10.67; HRMS (MALDI-TOF): m/z: calculated for C89H119N5O4S4: 1449.81394 [M]+; found 1449.81396.

Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the normalized spectra of optical absorption of N7 in chloroform solution (1.72 × 10−5 M) and in thin solid films. N7 in solution exhibits strong absorption with the maximum extinction coefficient of 79870 M−1 cm−1 at 599 nm. A thin film of N7 shows significant absorption throughout the visible region (350–700 nm) with three peaks at 400, 580 and 615 nm, and the maximum peak red shifts 13 nm relative to that in solution. The optical band gap estimated from the absorption edge (680 nm using tangent method) of the thin film is 1.82 eV. The blend film absorption using a combination of CBZ/DPP indicated slight red shift when compared with either fluorene/DPP24 or dibenzosilole/DPP29 combinations, thus suggesting that there is an efficient charge transfer transition between donor and acceptor domains.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs34 and the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory indicated that orbital densities are evenly distributed over the whole molecular backbone, a recent finding that is fairly usual with small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors24,25 (Fig. 3). DFT calculations further indicated that dipole moment in case of N7 (2.4930 Debye; field-independent basis) was larger than the dipole moment of fluorene/DPP combination (1.1862 Debye), thus indicating the suitability of CBZ:DPP combination in terms of efficient intramolecular charge transfer transition. Furthermore, the torsional angle between the two thiophene ring planes and carbazole plane was found to be ∼25.8°, thus giving N7 a non-planar structure overall (Fig. 4). The non-planarity in small molecular non-fullerene acceptors may be considered vital over their planar counterparts as is demonstrated by S. Holliday et al.14 and H. Patil et al.26 The theoretical optical absorption transition of N7 is also shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) which corroborates our experimental finding.

As such, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated using a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and UV-Vis spectroscopy on thin films. The repetitive analyses of HOMO energy levels using pristine and blend films indicated that the average HOMO level resides around −5.56 eV. The LUMO energy level was calculated using absorption onset (680 nm) of thin film of N7. The optical band gap of N7 matched the literature reports based on the combinations of either fluorene/DPP24 or dibenzosilole/DPP.29 This, again, is a confirmation that DPP-bound chromophores can indeed guarantee high Voc of BHJ devices (Fig. 5 for energy level diagram and Fig. S4 (ESI†) for PESA curve).

Furthermore, N7 was tested for its thermal stability so that it can bear rigid device fabricating conditions such as device annealing at a higher temperature (e.g. >100 °C). We conducted thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and observed that N7 indeed is a thermally stable chromophore, hence can endure annealing conditions at a higher temperature (Fig. 6 for TGA curve).

Once it was established that N7 displayed promising optoelectronic properties and is a potential acceptor with energy levels matching with those of the classical electron donor P3HT, solution-processable BHJ devices were fabricated. The BHJ device architecture used was indium-tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, 38 nm)/active layer (∼62 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) where the active layer was a 1:1.2 blend of P3HT:N7, respectively, spin-cast from o-dichlorobenzene on top of the PEDOT:PSS surface. It is vital to mention that we chose a simple device architecture to start with and to observe initial performance, stability, fabricating conditions and reproducibility of BHJ devices. Regarding the fabrication of small molecular non-fullerene acceptors, it is well established that thermal annealing of devices and use of high boiling solvent is preferred for optimal performance and to avoid formation of large-scale crystals on active surfaces, respectively. This principle was demonstrated by Kim et al.,35 Lin et al.36 and Patil et al.37 Based on the literature findings and our own understanding of the BHJ device architecture we used o-dichlorobenzene as the processing solvent and annealed our active blend surfaces at 120 °C for 5 min. The optimized donor:acceptor weight ratio was found to be 1:1.2 where the BHJ device gave encouraging performance. The photovoltaic cell parameters; Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE, reached 1.17 V, 3.16 mA cm−2, 0.62, and 2.30%, respectively. All the fabricated devices yielded very high Voc, a finding that is consistent with the measured optical band gaps between the LUMO of N7 and the HOMO of P3HT. Voc approaching 1.20 V is among the highest voltages displayed by any DPP-based small molecular acceptor and is in fact amongst the highest for single-junction solution-processable BHJ devices. In contrast, the maximum PCE, Voc, and Jsc reached 3.15%, 0.61 V and 8.46 mA cm−2, respectively, for a device based on P3HT:PC61BM combination when fabricated under similar conditions, thus suggesting the reliability of our device strategy (Fig. S5, ESI†). Although the PCE values with the use of non-fullerene acceptors are surging, the DPP-based acceptors still linger in molecular design and device efficacy. Having said this, the PCE value reported here is among the top values reported in the literature for DDP-based chromophores, thereby providing strong support and incentive for the current research strategy. Representative current–voltage (J–V) curve is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage curve for the best device based on P3HT and N7 (1:1.2 w/w) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2). Device structure was: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layer was ∼62 nm thick. 
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement of the blended film with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.2 is shown in Fig. 8. The blended film of best photovoltaic device showed broad IPCE spectrum ranging from 300 to 700 nm, typically over the entire visible region, with an IPCE maximum of ∼17% at 610 nm. Despite its moderate IPCE value, the broadness of this spectrum alludes that N7 can be matched as an electron acceptor with a variety of electron donors, such as conjugated polymers and small molecules, in order to achieve charge generation over a broad range of wavelengths.
 Fig. 8  IPCE spectrum of the best performing device described in Fig. 7. 
The physical microstructure of the blend surface was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. The actual surface morphology of the blend film of P3HT:N7 (1:1.2 w/w) is shown in Fig. 9. The active surface appears as a fine blend of donor and acceptor domains with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.5 nm. Such an interpenetrating network of donor/acceptor components can be beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge-carrier transport, and can result in enhanced efficiency of photovoltaic devices.5,6 The physical appearance of the blend surface was noted as being even and regular, and free from perceptible projections, lumps, or indentations. Clearly, the physical appearance matched the factual surface morphology and corroborated the fact that high boiling solvents are preferable over low-boiling solvents such as chloroform. The chloroform blend film didn't show any nanoscale phase-separation and the surface roughness was too high (RMS roughness = 5.6 nm), which is disadvantageous for photovoltaic devices. Having said this, our attempts of fabrication using chloroform as a processing solvent resulted in very poor device results, which is attributed to either low film quality or an irregular intermixing of donor/acceptor components, thus verifying our AFM analysis and the literature principles.35–37

Though the research for non-fullerene electron acceptors is ever increasing, this work clearly demonstrates the possibility of achieving promising PCE in terms of material design, synthetic methodology and device efficacy. It further demonstrates that how crucial it is to carefully select a right building block not only to match with a suitable counterpart but also to achieve the desired optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties.
Conclusions
In summary, we have been successful to creating a small-molecular non-fullerene acceptor which was thoughtfully designed, synthesized and showed promising optoelectronic properties. Solution-processable BHJ devices displayed a propitious outcome, which is paramount for the advancement of research of non-fullerene acceptors. This work achieved one of the best efficiency outcomes with a very high Voc of non-fullerene DPP-based electron acceptors and has provided an opportunity for judicious selection of various donor and acceptor building blocks for their union to seek high device performance.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures of current and literature reported non-fullerene acceptors comprising central conjugated functionalities and terminal DPP-units.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic route to N7. Reagents and conditions: Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, Cs2CO3, inert atmosphere, 18 h, reflux; yield = 61%.	 

 	Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorption spectra of N7 in chloroform solution (N7 S; solid black curve), as a pristine as-casted film (N7 F; dashed black curve) and as a blend with P3HT [1:1.2 P3HT:N7 (N7 B; solid red curve)].	 

 	Fig. 3  Orbital density distribution for frontier molecular orbitals of N7. Density functional theory calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs and the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.	 

 	Fig. 4  Torsional angle of 154.2° or 25.8° between the two wings (from thiophene to the end) and the central CBZ block of N7 from the minimum energy conformations calculated using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs and the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.	 

 	Fig. 5  Energy level diagram showing alignments of different components of BHJ device architecture.	 

 	Fig. 6  TGA trace of N7 under nitrogen atmosphere. Heating rate: 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C.	 

 	Fig. 7  Current–voltage curve for the best device based on P3HT and N7 (1:1.2 w/w) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2). Device structure was: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layer was ∼62 nm thick.	 

 	Fig. 8  IPCE spectrum of the best performing device described in Fig. 7.	 

 	Fig. 9  AFM image of the P3HT:N7 blend film annealed at 120 °C for 5 min (15 mg P3HT and 18 mg N7 in 1 mL each of o-dichlorobenzene (upper) and chloroform (lower); film formation at 2500 rpm).
