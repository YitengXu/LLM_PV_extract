    , Accepted 1st September 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractA series of porphyrin sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been systematically investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The effects of π-bridge length, heteroaromatic unit, longitudinal conjugation, and relative position of functionalized groups on the optical and electrical properties are elucidated by analyzing the geometry, electronic structure, electron excitation, spectrum, photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer (IET), and light-harvesting efficiency (LHE). Our results show that the increase in π-bridge length by the addition of phenyl groups distances the electron distribution of LUMO away from the anchoring group and sharply decreases the effective electron excitation at the long wavelength region. The introduction of heteroaromatics in the π-bridge, especially electron-deficient units, stabilizes LUMO levels and improves the light-harvesting capability and donor-to-acceptor IET characteristics significantly. The extension of longitudinal π-conjugation in the π-bridge broadens the B band and slightly strengthens and redshifts the Q band but results in undesired orbital overlap. Repositioning the phenyl/thiophene group away from carboxylic acid increases the energy gap but leads to more effective long-range IET processes with more electrons, longer distance, lower orbital overlap, and moderate transfer rate. Our results highlight the significant effect of the functionalized π-bridge on porphyrin sensitizers, and provide a new insight into the design and screening of sensitizers for DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a potential cost-efficient photoelectric conversion device for green energy resource, have attracted wide attention over the past two decades.1–6 The sensitizer, which is usually adsorbed on a semiconductor electrode, plays a crucial role in light harvesting by pumping electrons from the lower ground state to higher excited state energy levels, and thus generating electric potential differences. High-performance DSSCs can be achieved by suitable molecular engineering of sensitizers.7–10 At present, Ru(II)-based sensitizers exhibit high photon-to-electron power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 12%;4 however, the high cost, limited availability and environmental issues associated with ruthenium constrain the extensive application of such sensitizers.11,12 Comparatively, organic sensitizers are advantageous given their low cost, high molar extinction coefficient, good flexibility, and environmental compatibility.5,13–15 Among these sensitizers, porphyrin chromophores are perceived to be among the most promising candidates for panchromatic absorption due to the outstanding capability to capture solar energy in the visible region, as well as their structural similarity to chlorophyll in natural photosynthetic systems.12,16,17
Porphyrin-based sensitizers typically adopt the structure of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A), which facilitates molecular tailoring and enriches the diversity of porphyrin sensitizers.18–21 DSSC performance has progressed remarkably with such sensitizers via appropriate molecular engineering on donor,8,22–28 π-bridge,10,16,17,29–32 and acceptor18,20,33,34 subunits. The π-bridge, affecting the electronic coupling between the Zn–porphyrin donor and the anchoring acceptor, is crucial to charge separation and electron injection after photoexcitation. Yeh and Diau et al. synthesized porphyrins YD11–YD13 that bear benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene rings with extra longitudinal conjugation as π-bridges. These researchers obtained an overall PCE (η = 6.7%) for YD12 relative to that for N719 (η = 6.1%).16 Integrating alkyl-thiophene with benzothiadiazole (BTD), 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenylethynyl, diketopyrrolopyrrole, and thiophene (Th) into the π-bridges in porphyrin sensitizers generated PCEs in the range of 4.6–8.7%.12,35–39 In early 2014, Grätzel et al. broadened the absorption spectra of Zn–porphyrin sensitizers to fill the valley between the Soret (B) and Q bands by inserting electron-deficient 2,1,3-BTD as the π-bridge in GY50. These researchers achieved a high PCE of 12.75%, thereby highlighting the effect of the phenyl (Ph) group on efficient prohibition of electron recombination.10 Very recently, a porphyrin-sensitized solar cell with an overall PCE of 13.0% was generated with the sensitizer SM315,40 in which one more Ph group was introduced into the π-bridge relative to SM371. In short, extensive experimental efforts were devoted to boost the PCEs of DSSCs. However, the intrinsic mechanisms of the effect of π-bridges on the photon-to-electron conversion performance of porphyrin sensitizers, including the electronic structure, electron excitation and absorption spectra, photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer rate, electron transfer distance and quantity, recombination, etc., remain unclear and urgently need to be addressed.
In the current work, a series of porphyrin sensitizers are designed on the basis of reference sensitizers SM315 and SM371 with a prototypical D–π–A structure in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution by the DFT and TD-DFT approach. The effects of π-bridges with different functionalized groups on the performance of porphyrin sensitizers are evaluated. Molecular geometry, electronic structure, the characteristics of absorption spectra, electron transfer process, light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), and photo-induced IET performance are analyzed in detail. This work provides not only a comprehensive overview of the general rule regarding the effect of functionalized π-bridge groups on porphyrin sensitizers, but also an effective strategy for the design and screening of high-performance porphyrin sensitizers for DSSCs.
2. Computational details
The geometrical optimizations for all porphyrin sensitizers were carried out by using the B3LYP exchange correlation functional41,42 in conjunction with the 6-31G(d)43 basis set in THF solution. The frequency analysis was then performed to confirm the nature of each ground-state geometry at the same levels. The standard hybrid functional B3LYP, long-range corrected functionals Cam-B3LYP44–46 and PBE0,47,48 and the meta-hybrid xc-functional M06 (27% of exact exchange)49 were used to evaluate the optical properties and photo-induced IET properties. The vertical excitation energy was efficiently calculated by the corresponding TD-DFT methods.50–52 The first 30 excited singlet states were taken into account in the calculations of the absorption spectra. Considering that the THF solvent is used in the relevant experimental absorption measurements, the real THF environment for porphyrin sensitizers was simulated by the nonequilibrium53 implementation of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).54–56 All calculations were accomplished with the Gaussian 09 program package.57
According to Marcus theory, the IET rate kET is determined by the reorganization energy (λ), the electronic coupling constant (Vab), and the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°).58 The IET rate kET is given as (1)where ℏ, kB, and T represent the Planck constant, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. The reorganization energy reflects the geometry relaxation in the involved donor and acceptor when their electronic state changes; the electronic coupling reflects the overlap of the wave functions between two charge-localized states.59 As a self-exchange process, the standard Gibbs free energy change before and after the IET process is considered as zero (ΔG° = 0).60,61 The inner-sphere reorganization energy (λv)60,62,63 describes the geometry changes of the donor and acceptor in the electron transfer process,64,65 which is evaluated by Nelson's four-point method:62,66 λv = E+* − E+ + E* − E(2)where E+* and E+ are the energy of the cationic donor (D+) at the neutral-state and optimal cationic-state geometry, and accordingly, E* and E are the energy of the neutral acceptor (A) at the cationic-state and optimized neutral-state geometry, respectively.63,67,68 In the calculations, the sensitizers are not explicitly split into D+ and A but are considered as a whole.60,69,70 The generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) method connected the dipole moments and vertical transition energy is employed to estimate the value of electronic coupling and all data can be read from the Gaussian output files:69,71 (3)where μab, ΔEab, and Δμab are the transition dipole moment, the vertical excitation energy, and the dipole moment difference between the initial and final adiabatic states, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
In the following, the accuracy of the chosen computational methods is first calibrated. Then, the molecular geometry of porphyrin sensitizers, the molecular orbitals and electronic structure, the properties of electron excitation and absorption spectra are analyzed. Next, the relation between structural optimization and LHE performance is discussed. Finally, the photo-induced IET properties are elucidated.
3.1 Calibration
To calibrate the accuracy of the chosen methods, the results calculated with different functionals are compared with both experimental and theoretical data.40 Fig. S1 (ESI†) presents the simulated UV-Vis absorption spectra of sensitizers SM315 and SM37140 obtained with four functionals in THF solution. The spectra obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional leads to a blue shift throughout the spectral coverage. The absorption peaks are detected at ∼380/413/546/614 nm for SM315 and at ∼405/599 nm for SM371; these values are approximately 40 nm smaller than the reference experimental values of 454/668 nm and 447/646 nm, respectively.40 Given the B3LYP, PBE0, and M06 functionals, the calculated locations of the absorption peak are at ∼431/763, ∼417/709 and ∼418/699 nm for SM315 and at ∼433/699, ∼424/662 and ∼431/658 nm for SM371. Obviously, the spectral data obtained with M06 match considerably better with the experimental values than those obtained with other functionals.
On the other hand, the first vertical excitation energies of SM315 and SM371 calculated with four functionals are ordered as follows: 1.62 eV (B3LYP) < 1.74 eV (PBE0) < 1.77 eV (M06) < 2.02 eV (CAM-B3LYP) and 1.78 eV (B3LYP) < 1.87 eV (PBE0) < 1.88 eV (M06) < 2.07 eV (CAM-B3LYP). The M06 functional provides the closest results on the crucial electron excitations given the experimental values of 1.86 eV for SM315 and 1.92 eV for SM371, respectively.40 Considering both absorption spectra and electron excitations, the agreement of the M06 results with the experimental data demonstrates the reliability of the method and the level of theory. Therefore, the results of M06/6-31G(d) are referenced in the discussion unless otherwise stated.
3.2 Molecular geometry
The molecular geometries of porphyrin sensitizers are illustrated in Fig. 1. Given the structure of reference sensitizers SM315 and SM371, each newly designed porphyrin sensitizer is constructed with a Zn–porphyrin core, a bulky bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine as a donor, and carboxylic acid as an anchoring group.40 These components are linked by various combinations of Ph, Th, acenes and BTD as a π-bridge. To balance accuracy and efficiency, the long alkoxy chains of hexyloxy and octyloxy in porphyrin sensitizers are replaced by the methoxy groups at the ortho and para positions of each meso-phenyl ring and the bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine donor. These substitutions are previously proven to have minor effects on the optical properties.14,46

The structural design is based on the following considerations: (1) adding 1–2 more π-conjugated Ph units in the π-bridge subunit32,72 of SM371 (labeled as L-2Ph and L-3Ph) to estimate the effect of π-bridge length; (2) introducing 1–3 electron-rich Th and electron-deficient BTD as π-bridge linkers (labeled as H-1Th–H-3Th and H-1BTD–H-3BTD, respectively)10,12,29,30 to evaluate the effect of heteroaromatics as well as the π-bridge length; (3) substituting acene for Ph linkers (SM371 → C-1A, C-2A) to clarify the longitudinal π-conjugation effect;16,17 and (4) replacing a Ph unit with Th (SM315 → P-(BTD)Th) and rearranging the order of units in a π-bridge subunit (SM315 → P-Ph(BTD) and P-(BTD)Th → P-Th(BTD)) to determine the position effect.19
3.3 Molecular orbital and electronic structure
Crucial electron excitations mainly occur from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs); therefore, efficient charge-separated states must be formed with the HOMOs localized on the donor subunit and the LUMOs on the acceptor subunit.7,46Fig. 2 shows the first three molecular orbital energies and the HOMO–LUMO gaps of porphyrin sensitizers. In consideration of the similarities, L-2Ph, H-2Th, H-2BTD, C-2A, and P-(BTD)Th are chosen to exhibit the electron contributions of the first three highest HOMOs and of the lowest LUMOs together with SM371 and SM315, as depicted in Fig. 3. The results of other sensitizers are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and Table S1 (ESI†) lists the corresponding energy levels of porphyrin sensitizers. As seen in Fig. 3, all of the electron distributions in HOMO−2 of porphyrin sensitizers originate from the Zn–porphyrin core, and those in the HOMO−1 and HOMO mainly originate from the bulky bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine group40 and the Zn–porphyrin core. The alteration of π-bridge linkers exerts little effect on the HOMOs (except for P-Ph(BTD)), in good agreement with the results obtained by Grätzel et al.40 Therefore, much attention is paid to the changes in electron contribution to LUMOs as a result of π-bridge modification.

 Fig. 3  The first three frontier molecular orbitals of SM315, SM371, L-2Ph, H-2Th, H-2BTD, C-2A, and P-(BTD)Th. Isodensity contour = 0.02. 
For Ph-bridged porphyrin sensitizers SM371, L-2Ph and L-3Ph, as indicated in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the electron distribution in LUMO+2 is primarily observed on the functionalized bridges and the associated carboxylic acid anchoring group. The distribution at these locations is conducive to the electron injection from the porphyrin sensitizers to the semiconductor surface. The LUMO+1 of these three sensitizers is completely derived from the Zn–porphyrin core, indicating that LUMO+1 cannot generate an effective charge-separated state but can aggravate electron recombination. For LUMO, with an increase in bridge length (SM371 → L-2Ph → L-3Ph), the electron distribution is gradually distanced from the anchoring group. Therefore, charge separation efficiency decreases sharply. In addition, the HOMO–LUMO gap increases with an increase of Ph groups in the π-bridge linker as a result of the rise in LUMO energy level, as shown in Fig. 2. A long π-bridge length increases the energy gap; thus, more excitation energy is required to form a charge-separated state from SM371 (2.166 eV) to L-2Ph (2.206 eV) and L-3Ph (2.219 eV). This agrees well with the previous findings for phenylacetylene-bridged porphyrin sensitizers.32
Substituting Ph with 1–3 electron-rich Th and electron-deficient BTD as π-bridge linkers (SM371 → H-1Th–H-3Th and H-1BTD–H-3BTD) lowers LUMO levels considerably and thus reduces energy gaps, similar to the theoretical results obtained for pyrene-conjugated porphyrin sensitizers LW17 and LW18.12 The energy gap decreases in the following sequence for Th- and BTD-bridged porphyrin sensitizers: 2.109 eV (H-1Th) > 2.081 eV (H-2Th) > 2.071 eV (H-3Th) and 1.805 eV (H-1BTD) > 1.721 eV (H-2BTD) > 1.694 eV (H-3BTD). The shapes of the first three LUMOs of H-1Th–H-3Th are similar to those of SM371, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). Unlike SM371 and H-1Th–H-3Th, the electron distribution of LUMO and LUMO+1 in H-1BTD–H-3BTD is mainly observed on the π-bridge and the anchoring group. The electron distribution of LUMO+2 locates gradually close to the carboxylic acid group from H-1BTD to H-3BTD. Changes in both energy gap and electron distribution originate from the difference in electronic characteristics between Ph and Th/BTD groups in a π-bridge. These changes facilitate electron excitation and charge separation, and efficient electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of a semiconductor.
Extending the longitudinal π-conjugation with naphthalene and anthracene (SM371 → C-2A, C-3A) stabilizes LUMO levels and reduces the energy gap from 2.166 to 2.147 and 2.087 eV, as with the acene-modified porphyrins YD11–YD13 and LAC-1–LAC-5.16,17 The electron contributions of LUMO and LUMO+2 are broadened to naphthalene and anthracene with the same orbital compositions (Zn–porphyrin core and anchoring group) as those in SM371. For LUMO+1 in acene-bridged porphyrin sensitizers, the charge separation efficiency would sharply drop since no excited electron can efficiently reach the carboxylic acid.
When the Ph group is repositioned at a distance from carboxylic acid, SM315 → P-Ph(BTD), not only does LUMO level increase but HOMO level stabilizes as well. Thus, the energy gap is increased to 2.306 eV. A similar trend is observed when the electron-rich Th is repositioned at a distance from the carboxylic acid, P-(BTD)Th → P-Th(BTD). Comparing with SM315, inserting Th reduces the energy gaps of P-Th(BTD) and P-(BTD)Th to 1.826 and 1.790 eV, whether or not Th is close to the carboxylic acid. Charge separation efficiency would be improved with LUMO but not with LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 as arriving orbitals, according to the electron distribution in P-(BTD)Th and P-Th(BTD).
To sum up, most of the optimized porphyrin sensitizers with fine adjustments on the π-bridge exhibit suitable electron distributions and energy levels relative to SM315 and SM371. Fortunately, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the porphyrin sensitizers are believed to match well with the CB of semiconductors and the redox potential of electrolytes, especially the CoII/III tris(bipyridyl) electrolyte.40

 Fig. 4  Simulated absorption spectra of the (a) phenyl-bridged, (b) thiophene-bridged, (c) BTD-bridged porphyrin sensitizers, and (d) SM315, P-Ph(BTD), P-(BTD)Th and P-Th(BTD). 
The absorption spectra of Ph-bridged porphyrin sensitizers exhibit a red-shifted trend for the B band and a blue-shifted trend for the Q band with the increase in the number of Ph groups from SM371 (431.03/657.89 nm) to L-2Ph (436.68/653.59 nm) and L-3Ph (440.53/649.35 nm), as indicated in Fig. 4a. The blue-shifted trend for the Q band corresponds to the increased HOMO–LUMO gap and indicates a decrease in the spectral coverage from SM371 to L-2Ph and L-3Ph. As seen in Table 1, the effective transition of HOMO → LUMO+2 (80%) for L-2Ph is found at 399.6 nm with f = 0.036, and a similar transition occurs at 355.3 nm for L-3Ph. Unfortunately, the transitions from HOMO to LUMO for L-2Ph at 652.9 nm with f = 0.559 and for L-3Ph at 651.2 nm with f = 0.593 are ineffective for charge separation according to the frontier molecular orbital analysis. For SM371, the band centered at ∼660 nm is generated from the transition HOMO → LUMO (91%) with f = 0.487 (Table S2, ESI†), showing main ligand-to-ligand electron transfer (LLET) via the effective charge-separated states. These indicate the negative effect of π-bridge length on photon-to-electron conversion in Ph-bridged porphyrin sensitizers.
Substituting the Ph group with electron-rich Th results in redshift of spectral peaks to 442.48/671.14, 480.77/680.27, and 505.05/680.27 nm for H-1Th, H-2Th, and H-3Th relative to that of SM371, as shown in Fig. 4b. When the Th number increases, the B band intensity weakens while the Q band intensity strengthens gradually. A similar trend in spectral intensity is observed with the increase in BTD number, and the Q band peak is redshifted to 724.6, 740.7, and 740.7 nm for H-1BTD–H-3BTD relative to that at 700.2 nm for SM315. The Q band is predominantly produced through the HOMO → LUMO transition for H-2Th at 678.7 nm with f = 0.835 and for H-2BTD at 741.3 nm with f = 0.913, as indicated in Table 1. For H-3BTD, the band centered at ∼739 nm originates from effective transitions via HOMO → LUMO/LUMO+1 with f = 1.062, also exhibiting long-range LLET characteristics. Noticeably, the absorption strength of the first vertical excitations of H-1Th–H-3Th and H-1BTD–H-3BTD increases by a maximum of 38% and a minimum of 11% relative to that of SM315 and SM371, respectively. This increase would be of great help to the performance of porphyrin-sensitized DSSCs.73 In short, increasing Th/BTD number can weaken the B band but strengthen the Q band significantly.
Extending the longitudinal π-conjugation by substituting naphthalene/anthracene for Ph weakens but broadens the B band, while it slightly strengthens and redshifts the Q band of C-2A and C-3A relative to that of SM371, as shown in Fig. 4a and c. At ∼448 nm, the B band of C-2A mainly originates from the mixed transitions via HOMO/HOMO−1/HOMO−2 to LUMO/LUMO+1/LUMO+2 at 456.1 nm (f = 1.472), HOMO−1/HOMO−2/HOMO−3 to LUMO/LUMO+1 at 424.2 nm (f = 0.741), and HOMO/HOMO−2/HOMO−7 to LUMO/LUMO+1/LUMO+2 at 421.9 nm (f = 0.405). Among these transitions, those to LUMO/LUMO+2 are favorable for charge separation. For C-3A, a wide B band is detected that includes two peaks at ∼377 and ∼498 nm, in which most of the transitions at 378.6 and 508.1 nm are unfavorable whereas those at 371.2 and 500.2 nm are effective, as indicated in Table S2 (ESI†). Noticeably, 90% of the transitions of the first vertical excitation of acene-bridged sensitizers occur from the HOMO to the LUMO with strong absorption intensity, including the transitions at 662.8 nm with f = 0.527 for C-2A and at 677.0 nm with f = 0.657 for C-3A. According to the molecular orbital analysis, these transitions are favorable for the efficient charge separation and electron injection.
Repositioning Ph and BTD from SM315 to P-Ph(BTD) shortens the spectral range but increases the B band intensity significantly. Replacing Ph with Th induces a redshift in the Q band but weakens both B and Q band intensities, as depicted in Fig. 4d. When Ph/Th is distanced from the carboxylic acid, the peaks move from 418.4/699.3 nm of SM315 to 427.4/675.7 nm of P-Ph(BTD) and from 418.4/729.9 nm of P-(BTD)Th to 432.9/724.6 nm of P-Th(BTD). This scenario agrees well with the energy gap analysis. For SM315, P-Ph(BTD), P-(BTD)Th, and P-Th(BTD), the first vertical excitations display LLET characteristics via over 80% HOMO → LUMO transition with f ≥ 0.715, thus guaranteeing the spectral performance at the near-infrared region. For the B band, more effective electron transitions occur when Ph/Th is distanced from the carboxylic acid. For instance, only 33% effective transitions to the LUMO occur at 429.6 nm with f = 0.992 for SM315, while 27% effective transitions at 432.2 nm with f = 1.859, 38% transitions at 432.2 nm with f = 0.952 and 95% transitions at 402.2 nm with f = 0.126 occur for P-Ph(BTD). A similar case appears when going from P-(BTD)Th to P-Th(BTD).
3.5 Light-harvesting efficiency (LHE)
With the effect of functionalized π-bridge linkers, the designed porphyrin sensitizers exhibit excellent properties in electronic structure, electron excitation, and absorption spectra relative to SM315 and SM371. As an indicator of incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, LHE characterizes the capability of sensitizers in harvesting light. Sensitizers with high LHE ensure a better photocurrent response. The LHE can be approximated as74 LHE = 1 − 10−A = 1 − 10−f(4)where A(f) is the absorption (oscillator strength) of the sensitizer associated with the lowest vertical excitation energy (EA).
A comparison of the lowest vertical excitation energies (EA), oscillator strengths (f), and relative LHE (RLHE) of all porphyrin sensitizers is shown in Fig. 5. The values of HOMO and LUMO energies, HOMO–LUMO gaps, the lowest vertical excitation energies (EA), oscillator strengths (f), and relative LHE (RLHE) are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The reference sensitizer SM371 has achieved remarkable performance with only a Ph-bridged linker;40 thus, the LHE of the newly designed sensitizers is evaluated through comparison with SM371, that is, RLHE = LHESensitizers/LHESM371. As seen in Fig. 5 and Table S3 (ESI†), the increase in π-bridge length, the extension of longitudinal conjugation, and the introduction of heteroaromatics contribute to the improvement of light-harvesting capability and increase LHE by at least 4.3%. This is related to the oscillator strengths enhanced with the functionalization on SM371, as reflected by the f value ranging from 0.527 to 1.106 in comparison with 0.487 for SM371. The greater the increase in π-bridge length in the π-bridge linker (SM371 → L-2Ph, L-3Ph), the greater the LHE, as reflected by the increase in RLHE from 1.000 to 1.074 and 1.105. A similar case appears for the extension of the longitudinal conjugation (SM371 → C-2A, C-3A) in the π-bridge linker, giving rise to the RLHE from 1.000 to 1.043 and 1.157. Comparatively, the introduction of heteroaromatics, including the Th (SM371 → H-1Th–H-3Th) and BTD (SM371 → H-1BTD–H-3BTD) groups in π-bridge linkers, significantly boosts RLHE to LHEH-3Th/LHESM371 = 1.367 and LHEH-3BTD/LHESM371 = 1.355. The redshifted spectra together with the sharply increased f values of H-1Th–H-3Th and H-1BTD–H-3BTD highlight the significant role of heteroaromatic groups of sensitizers in the light harvesting capability at the long wavelength region. Repositioning the Ph group from SM315 to P-Ph(BTD) decreases RLHE to LHEP-Ph(BTD)/LHESM315 = 0.958, and further introducing Th into P-(BTD)Th and P-Th(BTD) increases RLHE to LHEP-(BTD)Th/LHESM315 = 1.058 and LHEP-Th(BTD)/LHEP-Ph(BTD) = 1.120. This finding also highlights the positive effect of heteroaromatic groups on the light-harvesting performance.

3.6 Intramolecular electron transfer (IET)
Usually, the favorable photo-induced IET properties would increase the efficiency of charge separation and electron injection for sensitizers with D–π–A structure.75 Herein, the IET parameters, including the IET rate (kET), transferred charge (qET), electron transfer distance (dET), H, and t at specific photo-excitation wavelength (λ), are analyzed, as shown in Table 2. More calculation details can be founded in previous studies.70,76–81

For the Ph-bridged sensitizers, the qET decreases with the increase in the π-bridge length, following the sequence of 0.919e (SM371) < 0.826e (L-2Ph) < 0.758e (L-3Ph). The donor-to-acceptor IET rates kET of L-2Ph and L-3Ph are calculated to be 0.19 and 0.24 fs−1, an order of magnitude smaller than 2.86 fs−1 for SM371. This result is attributed to the sharp decrease in the electronic coupling between the initial and final states from 4280 cm−1 for SM371 to 997 and 1008 cm−1 for L-2Ph and L-3Ph, respectively. Although the increase in the π-bridge length has a negative effect on qET and kET, the large dET of 10.828 Å and t of 2.368 Å indicate that L-2Ph is in a more effective charge-separated state.
Introducing electron-rich Th and electron-deficient BTD significantly increases the amount of qET by 0.135–0.403e for H-1Th–H-3Th and by 0.055–0.594e for H-1BTD–H-3BTD in comparison with 0.919e for SM371, as indicated in Table 2. The t value follows the sequence of −4.147 Å (H-3Th) < −2.577 Å (H-2Th) < −1.534 Å (H-1Th), suggesting that introducing more electron-rich units into the bridge linker would increase orbital overlap as well. Comparatively, the t value follows the sequence of −2.702 Å (H-1BTD) < 1.863 Å (H-2BTD) < 2.406 Å (H-3BTD), indicating that introducing more electron-deficient units into the bridge linker would reduce orbital overlap. Interestingly, the increase in π-bridge length from H-1Th to H-2Th and H-3Th accelerates IET from 1.33 to 5.56 and 7.14 fs−1; however, the IET rate of the BTD-bridged sensitizers decreases from 1.85 fs−1 (H-1BTD) to 0.97 fs−1 (H-2BTD) and 0.82 fs−1 (H-3BTD). In short, introducing more electron-rich units into the bridge linker increases the IET rate as well as orbital overlap. By contrast, integrating more electron-deficient units decreases the IET rate as well as orbital overlap. Nonetheless, both electron-rich and electron-deficient units can promote the amount of transferred electrons.
With the extension of longitudinal conjugation, an electron transfer of 1.404e over 3.710 Å is observed for C-3A at a rate of 2.18 fs−1, whereas it is over 1.500 Å shorter in dET with a slightly lower rate than for SM371 with dET = 5.259 Å and kET = 2.86 fs−1, and C-2A with dET = 5.495 Å and kET = 2.76 fs−1. The t = −4.166 Å for C-3A implies a significant orbital overlap between electron-donating and electron-accepting regions. As a result, the IET performance of SM371 and C-2A is expected to be superior to that of C-3A, as in the case of YD11–YD13 porphyrin-sensitized solar cells.16
Inserting Ph or Th between the Zn–porphyrin core and the BTD group reduces the IET rate from 0.94 fs−1 in SM315 to 0.61 fs−1 in P-Ph(BTD) and from 2.62 fs−1 in P-(BTD)Th to 2.09 fs−1 in P-Th(BTD), as shown in Table 2. P-Ph(BTD) and P-Th(BTD) are also superior to SM315 and P-(BTD)Th in that the former exhibit higher qET values of 0.975 and 0.936e, dET values of 10.229 and 9.774 Å, and t values of 2.009 and 1.757 Å. This indicates that the IET rate and charge separation efficiency can be controlled by suitably adjusting the relative position of the units embedded between the Zn–porphyrin core and the anchoring group.
To sum up, keeping a good balance among the electronic structure, electron excitation and spectra, LHE, and photo-induced IET properties would be of great help to the overall performance of porphyrin sensitizers. By adjusting the π-bridge length, heteroaromatic unit, longitudinal conjugation, and relative position of functionalized groups, porphyrin sensitizers can be designed to improve the light-harvesting capability, charge separation and electron injection efficiency, and the matching degree with semiconductor and electrolyte. As a result, continuous progress in sensitizers can be achieved and excellent photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies can be envisaged for DSSCs with SM315 and SM371 as sensitizers.
4. Conclusion
A series of porphyrin sensitizers have been systematically investigated to evaluate the effects of the functionalized π-bridge on DSSC performance using the DFT and TD-DFT approach in THF solution. The main points are summarized as follows:
(1) The increase in π-bridge length by the addition of Ph groups keeps the electron distribution of LUMO away from the anchoring group, decreases the spectral coverage and the proportion of effective electron excitation, and therefore sharply reduces the donor-to-acceptor IET and the photon-to-electron conversion at the long wavelength region.
(2) The introduction of heteroaromatics in the π-bridge stabilizes LUMO levels and thus reduces energy gaps, and improves the light-harvesting capability significantly. Introducing electron-rich units in the π-bridge accelerates the IET process but increases the orbital overlap between donor and acceptor regions, while introducing electron-deficient units enhances the spectral response to the near-infrared light and leads to long-range IET with low orbital overlap. Both electron-rich and electron-deficient heteroaromatic units can promote the amount of transferred electrons.
(3) The extension of longitudinal π-conjugation broadens the B band, and slightly strengthens and redshifts the Q band. However, the short transfer distance, slow IET rate, and high orbital overlap indicate the unfavorable IET characteristics and photon-to-electron conversion performance.
(4) Repositioning the Ph/Th group away from carboxylic acid increases the energy gap and shortens the spectral coverage slightly, but yields more effective donor-to-acceptor electron transitions. The favorable long-range IET processes with more electrons, longer distance, lower orbital overlap and moderate transfer rate are allowed when the heteroaromatic BTD group is positioned near carboxylic acid.
