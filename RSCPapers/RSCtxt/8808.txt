    , Accepted 3rd January 2018First published on 4th January 2018AbstractThe present paper describes photocatalytically active In2O3 thin films developed using a direct drop-cast method on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates using 10 mM In(NO3)3 dissolved in ethylene glycol containing 0–0.0125 M Triton-X 100 (TX-100) surfactant and annealed in air at 600 °C to obtain the desired metal oxide. The absorption spectrum measured the direct band gap of the surfactant modified In2O3 as 3.48 eV along with an indirect gap of 2.69 eV indicating near visible absorptivity of the materials, which was established through linear sweep voltammetry under periodic UV-Vis and visible irradiation for oxidation of water and a sacrificial reagent, SO32−. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (Mott–Schottky) analysis confirms n-type semiconductivity for these materials. Addition of an optimized level of 0.01 M TX-100 surfactant to the precursor solution improves the photoelectrochemical performance of the film to 2.3 fold. The electrochemical action spectra indicate a maximum value of the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the 0.01 M surfactant modified In2O3 of 28% and the corresponding absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) of 40%. Addition of surfactant to the In3+ precursor solution results in uniformly distributed particle growth on the surface with better crystallinity.
Introduction
Wastewater effluents from industry contain toxic organic chemicals that should be dealt with preceding profluent transfer. Semiconductor photocatalysis technology, which utilizes solar energy as a driving force, could alleviate many energy and environmental problems because of its advantages of renewability, cleanness and safety.1 In the past few decades, TiO2 as the main photocatalyst has been widely studied and successfully implemented in commercial applications due to its significant photo-sensitivity, excellent chemical stability, low cost and environmentally benign character.2–4 However, because of its wide band gap (Eg 3.2 eV), only UV light (λ < 400 nm), which is only 3–5% of the entire solar spectrum, can excite electrons from the valence band of TiO2.5 Therefore, many new semiconductors with visible-light driven photocatalytic activities have been developed and studied extensively.6–13 The fundamental principle of photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants is based on total mineralization without requiring secondary treatment of concentrated effluents. Recently, photocatalysis has been considered as a viable strategy for treating an extensive variety of pollutants both from water and air.
Indium oxide (In2O3) with a wide direct band gap (Eg ∼ 3.6 eV) along with a narrow indirect band gap (Eg ∼ 2.8 eV) has been receiving significant attention as an n-type semiconductor, and it has proved to be effective for partially visible light-driven photocatalysis.14 Moreover, it has been widely used as an efficient sensitizer to extend the absorption spectra of oxide semiconductor photocatalysts from the UV region into the visible region. It is also known to be an excellent material for the fabrication of various efficient optoelectronic devices, antistatic coatings, transparent thin film infra-red reflectors, as a substitute for mercury as battery inhibitor and forms a transparent conductive ceramic in combination with tin oxide suitable for photovoltaic devices.15–17 However, the material usually exhibits poor photocatalytic activity due to the large band gap and recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.18,19 Therefore, how to reduce the recombination of photo-induced electron hole pairs during the photocatalytic reactions has become an important subject for developing In2O3-based photocatalysts.
In2O3 has been synthesized via chemical bath,20–22 chemical vapour deposition (CVD),23–25 hydrothermal methods26–28etc. All of these techniques require either maintenance of specific reaction conditions or very sophisticated instrumentation to control the desired stoichiometry. In the search for a stable and cost-effective photocatalyst material to run the solar assisted water splitting process, as well as for the degradation of toxic dye materials, we have synthesized In2O3 nanoparticles via a rapid and cost-efficient method through the dropcast technique using In(NO3)3 dissolved in ethylene glycol (EG) followed by annealing in air. To improve the quality and efficacy of the In2O3 film under illumination, different amounts of Triton-X 100 (TX-100) surfactant were used in the precursor solution. The effects of the surfactant on the photocatalytic performance have been manifested by studying the kinetics of degrading rhodamine-B, acetophenone and nitrobenzene under suitable illuminated conditions. The PEC activity has been further supported by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), photocurrent spectra measurements and calculations of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) measurements. Absorbance spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed for physicochemical characterization of the materials to ascertain the role of surfactant in the In2O3 film.
Experimental section
Materials
Indium nitrate (In(NO3)3·3H2O), ethylene glycol (EG) and rhodamine B dye were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA; Triton-X 100 (TX-100) surfactant, acetophenone (AP), nitrobenzene (NB), NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, Na2SO4, and Na2SO3 were purchased from Merck (AR quality) and used as received. Purified analytical grade water was used in all the experiments to prepare the solutions. F-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass slides (Xin Yan Technology Ltd, Hong Kong) were cleaned by subsequent sonication in ethanol and deionised water.
Preparation of the In2O3 semiconductor thin film electrode
In(NO3)3 (10 mM) dissolved in EG containing various levels of Triton-X 100 surfactant (0, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01 and 0.0125 M) was prepared and 400 μL of each of the precursor solutions was drop cast on the FTO coated glass substrate (1.5 cm × 2.0 cm). The thin films were annealed in air at 600 °C for 10 h with a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1 with 4 h soaking to obtain the well adhered film.
PEC measurement
Photoelectrochemical oxidation of water, , was studied using a conventional three-electrode cell using a Pt foil counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The In2O3 semiconductor thin films were used as the working electrode with a 0.27 cm2 geometric area exposed to the electrolyte of 0.1 M Na2SO4 in pH 7 buffer (PBS) solution for water oxidation or in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution for sacrificial oxidation using a CHI-650E potentiostat (CHI, Austin, TX, USA) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under UV-vis light irradiation of 35 mW cm−2 (using a Xe-arc lamp 35 W, Hamaan, India). Visible responsiveness of the SC thin films was verified through LSV measurements using a UV cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) placed in front of a Xe-lamp.
The stability of the thin film semiconductor electrode undergoing the PEC water oxidation reaction was determined via continuous photocurrent measurements for 1 hour in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 7 PBS) when the electrode was held at a constant potential of 1 V under 35 mW cm−2 illumination. PEC action spectra were obtained through chronoamperometric measurements under periodic monochromatic illumination (using an Oriel monochromator, USA) within the wavelength range of 320–450 nm. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) were calculated from the optical power of the monochromatic incident beam and absorbance of the semiconductor, respectively, according to the equations: (1) (2)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS experiments were performed for each of the samples using the same experimental setup as mentioned earlier, with the help of an Autolab-302N, PG-Stat FRA-II (software NOVA 1.10, Metrohm, The Netherlands). The Nyquist plots were obtained within the frequency range of 100 kHz–20 mHz maintaining the oscillation amplitude of 10 mV in the same electrolytic media at an applied potential of 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mott–Schottky analysis, variations of space charge capacitance with applied potential, was carried out on the samples to ascertain the nature of the semiconductor and its carrier concentration. The experiment was carried out in similar solution using a frequency of 1000 Hz within the potential range of 0 V to 0.5 V.
Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated through degradation of aqueous solutions of different toxic organic substances under UV-vis illumination using the as mentioned Xe-lamp. The photocatalyst (50 mg) was poured into 50 mL of an aqueous solution of the organic substances and prior to irradiation, the solution was continuously stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the substance and the photocatalyst, and subsequently the solution was illuminated. After a fixed interval of time, a small aliquot of the mixture was taken and centrifuged to separate the catalyst and the concentration of the remaining substances was monitored spectrophotometrically. The percentage organic degradation was calculated according to the equation: (3)
Physicochemical characterization
Absorption spectra of the In2O3 thin film semiconductors were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Model V-630, Jasco, Japan) within the wavelength range of 320–600 nm. The nature of the band gap (direct or indirect) was determined from the absorption edge of the Tauc plot. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the materials were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer (Model-4/2005, Quanta Master, PTI, USA) using a 75 W Xenon compact arc lamp as the excitation source maintained at 345 nm.
An X-ray diffractometer (AXS D8, Bruker, Germany) was used to identify the crystal structure of the thin film semiconductor using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) within the 2θ ranges of 20° to 80° at a scan rate of 2° min−1. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed using an Auriga FE-SEM (Carl Zeiss, Germany) to investigate the morphology of the surface.
Results and discussion
Photoelectrochemical characterization
In2O3 thin film electrodes were prepared on FTO glass substrates via drop-casting of In3+ dissolved in EG and annealed at 600 °C. Modified semiconductor films were obtained through addition of different levels of Triton-X 100 surfactant to the In3+ precursor solution. The addition of a surface active agent with the In3+ precursor solution can affect the overall photocatalytic behaviour of the semiconductor in different ways: (i) altering the surface morphology and crystal pattern of the thin film semiconductor that results in modification of the band edges of the semiconductor with possible formation of some intermediary bands. (ii) Modification of the recombination sites for the photo-excited electron–hole pairs with varying the carrier mobility and their concentrations either within the valence or conduction band. In the present study, different levels (0–0.0125 M) of surfactant were used and the concentration of TX-100 was optimized through linear sweep voltammetry under periodic illumination. The effect of surfactant modification on In2O3 was verified for the water oxidation reaction as observed through LSV in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. Fig. 1 represents the comparative LSV plots of the PEC water oxidation reaction (H2O → O2) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 7, PBS) within the potential region of 0 V to 1.4 V. The figure demonstrates that water oxidation photocurrent increases with gradual additions of TX-100 to the precursor solution and reached maxima for the film prepared with 0.01 M added surfactant beyond which it decreases. A photocurrent of 250 μA cm−2 was recorded (at an applied potential of ∼1.2 V) for the film with 0.01 M added surfactant, which is almost 2.4 times higher than that for the pure In2O3. The idealized nature of the I–V plot (LSV), particularly for the optimized sample, indicates the superior quality of the film with improved photocatalytic behavior. The effect of surfactant modification on In2O3 was further verified for sacrificial oxidation under periodic illumination. Fig. 2 represents the LSV plots for SO32− oxidation (in the presence of 0.1 M SO42−) using different semiconductor (SC) films indicating a similar trend in their PEC activity. Enhancement of photocurrent for sacrificial oxidation was found to be almost the same as that of the water oxidation reaction using optimized surfactant (0.01 M TX-100) modified SC film in comparison to the pure In2O3 matrix. One important characteristic of the LSV measurements is that the photocurrents for either of these processes remain almost unchanged in the initial potential region even proceeding towards significant positive direction. This observation indicates that there might be some pores or void spaces where there is significant loss of over-potential due to ‘leakage’ of charges through the exposed active substrates, which has been confirmed in the microscopic analysis.

Fig. S1 (a and b) (ESI†) represents the LSV plots for the sacrificial (SO32−) and water oxidation reactions, respectively, under periodic visible illuminations using pure and 0.01 M TX-100 modified In2O3 film. Retaining of ∼30% photocurrent under visible illumination as compared to that using UV–vis light indicates partial visible responsiveness of the materials.
Stability of the semiconductor against photo-dissolution is an important criterion for long-term applications in PEC cells. Fig. 3 displays the chronoamperometric (I–t) variation curves of different In2O3 films when the electrode was held at a constant potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under illumination. The figure indicates that all the films are fairly stable to carry out PEC water oxidation, as there is no sign of deterioration in the photocurrent during continuous measurements for 1 h.

The action spectrum of the semiconductor–electrolyte interface was recorded through chronoamperometry (at 1.0 V) with gradual changes in monochromatic wavelength from UV to the visible region (320–450 nm) and the corresponding photocurrent spectra at each wavelength was plotted. The wavelength dependent photocurrent measurement is informatory in highlighting the ‘true’ positions of the relevant band edges of the materials. Fig. S2 (ESI†) represents the PEC action spectra of the different semiconductors for water oxidation in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 7, PBS). The appearance of significantly improved photocurrent for the 0.01 M (optimized) TX-100 modified film as compared to the pure In2O3, even in the higher wavelength (visible) region, is suggestive of the slight shortening of the band gap energy for the SC film developed from the surfactant containing solution. The effect has been further verified through optical measurements (Tauc plot), which will be discussed later.
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) as a function of incident light wavelength was derived from the PEC action spectra for all of the semiconductors. In comparison with pure In2O3, the surfactant modified films exhibit enhanced photoactivity over the whole spectrum region (320–450 nm), especially for the optimized (0.01 M) surfactant modified In2O3 films (Fig. 4). The highest IPCE value of 28% (and the corresponding APCE value of 40%) was recorded for the 0.01 M surfactant modified In2O3 film, which is almost two fold higher in magnitude than that of the pure In2O3 film (IPCE of 14% and corresponding APCE of 22%). The above results are consistent with the improvements observed in the photocurrent densities through LSV analysis.

Impedance measurements
The Mott–Schottky plots were recorded at a frequency of 1 kHz in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, as presented in Fig. 5. The positive slope of the plots for all films confirms the n-type characteristic for the pure and surfactant modified In2O3 films. The flat band potential (Vfb) of the semiconductor–electrolyte interface was calculated using the equation: 1/C2 = [2/ε0εseND][V − Vfb − (kBT/e)](4)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1) and εs is the dielectric constant of In2O3, taken as 8.9,29e is the electronic charge, T is the temperature in K, kB is the Boltzmann's constant, ND the carrier density, and V is the applied potential. The flat band potential (Vfb) for all of the In2O3 semiconductors (pure and surfactant modified) was found to remain almost invariant, at ∼0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which facilitates the water oxidation process over their surface. Carrier concentration (donor density, ND) of the bulk semiconductor was calculated from the slope of the plots as (5)
 Fig. 5  Mott Schottky plot of In2O3 thin films in 0.1(M) SO42− solution (pH 7, PBS). 
The donor density of the pure In2O3 film was found to be of the order of 1.03 × 1019 cm−3, which increases slightly to 1.86 × 1019 cm−3 for the surfactant modified film. This trend supports an increase in photocurrent for the surfactant modified semiconductor, as discussed earlier.

Fig. 6 represents the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic Nyquist plots of pure and different levels of surfactant modified In2O3 photoanodes at an applied potential of 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under UV-visible light illumination. The single semicircular nature of the impedance spectra (Nyquist plots Fig. 6a) indicates a simple charge transfer process occurring across the interface and the radius of the semicircle correlates with the charge transfer resistance of the associated process. Fig. 6b (inset) represents the equivalent circuit diagram, which is composed of solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and a constant phase element (Q). In the equivalent circuit model, the contribution of a constant phase element (Q) in place of the capacitor is due to the appearance of the ‘depressed’ nature of the semicircle in the plots (Fig. 6a) considering the heterogeneity of the semiconductor surfaces.

The magnitudes of the constant phase element for the different materials, as evaluated through the EC diagram, are found to be nearly invariant, indicating almost the same SC properties for all of the materials. Variations of equivalent circuit parameters for the different samples are presented in Fig. 6c. From this plot, it is evident that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the pure In2O3 (21 kΩ) reduced significantly in the presence of the surfactant modified semiconductor and reaches the minimum value (6.5 kΩ) for the optimized (0.01 M) film. This suggests that this particular film possesses the smallest charge transfer resistance in comparison to the pure semiconductor, indicating the improved PEC performance, as demonstrated earlier.
Photocatalytic behaviour of In2O3 semiconductor nanoparticles
The sunlight mediated photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RB) dye, acetophenone (AP) and nitrobenzene (NB) was studied using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The degradation process was monitored by studying the decrease in absorbance of RB (λmax ∼ 550 nm), AP (λmax ∼ 245 nm) and NB (λmax ∼ 270 nm) in the presence of suspended particles after certain time intervals.
Fig. S3a–c (ESI†) represents the dye-degradation kinetics of RB, AP and NB in the presence of 0.01 M surfactant modified In2O3 after certain intervals of time and the corresponding figures in the inset (Fig. S3a′–c′) demonstrate the same kinetics using pure semiconductor. The % degradation of the substances with respect to irradiation time using pure and surfactant modified (0.01 M TX-100) In2O3 photocatalyst is depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The pure In2O3 photocatalyst showed only 30% RB degradation within 90 min of exposure to light, while in the case of AP and NB, degradation values of 38 and 34% were observed, respectively, after 180 min and 60 min of irradiation. On the other hand, for surfactant modified samples, 62, 75 and 61% degradation values were recorded for RB, AP and NB, respectively, under similar light exposure. This clearly indicates that the surfactant modified In2O3 catalyst enhanced the photocatalytic activity as compared to pure In2O3. The kinetic expressions for the photodegradation of different organic molecules were evaluated. In general, the photocatalytic dye degradation reactions follow the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.30 Variation of ln(C0/Ct) vs. irradiation time using different species is presented in Fig. 7 and the corresponding slope of the graph indicates the apparent rate constant values (kapp) for the process and these are summarized in the figure. The optimized surfactant modified In2O3 showed a significantly higher rate constant value for photocatalytic degradation compared to the pure semiconductor.

Physicochemical characterization
UV-visible absorption spectra of the semiconductor films were used to indicate the nature of bands within the semiconductors, and to calculate the band gap energy. Fig. 8a represents the optical absorption spectra of the pure and surfactant (TX 100) modified In2O3 thin films. The band gap energy (Eg) as well as the nature of the band-to-band transition pattern of the samples was calculated by the Tauc formula:31 (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg)(6)where α, h, ν, and A are the absorption coefficient, the Plank's constant, the frequency of the radiation and a constant, respectively. The value of n is taken as 2 and 0.5 for the direct and indirect band gap, respectively.
 Fig. 8  (a) Absorption spectra of pure and surfactant modified In2O3 thin film on an FTO coated glass substrate and (b) Tauc plot of pure and 0.01 M TX-100 modified In2O3 (inset). 
The Tauc plot (Fig. 8b) shows that pure In2O3 has two distinct absorption bands: one arising from the indirect gap, at ∼2.8 eV, and the other one from the direct gap at ∼3.60 eV, similar to the observations reported in the literature.32 For the surfactant modified In2O3, the optical band gap decreases slightly to 3.48 eV and 2.69 eV for the direct and indirect band gap, respectively. This nominal change in the band gap energy is probably due to the change in the crystallite size of the semiconductor particles with better distribution over the surface in the presence of the surfactant modified film that favours absorption of more photons with lower energy.

Fig. 9 represents the relative positions of the conduction band (CB) and valance band (VB) of pure and 0.01 M TX-100 modified In2O3, respectively, as calculated from the band gap energy and flat band potential measurements. A decrease in the band gap, to some extent in the presence of the surfactant modified film, with a favourable valence band position facilitates photocatalytic degradation of organic molecules over its surface as well as improved PEC water oxidation as observed through LSV and IPCE, APCE measurements.

Fig. 10 represents the relative XRD patterns for the pure and different levels of surfactant (TX-100) modified In2O3 samples, all of which are found to match perfectly with the ‘cubic’ In2O3 phase according to JCPDS data (06-0416). The different peaks are indexed with the (hkl) values as (211), (400), (411), (332), (431), (521), (440), (433), (611), (541), (622), (631), (444), (721), (651), (741), and (653) along with the strongest peak of (222) at 2θ corresponding to 30.6°. The relative intensities of some of the peaks increase to some extent with surfactant addition, even without any monotonic trend, indicating different proportions in their growth at various concentrations. However, the absence of any other peaks eliminates the effect of contamination of impurities in the semiconductor matrix. Increases in the peak intensities, especially those arising from the (400), (440) and (541) planes for the surfactant modified films, which became prominent for the optimized film, indicate an improvement in the crystallinity of that particular film.
 Fig. 10  XRD pattern of the pure and 0.01 M TX-100 modified In2O3 thin films. The peaks were indexed using the JCPDS data file. 
Crystalline sizes of the In2O3 semiconductors were calculated using the Scherrer equation:33 D = (0.9λ)/(βcosθ)(7)where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (1.5405 Å), β corresponds to the full width at half maximum (FWHM, in degree), and θ is the diffraction angle (in degree). The value of d, the interplanar spacing between the atoms, is calculated using the Bragg's Law nλ = 2dsinθ(8)
Comparing the diffractographs for different samples, it is evident that through surfactant addition, the crystalline size corresponding to the strongest (222) peak decreases and reaches its minimum for the 0.01 M TX-100 added film (18 nm) over that for pure In2O3 (28 nm).
The surface morphology and quality of the films were revealed through scanning electron microscopic analysis. Fig. 11a shows the SEM image of the pure In2O3 film where part of the FTO was found to remain exposed as the semiconductors covered little with agglomerated particles. On gradual addition of surfactant in the precursor solution, the quality of the film improves with better surface coverage and with the optimised 0.01 M TX-100 surfactant modifications (Fig. 11d), the ‘defect-free’ films were obtained. The above fact may be explained by the fact that surfactant modulates the available surface energy of the particles so that the surface tension decreases, which allows more particles to escape the aggregation process and generally lowers the mean particle size to avoid agglomeration. TX-100, before it evaporates from the surface, makes the surface homogeneous, thereby increasing the surface area. It also arranges the metal ion precursors in a more uniform pattern, as observed through the SEM images of the surfactant modified films. When a surfactant is employed in the synthesis procedure, ‘vertical’ expansion of the nuclei was prevented, probably due to the adsorption of the surface-active agent throughout the surface of the substrate and newly formed crystals, and thus this favours ‘horizontal’ growth of the semiconductors with smaller size crystallites leading to more uniformly distributed films. In addition, the adsorption of the surface-active agent may also stabilize the nanoparticles.34 The relative change in the crystallite size, as evaluated through XRD analyses, also supports this observation. With a further increase in surfactant concentrations (0.0125 M), an excess amount of surfactant may decrease the film thickness to such an extent that the film became significantly porous, as is evident from the corresponding micrograph, shown in Fig. 11e. The inset of the corresponding micrograph (Fig. 11a′–e′) indicates SEM images with higher magnification (×80k), to show the nature of the distributed semiconductor particles over the film surface. The linear sweep voltammograms of each of the samples for either H2O or sacrificial (SO32−) oxidation also suggest a similar trend, as described earlier.

Photoluminescence measurements of the as-synthesized In2O3 semiconductors were performed at room temperature, using 330 nm as the excitation source. Fig. 12 represents the PL emission behaviours of the different samples prepared with varying surfactant concentration. It is well-known that as a wide band gap semiconductor, bulk In2O3 exhibits no PL emission at room temperature.35 However, the peak at ∼394 nm must originate from the free exciton emission around 3.14 eV of the wide-band-gap In2O3 crystallites. Along with this broad peak, other peaks at 425 nm, 450 nm and 468 nm, i.e. in the visible region, were also detected. It is interesting to note that with the gradual increase in surfactant concentration (up to 0.01 M TX-100), the intensity of the overall PL signal increases, indicating the improvement in quality of the semiconductor materials denoting optimization of the crystallinity under these conditions.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated the development of In2O3 crystallites via a direct drop-cast technique and optimization of the loading of surfactant to improve the photocatalytic behaviour of the material. XRD analysis indicates the presence of cubic In2O3 for all of the materials and crystallinity improves with gradual addition of Triton-X 100 surfactant, which was optimized at a concentration of 0.01 M. The SEM study reveals modification of surface morphology through surfactant addition. Addition of an amount of 0.01 M TX-100 surfactant during growth of the semiconductor leads to the decrease in the direct band gap energy from 3.60 to 3.48 V along with an indirect band gap of from 2.8 to 2.69 V, indicating better absorptivity of the solar energy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirms n-type semiconductivity of the In2O3 films and with the increase in concentration (up to 0.0125 M) of the added surfactant, charge transfer resistance decreases, showing a minimum at the concentration of 0.01 M TX-100 surfactant, thereby facilitating a charge transfer reaction at its surface. A photocurrent of 250 μA cm−2 was recorded for the water oxidation process using the optimized In2O3 photocatalyst with maximum incident and absorbed photon to current conversion efficiencies of IPCE 28% and APCE 40%.
