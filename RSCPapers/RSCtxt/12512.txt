    , Accepted 23rd May 2018First published on 23rd May 2018AbstractInorganic and organic lead halide perovskite materials attract great interest in the scientific community because of their potential for low-cost, high efficiency solar cells. In this report we add a new property of these materials, namely their photochemical activity in the visible light range. Both inorganic (CsPbBr3) and organic (CH3NH3PbBr3-MAPbBr3) perovskite thin films were demonstrated to promote photo-dissociation of adsorbed ethyl chloride (EC), employing 532 nm pulsed laser irradiation under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. From the post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis, the yield of photoproduct formation was found to be up to two orders of magnitude higher than for UV light-excited EC molecules on metallic and oxide surfaces. Photo-reactivity on top of the CsPbBr3 surface is almost an order of magnitude more efficient than on the CH3NH3PbBr3 surface, apparently due to the lower density of defect and surface states. A direct correlation was found between electron-induced luminescence and photoluminescence intensities and the photoreactivity cross-sections. We conclude that both the intense luminescence and the well-known photovoltaic properties associated with these halide perovskite materials are consistent with the efficiency of photo-reactivity in the visible range, reported here for the first time.
1. Introduction
Developing a clean and renewable source of energy to reduce the reliance of our society on fossil fuels is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Among the alternative energy sources, solar energy is particularly attractive owing to its abundance and easy accessibility. While photovoltaics (PV) is a well-developed non-biological route of quantum conversion of solar light, in this case to electrical energy, photo-catalysis, which can both convert and store solar energy, in this case into chemical energy, is still rather less efficient, in particular with visible light excitation. Over the past decades, there have been a large number of applications developed for photocatalysts, such as, water splitting for hydrogen production,1 degradation of organic pollutants for water purification,2 self-cleaning surfaces,3 air purification,4 conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons5etc. While many semiconductors, ternary and other complex oxide systems have been explored as photocatalysts, their solar-chemical energy conversion yield has been limited below 10%. Recently, organic and inorganic halide perovskites, with excellent optical and electronic properties, have attracted much attention as promising materials for photovoltaic applications.6–9 Particularly, their low band gap, long carrier lifetime, reasonable charge mobilities and high absorption coefficients in the visible region enable them to also be applied beyond photovoltaics, in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs, lasers and photodetectors.10–12 Halide perovskite-based solar cells have seen the fastest photoelectric conversion efficiency rise of any solar cell technology from ∼4% to >22% within only several years of research.13 Photocatalytic studies that have been performed using perovskite materials were limited to oxide perovskites (SrTiO3, BaTiO3, SrSnO3)14–16 that do not show significant PV activity. To the best of our knowledge at present, no photochemical activity of organic and inorganic halide perovskites has been reported, possibly because of stability issues in ambient environmental conditions. In this work we demonstrate the photochemical properties of two different inorganic (CsPbBr3) and organic (CH3NH3PbBr) halide perovskites under visible light irradiation by monitoring ethyl chloride (EC) dissociation as the probing molecule. Since both halide perovskites are sensitive to moisture and oxygen, the photochemistry experiments were performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Under a clean and well-defined UHV environment, with in situ surface inspection before and following the photo-irradiation, detection of yields of reactivity and selectivity are possible. Moreover, this study enabled us to investigate the interaction of light and electrons with the halide perovskite samples from a surface science perspective to help understand fundamental properties at the halide perovskite-vacuum interface, such as photoluminescence (PL), electron beam-induced luminescence (EBIL) and charge transfer, and how these influence photochemistry at this interface.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Perovskite substrate preparation, CsPbBr3
The photochemistry studies reported here were performed with SiO2/Si(100) as the substrate for halide perovskite deposition and EC adsorption. The CsPbBr3 films (300 nm thick) were prepared on a SiO2/Si(100) substrate using a 2-step sequential deposition technique (as described in ref. 9). 1 M PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMF was stirred on a hot plate at 75 °C for 20 min. It was then filtered using a 0.2 μm pore size PTFE filter and immediately used. The solution was spin-coated on preheated (75 °C) substrates for 1 min at 2500 rpm and was then dried on a hot plate at 75 °C for 30 min. After drying, the substrates were dipped for 10 min in a heated (50 °C) solution of 15 mg mL−1 CsBr (Sigma-Aldrich) in methanol for 10 min, washed with 2-propanol, dried under a N2 stream and annealed for 10 min at 250 °C. The XRD and SEM results of CsPbBr3 are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S1.
2.2 MAPbBr3
400 nm thick films were prepared in a nitrogen glove box by spin coating of 2M MAPbBr3 solution on a SiO2/Si(100) substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s. MAPbBr3 solution was prepared by dissolving an equivalent amount of MABr and PbBr2 (Aldrich ≥98%) in a solution of γ-butyrolactone dimethyl sulfoxide (1:1). Methylammonium bromide (MABr) was synthesized by reacting methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) with excess hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a round bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 hours while stirring. The solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator at 50 °C. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallized in ethanol absolute. The XRD and SEM results of MAPbBr3 are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S2.
2.3 UHV photochemistry experiments
The photochemistry experiments described here were conducted in a previously described17 ultra high vacuum (UHV) system at a base pressure of ∼2 × 10−10 Torr. The UHV chamber is equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (SRS, RGA-200) that is glass shrouded with a 5 mm orifice at its end, enabling temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra to be measured at 1 mm distance from the sample, thus avoiding TPD signals from surfaces other than the sample. The second harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm has been used as the light source at a power of 1 mJ cm−2 per pulse (Spectra Physics INDI 20, pulse width 6 ns, and a repetition rate of 10 Hz). The reaction scheme of the photochemical process can be written as:  
The visible light irradiation (532 nm) excites electron-hole pairs which lead to C–Cl bond cleavage via hot electrons, consequently EC is photo-dissociated, leading to an adsorbed ethyl radical (C2H5) and adsorbed Cl−via a dissociative electron attachment mechanism. While some of the ethyl radicals react with adsorbed Had (from the background or further photo-dissociation of the photo-products) to produce ethane, the other fraction are retained and recombine upon sample heating to form butane (C4H10). This butane is further fragmented to Mass-41 (allyl radical) and Mass-43 (propyl radical) in the QMS ionizer during post-irradiation TPD. All the chlorine atoms that were accumulated on the perovskite surface (as determined by in situ Auger spectroscopy) are removed between each photo-chemistry cycle by Ne+ ion sputtering. In order to study the photo-dissociation of EC, post-irradiation TPD experiments were performed by tracing the mass number of the possible photo products Mass-30 (ethane), Mass-41 (the allyl radical) and Mass-43 (the propyl radical), The surface of the sample was analyzed after each photochemistry experiment using the in situ Auger spectrometer (LK Technologies) and it was found that the perovskite substrates are deteriorated by photodissociated chlorine. Hence, after each photochemistry cycle the surface was cleaned by 10 minutes sputtering at 300 K (Ne+ ions at 600 V and a sample current of ∼2 μA).
2.4 Luminescence studies
Electron beam-induced luminescence (EBIL) studies were performed at temperatures (of the perovskite samples) between 40 K and 300 K using a 2000 eV electron beam (Kimball Physics, ELG-2) as the e-beam excitation source. Photoluminescence (PL) studies were performed following 355 nm laser irradiation (third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser at the power of 1 mJ cm−2 per pulse) as the light excitation source. Both photon- and electron-induced luminescence signals were measured using an Ocean Optics spectrometer (USB2000+ model) from outside of the UHV chamber through the optical viewing port.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Adsorption of EC on the halide perovskite surfaces
Before reporting on the photochemistry of EC on CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3, we briefly describe the thermal adsorption and desorption of EC from these halide perovskite substrates, since such experiments have not been reported previously. TPD experiments of the parent EC molecule (detected at mass 29) from clean SiO2/Si(100) reveal a single desorption peak at 85 K, whereas experiments under similar conditions performed on CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 perovskite-covered surfaces reveal two desorption peaks around 92–110 K. From the TPD results performed with different EC exposures shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), we estimated that an exposure of 1.5 Langmuirs (L) EC (1 L = 10−6 Torr s) leads to 1 ML (monolayer) EC coverage on both halide perovskite substrates (implying an identical sticking probability of EC on both substrates). These results were confirmed by electron-induced luminescence (EBIL) studies (Fig. S7, ESI†). Assuming a pre-exponential factor of 1013 Hz (for first order desorption kinetics), the binding energies of an EC molecule on the halide perovskite surfaces (detected via mass 29 using TPD line shape analysis) were estimated to be 5.6 ± 0.5 kcal mol−1 and 6.2 ± 0.5 kcal mol−1 for CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. This suggests that the interaction between ethylchloride and perovskite is physisorption in nature.

Exposure values were corrected for the ion gauge sensitivity factor. Heating rates were 1 K s−1. 
3.2 Photodissocation of EC on the halide perovskite substrates
The photochemical activity of the halide perovskite materials was studied by monitoring the photo-dissociation of EC molecules adsorbed on both CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 surfaces, by employing TPD measurements following visible light irradiation. Several masses were recorded simultaneously, including the parent molecule and the most abundant photoproducts as a function of the number of photons striking the halide perovskite surfaces. Specifically, ethane (Mass-30, C2H6), the allyl radical (Mass-41, C3H5) and the propyl radical (Mass-43, C3H7) were monitored. Post-irradiation TPD spectra of these most abundant photoproducts were obtained following visible light laser (6 ns pulse duration at 532 nm) excitation of 1 ML EC adsorbed on the perovskite samples as a function of the number of photons (or laser pulses) striking the surface (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4 in ESI†). These spectra indicate that the parent molecule population depletes as the number of pulses grows from 0 to 2.7 × 1018 photons, with a simultaneous increase in the population (coverage) of the photoproducts. Ethane desorbs via a sharp peak at 40 K and 45 K from MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 respectively, whereas the allyl and the propyl radicals desorb at 65–100 K and 50–100 K, respectively. As can be seen, propyl radicals exhibit similar TPD spectra to the allyl radicals (Fig. S4 in ESI†), suggesting that both of them originate from the same precursor parent molecule butane (Mass 58, C4H10) as a result of fragmentation within the QMS.18 In both of the perovskites, the ratio between propyl and allyl radicals was ∼1:1 (taken from the experiment in which maximum photochemical yield is observed). This ratio is less than the reported literature value (3:1) 18 suggesting the presence of butene (Mass 56, C4H8) as another possible photochemical product, contributing its fragments to the allyl radical.
 Fig. 2  Post-irradiation TPD spectra of the photogenerated product, ethane (Mass 30, C2H6) at the indicated number of 532 nm photons striking the sample (A) CsPbBr3 and (B) MAPbBr3. The heating rate was 1 K s−1. 
In Fig. 3 and in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† we compare the integrated area under the TPD spectra of these most abundant photoproducts (normalized to that of the parent EC molecule without irradiation). The yield of the photoproducts increases with increasing number of photons, and eventually reaches saturation. The saturation is observed when the number of photons striking the surface is >8.0 × 1017 photons in the case of CsPbBr3 and >1.3 × 1018 photons for MAPbBr3. As shown in Fig. 3, the increasing ethane coverage was fitted with an exponential saturation curve and the cross section values were found to be 4.5 ± 0.2 × 10−18 cm2 and 1.5 ± 0.8 × 10−19 cm2 for CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. In contrast, the cross section values obtained using linear fits of the initial formation rates were smaller, viz. 3.8 ± 0.7 × 10−19 cm2 for CsPbBr3 and 5.8 ± 0.7 × 10−20 cm2 for MAPbBr3. This discrepancy can be explained by surface poisoning, induced by adsorption of chlorine atoms dissociated from EC. This was also confirmed by an increased Cl signal observed in Auger spectra taken following the photochemistry runs (Fig. 4). Therefore, due to poisoning and saturation at higher photon doses, the initial formation rates of photo products (ethane, propyl and allyl radicals) were used to derive the more accurate cross sections for EC photo-dissociation. From the linear fitting of the initial photo product growth, the cross sections for ethane, propyl and allyl radical formation were derived (see Fig. S4 and S5 in ESI†) and the values are given in Table 1. Almost identical cross sections obtained for the formation of the allyl and the propyl radicals indicate that both originate from the same precursor molecule – butane.

Exponential fit (red and black) and linear fit for the initial growth (green and blue) were used to demonstrate how cross sections of the formation of product molecules were determined.

From the cross section values, it is clear that photo-reactivity on top of the CsPbBr3 surface is an order of magnitude more effective than on the CH3NH3PbBr3. This correlates well with the stronger PL intensity, reflecting the low density of surface defects.
3.3 Luminescence
The objective of studying photoluminescence (PL) and electron beam-induced luminescence (EBIL) was their potential as guiding tools for the presence of surface states and defects. Fig. 5 illustrates the temperature-dependent EBIL spectra of CsPbBr3 recorded from 35 to 150 K. At 35 K an emission peak located at 2.31 eV (537 nm) is observed, displaying a systematic blue-shift when the temperature increases from 40 to 150 K. PL spectra were measured as well, revealing a similar blue shift at low temperature, while in the high temperature range (from 180 to 300 K), the peak position does not change anymore (see Fig. S6 in ESI†). In the case of the PL spectra taken from CsPbBr3, a single and relatively narrow peak is recorded in the entire temperature range, which can be attributed to the emission from the lowest state exciton only, indicating negligible trap state density. In contrast, from MAPbBr3, in addition to lower PL intensity, there is a split into two peaks at 120 K which can be attributed to the presence of surface states (see Fig. S6 in ESI† and further discussion therein).
 Fig. 5  Electron beam induced luminescence (EBIL) of CsPbBr3, excited by a 2 keV electron beam. Inset (A) shows the electron beam-induced luminescence (EBIL) of CsPbBr3 as a function of excitation e-beam energy and (B) shows the photograph of CsPbBr3 illuminated with the e-beam. 
Interestingly, the EBIL intensity is found to be about five times brighter than the PL intensity. The flux of impinging electrons (1 μA = 6.3 × 1012 electron per s) on the CsPbBr3 substrate is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the photons (the number of photons per s at 355 nm laser irradiation is 1.8 × 1016 s−1) used for the PL studies. Hence the overall cross section for electron induced luminescence at 2 keV is more than four orders of magnitude larger than that of photo-induced luminescence. In addition, the EBIL signal is much more strongly quenched with increasing temperature than the PL one. The signal diminished by almost half when the temperature increased from 40 to 50 K and it completely vanished above 150 K, apparently due to strong electron–phonon coupling.19,20 Furthermore, the luminescence signal is stable for a long time (tens of minutes) while the same spot on the sample was being excited by the electron beam. Improved stability of the CsPbBr3 film during irradiation by photons or electrons over the MAPbBr3 one has previously been reported;21 the present results provide vivid evidence for the effect of ambient atmosphere on (in)stability. Although the high energy spectroscopy (2 keV, a typical core energy excitation range used in e.g. Auger spectroscopy) of these perovskites is unknown with respect to luminescence excitation, it seems that the EBIL excitation is a significantly higher probability process than the 355 nm optical excitation, even though both end up populating the same emitting low energy state. In addition, the fact that EBIL disappears if the electron energy drops below 500 eV (see inset A of Fig. 5) suggests that the energetic window for the EBIL method is limited to electron energy >500 eV. Attempts to obtain similar EBIL data from MAPbBr3 samples was unsuccessful, probably due to e-beam damage of the organic part (methylamine) of the material (as CH3NH2 can escape as gas, in contrast to Cs). This is consistent with our EBIC studies21 where the two materials were compared using 3 keV electrons and MAPbBr3 was found to be less stable under the e-beam irradiation.
We conclude that the photochemistry data are consistent with the luminescence results. Higher photo-reactivity on top of the CsPbBr3 surface can be attributed to the low density of defects as implied from the EBIL and photoluminescence studies.
4. Conclusions
The photochemical activity of CsPbBr3 (inorganic) and MAPbBr3 (organic) halide perovskites under visible light irradiation has been studied via photo-fragmentation of ethyl chloride (EC) using a nanosecond pulsed visible light (532 nm) laser excitation procedure for the first time. Post-irradiation TPD experiments and in situ Auger electron spectroscopy indicate that the C–Cl bond dissociates following the visible light excitation to form surface-bound Cl atoms, ethane, and butane. Previous studies under similar conditions with EC on top of SiO2/Si(100) or on silver nanoclusters on SiO2/Si(100) surfaces found no photo-reactivity whatsoever upon irradiation at 532 nm.17 Among the two perovskites, CsPbBr3 exhibits an order of magnitude higher photochemical cross section than MAPbBr3 to decompose the probe EC molecule. Moreover, compared to typical photochemical cross sections on, e.g. silver substrates (10−21–10−20 cm2), the perovskites reveal about an order of magnitude higher photo-reactivity. If these halide perovskites are protected against damage due to water and oxygen, the observations reported here provide a good basis to explore their use for other photo-catalytic applications such as water splitting.
These observations support our conclusion that a correlation exists between bright electron- or photon-induced luminescence, efficient photovoltaic performance and photo-reactivity in the visible optical range, as reported in this work.

 	Fig. 1  Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ethyl chloride from a halide perovskite substrate: TPD spectra of EC from a 400 nm thick CsPbBr3 film deposited on a SiO2/Si(100) sample at the indicated exposures in Langmuirs (L) (1 L = 10−6 Torr s). Exposure values were corrected for the ion gauge sensitivity factor. Heating rates were 1 K s−1.	 

 	Fig. 2  Post-irradiation TPD spectra of the photogenerated product, ethane (Mass 30, C2H6) at the indicated number of 532 nm photons striking the sample (A) CsPbBr3 and (B) MAPbBr3. The heating rate was 1 K s−1.	 

 	Fig. 3  Integrated TPD peaks vs. visible (532 nm) light excitation of the photgenerated product ethane (Mass 30, C2H6), (derived from Fig. 2) vs. the number of 532 nm photons striking the CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 perovskite samples. Exponential fit (red and black) and linear fit for the initial growth (green and blue) were used to demonstrate how cross sections of the formation of product molecules were determined.	 

 	Fig. 4  Auger spectra of EC on top of CsPbBr3, before photo-dissociation (black), following EC photo fragmentation (red) and after cleaning the surface of CsPbBr3 by sputtering (green).	 


CsPbBr3	6.9 ± 0.1 × 10−19 cm2	1.7 ± 0.3 × 10−19 cm2	1.8 ± 0.1 × 10−19 cm2
MAPbBr3	6.0 ± 0.1 × 10−20 cm2	1.8 ± 0.1 × 10−20 cm2	2.0 ± 0.4 × 10−20 cm2

 	Fig. 5  Electron beam induced luminescence (EBIL) of CsPbBr3, excited by a 2 keV electron beam. Inset (A) shows the electron beam-induced luminescence (EBIL) of CsPbBr3 as a function of excitation e-beam energy and (B) shows the photograph of CsPbBr3 illuminated with the e-beam.
