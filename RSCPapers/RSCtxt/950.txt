    , Accepted 4th January 2018First published on 23rd January 2018AbstractIt is essential for mankind to address greenhouse gas emission, depletion of fossil resources and development of efficient storage and transportation of renewable energy. By using the atmospheric gas CO2 as raw material for the value-added chain, an overall CO2 neutral circular economy is imaginable. The power to gas (PtG) concept tackles all three topics by producing methane as energy carrier using renewable hydrogen and capture of CO2. Methanation has been known for decades; however, the preparation of noble metal free catalysts possessing high activity, selectivity and stability remains challenging. Bimetallic FexNix−1 alloy catalysts have shown synergistic effects for methanation as they can be tailored to the CO dissociation energy. Multicomponent hydrotalcite precursors allow close proximity of the individual metals enabling high dispersion and continuous variation of the composition. Herein, we studied Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox bimetallic catalysts derived via mixed hydrotalcite precursors. Iron has a significant influence on both activity and selectivity due to small particle sizes, facilitated CO dissociation, and tailored surface basicity. For the best catalyst (Fe/Ni = 0.1), the CO2 conversion rate reaches about 6.96 mmol CO2 molFe+Ni−1 s−1 at 335 °C with a selectivity of 99.3% to CH4, remaining constant for at least 24 h time on stream.
Introduction
One of the major challenges for mankind in the 21st century is to achieve a decreased net-carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere to counteract the greenhouse effect.1 Through recycling of CO2 as raw material for chemical value chains, one could imagine an overall CO2 neutral circular economy. A second major challenge is to establish efficient ways to store renewable energy (e.g. solar and wind). Therefore, the power-to-gas (PtG) concept has attracted much attention.2 The greenhouse gas CO2 is converted to synthetic natural gas (SNG) by using hydrogen produced from renewable energy. In this way, CO2 can be recycled and surplus energy chemically stored.
CO2 methanation (Sabatier reaction) is thermodynamically favourable (ΔG298K = −130.8 kJ mol−1); however, the reduction of the fully oxidized carbon to methane is an eight-electron process with significant kinetic limitations, which thus requires a catalyst to achieve acceptable rates and selectivity. Extensive studies have been conducted on supported metal-based catalytic systems for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane.3–5 Nickel metal is known to be an effective catalyst component for the synthesis of methane from CO2 based on its activity and cheaper price. However, conventional industrial methanation catalysts based on Ni/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation suffer from rapid deactivation during the exothermic reaction. The main origins of deactivation comprise sintering of Ni particles as well as severe carbon deposition. Additionally, the formation of nickel aluminate spinel also reduces the efficiency of Ni-based catalysts.6 Therefore, alternative solutions are necessary to overcome the problems of conventional Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation.
Among the possible solutions, alloying of nickel with other metals can improve the catalytic performance in terms of activity and stability.7 One suitable modifier is iron because Fe can interact with Ni by the formation of Ni–Fe alloys and Fe species hold distinct redox properties potentially improving reducibility.8 Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts supported by different metal oxide materials synthesized by impregnation have been widely studied and improved the catalytic performance of conventional Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for both CO and CO2 methanation. Among the investigations, Andersson et al. (2006) presented DFT calculations explaining the improved activity in CO methanation as being due to facilitated CO dissociation on iron–nickel alloys and proved this by synthesis/testing of Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 spinel.9,10 Hwang et al. (2012) studied mesoporous nickel (35 wt%)-M (M = Fe, Zr, Ni, Y, and Mg) (5 wt%)-alumina xerogel catalysts in CO2 methanation, varying the second metal. The yield of CH4 decreased in the order 35Ni5Fe > 35Ni5Zr > 35Ni5Ni > 35Ni5Y > 35Ni5Mg. The most active and selective mesoporous catalyst was 35Ni5Fe; this catalyst possesses a weak metal–support interaction that is closely related to the CO dissociation energy.11 Additional investigations on Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts such as doping of a third active metal were also performed to synthesize Ni–Fe–Ru–Al2O3 xerogel using a single step sol–gel method. Both CO2 conversion and CH4 yield showed volcano-shaped trends with respect to the ruthenium content. This indicates that the optimal ruthenium content was required for the maximum production of methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.12 In addition, Kang et al. (2011) also synthesized Nix–Fe1−x/Al2O3 and evaluated the effect of the Fe content on co-methanation of CO and CO2.13 Recently, Pandey and Deo also analysed the effect of supports for Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts. The relative enhancement in yield for the most active catalyst of each series was support dependent, and the maximum rise was achieved when Al2O3 served as support. It appeared that the enhancement in yield was due to formation of a suitable Ni–Fe alloy and the maximum increase for Al2O3 supported catalysts was due to the ability of the support to adsorb CO2.14,15
However, synthesis of Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts using impregnation is hampered by a considerable inhomogeneity in the composition of the supported metal nanoparticles. Alloy particles of different structures, such as nickel-rich face-centered cubic (fcc) alloy, iron-rich body-centered cubic (bcc) alloy, or a tetragonal FeNi phase, can form. In addition, particle sizes are usually large (>20 nm).16 Since the catalytic performance of bimetallic particles is greatly influenced by the structure, surface composition, and particle size, the preparation of uniform and well-dispersed alloy particles with an optimum composition is of great importance for catalyst development. Recently, hydrotalcite-like catalysts containing transition metals as active components have found considerable attention as precursors of various catalysts. They offer access to well dispersed and homogeneous metallic particles after a reduction treatment with hydrogen.17–19
According to the work by Li et al., hydrotalcite derived catalysts deactivated due to carbon deposition were found to be more easily regenerated by oxidation–reduction treatment than catalysts prepared by the impregnation method.16
The main objective of the present work was to combine the advantages of hydrotalcite-like precursors and the synergistic effect of bimetallic Fe–Ni alloys. The synthesis via hydrotalcite-like precursors results in a support that offers stabilizing properties via an oxidic, spinel-like matrix with a tunable amount of Lewis basic sites for CO2 activation. Although reports of hydrotalcite-like materials with different metals are numerous, few studies address Fe–Ni–(Mg, Al)Ox. In particular, such materials have not yet been studied in methanation. The catalysts studied in this work comprise Ni–Fe alloy nanoparticles supported on MgAlOx obtained by calcination and reduction of Ni–Mg–Fe–Al hydrotalcite precursors. We studied the influence of the iron content on particle size, CO dissociation energy, and support basicity and identified the most appropriate amount with respect to activity, selectivity, and stability.
Experimental
Catalyst synthesis
Ni–Mg–Fe–Al hydrotalcites (HTs) were prepared by co-precipitation of the respective metal nitrates.16 An aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (1 M) under stirring at room temperature, and constant pH 10 ± 0.5 of the solution was maintained with an aqueous solution of NaOH (2 M). The resulting suspension was aged at room temperature for 24 h. The precipitate was filtered, washed several times with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C for 16 h. The dried precursor was ground into a fine powder and then calcined at 450 °C for 6 h in a static air atmosphere. Ni–Mg–Al, different Fe/Ni ratios (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) and Fe–Mg–Al catalysts were prepared in order to study the effect of Fe/Ni composition on CO2 hydrogenation. The Ni metal content was kept constant (12 wt%) and the Fe content varied from 1.2–18 wt% depending on the desired Fe to Ni ratio.
Characterization
The catalysts were intensively investigated: total pore volume and specific surface area by N2 physisorption, crystal structures of the precursor, calcined and reduced catalysts by XRD, elemental composition by ICP-OES, chemical states by XPS, decomposition properties via TGA-DSC, reducibility and present species in the calcined catalysts by H2-TPR, basicity by using irreversible adsorption of organic acids and CO2-TPD, particle size as well as alloy formation by STEM and EDS analysis and carbon formation by Raman spectroscopy. The detailed description of the characterization procedures can be found in the ESI.†
Catalytic test
Methanation of CO2 was carried out in continuous flow fixed-bed reactor setup equipped with a quartz tubular reactor (ID 8 mm and porous glass frit). Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (about 370 mg in 250–500 μm mesh size) was reduced in situ with a stream of pure H2 (50 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h or at 600 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture (CO2 and H2) was then continuously fed into the reactor with N2 as an internal standard to account for volume contraction. The feed composition was fixed at the H2:CO2 ratio of 4:1 with 12 vol% N2 as internal standard. The total feed was maintained with respect to the catalytic bed height (0.6 cm) and gas hourly space velocity of 12020 h−1. The catalytic reaction was then performed at 335 °C. Formed water was trapped while leftover reaction products were analyzed using on-line gas chromatography (Scion 456, Bruker) integrated with compassCDS networked software and equipped with three channels: front TCD for H2, middle TCD for permanent gases (CO, CO2, CH4 and N2) and rear FID for hydrocarbons. The rate of carbon dioxide conversion was calculated according to eqn (1), by use of the molar flow rate of CO2 (F), the conversion of CO2 (XCO2) and the total molar amount of iron and nickel (nFe+Ni). (1)
Results and discussion
Physicochemical properties
The values of BET surface area and total pore volume calculated from the N2 adsorption branch are summarized in Table 1. The obtained BET surface area ranges from 22–195 m2 g−1, i.e. an immense difference was observed for the set of as prepared materials. This might be caused by the Fe loading, i.e. the substitution of Al3+ by Fe3+ cations in the brucite-like layers results in a decrease of BET surface area and total pore volume, pointing to a certain extent of pore blockage. The results of elemental analysis are also summarized in Table 1. Elemental compositions are in good agreement with the nominal values (±4%) assumed during the synthesis. Deviation comes likely from the preparation; however, the compositions are accurate enough to distinguish between different catalysts.

XRD analysis

Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of the hydrotalcite precursors. All samples showed reflections at 2θ = 11.2°, 22.8°, and 34.9° which correspond to the d(003), d(006) and d(009) basal planes in HTs. The non basal planes d(015), d(018), d(110) and d(113) cause reflections at 2θ = 38.9°, 46.4°, 60.4°, 61.5°, respectively. The reflections obtained by XRD analysis were sharp and confirmed a successful synthesis of hydrotalcite precursors.20 The layer spacing values for all dried precursors were calculated using Bragg's law and summarized in Table 2. The d-spacing of the (003)-reflection at around 2θ = 11° corresponds to the thickness of one layer constituting a brucite-like sheet and one interlayer. In contrast, the d-spacing of the (110)-reflection at around 2θ = 60° is related to the average metal ion–metal ion distance in the brucite-like sheet.20 The values for d(003) were found to be between 0.7742–0.7908 nm, which is well in line with 0.784 nm for the Mg3Al–CO3 hydrotalcite. For the precursors with relatively low Fe content, the d(110) value was 0.1529 nm, which is slightly smaller than 0.154 nm for the Mg3Al–CO3 hydrotalcite. This might be due to the substitution of Ni2+ for a part of the Mg2+ sites in the hydrotalcite structure, considering the ionic radius of Ni2+ being smaller than that of Mg2+ (0.069 nm for Ni2+ and 0.072 nm for Mg2+ in octahedral coordination).21 For precursors with higher content of Fe, the d(110) value was calculated to be 0.154 nm. For the Ni–Fe/Mg/Al precursors, the (110)-reflection gradually shifted from 60.4° to 59.8° as the Fe/Ni ratio increased from 0 to 1.5. As a result, the d(110) value increased from 0.1529 to 0.1545 nm indicating that Fe3+ cations are incorporated into the hydrotalcite structure to form Ni–Mg–Fe–Al hydrotalcite-like compounds. The estimated cell parameters a and c are also listed in Table 2, and comparable values were obtained to the values reported by Delidovich and Palkovits for Mg–Al hydrotalcites.22

The XRD patterns of the samples after calcination at 450 °C are shown in Fig. 2. The reflections of the hydrotalcite-like precursor were transformed into a pattern similar to MgO periclase and MgAl2O4 spinel. Li et al.16 observed the same transformation into periclase and spinel phases. The complex mixture of elements facilitates the formation of different periclases (e.g. MgO, Mg(Ni, Al)O) and spinels (e.g. MgAl2O4, MgFeAlO4, NiFe2O4, and Fe3O4). A definite assignment of the XRD data is quite difficult due to the very similar diffraction patterns of these compounds. The increasing intensity of the spinel reflections with increasing iron content suggests at first sight that the reflections are due to formation of Fe3O4. Therefore, Raman spectroscopic analysis of the calcined sample of the most active catalyst was compared to the spectrum of commercial Fe3O4. As shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the spectra for the samples are very different, which confirms that Fe3O4 species are not present in the sample. In conclusion, the increasing amount of Fe favors spinel formation rather than Fe3O4.

Crystalline phases: MgO periclase (●) JCPDS 00-043-1022, and spinel (▲). 
For catalysts with relatively high Fe/Ni ratio a reflection around 2θ = 29° was observed, presumably due to residual NaNO3 from insufficient washing during synthesis. However, additional XPS surface analysis and ICP measurements (not shown) ruled out the presence of sodium. The reflections even remained after calcination at 450 °C, although sodium nitrate decomposes at 380 °C. Further XPS measurements also showed no detectable amount of sodium for the calcined and reduced catalyst. In addition, the TGA-DSC analysis (see ESI†) of the dried precursors showed no weight loss above the calcination temperature up to 900 °C. If nitrates had still been present after calcination, a change in weight should have been clearly observed. Therefore, a different phase than NaNO3 has to be considered to cause the reflections, but an extended search in the XRD data base revealed no reasonable match.
TGA-DSC
Thermogravimetric analysis of selected catalysts was performed and the results are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S6). The TGA-DSC profiles of Ni/Mg/Al, Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) and Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5) samples showed the typical two-step decomposition of anionic clays, with transition temperatures at 150 °C for the weight loss due to the removal of interlayer water and at 420 °C for weight loss due to both dehydroxylation and CO2 removal.23 In both cases, the inflection points coincide with the temperatures corresponding to the minima in the DSC traces. The TGA-DSC curves did not change at temperatures above 420 °C, proving that the precursors are totally decomposed by this stage.
The decomposition profiles of catalysts with higher Fe content, i.e. Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 1.5) and Fe/Mg/Al samples, slightly differ from the other three samples. In both catalysts the lower and higher temperature regions exhibited additional features, where various small transitions can be observed. The decomposition takes place in four steps, with the first three at 100 °C (removal of physisorbed water), 265 °C (removal of interlayer water) and 351 °C (dehydroxylation and decarbonation). A broad peak at a higher temperature (ca. 652 °C) in the DSC plot can be assigned to the fourth step. As stated elsewhere,24 this might be due to delayed crystallization of ferrite species (which takes place at higher temperatures) when iron exists in the interlayer, instead of in the hydroxide layers.
H2-TPR
Temperature programmed reduction measurements were performed for all calcined samples and Fig. 3 summarizes the results. The TPR profiles of Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox, Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) and Fe/Mg/Al did not reach the baseline until 1000 °C. Two explanations appear likely: firstly, for Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox and catalysts with lower contents of Fe (Fe/Ni = 0.1), the reduction temperatures of Ni–Mg/Al(O) mixed oxides are higher because of the formation of a MgO solid solution or spinel (observed in XRD analysis of the calcined samples), which is a typical feature of catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like precursors. This implies strong interactions among Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox ions in the catalyst matrix, hindering the reduction of NiO species in the catalysts at a lower temperature. This difficulty of Ni reduction enhances the resistance to catalyst sintering and consequently facilitates retaining a high dispersion and finite size of Ni0. Moreover, complete reduction of NiO species at lower temperature results in the formation of less stable Ni phases under reaction conditions.25,26
 Fig. 3  H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts after calcination at 450 °C: a) Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox, b) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1), c) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5), d) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 1), e) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 1.5) and f) Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox. 
Secondly, the TPR profile of Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox indicates incomplete reduction of iron in the hydrotalcite-like structure.27
In addition, the higher temperature reduction peaks for catalysts with Fe/Ni ratios of 0.25–1.5 (relatively high Fe content) shifted to lower temperatures and indicated complete reduction by 1000 °C. The peak areas also increased gradually with increasing Fe content, indicating that incorporation of iron improved the reduction properties of the HTs-derived mixed oxides.
As shown in Fig. 3, for the Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox catalyst two reduction peaks at about 475 °C and 971 °C were observed, which can be attributed to the reduction of both Ni2+ species from the surface and in the Mg(Ni, Al)O periclase structure. Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) possessed a similar TPR profile to the Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox sample except the high temperature peak shifted to 981 °C. This might be due to the strong interaction of the components induced by the incorporation of Fe into the Mg(Ni, Al)O structure. The TPR profile of the Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox catalyst also exhibited two reduction peaks at 507 °C and 952 °C which are characteristic of the reductions of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and Fe2+ to α-Fe, respectively.28 The lower temperature peaks of Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5 to 1.5) occurred at higher temperature (i.e. 490–544 °C) compared to Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox and Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) catalysts (i.e. 475 °C), indicating the presence of stronger interactions among the different components as the content of Fe increases. In the high temperature reduction region of Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 1), a small peak at 660 °C was observed and its intensity increased with increasing the Fe/Ni ratio to 1.5. According to the literature, this peak could be assigned to the reduction of NiFe2O4 spinel (formation of different spinel-like NiFe2O4 phases was confirmed by XRD analysis). The reduction peaks at 754 °C and 798 °C for Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox with Fe/Ni ratios = 1 and 1.5, respectively, were caused by co-reduction of surface Fe2+ and bulk Fe3+ to Fe0 as well as Ni2+ to Ni0.29
Overall H2 consumption increased (Table 3) for all bimetallic catalysts compared to Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox and Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox; this may be due to the co-reduction of Fe and Ni species due to the formation of Ni–Fe alloy nanoparticles and facilitated reduction of Ni by the addition of Fe. Previous literature reports stated that the addition of iron weakened the interaction between nickel and the support, changed the microchemical environment of nickel and iron species on the surface of the catalyst, and thus increased the amount of reduced species.10

Determination of basic sites by irreversible adsorption of acids
To quantitatively determine the amount of total and strong basic sites of the calcined catalysts, irreversible acid adsorption at room temperature was used.22,30 All catalysts prepared in this study possessed a total concentration of basic sites in the range of 3.00–6.28 mmol g−1.
Furthermore, it is known that the basicity depends on the molar ratio of divalent and trivalent cations (Mg2+/Al3+) in synthetic hydrotalcites.31,32 Consequently, for hydrotalcite-like compounds ([M2+1−xM3+x(OH)2]x+ (Ax/nn−)·mH2O) the content of iron (Fe3+) and nickel (Ni2+) has to be considered as well in order to study the effect on the total amount of basic sites. The reason is that a fraction of the divalent metal ions in the layered double hydroxides (brucite-like sheets) can be isomorphously substituted by trivalent cations resulting in altered amounts of basic sites and charge-compensating anions in the interlayer.20

Table 4 summarizes the effect of the M2+/M3+ ratio on the concentration of basic sites. Higher concentrations of basic sites were obtained with (Ni2+ + Mg2+)/(Fe3+ + Al3+) ratios close to 3 (i.e. 2.93 and 3.22). A further increase in the M2+/M3+ ratio decreases the amount of basic sites. Similar trends were observed in other studies based on the Mg2+/Al3+ ratio for prepared hydrotalcites. Sahu et al.32 and Xie et al.31 determined the total concentration of basic sites by benzoic acid titration using Hammett indicators, and the material with a Mg2+/Al3+ ratio of 3 exhibited a higher amount of basic sites.

STEM analysis
STEM images of the reduced hydrotalcite derived catalysts with different Fe/Ni ratios are displayed in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The average particle size, referring to alloys formed after reduction of the calcined samples at 600 °C for 2 h in pure H2 (similar conditions as used for the catalytic reaction), was estimated using Image J and found to increase as the Fe content increased. Well dispersed, small sized nanoparticles were obtained for the HTs derived catalyst with a Fe/Ni = 0.1 ratio. EDS analysis on a number of particles confirmed the presence of Ni and Fe metals within a single particle, which is evidence for the formation of Ni–Fe alloys. Table 5 summarizes the details of average particle size, the range of Fe/Ni ratio determined using the EDS analysis, and the dispersion.

Elemental mapping (Fig. 4) shows the spatial distribution of iron and nickel within individual particles. The compositions of the alloys were obtained from the EDS analysis (area and spot) on various particles and suggested that the Fe/Ni ratios fell within a certain range. This variation can be interpreted by the formation of particles with higher Fe/Ni ratios than those of the bulk composition, resulting from the reduction of NiFe2O4 spinel in these samples.16 In addition, XRD measurements of the reduced catalysts show the formation of a metallic nickel/iron phase and lattice expansion due to incorporation of the second metal following Vegard's law (ESI† Fig. S7 and S8).

Catalyst screening towards CO2 methanation
Three major influences are considered to govern the performance of hydrotalcite derived bimetallic catalysts. First, the ratio of Fe/Ni is important, since DFT based calculations support synergistic effects for alloys due to a closer match to the dissociation energy of CO which is considered as the rate-determining step.9,33,34 Second, the size of metal nanoparticles affects the preferred reaction mechanism, therefore resulting in different product selectivity.35,36 Third, the amount of basic sites plays a crucial role in the stability of the main intermediate on the surface and the activation of CO2.36–40
Effect of Fe to Ni ratio
Several studies have confirmed that the activity in methanation of carbon oxides can be influenced by the metal ratio of bimetallic catalysts. The addition of small amounts of iron to nickel in the range <50 wt% can significantly improve the activity compared to pure nickel.9,13,15,41,42 The synergistic effect for Fe–Ni alloys can be explained, as shown by Andersson et al., by a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relation. Alloys (e.g. FeNi3 and FeNi) exhibit a dissociation energy which is closer to the optimal dissociation energy of CO, resulting in higher activity since CO splitting is considered as the rate-determining step.9,33,43 Focusing on the first seven hours on stream (Fig. 5), the same trend can be seen for the bimetallic hydrotalcite-derived catalysts herein. Especially in the steady state (Fig. 6), catalysts with modest iron content (Fe/Ni ≤ 1.0) showed better activity than the pure monometallic catalysts. Following the argumentation by Andersson et al.9 that the conversion rate is highest at the optimal CO dissociation energy, our results differ from that prediction in some aspects. The overall trend is still the same but higher rates for lower iron content than the optimal value indicate the influence of additional factors. These factors include particle size among others and are discussed later in this article. Other authors have determined the optimal ratio as Fe/Ni = 0.33 for systems impregnated on alumina.10,44 However, we observed that the use of even less iron (Fe/Ni = 0.1) for the hydrotalcite derived system improved the activity significantly further (Fig. 6).

 Fig. 6  Synergistic effect of Fe–Ni alloys, compared to sole metals, on methanation rate. Addition of 10% Fe in the preparation of hydrotalcite derived catalysts shows improved CO2 conversion rate at 335 °C and atmospheric pressure. The deviation from optimal CO dissociation energy ΔEdiss = |Ediss(FexNix−1) − Ediss(optimal)| (with Ediss(optimal) = 0.06 eV) was calculated according to the method described by Andersson et al. and Greeley and Nørskov.9,43 
Recently, Wang et al. reported quite similar results for pure nickel–aluminum based hydrotalcite catalysts.45 They showed that the subsequent addition of small amounts of iron (Fe/Ni = 0.025 and Fe/Ni = 0.125) increased the activity to the greatest extent, due to enhanced adsorption of H2 compared to a nickel–aluminum hydrotalcite. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the activity can be increased by adding magnesium to a nickel–aluminum based hydrotalcite, resulting in an enhanced CO2 adsorption and improved dispersion of the active metal. However, they did not address the combination of both beneficial effects at the same time. Regarding the selectivity (Fig. 7) of the prepared catalysts towards methane and carbon monoxide, the most active bimetallic catalyst, Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1), enabled a superior CH4 selectivity of about 90%. A further increase of the Fe content heavily reduced the CH4 selectivity and increased the CO selectivity of the catalysts. The sole monometallic Fe/Mg/Al catalysts produce CO, with no CH4 detected as a product. Similar but less pronounced trends were observed in a study on the effect of the Fe content on CO and CO2 co-methanation using Ni–Fe/Al2O3 catalysts.10 Addressing the concept of the optimal CO dissociation energy, the decrease of methane formation with higher iron content can be explained by assuming a strong adsorption due to the dissociation energies, which leads to low rates of removal of carbon and oxygen species from the surface to form the reaction products. On the other hand, for low iron content the adsorption is weaker and the barrier for dissociation is high, but at the same time more hydrogen can be provided to form methane.
 Fig. 7  Effect of Fe content on CH4 (○) and CO (△) selectivity in comparison to sole metals. The highest methane selectivity with 90% was achieved for catalyst containing 10% Fe. 
Particle size effect
In general, the activity of a catalyst is related to the number of active sites. Therefore, the increased activity can be a particle size/dispersion effect on the one hand and/or a structural/morphological effect on the other hand. Exposing more active sites necessarily causes a higher rate of substrate conversion. This concept was already shown for Ru in the case of CO hydrogenation, where enhanced activity was achieved by better dispersion of the active metal particles.37 Based on the findings from the literature,42 CO2 methanation catalysts are also highly dependent on the size of the active metal particles obtained after reduction.
Correlating the particle size obtained from STEM analysis with the measured catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation, it was observed that the catalyst with smallest metal particles (Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1)) was the most active and selective under the current experimental conditions. The catalysts with comparatively smaller metal particles are more active and selective towards methane formation than catalysts composed of larger sized metal particles (Fig. 8 left) due to the presence of more active centers in the former compared to the latter.
 Fig. 8  Influence of metal particle size on activity (left) and product selectivity (right) in CO2 methanation. Smaller particles enhance the CO2 conversion rate as well as the selectivity towards methane. 
The COx hydrogenation mechanism itself is still up for discussion and no consensus has been reached so far.46–49 However, several proposed mechanisms consider that dissociation of CO (being the dominant step) takes place at step-edge sites. DFT calculations support this hypothesis for Ru,50–52 Rh,52,53 and Ni.52,54 Thus, a change in concentration of step-edge sites as a function of particle diameter should affect the selectivity. Although the exact particle shape could not be determined, the change in selectivity could be clearly observed (Fig. 8 right).
Furthermore, in the case of carbon dioxide methanation, several mechanisms propose that the location of active sites for the conversion of CO2 over supported catalysts is either the metal surface46,47,55–57 or the interface between metal and support58,59 (Fig. 9). However, it is well accepted that diatomic hydrogen dissociates primarily on the reduced metal while CO2 mainly adsorbs on the support, where it is activated and transferred to the metal. Assuming a hemispherical model similar to Tada et al.36 with single average particle size and linearly interpolated density, it can be shown that the conversion rate of CO2 indeed depends on the particle size calculated from STEM results. However, the rate shows neither a distinct correlation with the metal–support interface nor with the total surface area. Nevertheless, one can assume that the overall perimeter (the metal–support interface) could be a bottleneck in the reduction of CO2 since carbon dioxide has to be transferred to the metal or hydrogen via spillover to the support. Formulas and calculation can be found in the ESI.†

Effect of reduction temperature
To further investigate the effect of reduction pretreatment on the activity of Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts, two catalysts were selected based on their superior activity and studied by increasing the reduction temperature to 600 °C for 2 h. The results are shown in Fig. 10. The CO2 activity increases 3.5-fold for the Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) catalyst in comparison to the reduction pretreatment at 500 °C for 1 h. However, the activity of the Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5) catalyst only slightly increased for the reduction at a higher temperature. The increase in activity for both catalysts after reduction at 600 °C may be due to the fact that the first reduction pretreatment (500 °C) failed to reduce adequate amounts of Ni–Fe alloy for the catalytic reaction. This can be explained by referring to the H2-TPR investigation, where it was observed that the hydrotalcite derived Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts required higher reduction temperatures.
 Fig. 10  Effect of reduction treatment on the CO2 methanation reaction (reaction conditions: p = 1 atm, T = 335 °C and GHSV = 12020 h−1) a) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) at 600 °C, b) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) at 500 °C, c) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5) at 600 °C, d) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5) at 500 °C. 
The selectivity towards CH4 for the most active catalyst, Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1), could be increased to 99.3% while CO selectivity was lowered to 0.7% when the catalyst was reduced at a higher temperature (600 °C) for 2 h (Fig. 11). The Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5) catalyst also showed the same trend, though with only a small change. In conclusion, an optimized reduction temperature in combination with an appropriate Fe/Ni ratio can improve both methane selectivity as well as the carbon dioxide conversion, respectively.

Effect of basic sites
The nature of the support has also to be taken into account because it not only influences the dispersion of the metal particles but also acts as a catalyst component for CO2 activation. Since the acidic strength of carbon dioxide is comparable to formic or acetic acid, its adsorption can be realized by utilizing basic supports. Consequently, Fechete et al. concluded that a higher amount of basic sites on the surface of catalysts is advantageous for CO2 adsorption and dissociation for reactions involving CO2 as raw material.37
However, the current literature contains conflicting views about which types of basic sites actually enhance the performance. Pan et al. related the enhanced adsorption to moderately basic sites while asserting that strong basic sites have no influence.38 On the contrary, He et al. argued that strong basic sites are responsible for improvements,39 while Aldana et al. assigned improvements to weak basic sites.40
As a consequence, we also attempted to determine the amount of basic sites needed to ensure the availability of COx species on the surface by adsorption. The effect of total basic site concentration on the performance of the catalysts in CO2 conversion is illustrated in Fig. 12. The best activity was obtained by Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1). This might be due to the presence of an optimum amount of basic sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. It was also observed that higher concentrations of basic sites did not provide any further benefit but actually caused a decrease of activity. From the CO2-TPD analysis reported in the ESI† (Fig. S1) it can be observed that the CO2 adsorbed on the strong basic sites needs a higher reaction temperature in order to desorb and participate in the reaction. Therefore, since the reaction temperature was 335 °C, the CO2 adsorbed on the strong basic sites could not be desorbed and then hydrogenated by dissociated hydrogen on the alloy to form formate species and subsequently methane, as suggested by He et al. for Ni–Al hydrotalcites.39
 Fig. 12  CO2 conversion rate vs. total basic sites of the HTs derived catalysts obtained from irreversible acid adsorption. 
However, in this study we could not identify a distinct correlation with specifically weak/medium/strong basic sites and this has to be addressed in future research. This leads us to the conclusion that the system is highly complex and the observed behavior represents the interplay of several properties including active metal dispersion, surface area, COx dissociation as well as support basicity.
Stability test
The catalysts proposed in this work were expected to show not only high activity but also good long term stability under fixed reaction conditions. Therefore, the catalytic activity of Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) reduced at 600 °C was tested during 24 h time on stream in the CO2 methanation at 335 °C (Fig. 13). CO2 conversion remained constant at 80% and CH4 selectivity remained at or above 99.3% during the long-term test. The CO2 methanation by-product (CO) was only produced with a selectivity of less than 0.7% as seen previously. Post reaction characterization by TGA and Raman analysis (ESI† Fig. S9 and S10) showed no carbon deposition at all and confirmed the strong carbon tolerance of the catalyst during the CO2 methanation.

Conclusions
A series of Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox bimetallic catalysts with different Fe/Ni ratio was successfully synthesized by co-precipitation. XRD analysis confirmed that the precursor of the Ni–Fe–Mg–Al catalyst had an HT structure. BET results revealed that both the specific surface area and total pore volume of the HTs derived catalysts decreased with increasing Fe content. This might be due to pore blockage caused by incorporation of Fe. STEM-EDS analyses of the most active catalyst confirmed the formation of small-sized Ni–Fe alloy nanoparticles which were favorable for the methanation of CO2. The HTs derived bimetallic catalysts achieved better activities and higher stabilities for CO2 methanation than the monometallic catalysts. Among the prepared catalysts, the catalyst with the lowest Fe content (Fe/Ni = 0.1) was the most active and selective to methane. The incorporation of iron plays a critical role to improve the activity of the catalysts. For the Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1) catalyst reduced at 600 °C, the CO2 conversion rate reaches about 6.96 mmol CO2 molFe+Ni−1 s−1 at 335 °C with a selectivity of 99.3% to CH4, and remained unchanged for 24 h in the catalytic stability test.
The observed trends of the bimetallic catalysts are in agreement with the predicted optimized dissociation energy of CO, which is the rate-determining step. In addition, the basicity of the support and the metal particle size are key factors to assure a balanced supply of hydrogen from the metal and of COx species from the support to the active centers.
In summary, bimetallic Ni–Fe catalysts derived from hydrotalcite precursor materials are a promising alternative for tailoring the basicity of the support, CO dissociation and improving metal dispersion due to the incorporation of ions in the hydrotalcite structure. The elements used herein are abundantly available and therefore the material is a candidate for being economically feasible even in large-scale application. As a consequence, CO2 can be recycled and greenhouse gas emissions diminished, while excess energy is transformed into a green and eco-friendly fuel with wide application prospects.

 	Fig. 4  STEM images and EDS elemental mapping of reduced catalysts evidence Fe–Ni alloys, since both elements are located in the same particles as seen in STEM images.	 

 	Fig. 5  Effect of Fe/Ni ratio on the CO2 methanation reaction (reaction conditions: p = 1 atm, T = 335 °C and GHSV = 12020 h−1): a) Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox, b) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.1), c) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 0.5), d) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 1), e) Ni–Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox (Fe/Ni = 1.5) and f) Fe/(Mg, Al)Ox.	 

 	Fig. 6  Synergistic effect of Fe–Ni alloys, compared to sole metals, on methanation rate. Addition of 10% Fe in the preparation of hydrotalcite derived catalysts shows improved CO2 conversion rate at 335 °C and atmospheric pressure. The deviation from optimal CO dissociation energy ΔEdiss = |Ediss(FexNix−1) − Ediss(optimal)| (with Ediss(optimal) = 0.06 eV) was calculated according to the method described by Andersson et al. and Greeley and Nørskov.9,43	 

 	Fig. 7  Effect of Fe content on CH4 (○) and CO (△) selectivity in comparison to sole metals. The highest methane selectivity with 90% was achieved for catalyst containing 10% Fe.	 

 	Fig. 8  Influence of metal particle size on activity (left) and product selectivity (right) in CO2 methanation. Smaller particles enhance the CO2 conversion rate as well as the selectivity towards methane.	 

 	Fig. 9  Hemispherical metal nanoparticle on a support. The activity can correlate either with the interface between the metal and the support or with the metal surface area depending on the proposed mechanism.
