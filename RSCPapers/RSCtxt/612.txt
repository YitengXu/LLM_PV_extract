    , Accepted 16th April 2018First published on 17th April 2018AbstractThe synthesis of a new symmetrical A–D–π–A–D–π–A non-fullerene small molecule acceptor MPU3 is reported. MPU3 consists of a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) central acceptor core coupled to terminal dicyanorhodanine acceptors via a thiophene donor and an ethynyl linker. The optical and electrochemical properties of this compound were investigated. MPU3 showed strong absorption in the 600–850 nm range with an optical bandgap of 1.52 eV and the material was used as an acceptor for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells using an A–D–π–A–D–π–A small molecule donor (SMD) consisting of a 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indole (DINI) central donor core and benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor units. This donor has a complementary absorption profile to MPU3. The organic solar cell based on an optimized an SMD:MPU3 active layer afforded overall power conversion efficiencies as high as 9.05%, which is higher than that obtained with an organic solar cell using PC71BM as the acceptor (5.80%) fabricated under identical conditions. Interestingly, the energy loss in the organic solar cell based on SMD:MPU3 is very low, 0.54 eV, when compared to its SMD:PC71BM counterpart (1.02 eV). Low energy loss is an essential feature to achieve high PCE values in organic solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers have potential for light weight, flexibility and low cost power generation through solution processing on a large scale.1–6 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 11% have been achieved for OSCs using BHJ layers based on fullerene derivatives as acceptors with different donors, including both conjugated polymers and small molecules.7–15 However, fullerene derivatives suffer from several drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum, high synthesis costs, limited tailoring of energy levels16,17 and high voltage loss. As a consequence, it is not possible to improve the PCE of fullerene devices further. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, in the past two years a great deal of attention has been paid to the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), especially small molecule acceptors (SMAs),18–31 and this has become an attractive research field for scientists around the globe. Remarkably high PCEs in the range of 10–13% have been achieved to date for single BHJ OSCs based on NFAs32–37 and these have surpassed their fullerene-based counterparts, thus providing enormous potential for application of non-fullerene-based OSCs.
Small molecule donors, when compared to their polymer counterparts, have the advantages of well-defined chemical structures, easy purification, and good photovoltaic performance reproducibility without batch-to-batch variation.38–43 Considering the advantages of SMDs (small molecule donors) and SMAs, the investigation of OSCs based on non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMA-OSCs) is an important topic in the field of OSCs and has potential for low cost large area devices. Recently, OSC-based BHJ active layers consisting of a SMD and SMA showed remarkable PCE values in the range 9–11%.44–46 In order to achieve high PCE for BHJ-OSCs based on BHJ active layers, a broad absorption profile of the active layers, favourable matching of frontier energy levels and suitable miscibility with the counter donor are prerequisites. This means that both the donor and acceptor materials employed in BHJ active layers must have complementary absorption profiles so that the active layer can efficiently absorb photons over a wider range of the solar spectrum and thus generate more excitons. In addition to the above requirements, easy accessibility and purification of the materials used as active layers in OSCs is important in terms of their commercialization. Therefore, it is extremely desirable to develop high performance NFA materials with an easy and low cost synthetic procedure.
In the backbone of donor–acceptor (D–A) π-conjugated systems, co-planarity and good intermolecular π-orbital overlap lead to delocalized occupied and unoccupied frontier molecular orbitals, which is a prerequisite for ambipolar charge transport. Among the various electron-withdrawing units employed to date, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit has been used a building block for SMAs due to its strong electron-withdrawing ability and high polarity. The resulting SMs exhibit wide and tuneable absorption, high mobilities for both holes and electrons, and enhanced crystallinity, all of which are beneficial for high short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) in solar cells.47–51 As DPP is formed from an electron-deficient fused lactam ring, flanked by donors, the frontier molecular orbitals levels and intramolecular and intermolecular interactions can be tuned to achieve desirable electronic and transport properties. Compared to other NFSMAs, DPP-based SMAs gave only low PCE values in the range 4–5.5% (ref. 52–54) and this is mainly attributed to low Jsc and FF values related to low charge transport properties, a high LUMO energy level and poor blend film morphology. Therefore, it is desirable to design new NFSMAs that have suitable frontier energy levels that match with the donor in order to achieve high Jsc, FF and Voc values for the resulting BHJ OSCs.
A fascinating approach to enhance the electron-accepting ability of the SMs is to conjugate them with 3-ethylrhodanine, which has been widely used as a capping moiety in small molecule donors for OSCs.55–57 The presence of the ethyl group not only inhibits the hydrogen bonding associated with non-alkylated rhodanine, but also increases the solubility. Recently, we have designed two NFSMAs with an A2–D–A1–D–A2 skeleton containing a DPP acceptor unit as a core linked to a rhodanine (Rh) acceptor (MPU1) or a dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine–rhodanine (Rh–CN) acceptor (MPU2) via a thiophene donor linker. These molecules were used as acceptors in PSCs along with a D–A polymer or a SM as a donor and PCE values between 6.5 and 7.8% were achieved.58,59
As a continuation of our research work on NFSMAs, we have now designed and synthesized a new A2–D–π–A1–π–D–A2 small molecule (denoted as MPU3, Scheme 1) comprising a DPP acceptor unit as the core, which is linked to a dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine (Rh–CN) acceptor via an ethynyl-thiophene linker.
 Scheme 1  Studied electronic active molecules (MPU3 and SMD as the acceptor and donor, respectively). 
The optical and electrochemical properties of this compound were investigated with the aim of using it as an NFSMA for organic solar cells. In this NFSMA we used the ethynyl group as an additional bridge due to its electron-withdrawing nature and also because it induces a planar conformation on molecules as a result of its cylindrical π-electron density, thus enhancing the intermolecular π–π interactions and facilitating intermolecular charge transport.60–63MPU3 was used as a small molecule acceptor (SMA) along with an A–D–π–A–D–π–A small molecule consisting of a 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indole (DINI) central donor core and benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor units.64 This compound has an optical bandgap of 1.87 eV with HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.27 and −3.21 eV, respectively, and it is denoted as SMD for the fabrication of all small molecule OSCs. After optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratios and solvent annealing time for the active layer, the resulting OSC yielded an overall PCE of 9.05%, which is higher than that of PC71BM-based OSCs (5.80%) prepared under identical conditions. Moreover, the energy loss in the OSC based on the MPU3 acceptor is quite low (0.54 eV) when compared to its PC71BM counterpart (1.02 eV). This is one of the most significant results obtained in the research reported here.

Synthesis of MPU3
Under an Ar atmosphere, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine (4)41 (0.68 mmol, 131 mg) was added to a solution of compound 3 (0.05 mmol, 59 mg) in glacial acetic acid (18 mL) in a two-necked 50 mL round-bottomed flask. Ammonium acetate (2.33 mmol, 180 mg) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 125 °C for 76 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was poured into cold water and extracted with chloroform. The organic phase was washed with NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluent: 8:2:1 n-hexane:CHCl3:acetone) and the solid was washed with methanol to give a greenish brown solid (40 mg, 52%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 9.00 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 8.13 (s, 2H), 7.46 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 4.35 (q, J = 8 Hz, 4H), 4.06 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 4H), 2.76 (q, 8H), 1.93 (s, 2H), 1.70–1.59 (m, 12H), 1.44–1.23 (m, 36H), 1.00–0.80 (m, 30H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 166.1, 165.7, 161.6, 150.1, 149.6, 139.6, 136.1, 133.8, 133.4, 131.8, 127.4, 126.7, 125.9, 114.6, 113.2, 112.4, 109.5, 94.1, 90.6, 56.1, 51.1, 46.3, 40.8, 39.3, 31.9, 31.6, 30.3, 29.8, 29.5, 29.4, 28.7, 28.4, 27.9, 23.7, 23.2, 22.7, 22.6, 14.4, 14.3, 14.2, 14.1, 10.6, 1.17; FT-IR (KBr): ν = 2956, 2928, 2854, 2218, 1720, 1666, 1579, 1544 cm−1; UV-vis (CH2Cl2): λmax (logε) = 628 (4.54); MALDI-TOF MS m/z: [M]+ 1479.22.
Device fabrication and characterization
The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned first with detergent and then ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially for 10 minutes in each step and dried in a vacuum oven for 1 hour. The anode consisted of glass substrates percolated with ITO, modified by spin coating with a PEDOT:PSS layer (40 nm) as a hole transport layer and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. The photoactive layer was prepared by blending the SMD with MPU3 (total concentration of 16 mg mL−1) with weight ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in CF. For solvent annealing, the optimized active layer was placed in a Petri-dish containing CS2 for 10 min. The active layer blend solution was spun on the top of the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 20 s to achieve a thickness of 90 nm ± 5 nm. A methanol solution of PFN with a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was then spin-coated on top of the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the aluminum (Al) top electrode was thermally deposited onto the active layer in a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask area of 0.20 cm2. All devices were fabricated and tested in an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The hole-only and electron-only devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al architectures were also fabricated in a similar way in order to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to give the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and a monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of MPU3
The synthetic route to the small molecule MPU3 is shown in Scheme 2 and detailed experimental procedures are provided in the Experimental section.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic pathway for MPU3. 
Bisaldehyde 3 was synthesized by copper-free Sonogashira coupling of a dialkynyl-DPP derivative 1 (ref. 66) and 3,4-dihexyl-5-iodothiophene-2-carbaldehyde (2).65 A subsequent double Knoevenagel condensation of 3 and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine (4),41 using ammonium acetate/glacial acetic acid as catalysts, gave MPU3 in 52% isolated yield. Compounds 3 and MPU3 were purified by flash column chromatography and their structures and purities were evaluated by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS. Under a N2 atmosphere, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of MPU3 showed a 5% weight-loss with an onset temperature of 370 °C. The solid phase transition properties were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the heating process, a phase transition was observed at 205 °C, which indicates the crystalline character of MPU3.
The structural study of MPU3 was completed by theoretical calculations (Gaussian 09W, DFT-B3LYP 6-31G*); the optimized geometry (Fig. S12†) had a planar structure, with distances between S (thiophene)–S (Rh–CN) and S (thiophene)–O (DPP CO) that were smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the corresponding elements, and with dihedral angles of less than 8°. These values are similar to those obtained for other DPP derivatives studied by our group.58,59

In solution, MPU3 showed several absorption bands in the wavelength region from 350 nm to 750 nm. The absorption band in the shorter wavelength region is attributed to a π–π* transition in the molecular backbone whereas the main absorption band from 530 nm to 750 nm is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units in MPU3. When compared to MPU2,59 the absorption spectrum of MPU3 in solution is slightly blue-shifted (λmax = 628 nm); the broader ICT band with a higher molar extinction coefficient can be related to the additional bisthienylethynyl π-linker (Fig. S10†). This observation indicates that MPU3 has a relatively stronger absorption capacity than MPU2 and this probably contributes to the improvement in the Jsc. The ICT band was significantly red-shifted by 72 nm when the spectrum was recorded in thin film.
The optical band gap of MPU3 in thin film, estimated from the absorption onset edge in the absorption spectrum (Eoptg = 1240/λonset (eV)), is 1.52 eV and this is slightly higher than that of MPU2 (1.41 eV). The absorption spectrum of the SMD in thin film (Fig. 1) showed two strong absorption bands centred at 402 nm (π–π* transition) and 514 nm (ICT band), where MPU3 only showed low absorption. Therefore, the blend of the SMD and MPU3 has a broader absorption from 350 nm to 850 nm and this characteristic is advantageous for the light-harvesting capability of OSCs.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of MPU3, estimated from the oxidation and reduction potentials determined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2), were determined to be −5.61 eV and −3.74 eV, respectively. Both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were up-shifted when compared to those of MPU2 due to the presence of an additional electron-withdrawing ethynyl linker, which resulted in a higher electrochemical band gap of 1.87 eV.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammogram of MPU3 (see conditions in the footnote of Table 1). 
Theoretical calculations (Gaussian 09W, DFT-B3LYP 6-31G*) predicted the aforementioned behaviour (Fig. 3) in the energy of the molecular orbitals. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that both orbitals are dispersed over the whole π-system, thus favouring efficient electron delocalization.
 Fig. 3  HOMO and LUMO electron density distributions and energy values for MPU3 (Gaussian 09W, DFT-B3LYP 6-31G*). 
The HOMO and LUMO levels of the SMD are around −5.27 eV and −3.21 eV, respectively.64 The energy difference between the HOMO of the SMD and LUMO of MPU3 is around 1.53 eV, and this is expected to be beneficial for a high Voc in the resulting BHJ OSC with the SMD and MPU3 as the donor and acceptor, respectively, in the active layer. Moreover, the LUMO offset and HOMO offset between the SMD and MPU3 are around 0.53 eV and 0.34 eV, respectively. These values are higher than the empirical value needed for efficient exciton dissociation (0.3 eV) and both electron transfer from the SMD to MPU3 and hole transfer from MPU3 to the SMD take place efficiently after the generation of excitons in the active layer, although it was reported in the literature that a HOMO offset as low 0.08 eV can be sufficient for efficient exciton dissociation.67
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine SMD, MPU3 and SMD:MPU3 blend films were recorded in order to obtain information about the exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the blend films (see Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  PL spectra of MPU3 (excitation wavelength@624 nm) (black colour), MPU3:SMD (excitation wavelength@624 nm) (red colour), the SMD (excitation wavelength@520 nm) (blue colour) and SMD:MPU3 (excitation wavelength@520 nm) (green colour). 
The maximum absorption peaks of SMD (520 nm) and MPU3 (620 nm) films were chosen as excitation wavelengths. Upon excitation at 520 nm, the PL emission peak of the SMD was completely quenched (91%) by MPU3, which is consistent with efficient electron transfer from the SMD to MPU3. Moreover, the PL emission peak of MPU3, when excited at 624 nm, was also quenched by the SMD and this indicates efficient holes.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of MPU3 as an acceptor was investigated by fabricating solution-processed BHJ OSCs with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al using the SMD as the donor. For the sake of comparison, PC71BM was also used as an acceptor for the reference device. The performance of OSCs was optimized by adjusting the blending ratio of the donor and acceptor and by solvent vapour annealing (SVA). After optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratio in the active layer processed with CB as the solvent, the active layer was subjected to a solvent vapor annealing step in CS2 vapor before deposition of the PFN/Al cathode. SVA was chosen instead of thermal annealing as it has shown superior ability in controlling the crystallization process for small molecules in SM-BHJ-based devices.68–70 CS2 has recently been employed for the SVA treatment of blends of SMs and PCBM to improve the PCE of OSCs71–74 and it has recently been used in SVA for SM-OSCs for which a PCE of 9.58% was reported.75 Organic materials undergo structural reorganization in the solid state (film) during the SVA treatment and this leads to improved photovoltaic performance in the corresponding OSCs. Therefore, we applied SVA using CS2 vapors to improve the PCE of the OSCs (Fig. 5b). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 are shown in Fig. 5a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2 along with the results for the OSCs based on the PC71BM acceptor for comparison (the current–voltage characteristics of the OSCs based on fullerene acceptors are also shown in Fig. 5a).

Having optimized the donor to acceptor weight ratio in the SMD:MPU3 (1:2) blend film processed from a CB solution, the device gave an overall PCE of 3.98% (Jsc = 9.29 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.02 V and FF = 0.42) and this was improved to 9.05% (Jsc = 13.72 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.674) after treatment of the optimized active layer with CS2 vapour (SVA). These values are higher than those for the OSCs based on the PC71BM acceptor without any treatment (2.63% with Jsc = 7.03 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V and FF = 0.42) and 5.88% (Jsc = 10.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.85 V and FF = 0.63) after SVA treatment.
The high Voc value obtained for OSCs based on the MPU3 acceptor when compared to PC71BM may mainly be due to the high-lying LUMO energy level of MPU3. In addition, MPU3-based OSCs afford higher Jsc values when compared to their PC71BM counterparts. The Jsc values of the OSCs are directly related to the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer and, as a consequence, the optical absorption spectra of the SMD:MPU3 and SMD:PC71BM blend thin films with the same thickness were recorded. These spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The SMD:MPU3 film showed a strong absorption from 350 nm to 850 nm in which the main absorption was in the 580–850 nm range because of MPU3, whereas the SMD:PC71BM film only showed an absorption up to 680 nm.
 Fig. 6  Normalized absorption spectra of the SMD:MPU3 and SMD:PC71BM thin films with the same thickness. 
The light harvesting efficiency (ηA) of the blend films was estimated using following expression.76,77 (1)where S(λ) is the photon flux, i.e., the number of photons available at a given wavelength (λ) in the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, α is the absorption coefficient and d is the film thickness of the active layer. The values of ηA for SMD:MPU3 and SMD:PC71BM films were estimated by integration in the range 350–850 nm and 350–680 nm, respectively. The values are around 31% and 48% for SMD:PC71BM and SMD:MPU3, respectively. Since the number of excitons generated after the absorption of photons by the active layer depends upon ηA, the number of excitons generated in the SMD:MPU3 film is higher than that in its SMD:PC71BM counterpart, which results in a higher Jsc for the OSC based on the former active layer.
The higher Voc value for OSCs based on an optimized active layer using the MPU3 acceptor (0.98 V) compared to its PC71BM counterpart (0.85 V) can be attributed to the high-lying LUMO of MPU3 when compared to PC71BM, since in the BHJ OSC, Voc is directly related to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and HOMO of the donor materials used in the active layer.78 It was reported that Voc values of devices increase gradually with decreasing ΔEHOMO (HOMOdonor − HOMOacceptor) between the polymer donor and NFA.79–81 The ΔEHOMO is lower for SMD:MPU3 than that for SMD:PC71BM and this may be attributed to the high Voc value of the former device when compared to latter. The low energy offset, i.e., ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO indicated a low energy loss for SMD:MPU3 when compared to SMD:PC71BM, is beneficial for achieving a high Voc.
The accuracy of the J–V measurements was evaluated by determining the incident photon to current conversion efficiency of the devices (see Fig. 5b). The devices based on MPU3 showed high and broad responses from 350 nm to 850 nm whereas their PC71BM counterpart showed a response only up to 650 nm. The broad IPCE spectrum suggests that both the SMD and SMA contribute substantially to the IPCE and Jsc values, which is consistent with the PL spectrum of the blend film. The Jsc values calculated by integrating the IPCE data with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum are 9.15 and 13.64 mA cm−2 for the devices based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 active layers, respectively, and 6.94 and 10.83 mA cm−2 for the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:PC71BM, respectively. These values are consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurements.
It is apparent that SVA played an important role in improving the photovoltaic performance and the PCE was significantly enhanced by a factor of 2.31 when compared to the sample without SVA, with particularly significant increases in Jsc and FF. Here we are only discussing the influence of SVA on the photovoltaic response for the MPU3-based OSCs. It can be seen from the results in Table 2 that the photovoltaic differences between the as-cast and SVA-treated OSCs mainly concern the enhanced Jsc and FF values, although Voc is slightly lower. The Jsc and FF values mainly depend on the process of exciton generation and their subsequent dissociation, charge collection and charge recombination. In order to understand the influence that charge transport has on the photovoltaic properties, the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 blend films were estimated from the J–V characteristics of the electron-only device and hole-only device, with the resulting curves fitted by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Dark J–V characteristics of (a) electron only and (b) hole only devices based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 active layers. 
The as-cast SMD:MPU3 blend gave a hole mobility of 8.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 2.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the μh/μe value is 3.07. These results indicate that unbalanced electron and hole transport in the cast SMD:MPU3 might be due to the poor nanoscale morphology of the active layer leading to low FF and PCE values. After SVA treatment, both μh and μe increased up to 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the μh/μe value was reduced to 1.50.
This lower value indicates that a more balanced electron and hole transport in the active layer may contribute to the improvement in the FF and PCE due to the improved nanoscale morphology and crystallinity of the active layer. The improved electron and hole mobilities (balanced charge transport) are beneficial to charge transport and charge extraction by the electrode in the OSCs.82
The difference in the PCE values of OSCs based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 mainly lies in the different Jsc and FF values, which depend largely on the processes of exciton generation and their dissociation into free charge carriers, charge collection by the electrodes and charge recombination in the active layer. In order to obtain information about the aforementioned processes in the devices, we measured the variation of photocurrent density (Jph, i.e. Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) with effective voltage (Veff, defined as Veff = Vo − Vapp, where Vo is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vapp is the applied voltage) (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for the OSCs based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 active layers. 
In the case of the SVA-treated OSC, the Jph, after a linear variation with Veff at low voltages, quickly reached the saturation photocurrent (Jphsat) at 0.8 V, which suggests that all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected at the electrodes very efficiently.
However, for the as-cast OSC, Jph showed a more marked dependence over a larger range of Veff and it started to saturate at 1.6 V, which suggests low efficiencies in charge carrier generation or in charge carrier collection, or both, thereby leading to a low FF.83,84 The overall exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcc) were estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jphsat under short circuit conditions and the values are 0.88 and 0.96 for the devices based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 active layers, respectively. Moreover the charge collection efficiency (Pcc) estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jphsat at the maximum power point is 0.62 and 0.81 for cast and SVA-treated OSCs, respectively. The higher Pdiss and Pcc values imply that the device based on the SVA-treated active layer has more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction, which is consistent with the fact that the related OSC has a high PCE. Since at higher Veff, the Jph is independent of applied voltage, we assume that photogenerated excitons were almost dissociated into free charge carriers and the Jphsat is only limited to the total amount of photons. We have estimated the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) using the expression Gmax = Jphsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The Gmax value for the SVA active layer is 1.07 × 1028 m−1 s−1 which is significantly higher than that for the as-cast active layer (0.78 × 1028 m−3 s−1), which is consistent with the IPCE spectra of OSCs based on the as-cast and SVA-treated OSCs.
The variation of Jsc and Voc with the illumination intensity (Pin) was measured in order to investigate the correlation between charge recombination and transport in the BHJ active layer. The variation of Jsc with Pin is shown in Fig. 9a and the relationship is expressed as Jsc ∝ Pinγ, where γ is the recombination parameter. If all the free charge carriers are collected at the electrodes prior to recombination then the value of γ approaches unity, thus leading to weak bimolecular recombination. On the other hand, γ < 1 indicates some extent of bimolecular recombination. The γ values are 0.88 and 0.96 for the as-cast and SVA active layers, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination is effectively suppressed by SVA treatment of the active layer.
 Fig. 9  Variation of (a) Jsc and (b) Voc with illumination intensity for the OSCs based on the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 active layers. 
The variation of Voc with Pin in a semi-logarithmic plot is shown in Fig. 9b and this can help us to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination. When the slope of Voc − log(Pin) is kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and q is the electronic charge), bimolecular recombination is dominant in the OSCs. On the other hand, a slope of 2kT/q implies that trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is the dominant process. The estimated value of the slope in Fig. 9b is 1.46kT/q for the device based on the as-cast SMD:MPU3 active layer and this suggests that the considerable trap-assisted recombination in the as-cast device under open circuit conditions may be related to the poor morphology, which leads to considerable charge accumulation and therefore poor charge extraction. However, a slope of 1.17kT/q was determined for its SVA counterpart and this indicates that bimolecular recombination is dominant and trap-assisted recombination is suppressed.
The influence of SVA on the morphology of the SMD:MPU3 film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (see Fig. 10). It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the as-cast blend film showed two (100) diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 6.49° and 5.98°, which correspond to the lamellar peaks of the SMD and MPU3, respectively, and another diffraction peak (010) at 2θ = 23.12° corresponding to the π–π stacking of both the SMD and MPU3. Both the SMD and MPU3 give rise to similar π–π stacking peaks and it is difficult to distinguish between them.
 Fig. 10  XRD patterns of the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 thin films. 
It can be seen from Fig. 10 that after SVA treatment the intensity of both the lamellar peaks (for the SMD and MPU3) increased significantly, thus indicating an improvement in the crystalline nature of the active layer. We also estimated the crystallization coherence length (CCL) of MPU3 from the full width at half maximum of (001) peak using Scherrer's equation. The values obtained are 12.13 nm and 15.32 nm for the as-cast and SVA-treated active layers, respectively, and these suggest improved crystallinity for MPU3 in the blend films. A similar effect was also observed for the SMD. Moreover, the π–π stacking peak shifted to 2θ = 23.47° after SVA treatment and this indicates that the π–π stacking distance decreased, which is favourable for charge transport85 and consistent with the improved values of both μh and μe.
The bulk morphology of the active layers in the OSCs were analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results are displayed in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  AFM images of the as-cast and SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 thin films. 
The root mean square value (Rq) increased from 0.89 nm (as-cast) to 1.21 nm after the SVA treatment of the SMD:MPU3 blend film and this is probably due to the enhanced intermolecular aggregation effect and increased crystallinity of both the SMD and MPU3.86 As can be seen from the AFM phase images, the as-cast blend film showed poor phase separation and interpenetrating pathways, which hinder charge transport towards the electrodes and lead to bimolecular recombination, thus resulting in a low FF value. However, after SVA treatment the blend film showed a clear phase separation with a domain size in the range of 20–25 nm and this facilitates the charge separation and efficient charge transport in OSCs.
One of the critical issues of OSCs is their relatively high energy loss (Eloss), defined as Eloss = Eg/q − Voc, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the donor or acceptor, with values in the range 0.7–1.0 eV obtained. The energy loss of OSCs originates from the three sources, including the unavoidably large driving force for exciton dissociation (≈0.2–0.3 eV) and additional radiative and non-radiative recombination loss.87,88 The Eloss values for OSCs based on SVA-treated SMD:MPU3 and SMD:PC71BM are 0.54 eV and 1.02 eV, respectively. As the ΔEHOMO for SMD:MPU3 is very low, about 0.36 eV, when compared to that of SMD:PC71BM (0.73 eV), the reduced radiative recombination loss may be attributed to the low Eloss value.89,90
Conclusions
A solution-processable, non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor (MPU3) has been designed and synthesized. MPU3 has DPP as the central core acceptor unit and dicyanorhodanine as an end-capping acceptor unit, with these units joined by a thiophene donor and ethynyl linker. This design leads to a broader absorption in the range 600–850 nm, with a maximum absorption at 694 nm in thin film and an optical band gap of 1.52 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of MPU3 are −5.61 and −3.74 eV, respectively, which make it compatible with any wide band gap polymer or small molecule. A medium band D–A–D–A–D small molecule donor (SMD) consisting of a 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indole (DINI) central donor core and benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor units was used as it has complementary absorption to MPU3. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.27 eV and 3.21 eV, which are suitable for efficient photoinduced charge transfer when blended with either P3HT or the SMD. Photoluminescence measurements confirm that MPU3 has excellent electron-accepting ability and also efficient electron transfer from MPU3 to the SMD and hole transfer from the SMD to MPU3 in the SMD:MPU3 active layer. After optimization of the BHJ active layer (donor-to-acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapour annealing), the devices based on SMD:MPU3 (1:2) afforded an overall PCE value of 9.05%, which is somewhat higher than that of SMD:PC71BM (5.80%) fabricated under similar conditions. In addition to the high PCE, the SMD:MPU3-based organic solar cell showed low voltage loss (0.54 eV) when compared to its SMD:PC71BM counterpart (1.02 eV) and this behaviour is attributed to the low ΔEHOMO between the SMD and MPU3.
