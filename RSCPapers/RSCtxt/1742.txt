    , Accepted 22nd January 2014First published on 23rd January 2014Abstract2,5-Dithienylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (DTTzTz) derivatives have high potential for solution-processed organic field-effect transistors and solar cells, both as electron acceptors and donors. Here, the electronic structure of positive and negative radicals (polarons) of two functionalized DTTzTz materials is studied using multi-frequency and multi-resonance electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in combination with density functional theory (DFT). It is shown that the negative and positive DTTzTz polarons can be distinguished on the basis of their characteristic EPR parameters. The chemically induced polarons are compared to light-generated states observed in a blend of one of the DTTzTz derivatives with a donor polymer. The study gives in-depth information about the spread of the electron or hole in the DTTzTz molecules.
Introduction
Organic semiconductors are intensively researched because of their applicability in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),1 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),2 and organic photovoltaics (OPV).3 Especially for electronic applications requiring large area coverage, flexible materials and solution processability, organic materials may outperform inorganic semiconductors. The electronic properties of organic materials can be fine-tuned through introduction of specific functional groups. While a large amount of small organic molecules and conjugated polymers with electron donor capacity (i.e. p-type semiconductors) have been reported by now,4,5 fullerenes, in particular [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and its variants, are still the most used acceptor materials for organic (opto)electronic applications. Despite their advantages for OPV,6 these fullerene derivatives are costly and have a poor red-light absorption. This motivates the search for alternative small organic molecules with good electron acceptor properties.7
Materials containing thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz) units have been shown to possess high oxidative stability, a good electron accepting capability and a strong tendency to π–π stack.8 The high potential of these molecules in OPV was only recently recognized and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 5.88% and 4.05% for the polymer and small molecule donor materials, respectively, were reported.9,10 Recently, one of our groups synthesized a series of highly soluble functionalized 2,5-dithienylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazoles (DTTzTz) with varying electronic properties depending on the functionalization pattern.11,12 Bottom contact devices made from Th-DTTzTz (Fig. 1) showed a hole mobility of 1.58 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, representing the first significant FET behaviour of TzTz-based small molecules for printable electronics.13 In contrast to 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz (Fig. 1), Th-DTTzTz was found to be easily oxidized by I2, revealing the electron donor capacities of the Th-DTTzTz molecule. Furthermore, charge transfer (CT) was detected upon illumination of blends of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz and the electron-donor polymer MDMO-PPV (poly{[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)]-1,4-phenylene vinylene}), while this effect is negligible for similar blends with Th-DTTzTz.14 Since efficient charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interface is an essential step in the working principle of OPV, electron deficient DTTzTz materials may be valuable small molecule acceptors for bulk heterojunction solar cells.

In order to explore and tune these properties, an in-depth understanding of the respective polaron states is indispensable. Light induced charge transfer in organic solar cells involves the formation of positive and negative polarons as charge carriers. Both negative and positive polarons are paramagnetic. This renders EPR the method of choice to identify persistent and transient polarons involved in charge-transfer reactions, assign their oxidation states and map out their electronic structure.14,15
Here, the chemically induced positive polaron state of Th-DTTzTz and the negative polaron state of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz are studied in detail with multi-frequency and multi-resonance EPR. These experimental results are corroborated with DFT computations and linked to light-induced polaron states in DTTzTz/MDMO-PPV blends.
Materials and methods
Sample preparation
The synthesis of 2,5-bis(4-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene-5-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (Th-DTTzTz) and 4,4′-[5,5′-(thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-2,5-diyl)-bis(4-hexylthiophene-5,2-diyl)]dibenzonitrile (4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz) has been reported elsewhere.11–13MDMO-PPV was obtained from Covion (Mw = 716 kg mol−1, PD = 6.5). Solutions were prepared in chloroform (CHCl3, Acros Organics, 99.9%).
In order to chemically induce the positive polaron in Th-DTTzTz, a drop-cast film of Th-DTTzTz was exposed to I2 vapour for one minute. The drop-casting was done from CHCl3 on a glass substrate under ambient conditions. After I2 exposure, the films were scratched from the glass substrate and the powders of oxidized Th-DTTzTz were introduced in EPR quartz sample tubes. In previous work, we verified that the scratching procedure did not mechanically induce radicals in the DTTzTz materials.14
The radical anion form of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz was prepared in dry THF by reduction of the neutral compound with sodium. After stirring for 2 hours at room temperature under an inert atmosphere, a colour change from red to green could be observed. This solution was then rapidly transferred to an EPR tube and frozen by rapid immersion in liquid N2 and immediately transferred to the EPR cavity for low-temperature measurements.
Drop-cast blend films (MDMO-PPV:4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz 1:1 by weight) were prepared by drop-casting on a glass substrate from a CHCl3 solution (10 mg mL−1 total weight of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz and polymer over solvent volume). The material was collected and transferred to EPR sample tubes.
EPR spectroscopy
X-band pulsed EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometer (at a microwave frequency of 9.76 GHz) equipped with a liquid Helium cryostat of Oxford, Inc. All experiments are performed at 20 K or 4 K (see figure captions). Unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were performed with a shot repetition rate of 1 kHz.
The X-band electron spin echo (ESE)-detected EPR spectrum was recorded using the π/2–τ–π–τ–echo sequence with tπ/2 = 16 ns, tπ = 32 ns, and τ = 200 ns. The shot repetition time was taken to be 1 kHz. Two-pulse ESEEM (electron spin echo envelope modulation) was performed using the same sequence, but now varying the τ-value from 88 ns to 2880 ns in steps of 8 ns.
The X-band Davies-ENDOR (electron nuclear double resonance) spectra16 are recorded using the microwave sequence π–T–π/2–τ–π–τ–echo with tπ/2 = 100 ns and tπ = 200 ns. During time T, a radiofrequency π-pulse with variable frequency and a length of 17 μs is introduced. An ENI A-300 rf amplifier was used. The shot repetition rate was 500 Hz for the latter experiment.
X-band HYSCORE (hyperfine sublevel correlation) experiments17 were done using the pulse sequence π/2–τ–π/2–t1–π–t2–π/2–τ–echo and mw pulse lengths tπ/2 = 16 ns and tπ =32 ns. The time intervals t1 and t2 were varied in steps of 16 ns starting from 96 ns to 6480 ns. The measurements were done at three different τ values (τ = 104 ns, 136 ns and 232 ns). In order to get rid of unwanted echoes, a four-step phase cycle was applied.
W-band ESE-detected EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker Elexsys E680 spectrometer (microwave frequency ∼94 GHz), equipped with a liquid helium flow cryostat and a superconductive magnet from Oxford Instr., Inc. The pulse lengths tπ/2 = 104 ns and tπ = 208 ns and interpulse distance τ = 612 ns were used. For the experiments on the blends, the ESE-detected EPR experiments were performed before and during illumination with the 488 nm (2.54 eV) output of an Ar-ion laser (Spectra Physics) sending 25 mW power into the optical fiber to the sample. These spectra are presented as difference spectra (light-minus-dark) in order to determine the light-induced components.
Finally, for the chemically induced positive polaron of Th-DTTzTz, FID (Free Induction Decay)-detected EPR experiments (π/2-FID) (tπ/2 = 6 μs) were performed at 20 K on a Bruker Elexsys E780 spectrometer (at an operating microwave frequency of 263.01 GHz), equipped with a non-resonant probe. 263 GHz spectra were recorded in the linear sweep mode of the superconducting sweep coil. Absolute field values were obtained by calibration with a Li:LiF field standard.18
Simulations of all pulsed EPR and ENDOR spectra were performed using the EasySpin program,19 a MATLAB toolbox developed for EPR simulations. The HYSCORE data were processed using MATLAB 7 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The time traces were baseline-corrected using a third-order polynomial, apodized with a Hamming window and zero-filled. After a two-dimensional Fourier transformation, the absolute spectra were computed. Spectra recorded with different τ values were added after Fourier transformation to eliminate blind-spot effects.
DFT computations
Spin-unrestricted density functional computations were performed using the ORCA package20 for the negatively and positively charged forms of the DTTzTz molecules under study (see ESI†). Computations were done for the most prevailing conformers, but also for other conformers to check the influence of the side-group rotations. Geometry optimization was performed using the B3LYP functional,21 with an SVP basis set22,23 for all atoms. No extra molecular symmetry constraints were applied during the geometry optimization. For the calculation of the g tensor and principal hyperfine values, basis sets with more flexibility in the core region were used, i.e. the ORCA basis sets EPR-II24 for the nitrogens and protons in addition to SVP for carbons and sulfurs. Since no information on the dielectric constant of the matrix in the powders is available, computations were performed assuming a vacuum.
Results
Positive radical state of Th-DTTzTz
We showed in our earlier work that FET devices based on Th-DTTzTz exhibit a fairly high hole mobility13 and that Th-DTTzTz films are readily oxidized by I2.14 The X-band EPR spectrum of oxidized Th-DTTzTz consists of a single line at g ∼ 2.002 with linewidth 1 mT and no substructure,14 revealing little to no information about the electronic structure and the spread of the hole over the molecule. In order to resolve the principal g values, ESE-detected EPR was performed at 95 GHz (Fig. 2A) and FID-detected EPR at 263 GHz (Fig. 2B) for the I2-induced positive polaron of Th-DTTzTz. The analysis revealed a sharper signal on a broad background signal (g ∼ 2.003) for both cases. The relative intensity of the broad background was found to be batch-dependent (with a contribution ≤ 1/4 of the dominant contribution) and the background signal may stem from a pollutant or polarons in a high local concentration (clustering effects). The sharper signal can be simulated in both spectra using the same parameters (gx = 2.0015, gy = 2.0018, and gz = 2.0030) ± 0.0001 with corresponding linewidths FWHM = (70, 80, and 60) MHz (W-band) and (100, 120, and 70) MHz (263 GHz). It was carefully checked whether the spectra could be simulated with a single contribution, but this was not the case.

Solid black line: experiment; dashed black line: simulation; coloured: individual contributions (red: the major component of the positive polaron, green: broader batch-dependent background signal). The experiments are recorded at 20 K. 
To further analyse the positive polaron of Th-DTTzTz, X-band HYSCORE and Davies ENDOR were performed. The HYSCORE spectrum consists of contributions of low-γ nuclei (14N and/or 13C in natural abundance) (Fig. 3) and of cross peaks related to the interaction between the unpaired electron and 1H nuclei (Fig. 4A). This 1H hyperfine interaction is also detected by Davies ENDOR (Fig. 4B). From the 1H ENDOR and HYSCORE, it is clear that the maximal observed hyperfine interaction is ∼9 MHz (maximum extension of the signal).

In (B) the individual contributions to the simulation are shown below the experimental spectrum. The spectra are recorded at a magnetic field setting of 347.5 mT. The HYSCORE spectrum is the sum of spectra recorded with three τ-values (104, 136, and 232 ns). Similar τ-values were taken for the simulation. The individual contributions were added in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (HA:HB:HC:HD) with the contribution of the Hmatrix/side-chain 4× higher. 
In order to facilitate the interpretation of the HYSCORE and ENDOR spectra, DFT computations were performed. Earlier theoretical work on functionalized DTTzTz derivatives showed that different conformers exist.12 To test the effect of the conformer structure, the g and hyperfine values of both majority and minority conformers were computed (ESI†). The computed g values of both species are in good agreement with those observed experimentally (Table 1: the average g-value (giso) is identical, the deviation between the experimental and theoretical principal values is of the order of 0.001 or less). Based on the fact that the computed principal g values of the minority species of the positive Th-DTTzTz radical agree somewhat better with the experimental data than those of the majority species, it is tempting to conclude that the former conformers are prevailing in the system. However, the accuracy of g-tensor prediction by the state-of-the-art DFT and the magnitude of the deviations are insufficient to make definite conclusions. Note that the computations assumed a vacuum, and that the dielectric constant of the matrix will also influence the g values, hampering conclusion on the prevalence of certain conformers.
Table 1 DFT-computed and experimental principal g values of the negative and positive polarons of the DTTzTz derivatives under study. For the positive radicals, the gy axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane, while gx is along the molecule's backbone. For the negative radicals, the gx-axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane, while gz is along the molecule's backbone. For details, see ESI

To correctly interpret the X-band 1H HYSCORE and ENDOR spectra in Fig. 4, the 1H hyperfine couplings are computed for the positive radical of Th-DTTzTz. The data are listed in Table 2 for the dominant conformer and the corresponding protons are indicated in Fig. 5A. These values were then used as starting values to optimize the simulation of the ENDOR and HYSCORE data (Fig. 4). The final data that match with the experimental observations are also reported in Table 2. The computed proton hyperfine data for the minority species (not reported) were very similar to that of the dominant conformer. The experimental data agree with the interactions of the protons from the thiophene rings HA to HD (Table 2). Furthermore, small 1H hyperfine couplings need to be added to reproduce the central part of the HYSCORE and ENDOR spectra in Fig. 4. These most probably stem from interactions with the distant hexyl side chain and/or matrix protons (Table 2).

Blue represents the positive spin density and red represents negative spin density. Contour levels are set at ±0.0015 (A) and ±0.0012 (B–D). The atom labelling used in Tables 2 and 4 is also given. 
The nearest side-chain protons (HE) are theoretically predicted to bear a large, almost isotropic hyperfine coupling when the side chain lies flat in the TzTz plane, as depicted in Fig. 5A. In the ENDOR spectrum, no sharp, quasi-isotropic signals were found that could agree with the theoretical values of HE for the structure shown in Fig. 5A. It should be noted that the hyperfine value of these protons depends on the orientation of the protons versus the TzTz plane and rapidly decreases if the side chain is turned out of the molecular plane. In the real system, a random orientation of the hexyl side chains is expected, leading to a broad distribution of hyperfine interactions for the HE protons, which would in turn lead to a broadened (and hardly detectable) ENDOR contribution. Indeed, rotational disorder has been reported before for the alkyl chains of polyalkylthiophenes.25 Furthermore, the DFT-computed rotation barrier for a 90° rotation of the alkyl group in the positive radical of Th-DTTzTz is relatively small (2 kcal mol−1) (see ESI†).
In order to understand the HYSCORE spectrum in Fig. 3, the 14N hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole data for the thiazole nitrogens were also computed (Table 3; only the values of the majority species are shown, since the values of the minority conformer are of the same order). The computations predict a non-zero spin density on these nitrogens. In the ESI,† the simulation of the low-frequency part of the HYSCORE spectrum of I2-doped Th-DTTzTz using the DFT-computed parameters is shown. The agreement with the spectrum is fair, showing that the DFT computations predict the spin density distribution in a satisfying manner. Optimization of the parameters was attempted, but none of the attempts led to any significant improvement in the spectral agreement between the experiment and the simulation. This is probably due to the additional contribution of 13C nuclei (in natural abundance) that is not taken into account in the simulations.26

Similar computations have been performed for the positive polaron of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz for which no experimental data are available (Tables 1 and 5, Fig. 5C and ESI†).
Negative radical state of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz
While Th-DTTzTz is easily oxidized, this is not the case for 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz. In contrast, charge transfer is observed for blends of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz and a donor polymer, suggesting that 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz has stronger electron-accepting capacity. We earlier reported14 that light-induced EPR spectra of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz:MDMO-PPV recorded at the W-band reveal a very weak signal downfield from the strong contribution from the MDMO-PPV positive polaron (see also ESI†). This weak contribution can most likely be ascribed to the negative polaron of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz.
In order to chemically induce the negative polaron of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz, the material was reacted with metallic sodium. A weak spin echo was observed at 4 K for a mixture of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz and sodium in dry THF that was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature (ESE-detected EPR spectrum in Fig. 6). The EPR spectrum can be fitted with the g values given in Table 1 (Fig. 6); these values also fit the weak feature in the light-induced EPR spectra of the MDMO-PPV:4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz blend (ESI†).

To check that this signal is indeed stemming from the negative 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz radical, ESEEM was attempted. Due to the weak echo intensity, only two-pulse ESEEM could be performed (Fig. 7). A clear signal is observed at the 1H Larmor frequency (∼15 MHz) corroborating the assignment of the EPR line in Fig. 6 to an organic radical. DFT computations are performed on two conformers of the negative 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz radical (Fig. 5D, Tables 1 and 4 and ESI†). The theoretically predicted principal g values are indeed in agreement with those derived from the spectrum in Fig. 6 (Table 1). The spectral width of the 1H contribution in the two-pulse ESEEM spectrum agrees with the theoretically predicted contributions of protons HB, HC and HD (Table 4, and Fig. 7). Furthermore, signals at lower frequency are observed that stem from the 14N interactions as shown from the comparison with the 2-pulse ESEEM contributions of the thiazole and CN nitrogens simulated using the theoretical hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole values in Table 4.

 Fig. 7  Comparison of the experimental ESEEM spectrum recorded at 4 K of the mixture of 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz and metallic sodium in dry THF (top) with the simulations using the DFT-computed spin Hamiltonian parameters in Table 4. 14N: dashed-dotted line (contribution of N1) and dashed line (of N2); 1H: dashed-dotted line (of HB and a matrix proton [0.6 −0.3 −0.3] MHz) and dashed line (of HC and HD). 
Similar computations are performed for the negative polaron of Th-DTTzTz for which no experimental data are available (Tables 1 and 5, Fig. 5B and ESI†).
Discussion
Although materials containing TzTz units tend to have good electron-accepting capabilities8, chemical functionalization strongly influences their donor or acceptor capacities. This is clearly illustrated by the here studied DTTzTz derivatives: while 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz can act as an electron acceptor, Th-DTTzTz is more easily oxidized.
In the following we will discuss general trends of the EPR and DFT results obtained in the present study and relate these trends to the electronic structure of the molecules under investigation. Since the spectral shape of the measured EPR spectra is mainly dominated by the electronic g-tensor, we start the discussion with this parameter.
Inspection of Table 1 immediately reveals that the average g value (giso) is significantly larger for the negative polarons than for the positive polarons of the DTTzTz derivatives. While the giso value of the positive polarons shows a significant positive shift of approximately 0.003 compared to the free electron g value (ge), the isotropic g value of the negative polarons is almost identical to ge (a slight negative shift of approximately −0.0002). The giso values of negative Th-DTTzTz and 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz polarons are nearly identical, as is also the case among their positive counterparts. Similar trends can be observed for the principal g-values. At least for the two types of molecules studied here, the principal g-values are influenced more by the oxidation state than by structural differences between the two DTTzTz derivatives.
Based on these considerations the light-induced signals in a MDMO-PPV:4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz blend could be assigned. We found that the principal g values of the chemically induced negative 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz polaron matches one of the two EPR signals observed after illumination of a MDMO-PPV:4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz blend. The second signal matches the positive radical in MDMO-PPV, confirming that charge transfer occurs in these blends from the polymer to the DTTzTz derivative.14
DFT calculations revealed that the principal g values depend not only on the nature of the DTTzTz substituents, but are also slightly influenced by the conformer structure. The heterogeneity due to the predicted coexistence of different conformers12 is not resolved in the experimental spectra, and if present only contributes to the EPR linewidth. Although two EPR signals were found to contribute to the high-field EPR spectra of oxidized Th-DTTzTz (Fig. 2), the large batch dependence of the underlying broad signal makes it less probable that this would be due to different conformers of the molecule. The signal may be due to a sample pollutant, although it cannot be fully ruled out that the signal stems from a local high concentration of positive polarons. The experimental and computed principal g values of the positive polarons in Table 1 are similar in magnitude to the ones found for the positive radical in thiophene- and thiadiazole-based polymers.15,26
DFT also allows determining the orientation of the g tensor versus the molecular axes (ESI†), information that cannot be obtained from the present powder EPR data. For all the positive DTTzTz polarons (both dominant and minority conformers), gx (smallest g) and gz (largest g) are lying in the molecular plane, while the gy axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane. The gx axis is approximately along the molecule's backbone. For all negative polarons, gy and gz are lying in the molecular plane, with the gz axis along the backbone. All polarons have one principal g value almost equal to ge, and its axis is pointing out of the molecular plane. This was also found recently for positive polarons in poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT), of poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT) and of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7).15 For all negative DTTzTz polarons, the other two principal g values are larger than ge, while the positive polarons have one g value below ge. This can be used as a fingerprint to identify the polaron state in related TzTz derivatives.
In order to map out local spin densities, the DFT results have been complemented with ENDOR and ESEEM measurements. The latter yielded the hyperfine (A) and quadrupole (Q) tensors, summarized in Tables 2–4. Whereas g-tensors are global probes of the electronic structure, hyperfine values provide information on the spin density at single atoms and nuclear quadrupole values reflect the electric field gradient, which in turn reflects the overall charge distribution. Putting together these different pieces of information the following trends in the spin density distributions may be recognized.
In all studied radicals, the spin density is essentially spread over the central “backbone” of the molecule, with negligible spin density on the hexyl substituents (Fig. 5). Recent work has shown that polaron delocalisation plays a crucial role in the charge transfer process in OPV.27 Inspection of the calculated spin densities (Fig. 5) reveals a number of common trends that are independent of the conformer structure and the nature of the substituents. All polarons have only a small spin density on the sulphur nuclei in line with the small g anisotropy (sulphur has a large spin–orbit coupling). Similar observations were made for the positive polarons of the sulphur-containing P3HT, PCDTBT and PTB7 polymers.15 All positive DTTzTz-type polarons exhibit a strong positive spin density on the central carbons of the TzTz unit, while this is negligible to negative for the negative polarons. Conversely, the sulphur atoms of the TzTz unit have small positive (negative) spin density in the negative (positive) polarons. The negative and positive 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz radicals have a significant positive spin density on the CN-nitrogen (N2), which is significantly larger than the spin density on the nitrogens of the TzTz moiety in all studied radicals.
In Table 5, the DFT-computed proton hyperfine values of proton HD (found in all DTTzTz molecules studied) are compared. We find a negative Fermi contact term (Aiso) for this type of proton for the positive Th-DTTzTz polaron, whereas a positive s-spin density (Aiso value) is found for all other polarons. In general, the spin density on HD is larger for the negative polarons than for the positive polarons, but this difference is much larger in the case of the Th-DTTzTz radicals. This also correlates with the isotropic hyperfine coupling of the N1 nucleus, which is almost the same for the negative and positive 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz polarons (∼0 MHz), but which differs significantly for the positive and negative Th-DTTzTz radicals (0.3 MHz versus −0.4 MHz, respectively). Further studies on other DTTzTz derivatives are necessary to establish whether the spin density on HD can be used as a key marker for the overall spin density distribution in the DTTzTz fragment. Since the HD proton is close to the outer substituents, it is not unexpected that the spin density on this proton is very sensitive to the nature of the DTTzTz derivative (Fig. 1).

Conclusions
In the present study, detailed spin density plots of chemically induced positive Th-DTTzTz and negative 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz polarons are obtained by a complementary EPR and DFT approach.
We show that negative and positive DTTzTz derivatives can be distinguished by their EPR spectra and that the here used level of DFT computation is adequately reproducing their electronic structure. This approach reveals the spin Hamiltonian parameters of the polarons and can be used with confidence to study and predict the electronic structure of related DTTzTz molecules. Moreover, the obtained spectroscopic parameters allow for the assignment of persistent or transient states in these materials. This potential was highlighted by the assignment of the EPR signature observed after light excitation of a MDMO-PPV:4-CN-PhDTTzTz blend. Based on the g values found for the chemically reduced 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz, one of the light induced signals could be assigned to the negative 4-CN-Ph-DTTzTz polaron. The simultaneous observation of this signal and the positive MDMO-PPV polaron confirms the light-induced charge transfer from the polymer to the DTTzTz derivative. Since light-generated polaron states directly reflect functions determining charge transport and loss mechanisms28 in organic optoelectronic materials and devices, detailed knowledge about their structure and time evolution provides highly desired information.
