    , Accepted 7th December 2022First published on 9th December 2022AbstractThe photovoltaic properties and energy loss of organic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are highly dependent on their molecular structures and morphologies. Herein, three NFAs, named F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl with different end groups, are designed and synthesized by adopting π-extension and chlorination modifications. As a result, a favorable morphology is achieved in a PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSC and this system exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.13% with a Jsc of 20.31 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.927 V and a FF of 74.68%. Extending the conjugation of the end group narrows the molecular bandgaps and enables a lower Eloss of 0.686 and 0.706 eV with nonradiative recombination losses of as low as 0.207 and 0.203 eV in F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl based devices, respectively. This work provides an efficient strategy to optimize the molecular structures of non-fullerene acceptors and further improve the properties of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Owing to their merits of solution-processed large-area production and flexible and semi-transparent applications, organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn considerable attention as one of the sustainable solar energy-harvesting technologies.1–7 In the past few decades, tremendous progress of OSCs should be mainly attributed to the invention of novel light-harvesting materials. Among them, the recently developed non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture have attracted extensive attention due to their distinctive advantages of superior charge separation and transport features originating from their unique frontier electron density distributions.8 In particular in 2019, a Y-series acceptor, e.g.Y6,9 emerged as a new-generation NFA, and following this, further chemical modifications to its central cores,10–15 side chains16–19 and end groups20–27 have boosted the PCEs of state-of-the-art OSCs towards 20%.28–33 Fortunately, in view of the vast diversity of chemical structures of organic materials, there is no doubt that more molecules affording performances similar to or even better than those of Y-series NFAs might be designed and efficiently synthesized through straightforward synthetic routes. Hence, further innovative exploration for light-harvesting materials combining both efficient synthesis and high PCEs is not only indispensable for large-scale production of OSCs but also highly important in view of understanding the property–structure relationship.
Generally, subtle changes in the chemical structures of NFAs should induce huge variations in their photoelectric properties and device performance.34–41 However, for these modifications, end group engineering is an efficient and convenient method for obtaining varieties of receptors. And it is one of the key techniques for tuning energy levels and molecular aggregations. Now great efforts are focused on the substitution of halogen atoms on the end groups and asymmetric end groups. Chlorine substitution is a very successful strategy for end group control and could red-shift the optical band gap (Eoptg) and downshift energy levels. The π-extension of the end group can be used in tandem to promote face-to-face packing and increase interplanar π–π electronic couplings and photovoltaic efficiency.42 For instance, the comparison of IC and NINCN was previously reported by the Chen group43 and the Hou group,44 and they found that enlarging the conjugated area of the end group can enhance the molecular interactions and electron mobility. Lately, the Wei group combined the side-chain optimization and end-acceptor π-extension with fluorination to investigate NFAs with BTP as the central core and found that the PM6:BTP-C9-N4F-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 17.0% due to the increased Jsc and Voc.42 Similarly, the Tobin Marks group showed that end group combined π-extension and fluorination is effective in contracting π–π stacking distances, promoting close cofacial packing and increasing BHJ crystallinity via enhanced end group and other intermolecular interactions.38 Recently, the Huang group combined the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and the π-extended end group to precisely tune the electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology, and energy loss (Eloss) by fine-tuning the degree of multi-fluorination.45 As a result, a record PCE of 14.53% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8% for NFREA-based devices were obtained.
Fluorene as a planar and rigid skeleton is widely available and has been applied to the fused ring NFAs by our group to construct a FDICT central core.37 Note that it can be efficiently synthesized and easily scaled up to 10 grams in a laboratory after synthetic optimization. Now, by combining the FDICT central core with different electron-withdrawing end groups, a series of NFAs, e.g., F-2F, F-Br and FDNCTF, have been developed.43,46–48 A systematic investigation of OSCs based on the above F-series NFAs demonstrates rather favorable characteristics of both high Voc and fill factors (FF), leading to very encouraging PCEs of 13.8% and 17.3% for single junction and tandem devices, respectively.49,50 However, we find that the relatively small Jscs caused by their insufficient light absorptions are the major limitation to further improving their performance. Therefore, further enhancing the near-infrared (NIR) absorption of structurally simple F-series NFAs by chemical modifications has been regarded as one important approach to achieving state-of-the-art OSCs and beyond for potential commercial application in the future.
In this work, by adopting combined π-extension and chlorination modification a system of NFAs with the FDICT as the central core was synthesized and investigated. Three A–D–A-type NFAs, denoted as F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl (shown in Fig. 1a), were designed and synthesized. It is worth noting that three acceptors can be easily achieved in a few steps with high yields from commercial raw materials, demonstrating their great potential to meet the easy synthesis requirements for large-scale production. Furthermore, in view of the light-harvesting ability, the onset absorption of F′-N2Cl redshifts significantly towards the NIR region with respect to that of other F-series NFAs mentioned above. As expected, when blending F′-N2Cl with a well-known PM6 donor as the active layer of OSCs, a good PCE of 14.13% can be achieved with a markedly increased Jsc of 20.31 mA cm−2 compared to those of OSCs based on F′-2Cl and F′-NCl (19.43 and 18.03 mA cm−2). Note that the PM6:F′-N2Cl system is one of the most efficient material systems for high performance OSCs based on the FDICT central core, in addition to its advantages in terms of simple synthesis and lower Eloss.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials and thermal stability
The synthetic routes to end group N2Cl and acceptors F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and are similar to those of our previous reports.43,50 The involved reactions are all classical reactions with relatively mild conditions, in favor of large-scale production. The detailed synthesis procedures are described in the ESI† and the chemical structures of the key intermediates and targeted NFAs have been fully characterized and confirmed by their 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS analyses (Fig. S8–S18, ESI†). All NFAs exhibit good solubilities over 10 mg mL−1 in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and toluene, which could be beneficial for solution-processing device fabrication. In addition, based on the acquired thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), all NFAs of F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl possess high thermal stability with thermal decomposition onset temperatures (5% mass loss) greater than 340 °C.
2.2 Light absorption and energy levels
The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of NFAs and PM6 in both chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1b, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. As expected, F′-N2Cl displays the maximum absorption peak (λsolmax) of 710 nm in chloroform solution, red-shifting by 21 nm and 7 nm comparing to that of 689 nm for F′-2Cl and 703 nm for F′-2Cl, demonstrating that the introduction of the π-extended chlorinated end group could work as an effective strategy to construct NIR NFAs. From solutions to solid films, red-shifted absorption could be observed for all NFAs with maximum absorption peaks (λfilmmax) at 738 nm for F′-2Cl, 731 nm for F′-NCl and 745 nm for F′-N2Cl. Note that a ∼35 nm red-shift has been observed for F′-N2Cl from solution to a solid film, much larger than that of ∼28 nm for F′-NCl, suggesting a stronger intermolecular action for F′-N2Cl.51 As a consequence, F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl films show onset absorption peaks (λfilmonset) at 788, 791, and 799 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.574, 1.568, and 1.552 eV, respectively. Note that the F′-N2Cl film displays a highly strong absorption in a broad wavelength range of 500 to 800 nm, which is complementary to that of state-of-the-art polymeric donors PM6, rendering PM6:F′-N2Cl blends promising for efficient OSCs with relatively larger Jsc than those of another two blends.

The electrochemical behaviors of F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl have also been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The derived energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are presented in Fig. 1c and Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of F′-NCl locate at −5.75 and −3.89 eV, respectively. Note that downshifted HOMO of −5.76 eV and LUMO of −3.95 eV can be afforded by F′-N2Cl, giving rise to a much narrower bandgap of 1.81 eV in comparison to that of 2.00 eV for F′-2Cl. The largely decreased bandgap of F′-N2Cl derived from CV is caused by its longer conjugation backbone after π-extension and the chlorination of end group in good accordance with the bandgap obtained from its film absorption edge. The energy levels of F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl could well match with polymer donor PM6, affording sufficient driving forces for exciton dissociation.
2.3 Photovoltaic properties
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of three acceptors F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl, OSC devices with an inverted architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PFN-Br/Active layers/MoO3/Ag were fabricated (Fig. 2a). In the process of device preparation, we screen different kinds of solvents, D/A ratios, additives and its dosage and the post-treatment conditions. Ultimately, the optimal conditions are as follows: chlorobenzene is selected as the solvent and the best D:A ratio is 1:1 with 0.3% DIO as additives. More importantly, the influence of post-treatments of thermal annealing and vacuum showed a quite great difference. After thermal annealing, the performance of the device becomes significantly worse, and three parameters and PCE all showed a downward trend. The detailed photovoltaic parameters for champion OSCs based on F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl are depicted in Table 2 and Tables S2–S5 (ESI†) and the corresponding J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 2b.

As shown in Table 2, the optimized OSCs based on the PM6:F′-2Cl blend afford a PCE of 13.53% with a Voc of 0.917 V, a Jsc of 19.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.63%. It is worth noting that a significantly improved PCE of 14.13% can be achieved by the PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSCs, along with a greatly enlarged Jsc of 20.31 mA cm−2, a larger Voc of 0.927 V and a moderate FF of 74.68%. Apparently, compared to PM6:F′-2Cl, the improved Jsc of the PM6:F′-N2Cl based device mainly originates from its broader film absorption to the NIR region (Fig. 1b). However, the much higher Voc of the F′-N2Cl based device should be ascribed to the reduction of Eloss compared to that of F′-2Cl. In view of the already obtained encouraging results for PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSCs, we further blended PM6 with F′-NCl, which possesses an upshifted HOMO and LUMO (thus a higher theoretical Voc). However, a moderate PCE of 12.63% was achieved by PM6:F′-NCl based OSCs with an upgraded Voc of 0.969 V, Jsc of 18.03 mA cm−2, but a lower FF of 72.31% compared to those of PM6:F′-N2Cl and PM6:F′-2Cl based devices. Combining these considerable PCEs and easy synthesis features discussed above, F′-N2Cl has been proven to be among the best NFAs in F-series for the moment.
The best performance of OSCs based on F′-N2Cl, relative to that of F′-2Cl and F′-NCl, should be mainly attributed to the markedly enlarged Jsc, which is in good accordance with the EQE spectra shown in Fig. 2c. Note that F′-N2Cl based devices display a much broader photo-electron response up to 802 nm with the maximum EQE value of ∼85% for PM6:F′-N2Cl, much better than that of PM6:F′-NCl based OSCs with the photo-electron response limiting to 789 nm and the maximum EQE value of ∼82%. Therefore, the PM6:F′-N2Cl based device affords a much larger integrated Jsc of 19.68 mA cm− compared to that of 17.91 mA cm−2 for the PM6:F′-NCl based device. But for PM6:F′-2Cl based devices, the lower Voc and Jsc are not conducive to the device performance, which are related to voltage loss and light absorption. Note that all the integrated Jsc values are in good agreement with that from J–V measurements and the deviations are within 5%.
2.4 Charge dynamics
To clarify the differences in EQEs and FFs of the three blends based OSCs, the exciton dissociation properties were first investigated by measuring the relationship of the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff). The exciton dissociation probability Pdiss(E, T) could be indicated by the ratio of Jph to Jsat, where Jsat is the saturated Jph at a sufficiently high Veff, and all the photogenerated excitons could be dissociated into free carriers and completely collected by the electrodes.52 As shown in Fig. 2d, the values of Pdiss(E, T) for PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSCs are 97.0%, 96.5% and 97.4%, respectively, indicating more efficient and improved exciton dissociation for F′-2Cl and F′-N2Cl based devices with respect to that of the F′-NCl based one.
In addition, the light intensity (Plight, which varies from 10 to 100 mW cm−2) dependence of Jsc and Voc was also measured in order to investigate the charge recombination kinetics in OSCs, and the corresponding characteristics are plotted in Fig. 2e and f. Among these, the relationship between Jsc and Plight should follow the equation: Jsc ∝ Pα, where α is defined as an exponential factor and could indicate the weak bimolecular recombination if the α value is close to unity.53 As illustrated in Fig. 2e, the α values of the three devices based on PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl are estimated to be 0.990, 0.980 and 0.982, respectively, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is significantly suppressed in three systems. Additionally, the slope (nkT/q) of Vocversus the natural logarithm of Plight is usually regarded as the indicator to reflect the charge recombination properties in OSCs under open-circuit conditions.54 As depicted in Fig. 2f, PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl based devices exhibit the slopes of 1.28, 1.22 and 1.23kT/q, respectively. The smaller slopes of F′-N2Cl based devices suggest a lower amount of trap-assisted recombination losses, which should account for the slightly larger Jsc with respect to that of PM6:F′-2Cl based devices.
Transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were also applied to monitor the charge extraction behaviors and charge carrier lifetimes, respectively. As it can be observed from Fig. S4a (ESI†), the charge extraction time of PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl based devices is 0.18, 5.77 and 1.47 μs, respectively, indicating that three systems show different charge transport properties with PM6:F′-2Cl and PM6:F′-N2Cl based devices showing even better properties. For TPV tests, a rapid voltage decay usually suggests a large charge recombination in OSCs.55 As shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), the lifetime of charge carriers in the F′-NCl based device is calculated to be 0.54 ms, whereas much prolonged lifetimes of 1.57 and 2.15 ms are observed in PM6:F′-2Cl and PM6:F′-N2Cl based devices, respectively. It indicates that the carrier recombination is greatly inhibited in F′-2Cl and F′-N2Cl based devices especially for that of PM6:F′-N2Cl, which is in agreement with the suppressed trap-assisted recombination observed in Fig. 2f. Moreover, charge transport properties of the blended films were further investigated by the method of space-charge-limited-current (SCLC). The detailed plots and parameters are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†). PM6:F′-2Cl and PM6:F′-N2Cl photoactive layers exhibit overall ungraded hole/electron mobility (μh/μe) of 1.68 × 10−5/3.45 × 10−4 and 1.01 × 10−4/3.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, better than that of PM6:F′-NCl based blends (0.96 × 10−5/2.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The enlarged hole and electron mobility of F′-2Cl and F′-N2Cl based devices should contribute to their improved Jsc and FF. Note that the PM6:F′-N2Cl blended films afford a higher and more balanced electron/hole mobility ratio than that of PM6:F′-NCl blended films, which should be responsible for the simultaneously enhanced Jsc and FF of PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSCs.
To sum up, F′-N2Cl based devices possess a slightly improved exciton dissociation efficiency, better charge carrier transport properties and a lower degree of charge recombination with respect to those of F′-2Cl and F′-NCl based devices. We also found that a suppressed charge recombination and more balanced hole/electron mobility can be achieved, resulting in further improved Jsc and FF for PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSCs with respect to those of PM6:F′-2Cl and PM6:F′-NCl based ones.
2.5 Morphology analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technologies were employed to explore the morphology and stacking structure of these four materials in the blend film and further analyze the differences in their morphologies. As observed from the AFM images in Fig. 3a–c, these blended films all exhibited nanoscale phase separation. And the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl blend films can be determined as 1.65, 1.59 and 1.44 nm, respectively. The blend films with great π-conjugation end groups show clear domain sizes among these three materials. Note that PM6:F′-N2Cl blend films exhibit the most uniform and smooth upper surface topographies than that of the other two films, which could ensure the intimate contact with the charge transport layers and thus the efficient charge transfer at the interface.56Fig. 3d–f displayed the TEM images of these three blend films, demonstrating clear fiber structures and nanoscale phase separation in three blends, especially for a more dense film of PM6:F′-N2Cl. In fact, the strategy of greater conjugation end groups should break the high crystallinity and avoid the formation of excessively large molecules, which is conducive to form better phase separation. This conclusion is further demonstrated in the GIWAX data. This finding explains the difference in charge recombination and thus the change in Jsc and FF parameters.42

In order to further provide a deeper insight into the effects of π-extension and chlorination of F′-N2Cl on its molecular packing, the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. The resulting 2D GIWAXS patterns and 1D profiles of all pristine NFAs and blends investigated are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). The crystallization ability of the three materials in the pure film was almost the same. As shown in Fig. S6a–d (ESI†) and Table 3, three neat films all exhibit a more preferential face-on orientation, indicated by the stronger (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. Among them, the diffraction rings of F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl films located at qz of 1.79, 1.78 and 1.81 Å−1 are preferentially stronger in the OOP direction, which are attributed to the (010) π–π stacking within acceptors crystals.57 And corresponding to the π–π stacking distance (d010) are 3.50, 3.52 and 3.48 Å, respectively. More important, both the CCL010 in OOP and CCL100 in IP of F′-N2Cl films are larger than those of F′-2Cl and F′-NCl, indicating a stronger crystallinity of acceptor F′-N2Cl. As a result, the molecular packing is getting more compact after π-extension and chlorination, thus leading to a larger red-shifted absorption, improved charge transport and suppressed charge carrier recombination as discussed above.

As for the blend films of PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl in Fig. 4a–d, the predominant face-on orientation of NFAs’ molecular packing were preserved. But in the blend films, their regulated capacity with crystallization was different. As summarized in Table 3, the (010) peaks of PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl are located at 1.77, 1.75 and 1.79 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance (d010) of 3.55, 3.58 and 3.51 Å, respectively. Quite different from PM6:F′-2Cl and PM6:F′-NCl blends, a clear diffraction peak belonging to (11 − 1) located at 0.46 Å−1 indicates a stronger interaction between PM6 and F′-N2Cl. And according to the coherence lengths of the π–π stacking (CCL010) for PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl blends were obtained based on the Scherrer equation (CCL = 2πk(FWHM)), being 19.44, 25.04 and 26.80 Å, respectively. The slightly enlarged CCL in the PM6:F′-N2Cl blend compared to those of PM6:F′-2Cl and PM6:F′-NCl should be caused by the higher crystallinity of F′-N2Cl, resulting in better electron transport properties, more suppressed charge recombination and thus improved Jsc and FF of the devices.58

loss analysis
To disclose the inner relationship of structure–energy loss, we analysed Eloss of each OSCs based on the detailed balance theory.59 According to the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, Eloss in OSCs contains three parts, as shown in the following formula:21  
Among them, Egs of OSCs could be estimated from the intersection of the optical absorption and EL curves of the corresponding blends,60 being 1.642 eV for PM6:F′-2Cl, 1.655 eV for PM6:F′-NCl and 1.633 eV for PM6:F′-N2Cl blends (Fig. S7a–c, ESI†). Thus, the total Elosss of OSCs can be calculated based on the following equation: Eloss = (Eg − qVoc), being 0.725, 0.686 and 0.706 eV for PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl, respectively, demonstrating a great reduction of Eloss after adopting π-extension backbone in the F′-N2Cl acceptor, as shown in Table 4.

In order to gain a deeper insight into the origin of Eloss in OSCs studied here, all the three parts of Elosss have been evaluated. The detailed calculation method of three parts is depicted in the ESI.† Among them, ΔE1 is the radiative loss above bandgap and is unavoidable in all types of solar cells. The values of ΔE1 are determined by the energy offset between Eg of OSCs and qVoc in the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit (qVSQoc), which have been calculated as 0.277, 0.278 and 0.277 eV for PM6:F′-2Cl, PM6:F′-NCl and PM6:F′-N2Cl based OSCs, respectively. ΔE2 represents the radiative loss below the bandgap and can be evaluated by the energy offset between qVSQoc and qVoc in the radiative limit (qVradoc). Note that relatively smaller ΔE2 of 0.157 and 0.131 eV has been achieved by PM6:F′-N2Cl and PM6:F′-NCl based OSCs with respect to that of 0.165 eV for PM6:F′-2Cl based one. ΔE3 indicates the non-radiative energy loss and reflects the energy offset between qVradoc and qVoc existing in the real OSCs. The greatly suppressed non-radiative recombination with much reduced ΔE3 of 0.272 and 0.277 eV has been achieved by PM6:F′-N2Cl and PM6:F′-NCl based OSCs, respectively, in sharp comparison to that of 0.283 eV for PM6:F′-2Cl (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the reduced ΔE3 for three based OSCs could be further confirmed by their much higher external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) as shown in Fig. 5c. Therefore, the lower energy losses achieved by F′-N2Cl based OSCs should be ascribed to the suppressed recombination especially for the non-radiative recombination.

Non-radiative recombination loss (ΔEnon-radloss) and energetic disorder, which are closely related to the tail states below the band edge and the over-all photon energy loss, need to be minimized to improve device performance.60 In the range of low photon energy, the optical absorption coefficient (α(E)) of disordered organic semiconductors follows the Urbach rule as described by the following formula:61α(E) = α0e[(E−E0)/EU]where the two constants of α0 represents the optical absorption coefficient at the band edge, E is the photon energy, EU represents the Urbach energy which is usually described as a measure of energetic disorder.62 Generally, a smaller EU indicates a smaller degree of energy disorder, which should be in favor of the reduction of recombination losses in OSCs.63 As shown in Fig. 5b, according to the measured high-resolution Fourier transform photocurrent spectra and EQE spectra (FTPS-EQE), PM6:F′-N2Cl and PM6:F′-NCl based devices afford slightly smaller EUs of 30.3 and 31.2 meV, respectively, compared to 32.4 meV of the PM6:F′-2Cl based one. Note that the slightly reduced EU of PM6:F′-N2Cl in comparison with that of PM6:F′-NCl was also confirmed by its sharper absorption onset (Fig. 1b) and slightly enlarged CCL (Table 3).13 The more ordered and compact molecular stacking of F′-N2Cl should significantly reduce energetic disorder and thus mitigate the recombination loss of OSCs.63–65
3. Conclusion
A series of NFAs with FDIC12T as the central core such as F′-2Cl, F′-NCl and F′-N2Cl was reported. Because of the combined π-extension and chlorination, F′-N2Cl shows a red-shifted absorption close to 800 nm and tighter molecular packing. And compared to F′-2Cl and F′-NCl, the π-extension and chlorination of acceptor F′-N2Cl lead to an upshifted HOMO energy level and an enhanced crystallization tendency. The PM6:F′-N2Cl based device exhibited the highest PCE of 14.13% due to the increased Jsc. The system of PM6:F′-N2Cl showed excellent absorption and minimal recombination loss. The Voc trend in these devices is consistent with their Eloss. When the end group was extended and chlorinated, Eloss can be reduced to 0.686 eV and 0.706 eV, smaller than that of the F′-2Cl based device. The results confirmed that the combination of extending the end group and chlorination effectively improves the morphology of the active layer, weakens the self-aggregation of the polymer donor, and enhances the performance of the device. The efficient strategy of integrated regulation to design highly efficient NFAs optimizes their crystallization in blend films with a low nonradiative recombination loss. This work will stimulate further innovative explorations for active materials with both high efficiency and simple synthesis, aiming to boost OSCs towards commercial application in the near future.
