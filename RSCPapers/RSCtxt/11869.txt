    , Accepted 6th June 2019First published on 8th June 2019AbstractUltrathin oxide films are technologically important for electronics, sensors and catalysis. When the film thickness is below some characteristic value, exotic electronic properties and catalytic behaviors would emerge. Understanding the thickness dependency of activity is crucial for controlling the catalytic performance of oxide films. Herein, we exploited two-dimensional (2D) zinc oxide (ZnO), whose freestanding sheets are available in the laboratory, as a prototype system for CO2 photoreduction. The evolution of structures and photocatalytic properties of ZnO sheets with the number of layers from one to eight is unveiled by first-principles calculations. Distinct from their bulk counterpart, the graphene-like non-polar structures of ZnO ultrathin films endow electron-accumulated surfaces. Not only do they have favorable band edge positions and optical absorbance, but the 2D ZnO sheets can also provide active sites for CO2 reduction with selectivity intrinsically depending on the number of layers and activity being correlated to the O 2p band center. The present results offer a universal strategy for tailoring the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of ultrathin films of metal oxides and other semiconductor compounds by adjusting the number of layers and taking advantage of the quantum confinement effect.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, human beings are facing severe global warming crisis from the greenhouse gases produced by the ongoing burning of fossil fuels. One compelling solution is to develop artificial photosynthesis systems to convert carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, to fuels and chemicals.1 However, the criterion to be an efficient photocatalyst is stringent, which requires both outstanding optical responses and high catalytic activities.2 Semiconducting metal oxides such as TiO2, WO3 and ZnO are commonly used for CO2 photoreduction owing to their good stability and low cost.3–5 Although various nanostructures of metal oxides have been made to improve the CO2 conversion efficiency, they still suffer from low activity, poor selectivity or low visible-light utilization, and thus are limited to commercial applications.6,7
Sculpturing metal oxides into atomic thin films and even monolayers opens great opportunities for developing functional materials for energy conversion. The electron confinement and large surface-to-volume ratio endow 2D metal oxides with exotic physicochemical properties, such as abundant active sites, subnanometer thickness beneficial for light harvesting and charge carrier transport, and highly tunable electronic band structures by tuning the thickness or facets.8–10 Moreover, they are naturally oxidation resistant and have superior stability in the atmosphere, and now can be facilely synthesized by either the “top-down” or “bottom-up” approach from the earth-abundant metal oxides, inexpensive precursors or templates.8,11–14 Therefore, 2D metal oxides constitute a big family of potential photocatalytic materials.
Among them, 2D ZnO sheets are non-toxic with high thermal and chemical stabilities (sustaining 800 °C in ambient environment15). Bulk ZnO crystal is known to have a wurtzite structure in standard conditions with a direct band gap of 3.37 eV.16 According to previous first-principles calculations,17–19 when the thickness is reduced to a few layers—around 8 layers, the ZnO film transforms into a non-polar graphene-like structure (g-ZnO). In experiment, ultrathin g-ZnO sheets down to monolayer thickness have been grown on various metal substrates such as Ag(111), Au(111) and Pd(111) surfaces, as well as on graphene.20–24 Moreover, freestanding monolayer and few-layer g-ZnO were synthesized by using graphene oxide templates, suspended in graphene pores, or by the oxidation of ultrathin zinc chalcogenide nanosheets, allowing the assessment of the intrinsic properties of g-ZnO.15,25,26 Both experimental and theoretical studies demonstrated that the electronic band structures of g-ZnO, including band gap and onset energy of the conduction band, are highly dependent on the number of layers.27–29
Not only the band structure, but the surface chemistry properties are also quite distinct for bulk wurtzite ZnO and g-ZnO. The bulk ZnO(0001) polar surface terminated with Zn atoms can strongly chemisorb CO2 molecules with adsorption energies of −1.09 to −1.55 eV.30,31 The freestanding g-ZnO monolayer was predicted to only weakly interact with CO2 with adsorption energy less than −0.30 eV.32 Previous experiments have shown that ZnO crystals are able to photocatalyze CO2 reduction to produce methanol, while ZnO nanosheets lead to the formation of carbon monoxide and methane.4,33–36 It is known that ultrathin metal films, such as Cu overlayers on Au(111) or Pt(111) substrates for the electrochemical reduction of CO2, have tunable activity and selectivity by controlling the film coverage and thickness.37–40 For semiconductor ultrathin films, however, thickness engineering of the photocatalytic properties at atomic level is rarely reported. As an eco-friendly and economical semiconductor with superior stability and controllable number of layers in the laboratory, 2D ZnO sheets serve as an ideal model for such explorations.
For the first time, herein we investigate the evolution of atomic structures, key electronic properties, and photocatalytic behaviors of ZnO for CO2 reduction with water, as the material thickness reduces from bulk to atomic thin layers. Our first-principles calculations disclose the distinct catalytic properties of the 2D graphene-like ZnO sheets with regard to the polar wurtzite form, with tunable selectivity by the number of layers. The thickness-dependent electronic band structures, interlayer coupling and charge distribution are probed to illuminate how the quantum confinement effect precisely influences the surface states and adsorption properties of these ZnO ultrathin sheets. The key factors dictating the binding strength of the molecules and reaction intermediates on the ZnO sheets are derived to provide an explicit activity–band structure relationship, as universal guidelines for tailoring the photocatalytic performance of the thin films of metal oxides and compound semiconductors.
2. Computational methods
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),41 using a planewave basis set with energy cutoff of 500 eV, the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials for ion–electron interaction,42 and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange and correction functional.43 Grimme's semiempirical DFT-D3 scheme of dispersion correction was adopted to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in layered materials.44 The Brillouin zone was sampled by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a Γ-centered grid of 16 × 16 × 1 for primitive unit cells and 3 × 3 × 1 for the supercells, respectively.
We considered the ZnO films composed of monolayer to eight Zn–O layers cleaved from the bulk ZnO(0001) surface of the wurtzite phase. The vacuum thickness in the perpendicular direction was set to 20 Å to avoid the interactions between replica images. The unit cells were fully optimized for both cell and ionic degrees of freedom, with energy and force convergence criteria of 10−4 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. Based on the PBE-optimized equilibrium structures, the electronic band structures and optical absorption spectra of the 2D ZnO sheets were calculated using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional with VASP.45 The partial charge density and bond order were calculated by Mulliken population analysis46 implemented in the CASTEP code with the PBE functional, the planewave basis with energy cutoff of 900 eV, and the norm-conserving pseudopotentials.47
To explore the catalytic properties, we adopted a supercell consisting of 4 × 4 ZnO unit cells with lateral dimensions of 13.16–13.64 Å. The adsorption energies of molecules involved in the CO2 reaction are defined as ΔE = Etotal − EZnO − Emol(1)where Etotal and EZnO are the total energies of the ZnO sheets with and without adsorption of the molecule, and Emol is the energy of the free molecule in vacuum. Within the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, the chemical potential of a proton–electron pair is equal to that of half a H2 gas molecule.48 The Gibbs free energy of formation for each elementary step of CO2 reduction is computed as ΔG = ΔEDFT + ΔZPE − TΔS(2)where ΔEDFT, ΔZPE and ΔS are the differences in DFT total energy, zero-point energy and entropy of the two states before and after reaction, respectively; temperature T is set to 298 K in our study. The ΔZPE and ΔS values of the gaseous molecules were obtained from the NIST-JANAF thermodynamics table.49 Energy corrections of −0.51 and −0.49 eV were added to the gas-phase CO and CH2O molecules, respectively, due to the systematic error of DFT calculations with the PBE function, and this way the computed thermochemical reaction energies of CO2 reduction to various C1 products were consistent with the experimental values.48,50,51 For the reaction intermediates, we calculated their vibrational frequencies and derived ΔZPE and ΔS using the thermodynamic model within the harmonic approximation (Table S1 of ESI†).52
The catalytic activity is characterized by the limiting potential UL, defined as the lowest potential (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) at which all the reaction steps are downhill in free energy,48,50,53,54 and equal to UL = −ΔGmax/e(3)where ΔGmax is the maximum Gibbs free energy of formation in the reaction steps of CO2 reduction, and e is the elementary charge. UL is a prerequisite parameter commonly used to measure the activity of photo- or electro-catalysts in aqueous conditions from the thermodynamic aspect and neglect the kinetic process. According to our test calculations, the limiting potentials from the free energy calculations generally predict the same trend of activity and selectivity for the 2D ZnO sheets as that obtained from kinetic barriers. The detailed results are presented in Fig. S1 of ESI.† The solvent effect has been shown to stabilize the adsorbed intermediates by 0.1–0.25 eV,55 which is relatively minor and may be cancelled out among various intermediate species in the elementary steps. Considering the high computational cost of the multilayer ZnO sheets (up to 256 atoms in the supercell), the solvent effect was neglected here and would be the topic of our future study.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structures and electronic properties of ZnO(nL)
First, we examine the structure of the ZnO sheets as a function of number of layers n (hereafter these systems are denoted as ZnO(nL)). Their geometrical parameters, and energetic and electronic properties are presented in Tables 1, S2 and S3 of ESI.† For n = 1–7, freestanding monolayer and few-layer ZnO films favor a planar graphene-like structure (Fig. 1a and b). The lattice constant in the lateral dimension increases with thickness from 3.29 Å for ZnO(1L) to 3.41 Å for ZnO(7L). From n = 8, the ZnO sheet starts to recover the wurtzite structure with buckling height of 0.35 Å (Fig. 1c and S2 of ESI†), which is in good agreement with previous DFT calculations.19 The lattice constant drops to 3.34 Å for ZnO(8L), approaching the value of the bulk ZnO(0001) surface (3.28 Å from our calculation). On the other hand, the vertical Zn–O distance between the neighboring layers decreases from 2.37 Å for ZnO(2L) to 2.15 Å for ZnO(8L), which is still larger than the bulk value (2.01 Å). The intralayer Zn and O atoms form strong bonds with Mulliken bond order of 1.13 to 1.25, while the Zn–O bonds between adjacent layers are much weaker with the bond order of −0.03 to 0.04. For both directions, bond order increases with the number of layers. As revealed by the electron localization function in Fig. 7d, the Zn–O bonds exhibit high ionicity with prominent electrons localized on the O atoms.

(c) Side view of bulk wurtzite ZnO, with the (0001) orientation along the c axis. The dashed box indicates the dimensions of a unit cell projected on the b–c plane. The Zn and O atoms are shown in blue and red colors, respectively. 
The electronic band structures and density of states (DOS) of 2D and bulk ZnO calculated using the HSE06 functional are displayed in Fig. 2 and S3 of ESI.† The band gap decreases as the number of layers increases, i.e. from 3.13 eV for ZnO(1L) to 2.63 eV for ZnO(7L), gradually approaching the theoretical value of bulk ZnO (2.32 eV). On the other hand, ZnO(8L) shows a metallic behavior, similar to a wurtzite ZnO slab with the (0001) and (000) polar surfaces exposed.56 Note that the band gap of bulk ZnO computed by the HSE06 functional is still moderately lower than the experimental value (3.37 eV for the wurtzite phase),16 while the band gap from the PBE functional is even lower than the HSE06 gap by about 1.5 eV (Fig. 2d). In the following discussions, one has to be aware of the systematic underestimation of band gaps. As revealed by the projected DOS in Fig. 2, ZnO(nL, n ≤ 7) sheets are sp2 hybridized with the O 2pz and Zn 4pz orbitals forming π and π* states.29 The top valence band (π state) and bottom conduction band (π* state) are dominated by the O 2pz orbitals and Zn 4pz orbitals, respectively.

(d) Band gap (Eg) of ZnO(nL) sheets vs. the number of layers predicted by the HSE06 functional and PBE functional, in comparison with the experimental data.27 The blue and red dashed lines indicate the experimental and calculated (by the HSE06 functional) band gap of bulk ZnO, respectively. 
Naturally, the energetic stability of 2D ZnO enhances with increasing film thickness. The formation energy relative to bulk ZnO reduces from 0.74 eV for ZnO(1L) to 0.26 eV for ZnO(8L) per formula unit (Table S2 of ESI†). To assess the thermal stability of these ZnO ultrathin films, we performed ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations at 300 K. Taking the ZnO(3L) film as a representative, it well maintains the planar structure during the entire AIMD simulation, and only shows slight buckling with an average vertical displacement of atoms of less than 0.18 Å from their equilibrium positions for 10 ps (Fig. S4 of ESI†). Indeed, previous experiments demonstrated the excellent stability of the freestanding ZnO nanosheets at 800 °C in ambient environment.15 Therefore, the 2D ZnO systems have robust layered structures for practical and even harsh-environment applications.
3.2. Molecular adsorption on ZnO(nL)
The activation of CO2 is critical for catalytic CO2 reduction. Thus, we investigated the adsorption of a CO2 molecule on ZnO(nL) with n = 1–8. The molecule was initially placed at >1.6 Å above the film surface. For all the considered systems, the CO2 molecule is chemisorbed on the ZnO sheets upon structural optimization. The most stable adsorption state is the tridentate configuration, as illustrated by Fig. 3c. The C atom of CO2 is strongly bonded to the O atom of ZnO with a bond length of 1.39–1.44 Å. The two O atoms of CO2 are weakly bonded to the Zn atoms with distances of about 2.10 Å. The adsorbed CO2 molecule has elongated C–O bond lengths of about 1.27 Å compared to 1.16 Å for the gas phase, and the molecule is substantially bent with an O–C–O angle of 128°, signifying its activation by the ZnO sheets. Overall, the binding strength of CO2 enhances with film thickness—the adsorption energy drops from 0.04 eV for ZnO(1L) to −0.95 eV for ZnO(6L), as displayed in Fig. 3a, with the ZnO layers slightly buckled in the vertical direction by less than 0.1 Å. Instead of approaching the asymptotic value of −1.25 eV for the bulk ZnO(0001) surface, ZnO(7L) and ZnO(8L) exhibit severe structural reconstruction upon CO2 chemisorption, having adsorption energies of −1.53 and −0.79 eV, respectively (see Fig. S2 of ESI for details†). Therefore, the ultrathin ZnO sheet undergoes abrupt changes in structures and surface properties at critical thicknesses of 7 and 8 layers. Considering the structural stability, we will focus on ZnO(nL) with n = 1–6 in the following discussions.

(b) Free energy diagram of CO2 reduction to CO on ZnO(nL). (c) Atomic structures of CO2, CO, HCOOH and COOH* intermediate chemisorbed on ZnO(4L). The H, C, O and Zn atoms are shown in white, grey, red and blue colors, respectively. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the C1 products from CO2 reduction, and also serves as an important intermediate for producing hydrocarbons. Our calculations show that the CO molecule is physisorbed on ZnO(nL, n ≤ 5) at a distance of 2.25 Å above the film surface, with adsorption energies less than −0.36 eV. ZnO(6L) binds more strongly with CO, having an adsorption energy of −0.84 eV and Zn–C distance of 2.22 Å. On the other hand, formic acid (HCOOH) can be chemisorbed on ZnO(nL) in the bidentate configuration (represented by HCOOH*) with adsorption energies of −0.08 to −0.94 eV relative to the free HCOOH molecule (Fig. 3a and c), which offers the possibility for further reduction reactions (hereafter we use asterisk (*) to indicate the reaction intermediates adsorbed on the catalyst, whereas the formula without * represents a free molecule). Nevertheless, the formation of CO and HCOOH only requires two transferred electrons, and thus they might be the major products of CO2 reduction on mono- and few-layer ZnO(nL, n ≤ 6).
3.3. CO2 reduction on ZnO(nL)
As a representative, Fig. 3b and 4a display the free energy diagram of the most efficient pathway for CO2 reduction on ZnO(4L) to form various C1 products, such as CO, HCOOH, formaldehyde (CH2O), methanol (CH3OH) and methane (CH4). The results for the other ZnO(nL) systems are shown in Table S4, Fig. S5 and S6 of ESI.† Overall, the reaction proceeds mainly through the carboxyl pathway (COOH*). The formate species (HCOO*) is higher in energy than COOH* by over 2.0 eV, and thus its formation is largely inhibited. The surface O atoms of the ZnO(nL) sheets are the active sites, which bond to the C atom of the reaction intermediates (Fig. 4b). As the adsorption energies of CO2 and the various intermediate species are correlated to each other, the formation of each type of C1 product requires suitable binding strength of the critical intermediates on the ZnO catalysts, which in turn mediates the product selectivity (Fig. 5).

 Fig. 5  (a) Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG) of various elementary steps vs. ΔG of particular reaction step (from left to right, , HCOOH* + H+ + e− → HCO* + H2O, and H2CO* + H+ + e− → H2COH*, respectively) for ZnO(nL) sheets. ΔGCOOH*, ΔGHCO* and ΔGH2COH* actually characterize the binding strength of the critical intermediates COOH*, HCO* and H2COH* on the catalyst relative to the energies of , HCOOH* and H2CO* species plus  (with release of a H2O molecule for HCO*), which in turn can be referred to as the free CO2, HCOOH and CH2O gas molecules, respectively. (b) Limiting potentials (UL) of various C1 products for ZnO(nL) sheets. 
Specifically, the reaction to CO and HCOOH is as follows: CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → COOH* + H+ + e− → CO + H2O or HCOOH. The free energy level of the COOH* intermediate determines the limiting potential for these two products. As illustrated by Fig. 3b, the free energy of COOH* varies in a wide range—it is lowered as the number of ZnO layers increases from +1.73 eV for ZnO(1L) to −0.73 eV for ZnO(6L). Interestingly, the limiting potentials of CO and HCOOH have volcano relations with the binding strength of COOH*. The monolayer and bilayer ZnO bind too weakly with COOH*, which hinders CO2 protonation, and have UL = −1.12 and −0.75 V vs. RHE, respectively (Fig. 5b). In contrast, ZnO(6L) binds too strongly with COOH*, such that the further reduction of COOH* is difficult and behaves as the rate-limiting step, resulting in UL = −0.94 V vs. RHE. With moderate binding strength with COOH*, ZnO(3L) and ZnO(4L) exhibit the highest activity with UL of only −0.23 to −0.43 V vs. RHE for the production of CO and HCOOH.
Furthermore, the protonation of COOH* can also generate HCOOH* species chemisorbed on ZnO(nL). This reaction step is exothermic for n = 1–3, and involves a potential step of 0.22–0.79 eV for n = 4–6 (Fig. 4a, S5 and S6 of ESI†). The reduction of HCOOH* leads to a HCO* species and a H2O molecule. The further protonation of HCO* yields CH2O; this process competes with the formation of the H2CO* species chemisorbed on the catalysts. By gaining more transferred electrons, CH3OH and CH4 products can be obtained via H2CO* + 2H+ + 2e− → H2COH* + H+ + e− → CH3OH and , respectively. The free energy levels of the HCO* and H2COH* species are critical for determining the limiting potentials of CH2O, and CH3OH or CH4, respectively. Fig. 5a shows the competition between the formation and consumption of the HCO* and H2COH* intermediates. Along the x axis, ΔGHCO* and ΔGH2COH* can be regarded as the binding strength of HCO* and H2COH* with respect to HCOOH* and H2CO* species, which in turn can be referred to as free HCOOH and CH2O molecules. Apparently, ZnO(3L) and ZnO(4L) provide a favorable binding with HCO* and H2COH*, and possess the lowest limiting potentials. Specifically, ZnO(4L) has UL = −0.23, −0.23 and −0.69 V vs. RHE for producing CH2O, CH3OH and CH4, respectively. Meanwhile, ZnO(3L) has the same limiting potential of −0.43 V vs. RHE for the three products, since the formation of COOH* induces the largest potential step and limits the overall reaction. The ZnO films with other considered thicknesses have either too weak or too strong binding ability with the critical intermediates or incur large potential steps for the protonation of the  or COOH* species; thus, they are relatively less active with UL ≤ −0.75 V vs. RHE.
Note that the bulk ZnO(0001) surface exhibits distinct catalytic behaviors from that of 2D graphene-like ZnO. The surface Zn atoms are the active sites and provide strong binding with the HCOO* species rather than COOH*. The further reduction of HCOO* involves a large potential step of 1.66 eV, resulting in a relatively low activity (see Fig. S7 of ESI for details†). Indeed, catalytic CO2 reduction may occur more readily on the other facets of the ZnO crystal, such as the (100) surface that provides favorable binding with both CO2 and CO.57
To summarize, ZnO ultrathin films are active for the adsorption of CO2 molecules and are able to catalyze CO2 reduction. The adsorption strength increases with the number of layers. Overall, ZnO(3L) and ZnO(4L) have the highest activity toward various C1 products as evidenced by Fig. 5b. For ZnO(nL, n ≤ 5) with relatively weaker binding capability, CO and HCOOH are the major products, while the formation of CH2O, CH3OH and CH4 is also possible but with low yield. For thicker ZnO(6L) with relatively stronger adsorption to CO* and HCOOH* species, CH3OH and CH4 products become dominant. These theoretical results are consistent with the experimental observations that bulk ZnO catalyzes CO2 reduction to CH3OH, while the ultrathin ZnO sheets lead to CO production.4,33 The limiting potentials of ZnO(nL) are competitive with those of the Cu and Ag catalysts commonly used for CO2 electrochemical reduction, i.e. −0.41 and −0.74 V vs. RHE for the production of CO and CH4 on the Cu(211) surface, respectively, −0.74 V vs. RHE for CH3OH formation on the Cu(111) surface, and −0.90 V vs. RHE for CO formation on the Ag(110) surface.48,58,59 The activity of 2D ZnO sheets is also comparable to that of some proposed single metal atom catalysts supported on 2D carbon-based materials, for instance, 3d transition metal atoms on tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) or porphyrin monolayers with limiting potentials down to −0.24 to −0.65 V vs. RHE for producing various C1 products.60–62 In experiment, the product selectivity of Cu metal is usually controlled by external conditions such as temperature and electrode voltage.48,63 However, for the current 2D ZnO films, selectivity can be modulated intrinsically by the number of layers, offering a new opportunity for selective CO2conversion.
3.4. Photocatalytic properties of ZnO(nL)
As a prominent merit, these semiconducting ZnO ultrathin films can harvest sunlight to drive the CO2 reduction reactions through photocatalysis. Fig. 6b displays the optical absorption spectra of ZnO(nL) from HSE06 calculations, which shows high intensities of absorption in the ultraviolet regime. As the number of layers increases, the absorption peaks are red shifted as the band gap reduces. Thus, solar energy can be utilized to excite electrons to the conduction band, which react with the adsorbed chemical species on the ZnO surfaces. In reality, the photo-generated electron and hole carriers may recombine, which severely affects the efficiency of CO2 reduction. The ZnO(nL) sheets have small effective masses of 0.32 − 0.24m0 (m0 is the electron rest mass, see Table S3 of ESI†) for electron and hole carriers, suggesting that the charge carriers could be rather mobile, which will be beneficial for electron–hole separation and migration to the surfaces of the ultrathin ZnO films.64–66

Moreover, our considered ZnO(nL) systems have suitable band edge positions for CO2 reduction with water, as manifested by Fig. 6a. Their conduction band minimum (CBM) values lie above the redox potentials of CO2 to the five C1 products by 0.34 eV. This means that the photo-generated electrons in ZnO(nL) have a sufficiently high reducing power and are able to reduce CO2 to various C1 products. In comparison, bulk ZnO and the commonly used TiO2 photocatalysts have much lower reducing potentials, with CBM lying only 0.02 eV above the redox potentials of CO2 to CH2O, CH3OH and CH4, while the conversion from CO2 to CO and HCOOH has higher redox potentials and cannot occur.67 On the other hand, the valence band maximum (VBM) values of ZnO(nL) are below the redox potential of H2O to O2 by 0.41 eV. The high oxidation power of the hole carriers enables water splitting and produces H+ ions for CO2 reduction. Therefore, with a highly active surface, satisfactory optical absorption properties and suitable band edge positions, the 2D ZnO ultrathin films are promising photocatalysts for CO2 conversion.
3.5. Activity vs. electronic band structure of ZnO(nL)
The thickness-dependent activity of the ultrathin ZnO sheets is related to the interlayer charge redistribution and creation of strong electron accumulation surfaces due to the quantum confinement effect. For bulk ZnO, electron transfer occurs from the (000) to (0001) surface to remove the intrinsic dipole and stabilize the polar surfaces.68 Previous DFT studies showed that the interior layers of bulk ZnO present Mulliken charges of −(+)0.86e on an O(Zn) atom, while the (0001) and (000) surfaces carry −0.05 and +0.10e (per formula unit), respectively.17 When sculptured into atomic thin films, ZnO turns into a non-polar planar structure. As the number of layers increases, the π bonding between the O 2pz and Zn 4pz orbitals from adjacent layers becomes stronger (demonstrated by the reduced Zn–O bond length and increased bond order shown in Fig. 7a), inducing more interlayer charge transfer from Zn to O atoms (see Table S3 of ESI†). Different from bulk ZnO, both the surfaces of the ZnO ultrathin film are electron accumulated with −0.04 to −0.07e per formula unit, while the interior layers are positively charged, giving zero net dipole moment (Table 1, Fig. 7d and Table S3 of ESI†). As a result, a thicker ZnO(nL) sheet has more negatively charged surfaces and is thus more active for CO2 adsorption, as disclosed by Fig. 7b. We also performed the Bader charge analysis and obtained the same trend of on-site charge on the ZnO(nL) sheets as a function of number of layers (see Table S3 of ESI for details†).

The solid lines are linear fit of the data points. (d) Electron localization function of ZnO(5L) with red (blue) color showing maxima (minima), and schematic (blue arrows) of the electron distribution on the interior and surface ZnO layers. 
Furthermore, the electron accumulation on the ZnO(nL) surfaces is associated with the shift of the O 2p band to a higher energy relative to the Fermi level. The p band center (εp) can be calculated as follows:69,70 (4)where D(E) is the DOS of 2p orbitals of the surface O atoms at a given energy E, the integral is taken for all the occupied states, and the Fermi level is set to zero. As revealed by Fig. 7c, the CO2 binding strength follows a linear relation with εp, i.e. the higher the p band center, the stronger the binding of CO2 on ZnO(nL). Previously, such a trend in the activity was also observed for a variety of perovskite metal oxides as catalysts.71–74 According to the Zaanen–Sawatzky–Allen model,75 the O 2p band center is an important parameter for measuring the covalency of the metal–oxygen bond and describing the electronic band structure of a compound semiconductor. It is relevant to the metal–oxygen coupling strength and reflects the oxygen reactivity of oxide materials.76,77 For the current ZnO(nL) systems, with increasing number of layers, both intralayer and interlayer Zn–O bond strengths are enhanced accompanied by the ascent of the O 2p band center, and accordingly the surface O atoms become more reactive (Fig. 7 and Table S2 of ESI†). Thus, our results corroborate the previous arguments that the O 2p band center can serve as a general descriptor for the catalytic activity of oxides especially for those without d states around the Fermi level.74,76–78
In short, confining ZnO into atomic thin films induces significant variation to the atomic structure, interlayer coupling and charge distribution with regard to the bulk form, thus resulting in an intriguing evolution of catalytic behaviors with the number of ZnO layers. Profiting from the quantum confinement effect, thickness-engineering activity/selectivity is a novel, effective and universal strategy for the ultrathin films of metal oxides and compound semiconductors. As a non-toxic, low-cost, highly chemically and thermally stable semiconductor with tunable electronic band structures, ZnO in the form of freestanding ultrathin sheets available in the laboratory serves as an ideal platform for exploring such opportunities. We hope that the present theoretical results would motivate future experiments to utilize 2D metal oxides or semiconductor compounds for various photocatalytic applications.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the evolution of the structures and photocatalytic properties of ZnO for CO2 reduction as the thickness reduces from bulk to monolayer is systematically explored by first-principles calculations. Ultrathin freestanding ZnO(nL, n ≤ 6) sheets favor the graphene-like planar structure with CO2 adsorption strength increasing with the number of layers. At critical thicknesses of 7L and 8L, where the wurtzite polar structure becomes competitive, structural reconstruction occurs upon CO2 adsorption. The ZnO(nL, n ≤ 6) sheets show strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet regime and have suitable band edge positions for water oxidation and CO2 reduction to various C1 products. Most impressively, the nonpolar surface of 2D ZnO can promote catalytic CO2 reduction with selectivity intrinsically relying on the number of layers. CO and HCOOH are the major products for ZnO(nL, n ≤ 5), the highest activity is achieved at thicknesses of 3L and 4L, while CH3OH and CH4 products are dominant for ZnO(6L). The activity of these ZnO ultrathin films is attributed to the interlayer charge redistribution and electron accumulation on the surfaces, and can be correlated to the O 2p band center. Definitely, these theoretical results enrich our understanding of the surface chemistry properties of 2D ZnO and other metal oxides. More importantly, we raise a new concept of manipulating the interlayer coupling and surface activity of ultrathin films by taking advantage of the quantum confinement effect in the out-of-plane direction, which can be universally applied for precisely tailoring the photocatalytic properties of metal oxides and compound semiconductors through controlling the film thickness.
