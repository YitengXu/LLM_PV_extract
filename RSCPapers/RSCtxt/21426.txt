    , Accepted 22nd July 2016First published on 27th July 2016AbstractWe report two acetylene-bridged small molecules DPP5 and DPP6 with low HOMO–LUMO gaps as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. After the optimization, i.e. weight ratio of donor to acceptor and surface treatment of the active layer, we achieved overall power conversion efficiencies up to 4.65% (Jsc = 8.19 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.73% (Jsc = 9.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.61), for DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM respectively, which are superior to those for the devices based on as-cast active layers. The significant change in the power conversion efficiency is attributed to the improvement in nanoscale morphology, balanced charge transport and charge collection efficiency, induced through the surface treatment.
Introduction
In the past decades, substantial progress has been made in the field of organic solar cells, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 10% for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) based on both polymer and small molecule (SM) donor materials have been achieved.1,2 In comparison with conjugated polymers, SMs show many advantages such as simple molecular structures, low molecular weight, simple purification and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility,3 and have the potential to produce low-cost and large-scale OSCs for commercial applications in the near future,4 and there is a wide scope to enhance the PCE of BHJ OSCs based on SM donors. In order to enhance the PCE of SM-OSCs, the approach is to design low bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) materials by introducing appropriate donor and acceptor groups.
Among the various electron acceptors, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit has been explored as an efficient electron acceptor (A) in D–A copolymers and small molecules, due to its planar, extremely conjugated lactam structure, resulting in strong π–π interaction. A variety of DPP-based D–A conjugated polymers and small molecules have been productively designed, showing promising photovoltaic performance.5 Moreover, the introduction of planar heteroarene DPP units into π-conjugated systems increases the effective conjugation length through facilitating π-electron delocalization and improves charge carrier mobility, widening the absorption profile.6 Alkylated DPP derivatives are soluble in organic solvents and are photochemically and thermally stable with excellent charge carrier mobility.7
However, strong donor–acceptor interactions between the DPP core and adjacent thiophenes generate strongly hybridized frontier molecular orbitals, leading to low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of DPP-based small molecules. Hence it is challenging to achieve a high Jsc without a substantial loss of Voc and vice versa of solar cells with DPP based SMs because of the existence of a trade-off between their low bandgaps (high Jsc) and their high-lying HOMO energy levels (low Voc). Recently, Peng et al. reported a molecule with porphyrin as the core and diketopyrrolopyrrole as the arm and achieved an overall PCE of 8.08% as the donor.8
D–π–A molecular systems have been widely used for organic solar cells by connecting different donors and acceptors through π-bridges.9 Strong donor or acceptor moieties and short π-bridges frequently enhance D–A interactions, whereas weak donor or acceptor units and long π-bridges lower the D–A interactions.10 Carbazole is a fused aromatic system used as a donor unit in D–A organic molecules to narrow the band gap and for fine tuning of energy levels. Owing to the weak electron donating ability of carbazole units, carbazole-based organic semiconductors possess deep HOMO energy levels, which are essential for high Voc devices. Carbazole has been widely used as an electron-donating unit in the design of low bandgap D–A conjugated polymers and has been shown to be a promising donor material for polymer solar cells.11 Carbazoles connected to DPPs with various positions of carbazole have been reported for different applications.12 Symmetrical N-phenyl carbazole functionalized DPPs used for optoelectronics and solar cell applications have been reported by Pyo et al. and Kim et al.13 The good electron-donating and charge transport abilities motivated us to choose N-phenyl carbazole as the end-capping donor14,15 and DPP as the electron acceptor because of its excellent electron-accepting affinity and absorption in the visible region.16,17 D–A small molecules with carbazole units were also used as donors for small molecule solar cells and showed a high Voc and relatively low FF.18 Recently we have described the design, synthesis and solar cell applications of ferrocenyl and triphenylamine functionalized DPPs with enhanced electron acceptor abilities by the use of electron donor and acceptor units.19
To understand the effect of the acetylene linkage on the solar cell properties of DPP, small molecules DPPs 5 and 6 were synthesized. We have used these DPP based small molecules as donors along with PC71BM as acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ organic solar cells. After the optimization of the morphology of the active layers, i.e. weight ratio and surface treatment, the devices based on DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM exhibit overall PCEs up to 4.65% and 5.73%, respectively. These values are higher than those of the devices based on counterpart as-cast active layers. The enhancement in the PCE is attributed to the better nanoscale morphology, balanced charge transport and better charge extraction, induced by the surface treatment.
Results and discussion
The small molecules DPP5 and DPP6 were synthesized via the Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling of monobromo 3 and dibromo 4 with N-(4-ethynylphenyl) carbazole in good yields (Chart 1).20

Optical, thermal and electrochemical properties
The optical absorption spectra of DPP5 and DPP6 were recorded in CHCl3 solution (2 × 10−4 M) as well as in thin films processed from CHCl3 solution and are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, both small molecules show absorption bands in the 500–700 nm and 350–450 nm regions originating from π–π* transitions of the substituted thiophene moieties and their conjugation frameworks and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from N-phenyl carbazole to DPP, respectively.20 The di-N-phenyl carbazole substituted DPP6 shows redshifted absorption bands compared to their mono-substituted analogue DPP5, which is attributed to the increase in conjugation length due to the additional N-phenyl carbazole unit. From the solution to film states, the absorption bands get broadened and redshifted by more than 28 nm for both DPPs, which implies J-type aggregation of the conjugated molecules in the solid state.21 Using the onset optical absorption spectra in thin film, the optical band gaps of DPP5 and DPP6 are calculated to be 1.84 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively. The trend in optical band gaps follows the order DPP6 < DPP5, which indicates that the incorporation of N-phenyl carbazole into DPP shows redshifted absorption with a decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap (Table 1). Therefore, using two carbazole donor units is beneficial to enhance the spectral absorption and decrease the optical band gap.

The thermal stabilities of DPPs 5 and 6 were studied by TGA analysis, showing good thermal stability and the corresponding decomposition temperatures were found to be 333 °C and 398 °C at 5% weight loss, respectively (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Thermogravimetric analysis of DPP5 and DPP6 measured at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. 
The electrochemical behaviors of DPPs 5 and 6 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a dichloromethane solvent using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). The DPPs 5 and 6 show one reduction wave at −1.03 V and two oxidation waves at 0.93 V, 1.60 V and 0.92 V, 1.20 V due to the oxidation of thiophene and carbazole moieties, respectively. The oxidation of DPP6 is easier compared to DPP5 due to an additional N-phenyl carbazole unit. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the DPPs were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO levels were estimated to be −5.34/−3.64 eV and −5.37/−3.60 eV, for DPP5 and DPP6, respectively. The low-lying HOMO energies of the two DPPs suggest that two molecules should have good air stability, beneficial for a high Voc of the resulting OSCs.

Photovoltaic properties
The active layers of solar cells were made by using different weight ratios of DPP5 or DPP6 and PC71BM and it was found that a weight ratio of 1:2 (DPPs to PC71BM) showed the maximum photovoltaic response. Therefore, here only the results obtained with this optimized active layer are described. The current–voltage characteristics of devices based on DPP5 or DPP6:PC71BM (1:2) cast from CF are shown in Fig. 3a and the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. Devices based on as-cast active layers of DPP5 and DPP6 showed PCEs of 1.93% (Jsc = 5.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.39) and 2.51% (Jsc = 6.65 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.41), respectively. Both devices showed almost the same Voc but the DPP6-based device showed a high Jsc as compared to that for DPP5. The similar values of Voc may be attributed to the same HOMO energy levels of these DPPs. The difference in the Jsc values is consistent with the IPCE spectra of the devices (Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3b, the IPCE spectra of the devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the corresponding blended films (Fig. 4), indicating that both PC71BM and DPPs contribute to the photocurrent generation. However, the IPCE band in a longer wavelength region is slightly blue-shifted as compared to the absorption band of DPPs. The higher value of Jsc for the DPP6-based device, relative to DPP5, may be attributed to the improved light harvesting efficiency of the active layer due to a wider absorption profile and a low optical band gap of DPP6. The values of Jsc estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are 5.28 mA cm−2 and 6.53 mA cm−2 for DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM, respectively, which are consistent with the values observed in the J–V characteristics under illumination.

In spite of high Voc of these devices, the overall PCE is quite low, which is mainly attributed to the low Jsc and FF values. Many strategies, including thermal annealing,22 solvent vapor annealing,23 solvent additives24 and combination of these treatments,25 have been reported to improve the overall PCEs of OSCs based on BHJ active layers using conjugated polymers and small molecule donors. Recently an approach was applied to improve the PCE of organic solar cells via a simple rinsing treatment using a solvent mixture comprising a small amount of solvent additive such as 1,8 diiodooctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and the most non-polar buffer solvent for polymer solar cells26 and small molecules.27 It was reported that the surface treatment of the active layer by alcohols such as MeOH or binary solvents can effectively optimize the nanoscale morphology of the active layer, thereby improving the overall PCE of the resulting device. Zhang et al. reported that the PCE of PSCs increased from 6.13% to 8.69% when adjusting the MeOH soaking time of the solvent additive DIO processed active layers.28 In order to improve the PCE of our devices, we have adopted the method of surface treatment with a binary solvent containing MeOH and small traces of CN. When we varied the concentration of CN from 0 to 4 v% in MeOH, the surface treatment by MeOH:CN (98:2) showed the maximum PCE. The J–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 3a and the photovoltaic parameters are complied in Table 2. After the surface treatment of the active layer with MeOH:CN (98:2), the devices based on DPP5 and DPP6 showed PCEs of 4.65% (Jsc 8.19 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.73% (9.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.61) respectively. The increase in PCE is mainly attributed to the enhancement in Jsc and FF. The increase in Jsc is consistent with the corresponding IPCE spectra of the devices (Fig. 3b). The Jsc values estimated from the IPCE spectra are 8.14 mA cm−2 and 9.46 mA cm−2 for DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM, respectively, which are in agreement with the experimentally observed values. The IPCE and Jsc values are directly related to the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and morphology of the active layer and charge transport properties in the device.
In order to access the effect of surface treatment, we have measured the optical properties of the DPPs:PC71BM (1:2) before and after the surface treatment and are shown in Fig. 4. The as-cast film shows an absorption between 350 nm and 750 nm with two prominent absorption peaks at 386 nm and another longer wavelength region (606 nm and 638 nm for DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM, respectively), corresponding to the absorption peaks of PC71BM and DPPs, respectively. The absorption peak corresponding to the DPPs is slightly blue-shifted as compared to the pristine DPPs. This may be due to the induced effect of PC71BM in the blend, which reduced the molecular ordering of the DPPs in the blend. After the surface treatment with the binary solvent, the absorption coefficient of the absorption peak corresponding to the DPP significantly increased and also redshifted, suggesting the enhancement of molecular ordering.29 This indicates that the surface treatment with binary solvent might facilitate the crystallization of DPP, enhancing the π–π stacking. The increase in the absorption coefficient and the broader absorption profile of the active layer upon surface treatment leads to an increase in the LHE of the device.
The overall PCE of the BHJ OSCs is also determined by the morphology of the corresponding active layer. It is well known that the exciton diffusion length of most organic semiconductors is about 10–20 nm, therefore a nanophase separation with the range of exciton diffusion length and bi-continuous interpenetrating network in the active layer is necessary for efficient exciton dissociation into free charge carriers, forming separate percolative channels for the transport of holes and electrons.30 The surface morphology of the active layer with and without surface treatment was characterized by the atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and the images are shown in Fig. 5, only for DPP6:PC71BM. Similar images were also observed for DPP5:PC71BM films. The DPP6:PC71BM processed with CF showed a smooth and uniform surface morphology with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.65 nm. The film shows a poor nanoscale morphology that is not sufficient for proper exciton dissociation and charge transportation, resulting in low Jsc and FF. However, after the surface treatment the RMS roughness increased to 1.78 nm with a domain size of 20–25 nm, which is very close the exciton diffusion length, suggesting more effective exciton dissociation, and beneficial for high Jsc.

The effect of surface treatment on phase separation between the donor and acceptor in the active layer was further investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and is shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, the TEM images show a clear phase separation for the film after the surface treatment, which is favorable for charge transport reducing the recombination, leading to an increase in FF of the resulting device.

The charge carrier mobility in the BHJ active layer is an important effect on the photovoltaic performance (particularly on Jsc and FF) of the organic solar cells. To access the performance of the DPPs:PC71BM-based devices influenced by the surface treatments, the hole mobilities of the active layers were measured by fitting the space charge limited current (SCLC) model to the current–voltage characteristics of the hole-only devices (Fig. 7). The as-cast DPP6:PC71BM and DPP5:PC71BM exhibit hole mobilities of about 9.98 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.84 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, they are improved significantly up to 9.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after surface treatment with the MeOH:CN solvent for DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM, respectively. This improvement in the hole mobility is mainly attributed to the enhanced crystallinity and molecular ordering of the DPPs induced by the surface treatment, as revealed by TEM and optical absorption spectra measurements. The higher hole mobility is beneficial for balanced charge transport in the active layer and improves the FF and Jsc values of the OSCs.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage characteristics of hole only devices to estimate the hole mobility. 
The difference in the Jsc values can also be supported by the analysis of charge separation and collection processes. Fig. 8 shows the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) on the effective voltage (Veff). In the case of the devices based on surface-treated active layers, Jph is linearly dependent on Veff in the low Veff region (<0.2 V) and almost reaches a saturation state (Jphsat) at a relatively high Veff (∼2.4V). However, in the devices based on the as-cast active layers, Jph displays a strong electric field dependence indicating that a Veff of 2.4 V is not sufficient to cause a saturated Jph. Moreover, Jph for devices based on the active layers without surface treatment clearly shows a square root dependence on the applied voltage at intermediate Veff, which is consistent with the reduction of FF and Jsc.31 When Jph reaches saturation, its value is controlled only by the maximum generation rate of excitons (Gmax), which can estimated using Jphsat = qLGmax.32 The estimated Gmax values are 2.3 × 1021, 3.78 × 1021, 5.67 × 1021 and 7.83 × 1021 m−3 for DPP5:PC71BM (as cast), DPP6:PC71BM (as cast) DPP5:PC71BM (surface treated) and DPP6:PC71BM (surface treated), respectively. The values of Gmax for the devices based on the surface treated active layers are higher than those for the devices with surface treated active layers. This indicates that the surface treated active layer is capable of generating a higher number of excitons than the non-surface treated counterpart. Since the exciton generation rate is directly proportional to the absorption properties of the active layer, the higher value of Gmax is consistent with the absorption spectra (Fig. 4). In short circuit conditions, the value of Jph/Jphsat gives the charge collection probability (Pc). The values of Pc for surface treated devices based on DPP5 and DPP6 are 0.84 and 0.86, respectively, whereas these values are only 0.68 and 0.72 for the as-cast DPP5 and DPP6, respectively. Therefore, the surface treatment of the active layer improves both free charge carrier generation and collection, thereby enhancing both FF and Jsc.33 Moreover, the difference in the values of Pc for the devices indicates a different degree of recombination losses in these devices.

The Voc of the devices was increased from 0.92 V to 0.98 V after the surface treatment of the active layer. The enhancement in Voc may be attributed to the interfacial dipole between the active layer and metal cathode induced by the surface treatment, as similar phenomena have also been observed in polymer solar cells.34 Moreover, the values of the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) for the devices estimated from the slopes of the J–V characteristics under illumination at Voc and Jsc, respectively, are consistent with the observed values of Jsc, FF and the overall PCE of the devices.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized ethyne bridged N-phenyl carbazole substituted unsymmetrical DPP5 and symmetrical DPP6 by Sonogashira cross-coupling. We have used these two DPPs as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the preparation of solution processed BHJ organic solar cells. After the optimization of the active layers in terms of the weight ratio of donor to acceptor and surface treatment, the OSCs based on DPP5:PC71BM and DPP6:PC71BM exhibited overall PCEs of 4.65% (Jsc = 8.19 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.73% (9.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.61), respectively, which are higher than those of counterpart OSCs processed with as-cast active layers. This improvement in the PCE is related to the better nanoscale morphology of the active layer, balanced charge transport and enhanced charge collection efficiency, induced by the surface treatment of the active layer.
