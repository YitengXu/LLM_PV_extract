    , Accepted 30th August 2019First published on 11th September 2019AbstractA hydrophobic electron transporter is introduced to enhance the moisture stability of perovskite solar cells. The device retains 76.8% of the initial efficiency after half a year's storage. Physical vapour deposition that is compatible with flexible substrates is used to fabricate charge transporters. This scheme contributes to achieving stable perovskite devices with low time and energy inputs.
Introduction
Energy exploitation is the bedrock of modern life. In 2015, clean and renewable energy accounts for only 19% of total energy consumed. However, environment threats are overwhelming due to the high emission levels of pollutants and greenhouse gases during the combustion of fossil fuels. Among different technologies, solar to electricity conversion is highly competitive due to its safety, simplicity and wide availability. Solar cells are used to absorb sunlight and convert it into useable power. Different mechanisms are proposed and many materials are used to produce solar panels with the least cost per watt (lowest material and energy use). Unfortunately, there has long been a trade-off between the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and process simplicity. Complicated processes and huge power input are required to achieve high PCEs. Conversely, the efficiencies of emerging photovoltaics featuring easy fabrication remained below 15% for decades. Recently, this dogma was broken for the first time by alkali lead halide (APbX3, A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+) and CH(NH2)2+; X = Br− and I−) based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A certified PCE of 25.2% (ref. 1) that is comparable with crystalline silicon technology was achieved with a simple solution process.
The major pitfall that hinders the application of PSCs is poor stability. Alkali lead halides, especially organic–inorganic hybrid ones, degrade under moisture,2–4 light5–10 and heat.11–15 On one hand, water molecules have a strong interaction with perovskites, and they could be adsorbed by forming hydrogen bonds with MA+ ions. The formation of hydrates with the incorporation of water molecules into the perovskite lattice was verified.16–22 The hydrates are metastable and could further degrade into PbI2 and volatile species. On the other hand, halides have relatively “soft” structures. Lattice relaxation and expansion under heat23–25 or illumination26,27 were observed which facilitate the diffusion of defects and mass. The heat and light stability of the perovskite was dramatically enhanced by incorporating alkali metal ions.10,28,29 Mixed cation perovskites and inorganic perovskites have shown high light and thermal stabilities. The perovskite phase stability under moisture of these materials, however, remains a problem.30–32 One of the most effective approaches to enhance humidity stability is introducing hydrophobic layers. PSCs with a carbon back contact were highly stable as Mei Li2 reported in 2014. However, the PCEs of PSCs with carbon electrodes are much lower than those of PSCs with metal contacts. To date, the highest reported PCE of PSCs with the carbon contact is 18.1% while the value for the metal contact counterpart is 25.2%.1 Except for inferior performance, the energy consumption of the carbon-based device is high. Different pastes have to be prepared and calcination is required to fabricate mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon contact. Another impressive work is the photoinduced synthesis of a polymer coating.33 The bi-functional polymer protects the perovskite layer from both moisture and ultraviolet irradiation. After storing in an ambient atmosphere for a month, the PCE showed a decrease of only 4%. This work showed the feasibility of protecting perovskites with a hydrophobic polymer. However, the devices have an n–i–p structure with mesoporous TiO2 layers calcined at 500 °C. Besides, the fabrication is complicated and the precursor is expensive.
Here, we propose a room-temperature processable PSC architecture with long-term moisture stability where the perovskite is protected by a hydrophobic ZnO/polytetrafluoroethylene (ZnO@PTFE) composite electron transport layer (ETL). A porous PTFE hydrophobic layer was first deposited on the perovskite by thermal evaporation. Containing a large quantity of –CF2– groups, PTFE is an excellent hydrophobic material with low surface tension, high chemical inertness and thermal stability. Then ZnO was sputtered into the pores to collect the photogenerated electrons. ZnO is a widely used ETL in energy conversion devices.34–45 Compared to TiO2, it has higher electron mobility46–48 and could be processed at a lower temperature.49,50 The sputtered ZnO is highly crystallised which ensures effective charge extraction and transportation. A hysteresis-free efficiency of 13.83% was achieved which is comparable with that of a [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) based device (15.23%). Excellent moisture stability was achieved. After storing in a 30 °C, 60% relative humidity (60 RH%) chamber for half a year, 76.8% of the initial value was retained. In contrast, PSCs with PCBM degraded within a month. The ZnO@PTFE ETL based PSC is among the most stable devices with an alkali lead halide absorber. Besides high stability, the merit of the scheme in this work is the calcination-free deposition of carrier transporters. All the layers were prepared by physical vapour deposition (PVD), thermal evaporation or direct current magnetron sputtering without heat treatment except the perovskite layer. Compared to spin coating, PVD is superior in fabricating large-scale films with high thickness homogeneity. The room temperature processibility would cut the cost and shorten the payback time of PSCs. The strategy proposed in this work is of significance for the mass production of highly stable perovskite devices.
Results and discussion
Liquid and gaseous water resistant coatings
To check the feasibility of insulating water molecules from the perovskite with a ZnO@PTFE coating, we studied the surface properties of different films (Fig. 1(a)). The water contact angle (WCA) for the perovskite, PCBM and ZnO was 74.2°, 57.8° and 22.5° respectively. High WCAs were observed for PTFE (147.4°) and ZnO@PTFE (131.8°) coatings. The WCA is morphology and composition-dependent. The low WCA for ZnO originates from the high affinity of hydroxyl groups to water molecules. In contrast, PTFE has low surface energy and affinity to water for the existence of a large quantity of –CF2– groups. With the introduction of ZnO, the WCA of PTFE reduced by 10.58%. The WCA on a composite surface could be well described by the Cassie–Baxter model:51,52 cosθ = f1cosθ1 + f2cosθ2 = f1(cosθ1 − cosθ2) + cosθ2(1)where θ is Cassie's contact angle, θ1, θ2, f1 and f2 are Young's contact angles and the surface fractions of phase 1 and 2, respectively. For porous PTFE, the second phase is the air that has a contact angle of 180° with water. The PTFE network has a surface fraction of 41.22% (Fig. S1†), Young's angle for PTFE is hence defined to be 128.2°. The sputtered ZnO is expected to be compact which means that Young's angle for ZnO is close to 22.5°. Replacing the air in porous PTFE with ZnO will decrease the contact angle to 73.2°. This indicates that ZnO is slightly thinner than the PTFE network and the predominant surfaces in contact with water are PTFE and air. PTFE would evaporate during the deposition of ZnO causing the decrease of the PTFE surface fraction. The WCA increases with the increase of the air surface.53 The decrease of the contact angle for the ZnO@PTFE sample reveals the contribution of ZnO. The thickness of ZnO is deliberately controlled to ensure good contact with the back contact with maximum hydrophobic properties. Liquid water was dropped onto the inclined perovskite film coated with PTFE. The excellent hydrophobic properties of the PTFE coating protected the perovskite from decomposition. As Fig. 1(b) shows, the PTFE coated perovskite remained intact after the water droplet slid off. In comparison, the surface area without coating turned yellow, indicating the formation of PbI2. A video was recorded to show the effectiveness of PTFE as a water-resistant coating (ESI†).

Although PTFE and ZnO@PTFE have excellent hydrophobic performance, their resistivity to water vapour should be investigated. Perovskite films without coating and coated with PCBM, ZnO, PTFE and ZnO@PTFE were stored in a constant temperature and humidity chamber (30 °C, 60 RH%). The phase composition change was tracked by XRD (Fig. 1(c–g)). Several interaction mechanisms between water molecules and the perovskite were proposed.19,54–58 Among these mechanisms, the formation of hydrate intermediates is convincing. Under high relative humidity, both monohydrate and dihydrate products of the perovskite were identified by XRD.58–61 The formation of the hydrated halides is reversible, and dehydration is observed under heating or in a dry environment (eqn (2)). 4MAPbI3 + 4H2O ⇌ 4MAPbI3·H2O ⇌ (MA)4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2 + H2O(2)
The incorporation and formation of hydrogen bonding between water and organic ions change the crystal structure (Fig. 2(a)). The perovskite has a tetragonal symmetry (I4/mcm) with an edge-shared three-dimensional (3D) [PbI6]4− network. The incorporation of water molecules breaks the 3D network into paralleled two-dimensional (2D) chains. Exposing the hydrates to oxygen and light causes irreversible decomposition by forming gaseous species (CH3NH2, HI and I2). The formation of dihydrate accompanies PbI2 which is only observed under very high relative humidity conditions (∼90 RH%). This is reported previously and agrees well with our high humidity exposure experiment (Fig. S2†). With a moderate humidity of 60 RH%, no hydrate peaks were detected in our samples. However, decomposition into PbI2 was observed for the bare perovskite and the PCBM and PTFE coated perovskite. The diffusion and penetration of water vapour into the perovskite were insignificant under low humidity. Hydration was hence limited at the surface which can hardly be resolved by XRD. We calculated the PbI2 weight ratio according to the XRD results (Fig. 1(h)). The degradation of the perovskite into PbI2 started on the sixth day for the samples without coating and with PTFE coating. However, the PbI2 contents for the PTFE coated sample and that without coating are 61.9% and 97.1% after a storage time of three weeks. The PCBM coated sample has a slower decomposition behaviour compared to the bare perovskite. No PbI2 signal was detected before 12 days. While for ZnO and ZnO@PTFE coated samples, the PbI2 content remained the same after 21 days.

Knudsen diffusion describes the diffusion in a small pore whose diameter is comparable to the molecule size. The moving molecules mainly collide with the walls of the pore. Molecular diffusion happens when the pore size is much larger than the molecules and the molecules mainly collide with each other; bulk diffusion is the diffusion method of molecules through a solid. The molecules are absorbed by the defects in the lattice or the grain boundaries and hop randomly between these sites; (c) illustration of water molecule penetration through different coatings on the perovskite. The main diffusion mechanism of water in amorphous PCBM is Knudsen diffusion through the pinholes and bulk diffusion of absorbed water molecules. The water molecules penetrate through the porous PTFE in a molecular diffusion mechanism because of the fact that the average size of the pores is large. Compact ZnO nearly has no pinholes that allow Knudsen or molecular diffusion. It insulates water molecules at room temperature because of the extremely low diffusion coefficient. The case for ZnO@PTFE is similar to that for ZnO. However, the diffusion coefficient for water molecules might be slightly higher in the PTFE polymer. 
The degradation rate of the perovskite depends on the concentration of water in contact with the perovskite. For the perovskite film without coating, the water concentration equals the absolute humidity (13.8 g m−3 = 76.9 mmol L−1). The concentration of water vapour in contact with perovskite films is diffusion controlled. Because of the existence of air channels, the diffusion of water vapour in the PTFE film is by molecular or Knudsen diffusion depending on the pore size. The pore size of the PTFE film is about 40 nm while the diameter of a water molecule is about 0.275 nm. We estimated both molecular and Knudsen diffusion coefficients for water molecules. For porous media, the effective diffusion coefficient depends on the possibility that the water molecules find a path: (3)where φ, δ and τ are the porosity, the constrictivity and the tortuosity of the film. The diffusion coefficient of H2O in the air is about 0.276 cm2 s−1. The exact value of porosity, constrictivity and tortuosity is unknown. However, as an estimate, we took φ, δ and τ values of 0.7, 0.5 and 2. As a result, the effective molecular diffusion coefficient is 0.0483 cm2 s−1. The Knudsen diffusion coefficient (Dk) could be calculated according to the following equation: (4)where d is the pore diameter, M is the molar weight, R is the ideal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. A pore size of 40 nm corresponds to a Knudsen diffusion coefficient of 2.52 × 10−3 cm2 s−1. The diffusion coefficient of water molecules in the PTFE film is hence in the range of 10−2 to 10−3 cm2 s−1. This is a relatively high value and the water vapour concentration in contact with the perovskite immediately increases to 76.9 mmol L−1. Hence, the decomposition of the PTFE coated sample started simultaneously with that of the bare perovskite. However, the PbI2 content increased slower because of the decreased surface of exposure. The PCBM coated sample has a delayed decomposition mechanism started after a storage time of 12 days. As an amorphous molecular film, water molecules could be adsorbed and diffuse in PCBM. The water molecule permeability of polymers is in the 10−8 cm2 s−1 range. The permeability is estimated to be close or higher although there are no such data for PCBM. The much lower water molecule permeability caused the decomposition delay as the water concentration increased much slower. However, PCBM is reported to absorb water and degrade under moisture. The inevitable deformation during molecular decomposition would form penetrating paths. With a low thickness of 50 nm, the water concentration would increase fast with the formation of penetrating paths. The PbI2 content hence increased fast after a storage time of 12 days.
Magnetron sputtered ZnO is highly compact. The water molecule has a very low diffusion coefficient in the ZnO lattice. In fact, ZnO particles are widely used in decreasing the water permeability of polymers in food packing. The diffusion coefficient of molecules in a solid could be described with the Arrhenius equation: (5)where D0 is the upper limit of the diffusion coefficient in the lattice, Ea is the activation energy for diffusion, and k and T are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature. The activation energy for a water molecule to diffuse in inorganic compounds is generally high. Noticeable diffusion requires a very high temperature. An activation energy of ∼2.0 eV was identified by W. Beyer et al. for deuterium diffusion in ZnO.62 This corresponds to a diffusion coefficient of ∼10−37 cm2 s−1 at room temperature (calculated with the theoretical prefactor: D0 ∼ 10−3).63 Considering that the H2O molecule size (∼2.75 Å) is larger than that of deuterium (∼2.5 Å), the diffusion coefficient of H2O in ZnO would be lower. The compact packing of magnetron sputtered ZnO crystallites insulated H2O molecules. As a result, no obvious degradation was observed for ZnO and ZnO@PTFE coated perovskite films.
High moisture stability structure
A low-temperature process was proposed to incorporate ZnO@PTFE into the PSC as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). At first, a Cu:NiOx hole selective layer was deposited by co-sputtering with a reported method.64 Copper was doped to increase the hole mobility of nickel oxide. The perovskite was cast on the compact Cu:NiOx with a solution process reported previously.65 After calcination, the samples were coated with a porous PTFE layer by thermal evaporation.53 ZnO was sputtered into the voids of the PTFE network. At last, a Ag contact was thermally evaporated as the back electrode. The detailed preparation parameters and conditions are given in the Experimental section. The process proposed here is of significance in mass production of large-scale PSCs with high stability and low cost. No external heat was used to crystallize the metal oxide carrier transporter. Flexible (with a polymer substrate) and semi-transparent (with a sputtered ITO electrode) devices are achievable. Lower energy input and shorter payback time are hence expected. Second, PVD is a greener process compared to solution processes which involve hazardous organic solvents. Finally, PVD is capable of depositing large scale films with high thickness homogeneity and precision.

(e) The cross-section of FTO/Cu:NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO@PTFE, the thickness of the composite electron transporter is about 200 nm; (f) the surface of the hydrophobic PTFE nanowire scaffold. 
The band energy levels of each layer are illustrated in Fig. 3(b). The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges of the perovskite match well with the ETL and HTL as well as the electrodes. This is important to ensure effective charge separation and extraction at the interfaces. The morphology of each layer was checked. Magnetron sputtered Cu:NiOx followed the morphology of FTO with a thickness of about 35 nm (Fig. 3(c) and S4†). The full coverage of FTO was achieved which is vital to avoid shunt current. The low thickness ensured low incident light and charge transport losses. The perovskite has a grain size of 215.72 ± 85.25 nm and a thickness of about 400 nm (Fig. 3(d) and S5†). The PbI2 phase was detected in the perovskite film with a weight ratio of 13.77% according to the XRD result (Fig. S6†). The existence of PbI2 could passivate the grain boundaries of the perovskite and is beneficial to photovoltaic performance.66–68 The hydrophobic PTFE layer has a porous structure composed of nanowires (20 nm diameter) (Fig. 3(f)). The thickness of ZnO@PTFE is determined to be 200 nm (Fig. 3(e)). Compared to the typical thickness (less than 100 nm) of metal oxide carrier transporters in PSCs, the ETM here is thick. However, room temperature processed ZnO films have electron mobility in the range of 0.1–10 cm2 V−1 s−1,69–73 which ensures high charge extraction efficiency insensitive to film thickness. As a result, the PCEs of ZnO based PSCs are insensitive to the thickness of ZnO.74 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to check the element distribution of the ZnO@PTFE coated perovskite film (Fig. S12†). The similarity between Zn and O, C and F spectra in shape and position indicates the good mix between ZnO and PTFE. The signal thresholds for these elements are 0.05 and 0.25 μm. The thickness of 200 nm estimated here is in accordance with the cross-sectional morphology. The elaborately controlled deposition of each layer ensured efficient charge separation.
Photovoltaic performance
The solar cell performance of the proposed architecture was checked. Besides hydrophobic ZnO@PTFE, devices with PCBM and ZnO ETLs were fabricated as references. The obtained current density–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 4(a). ZnO and ZnO@PTFE based PSC devices have lower PCEs than the PCBM cell. Decreased VOC and FF for ZnO based devices were noted. This might be a result of inferior perovskite/ETL interfaces. During the magnetron sputtering of ZnO, a large number of particles with kinetic energy in the 1–10 eV range bombard the perovskite layer. A high surface defect density is hence expected for the serious damage caused by high energy particles. Besides, the conduction band edge of ZnO is −4.2 eV which is lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM (−3.7 eV). The energy loss during electron transfer from the perovskite to ETM is smaller for PCBM. As a result, the VOC of ZnO@PTFE and ZnO based devices is lower than that of PCBM. Compared to ZnO, the VOC and FF of ZnO@PTFE based devices were further decreased. The origin might be the decreased perovskite/ETL interface and increased ETL resistance. The area of the perovskite in contact with the carrier transporter would influence the charge extraction rate at the interface.75 With a smaller perovskite/ETL interfacial area, the electrons are separated slower in ZnO@PTFE based devices. Consequently, more free carriers in the perovskite would recombine yielding a lower VOC output. ZnO@PTFE has a thickness of 200 nm which was twice the thickness of ZnO. The resistance of the ETM for the ZnO@PTFE device is tripled compared to that of ZnO one. The higher resistance would decrease the VOC, FF and JSC. To ensure the measurement of the PCE is accurate and the comparison is valid, we tracked the steady-state output at the maximum power point (MMP) of PSCs with different ETLs (Fig. 4(b)). The current output jumped to a plateau upon the shutter opening and remained stable. The PCE obtained from the MMP tracking agrees well with the J–V characteristics. The J–V curves obtained from the forward and reverse scan were compared (Fig. S13†). The hysteresis levels for all devices were close and negligible. This further justified our J–V measurement. The PCEs of ZnO@PTFE and ZnO based devices had smaller standard deviations than those of PCBM cells (Fig. S14†). The better reproducibility is reasonable considering the superiority of PVD in film thickness homogeneity and precision.

The PCEs in this work are moderate compared to those of state-of-the-art PSCs. This is, to some extent, a result of absorber difference. MAPbI3 is less efficient compared to the mixed cation composition Cs-FA-MAPbI3−xBrx. Besides, the inverted structure generally has lower PCEs compared to the normal structure with the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold.76 This might be a result of a shorter electron diffusion length compared to holes.77,78 The electrons in the normal structure were extracted without long diffusion and the holes move a long distance to the HTL. For the inverted structure, the carrier separation behaviour is opposite: electrons have to transport a longer distance in perovskite than holes, resulting in more recombination losses. Hence, more delicate controls over the perovskite/carrier transport layer interfaces are required. Despite the inferior PCEs, the scheme proposed here is competitive in terms of cost per watt and stability. No expensive (for the complexity in synthesis and purification) organic carrier transporters are used in this method. The calcination-free deposition of metal oxide carrier transporters has a far less waste emission level and energy input compared to the traditional TiO2 mesoscopic technique.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of PSCs with different ETLs were checked (Fig. 4(c)). In the entire visible range, high EQEs of over 0.8 were observed for all samples. Lower EQEs of the ZnO@PTFE based device near the bandgap of the perovskite were noted. The light absorption coefficient of the perovskite near the bandgap is lower (Fig. S15†). When the absorption coefficient is high, the light intensity decreases fast and most carriers are generated near the illumination side. Conversely, the photo-generated carriers are distributed more evenly. In other words, more carriers are generated near the perovskite/ETL interface under red light (760 nm) than under blue light (400 nm). The relatively lower EQE under red light verified the less effective charge separation at the perovskite/ZnO@PTFE interface. The JSC values integrated from the EQE measurement were 20.08, 20.64 and 20.69 mA cm−2 for PCBM, ZnO and ZnO@PTFE based devices respectively.
Steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted to check the carrier extraction kinetics of different ETLs to the perovskite (Fig. 4(d)). Bare perovskites on glass show an intense PL peak near 765 nm. With ETL coatings, the PL intensity of the perovskite dramatically decreased. This is a result of carrier density decrease caused by electron extraction of the ETLs. The PL intensities of perovskite films coated with ZnO or ZnO@PTFE are higher than that of films coated with PCBM. The PL intensity difference gives evidence for the fact that perovskite/ZnO (ZnO@PTFE) is less effective in electron extraction compared with PCBM. Transient PL of perovskite films coated with different ETLs shows an exponential decay (Fig. 4(e), Table 1). There are two processes that consume the charge carriers: one is the fast extraction of electrons by the ETL, the other is the slow recombination of nonequilibrium carriers. These consumption mechanisms correspond to the fast and slow lifetimes in the biexponential fit. The slow lifetime component is very close and about 12 ns for all samples. It is reasonable as the perovskite layers are prepared with the same process. The fast PL lifetime components of ZnO and ZnO@PTFE coated perovskites are larger than those of the perovskites coated with PCBM. This indicates that the electrons are extracted by ZnO and ZnO@PTFE with slower kinetics. The coefficients before the exponential items indicate the corresponding contribution of decay lifetimes. With a huge A1 and a very small A2, the carriers in the perovskite coated with PCBM are mainly consumed by electron extraction. In contrast, perovskite films with ZnO and ZnO@PTFE as ETLs have much smaller differences between A1 and A2. In other words, more carriers recombine in ZnO and ZnO@PTFE coated samples compared to that with PCBM coating. The increase of recombination losses would decrease the VOC which is in good accordance with the photovoltaic performance of solar cells.

Moisture stability
We stored our PSCs with different ETLs in a constant temperature and humidity chamber (30 °C, 60 RH%) to check the stability. The PCE evolutions with the storage time of different devices are shown in Fig. 4(f). The detailed J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are given in Fig. S17 and Tables S1–S3.† As a result, the PCBM based PSC degraded within a month. The failure of the PCBM devices is a result of degradation of both perovskite and ETM. The decomposition of PCBM in the air is widely reported in organic photovoltaics.
The PSC with ZnO and ZnO@PTFE ETLs degraded with much slower kinetics. After a storage time of six months, 14% and 78% of the initial PCEs were retained for ZnO and ZnO@PTFE based devices. The ZnO based PSC remained well-functioning within the first month. This is reasonable as no notable degradation was observed for the ZnO coated perovskite after three weeks of exposure to 60 RH%. However, ZnO is hydrophilic with a large number of –OH groups on the surface. Water molecules are adsorbed on the ZnO surface for the formation of hydrogen bonds. By forming and breaking hydrogen bonds, a much higher diffusion coefficient is possible on the grain boundaries of columnar ZnO crystals.
We achieved a relatively stable device with the ZnO@PTFE ETL. The solar cell has a PCE of 10.35 ± 0.20% which is 76.8% of the initial value. The device stability improvement was believed to be due to the blocking effect of PTFE nanowires on water molecules adsorbed by ZnO. The penetration path for water molecules is the grain boundaries perpendicular to the perovskite surface. In an interconnected 3D PTFE network, the continuity of straight grain boundaries broke. Besides, the thickness of ZnO@PTFE (200 nm) is twice that of the ZnO film (100 nm). The water molecules have to move a much longer distance in ZnO@PTFE. On the other hand, ZnO in ZnO@PTFE has a slightly lower thickness than PTFE. The uptake rate of water molecules would be lower due to the decrease of the exposure surface of ZnO to moisture.
Although ZnO resists gaseous water molecules, their potential reaction with the perovskite at high temperature should be noted. Previous studies show that the calcination of MAPbI3/ZnO results in very poor performance.38,79. The calcination-free deposition here is hence a key point for fabricating a well-functioning device. To further decrease the cost of PSCs, PVD could be replaced with printing processes. The hole transport layer Cu:NiOx could be deposited by printing a hydrothermally synthesized colloidal nanocrystal suspension. Because of the excellent chemical stability of PTFE, it is hard to find a solvent to make a solution. However, there are plenty of water-resistant polymers compatible with solution processes, PMMA for instance. PMMA is soluble in xylene which is an anti-solvent of perovskites. A suspension of ZnO nanocrystals in a xylene solution of PMMA could be prepared where PMMA serves as the dispersant and the plasticiser. This will allow the printing of a ZnO/PMMA composite electron transport layer. For the back contact, there are commercially available silver or carbon pastes for printing deposition. Our future work will focus on fully printable PSCs based on the device structure proposed here.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the feasibility of a novel architecture towards low-cost and long-term stable PSCs. The key component is a ZnO@PTFE composite ETL with excellent hydrophobic properties and low water vapour permeability. High resistivity to both liquid and gaseous water is observed for the composite film. The photovoltaic performance with the novel structure shows a slight drop compared to conventional PCBM based devices. The decrease in the PCE is attributed to the inferior interface caused by high energy particle bombarding. However, the stability in moisture is dramatically enhanced. The PCBM based device failed within a month while for the ZnO@PTFE based cell a decent efficiency of 10.35% was achieved after being exposed to 60 RH% for half a year. PVD is used to prepare carrier transport layers at room temperature. The calcination-free carrier transporters would greatly reduce the energy input for solar cell fabrication. Besides, PVD is beneficial for large scale devices which require high film homogeneity. Furthermore, our scheme is compatible with flexible and wearable devices with wider applications.
Experimental
Substrate preparation
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 10 min successively in an ultrasonic bath. The substrates were dried under an airflow and treated with an ozone-ultraviolet system (Novascan PSPD Pro).
Hole transport layer deposition
A 30–40 nm thick copper-doped NiOx (Cu:NiOx) layer was deposited on cleaned FTO with a reported method. Briefly, nickel and copper metal targets (99.99% purity) were magnetron co-sputtered (Shenyang Tengao Vacuum Technology Co. Ltd., JSS-600) at room temperature. The target–substrate angle and substrate rotation speed were fixed at 37° and 15 rpm. The base and work pressure of the deposition chamber was 4 × 10−4 Pa and 2 Pa. During the deposition, the Ar and O2 flow were fixed at 36 sccm and 6 sccm respectively. The power density applied on nickel and copper targets was 2 W mm−2 and 0.25 W mm−2 respectively. The targets were pre-sputtered for 10 min in order to remove the oxide coating prior to deposition.
Perovskite film deposition
MAPbI3 films were cast on the as-deposited Cu:NiOx films with anti-solvent dripping. The concentration of the precursor solution was 1.5 M (1.383 g PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and 0.477 g CH3NH3I (TCI, 99%) in 0.213 mL dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99%) and 1.905 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99%)). The spinning programme was 4000 rpm for 20 s. During the rotation, 0.5 mL diethyl ether (AR, ≥99.5%, Sinopharm Group Co., Ltd.) was continuously dripped for 2 s from the 7th second after rotation. The as-prepared perovskite films were calcined on a hotplate at 100 °C for 30 min. The fabrication of perovskite films was conducted in a dry room where the temperature and relative humidity (RH) were controlled (temperature: 20 °C, RH < 1%).
Electron transport layer deposition
After the heat treatment, different ETMs were deposited on perovskite films. For [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a 20 mg mL−1 solution was cast on top of the perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s. For ZnO, 50 nm ZnO was magnetron sputtered (Shenyang Tengao Vacuum Technology Co. Ltd., JSS-600) on the perovskite at room temperature. The target/substrate angle and substrate rotation speed were fixed at 37° and 15 rpm. The base and work pressure of the deposition chamber was 4 × 10−4 Pa and 2 Pa. During the deposition, the flow rates for Ar and O2 were 36 sccm and 6 sccm respectively. The input power value for the zinc target was 2 W mm−2. While for the ZnO@PTFE composite ETM, a PTFE layer was first thermally evaporated on the perovskite. A tungsten basket was used as a heating source and a quartz crucible (diameter: 8 mm) was used as the container for the PTFE powder (1 μm, Sigma-Aldrich). The pressure was maintained at ∼10−3 Pa during the deposition. The operation current was gradually increased to 56 A with a ramp rate of 5%. The shutter was not open until the stabilization of PTFE evaporation. The evaporation lasted for 5 min yielding a mesoporous PTFE layer of 200 nm. Then ZnO was magnetron sputtered in the pores with the same parameters as for pure ZnO ETM.
Silver contact deposition
After the deposition of the ETM, a 120 nm thick silver layer was thermally evaporated to complete a full device.
Characterisation
The surface and cross-sectional morphology were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7100). The water contact angles (WCAs) of different surfaces were recorded with a contact angle meter. To evaluate the water vapour resistance properties, the perovskite films without coating and those coated with PCBM, PTFE, ZnO and ZnO@PTFE were stored at 30 °C and 60% relative humidity in a constant humidity temperature chamber for three weeks. The phase composition evolutions of these samples were checked with a Rigaku Ultimax IV X-ray diffractometer. J–V characteristics of solar cells were measured under a xenon lamp (YAMASHITA DENSO, YSS-150 A) simulating AM1.5 G sunlight. The light intensity was calibrated with a reference silicon solar cell (Oriel-91150). An ADCMT 6246 2 channel voltage current source meter was used to collect the current response under different bias. The scan rate used was 40 mV s−1. Forward (short circuit current to open circuit voltage) and reverse scan (open circuit voltage to short circuit current) was conducted to check the J–V hysteresis. The steady-state output of solar cells was tracked at the maximum power point (CHI 660 electrochemical workstation). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on an SM-250 system (Bunkoukeiki, Japan). The intensity of monochromatic light was calibrated with a Si photodiode (S1337-1010BQ). Steady photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted at room temperature on a Horiba FluoroMax-4 device with an excitation wavelength of 457 nm. Time-resolved PL spectra were measured with a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Photo Technology International, Inc.).
Methods
The PbI2 content in the perovskite film is calculated with a semi-quantitative method based on the reference intensity ratio (RIR) with corundum. There are two phases in the calcined perovskite film: rhombohedral PbI2 (Pm1, RIR(PbI2) = 15.21) and tetragonal MAPbI3 (I4mcm, RIR(MAPbI3) = 8.84). The PbI2 weight ratio could be calculated according to  where I(PbI2) and I(MAPbI3) are the integrated intensity of the main diffraction peaks of PbI2 and MAPbI3.
The PL lifetime of the ETM coated CH3NH3PbI3 films was calculated by fitting the experimental decay data with a bi-exponential decay equation:  where I is the transient PL intensity at time t. τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of PL decay in different mechanisms. A1, A2 and B are constants. The effective PL lifetime τ could be calculated with the following equation:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Water contact angles for different surfaces; (b) photographs of the PTFE coated perovskite film before and after water drop sliding. Red lines were drawn to help identify the boundaries of the PTFE coating. The bare perovskite area turned yellow indicating the decomposition of the perovskite and the formation of PbI2; XRD pattern evolution of the bare perovskite film (c), perovskite films coated with PCBM (d), PTFE (e), ZnO (f) and ZnO@PTFE (g) stored in a 30 °C, 60 RH% chamber; (h) PbI2 weight fraction trend with storage time in a 30 °C, 60 RH% chamber.	 
4MAPbI3 + 4H2O ⇌ 4MAPbI3·H2O ⇌ (MA)4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2 + H2O	(2)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Unit cells of the MAPbI3 perovskite (I4/mcm) and perovskite hydrates: MAPbI3·H2O (P21/m) and MA4PbI6·2H2O (Pmna); (b) diffusion mechanisms of molecules in solids. Knudsen diffusion describes the diffusion in a small pore whose diameter is comparable to the molecule size. The moving molecules mainly collide with the walls of the pore. Molecular diffusion happens when the pore size is much larger than the molecules and the molecules mainly collide with each other; bulk diffusion is the diffusion method of molecules through a solid. The molecules are absorbed by the defects in the lattice or the grain boundaries and hop randomly between these sites; (c) illustration of water molecule penetration through different coatings on the perovskite. The main diffusion mechanism of water in amorphous PCBM is Knudsen diffusion through the pinholes and bulk diffusion of absorbed water molecules. The water molecules penetrate through the porous PTFE in a molecular diffusion mechanism because of the fact that the average size of the pores is large. Compact ZnO nearly has no pinholes that allow Knudsen or molecular diffusion. It insulates water molecules at room temperature because of the extremely low diffusion coefficient. The case for ZnO@PTFE is similar to that for ZnO. However, the diffusion coefficient for water molecules might be slightly higher in the PTFE polymer.
