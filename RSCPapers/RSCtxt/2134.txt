    , Accepted 6th April 2012First published on 18th April 2012AbstractSolution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells from silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have shown promising power conversion efficiencies. Here we report on an attempt to enhance the performance of Si NC–polymer hybrid solar cells by using poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) as a hole conductor, which is expected to yield a higher open circuit voltage than P3HT due to its lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Bulk heterojunction solar cells consisting of 3–5 nm silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) and poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) have been fabricated. The properties of the hybrid Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices were studied as a function of the Si NC/MDMO-PPV weight ratio. Cells of 58 wt% 3–5 nm Si NCs showed the best overall performance under simulated one-sun AM 1.5 global illumination (100 mW cm−2). Compared to composite films of Si NCs and poly(3-hexylthiophene), we indeed observed an improved open circuit voltage but a lower power conversion efficiency from the Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices. The lower efficiency of Si NC/MDMO-PPV is correlated to the lower hole mobility and narrower absorption spectrum of MDMO-PPV compared to P3HT.
1. Background
Hybrid solar cells of conductive polymers and inorganic nanocrystals have been studied as a way to combine the ease of solution processing of polymers and colloidal nanocrystals with the stability of inorganic semiconductors. In 1996, Greenham et al. reported the first polymer/nanocrystal solar cell made by dispersing cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanocrystals into the conjugated polymer poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl)-hexyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV).1 The best efficiency cells were obtained by using 90 wt% (weight ratio) nanocrystals, which corresponds to a volume ratio around 50%. Although the best cell had an efficiency lower than 0.1% under AM 1.5 one sun condition and 10% external quantum efficiency at 514 nm, this indicates that there is significant exciton dissociation at the polymer–nanocrystal interface. Greenham et al. also indicated that long ligands on nanocrystal surfaces may impede the transport of carriers between nanocrystals. They attribute low quantum efficiency to the poor electron transport due to the hopping mechanism and trapping problem at the dead-end of nanocrystals. The poor electron transport was improved by introducing CdSe nanorods into the polymer matrix.2 The number of electron hopping events can be reduced by using nanorods, which also have the advantage of high surface-area-to-volume ratio for exciton dissociation.
However, a similar improvement of solar cell performance in hybrid zinc oxide (ZnO)/poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) devices was not observed by replacing ZnO nanocrystals with ZnO nanorods.3 Beek et al. indicate that solar cell preparation of ZnO nanorods/MDMO-PVV is not as easy as that for ZnO NCs/MDMO-PPV. Koster et al. found that the performance of ZnO NCs/MDMO-PPV solar cells was not limited by electron mobility, but rather hole transport in the polymer.4 Beek et al. replaced MDMO-PPV with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) which has a higher hole mobility than MDMO-PPV.5 The hybrid device made by P3HT and ZnO NCs was not as efficient as MDMO-PPV because of coarse mixing and film roughness. These results imply that the hybrid solar cell performance was not only limited by the carrier transport but also the compatibility of nanocrystals and polymer, which may cause the morphological difference.
Hybrid solar cells from Si NCs and P3HT were demonstrated with promising efficiencies.6,7 The use of Si is attractive as it is non-toxic and environmentally benign. Here, we investigate MDMO-PPV as a donor in Si NC/MDMO-PPV solar cells. Compared to the Si NC/P3HT solar cells,6,7 an increase of open-circuit voltage (Voc) is expected due to the fact that MDMO-PPV has a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level than P3HT. We report that hybrid solar cells of Si NC/MDMO-PPV can be made by a solution process and the hole mobility of MDMO-PPV can be measured by replacing the cathodes with the high work function metal.
2. Methods
3–5 nm silicon nanocrystals synthesized from the non-thermal plasma were used as an electron acceptor in the MDMO-PPV polymer matrix. Hybrid solar cells of Si NCs and MDMO-PPV were prepared by spin-coating the blend solution of Si NCs and MDMO-PPV from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) coated indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass substrates in a glove box (oxygen and moisture level < 1 ppm). The composite film thickness was around 50 nm. To complete the devices, 100 nm thick aluminium (Al) electrodes were deposited on top of the composite film under vacuum conditions (<2 × 10−6 Torr). The active area of hybrid device was 0.046 cm2.
2.1 Silicon nanocrystal synthesis and solution preparation
Silicon nanocrystals were synthesized by flowing and dissociating the precursor, silane (SiH4), through a non-thermal plasma reactor under vacuum conditions. 5% SiH4–helium (He) was mixed with argon (Ar) and hydrogen (H2) and passed through a one-half inch outer diameter quartz tube around which a pair of copper electrodes was wrapped.8 The flow rates of 5% SiH4–He, Ar and H2 are 33, 150, and 6 standard cubic centimetres per minute (SCCM), respectively. 135 watts of radio frequency power at 13.56 MHz was applied to the electrodes. The Si NCs were collected downstream of the plasma on a stainless steel mesh. After Si NC deposition, the Si NCs were weighed and transferred to an airtight vial (Sigma-Aldrich, 27150-U) inside a nitrogen-purged glove bag (oxygen level < 25 ppm). The vial was transferred into a glove box immediately after the sealing. 18 mg per 0.5 ml MDMO-PPV (Mw > 500 kg mol−1, American Dye Source, Inc., ADS104RE) in DCB (ACROS) was stirred overnight at 55 °C on a hot plate. 2.5 ml DCB was added to the vial with Si NCs on mesh in a glove box and taken out for sonication for 10 minutes. A syringe was used to transfer the cloudy Si NC solution into the vial containing MDMO-PPV solution. The final concentration of MDMO-PPV was around 6 mg ml−1. After mixing Si NCs and MDMO-PPV, the blend solution was taken out again for sonication before device fabrication.
Hydrosilylation of Si NCs for photoluminescence studies of the Si NC band gap was conducted by attaching the organic molecule, 1-dodecene, onto the Si NC surface. A solution of 5:1 mesitylene/1-dodecene was dried with molecular sieves and degassed by bubbling N2 for 30 minutes on Schlenk line. The Si NCs were collected on the mesh downstream of the plasma. The mesh was transferred into the test tube and sealed with a cap inside the glove bag. The solution of 5:1 mesitylene/1-dodecene after degassing was transferred into the tube until the mesh was immersed in the solution on the Schlenk line. The tube including the solution and mesh was sonicated for 10 minutes to release Si NCs into the solution from the mesh. The cloudy solution after sonication was heated to 220 °C for two hours on the Schlenk line. After the reaction, the cloudy solution became clear, because surface functionalized Si NCs are soluble in the mesitylene.
2.2 Device fabrication
ITO coated glass substrates (Delta Technologies, LTD, CG-51IN-1507) were cleaned and coated with 50 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083 grade from H.C. Starck) in ambient conditions before device fabrication. The PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were subsequently dried in the fume hood on a hot plate at 130 °C for 5 minutes to remove the residual water inside the film. The composite film, consisting of Si NCs and MDMO-PPV, was spin-cast from the blend solution in a glove box. A 100 nm of Al electrode was evaporated under vacuum conditions (<2 × 10−6 Torr). For hole-transport-only devices, the Al electrodes were replaced with Au electrodes.
2.3 Device characterization
The current density–voltage characteristics were recorded in ambient conditions with a computer-controlled Keithley 2611A SourceMeter. To prevent the oxidation of Si NCs and MDMO-PPV during measurement, the devices were sealed in a solar test box which has a leak rate less than 10−9 mbar l s−1. AM 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination was achieved by using Xenon-arc lamp (Oriel, 100W) with AM 0 and AM 1.5D filters (Newport 81090 and 81092). The IPCE measurement was conducted with a monochromator (Newport 74036, blaze wavelength = 500 nm). Optical absorption spectra of Si NCs and MDMO-PPV were measured in transmission mode by an absorption system (Ocean Optics) which includes a combination of deuterium and tungsten halogen lamps (DH-2000-BALL) and a spectrometer (HR2000). Quantum yield measurement of Si NCs was recorded by an integrating sphere consisting of 390 nm UV LED and USB spectrometer (Ocean Optics). The Si NC fluorescence spectrum excited by an LED was picked up by the spectrometer. Film thickness was measured by the SEM.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Si NC/MDMO-PPV solar cells
The photovoltaic performance of the hybrid devices was studied as a function of Si NC/MDMO-PPV weight ratio under AM 1.5G one sun condition (100 mW cm−2) and shown in Fig. 1. The surface of Si NCs was terminated by hydrogen which does not provide complete solubility of the Si NCs in DCB.6,7,9 Therefore, Si NC concentrations higher than 58 wt% cannot be manufactured due to the non-continuous films formed by the agglomeration of Si NCs. Fig. 1a indicates that the Voc increases up to 0.94 V after integrating 3–5 nm Si NCs with MDMO-PPV compared to ∼0.8 V which was obtained for Si NCs of the same size integrated with P3HT.6,7 The observed increase in Voc by ∼0.15 V when replacing P3HT with MDMO-PPV is consistent with the energetic alignment of the polymer HOMO levels, since the HOMO level of MDMO-PPV is around 0.2 eV lower than that of P3HT. It should be noted that an open circuit voltage of the 0.95 V is an exceptionally good result for any silicon based solar cell device!
 Fig. 1  Hybrid solar cell performance based on 3–5 nm Si NC/MDMO-PPV with different Si NC/P3HT weight ratios under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. When silicon concentration is higher than 58 wt%, a continuous film cannot be formed and devices cannot be measured. Each data point and associated error bar represent an average value and standard deviation from a set of six devices on one substrate. Defective devices, which comprise less than 6% of all devices, are ignored. 
The short-circuit current (Isc) increases with increasing Si NC concentration (Fig. 1b), likely due to increase of exciton dissociation area. The excitons generated inside the polymer have a higher probability to diffuse to the Si NC interface at high concentration of Si NCs than at low concentration. The fill factor (FF) increases slightly with the Si NC/MDMO-PPV ratio. As a result, the calculated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) follow the trends observed in Isc and FF, and are shown in Fig. 1d. The best solar cell performance (Fig. 2) was obtained for 58 wt% Si NCs/MDMO-PPV. This cell had a 0.49% PCE and a FF of 0.4, with Isc of 1.29 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.95 V.

The I–V characteristic of the hybrid device was recorded under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G conditions and shows 0.49% PCE and a fill factor of 0.4 with 1.29 mA cm−2 short circuit-current density and 0.95 V open-circuit voltage. The inset shows the energy band alignment of the Si NCs and MDMO-PPV. 
The incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for different Si NC weight ratio devices are shown in Fig. 3. The devices are most efficient near 500 nm, where the highest IPCE is 17% for 58 wt% Si NC/MDMO-PPV. The surface morphology of 58 wt% Si NC/MDMO-PPV film is shown in Fig. 4. Due to the agglomeration of Si NCs, the film roughness may vary in the micrometre range and the rough morphology may be one of the main factors limiting the hybrid solar cell efficiency.6,7 To measure the absorption spectrum of Si NC/MDMO-PPV film (Fig. 5), the composite film was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS coated quartz substrates, which are UV transparent and do not affect the Si absorption spectrum. MDMO-PPV has a strong absorption band between 400 and 600 nm. By increasing the Si NC concentration in the composite film, the UV absorption starts to increase due to the incorporation of Si NCs. There is also a significant increase in the apparent absorption between 600 nm and 800 nm, but it is likely not due to the real absorption of Si NCs. As mentioned above, a non-uniform morphology was observed by the SEM as agglomeration was caused by the non-passivated Si NCs. Due to this agglomeration, the absorption between 600 and 800 nm is likely caused by scattering. This can be validated by the fact that the IPCE spectrum does not show a significant increase in the region between 600 and 800 nm after Si NCs were incorporated into the MDMO-PPV film. This is a reminder that the non-uniform morphology also affects the accuracy of absorption measurement between 300 and 600 nm. For the I–V characterization, the hybrid devices were encapsulated in the nitrogen filled test holder with a quartz window allowing light transmission without blocking the UV light during illumination. A significant degradation was noticed when the hybrid devices were exposed to air.

3.2 Hole transport in Si NC/MDMO-PPV solar cells
The hole mobility of MDMO-PPV in the Si NC/MDMO-PPV blend structure can be obtained from the dark current–voltage curve by using high work function metals to block the electron transport, resulting in hole-transport-only devices.4,7,10 The characteristic of the dark current is space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) and the hole mobility of MDMO-PPV can be obtained by fitting the experimental data with an expression for the SCLC.4,7,10–12 In this section, a hole-only device was fabricated by evaporating gold (Au) as the top electrodes on the 58 wt% Si NC/MDMO-PPV composite film. The work function of Au is very close to the HOMO level of MDMO-PPV (5.1–5.3 eV), such that Au strongly suppresses electron injection into Si NCs and provides a low energetic barrier for hole injection into MDMO-PPV.4,13,14

Fig. 6 shows the experimental data of dark current density–voltage of Si NC/MDMO-PPV films that were measured in these hole-transport-only devices. The Frenkel effect SCLC of a hole-transport-only device is approximated by the following:4,7 (1)where Jh is the hole current density, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 A s V−1 m−1), εr is the relative dielectric constant, μh is the zero-field hole mobility, γh is the field activation factor, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The internal voltage drop, denoted as Vint, was corrected for the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (VRs). The Vint can be expressed as Vint = V − Vbi − VRs(2)where Vbi is the built-in voltage drop caused by the work function difference between bottom and top electrodes, and VRs is the voltage drop from series resistance of the substrates. The experimental data in Fig. 6 were fitted using eqn (1), and the result is shown by the solid line in Fig. 6. The Vbi between PEDOT:PSS (5.0 eV) and Au (5.1 eV) is 0.1 V and the series resistance of PEDOT:PSS on ITO is 75 Ω in our study. To measure the series resistance of the substrates, Al contacts were deposited on the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates. The resistance was obtained from the I–V curve. The relative dielectric constant εr of MDMO-PPV is taken as 2.1.4,7

The solid line represents the fit to the measurement data from eqn (1). The inset shows the hole-transport-only device configuration of the Si NCs and MDMO-PPV. 
At room temperature, a zero-field hole mobility of 7.9 × 10−11 m2 V−1 s−1 with γh = 5.52 × 10−4 (m V−1)0.5 was obtained in the 58 wt% Si NC/MDMO-PPV film. This mobility is close to the hole mobility measured in ZnO NCs/MDMO-PPV films.4,7 A non-uniform distribution of Si NCs was observed in SEM, so the variation in hole mobility between devices is expected. The average hole mobility out of five devices is 8.63 × 10−11 m2 V−1 s−1. The control device of MDMO-PPV only has a mobility of 1.5 × 10−9 to 2.6 × 10−10 m2 V−1 s−1 (γh = 0). The presence of Si NCs in the MDMO-PPV matrix obviously reduces the hole transport.
3.3 Comparing Si NC/MDMO-PPV with Si NC/P3HT solar cells
Photoluminescence (PL) from Si NCs can provide more information about the band shift of Si NCs. To measure the PL signal from Si NCs, the surface states of Si NCs need to be passivated with organic molecules.15 The surface of Si NCs is terminated by hydrogen and hydrosilylation of the Si–Hx surface with 1-dodecene as the organic ligand was used to passivate the Si NC surface in this study. Silicon nanocrystals were collected downstream of the plasma and sealed inside a test tube in a nitrogen-purged glove bag (oxygen level < 25 ppm). A solution of 5:1 mesitylene/1-dodecene was mixed with Si NCs and reacted at 200 °C for 2 hours in a Schlenk line. The mixture of solution transformed from a cloudy to a transparent solution after reaction. The PL spectrum (Fig. 7) was measured in the integrating sphere using a USB spectrometer. The valance band (VB) and conduction band (CB) shift are not equal in quantum-confined Si NCs. An estimate of Si NC band gap can be expressed as16 Egap = 3ΔCB + 1.1 (eV)(3)where the VB shift is equal to twice CB band shift. The luminescence peak of 3–5 nm Si NCs is around 850 nm (1.46 eV). Hence the VB level of 850 nm luminescent Si NCs is around 0.24 eV lower than that of bulk Si (5.1 eV) and the HOMO level of MDMO-PPV is around 5.3 eV. These results suggest that Si NCs which have a luminescence wavelength above 850 nm may not efficiently prevent hole injection from MDMO-PPV into the Si NCs, where recombination with electrons could occur leading to a reduction in FF and Isc.17 Compared to the Si NC/P3HT solar cells, the HOMO of P3HT is about 0.2 eV higher than MDMO-PPV. Hence, when combined with P3HT most of the 3–5 nm Si NCs provide a barrier against hole injection from P3HT into the Si NCs. However, in the MDMO-PPV/Si NCs junction this barrier to hole injection into the Si NCs is reduced, likely leading to higher recombination. This may be one of the reasons why the Si NC/MDMO-PPV cells have lower Isc and FF than Si NC/P3HT cells. Moreover, P3HT has a broader absorption (400–650 nm) than MDMO-PPV (400–600 nm) and the Si NCs only contribute to the absorption in the blue and UV range of the spectrum. Hence, exciton generation in P3HT may be more efficient than in MDMO-PPV under AM 1.5G conditions. Furthermore, the hole mobility in the Si NCs/P3HT film (1.1 × 10−9 m2 V−1 s−1) is also around one order of magnitude higher than in the Si NC/MDMO-PPV film (8.63 × 10−11 m2 V−1 s−1).7 The low hole mobility in MDMO-PPV could cause electron–hole recombination before the holes reach the anode. These arguments may explain why the Si NC/MDMO-PPV cells are not as efficient as the Si NC/P3HT cells. It may be possible to reduce the recombination at the MDMO-PPV and Si NCs interface and increase solar cell efficiency by using Si NCs smaller than 3–5 nm as recombination losses will be reduced. However, a major challenge remains in obtaining a MDMO-PPV/Si NC film with good morphology, as the Si NCs with hydrogen terminated surfaces have poor solubility in any solvent. Recent advances of “ligand-less” group IV NC colloids, as recently demonstrated in ref. 18, may present an interesting opportunity to produce MDMO-PPV/Si NC with better morphology and higher weight percentage of Si NCs. This may lead to a better performance of the solar cells discussed here.

4. Conclusions
We have studied Si NC/MDMO-PPV solar cells fabricated by spin-coating blends of Si NCs and MDMO-PPV onto PEDOT:PSS coated ITO glass substrates. The hybrid solar cell based on 58 wt% Si NC/MDMO-PPV provides an estimated efficiency of 0.49% PCE under AM 1.5G one sun condition with an IPCE of 17% near 500 nm. While the Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices have a Voc of 0.95 V, which is an exceptionally large Voc for any silicon solar cell and larger than the Voc of similar Si NC/P3HT devices (0.8 V), the Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices do not perform as well as Si NC/P3HT devices. This is due to the fact that the advantage of a larger Voc is overwhelmed by other effects: the absorption spectrum of MDMO-PPV (400–600 nm) is narrower than that of P3HT (400–650 nm), thus more photons are absorbed in P3HT than MDMO-PPV under AM 1.5G conditions. Also, a large fraction of the 3–5 nm Si NCs may not provide an energy band alignment sufficient to prevent hole transfer from the polymer into the Si NCs as the HOMO level of MDMO-PPV is around 0.2 eV lower than that of P3HT. Hence, the exciton recombination probability in Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices may be higher than that in Si NC/P3HT devices. Moreover, the hole mobility measurements on Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices show that MDMO-PPV has a hole mobility lower than P3HT. Assuming that the electron mobility in Si NC/P3HT and Si NC/MDMO-PPV devices is the same, the hole mobility of the MDMO-PPV polymer may be an important limiting factor for the solar cell efficiency. However, the fact that a larger Voc was achieved is still an important result, as some of the efficiency reducing mechanisms may be overcome with a more sophisticated device design. For instance, the use of plasmonic structures in combination with Si NC/MDMO-PPV may increase the absorption, even for smaller film thicknesses, which may enhance the benefits of having a large Voc.

 	Fig. 2  Current–voltage characteristic (I–V) of a 58 wt% 3–5 nm Si NC/MDMO-PPV solar cell (main plot). The I–V characteristic of the hybrid device was recorded under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G conditions and shows 0.49% PCE and a fill factor of 0.4 with 1.29 mA cm−2 short circuit-current density and 0.95 V open-circuit voltage. The inset shows the energy band alignment of the Si NCs and MDMO-PPV.	 

 	Fig. 3  Incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency spectrum of 3–5 nm Si NC/MDMO-PPV solar cell at different Si weight concentrations. 58 wt%, 50 wt% and 25 wt% Si NCs are represented with solid, dashed, and dash-dotted lines, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of 58 wt% 3–5 nm Si NC/MDMO-PPV films. (a and b) Top-view images at different magnifications show Si NC agglomerates larger than 10 μm in size. (c) A cross-section shows the film thickness variation which may deteriorate solar cell efficiency.	 

 	Fig. 5  Room-temperature optical absorption spectra of Si NCs-only, 0 wt%, 25 wt%, 50 wt% and 58 wt% 3–5 nm Si NC/MDMO-PPV, and P3HT-only films on quartz. The absorbance of the Si NC/MDMO-PPV film below 400 nm is due to Si NCs.
