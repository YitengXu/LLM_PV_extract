    , Accepted 3rd October 2016First published on 13th October 2016AbstractMethylammonium (MA) lead triiodide (MAPbI3) has recently emerged as a promising solar cell material. However, MAPbI3 is known to have chemical instability, i.e., MAPbI3 is prone to decomposition into MAI and PbI2 even at moderate temperatures (e.g. 330 K). Here, we show that the chemical instability, as reflected by the calculated negligible enthalpy of formation of MAPbI3 (with respect to MAI and PbI2), has an unusual and important consequence for defect properties, i.e., defect formation energies in low-carrier-density MAPbI3 are nearly independent of the chemical potentials of constituent elements and thus can be uniquely determined. This allows straightforward calculations of defect concentrations and the activation energy of ionic conductivity (the sum of the formation energy and the diffusion barrier of the charged mobile defect) in MAPbI3. The calculated activation energy for ionic conductivity due to  diffusion is in excellent agreement with the experimental values, which demonstrates unambiguously that  is the dominant diffusing defect and is responsible for the observed ion migration and device polarization in MAPbI3 solar cells. The calculated low formation energy of a Frenkel pair  and low diffusion barriers of  and  suggest that the iodine ion migration and the resulting device polarization may occur even in single-crystal devices and grain-boundary-passivated polycrystalline thin film devices (which were previously suggested to be free from ion-migration-induced device polarization), leading to device degradation. However, the device polarization due to the Frenkel pair (which has a relatively low concentration) may take a long time to develop and thus may avoid the appearance of the current–voltage hysteresis at typical scan rates.
I. Introduction
Halide perovskite solar cells, such as methylammonium (MA) lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells, have recently undergone rapid development.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of halide perovskite solar cells has exceeded 22%.2 Currently, chemical and electrical instabilities are major challenges facing the development of MAPbI3 based solar cells.3–5 MAPbI3 starts to decompose at moderate temperatures (e.g., 330 K).3 The high density of defects and their diffusion lead to unusual phenomena (such as hysteresis in current–voltage curves,5–8 giant dielectric constant,7,9 switchable photovoltaic effect,10 photon-induced phase separation,11etc.), which strongly affect the solar cell performance. Defect management is clearly critically important to the improvement of the solar cell efficiency.
Previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect levels in MAPbI3 have provided important understanding on the efficient carrier transport and the high PCE in halide perovskite solar cells.12–17 Hybrid density functional calculations show that, among native point defects (including vacancies, interstitials, and antisites), only the iodine interstitial (Ii) and its complexes introduce deep levels inside the band gap of MAPbI3.15 The shallow nature of most of the defects,15 especially the iodine vacancy (which is abundant),18 contributes strongly to the long carrier drifting length in MAPbI3.19–22 The defect diffusion barriers have been calculated and iodine related defects were found to be fast diffusers,8,23–26 which agrees with some experiments8,27 but is inconsistent with some others.28
Despite the recent progress, the understanding of the defect formation and diffusion in CH3NH3PbI3 is still incomplete. Calculated defect formation energies by different authors showed qualitative differences. For example, between the two most important donor defects, i.e., iodine vacancy  and MA interstitial , Yin et al. showed that  is more stable than  (ref. 12) whereas Buin et al. showed the opposite;13 between the two low-energy acceptor defects, i.e., MA vacancy  and iodine interstitial , Yin et al. showed that  has a lower formation energy than  (ref. 12) whereas Buin et al. showed that the formation energies of the two defects are close to each other and their relative stability depends on the chemical potentials.13 Moreover, the reported defect formation energies change substantially with the elemental chemical potentials,12,13,16 which makes it difficult to determine defect concentrations in MAPbI3. Comparison between theoretical and experimental results on defect concentrations is usually difficult because there is no good method to make a connection between theoretical elemental chemical potentials and experimental growth conditions. The chemical-potential-dependent defect formation energies also prevent unambiguous determination of the activation energy for ionic conductivity (which is the sum of the formation energy and the diffusion barrier of the charged diffusing defect)26 in MAPbI3. The accurate calculation of the activation energy for ionic conductivity in MAPbI3 will help determine the identity of the main diffusing defect in MAPbI3.
MAPbI3 is usually semi-insulating with low free carrier density.29,30 In this paper, we show that, in low-carrier-density MAPbI3, defect formation energies are nearly independent of elemental chemical potentials and the Fermi level. Thus, the defect formation energy and the activation energy for ionic conductivity can be uniquely determined. We demonstrate that the weak dependence of the defect formation energy on chemical potentials is due to the very small (negligible) enthalpy of formation of MAPbI3 with respect to MAI and PbI2.  is unambiguously identified as the dominant diffusing defect based on the calculated defect diffusion barriers and the chemical-potential-independent defect formation energies. We further show that the formation of Frenkel pairs and their subsequent diffusion in MAPbI3 may lead to device polarization even in single-crystal and grain-boundary-passivated MAPbI3, which were previously suggested to be free from ion-migration-induced device polarization.
II. Method
Here, we briefly introduce the method for defect calculations. The defect formation energy is given by31 (1)where ED and E0 are the total energies of the defect-containing and the host (i.e. defect-free) supercells. Formation of a defect involves exchange of atoms with their respective chemical reservoirs. The second term in eqn (1) represents the change in energy due to such exchange of atoms, where ni is the difference in the number of atoms for the ith atomic species between the defect-containing and defect-free supercells. μi is the relative chemical potential for the ith atomic species, referenced to its bulk μrefi.31 The third term in eqn (1) represents the change in energy due to exchange of electrons with their reservoir. εVBM is the energy of the valence band maximum (VBM) and εf is the Fermi energy relative to the VBM.
If the single-phase MAPbI3 is formed without secondary phases of MAI and PbI2, the following conditions should be satisfied: μMA + μPb + 3μI = ΔH(MAPbI3),(2) μMA + μI ≤ ΔH(MAI),(3) μPb + 2μI ≤ ΔH(PbI2),(4)where ΔH(MAPbI3), ΔH(MAI) and ΔH(PbI2) are the enthalpies of formation of MAPbI3, MAI, and PbI2, respectively, which are defined with respect to the energies of the Pb metal, the neutral MA molecule, and the solid-phase I.31
Defect calculations in this paper are based on DFT as implemented in VASP.32 The electron-ion interactions were described using projector augmented wave potentials.33 The valence wavefunctions were expanded in a plane-wave basis with a cut-off energy of 400 eV. All atoms were relaxed to minimize the Feynman–Hellmann forces to below 0.02 eV Å−1. A 2 × 2 × 1 tetragonal supercell containing 16 formula units of CH3NH3PbI3 in conjunction with a 1 × 1 × 2 grid for k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was used. The finite-size correction for the supercell calculations (i.e., image charge correction for charged defects and the potential alignment correction)34 was applied. The calculated static dielectric constant of 21.7 (ref. 14) was used for image charge correction. The phase diagram and defect properties were obtained based on the room-temperature tetragonal phase of MAPbI3 and experimental lattice constants of a = 8.849 Å and c = 12.642 Å.35.
III. Results and discussion
A. Phase diagram

Fig. 1 shows the phase diagram of MAPbI3 based on the enthalpies of formation (eqn (2)–(4)) calculated using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals without spin–orbit coupling (PBE-non-SOC).36 The secondary phases, i.e., MAI and PbI2, are also shown. It can be seen that the stable region of MAPbI3 in the phase diagram is essentially a straight boundary line between the MAI and the PbI2 phases. Thus, μMA + μI = ΔH(MAI),(5)

and μPb + 2μI = ΔH(PbI2).(6)
The reason for the chemical potentials to satisfy eqn (5) and (6) is that the calculated enthalpy of formation of MAPbI3 with respect to MAI and PbI2 is essentially zero, i.e., ΔH′(MAPbI3) = ΔH(MAPbI3) – ΔH(PbI2) – ΔH(MAI) ≈ 0.(7)
It can be easily seen that eqn (2)–(4) and (7) lead to eqn (5) and (6). ΔH′(MAPbI3) should usually be negative if MAPbI3 is stable against decomposition into PbI2 and MAI. However, our calculations at the PBE level using experimental lattice parameters show that ΔH′(MAPbI3) is near zero and slightly positive (0.004 eV).37 This result is in good agreement with a previous calculation, which also showed that ΔH′(MAPbI3) is near zero.16 It has been observed experimentally that the decomposition of MAPbI3 into PbI2 and MAI already occurs at 330 K,3 consistent with the calculated small ΔH′(MAPbI3). Entropy may play a role in the stabilization of MAPbI3. In Fig. 1, the phase diagram is plotted with ΔH′(MAPbI3) = 0 (eqn (7)). Eqn (7) is the root cause for the independence of defect formation energies on the chemical potentials in low-carrier-density MAPbI3 as detailed below.
B. Defect formation energies

Fig. 2 shows the formation energies of vacancy and interstitial defects in MAPbI3 calculated at the three different points in the phase diagram in Fig. 1. We have also investigated antisite defects in MAPbI3. The structural relaxation of antisite defects shows that they are in fact all complexes of a vacancy and an interstitial14,15 and thus are not further studied. For example,  is a complex of  and , which repel each other. Such defect complexes should have higher energies than individual defects.
 Fig. 2  Formation energies of vacancy and interstitial defects in MAPbI3 calculated using the chemical potentials corresponding to points A (a), B (b), and C (c) in Fig. 1. Defect formation energies are calculated using the PBE-non-SOC method while the VBM and the CBM are corrected by the HSE-SOC method as shown in the figure. The crossing point between the formation energy lines of  and  is shown by the dashed lines; the formation energies of  at the crossing point do not change with chemical potentials; the Fermi level is pinned by the crossing point at εpinf in (a) and (b). 
The band gap correction using Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functionals (with 43% Fock exchange)38,39 and the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) produces a band gap of 1.50 eV for MAPbI3, in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.51–1.52 eV.35,40 The HSE-SOC calculation moves both the VBM and the conduction band minimum (CBM) downwards significantly relative to those in the PBE-non-SOC calculation,15 as can be seen in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(c), the formation energy of  is always negative when the Fermi level is within the HSE-SOC band gap. Thus, the chemical potentials used in Fig. 1(c), which correspond to the Pb-rich and the I-poor condition (point C in Fig. 1), lead to a degenerate semiconductor with the Fermi level above the CBM, which is inconsistent with experimental observations of low-carrier-density semiconducting MAPbI3.29 More Pb-poor/I-rich conditions (e.g., points A and B) produce defect formation energies [Fig. 2(a) and (b)] that can pin the Fermi level within the band gap.
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the most stable donor and acceptor defects are always  and , respectively, regardless of the values of the chemical potentials. The defect concentration under thermal equilibrium is given by ND = N0exp(−ΔH/kT),(8)where N0 is the number of available sites for defect formation, ΔH is the defect formation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. If the concentrations of  and  are much higher than the free carrier density and concentrations of other charged defects and impurities, the charge neutrality of the material is largely determined by  and  and the Fermi level is pinned approximately at the crossing point between the formation energy lines of  and  [εpinf in Fig. 2(a) and (b)].
Although the defect formation energies and the Fermi level change substantially with different chemical potentials, the close examination of Fig. 2 reveals that, regardless of the values of the chemical potentials, the formation energies of  are nearly constant when εf = εpinf as summarized in Table 1.

If neglecting the free carrier density and considering only three lowest-energy defects , the charge neutrality condition is  following eqn (1) and (8), where NI, NPb, and NMA are the numbers of I, Pb, and MA sites (NI = 3NPb = 3NMA). It can be shown that, at the typical growth temperature ∼100 °C, εf = εpinf + 0.004 eV and the defect formation energies deviate from those shown in Table 1 by ±0.004 eV for ±1 charged defects and by ±0.008 eV for ±2 charged defects. The contribution of  to the charge balance is negligible compared to those of  and . Thus, εf = εpinf is a good approximation as long as εpinf is not close to the band edges (low free carrier density).
The defect formation energies of  in Table 1 are nearly independent of chemical potentials. Vacancies have lower formation energies than interstitials in MAPbI3, which is expected because the formation of interstitial defects is less favorable in the close-packed perovskite structure. Among the three interstitials,  has the lowest formation energy while the larger ion  and the ion with a higher charge state  have higher formation energies.
C. Why are defect formation energies independent of chemical potentials?
The independence of defect formation energies on elemental chemical potentials in MAPbI3 is unusual. Here, we show that this uncommon behavior is caused by the near zero enthalpy of formation of MAPbI3 with respect to MAI and PbI2 (eqn (7)) and the related property that the elemental chemical potentials in MAPbI3 are nearly the same as those in MAI and PbI2 (eqn (5) and (6)).
Since the Fermi level is pinned approximately at εpinf [see Fig. 2(a) and (b)], (9)
Using eqn (1) and (9), one can show that (10)where  and  are the total energies of the supercells that contain  and , respectively, and E(PbI2) is the total energy of PbI2 per formula unit. ΔE(PbI2) is given by ΔE(PbI2) = μPb – 2μI − ΔH(PbI2) = 0,(11)ΔE(PbI2) is the only term in  (eqn (10)) where the chemical potentials appear. ΔE(PbI2) = 0 due to eqn (6).
With the chemical-potential dependence eliminated by ΔE(PbI2) = 0, one can calculate  in eqn (10) and  based on the PBE-non-SOC calculations, which yield . The formation energy of a Schottky defect , which is independent of chemical potentials and the Fermi level, is calculated to be 0.49 eV. Consequently, the formation energy of  is . Note that the calculated formation energy of a Schottky defect in tetragonal MAPbI3 (0.49 eV) is significantly higher than that (0.14 eV)41 in cubic MAPbI3 (the high-temperature phase). This is likely because the cubic MAPbI3 is less stable and more prone to defect formation.
Now we have shown that the formation energies of the three vacancy defects are independent of chemical potentials, which is due to ΔH′(MAPbI3) = 0 in eqn (7). Next, we show that the formation energies of the three interstitial defects are also independent of chemical potentials for the same reason [i.e., ΔH′(MAPbI3) = 0].
The formation energies of the three interstitial defects  can be related to those of vacancies by (12) (13)
and (14)where  is the total energy of the supercell that contains , and E(MAI) is the total energy of MAI per formula unit, and ΔE(MAI) = μMA + μI − ΔH(MAI) = 0.(15)ΔE(PbI2) and ΔE(MAI) in eqn (12)–(14) have apparent chemical potential dependence; but they are both zero due to eqn (5) and (6). Thus,  in eqn (12)–(14) are all independent of chemical potentials. The results obtained by the PBE-non-SOC calculations of eqn (12)–(14) are the same as those in Table 1.
The formation energies of vacancies and interstitials in MAPbI3 have been shown above to be independent of elemental chemical potentials. Consequently, the formation energy of antisite defects is also independent of elemental chemical potentials because an antisite defect is a complex of a vacancy and an interstitial.
D. Activation energy for ionic conductivity
Being able to uniquely determine defect formation energies without chemical potential dependence enables us to calculate straightforwardly the defect concentrations and the activation energy of ionic conductivity in MAPbI3. The activation energy for ionic conductivity is the sum of the formation energy and the diffusion barrier of the defect (ΔEa = ΔH + ΔEb).26 Based on the calculated defect formation energies in Table 1 and the calculated defect diffusion barriers in ref. 26, ΔH + ΔEb values for  are calculated and shown in Table 2.  has a very high diffusion barrier23–25 and is thus not considered here.

The experimentally measured activation energy (ΔEa) for ionic conductivity ranges from 0.36 eV to 0.43 eV.27,28,42 It is clear from Table 2 that only  has the activation energy which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The activation energies for other defects are too high. Now, with the help of the chemical-potential-independent defect formation energies, we can unambiguously show that  is the dominant diffusing defect in MAPbI3. This result agrees with recent experimental results.27,43
E. Defect concentrations

 and  have low diffusion barriers (see Table 2) and thus are able to diffuse at room temperature and equilibrate with their reservoirs (which are surfaces, grain boundaries (GBs), and interfaces).44 Therefore, the concentration of  and  can be calculated at room temperature using eqn (8). The thermal equilibrium concentrations of  and  at 300 K are calculated to be ∼5 × 1020 cm−3 and ∼5 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. These values are much higher than the free carrier density in insulating MAPbI3,30 thus justifying the Fermi level pinning by vacancy defects  as shown in Section III-B. The coexistence of the high density of  and the long carrier diffusion length demonstrates the unique property of MAPbI3, i.e., the high dielectric constant (∼60–70)45–47 in MAPbI3, on one hand, promotes the defect formation, and on the other hand, provides strong screening to charged defects and suppresses charge localization.14,18,26 Our previous calculations show that VI is a shallow donor defect; therefore, despite its high concentration, its effect on the carrier transport is small.15,48
Although the  concentration (5 × 1016 cm−3) is much lower than that of  (5 × 1020 cm−3), it is still significant. The (0/-) level for Ii is Ev + 0.15 eV (calculated at the HSE-SOC level),15 which is close to an observed defect level ∼Ev + 0.16 eV measured using admittance spectroscopy.49 However, our calculations show that  does not insert a single-particle level inside the band gap although its thermodynamic hole trapping level, the (0/-) level, is inside the band gap.15 This result suggests that the hole trapping at the (0/-) level of Ii may involve a kinetic barrier, thereby reducing the hole trapping cross-section. The absence of single-particle levels of  in the band gap also suggests that  cannot be excited by sub-band-gap excitation and thus cannot be easily seen in optical absorption experiments.50
F. Ion migration and device polarization due to Frenkel pairs
Significant ion migration in MAPbI3 has been reported3,8,10,23–25,27,28,44,51 and is likely the cause of the current–voltage hysteresis.5–8 Ionic conductivity can be caused by the formation and diffusion of vacancy defects. The formation of a vacancy requires moving an atom from the bulk to the surface, interface, or grain boundaries. Thus, passivating grain boundaries should reduce the available vacancies and suppress the hysteresis. Indeed, there are many reports on the elimination of hysteresis by grain boundary passivation (by fullerenes,52,53 chlorine,54 or Spiro-OMeTAD55) and by reducing the area of the grain boundaries by increasing the grain size.56 Recently, Shao et al. showed that ion migration dominates at grain boundaries and that the current–voltage hysteresis is nearly absent in the interior of the grain.57 These experimental results suggest that the device polarization may be suppressed in single-crystal devices and grain-boundary-passivated devices.
However, ionic conductivity can also be caused by the formation of Frenkel pairs (vacancy–interstitial pairs). A Frenkel pair is formed by displacing an atom from a lattice site to an interstitial site, which does not involve surfaces, interfaces, and grain boundaries. Thus, the ionic conductivity due to the formation of Frenkel pairs cannot be prevented by passivating grain boundaries or increasing the grain size. The formation energy of an isolated  and an isolated  is only 0.4 eV (see Table 1), which leads to a concentration of about 2 × 1015 cm−3. The diffusion barriers of  and  are both very low (see Table 2), enabling their fast diffusion at room temperature. Although the concentration of the Frenkel pairs is relatively low, under an external electric field, it would just be a matter of time for a significant amount of Frenkel pairs to be formed and separated, followed by the diffusion of individual vacancies and interstitials and their accumulation near the electron- and hole-selective contacts. However, ion migration caused by the formation of Frenkel pairs and their diffusion may not cause the current–voltage hysteresis at typical scan rates due to the low concentration of the Frenkel pairs and consequently a low level of device polarization within the time scale of the current–voltage scan; but it may still cause significant device polarization over an extended period of time (e.g., hundreds of hours).
IV. Conclusions
We show that defect formation energies are nearly independent of elemental chemical potentials and the Fermi level in MAPbI3 if the defect concentration is much higher than the free carrier density. This is due to the negligible enthalpy of formation of MAPbI3 with respect to MAI and PbI2. As a result, the formation energies of  are uniquely determined to be 0.08 eV, 0.08 eV, 0.16 eV, 0.32 eV, 1.03 eV, and 0.75 eV, respectively, by DFT-PBE calculations. The calculated concentration of  at 300 K is very high (∼5 × 1020 cm−3). The calculated activation energy for ionic conductivity due to  diffusion (the sum of the formation energy and the diffusion barrier of ) is 0.34–0.42 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental values (0.36–0.43 eV). This result shows unambiguously that  is the dominant diffusing defect in MAPbI3. The calculated low formation energy (0.4 eV) of the Frenkel pair  and the low diffusion barriers of  and  suggest that the iodine ion migration and the resulting device polarization may occur even in single-crystal devices and grain-boundary-passivated polycrystalline thin film devices, which were previously suggested to be free from ion-migration-induced device polarization. However, the device polarization due to the Frenkel pair (which has a relatively low concentration) may take a long time to develop and thus may avoid the appearance of the current–voltage hysteresis at typical scan rates.

 	Fig. 1  Calculated phase diagram of MAPbI3. The stable region of MAPbI3 is extremely narrow, only a straight boundary line between the MAI and the PbI2 phases.	 
μPb + 2μI = ΔH(PbI2).	(6)
ΔH′(MAPbI3) = ΔH(MAPbI3) – ΔH(PbI2) – ΔH(MAI) ≈ 0.	(7)

 	Fig. 2  Formation energies of vacancy and interstitial defects in MAPbI3 calculated using the chemical potentials corresponding to points A (a), B (b), and C (c) in Fig. 1. Defect formation energies are calculated using the PBE-non-SOC method while the VBM and the CBM are corrected by the HSE-SOC method as shown in the figure. The crossing point between the formation energy lines of  and  is shown by the dashed lines; the formation energies of  at the crossing point do not change with chemical potentials; the Fermi level is pinned by the crossing point at εpinf in (a) and (b).
