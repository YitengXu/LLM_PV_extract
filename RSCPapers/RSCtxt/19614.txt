    , Accepted 20th February 2018First published on 20th February 2018AbstractThis communication describes a new method to achieve reversible light-induced chemical composition and phase structural transitions from polyvinylpyrrolidone-capped orthorhombic CsPbBr3 to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets or vice versa. This work will deepen our understanding of the controlled synthesis, post-processing, and decomposition pathway of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals.
The past few years have witnessed remarkable progress in the application of the high-performance optical and optoelectronic characteristics of organic–inorganic and all-inorganic lead-halide-based perovskite materials and their derivatives.1–4 Manipulating the composition, size, and morphology of perovskite materials, promoting their photoluminescence quantum yield and power conversion efficiencies in solar cells, as well as overcoming their inherent instability are the trends of current research.5–8 Currently, most of these efforts are based on the classic all-inorganic perovskite materials, i.e., ABX3, typically A = Cs+; B = Pb2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−, or combinations thereof, which are typically cubic or orthorhombic.3 Other compositions and phases of all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite derivatives, such as tetragonal CsPb2Br5 and hexagonal Cs4PbBr6, may also have unique properties and have potential for broad optical and optoelectronic applications.9–13
Recently, there have been a few reports on the synthesis of tetragonal CsPb2Br5 and hexagonal Cs4PbBr6.14–19 Both of them have improved stability and excellent optical performance.11,13,20–22 The shape or morphology control of tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanocrystals has been achieved by tuning the types and ratios of the ligands.11,13 Moreover, the phase controlled synthesis of tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanocrystals has also been achieved by the tuning the ratio of their precursors or using different alkyl-thiol ligands.11–13,20 On one hand, the phase-controlled synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite materials is still in its early phases, where the crystalline phases are extremely sensitive to the ratios of the elements in the precursors, the post-processing, and the film-forming strategies.9 On the other hand, the study of the ligand induced phase evolution process is in its infancy.13
Herein, we demonstrate a new method to achieve reversible light induced compositional and structural transitions from orthorhombic CsPbBr3 to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets or vice versa. Two-dimensional sheet-like CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were synthesized following the literature23 using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the capping ligands.24 The precursors were dispersed in a “good” solvent and then added into a “poor” solvent to form the single-crystalline orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanosheets. The morphology of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals was controlled using different “poor” solvents and ligands.6 Benefiting from hydrophilic PVP as the capping ligands, the as-prepared CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were easily dispersed in ethanol. The CsPbBr3 nanosheets gradually dissociated CsBr and they gradually turned from a crystalline phase into tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets,10 which are a stable crystalline perovskite phase in polar solvent. Interestingly, the dissolved CsBr was re-embedded into the crystal lattice, and the tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets were reversibly transformed into light stable orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanosheets under white light illumination with a xenon lamp.

Scheme 1 shows a diagram of the reversible compositional and structural transition processes between orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets. The PVP-capped CsPbBr3 nanosheets (CsPbBr3@PVP) were formed by a reprecipitation process at room temperature (for more details see the ESI†). The as-prepared CsPbBr3 nanosheets were easily precipitated by centrifugation at 7000 rpm, and then transferred into ethanol for further compositional and structural transition studies. It is well known that the crystal structure of cesium lead halide perovskites can be easily broken down due to their soft ionic nature, so the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals would be dissolved in polar solvents to form free ions (such as Cs+, Pb2+, and Br−).25,26 It should be noted that CsBr can be easily dissolved in ethanol, whereas PbBr2 did not dissolve in ethanol. In our synthesis, the CsPbBr3@PVP nanosheets gradually dissociated a portion of CsBr in ethanol, where PVP acted as a thick ligand shell to slow down such a process. Therefore, orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanosheets gradually underwent a dissociation process to dissolve out a portion of CsBr in ethanol and their crystalline phase gradually changes to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  A schematic diagram of reversible light-induced structural transitions from orthorhombic CsPbBr3 to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets. 
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 nanosheets (Fig. S1, ESI†) show an orthorhombic phase (the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 15.3°, 21.6°, 30.5°, 34.5°, 37.8°, and 43.9° correspond to diffractions from the {100}, {110}, {002}, {210}, {211}, and {202} planes of orthorhombic CsPbBr3 (PDF#01-072-7929, Fig. 1A red bars)), and the orthorhombic phase began to transform into tetragonal CsPb2Br5 when the CsPbBr3 nanosheets were transferred into ethanol (Fig. 1A). After 24 h storage under dark conditions, the crystalline phase of the perovskite nanosheets mainly transformed into tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11.6, 23.2, 24, 29.3, 37.9, and 47.7 correspond to the {002}, {210}, {202}, {213}, {313}, and {413} planes of the tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (PDF#25-0211, Fig. 1A black bars and Fig. 1A)),13,20 and the tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets mainly transformed into orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanosheets again after 1 h continuous illumination (Fig. 1A). As tetragonal CsPb2Br5 is a semiconductor, it can absorb suitable light. Due to its low PL efficiency, most of the absorbed energy may transform into local heat, which may accelerate the recrystalization of the dissolved CsBr into tetragonal CsPb2Br5 to lead the phase transition. Thus, we observed the compositional and structural transformation from orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanosheets to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets involving the dissociation of metal halide bonds followed by structural reorganization without light.

(C) The in situ PL measurements to reveal the dynamic PL evolution arising from the phase transition. (D and E) PL measurements monitoring the phase transition cycles from tetragonal CsPb2Br5 to orthorhombic CsPbBr3 with light-on illumination, and the corresponding PL peak areas without light and after 60 minutes continuous light-on illumination. 
Interestingly, reversible compositional and structural transition cycles were performed repeatedly at least six times (Fig. 1B, Fig. S2A and B, ESI†), which demonstrates the good cycle performance of the phase transition cycles. As the transition is reversible, the reversible light-mediated compositional and structural transitions cannot be completed due to the dissolution of CsBr in ethanol. Although the reversible transitions are incomplete, the proportion of both components can show the transition trends. The quantitative results of the phase transition processes were exemplified by the characteristic peak ratios of both tetragonal (11.6°) and orthorhombic (15.3°) perovskites in each phase transition cycle. Using the data in Fig. 1A, the tetragonal/orthorhombic ratio (It/Io) evolution was re-plotted in Fig. 1B (I11.6/I15.3). The tetragonal phase dominates when the perovskites were dispersed in ethanol in a dark room, and the I11.6/I15.3 ratio is in the range of 4–7. Whereas, the orthorhombic phase dominated when the perovskites dispersed in ethanol were introduced to continuous illumination, and the I11.6/I15.3 ratio is in the range of 0.3–0.5. Thus, we observed the light-induced compositional and structural transformation from tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets to orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanosheets involving association of metal halide bonds followed by structural reorganization.
The PL performance of tetragonal CsPb2Br5 and orthorhombic CsPbBr3 is quite different.27 The PL QY of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 nanosheets (dispersed in toluene) is 6.7%; whereas, the transformed CsPb2Br5 nanosheets (dispersed in ethanol) is less than 0.1%. Therefore, the PL results are the combination of both materials,28 and the PL of orthorhombic CsPbBr3 dominates the whole signal. As shown in Fig. 1C and Fig. S3 (ESI†), the PL measurement was used to monitor the dynamic process of the phase transition from tetragonal CsPb2Br5 to orthorhombic CsPbBr3 in the case of continuous illumination. The original tetragonal CsPb2Br5 exhibited a weak PL performance due to its indirect band gap. With increasing illumination time, tetragonal CsPb2Br5 gradually converted to orthorhombic CsPbBr3, and the PL intensity was enhanced. Simultaneously, the photonic damage process occurred, which caused the PL intensity to decrease.29 As a result, the PL intensity first increased due to the phase transition, then decreased due to the photonic damage in 0–30 min. Though the photonic damage led to the PL intensity decreasing, the PL intensity was still stronger than the original one. As the illuminating time went on, the efficiency of the phase transition increased, and the PL intensity increased again. Finally, the PL intensity increased by about 16.5 times after 120 min continuous illumination (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3, ESI†). Such an increase in PL intensity was obtained in every cycle, and quantitative results are shown in Fig. 1D, E and Fig. S2C, D (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1D and Fig. S2C (ESI†), the black and red curves are assigned to the PL spectra at 0 and 60 min, suggesting that the peak area of PL increased by about 3 times before and after 60 min continuous illumination (Fig. 1E and Fig. S2D, ESI†). The PL intensity transformations were consistent with the phase transition processes (Fig. 1A, B and Fig. S2A, B, ESI†).
Because the PL spectra at 0 and 60 min are mainly related to the perovskite CsPbBr3 and the perovskite derivative CsPb2Br5, their time-resolved PL decay curves would be changed. Fig. 2 shows the time-resolved PL decay curves of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 (Fig. 2A), CsPb2Br5 (dispersed in ethanol in a dark room, Fig. 2B), and CsPbBr3 (after 60 min continuous illumination, Fig. 2C). The curves of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 and the transformed CsPbBr3 are quite similar, whereas a shorter lifetime of the transformed CsPb2Br5 suggested a high efficiency of non-radiative Auger recombination, which leads to weak PL performance. The fitting results of these curves are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Both curves of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 and the transformed CsPbBr3 were fitted with a double exponential, and their average lifetimes are 8.7 and 6.8 ns. The curve of the transformed CsPb2Br5 could be fitted with a triple exponential, and its average lifetime is 2.7 ns. Thus, the time-resolved PL decay study verified the phase transition process.

In order to further demonstrate the morphology evolution of the chemical composition and the structural phase transition process, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM studies. The morphology of CsPbBr3 could be tuned from CsPbBr3 nanosheets (Fig. 3A and B) to CsPbBr3 spherical nanoparticles by using different “poor” solvents. Due to using PVP as the capping ligands, which would form a thick ligand shell (Fig. 3B, D and F) on the surface, the stability of the CsPbBr3 nanosheets was improved even when dispersed in ethanol. Because of the dissolution of CsBr in ethanol, the surface of the perovskite nanosheets became porous and uneven (Fig. 3C and Scheme 1), and the crystal lattice showed an obvious change, which implies the structural phase has changed from orthorhombic CsPbBr3 to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (Fig. 3C and D). Such a process could be reversed in ethanol when introduced to continuous illumination (Scheme 1), which is different from general irreversible phase transitions.10,12,30,31 The morphology of the transformed perovskite CsPbBr3 nanosheets was faultless (Fig. 3E), and the crystal lattice measurements indicated that the crystalline phase of the perovskite nanosheets changes to orthorhombic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (Fig. 3F).

The reversible chemical composition and structural phase transition process was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 4A, the spectrum is related to the perovskites dispersed in ethanol in the dark. The peaks in the red, green, and blue regions are assigned to Cs 3d, Pb 4f (Fig. 4A), and Br 3d, and their fine spectra are shown in Fig. 4B. Based on these results, the element ratio of Cs/Pb/Br is calculated to be 12.4/25.8/61.8. Such an element ratio approximately matches 1:2:5, which implies the crystalline phase of the perovskite nanosheets is tetragonal CsPb2Br5.13Fig. 4C is the spectrum related to the perovskites dispersed in ethanol after continuous illumination. The peaks in the red, green, and blue regions (Fig. 4C) are assigned to Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d, and their fine spectra are shown in Fig. 4D. According to these spectra, the element ratio of Cs/Pb/Br is 19.0/22.1/58.9. This element ratio approximately matches 1:1:3, which implies the crystalline phase of the perovskite nanosheets is orthorhombic CsPbBr3. The solid-state UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence emission spectra were used to monitor the reversible compositional and structural transition processes between the perovskite CsPbBr3 and the perovskite derivative CsPb2Br5 (Fig. S4A and B, ESI†). Both the solid-state diffuse reflectance spectra and PL emission spectra showed negligible shift after the compositional and structural transition process.

In summary, we have demonstrated a novel reversible light-mediated reversible compositional and structural transition process from orthorhombic CsPbBr3 to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 nanosheets or vice versa. This study on reversible compositional and structural transitions of cesium lead halide perovskites will further deepen our understanding of their controlled synthesis, post-processing, and decomposition pathway. By a suitable choice of sources and synthetic parameters, it is reasonable to expect that the present study can be extended for the rational design and synthesis of other metal halide perovskite materials, which would have great realistic significance and broad application prospects in next-generation optical and optoelectronic devices.
